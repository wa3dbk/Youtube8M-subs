00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.870
 there were good forest conditions in all sectors 

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:15.039
 and of course good water conditions 

00:00:15.659 --> 00:00:18.550
 the use of agricultural frontier expansion 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.009
 aido 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:21.470
 deteriorating 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.769
 very much the bad forest joke 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:27.019
 that each sector has 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:29.319
 when I'm going 

00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:30.249
 Water 

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:32.660
 who goes has a good quality 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.060
 what problems do we have in animals 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.850
 creel the basic problems and queens and then find that the animals 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.180
 when paid 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.230
 poor water quality 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.820
 we can parasites 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.910
 per cent the parasites the bowls and diarrheas 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.690
 diseases as the base the static we can reduce the demands of the country 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.660
 means that if you do not try to clarify 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.390
 different as the animals decrease 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.810
 gradually in his venture 

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:06.710
 by aníbal bertón baraguá 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.420
 for obvious reasons every day 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.420
 That amount needs a farmer 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:21.810
 the amount of water that in bold percent this is to sustain your livestock 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.810
 It depends mainly on the production line st 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.450
 percent milk cattle water consumption is 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.980
 higher because 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.310
 percent in milk production 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.330
 they demand a lot of water 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.290
 that is to say that it is percent and an animal can consume daily 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.550
 50 liters of water 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.499
 always on when is this 

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:52.340
 grazing 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.030
 if the animal is supplied 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.939
 Diego is strangled 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:02.119
 and it is supplied with the no and concentrated water consumption is almost superior 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:05.380
 80 liters in adult animals 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.380
 according to well to milk production quantities 

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:13.159
 the factors of diet that affect the consumption of water sun 

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:17.259
 amount of dry matter present the food 

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:23.169
 nature of the food temperature of the field has experienced availability of each 

00:02:23.169 --> 00:02:25.859
 which and with had of salts 

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:28.290
 aa 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.550
 our 4th animals have so much milk 

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:34.079
 and in the flesh he has this 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:35.609
 on your farm 

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:37.670
 we currently have cd 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:38.949
 15 animals 

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:41.509
 for milk production 

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:44.509
 in this way it is 6 

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:48.659
 in not only do we have a 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:49.619
 tournament 

00:02:49.619 --> 00:02:52.149
 then of growth 

00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:55.699
 that is who the 15 hours that I will consume daily 

00:02:56.969 --> 00:02:59.779
 750 liters 

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:00.759
 Of something 

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:02.250
 and water is good 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.619
 quality 

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:06.619
 I am this method in the summer time 

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:09.970
 a genius of the country we have 12 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.309
 times when summer 

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:14.649
 it has its incidence 

00:03:14.649 --> 00:03:17.649
 certainly is a critical stage in which the judge 

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:19.839
 tekken 

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:20.929
 foresee 

00:03:20.929 --> 00:03:23.599
 different circumstances for what 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:25.720
 of the routine of the farm 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:26.839
 dont have 

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:29.019
 a very strong uncle 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:34.099
 not fortunately regarding water the farm has its own birth 

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:37.249
 what generates 

00:03:37.249 --> 00:03:42.129
 the city amount necessary for the management conditions of the farm is a 

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:44.429
 water of very good quality 

00:03:44.429 --> 00:03:47.429
 and of course the point of birth we have not pursued 

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:53.919
 several decades ago 

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:55.419
 p 

00:03:55.419 --> 00:03:58.009
 in the wake of 

00:03:58.009 --> 00:04:01.459
 the exhaustion of what was a bankrupt 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:04.459
 that passed by the edge of the farm by the side 

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:08.299
 southwestern 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:10.779
 due to the need to search 

00:04:10.779 --> 00:04:12.529
 within it 

00:04:12.529 --> 00:04:13.999
 a source that 

00:04:13.999 --> 00:04:16.999
 that will help us solve the need for water 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:22.330
 yes fortunately in this place was about four meters from 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.120
 depth 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.749
 p 

00:04:25.749 --> 00:04:27.590
 the water source 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:29.199
 so 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:31.999
 Here a cistern was built 

00:04:31.999 --> 00:04:37.080
 and from this birth percent and we are confronting productivity 

00:04:37.079 --> 00:04:38.590
 of the farm 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.509
 she finishes 

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:44.919
 fidelity through a pipe through a hose is always a little deep 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.320
 let's say the water still pool that existed and the entire farm 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.279
 they were from here to there to 1 100 

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:57.050
 120 meters or so 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.120
 by gravity 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.509
 i 

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:03.509
 the overflow of the pool where this same water 

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:07.009
 we are not storing in +100 preserved days 

00:05:07.809 --> 00:05:09.249
 what 

00:05:09.249 --> 00:05:11.089
 Perez is not 

00:05:11.089 --> 00:05:12.620
 helping even more 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.830
 for through arriaga in summer time 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.900
 to maintain productivity conditions 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.690
 through the rain we can spend water for human consumption 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.400
 and put to prophet which 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:30.350
 in many places in the world where water is not available in quantity and quality 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:35.180
 rainwater is necessary for consumption 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:36.169
 Source of supply
