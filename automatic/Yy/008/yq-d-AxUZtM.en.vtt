either know beforehand or you have to

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.569 
either know beforehand or you have to
wait<00:00:29.699> till<00:00:29.880> you<00:00:29.970> go<00:00:30.150> and<00:00:30.720> get<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:30.990> referral

but<00:00:32.579> I<00:00:32.610> guess<00:00:32.880> what<00:00:33.030> I<00:00:33.059> really<00:00:33.329> want<00:00:33.480> to<00:00:33.540> talk

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
but I guess what I really want to talk

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.340 
but I guess what I really want to talk
about<00:00:33.690> is<00:00:33.989> timing<00:00:34.320> I<00:00:34.710> have<00:00:35.280> seen<00:00:36.110> some<00:00:37.110> amazing

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
about is timing I have seen some amazing

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.720 
about is timing I have seen some amazing
things<00:00:37.820> when<00:00:38.820> Mateo<00:00:39.180> was<00:00:39.270> adopted<00:00:40.129> we<00:00:41.129> really

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
things when Mateo was adopted we really

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.479 
things when Mateo was adopted we really
really<00:00:41.879> really<00:00:42.300> thought<00:00:42.930> that<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:44.309> adoption

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
really really thought that the adoption

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.520 
really really thought that the adoption
was<00:00:44.879> at<00:00:45.329> some<00:00:45.510> point<00:00:45.719> not<00:00:45.840> going<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.050> happen<00:00:46.170> it

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
was at some point not going to happen it

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.229 
was at some point not going to happen it
that<00:00:46.800> option<00:00:47.340> actually<00:00:47.610> went<00:00:47.760> fast<00:00:47.969> it<00:00:48.120> was

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
that option actually went fast it was

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.510 
that option actually went fast it was
about<00:00:48.360> seven<00:00:48.750> months<00:00:48.870> however<00:00:49.370> there<00:00:50.370> was<00:00:50.460> a

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
about seven months however there was a

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.200 
about seven months however there was a
mudslide<00:00:51.030> they<00:00:51.930> had<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.320> hunt<00:00:52.559> down<00:00:53.210> distant

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
mudslide they had to hunt down distant

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.369 
mudslide they had to hunt down distant
relatives<00:00:54.629> who<00:00:54.780> didn't<00:00:55.020> even<00:00:55.199> know<00:00:55.320> she

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
relatives who didn't even know she

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.369
