insurance takes to data integration is

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.060 
insurance takes to data integration is
really<00:00:07.629> driven<00:00:07.839> by<00:00:07.990> wanting<00:00:08.890> to<00:00:08.980> achieve

databases that we are trying to bring
together<00:00:16.270> and<00:00:16.930> we<00:00:17.020> want<00:00:17.170> to<00:00:17.230> ensure<00:00:17.500> that<00:00:17.530> we

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:17.769 
together and we want to ensure that we

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:19.080 
together and we want to ensure that we
when<00:00:18.070> we<00:00:18.160> do<00:00:18.250> bring<00:00:18.430> it<00:00:18.550> together

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:19.090 
when we do bring it together

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.080 
when we do bring it together
that<00:00:19.539> we're<00:00:19.930> getting<00:00:20.080> the<00:00:20.529> same<00:00:20.740> answers<00:00:21.340> for

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:29.920 
achieve that when we consolidate we make

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.859 
achieve that when we consolidate we make
sure<00:00:30.070> that<00:00:30.250> we<00:00:30.369> move<00:00:30.550> to<00:00:30.789> a<00:00:30.970> single<00:00:31.449> version<00:00:31.660> of

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:34.660 
the truth there's no debate about is

the truth there's no debate about is
this<00:00:34.870> the<00:00:34.989> right<00:00:35.110> answer<00:00:35.469> or<00:00:35.530> not<00:00:35.620> that's<00:00:36.040> just

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280 
this the right answer or not that's just

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.100 
this the right answer or not that's just
to<00:00:36.340> focus<00:00:36.550> on<00:00:36.850> what<00:00:37.180> business<00:00:37.540> decisions<00:00:37.930> do

to focus on what business decisions do

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:39.389 
to focus on what business decisions do
we<00:00:38.200> need<00:00:38.350> to<00:00:38.440> take<00:00:38.620> based<00:00:38.950> on<00:00:39.100> these<00:00:39.219> numbers

00:00:39.389 --> 00:00:39.399 
we need to take based on these numbers

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:41.340 
we need to take based on these numbers
third<00:00:40.059> our<00:00:40.180> integration<00:00:40.719> is<00:00:40.870> is<00:00:41.079> very

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
third our integration is is very

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:42.869 
third our integration is is very
important<00:00:41.890> to<00:00:41.980> the<00:00:42.160> insurance<00:00:42.789> industry

00:00:42.869 --> 00:00:42.879

overall

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.189 
overall
because<00:00:44.920> good<00:00:45.879> management<00:00:46.300> information<00:00:46.660> is

00:00:47.189 --> 00:00:47.199 
because good management information is

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:48.990 
because good management information is
really<00:00:47.860> the<00:00:48.039> lifeblood<00:00:48.280> of<00:00:48.610> any<00:00:48.820> insurance

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.000 
really the lifeblood of any insurance

really the lifeblood of any insurance
company<00:00:50.190> there<00:00:51.190> are<00:00:51.280> two<00:00:51.430> main<00:00:51.610> reasons

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640 
company there are two main reasons

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.590 
company there are two main reasons
behind<00:00:52.149> that<00:00:52.980> first<00:00:53.980> of<00:00:54.129> those<00:00:54.250> is<00:00:54.670> to<00:00:55.059> do<00:00:55.210> with

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
behind that first of those is to do with

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.619 
behind that first of those is to do with
there<00:00:55.870> being<00:00:56.109> a<00:00:56.379> lag<00:00:56.890> in<00:00:57.250> our<00:00:57.489> business<00:00:57.910> if<00:00:58.480> you

00:00:58.619 --> 00:00:58.629 
there being a lag in our business if you

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:00.060 
there being a lag in our business if you
think<00:00:58.809> about<00:00:58.899> it's<00:00:59.170> a<00:00:59.320> manufacturing<00:00:59.980> company

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
think about it's a manufacturing company

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.189 
think about it's a manufacturing company
they've<00:01:00.609> got<00:01:00.730> a<00:01:00.760> very<00:01:01.000> good<00:01:01.210> idea<00:01:01.809> about<00:01:01.840> the

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:02.199 
they've got a very good idea about the

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:03.959 
they've got a very good idea about the
costs<00:01:02.620> that<00:01:02.649> they<00:01:02.859> have<00:01:03.039> they<00:01:03.820> would

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:03.969 
costs that they have they would

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:05.550 
costs that they have they would
understand<00:01:04.420> about<00:01:04.660> the<00:01:04.930> factories<00:01:05.320> that<00:01:05.410> they

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560 
understand about the factories that they

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.050 
understand about the factories that they
have<00:01:05.770> the<00:01:06.040> raw<00:01:06.190> materials<00:01:06.670> they<00:01:06.820> need<00:01:06.970> to

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
have the raw materials they need to

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.930 
have the raw materials they need to
process<00:01:07.480> the<00:01:07.660> machinery<00:01:08.110> that<00:01:08.140> they're<00:01:08.380> using

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:08.940 
process the machinery that they're using

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.580 
process the machinery that they're using
with<00:01:09.940> insurance<00:01:10.480> there's<00:01:11.140> another<00:01:11.320> dimension

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
with insurance there's another dimension

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.030 
with insurance there's another dimension
a<00:01:12.100> big<00:01:12.700> chunk<00:01:13.150> of<00:01:13.270> the<00:01:13.420> costs<00:01:13.720> that<00:01:13.750> we<00:01:13.870> incur

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
a big chunk of the costs that we incur

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.930 
a big chunk of the costs that we incur
the<00:01:15.040> claims<00:01:15.280> that<00:01:15.460> we'll<00:01:15.580> pay<00:01:15.760> out<00:01:15.910> on

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:15.940 
the claims that we'll pay out on

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.570 
the claims that we'll pay out on
policies<00:01:16.540> in<00:01:16.660> the<00:01:16.750> future<00:01:17.080> is<00:01:17.290> not<00:01:18.160> known<00:01:18.400> at

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:18.580 
policies in the future is not known at

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.340 
policies in the future is not known at
the<00:01:18.670> time<00:01:18.880> that<00:01:19.060> we're<00:01:19.210> setting<00:01:19.540> the<00:01:19.930> price<00:01:20.170> of

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
the time that we're setting the price of

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.380 
the time that we're setting the price of
products<00:01:20.650> and<00:01:21.160> so<00:01:21.580> we<00:01:21.700> need<00:01:21.820> to<00:01:21.910> have<00:01:22.060> a<00:01:22.090> very

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
products and so we need to have a very

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.780 
products and so we need to have a very
good<00:01:22.630> understanding<00:01:22.780> of<00:01:23.530> the<00:01:23.800> past<00:01:24.010> in<00:01:24.370> order

good understanding of the past in order
to<00:01:24.910> estimate<00:01:25.210> what<00:01:25.540> will<00:01:25.630> happen<00:01:25.930> in<00:01:26.020> the

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
to estimate what will happen in the

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.230 
to estimate what will happen in the
future<00:01:26.260> a<00:01:26.650> second<00:01:27.490> dimension<00:01:27.730> is<00:01:28.180> that

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
future a second dimension is that

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.800 
future a second dimension is that
insurance<00:01:29.140> is<00:01:29.410> a<00:01:29.710> cyclical<00:01:30.280> industry<00:01:30.820> and<00:01:31.360> if

you look at the market as a whole
there'll<00:01:33.490> be<00:01:33.520> periods<00:01:33.970> where<00:01:34.240> it's<00:01:34.600> making

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:34.870 
there'll be periods where it's making
