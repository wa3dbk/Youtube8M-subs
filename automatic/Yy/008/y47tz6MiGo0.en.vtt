itself<00:04:18.940> I'm<00:04:19.780> gonna<00:04:19.989> be<00:04:20.199> honest<00:04:20.620> as<00:04:20.799> that

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
itself I'm gonna be honest as that

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.300 
itself I'm gonna be honest as that
second<00:04:21.579> season<00:04:21.760> was<00:04:22.479> not<00:04:22.930> my<00:04:23.229> favorite<00:04:23.620> when<00:04:24.190> I

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
second season was not my favorite when I

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.340 
second season was not my favorite when I
was<00:04:24.490> a<00:04:24.520> kid<00:04:24.850> I<00:04:25.150> always<00:04:25.570> prefer<00:04:25.990> the<00:04:26.020> first

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
was a kid I always prefer the first

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:27.750 
was a kid I always prefer the first
season<00:04:26.650> I<00:04:26.710> thought<00:04:26.830> the<00:04:26.979> characters<00:04:27.430> and<00:04:27.669> the

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
season I thought the characters and the

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.370 
season I thought the characters and the
stories<00:04:28.090> were<00:04:28.210> stronger<00:04:28.660> although<00:04:29.289> that's

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
stories were stronger although that's

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.020 
stories were stronger although that's
not<00:04:29.590> to<00:04:29.680> say<00:04:29.830> the<00:04:29.889> second<00:04:30.220> season<00:04:30.550> is<00:04:30.669> not

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
not to say the second season is not

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.150 
not to say the second season is not
without<00:04:31.210> its<00:04:31.330> memorable<00:04:31.690> moments<00:04:32.169> or<00:04:32.320> is<00:04:32.919> not

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
without its memorable moments or is not

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.439 
without its memorable moments or is not
enjoyable<00:04:33.550> at<00:04:33.699> all<00:04:33.760> I<00:04:33.820> think<00:04:34.000> it's<00:04:34.210> still<00:04:34.389> a

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:34.449 
enjoyable at all I think it's still a

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:36.060 
enjoyable at all I think it's still a
very<00:04:34.720> enjoyable<00:04:34.990> season<00:04:35.440> it's<00:04:35.770> not<00:04:35.860> the

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
very enjoyable season it's not the

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.340 
very enjoyable season it's not the
strongest<00:04:36.460> season<00:04:37.090> in<00:04:37.180> the<00:04:37.270> series<00:04:37.600> but<00:04:38.139> I

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:38.350 
strongest season in the series but I

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:40.350 
strongest season in the series but I
still<00:04:38.740> have<00:04:38.979> a<00:04:39.010> nostalgic<00:04:39.610> fondness<00:04:39.789> for<00:04:40.030> it

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 
still have a nostalgic fondness for it

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.960
