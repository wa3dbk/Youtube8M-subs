00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 hello again today he plays recognition class 

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.860
 today we will learn to identify an antidote to what 

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:09.659
 you'll see it's the easiest thing in the world 

00:00:09.659 --> 00:00:11.279
 let us begin 

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:14.279
 to start an anti eta 

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:18.800
 a person that for very reason that very few times is understood is in 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.210
 against people who have this taste for manga anime 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:23.019
 che and pop 

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:23.900
 etc 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.189
 I can not imagine the real aspect because I have never seen one on the street 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:32.410
 then they are the ones who say that opaques do not go out on the street hahaha 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:34.210
 well let's not get lost 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.920
 I have never seen an anti taco down the street 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.310
 but it could be something like this 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:43.030
 in this way you could understand the reason why I do not see any 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:44.550
 the street ha ha 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.670
 an anti-taco will always write like a rude primary child 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.040
 they only know how to insult the one who writes mess with his mother writing messages 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.870
 with less sense than the chiki-chiki 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:56.980
 i most horny 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:58.720
 they do not know how to write well 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.820
 in short, his way of writing intends to intimidate the victim but the 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.290
 true result makes you split your ass of laughter 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.759
 Anti-tacos tend to like reque toni or pressing catch 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.700
 at least the majority I've seen 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.840
 I do not know what will be more sick if I see drawings or use women as objects 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.170
 sexual 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.490
 I do not have anything against those who like pressing catch 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.240
 I do not see anything wrong with it 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.180
 there are also those who, at the same time, are against the rebus 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.240
 they are also against utah kush their reasons will have 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.920
 some pacos tend to get into opaque channels that do not even 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.370
 they know to try to insult them and tell them to mature 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.570
 in these cases I recommend you to take a handkerchief since I will need dried 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.220
 tears of laughter attack that will give you ha ha 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.280
 to see they talk about maturing when they waste their time getting involved with people 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.120
 they do not even know their names 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.580
 I break my ass 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.670
 they talk about maturing when they enter your channel to tell you how ugly that is 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:56.410
 channel 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.680
 it is not more mature to move from a channel if you do not like it 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.930
 they are really good jokes hahahaha 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.810
 I guess these harder quotes are considered men for having 

00:02:08.689 --> 00:02:10.449
 talking about dating 

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:14.119
 an anti tacu surely use the story of the bride to call them 

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:15.189
 immature 

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:19.150
 As far as I know nobody wrote a law that forced people to have a partner or 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.989
 that must have it by cojones from x age 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:24.849
 here they will have a girlfriend or boyfriend who is interested 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:27.529
 and as they say, everything will come 

00:02:27.529 --> 00:02:31.489
 I know otaku girls and otaku boys who have already received their 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:32.689
 half orange 

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:35.689
 so to say these things I can only think of one thing 

00:02:36.249 --> 00:02:37.839
 ignorance live 

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:39.859
 Sirs 

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:42.529
 I do not think I've explained enough 

00:02:42.529 --> 00:02:44.729
 so I say goodbye and even another 

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:46.169
 they left a 

00:02:46.169 --> 00:02:49.169
 is going to let you have demonized uu 

00:02:49.679 --> 00:02:53.279
 It seems that little of the road also wants to teach us something about 

00:02:53.279 --> 00:02:54.709
 the anti otakus 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:55.869
 in agreement 

00:02:55.869 --> 00:02:57.900
 I will ask the questions to see 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.109

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:02.590

 the area as is the appearance of an old aqueduct 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.959
 It has a very wide area if you still saw anti-smoking on the street until you 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:10.929
 would you say 

00:03:10.929 --> 00:03:15.609
