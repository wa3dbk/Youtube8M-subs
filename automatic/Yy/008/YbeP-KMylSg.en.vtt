 that's exactly what he has for me as% of the top way Risks has been doing since 2000 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.650
 he otherwise would have been able to be like beings against the top, March half past

 So who has Daniel today does not suffer with mixed feelings anymore 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.450
 So especially to forgive that I first enjoyed Bregenz Weser with him 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.610
