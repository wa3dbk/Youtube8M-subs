00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.850 
natural mentality I
I<00:02:05.090> thought<00:02:05.659> about<00:02:05.780> it<00:02:05.930> at<00:02:06.170> first<00:02:06.200> and<00:02:06.650> I<00:02:06.710> was

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
I thought about it at first and I was

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.859 
I thought about it at first and I was
like<00:02:06.979> oh<00:02:07.130> why

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.020 

just<00:02:10.289> get<00:02:10.409> a<00:02:10.440> relaxer<00:02:10.979> you<00:02:11.430> know<00:02:11.519> you're

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
just get a relaxer you know you're

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.089 
just get a relaxer you know you're
constantly<00:02:12.510> straightening<00:02:13.140> your<00:02:13.260> hair<00:02:13.319> and

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
constantly straightening your hair and

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:17.479 
constantly straightening your hair and
then<00:02:14.239> I<00:02:15.239> thought<00:02:15.720> about<00:02:15.780> it<00:02:16.260> and<00:02:16.440> it<00:02:16.950> doesn't

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
then I thought about it and it doesn't

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:20.410 
then I thought about it and it doesn't
make<00:02:17.549> sense<00:02:17.610> to<00:02:17.970> do

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.410 

maybe<00:02:21.140> it's<00:02:22.040> that<00:02:22.190> you<00:02:22.490> don't<00:02:22.520> like<00:02:23.060> your

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
maybe it's that you don't like your

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.280 
maybe it's that you don't like your
natural<00:02:23.770> curly<00:02:24.770> or<00:02:24.950> you<00:02:25.130> know<00:02:25.220> find<00:02:25.459> whatever

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
natural curly or you know find whatever

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.900 
natural curly or you know find whatever
so<00:02:27.290> you<00:02:27.560> straighten<00:02:28.040> it<00:02:28.160> which<00:02:28.370> I<00:02:28.550> want<00:02:28.730> to<00:02:28.790> use

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
so you straighten it which I want to use

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.080 
so you straighten it which I want to use
chemical

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
chemical

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.940 
chemical
you<00:02:30.450> know<00:02:30.540> it's<00:02:30.720> probably<00:02:30.959> less<00:02:31.379> damaging

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
you know it's probably less damaging

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.550 
you know it's probably less damaging
that<00:02:32.129> way<00:02:32.340> then<00:02:32.970> to<00:02:33.480> put<00:02:33.629> a<00:02:33.660> relaxer<00:02:33.810> in<00:02:34.170> your

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
that way then to put a relaxer in your

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.030 
that way then to put a relaxer in your
hair<00:02:34.680> probably<00:02:34.890> grows<00:02:35.220> more<00:02:36.120> easily<00:02:36.540> to

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
hair probably grows more easily to

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.620 
hair probably grows more easily to
straighten<00:02:38.040> it<00:02:38.160> that<00:02:38.340> way<00:02:38.489> and<00:02:38.870> the<00:02:39.870> hill

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.840 

listen<00:02:42.990> to<00:02:43.170> me<00:02:43.290> that's<00:02:43.560> where<00:02:43.920> your<00:02:44.070> mindset

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
petite to their area to get it to be

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.040 
petite to their area to get it to be
straight<00:02:59.270> because<00:02:59.450> there's<00:02:59.750> plenty<00:02:59.960> of
