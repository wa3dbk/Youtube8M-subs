 speak speak speak speak cartoons and 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.899
 Brazil posters, how are you? 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.990
 David and I are here with tips and 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.059
 Round 12 analysis though 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.590
 first guys for you not 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.929
 know our site is a site of 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.910
 cartolano dot net that has everything a 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.670
 Catholic needs the first link in the 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.369
 description occurs there then 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.470
 last round 71 points 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.869
 unfortunately I stayed between geovane and 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.000
 ricardo oliveira I have opted for giovanni 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.750
 the game ended up being expelled and complicated 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.739
 A little bit of our score but that's it. 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.500
 Round 12 in the area 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.219
 Let's quote here from expensive palm trees and 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.899
 avaí as a good game to post 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:45.989
 international and Flemish other good game 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:49.100
 fluminense and cruzeiro and corinthians and 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.100
 athletic paranaense 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.879
 to the team then personal on goal 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.579
 people already come face to face with rogério ceni 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.829
 with a great for that round by the fact 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.680
 to be the official penalty taker and 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.690
 São Paulo's lack that adds a lot 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.510
 but my goalkeeper passed round won 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.530
 marcelo lomba who is undervalued is 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.590
 a keeper who has been standing out 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.560
 enough in this championship the black bridge 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.630
 in total curitiba or coritiba is 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.810
 desperate will win the joinville in 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.580
 The house of the whore in sound and up 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.830
 Anyway, he believes Marcelo 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.130
 and was to make good number of defenses 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:29.579
 difficult but my second goalkeeper if I 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:32.369
 if it were not lomba would be the rogério ceni 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:35.720
 other tips are muriel for this round 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:38.700
 we have the Alex Wall is also a great 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:42.090
 diego cavalieri do fluminense 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.040
 renan do goiás and that's the ball for 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.720
 side 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:50.250
 my first lateral femsa 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:52.710
 highlighting quite Egidio take was 7.3 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.170
 a good performance but I hope he goes 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.149
 score even higher against the 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.860
 Avaí is a player who lives excellent 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.790
 phase by the palm trees 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.409
 I think this will count a lot 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:09.450
 on this page we can cite an eliton 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:12.750
 silva rodney wagner lucas douglas santos 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:15.000
 as good bets but in the second side 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.310
 Not on this page of the ancine. 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.980
 now on the second page that we already 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.870
 takes the side of carlos caesar is 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.540
 even one that was interesting that 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.489
 the short has a good presence in the 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.980
 attack but keep an eye on that maybe the 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:32.580
 Patrick play but for now it 's the 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:35.910
 carlos caesar the team took it out - 3.20 he 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:38.910
 has a very high average of 5 point 27 and 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.640
 I think this will tell you a lot. 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.680
 on the second side for that round 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:47.280
 of this page we can still cite william 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:49.049
 and cereceda bora la zaga in the rear that the 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.200
 People are going to pick up our first 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:54.750
 defender that leonardo silva is a 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.160
 quarterback who at home is not a monster 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.099
 played the last game with the athletic 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.500
 and will now simply pick up the 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:03.390
 sport that has a great phase has the tendency 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.180
 of stealing some balls 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.500
 this game between athletic and sport is a 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.690
 interesting game that I do not think 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.480
 will have so much goal so my 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.349
 bet is being carlos esa and leonardo 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.079
 silva 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:18.569
 my next defender is of the palm trees yes 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:20.190
 I will not or I'll paint this round. 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:23.519
 by victor ramos 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:26.160
 That's right, he misses a lot, but he 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:29.160
 It's really cheap, and that's going to 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:32.160
 help a little bit about the 112 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:34.380
 cartoons still lack half and attack the 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.079
 Attack is soldered too, so I go. 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:39.299
 begin to balance it 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:42.359
 other interesting quarterback are gil 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:46.139
 victor hugo rodrigo we also have the 

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:49.200
 maria thiago heleno antônio carlos 

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:51.780
 the defender of goiás felipe macedo and alex 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.670
 Alves are also good and this though by 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.560
 kind of a memory, guys, this 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.739
 round I'm basically betting 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.000
 teams that are having a good record 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:01.859
 at home and abroad 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.230
 case of palm trees that is in excellent phase 

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:06.540
 and case of athletic miner who is 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.400
 simply the leader of the championship I 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.260
 I know that opponents can be up to 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.630
 difficult but I 'm looking at the 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.849
 I think it's a good 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:17.010
 my first half is d'alessandro 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:18.660
 People, I think it's the most 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:22.230
 Bet that I'm going to put 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:24.180
 The most dangerous of the shit is the midfield 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:26.700
 simply team leader of Inter 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.920
 is the official penalty taker if not 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:31.590
 I'm wrong and my first choice 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:33.480
 my next my field is not in that 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:37.640
 page but now I will name a few 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:41.460
 renato cajá rioja and blue blood 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:43.560
 Williams and Jonas believe they are good 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:46.770
 on this page were michel bastos 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:49.590
 although the next on the second page I already 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:51.180
 I'm going to take my half field that otavio this. 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.340
 even playing away from home while 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.210
 Corinthians and has a tendency to steal 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.920
 ball 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:58.890
 that's where I'm betting 

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:00.630
 in my next midfield it's paulo 

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:02.700
 Roberto, that's right 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:05.250
 You can find this 2000 field well. 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:06.990
 risky but not if we have a 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:09.090
 Look here they have a 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:11.880
 optimal statistics 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:13.350
 Look, look at the next one . 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.410
 ball and 27 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:18.330
 but what made me choose not only 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:21.060
 your average is very high 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:22.080
 but also the low number of absences 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:25.740
 committed 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:27.600
 Look at this 13 and 14 is very little lack 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.800
 to how much ball stolen what 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.450
 They do 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.760
 I think they're going to give a little 

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:33.240
 balance into our midst this 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.850
 page 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:38.760
 we can also cite felipe menezes o 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:40.890
 elias of corinthians robinho is a little 

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:42.900
 risky but also to quote and 

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:43.950
 while this is now for our 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:46.200
 attack 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:48.960
 in the attack we will get the cone here 

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:51.090
 fred not he is so coni are not 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:53.130
 making good games for the Rio de Janeiro 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:54.750
 fluminense will face the cruise that 

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:57.750
 out of the house is not making good games 

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:59.669
 and the Fluminense at home is very strong 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:02.970
 I believe that Fred can leave his 

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:04.800
 mark below fred we have lucas 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:06.210
 Pratto and always a great I like 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:09.030
 Enough of lucas pratto 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:11.910
 although he is not doing these goal 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:13.800
 recent games but it's a good 

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:15.540
 we have rafael marques who will enter 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:18.990
 Here he is an attacker who plays for 

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:21.300
 half- zip is and has many functions in 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:23.730
 palm trees but they always appear as 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:27.620
 surprise piece in the attack has a good move 

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:29.540
 has good pass is a very player 

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:32.560
 Good, and join my team. 

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:33.800
 this round and to close the attack we have 

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.600
 nilmar 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:38.840
 even the Flemish is not in a 

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:40.970
 good situation believe that unites evil 

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:42.770
 d'alessando will score in this match 

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:45.410
 I will now quote other players 

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:48.740
 interesting we have a pyro biro 

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:50.030
 lucas pratto luís fabiano and alexandre 

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:52.639
 duck 

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:55.130
 vagner love is a great little bargain 

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:58.010
 updated on this second page as well. 

00:06:55.130 --> 00:07:01.539
 We can cite wrongly with a great Pedro 

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:04.699
 rock has been doing a lot lately 

00:07:01.539 --> 00:07:07.220
 and this is it though for our coach 

00:07:04.699 --> 00:07:10.150
 I'm looking for a coach. 

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:13.310
 palm trees and cartoons left over for this 

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:16.430
 11.43 gave right so closed our 

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:19.280
 coach team we still have the levir 

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:22.970
 I thought it was a good idea some of the 

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:25.130
 region flores and guto ferreira are also 

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:27.530
 great off-side there 

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:29.240
 So people closed up our team. 

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:31.639
 for the 12th round 

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:34.700
 lomba egídio carlos césar leonardo silva 

00:07:31.639 --> 00:07:37.220
 victor ramos d'alessandro drinking paulo 

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:38.389
 roberto fred rafael marques nilmar e 

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:40.220
 Marcelo Oliveira 

00:07:38.389 --> 00:07:42.410
 If you liked this video, you already know. 

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:45.020
 that she leaves that jewel is inscribed on the 

00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:46.789
 channel to stay connected 

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:48.950
 against the very interesting you enjoy 

00:07:46.789 --> 00:07:51.380
 because before the round closes if I 

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:54.020
 change something on the team I can there 

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:56.889
 then these people until the next video 

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:56.889
 was
