00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:21.800 
the resonators because the guy who

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.130 
the resonators because the guy who
originally<00:00:23.060> put<00:00:24.060> my<00:00:24.150> mufflers<00:00:24.480> on<00:00:24.660> he<00:00:24.900> wanted

delete the just delete the resonators

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.630 
delete the just delete the resonators
which<00:00:28.710> is<00:00:28.859> really<00:00:29.519> really<00:00:30.119> really<00:00:30.269> ridiculous

the<00:00:38.940> resonators<00:00:39.450> so<00:00:40.320> yes<00:00:40.590> I<00:00:40.739> agree<00:00:40.890> that<00:00:41.190> it<00:00:41.460> is

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
the resonators so yes I agree that it is

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.060 
the resonators so yes I agree that it is
louder<00:00:41.850> without<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.420> resonators<00:00:42.930> but<00:00:43.170> now

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
louder without the resonators but now

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.410 
louder without the resonators but now
right<00:00:44.309> now<00:00:44.460> I'm<00:00:44.640> getting<00:00:44.820> that<00:00:45.030> done<00:00:45.239> next

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
week probably but these are flowmasters

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.819 
week probably but these are flowmasters
40<00:00:49.110> series<00:00:50.899> did<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:51.930> video<00:00:52.079> earlier<00:00:52.230> you<00:00:52.680> can
