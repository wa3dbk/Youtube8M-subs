hello<00:00:01.140> in<00:00:01.680> this<00:00:01.770> video<00:00:01.949> I'm<00:00:02.399> going<00:00:02.550> to<00:00:02.610> show

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
hello in this video I'm going to show

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:05.289 
hello in this video I'm going to show
you<00:00:02.939> how<00:00:03.179> to<00:00:03.210> find<00:00:03.750> the<00:00:04.020> center<00:00:04.500> of<00:00:04.740> a<00:00:04.890> circle

00:00:05.289 --> 00:00:05.299 
you how to find the center of a circle

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:08.960 
you how to find the center of a circle
this<00:00:06.299> method<00:00:06.750> works<00:00:07.130> not<00:00:08.130> just<00:00:08.160> for<00:00:08.519> complete

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
this method works not just for complete

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.270 
this method works not just for complete
circles<00:00:09.360> works<00:00:09.599> for<00:00:09.780> any<00:00:09.929> curve<00:00:10.440> as<00:00:10.679> long<00:00:11.070> as

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
circles works for any curve as long as

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.089 
circles works for any curve as long as
it<00:00:11.400> is<00:00:11.519> a<00:00:11.550> circular<00:00:12.240> curve<00:00:12.809> it<00:00:13.650> can't<00:00:13.920> be

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
it is a circular curve it can't be

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.160 
it is a circular curve it can't be
elliptical<00:00:14.790> it<00:00:14.969> can't<00:00:15.179> be<00:00:15.330> parabolic<00:00:15.780> it<00:00:16.080> has

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
elliptical it can't be parabolic it has

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.439 
elliptical it can't be parabolic it has
to<00:00:16.289> be<00:00:16.410> circular<00:00:17.029> but<00:00:18.029> it's<00:00:18.150> pretty<00:00:18.270> nifty

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
to be circular but it's pretty nifty

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.859 
to be circular but it's pretty nifty
method<00:00:19.010> if<00:00:20.010> you're<00:00:20.400> using<00:00:20.670> computer<00:00:21.630> software

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
method if you're using computer software

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.620 
method if you're using computer software
you<00:00:22.380> probably<00:00:22.800> won't<00:00:23.100> really<00:00:23.430> need<00:00:24.269> to<00:00:24.480> use

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
you probably won't really need to use

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.230 
you probably won't really need to use
this<00:00:24.900> method<00:00:25.289> because<00:00:25.640> the<00:00:26.640> circle<00:00:27.029> will<00:00:27.150> be

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
this method because the circle will be

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.490 
this method because the circle will be
constructed<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:27.900> you'll<00:00:28.050> be<00:00:28.140> able<00:00:28.199> to<00:00:28.349> find

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
constructed and you'll be able to find

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.390 
constructed and you'll be able to find
it<00:00:28.590> really<00:00:28.740> easy<00:00:28.830> like<00:00:29.130> if<00:00:29.250> you're<00:00:29.369> using

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
it really easy like if you're using

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.820 
it really easy like if you're using
AutoCAD<00:00:29.970> or<00:00:30.000> something<00:00:30.449> but<00:00:31.260> if<00:00:31.439> you're<00:00:31.590> using

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
AutoCAD or something but if you're using

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.920 
AutoCAD or something but if you're using
pencil<00:00:32.219> and<00:00:32.279> paper<00:00:32.489> and<00:00:32.820> you<00:00:33.540> need<00:00:33.690> to<00:00:33.750> find

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
pencil and paper and you need to find

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.630 
pencil and paper and you need to find
this<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.320> center<00:00:34.649> of<00:00:34.860> a<00:00:34.920> circle<00:00:35.070> that<00:00:35.309> you

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
this the center of a circle that you

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.569 
this the center of a circle that you
didn't<00:00:36.149> make<00:00:36.710> where's<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.890> center<00:00:38.100> it's

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
didn't make where's the center it's

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.790 
didn't make where's the center it's
going<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.760> be<00:00:38.850> somewhere<00:00:39.149> around<00:00:39.210> in<00:00:39.570> here<00:00:39.960> but

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
going to be somewhere around in here but

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.819 
going to be somewhere around in here but
there<00:00:40.980> is<00:00:41.250> an<00:00:41.520> exact<00:00:41.850> method<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:42.329> find<00:00:42.540> it<00:00:42.829> okay

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
there is an exact method to find it okay

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.420 
there is an exact method to find it okay
the<00:00:43.950> first<00:00:44.129> thing<00:00:44.309> you<00:00:44.520> do<00:00:44.700> is<00:00:45.539> realize<00:00:45.960> that

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 
the first thing you do is realize that

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.250 
the first thing you do is realize that
when<00:00:47.430> you<00:00:47.520> draw<00:00:47.760> you<00:00:48.719> see<00:00:48.870> if<00:00:48.960> I<00:00:49.020> can<00:00:49.110> get<00:00:49.200> my

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
when you draw you see if I can get my

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.260 
when you draw you see if I can get my
little<00:00:49.379> pen<00:00:49.590> on<00:00:49.710> here<00:00:49.920> when<00:00:50.730> you<00:00:50.820> draw<00:00:51.059> a

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
little pen on here when you draw a

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.569 
little pen on here when you draw a
radius<00:00:51.750> from<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.739> center<00:00:53.100> it's<00:00:53.309> going<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.489> be

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
radius from the center it's going to be

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:54.889 
radius from the center it's going to be
about<00:00:53.850> from<00:00:54.149> right<00:00:54.360> here

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
about from right here

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:01.099 
about from right here
out<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:56.430> here<00:00:57.770> the<00:00:58.879> radius<00:00:59.879> once<00:01:00.719> when<00:01:00.989> it

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
out to here the radius once when it

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.750 
out to here the radius once when it
touches<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.559> circle<00:01:01.920> is<00:01:02.309> going<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:02.670> be

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
touches the circle is going to be

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
touches the circle is going to be
perpendicular<00:01:03.180> to<00:01:04.909> the<00:01:05.909> tangent<00:01:06.360> line<00:01:06.600> that

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
perpendicular to the tangent line that

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.030 
perpendicular to the tangent line that
it<00:01:06.869> makes<00:01:07.110> it's<00:01:07.439> also<00:01:07.619> going<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:07.950> be

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
it makes it's also going to be

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.469 
it makes it's also going to be
perpendicular<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.790> a<00:01:10.729> what's<00:01:11.729> called<00:01:11.939> a<00:01:12.000> chord

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479

a really crappy drawer with my little

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.550 
a really crappy drawer with my little
pin<00:01:15.420> here<00:01:15.720> but<00:01:15.869> this<00:01:16.020> is<00:01:16.140> going<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.439> be<00:01:16.500> a

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
pin here but this is going to be a

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.530 
pin here but this is going to be a
perpendicular<00:01:16.860> line<00:01:17.189> as<00:01:17.580> well<00:01:17.759> if<00:01:18.439> you<00:01:20.210> make<00:01:21.210> a

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
perpendicular line as well if you make a

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.480 
perpendicular line as well if you make a
chord<00:01:22.290> on<00:01:23.330> a<00:01:24.330> circle<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.470> you<00:01:26.220> draw<00:01:26.460> a

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
chord on a circle and you draw a

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.160 
chord on a circle and you draw a
straight<00:01:26.850> line<00:01:26.880> between<00:01:27.119> it<00:01:27.720> all<00:01:27.840> you<00:01:27.990> got<00:01:28.080> to

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
straight line between it all you got to

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.700 
straight line between it all you got to
do<00:01:28.320> is<00:01:28.590> make<00:01:29.340> a<00:01:29.369> point<00:01:29.640> here<00:01:29.909> right<00:01:30.810> here<00:01:31.079> at

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
do is make a point here right here at

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.560 
do is make a point here right here at
another<00:01:32.130> point<00:01:32.400> here<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:32.850> connect<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.390> line

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
another point here and connect the line

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.780 
another point here and connect the line
this<00:01:34.350> is<00:01:34.470> this<00:01:34.650> is<00:01:34.799> what's<00:01:34.979> called<00:01:35.100> a<00:01:35.189> chord<00:01:35.579> of

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
this is this is what's called a chord of

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.180 
this is this is what's called a chord of

perpendicular bisector of it because the

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.060 
perpendicular bisector of it because the
radius<00:01:48.200> is<00:01:48.410> going<00:01:48.470> to<00:01:48.650> be<00:01:48.710> a<00:01:48.770> perpendicular

bisector of the chord so to do that
tricky<00:01:53.960> method<00:01:54.320> you<00:01:54.410> need<00:01:54.530> a<00:01:54.590> compass<00:01:55.540> you

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
tricky method you need a compass you

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.650 
tricky method you need a compass you
draw<00:01:56.870> a<00:01:56.900> circle<00:01:57.350> from<00:01:58.070> one<00:01:58.310> point<00:01:58.580> to<00:01:58.880> the

00:01:59.650 --> 00:01:59.660 
draw a circle from one point to the

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.810 
draw a circle from one point to the
other<00:01:59.870> point<00:01:59.960> and<00:02:00.410> that's<00:02:00.890> its<00:02:01.100> radius<00:02:01.490> and

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
other point and that's its radius and

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.790 
other point and that's its radius and
you<00:02:02.690> do<00:02:02.810> another<00:02:03.080> circle<00:02:03.410> from<00:02:03.560> the<00:02:03.650> other

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:03.800 
you do another circle from the other

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.130 
you do another circle from the other
point<00:02:04.090> the<00:02:05.090> intersection<00:02:05.870> of<00:02:05.930> those<00:02:06.080> two

point the intersection of those two

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.719 
point the intersection of those two
circles<00:02:08.770> there's<00:02:09.770> two<00:02:09.890> points<00:02:10.100> there<00:02:10.429> you

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
circles there's two points there you

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.300 
circles there's two points there you
connect<00:02:11.060> the<00:02:11.209> points<00:02:11.570> and<00:02:11.780> you<00:02:11.870> draw<00:02:12.080> a<00:02:12.110> line

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
connect the points and you draw a line

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.300 
connect the points and you draw a line
what<00:02:13.310> you<00:02:13.340> have<00:02:13.550> here<00:02:13.820> with<00:02:14.030> this<00:02:14.180> line<00:02:14.450> is<00:02:14.780> a

through<00:02:21.230> the<00:02:21.350> radius<00:02:21.709> but<00:02:21.890> you<00:02:22.010> don't<00:02:22.160> know

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
through the radius but you don't know

it doesn't matter where these lines are
you<00:03:03.600> can<00:03:03.750> have<00:03:03.900> these<00:03:04.050> points<00:03:04.320> over<00:03:04.530> here<00:03:04.560> and

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
you can have these points over here and

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.940 
you can have these points over here and
right<00:03:05.640> here<00:03:05.720> the<00:03:06.720> perpendicular<00:03:07.410> bisectors

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
right here the perpendicular bisectors

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.860 
right here the perpendicular bisectors
of<00:03:07.980> the<00:03:08.220> cords<00:03:08.610> will<00:03:08.850> intersect<00:03:09.420> at<00:03:09.690> the

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
of the cords will intersect at the

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.410 
of the cords will intersect at the
center<00:03:10.200> of<00:03:10.350> the<00:03:10.500> circle<00:03:10.890> and<00:03:11.150> then<00:03:12.150> you<00:03:12.180> can

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
center of the circle and then you can

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.660 
center of the circle and then you can
measure<00:03:12.630> the<00:03:13.410> distance<00:03:13.440> between<00:03:13.980> the<00:03:14.340> center

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
measure the distance between the center

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.670 
measure the distance between the center
of<00:03:14.790> the<00:03:14.910> circle<00:03:15.120> to<00:03:15.480> the<00:03:15.810> intersection<00:03:16.290> so<00:03:16.590> you

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
of the circle to the intersection so you

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.140 
of the circle to the intersection so you
can<00:03:16.800> actually<00:03:16.920> measure<00:03:17.220> the<00:03:17.490> radius<00:03:17.850> and

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
can actually measure the radius and

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.660 
can actually measure the radius and
that's<00:03:21.150> all<00:03:21.300> you<00:03:21.390> need<00:03:21.510> to<00:03:21.570> know
