the water hitting the gear spinning it

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:02.640 
the water hitting the gear spinning it
goes<00:02:01.780> back<00:02:01.990> and<00:02:02.170> forth<00:02:02.229> that's<00:02:02.409> what<00:02:02.590> they

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:02.650 
goes back and forth that's what they

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:04.170 
goes back and forth that's what they
call<00:02:02.830> it<00:02:02.860> a<00:02:03.010> vibe<00:02:03.189> racks<00:02:03.490> interesting<00:02:04.090> because

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
call it a vibe racks interesting because

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.000 
call it a vibe racks interesting because
they<00:02:04.360> claim<00:02:04.630> that<00:02:04.659> in<00:02:04.990> addition<00:02:05.260> to<00:02:05.500> the<00:02:05.770> blade

I<00:02:14.349> don't<00:02:14.950> know<00:02:15.010> if<00:02:15.069> that's<00:02:15.250> true<00:02:15.340> or<00:02:15.489> not<00:02:15.640> but<00:02:16.000> I

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
I don't know if that's true or not but I

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.350 
I don't know if that's true or not but I
know<00:02:16.599> it<00:02:16.870> works<00:02:17.110> so<00:02:17.890> in<00:02:18.129> this<00:02:18.549> size<00:02:18.849> for<00:02:19.330> the

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
know it works so in this size for the

know it works so in this size for the

the number one has such a small blade
that<00:02:25.959> a<00:02:26.019> lot<00:02:26.230> of<00:02:26.349> times<00:02:26.590> you<00:02:27.040> have<00:02:27.159> to<00:02:27.189> snap

that a lot of times you have to snap

the number three they probably hit

more from 2 to let's say five or seven
rounds<00:02:41.050> but<00:02:41.800> this<00:02:42.010> is<00:02:42.160> perfect<00:02:42.610> and<00:02:42.790> a<00:02:43.570> lot<00:02:43.720> of

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
rounds but this is perfect and a lot of

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.690 
rounds but this is perfect and a lot of
anglers<00:02:44.290> don't<00:02:44.860> realize<00:02:45.220> that<00:02:45.430> it's<00:02:45.550> very

anglers don't realize that it's very

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.520 
anglers don't realize that it's very
important<00:02:46.090> how<00:02:46.180> deep<00:02:46.390> the<00:02:46.570> spinner<00:02:46.870> goals<00:02:47.170> no

important how deep the spinner goals no

important how deep the spinner goals no
earlier<00:02:47.800> we<00:02:47.950> were<00:02:48.040> watching<00:02:48.190> the<00:02:48.490> fish

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
earlier we were watching the fish

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.090 
earlier we were watching the fish
chasing<00:02:49.060> the<00:02:49.150> spinner<00:02:49.420> yeah<00:02:49.660> and<00:02:49.950> we<00:02:50.950> could

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
chasing the spinner yeah and we could

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.020 
chasing the spinner yeah and we could
see<00:02:51.130> them<00:02:51.280> come<00:02:51.430> right<00:02:51.550> up<00:02:51.610> to<00:02:51.700> the<00:02:51.790> shore

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
see them come right up to the shore

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.610 
see them come right up to the shore
because<00:02:52.390> you<00:02:52.570> were<00:02:52.690> fishing<00:02:52.870> it<00:02:53.110> pretty<00:02:53.320> slow

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
because you were fishing it pretty slow

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.340 
because you were fishing it pretty slow
and<00:02:54.180> here<00:02:55.180> because<00:02:55.480> their<00:02:55.630> rainbows<00:02:56.050> and

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
and here because their rainbows and

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:57.810 
and here because their rainbows and
they're<00:02:56.920> trying<00:02:57.130> to<00:02:57.160> probably<00:02:57.430> stay<00:02:57.640> down

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
they're trying to probably stay down

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.010 
they're trying to probably stay down
where<00:02:57.970> the<00:02:58.030> water<00:02:58.240> is<00:02:58.330> a<00:02:58.450> little<00:02:58.660> cooler

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
where the water is a little cooler

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.140 
where the water is a little cooler
that's<00:02:59.680> why<00:02:59.830> you<00:02:59.890> got<00:03:00.070> them<00:03:00.160> to<00:03:00.250> follow<00:03:00.490> if<00:03:00.940> you

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
that's why you got them to follow if you

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.420 
that's why you got them to follow if you
were<00:03:01.300> to<00:03:01.570> burn<00:03:02.380> the<00:03:02.650> spinner<00:03:02.980> along<00:03:03.280> the

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
were to burn the spinner along the

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:04.980 
were to burn the spinner along the
surface<00:03:03.640> you<00:03:04.030> probably<00:03:04.390> wouldn't<00:03:04.630> even<00:03:04.690> get<00:03:04.960> a

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:04.990 
surface you probably wouldn't even get a

surface you probably wouldn't even get a
hit<00:03:05.230> exactly<00:03:05.770> because<00:03:05.860> you<00:03:06.310> know<00:03:06.430> it's<00:03:06.700> not<00:03:06.880> in

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
hit exactly because you know it's not in

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.270 
hit exactly because you know it's not in
front<00:03:07.180> of<00:03:07.300> them<00:03:07.390> so<00:03:08.020> it's<00:03:08.440> a<00:03:08.530> really<00:03:08.710> versatile

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:19.820 
over five pounds I'd have no problem

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.480 
over five pounds I'd have no problem
landing<00:05:20.690> it<00:05:20.840> now<00:05:21.440> this<00:05:21.710> area<00:05:22.010> that<00:05:22.040> I'm<00:05:22.220> at

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.490 
landing it now this area that I'm at

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:25.690 
landing it now this area that I'm at
right<00:05:22.550> now<00:05:23.030> it's<00:05:23.630> too<00:05:24.050> thick<00:05:24.320> to<00:05:24.350> fly<00:05:24.680> fish<00:05:25.010> but

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:25.700 
right now it's too thick to fly fish but

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.820 
right now it's too thick to fly fish but
we<00:05:25.850> have<00:05:26.060> fish<00:05:26.300> stretches<00:05:26.870> that<00:05:27.470> are<00:05:27.650> much

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:27.830 
we have fish stretches that are much

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:29.530 
we have fish stretches that are much
more<00:05:28.040> open<00:05:28.100> in<00:05:28.490> reservoirs<00:05:29.030> where<00:05:29.270> you<00:05:29.360> can

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:29.540 
more open in reservoirs where you can

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:31.780 
more open in reservoirs where you can
fly<00:05:29.780> fish<00:05:30.140> so<00:05:30.650> this<00:05:30.830> is<00:05:31.010> an<00:05:31.130> eight<00:05:31.310> weight<00:05:31.550> fly

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:31.790 
fly fish so this is an eight weight fly

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:34.030 
fly fish so this is an eight weight fly
rod<00:05:32.090> and<00:05:32.390> it's<00:05:32.690> loaded<00:05:32.960> with<00:05:33.140> a<00:05:33.320> weighted

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:34.040

forward<00:05:34.610> floating<00:05:35.060> fly<00:05:35.480> line<00:05:35.780> of<00:05:35.960> the<00:05:36.080> same

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:36.290 
forward floating fly line of the same

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:38.320 
forward floating fly line of the same
weight<00:05:36.530> and<00:05:36.950> the<00:05:37.310> nice<00:05:37.430> thing<00:05:37.640> about<00:05:37.700> this<00:05:38.030> rod

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:38.330 
weight and the nice thing about this rod

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.140 
weight and the nice thing about this rod
even<00:05:39.140> though<00:05:39.320> it's<00:05:39.530> 10<00:05:39.830> feet<00:05:39.860> long<00:05:40.100> it's<00:05:40.669> also

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.150 
even though it's 10 feet long it's also

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:43.150 
even though it's 10 feet long it's also
a<00:05:41.390> four<00:05:41.720> piece<00:05:42.020> so<00:05:42.470> I<00:05:42.530> won't<00:05:42.710> take<00:05:42.890> the<00:05:43.010> whole

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:43.160 
a four piece so I won't take the whole

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.430 
a four piece so I won't take the whole
thing<00:05:43.370> apart<00:05:43.520> but<00:05:44.510> there's<00:05:44.900> the<00:05:45.080> two<00:05:45.260> lower

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:45.440 
thing apart but there's the two lower

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.440 
thing apart but there's the two lower
sections<00:05:46.039> and<00:05:46.250> that's<00:05:46.520> two<00:05:46.700> sections<00:05:47.180> for<00:05:47.360> the

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:47.450 
sections and that's two sections for the

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:48.519 
sections and that's two sections for the
top<00:05:47.690> so

00:05:48.519 --> 00:05:48.529

made by rapala very famous newer company

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.469 
made by rapala very famous newer company
so<00:06:48.770> the<00:06:48.949> reason<00:06:49.100> this<00:06:49.370> lure<00:06:49.669> works<00:06:50.000> well<00:06:50.270> is

00:06:50.469 --> 00:06:50.479 
so the reason this lure works well is

00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:53.050 
so the reason this lure works well is
big<00:06:50.630> it's<00:06:50.840> neutral<00:06:51.380> buoyancy<00:06:51.850> that<00:06:52.850> means

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:53.060 
big it's neutral buoyancy that means

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:54.790 
big it's neutral buoyancy that means
that<00:06:53.389> when<00:06:53.539> this<00:06:53.660> lure<00:06:53.870> hits<00:06:54.139> the<00:06:54.289> water<00:06:54.470> and

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:54.800 
that when this lure hits the water and

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.279 
that when this lure hits the water and
you<00:06:55.280> retrieve<00:06:55.639> it<00:06:55.910> it<00:06:56.030> dives<00:06:56.270> down<00:06:56.600> to<00:06:56.810> about<00:06:56.990> 5

00:06:57.279 --> 00:06:57.289 
you retrieve it it dives down to about 5

00:06:57.289 --> 00:06:59.260 
you retrieve it it dives down to about 5
feet<00:06:57.590> and<00:06:57.770> when<00:06:57.889> you<00:06:58.010> stop<00:06:58.370> it<00:06:58.669> stays<00:06:58.970> there

00:06:59.260 --> 00:06:59.270 
feet and when you stop it stays there

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:01.779 
feet and when you stop it stays there
that<00:06:59.870> means<00:07:00.080> suspense<00:07:00.590> so<00:07:01.160> it<00:07:01.250> doesn't<00:07:01.580> float
