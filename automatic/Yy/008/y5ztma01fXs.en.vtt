00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.330
 to see the very powerful offensive entrepreneurs 

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:10.020
 we want it to be a game of many points because the pumas defense 

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.119
 I can have the decision 

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:14.279
 the celestial 

00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:17.279
 I could not tell you exactly 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.110
 last year we had two two games one very even offered to its intensity 

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:26.909
 and another very disparate with a defensive zone 

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:30.369
 but I think in my opinion the point of being necessary to see a lot together 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:33.369
 all trades as events are very explosive 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.110
 cayetana much fashion 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.300
 and I think that they happen there 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.720
 I could have some concern about your defenses that they were 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.880
 Arrested to Roberto Vega already on Saturday and his tigers bonus concern 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.120
 bullock was worried because I'm sure that the defense of his 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.240
 scepter 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.030
 and this yavuz been there these points happens 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.470
 vulnerable not from October 8 in CÃ³rdoba 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:02.890
 born in chile I believe I trust in my defense and with my colleagues 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.100
 this year will be one of the most important games of the race 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.760
 probably if she wanted 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.400
 with rivalry no contingencies in favor of our popular music as you look 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.520
 as you look for example the sacrifice of yesterday do not disclose asks not to go to the 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.490
 party so did everyone 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.630
 this is the first degree 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.220
 since 2000 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.540
 his death 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.820
 not only should they be followed if we want to get there 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.630
 that is why the pnv makes its call to the people to go to the stadium cream 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.700
 Those who are going to see them continue to support new concessions of FCC 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.180
 in this one all in vacations are a group of the federal deputation 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.700
 I simply say because you are already doing as in that unexplainable what 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.070
 is saying that the key says that the pumas defense that has the 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.040
 tigers offensive press this 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.620
 next 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.920
 despite having the others
