00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
idea and sort of changing around it's

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.319 
idea and sort of changing around it's
not<00:00:34.469> going<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:34.710> really<00:00:35.370> look<00:00:35.610> like<00:00:35.670> her<00:00:35.910> cat

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
easy access i have a straightener in my

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.900 
easy access i have a straightener in my
room<00:02:50.220> and<00:02:50.430> it's<00:02:51.330> just<00:02:51.690> this<00:02:52.520> type<00:02:53.520> of<00:02:53.550> strainer

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.240 
room and it's just this type of strainer
it's<00:02:54.660> like<00:02:54.870> the<00:02:55.020> wide<00:02:55.230> one<00:02:55.500> because<00:02:55.800> i<00:02:56.070> have

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
it's like the wide one because i have

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.280 
it's like the wide one because i have
because<00:02:57.000> you<00:02:57.150> know<00:02:57.330> seen<00:02:57.600> I've<00:02:57.810> really<00:02:58.110> long

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
because you know seen I've really long

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.710 
because you know seen I've really long
hair<00:02:58.560> and<00:02:58.590> it's<00:02:58.890> easier<00:02:59.160> to<00:02:59.280> get<00:02:59.370> more<00:03:00.300> chunks

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
hair and it's easier to get more chunks

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.410 
hair and it's easier to get more chunks
of<00:03:00.840> hair<00:03:01.410> in<00:03:01.800> here<00:03:02.220> but<00:03:02.850> anyways<00:03:03.090> i'm<00:03:03.210> going<00:03:03.330> to

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
of hair in here but anyways i'm going to

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.290 
of hair in here but anyways i'm going to
use<00:03:03.510> straightener<00:03:04.280> for<00:03:05.280> this<00:03:05.580> and<00:03:05.850> you<00:03:06.150> have

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
use straightener for this and you have

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.910 
use straightener for this and you have
you<00:03:06.450> like<00:03:06.600> why<00:03:06.989> are<00:03:07.050> you<00:03:07.170> a<00:03:07.410> straightener

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
you like why are you a straightener

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.420 
you like why are you a straightener
around<00:03:08.130> iron<00:03:08.690> well<00:03:09.690> one<00:03:10.680> it<00:03:10.950> has<00:03:11.100> the<00:03:11.220> same

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
around iron well one it has the same

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.729 
around iron well one it has the same
type<00:03:11.700> of<00:03:11.730> plating<00:03:12.390> it<00:03:12.900> can<00:03:13.200> get<00:03:13.320> heated<00:03:13.620> up

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
type of plating it can get heated up

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.670 
type of plating it can get heated up
quickly<00:03:14.220> and<00:03:14.610> it's<00:03:15.510> i<00:03:15.870> don't<00:03:16.380> want<00:03:16.500> to<00:03:16.560> get

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
quickly and it's i don't want to get

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.380 
quickly and it's i don't want to get
safer<00:03:17.160> than<00:03:17.280> an<00:03:17.430> iron<00:03:17.640> and<00:03:18.000> you<00:03:18.090> might<00:03:18.239> think

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
safer than an iron and you might think

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:19.970 
safer than an iron and you might think
there's<00:03:18.600> like<00:03:18.660> we're<00:03:19.020> but<00:03:19.230> i<00:03:19.290> actually<00:03:19.470> tried

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
there's like we're but i actually tried

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.910 
there's like we're but i actually tried
it<00:03:20.100> um<00:03:20.489> i<00:03:21.330> use<00:03:21.600> a<00:03:21.630> little<00:03:21.840> fish<00:03:22.050> and<00:03:22.260> iron<00:03:22.650> i

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
it um i use a little fish and iron i

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.330 
it um i use a little fish and iron i
mean<00:03:23.160> i<00:03:23.190> clamped<00:03:23.700> it<00:03:24.080> between<00:03:25.080> there<00:03:25.350> like<00:03:26.130> I

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
mean i clamped it between there like I

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.360 
mean i clamped it between there like I
was<00:03:26.459> like<00:03:26.780> and<00:03:27.780> I<00:03:27.840> held<00:03:28.110> it<00:03:28.290> the<00:03:28.709> directions

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
was like and I held it the directions

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:34.850 
was like and I held it the directions
say<00:03:29.510> hold<00:03:30.510> it<00:03:30.690> for<00:03:31.940> like<00:03:33.050> ten<00:03:34.050> to<00:03:34.080> fifteen

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
say hold it for like ten to fifteen

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.460 
say hold it for like ten to fifteen
seconds<00:03:35.520> out<00:03:35.880> there<00:03:36.120> for<00:03:36.300> 20<00:03:36.630> seconds<00:03:37.080> and<00:03:37.260> it

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
seconds out there for 20 seconds and it

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.360 
seconds out there for 20 seconds and it
ironed<00:03:37.890> on<00:03:38.010> really<00:03:38.340> nicely<00:03:38.660> so<00:03:39.660> um<00:03:40.370> basically

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
ironed on really nicely so um basically

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.030 
ironed on really nicely so um basically
yeah<00:03:42.300> just<00:03:42.630> put<00:03:42.840> your<00:03:42.870> straightener<00:03:43.709> on<00:03:43.860> to

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
yeah just put your straightener on to

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.550 
yeah just put your straightener on to
medium<00:03:44.370> or<00:03:44.550> however<00:03:44.840> how<00:03:45.840> you<00:03:45.900> think<00:03:46.200> like<00:03:46.410> an

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
medium or however how you think like an

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.729 
medium or however how you think like an
iron<00:03:46.769> equivalency<00:03:47.580> it's<00:03:48.239> sort<00:03:48.510> of<00:03:48.600> ghetto<00:03:48.810> but

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
iron equivalency it's sort of ghetto but

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:52.280 
iron equivalency it's sort of ghetto but
they<00:03:50.040> were<00:03:50.130> getting<00:03:50.310> super<00:03:50.910> do<00:03:51.780> it<00:03:51.900> yourself

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
they were getting super do it yourself

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:53.960 
they were getting super do it yourself
right<00:03:52.560> now<00:03:52.590> we're<00:03:53.040> going<00:03:53.280> all<00:03:53.400> the<00:03:53.430> way<00:03:53.700> guys

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
the collar and then we're going to use

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:12.949 
the collar and then we're going to use
the<00:04:06.090> ghetto<00:04:07.019> ironing<00:04:07.769> device<00:04:08.310> to<00:04:09.060> iron<00:04:09.840> it<00:04:09.959> on

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:15.600 

and<00:04:13.959> we're<00:04:14.319> going<00:04:14.440> to<00:04:14.470> hold<00:04:14.739> the<00:04:14.830> iron<00:04:15.010> on<00:04:15.220> for

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610 
and we're going to hold the iron on for

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:36.120 
and we're going to hold the iron on for
about<00:04:15.730> maybe<00:04:16.650> 20<00:04:17.650> seconds<00:04:18.370> to<00:04:18.579> 15<00:04:18.910> seconds<00:04:35.130> so

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
about maybe 20 seconds to 15 seconds so

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.190 
about maybe 20 seconds to 15 seconds so
now<00:04:37.000> you're<00:04:37.180> going<00:04:37.330> to<00:04:37.389> get<00:04:37.510> your<00:04:37.690> little<00:04:37.870> tiny
