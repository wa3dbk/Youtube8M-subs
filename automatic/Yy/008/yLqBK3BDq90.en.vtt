00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
was very nice to do that

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.319 
was very nice to do that
but<00:01:54.780> you<00:01:54.869> can<00:01:55.049> see<00:01:55.259> where<00:01:55.530> he<00:01:56.060> uses<00:01:57.060> this

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
but you can see where he uses this

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.670 
but you can see where he uses this
portion<00:01:58.079> here<00:01:58.350> you<00:01:59.189> know<00:01:59.369> to<00:01:59.430> to<00:02:00.119> cut<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:00.869> it's

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
portion here you know to to cut and it's

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.800 
portion here you know to to cut and it's
hollowed<00:02:02.040> out<00:02:02.159> in<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.490> center<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:03.240> it's<00:02:03.750> a

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
hollowed out in the center and it's a

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.749 
hollowed out in the center and it's a
high<00:02:03.990> polish<00:02:04.439> on<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.740> outside<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:05.610> that

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
high polish on the outside and that

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.719 
high polish on the outside and that
usually<00:02:06.000> gives<00:02:06.329> you<00:02:06.479> your<00:02:06.570> nice<00:02:06.810> gliding<00:02:07.729> feel

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
usually gives you your nice gliding feel

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.969 
usually gives you your nice gliding feel
over<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.360> wood<00:02:09.569> so<00:02:10.289> that's<00:02:10.500> how<00:02:10.679> that's

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
over the wood so that's how that's

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.410 
over the wood so that's how that's
worked<00:02:11.489> out<00:02:11.670> he's<00:02:11.940> also<00:02:12.360> created<00:02:12.870> one<00:02:13.080> of<00:02:13.200> the

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
worked out he's also created one of the

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.540 
worked out he's also created one of the
that<00:02:13.900> you<00:02:14.020> can<00:02:14.170> get<00:02:14.290> inside<00:02:14.800> the<00:02:14.860> shoe<00:02:15.310> after

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
that you can get inside the shoe after

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.750 
that you can get inside the shoe after
it's<00:02:15.849> made<00:02:16.120> and<00:02:16.450> clean<00:02:17.110> it<00:02:17.290> up<00:02:17.470> okay<00:02:17.760> and

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
it's made and clean it up okay and

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.240 
it's made and clean it up okay and
that's<00:02:18.940> what<00:02:19.180> that<00:02:19.390> that<00:02:19.840> particular<00:02:20.349> item<00:02:21.099> is

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
that's what that that particular item is

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.920 
that's what that that particular item is
for<00:02:21.580> so<00:02:21.760> he<00:02:21.910> sent<00:02:22.180> me<00:02:22.300> these<00:02:22.420> three<00:02:22.750> from

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
for so he sent me these three from

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.949 
for so he sent me these three from
Holland<00:02:23.380> and<00:02:23.760> one<00:02:24.760> of<00:02:24.880> you<00:02:25.030> have<00:02:25.180> a<00:02:25.300> couple

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
first video that you can't get those

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.220 
first video that you can't get those
anywhere<00:02:36.040> those<00:02:36.220> are<00:02:36.370> antiques<00:02:36.790> so<00:02:37.630> and<00:02:38.110> they

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
it I have a link on on the on this video

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.170 
it I have a link on on the on this video
for<00:03:10.569> it<00:03:10.690> and<00:03:10.900> be<00:03:11.680> sure<00:03:11.890> to<00:03:11.920> take<00:03:12.489> a<00:03:12.549> look<00:03:12.790> at<00:03:13.000> it

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:21.579 
he uses on his on his on his standing

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:24.330 
he uses on his on his on his standing
gear<00:03:22.390> there's<00:03:22.690> simply<00:03:23.590> something<00:03:23.859> something

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
gear there's simply something something

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.900 
gear there's simply something something
like<00:03:24.489> this<00:03:24.700> a<00:03:24.730> 400<00:03:25.390> grit<00:03:25.690> or<00:03:25.959> maybe<00:03:26.140> higher<00:03:26.500> of

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
like this a 400 grit or maybe higher of

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.759 
like this a 400 grit or maybe higher of
water<00:03:27.910> proof<00:03:28.420> like<00:03:28.989> this<00:03:29.230> is<00:03:29.380> water<00:03:29.650> proof

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
water proof like this is water proof

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:33.630 
water proof like this is water proof
paper<00:03:30.310> and<00:03:31.030> he<00:03:31.630> attaches<00:03:32.410> it<00:03:32.799> to<00:03:32.829> a<00:03:33.190> piece<00:03:33.609> of

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
paper and he attaches it to a piece of

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.780 
paper and he attaches it to a piece of
wood<00:03:34.510> so<00:03:35.290> that's<00:03:35.530> how<00:03:35.769> when<00:03:36.310> you're<00:03:36.549> looking

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
wood so that's how when you're looking

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.520 
wood so that's how when you're looking
at<00:03:36.940> the<00:03:37.090> video<00:03:37.359> and<00:03:37.420> you<00:03:37.570> see<00:03:37.870> something<00:03:38.500> that

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
at the video and you see something that

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.289 
at the video and you see something that
looks<00:03:38.769> like<00:03:38.829> a<00:03:38.950> strop<00:03:39.400> that<00:03:39.670> he's<00:03:39.790> sharpening

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:40.299 
looks like a strop that he's sharpening

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:42.660 
looks like a strop that he's sharpening
stuff<00:03:40.720> on<00:03:40.900> this<00:03:41.049> is<00:03:41.170> what<00:03:41.350> he's<00:03:41.530> using<00:03:41.799> okay

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
stuff on this is what he's using okay

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.420
