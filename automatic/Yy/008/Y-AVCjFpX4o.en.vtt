00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
with kill streaks and I know that didn't

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.670 
with kill streaks and I know that didn't
really<00:02:11.610> count<00:02:11.790> in<00:02:12.060> model<00:02:12.569> for<00:02:12.720> 3<00:02:12.959> be

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
really count in model for 3 be

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.470 
really count in model for 3 be
because<00:02:13.859> it<00:02:14.609> didn't<00:02:14.849> count<00:02:14.939> towards<00:02:15.239> the<00:02:15.299> mall

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
dustbin and the other side which I only

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.280 
dustbin and the other side which I only
just<00:02:31.950> figured<00:02:32.159> out<00:02:32.370> and<00:02:32.959> obviously<00:02:33.959> there's

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
just figured out and obviously there's

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
and that is 11 only negative point I can

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.089 
and that is 11 only negative point I can
really<00:02:44.519> make<00:02:44.700> of<00:02:44.849> a<00:02:44.909> black<00:02:45.090> ops<00:02:45.299> 2<00:02:45.480> so<00:02:45.780> far<00:02:46.099> but

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
OT I think we're losing here and but

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:00.379 
OT I think we're losing here and but
they've<00:03:58.829> got<00:03:58.979> a<00:03:59.009> really<00:03:59.159> good<00:03:59.370> spot<00:03:59.669> to<00:03:59.939> hide

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:00.389 
they've got a really good spot to hide

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:02.059 
they've got a really good spot to hide
behind<00:04:00.599> the<00:04:00.930> car<00:04:01.169> they<00:04:01.470> can<00:04:01.590> entertain<00:04:01.829> to

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:02.069 
behind the car they can entertain to

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:03.439 
behind the car they can entertain to
either<00:04:02.189> car<00:04:02.489> and<00:04:02.639> assayed<00:04:02.970> so<00:04:03.209> it's<00:04:03.329> really

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:03.449 
either car and assayed so it's really

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:05.920 
either car and assayed so it's really
the<00:04:03.900> spot<00:04:04.169> isn't<00:04:04.349> really<00:04:04.650> hugely<00:04:04.979> amazing<00:04:05.430> and

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
the spot isn't really hugely amazing and

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.379 
the spot isn't really hugely amazing and
