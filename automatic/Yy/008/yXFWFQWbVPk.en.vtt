live<00:00:05.470> fish<00:00:05.890> food<00:00:06.160> really<00:00:06.819> really<00:00:07.089> easy<00:00:07.299> to

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:07.540 
live fish food really really easy to

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.460 
live fish food really really easy to
keep<00:00:07.720> and<00:00:07.990> they<00:00:08.860> reproduce<00:00:09.100> fairly<00:00:09.670> quickly

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:10.470 
keep and they reproduce fairly quickly

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
keep and they reproduce fairly quickly
they're<00:00:11.470> also<00:00:11.650> a<00:00:11.800> great<00:00:11.980> way<00:00:12.100> to<00:00:12.250> deal<00:00:12.460> with

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:12.490 
they're also a great way to deal with

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.190 
they're also a great way to deal with
green<00:00:13.000> water<00:00:13.240> if<00:00:13.510> you<00:00:13.780> have<00:00:13.810> issues<00:00:14.320> with<00:00:14.440> that

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:16.200 
green water if you have issues with that

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.420 
green water if you have issues with that
you<00:00:17.200> can<00:00:17.350> probably<00:00:17.530> find<00:00:17.740> them<00:00:17.890> in<00:00:18.010> a<00:00:18.040> local

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:18.430 
you can probably find them in a local

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.370 
you can probably find them in a local
park<00:00:19.300> or<00:00:19.620> footpath<00:00:20.650> you<00:00:20.950> just<00:00:21.160> need<00:00:21.280> to<00:00:21.400> find

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
park or footpath you just need to find

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.460 
park or footpath you just need to find
like<00:00:23.380> a<00:00:23.440> still<00:00:23.890> body<00:00:24.760> of<00:00:25.090> water<00:00:25.750> not<00:00:26.230> like<00:00:26.440> a

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:26.470 
like a still body of water not like a

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.830 
like a still body of water not like a
link<00:00:26.800> but<00:00:26.980> like<00:00:27.130> a<00:00:27.160> small<00:00:27.780> pond<00:00:28.780> or<00:00:29.279> large<00:00:30.279> size

link but like a small pond or large size

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.479 
link but like a small pond or large size
you<00:00:31.840> know<00:00:31.960> how<00:00:32.289> to<00:00:32.349> look<00:00:32.529> good<00:00:32.589> like<00:00:32.920> 6<00:00:33.190> to<00:00:33.339> 10

00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:33.489 
you know how to look good like 6 to 10

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:34.799 
you know how to look good like 6 to 10
inches<00:00:33.760> deep<00:00:33.819> that's<00:00:34.210> been<00:00:34.420> there<00:00:34.569> for<00:00:34.600> a

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:34.809 
inches deep that's been there for a

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:55.860 
inches deep that's been there for a
while<00:00:38.219> sure<00:00:39.219> they<00:00:39.489> look<00:00:39.640> like

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.450 

so<00:00:56.380> I<00:00:56.410> just<00:00:56.620> happened<00:00:56.800> to<00:00:57.010> have<00:00:57.130> an<00:00:57.280> arrow

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460 
so I just happened to have an arrow

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.330 
so I just happened to have an arrow
garden<00:00:58.170> which<00:00:59.170> has<00:00:59.350> an<00:00:59.470> air<00:00:59.590> pump<00:00:59.770> in<00:01:00.010> it<00:01:00.040> so

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:00.340 
garden which has an air pump in it so

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:01.880 
garden which has an air pump in it so
I'm<00:01:00.460> running<00:01:00.580> an<00:01:00.820> air<00:01:00.970> line<00:01:01.120> on<00:01:01.330> these<00:01:01.600> two

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
I'm running an air line on these two

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.200 
I'm running an air line on these two
containers<00:01:02.890> and<00:01:03.310> not<00:01:03.460> on<00:01:03.580> that<00:01:03.760> container

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.400 

these<00:01:07.210> two<00:01:07.450> containers<00:01:07.780> I've<00:01:08.110> just<00:01:08.290> been

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:08.410 
these two containers I've just been

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:11.670 
these two containers I've just been
feeding<00:01:08.800> them<00:01:08.920> green<00:01:09.550> water<00:01:09.790> so<00:01:10.300> I<00:01:10.810> just

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
feeding them green water so I just

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.180 
feeding them green water so I just
chucked<00:01:11.920> some<00:01:12.900> lettuce<00:01:13.900> in<00:01:14.200> old<00:01:14.619> tank<00:01:14.950> water

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.190 
chucked some lettuce in old tank water

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:16.770 
chucked some lettuce in old tank water
and<00:01:15.400> I<00:01:15.460> leave<00:01:15.640> it<00:01:15.760> out<00:01:15.850> in<00:01:15.970> the<00:01:16.000> Sun<00:01:16.300> or<00:01:16.540> I'll

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
and I leave it out in the Sun or I'll

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:17.880 
and I leave it out in the Sun or I'll
actually<00:01:16.960> put<00:01:17.260> it<00:01:17.350> under<00:01:17.500> this<00:01:17.650> light

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
actually put it under this light

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.950 
actually put it under this light
sometimes<00:01:18.400> -<00:01:18.700> that's<00:01:19.510> what<00:01:19.660> I'm<00:01:19.750> feeding

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
sometimes - that's what I'm feeding

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.969 
sometimes - that's what I'm feeding
these<00:01:20.170> guys<00:01:21.540> I'm<00:01:22.540> experimenting<00:01:22.960> with<00:01:23.770> this

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:23.979 
these guys I'm experimenting with this

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:25.890 
these guys I'm experimenting with this
one<00:01:24.220> there<00:01:24.610> I<00:01:24.910> did<00:01:25.210> feed<00:01:25.420> them<00:01:25.540> a<00:01:25.600> little<00:01:25.780> bit

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:25.900 
one there I did feed them a little bit

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.180 
one there I did feed them a little bit
of<00:01:25.990> green<00:01:26.140> water<00:01:26.290> to<00:01:26.470> get<00:01:26.590> them<00:01:26.740> going<00:01:26.890> and

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.190 
of green water to get them going and

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:28.710 
of green water to get them going and
some<00:01:27.550> of<00:01:27.610> the<00:01:27.670> plant<00:01:27.910> matter<00:01:28.090> cell<00:01:28.420> to<00:01:28.630> the

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 
some of the plant matter cell to the

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.380 
some of the plant matter cell to the
bottom<00:01:29.050> but<00:01:29.259> I<00:01:29.680> put<00:01:30.430> a<00:01:30.460> couple<00:01:30.670> pieces<00:01:30.910> of<00:01:31.090> cat

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
bottom but I put a couple pieces of cat

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.130 
bottom but I put a couple pieces of cat
food<00:01:31.660> in<00:01:31.990> a<00:01:32.050> jar<00:01:32.410> in<00:01:32.440> some<00:01:32.830> tank<00:01:33.070> water<00:01:33.340> it's

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
food in a jar in some tank water it's

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.139 
food in a jar in some tank water it's
hanging<00:01:35.140> out<00:01:35.350> under<00:01:35.649> the<00:01:35.740> sink<00:01:36.009> it<00:01:36.880> went

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:37.149 
hanging out under the sink it went

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:39.150 
hanging out under the sink it went
really<00:01:38.050> really<00:01:38.170> really<00:01:38.530> cloudy<00:01:38.920> because

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.160 
really really really cloudy because

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.560 
really really really cloudy because
apparently<00:01:39.580> these<00:01:39.729> guys<00:01:39.790> feed<00:01:40.210> on<00:01:40.360> bacteria

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 
apparently these guys feed on bacteria

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.950 
apparently these guys feed on bacteria
as<00:01:41.170> well<00:01:41.200> so<00:01:42.070> I'm<00:01:42.450> trying<00:01:43.450> feeding<00:01:43.840> this

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
as well so I'm trying feeding this

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.560 
as well so I'm trying feeding this
culture<00:01:44.350> on<00:01:44.530> just<00:01:45.280> bacteria<00:01:45.820> and<00:01:45.970> it<00:01:46.270> seems<00:01:46.509> to

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
culture on just bacteria and it seems to

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.200 
culture on just bacteria and it seems to
be<00:01:46.660> doing<00:01:46.960> okay<00:01:47.440> so<00:01:47.850> that<00:01:48.850> would<00:01:48.940> be<00:01:49.030> a<00:01:49.060> good

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
be doing okay so that would be a good

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.029 
be doing okay so that would be a good
solution<00:01:49.390> for<00:01:49.660> the<00:01:49.869> winter<00:01:50.140> months<00:01:50.289> when<00:01:50.590> I

00:01:51.029 --> 00:01:51.039 
solution for the winter months when I

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:56.550 
solution for the winter months when I
don't<00:01:51.430> get<00:01:51.550> much<00:01:51.670> Sun<00:01:54.690> it's<00:01:55.690> my<00:01:55.840> Daphnia<00:01:56.320> oh

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
don't get much Sun it's my Daphnia oh

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.639 
don't get much Sun it's my Daphnia oh
and<00:01:57.369> I<00:01:57.520> use<00:01:57.670> a<00:01:57.720> small<00:01:58.720> piece<00:01:58.869> of<00:01:58.930> air<00:01:59.200> line<00:01:59.410> and

00:01:59.639 --> 00:01:59.649 
and I use a small piece of air line and

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:02.309 
and I use a small piece of air line and
a<00:02:00.340> shot<00:02:00.550> glass<00:02:00.729> just<00:02:01.090> to<00:02:01.179> cycling<00:02:01.990> about<00:02:02.170> to

00:02:02.309 --> 00:02:02.319 
a shot glass just to cycling about to

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:06.119 
a shot glass just to cycling about to
feed<00:02:02.440> them<00:02:02.590> to<00:02:02.619> the<00:02:02.800> fish<00:02:03.009> super<00:02:04.000> easy
