00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.920 
very easily where I live in Northern
California<00:00:32.130> for<00:00:32.759> some<00:00:32.880> reason<00:00:33.210> and<00:00:33.540> I<00:00:33.870> don't

how to cut the sleeves other than just
cut<00:01:45.280> them<00:01:45.400> off<00:01:45.520> but<00:01:46.090> what<00:01:46.210> I<00:01:46.240> do<00:01:46.360> recommend<00:01:46.630> is

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
cut them off but what I do recommend is

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.550 
cut them off but what I do recommend is
basically<00:01:48.040> taking<00:01:48.490> these<00:01:48.640> sleeves<00:01:48.970> and

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
basically taking these sleeves and

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.020 
basically taking these sleeves and
leaving<00:01:50.560> a<00:01:50.680> little<00:01:50.979> excess<00:01:51.430> fabric<00:01:51.670> on<00:01:51.940> the
