00:00:05.101 --> 00:00:08.585
 Bonjour, Welcome to Paris at the Lancôme makeup studio. 

00:00:08.705 --> 00:00:12.170
 I am happy to show you a makeup revolution today. 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:15.274
 I would like to introduce you to Miracle Cushion. 

00:00:15.394 --> 00:00:18.818
 And this is without a doubt a true innovation in foundation 

00:00:18.938 --> 00:00:21.722
 Granted, when I first saw it, I thought it looked exactly the same 

00:00:21.842 --> 00:00:24.383
 looked like an ordinary compact foundation 

00:00:24.503 --> 00:00:25.579
 However, 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:27.837
 when you open it, 

00:00:28.374 --> 00:00:31.627
 it actually contains a liquid foundation 

00:00:31.747 --> 00:00:36.004
 That is delivered via this unique Cushion hence the name 

00:00:36.124 --> 00:00:39.740
 Before we start, I already applied primer to prepare my skin. 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.707
 Now I use the applicator pad 

00:00:41.827 --> 00:00:44.838
 specially designed for this formula 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.127
 So, just press it on the Pillow a few times 

00:00:48.247 --> 00:00:50.661
 and then apply directly to your skin 

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:54.443
 I prefer to start from the center of my face 

00:00:54.787 --> 00:00:56.024
 outside 

00:00:59.201 --> 00:01:01.674
 It gives a nice natural-looking application. 

00:01:01.794 --> 00:01:04.291
 One of the first things you will notice 

00:01:04.411 --> 00:01:07.330
 is how refreshing and hydrating it feels on the skin 

00:01:08.978 --> 00:01:12.840
 And just because it is so buildable, if there is a piece of skin where you worry 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.515
 round, dip in the Pillow again and apply a little extra locally. 

00:01:16.635 --> 00:01:17.793
 So for me 

00:01:17.913 --> 00:01:20.388
 for example, I bring around my chin, 

00:01:20.508 --> 00:01:23.219
 on the sides of my nose and around my mouth 

00:01:23.688 --> 00:01:25.563
 please add some extra coverage 

00:01:29.422 --> 00:01:32.211
 Everywhere else I like to apply a subtle layer 

00:01:32.331 --> 00:01:34.621
 So, I just work it in and it just as smoothly 

00:01:34.741 --> 00:01:38.833
 It really has a very covering effect on the skin 

00:01:40.684 --> 00:01:44.018
 And it also refines the pores, I love it! 

00:01:46.087 --> 00:01:49.563
 One of the things that I find really useful is how portable it is 

00:01:49.683 --> 00:01:53.742
 If you want to retouch during lunch or before you go out in the evening 

00:01:53.862 --> 00:01:57.096
 It is really very easy to take the Compact with you 

00:01:57.216 --> 00:01:59.820
 and quickly update your makeup where needed 

00:02:00.063 --> 00:02:01.836
 I think this is usually very difficult 

00:02:01.956 --> 00:02:04.340
 with a bottle of liquid foundation in your handbag 

00:02:04.543 --> 00:02:07.401
 This makes it much, much easier. 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:11.012
 If you want subtle local coverage 

00:02:11.132 --> 00:02:15.319
 I think it is useful to simply fold the applicator in half 

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:19.287
 and to use those for those hard-to-reach places. 

00:02:19.627 --> 00:02:22.040
 So on the sides of your nose, under your nose, 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.968
 at the edges of your face and under your eyes. 

00:02:26.295 --> 00:02:28.692
 And if you think you need extra coverage, 

00:02:28.812 --> 00:02:31.302
 Then use your concealer on top. 

00:02:32.001 --> 00:02:34.221
 For example, around your eyes 

00:02:35.132 --> 00:02:39.540
 This will easily mix with your Cushion 

00:02:42.636 --> 00:02:45.494
 The pillow has a fresh and velvety finish, 

00:02:45.614 --> 00:02:48.810
 so if you have oily to mixed skin like me 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.938
 can use your powder if you want 

00:02:51.058 --> 00:02:54.183
 So to finish my makeup, I first bring to 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.129
 some black mascara, 

00:03:00.124 --> 00:03:01.654
 a touch of blush 

00:03:08.249 --> 00:03:09.557
 and Lip Lover 

00:03:17.694 --> 00:03:22.113
 This is it, a quick effortless look thanks to the Miracle Cushion foundation 

00:03:22.233 --> 00:03:23.992
 Let me know how you are doing 

00:03:24.112 --> 00:03:27.427
 and you'll soon see me again in the Lancôme makeup studio 

00:03:27.661 --> 00:03:28.826
 Bye!
