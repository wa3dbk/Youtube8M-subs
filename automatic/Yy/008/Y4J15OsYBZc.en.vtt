00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:10.019
 the model is a project that I rode the 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.570
 side of the jungle with the 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.190
 goal of being able to express 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.410
 the way we really wanted to 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:20.820
 about video games none I usually say 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.570
 which is a game site more focused on 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.510
 people 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.010
 We understand that game is culture and 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.180
 they are also made by people and it is 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.609
 That's why we talk to the 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.009
 people who make their games undo a 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.079
 little segregation cab Sundays 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.660
 we do not wanna be a ball club 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:40.230
 who does not want to be the game we want 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.360
 the game is seen as a consumption for 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.149
 everyone as a cultural product 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.070
 access for everyone 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.230
 there the question of the voice we make question 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.760
 that everything we create have a 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.260
 voice 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.270
 Initially the idea was that our 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.070
 three balls but in fact is that with the 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.629
 time passed other people liked 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.100
 of the project began to appear there 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.510
 I would also like to have a voice as well 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.399
 So we have, for example, today in 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.049
 day one thousand lopes fifa producer who 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.540
 has a weekly column in which it expresses 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.130
 certain ideas about likes to leave 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.200
 of the role of rony games among several 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.479
 developers journalists and others 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.070
 personalities talk about games that 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.140
 marked the players in some way 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.540
 So cool to see if everyone can 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.220
 express himself in some way and he 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.710
 ends up having this human element that I 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.310
 I think it's the great differential of our 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.310
 job 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.729
 there may be better quality 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.650
 with the games site is able to have at least 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:34.330
 less in brazil these days people 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.520
 close to us we will 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.290
 literally bar to kbb sit and 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.780
 talk about not only what people 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.580
 produces more survival games and is a 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.690
 something that we are very proud of in 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.310
 Do you really know why? 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.780
 I think a few game sites 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.460
 have managed to do this work so 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:53.190
 human being so warm that people 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.190
 managed to do during the last years 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:59.080
 the velodrome it never was and never will be 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.970
 A hobby we gave up on all the 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.100
 our jobs lt to us to do this 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.780
 it is our main job and our 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.509
 Main activity 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.009
 I even got the idea of velodrome one 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:10.690
 when I realized that I did not 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.860
 I could go anywhere he 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.709
 do the work I like to do 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.569
 it was precisely this work with a 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:18.880
 footprint and social but cultural but 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:20.530
 more artistic behavior with us 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.080
 complete it with the necessary seriousness 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.790
 so that it becomes what we people 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.480
 I mean that is the best team in the 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.430
 Brazil 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.350
 we get rid of the restrictions that 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.690
 vehicles had a series of 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:34.209
 large portal factors with their 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.489
 needs of clicks visibility 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.140
 size and reach more often at the 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:39.400
 quality of the content itself 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.470
 we were no longer interested in 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.329
 nowadays we see that the value is 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.980
 unique in that it does in tackling 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:47.049
 again the social and 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.180
 cultural aspects of a media that today 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:50.690
 still treated as if it were only one 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.459
 and not consumption 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.110
 cultural product, there is much more to 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:58.110
 behind this the cultural expression 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.510
 expression artistic expression artists 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.190
 of community ideas being created and 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.769
 friendship without documented by with 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.550
 games the educational aspects that they 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:07.140
 have 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.660
 so it's kind of like a ticket to a game is 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.569
 a human cultural product know is not only 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:15.060
 along with a lot of good people but I froze 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:18.450
 he has this proposal this premise of 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:20.370
 that it was a game like 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.349
 another thing knows how things in the 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.980
 everyday things are part of our 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:28.560
 life from you to start something without 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.299
 want to be the best even if it's a 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.099
 objective that will still be very long 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:34.019
 long time to be reached 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:36.599
 I think that's what I think the rodrigo 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:37.769
 we want with the steering wheel wants to do with 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:40.530
 young people to be accessible 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:42.209
 interesting and also in this when the 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.220
 cinema or you or anything else 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:46.590
 to society paulo 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.250
 there are many mishaps we have 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.620
 what to run 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:52.739
 we have a lot to grow is still 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.959
 both as to proportionately 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:56.459
 our own disease but believing 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.290
 it's over 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:59.910
 if you make our vehicle you will 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.950
