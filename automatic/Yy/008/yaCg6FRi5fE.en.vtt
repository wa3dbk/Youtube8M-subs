 the ct clean that needs a height of 70 meters the very different scenery of the 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:11.730
 that you have seen so far after three years the daily staff with day 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.199
 we go back and will negotiate in teresópolis and shows that electric activates is in 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.199
 full activity 

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:25.369
 well hidden 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:26.430
 the middle of a valley 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.659
 six kilometers from the São Paulo selection center 

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:32.889
 being with one of the highest that the families of the upper tietê 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.370
 the force of the waters that fell from a height of 70 meters that the engineers 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:39.950
 of the der 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.090
 at the beginning of last century decided 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.860
 I built this place 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.730
 not without subway and electric train 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.750
 first generator started operating in 1913 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.340
 initially the main objective 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.200
 was the mogi public lighting of the crosses 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:01.110
 the first to the first generator that supplies energy to mogi of the crosses or 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:02.930
 the connection of the second generator 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.820
 it can magnify a little 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.990
 the energy-based bow that comes here the official flaws themselves 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.190
 beirut caçapava santa white 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.130
 there it met this demand 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.850
 but in the 80's 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.860
 one of the players who trained during an overload and the production of 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:19.900
 electricity 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.360
 I did not answer any further 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.610
 the entire region 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.010
 sufficient grounds for a trap 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:26.860
 close activities 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.590
 the last visit of our team the incident of 2006 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.050
 the park that was already super sports avenue d 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.180
 of the foundation 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.320
 of sanitation 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.800
 arrived in a hurry and serve 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.980
 new projects until 1988 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:46.909
 the water of the dam in france by this huge population 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:53.130
 was moving the powerful the problems the population now wants to perform a 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.950
 ambitious idea 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:00.399
 I'm going to produce it and act as an electrician and turn the place into a kind of 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:01.890
 living museum 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.860
 the project she left the paper 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.510
 three years later 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.829
 it was a dream 

00:02:08.829 --> 00:02:11.019
 in reality 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:12.340
 - I work 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.340
 recovery 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:20.979
 they will come up 

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:23.689
 enough to supply a city 

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:25.279
 the Salesians 

00:02:25.279 --> 00:02:28.279
 terrible 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:33.909
 the most complex 

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:36.429
 this situation 

00:02:36.429 --> 00:02:39.429
 no longer exist 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:45.689
 hit a bushehr plant 

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:48.440
 the result of restorers work 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:49.809
 impressive 

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:53.129
 nor does it seem that the grandmother of the machines has almost 100 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:56.239
 right now 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.379
 this was just the poll 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:01.379
 everything you see here 

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:06.739
 the control panel as several shows of the old 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:08.369
 was also recovered 

00:03:08.369 --> 00:03:11.369
 - I received the support of a more modern equipment 

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:15.539
 two technicians who live in the residence of the ambassador Carlos Fleet 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.809
 This disrupts your work. 

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:21.099
 how easy it is to maintain 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:23.239
 we were so old 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:24.699
 air france-klm 

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:27.989
 We can keep 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:30.989
 the characteristic of the brand always clean also 

00:03:31.679 --> 00:03:35.819
 so we take a day to day holy week marten is standing 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:39.009
 on interesting farm and also has a huge tension team 

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:41.069
 differently 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:42.489
 all 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:45.469
 for them to be here 

00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:46.479
 especially 

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:49.479
 Miguel and third generation of a family of fishermen 

00:03:54.149 --> 00:03:55.669
 he is perfect 

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:59.629
 they will cheer by defeat of the stable team also by silas 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:05.039
 but the surprises for the visitor do not stop there 

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:09.459
 near the engine room to remain as it is reserved for 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:10.839
 tion to the 

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:13.839
 in a space of energy 

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:19.750
 from a small one that admitted by its vice to ossadas of animals typical of the 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:20.979
 region 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:24.409
 each team can get a surprise 

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:28.319
 the footprint injection molds of countries that were at the base 

00:04:28.319 --> 00:04:30.259
 being that in the area of ​​the park 

00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:32.860

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.979
 various subjects 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:44.789
 expect from water preservation the generation of energy 

00:04:45.559 --> 00:04:48.430
 physics concepts 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.639
 It's time to take my time. 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:51.960
 more positive 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.330
 and why not say 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.169
 there is more beautiful of the ride 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:00.639
 - first you have to climb a staircase with more than 200 books 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.460
 for those who are not prepared to jabulani 

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:09.199
 these measures are intended to compensate 

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:10.520
 for sure 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.620
 these people will not be able to go back 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.620
 beautiful landscape 

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:18.479
 up here 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:21.220
 the highest point of the timbira park 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:24.279
 observing 

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:27.279
 adriano but started with the water of the river tietê 

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:31.089
 inacia only 20 kilometers from the plant 

00:05:31.089 --> 00:05:33.999
 I have another side of the dam 

00:05:33.999 --> 00:05:36.999
 for sure 

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:42.639
 for anyone who cares 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:46.889
 the salesopolis energy museum welcomes the public on Tuesday 

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:48.569
 daughter of saturday 

00:05:48.569 --> 00:05:51.569
 9 am to 4 pm 

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:53.449
 the visits and 

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:55.539
 need to be scheduled 

00:05:55.539 --> 00:05:59.549
 all the information that is on the site and addressed my life 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.400
 this makes it easy to understand 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:13.930
 these three states 

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:16.930
 feeling more amenable to serving 

00:06:19.059 --> 00:06:22.469
 we tried to concentrate here 

00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:27.139
 it is necessary to present the conservation of the environment by 

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:30.509
 concentration of trios in the 

00:06:30.509 --> 00:06:33.840
 preservation of riparian forests, this is extremely important
