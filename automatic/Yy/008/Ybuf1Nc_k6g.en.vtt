00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
bit unforgiving at the beginning

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.529 
bit unforgiving at the beginning
especially<00:00:26.849> if<00:00:26.939> you're<00:00:27.029> playing<00:00:27.210> push

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
especially if you're playing push

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.519 
especially if you're playing push
because<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.439> security<00:00:29.189> guys<00:00:29.369> spawn<00:00:30.029> in<00:00:30.529> the

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
because the security guys spawn in the

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.650 
because the security guys spawn in the
bottom<00:00:32.309> of<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.579> hill<00:00:32.759> and<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.420> insurgents

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
bottom of the hill and the insurgents

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.780 
bottom of the hill and the insurgents
spawn<00:00:34.380> on<00:00:34.590> top<00:00:34.980> of<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.250> hill<00:00:35.399> so<00:00:35.610> they're

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
spawn on top of the hill so they're

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.510 
spawn on top of the hill so they're
basically<00:00:36.270> gonna<00:00:36.510> rain<00:00:37.110> havoc<00:00:37.590> on<00:00:37.770> everybody

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
basically gonna rain havoc on everybody

basically gonna rain havoc on everybody
that<00:00:38.730> just<00:00:38.969> runs<00:00:39.420> out<00:00:39.600> in<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.899> open<00:00:40.200> which<00:00:40.680> is

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
that just runs out in the open which is

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.889 
that just runs out in the open which is
quite<00:00:41.160> hard<00:00:41.430> not<00:00:41.760> to<00:00:41.940> do<00:00:42.090> because<00:00:42.450> this<00:00:42.629> game

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
quite hard not to do because this game

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.049 
quite hard not to do because this game
is<00:00:43.079> quite<00:00:43.260> open<00:00:43.590> itself<00:00:44.190> this<00:00:44.460> map<00:00:44.700> is<00:00:44.940> quite

spawn<00:00:47.579> right<00:00:47.879> here<00:00:48.210> they<00:00:48.539> can<00:00:48.750> run<00:00:48.960> pretty

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
spawn right here they can run pretty

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.529 
spawn right here they can run pretty
fast<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.280> edge<00:00:50.670> of<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.090> hill<00:00:51.239> and<00:00:51.510> just

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
fast to the edge of the hill and just

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.740 
fast to the edge of the hill and just
look<00:00:52.170> down<00:00:52.440> on<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:53.010> scrubs<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.090> peasants

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
look down on the scrubs the peasants

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.810 
look down on the scrubs the peasants
spawning<00:00:55.500> down<00:00:55.649> there<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:56.070> just<00:00:56.190> rape<00:00:56.579> them

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
spawning down there and just rape them

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.000 
spawning down there and just rape them
big-time<00:00:57.270> it<00:00:57.840> doesn't<00:00:58.350> help<00:00:58.469> that<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.829> team

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
big-time it doesn't help that the team

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.790 
big-time it doesn't help that the team
that<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.670> security<00:01:00.149> team<00:01:00.930> is<00:01:01.140> stupid<00:01:01.680> and

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
that the security team is stupid and

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.740 
that the security team is stupid and
uses<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.309> most<00:01:02.520> common<00:01:03.000> flat<00:01:03.270> are<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.600> most

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
uses the most common flat are the most

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.070 
uses the most common flat are the most
common<00:01:04.199> routes<00:01:04.439> if<00:01:05.369> they<00:01:05.580> use<00:01:05.760> smokes<00:01:06.210> the

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
common routes if they use smokes the

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.840 
common routes if they use smokes the
snipers<00:01:07.560> are<00:01:07.680> good<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.280> if<00:01:08.430> they<00:01:08.580> use<00:01:08.700> the

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
snipers are good and if they use the

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.910 
snipers are good and if they use the
flanks<00:01:09.240> with<00:01:09.570> these<00:01:09.810> three<00:01:10.200> things<00:01:10.500> they<00:01:10.770> can

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
flanks with these three things they can

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.460 
flanks with these three things they can
actually<00:01:11.430> progress<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.689> next<00:01:13.350> objective

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
actually progress to the next objective

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.990 
actually progress to the next objective
which<00:01:13.950> is<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.220> one<00:01:14.369> that<00:01:14.490> we're<00:01:14.700> seeing<00:01:14.909> here

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
which is the one that we're seeing here

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.420 
which is the one that we're seeing here
because<00:01:15.720> if<00:01:15.869> they<00:01:16.170> capture<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.799> hill<00:01:16.979> they

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
because if they capture the hill they

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.130 
because if they capture the hill they
can<00:01:17.580> progress<00:01:17.759> further<00:01:18.330> into<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.930> town

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
can progress further into the town

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.260 
can progress further into the town
that's<00:01:19.380> on<00:01:19.530> top<00:01:19.799> of<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.159> hill<00:01:20.340> right<00:01:20.520> here<00:01:21.119> we

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
that's on top of the hill right here we

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.160 
that's on top of the hill right here we
have<00:01:21.390> one<00:01:22.110> Road<00:01:22.560> on<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.890> far<00:01:23.460> right<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:24.420> left

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
have one Road on the far right and left

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.230 
have one Road on the far right and left
corner<00:01:25.590> sorry<00:01:25.890> that<00:01:26.369> leads<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:26.790> that<00:01:26.939> bridge

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
corner sorry that leads to that bridge

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.410 
corner sorry that leads to that bridge
and<00:01:27.540> then<00:01:27.689> you<00:01:27.780> can<00:01:27.960> go<00:01:28.110> even<00:01:28.259> further<00:01:29.030> in<00:01:30.030> the

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
and then you can go even further in the

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.899 
and then you can go even further in the
left<00:01:31.049> flank<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:31.590> surprise<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.369> enemies<00:01:32.759> but

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
left flank and surprise the enemies but

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.179 
left flank and surprise the enemies but
right<00:01:33.150> here<00:01:33.180> I<00:01:33.659> actually<00:01:34.079> use<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.950> other

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
right here I actually use the other

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.630 
right here I actually use the other
flank<00:01:35.729> so<00:01:36.000> I<00:01:36.030> used<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.930> flank<00:01:37.619> more<00:01:38.189> on<00:01:38.460> the

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
flank so I used the flank more on the

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.359 
flank so I used the flank more on the
right<00:01:38.909> side<00:01:39.329> and<00:01:39.689> it's<00:01:40.380> really<00:01:40.680> good<00:01:40.979> because

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
right side and it's really good because

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.160 
right side and it's really good because
you<00:01:41.670> surprise<00:01:42.030> all<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.390> enemies<00:01:42.720> because<00:01:42.869> as

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
you surprise all the enemies because as

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.679 
you surprise all the enemies because as
soon<00:01:43.500> as<00:01:43.799> this<00:01:43.979> as<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.759> insurgents<00:01:45.390> spawn

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
soon as this as the insurgents spawn

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.370 
soon as this as the insurgents spawn
they<00:01:46.259> go<00:01:46.850> straight<00:01:47.850> forward<00:01:48.270> or<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:49.170> their

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380

they go straight forward or to their
right<00:01:49.890> side<00:01:50.310> so<00:01:50.759> that<00:01:50.909> they<00:01:51.060> can<00:01:51.240> defend<00:01:51.509> the

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
right side so that they can defend the

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.499 
right side so that they can defend the
first<00:01:52.020> objective<00:01:52.530> which<00:01:52.680> is<00:01:53.000> right<00:01:54.000> here<00:01:54.240> in

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
objective that this is actually the only

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.270 
objective that this is actually the only
way

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
way

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.060 
way
we<00:02:14.640> saw<00:02:14.880> the<00:02:14.940> chance<00:02:15.300> in<00:02:15.510> this<00:02:15.630> map<00:02:15.930> so<00:02:16.170> I'm

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
we saw the chance in this map so I'm

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.950 
we saw the chance in this map so I'm
gonna<00:02:17.370> do<00:02:17.550> it<00:02:17.700> over<00:02:17.880> and<00:02:18.210> over<00:02:18.420> again<00:02:18.510> unless

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
gonna do it over and over again unless

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.780 
gonna do it over and over again unless
the<00:02:19.170> developers<00:02:19.620> do<00:02:19.770> something<00:02:20.190> about<00:02:20.400> this

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
the developers do something about this

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.840 
the developers do something about this
issue<00:02:21.090> but<00:02:21.870> on<00:02:22.110> the<00:02:22.260> other<00:02:22.380> hand<00:02:22.800> I<00:02:23.130> kind<00:02:23.700> of

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
issue but on the other hand I kind of

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.370 
issue but on the other hand I kind of
like<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.210> way<00:02:24.360> things<00:02:24.870> are<00:02:25.080> right<00:02:25.140> now

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
like the way things are right now

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.100 
like the way things are right now
because<00:02:25.770> insurgency<00:02:26.580> it's<00:02:27.120> an<00:02:27.360> unforgiving

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
because insurgency it's an unforgiving

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.870 
because insurgency it's an unforgiving
game<00:02:28.290> it's<00:02:28.740> not<00:02:28.920> supposed<00:02:29.310> to<00:02:29.400> be<00:02:29.580> a<00:02:29.610> game

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
game it's not supposed to be a game

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.030 
game it's not supposed to be a game
where<00:02:30.120> you're<00:02:30.270> playing<00:02:30.540> oh<00:02:30.810> I'm<00:02:31.440> having<00:02:31.709> so

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
where you're playing oh I'm having so

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.550 
where you're playing oh I'm having so
much<00:02:32.190> fun<00:02:32.459> being<00:02:32.760> a<00:02:32.910> damn<00:02:33.690> tire<00:02:33.990> than<00:02:34.260> having

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
much fun being a damn tire than having

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.130 
much fun being a damn tire than having
success<00:02:35.010> so<00:02:35.640> I<00:02:35.670> think<00:02:35.880> that<00:02:36.150> the<00:02:36.330> maps<00:02:36.810> should

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
success so I think that the maps should

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.280 
success so I think that the maps should
be<00:02:37.380> unforgiving<00:02:37.980> as<00:02:38.130> well<00:02:38.690> but<00:02:39.690> of<00:02:40.020> course

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
be unforgiving as well but of course

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.840 
be unforgiving as well but of course
that<00:02:40.590> there's<00:02:40.890> always<00:02:41.100> the<00:02:41.340> issue<00:02:41.490> with<00:02:41.730> by

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
that there's always the issue with by

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.610 
that there's always the issue with by
swiping<00:02:42.300> but<00:02:42.450> now<00:02:42.570> moving<00:02:42.900> to<00:02:43.020> the<00:02:43.110> new<00:02:43.260> weapon

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
swiping but now moving to the new weapon

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.300 
swiping but now moving to the new weapon
the<00:02:43.650> M<00:02:43.890> K<00:02:44.700> or<00:02:45.060> the<00:02:45.120> I<00:02:45.930> think<00:02:46.110> it's<00:02:46.380> the<00:02:46.410> MK<00:02:46.830> 14

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
the M K or the I think it's the MK 14

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.000 
the M K or the I think it's the MK 14
EVR<00:02:48.120> it's<00:02:48.480> a<00:02:48.660> beast<00:02:48.930> of<00:02:49.110> weapon<00:02:49.500> because<00:02:49.800> even

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
EVR it's a beast of weapon because even

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.199 
EVR it's a beast of weapon because even
though<00:02:50.100> it's<00:02:50.250> a<00:02:50.340> semi-automatic<00:02:50.640> sniper

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
though it's a semi-automatic sniper

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.170 
though it's a semi-automatic sniper
rifle<00:02:51.870> you<00:02:52.230> can<00:02:52.260> actually<00:02:52.920> fire<00:02:53.220> full<00:02:53.910> auto

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.080 
rifle you can actually fire full auto
just<00:02:54.780> like<00:02:54.959> I'm<00:02:55.140> doing<00:02:55.350> here<00:02:55.800> yes<00:02:56.250> it<00:02:56.550> kicks<00:02:56.910> a

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.300 
just like I'm doing here yes it kicks a
lot<00:02:57.270> but<00:02:57.570> come<00:02:57.780> on<00:02:57.900> you're<00:02:58.380> you're<00:02:58.770> firing<00:02:59.070> a

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310

semi-automatic sniper rifle in full auto

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.699 
semi-automatic sniper rifle in full auto
it<00:03:01.950> needs<00:03:02.310> to<00:03:02.580> kick<00:03:02.760> a<00:03:02.790> lot<00:03:03.060> so<00:03:03.510> the<00:03:04.200> thing<00:03:04.440> that

it needs to kick a lot so the thing that

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.430 
it needs to kick a lot so the thing that
I'm<00:03:04.980> most<00:03:05.010> impressed<00:03:05.580> about<00:03:06.570> this<00:03:06.750> weapon<00:03:07.290> is

favorite thing about this game playing

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.380 
favorite thing about this game playing
as<00:03:34.110> an<00:03:34.230> aggressive<00:03:34.620> sniper<00:03:35.239> trying<00:03:36.239> to

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
as an aggressive sniper trying to

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.080 
as an aggressive sniper trying to
disrupt<00:03:36.810> the<00:03:37.140> enemy<00:03:37.470> defenses<00:03:38.040> by<00:03:38.220> killing

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
them with the suppressor they don't even

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.410 
them with the suppressor they don't even
know<00:03:41.340> where<00:03:41.790> you<00:03:41.970> are
