away or I'm gonna get into it slowly I

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:43.040

think<00:05:41.250> this<00:05:41.430> first<00:05:41.880> volume<00:05:42.300> was<00:05:42.330> geared

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 
think this first volume was geared

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:49.550 
think this first volume was geared
towards<00:05:45.050> comedic<00:05:46.580> side<00:05:47.580> of<00:05:48.210> manga<00:05:49.170> than<00:05:49.380> the

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:49.560 
towards comedic side of manga than the

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.500 
towards comedic side of manga than the
than<00:05:49.980> action

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:51.510 
than action

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:53.810 
than action
not<00:05:52.050> much<00:05:52.200> plot<00:05:52.530> development<00:05:53.130> because<00:05:53.430> the

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:53.820 
not much plot development because the

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:55.700 
not much plot development because the
first<00:05:54.060> three<00:05:54.300> chapters<00:05:54.540> are<00:05:55.200> just<00:05:55.590> like

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:55.710 
first three chapters are just like

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:57.590 
first three chapters are just like
background<00:05:55.920> information<00:05:56.370> of<00:05:56.700> the<00:05:56.940> characters

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:57.600 
background information of the characters

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.080 
background information of the characters
and<00:05:58.170> the<00:05:58.740> first<00:05:58.980> chapter<00:05:59.190> is<00:05:59.430> not<00:05:59.550> that<00:05:59.880> long

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:00.090 
and the first chapter is not that long

checking this out it's a pretty popular

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:08.120 
checking this out it's a pretty popular
series<00:06:06.390> um<00:06:06.630> if<00:06:06.930> you<00:06:07.050> haven't<00:06:07.200> read<00:06:07.740> it<00:06:07.920> I

series um if you haven't read it I

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:10.370 
series um if you haven't read it I
recommend<00:06:09.030> just<00:06:09.240> reading<00:06:09.510> a<00:06:09.570> chapter<00:06:09.780> online

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:10.380 
recommend just reading a chapter online

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:13.760 
recommend just reading a chapter online
maybe<00:06:10.740> and<00:06:11.010> then<00:06:11.780> buying<00:06:12.780> it<00:06:13.080> of<00:06:13.200> course<00:06:13.440> and

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:13.770 
maybe and then buying it of course and

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:16.640 
maybe and then buying it of course and
if<00:06:13.920> you<00:06:14.010> don't<00:06:14.220> like<00:06:14.990> you<00:06:15.990> don't<00:06:16.080> like<00:06:16.200> it<00:06:16.500> then

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:16.650 
if you don't like you don't like it then

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:20.510 
if you don't like you don't like it then
I<00:06:16.740> guess<00:06:16.920> but<00:06:17.450> that's<00:06:18.450> what<00:06:18.630> I'd<00:06:18.720> recommend<00:06:19.520> so

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:20.520 
I guess but that's what I'd recommend so

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.390 
I guess but that's what I'd recommend so
