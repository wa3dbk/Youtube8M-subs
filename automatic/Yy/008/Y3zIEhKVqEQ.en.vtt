00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.820
 I work I am developing two 

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.950
 chilies or are already more than 180 volunteers 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.740
 they work service although it does more 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.700
 small salvation to homes 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.680
 service bar station where 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.140
 concrete tide access ramp 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.630
 transfer table finally all 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.250
 these small aids that contribute to 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.930
 a better quality life regarding the 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.880
 activates daily life as the bathroom is 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.660
 next to another place of our children 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.090
 girls and young people of telethon 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.850
 m for that they are participating 55 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:37.190
 volunteers we are working at home 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.260
 of 14 families here in paradise 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.900
 vineyard of the sea ​​that was and I saw German 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.680
 as well 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.680
 best 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.860
 1 the child of 6 years 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:53.050
 and what you have with motor problems 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:57.280
 you need a bar to be able to be 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:59.260
 hold and to go to the bathroom I gave it 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:03.960
 the telethon for here is very good because 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.960
 if one can go to more so much more every day 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.640
 the adaptation is for the son for his 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.900
 own independence so that he can 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.130
 fulfill their needs and the 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.130
 dependence on an adult 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.700
 so the mango 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:36.440
 we have to repair the ladder that equal 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:39.710
 I was like super unstable mom's 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.810
 When you upload it, you can fall 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.490
 the rungs are like super separate 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.980
 then we did it even more to 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.830
 hand just to allow mom to 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:51.970
 felipe that can climb better and can 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.970
 go down also quieter 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.490
 and they are going to do the massive works of 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.280
 winter the first ones that are going to do 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.960
 in this city there are approximately seven 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.840
 families who are going to be benefited 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.700
 with this work and there are 16 volunteers 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.500
 who are going to be participating in this 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.500
 a day that we hope will be successful 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:20.420
 and he and they are here because the 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.040
 and my dad needed a lot like what 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.969
 needed 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:29.569
 I weigh a lot is that I'm already 11 years old and 

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:35.109
 already so it weighed a lot for my dad and that 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:35.109
 so I want those bands that's why 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.219
 I was anxious the only thing I wanted 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.730
 come uncles every day 

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:51.739
 they asked when I touched her like this 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:51.739
 that is ready of the volunteers 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:57.160
 nothing is as rewarding as building 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:00.190
 maybe these small improvements that 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.560
 really people value them a lot 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.600
 the families and therefore for me 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.450
 build a bar to build a 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:10.800
 sitting a base is a gift that I 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:16.380
 I think it gives us life 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:20.750
 I felt lucky to have god that you 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.750
 want to help feeling 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:35.159
 the brand 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.159
 and learn 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:44.989
 at scarlett's house and mom 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:47.510
 He said he had many difficulties 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:49.269
 to enter their daughters who are 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:52.370
 wheelchair users therefore 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:55.640
 we will build two ramps that will allow 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.230
 greater autonomy greater independence and 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.420
 this will improve the quality of life not 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:02.590
 only of the girls but also 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.590
 from his grandmother's mom 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.450
 that we are going to do what is 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.190
 put bars because one of the 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.950
 main risks is that I will spend 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.600
 crawling they are backed then with 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.540
 these for us are we going to allow 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:20.030
 they have more security when going down and in 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:22.639
 this same way I can help you 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:28.210
 have greater independence the 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:28.210
 telethon has been everything for me why 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:37.789
 because marianas the movie 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:40.220
 you feel cold to read and as I say 

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:42.440
 little by little we have been moving forward and more 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:45.169
 now with book that I have you that I 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:47.139
 come to help so that the quality of 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:49.550
 My granddaughter's life is better for all 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:52.990
 they will receive help and people will also 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.990
 put more 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:01.770
 for me it's not like I 'm going to win the 

00:04:59.129 --> 00:05:03.020
 world with this evil but it is desire to 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.340
 keep doing your own things 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.590
 end the day with that rich fatigue 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:10.110
 when you say I'm tired but you 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:11.610
 it felt good and fly when life joy 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.740
 of the girls that the only thing I wanted was 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:16.620
 that we looked at the ramp to be 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:18.300
 independent encourages you to follow 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:21.449
 go ahead with continuing to collaborate 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:23.190
 got this opportunity that gives us the 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:25.800
 telethon to be able to help others 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:29.930
 people is a rich experience that 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.930
 every person should go through it
