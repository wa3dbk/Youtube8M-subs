 your team's game on the chart incorporates climatic changes that will make 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:20.690
 in other races a different experience in each situation 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.560
 Without a doubt, a title 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.560
 for the most hungry 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.140

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.010
 in the under funds between according to the cicig norms when applying 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.550

 505 gay 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.880
 a pretty gore game in which one can employ any martial art that 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.090
 suits better in response to our rapporteur is a genre that has not yet ended 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.520
 to boot at a massive level 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.930
 but who knows the aspect of supremacy is innovative 

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:09.750
 and maybe 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.950

 that make this saga a true futuristic town with nuances of terror 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:12.159
 the visual aspect of Friday the 22nd shines by itself and is that the 

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:16.430
 dark environments and a sinister background sound that keeps us always in 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.799
 tension 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:22.790
