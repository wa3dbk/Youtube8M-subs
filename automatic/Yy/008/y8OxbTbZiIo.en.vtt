00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.700
 from 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:23.509
 73 came brand in Hamburg and I 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:28.310
 now stand with leon sade after his 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:30.020
 fight against lecce 1 calendar madness 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.230
 fight see us soon your first 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:35.449
 Impressions very uncomfortable when he is very 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.300
 long very bony to be honest 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:39.140
 So I've already noticed every kik 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.150
 That's why I had to do more this time 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.150
 focus on boxing as he above too 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.710
 a little bit obviously everything is fine 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.570
 I worked it out a few times 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.549
 had downstairs but as I said one 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.530
 it has not been very hard type 

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:53.769
 completely stayed down 34 times 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.180
 got up again and again down 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:58.580
 respect has definitely fighter heart 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.400
 but in the end I could 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.960
 but I just beat the result 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.010
 marc bubeck won by points 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:09.080
 Finally you have three rounds 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.880
 it was some madness came yes 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.720
 stick hard the thing in first round 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.299
 it started already 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.130
 until the game worked on the outside 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:17.930
 there with his hook is that such a 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.150
 So here's the thing that was my first 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.460
 b-class fight and the first time that 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.840
 I over three times three minutes 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.580
 I wanted to go something out of the way 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.560
 and therefore wanted to put in the beginning then 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.270
 The end was good did not work 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.980
 worked accordingly he was a few 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.320
 Male down in the third round 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.580
 but there was definitely one good 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.320
 first good experience for me 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.180
 he was also a bit experienced as 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.680
 I was also a bit more experienced 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.270
 but as I said 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.060
 worked well and look something 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.740
 I still believe in the whole 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.760
 second row i just know that notice 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.650
 so what she believes his right leg 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.570
 a little struck or what do you have 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:54.900
 I noticed that until the entrance there 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.550
 So I noticed when they were his solaris 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.070
 Bavaria have therefore met with the look 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.450
 I already noticed that he was short 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.320
 is folded 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.940
 I do not know if his two 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.250
 already hurt before or just 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:08.340
 but sharp kiks up again 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.899
 I also kicked some times 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.240
 he does not feel anything 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.739
 So did not let it go down first 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.680
 then I continue to box out 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:19.620
 focused and that has brought more 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:23.010
 In any case, as the low kicks tell me 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:25.470
 let's come to the third round so that 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.800
 once briefly again so was really there 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.330
 then primary should be so there was none 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.830
 cover more that was he believed 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.230
 changed a few words like that 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.860
 little bit between you the topic briefly 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.600
 what was happening 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.280
 So I said I have the first and 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.560
 second round clearly won by trainer 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.630
 work that already at my break so 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.480
 only then in the third round were 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.680
 probably from his corner said 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.690
 that he should march forward 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.580
 and all or nothing I have 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.010
 I realize he has to admit it openly 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.390
 years old wanted to laugh a few times 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.040
 to get involved in the beating 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.660
 I'm a little bit in the moment 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.810
 become weak I have therefore with 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.060
 beaten lead now which 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.860
 think pen 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.870
 because it meant to me at the end was 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.459
 not really yes that was a right one 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.569
 what I did as I said but in 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:10.069
 I have a lot of people right now 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:11.660
 adrenaline was also a bit sour 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:13.430
 I wanted a round with the 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.650
 beat like I said I'm in the 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.090
 b class that was not so smart of me 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.069
 how I round the first two 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.480
 had already won but as I said 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:22.730
 still have the third round 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.349
 won and I think there came after 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.930
 pfronten heike there in the corners 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:28.970
 he also has a few times with his knee 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.860
 I also noticed, but how 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.150
 I said I simply part of 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.890
 suitable heavy as a third to 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.780
 swallow and implement here if that 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.600
 but then has brought that has 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.739
 dennis made the difference 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:43.310
 congratulations from team and from 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:44.660
 Personally, in 1900, that's what I'm aiming for 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.450
 b first class came as sees a 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:49.549
 future as I said I have in 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:52.540
 this category b class very much 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:54.830
 Respect for my opponent therefore 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.940
 diligently train the world to try 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:58.910
 with all my weight class 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.860
 strong stand on it and 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.989
 let's see what the future brings 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:05.420
 there are features of crete and a 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:07.459
 Compromise as I said before we were 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.600
 that we brought it to an end today 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:09.200
 wanted to see how it should be 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.730
 you go out 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.989
 but i think my coach will be adam 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:16.510
 In any case something to a next winter 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:16.510
 you will certainly see plans 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.750
 the last mode can 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.340
 Here you want to be outside or what I want 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:25.410
