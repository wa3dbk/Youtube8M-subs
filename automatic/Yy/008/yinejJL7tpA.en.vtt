real almost a career out of working with
sub<00:00:35.940> harmonics<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:37.700> composers<00:00:38.700> who<00:00:38.910> write

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
sub harmonics and composers who write

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
for that technique her name is Mari

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.970 
for that technique her name is Mari
Kimura<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:41.940> I<00:00:41.970> would<00:00:42.090> highly<00:00:42.329> recommend

finding her YouTube videos anyway I'm no

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.990 
finding her YouTube videos anyway I'm no
real<00:00:47.610> expert<00:00:48.210> when<00:00:48.420> it<00:00:48.510> comes<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.840> these<00:00:48.960> but

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 
real expert when it comes to these but

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.060 
real expert when it comes to these but
but<00:00:51.000> I<00:00:51.030> can<00:00:51.329> make<00:00:51.840> them<00:00:52.050> pop<00:00:52.290> out<00:00:52.469> from<00:00:52.710> time<00:00:52.950> to

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
but I can make them pop out from time to

00:00:53.070 --> 00:01:02.530 
but I can make them pop out from time to
time<00:00:53.100> I'm<00:00:53.399> going<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.579> try<00:00:53.730> that<00:00:53.760> now<00:00:53.910> for<00:00:54.090> you

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:02.540 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.180 

so<00:01:03.540> I<00:01:03.570> have<00:01:03.930> my<00:01:04.020> finger<00:01:04.290> on<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.470> D<00:01:04.739> right<00:01:04.980> here

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:05.190 
so I have my finger on the D right here

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.560 
so I have my finger on the D right here
but<00:01:05.339> actually<00:01:05.640> what's<00:01:05.760> popping<00:01:06.060> out<00:01:06.150> as<00:01:06.300> an<00:01:06.390> E

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
but actually what's popping out as an E

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:26.819 
but actually what's popping out as an E
flat<00:01:06.780> below

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:26.829 

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:29.080 

you<00:01:27.829> hear<00:01:27.979> those<00:01:28.100> bass<00:01:28.369> notes<00:01:28.609> just<00:01:28.789> popping

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
you hear those bass notes just popping

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.569 
you hear those bass notes just popping
out<00:01:29.179> down<00:01:29.390> there<00:01:31.750> all<00:01:32.750> I<00:01:32.810> can<00:01:32.990> say<00:01:33.170> is

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:33.579 
out down there all I can say is

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:36.450 
out down there all I can say is
experiment<00:01:34.579> with<00:01:35.090> where<00:01:35.479> you<00:01:35.630> place<00:01:35.899> your<00:01:35.929> bow

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
experiment with where you place your bow

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.309 
experiment with where you place your bow
each<00:01:37.460> bow<00:01:37.880> is<00:01:38.149> a<00:01:38.179> little<00:01:38.450> different<00:01:38.869> each<00:01:39.020> bow

00:01:39.309 --> 00:01:39.319 
each bow is a little different each bow

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:41.200 
each bow is a little different each bow
hair<00:01:39.710> is<00:01:39.920> a<00:01:39.950> little<00:01:40.130> different<00:01:40.640> each<00:01:40.850> string

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
hair is a little different each string

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:42.819 
hair is a little different each string
is<00:01:41.299> a<00:01:41.359> little<00:01:41.569> different<00:01:41.929> I<00:01:42.109> even<00:01:42.649> read

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:42.829 
is a little different I even read

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:45.340 
is a little different I even read
somewhere<00:01:43.250> that<00:01:43.310> some<00:01:43.969> some<00:01:44.630> people<00:01:45.049> in<00:01:45.170> order

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
somewhere that some some people in order

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.499 
somewhere that some some people in order
to<00:01:45.380> get<00:01:45.530> these<00:01:45.679> to<00:01:46.520> pop<00:01:46.700> out<00:01:46.880> really<00:01:47.000> well<00:01:47.240> are

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
to get these to pop out really well are

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:49.990 
to get these to pop out really well are
using<00:01:48.110> bold<00:01:48.530> strings<00:01:49.250> and<00:01:49.700> they<00:01:49.819> actually

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
using bold strings and they actually

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.020 
using bold strings and they actually
twist<00:01:50.569> the<00:01:50.869> strings<00:01:51.229> before<00:01:51.619> they<00:01:52.219> put<00:01:52.880> them

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
twist the strings before they put them

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.020 
twist the strings before they put them
on<00:01:53.119> the<00:01:53.209> cello<00:01:53.770> to<00:01:54.770> get<00:01:55.100> the<00:01:55.549> strings<00:01:55.819> to<00:01:55.939> do

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
on the cello to get the strings to do

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.280 
on the cello to get the strings to do
these<00:01:56.149> crazy<00:01:56.360> things<00:01:57.069> good<00:01:58.069> luck
