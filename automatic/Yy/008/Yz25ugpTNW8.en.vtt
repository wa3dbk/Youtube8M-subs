overgrown glitch profound with c4 drama
get<00:00:14.980> on<00:00:15.100> the<00:00:15.219> sand

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:15.769 
get on the sand

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:21.220 
get on the sand
we're<00:00:15.950> down<00:00:16.129> in<00:00:16.160> this<00:00:16.430> part<00:00:16.670> of<00:00:16.699> the<00:00:16.789> map<00:00:20.230> put

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:21.230 
we're down in this part of the map put

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.679 
we're down in this part of the map put
on<00:00:21.349> the<00:00:21.470> sand<00:00:21.770> bags<00:00:22.009> like<00:00:22.910> right<00:00:23.330> on<00:00:23.539> the

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:23.689 
on the sand bags like right on the

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:27.790 
on the sand bags like right on the
second<00:00:24.199> crack<00:00:25.570> get<00:00:26.570> on<00:00:26.660> top<00:00:26.869> of<00:00:26.900> it<00:00:27.199> and<00:00:27.230> do

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:27.800 
second crack get on top of it and do

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.290 
second crack get on top of it and do
your<00:00:27.949> c4<00:00:28.579> jump<00:00:30.099> after<00:00:31.099> that<00:00:31.460> you<00:00:31.790> should<00:00:31.820> be<00:00:32.210> on

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300 
your c4 jump after that you should be on

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.780 
your c4 jump after that you should be on
the<00:00:32.450> roof<00:00:34.570> and<00:00:35.570> basically<00:00:35.930> like<00:00:36.790> going

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:37.790 
the roof and basically like going

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.610 
the roof and basically like going
everybody<00:00:38.239> but<00:00:38.690> this<00:00:38.809> is<00:00:38.930> only<00:00:39.079> a<00:00:39.230> private

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
everybody but this is only a private

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.150 
everybody but this is only a private
match<00:00:39.800> so<00:00:40.100> and<00:00:40.870> then<00:00:41.870> here's<00:00:42.320> an<00:00:42.469> epic<00:00:42.860> fail

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 
match so and then here's an epic fail

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:50.590 
match so and then here's an epic fail
jump<00:00:46.120> alright<00:00:47.120> so<00:00:47.539> next<00:00:47.780> glitch<00:00:49.420> requires<00:00:50.420> no

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
jump alright so next glitch requires no

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.840 
jump alright so next glitch requires no
c<00:00:50.810> 4<00:00:51.050> can<00:00:51.500> be<00:00:51.530> done<00:00:51.829> in<00:00:51.980> normal<00:00:52.310> match<00:00:52.460> not

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
c 4 can be done in normal match not

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.490 
c 4 can be done in normal match not
really<00:00:53.120> a<00:00:53.150> glitch<00:00:53.390> i<00:00:53.600> don't<00:00:53.780> know<00:00:53.930> what<00:00:54.350> to

out of this group

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.460 
out of this group
and<00:01:26.860> yeah<00:01:27.300> that's<00:01:28.300> this<00:01:28.480> one<00:01:28.720> be<00:01:29.020> careful<00:01:29.380> you

and yeah that's this one be careful you

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.110 
and yeah that's this one be careful you
can't<00:01:29.650> all<00:01:29.830> be<00:01:29.860> there<00:01:30.130> so<00:01:30.430> I<00:01:32.940> don't<00:01:33.940> know<00:01:34.030> if

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:34.120 
can't all be there so I don't know if

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.880 
can't all be there so I don't know if
this<00:01:34.210> is<00:01:34.270> a<00:01:34.390> glitch<00:01:34.630> it's<00:01:34.960> probably<00:01:35.590> just<00:01:35.770> a

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
this is a glitch it's probably just a

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.700 
this is a glitch it's probably just a
sniping<00:01:36.190> spot<00:01:36.400> I<00:01:36.580> guess<00:01:36.850> and<00:01:37.390> then<00:01:38.200> you<00:01:38.320> can<00:01:38.500> go

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
sniping spot I guess and then you can go

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.310 
sniping spot I guess and then you can go
over<00:01:38.830> here<00:01:38.950> and<00:01:42.510> I<00:01:43.510> haven't<00:01:43.900> made<00:01:44.080> it<00:01:44.110> past

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
over here and I haven't made it past

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:54.390 
over here and I haven't made it past
this<00:01:44.590> tree<00:01:44.860> yet<00:01:49.380> but<00:01:50.380> ok<00:01:51.210> next<00:01:52.210> which<00:01:53.400> it's

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.400 
this tree yet but ok next which it's

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:00.930 
this tree yet but ok next which it's
over<00:01:54.640> on<00:01:54.760> that<00:01:54.880> same<00:01:55.180> area<00:01:58.140> over<00:01:59.140> here<00:01:59.820> this<00:02:00.820> is

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:00.940 
over on that same area over here this is

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.590 
over on that same area over here this is
how<00:02:01.000> you<00:02:01.060> do<00:02:01.240> it

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.950 

we<00:02:05.080> go<00:02:05.290> up<00:02:05.350> here

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
we go up here

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.639 
we go up here
and<00:02:07.110> you<00:02:07.260> jump<00:02:07.740> on<00:02:07.860> this<00:02:07.950> corner<00:02:09.440> and<00:02:10.440> you're

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
and you jump on this corner and you're

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:17.230 
and you jump on this corner and you're
on<00:02:14.480> and<00:02:15.480> if<00:02:15.720> that's<00:02:15.990> pretty<00:02:16.290> cool<00:02:16.440> spot

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
on and if that's pretty cool spot

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.470 
on and if that's pretty cool spot
because<00:02:18.240> you<00:02:18.450> can<00:02:18.600> do<00:02:18.690> that<00:02:18.780> in<00:02:18.930> a<00:02:18.990> normal<00:02:19.170> man

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
because you can do that in a normal man

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.720 
because you can do that in a normal man
so<00:02:21.480> i'll<00:02:21.959> have<00:02:22.110> more<00:02:22.350> glitch<00:02:22.620> videos<00:02:23.160> on<00:02:23.489> the

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
so i'll have more glitch videos on the

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.380 
so i'll have more glitch videos on the
way<00:02:23.910> and<00:02:24.239> don't<00:02:24.870> forget<00:02:25.140> subscribe
