00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 and hello to all today I want 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.509
 to help you give you a tool 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.150
 that will really allow your 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.440
 constructions to rush to the sky 

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:11.460
 so you may not see what 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.200
 I speak but if you already have 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.980
 build any type of tower 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.780
 in minecraft 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.630
 you are probably already familiar 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.609
 with the stairs and you know 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.350
 probably only climb stairs 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.859
 it's an extremely experience 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.359
 unpleasant to stay polite so I 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.519
 created with block commands a 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.949
 extremely simple aesthetic solution 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.230
 is extremely easy to use I 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.899
 speak of course you have a lift in 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.700
 common to be able to install this small 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.829
 jewel of technology in minecraft you 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.870
 are going to need 2 314 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.520
 orders / stocks a tractor and five 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.719
 years of post-baccalaureate studies in the field 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.070
 of engineering 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.960
 in reality you are going to need that 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.940
 of a command block he commands and a 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.770
 British is that the magic of the system 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.539
 to get a common block you 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.340
 just type in slashgear chat 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.680
 your nickname then me it's the spins 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.809
 block commands with an underscore between 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.969
 how to unlock and you go 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.320
 immediately the hotel for the block 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.970
 johansson was very simple he you 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.490
 just go to the ralston tab of 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.320
 your activity inventory the block 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.430
 right are then you miss it more 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.810
 that order then that you go 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.229
 go into the description you will have a 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.700
 link to a page will copy done very 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.369
 long commands by pressing 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.630
 control to then control it's you 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.679
 will come back to your window 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.299
 now we have recovered our 

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:28.009
 commandpad orders and our 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:29.689
 anonymous vacuum blogger pushed him 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:32.149
 commando block go in and back on 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:33.619
 control veins to paste the command 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:35.929
 so you see she's really 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:37.969
 very very very long and then you 

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:40.039
 just push the johnson block to 

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:41.840
 side and magic a system appears 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:44.090
 so he'll get you pretty much 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.979
 start the system for it's very simple 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.869
 you press the button and you go 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:49.870
 also get two little worries 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:51.430
 so I'll talk about them 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.410
 so I prepared two blocks a block 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.760
 thor is a block of reston that are 40 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:56.470
 blocks from each other in terms of 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.150
 height and so we will try to use 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.000
 our elevator then for that it is enough 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:03.400
 to put the little paf called 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.930
 elevator so we put it down and there we 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.300
 simply click on it 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.940
 and you can see up to the block 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.130
 next who was the cnosm so we got 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.630
 traveled 40 block in really very few 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.730
 time it's even this faster you 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.530
 go see him that creative theft as well 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.870
 I show it takes me a lot a lot 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.090
 more time but I will show you 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.590
 later how to change the speed 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.760
 of the system if you want to go yet 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.070
 faster or if you want everything 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.310
 just slow down so people 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:31.660
 can admire your constructions 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.190
 it's now you want to delete 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.230
 this lift nothing more simple it 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.690
 you just need to use the second man 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.700
 who's called who picks and gold and you 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.560
 place it on the upper side of the block 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.060
 by two ways you to interact 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.060
 than with the upper face because it has 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.120
 tried on the sides you go all 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:51.060
 on there social time only has 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.370
 on the upper side and the lasso goes out 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.050
 disappear immediately but if you 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.250
 do not like the ice cream or think 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.569
 that another block would be much better 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.790
 with the rest of your constructions 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:01.410
 can you change this block 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.150
 lifts well yes it's extremely 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.209
 simple just place a 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.160
 piston with the blog you want 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.510
 put in the ice place and you 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.310
 feed piston and you will see 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.739
 a touch changes extremely simply 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.349
 if now you decide to 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:18.420
 go back to the original block and well there you 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:20.160
 just break the new block and 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.620
 I was going back to the blocks immediately 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.239
 of ice so now I 'm going to you 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.980
 show how to change the speed of 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.940
 this elevator so it's a little bit 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.370
 more complicated than the others 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.709
 manipulations you will have to come back 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.360
 to the system and you're going to go to the block 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:35.370
 concrete which is just above 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.750
 of the button so this one you go 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.209
 break and you'll see how this 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.739
 justicer block you get in and 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.510
 you see a command a little bit 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:43.920
 complicated then you do not worry 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.200
 from the beginning of the order to the end 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:49.600
 which interests us and you see if we have to 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.630
 0 01 points 0 0 period 0 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:55.810
 so if you c determine the speed 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:57.340
 vertical horizon among these tss 1.0 so 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.550
 if you want to slow down for example 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.560
 system you will put 0.1 point in 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.030
 five years it is rather a good speed 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.010
 if you want people to 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.510
 admire your constructions or at 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.670
 contrary if he went very fast 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.500
 you can put a point five or 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.490
 1.7 I do not really recommend 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.500
 to go over because that of 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:15.520
 your game is going to start ags and 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.830
 especially for people who take 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.940
 the elevator 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:20.080
 so that's about all that 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.530
 I had to tell you about this 

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.360
 invention 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.310
 I hope you enjoyed this 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.800
 video if yes do not hesitate to put a 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:29.590
 little shot of blue and to subscribe and 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.460
 in the meantime I will try to 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.980
 make a small thimble 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:39.000
 so we'll see if I get there 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:39.000
 believe and yes go hi to all
