00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.830
 hello friends i'm huge 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.769
 I was looking forward to when I could see 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.450
 pebble steel and it finally happened 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:17.550
 most it seems to me better and smart watches 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.859
 are now not only useful but also 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.430
 and beautiful pebble steel is steel 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.100
 body 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.619
 this is a protective glass gorilla glass 3 this 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.500
 water resistant to 5 atm is 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.330
 two straps included and finally it 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.250
 huge amount really 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.710
 convenient and necessary applications for themselves 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.960
 hours and now in order we rarely 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.820
 show the box but here it is worth 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.309
 make pebble come in very 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.559
 big and pass box they are beautiful 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.570
 stacked inside and even something velvety 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.920
 trimmed in general first acquaintance with 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.320
 the buyer only delivers 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.000
 pleasure themselves pebble steel which 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.800
 already managed to test and drags 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.140
 differ from original pebble only 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.789
 the look here is the same screen on 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.980
 electronic ink based same 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.079
 applications and also a battery for 130 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.080
 milliamp hours like everything too 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.909
 but how beautiful they became by the way 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.360
 steel is an order of magnitude less than the original 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.369
 pebble 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.409
 and live it feels strong to me why 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.290
 it seemed that they were really more they 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.659
 such neat little and so body 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.880
 consists of steel and the screen is covered with durable 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.650
 glass buttons are also steel and what 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.110
 interesting because of the size reduction not 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.210
 steel with grouping or something to press from 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.610
 it didnâ€™t get worse 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.650
 better on the original watch all made 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.710
 made of plastic and they are accordingly lighter 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.240
 only 38 grams steel weigh 56 grams 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.600
 but I do not think it's much to find yourself 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.670
 pebble steel costs US $ 249 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.070
 pebble watch also remained sales and 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.470
 they, like a year ago, cost 150 dollars and 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.009
 if the original watches have five 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.869
 colors 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.750
 the steel is sold in two types 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.430
 silver and matte black in 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.320
 for each version there are two 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.869
 strap yes there are two pieces at once 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.909
 complete leather and steel originally 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.560
 watches come with a leather strap and to 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.610
 change it you need to go to the usual 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.710
 watchmaker 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.110
 as the mount here is like normal 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.950
 watches in principle, in general, and your strap 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.320
 can put 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.750
 by the way leather strap in pictures 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.580
 looked better live it more like 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.010
 dermantin can be based 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.120
 bottom wife is not clear in short this fact 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.250
 a little upset 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.200
 but another change is the opposite 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.330
 pleased at the new watch fastening 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.840
 Charger changed charging technology 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.820
 also 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.830
 but the mount is still another teeth 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.780
 are inserted deeply therefore not here 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.820
 there will be problems with barely holding on 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.310
 charger as it was before and this 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.380
 nice to know and yes on the body 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.140
 smart watches appeared charge indicator 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.240
 if orange means charging green 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.640
 then charged with the advent of pebble 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.890
 steel firmware version 2 has appeared 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.390
 opened its own appstore in the store 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.880
 already available a large number 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.250
 application games and watch faces to any 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.350
 taste and demand if you want even 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.330
 analog flappy bird has it all 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.370
 applications are installed in the clock menu 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.590
 they are already after the standard there 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.940
 below and by the way did you notice in the clock 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.830
 Russian language they are completely 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.110
 Russified and moreover competently 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.480
 Russified of course from our box 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.640
 there is no language but you can download the firmware 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.740
 and put through the app on ios or 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.020
 android it all takes 3 minutes 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:15.540
 but how nice what can be done 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:17.970
 conclusion well, to me personally, pebble steel 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.800
 cute most just need more 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.930
 look qualcomm talk and do 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.360
 final conclusions but pebble now 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:27.030
 this and tracker runs and smart watches and 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.920
 useful applications and their corner here 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.650
 here and google system management sometimes 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.600
 mercedes and smart ladies can cheeks prostrate 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.209
 on foursquare for general opportunity 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.250
 almost inexhaustible and now it is also 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.820
 nice to wear even with a business 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.269
 suit 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:44.550
 but darga whether they are so expensive 250 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:46.530
 dollars is not a small amount especially in 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:49.470
 Russia, it will become even more but the price 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.380
 more than justified and that functionality and 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.850
 the beauty that this watch gives 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:56.670
 sure almost all pi owners were 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:58.800
 pretty well and of course the charge I recall 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.930
 that pebble lasts about 7 days 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.850
 well, what can be talk in 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:06.769
 regards galaxy gear or sony 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.769
 no smartwatch after that
