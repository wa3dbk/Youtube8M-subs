00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
that works also on top of Beacon you can

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.260 
that works also on top of Beacon you can
place<00:01:40.530> these<00:01:40.710> these<00:01:41.100> are<00:01:41.160> glass<00:01:41.610> panes<00:01:41.970> my

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
glass panes you could probably use get

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.220 
glass panes you could probably use get
glass<00:01:44.430> panes<00:01:44.730> if<00:01:45.030> you<00:01:45.120> were<00:01:45.210> sure<00:01:45.240> but<00:01:45.870> really

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:46.230 
glass panes if you were sure but really

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:47.810 
glass panes if you were sure but really
you<00:01:46.350> don't<00:01:46.560> need<00:01:46.650> to<00:01:46.980> because<00:01:47.220> I<00:01:47.430> would<00:01:47.640> say<00:01:47.790> a

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
you don't need to because I would say a

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.460 
you don't need to because I would say a
glass<00:01:48.180> block<00:01:48.510> looks<00:01:48.810> better<00:01:49.050> than<00:01:49.260> these

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
glass block looks better than these

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.490 
glass block looks better than these
however<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:51.150> color<00:01:51.390> beacon<00:01:51.840> system<00:01:52.260> works

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
however the color beacon system works

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.710 
however the color beacon system works
very<00:01:52.830> similar<00:01:53.220> to<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.400> colored<00:01:53.760> I<00:01:54.000> you<00:01:54.510> can

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
very similar to the colored I you can

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.600 
very similar to the colored I you can
have<00:01:54.900> thousands<00:01:55.590> upon<00:01:55.860> thousands<00:01:56.400> of

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
have thousands upon thousands of

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.040 
have thousands upon thousands of
different<00:01:56.820> combinations<00:01:57.210> and<00:01:57.810> I'm<00:01:57.870> going<00:01:58.020> to

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.050 
different combinations and I'm going to

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:59.720 
different combinations and I'm going to
show<00:01:58.140> you<00:01:58.260> how<00:01:58.320> that<00:01:58.500> works<00:01:58.650> so<00:01:59.160> first<00:01:59.370> off<00:01:59.550> let

00:01:59.720 --> 00:01:59.730 
show you how that works so first off let

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.340 
show you how that works so first off let
me<00:01:59.760> show<00:01:59.970> you<00:02:00.060> what<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.300> basic<00:02:00.750> colors<00:02:01.110> and

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
me show you what the basic colors and

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:07.670 
me show you what the basic colors and
there's<00:02:01.680> 1<00:02:01.890> 2<00:02:02.190> 3<00:02:02.220> 4<00:02:02.790> 5<00:02:03.540> 6<00:02:03.900> 7<00:02:04.200> 8<00:02:04.620> 9<00:02:05.160> 10<00:02:05.700> 11<00:02:06.150> 12<00:02:06.750> 13<00:02:07.260> 14

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
there's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.309 
there's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14
15<00:02:08.399> 16<00:02:09.080> default<00:02:10.080> colors<00:02:10.470> of<00:02:10.679> a<00:02:12.110> beacon<00:02:13.110> light

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
15 16 default colors of a beacon light

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.380 
15 16 default colors of a beacon light
so<00:02:13.739> the<00:02:14.220> reason<00:02:14.430> why<00:02:14.640> I<00:02:14.670> like<00:02:14.940> these<00:02:15.180> is

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
so the reason why I like these is

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.320 
so the reason why I like these is
because<00:02:15.620> game<00:02:16.620> type<00:02:17.040> minigames<00:02:17.550> should<00:02:18.030> I<00:02:18.090> say

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
because game type minigames should I say

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.809 
because game type minigames should I say
40<00:02:18.870> team-based<00:02:19.739> minigames<00:02:20.340> I<00:02:20.580> should<00:02:20.730> have

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
40 team-based minigames I should have

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.300 
40 team-based minigames I should have
said<00:02:20.970> you<00:02:21.959> can<00:02:22.140> have<00:02:22.290> corresponding<00:02:22.980> color<00:02:23.159> so

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
said you can have corresponding color so

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.610 
said you can have corresponding color so
you<00:02:23.400> can<00:02:23.549> say<00:02:23.730> like<00:02:23.939> 3p<00:02:24.689> or<00:02:24.840> two<00:02:24.989> people<00:02:25.290> go<00:02:25.439> on

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
you can say like 3p or two people go on

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.280 
you can say like 3p or two people go on
red<00:02:25.829> team<00:02:26.040> to<00:02:26.340> a<00:02:26.370> blow<00:02:26.670> to<00:02:26.939> agree

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:54.199 
on the glass block like this it goes in

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:56.289 
on the glass block like this it goes in
fours<00:03:54.500> but<00:03:55.370> this<00:03:55.549> way<00:03:55.699> when<00:03:55.849> you<00:03:55.909> combine<00:03:56.180> them

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:56.299
