shy<00:02:33.990> doing<00:02:34.350> kamina<00:02:34.650> i<00:02:34.770> think<00:02:34.950> is<00:02:35.040> the<00:02:35.160> first

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
shy doing kamina i think is the first

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.370 
shy doing kamina i think is the first
double<00:02:35.580> group<00:02:35.850> that's<00:02:36.030> coming<00:02:36.300> out<00:02:36.390> and<00:02:36.570> it's

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
set in a very interesting world the

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.230 
set in a very interesting world the
landmark<00:02:40.350> can<00:02:40.500> go<00:02:40.650> to<00:02:40.710> go<00:02:40.860> I<00:02:41.130> think<00:02:41.820> the<00:02:41.910> Mafia

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
landmark can go to go I think the Mafia
