00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
to move jump around a little bit with

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.380 
to move jump around a little bit with
the<00:03:30.320> wind<00:03:30.799> still<00:03:31.310> you<00:03:31.850> should<00:03:32.090> know<00:03:32.269> that<00:03:34.390> and

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390

could get him flying off but it was hard

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.319
