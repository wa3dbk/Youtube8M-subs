happens<00:00:29.320> but<00:00:29.950> I<00:00:30.009> think<00:00:30.460> on<00:00:30.550> the<00:00:30.670> long<00:00:30.939> time<00:00:31.180> is

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:31.360 
happens but I think on the long time is

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.200 
happens but I think on the long time is
going<00:00:31.509> to<00:00:31.540> be<00:00:31.660> good<00:00:32.259> for<00:00:32.590> me<00:00:32.739> I'm<00:00:33.670> decides

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:34.210 
going to be good for me I'm decides

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.240 
going to be good for me I'm decides
