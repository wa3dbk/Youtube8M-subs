 Well, in my shop 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:50.430
 There is a lot of things like this called a forest walkway

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:12.450
 Let's review the video on Monday for the same way 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:17.590
 First of all, it's a food processor . 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:21.939
 100g water 24 c 4 Please keep this cold too 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:25.630
 After salt It is a whole eggs 24g will enter the first one 

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:31.719
 I'm mixing this with a food processor though 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:37.580
 If you mix it at once, there is a high possibility that the article will not come back while spreading outward 

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:42.920
 While in repeated or entered intermittently mouth or put on or off put that switch 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:44.420
 Article in the ne Then pattern you have to mix the powder the Well and has high moisture that contains 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:51.260
 Become creamy 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:52.880
 Now so is there in flour and mix by the addition of 120g do so when the term of one 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.080
 Because you will paste 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:02:00.540
 Taking it to the lap 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:01.710
 The thickness is suppressed to about 1 cm too much, and it uses it after making it 0 for 1 hour with a refrigerator 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.760
 Please give me 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:11.009
 Now that pie dough is lying in the refrigerator now 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:17.160
 In I'm putter I think I'm a high club da command in you is between the 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:19.020
 Butter is it is better to aside 30g This kinda need bedding Yes and 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.580
 I think I'm pure white peach 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.580
 Here 30 Grampus 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:34.900
 Today is a little bit so here 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:40.380
 Before putting in eggs, let's put it in place. Almond poodle is 30g yes 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:44.520
 It is such a thing It is weak flour 9g Yes this is 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:47.240
 It's the fourth floor I think I'm a little more the other day 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.240
 Ha 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:53.180
 And 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.260
 It is egg 30g experience with whole egg 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.950
 Hmm 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.950
 9 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:07.330
 Yes i was able to do this 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:12.640
 Now here is Soshitara Yes it has cooled down sufficiently also exhaust path 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:17.440
 It is half that there was 8 We want to do useful rights right today 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:26.670
 Well 9cm wide Let's 25cm long 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:26.670
 It is the thickness is good in about a Well 1.5 I eh thickness But it anymore elongated have Yes 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.560
 Yes probably it was roughly so it is this kind of form 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:47.300
 Yes It is such a tooth to be in this kind of Fu to you by I Come remaining half also the same place law 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:49.710
 It is a by 1 cm trash to 1 cm narrow range width 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:54.390
 Is 25 cm if the length 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:58.380
 In seems roughly the sense that I wonder about 3 mm not we do about this Japan 3 mm 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:04:02.110
 When there is only one well It seems that it is 3mm when it piles up with this 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:05.140
 Roughly it this way because Katappo is good just 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:11.670
 Sprouting good unlikely to height was to align 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:17.730
 Yes only this water park Apply a little water Let's go to the both ends 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:19.320
 This is the case I wonder if I will instead ride and placing your article of its complement and longer 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.889
 That's right 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.889
 That's right 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:31.830
 So now this 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:33.310
 And the has entered into a piping bag is squeezed on top of the dough it That's right I am the claim da command 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.060
 is 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:40.639
 The large-I in such a Fu 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:43.729
 It's about this, though it is appropriate and good 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:48.349
 It is nice to Tsu nuts Well in his or her place 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:55.139

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:16.990
 is not it 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:19.780
 In this comes to do so is it that finishing or rather Serve from taking Ayahari crude heat 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:22.430
