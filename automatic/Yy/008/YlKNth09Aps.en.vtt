00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
twenty years and not been killed because

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.169 
twenty years and not been killed because
as<00:00:10.019> great<00:00:10.559> as<00:00:10.710> Hal<00:00:10.920> Jordan<00:00:11.309> is<00:00:11.429> and<00:00:11.670> Hal<00:00:11.820> Jordan

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
as great as Hal Jordan is and Hal Jordan

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.600 
as great as Hal Jordan is and Hal Jordan
is<00:00:12.269> a<00:00:12.300> great<00:00:12.509> character<00:00:12.719> Kyle<00:00:13.590> of<00:00:14.009> all<00:00:14.340> the

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
is a great character Kyle of all the

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.220 
is a great character Kyle of all the
Green<00:00:14.820> Lantern's<00:00:15.240> I<00:00:15.450> think<00:00:15.660> is<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:15.900> character

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
Green Lantern's I think is the character

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.220 
Green Lantern's I think is the character
who's<00:00:16.379> easiest<00:00:16.830> to<00:00:16.949> empathize<00:00:17.310> with<00:00:17.369> because

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:18.230 
who's easiest to empathize with because

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.700 
who's easiest to empathize with because
he's<00:00:19.230> got<00:00:19.740> an<00:00:19.980> awful<00:00:20.369> lot<00:00:20.490> of<00:00:20.550> feelings<00:00:21.330> um<00:00:22.109> and

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
he's got an awful lot of feelings um and

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.410 
he's got an awful lot of feelings um and
I<00:00:22.769> think<00:00:22.830> that<00:00:22.980> makes<00:00:23.220> him<00:00:23.369> very<00:00:23.580> very<00:00:23.910> exit

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
I think that makes him very very exit

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.609 
I think that makes him very very exit
that's<00:00:24.570> what<00:00:24.689> I<00:00:24.720> like<00:00:25.019> about<00:00:25.050> him<00:00:25.410> is<00:00:25.439> he's

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
that's what I like about him is he's

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.290 
that's what I like about him is he's
this<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:26.010> sensitive<00:00:26.460> artist<00:00:26.760> type<00:00:26.910> and<00:00:27.240> I

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
this the sensitive artist type and I

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.750 
this the sensitive artist type and I
think<00:00:27.539> because<00:00:27.980> like<00:00:28.980> we<00:00:29.130> joke<00:00:29.369> like<00:00:29.519> I<00:00:29.580> said

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
think because like we joke like I said

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.910 
think because like we joke like I said
he<00:00:29.880> is<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.119> most<00:00:30.269> special<00:00:30.570> but<00:00:30.990> he<00:00:31.289> is<00:00:31.560> without

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
he is the most special but he is without

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.560 
he is the most special but he is without
feeling<00:00:32.250> like<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.399> Mary<00:00:32.669> Sue<00:00:32.759> and<00:00:33.210> that's<00:00:33.390> a

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
feeling like a Mary Sue and that's a

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.709 
feeling like a Mary Sue and that's a
really<00:00:33.930> difficult<00:00:34.350> line<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:35.100> walk<00:00:35.719> especially

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
really difficult line to walk especially

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.360 
really difficult line to walk especially
in<00:00:36.840> superhero<00:00:37.380> comics<00:00:37.590> and<00:00:38.010> I<00:00:38.070> think<00:00:38.250> it's

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
in superhero comics and I think it's

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.740 
in superhero comics and I think it's
been<00:00:38.489> done<00:00:38.640> really<00:00:38.850> well<00:00:39.090> for<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.360> most<00:00:39.510> part

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
been done really well for the most part

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.680 
been done really well for the most part
