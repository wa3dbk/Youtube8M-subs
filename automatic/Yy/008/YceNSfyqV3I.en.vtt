carbohydrates<00:00:49.559> no<00:00:50.460> ketones<00:00:51.000> so<00:00:51.360> if<00:00:51.420> this<00:00:51.660> is

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
carbohydrates no ketones so if this is

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.689 
carbohydrates no ketones so if this is
what<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.260> way<00:00:52.379> we<00:00:52.590> should<00:00:52.620> be<00:00:52.800> feeling<00:00:53.430> our

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699

forward<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.219> I<00:00:56.430> don't<00:00:56.730> think<00:00:56.910> mother<00:00:57.090> nature

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
forward and I don't think mother nature

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.619 
forward and I don't think mother nature
got<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.260> wrong<00:00:58.469> so<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.699> next<00:00:59.730> one<00:01:00.210> is<00:01:00.239> that

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629

important and there is no one food that
is<00:01:52.310> super<00:01:52.549> food<00:01:52.909> and<00:01:53.149> the<00:01:53.630> other<00:01:53.750> foods<00:01:54.049> well

00:01:54.279 --> 00:01:54.289 
is super food and the other foods well

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:55.899 
is super food and the other foods well
forget<00:01:54.770> about<00:01:54.799> they're<00:01:55.310> just<00:01:55.340> not<00:01:55.670> so

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
forget about they're just not so

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:57.760 
forget about they're just not so
important<00:01:56.360> fruits<00:01:56.960> and<00:01:57.110> veggies<00:01:57.469> are

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
important fruits and veggies are

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.550 
important fruits and veggies are
unhealthiest<00:01:58.520> foods<00:01:58.700> so<00:01:59.420> just<00:02:00.020> understand

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
unhealthiest foods so just understand

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.980 
unhealthiest foods so just understand
it's<00:02:00.890> an<00:02:01.070> array<00:02:01.460> of<00:02:01.490> nutrients<00:02:02.420> that<00:02:02.539> we<00:02:02.780> need

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
it's an array of nutrients that we need

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.609 
it's an array of nutrients that we need
so<00:02:03.560> we<00:02:03.590> cannot<00:02:04.009> identify<00:02:04.250> one<00:02:04.909> food<00:02:05.350> ok<00:02:06.350> so<00:02:06.409> the

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
so we cannot identify one food ok so the

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:08.499 
so we cannot identify one food ok so the
next<00:02:06.770> point<00:02:07.009> is<00:02:07.250> that<00:02:07.490> we're<00:02:08.209> all<00:02:08.269> made

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
next point is that we're all made

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.719 
next point is that we're all made
differently<00:02:09.019> people<00:02:09.500> eat<00:02:09.739> differently<00:02:10.280> that

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
differently people eat differently that

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.900 
differently people eat differently that
what<00:02:10.880> is<00:02:11.000> it<00:02:11.030> different<00:02:11.540> and<00:02:11.690> they<00:02:11.900> deal<00:02:12.709> with

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
what is it different and they deal with

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.430 
what is it different and they deal with
carbohydrates<00:02:13.910> and<00:02:14.060> fats<00:02:14.300> differently<00:02:14.900> so

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
carbohydrates and fats differently so

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.160 
carbohydrates and fats differently so
for<00:02:15.650> instance<00:02:15.680> I<00:02:16.640> could<00:02:17.000> be<00:02:17.269> a<00:02:17.540> high<00:02:17.840> fat

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
for instance I could be a high fat

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.470 
for instance I could be a high fat
person<00:02:19.010> so<00:02:19.220> I<00:02:19.250> need<00:02:19.610> to<00:02:19.730> be<00:02:19.849> lots<00:02:20.030> of<00:02:20.180> fact

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
person so I need to be lots of fact

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.110 
person so I need to be lots of fact
where<00:02:21.140> this<00:02:21.290> unit<00:02:21.769> here<00:02:22.069> can<00:02:22.489> be<00:02:22.519> a<00:02:22.640> low-fat

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
where this unit here can be a low-fat
