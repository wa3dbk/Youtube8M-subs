however because I did just hit 200k I

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.350

comment section below but then also we
have<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.329> added<00:01:39.720> problems<00:01:40.170> of<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.680> extra

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
have the added problems of the extra

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.590 
have the added problems of the extra
Pistons<00:01:41.490> and<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.970> blocks<00:01:42.210> going<00:01:42.450> behind

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
Pistons and the blocks going behind

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.240 
Pistons and the blocks going behind
blocks<00:01:42.960> it<00:01:43.320> just<00:01:43.500> creates<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:43.950> bit<00:01:44.100> of<00:01:44.130> a

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
blocks it just creates a bit of a

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.069 
blocks it just creates a bit of a
nightmare<00:01:44.460> inside<00:01:45.090> my<00:01:45.240> brain<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:45.689> it<00:01:45.899> did

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
nightmare inside my brain and it did

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.780 
nightmare inside my brain and it did
take<00:01:46.259> quite<00:01:46.530> a<00:01:46.590> long<00:01:46.770> time<00:01:46.979> to<00:01:47.040> make<00:01:47.310> but

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
take quite a long time to make but

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.580 
take quite a long time to make but
anyway<00:01:48.060> that's<00:01:48.299> enough<00:01:48.659> of<00:01:48.780> me<00:01:48.840> wetter<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:49.470> on

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
anyway that's enough of me wetter and on

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.450 
anyway that's enough of me wetter and on
how<00:01:50.040> about<00:01:50.130> we<00:01:50.340> crack<00:01:50.579> on<00:01:50.610> with<00:01:50.820> this<00:01:51.180> tutorial

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
how about we crack on with this tutorial

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.219 
how about we crack on with this tutorial
so<00:01:53.460> you<00:01:53.520> want<00:01:53.790> to<00:01:53.880> get<00:01:54.000> things<00:01:54.180> slide<00:01:54.540> with<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:54.869> 9

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
so you want to get things slide with a 9

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.020 
so you want to get things slide with a 9
by<00:01:55.439> 3<00:01:55.710> area<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.430> first<00:01:56.700> thing<00:01:56.850> that<00:01:56.969> you

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
by 3 area and the first thing that you

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.670 
by 3 area and the first thing that you
want<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.240> do<00:01:57.329> is<00:01:57.600> find<00:01:57.990> your<00:01:58.110> middle<00:01:58.409> blocks

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
want to do is find your middle blocks

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.530 
want to do is find your middle blocks
and<00:01:58.890> place<00:01:59.369> down<00:01:59.759> your<00:02:00.000> double<00:02:00.360> piston

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
and place down your double piston

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.330 
and place down your double piston
extenders<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.259> then<00:02:01.649> you<00:02:01.740> want<00:02:01.890> to<00:02:01.950> head<00:02:02.070> over

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
extenders and then you want to head over

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.700 
extenders and then you want to head over
to<00:02:02.460> this<00:02:02.670> side<00:02:02.969> and<00:02:03.180> place<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:03.840> sticky<00:02:04.500> piston

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
to this side and place a sticky piston

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.639 
to this side and place a sticky piston
facing<00:02:05.219> in<00:02:05.729> towards<00:02:06.420> these<00:02:06.630> two<00:02:06.899> and<00:02:07.110> we're

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
facing in towards these two and we're

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.770 
facing in towards these two and we're
going<00:02:07.680> to<00:02:07.950> be<00:02:08.009> placing<00:02:08.520> some<00:02:08.970> dummy<00:02:09.209> blocks<00:02:09.539> in

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
going to be placing some dummy blocks in

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.360 
going to be placing some dummy blocks in
these<00:02:10.140> are<00:02:10.259> your<00:02:10.379> door<00:02:10.560> blocks<00:02:10.860> but<00:02:11.129> they're

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
these are your door blocks but they're

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.800 
these are your door blocks but they're
not<00:02:11.489> the<00:02:11.580> proper<00:02:11.849> ones<00:02:12.030> because<00:02:12.450> things<00:02:12.720> will

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
not the proper ones because things will

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.460 
not the proper ones because things will
get<00:02:12.930> miss<00:02:13.200> Shea

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
as you place down the blocks but anyway

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.090 
as you place down the blocks but anyway
now<00:02:15.540> you<00:02:15.600> want<00:02:15.810> to<00:02:15.870> head<00:02:15.990> down<00:02:16.020> here<00:02:16.440> and<00:02:16.590> place

a<00:03:04.860> comparator<00:03:05.190> running<00:03:06.060> out<00:03:06.210> of<00:03:06.690> that<00:03:06.900> hopper

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
a comparator running out of that hopper

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.570 
a comparator running out of that hopper
there<00:03:07.440> and<00:03:07.650> that's<00:03:07.980> going<00:03:08.190> to<00:03:08.280> be<00:03:08.400> running

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
there and that's going to be running

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.720 
there and that's going to be running
into<00:03:08.940> a<00:03:09.030> block<00:03:09.480> just<00:03:09.660> like<00:03:09.870> that<00:03:10.170> one<00:03:10.730> still

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
into a block just like that one still

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.280 
into a block just like that one still
staying<00:03:12.060> over<00:03:12.330> this<00:03:12.480> side<00:03:12.720> you<00:03:12.930> just<00:03:12.960> want<00:03:13.260> to

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
staying over this side you just want to

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.380 
staying over this side you just want to
place<00:03:13.500> a<00:03:13.680> half<00:03:13.980> slab<00:03:14.280> with<00:03:14.790> a<00:03:14.820> repeater

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
place a half slab with a repeater

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.570 
place a half slab with a repeater
running<00:03:16.050> out<00:03:16.230> from<00:03:16.560> this<00:03:16.770> redstone<00:03:17.190> torch

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
running out from this redstone torch

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.370 
running out from this redstone torch
here<00:03:17.640> there's<00:03:18.180> going<00:03:18.390> to<00:03:18.480> be<00:03:18.570> on<00:03:18.750> the<00:03:18.900> edge<00:03:19.110> of

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
here there's going to be on the edge of

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:20.780 
here there's going to be on the edge of
this<00:03:19.560> block<00:03:19.890> then<00:03:20.160> you<00:03:20.250> want<00:03:20.400> to<00:03:20.459> place<00:03:20.610> a

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
this block then you want to place a

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.120 
this block then you want to place a
block<00:03:21.000> up<00:03:21.239> like<00:03:21.420> this<00:03:21.630> and<00:03:21.840> once<00:03:22.350> again<00:03:22.500> two

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
block up like this and once again two

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.910 
block up like this and once again two
half<00:03:23.430> slabs<00:03:23.790> with<00:03:24.300> repeaters<00:03:24.870> on<00:03:25.050> top<00:03:25.620> so<00:03:25.800> in

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
half slabs with repeaters on top so in

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.560 
half slabs with repeaters on top so in
total<00:03:26.250> you<00:03:26.400> should<00:03:26.610> have<00:03:26.820> three<00:03:27.120> ticks<00:03:27.390> but

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
total you should have three ticks but

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.090 
total you should have three ticks but
anyway<00:03:27.840> now<00:03:28.320> you<00:03:28.380> just<00:03:28.590> want<00:03:28.770> to<00:03:28.830> place<00:03:28.950> a

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
anyway now you just want to place a

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.280 
anyway now you just want to place a
block<00:03:29.250> down<00:03:29.550> here<00:03:29.820> some<00:03:30.330> redstone<00:03:30.570> dust<00:03:30.989> and

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
block down here some redstone dust and

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.410 
block down here some redstone dust and
then<00:03:31.440> a<00:03:31.560> repeater<00:03:31.980> set<00:03:32.610> it<00:03:32.730> to<00:03:32.850> three<00:03:33.090> ticks

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
then a repeater set it to three ticks

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.570 
then a repeater set it to three ticks
running<00:03:34.080> into<00:03:34.380> a<00:03:34.410> block<00:03:34.890> with<00:03:35.160> another

running into a block with another
repeater<00:03:35.970> just<00:03:36.690> on<00:03:36.870> one<00:03:37.050> ticks<00:03:37.320> running<00:03:37.650> into

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
repeater just on one ticks running into

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.760 
repeater just on one ticks running into
this<00:03:38.040> bomb<00:03:38.280> piston<00:03:38.730> here<00:03:39.410> then<00:03:40.410> you<00:03:40.560> want<00:03:40.739> to

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:40.770 
this bomb piston here then you want to

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:42.320 
this bomb piston here then you want to
go<00:03:40.890> back<00:03:41.100> over<00:03:41.130> to<00:03:41.489> the<00:03:41.580> middle<00:03:41.820> place<00:03:42.120> a

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
go back over to the middle place a

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.330 
go back over to the middle place a
repeater<00:03:42.540> set<00:03:43.140> it<00:03:43.260> to<00:03:43.410> four<00:03:43.680> ticks<00:03:43.920> running

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
repeater set it to four ticks running

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.150 
repeater set it to four ticks running
into<00:03:44.610> a<00:03:44.670> block<00:03:44.970> with<00:03:45.450> a<00:03:45.480> sticky<00:03:45.989> piston<00:03:46.200> and<00:03:46.590> a

block<00:03:47.459> on<00:03:47.700> his<00:03:47.850> face<00:03:48.120> then<00:03:48.480> a<00:03:48.600> repeater<00:03:49.019> set<00:03:49.440> it

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
block on his face then a repeater set it

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.800 
block on his face then a repeater set it
to<00:03:49.680> two<00:03:49.980> ticks<00:03:50.280> with<00:03:50.790> redstone<00:03:51.300> dust<00:03:51.450> there

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
to two ticks with redstone dust there

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.050 
to two ticks with redstone dust there
and<00:03:51.989> then<00:03:52.500> a<00:03:52.530> block<00:03:53.130> like<00:03:53.310> this<00:03:53.370> and<00:03:53.519> a<00:03:53.820> block

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
and then a block like this and a block

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.970 
and then a block like this and a block
like<00:03:54.239> this<00:03:54.300> weave<00:03:54.840> redstone<00:03:55.320> dust<00:03:55.530> on<00:03:55.769> and<00:03:55.890> up

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
like this weave redstone dust on and up

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.370 
like this weave redstone dust on and up
like<00:03:56.160> that<00:03:56.430> and<00:03:56.640> then<00:03:57.209> a<00:03:57.420> block<00:03:57.750> down<00:03:58.019> here

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
like that and then a block down here

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.229 
like that and then a block down here
with<00:03:58.800> a<00:03:58.890> repeater<00:03:59.280> said<00:03:59.610> it's<00:03:59.730> a<00:03:59.820> four<00:04:00.000> tix

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
with a repeater said it's a four tix

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.300 
with a repeater said it's a four tix
running<00:04:00.540> into<00:04:00.750> a<00:04:00.780> block<00:04:01.110> with<00:04:01.620> redstone<00:04:01.860> dust

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
running into a block with redstone dust

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.640 
running into a block with redstone dust
on<00:04:02.489> the<00:04:02.640> top<00:04:02.870> now<00:04:03.870> what<00:04:04.050> you<00:04:04.140> have<00:04:04.170> to<00:04:04.350> remember

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
on the top now what you have to remember

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.530 
on the top now what you have to remember
is<00:04:05.040> that<00:04:05.280> all<00:04:05.580> of<00:04:05.610> these<00:04:05.820> books<00:04:06.150> here<00:04:06.330> are

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
is that all of these books here are

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:07.910 
is that all of these books here are
going<00:04:06.660> to<00:04:06.750> make<00:04:06.930> the<00:04:07.050> floor<00:04:07.320> of<00:04:07.500> your<00:04:07.650> door<00:04:07.800> and

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
going to make the floor of your door and

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.530 
going to make the floor of your door and
then<00:04:08.310> obviously<00:04:08.489> these<00:04:08.940> are<00:04:09.120> going<00:04:09.239> to<00:04:09.330> be<00:04:09.450> the

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
then obviously these are going to be the

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.479 
then obviously these are going to be the
walls<00:04:09.750> but<00:04:10.019> we'll<00:04:10.170> add<00:04:10.380> those<00:04:10.590> in<00:04:10.769> in<00:04:10.920> a<00:04:11.220> couple

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
walls but we'll add those in in a couple

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:14.210 
walls but we'll add those in in a couple
of<00:04:11.580> seconds<00:04:12.200> then<00:04:13.200> next<00:04:13.530> to<00:04:13.709> this<00:04:13.860> redstone

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
of seconds then next to this redstone

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.650 
of seconds then next to this redstone
you<00:04:14.459> just<00:04:14.640> want<00:04:14.760> to<00:04:14.820> place<00:04:14.970> a<00:04:15.120> block<00:04:15.269> with

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
you just want to place a block with

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.780 
you just want to place a block with
redstone<00:04:15.959> dust<00:04:16.440> on<00:04:16.680> top<00:04:16.950> and<00:04:17.400> then<00:04:17.580> you<00:04:17.640> want

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 
redstone dust on top and then you want

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.539 
redstone dust on top and then you want
to<00:04:17.820> create<00:04:18.090> this<00:04:18.450> shape<00:04:18.780> here<00:04:19.200> and<00:04:19.410> place<00:04:20.310> a

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
to create this shape here and place a

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.510 
to create this shape here and place a
repeater<00:04:20.790> set<00:04:21.660> it<00:04:21.810> a<00:04:21.930> one<00:04:22.140> tick<00:04:22.470> one<00:04:23.010> tick<00:04:23.340> and

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
repeater set it a one tick one tick and

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.850 
repeater set it a one tick one tick and
then<00:04:23.789> two<00:04:24.120> ticks<00:04:24.390> there<00:04:24.630> and<00:04:24.810> that<00:04:25.410> is<00:04:25.590> your

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
then two ticks there and that is your

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:26.810 
then two ticks there and that is your
bottom<00:04:26.250> part

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
bottom part

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.510 
bottom part
done<00:04:27.090> finally<00:04:27.810> so<00:04:28.800> let's<00:04:28.980> give<00:04:29.160> it<00:04:29.190> a<00:04:29.310> quick

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
done finally so let's give it a quick

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.250 
done finally so let's give it a quick
test<00:04:29.700> if<00:04:30.060> we<00:04:30.210> flick<00:04:30.510> our<00:04:30.690> lever<00:04:30.960> which<00:04:31.230> is

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
test if we flick our lever which is

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.630 
test if we flick our lever which is
going<00:04:31.560> to<00:04:31.650> be<00:04:31.740> placed<00:04:31.950> on<00:04:32.070> this<00:04:32.190> block<00:04:32.430> you

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:32.640 
going to be placed on this block you

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.520 
going to be placed on this block you
will<00:04:32.970> see<00:04:33.180> that<00:04:33.390> we<00:04:33.630> get<00:04:33.840> these<00:04:34.050> two<00:04:34.290> blocks

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
will see that we get these two blocks

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:35.930 
will see that we get these two blocks
come<00:04:34.740> up<00:04:34.860> and<00:04:34.980> then<00:04:35.190> we<00:04:35.310> get<00:04:35.430> our<00:04:35.580> double

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
come up and then we get our double

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.150 
come up and then we get our double
extender<00:04:36.150> out<00:04:36.510> the<00:04:36.660> back<00:04:36.840> as<00:04:37.050> well<00:04:37.410> and<00:04:37.680> then

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
extender out the back as well and then

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.590 
extender out the back as well and then
when<00:04:38.340> we<00:04:38.460> flick<00:04:38.670> this<00:04:38.790> lever<00:04:39.000> again<00:04:39.300> you<00:04:39.480> will

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
when we flick this lever again you will

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.240 
when we flick this lever again you will
see<00:04:39.660> that<00:04:39.840> we<00:04:40.080> got<00:04:40.260> our<00:04:40.380> two<00:04:40.560> blog<00:04:40.770> retraction

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
see that we got our two blog retraction

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.520 
see that we got our two blog retraction
and<00:04:41.340> also<00:04:41.970> our<00:04:42.180> double<00:04:42.540> piston<00:04:42.720> extension<00:04:43.350> so

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
and also our double piston extension so

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.710 
and also our double piston extension so
I<00:04:43.560> would<00:04:43.890> consider<00:04:44.190> that<00:04:44.400> to<00:04:44.580> be<00:04:44.610> a<00:04:44.910> bit<00:04:45.480> of<00:04:45.630> a

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
I would consider that to be a bit of a

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.620 
I would consider that to be a bit of a
success<00:04:46.550> now<00:04:47.550> would<00:04:47.850> probably<00:04:48.030> be<00:04:48.270> a<00:04:48.390> good

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630 
success now would probably be a good

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.030 
success now would probably be a good
time<00:04:48.840> to<00:04:48.870> start<00:04:49.230> adding<00:04:49.470> in<00:04:49.590> all<00:04:49.800> of<00:04:49.920> the

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.040 
time to start adding in all of the

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.530 
time to start adding in all of the
pistons<00:04:50.460> for<00:04:50.550> the<00:04:50.640> rest<00:04:50.850> of<00:04:50.940> the<00:04:51.030> door<00:04:51.210> so<00:04:51.240> you

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:51.540 
pistons for the rest of the door so you

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.390 
pistons for the rest of the door so you
just<00:04:51.810> want<00:04:51.960> to<00:04:51.990> take<00:04:52.260> on<00:04:52.500> top<00:04:52.950> of<00:04:53.040> this<00:04:53.130> block

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
just want to take on top of this block

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.890 
just want to take on top of this block
you<00:04:53.610> want<00:04:53.700> to<00:04:53.820> place<00:04:53.970> three<00:04:54.270> Pistons<00:04:54.780> and

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
you want to place three Pistons and

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.080 
you want to place three Pistons and
three<00:04:55.770> pistons<00:04:56.220> like<00:04:56.400> that<00:04:56.580> and<00:04:56.940> it's<00:04:57.060> the

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 
three pistons like that and it's the

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:58.220 
three pistons like that and it's the
same<00:04:57.300> thing<00:04:57.450> on<00:04:57.540> the<00:04:57.600> other<00:04:57.630> side<00:04:57.960> where<00:04:58.170> you

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:58.230 
same thing on the other side where you

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:59.390 
same thing on the other side where you
just<00:04:58.380> want<00:04:58.560> to<00:04:58.590> take<00:04:58.770> them<00:04:58.920> up<00:04:59.040> from<00:04:59.250> that

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
just want to take them up from that

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.000 
just want to take them up from that
repeater<00:04:59.730> and<00:04:59.970> go<00:05:00.630> up<00:05:00.870> one<00:05:01.110> more<00:05:01.140> and<00:05:01.500> then

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010 
repeater and go up one more and then

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.130 
repeater and go up one more and then
place<00:05:02.310> your<00:05:02.340> three<00:05:02.970> pistons<00:05:03.480> like<00:05:03.660> this<00:05:03.840> so<00:05:04.080> if

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:04.140 
place your three pistons like this so if

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:05.930 
place your three pistons like this so if
we<00:05:04.260> imagine<00:05:04.470> all<00:05:04.770> of<00:05:05.250> the<00:05:05.370> blocks<00:05:05.610> are<00:05:05.850> going

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
we imagine all of the blocks are going

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.450 
we imagine all of the blocks are going
to<00:05:06.090> be<00:05:06.240> on<00:05:06.420> all<00:05:06.720> of<00:05:06.870> their<00:05:07.080> faces<00:05:07.410> then<00:05:08.130> you<00:05:08.280> can

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
to be on all of their faces then you can

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.070 
to be on all of their faces then you can
see<00:05:08.670> that<00:05:08.910> we<00:05:09.030> have<00:05:09.210> the<00:05:09.330> beginnings<00:05:09.900> of<00:05:09.990> a

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
see that we have the beginnings of a

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.020 
see that we have the beginnings of a
three<00:05:10.260> by<00:05:10.380> three<00:05:10.410> so<00:05:11.190> the<00:05:11.340> ceiling<00:05:11.670> has<00:05:11.820> to<00:05:11.850> go

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
three by three so the ceiling has to go

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:14.060 
three by three so the ceiling has to go
in<00:05:12.180> like<00:05:12.330> this<00:05:12.480> and<00:05:12.690> the<00:05:13.230> last<00:05:13.380> step<00:05:13.650> is<00:05:13.830> since

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.070 
in like this and the last step is since

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.190 
in like this and the last step is since
the<00:05:14.220> place<00:05:14.460> are<00:05:14.670> of<00:05:15.150> course<00:05:15.390> the<00:05:15.690> top<00:05:15.930> ones

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:16.200 
the place are of course the top ones

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.200 
the place are of course the top ones
here<00:05:16.470> which<00:05:16.920> we<00:05:17.100> can<00:05:17.250> just<00:05:17.460> put<00:05:17.610> in<00:05:17.760> like<00:05:17.970> that

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.210 
here which we can just put in like that

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:19.880 
here which we can just put in like that
and<00:05:18.270> then<00:05:18.600> place<00:05:18.840> our<00:05:19.050> dual<00:05:19.290> blocks<00:05:19.530> on<00:05:19.740> them

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:19.890 
and then place our dual blocks on them

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:21.650 
and then place our dual blocks on them
and<00:05:20.040> then<00:05:20.490> take<00:05:20.760> out<00:05:20.940> any<00:05:21.120> of<00:05:21.240> the<00:05:21.360> temporary

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:21.660 
and then take out any of the temporary

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.360 
and then take out any of the temporary
ones<00:05:21.930> that<00:05:22.140> we<00:05:22.230> have<00:05:22.440> left<00:05:22.680> so<00:05:23.010> there<00:05:23.250> we<00:05:23.340> go

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
ones that we have left so there we go

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.580 
ones that we have left so there we go
that<00:05:23.970> is<00:05:24.000> the<00:05:24.240> layout<00:05:24.390> now<00:05:24.870> that<00:05:25.080> we<00:05:25.170> just<00:05:25.200> have

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590 
that is the layout now that we just have

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:28.190 
that is the layout now that we just have
to<00:05:25.620> wire<00:05:25.920> it<00:05:26.100> up<00:05:26.390> what<00:05:27.390> I<00:05:27.420> would<00:05:27.600> suggest<00:05:27.780> doing

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:28.200 
to wire it up what I would suggest doing

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.380 
to wire it up what I would suggest doing
before<00:05:28.770> we<00:05:28.860> start<00:05:29.160> wiring<00:05:29.490> these<00:05:29.610> up<00:05:29.850> is<00:05:30.030> just

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:30.390 
before we start wiring these up is just

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:31.670 
before we start wiring these up is just
placing<00:05:30.780> blocks<00:05:30.990> going<00:05:31.170> all<00:05:31.380> the<00:05:31.470> way<00:05:31.500> around

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
placing blocks going all the way around

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.560 
placing blocks going all the way around
like<00:05:31.950> this<00:05:32.100> following<00:05:32.910> the<00:05:33.060> blocks<00:05:33.300> of<00:05:33.450> the

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:33.570 
like this following the blocks of the

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:35.450 
like this following the blocks of the
door<00:05:33.750> so<00:05:33.780> you<00:05:33.960> can<00:05:34.200> tell<00:05:34.440> where<00:05:34.680> I'm<00:05:34.800> going<00:05:35.130> but

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 
door so you can tell where I'm going but

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:36.710 
door so you can tell where I'm going but
anyway<00:05:35.760> you<00:05:35.820> just<00:05:35.910> want<00:05:36.210> to<00:05:36.270> place<00:05:36.420> blocks

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 
anyway you just want to place blocks

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.260 
anyway you just want to place blocks
like<00:05:36.960> this<00:05:37.200> with<00:05:37.770> redstone<00:05:38.400> dust<00:05:38.610> on<00:05:38.910> the<00:05:39.030> top

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.270 
like this with redstone dust on the top

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.390 
like this with redstone dust on the top
then<00:05:39.660> they<00:05:39.750> broke<00:05:39.960> up<00:05:40.140> like<00:05:40.320> this<00:05:40.530> a<00:05:40.770> harsh

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400 
then they broke up like this a harsh

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.790 
then they broke up like this a harsh
slab<00:05:41.670> right<00:05:41.880> here<00:05:42.180> and<00:05:42.390> then<00:05:43.050> two<00:05:43.350> blocks<00:05:43.620> like

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:43.800 
slab right here and then two blocks like

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:44.150 
slab right here and then two blocks like
that

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:44.160 
that

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.160 
that
with<00:05:44.460> redstone<00:05:44.850> dust<00:05:45.150> on<00:05:45.480> the<00:05:45.630> top<00:05:45.870> now<00:05:46.140> a

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:46.170 
with redstone dust on the top now a

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:47.600 
with redstone dust on the top now a
little<00:05:46.380> bit<00:05:46.530> of<00:05:46.650> information<00:05:46.890> is<00:05:47.370> we<00:05:47.490> don't

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:47.610 
little bit of information is we don't

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:49.970 
little bit of information is we don't
actually<00:05:47.790> need<00:05:48.240> this<00:05:48.540> back<00:05:48.780> piston<00:05:49.290> here<00:05:49.440> so

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:49.980 
actually need this back piston here so

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:51.110 
actually need this back piston here so
you<00:05:50.070> just<00:05:50.190> want<00:05:50.340> to<00:05:50.370> place<00:05:50.550> a<00:05:50.670> block<00:05:50.880> like<00:05:51.060> that

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.120 
you just want to place a block like that

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.350 
you just want to place a block like that
and<00:05:51.450> run<00:05:52.020> redstone<00:05:52.620> dust<00:05:52.910> into<00:05:53.910> that<00:05:54.120> block

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.360 
and run redstone dust into that block

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.330 
and run redstone dust into that block
this<00:05:54.720> so<00:05:55.110> that<00:05:55.620> will<00:05:55.710> do<00:05:55.860> the<00:05:55.950> first<00:05:56.160> little

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:56.340 
this so that will do the first little

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:59.000 
this so that will do the first little
part<00:05:56.610> and<00:05:57.230> finally<00:05:58.230> for<00:05:58.470> our<00:05:58.500> last<00:05:58.710> little

00:05:59.000 --> 00:05:59.010 
part and finally for our last little
