00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:44.980 
tip though that I've figured out is that

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.939 
tip though that I've figured out is that
after<00:00:45.280> each<00:00:46.090> nail<00:00:46.600> clean<00:00:47.350> up<00:00:47.500> that<00:00:47.680> glitter

around your skin if you don't do that
it's<00:00:50.500> going<00:00:50.680> to<00:00:50.770> be<00:00:50.859> very<00:00:50.890> difficult<00:00:51.489> to<00:00:51.850> get

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:52.149 
it's going to be very difficult to get

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:54.540 
it's going to be very difficult to get
it<00:00:52.239> off<00:00:52.359> once<00:00:52.629> it's<00:00:52.780> dried<00:00:53.079> that's<00:00:53.710> incredibly

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:54.550 
it off once it's dried that's incredibly

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:21.670
