who will be kicking off and receiving in

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.930 
who will be kicking off and receiving in
this<00:02:02.090> scenario<00:02:02.470> if<00:02:03.470> you<00:02:03.590> look<00:02:03.860> at<00:02:03.980> the<00:02:04.100> card<00:02:04.370> it

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
this scenario if you look at the card it

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.730 
this scenario if you look at the card it
indicates<00:02:05.450> that<00:02:05.600> the<00:02:05.780> kickoff<00:02:06.140> is<00:02:06.200> received

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
indicates that the kickoff is received

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.650 
indicates that the kickoff is received
at<00:02:06.890> the<00:02:06.920> 20-yard<00:02:07.310> line<00:02:07.460> so<00:02:08.180> we'd<00:02:08.300> start<00:02:08.510> our

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
at the 20-yard line so we'd start our

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.560 
at the 20-yard line so we'd start our
possession<00:02:09.140> there<00:02:09.850> then<00:02:10.850> the<00:02:11.030> first<00:02:11.240> down

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
possession there then the first down

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.360 
possession there then the first down
market<00:02:11.900> within<00:02:12.020> the<00:02:12.230> ten<00:02:12.500> yards<00:02:12.770> from<00:02:12.950> the<00:02:13.070> 20

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370

market within the ten yards from the 20
yard<00:02:13.400> marker<00:02:13.880> and<00:02:14.210> then<00:02:14.450> we<00:02:14.570> would<00:02:14.690> each<00:02:14.840> take

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
yard marker and then we would each take

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.110 
yard marker and then we would each take
five<00:02:15.770> cards<00:02:16.130> from<00:02:16.190> the<00:02:16.370> offensive<00:02:16.820> and<00:02:16.940> flat

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.090 

and<00:02:23.450> to<00:02:23.570> start<00:02:23.840> the<00:02:23.990> place<00:02:24.230> I<00:02:24.530> would<00:02:24.920> select

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
and to start the place I would select

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.730 
and to start the place I would select
one<00:02:25.640> part<00:02:25.970> that<00:02:26.030> I<00:02:26.210> want<00:02:26.420> to<00:02:26.540> run<00:02:26.720> place<00:02:27.560> it

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
one part that I want to run place it

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.340 
one part that I want to run place it
facedown<00:02:27.980> and<00:02:28.520> then<00:02:29.390> at<00:02:29.570> the<00:02:29.660> same<00:02:29.840> time<00:02:29.900> we

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
facedown and then at the same time we

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.440 
facedown and then at the same time we
will<00:02:30.470> turn<00:02:30.620> our<00:02:30.800> cards<00:02:31.100> over

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
will turn our cards over

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.490 
will turn our cards over
and<00:02:32.780> again<00:02:33.230> to<00:02:33.380> see<00:02:33.560> what<00:02:33.680> the<00:02:33.800> outcome<00:02:34.160> is

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
and again to see what the outcome is

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.229 
and again to see what the outcome is
Lea's<00:02:36.500> called<00:02:36.800> a<00:02:36.890> 10<00:02:37.099> yard<00:02:37.250> draw<00:02:37.580> play<00:02:37.880> against

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
Lea's called a 10 yard draw play against

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:41.260 
Lea's called a 10 yard draw play against
my<00:02:38.330> run<00:02:38.569> defense<00:02:39.520> looking<00:02:40.520> at<00:02:40.610> my<00:02:40.730> card<00:02:41.090> he<00:02:41.239> has

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
my run defense looking at my card he has

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.630 
my run defense looking at my card he has
a<00:02:41.360> brown<00:02:41.780> card<00:02:42.140> so<00:02:42.500> the<00:02:42.890> result<00:02:43.220> of<00:02:43.370> the<00:02:43.459> play

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
a brown card so the result of the play

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.729 
a brown card so the result of the play
would<00:02:43.849> be<00:02:43.910> no<00:02:44.150> game<00:02:44.450> we've<00:02:45.110> moved<00:02:45.380> the<00:02:45.560> down

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
would be no game we've moved the down

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:47.890 
would be no game we've moved the down
marker<00:02:46.220> to<00:02:46.340> 2nd<00:02:46.730> down<00:02:46.880> and<00:02:46.940> we<00:02:47.420> do<00:02:47.599> the<00:02:47.750> same

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
marker to 2nd down and we do the same

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.420 
marker to 2nd down and we do the same
thing<00:02:48.140> again<00:02:48.260> by<00:02:48.560> dropping<00:02:48.950> a<00:02:49.010> card<00:02:49.280> on

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430
