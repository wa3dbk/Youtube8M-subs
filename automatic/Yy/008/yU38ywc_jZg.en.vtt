Pacific Northwest and we were part of it
so<00:02:26.170> that<00:02:27.170> was<00:02:27.319> what<00:02:27.500> I<00:02:27.530> did<00:02:27.620> for<00:02:27.980> many<00:02:28.190> years<00:02:28.400> I

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
so that was what I did for many years I

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.339 
so that was what I did for many years I
ran<00:02:28.730> the<00:02:28.910> two<00:02:29.060> companies<00:02:29.300> I<00:02:29.690> don't<00:02:30.170> have

ran the two companies I don't have

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:32.570 
ran the two companies I don't have
current<00:02:30.680> designs<00:02:30.980> in

it still exists and I'm still involved

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.310 
it still exists and I'm still involved
but<00:02:35.460> I<00:02:35.490> don't<00:02:36.030> run<00:02:36.240> it<00:02:36.390> and<00:02:36.540> that's<00:02:36.870> okay<00:02:37.290> with

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
but I don't run it and that's okay with

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:44.510 
but I don't run it and that's okay with
me<00:02:37.500> because<00:02:37.800> I<00:02:37.980> have<00:02:38.070> my<00:02:38.220> hands<00:02:38.430> full<00:02:43.520> although

that offers spectacular views and a huge

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.110 
that offers spectacular views and a huge
variety<00:02:57.540> of<00:02:57.870> wildlife<00:02:58.440> but<00:02:58.860> strong<00:02:59.790> tidal

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
variety of wildlife but strong tidal

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.730 
variety of wildlife but strong tidal
currents<00:03:00.540> and<00:03:00.660> prevalent<00:03:01.110> winds<00:03:01.260> make<00:03:01.710> a

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
currents and prevalent winds make a

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.830 
currents and prevalent winds make a
paddle<00:03:02.190> out<00:03:02.310> a<00:03:02.340> challenging<00:03:03.030> one<00:03:03.120> and<00:03:03.420> so

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
paddle out a challenging one and so

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.990 
paddle out a challenging one and so
Brian<00:03:04.140> created<00:03:04.560> the<00:03:04.650> discovery<00:03:05.160> shuttle<00:03:05.580> so

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
Brian created the discovery shuttle so

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.699 
Brian created the discovery shuttle so
that<00:03:06.209> all<00:03:06.420> levels<00:03:06.870> of<00:03:06.990> paddlers<00:03:07.260> could

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
that all levels of paddlers could

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:32.000 
that all levels of paddlers could
experience<00:03:08.160> the<00:03:08.430> beauty<00:03:08.730> of<00:03:08.970> Discovery<00:03:09.630> I'll

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.699 

so<00:03:33.010> we<00:03:33.310> built<00:03:33.549> a<00:03:33.730> boat<00:03:33.879> that<00:03:34.180> is<00:03:34.709> purpose-built

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
so we built a boat that is purpose-built

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:38.910 
so we built a boat that is purpose-built
I<00:03:36.069> say<00:03:36.909> if<00:03:37.150> there's<00:03:37.420> beauty<00:03:38.260> and<00:03:38.409> function

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
I say if there's beauty and function

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.679 
I say if there's beauty and function
well<00:03:39.159> I<00:03:39.459> guess<00:03:39.700> we<00:03:39.879> have<00:03:40.000> a<00:03:40.030> beautiful<00:03:40.329> boat

00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:40.689 
well I guess we have a beautiful boat

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:43.199 
well I guess we have a beautiful boat
although<00:03:40.930> it's<00:03:41.290> functional<00:03:42.189> and<00:03:42.849> I<00:03:43.000> don't

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
although it's functional and I don't

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:46.740 
although it's functional and I don't
consider<00:03:43.629> it<00:03:43.750> a<00:03:44.049> real<00:03:44.459> beauty<00:03:45.459> but<00:03:46.120> it's<00:03:46.269> cool

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
consider it a real beauty but it's cool

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.589 
consider it a real beauty but it's cool
it's<00:03:47.590> a<00:03:47.680> landing<00:03:48.159> craft<00:03:48.189> type<00:03:48.879> boat<00:03:49.180> that<00:03:49.510> we

00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:49.599 
it's a landing craft type boat that we

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:51.390 
it's a landing craft type boat that we
can<00:03:49.780> come<00:03:49.989> right<00:03:50.019> up<00:03:50.349> on<00:03:50.500> the<00:03:50.590> beach<00:03:50.739> walk<00:03:51.189> up

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
can come right up on the beach walk up

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
can come right up on the beach walk up
on<00:03:51.609> it<00:03:51.790> and<00:03:52.030> we<00:03:52.810> greet<00:03:53.079> you<00:03:53.400> help<00:03:54.400> you<00:03:54.609> get

when you come out to Discovery Island
it's<00:04:46.630> like<00:04:46.810> you're<00:04:47.020> a<00:04:47.050> thousand<00:04:47.650> miles<00:04:47.830> away

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:48.100 
it's like you're a thousand miles away

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.560 
it's like you're a thousand miles away
