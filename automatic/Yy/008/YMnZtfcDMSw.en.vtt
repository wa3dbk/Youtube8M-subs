00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.600
 because it happened to me not later 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.920
 that yesterday she want you to see that I 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.960
 looks pretty fit for someone who 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.880
 was really really good at 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.250
 view but I followed all the advice 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.990
 that since any little mother gives it 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.880
 we have never been very drugs in 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.960
 the family not even at all when I 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.180
 take a medicine that's really I 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.720
 am very very very bad often goes 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.909
 ill 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.409
 frankly there I think it's rather 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:27.990
 the accumulated fatigue at the ride on the 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:30.030
 seaside in still reading mode 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.170
 been so I had signed charny drop ni 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.909
 nothing at all that's where I caught 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.409
 cold but at least I will not do it again 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.890
 there I think I took a good 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.869
 lesson 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.009
 and on top of that it gave me one of 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.119
 videos so I want to say that 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.560
 ask the people 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.270
 if you are a little bit wicked in this 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.340
 moment and bookeen rise we send you

 with the rest of the video 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.320
 there are days like that where despite 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.600
 the usual envy of staying in bed on 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.880
 feel that something else is wrong 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.759
 we are a little tired with a stuffy nose 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.470
 like me a little sore throat full of 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.149
 these symptoms that make this day 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.330
 will be much better if we pass it to 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.670
 read this is my personal routine when he 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:16.380
 I happen to catch cold 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:18.540
 I hope it can help you 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.400
 first thing I do when he 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.870
 I happen to be bad it's my job and 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.180
 the hair I immediately 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.590
 the impression that it gives me ideas 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.890
 clearer I do not know if you're 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.890
 like me 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.670
 then my first advice is to 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.590
 organize a comfortable place 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:37.270
 we also do not forget to cover ourselves 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.270
 to stay warm 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.840
 after making my bed I can 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.910
 organize the small essential so of 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.020
 my day i 'm going to put that on my 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.090
 night table so I 'll clear 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.310
 really a place where to have everything to 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.200
 handy I start with water 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.570
 to properly hydrate a spray for the 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.580
 nose of the special cream dry areas 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:06.010
 homeopathic granules to help 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.380
 cure my cold natural vitamin 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.540
 to boost my body is a balm to 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.580
 lips to promise lips and 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:16.360
 plug it's really obvious when 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.980
 we have a cold I want to say other 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.360
 not insignificant trick bring back a 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.260
 trash near his bed that avoids 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.240
 to really put the tissues 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.560
 anywhere I also report some 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.910
 newspapers always better than the computer 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.990
 especially when you have a headache 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.940
 during the cold we do not hesitate to 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:35.640
 to abuse the clogging is really the 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.640
 best way to heal believe me 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.450
 then I do not hesitate to spread it 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:43.489
 cream the outline of the nose and eyes that 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.879
 are very dry areas in these 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:45.879
 periods 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:58.330
 of course I do the same thing 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.770
 with a lip balm because the 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.300
 lips often take a hit 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:04.000
 especially when you breathe through your mouth 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:06.640
 when we bush years and other tips 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.260

 and when we spend a day in his 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.880
 bed is still good way to do 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.880

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.190
