00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:08.849
 for everyone as it is and without coming is the corner and oriental dance 

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:10.510
 chievo 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:12.289
 with a new movement 

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:15.589
 that this kind of facts made to order and has done it more than start 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.090
 also some people and it was not a normal night in the end 

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:24.440
 deliberate delays do not seem fair to us 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.929
 in the nomenclature that I think it is more clear to identify 

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:31.589
 what do I know the direction to the west backwards made in the above the chest 

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:33.850
 up 8 and down 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.810
 I hope not to hurt sensibilities in this aspect because you think you are very purist 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.540
 percent let's now work this 8 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.680
 from the equity technique, that is, we are not going to bend the knees 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.760
 we will cover all the time with the knee assisting more 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.400
 this movement that you have had me other dementias are not goals is 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.330
 insisting the delegation will go until today 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:03.210
 because he considered that to get to him we had to do other things before and have 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.190
 very clear some 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.149
 thematic of basic technique and that's why 

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:10.940
 I have seen that you review borrower laws 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.549
 in the case that there exists and is some annoyance mesquida this agreement 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:18.009
 the hotels you have to review sun 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:22.509
 the tutorial 1 in which we saw the stance of basic chemistry very important 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:24.510
 to materialize these movements 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.290
 Do not let the coccyx go back 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.690
 in the review of the movement of football normally pendular and we will see with 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:32.790
 some variant 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.270
 I was going to know that review also the movement of the twist seen all this I 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.150
 I think we're ready to start the tutorial on the pocho back 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.150
 beyond 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.420
 we will comment by marking with 'twixt' with the left hip forward 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.570
 and making a swing 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.570
 from the right the left 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.670
 if you realize it is not the centered position but in tourist 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.860
 we do it the same with the other side 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.909
 with the right hip forward 

00:02:09.909 --> 00:02:12.909
 and the left delayed and back 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:20.039
 we wanted to have a start of the year 

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:24.479
 what for if you are aware that it is not the swinging movement from right to 

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:26.189
 normal left 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:28.179
 but you have to 

00:02:28.179 --> 00:02:30.009
 towers 

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:33.329
 make a fusion with the hip 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:35.549
 balance after 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:37.759
 from one side to the other the weight 

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:41.049
 the same thing on the other side 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:44.049
 I suppose you can appreciate what 

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:49.759
 It's very important 

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:53.819
 that you remember that the coccyx can not point backwards but that you have to 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.339
 have the pelvis fit 

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:59.759
 let's see now this movement 

00:02:59.759 --> 00:03:03.229
 I start with tourists like this on the left and let it be left hip 

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:06.529
 get yourself there was a twist back 

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:10.099
 then with the singer so things 

00:03:10.619 --> 00:03:14.999
 twixt left back kim bids the weight 

00:03:14.999 --> 00:03:17.999
 cristinista back 

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:20.549
 and so on constantly 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:24.389
 trying to make the movement as fluid as possible 

00:03:25.619 --> 00:03:28.679
 it is very important that when 

00:03:28.679 --> 00:03:34.289
 some swinging with tennis lines are included 

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:41.079
 the movement starts very slowly and little by little it will be speeding 

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:13.699
 let's see again the movement 

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:26.189
 very slow 

00:04:26.189 --> 00:04:28.099
 Weight unveiling 

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:33.029
 and incorporating the twist swinging with 'twixt' that made traspalacio cuntis 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.650
 and back 

00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:38.509
 remember 

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:42.589
 that the legs should be respected you should not bend the knees 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:46.909
 and try that the trunk does not move 

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:49.909
 let the breast always move forward 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:51.939
 although logically 

00:04:51.939 --> 00:04:54.340
 there's always going to be 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.629
 a kind of response in it 

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:59.300
 since we are not elche it is because of what it is 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.080
 but we are a body 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.080
 United 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.370
 but shows side 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.370
 remember the position of the pelvis 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.889
 note how the country is part and extortion back 

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:33.680
 if you have doubts write me 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.939
 nowadays not a video so there may be 

00:05:35.939 --> 00:05:37.650
 how are you specializing 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:41.670
 and what are the problems you find when making this 

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:44.669
 movement 

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:49.659
 I am here to help us as much as possible 

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:57.110
 I will show you the movement 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:00.110
 behind 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.360
 thank you very much to everyone for watching 

00:06:05.089 --> 00:06:08.029
 I feel in the delay has made see this video 

00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:11.029
 for computer reasons that activate viruses 

00:06:11.629 --> 00:06:12.660
 see you 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:14.600
 in the next days until soon
