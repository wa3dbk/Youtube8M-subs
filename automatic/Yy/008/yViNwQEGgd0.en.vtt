00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:22.330
 hello today we are going to prepare a sweet of 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:28.640
 dates and 9 the ingredients very easy 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:32.750
 we have half a kilo of dates 200 of 9 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:36.290
 also 100 centiliters of honey 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.880
 from here also like a glass and a half of 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:42.170
 milk 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:45.109
 two teaspoons of butter too 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:50.479
 vanilla sugar that can also be 

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:52.640
 in droplets and a little salt we are going to 

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:53.829
 put this recipe the first thing we're going to 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.590
 do 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:01:00.640
 extract the data bone 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.640
 we will remove all 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.910
 and once we take it out 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.290
 we make ourselves 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.400
 to chop 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.400
 very tiny 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.800
 and 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.100
 we have chopped the dates of infinity and 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.090
 Now I was entering the pike 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.090
 the nuts 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.940
 I have reserved a few 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.390
 to decoration 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:50.080
 once it is finished 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:53.160
 the sweet cake 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.160
 or as we want to call 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:00.630
 now in a pan let's put the 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:05.539
 milk over low heat 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.539
 As I told you, the 350 milk 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:13.620
 and we are also going to put 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.620
 the 100 centiliters of honey 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.170
 this is simmering 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:27.320
 once we have put the honey 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:29.740
 well, we're going to put the sugar 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.740
 vanilla 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.069
 and like a little bit of that 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.290
 Oh 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.150
 And now simmered until 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:45.400
 start boiling 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.580
 or if I'm here now let's add the 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.850
 data 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:52.390
 we have already cut very small 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.390
 A) Yes 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.310
 and also the dead ones 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.430
 we are going to see all this 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:17.130
 and let's boil 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:20.810
 and let's see the bottom of the pan 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.810
 all that will be simmering 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:29.540
 well come to this point you see I see 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:32.180
 the pan because this would be the moment 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:35.299
 to remove it we will have it in a 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:38.510
 we'll let him cool down and let him 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:40.909
 we will give the shape that we like the most 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:44.120
 well as you know I already have a lot 

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:45.960
 patience I'm going to make an invention to see 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.210
 if I get it right 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:51.600
 if I get it right it will be fantastic 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:53.140
 I'm going to make a scream like it's your 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:57.240
 children 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.240
 the butter is here 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.050
 so that later you can 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:04.920
 and also from what 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:06.870
 in this case as we will not use 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.360
 the gadget because we will not use 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.140
 neither the butter 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:14.800
 I'm going to see if this invention comes to me 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:16.719
 as I tell you if it comes out I think it's going to 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:19.009
 look very nice 

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:20.389
 this would ideally be cool 

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:21.750
 but as not ours we are going to have 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:24.770
 watch out 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.770
 We are going to use 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:29.340
 and we are going to talk to him 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.830
 a round shape look how good it has 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.830
 perfect 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:36.660
 to follow 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.660
 giving it that way we want 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:45.520
 besides this is a very sweet sweet very 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:48.220
 caloric and we're going to be very careful to 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.790
 the time to eat I'm fat 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:50.790
 quite 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.380
 this is 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:58.289
 what we will do to be able to x also 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:00.750
 it will be put in the fridge and when 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:02.729
 very cold even I would say in the 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:05.669
 freezer when it is very cold what 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:07.440
 we will take out with that other powder that we 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:12.210
 has been 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:16.650
 of 986 we will make a batter but that already 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:19.630
 It will be once the roll is cold I hope 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:22.230
 what you liked is great 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:22.230
 bye
