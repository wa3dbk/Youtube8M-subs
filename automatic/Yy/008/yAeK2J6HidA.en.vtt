00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.749 
releasing a puff of smoke the most
amazing<00:02:07.259> thing<00:02:07.530> is<00:02:07.740> that<00:02:07.770> if<00:02:08.099> indeed<00:02:08.520> this

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
amazing thing is that if indeed this

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.150 
amazing thing is that if indeed this
footage<00:02:09.149> was<00:02:09.300> shot<00:02:09.569> from<00:02:09.810> 70<00:02:10.349> miles<00:02:10.590> above<00:02:11.039> the

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
footage was shot from 70 miles above the

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
footage was shot from 70 miles above the
lunar<00:02:11.310> surface

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
lunar surface

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.270 
lunar surface
well<00:02:12.540> then<00:02:12.690> this<00:02:12.780> object<00:02:13.020> must<00:02:13.470> be<00:02:13.650> thousands

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
well then this object must be thousands

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.360 
well then this object must be thousands
of<00:02:14.610> feet<00:02:14.850> tall<00:02:15.150> and<00:02:15.860> considering<00:02:16.860> that<00:02:16.890> humans

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
of feet tall and considering that humans

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.370 
of feet tall and considering that humans
have<00:02:17.580> never<00:02:17.790> even<00:02:18.000> walked<00:02:18.360> on<00:02:18.660> the<00:02:18.780> moon<00:02:18.960> at

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
have never even walked on the moon at

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.200 
have never even walked on the moon at
this<00:02:19.830> point<00:02:20.160> that<00:02:20.430> didn't<00:02:20.640> happen<00:02:20.910> until<00:02:21.000> the

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
this point that didn't happen until the

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.110 
this point that didn't happen until the
following<00:02:21.450> year<00:02:22.110> it<00:02:23.010> is<00:02:23.070> amazing<00:02:23.970> to<00:02:24.090> think

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
following year it is amazing to think

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.570 
following year it is amazing to think
that<00:02:24.480> an<00:02:24.600> object<00:02:25.080> like<00:02:25.320> this<00:02:25.680> could<00:02:25.920> exist<00:02:26.280> on

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
that an object like this could exist on

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.310 
that an object like this could exist on
the<00:02:26.700> moon<00:02:26.880> and<00:02:27.240> of<00:02:27.510> course<00:02:27.720> it<00:02:27.870> raises<00:02:28.050> the

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
the moon and of course it raises the

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.990 
the moon and of course it raises the
whole<00:02:28.440> plethora<00:02:28.710> of<00:02:28.950> questions<00:02:29.460> about<00:02:29.610> what

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
whole plethora of questions about what

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.530 
whole plethora of questions about what
this<00:02:30.210> is<00:02:30.570> and<00:02:31.040> how<00:02:32.040> crucible<00:02:32.670> NASA<00:02:32.880> has<00:02:33.270> been

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
this is and how crucible NASA has been

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.830 
this is and how crucible NASA has been
about<00:02:34.080> what<00:02:34.770> is<00:02:35.040> on<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.520> moon<00:02:35.700> I'll<00:02:36.480> tell<00:02:36.750> you

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
about what is on the moon I'll tell you

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.570 
about what is on the moon I'll tell you
I've<00:02:37.050> been<00:02:37.230> looking<00:02:37.530> at<00:02:37.650> this<00:02:37.800> picture<00:02:38.370> all

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
I've been looking at this picture all

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.300 
I've been looking at this picture all
day<00:02:39.260> Joshua<00:02:40.260> and<00:02:40.440> then<00:02:40.590> the<00:02:40.710> series<00:02:41.130> of

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
day Joshua and then the series of

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.630 
day Joshua and then the series of
pictures<00:02:41.760> and<00:02:42.690> it<00:02:42.930> is<00:02:43.410> strange<00:02:43.830> because<00:02:44.490> you

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
pictures and it is strange because you

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.670 
pictures and it is strange because you
can<00:02:44.850> clearly<00:02:45.300> see<00:02:47.180> this<00:02:48.180> tiny<00:02:48.570> footage<00:02:49.320> as<00:02:49.650> you

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
can clearly see this tiny footage as you

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.130 
can clearly see this tiny footage as you
say<00:02:50.100> of<00:02:50.250> this<00:02:50.370> black<00:02:50.700> option<00:02:51.000> it's<00:02:51.450> got<00:02:51.720> to<00:02:51.960> be

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
say of this black option it's got to be

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.250 
say of this black option it's got to be
oh<00:02:52.910> it's<00:02:53.910> got<00:02:54.060> to<00:02:54.090> be<00:02:54.240> at<00:02:54.330> least<00:02:54.480> a<00:02:54.780> several

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
oh it's got to be at least a several

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.500 
oh it's got to be at least a several
hundred<00:02:55.290> feet<00:02:55.830> long<00:02:55.860> don't<00:02:56.400> you<00:02:56.520> think<00:02:56.790> based

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
hundred feet long don't you think based

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.290 
hundred feet long don't you think based
on<00:02:57.690> the<00:02:57.810> size<00:02:58.080> of<00:02:58.290> it<00:02:58.440> and<00:02:58.790> the<00:02:59.790> size<00:03:00.060> of<00:03:00.210> the

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
on the size of it and the size of the

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.290 
on the size of it and the size of the
moon<00:03:00.500> yeah<00:03:01.500> I<00:03:01.530> would<00:03:01.770> say<00:03:01.950> so<00:03:02.010> and<00:03:02.550> right<00:03:03.120> now

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
moon yeah I would say so and right now

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.120 
moon yeah I would say so and right now
I'm<00:03:03.510> waiting<00:03:03.690> to<00:03:04.020> get<00:03:04.170> some<00:03:04.440> more<00:03:04.590> official

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
I'm waiting to get some more official

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.340 
I'm waiting to get some more official
estimates<00:03:05.700> as<00:03:06.000> to<00:03:06.240> how<00:03:06.420> tall<00:03:06.810> this<00:03:07.140> object

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
estimates as to how tall this object

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.800 
estimates as to how tall this object
would<00:03:07.710> have<00:03:07.770> to<00:03:08.070> be<00:03:08.280> if<00:03:08.700> indeed<00:03:09.300> it<00:03:09.450> was<00:03:09.570> shot

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
would have to be if indeed it was shot

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.600 
would have to be if indeed it was shot
from<00:03:10.050> 70<00:03:10.530> miles<00:03:10.740> above<00:03:11.160> and<00:03:11.870> of<00:03:12.870> course<00:03:13.280> if<00:03:14.280> and

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
from 70 miles above and of course if and

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.700 
from 70 miles above and of course if and
of<00:03:14.880> course<00:03:15.060> there's<00:03:15.240> very<00:03:15.720> little<00:03:16.260> reason<00:03:16.680> to

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:16.710 
of course there's very little reason to

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:18.140 
of course there's very little reason to
think<00:03:16.950> that<00:03:17.130> this<00:03:17.250> could<00:03:17.310> be<00:03:17.580> some<00:03:17.790> sort<00:03:18.000> of<00:03:18.030> an

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
think that this could be some sort of an

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.910 
think that this could be some sort of an
optical<00:03:18.540> illusion<00:03:18.720> because<00:03:19.470> for<00:03:19.710> one<00:03:19.890> thing

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
optical illusion because for one thing

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.910 
optical illusion because for one thing
it<00:03:20.790> remains<00:03:21.390> stationary<00:03:21.750> on<00:03:22.470> the<00:03:22.680> lunar

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
it remains stationary on the lunar

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.490 
it remains stationary on the lunar
surface<00:03:22.950> as<00:03:23.520> the<00:03:23.550> camera<00:03:23.970> passes<00:03:24.420> by<00:03:24.630> it

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
surface as the camera passes by it

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.860 
surface as the camera passes by it
changes<00:03:26.130> as<00:03:26.340> the<00:03:26.550> cameras<00:03:27.000> perspective<00:03:27.210> is

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
changes as the cameras perspective is

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.930 
changes as the cameras perspective is
altered<00:03:28.380> and<00:03:28.590> then<00:03:29.040> of<00:03:29.130> course<00:03:29.370> this<00:03:29.610> jet

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
altered and then of course this jet

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.790 
altered and then of course this jet
light<00:03:30.150> cloud<00:03:30.510> sort<00:03:30.870> of<00:03:30.930> drifts<00:03:31.350> to<00:03:31.470> the<00:03:31.590> right

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
light cloud sort of drifts to the right

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.280 
light cloud sort of drifts to the right
and<00:03:32.190> dissipates<00:03:32.820> and<00:03:33.150> altogether<00:03:33.750> it's<00:03:34.050> very

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
and dissipates and altogether it's very

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:35.720 
and dissipates and altogether it's very
difficult<00:03:34.680> to<00:03:34.830> think<00:03:34.980> this<00:03:35.160> could<00:03:35.220> be<00:03:35.370> any

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
difficult to think this could be any

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.120 
difficult to think this could be any
sort<00:03:36.030> of<00:03:36.090> an<00:03:36.210> optical<00:03:36.660> illusion<00:03:36.750> and<00:03:37.290> if<00:03:37.890> it<00:03:38.010> is

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
sort of an optical illusion and if it is

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.550 
sort of an optical illusion and if it is
not<00:03:38.280> an<00:03:38.460> illusion<00:03:38.700> well<00:03:39.090> then<00:03:39.330> you<00:03:40.260> know<00:03:40.350> it

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
not an illusion well then you know it

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.880 
not an illusion well then you know it
raises<00:03:41.040> several<00:03:41.310> possibilities<00:03:42.530> in<00:03:43.530> my<00:03:43.830> own

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
raises several possibilities in my own

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.850 
raises several possibilities in my own
personal<00:03:44.430> opinion<00:03:44.580> of<00:03:45.150> course<00:03:45.590> some<00:03:46.590> people

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
personal opinion of course some people

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.949 
personal opinion of course some people
have<00:03:46.980> speculated<00:03:47.400> that<00:03:47.850> NASA<00:03:48.090> faked<00:03:48.570> some<00:03:48.840> of

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
have speculated that NASA faked some of

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.890 
have speculated that NASA faked some of
the<00:03:49.050> moon<00:03:49.200> footage<00:03:49.500> if<00:03:50.490> that's<00:03:50.760> if<00:03:51.720> that's

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
the moon footage if that's if that's

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.290 
the moon footage if that's if that's
correct<00:03:52.200> what's<00:03:52.709> really<00:03:53.310> even<00:03:53.580> less<00:03:53.760> likely

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:54.300 
correct what's really even less likely

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.090 
correct what's really even less likely
this<00:03:54.450> type<00:03:54.690> of<00:03:54.720> anomaly<00:03:55.350> would<00:03:55.470> appear<00:03:55.920> if

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
this type of anomaly would appear if

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.790 
this type of anomaly would appear if
they<00:03:56.250> had<00:03:56.459> control<00:03:56.880> over<00:03:57.000> the<00:03:57.330> scenery<00:03:57.810> on<00:03:58.650> the

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
they had control over the scenery on the

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.650

other hand if this footage is indeed
from<00:04:00.930> the<00:04:01.080> moon<00:04:01.400> then<00:04:02.400> it<00:04:02.550> must<00:04:02.880> indicate

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
from the moon then it must indicate

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.360 
from the moon then it must indicate
there's<00:04:03.570> some<00:04:03.810> strange<00:04:04.200> technology<00:04:04.680> up<00:04:05.130> there

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
there's some strange technology up there

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.820 
there's some strange technology up there
about<00:04:05.850> which<00:04:06.000> they've<00:04:06.240> never<00:04:06.300> told<00:04:06.690> the<00:04:06.870> truth

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
about which they've never told the truth

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:11.030 
about which they've never told the truth
if<00:04:08.130> so<00:04:08.459> who<00:04:08.910> put<00:04:09.180> it<00:04:09.270> there<00:04:09.540> humans<00:04:10.410> or<00:04:10.709> other

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
if so who put it there humans or other

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.650 
if so who put it there humans or other
intelligence<00:04:11.820> and

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
intelligence and

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.680 
intelligence and
was<00:04:12.870> its<00:04:12.990> purpose<00:04:13.230> and<00:04:13.830> of<00:04:14.730> course<00:04:15.030> if<00:04:15.330> this<00:04:15.510> is

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
was its purpose and of course if this is

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.750 
was its purpose and of course if this is
from<00:04:15.870> the<00:04:15.960> moon<00:04:16.170> and<00:04:16.530> NASA<00:04:16.739> has<00:04:17.100> never<00:04:17.310> noticed

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
from the moon and NASA has never noticed

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.050 
from the moon and NASA has never noticed
it<00:04:17.910> however<00:04:18.630> unlikely<00:04:19.519> then<00:04:20.519> they<00:04:20.670> need<00:04:20.850> to<00:04:20.940> do

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
it however unlikely then they need to do

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.390 
it however unlikely then they need to do
a<00:04:21.090> serious<00:04:21.390> and<00:04:21.840> immediate<00:04:22.170> investigation<00:04:23.160> to

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
a serious and immediate investigation to

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.050 
a serious and immediate investigation to
explain<00:04:23.940> the<00:04:24.090> anomaly<00:04:24.650> this<00:04:25.650> is<00:04:25.980> a<00:04:26.060> possible

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
explain the anomaly this is a possible

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.910 
explain the anomaly this is a possible
that<00:04:27.270> day<00:04:27.510> well<00:04:27.840> of<00:04:27.960> course<00:04:28.020> you<00:04:28.320> say<00:04:28.530> that<00:04:28.560> as

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:28.920 
that day well of course you say that as

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.860 
that day well of course you say that as
the<00:04:29.100> camera<00:04:29.550> moved<00:04:29.790> it's<00:04:30.210> stayed<00:04:30.510> stationary

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
the camera moved it's stayed stationary

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.990 
the camera moved it's stayed stationary
so<00:04:31.320> it<00:04:31.440> couldn't<00:04:31.650> have<00:04:31.710> been<00:04:31.890> a<00:04:32.000> little

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
so it couldn't have been a little

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.840 
so it couldn't have been a little
blemish<00:04:33.420> on<00:04:33.570> the<00:04:33.690> lens<00:04:33.900> right<00:04:34.320> that's<00:04:35.250> correct

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:35.850 
blemish on the lens right that's correct

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:37.730 
blemish on the lens right that's correct
something<00:04:36.390> like<00:04:36.570> lint<00:04:36.870> or<00:04:37.140> debris<00:04:37.470> on<00:04:37.710> the

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
something like lint or debris on the

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.610 
something like lint or debris on the
lens<00:04:38.420> shouldn't<00:04:39.420> behave<00:04:39.570> in<00:04:39.960> the<00:04:40.050> way<00:04:40.410> that

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
lens shouldn't behave in the way that

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.700 
lens shouldn't behave in the way that
this<00:04:40.740> does<00:04:41.040> and<00:04:41.370> it<00:04:41.460> certainly<00:04:42.270> shouldn't<00:04:42.710> you

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
this does and it certainly shouldn't you

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.740 
this does and it certainly shouldn't you
know<00:04:43.740> stay<00:04:44.040> at<00:04:44.190> that<00:04:44.220> same<00:04:44.700> spot<00:04:45.150> and<00:04:45.540> have

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
know stay at that same spot and have

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.410 
know stay at that same spot and have
that<00:04:45.990> sort<00:04:46.320> of<00:04:46.430> change<00:04:47.430> as<00:04:47.850> the<00:04:48.000> cameras

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:48.420 
that sort of change as the cameras

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:51.110 
that sort of change as the cameras
perspective<00:04:48.720> is<00:04:49.410> altered<00:04:49.830> passing<00:04:50.400> by<00:04:50.610> it<00:04:50.670> and

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
perspective is altered passing by it and

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.120 
perspective is altered passing by it and
so<00:04:51.330> there's<00:04:51.540> really<00:04:52.110> no<00:04:52.410> no<00:04:52.620> reason<00:04:52.830> to

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
so there's really no no reason to

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:54.650 
so there's really no no reason to
believe<00:04:53.250> that<00:04:53.430> it<00:04:53.760> is<00:04:53.790> some<00:04:54.300> sort<00:04:54.570> of<00:04:54.600> a

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660 
believe that it is some sort of a

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.510 
believe that it is some sort of a
blemish<00:04:55.290> or<00:04:55.440> optical<00:04:55.830> illusion<00:04:56.250> in<00:04:56.370> my

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
blemish or optical illusion in my

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.910 
blemish or optical illusion in my
opinion<00:04:56.940> and<00:04:57.750> there<00:04:57.990> does<00:04:58.260> appear<00:04:58.440> to<00:04:58.650> be<00:04:58.800> some

00:04:58.910 --> 00:04:58.920 
opinion and there does appear to be some

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:02.390 
opinion and there does appear to be some
kind<00:04:59.400> of<00:04:59.460> plume<00:04:59.880> of<00:05:00.210> smoke<00:05:00.810> or<00:05:01.410> something

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
kind of plume of smoke or something

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.030 
kind of plume of smoke or something
right<00:05:02.820> next<00:05:03.060> to<00:05:03.270> it<00:05:03.440> yes<00:05:04.440> you're<00:05:04.650> sure<00:05:04.770> enough

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:05.040 
right next to it yes you're sure enough

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.220 
right next to it yes you're sure enough
and<00:05:05.310> I<00:05:05.460> mean<00:05:05.610> it<00:05:05.850> looks<00:05:06.060> like<00:05:06.150> it's<00:05:06.480> it's

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:07.230 
and I mean it looks like it's it's

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:10.040 
and I mean it looks like it's it's
ejected<00:05:07.410> very<00:05:08.070> powerfully<00:05:08.880> from<00:05:09.540> the<00:05:09.660> top<00:05:09.870> of

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.050 
ejected very powerfully from the top of

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:12.140 
ejected very powerfully from the top of
this<00:05:10.260> and<00:05:10.590> again<00:05:10.800> that<00:05:11.100> just<00:05:11.130> very<00:05:11.790> much<00:05:11.970> like

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
this and again that just very much like

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.360 
this and again that just very much like
a<00:05:12.180> smokestack<00:05:12.840> releasing<00:05:13.620> a<00:05:13.710> puff<00:05:13.950> of<00:05:14.130> smoke

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.370 
a smokestack releasing a puff of smoke

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:17.990 
a smokestack releasing a puff of smoke
and<00:05:15.440> and<00:05:16.440> this<00:05:16.620> is<00:05:16.680> just<00:05:17.070> sticking<00:05:17.370> straight

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
and and this is just sticking straight

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.420 
and and this is just sticking straight
up<00:05:18.060> out<00:05:18.450> of<00:05:18.570> the<00:05:18.630> lunar<00:05:18.810> surface<00:05:19.280> you<00:05:20.280> could

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
up out of the lunar surface you could

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.210 
up out of the lunar surface you could
also<00:05:20.610> imagine<00:05:20.910> that<00:05:21.360> if<00:05:22.080> indeed<00:05:22.650> there<00:05:23.040> was

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:23.220 
also imagine that if indeed there was

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.340 
also imagine that if indeed there was
some<00:05:23.490> knowledge<00:05:23.760> that<00:05:24.270> some<00:05:24.540> sort<00:05:24.810> of<00:05:24.870> an

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:25.350 
some knowledge that some sort of an

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.200 
some knowledge that some sort of an
object<00:05:25.830> like<00:05:25.950> this<00:05:26.010> was<00:05:26.340> on<00:05:26.490> the<00:05:26.610> moon<00:05:26.790> it

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
object like this was on the moon it

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:29.659 
object like this was on the moon it
might<00:05:27.600> be<00:05:27.750> easy<00:05:27.960> to<00:05:28.080> assume<00:05:28.620> that<00:05:28.890> from<00:05:29.190> an

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:29.669 
might be easy to assume that from an

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:31.790 
might be easy to assume that from an
altitude<00:05:30.030> of<00:05:30.270> 70<00:05:30.780> miles<00:05:31.020> that<00:05:31.470> it<00:05:31.560> wouldn't

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
altitude of 70 miles that it wouldn't

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.180 
altitude of 70 miles that it wouldn't
show<00:05:32.040> up<00:05:32.360> nonetheless<00:05:33.710> clearly<00:05:34.710> this<00:05:34.980> did

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:35.190 
show up nonetheless clearly this did

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:37.790 
show up nonetheless clearly this did
show<00:05:35.430> up<00:05:35.640> and<00:05:35.880> so<00:05:36.120> it<00:05:36.360> could<00:05:36.750> be<00:05:36.780> a<00:05:37.140> slip-up<00:05:37.620> of

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800 
show up and so it could be a slip-up of

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.860 
show up and so it could be a slip-up of
some<00:05:38.010> kind<00:05:38.340> and<00:05:38.580> even<00:05:38.820> though<00:05:39.419> it<00:05:39.690> may<00:05:39.840> be

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:39.870 
some kind and even though it may be

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.020 
some kind and even though it may be
difficult<00:05:40.530> to<00:05:40.560> believe<00:05:40.650> that<00:05:41.100> NASA<00:05:41.340> didn't

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:42.030 
difficult to believe that NASA didn't

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:44.420 
difficult to believe that NASA didn't
notice<00:05:42.330> this<00:05:42.600> you<00:05:43.380> know<00:05:43.470> they<00:05:43.620> have<00:05:43.830> many<00:05:44.190> many

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:44.430 
notice this you know they have many many

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:47.060 
notice this you know they have many many
hours<00:05:44.910> worth<00:05:45.210> of<00:05:45.390> moon<00:05:45.570> footage<00:05:45.870> if<00:05:46.350> ironic

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:47.070 
hours worth of moon footage if ironic

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:48.830 
hours worth of moon footage if ironic
does<00:05:47.220> this<00:05:47.370> you<00:05:47.760> know<00:05:47.850> two-second<00:05:48.480> clip<00:05:48.690> would

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:48.840 
does this you know two-second clip would

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.020 
does this you know two-second clip would
make<00:05:49.050> it<00:05:49.200> on<00:05:49.350> to<00:05:49.590> the<00:05:49.620> Innova<00:05:50.310> program<00:05:50.820> without

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:53.760 
anyone realizing its significance but

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.940 
anyone realizing its significance but
still<00:05:54.090> there's<00:05:54.720> there's<00:05:55.230> no<00:05:55.350> telling<00:05:55.740> really

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:55.950 
still there's there's no telling really

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:57.860 
still there's there's no telling really
what<00:05:56.100> other<00:05:56.280> types<00:05:56.610> of<00:05:56.820> anomalies<00:05:57.090> like<00:05:57.600> this

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:57.870 
what other types of anomalies like this

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:00.350 
what other types of anomalies like this
may<00:05:58.110> be<00:05:58.350> in<00:05:58.470> the<00:05:58.560> footage<00:05:58.800> that<00:05:58.890> has<00:05:59.880> not<00:06:00.150> been

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.360

has picked up on it yet just run these

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:07.640 
has picked up on it yet just run these
pictures<00:06:05.970> now<00:06:06.120> beginning<00:06:06.510> to<00:06:06.600> make<00:06:06.720> their<00:06:07.440> way

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:07.650 
pictures now beginning to make their way

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:09.950

we<00:06:16.530> are<00:06:16.919> doing<00:06:17.190> everything<00:06:17.430> we<00:06:17.580> can<00:06:17.940> to

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.000 
we are doing everything we can to

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.080 
we are doing everything we can to
analyze<00:06:18.840> these<00:06:19.169> photographs<00:06:19.830> and<00:06:20.220> glean<00:06:20.910> as

analyze these photographs and glean as

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:23.240 
analyze these photographs and glean as
much<00:06:21.120> information<00:06:21.930> as<00:06:22.050> possible<00:06:22.320> based<00:06:22.919> upon

much information as possible based upon

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:23.959 
much information as possible based upon
them

00:06:23.959 --> 00:06:23.969 
them

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:25.579 
them
but<00:06:24.239> of<00:06:24.360> course<00:06:24.569> the<00:06:24.719> frustrating<00:06:25.349> thing

00:06:25.579 --> 00:06:25.589 
but of course the frustrating thing

00:06:25.589 --> 00:06:27.649 
but of course the frustrating thing
always<00:06:25.949> is<00:06:26.159> that<00:06:26.339> when<00:06:26.969> it<00:06:27.089> comes<00:06:27.299> to

00:06:27.649 --> 00:06:27.659 
always is that when it comes to

00:06:27.659 --> 00:06:30.079 
always is that when it comes to
information<00:06:28.469> about<00:06:28.979> the<00:06:29.039> moon<00:06:29.339> or<00:06:29.759> really

00:06:30.079 --> 00:06:30.089 
information about the moon or really

00:06:30.089 --> 00:06:32.869 
information about the moon or really
about<00:06:30.329> deep<00:06:30.599> space<00:06:30.869> in<00:06:31.139> general<00:06:31.559> we<00:06:32.459> just<00:06:32.699> have

00:06:32.869 --> 00:06:32.879 
about deep space in general we just have

00:06:32.879 --> 00:06:36.859 
about deep space in general we just have
to<00:06:33.059> rely<00:06:33.389> upon<00:06:33.959> what<00:06:34.259> what<00:06:35.129> they<00:06:35.369> say<00:06:35.759> and<00:06:36.089> of

00:06:36.859 --> 00:06:36.869 
to rely upon what what they say and of

00:06:36.869 --> 00:06:39.109 
to rely upon what what they say and of
course<00:06:37.199> we<00:06:38.039> collectively<00:06:38.579> fund<00:06:38.939> their

00:06:39.109 --> 00:06:39.119 
course we collectively fund their

00:06:39.119 --> 00:06:41.089 
course we collectively fund their
efforts<00:06:39.239> so<00:06:39.719> they<00:06:39.899> are<00:06:40.079> actually<00:06:40.259> accountable

00:06:41.089 --> 00:06:41.099 
efforts so they are actually accountable

00:06:41.099 --> 00:06:43.639 
efforts so they are actually accountable
to<00:06:41.249> us<00:06:41.399> and<00:06:41.849> we<00:06:42.299> deserve<00:06:42.449> to<00:06:42.659> have<00:06:43.019> truth<00:06:43.349> but

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:43.649 
to us and we deserve to have truth but

00:06:43.649 --> 00:06:45.679 
to us and we deserve to have truth but
at<00:06:43.739> the<00:06:43.799> same<00:06:43.979> time<00:06:44.249> there's<00:06:45.059> really<00:06:45.239> nothing

00:06:45.679 --> 00:06:45.689 
at the same time there's really nothing

00:06:45.689 --> 00:06:47.509 
at the same time there's really nothing
we<00:06:45.719> can<00:06:46.019> do<00:06:46.199> other<00:06:46.409> than<00:06:46.559> just<00:06:46.709> ask<00:06:47.099> them<00:06:47.369> and

00:06:47.509 --> 00:06:47.519 
we can do other than just ask them and

00:06:47.519 --> 00:06:49.100 
we can do other than just ask them and
ask<00:06:47.639> them<00:06:47.969> again<00:06:48.179> and<00:06:48.360> again<00:06:48.599> and<00:06:48.779> hope<00:06:48.959> that

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:49.110 
ask them again and again and hope that

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:50.569 
ask them again and again and hope that
they'll<00:06:49.259> be<00:06:49.319> honest<00:06:49.739> with<00:06:49.889> us<00:06:49.919> now<00:06:50.429> if

00:06:50.569 --> 00:06:50.579 
they'll be honest with us now if

00:06:50.579 --> 00:06:51.949 
they'll be honest with us now if
everybody<00:06:50.819> wants<00:06:51.209> to<00:06:51.269> take<00:06:51.449> a<00:06:51.509> look<00:06:51.779> at<00:06:51.839> this

00:06:51.949 --> 00:06:51.959 
everybody wants to take a look at this

00:06:51.959 --> 00:06:53.719 
everybody wants to take a look at this

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:04.110 
question it looks like to me also some

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:07.129 
question it looks like to me also some
kind<00:07:04.379> of<00:07:04.469> a<00:07:04.559> smokestack<00:07:05.099> or<00:07:05.699> something<00:07:06.479> but

00:07:07.129 --> 00:07:07.139 
kind of a smokestack or something but

00:07:07.139 --> 00:07:08.659 
kind of a smokestack or something but
routines<00:07:07.619> from<00:07:07.829> the<00:07:08.039> movement<00:07:08.399> I<00:07:08.429> mean<00:07:08.549> you

00:07:08.659 --> 00:07:08.669 
routines from the movement I mean you

00:07:08.669 --> 00:07:10.219 
routines from the movement I mean you
really<00:07:08.849> have<00:07:08.969> to<00:07:09.209> look<00:07:09.299> closely<00:07:09.629> there<00:07:10.049> but

00:07:10.219 --> 00:07:10.229 
really have to look closely there but

00:07:10.229 --> 00:07:12.019 
really have to look closely there but
once<00:07:10.439> you<00:07:10.589> zero<00:07:10.949> in<00:07:11.189> on<00:07:11.339> it<00:07:11.369> you're<00:07:11.699> going<00:07:11.909> to

00:07:12.019 --> 00:07:12.029 
once you zero in on it you're going to

00:07:12.029 --> 00:07:14.059 
once you zero in on it you're going to
see<00:07:12.360> it<00:07:12.509> and<00:07:12.689> then<00:07:13.349> there<00:07:13.559> are<00:07:13.709> a<00:07:13.739> couple

00:07:14.059 --> 00:07:14.069 
see it and then there are a couple

00:07:14.069 --> 00:07:16.729 
see it and then there are a couple
frames<00:07:14.489> where<00:07:15.089> you<00:07:15.299> see<00:07:15.659> almost<00:07:16.559> like<00:07:16.709> a

00:07:16.729 --> 00:07:16.739 
frames where you see almost like a

00:07:16.739 --> 00:07:20.209 
frames where you see almost like a
little<00:07:17.039> smoke<00:07:17.999> or<00:07:18.329> something<00:07:19.049> that<00:07:19.829> emits

00:07:20.209 --> 00:07:20.219 
little smoke or something that emits

00:07:20.219 --> 00:07:22.639 
little smoke or something that emits
from<00:07:20.699> this<00:07:20.939> smokestack<00:07:21.629> I<00:07:21.959> mean<00:07:22.079> it's<00:07:22.469> almost

00:07:22.639 --> 00:07:22.649 
from this smokestack I mean it's almost

00:07:22.649 --> 00:07:25.159 
from this smokestack I mean it's almost
as<00:07:22.979> if<00:07:23.189> there's<00:07:23.999> I<00:07:24.209> mean<00:07:24.419> it<00:07:24.599> doesn't<00:07:25.079> look

00:07:25.159 --> 00:07:25.169 
as if there's I mean it doesn't look

00:07:25.169 --> 00:07:26.629 
as if there's I mean it doesn't look
like<00:07:25.229> a<00:07:25.349> volcano<00:07:25.799> because<00:07:26.069> it's<00:07:26.429> off

00:07:26.629 --> 00:07:26.639 
like a volcano because it's off

00:07:26.639 --> 00:07:29.839 
like a volcano because it's off
obviously<00:07:27.389> it's<00:07:27.539> too<00:07:27.779> thin<00:07:28.489> it<00:07:29.489> looks<00:07:29.669> like<00:07:29.819> a

00:07:29.839 --> 00:07:29.849 
obviously it's too thin it looks like a

00:07:29.849 --> 00:07:32.839 
obviously it's too thin it looks like a
cylinder<00:07:30.269> it<00:07:31.169> just<00:07:31.589> it<00:07:31.800> looks<00:07:32.069> like<00:07:32.249> there's<00:07:32.519> a

00:07:32.839 --> 00:07:32.849 
cylinder it just it looks like there's a

00:07:32.849 --> 00:07:35.629 
cylinder it just it looks like there's a
huge<00:07:33.239> pipe<00:07:33.629> sticking<00:07:34.110> into<00:07:34.529> the<00:07:34.619> moon<00:07:34.800> doesn't

00:07:35.629 --> 00:07:35.639 
huge pipe sticking into the moon doesn't

00:07:35.639 --> 00:07:38.989 
huge pipe sticking into the moon doesn't
it<00:07:35.699> it<00:07:36.599> certainly<00:07:37.019> does<00:07:37.289> to<00:07:37.529> me<00:07:37.709> and<00:07:38.069> of<00:07:38.699> course

00:07:38.989 --> 00:07:38.999 
it it certainly does to me and of course

00:07:38.999 --> 00:07:40.399 
it it certainly does to me and of course
we're<00:07:39.179> happy<00:07:39.300> that<00:07:39.539> we<00:07:39.689> were<00:07:39.869> able<00:07:39.989> to<00:07:40.199> take

00:07:40.399 --> 00:07:40.409 
we're happy that we were able to take

00:07:40.409 --> 00:07:42.079 
we're happy that we were able to take
these<00:07:40.649> stills<00:07:41.069> that<00:07:41.489> were<00:07:41.579> used<00:07:41.819> in<00:07:41.969> the

00:07:42.079 --> 00:07:42.089 
these stills that were used in the

00:07:42.089 --> 00:07:44.959 
these stills that were used in the
electric<00:07:42.479> spacecraft<00:07:43.079> issue<00:07:43.349> and<00:07:43.969> recombine

00:07:44.959 --> 00:07:44.969 
electric spacecraft issue and recombine

00:07:44.969 --> 00:07:48.199 
electric spacecraft issue and recombine
them<00:07:45.239> to<00:07:45.629> replicate<00:07:46.289> the<00:07:46.469> footage<00:07:46.679> and<00:07:47.209> it's

00:07:48.199 --> 00:07:48.209 
them to replicate the footage and it's

00:07:48.209 --> 00:07:49.879 
them to replicate the footage and it's
really<00:07:48.389> valuable<00:07:48.629> to<00:07:48.929> have<00:07:49.199> that<00:07:49.559> movement

00:07:49.879 --> 00:07:49.889 
really valuable to have that movement

00:07:49.889 --> 00:07:52.489 
really valuable to have that movement
there<00:07:50.369> to<00:07:50.610> actually<00:07:50.759> see<00:07:51.300> how<00:07:51.569> it<00:07:51.599> behaves<00:07:51.929> as

00:07:52.489 --> 00:07:52.499 
there to actually see how it behaves as

00:07:52.499 --> 00:07:55.879 
there to actually see how it behaves as
the<00:07:52.769> camera<00:07:53.159> passes<00:07:53.610> by<00:07:53.879> and<00:07:54.349> of<00:07:55.349> course<00:07:55.649> at

00:07:55.879 --> 00:07:55.889 
the camera passes by and of course at

00:07:55.889 --> 00:07:58.869 
the camera passes by and of course at
very<00:07:56.129> least<00:07:56.489> if<00:07:56.969> this<00:07:57.179> is<00:07:57.389> some<00:07:57.629> sort<00:07:57.929> of<00:07:58.019> a

00:07:58.869 --> 00:07:58.879 
very least if this is some sort of a

00:07:58.879 --> 00:08:01.489 
very least if this is some sort of a
geologic<00:07:59.879> anomaly<00:08:00.479> on<00:08:00.629> the<00:08:00.659> moon<00:08:00.929> and<00:08:01.229> I<00:08:01.259> can't

00:08:01.489 --> 00:08:01.499 
geologic anomaly on the moon and I can't

00:08:01.499 --> 00:08:03.769 
geologic anomaly on the moon and I can't
imagine<00:08:01.979> what<00:08:02.339> it<00:08:02.459> would<00:08:02.579> be<00:08:02.759> at<00:08:03.479> the<00:08:03.569> very

00:08:03.769 --> 00:08:03.779 
imagine what it would be at the very

00:08:03.779 --> 00:08:05.839 
imagine what it would be at the very
least<00:08:04.049> and<00:08:04.529> we<00:08:04.860> need<00:08:05.039> to<00:08:05.189> know<00:08:05.339> more<00:08:05.610> about

00:08:05.839 --> 00:08:05.849 
least and we need to know more about

00:08:05.849 --> 00:08:07.729 
least and we need to know more about
what<00:08:06.329> the<00:08:06.479> surface<00:08:06.869> of<00:08:07.049> the<00:08:07.139> moon<00:08:07.319> is<00:08:07.529> is

00:08:07.729 --> 00:08:07.739 
what the surface of the moon is is

00:08:07.739 --> 00:08:10.729 
what the surface of the moon is is
really<00:08:08.159> like<00:08:08.449> and<00:08:09.449> then<00:08:09.719> this<00:08:09.839> could<00:08:10.049> have<00:08:10.289> you

00:08:10.729 --> 00:08:10.739 
really like and then this could have you

00:08:10.739 --> 00:08:12.289 
really like and then this could have you
know<00:08:10.860> direct<00:08:11.159> implications<00:08:11.819> when<00:08:11.999> it<00:08:12.119> comes

00:08:12.289 --> 00:08:12.299 
know direct implications when it comes

00:08:12.299 --> 00:08:13.579 
know direct implications when it comes
to<00:08:12.449> some<00:08:12.629> of<00:08:12.719> the<00:08:12.809> questions<00:08:12.929> about

00:08:13.579 --> 00:08:13.589 
to some of the questions about

00:08:13.589 --> 00:08:17.509 
to some of the questions about
inconsistencies<00:08:14.399> in<00:08:15.079> nasa's<00:08:16.079> footage<00:08:16.519> as

00:08:17.509 --> 00:08:17.519 
inconsistencies in nasa's footage as

00:08:17.519 --> 00:08:19.909 
inconsistencies in nasa's footage as
well
