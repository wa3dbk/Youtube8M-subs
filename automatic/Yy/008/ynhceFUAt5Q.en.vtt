00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
because well it's a Canadian actually

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.370 
because well it's a Canadian actually
from<00:01:16.920> American<00:01:17.400> servers<00:01:17.850> facing<00:01:18.330> a<00:01:18.479> European

from American servers facing a European

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.320 
from American servers facing a European

beta keep blabbering today this is
getting<00:02:47.340> a<00:02:47.459> bit<00:02:47.640> complicated<00:02:48.540> so<00:02:49.019> on<00:02:49.830> TLO<00:02:50.190> side

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
this probe let's check to your lows view

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.470 
this probe let's check to your lows view
yeah<00:03:24.510> it<00:03:24.780> doesn't<00:03:25.019> know<00:03:25.200> it's<00:03:25.380> there<00:03:26.480> I

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.060 
yeah it doesn't know it's there I
honestly<00:03:28.140> don't<00:03:28.290> know<00:03:28.410> what<00:03:28.590> to<00:03:28.650> say<00:03:28.920> about

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
honestly don't know what to say about

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:30.680 
honestly don't know what to say about
this<00:03:29.220> but<00:03:29.609> he<00:03:29.730> doesn't<00:03:30.030> know<00:03:30.090> that<00:03:30.120> probe<00:03:30.540> is

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
this but he doesn't know that probe is

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.259 
this but he doesn't know that probe is
there<00:03:30.900> and<00:03:31.340> meanwhile<00:03:32.340> on<00:03:32.579> the<00:03:32.640> everyone's

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
there and meanwhile on the everyone's

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:34.819 
there and meanwhile on the everyone's
view<00:03:33.510> as<00:03:33.630> you<00:03:33.720> can<00:03:33.870> see<00:03:34.019> the<00:03:34.140> probe<00:03:34.380> is<00:03:34.620> just

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
view as you can see the probe is just

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:37.430 
view as you can see the probe is just
hanging<00:03:35.190> and<00:03:35.430> relaxing<00:03:36.090> just<00:03:36.600> checking<00:03:37.410> the

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
hanging and relaxing just checking the

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.199 
hanging and relaxing just checking the
minerals<00:03:37.980> checking<00:03:38.430> the<00:03:38.549> rocks<00:03:38.790> i<00:03:39.000> guess

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
minerals checking the rocks i guess

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.979 
minerals checking the rocks i guess
might<00:03:39.540> be<00:03:39.720> a<00:03:39.750> geologist<00:03:40.440> probe<00:03:40.739> and<00:03:41.959> saggy<00:03:42.959> I

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
might be a geologist probe and saggy I

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:44.360 
might be a geologist probe and saggy I
think<00:03:43.320> he's<00:03:43.470> preparing<00:03:43.829> something<00:03:44.160> is

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
think he's preparing something is

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.300 
think he's preparing something is
sending<00:03:44.670> another<00:03:44.910> probe<00:03:45.739> also<00:03:46.739> building<00:03:47.130> what

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
sending another probe also building what

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.460 
sending another probe also building what
is<00:03:47.430> it<00:03:47.549> getting<00:03:47.820> here<00:03:48.000> another<00:03:48.329> gateway<00:03:48.660> you

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
is it getting here another gateway you

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.680 
is it getting here another gateway you
went<00:03:49.680> from<00:03:49.890> gateway<00:03:50.700> to<00:03:50.760> cybernetics<00:03:51.480> and<00:03:51.570> now

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
went from gateway to cybernetics and now

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.890 
went from gateway to cybernetics and now
getting<00:03:51.959> two<00:03:52.530> gateways<00:03:53.150> four<00:03:54.150> gateways<00:03:54.480> is

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
getting two gateways four gateways is

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.569 
getting two gateways four gateways is
going<00:03:55.079> to<00:03:55.140> be<00:03:55.230> working<00:03:55.380> out<00:03:55.650> pumping<00:03:56.160> out<00:03:56.310> of

its base but all suck is just running

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.430 
its base but all suck is just running
away<00:05:34.680> and<00:05:35.360> yet<00:05:36.360> yellow<00:05:36.720> finally<00:05:37.110> getting<00:05:37.350> the

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:37.440 
away and yet yellow finally getting the

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.380 
away and yet yellow finally getting the

SUV's back to the mineral liners just
duking<00:05:39.780> it<00:05:39.780> out<00:05:40.020> the<00:05:40.680> siege<00:05:40.919> tanks<00:05:41.310> coming

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:41.490

from the back but i think there's more
units<00:05:43.200> getting<00:05:43.470> carted<00:05:43.860> area<00:05:44.130> more<00:05:44.370> units<00:05:44.669> get

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:44.820 
units getting carted area more units get

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.090 
units getting carted area more units get
important<00:05:45.330> in<00:05:45.419> more<00:05:46.020> units<00:05:46.350> making<00:05:46.650> a<00:05:46.740> pincer

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:47.100 
important in more units making a pincer

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.219 
important in more units making a pincer
attack<00:05:47.130> coming<00:05:47.610> from<00:05:47.850> the<00:05:48.000> back<00:05:48.150> and<00:05:48.389> TLO<00:05:49.110> is
