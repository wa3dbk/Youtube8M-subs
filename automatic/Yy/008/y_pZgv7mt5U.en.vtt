00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:22.990 
that's what it looks like during the day
so<00:02:21.940> you<00:02:22.060> just<00:02:22.210> craft<00:02:22.420> it<00:02:22.540> with

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
so you just craft it with

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.130 
so you just craft it with
that's<00:02:23.270> it<00:02:23.420> without<00:02:23.630> but<00:02:23.780> obviously<00:02:23.990> that

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
that's it without but obviously that

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.710 
that's it without but obviously that
wasn't<00:02:24.290> give<00:02:24.500> you<00:02:24.620> any<00:02:24.770> light<00:02:24.920> at<00:02:25.130> all<00:02:25.720> okay

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
wasn't give you any light at all okay

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.020 
wasn't give you any light at all okay
the<00:02:26.930> next<00:02:27.110> thing<00:02:27.230> is<00:02:27.530> a<00:02:27.590> trap<00:02:27.920> so<00:02:28.640> you<00:02:28.730> can<00:02:28.850> trap

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
the next thing is a trap so you can trap

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.000 
the next thing is a trap so you can trap
animals<00:02:29.210> you<00:02:29.660> know<00:02:29.780> I<00:02:29.810> mean<00:02:29.990> so<00:02:30.500> saves<00:02:30.770> going

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
animals you know I mean so saves going

friends you know trap anybody it's more

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.030 
friends you know trap anybody it's more
appeal<00:02:34.460> so<00:02:35.300> that's<00:02:35.930> a<00:02:36.050> mix<00:02:36.260> trap<00:02:36.470> quite<00:02:36.680> simple

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
appeal so that's a mix trap quite simple

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.410 
appeal so that's a mix trap quite simple
just<00:02:37.070> the<00:02:37.250> iron<00:02:37.400> sticks<00:02:37.670> which<00:02:37.820> is<00:02:37.940> two<00:02:38.090> pieces

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
just the iron sticks which is two pieces

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.300 
just the iron sticks which is two pieces
of<00:02:38.450> iron<00:02:38.950> okay

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
of iron okay

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:41.980 
of iron okay
right<00:02:40.550> there's<00:02:40.910> also<00:02:41.060> different<00:02:41.660> kinds<00:02:41.780> of

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990 
right there's also different kinds of

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:45.160 
right there's also different kinds of
fires<00:02:42.230> in<00:02:42.560> the<00:02:42.800> game<00:02:42.980> so<00:02:43.880> you<00:02:44.630> put<00:02:44.810> that<00:02:44.840> bass

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
fires in the game so you put that bass

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:46.870 
fires in the game so you put that bass
down<00:02:45.470> the<00:02:45.710> score<00:02:45.920> across<00:02:46.100> here<00:02:46.370> so<00:02:46.400> this<00:02:46.640> space

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
down the score across here so this space

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.400 
down the score across here so this space
you<00:02:47.090> put<00:02:47.240> these<00:02:47.390> down<00:02:47.630> you<00:02:47.660> brush<00:02:48.020> few<00:02:48.320> of

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
you put these down you brush few of

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.440 
you put these down you brush few of
these<00:02:48.530> and<00:02:48.860> then<00:02:49.370> it<00:02:49.520> on<00:02:49.640> these<00:02:49.820> bases<00:02:50.300> you<00:02:50.420> can

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
these and then it on these bases you can

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.210 
these and then it on these bases you can
put<00:02:50.660> these<00:02:50.840> kits<00:02:51.110> down<00:02:51.350> so<00:02:51.650> there's<00:02:51.830> a<00:02:51.920> spit

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
put these kits down so there's a spit

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.490 
put these kits down so there's a spit
kit<00:02:52.490> a<00:02:53.080> grill<00:02:54.080> kit<00:02:54.350> and<00:02:54.620> a<00:02:55.190> pan<00:02:55.400> kit<00:02:55.700> okay<00:02:56.630> so<00:02:56.690> so
