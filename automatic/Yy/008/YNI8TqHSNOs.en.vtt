00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:05.190
 let's start preparing the meat 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.830
 for that we need loin meat for 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.280
 to celebrate I already have it cooked and 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:14.309
 shredded and I used a little more 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.110
 a quarter of a kilo 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.690
 we're going to need chiles, too, here 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:21.449
 I put a whole tomato I put 4 chilies 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.689
 guajillo not in chilan but nothing 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.029
 more are like to color the chilito 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.240
 what are we going to put on I have chile 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.949
 chipotle we will use the amount 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.739
 that we want too 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.860
 we need salt and we are going to occupy cumin 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.460
 pepper and garlic we will place the 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:44.059
 cumin puff 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:46.129
 also the little fist of salt 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:49.370
 when I say little hand I mean what 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:51.920
 I reach to take with the fingers that is 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.949
 this what I take with the four fingers 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.000
 this is a little fist for me too 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:00.070
 it had happened to me that we are going to occupy 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.870
 an onion into strips or wheels which 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:05.570
 as you like and this is the chile 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.970
 guajillo for those who do not know him 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.890
 We put the pepper and bring it to 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.840
 liquefying together with the film we are going to place 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.450
 a casserole with a little oil and 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:18.530
 let's put the onion in slices with 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:20.539
 wheels and I already have them in 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.750
 like five minutes with her in the fire 

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:26.630
 I used a whole onion size 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.759
 medium and I do it to give him a 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.759
 different flavor to meat and also 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:33.920
 so that it helps us how it does that 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:36.800
 it looks better when I'm already 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.569
 we place the meat we give it a look and 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.860
 then we put what we liquefy 

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:41.930
 they passed the ncaa 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.410
 the onions are ready here is 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:47.720
 the chili in the colander and I'll strain it 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:50.600
 that is to say that they bite they have many 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:53.840
 seeds and what's left of the chili when 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:56.000
 we liquefy it so if you do not want it 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.310
 our meat is left with that obviously 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.050
 you have to pass them through the strainer what 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.090
 we can very well add a 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:06.340
 little more water and we're going to leave it to 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.340
 boil and our tenderloin is ready
