00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
which like I said makes her less mobile

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.679 
which like I said makes her less mobile
than<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.549> Coco<00:01:17.970> because<00:01:18.270> remember<00:01:18.420> the

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
than the Coco because remember the

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.870 
than the Coco because remember the
Coco's<00:01:19.049> got<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.439> ball<00:01:19.650> joint<00:01:20.009> so<00:01:20.400> she's<00:01:20.670> going

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
Coco's got the ball joint so she's going

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.690 
Coco's got the ball joint so she's going
to<00:01:20.939> be<00:01:21.060> very<00:01:21.090> mobile<00:01:21.830> mobile<00:01:22.830> and<00:01:23.130> she's<00:01:23.460> not

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
to be very mobile mobile and she's not

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.420 
to be very mobile mobile and she's not
um<00:01:25.759> she<00:01:26.759> and<00:01:27.619> the<00:01:28.619> same<00:01:28.829> thing<00:01:28.979> with<00:01:29.100> her<00:01:29.189> head

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
um she and the same thing with her head

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.710 
um she and the same thing with her head
so<00:01:29.670> it's<00:01:29.820> really<00:01:30.000> not<00:01:30.180> going<00:01:30.299> to<00:01:30.360> have<00:01:30.570> the

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
so it's really not going to have the

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.960 
so it's really not going to have the
movement<00:01:31.170> like<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.740> Kokomo<00:01:32.250> lose<00:01:32.460> head<00:01:32.729> is

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
movement like the Kokomo lose head is

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.649 
movement like the Kokomo lose head is
good<00:01:33.270> code<00:01:33.630> Malou<00:01:34.430> the<00:01:35.430> Coco's<00:01:36.000> gonna<00:01:36.360> have

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
good code Malou the Coco's gonna have

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.679 
good code Malou the Coco's gonna have
because<00:01:37.650> of<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.890> joint<00:01:38.189> she<00:01:38.909> will<00:01:39.210> have<00:01:39.390> just

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
because of the joint she will have just

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.080 
because of the joint she will have just
the<00:01:39.840> cloth<00:01:40.079> body<00:01:40.380> so<00:01:40.710> this<00:01:40.890> will<00:01:41.070> be<00:01:41.250> pretty

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
the cloth body so this will be pretty

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.420 
the cloth body so this will be pretty
much<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.420> movement<00:01:43.229> of<00:01:43.380> her<00:01:43.590> head<00:01:43.920> there<00:01:44.280> will

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
much the movement of her head there will

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.530 
much the movement of her head there will
be<00:01:44.460> no<00:01:44.820> like<00:01:45.210> up<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:45.840> back<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.470> stuff<00:01:46.710> um<00:01:47.540> and

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
be no like up and back and stuff um and

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.670 
be no like up and back and stuff um and
I<00:01:48.659> know<00:01:48.689> because<00:01:48.930> I<00:01:49.079> have<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.320> Dixie

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
I know because I have the Dixie

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.800 
I know because I have the Dixie
prototype<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:50.579> when<00:01:51.270> you<00:01:51.360> try<00:01:51.479> to<00:01:51.509> move<00:01:51.720> her

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
prototype and when you try to move her

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.139 
prototype and when you try to move her
head<00:01:52.020> her<00:01:52.259> body<00:01:52.560> comes<00:01:53.040> out<00:01:53.280> above<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.970> head

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
head her body comes out above the head

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.080 
head her body comes out above the head
like<00:01:54.360> that<00:01:54.390> so<00:01:54.840> it<00:01:54.930> looks<00:01:54.990> all<00:01:55.320> funky

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
like that so it looks all funky

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.450 
like that so it looks all funky
personally<00:01:57.090> I<00:01:57.600> don't<00:01:58.290> like<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.770> full<00:01:58.950> torsos

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
personally I don't like the full torsos

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.730 
personally I don't like the full torsos
I'm<00:01:59.729> hoping<00:02:00.060> that<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:01.020> Coco<00:02:01.409> will<00:02:01.560> be<00:02:01.710> a

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
I'm hoping that the Coco will be a

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.889 
I'm hoping that the Coco will be a
better<00:02:01.979> fit<00:02:02.149> because<00:02:03.149> of<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.360> ball<00:02:03.570> joint

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
better fit because of the ball joint

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.469 
better fit because of the ball joint
