00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
Hey Guys! It's Commander Wolffe

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.000
And today, we're going to be looking at

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
the Top 5 Stupidest Clone Troopers

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.800
of Star Wars: The Clone Wars

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:08.800
When the Zillo Beast tries to

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.200
escape from its captivity,

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.600
the clone troopers rush to prevent its escape

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.400
Starting off our list at #5 is

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.000
Cosmos's Partner

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.600
Cosmos is a clone trooper,

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.600
who wonders how effective their rifles

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.800
are gonna be against such a monstrous creature

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.800
His friend tells him to "Shut Up"

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.200
But, unfortunately, Cosmos is right

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.100
And the clone troopers soon learn

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.800
that their rifles wouldn't do anything

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.400
against the Zillo Beast

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
At #4 we have Commander Fox,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.500
who is stationed on Coruscant to

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.100
analyze identification before

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.600
allowing anyone into vital Republic premises

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.900
Unfortunately, General Grievous is planning

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.200
to blow up the power plant on Coruscant

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.900
by having his forces disguise as sweeper droids

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.900
Fox analyzes the droids' identification to

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.800
make sure they are certified to pass

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.300
and that everything is in order

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.100
Thus, he lets them pass

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.100
But, he notices that they are not going

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.200
towards the generator room

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.300
and points them towards the right direction

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.500
Come on Commander Fox...

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.900
When do droids ever make mistakes?

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.500
Thus, Fox allows the droids to

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.500
carry out their mission,

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.900
successfully take out the generator room,

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.100
all the workers there, and cause chaos

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.200
on Coruscant

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.600
Stupid Fox

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.200
"Stupid Droids"

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.500
Devaron, the home of the Devaronians

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.800
is under attack by Separatist forces

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.500
The clone troopers defend the planet

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.500
under the leadership of Jedi Master Halsey

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.800
and his Padawan Knox

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.500
Things get worse when Savage Opress arrives

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.500
and the clones start to lose the battle

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.500
At #3, we have Commander Trauma,

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.900
who tells his clone troopers to "get" Savage Opress

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.500
and runs right into his blade

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.600
What a quick end to such a new character

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.400
When Duchess Satine of Mandalore

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.900
is framed for murder,

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.000
The police bots come after her

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.600
But so do our #2 on this list

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.600
Riot Clone Troopers

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.100
These clone troopers join the chase

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.400
after Duchess Satine

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.200
But are complete Dufuses

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:05.800
and trip up on everything

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.800
LITERALLY

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.000
Not to mention, they lose track

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000
of Duchess Satine

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.100
after a MINUTE

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.900
Then, they falsely report that she's in a speeder

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:18.800
"Uh, cancel that!"

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.300
"She's escaping in a speeder, "

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.000
"heading for section IG-44"

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.100
Does it get worse?

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.300
You bet it does!

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.400
These clone troopers start to question citizens,

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.000
who don't even understand them!

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.300
"Ugh...You know I don't think he understands us"

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.600
"Let's try someone else"

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.000
These clone troopers spend the next few hours

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.800
looking for her,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.600
when she's right around the corner

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.500
Maybe they should just stick to maintaining

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.200
riots in the end, after all

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.000
After Jedi General Pong Krell betrays the Republic,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.300
Captain Rex takes a sizeable clone force

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:55.300
to try and arrest him

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.500
Unfortunately, the fallen Jedi decides to put up a fight

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.600
And topping our list at #1

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.400
is an unidentified 212th Clone Trooper,

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.100
who decides that it's a good idea

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.800
to run right into the lightsabers

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.500
What a smooth move

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:11.600
Disagree with this list?

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.400
Please leave your comments below

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.400
Thank you so much for watching!

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.300
This is Commander Wolffe signing out

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:18.500
And as always...

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:19.400
WOOF WOOF
