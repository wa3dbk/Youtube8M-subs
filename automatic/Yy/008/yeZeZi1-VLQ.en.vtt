00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
you a quick look around that is

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.870

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
right here we have an electrical switch

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.039 
right here we have an electrical switch
not<00:01:02.280> an<00:01:02.430> electrical<00:01:02.879> switch<00:01:03.030> sorry<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:03.629> light

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
not an electrical switch sorry a light

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.380 
not an electrical switch sorry a light
switch<00:01:04.379> that<00:01:05.040> would<00:01:05.309> actually<00:01:05.850> be<00:01:06.150> able<00:01:06.210> to

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
switch that would actually be able to

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.390 
switch that would actually be able to
turn<00:01:06.720> on<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:07.110> light<00:01:07.439> that<00:01:07.650> would<00:01:07.740> be<00:01:07.799> located

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
turn on a light that would be located

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.010 
turn on a light that would be located
right<00:01:08.549> here<00:01:08.610> in<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.090> middle<00:01:09.479> of<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.630> ceiling

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
right here in the middle of the ceiling

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.990 
right here in the middle of the ceiling
as<00:01:10.409> you<00:01:10.680> can<00:01:10.860> see<00:01:11.040> I<00:01:11.070> chose<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.700> make<00:01:11.850> the

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
as you can see I chose to make the

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.580 
as you can see I chose to make the
ceiling<00:01:12.210> glass<00:01:12.510> rather<00:01:12.960> than<00:01:13.229> actually

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
ceiling glass rather than actually

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.620 
ceiling glass rather than actually
making<00:01:13.619> my<00:01:13.979> ceiling<00:01:14.400> just<00:01:14.880> because<00:01:15.240> I<00:01:15.270> think<00:01:15.390> a

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
making my ceiling just because I think a

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.030 
making my ceiling just because I think a
lot<00:01:15.659> of<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.960> natural<00:01:16.350> light<00:01:16.470> coming<00:01:16.770> from<00:01:16.799> the

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
lot of the natural light coming from the

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.429 
lot of the natural light coming from the
Sun<00:01:17.220> would<00:01:17.729> help<00:01:17.970> illuminate<00:01:18.540> my<00:01:18.689> room<00:01:18.930> and

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
Sun would help illuminate my room and

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:20.660 
Sun would help illuminate my room and
you<00:01:19.619> know<00:01:19.740> I<00:01:19.770> think<00:01:19.890> it's<00:01:20.220> doing<00:01:20.430> a<00:01:20.520> pretty

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
you know I think it's doing a pretty

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.520 
you know I think it's doing a pretty
good<00:01:20.759> job<00:01:20.909> of<00:01:21.090> making<00:01:21.210> it<00:01:21.600> kind<00:01:21.810> of<00:01:21.869> clear<00:01:22.259> and

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
good job of making it kind of clear and

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.820 
good job of making it kind of clear and
more<00:01:22.860> bright<00:01:23.720> so<00:01:24.720> as<00:01:24.900> we<00:01:25.110> move<00:01:25.290> down<00:01:25.500> right

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
more bright so as we move down right

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.710 
more bright so as we move down right
here<00:01:26.159> we<00:01:26.400> have<00:01:26.580> my<00:01:26.759> closet<00:01:27.210> space

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
here we have my closet space

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.080 
here we have my closet space
normally<00:01:28.710> this<00:01:28.920> these<00:01:29.369> panels<00:01:29.850> right<00:01:30.030> here

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
normally this these panels right here

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.870 
normally this these panels right here
would<00:01:30.509> be<00:01:30.570> filled<00:01:31.020> with<00:01:31.140> mirrors<00:01:31.880> but

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
would be filled with mirrors but

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.670 
would be filled with mirrors but
unfortunately<00:01:33.090> minecraft<00:01:34.049> does<00:01:34.229> not<00:01:34.409> have

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
unfortunately minecraft does not have

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.620 
unfortunately minecraft does not have
mirrors<00:01:35.070> in<00:01:35.280> their<00:01:35.400> games<00:01:35.670> so<00:01:35.970> I<00:01:36.000> just<00:01:36.299> decided

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
mirrors in their games so I just decided

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.320

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.330

slots<00:02:31.530> in<00:02:31.710> the<00:02:31.830> drawer<00:02:32.070> obviously<00:02:32.880> my<00:02:33.090> drawers

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
slots in the drawer obviously my drawers

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.970 
slots in the drawer obviously my drawers
are<00:02:33.570> made<00:02:33.750> of<00:02:33.900> diamonds<00:02:34.080> I<00:02:34.470> wish<00:02:34.710> they<00:02:34.920> were

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
are made of diamonds I wish they were

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.160 
are made of diamonds I wish they were
but<00:02:35.400> yeah<00:02:35.760> I<00:02:36.030> just<00:02:36.240> decided<00:02:36.810> to<00:02:36.990> choose

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
but yeah I just decided to choose

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.080 
but yeah I just decided to choose
diamonds<00:02:37.710> because<00:02:37.860> they<00:02:38.130> could<00:02:38.370> probably

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
diamonds because they could probably

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.150 
diamonds because they could probably
portray<00:02:39.660> my<00:02:40.200> drawers<00:02:40.470> the<00:02:40.650> best<00:02:40.860> just<00:02:41.100> because

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
portray my drawers the best just because

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.950 
portray my drawers the best just because
it's<00:02:41.550> kind<00:02:41.730> of<00:02:41.790> like<00:02:41.940> green<00:02:42.180> blossom<00:02:42.630> I<00:02:42.690> think

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
it's kind of like green blossom I think

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.570 
it's kind of like green blossom I think
that's<00:02:43.470> how<00:02:43.620> it<00:02:43.650> would<00:02:43.920> look<00:02:43.950> the<00:02:44.730> closest<00:02:45.180> to

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
that's how it would look the closest to

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.040 
that's how it would look the closest to
that's<00:02:47.580> basically<00:02:48.060> all<00:02:48.300> for<00:02:48.510> the<00:02:48.570> drawers

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
that's basically all for the drawers

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:51.810 
that's basically all for the drawers
you<00:02:50.530> look<00:02:50.710> about<00:02:51.010> it's<00:02:51.400> a<00:02:51.490> pretty<00:02:51.670> small

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
you look about it's a pretty small

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:56.730 
you look about it's a pretty small

window it's a pretty simple window in
real<00:03:46.020> life<00:03:46.260> I<00:03:46.380> would<00:03:46.530> actually<00:03:46.680> have<00:03:46.920> blinds

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
real life I would actually have blinds

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.190 
real life I would actually have blinds
right<00:03:47.520> here<00:03:47.790> but<00:03:47.970> I<00:03:48.000> just<00:03:48.120> decided<00:03:48.750> not<00:03:48.780> to<00:03:48.930> add

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
right here but I just decided not to add

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.200 
right here but I just decided not to add
those<00:03:49.380> into<00:03:49.650> the<00:03:49.770> video<00:03:50.070> because<00:03:50.760> I<00:03:50.790> think<00:03:50.940> it

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:51.210 
those into the video because I think it

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:52.370 
those into the video because I think it
would<00:03:51.330> look<00:03:51.450> a<00:03:51.570> little<00:03:51.810> cluttered<00:03:52.080> and<00:03:52.320> I

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
would look a little cluttered and I

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.080 
would look a little cluttered and I
think<00:03:52.620> just<00:03:52.800> this<00:03:53.070> kind<00:03:53.430> of<00:03:53.490> makes<00:03:53.670> it<00:03:53.850> look<00:03:54.000> a

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
think just this kind of makes it look a

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.900 
think just this kind of makes it look a
lot<00:03:54.210> better<00:03:54.420> and<00:03:55.310> one<00:03:56.310> more<00:03:56.490> thing<00:03:56.670> that<00:03:56.700> I'd

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
lot better and one more thing that I'd

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.900 
lot better and one more thing that I'd
like<00:03:57.090> to<00:03:57.210> show<00:03:57.390> you<00:03:57.420> guys<00:03:57.690> in<00:03:57.900> this<00:03:57.930> video
