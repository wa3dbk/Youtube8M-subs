prestige<00:00:10.190> lobbies<00:00:10.670> that<00:00:10.940> we<00:00:11.210> have<00:00:11.450> hosted<00:00:12.050> at

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:12.320 
prestige lobbies that we have hosted at

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.269 
prestige lobbies that we have hosted at
Gamescom<00:00:14.080> so<00:00:15.080> this<00:00:15.410> is<00:00:15.559> the<00:00:15.710> safest<00:00:16.070> way

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:16.279 
Gamescom so this is the safest way

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:18.429 
Gamescom so this is the safest way
possible<00:00:16.309> and<00:00:17.060> the<00:00:17.210> reason<00:00:17.630> behind<00:00:17.720> that<00:00:18.050> is

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:18.439 
possible and the reason behind that is

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:21.580 
possible and the reason behind that is
because<00:00:18.800> all<00:00:19.279> you<00:00:19.700> have<00:00:19.939> to<00:00:20.119> do<00:00:20.330> is<00:00:20.660> join<00:00:21.320> the

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:21.590 
because all you have to do is join the

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:23.620 
because all you have to do is join the
hosters<00:00:21.949> game<00:00:22.190> you<00:00:22.730> not<00:00:23.060> have<00:00:23.330> to<00:00:23.449> download

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:23.630 
hosters game you not have to download

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.990 
hosters game you not have to download
anything<00:00:23.990> he<00:00:24.980> doesn't<00:00:25.310> need<00:00:25.369> it<00:00:25.490> down<00:00:25.640> your

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.000 
anything he doesn't need it down your

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.720 
anything he doesn't need it down your
profile<00:00:26.449> there's<00:00:27.170> the<00:00:27.710> most<00:00:27.890> minimum<00:00:28.400> risk

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
profile there's the most minimum risk

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.890 
profile there's the most minimum risk
factor<00:00:29.300> possible<00:00:30.520> so<00:00:31.720> there's<00:00:32.720> I<00:00:32.870> mean

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:32.900 
factor possible so there's I mean

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.630 
factor possible so there's I mean
there's<00:00:33.170> always<00:00:33.320> a<00:00:33.440> risk<00:00:33.680> because<00:00:34.250> the<00:00:34.400> fact

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640 
there's always a risk because the fact

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.460 
there's always a risk because the fact
that<00:00:34.730> you<00:00:34.850> know<00:00:35.120> anything<00:00:35.900> with<00:00:36.019> hacking<00:00:36.350> or
