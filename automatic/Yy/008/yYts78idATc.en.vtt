2560 x 1440 simple terms the same panel
that's<00:00:30.499> in<00:00:30.619> the<00:00:30.679> apple<00:00:31.009> thunderbolt<00:00:31.220> display

that's in the apple thunderbolt display

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:35.430 
that's in the apple thunderbolt display
but<00:00:32.870> doesn't<00:00:33.800> cost<00:00:33.920> anywhere<00:00:34.310> near<00:00:34.670> as<00:00:34.910> much

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 
but doesn't cost anywhere near as much

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:39.020 
so without further ado let's crack this

00:00:39.020 --> 00:01:01.240 
so without further ado let's crack this
baby<00:00:39.380> open

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
what that means that IPS actually stands

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.630 
what that means that IPS actually stands
for<00:01:09.690> in-plane<00:01:10.350> switching<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:11.810> basically<00:01:12.810> an

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
for in-plane switching and basically an

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
give you a lot better color and much

00:01:20.250 --> 00:02:01.649 
give you a lot better color and much
higher<00:01:20.820> viewing<00:01:21.360> angles

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:34.210 
anything about these on the internet
you'll<00:05:32.419> know<00:05:32.599> that<00:05:32.870> these<00:05:33.229> really<00:05:33.740> only<00:05:33.949> come

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:34.220 
you'll know that these really only come

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:37.150 
you'll know that these really only come
with<00:05:34.310> one<00:05:34.580> input<00:05:35.800> part<00:05:36.800> of<00:05:36.830> the<00:05:36.919> reason<00:05:37.009> why

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:37.160 
with one input part of the reason why

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.960 
with one input part of the reason why
they're<00:05:37.400> so<00:05:37.550> cheap<00:05:37.580> it<00:05:38.000> is<00:05:38.750> a<00:05:38.780> DVI<00:05:39.410> digital

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:39.970 
they're so cheap it is a DVI digital

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:43.779 
they're so cheap it is a DVI digital
dual-link<00:05:40.970> digital<00:05:41.599> input<00:05:42.320> so<00:05:42.949> you're<00:05:43.639> not

00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:43.789 
dual-link digital input so you're not

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:45.249 
dual-link digital input so you're not
going<00:05:43.970> to<00:05:44.030> be<00:05:44.090> using<00:05:44.210> this<00:05:44.360> with<00:05:44.570> any<00:05:44.720> laptops

00:05:45.249 --> 00:05:45.259 
going to be using this with any laptops

going to be using this with any laptops
or<00:05:46.300> probably<00:05:47.300> not<00:05:47.539> even<00:05:47.900> with<00:05:48.199> anything<00:05:48.740> with

00:05:48.939 --> 00:05:48.949 
or probably not even with anything with

thankfully<00:05:59.680> we've<00:06:00.680> got<00:06:00.889> something<00:06:01.310> that

thankfully we've got something that
