00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:30.650
 ingredients in the video description for 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:34.610
 you're 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.610
 I'll add some flour 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:57.730
 I want to stay 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:04:00.360
 the march should see if it was not the 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.360
 best 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:08.430
 we will show her just as 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:08.430
 goalkeeper she pick up consistency 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.510
 where the mass is no longer 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:20.079
 Screaming in the hand, she's fucking us. 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:27.850
 knows that the world will now get a 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:39.220
 bit of pasta through a little 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:49.419
 of flour here involves with one side a 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:53.260
 Little in the queue on the side knows how to pack 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:05:00.700
 round is the Flemish will do the 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:05:02.530
 second goal turning she does not seem to be 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:06.639
 giving other side that the visceras getting 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:09.220
 she goes a little bit I like to do the 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:11.050
 very thin dough is what we do here 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:12.669
 but you can do a little more 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.500
 thick and no problem 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:17.650
 Just when it's time to go, we'll go to the 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:19.960
 whole room together with the eye with the cheese 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:21.910
 however he will not return to 1st place then 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:25.450
 I recommend that you pass a little finite 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:26.889
 She stays well with us now that the 

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:29.789
 mass is already open and I will put it 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:29.789
 within the form 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:36.290
 I just went back to smoking with oil people. 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.520
 it will not have flour, I did not put anything 

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:41.480
 which has no need 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:43.870
 I'm going to cut the pizza here tomorrow. 

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.870
 on here 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:01.010
 Anyway, I think we'll use it to 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:04.520
 make more pizza 

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:04.520
 I'm going to give it to you now. 

00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:28.259
 It's been coming since the cheese is now 

00:06:26.849 --> 00:06:30.509
 You put it on you, I'll go upstairs. 

00:06:28.259 --> 00:06:46.590
 put a little grape 

00:06:30.509 --> 00:06:49.259
 That little piece of chili is now 

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:51.930
 I will put in the preheated oven for a 

00:06:49.259 --> 00:06:53.729
 Genius Jim and I to see if she is 

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:56.129
 ready not put a car here in 

00:06:53.729 --> 00:06:59.819
 dough and let the dough is bursting 

00:06:56.129 --> 00:07:00.960
 shows but refuses the life of the 

00:06:59.819 --> 00:07:03.659
 fleet 

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:05.460
 then these people end the pizza 

00:07:03.659 --> 00:07:08.909
 ready I'll leave it here under the 

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:10.650
 all agents reached z and the 

00:07:08.909 --> 00:07:12.599
 way to prepare everything if you have any 

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:16.699
 doubt is just leave here in the comments 

00:07:12.599 --> 00:07:16.699
