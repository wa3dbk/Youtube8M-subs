on<00:01:58.220> to<00:01:58.429> the<00:01:58.520> bike<00:01:58.700> and<00:01:58.940> depending<00:01:59.330> on<00:01:59.420> your

00:01:59.559 --> 00:01:59.569 
on to the bike and depending on your

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:01.150 
on to the bike and depending on your
bike<00:01:59.720> some<00:02:00.050> of<00:02:00.200> them<00:02:00.319> it<00:02:00.440> was<00:02:00.560> easier<00:02:00.860> to<00:02:00.890> hook

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.160 
bike some of them it was easier to hook

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.880 
bike some of them it was easier to hook
to<00:02:01.190> than<00:02:01.970> others<00:02:02.270> but<00:02:03.140> the<00:02:03.229> bungee<00:02:03.500> cords<00:02:03.800> were

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
to than others but the bungee cords were

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.710 
to than others but the bungee cords were
just<00:02:04.099> kind<00:02:04.280> of<00:02:04.310> one<00:02:04.489> length<00:02:04.759> and<00:02:05.000> they<00:02:05.660> were

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
just kind of one length and they were

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.809 
just kind of one length and they were
stretchy<00:02:06.110> so<00:02:06.590> wasn't<00:02:07.250> always<00:02:07.520> the<00:02:07.789> easiest

00:02:07.809 --> 00:02:07.819 
stretchy so wasn't always the easiest

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:12.130 
stretchy so wasn't always the easiest
thing<00:02:08.270> to<00:02:08.420> do<00:02:08.720> or<00:02:09.709> to<00:02:09.950> live<00:02:10.129> with<00:02:10.750> the<00:02:11.750> new

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
thing to do or to live with the new

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
thing to do or to live with the new
system<00:02:12.709> uses<00:02:13.430> these<00:02:13.970> straps<00:02:14.980> which<00:02:15.980> you're

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
system uses these straps which you're

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.369 
system uses these straps which you're
going<00:02:16.400> to<00:02:16.580> anchor<00:02:16.819> to<00:02:17.239> the<00:02:17.270> bike<00:02:17.569> a<00:02:17.810> lot<00:02:18.200> like

00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:18.379 
going to anchor to the bike a lot like

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:21.070 
going to anchor to the bike a lot like
you<00:02:18.560> would<00:02:18.800> your<00:02:19.459> saddle<00:02:19.910> bags<00:02:20.120> and<00:02:20.360> they<00:02:20.810> have

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
you would your saddle bags and they have

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.970 
you would your saddle bags and they have
a<00:02:22.390> scratch<00:02:23.390> resistant<00:02:24.050> material<00:02:24.560> that<00:02:24.830> is

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
a scratch resistant material that is

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.430 
a scratch resistant material that is
included<00:02:25.610> and<00:02:25.760> so<00:02:26.510> that's<00:02:26.690> definitely<00:02:26.840> a<00:02:27.260> nice

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
included and so that's definitely a nice

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.559 
included and so that's definitely a nice
feature<00:02:27.709> if<00:02:28.069> the<00:02:28.370> straps<00:02:28.819> come<00:02:29.120> across<00:02:29.510> your

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
feature if the straps come across your

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:32.509 
feature if the straps come across your
in<00:02:30.840> any<00:02:31.140> areas<00:02:31.620> that's<00:02:32.129> going<00:02:32.310> to<00:02:32.370> help

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
in any areas that's going to help

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.300 
in any areas that's going to help
prevent<00:02:32.760> the<00:02:33.629> bag<00:02:33.900> from<00:02:34.200> scratching<00:02:34.829> your

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
prevent the bag from scratching your

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.030 
prevent the bag from scratching your
bike<00:02:35.519> but<00:02:36.329> just<00:02:36.569> kind<00:02:36.870> of<00:02:36.959> look<00:02:37.530> at<00:02:37.680> my<00:02:37.829> bike

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
bike but just kind of look at my bike

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.000 
bike but just kind of look at my bike
here<00:02:38.340> typically<00:02:39.239> I<00:02:39.450> use<00:02:39.689> these<00:02:40.230> grab<00:02:40.530> handles

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
here typically I use these grab handles

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.330 
here typically I use these grab handles
to<00:02:41.519> attach<00:02:41.819> my<00:02:42.090> tail<00:02:42.329> bag<00:02:42.540> to<00:02:42.810> these<00:02:43.739> straps<00:02:44.129> I

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
to attach my tail bag to these straps I

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.920 
to attach my tail bag to these straps I
could<00:02:44.519> probably<00:02:44.760> shorten<00:02:45.420> to<00:02:45.569> the<00:02:45.689> length

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
could probably shorten to the length

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.420 
could probably shorten to the length
that<00:02:46.140> would<00:02:46.290> work<00:02:46.439> well<00:02:46.709> for<00:02:47.010> that<00:02:47.129> if<00:02:47.310> I

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
that would work well for that if I

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.520 
that would work well for that if I
wanted<00:02:47.730> to<00:02:47.790> but<00:02:48.540> what's<00:02:48.720> nice<00:02:48.870> about<00:02:48.930> having<00:02:49.319> a

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
wanted to but what's nice about having a

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.199 
wanted to but what's nice about having a
strap<00:02:49.859> this<00:02:50.069> long<00:02:50.400> is<00:02:50.609> that<00:02:50.730> if<00:02:50.879> your<00:02:51.060> bike

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
strap this long is that if your bike

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:52.789 
strap this long is that if your bike
doesn't<00:02:51.510> have<00:02:51.689> grab<00:02:52.079> handles<00:02:52.409> which<00:02:52.500> a<00:02:52.620> lot<00:02:52.769> of

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
doesn't have grab handles which a lot of

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:55.520 
doesn't have grab handles which a lot of
them<00:02:52.980> don't<00:02:53.209> you<00:02:54.209> have<00:02:54.569> a<00:02:54.599> strap<00:02:55.049> that's<00:02:55.230> long

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
them don't you have a strap that's long

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.559 
them don't you have a strap that's long
enough<00:02:55.560> to<00:02:56.310> reach<00:02:56.519> other<00:02:56.819> areas<00:02:57.299> on<00:02:57.450> the

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
enough to reach other areas on the

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.270 
enough to reach other areas on the
motorcycle<00:02:58.139> for<00:02:58.260> instance<00:02:58.590> if<00:02:58.709> I<00:02:58.829> wanted<00:02:59.099> to

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
motorcycle for instance if I wanted to

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.149 
motorcycle for instance if I wanted to
go<00:02:59.430> through<00:02:59.700> my<00:03:00.269> passenger<00:03:00.840> peg<00:03:01.049> bracket<00:03:01.469> much

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:02.159 
go through my passenger peg bracket much

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:03.920 
go through my passenger peg bracket much
like<00:03:02.400> you<00:03:02.549> would<00:03:02.700> for<00:03:02.939> a<00:03:02.970> saddle<00:03:03.420> bag<00:03:03.569> setup

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
like you would for a saddle bag setup

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.960 
like you would for a saddle bag setup
you<00:03:04.379> can<00:03:04.409> go<00:03:04.620> ahead<00:03:04.739> and<00:03:05.040> put<00:03:05.459> it<00:03:05.549> through<00:03:05.790> that

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
you can go ahead and put it through that

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.220 
you can go ahead and put it through that
and<00:03:06.180> look<00:03:06.299> at<00:03:06.359> that<00:03:06.420> it's<00:03:06.689> just<00:03:06.750> about<00:03:07.079> the

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
and look at that it's just about the

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.710 
and look at that it's just about the
perfect<00:03:07.379> length<00:03:07.709> as<00:03:08.069> it<00:03:08.340> is<00:03:08.489> and<00:03:08.760> I<00:03:09.450> could

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
perfect length as it is and I could

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.020 
perfect length as it is and I could
attach<00:03:09.930> the<00:03:10.200> bag<00:03:10.349> that<00:03:10.590> way<00:03:11.030> obviously

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
attach the bag that way obviously

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.539 
attach the bag that way obviously
there's<00:03:12.599> a<00:03:12.659> few<00:03:12.959> more<00:03:13.919> that<00:03:14.159> I<00:03:14.189> would<00:03:14.370> need<00:03:14.489> to

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
there's a few more that I would need to

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:16.399 
there's a few more that I would need to
be<00:03:14.730> attached<00:03:15.030> but<00:03:15.389> you<00:03:15.750> get<00:03:15.900> the<00:03:16.019> basic<00:03:16.319> idea

00:03:16.399 --> 00:03:16.409 
be attached but you get the basic idea

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:19.190 
be attached but you get the basic idea
you've<00:03:16.799> got<00:03:16.980> these<00:03:17.129> clips<00:03:17.879> that<00:03:18.209> are<00:03:18.359> going<00:03:19.079> to

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
you've got these clips that are going to

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.429 
you've got these clips that are going to
clip<00:03:19.560> on<00:03:19.709> and<00:03:19.950> you<00:03:20.489> can<00:03:20.639> easily<00:03:21.090> and<00:03:21.359> quickly

00:03:21.429 --> 00:03:21.439 
clip on and you can easily and quickly

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:24.589 
clip on and you can easily and quickly
take<00:03:22.439> the<00:03:22.500> bag<00:03:22.829> on<00:03:23.760> and<00:03:24.060> off<00:03:24.150> the<00:03:24.329> motorcycle

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:24.599 
take the bag on and off the motorcycle

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:27.080 
take the bag on and off the motorcycle
you<00:03:25.319> can<00:03:25.470> adjust<00:03:25.799> these<00:03:25.950> straps<00:03:26.129> what's<00:03:26.879> nice

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
you can adjust these straps what's nice

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.610 
you can adjust these straps what's nice
about<00:03:27.120> that<00:03:27.419> is<00:03:27.780> they<00:03:27.900> give<00:03:28.049> you<00:03:28.079> a<00:03:28.260> clip

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
about that is they give you a clip

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.379 
about that is they give you a clip
that's<00:03:28.859> going<00:03:29.010> to<00:03:29.069> hold<00:03:29.280> excess<00:03:29.459> material

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:30.389 
that's going to hold excess material

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:32.869 
that's going to hold excess material
down<00:03:30.540> and<00:03:30.810> then<00:03:31.260> there's<00:03:31.439> a<00:03:31.500> velcro<00:03:31.980> loop<00:03:32.250> that

00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:32.879 
down and then there's a velcro loop that

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:35.119 
down and then there's a velcro loop that
you<00:03:33.000> can<00:03:33.180> strap<00:03:33.870> it<00:03:33.900> to<00:03:34.139> itself<00:03:34.439> that's<00:03:34.919> going

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:35.129 
you can strap it to itself that's going

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:36.379 
you can strap it to itself that's going
to<00:03:35.190> prevent<00:03:35.430> flapping<00:03:35.940> obviously<00:03:36.239> you<00:03:36.299> don't

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:36.389 
to prevent flapping obviously you don't

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:39.170 
to prevent flapping obviously you don't
want<00:03:36.510> loose<00:03:37.430> straps<00:03:38.430> flapping<00:03:38.970> in<00:03:39.060> the<00:03:39.090> wind

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
want loose straps flapping in the wind

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.030 
want loose straps flapping in the wind
while<00:03:39.569> you<00:03:39.690> ride<00:03:39.930> but<00:03:40.199> very<00:03:40.560> quick<00:03:40.799> and<00:03:40.979> easy

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
while you ride but very quick and easy

the<00:04:33.900> way<00:04:34.139> around<00:04:34.500> the<00:04:34.710> perimeter<00:04:34.860> on<00:04:35.280> both

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
the way around the perimeter on both

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.730 
the way around the perimeter on both
sides<00:04:35.880> and<00:04:36.150> you<00:04:36.630> can<00:04:36.780> basically<00:04:37.020> see<00:04:37.440> that<00:04:37.470> it

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
sides and you can basically see that it

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.120 
sides and you can basically see that it
extent<00:04:38.400> expands<00:04:39.150> a<00:04:39.240> good<00:04:39.719> bit<00:04:39.990> on<00:04:40.200> both<00:04:40.770> sides

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
extent expands a good bit on both sides

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:42.860

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:44.510 
you see this here this is basically

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:47.350 
you see this here this is basically
a<00:04:44.570> support<00:04:45.260> panel<00:04:45.620> that<00:04:46.010> folds<00:04:46.430> down<00:04:46.490> so<00:04:46.880> that

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 
a support panel that folds down so that

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.150 
a support panel that folds down so that
instead<00:04:48.020> of<00:04:48.080> being<00:04:48.200> able<00:04:48.440> to<00:04:48.560> hang<00:04:48.770> over<00:04:48.920> the

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.160 
instead of being able to hang over the

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.760 
instead of being able to hang over the
side<00:04:49.370> of<00:04:49.550> your<00:04:49.700> bike<00:04:49.910> or<00:04:50.150> seat<00:04:50.660> that<00:04:51.320> panel<00:04:51.710> is

side of your bike or seat that panel is

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:53.170 
side of your bike or seat that panel is
going<00:04:51.920> to<00:04:51.980> kind<00:04:52.130> of<00:04:52.220> maintain<00:04:52.400> the<00:04:52.760> shape<00:04:52.970> of

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
going to kind of maintain the shape of

going to kind of maintain the shape of
the<00:04:53.930> bag<00:04:54.110> itself<00:04:54.500> so<00:04:55.100> that<00:04:55.130> when<00:04:55.370> you<00:04:55.460> are

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
the bag itself so that when you are

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.340 
the bag itself so that when you are
filling<00:04:56.000> it<00:04:56.180> up<00:04:56.330> and<00:04:56.540> loading<00:04:56.870> it<00:04:56.960> down<00:04:57.140> with

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.350 
filling it up and loading it down with

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:00.250 
filling it up and loading it down with
lots<00:04:57.650> of<00:04:57.830> material<00:04:58.310> or<00:04:58.550> lots<00:04:59.420> of<00:04:59.540> things<00:04:59.780> it's

not going to be hanging down or drooping

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:04.600 
not going to be hanging down or drooping
on<00:05:03.110> you<00:05:03.290> so<00:05:03.740> you<00:05:03.800> can<00:05:03.890> go<00:05:03.980> ahead<00:05:04.250> and<00:05:04.430> see<00:05:04.580> if

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.610 
on you so you can go ahead and see if

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:06.820 
on you so you can go ahead and see if
you<00:05:04.760> expand<00:05:05.240> both<00:05:05.450> sides<00:05:05.780> that<00:05:06.380> gives<00:05:06.440> you<00:05:06.800> a

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:06.830 
you expand both sides that gives you a

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:09.430 
you expand both sides that gives you a
very<00:05:07.490> large<00:05:07.790> area<00:05:08.060> and<00:05:08.390> one<00:05:09.200> thing<00:05:09.410> that

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
very large area and one thing that

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.380 
very large area and one thing that
they've<00:05:09.680> definitely<00:05:09.920> improved<00:05:10.580> is<00:05:10.790> the<00:05:11.060> size

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:11.390 
they've definitely improved is the size

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:13.240 
they've definitely improved is the size
of<00:05:11.540> the<00:05:11.690> actual<00:05:11.930> zipper<00:05:12.530> to<00:05:12.650> opening<00:05:13.010> for<00:05:13.190> the
