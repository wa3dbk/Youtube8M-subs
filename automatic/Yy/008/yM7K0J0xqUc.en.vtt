00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.740
 the studies are very clear to demonstrate 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:21.000
 that an excess of protein favors 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:24.310
 obesity breast milk contains 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.610
 relatively little protein in milk 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.930
 artificial there is more us doctors 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.790
 we thought that the Godhead is 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.470
 it was wrong when we invented 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:34.120
 artificial milks sale but not me

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.620
 more children who are alerted with 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.390
 artificial milk not to be 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.420
 significantly greater than to become 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:46.180
 of obese children in cow's milk already 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.910
 much more protein than in the milk of

 mom is also cow's milk we are 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:54.880
 something that helps you gain weight 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:57.310
 in addition to proteins the other large

 factor of obesity that or better 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:02.770
 major public health problems 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.869
 today and they are the refined flours are the 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:08.490
 00 flour zero flour are the 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:11.530
 sugar sugar exaggeration 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.229
 michelle obama two and a half years ago ha 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.270
 announced together with the director of 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:19.630
 department of agriculture of the ministry 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.909
 of US agriculture than in 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.189
 US school canteens not 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:27.340
 there will be no more food like that 

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:29.200
 first ingredient a refined flour 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.659
 we must not give white bread i 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.149
 our kids pasta is fine too 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:36.280
 white is fine because pasta is not 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:38.679
 so harmful it does n't raise your blood sugar 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.509
 so reliably like bread 

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:42.789
 we must not give our fries 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:45.880
 children we must reduce the content of 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:47.409
 potatoes the colleagues of the university of 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.729
 harvard have made a ranking of 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:50.799
 foods that make you fat 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:53.889
 based on their studies of hundreds 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:56.049
 of thousands of health workers 

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:57.850
 who have been following for 40 years now 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:58.810
 periodically completed questionnaires 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.939
 food 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.310
 in the first place there are the fries at 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:05.139
 second place there are the potatoes into equal 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.929
 merit with the meat preserved with the 

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:11.050
 sugary drinks with red meats then 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:12.280
 there are refined flours and sweets 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.030
 butter 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:19.660
 while the one that helps not to get fat 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:22.750
 are whole grains and legumes and le 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.500
 vegetables , fruit, nuts and hazelnuts 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.470
 almonds 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:29.790
 we would like to see these ingredients 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.790
 even in the tables of our children
