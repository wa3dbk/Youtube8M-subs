00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 Hello everyone and welcome finally a 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.799
 new video after maybe almost a month of 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.680
 lam 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:10.349
 this time the second is a calm chaos 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.570
 episode not the barks project I would lie 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.190
 if I told you and I got a good one 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.870
 point for this new project 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.539
 barks because they are actually still in 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:23.550
 high seas because this is what I am 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:27.930
 face a big rock as the 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:30.420
 the last perhaps episode of calm before 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.009
 then the barks bang with Donald Duck 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.570
 mystery of the links ass 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.829
 but we are digressing in this episode of 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:41.129
 calm chaos I'll talk about work number one 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:45.539
 the new headboard proposed by sandwiches 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.860
 comics collaboration with disney referred 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.379
 I took the variant I found in 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.110
 comic and spectacular the variant 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.059
 ingot with face the big face of 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.579
 scrooge the signature of carl barks in bella 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.010
 view transcribed fortune farhat forts 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.079
 bus for the price of 6 euros this version 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.480
 standard instead also the beautiful with 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.979
 illustration taken from the challenge of 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.979
 dollars for 5 euros 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.520
 we can find many stories of 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.020
 which three are the most important or 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.540
 however, the law goes into the challenge of goals 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.780
 game however in the pole star and game 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.670
 but in the house of horseradish and then many 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.860
 short stories 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.750
 plus an unpublished story arkin avoids 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.229
 gori kolossal pino the guard that alas 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:32.009
 even if it is new because it is one of the 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:35.970
 stories made by dan gips on the 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.170
 subject however of carl barks is nothing 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.979
 what a story line of four 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.990
 pages 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.780
 so let's get to the volume that 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.720
 he uses a card that I know for many 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.930
 it is not particularly welcome 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.210
 similar to the one used by the old man from 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.840
 old pound of oberon and of which the adc 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.939
 among other things, he becomes heir, he becomes heir 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.149
 legitimate of the old was for 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.950
 collectors said feron in this 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.619
 headline will be repeated for stories 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.380
 by carl barks author that as you know 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:10.560
 I particularly love and referred to this 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:13.760
 pushing point proposing all the 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.840
 stories in my barks project 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:20.630
 look through my channel 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:23.910
 find this this initiative then 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:26.400
 initially I don't know what else to say if 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:29.550
 not that I recommend it to anyone who 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:33.750
 they know little or nothing I hope anyone 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:36.750
 your own nothing but so much of carl 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.550
 barks and on the mind something to take 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:44.160
 a monthly fee costs 5 euros 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:45.590
 however, there are around 125 pages and a second 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.130
 me really value for money 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:51.930
 very high then already in this first issue 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.850
 you will find the to write dollars and the 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.680
 pole star in particular that I am 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:03:02.880
 then two masterpieces we will talk about better 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:05.430
 deb contained in the parks project though 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.860
 there is also to say that it is aroused that it is 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.670
 not very appealing to those who know 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.230
 already 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:15.690
 the work of the oregon master because 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:18.510
 the editorials do not say anything new 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.520
 since they are entrusted to the usual two 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.850
 very experienced figures but they are always 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:26.400
 suite and 2 luca bosco and alberto 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.140
 becattini that for those who already already 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:32.220
 knows the March work of oregon has 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:34.380
 already got to read their le 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.090
 their visions of their views on both 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:39.660
 this is the smell that on the stories about 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:44.580
 individual stories that are presented in 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:46.590
 plus the story born as I told you 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.989
 first of all it is nothing at all e 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:53.100
 very forgettable serves only to 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:54.600
 maximum philological purposes and just purposes 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.350
 of completeness and just for the 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:00.450
 collector but nothing 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:03.780
 transcendental and then we have a perfume 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:06.360
 precisely a study on the life of 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:09.090
 carl barks but it already has anyway 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.680
 published in others in other locations then 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.600
 however for the collector there is not 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.959
 for those who already know the connoisseur 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:17.609
 I already have nothing of parks 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:19.580
 palatable for this new magazine for 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:21.660
 the first number just searched 

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:24.090
 let's start I took off the whim 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.020
 at least they do not live in doubt if 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.310
 will continue takes 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.319
 no because I clearly do not 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.210
 but continue to those who know me little or 

00:04:28.319 --> 00:04:31.470
 nothing this is the manna from heaven also 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.500
 because in any case it reproposes in a manner 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:36.860
 chronological all the stories that 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.360
 are published at the time are 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.669
 the American uncle scrooge that is actually 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.979
 in this first issue there are three 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:45.770
 stories that were published as evidence 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:50.039
 general for uncle scrooge let's say so 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:52.740
 on folcklore green comics writing it 

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:55.110
 be the pole and home of rafah manta 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.270
 next less in fact they will come 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.620
 proposals the stories that was published 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.409
 in the same order 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:03.780
 here they were published on uncle scrooge 

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:05.909
 which is precisely the American newspaper shares 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:09.199
 from the number 4 point because there were 

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:13.919
 these three general proofs published on 

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:17.750
 forfour color comics is nothing the duck 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:21.469
 in ghetto and sideburns pleased and then later 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:24.659
 dedicated a magazine just for him 

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:26.129
 so either the format is the same as the 

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:29.310
 great dynasty of the ducks among other things is 

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:31.469
 exactly I see is exactly it 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:35.159
 same then anyway really not there 

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:37.409
 there is no right reason 

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:41.550
 to be able to buy for those who already had 

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:46.229
 way of knowing the work of the cathedral of 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:48.060
 so I hope you will buy it if 

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:50.279
 in fact you don't know much about karbala 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.840
 you know why the history of capri volume la 

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:54.000
 challenge dollars and then the evening of 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:56.550
 polo shirts are two masterpieces then we will see it 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.259
 well in detail this video nuti us 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:00.150
 let's see hopefully soon with the project 

00:05:58.259 --> 00:06:02.930
 barks episode 5 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.930
 Hi everyone
