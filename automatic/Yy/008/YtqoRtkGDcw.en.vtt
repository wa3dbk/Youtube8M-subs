this<00:01:34.670> that<00:01:35.670> bolt<00:01:35.970> there<00:01:36.440> and<00:01:37.440> that<00:01:37.890> bolt<00:01:38.130> there

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
this that bolt there and that bolt there

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.050 
this that bolt there and that bolt there
when<00:01:40.290> she<00:01:40.500> gets<00:01:40.680> that<00:01:40.860> off<00:01:41.040> put<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.760> new<00:01:41.910> one

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
when she gets that off put the new one

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.750 
when she gets that off put the new one
on<00:01:42.180> which<00:01:42.450> is<00:01:42.630> substantially<00:01:43.260> bigger<00:01:43.760> than

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:44.760 
on which is substantially bigger than

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.510 
on which is substantially bigger than
that<00:01:44.940> old<00:01:45.180> one<00:01:45.620> but<00:01:46.620> when<00:01:46.770> we're<00:01:46.890> driving<00:01:47.100> it

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
that old one but when we're driving it

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.450 
that old one but when we're driving it
causes<00:01:47.940> when<00:01:48.750> you<00:01:48.870> hit<00:01:48.990> a<00:01:49.020> rut<00:01:49.500> or<00:01:49.770> a<00:01:49.800> snow<00:01:50.190> pile

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
causes when you hit a rut or a snow pile

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.980 
causes when you hit a rut or a snow pile
in<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.760> middle<00:01:50.970> of<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.090> road<00:01:51.240> it<00:01:51.540> pulls<00:01:51.780> the

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
in the middle of the road it pulls the

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.860 
in the middle of the road it pulls the
truck<00:01:52.200> because<00:01:52.440> it's<00:01:53.330> wheels<00:01:54.330> don't<00:01:54.540> want<00:01:54.780> to

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:54.870 
truck because it's wheels don't want to

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.130 
truck because it's wheels don't want to
center<00:01:55.170> with<00:01:55.320> each<00:01:55.440> other<00:01:56.720> so<00:01:57.720> we<00:01:57.810> replace

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
center with each other so we replace

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.630 
center with each other so we replace
that<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.560> see<00:01:58.680> if<00:01:58.710> that<00:01:58.890> solves<00:01:59.100> it<00:01:59.370> should

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
that and see if that solves it should

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.710 
that and see if that solves it should
stiffen<00:02:00.030> up<00:02:00.120> the<00:02:00.240> steering<00:02:01.160> make<00:02:02.160> it<00:02:02.280> nice

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
stiffen up the steering make it nice

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.590 
stiffen up the steering make it nice
easy<00:02:03.720> to<00:02:03.960> drive<00:02:04.550> but<00:02:05.550> you<00:02:06.180> know<00:02:06.270> that's<00:02:06.390> what

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
easy to drive but you know that's what

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
easy to drive but you know that's what
you<00:02:06.660> get<00:02:06.870> when<00:02:06.990> you<00:02:07.110> get<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.350> old-school

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:07.620 
you get when you get the old-school

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:12.259 
you get when you get the old-school
style<00:02:08.069> stuff<00:02:08.420> linkage<00:02:10.099> steering<00:02:11.099> on<00:02:11.269> because

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:12.269 
style stuff linkage steering on because

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:15.050 
style stuff linkage steering on because
of<00:02:12.390> that<00:02:12.510> monster<00:02:13.110> thing<00:02:13.319> sitting<00:02:13.650> there<00:02:14.060> even

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
of that monster thing sitting there even

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.870 
of that monster thing sitting there even
also<00:02:15.210> like<00:02:15.420> a<00:02:15.450> 30

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
also like a 30

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.190 
also like a 30
all<00:02:17.880> right<00:02:18.000> so<00:02:18.300> we<00:02:18.420> ran<00:02:18.600> into<00:02:18.750> a<00:02:18.840> couple<00:02:18.870> issues

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
all right so we ran into a couple issues

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.150 
all right so we ran into a couple issues
first<00:02:19.710> off<00:02:19.920> its<00:02:20.130> rusty<00:02:20.520> and<00:02:20.640> seats<00:02:21.030> and

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
first off its rusty and seats and

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:31.240 
first off its rusty and seats and
so<00:02:23.160> we<00:02:23.340> use<00:02:23.550> Oh<00:02:28.310> looks<00:02:29.310> like<00:02:29.460> fence<00:02:29.730> post<00:02:30.090> to

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
so we use Oh looks like fence post to

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.320 
so we use Oh looks like fence post to
