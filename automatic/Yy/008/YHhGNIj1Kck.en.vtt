there's<00:00:20.130> no<00:00:20.279> debating<00:00:20.689> it's<00:00:21.689> one<00:00:21.840> of<00:00:21.930> the<00:00:22.020> best

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:22.609 
there's no debating it's one of the best

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:25.820 
there's no debating it's one of the best
exercises<00:00:23.609> for<00:00:24.029> that<00:00:24.689> rotational<00:00:25.350> movement

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
exercises for that rotational movement

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.210 
exercises for that rotational movement
really<00:00:26.760> build<00:00:26.970> up<00:00:27.289> what<00:00:28.289> we<00:00:28.380> call<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.710> front

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
really build up what we call the front

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.450 
really build up what we call the front
area<00:00:29.490> of<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.570> core<00:00:30.810> being<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:31.230> deep<00:00:31.560> abdominal

muscles<00:00:32.820> and<00:00:33.540> a<00:00:33.660> lot<00:00:33.840> of<00:00:33.960> other<00:00:34.110> muscles<00:00:34.380> that

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
muscles and a lot of other muscles that

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.370 
muscles and a lot of other muscles that
I<00:00:34.770> won't<00:00:35.250> even<00:00:35.460> bore<00:00:35.640> you<00:00:35.820> with<00:00:35.850> I<00:00:36.239> like<00:00:37.110> doing

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
I won't even bore you with I like doing

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.920 
I won't even bore you with I like doing
an<00:00:37.500> exercise<00:00:37.980> that's<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.820> modified<00:00:39.390> landmine

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
an exercise that's a modified landmine

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.299 
an exercise that's a modified landmine
it's<00:00:40.410> what<00:00:40.649> I<00:00:40.680> call<00:00:41.149> dead<00:00:42.149> land<00:00:42.570> mines<00:00:43.309> because

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
it's what I call dead land mines because

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.290 
it's what I call dead land mines because
it<00:00:44.910> involves<00:00:45.600> a<00:00:45.809> deadlift<00:00:46.800> with<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.850> landmine

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
it involves a deadlift with the landmine

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.810 
it involves a deadlift with the landmine
movement<00:00:48.870> which<00:00:49.530> converts<00:00:50.039> this<00:00:50.250> exercise

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
movement which converts this exercise

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.319 
movement which converts this exercise
from<00:00:51.120> just<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.539> core<00:00:51.780> exercise<00:00:52.699> into<00:00:53.699> a<00:00:53.730> full

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
from just the core exercise into a full

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.310 
from just the core exercise into a full
body<00:00:54.600> exercise

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
body exercise

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.849 
body exercise
now<00:00:55.739> a<00:00:56.149> couple<00:00:57.149> ways<00:00:57.420> that<00:00:57.750> you<00:00:58.289> can<00:00:58.530> use<00:00:58.680> this

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
now a couple ways that you can use this

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.810 
now a couple ways that you can use this
in<00:00:59.430> your<00:00:59.489> training<00:01:00.030> but<00:01:00.899> let's<00:01:01.109> break<00:01:01.379> down

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
in your training but let's break down

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:08.300 
in your training but let's break down
the<00:01:02.820> way<00:01:03.059> to<00:01:03.629> do<00:01:04.339> dead<00:01:05.339> land<00:01:06.030> mines<00:01:06.330> now<00:01:07.310> with

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
the way to do dead land mines now with

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.740 
the way to do dead land mines now with
land<00:01:08.610> mines<00:01:08.880> you're<00:01:09.270> going<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.450> take<00:01:09.720> a

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.910 
to load just one end now now they do
sell<00:01:21.360> landmine<00:01:22.170> adapters<00:01:22.830> which<00:01:23.540> allow<00:01:24.540> you

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
sell landmine adapters which allow you

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.090 
sell landmine adapters which allow you
to<00:01:25.920> put<00:01:26.130> one<00:01:26.159> end<00:01:26.729> of<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.000> barbell<00:01:27.650> into<00:01:28.650> this

floor either way you want to stabilize

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.990 
floor either way you want to stabilize
one<00:02:10.619> end<00:02:10.860> of<00:02:11.160> the<00:02:12.030> bottom<00:02:12.420> you

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
one end of the bottom you

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.050 
one end of the bottom you
and<00:02:13.540> then<00:02:13.690> you're<00:02:13.810> going<00:02:13.930> to<00:02:13.990> load<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:15.370> end

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
and then you're going to load the end

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.310 
and then you're going to load the end
that's<00:02:16.990> your<00:02:17.260> lifter<00:02:17.680> so<00:02:18.420> load<00:02:19.420> that<00:02:19.690> up<00:02:19.720> start

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
that's your lifter so load that up start

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.170 
that's your lifter so load that up start
with<00:02:20.440> light<00:02:20.680> weight<00:02:21.090> now<00:02:22.090> a<00:02:23.400> typical<00:02:24.400> landmine

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
with light weight now a typical landmine

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.260 
with light weight now a typical landmine
you<00:02:26.170> basically<00:02:26.620> start<00:02:27.070> facing<00:02:27.460> it<00:02:27.940> and<00:02:27.970> then

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
you basically start facing it and then

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.220 
you basically start facing it and then
the<00:02:28.450> only<00:02:28.570> real<00:02:28.870> movement<00:02:29.380> is<00:02:30.210> the<00:02:31.210> arms<00:02:31.600> and

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
the only real movement is the arms and

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:38.850 
the only real movement is the arms and
the<00:02:33.160> torso<00:02:34.110> it<00:02:35.110> really<00:02:35.440> helps<00:02:35.800> to<00:02:36.900> work<00:02:37.900> the

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
the torso it really helps to work the

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:45.570 
the torso it really helps to work the
core<00:02:39.840> with<00:02:40.840> dead<00:02:42.420> landmines<00:02:44.250> you're<00:02:45.250> going<00:02:45.459> to

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
core with dead landmines you're going to

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.420 
core with dead landmines you're going to
involve<00:02:46.440> your<00:02:47.440> legs<00:02:47.770> so<00:02:48.010> this<00:02:48.130> is<00:02:48.190> going<00:02:48.310> to<00:02:48.370> be

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
involve your legs so this is going to be

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.880 
involve your legs so this is going to be
a<00:02:48.459> whole<00:02:48.670> body<00:02:48.910> exercise<00:02:49.090> so<00:02:49.870> the<00:02:50.020> reason<00:02:50.800> I

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
a whole body exercise so the reason I

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.470 
a whole body exercise so the reason I
call<00:02:51.070> it<00:02:51.100> deadly<00:02:51.550> in<00:02:51.670> mind<00:02:51.880> is<00:02:52.030> because<00:02:52.330> we

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
call it deadly in mind is because we

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.940 
call it deadly in mind is because we
start<00:02:52.840> like<00:02:53.200> a<00:02:53.230> deadlift

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
start like a deadlift

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.080 
start like a deadlift
with<00:02:54.610> the<00:02:54.730> bar<00:02:55.000> at<00:02:55.300> a<00:02:55.360> dead<00:02:55.720> stop<00:02:56.050> on<00:02:56.320> the<00:02:56.620> floor

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
with the bar at a dead stop on the floor

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.540 
with the bar at a dead stop on the floor
now<00:02:58.090> we're<00:02:58.780> going<00:02:58.870> to<00:02:58.959> stand<00:02:59.470> with<00:03:00.990> the<00:03:01.990> weight

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
now we're going to stand with the weight

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.880 
now we're going to stand with the weight
about<00:03:03.550> in<00:03:03.880> the<00:03:04.120> middle<00:03:04.420> of<00:03:04.840> your<00:03:05.380> legs<00:03:05.650> you<00:03:05.800> can

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
about in the middle of your legs you can

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.020 
about in the middle of your legs you can
see<00:03:06.130> in<00:03:06.220> sideways<00:03:06.900> to<00:03:07.900> the<00:03:08.050> bar<00:03:08.850> with<00:03:09.850> the

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
see in sideways to the bar with the

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.260 
see in sideways to the bar with the
loaded<00:03:10.390> end<00:03:10.570> between<00:03:11.020> your<00:03:11.530> feet<00:03:12.270> you're

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:13.270 
loaded end between your feet you're

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:17.840 
loaded end between your feet you're
going<00:03:13.300> to<00:03:13.480> reach<00:03:13.660> down<00:03:13.990> grab<00:03:15.180> the<00:03:16.180> very<00:03:16.390> end<00:03:16.780> of

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
going to reach down grab the very end of

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:22.729 
going to reach down grab the very end of
the<00:03:18.850> barbell<00:03:19.300> the<00:03:19.450> weight<00:03:19.600> of<00:03:19.840> the<00:03:19.930> barbell

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:25.740 

here's<00:03:23.739> where<00:03:24.010> the<00:03:24.790> debt<00:03:25.030> comes<00:03:25.300> in<00:03:25.480> so<00:03:25.600> it's

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
here's where the debt comes in so it's

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.740 
here's where the debt comes in so it's
going<00:03:25.900> to<00:03:26.430> be<00:03:27.430> very<00:03:27.670> similar<00:03:28.030> to<00:03:28.180> the<00:03:28.360> start<00:03:28.660> of

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
going to be very similar to the start of

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.430 
going to be very similar to the start of
a<00:03:28.840> deadlift<00:03:29.230> you're<00:03:29.980> going<00:03:30.160> to<00:03:30.250> squat<00:03:30.550> down

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
a deadlift you're going to squat down

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.979 
a deadlift you're going to squat down
then<00:03:32.440> get<00:03:32.680> the<00:03:32.800> hips<00:03:33.040> and<00:03:33.340> the<00:03:33.610> knees<00:03:33.640> and<00:03:34.239> then

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
then get the hips and the knees and then

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:38.550 
then get the hips and the knees and then
you're<00:03:35.380> going<00:03:35.500> to<00:03:35.560> bring<00:03:35.860> it<00:03:36.040> up<00:03:37.080> but<00:03:38.080> here<00:03:38.410> now

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
you're going to bring it up but here now

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.610 
you're going to bring it up but here now
you're<00:03:38.739> going<00:03:38.860> to<00:03:38.920> have<00:03:39.010> to<00:03:39.100> pivot<00:03:39.430> your<00:03:40.620> feet

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
you're going to have to pivot your feet

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.330 
you're going to have to pivot your feet
around<00:03:41.799> and<00:03:42.510> then<00:03:43.510> we<00:03:44.440> can<00:03:44.620> end<00:03:44.830> up<00:03:44.920> bringing

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
around and then we can end up bringing

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.410 
around and then we can end up bringing
it<00:03:45.519> down<00:03:45.730> to<00:03:46.630> the<00:03:46.810> floor<00:03:47.019> on<00:03:47.500> the<00:03:47.680> other<00:03:47.799> side

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
it down to the floor on the other side

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.380 
it down to the floor on the other side
the<00:03:49.420> weight<00:03:50.190> landing<00:03:51.190> between<00:03:51.430> your<00:03:51.850> feet<00:03:52.120> now

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 
the weight landing between your feet now

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.840 
the weight landing between your feet now
you're<00:03:52.630> on<00:03:52.690> the<00:03:52.810> opposite<00:03:53.230> side<00:03:53.730> then<00:03:54.730> you

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850 
you're on the opposite side then you

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:59.250 
you're on the opposite side then you
switch<00:03:55.090> over

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.229 

now<00:04:00.260> that's<00:04:00.590> just<00:04:00.830> the<00:04:00.920> slow<00:04:01.190> version<00:04:01.430> show

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239 
now that's just the slow version show

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:04.830 
now that's just the slow version show
you<00:04:02.299> mechanics<00:04:02.989> in<00:04:03.110> bottle<00:04:03.409> but<00:04:03.760> basically

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
you mechanics in bottle but basically

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.110 
you mechanics in bottle but basically
you<00:04:05.840> want<00:04:05.989> to<00:04:06.049> do<00:04:06.230> this<00:04:06.440> as<00:04:07.280> quickly<00:04:07.730> and<00:04:08.000> as

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
you want to do this as quickly and as

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.009 
you want to do this as quickly and as
explosively

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019 
explosively

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:47.800 
explosively
as<00:04:09.290> possible<00:04:09.950> so<00:04:45.340> now<00:04:46.389> it's<00:04:47.389> a<00:04:47.449> few<00:04:47.660> ways<00:04:47.780> you

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
as possible so now it's a few ways you

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.580 
as possible so now it's a few ways you
can<00:04:48.139> use<00:04:49.100> this<00:04:49.250> exercise<00:04:49.870> to<00:04:50.870> your<00:04:51.020> benefit

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
can use this exercise to your benefit

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.860 
can use this exercise to your benefit
it's<00:04:52.520> a<00:04:52.550> great<00:04:52.760> way<00:04:52.880> to<00:04:52.910> build<00:04:53.150> explosive

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:53.870 
it's a great way to build explosive

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.500 
it's a great way to build explosive
power<00:04:54.130> in<00:04:55.130> the<00:04:55.280> legs<00:04:55.490> while<00:04:56.330> you're

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.510 
power in the legs while you're

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:58.840 
power in the legs while you're
strengthening<00:04:56.750> the<00:04:57.139> core<00:04:57.380> so<00:04:58.340> you<00:04:58.430> can<00:04:58.669> use

00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:58.850 
strengthening the core so you can use

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:02.439 
strengthening the core so you can use
this<00:04:59.030> as<00:04:59.840> a<00:04:59.990> strength<00:05:00.470> or<00:05:00.949> power<00:05:00.979> builder<00:05:01.610> for

00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:02.449 
this as a strength or power builder for

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:05.950 
this as a strength or power builder for
power<00:05:02.690> I<00:05:03.050> put<00:05:03.740> on<00:05:03.860> about<00:05:04.160> 50<00:05:04.970> somewhere<00:05:05.419> around

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:05.960 
power I put on about 50 somewhere around

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.540 
power I put on about 50 somewhere around
50<00:05:06.620> 60<00:05:07.250> %<00:05:07.669> of<00:05:07.880> your<00:05:08.870> 1<00:05:09.110> rep<00:05:09.289> max<00:05:09.320> on<00:05:09.889> this

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550 
50 60 % of your 1 rep max on this

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:14.529 
50 60 % of your 1 rep max on this
exercise<00:05:11.180> and<00:05:11.990> then<00:05:12.110> do<00:05:12.260> about<00:05:12.500> three<00:05:13.090> to<00:05:14.090> six

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:14.539 
exercise and then do about three to six

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:16.480 
exercise and then do about three to six
maybe<00:05:14.930> eight<00:05:15.229> reps<00:05:15.530> tops<00:05:15.889> remember<00:05:16.400> when

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
maybe eight reps tops remember when

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.100 
maybe eight reps tops remember when
you're<00:05:16.610> building<00:05:16.789> power<00:05:17.150> I'm<00:05:17.810> going<00:05:17.870> to<00:05:18.020> be

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.110 
you're building power I'm going to be

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:21.490 
you're building power I'm going to be
going<00:05:18.289> explosively<00:05:19.360> maximize<00:05:20.360> the<00:05:21.320> use<00:05:21.470> of

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:21.500 
going explosively maximize the use of

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.500 
going explosively maximize the use of
those<00:05:21.710> Fester's<00:05:22.190> muscle<00:05:22.550> fibers<00:05:22.849> the<00:05:23.240> point

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:23.510 
those Fester's muscle fibers the point

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:25.990 
those Fester's muscle fibers the point
is<00:05:23.660> not<00:05:23.780> the<00:05:23.840> fatigue<00:05:24.430> so<00:05:25.430> you<00:05:25.520> could<00:05:25.700> use<00:05:25.820> it

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 
is not the fatigue so you could use it

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.730 
is not the fatigue so you could use it
for<00:05:26.030> power<00:05:26.360> in<00:05:26.900> order<00:05:26.990> to<00:05:27.200> use<00:05:27.410> it<00:05:27.560> for

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:27.740 
for power in order to use it for

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:30.670 
for power in order to use it for
strength<00:05:28.120> to<00:05:29.120> help<00:05:29.300> with<00:05:29.570> your<00:05:29.660> deadlift<00:05:30.110> and

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680 
strength to help with your deadlift and

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.370 
strength to help with your deadlift and
your<00:05:31.010> squat<00:05:31.340> strength<00:05:31.669> there<00:05:32.630> I<00:05:32.660> load<00:05:33.080> it<00:05:33.110> up

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:33.380 
your squat strength there I load it up

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:36.279 
your squat strength there I load it up
to<00:05:34.300> rep<00:05:35.300> range<00:05:35.570> that<00:05:35.810> limits<00:05:36.139> you<00:05:36.260> from

00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:36.289 
to rep range that limits you from

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:38.560 
to rep range that limits you from
anywhere<00:05:36.740> from<00:05:36.919> three<00:05:37.310> to<00:05:37.820> maybe<00:05:38.000> eight<00:05:38.270> reps
