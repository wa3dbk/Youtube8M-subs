degree of interest in so we're giving

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:00.740 
degree of interest in so we're giving
children<00:02:59.159> different<00:02:59.760> opportunities<00:03:00.420> to<00:03:00.599> do

with the fact that it's a very safe
environment<00:04:06.460> but<00:04:07.210> I<00:04:07.240> think<00:04:07.600> they're<00:04:07.810> looking

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
environment but I think they're looking

environment but I think they're looking
for<00:04:08.590> their<00:04:09.070> own<00:04:09.100> space<00:04:09.550> it's<00:04:10.420> very<00:04:10.690> important

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:11.080 
for their own space it's very important

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.080

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:17.829 
grown-ups have which is why we've really

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:19.860
