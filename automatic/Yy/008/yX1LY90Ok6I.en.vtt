00:00:02.949 --> 00:00:11.650
 welcome you to the game channel for 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:11.650
 weak pc and today we have you ready children 

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:26.470
 zone 51 computer game in the genre of shooter 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.580
 first person developed by 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.180
 midway studios 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:34.050
 austin and published midway games 2005 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:38.440
 for playstation 2 and xbox and songs 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.480
 is a remake of the 1995 game of the same name 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.120
 years for those who do not know 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:47.350
 midway games this company created already 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.790
 back in 1958 and then she 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.270
 specialized in manufacturing 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:54.690
 equipment for rides but later 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:57.610
 migrated to the gaming market 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:02.350
 1978 released the first game 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:04.839
 automatic so that 's what I'm in two thousand 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:08.320
 years not two games was no longer a cake 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:10.300
 as a result it went bankrupt in 2009 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.520
 mostly a large proportion of the revenue was about 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.659
 discounting and edition of games from 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.770
 third party companies 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:19.990
 but their products were zone 51 this 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.240
 one of the last breaths of midway games 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:25.420
 despite the fact that the game itself is 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:28.810
 remake of the same product released 10 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:31.750
 years ago that is you took an idea which 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:34.270
 was relevant 10 years ago and just 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.340
 changed the grafon what you hope for 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:40.240
 plot twist disturbing minds 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:43.650
 teenagers 1995 he could not repeat that 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:47.040
 same success in 2005 why you ask 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.420
 and we will explain now the story of the terrible 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.820
 a virus from another planet which 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.300
 enslaved by humanity can be considered not 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.430
 more than canonical and no wonder 20 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.700
 years ago it was a great storyline 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.100
 move 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.230
 you can think of anything 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.810
 and here 10 years ago 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:06.390
 similar thoughts caused emetic urges 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.759
 since filmed a good hundred film by 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.740
 this topic and about the game, I generally keep quiet 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.050
 but midway games 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.300
 this did not stop and as a result we 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.420
 we have a militant with the slogan stop 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:21.330
 infection thanks but let's take a look 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.490
 consider all aspects of the plot as 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.709
 said before the main idea is 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.090
 confrontation of the protagonist and the crowd 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:30.000
 alien evil spirits 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:33.270
 part of which is infected people nothing 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.060
 doesn't remind yes okay you are a squad fighter 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:39.209
 chemical protection bravo arrivals zone 51 by 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.790
 emergency call what happened yes in 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:45.060
 Basically nothing terrible just one 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:47.220
 distraught scientist decided to have fun and 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.130
 set free an unknown little animal 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.470
 with dimensions of 2 by 2 meters normal 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.650
 the situation is not true rick in the end all 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:59.190
 infected are all infected and on finding out 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:01.440
 reasons send five people yes it 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.050
 it is logical when something shoveled all 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.180
 your underground lab due 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.080
 what is the connection lost and spray everywhere 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.270
 of blood 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.460
 the most logical would be to send there as 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:14.620
 can less people on this plot 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:17.409
 nothing breaks 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.989
 yes this is another game with the meaning 

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:23.319
 load shoot run and shoot leagues 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:27.459
 killed a comrade cry cry shoot cry 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:30.190
 shoot the end of the graphics in the game beyond the years 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:32.680
 bad but unlike any gourmet to us 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:35.319
 here the developers understood that the hands 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:38.079
 growing out of a place that just below the back is not 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:40.360
 pretend to create a masterpiece therefore 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:42.730
 made a bet on the scale and it 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:45.250
 turned out pretty good that is when 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.620
 in front of you opens a huge door and 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:50.590
 because of her crowd of monsters runs out 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:53.319
 it is epic in and of itself when 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.420
 this has something to blow up or break something 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:57.370
 there are no words 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.390
 design opponents makes you hiccup 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.299
 gueba newell 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:03.730
 for you will remember him not once 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:06.430
 the brightest half-life series 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.459
 copies are of course like slaves infected 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.459
 scientists 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:10.970
 branded puzzles are simply not there 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:13.579
 of words 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.319
 words are found only when you are not 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:18.289
 find the differences between 10 different 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:20.419
 locations in level design leaves 

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:23.840
 wish for the best gimpl and 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:25.789
 and the gameplay, too much can not be said 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.860
 nothing but shoot religion you 

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:30.020
 will offer a couple of times you will meet 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.750
 tasks like turn on the switch and before 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.300
 this style and run but it is not essential 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.800
 the difference is not the same 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.479
 the main chip is built on a huge 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.070
 the number of opponents who literally 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:42.680
 climb from all crevices 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:46.009
 I would like to note the intelligence of the allies 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:48.139
 and there are no opponents 

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:51.139
 here you are not worried about 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:53.240
 one of these idiots did not die for you 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:56.270
 watching die 4 wolverines 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:59.960
 that nothing is scary and dies and not 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:01.610
 just for the plot it 's so cool from 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.069
 nice features opportunity 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.849
 banging your butt sometimes 

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:07.460
 helps out 

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:09.680
 for the patron is always few enemies sometimes 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:13.039
 seem endless and what's Chinese 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:15.080
 atmosphere of horror and hopelessness on this 

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:17.839
 nice features end 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:21.830
 ah no main character voiced by david 

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:25.009
 spiritual yes guys spent a lot of money 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:29.569
 to the fee of a famous guy instead 

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:31.069
 to make a normal logic engine in 

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:32.809
 the whole product is playable 

00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:35.539

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:41.149
 appreciate this creation is a prime example 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.809
 that when everything seems not bad but also not 

00:05:41.149 --> 00:05:44.209
 OK 

00:05:41.809 --> 00:05:46.520
 dokrutiv graphic part adding 

00:05:44.209 --> 00:05:49.219
 normal plot and making a variety 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:50.529
 among npc developers obviously you donâ€™t 

00:05:49.219 --> 00:05:52.899
 lost 

00:05:50.529 --> 00:05:55.299
 but who needs it when you're the whole game 

00:05:52.899 --> 00:05:57.179
