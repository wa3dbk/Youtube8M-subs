00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.520 
has monkey bars those are great but you
probably<00:03:39.989> can<00:03:40.860> get<00:03:41.099> some<00:03:41.430> bars<00:03:42.319> you<00:03:43.319> just

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
probably can get some bars you just

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:49.550 
probably can get some bars you just
gotta<00:03:47.510> um<00:03:48.510> you<00:03:48.750> got<00:03:48.900> to<00:03:49.019> order<00:03:49.140> them<00:03:49.380> online

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
gotta um you got to order them online

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.140 
gotta um you got to order them online
you<00:03:49.950> can't<00:03:50.130> really<00:03:50.400> get<00:03:50.549> them<00:03:50.700> at<00:03:50.819> local

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
you can't really get them at local

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.720 
you can't really get them at local
stores<00:03:51.269> and<00:03:51.780> they<00:03:51.840> cost<00:03:52.079> a<00:03:52.290> lot<00:03:52.440> so<00:03:52.920> and<00:03:53.160> you

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
stores and they cost a lot so and you

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.330 
stores and they cost a lot so and you
can<00:03:53.880> also<00:03:54.000> get<00:03:54.239> a<00:03:54.390> low<00:03:54.690> beam<00:03:55.010> you<00:03:56.010> probably

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
can also get a low beam you probably

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.680 
can also get a low beam you probably
can't<00:03:56.549> practice<00:03:56.940> on<00:03:57.060> a<00:03:57.090> high<00:03:57.299> beam<00:03:57.540> because

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
can't practice on a high beam because

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.900 
can't practice on a high beam because
high<00:03:57.959> beams<00:03:58.260> of<00:03:58.380> cost<00:03:58.890> like<00:03:59.099> a<00:03:59.160> lot<00:03:59.489> but<00:03:59.730> low

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
high beams of cost like a lot but low

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.160 
high beams of cost like a lot but low
beams<00:04:00.150> could<00:04:00.389> probably<00:04:00.630> only<00:04:00.840> cost<00:04:01.079> like

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
beams could probably only cost like

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.160 
beams could probably only cost like
fifty<00:04:02.130> to<00:04:02.760> ninety<00:04:02.790> dollars<00:04:03.209> depending<00:04:03.810> on

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
fifty to ninety dollars depending on

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.259 
fifty to ninety dollars depending on
like<00:04:04.350> what<00:04:04.560> company<00:04:05.069> and<00:04:05.220> stuff<00:04:05.459> had<00:04:06.090> the

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
like what company and stuff had the

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:07.910 
like what company and stuff had the
length<00:04:06.480> of<00:04:06.660> the<00:04:06.810> beam<00:04:06.989> and<00:04:07.260> you<00:04:07.410> can<00:04:07.560> fold<00:04:07.799> it

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
length of the beam and you can fold it

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:15.020 
length of the beam and you can fold it
up<00:04:08.510> so<00:04:09.510> yeah<00:04:09.810> I<00:04:12.829> got<00:04:13.829> a<00:04:13.859> request<00:04:14.340> from<00:04:14.579> Lady
