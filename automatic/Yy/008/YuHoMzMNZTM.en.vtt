00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.160 
things on the back no your students feel
that<00:00:03.959> vibration<00:00:04.200> no<00:00:05.660> there<00:00:06.660> the<00:00:06.779> whole<00:00:06.870> way<00:00:07.049> up

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
that vibration no there the whole way up

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.330 
that vibration no there the whole way up
here<00:00:07.350> why<00:00:07.589> would<00:00:07.649> I<00:00:07.830> feel<00:00:08.040> a<00:00:08.069> vibration

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
here why would I feel a vibration

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.430 
here why would I feel a vibration
because<00:00:09.030> it's<00:00:09.389> a<00:00:09.450> little<00:00:09.690> for<00:00:09.840> I<00:00:09.870> feel<00:00:10.260> it

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
because it's a little for I feel it

you<00:00:28.619> didn't<00:00:28.769> feel<00:00:28.920> that<00:00:28.970> no<00:00:30.050> I<00:00:31.050> don't<00:00:31.710> see<00:00:32.009> it

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:32.129 
you didn't feel that no I don't see it

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:34.460 
you didn't feel that no I don't see it
either<00:00:32.390> you<00:00:33.390> know<00:00:33.480> we're<00:00:33.720> not<00:00:33.840> going<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.140> see

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
it if it doesn't go like Blake Blake it

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.069 
it if it doesn't go like Blake Blake it
doesn't<00:00:37.559> go<00:00:38.090> it's<00:00:39.090> just<00:00:39.329> watch<00:00:39.660> they<00:00:39.899> lower

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
doesn't go it's just watch they lower

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.330 
doesn't go it's just watch they lower
down<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.530> thing<00:00:40.769> in<00:00:40.949> the<00:00:41.010> middle<00:00:41.129> of<00:00:41.280> the

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
down the thing in the middle of the

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.880 
down the thing in the middle of the
truck<00:00:41.579> between<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:42.000> wheels<00:00:42.149> you<00:00:42.329> see<00:00:42.510> it<00:00:42.629> oh

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:51.290 

you<00:00:46.890> feel<00:00:47.190> that<00:00:47.370> I<00:00:47.690> only<00:00:48.690> think<00:00:49.079> because<00:00:50.300> just

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
you feel that I only think because just

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.750 
you feel that I only think because just
a<00:00:51.420> little<00:00:51.690> bit<00:00:51.839> oh<00:00:52.019> yeah<00:00:52.650> then<00:00:52.920> I<00:00:53.010> do<00:00:53.070> it<00:00:53.579> I

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
a little bit oh yeah then I do it I

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.149 
a little bit oh yeah then I do it I
thought<00:00:54.089> that<00:00:54.269> it'd<00:00:54.390> be<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:54.960> little<00:00:55.110> fun<00:00:55.500> well

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:56.159 
thought that it'd be a little fun well

00:00:56.159 --> 00:01:11.850 
thought that it'd be a little fun well
it's<00:00:56.610> a<00:00:56.730> vibration

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.000 

that<00:01:12.460> is<00:01:12.730> cool

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.010 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.170 

just<00:01:16.640> the<00:01:16.760> way<00:01:16.880> it<00:01:17.000> works<00:01:17.210> I<00:01:18.340> can<00:01:19.340> hear<00:01:19.550> it<00:01:19.700> it

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
just the way it works I can hear it it

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:28.360 
just the way it works I can hear it it
starts<00:01:20.600> out<00:01:20.720> a<00:01:20.780> real<00:01:21.080> real<00:01:22.010> low<00:01:22.220> frequency

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:28.370 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.540 

and<00:01:28.940> it<00:01:29.450> goes<00:01:29.630> up<00:01:29.660> in<00:01:29.990> frequency<00:01:30.680> it<00:01:31.220> feels

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:31.550 
and it goes up in frequency it feels

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.030 
and it goes up in frequency it feels
like<00:01:31.760> they're<00:01:32.000> running<00:01:32.180> like<00:01:32.630> like<00:01:33.590> four

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
like they're running like like four

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.090 
like they're running like like four
Hertz<00:01:34.400> up<00:01:34.820> to<00:01:35.150> about<00:01:35.420> 25<00:01:36.230> Hertz<00:01:36.560> is<00:01:36.800> what<00:01:37.010> it

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
Hertz up to about 25 Hertz is what it

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.260 
Hertz up to about 25 Hertz is what it
feels<00:01:37.130> like<00:01:38.200> don't<00:01:39.200> mess<00:01:39.410> with<00:01:39.560> the<00:01:39.650> camera

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
feels like don't mess with the camera

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:48.610 
feels like don't mess with the camera
yeah<00:01:41.800> safely<00:01:42.800> start

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:48.620 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.650 

and<00:01:49.160> then<00:01:49.340> that's<00:01:49.580> it<00:01:49.730> and<00:01:50.030> then<00:01:50.330> they<00:01:50.480> go

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:50.660 
and then that's it and then they go

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:59.080 
and then that's it and then they go
another<00:01:50.960> 10<00:01:51.200> feet<00:01:52.930> another<00:01:53.930> stop<00:01:58.090> everything

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
another 10 feet another stop everything

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.350 
another 10 feet another stop everything
they're<00:02:00.280> synchronized<00:02:01.280> to<00:02:01.790> all<00:02:02.060> three<00:02:02.300> of

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
they're synchronized to all three of

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.290 
they're synchronized to all three of
them<00:02:02.510> doing<00:02:02.630> it<00:02:02.750> exactly<00:02:02.900> the<00:02:03.320> same<00:02:03.410> time

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.300 
them doing it exactly the same time

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.640 
them doing it exactly the same time
watch<00:02:05.300> watch<00:02:05.750> out<00:02:05.930> all<00:02:06.080> three<00:02:06.320> of<00:02:06.350> them<00:02:06.500> do

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
watch watch out all three of them do

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.850 
watch watch out all three of them do
yeah<00:02:07.190> so<00:02:07.430> you<00:02:07.490> can<00:02:07.700> feel<00:02:07.940> it<00:02:08.320> do<00:02:09.320> they<00:02:09.440> all<00:02:09.619> go

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
yeah so you can feel it do they all go

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.530 
yeah so you can feel it do they all go
watch<00:02:10.700> they<00:02:10.940> all<00:02:11.090> go<00:02:11.350> and<00:02:12.350> they<00:02:12.530> asking<00:02:12.920> a<00:02:13.040> land

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
watch they all go and they asking a land

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.390 
watch they all go and they asking a land
no<00:02:15.200> they<00:02:15.439> it's<00:02:16.159> they're<00:02:16.730> just<00:02:16.969> doing<00:02:17.180> it

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
no they it's they're just doing it

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.319 
no they it's they're just doing it
somebody<00:02:19.400> contracted<00:02:20.180> the<00:02:20.989> borough<00:02:21.200> or

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:22.329
