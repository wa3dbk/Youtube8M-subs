00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.330 
the main basic brought me to the battle
bunker<00:00:42.570> so<00:00:42.899> i<00:00:42.930> have<00:00:43.170> no<00:00:43.320> idea<00:00:43.500> what<00:00:43.800> that<00:00:43.829> what

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
bunker so i have no idea what that what

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.549 
bunker so i have no idea what that what
that<00:00:44.370> supposed<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:44.879> mean<00:00:45.170> they're<00:00:46.170> hating<00:00:46.500> on

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
that supposed to mean they're hating on

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.400 
that supposed to mean they're hating on
me<00:00:46.770> they're<00:00:47.070> hating<00:00:47.309> on<00:00:47.340> my<00:00:47.489> military<00:00:48.230> and<00:00:49.230> it

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
me they're hating on my military and it

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.600 
me they're hating on my military and it
looks<00:00:49.530> like<00:00:49.739> they're<00:00:49.920> actually<00:00:50.219> bringing<00:00:50.370> up

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
looks like they're actually bringing up

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.760 
looks like they're actually bringing up
so<00:00:50.789> in<00:00:50.879> their<00:00:50.969> own<00:00:51.120> apocalypse<00:00:51.660> tanks<00:00:52.020> as<00:00:52.110> well

so in their own apocalypse tanks as well

00:00:53.770 --> 00:01:02.150 
so in their own apocalypse tanks as well
they're<00:00:54.770> like<00:00:54.950> what<00:00:55.520> I'm<00:00:55.640> thinking<00:00:56.030> I<00:00:56.120> guess

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:09.120 

let's<00:01:03.160> see<00:01:03.429> it<00:01:04.299> pops<00:01:04.780> out<00:01:04.930> yes<00:01:05.259> it's<00:01:05.500> good<00:01:08.130> we

want to group them up back there to get

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:13.920 
want to group them up back there to get
a<00:01:12.549> couple<00:01:12.729> of<00:01:12.820> Terror<00:01:13.030> drops<00:01:13.090> coming<00:01:13.540> through
