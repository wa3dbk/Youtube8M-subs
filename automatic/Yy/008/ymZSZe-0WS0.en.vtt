take this tip the top tip and fold it

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.630 
take this tip the top tip and fold it
downwards<00:01:40.799> you<00:01:42.500> should<00:01:43.500> end<00:01:43.740> up<00:01:43.860> with<00:01:43.920> what

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
downwards you should end up with what

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.410 
downwards you should end up with what
looks<00:01:44.670> like<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:45.210> parallelogram<00:01:47.180> once<00:01:48.180> you<00:01:48.299> end

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
looks like a parallelogram once you end

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.080 
looks like a parallelogram once you end
up<00:01:48.570> with<00:01:48.750> this<00:01:49.310> you<00:01:50.310> have<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.549> open<00:01:50.820> it<00:01:50.880> all<00:01:51.060> the

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
up with this you have to open it all the

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.030 
up with this you have to open it all the
way<00:01:51.329> back<00:01:51.570> up<00:01:51.810> like<00:01:52.350> this<00:01:54.049> then<00:01:55.049> there'll<00:01:55.259> be<00:01:55.320> a

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
way back up like this then there'll be a

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.459 
way back up like this then there'll be a
small<00:01:56.520> triangular<00:01:57.119> protrusions<00:01:57.750> right<00:01:57.990> here

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
small triangular protrusions right here

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.330 
small triangular protrusions right here
the<00:01:59.340> edge<00:01:59.490> and<00:01:59.820> right<00:02:00.240> here<00:02:00.860> simply<00:02:01.860> take<00:02:02.100> that

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
the edge and right here simply take that

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.139 
the edge and right here simply take that
and<00:02:02.579> fold<00:02:02.969> it<00:02:03.119> underneath<00:02:04.579> the<00:02:05.579> flap<00:02:05.850> right

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
and fold it underneath the flap right

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.580 
and fold it underneath the flap right
here<00:02:06.619> next<00:02:07.619> take<00:02:08.489> this<00:02:08.729> tip

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
here next take this tip

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.509 
here next take this tip
and<00:02:09.679> fold<00:02:10.429> it<00:02:10.640> into<00:02:10.849> that<00:02:11.390> flood<00:02:11.750> and<00:02:12.519> then

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:13.519 
and fold it into that flood and then

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:16.089 
and fold it into that flood and then
close<00:02:13.879> it<00:02:14.090> over<00:02:14.410> do<00:02:15.410> the<00:02:15.470> same<00:02:15.739> on<00:02:15.890> this<00:02:16.040> side

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:16.099 
close it over do the same on this side

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:21.040 
close it over do the same on this side
take<00:02:16.489> the<00:02:16.550> small<00:02:16.910> tip<00:02:17.440> fold<00:02:18.440> it<00:02:18.650> inwards<00:02:20.050> and

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
take the small tip fold it inwards and

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.729 
take the small tip fold it inwards and
open<00:02:21.950> this<00:02:22.099> up<00:02:22.280> a<00:02:22.430> bit<00:02:22.580> so<00:02:22.819> you<00:02:23.330> can<00:02:23.480> take<00:02:24.470> this

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
open this up a bit so you can take this

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:26.860 
open this up a bit so you can take this
flap<00:02:25.069> and<00:02:25.640> then<00:02:25.819> just<00:02:26.000> push<00:02:26.269> it<00:02:26.420> all<00:02:26.629> the<00:02:26.660> way

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
flap and then just push it all the way

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.869 
flap and then just push it all the way
in<00:02:27.019> there<00:02:27.260> make<00:02:27.920> sure<00:02:27.950> this<00:02:28.250> goes<00:02:28.459> on<00:02:28.670> nicely

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:28.879 
in there make sure this goes on nicely

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:30.640 
in there make sure this goes on nicely
otherwise<00:02:29.299> your<00:02:29.510> cues<00:02:29.930> want<00:02:30.230> to<00:02:30.290> interlock

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
otherwise your cues want to interlock

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.500 
otherwise your cues want to interlock
properly<00:02:31.160> so<00:02:31.340> just<00:02:31.519> push<00:02:31.790> that<00:02:32.030> in<00:02:32.209> really

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
properly so just push that in really

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.390 
properly so just push that in really
nicely<00:02:32.720> and<00:02:33.220> then<00:02:34.420> she'd<00:02:35.420> end<00:02:35.569> up<00:02:35.690> with<00:02:35.900> this

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
nicely and then she'd end up with this

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.580 
nicely and then she'd end up with this
parallelogram<00:02:37.400> with<00:02:37.580> the<00:02:37.670> X<00:02:37.849> in<00:02:38.120> the<00:02:38.180> center

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
parallelogram with the X in the center

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.470 
parallelogram with the X in the center
so<00:02:39.590> turn<00:02:39.799> it<00:02:39.920> away<00:02:40.040> from<00:02:40.430> the<00:02:40.549> X<00:02:40.730> so<00:02:41.269> that<00:02:41.420> you

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
so turn it away from the X so that you

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.750 
so turn it away from the X so that you
have<00:02:41.599> the<00:02:41.720> smooth<00:02:42.019> edge<00:02:42.230> and<00:02:43.010> take<00:02:43.250> this<00:02:43.489> tip

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
have the smooth edge and take this tip

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.009 
have the smooth edge and take this tip
and<00:02:44.410> fold<00:02:45.410> this<00:02:45.620> towards<00:02:46.459> the<00:02:46.549> center<00:02:47.030> just

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:48.019 
and fold this towards the center just

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:51.610 
and fold this towards the center just
like<00:02:48.140> that<00:02:48.610> then<00:02:49.610> take<00:02:49.640> this<00:02:50.090> tip<00:02:50.390> and<00:02:50.660> fold<00:02:51.380> it

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
like that then take this tip and fold it

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.240 
like that then take this tip and fold it
towards<00:02:51.980> the<00:02:52.040> center<00:02:52.400> again<00:02:52.519> and<00:02:53.890> then<00:02:54.890> simply

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
towards the center again and then simply

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.580 
towards the center again and then simply
let<00:02:55.430> go<00:02:56.230> now

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
let go now

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.880 
let go now
to<00:02:58.400> create<00:02:58.640> one<00:02:59.060> cube<00:02:59.540> you're<00:03:00.440> going<00:03:00.650> to<00:03:00.739> need

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
to create one cube you're going to need

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.839 
to create one cube you're going to need
six<00:03:01.220> pieces<00:03:01.430> of<00:03:01.730> this<00:03:02.890> so<00:03:03.890> I've<00:03:04.250> created<00:03:04.430> six

00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:04.849 
six pieces of this so I've created six

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:06.059 
six pieces of this so I've created six
pieces<00:03:05.090> right<00:03:05.360> here

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:06.069 
pieces right here

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:09.069 
pieces right here
once<00:03:07.069> you<00:03:07.190> have<00:03:07.340> six<00:03:07.640> pieces<00:03:07.930> you're<00:03:08.930> gonna

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:09.079 
once you have six pieces you're gonna

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:11.650 
once you have six pieces you're gonna
take<00:03:09.260> two<00:03:09.500> of<00:03:09.530> the<00:03:09.650> pieces<00:03:10.360> you're<00:03:11.360> gonna<00:03:11.450> want

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
take two of the pieces you're gonna want

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.379 
take two of the pieces you're gonna want
to<00:03:11.690> hold<00:03:11.900> one<00:03:12.049> like<00:03:12.829> this<00:03:13.129> so<00:03:13.850> that<00:03:13.880> the<00:03:14.030> tips

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:14.389 
to hold one like this so that the tips

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:17.229 
to hold one like this so that the tips
are<00:03:14.660> facing<00:03:15.139> up<00:03:15.260> and<00:03:15.470> down<00:03:15.620> and<00:03:15.950> hold<00:03:16.790> one<00:03:17.000> so

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
are facing up and down and hold one so

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.530 
are facing up and down and hold one so
that<00:03:17.420> the<00:03:17.630> tips<00:03:17.870> are<00:03:18.049> going<00:03:18.170> sideways<00:03:19.540> take

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
that the tips are going sideways take

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.210 
that the tips are going sideways take
this<00:03:20.780> tip<00:03:21.079> though<00:03:21.470> for<00:03:21.709> the<00:03:21.769> one<00:03:21.889> that's<00:03:22.010> going

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
this tip though for the one that's going

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.000 
this tip though for the one that's going
sideways<00:03:22.579> take<00:03:23.480> one<00:03:23.720> of<00:03:23.810> them<00:03:23.959> and<00:03:24.680> put<00:03:24.709> it

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
sideways take one of them and put it

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.259 
sideways take one of them and put it
into<00:03:25.400> this<00:03:25.519> slot<00:03:25.819> right<00:03:25.880> here<00:03:27.579> next<00:03:28.579> take

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
into this slot right here next take

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:32.680 
into this slot right here next take
another<00:03:29.569> piece<00:03:29.900> and<00:03:31.090> hold<00:03:32.090> the<00:03:32.209> tip<00:03:32.389> so<00:03:32.540> that

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
another piece and hold the tip so that

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.410 
another piece and hold the tip so that
it's<00:03:32.810> going<00:03:32.900> sideways<00:03:33.260> again<00:03:33.620> and<00:03:34.420> then

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
it's going sideways again and then

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.400 
it's going sideways again and then
simply<00:03:35.810> slide<00:03:35.989> it<00:03:36.290> into<00:03:36.829> this<00:03:38.169> middle<00:03:39.169> piece

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
simply slide it into this middle piece

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.400 
simply slide it into this middle piece
right<00:03:39.650> here<00:03:40.389> once<00:03:41.389> you<00:03:41.510> have<00:03:41.660> this<00:03:41.870> again<00:03:42.169> take

right here once you have this again take
another<00:03:42.530> piece<00:03:42.980> and<00:03:43.250> this<00:03:43.459> time<00:03:43.669> hold<00:03:43.910> it<00:03:44.120> so

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 
another piece and this time hold it so

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:46.240 
another piece and this time hold it so
that<00:03:44.389> the<00:03:44.540> tips<00:03:44.810> are<00:03:45.079> up-and-down<00:03:45.829> not

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
that the tips are up-and-down not

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:51.009 
that the tips are up-and-down not
sideways<00:03:46.900> so<00:03:47.900> once<00:03:48.109> you<00:03:48.200> have<00:03:48.349> that<00:03:49.750> push<00:03:50.750> this

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.019 
sideways so once you have that push this

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:56.530 
sideways so once you have that push this
end<00:03:51.230> in<00:03:52.450> just<00:03:53.450> like<00:03:53.720> that<00:03:54.819> then<00:03:55.819> take<00:03:55.849> this<00:03:56.269> tip

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
end in just like that then take this tip

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.720 
end in just like that then take this tip
and<00:03:56.780> push<00:03:57.260> that<00:03:57.470> in<00:04:00.130> so<00:04:01.130> now<00:04:01.250> you've<00:04:01.430> got<00:04:01.459> the

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
and push that in so now you've got the

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.159 
and push that in so now you've got the
sides<00:04:02.000> of<00:04:02.180> the<00:04:02.299> square<00:04:02.450> and<00:04:02.780> now<00:04:02.870> you<00:04:02.930> have<00:04:03.049> to

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:03.169 
sides of the square and now you have to

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:05.009 
sides of the square and now you have to
do<00:04:03.319> the<00:04:03.470> top<00:04:03.680> and<00:04:03.709> bottom<00:04:04.099> so<00:04:04.250> now<00:04:04.280> you<00:04:04.430> take<00:04:04.730> it

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
do the top and bottom so now you take it

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:08.979 
do the top and bottom so now you take it
open<00:04:06.019> these<00:04:06.169> flaps<00:04:06.500> up<00:04:07.450> so<00:04:08.450> that<00:04:08.569> you<00:04:08.660> can<00:04:08.780> put

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989 
open these flaps up so that you can put

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:13.180 
open these flaps up so that you can put
the<00:04:09.290> piece<00:04:09.889> right<00:04:10.069> here<00:04:10.130> and<00:04:11.859> make<00:04:12.859> sure<00:04:12.889> these

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
the piece right here and make sure these

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.629 
the piece right here and make sure these
flaps<00:04:13.549> are<00:04:13.880> going<00:04:14.120> sideways<00:04:14.419> like<00:04:14.810> this<00:04:15.639> so

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:16.639 
flaps are going sideways like this so

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:19.839 
flaps are going sideways like this so
that<00:04:16.789> you<00:04:16.880> have<00:04:17.120> a<00:04:17.419> flap<00:04:18.049> on<00:04:18.229> each<00:04:18.440> end<00:04:18.849> and

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:19.849 
that you have a flap on each end and

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:23.170 
that you have a flap on each end and
then<00:04:20.000> slide<00:04:20.299> this<00:04:20.510> flap<00:04:21.760> into

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
then slide this flap into

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.710 
then slide this flap into
I'm<00:04:23.509> going<00:04:23.750> to<00:04:23.870> do<00:04:23.990> it<00:04:24.110> actually<00:04:24.280> this<00:04:25.280> way<00:04:25.720> so

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
I'm going to do it actually this way so

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:31.150 
I'm going to do it actually this way so
make<00:04:27.050> sure<00:04:27.080> the<00:04:27.380> X<00:04:27.710> is<00:04:27.919> on<00:04:28.040> top<00:04:29.050> so<00:04:30.050> slide<00:04:30.979> this

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.160 
make sure the X is on top so slide this

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:37.270

and stick the other end into this and

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:27.010 
and stick the other end into this and
this<00:05:23.389> should<00:05:23.449> create<00:05:24.020> your<00:05:24.349> cube<00:05:25.720> now<00:05:26.720> once

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:27.020 
this should create your cube now once

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.740 
this should create your cube now once
you've<00:05:27.169> made<00:05:27.349> your<00:05:27.409> cube<00:05:28.449> you're<00:05:29.449> going<00:05:29.659> to

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:29.750 
you've made your cube you're going to

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:32.170 
you've made your cube you're going to
make<00:05:29.930> I<00:05:30.259> have<00:05:30.979> to<00:05:31.099> make<00:05:31.250> a<00:05:31.280> total<00:05:31.699> of<00:05:31.939> nine

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:32.180 
make I have to make a total of nine

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:35.050 
make I have to make a total of nine
cubes<00:05:32.569> for<00:05:32.840> this<00:05:32.990> design<00:05:33.729> so<00:05:34.729> you<00:05:34.789> can<00:05:34.849> see

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:35.060 
cubes for this design so you can see

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:36.670 
cubes for this design so you can see
you've<00:05:35.210> got<00:05:35.360> three<00:05:35.659> three<00:05:36.050> and<00:05:36.169> three<00:05:36.349> some

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:36.680 
you've got three three and three some

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:41.909 
you've got three three and three some
nine<00:05:37.900> so<00:05:38.900> once<00:05:39.409> you<00:05:39.530> have<00:05:39.740> your<00:05:40.340> nine<00:05:40.550> cubes

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:41.919 
nine so once you have your nine cubes

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:45.100 
nine so once you have your nine cubes
take<00:05:42.919> the<00:05:43.069> first<00:05:43.340> one<00:05:43.580> open<00:05:44.569> up<00:05:44.689> one<00:05:44.900> of<00:05:44.930> the

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:45.110 
take the first one open up one of the

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:49.240 
take the first one open up one of the
flaps<00:05:45.379> like<00:05:45.710> this<00:05:47.139> right<00:05:48.139> and<00:05:48.500> this<00:05:48.919> is<00:05:49.069> going

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.250 
flaps like this right and this is going

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:53.110 
flaps like this right and this is going
to<00:05:49.340> go<00:05:50.330> into<00:05:50.960> this<00:05:51.139> one<00:05:51.349> right<00:05:51.530> there<00:05:52.120> then

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.120 
to go into this one right there then

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.240 
to go into this one right there then
take<00:05:53.330> your<00:05:53.479> second<00:05:53.900> piece<00:05:54.080> and<00:05:54.379> open<00:05:54.919> up<00:05:55.039> the

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:55.250 
take your second piece and open up the

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:59.529 
take your second piece and open up the
flap<00:05:55.520> on<00:05:55.969> the<00:05:56.150> side<00:05:56.419> here<00:05:58.270> next<00:05:59.270> what<00:05:59.449> you're

00:05:59.529 --> 00:05:59.539 
flap on the side here next what you're

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:01.890 
flap on the side here next what you're
going<00:05:59.719> to<00:05:59.780> do<00:05:59.960> is<00:06:00.080> take<00:06:00.409> this<00:06:00.590> first<00:06:00.889> flap<00:06:01.190> and

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:01.900 
going to do is take this first flap and

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.749 
going to do is take this first flap and
insert<00:06:02.900> it<00:06:03.080> into<00:06:03.319> this<00:06:03.680> little<00:06:04.039> pocket<00:06:04.729> right

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:19.520 
you do this correctly you don't have to

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.390 
you do this correctly you don't have to
use<00:06:19.699> any<00:06:19.909> tape<00:06:20.330> or<00:06:20.659> glue<00:06:21.009> but<00:06:22.009> if<00:06:22.099> you<00:06:22.189> really

use any tape or glue but if you really

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.659 
use any tape or glue but if you really
want<00:06:22.610> to<00:06:22.789> you<00:06:22.909> can<00:06:22.969> it's<00:06:23.900> not<00:06:24.110> necessary<00:06:24.669> so

00:06:25.659 --> 00:06:25.669 
want to you can it's not necessary so

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:28.869 
want to you can it's not necessary so
once<00:06:25.819> you<00:06:25.940> do<00:06:26.120> that<00:06:27.310> what<00:06:28.310> you<00:06:28.400> want<00:06:28.520> to<00:06:28.610> do<00:06:28.699> is

00:06:28.869 --> 00:06:28.879 
once you do that what you want to do is

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:31.330 
once you do that what you want to do is
you<00:06:29.060> want<00:06:29.240> to<00:06:29.300> align<00:06:30.110> it<00:06:30.319> align<00:06:31.069> all<00:06:31.310> the

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:31.340 
you want to align it align all the

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:33.010 
you want to align it align all the
pieces<00:06:31.669> so<00:06:31.969> that<00:06:32.000> you<00:06:32.210> have<00:06:32.419> one<00:06:32.750> at<00:06:32.900> the

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:33.020 
pieces so that you have one at the

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:37.480 
pieces so that you have one at the
bottom<00:06:33.400> then<00:06:34.400> two<00:06:34.699> then<00:06:35.690> three<00:06:36.050> then<00:06:36.409> two<00:06:37.250> and

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:37.490 
bottom then two then three then two and

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:40.350 
bottom then two then three then two and
then<00:06:37.550> one<00:06:37.639> again<00:06:38.089> and<00:06:38.560> once<00:06:39.560> you<00:06:39.680> have<00:06:39.860> that

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:40.360 
then one again and once you have that

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:43.719 
then one again and once you have that
all<00:06:41.360> attached<00:06:42.319> you<00:06:42.560> should<00:06:42.740> be<00:06:42.860> able<00:06:42.979> to<00:06:43.310> do

00:06:43.719 --> 00:06:43.729 
all attached you should be able to do

00:06:43.729 --> 00:06:47.950 
all attached you should be able to do
this<00:06:45.279> once<00:06:46.279> you<00:06:46.400> do<00:06:46.520> that<00:06:46.599> simply<00:06:47.599> create<00:06:47.930> a

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:47.960 
this once you do that simply create a

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:51.820 
this once you do that simply create a
design<00:06:48.409> on<00:06:48.680> your<00:06:49.930> cube<00:06:50.930> doesn't<00:06:51.379> matter<00:06:51.620> what

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:51.830 
design on your cube doesn't matter what

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:55.089 
design on your cube doesn't matter what
is<00:06:52.310> it<00:06:52.879> can<00:06:53.180> be<00:06:53.270> whatever<00:06:53.419> you<00:06:53.629> want<00:06:53.690> and<00:06:54.500> if

00:06:55.089 --> 00:06:55.099 
is it can be whatever you want and if

00:06:55.099 --> 00:06:57.640 
is it can be whatever you want and if
you<00:06:55.190> want<00:06:55.370> you<00:06:55.490> can<00:06:55.580> turn<00:06:55.789> it<00:06:55.909> around<00:06:55.969> and<00:06:56.650> when

00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:57.650 
you want you can turn it around and when

00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:58.959 
you want you can turn it around and when
it<00:06:57.770> goes<00:06:57.919> the<00:06:58.099> other<00:06:58.279> way<00:06:58.460> you<00:06:58.520> can<00:06:58.639> create

00:06:58.959 --> 00:06:58.969 
it goes the other way you can create

00:06:58.969 --> 00:07:01.180 
it goes the other way you can create
another<00:06:59.210> design<00:06:59.569> so<00:06:59.750> that<00:07:00.099> doesn't<00:07:01.099> matter

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:01.190 
another design so that doesn't matter

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:02.709 
another design so that doesn't matter
which<00:07:01.400> way<00:07:01.580> you<00:07:01.669> go<00:07:01.849> you<00:07:01.909> have<00:07:02.210> a<00:07:02.240> design<00:07:02.569> on

00:07:02.709 --> 00:07:02.719 
which way you go you have a design on

00:07:02.719 --> 00:07:05.019 
which way you go you have a design on
each<00:07:02.750> end<00:07:03.110> and<00:07:04.039> once<00:07:04.219> you<00:07:04.339> do<00:07:04.490> that<00:07:04.520> you<00:07:04.849> should

00:07:05.019 --> 00:07:05.029 
each end and once you do that you should

00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:09.459 
each end and once you do that you should
have<00:07:05.240> a<00:07:05.509> finished<00:07:06.440> amazing<00:07:07.990> origami<00:07:08.990> moving

00:07:09.459 --> 00:07:09.469 
have a finished amazing origami moving

00:07:09.469 --> 00:07:13.719 
have a finished amazing origami moving
cube<00:07:10.569> and<00:07:11.569> that's<00:07:12.050> up<00:07:12.199> to<00:07:12.319> that<00:07:12.469> so<00:07:13.039> thanks<00:07:13.639> for

00:07:13.719 --> 00:07:13.729 
cube and that's up to that so thanks for
