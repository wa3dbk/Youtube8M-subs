EQ<00:00:02.310> settings<00:00:06.470> in<00:00:07.470> my<00:00:07.680> opinion<00:00:08.130> EQ<00:00:08.610> is<00:00:08.760> the<00:00:08.880> most

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
EQ settings in my opinion EQ is the most

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.669 
EQ settings in my opinion EQ is the most
important<00:00:09.690> thing<00:00:09.990> that<00:00:10.260> you<00:00:10.469> need<00:00:10.650> to

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
important thing that you need to

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.490

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
this part is going to be very subjective

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.120 
this part is going to be very subjective
it's<00:00:15.509> my<00:00:15.780> opinion<00:00:16.049> and<00:00:16.440> I'm<00:00:16.590> just<00:00:16.770> going<00:00:16.949> to

sound<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.490> way<00:00:20.640> that<00:00:21.270> I<00:00:21.300> like<00:00:21.660> them<00:00:22.789> here<00:00:23.789> is

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
sound the way that I like them here is

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.060 
sound the way that I like them here is
going<00:00:24.269> to<00:00:24.330> be<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.869> sound<00:00:25.170> of<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.769> drums

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
going to be the sound of the drums

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:33.110 
going to be the sound of the drums
without<00:00:26.460> any<00:00:27.000> processing<00:00:27.630> no<00:00:28.500> EQ<00:00:28.980> at<00:00:29.250> all

[Music]

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.180 

now<00:01:01.449> if<00:01:01.690> like<00:01:01.930> me<00:01:02.170> you<00:01:02.379> have<00:01:02.559> ears<00:01:02.949> you

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 
now if like me you have ears you

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.070 
now if like me you have ears you
probably<00:01:03.879> didn't<00:01:04.180> think<00:01:04.210> that<00:01:04.479> that<00:01:04.629> sounded

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
probably didn't think that that sounded

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:05.730 
probably didn't think that that sounded
too<00:01:05.229> good

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
too good

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.690 
too good
what<00:01:06.549> EQ<00:01:06.970> does<00:01:07.150> is<00:01:07.390> it<00:01:07.510> actually<00:01:07.869> brings<00:01:08.170> out

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
what EQ does is it actually brings out

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.940 
what EQ does is it actually brings out
certain<00:01:09.700> frequencies<00:01:10.360> of<00:01:10.390> a<00:01:10.659> sound<00:01:10.960> that<00:01:11.890> you

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
certain frequencies of a sound that you

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.899 
certain frequencies of a sound that you
want<00:01:12.369> to<00:01:12.490> hear<00:01:12.790> and<00:01:13.030> also<00:01:13.299> you<00:01:13.509> can<00:01:13.930> lower

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
want to hear and also you can lower

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.010 
want to hear and also you can lower
frequencies<00:01:15.909> of<00:01:16.060> sounds<00:01:16.479> that<00:01:16.720> you<00:01:16.840> don't

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
frequencies of sounds that you don't

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.180 
frequencies of sounds that you don't
want<00:01:17.200> to<00:01:17.259> hear<00:01:17.470> okay

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.190 
want to hear okay

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.410 
want to hear okay
do<00:01:18.790> you<00:01:18.880> an<00:01:18.970> example<00:01:19.300> right<00:01:19.570> now<00:01:20.350> I'm<00:01:20.860> talking

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
do you an example right now I'm talking

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.510 
do you an example right now I'm talking
and<00:01:22.420> you<00:01:22.540> can<00:01:22.570> see<00:01:22.899> that<00:01:23.110> the<00:01:23.259> highs<00:01:23.500> in<00:01:24.009> the<00:01:24.040> EQ

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
and you can see that the highs in the EQ

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.310 
and you can see that the highs in the EQ
have<00:01:24.729> been<00:01:24.880> boosted<00:01:25.390> you<00:01:25.869> can<00:01:26.020> tell<00:01:26.200> the

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
have been boosted you can tell the

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.700 
have been boosted you can tell the
change<00:01:26.560> in<00:01:26.710> my<00:01:26.830> voice<00:01:27.780> now<00:01:28.780> I'm<00:01:29.050> talking<00:01:29.320> and

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
change in my voice now I'm talking and

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.090 
change in my voice now I'm talking and
the<00:01:30.640> lows<00:01:31.180> of<00:01:31.570> the<00:01:31.780> EQ<00:01:32.140> have<00:01:32.290> been<00:01:32.470> have<00:01:33.070> been

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
the lows of the EQ have been have been

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.430 
the lows of the EQ have been have been
boosted<00:01:34.060> and<00:01:34.270> you<00:01:34.660> can<00:01:34.810> tell<00:01:34.990> the<00:01:35.110> difference

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440 
boosted and you can tell the difference

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.260 
boosted and you can tell the difference
in<00:01:35.560> my<00:01:35.590> voice<00:01:35.890> it's<00:01:36.310> the<00:01:36.460> same<00:01:36.700> effect<00:01:37.060> with

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
in my voice it's the same effect with

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.440 
in my voice it's the same effect with
drums<00:01:37.600> like<00:01:38.410> with<00:01:38.649> toms<00:01:39.240> you're<00:01:40.240> going<00:01:40.390> to

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
drums like with toms you're going to

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.060 
drums like with toms you're going to
want<00:01:40.660> to<00:01:40.720> probably<00:01:41.050> roll<00:01:41.320> off<00:01:41.530> the<00:01:41.710> mids<00:01:41.950> a

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070 
want to probably roll off the mids a

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.990 
want to probably roll off the mids a
little<00:01:42.280> bit<00:01:42.399> because<00:01:42.550> that's<00:01:42.759> where<00:01:42.910> the

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
little bit because that's where the

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.109 
little bit because that's where the
cardboard<00:01:43.450> box<00:01:43.750> e<00:01:43.960> sound<00:01:44.259> comes<00:01:45.039> in<00:01:45.280> and<00:01:45.550> keep

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119 
cardboard box e sound comes in and keep

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:48.149 
cardboard box e sound comes in and keep
your<00:01:46.300> lows<00:01:46.570> and<00:01:46.840> highs<00:01:47.050> attacked<00:01:47.619> because<00:01:48.039> you

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:48.159 
your lows and highs attacked because you

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:50.370 
your lows and highs attacked because you
get<00:01:48.340> your<00:01:48.520> attack<00:01:48.789> and<00:01:49.420> your<00:01:49.600> tone<00:01:49.840> you<00:01:50.170> mix

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
get your attack and your tone you mix

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.230 
get your attack and your tone you mix
those<00:01:50.560> together<00:01:50.740> and<00:01:51.039> get<00:01:51.130> a<00:01:51.190> nice<00:01:51.429> clean<00:01:51.850> drum

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
those together and get a nice clean drum

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.779 
those together and get a nice clean drum
sound<00:01:52.600> whereas<00:01:53.409> the<00:01:53.830> the<00:01:53.860> mids<00:01:54.280> will<00:01:54.490> make<00:01:54.640> it

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:54.789 
sound whereas the the mids will make it

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:57.090 
sound whereas the the mids will make it
sound<00:01:55.030> a<00:01:55.179> lot<00:01:55.300> more<00:01:55.360> boxy<00:01:56.020> and<00:01:56.050> not<00:01:56.380> not<00:01:56.890> as

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
sound a lot more boxy and not not as

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:03.690 
sound a lot more boxy and not not as
tone<00:01:57.399> totally<00:01:58.679> on<00:01:59.940> a<00:02:00.940> standard<00:02:01.630> mixer<00:02:02.700> you

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
tone totally on a standard mixer you

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.520 
tone totally on a standard mixer you
were<00:02:03.819> just<00:02:04.000> looking<00:02:04.090> at<00:02:04.330> a<00:02:04.450> parametric<00:02:04.959> EQ<00:02:05.319> but

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
were just looking at a parametric EQ but

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.180 
were just looking at a parametric EQ but
on<00:02:05.619> a<00:02:05.649> standard<00:02:06.130> mixer<00:02:06.750> you're<00:02:07.750> going<00:02:07.869> to<00:02:07.929> have

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
on a standard mixer you're going to have

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.770 
on a standard mixer you're going to have
probably<00:02:09.190> some<00:02:09.399> knobs<00:02:09.610> associated<00:02:10.360> with<00:02:10.450> EQ

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
probably some knobs associated with EQ

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.300 
probably some knobs associated with EQ
this<00:02:11.020> one<00:02:11.170> has<00:02:11.380> three<00:02:11.680> some<00:02:12.010> of<00:02:12.040> them<00:02:12.190> have

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
this one has three some of them have

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.850 
this one has three some of them have
four<00:02:12.580> and<00:02:12.760> I've<00:02:12.880> seen<00:02:13.450> some<00:02:13.690> of<00:02:13.750> we<00:02:13.959> have<00:02:14.170> even

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
four and I've seen some of we have even

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.059 
four and I've seen some of we have even
more<00:02:15.040> than<00:02:15.340> that

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
more than that

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.910 
more than that
more<00:02:16.549> expensive<00:02:17.030> ones<00:02:17.379> but<00:02:18.379> this<00:02:18.560> is<00:02:18.680> just<00:02:18.769> a

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
more expensive ones but this is just a

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.550 
more expensive ones but this is just a
standard<00:02:19.129> mixer<00:02:19.640> and<00:02:19.879> here<00:02:20.659> your<00:02:20.840> lows<00:02:21.079> here

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
standard mixer and here your lows here

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.140 
standard mixer and here your lows here
your<00:02:21.799> meds<00:02:22.010> and<00:02:22.250> your<00:02:22.340> highs<00:02:22.519> and<00:02:22.819> obviously

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
your meds and your highs and obviously

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.289 
your meds and your highs and obviously
you<00:02:23.299> can<00:02:24.159> you<00:02:25.159> have<00:02:25.340> less<00:02:25.579> control<00:02:25.609> because

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:26.299 
you can you have less control because

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:30.369 
you can you have less control because
you<00:02:26.450> can't<00:02:26.689> set<00:02:27.170> the<00:02:27.409> points<00:02:28.900> where<00:02:29.900> you<00:02:30.140> want

00:02:30.369 --> 00:02:30.379 
you can't set the points where you want
