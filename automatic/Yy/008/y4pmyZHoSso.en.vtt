00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:09.540
I've done it!

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.480
I said it couldn't be done,
but I've done it. I've...

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.640
...found the greatest racing game

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:15.600
of all time.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.160
It says it, uh,

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.180
like, right, right there.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.120
On the game box.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.920
They wouldn't put it there if it weren't true.

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:23.380
Of course not.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.520
Balls, yeah, it's Moto Racer,

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.320
developed by France-based Delphine Software

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.460
and published by Electronic Arts

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.440
in 1997 for Windows PCs

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.000
and the Sony PlayStation.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.660
Though DSI was famous for all sorts of things,

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.780
the lead developer on Moto Racer was
actually none other than Paul Cuisset.

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.520
Yep. The same guy who developed
games like The Stealth Affair,

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.480
and most famously Flashback

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.700
and its sequel, Fade to Black.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:55.180
Not entirely sure how I ended up with
Australian limited edition box here in America,

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.100
but I did, and this is it.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.960
Not much different than the normal U.S. release,

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.600
except that it lacks the fold-out
front cover from the American one.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.980
Yeah, the non-limited edition has a less awesome box

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.540
than the regular edition. Go figure that out.

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.660
Oh, well, it's still a sweet box,

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:12.580
because it's big

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.500
and it has ink printed on it that I approve of.

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.340
It also brings back waves of nostalgia,

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.980
since the first time I saw this box was
in a CompUSA store in Greensboro, NC.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.920
The box was sitting proudly beside a PC

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.260
showing off the new 3dfx Voodoo graphics card,

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.480
and of course this game was
the one installed to show it off.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.160
This was one of the earlier games
to really push 3D acceleration

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.720
of the Glide, Matrox and Direct3D varieties.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.040
Inside the box, you get the game on a CD

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.900
that for some reason has an
Australian OFLC "G" rating on it,

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.860
even though the box has the ESRB
Kids-to-Adults rating from North America.

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.800
You also get the game manual,

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.760
which is surprisingly in-depth for
such a simple arcade racing game.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.400
It covers everything a PC game should,

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.100
from the basic game premise

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.580
to every game mode,

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.200
to how to tweak the graphics,
troubleshoot all sorts of drivers, and more.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.920
Probably a good thing, since the
game had a tendency to crap out

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.700
with all the new DirectX software and drivers it used.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.700
Start the game and you're greeted with
DSI's nice, classy opening animation.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.120
[warm strings]

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.080
Followed by a burst of mid-'90s in-your-face radicalness!

[up-tempo electric guitar music]

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.800
Once RaphaÃ«l Gesqua's awesome
soundtrack finishes melting your face,

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.680
you're then told to enter your name

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.240
in one of the single most awesome ways possible.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.100
Seriously, I've probably spent as
much time typing names into this

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.340
as I have spent playing the actual game.

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.880
Those letters... just look so cool!

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.260
After you finish realizing you're too easily entertained,

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.800
you can choose to play single or multiplayer modes,

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.540
all while the announcer dude speaks out your choices.

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.240
I love when games do this.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.780
It's such a nice mix of cheesiness and charm.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:02.900
ANNOUNCER:
Play solo.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.200

[soul beat]

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.160
LGR:
You've got three main game modes to pick from.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.380
Practice, which allows you to practice race,

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.840
against the clock or up to 23 opponents

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.640
for however many laps you want.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.000
Single Race, which is the same as Practice,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.180
except you play the default options only.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.560
And Championship, which takes you on
a set career path of tracks and bikes,

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.960
and lets you unlock new tracks
and game options along the way.

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.360
There are two road tracks and
two dirt tracks in the beginning,

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.640
though you'll unlock two more of
each by finishing the championship.

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.460
And you could also download a new track of each type

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.460
from DSI's website for free,

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.700
taking the track total up to ten.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.980
Then you've got eight bikes
for each type to choose from,

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.620
each with their own color scheme and stats
determining their strengths and weaknesses.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:00.400
Not sure why you'd choose one of
the crazy, unbalanced ones, though,

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.660
unless you just want to arbitrarily handicap yourself.

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.300
Choose your destiny and
finally you're on the starting line,

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.520
and it's time to race some motos.

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:10.900
ANNOUNCER:
Two...

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:12.620
One...

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:14.640
Go!

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:20.460
[motorbike engine revving]

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:23.280
LGR:
The controls are incredibly simple.

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.920
Gas, brake, steering and a key for popping wheelies.

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.680
As you might have gathered by now,
it's an arcade racer through and through.

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.080
Very much in the vein of games
like Daytona USA, and, uh,

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.020
perhaps more obviously Ridge Racer.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.960
It's fast, it's loud.

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.200
It's easy to get into.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.500
And it's a lot of fun in short bursts.

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.520
Beyond that, there's not a lot to it,

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.480
but that's perfectly fine by me.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.600
It's one of those racing games
where the only thing holding you back

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.660
from a better lap time is yourself,

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:52.640
since the driving model is so simple.

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.860
Memorize the crap out of those
tracks forwards and backwards,

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.140
avoid crashing into enemies and walls,

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:01.920
and as long as you've chosen the right
bike for the track, you're good to go.

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.500
Though there is a wee bit of strategy to use

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.840
during the races in the form of wheelies.

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:10.960
You can pop a wheelie for anywhere
from a split-second to several seconds,

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.200
during which you will have a nice boost in speed,

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.520
but will have very little control of your steering.

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.080
And if you hit anything while doing
a wheelie, it's an instant crash.

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:23.200
Knowing where and for how long you can
manage to pull off successful wheelies

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.640
is key to getting a good lap time
and leaving the pack in the dust.

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.680
Dirt track motocross racing is a bit different, though,

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.420
since you'll have far more slippery
and complex courses to handle,

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:35.420
as well as the ability to go airborne.

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.340
Whether you're driving on dirt, mud, sand,

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.060
or something else vaguely resembling poop,

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:43.300
the handling is more loose than street racing,

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.320
but it's just as easy to get used to.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.300
However, dirt tracks bring a significant increase

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.680
to the twists and turns you'll have to navigate,

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.280
as well as way more variation in track height.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.800
Each hill is a chance to get some air

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.060
and even perform some tricks and stunts.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.900
Though there is no reason to do so,
except that it looks cool.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.040
And even if you land while performing
a stunt, you still don't crash from it.

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:07.120
so you may as well just do
stunts all over the place.

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.240
You can still perform wheelies to speed up,

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.160
but there are far fewer opportunities to do so safely.

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.460
And you'll want to be careful
when wheelie-ing off a jump,

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:18.160
since there's a chance that you'll
go flying into the invisible walls

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:19.900
on the sides of the track and wipe out.

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:23.380
If you're playing in Championship
mode, you'll eventually win

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:26.640
and be rewarded with some
new tracks and race options.

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:28.860
The first option is Reverse Mode,

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:30.800
which is exactly as it sounds.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.760
Play the same tracks as last time,

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.460
except as the Backwards Man.

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.920
The Backwards Man,
you backwards as fast as you can.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:39.920
In fact, you'll have to play all the
same tracks again in Reverse Mode

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.360
to unlock the next thing:

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:42.480
Pocket Mode.

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.800
That's right, all the bikes have been hit with a shrink ray

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:45.880
and are now minibikes,

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:47.580
and although they have the same stats,

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:50.480
they're all a bit faster and
tougher to handle than previously.

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:53.120
Can't say I'm a big fan of these, but whatever.

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.440
It's like Re-Volt's Clockwork Carnage mode:

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:57.540
it's cool that it's there, but I can live without it.

00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:59.740
And that's pretty much it for Moto Racer.

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:03.140
Just keep playing over and over again
to see all the cool track designs

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:05.700
and maybe increase the
difficulty for more of a challenge.

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:07.740
Well, there are the multiplayer modes, too,

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:09.760
and really, it's the same
thing as all the other modes,

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:13.420
except that you can play with
up to seven other real-life people

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:14.940
instead of AI racers.

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:18.680
You need to have a modem or network
connection of some kind to play these,

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:20.480
unless you've got the PS1 port,

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:22.520
which featured split-screen racing.

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:24.340
I was always jealous of that.

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:27.700
Freakin' consoles being better
than the PC for no good reason.

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:31.900
But whatever. The PC version is
superior in every other way, and I loved it.

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:33.540
Frick, I still love this game,

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:35.400
if only because of how simple it is.

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:37.980
Start it up. Choose a bike. Go fast.

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:40.100
Do wheelies. Tune in, drop out.

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:44.040
Moto Racer is a fantastic
example of '90s arcade racing

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:47.360
and I'd still recommend it if you
like racers without a ton of bloat

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.320
and just a load of raw fun.

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:52.500
Is it the greatest racing game of all time?

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:53.680
Eh, no.

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:55.140
Don't be ridiculous.

00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:57.640
But it's definitely the best Moto Racer

00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:00.460
by Delphine Software in 1997,

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:02.240
and that's more than enough for me.
