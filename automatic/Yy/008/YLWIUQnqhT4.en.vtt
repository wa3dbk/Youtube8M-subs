00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:01.500 
good morning this is Dwayne and

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.379 
good morning this is Dwayne and
yesterday<00:00:02.010> we<00:00:02.250> looked<00:00:02.520> at<00:00:02.760> how<00:00:02.939> to<00:00:02.970> tell<00:00:03.270> the

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
yesterday we looked at how to tell the

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:05.300 
yesterday we looked at how to tell the
key<00:00:03.570> of<00:00:03.720> a<00:00:03.810> song<00:00:04.049> if<00:00:04.350> you<00:00:04.470> have<00:00:04.650> sharps<00:00:05.069> in<00:00:05.279> the

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
key of a song if you have sharps in the

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.579 
key of a song if you have sharps in the
key<00:00:05.400> signature<00:00:05.759> and<00:00:06.359> we<00:00:07.049> went<00:00:07.319> through<00:00:07.379> all

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
key signature and we went through all

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.129 
key signature and we went through all
the<00:00:08.040> seven<00:00:08.820> sharps<00:00:09.210> and<00:00:09.389> we<00:00:09.510> determined<00:00:10.050> that

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
the seven sharps and we determined that

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:11.660 
the seven sharps and we determined that
the<00:00:10.320> sharps<00:00:10.620> always<00:00:10.920> occur<00:00:11.250> in<00:00:11.370> the<00:00:11.460> same

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
the sharps always occur in the same

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.820 
the sharps always occur in the same
order<00:00:12.030> which<00:00:12.840> was<00:00:13.049> F<00:00:13.290> sharp<00:00:13.679> C<00:00:14.400> sharp<00:00:14.599> G<00:00:15.599> sharp

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:15.830 
order which was F sharp C sharp G sharp

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:21.040 
order which was F sharp C sharp G sharp

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.290 
d sharp a sharp a sharp and B sharp
well<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.199> flats<00:00:22.500> are<00:00:23.130> just<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.760> opposite<00:00:24.180> of

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
well the flats are just the opposite of

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.060 
well the flats are just the opposite of
that<00:00:24.359> in<00:00:24.689> other<00:00:24.779> words<00:00:24.930> if<00:00:25.109> you<00:00:25.230> could<00:00:25.350> say<00:00:25.590> FC

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
that in other words if you could say FC

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.000 
that in other words if you could say FC
g<00:00:26.310> dae<00:00:26.730> be<00:00:27.210> backwards<00:00:27.840> then<00:00:28.439> you'd<00:00:28.650> have<00:00:28.830> the

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
g dae be backwards then you'd have the

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.299 
g dae be backwards then you'd have the
order<00:00:29.340> of<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.519> flats<00:00:29.789> which<00:00:30.150> is<00:00:30.359> B<00:00:31.320> flat<00:00:32.009> E

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
order of the flats which is B flat E

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.610 
order of the flats which is B flat E

okay<00:00:38.719> you<00:00:39.719> can<00:00:39.899> remember<00:00:40.230> that<00:00:40.379> easily<00:00:40.739> just

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
okay you can remember that easily just

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.220 
okay you can remember that easily just
by<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.640> first<00:00:41.879> four<00:00:42.120> flats<00:00:42.360> or<00:00:42.600> spell<00:00:43.140> the

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
by the first four flats or spell the

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:49.850 
by the first four flats or spell the
word<00:00:43.350> beat<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.950> e<00:00:43.980> ad<00:00:46.399> and<00:00:47.399> then<00:00:48.379> F<00:00:49.379> go<00:00:49.649> catch

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
word beat the e ad and then F go catch

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.560 
word beat the e ad and then F go catch
fish<00:00:49.890> or<00:00:50.570> some<00:00:51.570> way<00:00:51.930> to<00:00:51.989> memorize<00:00:52.289> that<00:00:52.710> okay

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
fish or some way to memorize that okay

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.910 
fish or some way to memorize that okay
now<00:00:54.570> how<00:00:54.809> do<00:00:54.870> you<00:00:54.960> tell<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.320> key<00:00:55.530> when<00:00:55.800> you

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
now how do you tell the key when you

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.610 
now how do you tell the key when you
have<00:00:56.129> flats<00:00:56.789> well<00:00:57.149> if<00:00:57.719> there's<00:00:57.989> no<00:00:58.140> sharps<00:00:58.469> or

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
have flats well if there's no sharps or

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.869 
have flats well if there's no sharps or
flats<00:00:58.680> in<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.100> key<00:00:59.250> signature<00:00:59.309> way<00:00:59.820> to

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
flats in the key signature way to

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.639 
flats in the key signature way to
determine<00:01:00.420> that's<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.750> key<00:01:00.960> of<00:01:01.079> C<00:01:01.320> because

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
determine that's the key of C because

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.590 
determine that's the key of C because
we're<00:01:01.829> basing<00:01:02.250> our<00:01:02.370> playing<00:01:02.670> on<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.000> key<00:01:03.210> of<00:01:03.239> C

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
we're basing our playing on the key of C

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.100 
we're basing our playing on the key of C
and<00:01:03.960> so<00:01:04.710> if<00:01:05.549> we<00:01:05.700> use<00:01:05.729> if<00:01:06.119> we<00:01:06.180> find<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.689> song<00:01:06.900> that

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
and so if we use if we find a song that

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.560 
and so if we use if we find a song that
has<00:01:09.619> just<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.799> primary<00:01:11.070> chords<00:01:11.729> or<00:01:11.909> or<00:01:12.150> those

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
has just the primary chords or or those

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.450 
has just the primary chords or or those
are<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.869> most<00:01:13.439> used<00:01:13.740> chords<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.220> we<00:01:14.310> know

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
are the most used chords and we know

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.580 
are the most used chords and we know
it's<00:01:14.610> in<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.850> key<00:01:15.030> of<00:01:15.060> C<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.630> then<00:01:16.200> we<00:01:16.380> walk

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
it's in the key of C and then we walk

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.850 
it's in the key of C and then we walk
through<00:01:16.799> that<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.850> sharp<00:01:18.150> Keys<00:01:18.420> last

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
through that the sharp Keys last

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.539 
through that the sharp Keys last
yesterday<00:01:20.780> GED<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:21.960> so<00:01:22.140> on<00:01:22.259> now<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.159> flat

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
yesterday GED and so on now the flat

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.940 
yesterday GED and so on now the flat
keys<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.299> first<00:01:24.540> flat<00:01:24.810> key<00:01:25.049> is<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.409> key<00:01:25.590> of<00:01:25.619> F

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
keys the first flat key is the key of F

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.490 
keys the first flat key is the key of F
it's<00:01:26.700> based<00:01:26.939> on<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.299> scale<00:01:27.630> of<00:01:27.840> F<00:01:27.990> which<00:01:28.259> has

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
it's based on the scale of F which has

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.569 
it's based on the scale of F which has
one<00:01:28.890> flat<00:01:29.310> that<00:01:29.939> one<00:01:30.210> flat<00:01:30.509> is<00:01:30.750> B<00:01:31.110> flat<00:01:31.350> okay<00:01:32.040> so

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
find the key is to take the second to

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.320 
find the key is to take the second to
the<00:02:15.840> last<00:02:16.020> flat<00:02:16.440> and<00:02:16.709> that<00:02:16.920> is<00:02:17.100> the<00:02:17.340> key<00:02:17.520> in

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
the last flat and that is the key in

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.550 
the last flat and that is the key in
other<00:02:18.450> words<00:02:18.660> if<00:02:18.780> you<00:02:18.870> have<00:02:18.990> two<00:02:19.230> flats

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
other words if you have two flats

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.620 
other words if you have two flats
they're<00:02:19.860> always<00:02:20.040> going<00:02:20.310> to<00:02:20.340> be<00:02:20.400> B<00:02:20.760> flat<00:02:21.090> and<00:02:21.390> E

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
they're always going to be B flat and E

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.520 
they're always going to be B flat and E
flat<00:02:21.660> E<00:02:22.350> flat<00:02:22.890> is<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:23.400> last<00:02:23.730> flat<00:02:24.690> to<00:02:25.500> the

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
flat E flat is the last flat to the

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.020 
flat E flat is the last flat to the

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
right in the key signature so what's the

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.080 
right in the key signature so what's the
second<00:02:27.360> last<00:02:27.540> flat<00:02:28.580> so<00:02:29.580> that<00:02:29.610> means<00:02:29.910> you're<00:02:30.060> in

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
second last flat so that means you're in

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.230 
second last flat so that means you're in
the<00:02:30.150> key<00:02:30.390> of<00:02:30.420> B<00:02:30.540> flat<00:02:30.770> okay<00:02:31.770> so<00:02:32.400> the<00:02:32.550> scale<00:02:32.910> of<00:02:32.940> E

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
the key of B flat okay so the scale of E

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.240 
the key of B flat okay so the scale of E
flat<00:02:33.480> goes<00:02:33.810> like<00:02:34.050> that

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
flat goes like that

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.850 
flat goes like that
those<00:02:35.760> two<00:02:36.000> flats<00:02:36.330> B<00:02:36.630> flat<00:02:36.959> and<00:02:37.110> E<00:02:37.260> flat<00:02:37.290> in<00:02:37.740> it

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
those two flats B flat and E flat in it

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.500 
those two flats B flat and E flat in it
so<00:02:38.370> if<00:02:38.459> I'm<00:02:38.610> playing<00:02:38.880> in<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:39.060> key<00:02:39.240> of<00:02:39.270> B<00:02:39.390> flat

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
so if I'm playing in the key of B flat

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:53.320 
so if I'm playing in the key of B flat
I'm<00:02:40.470> basing<00:02:40.950> my<00:02:40.980> playing

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.970 

that's<00:02:54.330> all<00:02:54.540> the<00:02:54.750> key<00:02:54.930> of<00:02:55.050> b-flat<00:02:55.260> because

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
that's all the key of b-flat because

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.369 
that's all the key of b-flat because
it's<00:02:56.220> based<00:02:56.459> on<00:02:56.640> those<00:02:56.849> primary<00:02:57.209> chords<00:02:57.780> okay

00:02:58.369 --> 00:02:58.379 
it's based on those primary chords okay

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:02.449 
it's based on those primary chords okay
now<00:02:59.340> if<00:02:59.489> I<00:02:59.610> have<00:02:59.849> three<00:03:00.780> flats<00:03:01.110> they<00:03:02.099> would<00:03:02.310> be

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
now if I have three flats they would be

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:06.650 
now if I have three flats they would be
B<00:03:02.760> flat<00:03:03.090> E<00:03:03.450> flat<00:03:03.900> and<00:03:04.530> a<00:03:04.650> flat<00:03:04.680> and<00:03:05.610> our<00:03:06.239> formula

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
B flat E flat and a flat and our formula

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.900 
B flat E flat and a flat and our formula
to<00:03:07.170> find<00:03:07.379> the<00:03:07.590> key<00:03:07.980> when<00:03:08.220> we<00:03:08.340> have<00:03:08.430> flats<00:03:08.700> is

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
to find the key when we have flats is

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.880 
to find the key when we have flats is
what<00:03:09.120> you<00:03:10.049> take<00:03:10.260> the<00:03:10.410> second-to-the-last

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
what you take the second-to-the-last

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.930 
what you take the second-to-the-last
flat<00:03:11.489> so<00:03:12.390> the<00:03:12.569> last<00:03:12.780> flat<00:03:13.140> is<00:03:13.319> a<00:03:13.560> flat<00:03:13.790> so<00:03:14.790> the

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
flat so the last flat is a flat so the

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.699 
flat so the last flat is a flat so the
second<00:03:15.269> last<00:03:15.450> flat<00:03:15.569> is<00:03:15.810> a<00:03:15.989> flat<00:03:16.019> sore<00:03:16.530> in<00:03:16.680> the

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
second last flat is a flat sore in the

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.570 
second last flat is a flat sore in the
scale<00:03:17.099> of<00:03:17.370> E<00:03:17.760> flat<00:03:17.940> the<00:03:18.269> key<00:03:18.480> of<00:03:18.569> E<00:03:18.690> for<00:03:19.010> q1<00:03:20.010> goes

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
scale of E flat the key of E for q1 goes

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.430 
scale of E flat the key of E for q1 goes
like<00:03:20.849> that<00:03:20.879> let<00:03:21.750> me<00:03:21.810> push<00:03:22.080> down<00:03:22.290> all<00:03:22.440> the<00:03:22.849> noise

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
like that let me push down all the noise

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.110 
like that let me push down all the noise
that's<00:03:25.440> what<00:03:25.739> I<00:03:25.769> did<00:03:26.069> by<00:03:26.489> the<00:03:26.519> way<00:03:26.640> before<00:03:26.940> you

that<00:03:33.780> particular<00:03:34.170> key<00:03:34.620> so<00:03:35.370> that's<00:03:35.640> the<00:03:35.790> key<00:03:35.970> of

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
that particular key so that's the key of

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.710 
that particular key so that's the key of
E<00:03:36.269> flat<00:03:36.980> based<00:03:37.980> on<00:03:38.250> those<00:03:38.549> three<00:03:38.819> flats<00:03:39.269> okay

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
E flat based on those three flats okay

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.289 
E flat based on those three flats okay
now<00:03:40.500> if<00:03:40.560> you<00:03:40.709> have<00:03:40.829> four<00:03:41.129> flats<00:03:41.430> they<00:03:41.910> would<00:03:42.150> be

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
now if you have four flats they would be

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:45.650 
now if you have four flats they would be
beautiful<00:03:42.750> at<00:03:42.840> E<00:03:43.049> flat<00:03:43.440> a<00:03:43.769> flat<00:03:43.799> and<00:03:44.400> D<00:03:44.579> flat<00:03:44.660> so

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
beautiful at E flat a flat and D flat so

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.979 
beautiful at E flat a flat and D flat so
the<00:03:45.810> second<00:03:46.170> to<00:03:46.260> the<00:03:46.290> last<00:03:46.410> slide<00:03:46.890> is<00:03:47.099> one<00:03:47.310> a

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
the second to the last slide is one a

flat

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.869 
flat
so<00:03:49.349> you'd<00:03:49.500> be<00:03:49.650> in<00:03:49.739> the<00:03:49.829> key<00:03:50.040> of<00:03:50.069> E<00:03:50.489> flat<00:03:52.700> if<00:03:53.700> you

00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:53.879 
so you'd be in the key of E flat if you

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:57.290 
so you'd be in the key of E flat if you
have<00:03:54.000> fly<00:03:54.239> flats<00:03:54.629> they'd<00:03:54.900> be

in G flat so that would put you in the

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.900 
in G flat so that would put you in the
second-to-the-last<00:04:00.600> flat<00:04:01.230> which<00:04:01.710> is<00:04:01.890> what<00:04:02.160> D

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
second-to-the-last flat which is what D

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:11.570 
second-to-the-last flat which is what D
flat

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 
flat and C flat that note that looks

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.980 
flat and C flat that note that looks

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
looks like B is really C flat we can't

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.070 
looks like B is really C flat we can't
call<00:04:32.320> it<00:04:33.060> we<00:04:34.060> can't<00:04:34.330> call<00:04:34.510> it<00:04:34.660> B<00:04:34.840> because

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
call it we can't call it B because

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.480 
call it we can't call it B because
there's<00:04:35.350> already<00:04:35.530> a<00:04:35.680> B<00:04:35.950> in<00:04:36.100> that<00:04:36.130> scale

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
there's already a B in that scale

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.040 
there's already a B in that scale
there's<00:04:36.760> a<00:04:36.850> B<00:04:37.030> flat<00:04:37.210> on<00:04:37.420> that<00:04:37.540> scale<00:04:37.750> we<00:04:37.840> can't

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
there's a B flat on that scale we can't

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.500 
there's a B flat on that scale we can't
have<00:04:38.170> two<00:04:38.410> of<00:04:38.560> the<00:04:38.620> same<00:04:39.330> letters<00:04:40.330> of<00:04:40.450> the

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:41.950 
alphabet of the same scale so it's got

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:43.830 
alphabet of the same scale so it's got
to<00:04:42.040> be<00:04:42.100> called<00:04:42.280> C<00:04:42.550> flap<00:04:42.940> and<00:04:43.180> if<00:04:43.300> you<00:04:43.420> saw<00:04:43.630> it<00:04:43.750> in

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
to be called C flap and if you saw it in

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.800 
to be called C flap and if you saw it in
music<00:04:43.990> it<00:04:44.350> would<00:04:44.530> be<00:04:45.090> C<00:04:46.090> with<00:04:46.300> a<00:04:46.330> flat<00:04:46.630> in<00:04:46.660> front

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
music it would be C with a flat in front

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:48.810 
music it would be C with a flat in front
of<00:04:47.050> it<00:04:47.140> okay<00:04:47.560> so<00:04:48.280> the<00:04:48.430> second-to-the-last

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
of it okay so the second-to-the-last

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.240 
of it okay so the second-to-the-last
flat<00:04:49.390> then<00:04:49.720> if<00:04:49.990> C<00:04:50.350> flat<00:04:50.620> is<00:04:50.740> the<00:04:50.770> last<00:04:51.010> flat

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
flat then if C flat is the last flat

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.090 
flat then if C flat is the last flat
second<00:04:51.670> last<00:04:51.820> line<00:04:52.060> of<00:04:52.090> G<00:04:52.360> fourth<00:04:52.600> right

second last line of G fourth right

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:56.100 
second last line of G fourth right
knowing<00:04:54.100> our<00:04:54.220> order<00:04:54.490> of<00:04:54.550> the<00:04:54.610> flats<00:04:54.880> B<00:04:55.090> a<00:04:55.300> B<00:04:55.540> G<00:04:55.570> C

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
knowing our order of the flats B a B G C

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:04.770 
knowing our order of the flats B a B G C
and<00:04:56.470> so<00:04:57.190> if<00:04:57.460> you<00:04:57.610> have<00:04:57.730> seventh<00:04:58.270> lesson<00:05:03.420> so<00:05:04.420> if

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
and so if you have seventh lesson so if

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.320 
and so if you have seventh lesson so if
you<00:05:04.960> sign<00:05:05.830> up<00:05:05.860> the<00:05:06.040> last<00:05:06.220> flat<00:05:06.640> there<00:05:06.910> is<00:05:07.150> a

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:07.330 
you sign up the last flat there is a

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.150 
you sign up the last flat there is a
flat<00:05:07.750> so<00:05:07.930> you'd<00:05:08.050> be<00:05:08.170> in<00:05:08.260> the<00:05:08.350> key<00:05:08.530> of<00:05:08.560> C<00:05:08.890> flat

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160 
flat so you'd be in the key of C flat

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.360 
flat so you'd be in the key of C flat
which<00:05:09.790> is<00:05:09.970> a<00:05:10.000> key<00:05:10.240> that's<00:05:10.860> virtually<00:05:11.860> never

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
which is a key that's virtually never

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.850 
which is a key that's virtually never
used<00:05:12.760> but<00:05:13.030> hypothetically<00:05:13.960> you<00:05:14.470> should<00:05:14.680> know

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
used but hypothetically you should know

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.130 
used but hypothetically you should know
about<00:05:14.950> it<00:05:15.160> so<00:05:15.460> that's<00:05:16.120> how<00:05:16.330> you<00:05:16.420> find<00:05:16.780> the<00:05:16.930> key

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:17.140 
about it so that's how you find the key

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:19.560 
about it so that's how you find the key
when<00:05:17.860> you<00:05:17.950> have<00:05:18.070> flat<00:05:18.400> keys<00:05:18.700> I<00:05:18.940> mean<00:05:19.360> when<00:05:19.480> you

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:19.570 
when you have flat keys I mean when you

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:20.760 
when you have flat keys I mean when you
have<00:05:19.630> flats<00:05:19.900> on<00:05:20.080> the<00:05:20.140> key<00:05:20.320> symmetry<00:05:20.740> you

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:20.770 
have flats on the key symmetry you

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:24.570 
have flats on the key symmetry you
locate<00:05:21.310> the<00:05:21.490> second<00:05:21.880> flat<00:05:22.920> from<00:05:23.920> the<00:05:24.040> last<00:05:24.250> and

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.580 
locate the second flat from the last and

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.960 
locate the second flat from the last and
that<00:05:24.820> is<00:05:24.880> the<00:05:25.300> name<00:05:25.510> of<00:05:25.540> the<00:05:25.960> key<00:05:26.640> if<00:05:27.640> you<00:05:27.880> have

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:27.970 
that is the name of the key if you have

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:29.970 
that is the name of the key if you have
one<00:05:28.210> flat<00:05:28.420> remember<00:05:28.900> it's<00:05:29.050> just<00:05:29.110> a<00:05:29.350> key<00:05:29.560> of<00:05:29.710> F

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:29.980 
one flat remember it's just a key of F

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:31.950 
one flat remember it's just a key of F
you<00:05:30.220> memorize<00:05:30.640> that<00:05:30.910> and<00:05:31.450> if<00:05:31.600> you<00:05:31.690> have<00:05:31.780> no

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960 
you memorize that and if you have no

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.260 
you memorize that and if you have no
sharps<00:05:32.290> or<00:05:32.380> flats<00:05:32.640> then<00:05:33.640> of<00:05:33.790> course<00:05:34.060> you're<00:05:34.180> in

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:34.270 
sharps or flats then of course you're in

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:36.230 
sharps or flats then of course you're in
the<00:05:34.330> key<00:05:34.510> of<00:05:34.540> C<00:05:34.840> so<00:05:35.320> we've<00:05:35.590> been<00:05:35.800> through<00:05:36.010> the

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 
the key of C so we've been through the

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.820 
the key of C so we've been through the
