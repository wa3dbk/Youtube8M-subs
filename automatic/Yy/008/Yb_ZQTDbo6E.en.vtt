00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:14.070
 the people back to make one more 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.859
 video for you talking about flash to 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:20.580
 last week I said last month 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:24.330
 about 600 this drt from here is not today 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.920
 I'm going to tell you about Nikon sb 700 and 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.470
 despite being a classic, there is already 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.260
 a lot of time in the market there for you that 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:36.420
 still have no resources to invest in the 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:38.270
 usb 910 or s of 700 is a good option is a 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.350
 intermediate flash that already have enough 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.809
 options right there 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.059
 or also to a second light source 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:50.579
 is the following also can not invest 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:53.129
 in 2009 101 sb 910 and a sb 700 with a 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.949
 second light source so I will show 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.570
 his menus and an advantage that he has 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.190
 about the other flash 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.399
 today also received the call of a 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:05.309
 boy that he has usb 700 and was 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:08.010
 wanting to buy a sb 910 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.290
 but pass the information to him that 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.920
 it does not communicate with other flashes by 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:16.170
 example 900 or 900 cities are in the 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.810
 end of this myth of this video I go 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.210
 show if this really is true or 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.790
 do not watch until the end, I'll go 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.549
 show it there for you ok then let's go 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.200
 there to take a look at his menu at 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.670
 all functions 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:35.159
 good people counted on the flash here 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:39.479
 different from the others 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:41.790
 usb flash 700 does not have a template button 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.280
 he has this button on the side where 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.189
 You set the mood so it 's here. 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.140
 no tl 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:51.689
 Look there's a little button here. 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:55.049
 select where you will be doing 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.280
 and you have the 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:00.780
 the zoom 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:04.229
 you can set the 1 down 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:07.320
 you have a manual mode and it appeared there 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.959
 here looks the letter m where are you going 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:13.650
 adjust the intensity of your flash from one 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:18.269
 by an access to a sufficient and 28 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:21.360
 also adjust the zoom plus one here you 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:24.510
 enter the guide mode gene mode that the 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.970
 distance priority where you set the 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.700
 away your flash in the 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.310
 distance you will be only motive and 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:38.189
 it adjusts the intensity of the light and here 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:41.849
 also the zoom adjustment will put him 

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:45.420
 Remote mode or see the slave with dida 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:48.060
 as you prefer to say there you just turn the 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:51.000
 button here he already enters the already enters the 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:54.239
 remote mode and there it will respond to 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.389
 flash master commands and there you 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:03:02.010
 you can select the group 

00:02:57.389 --> 00:03:04.370
 the channel and here far more spinning 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:08.280
 time the button here it goes into mode 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:09.060
 master and from there he will command the others 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.170
 les 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:16.319
 you can also set the group here 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.400
 compensate or the channel has four 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:19.500
 channels 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.859
 now a cool thing different from the 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:25.590
 sbt 700 with the other press is that you 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:29.129
 can work proportion of two groups 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:31.919
 of group a with group b 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:36.239
 here you will see that I have a and b 

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:38.760
 so you pressing here looks in 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:42.989
 here you can adjust one by one 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:44.519
 be the same power where for example 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.769
 two for one 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:49.949
 the difference of one event and another of 2010 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:53.190
 from one to the other is cool and just usb 

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:55.799
 700 has pressed the button here 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:58.250
 - you will be in the 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:03.569
 your flash, right? 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:08.870
 the sony motorcycle lcd brightness filter 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:13.159
 all that has in the other usb flash 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:16.079
 700 and its functions no arrow 

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:19.440
 intermediate and a good option for you 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:23.310
 there you can not invest in a sb 910 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:25.830
 or as a second light option there is only 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.420
 things I'm going to show here now was that 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:31.920
 they asked me today 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:33.900
 everything i heard today nasdaq usb 700 is not 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.780
 communicates with other nikon flash 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:39.780
 for example sb 900 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.890
 So I'll show you that now that he's 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.990
 communicates 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:47.670
 yes, then I'll put it here in mode 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:48.930
 master and I'm with 910 here in mode 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:52.170
 remote 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:05:01.190
 So you're in group A on the channel. 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:05:01.190
 I'm going to separate the 700 will respond 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:15.450
 then he as master he commands 1 910 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:21.390
 how far I'm going to reverse now 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:23.130
 I'll put the 910 on the master button and the 

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:28.520
 700 on the remote 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:28.520
 now I'll wait 910 and the 700 responds 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:37.140
 700 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:39.720
 then this information that the sbt 700 

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:43.230
 does not communicate with other flashes 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:46.200
 is not true to an absurdity 

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:49.320
 So he's there as master command. 

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:51.980
 other flash and it as remote obeys 

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:54.840
 the other flashes 

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:58.080
 the staff is only then it was another video 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:00.300
 showing more flash and its functions 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:04.170
 the aim is to show and urn 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:07.320
 possible flashes of the farm with 901 902 

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:10.500
 British with some flashes of iom 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:12.420
 a faction flashes to new brands 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:15.060
 famous make a flash coming 

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:17.130
 conquering the market there and also has 

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:20.460
 your values are and communicates a lot 

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:23.870
 well and with the strong team brand flashes 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:23.870
 hug until the next life
