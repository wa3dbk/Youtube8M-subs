00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
the sound is actually really cool and

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.389 
the sound is actually really cool and
really<00:01:54.899> does<00:01:55.350> sound<00:01:55.740> like<00:01:55.950> one<00:01:56.159> of<00:01:56.280> these

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
really does sound like one of these

really does sound like one of these
things<00:01:56.670> which<00:01:56.850> is<00:01:56.969> nice<00:01:57.180> and<00:01:57.509> overall<00:01:58.259> pretty

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
things which is nice and overall pretty

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:59.719

neat<00:01:58.590> I<00:01:58.770> thought<00:01:58.979> that<00:01:59.159> it<00:01:59.250> would<00:01:59.340> be<00:01:59.460> kind<00:01:59.610> of

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
neat I thought that it would be kind of

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.429 
neat I thought that it would be kind of
distracting<00:01:59.850> having<00:02:00.540> this<00:02:00.630> big<00:02:00.840> like<00:02:01.049> pole<00:02:01.290> in

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
distracting having this big like pole in

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.560 
distracting having this big like pole in
the<00:02:01.560> back<00:02:01.590> not<00:02:02.250> too<00:02:02.430> bad<00:02:02.610> though<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:03.060> it's

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
the back not too bad though and it's

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.380 
the back not too bad though and it's
still<00:02:03.689> fine<00:02:04.170> and<00:02:04.670> overall<00:02:05.670> really<00:02:06.000> do<00:02:06.210> like

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
still fine and overall really do like

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.749 
still fine and overall really do like
