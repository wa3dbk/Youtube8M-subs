00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.554
 Do you want to be a good teammate with your "Kerry" teammate? 

00:00:04.554 --> 00:00:06.323
 Then Uncle Couille will teach you how to play 

00:00:06.323 --> 00:00:09.192
 Seret - playing wild double fear 

00:00:09.192 --> 00:00:11.161
 Have a good start at the beginning of the game 

00:00:11.161 --> 00:00:12.662
 You have two choices 

00:00:12.662 --> 00:00:18.435
 1. And a good friend of the anal anus, let one of his teammates suck up the experience of the second level 

00:00:18.435 --> 00:00:21.671
 Then steal the opposite red BUFF at full speed. 

00:00:21.671 --> 00:00:28.311
 Then I will treat the dog in the grass and take him to the grass for cooking. 

00:00:28.311 --> 00:00:35.519
 2. Separate from your good friend for a while and take BUFF together. 

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:41.525
 Then run around and stop anyone from escaping your claws 

00:00:41.525 --> 00:00:45.228
 But because there are two people playing the dog, they will often be pushed 

00:00:45.228 --> 00:00:49.766
 Put this into an advantage and have an ambush, don’t let them do anything. 

00:00:49.766 --> 00:00:52.869
 Don’t let them escape the defense tower and turn around to make tons of damage. 

00:00:52.869 --> 00:01:00.644
 The Seret duo can play with Cosplayr to play with the woman to a superb 5P 

00:01:00.644 --> 00:01:08.085
 Sometimes you can just send your fist to the grass and maybe grab a Chinese to scold it. 

00:01:08.085 --> 00:01:11.221
 Did the enemy find you and then escape at the speed of light? 

00:01:11.221 --> 00:01:16.493
 Don't worry about that tower, you can take him away and play until you are satisfied. 

00:01:16.493 --> 00:01:20.597
 The benefits of the Seret duo can’t be caught by a man. 

00:01:20.597 --> 00:01:24.000
 Your good friend can make up for your mental retardation error. 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.702
 Do you make up for it? 

00:01:25.702 --> 00:01:29.539
 Since you are running like a kid playing in the park 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:31.208
 There are always a few people who want to catch these kids. 

00:01:31.208 --> 00:01:35.912
 Don't be afraid because you can save your base friend by super god. 

00:01:35.912 --> 00:01:38.248
 A good friend of my life~~ 

00:01:38.248 --> 00:01:45.422
 Play with your good friend and you can pull your enemy back to the starting line. 

00:01:45.422 --> 00:01:51.528
 That's why you can easily get anyone into the grass and OOXX 

00:01:51.528 --> 00:01:53.520
 This move is not very easy to use. 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.002
 Use that old link to catch the one who caught your bed OOXXOOXX 

00:01:59.002 --> 00:02:05.675
 You like it, you can also grab the enemy and go to the tower to let them see how powerful they are. 

00:02:05.675 --> 00:02:09.446
 Let the children know how terrible the park at night is. 

00:02:09.446 --> 00:02:12.349
 Since you destroy the enemy again and again 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:12.782
 It’s time to go 

00:02:12.782 --> 00:02:14.684
 Kang Kang Kang Kangte will dog 

00:02:14.684 --> 00:02:17.587
 Steal all the monsters 

00:02:17.587 --> 00:02:20.056
 If there are enemies fighting with the stone 

00:02:20.056 --> 00:02:25.529
 Directly "slam" to steal and then reconcile with the good friend and the clown OOXXOXOX 

00:02:25.529 --> 00:02:31.868
 Two people playing the dog, you should keep two heavy blows and steal the dragon to let you swim in the money pile. 

00:02:31.868 --> 00:02:34.704
 If the spiderwoman is already playing the dragon 

00:02:34.704 --> 00:02:40.277
 Keep laughing, wait for your friend to come over and steal the bug. 

00:02:40.277 --> 00:02:42.479
 If you want to fight Balong 

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:44.447
 Grab the opposite side of the field 

00:02:44.447 --> 00:02:47.984
 Clear any possibility that prevents you from stealing Baron 

00:02:47.984 --> 00:02:52.822
 Then hit the wild two fears and you can easily take two heavy hits and take them off. 

00:02:52.822 --> 00:02:57.761
 The rest is to kill the rest. 

00:02:57.761 --> 00:02:59.029
 Super successful 

00:02:59.029 --> 00:03:01.020
 Teaching ends here 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.035
 Don't forget to watch more boring League of Legends videos on my channel. 

00:03:05.035 --> 00:03:07.704
 Welcome to leave a message in any language 

00:03:07.704 --> 00:03:10.307
 But I will only answer comments in English and French. 

00:03:10.307 --> 00:03:13.009
 Because I am a racist bastard 

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.944
 Ciaossu! 

00:03:13.944 --> 00:03:15.940
