00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
hey everyone so today I'm going to be

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.010 
hey everyone so today I'm going to be
reviewing<00:00:03.750> the<00:00:04.380> new<00:00:04.680> dye<00:00:04.980> so<00:00:05.190> squishies<00:00:05.700> and

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:06.020 
reviewing the new dye so squishies and

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:08.900 
reviewing the new dye so squishies and
the<00:00:07.020> dye<00:00:07.170> so<00:00:07.379> squishies<00:00:07.830> come<00:00:08.189> in<00:00:08.429> six

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
the dye so squishies come in six

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.850 
the dye so squishies come in six
different<00:00:09.150> designs<00:00:09.690> and<00:00:09.990> I<00:00:10.290> have<00:00:10.500> five<00:00:10.830> of

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
different designs and I have five of

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.370 
different designs and I have five of
them<00:00:11.160> to<00:00:11.370> show<00:00:11.519> you<00:00:11.580> guys<00:00:11.880> today<00:00:12.120> but<00:00:13.080> the

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
them to show you guys today but the

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.169 
them to show you guys today but the
reason<00:00:13.679> I<00:00:13.799> don't<00:00:14.009> have<00:00:14.219> the<00:00:14.340> six<00:00:14.610> design<00:00:14.969> is

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
reason I don't have the six design is

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.810 
reason I don't have the six design is
because<00:00:15.630> it<00:00:15.809> looks<00:00:16.049> like<00:00:16.320> this<00:00:16.680> squishy<00:00:17.010> which

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
because it looks like this squishy which

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.849 
because it looks like this squishy which
I<00:00:18.000> already<00:00:18.210> have<00:00:18.449> in<00:00:18.720> my<00:00:18.840> collection<00:00:19.050> and<00:00:19.710> I

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
I already have in my collection and I

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.490 
I already have in my collection and I
figured<00:00:20.279> would<00:00:20.490> be<00:00:20.789> a<00:00:21.029> waste<00:00:21.750> for<00:00:22.080> me<00:00:22.109> to

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
figured would be a waste for me to

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.310 
figured would be a waste for me to
purchase<00:00:22.769> another<00:00:23.220> one<00:00:23.519> so<00:00:24.210> yeah<00:00:24.900> that's<00:00:25.170> what

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
purchase another one so yeah that's what

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.839 
purchase another one so yeah that's what
it<00:00:25.410> looks<00:00:25.590> like<00:00:25.740> in<00:00:25.920> case<00:00:26.130> you<00:00:26.279> were<00:00:26.400> wondering

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
it looks like in case you were wondering

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.169 
it looks like in case you were wondering
and<00:00:27.060> now<00:00:27.779> moving<00:00:28.109> on<00:00:28.260> to<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:29.250> next<00:00:29.820> part<00:00:30.119> of

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
and now moving on to the next part of

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.179 
and now moving on to the next part of
the<00:00:30.330> review<00:00:30.779> I'm<00:00:31.019> going<00:00:31.529> to<00:00:31.590> start<00:00:31.800> off<00:00:31.949> with

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189

the packaging I think the packaging on
this<00:00:35.059> squishy<00:00:36.059> is<00:00:36.480> just<00:00:36.899> really<00:00:37.350> adorable<00:00:37.920> it

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
squishies look like outside of the

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.060

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
would like to do a comparison of the old

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.560 
would like to do a comparison of the old
dye<00:00:57.390> so<00:00:57.629> squishies<00:00:58.199> to<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.859> new<00:00:59.039> ones<00:00:59.280> so<00:01:00.149> in

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
case you guys didn't know these are a

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.179 
case you guys didn't know these are a
few<00:01:03.420> of<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.570> old<00:01:03.989> dye<00:01:04.229> so<00:01:04.439> squishies<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.070> what

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
few of the old dye so squishies and what

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.670 
few of the old dye so squishies and what
they<00:01:05.369> used<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.700> look<00:01:05.880> like<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.420> I<00:01:07.320> want<00:01:07.500> to

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
they used to look like and I want to

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.429 
they used to look like and I want to
start<00:01:07.890> off<00:01:08.070> by<00:01:08.100> saying<00:01:08.369> that<00:01:09.330> I<00:01:09.689> was<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.110> little

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
start off by saying that I was a little

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.550 
start off by saying that I was a little
disappointed<00:01:11.220> because<00:01:11.880> they<00:01:12.479> don't<00:01:12.930> have<00:01:13.049> a

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
disappointed because they don't have a

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.179 
disappointed because they don't have a
melon<00:01:14.130> bun<00:01:14.460> squishy<00:01:15.240> in<00:01:15.450> this<00:01:15.659> new<00:01:15.840> series

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:16.189 
melon bun squishy in this new series

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:19.249 
melon bun squishy in this new series
because<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.580> old<00:01:17.759> one<00:01:18.030> does<00:01:18.270> have<00:01:18.540> all<00:01:18.869> the

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
because the old one does have all the

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.350 
because the old one does have all the
faces<00:01:19.650> in<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:19.920> melon<00:01:20.220> one<00:01:20.400> version<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:20.970> I

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
faces in a melon one version and I

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.270 
faces in a melon one version and I
thought<00:01:21.570> that<00:01:21.780> was<00:01:21.960> a<00:01:22.140> little<00:01:22.530> bit<00:01:22.830> of<00:01:23.040> a

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
thought that was a little bit of a

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.420 
thought that was a little bit of a
downside<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:24.200> another<00:01:25.200> negative<00:01:25.530> thing<00:01:26.040> was

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
downside and another negative thing was

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.140 
downside and another negative thing was
that<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:27.540> texturing<00:01:28.290> is<00:01:28.560> not<00:01:29.520> as<00:01:29.729> good<00:01:30.090> in

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
that the texturing is not as good in

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.260 
that the texturing is not as good in
these<00:01:30.540> new<00:01:30.750> squishies<00:01:31.310> so<00:01:32.310> as<00:01:32.640> you<00:01:32.820> can<00:01:32.970> see

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
these new squishies so as you can see

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.510 
these new squishies so as you can see
the<00:01:33.780> old<00:01:34.020> squishies<00:01:34.560> had<00:01:34.799> a<00:01:34.829> really<00:01:35.340> nice

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
the old squishies had a really nice

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.240 
the old squishies had a really nice
texture<00:01:36.090> on<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.479> back<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.470> new<00:01:37.650> ones<00:01:37.920> are

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
texture on the back and the new ones are

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.630 
texture on the back and the new ones are
kind<00:01:38.790> of<00:01:39.049> they<00:01:40.049> kind<00:01:40.259> of<00:01:40.409> bland<00:01:41.070> on<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.490> back

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
kind of they kind of bland on the back

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.389 
kind of they kind of bland on the back
they're<00:01:42.000> just<00:01:42.180> flat<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:43.259> they<00:01:43.950> have<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.100> little

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
they're just flat and they have a little

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.639 
they're just flat and they have a little
bit<00:01:44.610> of<00:01:44.759> shading<00:01:45.030> but<00:01:45.420> not<00:01:45.630> much<00:01:45.930> is<00:01:46.200> really

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
bit of shading but not much is really

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.910 
bit of shading but not much is really
going<00:01:47.250> on<00:01:47.549> there<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.229> I<00:01:49.229> just<00:01:49.290> have<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.770> say

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
going on there and I just have to say

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.950 
going on there and I just have to say
that<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.369> old<00:01:50.610> buns<00:01:51.030> did<00:01:51.479> have<00:01:51.720> a<00:01:51.750> better

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
that the old buns did have a better

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.590 
that the old buns did have a better
texture<00:01:52.409> on<00:01:52.619> it<00:01:52.799> now<00:01:53.520> moving<00:01:53.909> on<00:01:54.210> to<00:01:54.390> the

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
texture on it now moving on to the

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.469 
texture on it now moving on to the
squishiness<00:01:55.219> comparison<00:01:56.219> as<00:01:56.399> you<00:01:57.030> can<00:01:57.210> see

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
squishiness comparison as you can see

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.550 
squishiness comparison as you can see
the<00:01:57.899> old<00:01:58.170> squishies<00:01:58.710> were<00:01:58.890> kind<00:01:59.250> of<00:01:59.340> hard<00:01:59.640> and

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
the old squishies were kind of hard and

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.069 
the old squishies were kind of hard and
more<00:02:01.560> of<00:02:01.890> like<00:02:02.250> a<00:02:02.460> stress<00:02:02.850> ball<00:02:02.880> material<00:02:03.689> but

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
more of like a stress ball material but

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.620 
more of like a stress ball material but
the<00:02:04.200> new<00:02:04.409> ones<00:02:04.680> are<00:02:04.950> very<00:02:05.460> very<00:02:05.909> soft<00:02:06.210> and<00:02:06.540> very

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
the new ones are very very soft and very

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.770 
the new ones are very very soft and very
squishy<00:02:07.229> which<00:02:07.740> is<00:02:07.979> one<00:02:08.670> thing<00:02:08.910> I<00:02:09.060> really<00:02:09.090> love

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
squishy which is one thing I really love

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:10.730 
squishy which is one thing I really love
about<00:02:09.810> them

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
about them

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.040 
about them
another<00:02:11.370> thing<00:02:11.670> I<00:02:11.910> noticed<00:02:12.540> about<00:02:12.780> the

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
another thing I noticed about the

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.680 
another thing I noticed about the
squishies<00:02:13.440> is<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:13.800> size<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:14.850> old<00:02:15.090> ones<00:02:15.420> were

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
squishies is the size the old ones were

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.530 
squishies is the size the old ones were
pretty<00:02:16.290> tiny<00:02:16.650> and<00:02:17.130> now<00:02:17.880> they<00:02:18.090> made<00:02:18.300> them<00:02:18.510> a

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
pretty tiny and now they made them a

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.600 
pretty tiny and now they made them a
little<00:02:18.810> bit<00:02:19.020> bigger<00:02:19.290> which<00:02:19.860> I<00:02:20.010> really<00:02:20.430> like

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
little bit bigger which I really like

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.050 
little bit bigger which I really like
it's<00:02:20.970> a<00:02:21.480> more<00:02:21.900> medium<00:02:22.290> size<00:02:22.530> now<00:02:22.800> and<00:02:23.100> another

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
it's a more medium size now and another

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.760 
it's a more medium size now and another
thing<00:02:24.330> I<00:02:24.450> like<00:02:24.660> about<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:25.080> new<00:02:25.200> series<00:02:25.500> is

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
thing I like about the new series is

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.640 
thing I like about the new series is
that<00:02:26.190> they<00:02:26.370> added<00:02:26.610> animal<00:02:27.300> characters<00:02:27.810> and<00:02:28.200> I

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
that they added animal characters and I

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.680 
that they added animal characters and I
really<00:02:29.130> love<00:02:29.310> the<00:02:29.460> animal<00:02:29.910> shaped<00:02:30.150> buns

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
really love the animal shaped buns

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.320 
really love the animal shaped buns
especially<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:31.710> bunny<00:02:31.920> one<00:02:32.190> I<00:02:32.400> just<00:02:32.670> find<00:02:33.150> it

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
especially the bunny one I just find it

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.230 
especially the bunny one I just find it
so<00:02:33.410> adorable<00:02:34.410> and<00:02:34.650> it's<00:02:35.370> my<00:02:35.580> favorite<00:02:36.090> thing

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
so adorable and it's my favorite thing

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.040 
so adorable and it's my favorite thing
about<00:02:36.300> the<00:02:36.630> whole<00:02:36.750> series<00:02:37.230> so<00:02:38.100> in<00:02:38.610> total<00:02:39.600> I

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
about the whole series so in total I

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.370 
about the whole series so in total I
would<00:02:40.290> have<00:02:40.500> to<00:02:40.740> say<00:02:41.010> that<00:02:41.420> if<00:02:42.420> I<00:02:42.960> had<00:02:43.170> to

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
would have to say that if I had to

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.770 
would have to say that if I had to
choose<00:02:43.650> between<00:02:43.680> old<00:02:44.400> dices<00:02:45.120> Kashi's<00:02:45.540> and<00:02:45.720> the

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
choose between old dices Kashi's and the

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.870 
choose between old dices Kashi's and the
new<00:02:45.930> ones<00:02:46.200> I<00:02:46.470> would<00:02:46.560> have<00:02:47.160> to<00:02:47.310> say<00:02:47.490> that<00:02:47.760> the

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
new ones I would have to say that the

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.650 
new ones I would have to say that the
new<00:02:48.030> ones<00:02:48.270> are<00:02:48.480> my<00:02:48.930> favorites<00:02:49.590> and<00:02:50.090> I<00:02:51.090> just

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
new ones are my favorites and I just

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.470 
new ones are my favorites and I just
think<00:02:51.960> that<00:02:52.140> the<00:02:52.290> sizing<00:02:52.800> is<00:02:52.890> better<00:02:53.220> and<00:02:53.670> I

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
think that the sizing is better and I

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.780 
think that the sizing is better and I
think<00:02:54.780> also<00:02:55.080> the<00:02:55.740> basis<00:02:56.160> that<00:02:56.190> they<00:02:56.430> have<00:02:56.610> on

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
think also the basis that they have on

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.540 
think also the basis that they have on
the<00:02:56.910> squishies<00:02:57.330> are<00:02:57.510> a<00:02:57.540> little<00:02:57.750> bit<00:02:58.050> cuter

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
the squishies are a little bit cuter

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.430 
the squishies are a little bit cuter
because<00:02:59.550> the<00:02:59.910> old<00:03:00.150> ones<00:03:00.450> I<00:03:00.690> feel<00:03:01.020> like<00:03:01.200> those

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
because the old ones I feel like those

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.980 
because the old ones I feel like those
are<00:03:01.620> really<00:03:01.740> generic<00:03:02.160> faces<00:03:02.970> you<00:03:03.660> see<00:03:03.840> them

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
are really generic faces you see them

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:05.750 
are really generic faces you see them
everywhere<00:03:04.350> like<00:03:04.650> on<00:03:04.800> all<00:03:05.010> the<00:03:05.250> hamburger

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
everywhere like on all the hamburger

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.510 
everywhere like on all the hamburger
squishies<00:03:06.150> and<00:03:06.390> stuff<00:03:06.600> like<00:03:06.780> that<00:03:06.990> but<00:03:07.770> these

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
squishies and stuff like that but these

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.760 
squishies and stuff like that but these
new<00:03:08.940> Daiso<00:03:09.210> species<00:03:09.750> have<00:03:09.930> cuter<00:03:10.290> faces

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
new Daiso species have cuter faces

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.790 
new Daiso species have cuter faces
better<00:03:11.490> size<00:03:11.880> and<00:03:12.360> they<00:03:13.080> are<00:03:13.200> much<00:03:13.470> softer

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
better size and they are much softer

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.880 
better size and they are much softer
which<00:03:14.250> I<00:03:14.460> really<00:03:14.820> like<00:03:14.970> about<00:03:15.150> them<00:03:15.540> but<00:03:16.170> that

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
which I really like about them but that

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.880 
which I really like about them but that
