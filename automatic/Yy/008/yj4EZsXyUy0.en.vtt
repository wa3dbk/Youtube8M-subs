00:00:29.011 --> 00:00:31.782
 I have been in heat for days 

00:00:33.554 --> 00:00:36.386
 So I'll hunt me a bald wild 

00:00:38.183 --> 00:00:40.919
 And by the morning I'm sitting 

00:00:42.726 --> 00:00:45.250
 So I can give shots 

00:00:47.462 --> 00:00:49.791
 In the country, on the sea, 

00:00:49.791 --> 00:00:52.042
 Death is waiting 

00:00:52.432 --> 00:00:57.260
 The creature must die! 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.497
 To die! 

00:01:14.449 --> 00:01:17.027
 A Schmaltier comes on the runs 

00:01:17.027 --> 00:01:19.711
 Has sunbathed in the high thatch 

00:01:23.897 --> 00:01:26.068
 Good track, deep in the Tann 

00:01:26.068 --> 00:01:28.696
 The mirror shines, I'm baking 

00:01:33.016 --> 00:01:35.320
 The fronds twitch like Fingeraal 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.777
 The shotgun jumps from the sheath 

00:01:37.777 --> 00:01:40.772
 (Waidmann's ... man's ... man's ... man's salvation!) 

00:01:42.117 --> 00:01:44.493
 I sweep the bast from the horn 

00:01:44.493 --> 00:01:46.962
 And give her a dashed grain 

00:01:46.962 --> 00:01:49.868
 (Waidmann's ... man's ... man's ... man's salvation!) 

00:01:51.554 --> 00:01:53.835
 In the country, on the sea, 

00:01:53.835 --> 00:01:56.150
 Death is waiting 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:02.451
 The creature must die! 

00:02:03.016 --> 00:02:06.017
 (Waidmann's ... man's ... man's ... man's salvation!) 

00:02:07.583 --> 00:02:11.172
 To die! 

00:02:12.158 --> 00:02:15.281
 (Waidmann's ... man's ... man's ... man's salvation!) 

00:02:53.023 --> 00:02:55.973
 She feels the muzzle energy 

00:02:57.542 --> 00:03:01.118
 Fine sweat drips on the knee 

00:03:02.403 --> 00:03:04.308
 In the countryside, 

00:03:07.106 --> 00:03:08.841
 on the sea 

00:03:11.514 --> 00:03:14.982
 To die! 

00:03:16.106 --> 00:03:19.185
 (Waidmann's ... man's ... man's ... man's salvation!) 

00:03:20.701 --> 00:03:23.731
 To die! 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:28.421
 (Waidmann's ... man's ... man's ... man's salvation!) 

00:03:29.721 --> 00:03:33.356
 In the countryside, on the sea 

00:03:34.528 --> 00:03:37.874
 (Waidmann's ... man's ... man's ... man's salvation!) 

00:03:39.048 --> 00:03:45.796
 In the country, on the sea lurks spoiling 

00:03:46.173 --> 00:03:49.435
 The creature must die!
