00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
good dehydrator and I just get it

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.130 
good dehydrator and I just get it
started<00:01:36.840> on<00:01:37.259> about<00:01:37.950> 145<00:01:38.939> for<00:01:39.360> an<00:01:39.450> hour<00:01:39.659> and

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
started on about 145 for an hour and

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.770 
started on about 145 for an hour and
then<00:01:40.259> turn<00:01:40.530> it<00:01:40.710> down<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:41.189> 120<00:01:41.759> grains<00:01:42.450> actually

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
then turn it down to 120 grains actually

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.819 
then turn it down to 120 grains actually
can<00:01:43.259> go<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.619> little<00:01:44.810> warmer<00:01:45.810> than<00:01:46.170> say

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
can go a little warmer than say

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.590 
can go a little warmer than say
vegetables<00:01:47.700> or

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
vegetables or

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.230 
vegetables or
these<00:01:50.470> grades<00:01:50.800> actually<00:01:51.070> their<00:01:51.490> enzymes<00:01:51.850> stay

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
these grades actually their enzymes stay

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.750 
these grades actually their enzymes stay
intact<00:01:52.630> a<00:01:52.990> little<00:01:53.410> bit<00:01:53.560> higher<00:01:54.160> temperature

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:54.760 
intact a little bit higher temperature

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.780 
intact a little bit higher temperature
so<00:01:54.790> one<00:01:55.690> hour<00:01:55.870> on<00:01:56.020> 1:45<00:01:56.890> to<00:01:56.920> get<00:01:57.280> it<00:01:57.370> warmed<00:01:57.640> up

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
so one hour on 1:45 to get it warmed up

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.550 
so one hour on 1:45 to get it warmed up
in<00:01:57.940> there<00:01:58.150> the<00:01:58.630> bread<00:01:58.870> itself<00:01:59.320> actually

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
in there the bread itself actually

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.710 
in there the bread itself actually
hasn't<00:02:00.160> reached<00:02:00.340> that<00:02:00.640> temperature<00:02:00.820> by<00:02:01.690> the

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
hasn't reached that temperature by the

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.530 
hasn't reached that temperature by the
time<00:02:01.990> I<00:02:02.110> turn<00:02:02.320> it<00:02:02.470> down<00:02:02.620> to<00:02:02.860> about<00:02:02.980> 120<00:02:03.420> let<00:02:04.420> it

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 
time I turn it down to about 120 let it

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.210 
time I turn it down to about 120 let it
roll<00:02:04.750> all<00:02:05.020> day<00:02:05.260> and<00:02:05.500> also<00:02:05.920> you're<00:02:06.070> going<00:02:06.160> to
