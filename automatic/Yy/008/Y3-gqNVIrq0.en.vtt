00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.730
 Welcome to the whole 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.860
 computer scientist finally weekend 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.380

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.180
 Saturday mornings and I'm glad that 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.250
 I like a little bit about my week 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.140
 You can tell that you are talking about the whole thing 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.809
 looks again something completely new 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.090
 I'll take it tomorrow 

00:00:30.809 --> 00:00:35.940
 it then again new playlist I introduce 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.980
 regularly a new champion for 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.290
 league of legends I sport myself 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.000
 think for yourself, of course, then write 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.740
 Also in the comments what you from 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.270
 keep this whole new idea 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.030
 or I already have 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.040
 written on facebook what i plan 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.230
 how to proceed with the canal 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.090
 and it is getting more and more 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.440
 I try as much time as possible 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.600
 to infect 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.370
 I do not have as much time as many 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.530
 others i can not do that yet 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.140
 full time but I hope 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.850
 you fit the whole and you are 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.159
 satisfied that it is always on 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.950
 Pieces more in this format yes 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.869
 disgusting weekend means the fun I talk 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.749
 first a little bit about my week 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.600
 how warm a week what was it for 

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:21.990
 highlights and then, of course, wishes 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.670
 I also wish you a nice weekend, yes 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.829
 first a nice breakfast if you 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.649
 while you are good appetite people and 

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:31.499
 rather a week so finally have the 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:32.159
 horny sweater you see it I am brown 

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:34.350
 become 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.020
 I have two days at the lake now 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.920
 spent at altwarmbÃ¼chen aasee here 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.139
 around Hanover 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.950
 i was with my girlfriends ladies and 

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:43.469
 a buddy 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.600
 we really have three four days each day 

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:47.520
 hours there and goes longer 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.560
 Just not after three four hours 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.759
 The air out you actually think that 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.130
 you are a bit in the sun 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.569
 So relax because you lie and you 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.170
 sign and you can go into the water 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:56.969
 throw 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.679
 but after three hours you become people 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.409
 that can come home after three hours 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:03.810
 You are completely finished because 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.480
 I just because I'm just the sun 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.130
 that can 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.900
 the energy has burned out yes and there 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.360
 I have my good pizza popped today 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.710
 after we drive in the sun and 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.120
 Now I am fine now 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.910
 I get a bit of energy again 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.740
 In any case, the good weather is here 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.970
 I am happy that summer is here and me 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:23.080
 I am all the more happy 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:25.590
 because people so I have been vacationing 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.700
 wednesday last week I have holidays 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.030
 and I've also been a parker 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.620
 games with you gambled advantage 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.720
 Of course they are kind of too 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.340
 have a vacation or are online in the morning 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.990
 because I always like to sit down 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.390
 if I'm free then in the morning turn 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:42.820
 really really in the morning and 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.160
 a game that has to be extra here 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:47.830
 highlight because a game was right 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.570
 blatant and because she comes 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.850
 comment on the whole if you yourself 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:54.250
 that was the dare 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.840
 So we knew you were the whole 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.230
 I am there balanced time 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.230
 played 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:04.750
 fieldpost top played exactly against olaf o 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.390
 that was pretty cool I was 17 5 vl 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.400
 Cost with the opponents was the dragon 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.610
 pretty strong and there was a man on it 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.240
 and down so it really was 251 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.400
 we won 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.950
 then we have each other 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.330
 somehow split for two if the 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.950
 we lost then too 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.709
 It was important in these part that we ourselves 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:26.709
 groups and then it was like that 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:29.350
 opponents are acidic simple had the 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:33.370
 just pushed that did not do anything 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:36.940
 except split pusch and that has in the 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:39.400
 time the inhibitors crack two 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.080
 He has cracked inhibitors because of us 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.690
 otherwise we have a team of experts if we have 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:46.920
 won because it's mostly then 14 52 the 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:50.260
 gates of two windows built with raven 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.720
 that he has a lot of attack speed and 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.300
 then it was so important 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.070
 have won last time and we 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:59.950
 pushed and was in this too 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:01.840
 case and he died and we have 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.270
 already packed people ten more 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.860
 Seconds we both have nexus duration 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:08.020
 we can get it and we can 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:10.100
 apply and we have at the 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:13.190
 next opponent still 5 seconds 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:15.320
 nicole how to nibble on the nexus nexus 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.510
 live half and what happens then 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:20.180
 the screen is panning to our nexus 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:23.420
 that you are dad have our nexus 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:25.370
 killed he destroyed people at this 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:27.470
 lost game though we have it 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.570
 really three seconds or so seen 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:31.370
 These are not those games you play 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.260
 necessarily forget so right 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:36.890
 highlights the right one of the hottest 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:39.220
 gangs the whole thing she was watching this video on 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:42.320
 Saturday is now Friday mornings 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:44.090
 Friday night and yes we see a 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:48.620
 bit off perhaps looking out 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:50.390
 our window in any case something on 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.010
 every case I have even if they 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:54.170
 I'm totally ghana for 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:57.620
 I discovered I did not find it 

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:59.660
 so so really shit the anger the 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.620
 from you this can but I found him something 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:02.630
 so uninteresting 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:05.180
 I always thought what job 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:08.060
 scania does better than other gear 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:10.580
 land and somehow yes the multi is 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:12.440
 It's super fast, very fast 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.060
 a bit treki but somehow like that 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.750
 really better than when I feel like that 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.060
 imagine 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:19.520
 because these are incredible utility 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:21.140
 of course two other types as well 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.990
 For example, if we are rarely in the nautilus 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:26.090
 that's off and I've got ghana always 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.530
 played again from the plant 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:29.090
 I always thought just has one 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:30.910
 a bit from escalation so I use 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:32.470
 the play out tanki with a little bit off 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:36.410
 pustekuchen 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:38.480
 Spirit of the elderly is the first 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:41.300
 thing you have to rely on him 

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:43.430
 once bunkspeed has on the l lizard 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:46.550
 This will be greatly affected by these scorpions 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:48.380
 and that he makes through this pressure which 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:50.990
 he has his crew and over again 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:52.910
 get this true damage on the 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:55.400
 small camps so often the lack and 

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:57.410
 creates it so fast 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:00.890
 this fact that he does then quite often 

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:03.290
 click this true damage on it and also 

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:05.930
 later when you clear up when you waves 

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:08.630
 celebrates cleared or the team that is 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:10.400
 really amazing but with it below 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:12.140
 this strong and ii with yourselves 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:14.420
 a snap could never be to the opponents 

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:15.889
 I still would like to wish 

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:18.919
 that maybe a bit more range 

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:20.840
 So this fleschhut team is 

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:22.069
 the most effective with scanner but then 

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:25.189
 you grab always synonymous 

00:06:22.069 --> 00:06:26.900
 but Ghana is not bad at all 

00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:28.990
 So you can really raid him now 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:32.090
 play and I would recommend 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:34.729
 spirit of the parents is then trinity 

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:38.360
 force and then just turn on you 

00:06:34.729 --> 00:06:40.249
 he even fire hamburgs from me 

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:42.319
 and of course a little bit of magic 

00:06:40.249 --> 00:06:44.449
 Resistance to magic resistance shoes 

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:45.919
 or film was over and even with it 

00:06:44.449 --> 00:06:49.009
 you could apply wonderfully and then 

00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:51.979
 someone is talking so is wearing scale 

00:06:49.009 --> 00:06:54.889
 really a big thing and people has the 

00:06:51.979 --> 00:06:57.800
 hack germany has won ours 

00:06:54.889 --> 00:07:00.080
 game is so lp midcap perhaps 

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:02.539
 did you follow it on facebook 

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:05.900
 Something posted I posted something on 

00:07:02.539 --> 00:07:08.360
 every case yes horny hummels has the gate 

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:11.539
 shot really nice right 

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:14.810
 bad is latent earrings I found I horny 

00:07:11.539 --> 00:07:16.610
 Although I would have allowed 

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:18.710
 that the french then still a gate 

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:20.029
 Shoot with it to the extension comes 

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:21.830
 because that was pretty cool we are still 

00:07:20.029 --> 00:07:23.539
 have invited friends round with 

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:25.939
 so looked around his girlfriends 

00:07:23.539 --> 00:07:26.539
 was really cool but the wm stays 

00:07:25.939 --> 00:07:28.310
 exciting 

00:07:26.539 --> 00:07:30.529
 I was following it all up 

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:31.460
 Of course we celebrate big time 

00:07:30.529 --> 00:07:34.399

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:36.649

 a little sun fueled and right 

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:46.490
