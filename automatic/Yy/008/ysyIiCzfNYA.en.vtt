birds<00:00:34.500> now<00:00:35.070> you<00:00:35.190> might<00:00:35.309> think<00:00:35.340> that's<00:00:35.730> a<00:00:36.030> lot

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
birds now you might think that's a lot

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.200 
birds now you might think that's a lot
of<00:00:36.300> stalls<00:00:36.840> but<00:00:37.230> this<00:00:37.800> is<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.040> really<00:00:38.280> fun<00:00:38.640> mixed

of stalls but this is a really fun mixed
species<00:00:39.780> exhibit<00:00:40.079> so<00:00:40.350> they're<00:00:40.469> gonna<00:00:40.590> be<00:00:40.770> four

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
species exhibit so they're gonna be four

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.910 
species exhibit so they're gonna be four
or<00:00:41.489> five<00:00:41.640> six<00:00:41.969> different<00:00:42.329> species<00:00:42.930> of<00:00:43.590> mammals

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
or five six different species of mammals

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.020 
or five six different species of mammals
and<00:00:43.980> birds<00:00:44.070> all<00:00:44.370> out<00:00:44.550> in<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.730> yard<00:00:44.910> together

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
and birds all out in the yard together

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.760 
and birds all out in the yard together
so<00:00:45.719> to<00:00:45.780> have<00:00:45.960> that<00:00:46.170> you<00:00:46.260> need<00:00:46.410> to<00:00:46.500> have<00:00:46.620> the

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
so to have that you need to have the

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.170 
so to have that you need to have the
ability<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.129> mix<00:00:47.309> them<00:00:47.430> a<00:00:47.489> little<00:00:47.700> bit<00:00:47.820> inside

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
ability to mix them a little bit inside

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.779 
ability to mix them a little bit inside
as<00:00:48.420> well<00:00:48.600> now<00:00:49.260> this<00:00:49.800> is<00:00:49.980> not<00:00:50.129> just<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.399> concrete

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
as well now this is not just a concrete

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.000 
as well now this is not just a concrete

floors we have heaters in them and
that's<00:01:00.120> very<00:01:00.210> good<00:01:00.719> for<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:00.960> animals<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:01.289> keep

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
that's very good for the animals to keep

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.689 
that's very good for the animals to keep
them<00:01:01.620> warm<00:01:01.829> in<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.039> winter<00:01:02.309> rather<00:01:02.520> than

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
blowing too much hot air on them also

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.280 
blowing too much hot air on them also
the<00:01:05.430> floor<00:01:05.640> you<00:01:05.760> can<00:01:05.880> see<00:01:06.000> little<00:01:06.150> sparkles<00:01:06.840> it

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
the floor you can see little sparkles it

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.289 
the floor you can see little sparkles it

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
has little metal flakes in it and it's

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.940 
has little metal flakes in it and it's
rough<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:09.659> that<00:01:09.810> helps<00:01:10.110> on<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.290> hooves<00:01:10.680> of

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
rough and that helps on the hooves of

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.410 
rough and that helps on the hooves of
these<00:01:11.070> animals<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.520> wear<00:01:11.790> them<00:01:11.970> down<00:01:12.150> much

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
these animals to wear them down much

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.969 
these animals to wear them down much
like<00:01:12.600> they<00:01:12.780> would<00:01:12.990> when<00:01:13.500> they<00:01:13.530> live<00:01:13.799> in<00:01:13.890> the

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
like they would when they live in the

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:14.539 
like they would when they live in the
wild

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
wild

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.670

we've<00:01:15.119> got<00:01:15.240> specialized<00:01:15.780> doors<00:01:16.110> that<00:01:16.380> we<00:01:16.500> made

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
we've got specialized doors that we made

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.770 
we've got specialized doors that we made
ourselves<00:01:16.909> they're<00:01:17.909> made<00:01:18.090> out<00:01:18.119> of<00:01:18.270> recycled

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
ourselves they're made out of recycled

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.289 
ourselves they're made out of recycled
plastic<00:01:19.200> so<00:01:20.070> they<00:01:20.220> won't<00:01:20.400> rot<00:01:20.700> we<00:01:21.030> really

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
plastic so they won't rot we really

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.670 
plastic so they won't rot we really
think<00:01:21.509> they'll<00:01:21.630> last<00:01:21.869> pretty<00:01:22.290> much

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
think they'll last pretty much

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.740 
think they'll last pretty much
permanently<00:01:22.979> I<00:01:23.460> know<00:01:23.880> this<00:01:24.180> will<00:01:24.390> because<00:01:24.600> the

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
permanently I know this will because the

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.080 
permanently I know this will because the
bars<00:01:24.990> are<00:01:25.290> stainless<00:01:25.860> steel<00:01:26.189> so<00:01:26.850> it's<00:01:27.030> a

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
bars are stainless steel so it's a

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.789 
bars are stainless steel so it's a
world-class<00:01:27.420> facility<00:01:27.780> I'll<00:01:28.170> be<00:01:28.290> honest<00:01:28.619> it's

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
world-class facility I'll be honest it's

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.440 
world-class facility I'll be honest it's
the<00:01:28.950> best<00:01:29.189> hoof<00:01:29.490> stock<00:01:29.790> bar<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.180> I've<00:01:30.270> ever

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
the best hoof stock bar and I've ever

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.200 
the best hoof stock bar and I've ever
seen<00:01:30.689> anywhere<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:31.860> in<00:01:32.520> it<00:01:32.670> will<00:01:32.850> be<00:01:32.970> all

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
seen anywhere and in it will be all

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.899 
seen anywhere and in it will be all
sorts<00:01:33.630> of<00:01:33.869> animals<00:01:34.320> now<00:01:34.829> when<00:01:35.460> you<00:01:35.549> look<00:01:35.700> up

here<00:01:36.240> you<00:01:36.299> see<00:01:37.049> extremely<00:01:37.530> bright<00:01:37.829> light<00:01:37.890> you

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
here you see extremely bright light you

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.440 
here you see extremely bright light you
think<00:01:38.400> oh<00:01:38.490> gosh<00:01:38.729> are<00:01:38.909> there<00:01:39.000> waste<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.329> energy

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
think oh gosh are there waste and energy

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.870 
think oh gosh are there waste and energy
well<00:01:39.810> no<00:01:40.020> that<00:01:40.829> is<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.070> thing<00:01:41.159> called<00:01:41.520> a<00:01:41.610> solar

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
well no that is the thing called a solar

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.510 
well no that is the thing called a solar
tube<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.869> it<00:01:43.290> does<00:01:43.470> not<00:01:43.590> have<00:01:43.740> electricity<00:01:44.369> in

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
tube and it does not have electricity in

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.490 
tube and it does not have electricity in
it<00:01:44.549> it's<00:01:44.820> letting<00:01:45.509> ultraviolet<00:01:45.960> light<00:01:46.290> in

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
it it's letting ultraviolet light in

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.780 
it it's letting ultraviolet light in
vitamin<00:01:47.310> D<00:01:47.430> vitamin<00:01:47.460> C<00:01:48.210> good<00:01:48.960> for<00:01:49.259> them<00:01:49.470> and

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
vitamin D vitamin C good for them and

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.639 
vitamin D vitamin C good for them and
obviously<00:01:50.790> saves<00:01:51.060> on<00:01:51.240> energy<00:01:51.570> on<00:01:51.840> real<00:01:52.380> cloudy

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
obviously saves on energy on real cloudy

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.050 
obviously saves on energy on real cloudy
days<00:01:52.890> or<00:01:53.130> at<00:01:53.250> night<00:01:53.430> if<00:01:53.610> we<00:01:53.640> need<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:53.850> be<00:01:53.970> in

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
days or at night if we need to be in

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.940 
days or at night if we need to be in
here<00:01:54.180> we<00:01:54.329> also<00:01:54.450> have<00:01:54.600> LED<00:01:55.320> lights<00:01:55.560> which<00:01:55.829> are

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
here we also have LED lights which are

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.249 
here we also have LED lights which are
fuel-efficient<00:01:56.640> but<00:01:57.090> most<00:01:57.420> days<00:01:57.719> we<00:01:58.079> won't

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
fuel-efficient but most days we won't

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.139 
fuel-efficient but most days we won't
even<00:01:58.380> turn<00:01:58.680> on<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.070> lights<00:01:59.250> here<00:01:59.909> in<00:02:00.030> this

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
even turn on the lights here in this

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.600 
even turn on the lights here in this
barn<00:02:00.479> so<00:02:01.350> we're<00:02:01.619> back<00:02:01.829> here<00:02:02.100> behind<00:02:02.280> the

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
barn so we're back here behind the
