 old central train station of the 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.199
 savanna will facilitate communications 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.510
 between the center of Bogotá and its 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.580
 nearby municipalities 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.350
 the west corridor line 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.350

 train of the sheet from the station 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.490

 proposal the south corridor also part 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.340

 with 18 kilometers in length its layout 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:55.159
 largely coincides with the old 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:57.740
 southern railroad the two runners 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:00.319
 will have a fleet of approximately 50 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:03.079
 trains with frequencies in peak hours of 

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:05.479
 5 and 3 minutes respectively to give 

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:06.730
 serving 100 million travelers 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:08.950

 will have stations located from 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:14.170
 the 500 meters away in the 

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:16.330
 urban sections up to 5 km in sections 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.310
 intercity buses that will have a system

 maintenance 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.340
 besides reducing travel times 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.860
 this means of transport will allow a 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.380
 decrease of 180 thousand tons per year 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.100
 in carbon dioxide emissions 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.990
 contributing to improve efficiency 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.990
 energetic of public transport 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:52.070
