annoying themes were it changes some of

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.100 
annoying themes were it changes some of
the<00:00:35.370> icons<00:00:35.460> were<00:00:35.910> really<00:00:36.660> completely

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
the icons were really completely

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.920 
the icons were really completely
different<00:00:37.739> forms<00:00:38.219> it<00:00:38.370> hasn't<00:00:38.730> changed<00:00:38.930> so

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
different forms it hasn't changed so

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.990 
different forms it hasn't changed so
then<00:00:40.110> it<00:00:40.260> looks<00:00:40.469> stupid<00:00:40.800> because<00:00:41.340> half<00:00:41.760> your

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
then it looks stupid because half your

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000 
then it looks stupid because half your
apps<00:00:42.120> are<00:00:42.329> completely<00:00:42.899> different<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.920> of

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
apps are completely different to the of

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.270 
apps are completely different to the of
wraps<00:00:44.510> so<00:00:45.510> as<00:00:46.379> you<00:00:46.680> can<00:00:46.770> see<00:00:46.950> they've<00:00:47.129> kept

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
wraps so as you can see they've kept

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.139 
wraps so as you can see they've kept
most<00:00:47.489> of<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.850> stuff<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.270> same<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:50.149> it

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.220 
most of the stuff the same and it
doesn't<00:00:51.570> really<00:00:51.750> it's<00:00:52.500> just<00:00:53.629> quite<00:00:54.629> nice<00:00:54.899> it's

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230
