like that there you go
push<00:02:14.910> through<00:02:17.630> we're<00:02:18.630> going<00:02:18.720> to<00:02:18.840> do<00:02:19.020> this<00:02:19.290> five

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
push through we're going to do this five

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:26.780 
push through we're going to do this five
or<00:02:19.770> six<00:02:20.010> times<00:02:22.490> just<00:02:23.490> like<00:02:23.610> that<00:02:23.730> and<00:02:25.790> what

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790

or six times just like that and what
this<00:02:26.940> is<00:02:27.120> going<00:02:27.300> to<00:02:27.480> do<00:02:27.660> when<00:02:28.620> you<00:02:28.740> pull<00:02:29.010> on<00:02:29.220> it

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
this is going to do when you pull on it

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.570 
this is going to do when you pull on it
it's<00:02:29.610> going<00:02:29.910> to<00:02:30.060> create<00:02:30.330> a<00:02:30.390> zigzagged<00:02:31.280> seam<00:02:32.280> it

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
it's going to create a zigzagged seam it

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.160 
it's going to create a zigzagged seam it
won't<00:02:32.790> be<00:02:32.910> a<00:02:32.940> straight<00:02:33.300> seam<00:02:33.540> like<00:02:33.840> you<00:02:34.020> would

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
won't be a straight seam like you would

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.710 
won't be a straight seam like you would
have<00:02:34.380> from<00:02:34.740> a<00:02:34.830> sewing<00:02:35.040> machine<00:02:35.490> but<00:02:36.330> it'll<00:02:36.540> be

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
have from a sewing machine but it'll be

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:43.850 
have from a sewing machine but it'll be
a<00:02:36.750> zigzagged<00:02:37.940> tighten<00:02:38.940> it<00:02:39.030> up<00:02:42.350> underneath<00:02:43.350> you

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
a zigzagged tighten it up underneath you

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.620 
a zigzagged tighten it up underneath you
can<00:02:44.010> see<00:02:44.190> that<00:02:44.400> the<00:02:44.490> fabric<00:02:44.670> turned<00:02:45.150> down<00:02:45.360> like

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
can see that the fabric turned down like

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.740 
can see that the fabric turned down like
it<00:02:45.780> would<00:02:45.960> if<00:02:46.200> you<00:02:46.380> had<00:02:46.410> sewn<00:02:46.830> this<00:02:47.100> from<00:02:47.430> the

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
it would if you had sewn this from the

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.970 
it would if you had sewn this from the
wrong<00:02:48.750> side<00:02:48.810> out<00:02:49.140> and<00:02:49.680> the<00:02:50.160> insides<00:02:50.580> together

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
wrong side out and the insides together

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.500 
wrong side out and the insides together
now<00:02:52.980> with<00:02:53.190> a<00:02:53.220> small<00:02:53.580> stitch<00:02:53.940> and<00:02:54.270> this<00:02:54.360> is

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
now with a small stitch and this is

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.050 
now with a small stitch and this is
exact<00:02:54.959> same<00:02:55.380> this<00:02:56.160> gives<00:02:56.430> you<00:02:56.550> a<00:02:56.580> really<00:02:56.910> good

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
exact same this gives you a really good

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.100 
exact same this gives you a really good
chance<00:02:57.360> of<00:02:57.660> hiding<00:02:58.080> the<00:02:58.260> seam<00:02:59.780> next<00:03:00.780> take<00:03:00.959> your

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
chance of hiding the seam next take your

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.500 
chance of hiding the seam next take your
needle<00:03:01.350> and<00:03:01.650> go<00:03:01.739> back<00:03:02.160> through<00:03:02.520> and<00:03:02.790> pull<00:03:03.270> out

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
needle and go back through and pull out

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.350 
needle and go back through and pull out
all<00:03:03.780> the<00:03:04.110> fibers<00:03:04.620> I<00:03:04.650> got<00:03:05.190> tucked<00:03:05.520> in<00:03:05.700> to<00:03:06.209> that

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
all the fibers I got tucked in to that

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:12.979 
all the fibers I got tucked in to that
scene<00:03:07.100> just<00:03:08.100> like<00:03:08.280> this<00:03:10.970> there<00:03:11.970> make<00:03:12.720> sure<00:03:12.750> you

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
scene just like this there make sure you

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:14.600 
scene just like this there make sure you
don't<00:03:13.110> pull<00:03:13.380> out<00:03:13.410> your<00:03:13.769> stitch<00:03:14.040> that<00:03:14.250> you<00:03:14.400> put

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
don't pull out your stitch that you put

in in the first place and so what you'll

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.580 
in in the first place and so what you'll
do<00:03:23.730> is<00:03:23.880> you'll<00:03:24.090> do<00:03:24.810> five<00:03:25.050> or<00:03:25.230> six<00:03:25.410> stitches

fuzz out of the seam you'll do five or

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.740 
fuzz out of the seam you'll do five or
six<00:03:31.560> more<00:03:31.800> and<00:03:31.860> tighten<00:03:32.850> it<00:03:32.910> up<00:03:33.030> pull<00:03:33.420> the<00:03:33.570> fuzz

out<00:03:33.989> of<00:03:34.050> the<00:03:34.110> seam<00:03:34.350> all<00:03:34.709> the<00:03:34.739> way<00:03:34.830> at<00:03:34.980> the<00:03:35.010> scene

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
out of the seam all the way at the scene

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.449 
out of the seam all the way at the scene
I<00:03:35.550> only<00:03:36.180> do<00:03:36.420> this<00:03:36.660> on<00:03:36.989> areas<00:03:37.800> of<00:03:37.830> the<00:03:38.100> puppet

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
I only do this on areas of the puppet

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.430 
I only do this on areas of the puppet
that<00:03:38.580> are<00:03:38.730> going<00:03:39.030> to<00:03:39.180> be<00:03:39.330> seeing<00:03:39.720> if<00:03:40.260> it's

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
that are going to be seeing if it's

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.080 
that are going to be seeing if it's
going<00:03:40.620> to<00:03:40.680> be<00:03:40.800> covered<00:03:41.100> by<00:03:41.130> clothing<00:03:41.550> or<00:03:41.850> hair

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
going to be covered by clothing or hair

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.020 
going to be covered by clothing or hair
I<00:03:42.120> don't<00:03:42.390> bother<00:03:43.190> because<00:03:44.190> sewing<00:03:44.820> by<00:03:45.000> a

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
I don't bother because sewing by a

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.290 
I don't bother because sewing by a
machine<00:03:45.480> is<00:03:45.750> much<00:03:45.930> faster<00:03:46.470> so<00:03:47.220> I'll<00:03:47.640> do<00:03:48.150> this

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.300 
machine is much faster so I'll do this

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.690 
machine is much faster so I'll do this
on<00:03:48.510> the<00:03:48.600> front<00:03:48.750> of<00:03:48.900> the<00:03:49.019> face<00:03:49.230> and<00:03:50.010> if<00:03:50.519> it's

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
on the front of the face and if it's

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.740 
on the front of the face and if it's
important<00:03:51.420> I'll<00:03:51.990> do<00:03:52.950> it<00:03:53.100> on<00:03:53.370> the<00:03:53.910> arms<00:03:54.360> and<00:03:54.660> the

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
important I'll do it on the arms and the

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.280 
important I'll do it on the arms and the
hands<00:03:55.050> that<00:03:55.410> kind<00:03:55.620> of<00:03:55.650> thing

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
hands that kind of thing

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.570 
hands that kind of thing
only<00:03:58.290> if<00:03:58.380> necessary<00:03:58.890> on<00:03:58.980> that<00:03:59.190> part<00:03:59.430> though

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
only if necessary on that part though

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:00.650 
only if necessary on that part though
that<00:03:59.910> there<00:04:00.240> you<00:04:00.330> go

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
that there you go

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.200 
that there you go
cover<00:04:01.530> it<00:04:01.680> up<00:04:01.770> very<00:04:01.980> nicely<00:04:02.250> remember<00:04:02.880> my

cover it up very nicely remember my

cover it up very nicely remember my
black<00:04:03.570> friend<00:04:03.900> is<00:04:04.020> bleeding<00:04:04.380> through<00:04:04.650> but

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
black friend is bleeding through but

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.340 
black friend is bleeding through but
