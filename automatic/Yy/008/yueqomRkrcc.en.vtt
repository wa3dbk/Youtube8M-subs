 they decide to put words to the world that one has 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:34.360
 in my head when I write taxes I just feel where I am

 then finish 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.180
 to guess the final words 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:45.930
 that topic 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.550
 I hope to overcome in execution that is the space in general that exceeds in person 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.820
 this event counts 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.820
 it is the most 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.570
 while pleasant but I'm going to tell you something very important when you turn on the 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:04.470
 computer I feel while they come with me to spread it installs itself 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.360
 so that they have been installed in front of the screen and when it's going to end I have 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.820
 a gesture 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.870

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.050
 same interpreting the successes mitigate the symptoms 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.830
 we have entered into sirte I had to 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.620
 as a book starts to be generated in the fact that it is simply comedy treated 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:55.260
 in a way to think like a boy to see what I like to have drawn that I 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.090
 I would like to have written
