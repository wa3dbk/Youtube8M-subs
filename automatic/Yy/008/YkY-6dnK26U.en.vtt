thicker barrel here and it'll be okay

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.280 
thicker barrel here and it'll be okay
microphone<00:02:11.340> ports<00:02:11.730> still<00:02:12.060> there<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:13.080> back

side<00:02:18.360> that<00:02:18.390> did<00:02:18.690> something<00:02:19.050> different<00:02:19.200> this

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
side that did something different this

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.030 
side that did something different this
time<00:02:19.560> last<00:02:20.520> time<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:21.240> case<00:02:22.050> covered<00:02:22.650> all<00:02:22.860> the

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
time last time the case covered all the

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.740 
time last time the case covered all the
buttons<00:02:23.630> this<00:02:24.630> time<00:02:24.900> they<00:02:25.080> left<00:02:25.260> them<00:02:25.440> exposed

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
buttons this time they left them exposed

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.970 
buttons this time they left them exposed
probably<00:02:27.750> due<00:02:27.870> to<00:02:27.900> the<00:02:28.140> harder<00:02:28.410> material<00:02:28.920> used

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
probably due to the harder material used

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.199 
probably due to the harder material used
the<00:02:31.980> buttons<00:02:32.370> though<00:02:32.610> they're<00:02:32.850> still<00:02:33.090> very

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209

thing<00:02:44.160> to<00:02:44.340> notice<00:02:44.750> just<00:02:45.750> like<00:02:46.019> the<00:02:46.200> last<00:02:46.350> model

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
the case does not reach up far enough to

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.580 
the case does not reach up far enough to
prevent<00:02:50.670> the<00:02:51.180> screen<00:02:51.959> from<00:02:52.110> touching<00:02:52.440> the
