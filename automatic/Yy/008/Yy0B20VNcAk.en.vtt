00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
12 3 2012 and that happens to be the

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.420 
12 3 2012 and that happens to be the
exact<00:03:16.720> number<00:03:17.019> of<00:03:17.080> years<00:03:17.319> any<00:03:17.709> progression<00:03:18.190> of

exact number of years any progression of
the<00:03:18.549> equinox<00:03:19.030> found<00:03:20.019> it<00:03:20.140> interesting<00:03:20.440> but<00:03:21.360> I

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
the equinox found it interesting but I

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.509 
the equinox found it interesting but I
also<00:03:22.660> would<00:03:22.989> understand<00:03:23.590> I<00:03:23.860> think<00:03:24.250> there<00:03:24.400> is

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
also would understand I think there is

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:27.090 
also would understand I think there is
not<00:03:25.299> necessarily<00:03:26.230> this<00:03:26.470> is<00:03:26.590> not<00:03:26.739> a<00:03:26.769> conspiracy

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
not necessarily this is not a conspiracy

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.640 
not necessarily this is not a conspiracy
theory<00:03:27.820> I<00:03:27.970> think<00:03:28.600> there<00:03:28.900> are<00:03:28.930> powerful<00:03:29.380> people

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
theory I think there are powerful people

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.470 
theory I think there are powerful people
in<00:03:30.040> the<00:03:30.160> world<00:03:30.340> that<00:03:30.790> believe<00:03:31.269> these

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
in the world that believe these

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.620 
in the world that believe these
astrological<00:03:32.370> dates<00:03:33.370> have<00:03:33.670> significance<00:03:34.450> at

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
astrological dates have significance at

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.990 
astrological dates have significance at
least<00:03:34.870> to<00:03:35.019> them<00:03:35.200> and<00:03:35.470> it<00:03:36.160> will<00:03:36.310> plan<00:03:36.579> events

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
least to them and it will plan events

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.840 
least to them and it will plan events
and<00:03:37.299> cause<00:03:37.750> events<00:03:38.260> to<00:03:38.380> happen<00:03:38.560> around<00:03:39.340> these

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
and cause events to happen around these

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.569 
and cause events to happen around these
astrological<00:03:40.450> dates<00:03:40.989> because<00:03:41.829> they<00:03:42.190> believe

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:42.579 
astrological dates because they believe

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:46.140 
astrological dates because they believe
it<00:03:43.269> gives<00:03:43.450> it<00:03:43.570> more<00:03:43.750> power<00:03:44.019> I<00:03:44.609> you<00:03:45.609> know<00:03:45.760> and<00:03:46.090> I

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
it gives it more power I you know and I

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:47.610 
it gives it more power I you know and I
don't<00:03:46.329> want<00:03:46.480> people<00:03:46.750> reading<00:03:46.930> into<00:03:47.350> every

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
don't want people reading into every

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.170 
don't want people reading into every
freakin<00:03:48.040> date<00:03:48.250> that's<00:03:48.519> out<00:03:48.760> there<00:03:49.000> because

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
freakin date that's out there because

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.420 
freakin date that's out there because
there<00:03:49.600> is<00:03:49.750> definitely<00:03:50.380> a<00:03:50.470> lot<00:03:50.620> of<00:03:50.799> excessive

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
there is definitely a lot of excessive

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.120 
there is definitely a lot of excessive
reading<00:03:51.760> into<00:03:52.000> every<00:03:52.420> rumor<00:03:52.780> out<00:03:52.840> there<00:03:53.130> but

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 
reading into every rumor out there but

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.580 
reading into every rumor out there but
this<00:03:54.880> is<00:03:55.030> highly<00:03:55.450> interesting<00:03:55.930> that<00:03:56.079> he<00:03:56.230> said

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
this is highly interesting that he said

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.289 
this is highly interesting that he said
this<00:03:56.829> and<00:03:57.130> I<00:03:57.280> don't<00:03:57.459> think<00:03:57.549> it<00:03:57.700> was<00:03:57.760> a<00:03:57.850> slip-up

00:03:58.289 --> 00:03:58.299 
this and I don't think it was a slip-up

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:01.050 
this and I don't think it was a slip-up
i<00:03:58.690> think<00:03:58.959> it<00:03:59.049> was<00:03:59.140> like<00:03:59.200> a<00:03:59.350> deliberate<00:04:00.060> cute

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
i think it was like a deliberate cute

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.199 
i think it was like a deliberate cute
way<00:04:01.239> of<00:04:01.480> leaking<00:04:01.989> some<00:04:02.230> information<00:04:03.209> causing

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209 
way of leaking some information causing

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:06.539 
way of leaking some information causing
some<00:04:04.480> speculation<00:04:05.410> about<00:04:05.620> aliens<00:04:06.160> it<00:04:06.370> may<00:04:06.489> be

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:06.549 
some speculation about aliens it may be

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:09.990 
some speculation about aliens it may be
some<00:04:06.790> crazy<00:04:07.209> thing<00:04:07.630> maybe<00:04:08.440> plant<00:04:08.950> for<00:04:09.760> the<00:04:09.850> end

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
some crazy thing maybe plant for the end

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.060 
some crazy thing maybe plant for the end
of<00:04:10.120> the<00:04:10.209> year<00:04:10.359> I<00:04:10.540> remember<00:04:11.320> Lindsey<00:04:11.799> Williams

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:27.100 
happen at the end of the year because I

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:29.700 
happen at the end of the year because I
think<00:06:27.160> if<00:06:27.490> something<00:06:27.729> does<00:06:28.180> happen<00:06:28.710> I'm

man-made and there's going to be a

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:38.760 
man-made and there's going to be a
policy<00:06:35.500> and<00:06:35.770> an<00:06:35.830> agenda<00:06:36.340> behind<00:06:36.520> it<00:06:37.140> like<00:06:38.140> one

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:38.770 
policy and an agenda behind it like one
