00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:08.069
 to surprise

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.329
 Dress your dolls to their dolls, well, well, 

00:00:14.329 --> 00:00:16.880
 Some people are dedicated to paying for an inn 0

 everything possible so that your pets go to the last 

00:00:20.659 --> 00:00:24.229
 If we are going to see fashion for dogs and good morning tasty tell us 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:31.320

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.970
 and state are showing me right now is 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:35.750
 one chandal 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.040
 a puppy look how nice or for example maybe it's cold and we want 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.040
 put a coat on it then what we do 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.530
 coat is getting easier or better little by little 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.930
 er is that easier for the owners of the dimensions 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.270
 to be able to dress their fashionable pets as they may not like the 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.140
 fashion they went to the moratorium of the tuna that is more ballan to the default and 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.610
 this morning I'm going to talk to Maria Gabriela Bolos Bianco side on animals 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.070
 we had waited here a lot a manager of them I do not know why 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.190
 example these shirts and we'll even see how it works because we're already 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.350
 seeing here some of the ere pups that do not improvise here also a 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.760
 catwalk like the one that was recently held ee in hotel tokyo that 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:26.620
 you said not the pet fashion week there in Tokyo for a hundred 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.790
 things are fashionable unless they are offered and sixth exactly 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.150
 we appreciate the possibility that 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.820
 percent those people who seek 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.570
 in adedy clothing complement they can find for their pets 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.040
 percent 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.470
 garments that go far beyond functionality 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.560
 and what in addition to the functional part that has a country garment 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.820
 He is complemented with fashion 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.180
 for example how the sequel comes out not a little bit of the models that we are 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.250
 watching for example is air this is an actress a skirt in quito is a 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.850
 Scottish skirt that comes with its roads with their bob marley pineapples 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.560
 or with skulls 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.990
 ideas very small and other models that have insulted us with those pressures of 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:14.159
 tamino points to sync 

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:15.149
 is 

00:02:15.149 --> 00:02:20.279
 T-shirt in total eleven bob marley followers exact, we have 

00:02:20.279 --> 00:02:23.439
 very many the possibility of sweatshirts 

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:26.529
 cowboy jackets dressed in rocan 

00:02:26.529 --> 00:02:31.639
 by the way sandals to do sport of shelter for the snow we saw by 

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:35.949
 example this set of roads seemed choli but very casual for not 

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:39.459
 I know if to say water followed good percent indeed this we are showing 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:44.260
 Our public collection is the darkest banahan bq casual collection 

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:47.789
 You can also find it in the stores of peta parte arpa quieran 

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:48.609
 Madrid 

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:52.769
 and I'm complete for examples a whole with a batik print 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:56.130
 by the way apart down 3 eva that was 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.210
 and that is very cute not only in puppies that are of small race 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.360
 but we work up to rates bigger clear because I want to ask 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.220
 for example the experts we have 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.350
 They are tiny here but this happens as with people who 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:11.179
 sizes 

00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:15.539
 we work in the case of this urban collection 

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:17.669
 from 1 to 6 

00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:22.789
 in the tiny size that we saw was a rate one is perfect as for a 

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:23.789
 chiguagua 

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:28.559
 but it is clear that the rate is perfect for a flirtatious 

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:32.590
 dogs of breed this small little one immediately 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.999
 and what we seek above all is percent 

00:03:35.999 --> 00:03:40.590
 to be able to offer consumers who love animal lovers 

00:03:40.589 --> 00:03:42.519
 the possibility that 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:46.749
 besides him having a functional garment for his pet because 

00:03:46.749 --> 00:03:50.900
 cent is researching fashion that are dressed in flight fashion 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.300
 surely there will be three fishermen at home who wrote 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:57.210
 how much it costs us so much we have to be to take our little dog to the 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:01.050
 You will not answer me now, we will come back in a little while if we go to 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:05.380
