00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:11.519
 led by the Bertelli family the great 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:15.210
 industrial enterprise was inaugurated 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:17.730
 with 5 thousand meters of constructed area 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.160
 sorolla that the milk and whey industry in 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.689
 powder will generate about 100 jobs 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.689
 direct 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:28.140
 operating 24 hours a day 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:31.679
 the product produced here is intended for 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:35.100
 industrial use will supply 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.989
 all over Brazil and even outside the country and 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.730
 I believe it is an enterprise that 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.100
 much represents for our 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.350
 county to our state 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.000
 only the presence of the authorities here 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.190
 representative of the ministry of 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.760
 agriculture thinks it is already consolidating 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.940
 sure what does this mean for the 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.309
 our municipality is going to be an increase 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.920
 in the economy is a raw material that 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.899
 was being thrown out it will be 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.049
 used in addition to solving a 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.220
 environmental problem will generate is a 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.979
 economic movement 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.740
 the whey powder obtained by means of the 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.880
 whey released in the manufacture of 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.580
 cheese 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.970
 is firstly concentrated together 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.680
 evaporation and spray drying in 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.110
 drying chamber 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.439
 besides the economic and generation benefit 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:28.140
 of jobs in rochester 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.369
 will have a positive impact on the environment 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.250
 environment 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.920
 because it will process the serum of the 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.560
 milk a by-product of cheese 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.439
 usually discarded that will be 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.470
 processed into whey 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:46.619
 before it was discarded now here it is 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.950
 raw material a daily production of 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:52.170
 approximately 25 tonnes 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.960
 several authorities were present 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.570
 on the opening ceremony of the 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.070
 your pride to rondonia venture 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.200
 pride for rolim de moura our 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.759
 earth I had the privilege to have been 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.159
 prefect for two terms 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.000
 accompany the beginning of the Mariela industry 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.899
 Today she will 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.810
 is the milk of the mozzarella cheese da da 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:16.180
 now butter for the milk powder for the 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.700
 whey powder not only for rondÃ´nia to 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.590
 all brazil who knows even out in the 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.630
 our chest and it's an important moment 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.850
 for us only to roaim from Moorish to 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.700
 rondÃ´nia and for the whole country the aggregation 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.470
 of value and generation of employment generation of 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.209
 income is part of the policy 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.560
 implemented by the federal government 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.200
 Ministry of Agriculture which has a 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.780
 harvest plan that begins with the 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.600
 extraordinary content just to 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.700
 production is increasingly feasible. 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.980
 first a satisfaction to be here one 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.890
 state as promising as 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.200
 this is not just 100 jobs 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.680
 that I had the opportunity to see I see 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:56.080
 here without jobs that are in the industry 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:58.030
 but they reflect the 2,000 producers of 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.670
 milk making this gear 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:03.459
 so I think that today the 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:06.790
 people sees an example as an example of 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:09.010
 government participation organization 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.290
 federal government participation 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.420
 state and here too the government 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.519
 municipal here of rolim de moura 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.400
 showing that it is adding efforts 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:19.660
 dividing our responsibilities 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.630
 What are we going to inaugurate? 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:26.110
 with which the company is 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:30.400
 located at r 10 10 corner with the 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:33.160
 line 196 to about 13 kilometers from 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:38.049
 center of rolim of moura to sorolla that 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:40.470
 will produce up to 420,000 liters of serum per 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:40.470
 day
