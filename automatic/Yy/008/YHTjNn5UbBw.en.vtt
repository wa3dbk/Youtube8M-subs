00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.499
 Good morning everyone and it was time and 

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:04.970
 welcome to one more video from my channel 

00:00:03.499 --> 00:00:07.370
 good guys today I think you're going to 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:08.900
 listen a little better and I have something 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.539
 what to tell or is just reading already 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:14.450
 in the title of never give up and it's 

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:16.010
 because I said good ago in the last 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.590
 videoblog that was called folk I do not 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.000
 It has up here where you want 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:23.000
 I said that I was going to present the theorist 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.920
 sorry to the driver and it was the 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.870
 third time I introduced myself and good 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.850
 as it was already lens are reading in the 

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:31.520
 title is that you never give up and it 's 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:34.220
 because he suspends, he stopped again and 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.290
 wrote three times and the truth is that 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.030
 I shit on the queue it's like I'm already 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.400
 that's work I do not know why 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.840
 I would assume it's like I know well in 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.140
 class but then it's time for the 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.480
 exam and it paralyzed me and I shit on 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.790
 everything that wiggles and fails 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.800
 I had two clear mistakes and they kicked me out 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.350
 backwards he suspended so he could not 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.820
 do practically nothing and well then 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.000
 that makes you never give up is because 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.469
 although his pains and his clothes if 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.140
 you want and want to reach a goal 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:05.810
 guys, you never give up 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.270
 is from today's council in which 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.760
 although there are many people who tell you leave 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.710
 this leaves this leave this if you have faith 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.320
 what are you going to try or do you have faith in 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.600
 get to XE goal you never give up 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.430
 that many people told me when I started 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.619
 in Youtube 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.670
 here he did not earn money or anything for 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:24.710
 the style 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.000
 I made videos because I liked it because 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.520
 I wanted to make videos because I wanted to 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.460
 transmit to someone and have I do not know 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.290
 that someone saw my videos and think I know 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.940
 what I'm talking about, such and such and 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.890
 it's true that many people told me 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.930
 let him leave that that was a waste of 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.390
 time you have nothing to do here 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.710
 on YouTube and well, it's like those 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.960
 people who are telling me that 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.850
 Now I send you my regards and I tell you that 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.310
 yes yes I had something to say on youtube 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.619
 because right now I have more than 100 thousand 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.700
 subscribers thing that is not much between 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:54.380
 quotes because there are many people who 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.479
 it is much safer to do the 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.090
 night many since it has many more 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:01.429
 but here I am with 100,000 and already 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.750
 least this from my point of view from 

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:04.310
 my only point of view this has not been 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.600
 for nothing is a failure or has indeed 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.490
 been one of the best things that has 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.630
 done in my life start a channel in 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.340
 Youtube 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.710
 three years ago many people told me that 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.430
 I would back down and I did not give up and 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:17.180
 I'm here 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.170
 the same thing happened to me with taking out that 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.490
 and the baccalaureate 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.260
 we remember that I took two years 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.270
 sabbatical first of the 2nd of the is 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.040
 a first serious just pass it because 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.330
 then the September I said good I'm going to 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.950
 put to study a little but already 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.480
 second and it makes a little bit impossible for me 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.090
 They were not know how many were me 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.760
 they were nine or so and as I say a year 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.830
 total sabbatical and there I did repeat a lot 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.200
 people told me to leave it that was going to 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.090
 repeat one will give that and will go back to 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.590
 repeat second and will repeat third and 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.600
 after fourth and after that it's not going to 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.100
 never take out the graduate and it has been 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.230
 second era is the only year in which I've 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.810
 repeated because then I put the batteries 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.910
 and that clear then the whole first so much 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.250
 according to tempera of that fourth first of 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.690
 baccalaureate and second baccalaureate 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.240
 and I say if you believe you 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:02.030
 os same even if people 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:04.400
 try there are toxic people so 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:07.190
 say that they try to throw back 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.080
 in your dreams as I say my dream 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.940
 right now my dream in quotes or my 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.680
 goal so to speak is to get me the 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.330
 practical because of course 2000 already after 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.660
 supposes it three times or even 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.790
 when suspended 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.680
 my mother, I have to renew 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.850
 papers is a lot of money more and 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.700
 I may resubmit the 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:25.800
 next exam I introduce myself suits me 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.210
 introduce myself again to go back to 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.150
 surprise and spend a pasture again 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:32.010
 or I do not show up and leave it for another day 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.950
 another year when you have more desire to 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.690
 get my license not only do not have 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.730
 what do you have to do 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.400
 whenever you can try though 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.650
 again suspend always we go that no 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.910
 you give up so it's the same 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.100
 message that I want to convey to us 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.990
 you even if you lean against the wall 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:51.240
 the wall is the wall in the wall 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:54.060
 some day that wall will be transferred and 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:56.160
 one day you will achieve your own goal 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.680
 so I am your own 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.240
 limit I am my limit of it and you 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.190
 you are the limit of yourself and there is no 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.080
 nobody to tell you the limits that you 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.660
