00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
right well what I think we need to do is

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.840 
right well what I think we need to do is
to<00:00:52.650> focus<00:00:52.949> on<00:00:53.040> the<00:00:53.100> ceiling<00:00:53.370> of<00:00:53.460> course<00:00:53.670> and

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
to focus on the ceiling of course and

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.030 
to focus on the ceiling of course and
bring<00:00:54.449> that<00:00:54.629> up<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:54.960> date<00:00:55.140> by<00:00:55.379> getting<00:00:55.890> rid<00:00:56.010> of

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:56.040 
bring that up to date by getting rid of

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.469 
bring that up to date by getting rid of
the<00:00:56.159> big<00:00:56.309> rectangles<00:00:56.909> and<00:00:57.000> changing<00:00:57.299> them<00:00:57.390> out

00:00:57.469 --> 00:00:57.479 
the big rectangles and changing them out

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:58.969 
the big rectangles and changing them out
for<00:00:57.690> two<00:00:57.780> by<00:00:57.900> two<00:00:57.960> squares<00:00:58.379> okay<00:00:58.680> that's

00:00:58.969 --> 00:00:58.979 
for two by two squares okay that's

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:00.500 
for two by two squares okay that's
something<00:00:59.070> we<00:00:59.309> can<00:00:59.460> do<00:00:59.549> ourselves<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.269> I<00:01:00.360> also

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
something we can do ourselves and I also

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:01.969 
something we can do ourselves and I also
think<00:01:00.780> we<00:01:00.839> should<00:01:00.989> bring<00:01:01.140> in<00:01:01.260> new<00:01:01.409> tiles<00:01:01.860> that

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:01.979 
think we should bring in new tiles that

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:03.079 
think we should bring in new tiles that
are<00:01:02.040> a<00:01:02.129> little<00:01:02.220> more<00:01:02.309> contemporary<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:03.000> I

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:03.089 
are a little more contemporary and I

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:04.399 
are a little more contemporary and I
think<00:01:03.299> that's<00:01:03.479> gonna<00:01:03.659> be<00:01:03.930> a<00:01:04.199> better

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
think that's gonna be a better

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:05.600 
think that's gonna be a better
compliment<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:05.010> everything<00:01:05.339> else<00:01:05.489> you've

that<00:01:31.160> is<00:01:31.340> where<00:01:31.490> a<00:01:31.520> crosstie<00:01:32.030> comes<00:01:32.270> in<00:01:32.450> you

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:32.870 
that is where a crosstie comes in you

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.290 
that is where a crosstie comes in you
know<00:01:33.020> now<00:01:33.680> a<00:01:33.710> crosstie<00:01:34.220> simply<00:01:34.850> turns<00:01:35.120> the

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:35.300 
know now a crosstie simply turns the

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.360 
know now a crosstie simply turns the
huge<00:01:35.510> rectangle<00:01:36.020> into<00:01:36.410> two<00:01:36.440> smaller<00:01:37.130> sized

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:37.370 
huge rectangle into two smaller sized

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.130 
huge rectangle into two smaller sized
squares<00:01:37.580> and<00:01:37.970> to<00:01:38.450> put<00:01:38.600> it<00:01:38.690> up<00:01:38.780> we<00:01:38.840> just<00:01:38.900> have<00:01:39.080> to

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
squares and to put it up we just have to

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.870 
squares and to put it up we just have to
put<00:01:39.290> it<00:01:39.350> up<00:01:39.380> in<00:01:39.470> the<00:01:39.530> middle<00:01:39.620> mm-hmm<00:01:40.310> attach<00:01:40.670> it

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
put it up in the middle mm-hmm attach it

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.370 
put it up in the middle mm-hmm attach it
literally<00:01:41.060> drop<00:01:41.330> it<00:01:41.480> in<00:01:41.600> like<00:01:41.720> that<00:01:41.840> and<00:01:42.260> then

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
literally drop it in like that and then

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.350 
literally drop it in like that and then
after<00:01:42.500> that<00:01:42.620> we<00:01:42.800> put<00:01:42.920> it<00:01:43.010> under<00:01:43.190> tiles<00:01:43.490> nice<00:01:44.090> so

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
after that we put it under tiles nice so

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.430 
after that we put it under tiles nice so
that's<00:01:44.480> easy<00:01:44.720> very<00:01:45.230> easy<00:01:45.350> okay<00:01:47.230> and<00:01:48.230> then<00:01:48.350> what

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
are we gonna put in there well the first

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.760 
are we gonna put in there well the first
option<00:01:50.360> I<00:01:50.420> have<00:01:50.540> here<00:01:50.750> is<00:01:50.870> single<00:01:51.170> raised<00:01:51.500> and

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
option I have here is single raised and

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.720 
option I have here is single raised and
raised<00:01:52.130> panel<00:01:52.580> now<00:01:53.240> these<00:01:54.220> you<00:01:55.220> can<00:01:55.340> customize

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:55.730 
raised panel now these you can customize

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
raised panel now these you can customize
these<00:01:55.850> because<00:01:56.060> they<00:01:56.180> could<00:01:56.300> be<00:01:56.390> painted<00:01:56.600> or

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
these because they could be painted or

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.090 
these because they could be painted or
they<00:01:56.900> can<00:01:56.990> go<00:01:57.080> up<00:01:57.200> white<00:01:57.410> I<00:01:57.590> happen<00:01:57.860> to<00:01:57.890> love

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
they can go up white I happen to love

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.170 
they can go up white I happen to love
the<00:01:58.250> white<00:01:58.400> and<00:01:58.640> I<00:01:58.730> think<00:01:58.910> the<00:01:59.000> white<00:01:59.150> is

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
the white and I think the white is

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.420 
the white and I think the white is
perfect<00:01:59.630> for<00:01:59.750> this<00:01:59.840> space<00:02:00.140> and<00:02:00.470> these<00:02:01.250> were

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
perfect for this space and these were

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:02.920 
perfect for this space and these were
treated<00:02:01.640> with<00:02:01.880> something<00:02:02.090> called<00:02:02.300> bio<00:02:02.570> block

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
treated with something called bio block

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.810 
treated with something called bio block
it's<00:02:03.110> antimicrobial<00:02:03.500> in<00:02:04.040> its<00:02:04.130> anti-odor

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
it's antimicrobial in its anti-odor

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.940 
it's antimicrobial in its anti-odor
and<00:02:05.000> it's<00:02:05.360> also<00:02:05.630> anti<00:02:05.960> mildew<00:02:06.350> bacteria<00:02:06.470> so

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
and it's also anti mildew bacteria so

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.530 
and it's also anti mildew bacteria so
these<00:02:07.340> are<00:02:07.490> excellent<00:02:07.850> especially<00:02:08.179> in<00:02:08.510> a

okay pretty easy right one down okay and
now<00:03:16.340> if<00:03:16.430> you<00:03:16.519> stay<00:03:16.670> right<00:03:16.820> there<00:03:16.880> step<00:03:17.360> two<00:03:17.660> is

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
now if you stay right there step two is

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.250 
now if you stay right there step two is
the<00:03:18.920> cross<00:03:19.130> T<00:03:19.400> in<00:03:20.269> the<00:03:20.480> cross<00:03:20.660> he<00:03:20.870> just<00:03:21.080> goes

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
the cross T in the cross he just goes

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:22.900 
the cross T in the cross he just goes
into<00:03:21.709> the<00:03:21.800> middle<00:03:21.980> and<00:03:22.070> snap<00:03:22.459> it<00:03:22.640> into<00:03:22.790> place

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
into the middle and snap it into place

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.680 
into the middle and snap it into place
with<00:03:23.120> the<00:03:23.510> side<00:03:23.720> all<00:03:24.050> right

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
with the side all right

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.600 
with the side all right
it<00:03:25.560> goes<00:03:25.740> in<00:03:25.950> the<00:03:26.010> middle<00:03:26.070> of<00:03:26.400> the<00:03:26.490> rectangle

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
it goes in the middle of the rectangle

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.850 
it goes in the middle of the rectangle
and<00:03:27.240> in<00:03:27.600> a<00:03:27.660> little<00:03:27.840> tab<00:03:28.050> side<00:03:28.410> there<00:03:28.680> you<00:03:28.770> go

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
and in a little tab side there you go

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.230 
and in a little tab side there you go
little<00:03:29.130> tab<00:03:29.460> slide<00:03:29.790> into<00:03:30.090> the<00:03:30.350> ends<00:03:32.240> okay

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:33.240 
little tab slide into the ends okay

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.890 
little tab slide into the ends okay
great

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
great

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.780 
great
step<00:03:34.500> three<00:03:34.800> is<00:03:35.120> to<00:03:36.120> nest<00:03:36.450> the<00:03:36.840> tile<00:03:37.170> into<00:03:37.790> the

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
step three is to nest the tile into the

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.440 
step three is to nest the tile into the
open<00:03:39.120> square<00:03:39.300> area<00:03:39.690> you<00:03:40.290> go<00:03:40.440> up<00:03:40.590> on<00:03:40.740> an<00:03:40.830> angle

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
open square area you go up on an angle

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.060 
open square area you go up on an angle
you're<00:03:42.450> already<00:03:42.630> a<00:03:42.720> pro<00:03:42.930> look<00:03:43.080> at<00:03:43.200> that<00:03:43.350> it's

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
you're already a pro look at that it's

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.950 
you're already a pro look at that it's
just<00:03:44.220> so<00:03:44.370> easy

Vanessa until it's it's perfect ah and
there<00:03:47.730> you<00:03:47.820> go<00:03:47.940> one<00:03:48.090> down<00:03:48.680> okay<00:03:49.680> here's<00:03:49.890> the

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
there you go one down okay here's the

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.860 
there you go one down okay here's the

next one and if you notice already the
grid<00:03:52.140> blending<00:03:52.500> technique<00:03:52.890> is<00:03:53.010> working

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
grid blending technique is working

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.280 
grid blending technique is working
because<00:03:53.790> all<00:03:54.090> we're<00:03:54.240> really<00:03:54.420> noticing<00:03:54.870> you're
