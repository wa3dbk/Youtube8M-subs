00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:54.490 
even dish out to the super spy is that

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:56.640 
even dish out to the super spy is that
it<00:06:54.580> can<00:06:54.789> get<00:06:55.030> pretty<00:06:55.090> repetitive<00:06:55.840> at<00:06:56.259> times

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:56.650 
it can get pretty repetitive at times

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:58.890 
it can get pretty repetitive at times
but<00:06:57.370> that's<00:06:57.520> usually<00:06:58.210> only<00:06:58.419> when<00:06:58.720> you're

00:06:58.890 --> 00:06:58.900 
but that's usually only when you're

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:01.170 
but that's usually only when you're
stuck<00:06:59.380> trying<00:06:59.770> to<00:06:59.949> find<00:07:00.250> your<00:07:00.460> way<00:07:00.639> through<00:07:01.000> an

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:01.180 
stuck trying to find your way through an

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:03.480 
stuck trying to find your way through an
area<00:07:01.389> and<00:07:01.720> having<00:07:02.289> to<00:07:02.380> go<00:07:02.530> back<00:07:02.830> and<00:07:02.860> forth<00:07:03.310> and

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:03.490 
area and having to go back and forth and

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:04.980 
area and having to go back and forth and
fight<00:07:03.639> the<00:07:03.819> same<00:07:04.030> enemies<00:07:04.389> over<00:07:04.780> and<00:07:04.900> over

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:04.990 
fight the same enemies over and over

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:07.469 
fight the same enemies over and over
again<00:07:05.169> the<00:07:06.009> good<00:07:06.160> news<00:07:06.340> is<00:07:06.370> that<00:07:06.849> the<00:07:07.030> combat

00:07:07.469 --> 00:07:07.479 
again the good news is that the combat

00:07:07.479 --> 00:07:10.140 
again the good news is that the combat
in<00:07:07.630> the<00:07:07.750> game<00:07:07.960> is<00:07:08.199> fun<00:07:08.770> so<00:07:09.340> even<00:07:09.729> being

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:10.150 
in the game is fun so even being

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:12.450 
in the game is fun so even being
repetitive<00:07:10.660> at<00:07:11.020> least<00:07:11.229> it's<00:07:11.500> repetitive<00:07:12.069> and

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:12.460 
repetitive at least it's repetitive and

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:14.400 
repetitive at least it's repetitive and
fun<00:07:12.819> at<00:07:13.000> the<00:07:13.030> same<00:07:13.120> time<00:07:13.569> and<00:07:13.900> you're<00:07:14.380> not

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:14.410 
fun at the same time and you're not

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:16.260 
fun at the same time and you're not
having<00:07:14.740> to<00:07:15.009> do<00:07:15.130> things<00:07:15.370> you<00:07:15.520> don't<00:07:15.580> want<00:07:15.910> to<00:07:16.150> do

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:16.270 
having to do things you don't want to do

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:23.070 
having to do things you don't want to do
over<00:07:16.750> and<00:07:16.840> over<00:07:16.960> again<00:07:17.199> I<00:07:21.750> would<00:07:22.750> comfortably

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:23.080 
over and over again I would comfortably

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.050 
over and over again I would comfortably
recommend<00:07:23.740> the<00:07:23.830> super<00:07:24.160> spy<00:07:24.340> to<00:07:24.400> anybody<00:07:24.849> with

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:25.060 
recommend the super spy to anybody with

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:27.960 
recommend the super spy to anybody with
a<00:07:25.240> neo<00:07:25.630> CD<00:07:26.050> or<00:07:26.380> even<00:07:26.889> a<00:07:26.949> regular<00:07:27.280> Neo<00:07:27.490> Geo<00:07:27.580> for

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:27.970 
a neo CD or even a regular Neo Geo for

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:30.270 
a neo CD or even a regular Neo Geo for
that<00:07:28.090> matter<00:07:28.360> it's<00:07:28.990> a<00:07:29.139> really<00:07:29.289> fun<00:07:29.440> game<00:07:29.949> and

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:30.280 
that matter it's a really fun game and

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:32.189 
that matter it's a really fun game and
again<00:07:30.759> is<00:07:30.970> entirely<00:07:31.389> different<00:07:31.840> than<00:07:31.960> a<00:07:31.990> lot

00:07:32.189 --> 00:07:32.199 
again is entirely different than a lot

00:07:32.199 --> 00:07:34.800 
again is entirely different than a lot
of<00:07:32.259> the<00:07:32.410> other<00:07:32.590> stuff<00:07:32.860> on<00:07:33.070> the<00:07:33.400> Neo<00:07:33.550> Geo<00:07:33.669> and<00:07:34.240> it

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:34.810 
of the other stuff on the Neo Geo and it

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:37.379 
of the other stuff on the Neo Geo and it
really<00:07:34.990> stands<00:07:35.500> out<00:07:35.800> its<00:07:36.460> availability<00:07:37.000> can

00:07:37.379 --> 00:07:37.389 
really stands out its availability can

00:07:37.389 --> 00:07:40.469 
really stands out its availability can
be<00:07:37.509> kinda<00:07:38.050> tricky<00:07:38.080> especially<00:07:38.830> on<00:07:39.580> the<00:07:39.729> CD<00:07:40.150> for

00:07:40.469 --> 00:07:40.479 
be kinda tricky especially on the CD for

00:07:40.479 --> 00:07:42.300 
be kinda tricky especially on the CD for
some<00:07:40.659> reason<00:07:40.990> it<00:07:41.139> took<00:07:41.289> me<00:07:41.470> forever<00:07:41.710> to<00:07:41.889> find<00:07:42.159> a

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:42.310 
some reason it took me forever to find a

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:44.730 
some reason it took me forever to find a
copy<00:07:42.490> of<00:07:42.669> the<00:07:42.820> game<00:07:42.970> and<00:07:43.180> it's<00:07:44.020> not<00:07:44.349> overly

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:44.740 
copy of the game and it's not overly

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:48.680 
copy of the game and it's not overly
cheap<00:07:45.130> either<00:07:45.370> but<00:07:45.789> it<00:07:45.880> is<00:07:46.060> worth<00:07:46.360> picking<00:07:46.720> up

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:48.690 
cheap either but it is worth picking up

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:52.559 
cheap either but it is worth picking up
as<00:07:50.610> always<00:07:51.610> guys<00:07:51.819> would<00:07:52.030> like<00:07:52.150> to<00:07:52.210> thank<00:07:52.449> each
