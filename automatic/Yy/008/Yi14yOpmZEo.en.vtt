00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.470

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:33.019
 from home using a computer from a 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.409
 home studio called a studio 

00:00:33.019 --> 00:00:38.719

00:00:36.409 --> 00:00:40.879
 models and that people listen to him and such 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:42.409
 Well, as far as I'm aware of that 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:44.239
 people because I started to climb too 

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:46.190
 start making my own music my 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:47.690
 own rap for what that requires me 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.960
 people is that you think you have to have 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:53.450
 a great team but I want 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.940
 share the link here 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.770
 even face on which I upload my music to 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.350
 that you see that it has a very high quality 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.810
 good and I'm using a very material 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.600
 low and very economical well I wanted to 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:07.850
 show them the first thing that I use here in my 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.270
 study does not have as you see has a 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:13.850
 microphone that does not have any booth 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:16.430
 no cabin that isolates it from the outside 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.380
 is in the same room where he recorded then 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.750
 is there has no booth 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.550
 nonsense of that style the next thing that 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.740
 I want you to see because they are the parts of 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.500
 study and as you can see I have a computer 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.740
 that cost me 400 euros at the time is 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.630
 very economical and has a ram giga 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:35.000
 has a very basic sound card and 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:38.479
 Well, I only use the sound card 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.450
 of the computer then as you see I have not 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:43.670
 I have horns or anything like that 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:47.960
 only I use to be heard are 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:51.740
 that black base I connect with this cable 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.750
 the black base and for that base so that 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.310
 I can listen to it from her and 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.900
 listen to how the songs are going 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:01.100
 we went to the micro is an ugly samsung one 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.979
 It really has very good quality 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.080
 cost almost 300 euros and is a condenser 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:08.720
 usb so it is not connected to any 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.929
 mixer or to any interface 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.469
 Audio 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.530
 then goes the cable has one end 

00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:18.050
 which is the microphone 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.700
 and then it has the other end that goes 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.420
 directly to the computer card 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:25.010
 for a usb via usb then I have the 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:29.050
 bases that I'm doing with the f the 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.050
 I study and I make them with these hearing aids 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.900
 they are just us and they listen to them very well with 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:37.720
 a lot of quality but they do not have a subwoofer 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.299
 then to record here I have these 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.549
 hearing aids that they gave me these are very 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:44.590
 good are the pioneers, if they are something 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:46.510
 expensive because 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.489
 have they have their body and very good 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.040
 quality has a female students pads 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:53.620
 pretty fat to listen to us in 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:57.590
 the microphone did not hear what I'm 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:59.870
 listening here the base s key better 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.720
 they have a cable the cable of these 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:06.080
 hearing aids is a study cable that goes 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:09.620
 in gold is here this is the connector of 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:12.620
 the hearing aids go in gold and it's a cable a 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.870
 study cable then as accessories 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.700
 of microphone I asked from Germany for 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.590
 a company that is called take the 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.950
 I leave it down there because it's the company 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:24.260
 reliable cheaper than found and has 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.360
 very good quality and I bought for 50 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.060
 euros including shipping costs and went and 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.010
 everything is the payment of 50 euros for the 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:34.099
 tripod is a very good quality millennium 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.480
 the anti pop that is this is also very 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:38.269
 good quality very good has served me 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.730
 a lot and this spider that you came with 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:42.230
 spare parts is a universal spider is very 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.450
 good 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.909
 and as you can see there you can 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.310
 adjust the height and from here with this 

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:52.150
 nut and here 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:54.920
 it's a giraffe link because it can 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:57.260
 put yourself in the position you want and 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.390
 then to control the bases 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.610
 when they are finished and to go 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.230
 writing or to control the 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:05.900
 songs when they are already made 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:09.200
 I have that white and gray base that is the 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:11.299
 heredÃ© is a base is I think it's the 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.549
 most expensive equipment that I have here that I 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:16.190
 it costs about 400 good not to me but 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:17.510
 It costs about 450 euros plus or minus the use 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.150
 well to see when the songs are 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:21.620
 finished or for when a 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.050
 base to see with a little bit more of 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:26.300
 quality as it would sound and good for this 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.900
 I put it on so you know that it does not 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:31.490
 no good equipment, much less for 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:34.490
 to do big things and what if 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:36.830
 you want to do something if you want 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.509
 get something with a little bit that 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:41.509
 have if you have patience and for 

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:43.490
 then you will achieve it and therefore 

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:47.180
 so they can see who he is despite having 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:49.220
 a mediocre team or that are not very 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:52.250
 economic here is very comfortable is very 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:54.979
 economic so that they can see and check 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:58.099
 there that has its quality and has 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:05:01.340
 very good quality there I leave it I hope 

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:02.690
 that has helped them I do not know 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.160
 when to go back up but it's for a 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:07.190
