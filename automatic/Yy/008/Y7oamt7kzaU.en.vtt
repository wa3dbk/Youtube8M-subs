00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
medium term then saw become I see the

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.090 
medium term then saw become I see the
gold<00:01:36.890> struggling<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:38.250> move<00:01:38.430> higher<00:01:39.920> 1327<00:01:40.920> and

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
gold struggling to move higher 1327 and

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.700 
gold struggling to move higher 1327 and
the<00:01:41.220> 1378<00:01:42.060> so<00:01:42.899> I<00:01:42.930> think<00:01:43.170> it<00:01:43.259> will<00:01:43.409> going<00:01:43.619> to

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
the 1378 so I think it will going to

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.880 
the 1378 so I think it will going to
remain<00:01:43.979> a<00:01:44.009> range-bound<00:01:45.259> in<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.409> gold<00:01:46.619> prices

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
remain a range-bound in the gold prices

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.310 
remain a range-bound in the gold prices
and<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.159> downside<00:01:47.759> I<00:01:48.060> think<00:01:48.600> one<00:01:48.810> can<00:01:49.049> take<00:01:49.290> a

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
and the downside I think one can take a

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.560 
and the downside I think one can take a
small<00:01:49.770> buying<00:01:50.040> positions<00:01:50.729> those<00:01:51.149> who<00:01:51.329> miss

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
small buying positions those who miss

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.109 
small buying positions those who miss
the<00:01:51.780> opportunity<00:01:52.439> of<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.799> vine<00:01:53.009> they<00:01:53.729> can<00:01:53.909> buy

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
the opportunity of the vine they can buy

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.620 
the opportunity of the vine they can buy
around<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.659> between<00:01:55.579> 12<00:01:56.579> 70<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.390> a<00:01:57.450> lady

move<00:03:02.110> very<00:03:02.430> aggressively<00:03:03.430> now<00:03:04.000> I<00:03:04.330> think<00:03:04.630> the

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
move very aggressively now I think the

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.960 
move very aggressively now I think the
one<00:03:04.930> thing<00:03:04.990> i<00:03:05.440> would<00:03:05.560> like<00:03:05.800> to<00:03:06.160> mention<00:03:06.190> very

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
one thing i would like to mention very

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.870 
one thing i would like to mention very
very<00:03:07.240> clearly<00:03:07.690> that<00:03:08.020> metal<00:03:08.950> investors

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
very clearly that metal investors

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.680 
very clearly that metal investors
shouldn't<00:03:10.750> expect<00:03:11.620> go<00:03:12.310> to<00:03:12.370> move<00:03:12.760> gradually<00:03:13.120> in

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
shouldn't expect go to move gradually in

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.650 
shouldn't expect go to move gradually in
the<00:03:13.990> next<00:03:14.260> three<00:03:14.440> years<00:03:14.680> or<00:03:15.240> be<00:03:16.240> really

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
the next three years or be really

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.720 
the next three years or be really
surprised<00:03:17.140> that<00:03:17.170> the<00:03:17.500> metal<00:03:18.010> will<00:03:18.280> move<00:03:18.520> very

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
surprised that the metal will move very

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.150 
surprised that the metal will move very
aggressive<00:03:19.690> aggressively<00:03:20.500> earth<00:03:20.740> and<00:03:20.980> the

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
aggressive aggressively earth and the

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.880 
aggressive aggressively earth and the
very<00:03:21.520> aggressively<00:03:22.180> down<00:03:22.450> so<00:03:23.020> i<00:03:23.050> think<00:03:23.200> i

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
very aggressively down so i think i

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.740 
very aggressively down so i think i
think<00:03:24.580> it<00:03:24.670> will<00:03:24.820> be<00:03:24.970> a<00:03:25.000> very<00:03:25.060> interesting<00:03:25.270> time

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
think it will be a very interesting time

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.960 
think it will be a very interesting time
for<00:03:25.960> metal<00:03:26.530> and<00:03:26.770> whenever<00:03:27.190> it<00:03:27.610> is<00:03:27.640> trading

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
for metal and whenever it is trading

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.820 
for metal and whenever it is trading
sideline<00:03:28.570> it<00:03:28.840> means<00:03:29.320> that<00:03:29.500> the<00:03:29.590> most

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
sideline it means that the most

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.530 
sideline it means that the most
aggressive<00:03:30.190> move<00:03:30.550> can<00:03:30.730> come<00:03:30.940> and<00:03:31.060> gold<00:03:31.330> can

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
aggressive move can come and gold can

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.600 
aggressive move can come and gold can
move<00:03:31.720> two<00:03:32.080> to<00:03:32.260> three<00:03:32.440> hundred<00:03:32.470> dollar<00:03:32.950> alright

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
move two to three hundred dollar alright

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.310 
move two to three hundred dollar alright
