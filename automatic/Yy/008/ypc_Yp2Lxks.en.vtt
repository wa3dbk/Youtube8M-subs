00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.620
 you see what 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:56.600
 so it's simple 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:58.470
 arrived in Geneva y floats 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.840
 with my friend did not do much 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:04.320
 of motorcycles we did a few minutes 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:07.170
 will say we went back so I'm leaving this 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:11.550
 match that afternoon there he tells me I 'm leaving the 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:15.240
 fleet I'm 50 km so I'm doing well 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:19.170
 sure toll roads I'm 50 km 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:21.510
 in the mountains with the fleet at 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.860
 after a while it fed me gg activate 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.380
 the tolls so that made me do 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.920
 turn around on him makes me do it 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.989
 half turn 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:32.930
 I took a highway tournament 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:39.770
 well I suppose tolls inevitably 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:44.790
 and here and there all along 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:47.370
 Geneva up to 100 km leave the job 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:51.600
 a barrier we have the impression of arriving 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:54.900
 at 100 km from marseille earlier nada pile 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:03:00.840
 the zerg for all you're going how 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:04.620
 kilometers there are 350 km at sea between 350 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.480
 and 400 km gt under the fleet and then 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.670
 in one fell swoop more water and then I 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.000
 get closer to see more roads 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:14.040
 were beautiful and more the sun 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.250
 pierce the clouds and there we can 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:21.750
 see that there are not a lot of clouds in 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:24.120
 so to arrive it's nothing 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.799
 already when i arrived in marseille i 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.870
 arrived by a kind of ring road where 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:29.040
 I do not know what the anthem is for 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.230
 who knows I arrived by 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.090
 the west I believe or northwestern and 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:37.290
 knocked up road that unfolds 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:39.360
 suspended and me there it's six o'clock I 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.549
 summer on the island would follow gt it was 18h 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.069

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:46.530

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:48.389
 two sons luckily I was in a bike 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.590
 I passed between everyone and 

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:50.609
 Well, I'm for but between 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.010
 quotes I got the wrong exit 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:54.090
 and it happened in the bowl 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.840
 old-port I think it was the old 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:04:00.659
 port and the gps told me to alisa in a 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.639
 lane and company I followed them and 

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:04.469
 then arrived at May 20 from a pedestrian crossing 

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:06.859
 so I slow down a little bit and there I 

00:04:04.469 --> 00:04:08.790

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:12.989

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:18.060

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.310
 and at the third he advanced 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.740
 he looked at me with round eyes while 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:34.199

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.169

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:03.710

 stationed in such a situation 

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:23.500
 well it would have accelerated but a sudden 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:26.040
 of gas and I would not have passed 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.040

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:30.260
