00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:15.760 
the way let's go to unit how long we're

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.940 
the way let's go to unit how long we're
doing<00:00:15.940> fabulously

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:18.950 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:21.190

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:21.200 
it's not just about introducing yourself

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.050 
it's not just about introducing yourself
and<00:00:21.680> it's<00:00:21.800> not<00:00:21.920> just<00:00:22.040> about<00:00:22.190> discussing<00:00:22.910> the

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:27.590 
unit outline it's actually it's critical

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.020 
unit outline it's actually it's critical
to<00:00:27.680> make<00:00:27.710> that<00:00:27.980> first<00:00:28.130> impression<00:00:28.340> you'll<00:00:28.880> do

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:35.390 
set the time right there and then before

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:36.130 
set the time right there and then before
we<00:00:35.600> get<00:00:35.780> going

different to your standard lecture where

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.370 
different to your standard lecture where
you're<00:01:08.490> trying<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.729> set<00:01:08.850> expectations<00:01:09.380> you're

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
you're trying to set expectations you're

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.469 
you're trying to set expectations you're
trying<00:01:10.590> to<00:01:10.680> form<00:01:11.460> an<00:01:11.549> impression<00:01:11.940> with<00:01:12.090> them<00:01:12.330> a

trying to form an impression with them a

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.359 
trying to form an impression with them a
big<00:01:12.840> first<00:01:13.049> impression<00:01:13.200> we'll<00:01:13.979> run<00:01:14.159> through

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
big first impression we'll run through

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.010 
big first impression we'll run through
this<00:01:14.640> it's<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.270> bit<00:01:15.390> of<00:01:15.479> a<00:01:15.509> housekeeping

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
this it's a bit of a housekeeping

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.139 
this it's a bit of a housekeeping
lecture<00:01:16.320> today<00:01:16.500> unfortunately<00:01:16.710> but<00:01:17.280> we<00:01:18.000> need

00:01:18.139 --> 00:01:18.149 
lecture today unfortunately but we need

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:19.580 
lecture today unfortunately but we need
to<00:01:18.240> do<00:01:18.390> it<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:18.600> we'll<00:01:19.080> get<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:19.259> over<00:01:19.470> as

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
to do it and we'll get it over as

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.289 
to do it and we'll get it over as
painlessly<00:01:20.070> as<00:01:20.280> possible<00:01:20.310> so<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.030> elements

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
painlessly as possible so the elements

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.870 
painlessly as possible so the elements
you<00:01:21.360> need<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.570> cover<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.899> basic<00:01:22.290> I<00:01:22.950> suppose

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
you need to cover the basic I suppose

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.820 
you need to cover the basic I suppose
housekeeping<00:01:24.479> issues<00:01:24.810> so<00:01:25.080> it's<00:01:25.380> entirely<00:01:25.680> up

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
housekeeping issues so it's entirely up

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.200 
housekeeping issues so it's entirely up
to<00:01:25.920> you<00:01:26.220> whether<00:01:26.909> you<00:01:27.450> want<00:01:27.899> to<00:01:28.080> attend

00:01:32.419 --> 00:01:32.429 
however please bear this in mind the way

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:34.070 
however please bear this in mind the way
I<00:01:32.460> run<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.880> lectures<00:01:33.270> you'll<00:01:33.509> get<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.780> slides

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
I run the lectures you'll get the slides

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.200 
I run the lectures you'll get the slides
every<00:01:34.409> week<00:01:34.560> but<00:01:35.009> that<00:01:35.190> is<00:01:35.310> just<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.640> base<00:01:35.850> you

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
every week but that is just a base you

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.850 
every week but that is just a base you
run<00:01:36.390> through<00:01:36.539> unit<00:01:36.840> outline<00:01:37.140> it's<00:01:37.590> really

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
run through unit outline it's really

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.580 
run through unit outline it's really
difficult<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.310> do<00:01:38.399> that<00:01:38.550> creatively<00:01:39.530> but<00:01:40.530> I

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
difficult to do that creatively but I

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.680 
difficult to do that creatively but I
think<00:01:40.770> it's<00:01:40.890> important<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:42.060> try<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.450> do<00:01:42.539> that

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
think it's important to try and do that

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.499 
think it's important to try and do that
creatively<00:01:43.080> so<00:01:43.530> things<00:01:43.740> like<00:01:43.890> assessment

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
creatively so things like assessment

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:47.350 
creatively so things like assessment
expectations<00:01:45.509> policies<00:01:46.440> are<00:01:46.649> very<00:01:46.679> important

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
expectations policies are very important

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.200 
expectations policies are very important
contact<00:01:48.360> mechanisms<00:01:49.009> support<00:01:50.009> mechanisms<00:01:50.640> so

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
contact mechanisms support mechanisms so

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.779 
contact mechanisms support mechanisms so
I<00:01:51.720> guess<00:01:52.050> the<00:01:52.229> standard<00:01:52.710> things<00:01:53.159> that<00:01:53.280> most<00:01:53.640> of

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:53.789 
I guess the standard things that most of

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:55.520 
I guess the standard things that most of
us<00:01:53.880> would<00:01:54.090> do<00:01:54.270> in<00:01:54.450> an<00:01:54.569> opening<00:01:54.840> lecture<00:01:54.990> but

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
us would do in an opening lecture but

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.880 
us would do in an opening lecture but

don't<00:02:25.650> just<00:02:26.069> have<00:02:26.459> to<00:02:26.519> think<00:02:26.760> about<00:02:26.989> content

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
don't just have to think about content

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:29.600 
don't just have to think about content
issues<00:02:28.410> you've<00:02:28.590> got<00:02:28.739> to<00:02:28.800> think<00:02:28.950> about<00:02:29.010> process

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
issues you've got to think about process

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:30.830 
issues you've got to think about process
so<00:02:29.819> you've<00:02:29.940> got<00:02:30.060> to<00:02:30.150> think<00:02:30.180> about<00:02:30.510> what<00:02:30.690> you're

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
so you've got to think about what you're

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.960 
so you've got to think about what you're
actually<00:02:30.989> going<00:02:31.200> to<00:02:31.440> do<00:02:31.680> in<00:02:32.010> the<00:02:32.190> lecture<00:02:32.519> more

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
actually going to do in the lecture more

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.930 
actually going to do in the lecture more
so<00:02:33.180> than<00:02:33.330> you<00:02:33.420> would<00:02:33.569> have<00:02:33.629> stand<00:02:33.900> in<00:02:34.050> lecture

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
so than you would have stand in lecture

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.490 
so than you would have stand in lecture
so<00:02:35.940> I<00:02:36.239> could<00:02:36.450> I<00:02:36.599> put<00:02:36.870> quite<00:02:37.019> a<00:02:37.080> lot<00:02:37.170> of<00:02:37.290> time

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
so I could I put quite a lot of time

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.949 
so I could I put quite a lot of time
into<00:02:37.680> it<00:02:37.800> actually

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:45.640

the main I guess device I use if that's

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.740 
the main I guess device I use if that's

misinterpret that the students do

misinterpret that the students do
naturally<00:03:10.909> I<00:03:10.940> think<00:03:11.269> get<00:03:11.510> confused<00:03:12.170> because

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
naturally I think get confused because

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.050 
of wants us to listen you're everything
like<00:03:19.010> are<00:03:19.160> you<00:03:19.280> texting<00:03:19.579> someone<00:03:19.760> about<00:03:19.970> what

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
like are you texting someone about what

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.630 
like are you texting someone about what
I'm<00:03:20.150> wearing<00:03:20.510> what's<00:03:20.629> going<00:03:20.840> on<00:03:21.340> but<00:03:22.340> I<00:03:22.400> find

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
I'm wearing what's going on but I find

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.059 
I'm wearing what's going on but I find
that<00:03:22.700> humor<00:03:23.150> for<00:03:23.329> a<00:03:23.359> start<00:03:23.629> just<00:03:23.989> it<00:03:24.620> relaxes

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:25.069 
that humor for a start just it relaxes

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:29.890 
that humor for a start just it relaxes
the<00:03:25.099> students<00:03:25.930> and<00:03:27.159> I<00:03:28.390> guess<00:03:29.390> it<00:03:29.540> makes<00:03:29.690> the

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
the students and I guess it makes the

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.449 
the students and I guess it makes the
harder<00:03:30.200> things<00:03:30.409> a<00:03:30.500> bit<00:03:30.620> more<00:03:30.739> palatable<00:03:30.950> and

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
harder things a bit more palatable and

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:33.880 
harder things a bit more palatable and
the<00:03:32.120> subject<00:03:32.510> itself<00:03:32.780> in<00:03:32.989> my<00:03:33.140> case<00:03:33.379> lends

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
the subject itself in my case lends

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:35.559 
the subject itself in my case lends
itself<00:03:34.190> to<00:03:34.310> humor<00:03:34.700> because<00:03:34.970> you've<00:03:35.090> got<00:03:35.239> human

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:35.569

you could just podcast the whole thing

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.699 
you could just podcast the whole thing
or<00:04:04.940> there'd<00:04:05.389> be<00:04:05.480> no<00:04:05.599> difference<00:04:05.959> between<00:04:06.290> that

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709 
or there'd be no difference between that

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:09.940 
or there'd be no difference between that
and<00:04:06.950> reading<00:04:07.450> it<00:04:08.450> takes<00:04:08.690> chapter<00:04:09.049> for<00:04:09.560> example

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
and reading it takes chapter for example

looking at their faces I think it's

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:17.740 
looking at their faces I think it's
critical<00:04:16.940> that<00:04:16.970> you<00:04:17.060> actually<00:04:17.209> feel<00:04:17.510> what's
