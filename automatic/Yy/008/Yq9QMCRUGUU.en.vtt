00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
wars so I'm just using them as an

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.700 
wars so I'm just using them as an
example<00:01:24.000> so<00:01:24.869> let's<00:01:25.080> go<00:01:25.170> ahead<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.530> take<00:01:25.680> a

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
example so let's go ahead and take a

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.060 
example so let's go ahead and take a
look<00:01:25.979> at<00:01:26.070> their<00:01:26.220> description<00:01:27.770> so<00:01:28.770> it<00:01:28.890> says

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
look at their description so it says

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.740 
look at their description so it says
first<00:01:29.369> attack<00:01:29.729> will<00:01:29.909> be<00:01:30.030> your<00:01:30.180> base<00:01:30.299> number

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
first attack will be your base number

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.749 
first attack will be your base number
and<00:01:30.930> second<00:01:31.590> attack<00:01:31.860> is<00:01:32.040> cleanup<00:01:32.310> of<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.610> base

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
and second attack is cleanup of a base

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.999 
and second attack is cleanup of a base
already<00:01:33.090> attacked<00:01:33.479> four<00:01:33.689> stars<00:01:33.960> now<00:01:34.680> let<00:01:34.920> me

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
already attacked four stars now let me

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.999 
already attacked four stars now let me
tell<00:01:35.159> you<00:01:35.250> why<00:01:35.369> that's<00:01:35.549> a<00:01:35.640> bad<00:01:35.850> war<00:01:36.329> strategy

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009 
tell you why that's a bad war strategy

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:39.440 
tell you why that's a bad war strategy
so<00:01:38.009> you<00:01:38.100> can<00:01:38.250> see<00:01:38.430> that<00:01:38.640> all<00:01:38.880> their<00:01:39.150> first

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
so you can see that all their first

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.420 
so you can see that all their first
attacks<00:01:39.840> are<00:01:40.079> worse<00:01:40.380> than<00:01:40.860> their<00:01:41.070> second

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
attacks are worse than their second

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.710 
attacks are worse than their second
attacks<00:01:41.729> that's<00:01:41.970> because<00:01:42.270> they're<00:01:42.420> attacking

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
attacks that's because they're attacking

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.319 
attacks that's because they're attacking
too<00:01:43.049> high<00:01:43.290> if<00:01:43.560> you<00:01:44.040> focus<00:01:44.280> your<00:01:44.579> attacks<00:01:44.850> lower

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
too high if you focus your attacks lower

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.210 
too high if you focus your attacks lower
and<00:01:45.689> make<00:01:46.170> sure<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:46.470> get<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.740> three-star

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
and make sure you get the three-star

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.249 
and make sure you get the three-star
then<00:01:47.759> you're<00:01:47.909> going<00:01:48.000> to<00:01:48.090> do<00:01:48.240> a<00:01:48.270> lot<00:01:48.720> better<00:01:48.930> in

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
then you're going to do a lot better in

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.620 
then you're going to do a lot better in
the<00:01:49.500> clan<00:01:49.740> wars<00:01:50.030> because<00:01:51.030> this<00:01:51.210> way<00:01:51.360> they're

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
the clan wars because this way they're

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.480 
the clan wars because this way they're
wasting<00:01:52.020> a<00:01:52.170> lot<00:01:52.409> of<00:01:52.470> attacks<00:01:52.890> that<00:01:53.100> they<00:01:53.250> could

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
wasting a lot of attacks that they could

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.850 
wasting a lot of attacks that they could
be<00:01:53.610> getting<00:01:53.790> three<00:01:54.060> stars<00:01:54.299> with<00:01:54.590> now<00:01:55.590> let's

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
be getting three stars with now let's

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.830 
be getting three stars with now let's
say<00:01:56.009> that<00:01:56.219> you're<00:01:56.549> number<00:01:56.820> seven<00:01:57.240> guy<00:01:57.390> attacks

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
say that you're number seven guy attacks

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.160 
say that you're number seven guy attacks
number<00:01:58.110> 25<00:01:58.530> that's<00:01:59.360> that's<00:02:00.360> a<00:02:00.509> bit<00:02:00.689> too<00:02:00.899> far

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
number 25 that's that's a bit too far

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.620 
number 25 that's that's a bit too far
okay<00:02:01.469> so<00:02:01.530> don't<00:02:02.030> don't<00:02:03.030> let<00:02:03.149> them<00:02:03.299> do<00:02:03.420> that<00:02:03.479> and

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
okay so don't don't let them do that and

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.330 
okay so don't don't let them do that and
when<00:02:03.899> I<00:02:03.930> say<00:02:04.140> a<00:02:04.170> bit<00:02:04.439> too<00:02:04.590> far<00:02:04.799> I<00:02:04.979> mean<00:02:05.159> that's

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
when I say a bit too far I mean that's

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.789 
when I say a bit too far I mean that's
that's<00:02:05.610> way<00:02:05.880> too<00:02:05.939> far<00:02:06.259> so<00:02:07.259> if<00:02:07.409> your<00:02:07.530> clan<00:02:07.770> is

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
that's way too far so if your clan is

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.410 
that's way too far so if your clan is
failing<00:02:08.250> a<00:02:08.310> lot<00:02:08.429> of<00:02:08.550> their<00:02:08.670> attacks<00:02:09.000> tell<00:02:09.300> them

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
failing a lot of their attacks tell them

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.770 
failing a lot of their attacks tell them
to<00:02:09.539> attack<00:02:09.929> a<00:02:10.140> little

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
to attack a little

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.200 
to attack a little
than<00:02:10.990> normal<00:02:11.320> like<00:02:11.860> maybe<00:02:12.400> say<00:02:12.640> three<00:02:12.910> to<00:02:13.030> five

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
than normal like maybe say three to five

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.660 
than normal like maybe say three to five
bases<00:02:13.660> or<00:02:13.780> so<00:02:13.810> and<00:02:14.200> make<00:02:15.040> sure<00:02:15.220> that<00:02:15.370> they<00:02:15.520> get

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
bases or so and make sure that they get

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.550 
bases or so and make sure that they get
the<00:02:15.790> three<00:02:15.820> start<00:02:16.270> and<00:02:16.510> if<00:02:17.140> you<00:02:17.230> do<00:02:17.380> that

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
the three start and if you do that

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.050 
the three start and if you do that
you'll<00:02:17.950> be<00:02:18.010> surprised<00:02:18.460> your<00:02:18.670> claim<00:02:18.880> is<00:02:19.030> going

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
you'll be surprised your claim is going

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.750 
you'll be surprised your claim is going
to<00:02:19.240> do<00:02:19.360> a<00:02:19.390> lot<00:02:19.720> better<00:02:20.460> now

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
to do a lot better now

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.580 
to do a lot better now
the<00:02:21.910> way<00:02:22.030> I<00:02:22.060> figured<00:02:22.450> this<00:02:22.540> out<00:02:22.990> I<00:02:23.020> mean<00:02:23.440> we've

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
the way I figured this out I mean we've

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.020 
the way I figured this out I mean we've
tried<00:02:23.740> all<00:02:23.830> the<00:02:24.130> different<00:02:24.160> war<00:02:24.760> attack

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
tried all the different war attack

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.030 
tried all the different war attack
strategies<00:02:25.600> we<00:02:26.050> tried<00:02:26.290> to<00:02:26.470> attack<00:02:26.890> your

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
strategies we tried to attack your

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.400 
strategies we tried to attack your
number<00:02:27.310> thing<00:02:27.520> that<00:02:27.760> didn't<00:02:28.060> work<00:02:28.150> out<00:02:28.410> but

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
number thing that didn't work out but

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:30.900 
number thing that didn't work out but
anyways<00:02:29.709> one<00:02:29.980> Klan<00:02:30.220> board<00:02:30.490> we<00:02:30.550> got<00:02:30.670> put<00:02:30.880> up

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
anyways one Klan board we got put up

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.210 
anyways one Klan board we got put up
against<00:02:31.300> a<00:02:31.360> team<00:02:31.600> that<00:02:31.870> had<00:02:32.170> weaker<00:02:32.620> top

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
against a team that had weaker top

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.310 
against a team that had weaker top
players<00:02:33.520> than<00:02:33.760> we<00:02:33.910> did<00:02:33.970> and<00:02:34.330> we<00:02:34.870> still<00:02:35.140> lost

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320 
players than we did and we still lost

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.650 
players than we did and we still lost
and<00:02:35.650> I<00:02:35.680> was<00:02:35.709> like<00:02:35.920> what<00:02:36.160> the<00:02:36.190> fuck<00:02:36.520> how<00:02:37.510> did

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
and I was like what the fuck how did

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.080 
and I was like what the fuck how did
they<00:02:37.750> beat<00:02:37.930> us<00:02:38.080> you<00:02:38.530> know<00:02:38.670> and<00:02:39.670> then<00:02:40.060> I

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
they beat us you know and then I

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.670 
they beat us you know and then I
realized<00:02:40.510> that<00:02:40.690> they<00:02:40.840> were<00:02:40.900> focusing<00:02:41.500> their

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
realized that they were focusing their

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.490 
realized that they were focusing their
attack<00:02:42.010> slower<00:02:42.340> and<00:02:42.959> they<00:02:43.959> clean<00:02:44.200> up<00:02:44.230> the

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
attack slower and they clean up the

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.979 
attack slower and they clean up the
bottom<00:02:44.739> bases<00:02:45.310> better<00:02:45.550> than<00:02:45.760> we<00:02:45.880> did<00:02:46.060> so<00:02:46.660> even

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
bottom bases better than we did so even

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:48.390 
bottom bases better than we did so even
though<00:02:47.080> we<00:02:47.230> got<00:02:47.350> two<00:02:47.590> stars<00:02:47.800> on<00:02:48.040> their<00:02:48.190> top

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
though we got two stars on their top

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.100 
though we got two stars on their top
players<00:02:48.670> and<00:02:48.880> they<00:02:49.030> didn't<00:02:49.270> even<00:02:49.390> touch<00:02:49.810> our

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
players and they didn't even touch our

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.340 
players and they didn't even touch our
top<00:02:50.440> players<00:02:50.709> they<00:02:51.400> still<00:02:51.700> beat<00:02:51.850> us<00:02:52.060> so<00:02:52.690> that's

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
top players they still beat us so that's

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.710 
top players they still beat us so that's
when<00:02:53.590> I<00:02:53.620> told<00:02:53.739> my<00:02:54.130> clan<00:02:54.400> mates<00:02:54.610> to<00:02:55.120> focus<00:02:55.540> your

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
when I told my clan mates to focus your

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.840 
when I told my clan mates to focus your
attacks<00:02:55.989> lower<00:02:56.350> and<00:02:56.620> then<00:02:57.340> we<00:02:57.459> started<00:02:57.760> doing

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
attacks lower and then we started doing

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.780 
attacks lower and then we started doing
a<00:02:58.090> lot<00:02:58.270> better<00:02:58.540> in<00:02:58.690> the<00:02:58.810> wars<00:02:59.430> just<00:03:00.430> recently

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
a lot better in the wars just recently

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.060 
a lot better in the wars just recently
we<00:03:01.000> went<00:03:01.180> up<00:03:01.270> against<00:03:01.630> this<00:03:01.720> clan<00:03:02.020> who<00:03:02.560> had<00:03:02.770> way

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
we went up against this clan who had way

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.160 
we went up against this clan who had way
more<00:03:03.100> townhall<00:03:03.730> tense<00:03:03.970> than<00:03:04.150> we<00:03:04.270> did<00:03:04.480> we<00:03:04.959> had

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
more townhall tense than we did we had

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.680 
more townhall tense than we did we had
three<00:03:05.500> and<00:03:05.680> they<00:03:06.010> had<00:03:06.250> like<00:03:06.459> seven<00:03:07.000> and<00:03:07.209> we

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
was surprised that we beat them honestly

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.060
