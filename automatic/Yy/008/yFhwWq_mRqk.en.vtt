tremendous amount of growth in
orthopaedics<00:00:14.519> largely<00:00:15.089> attributed<00:00:15.990> to<00:00:16.020> the

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
faculty of orthopedic surgeons I believe

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.700 
faculty of orthopedic surgeons I believe
of<00:00:35.520> any<00:00:35.670> Hospital<00:00:35.940> in<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.420> area<00:00:36.510> all<00:00:37.320> of<00:00:37.590> our

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
of any Hospital in the area all of our

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.910 
of any Hospital in the area all of our
orthopaedic<00:00:38.250> surgeons<00:00:38.820> are<00:00:39.920> subspecialty

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
orthopaedic surgeons are subspecialty

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.760 
orthopaedic surgeons are subspecialty
trained<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:41.790> focused<00:00:42.329> so<00:00:42.450> each<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.559> every

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
trained and focused so each and every

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.040 
trained and focused so each and every
one<00:00:43.920> of<00:00:43.950> them<00:00:44.219> is<00:00:44.430> an<00:00:44.579> expert<00:00:45.210> in<00:00:45.480> their<00:00:45.690> field

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
one of them is an expert in their field

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.139 
one of them is an expert in their field
I<00:00:46.260> believe<00:00:46.980> that's<00:00:47.190> an<00:00:47.340> environment<00:00:48.090> that

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
I believe that's an environment that

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.540 
I believe that's an environment that
keeps<00:00:48.600> us<00:00:48.930> at<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.770> cutting<00:00:50.129> edge<00:00:50.250> of

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
keeps us at the cutting edge of

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.420 
keeps us at the cutting edge of
orthopedic<00:00:51.000> surgery<00:00:51.030> I<00:00:51.840> think<00:00:52.170> anyone<00:00:52.890> who's

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
orthopedic surgery I think anyone who's

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.360 
orthopedic surgery I think anyone who's
going<00:00:53.910> through<00:00:54.090> major<00:00:54.660> surgery<00:00:54.899> has<00:00:55.770> very

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
going through major surgery has very

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.400 
going through major surgery has very
appropriate<00:00:57.090> concerns<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:57.840> fears<00:00:58.079> and

surgery on a daily basis for surgeons
the<00:01:26.009> actual<00:01:26.700> episode<00:01:27.689> of<00:01:27.900> care<00:01:28.200> that<00:01:28.530> involves

the actual episode of care that involves
the<00:01:29.310> surgical<00:01:29.850> procedure<00:01:30.450> is<00:01:31.020> really<00:01:31.439> only<00:01:31.560> a

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
the surgical procedure is really only a

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.280 
the surgical procedure is really only a
small<00:01:31.710> part<00:01:32.460> of<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.909> overall<00:01:33.450> care<00:01:34.049> and

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
small part of the overall care and

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.050 
small part of the overall care and
encounter<00:01:34.740> that<00:01:34.950> we<00:01:35.100> have<00:01:35.280> with<00:01:35.490> our<00:01:35.520> patients

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
encounter that we have with our patients

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.510 
encounter that we have with our patients
so<00:01:36.689> we<00:01:36.900> begin<00:01:37.290> obviously<00:01:38.040> with<00:01:38.310> the

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
so we begin obviously with the

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.450 
so we begin obviously with the
preoperative<00:01:39.500> evaluations<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.799> discussions

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
preoperative evaluations and discussions

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.160 
preoperative evaluations and discussions
that<00:01:41.670> lead<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.420> decision<00:01:42.899> to<00:01:43.020> have

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
that lead to the decision to have

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.030 
that lead to the decision to have
surgery<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:44.820> surgery<00:01:45.659> itself<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:46.409> then<00:01:46.799> the

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
surgery the surgery itself and then the

surgery the surgery itself and then the
aftercare<00:01:47.790> that's<00:01:48.149> so<00:01:48.329> important<00:01:48.930> in<00:01:49.140> the
