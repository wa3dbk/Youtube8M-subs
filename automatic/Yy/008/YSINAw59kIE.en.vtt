945pm so you can see here is relatively

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.870 
945pm so you can see here is relatively
fast<00:01:42.180> being<00:01:42.600> that<00:01:42.780> is<00:01:43.020> on<00:01:43.229> 3g<00:01:43.950> but<00:01:44.490> if<00:01:44.579> you<00:01:44.700> do

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
fast being that is on 3g but if you do

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.719 
fast being that is on 3g but if you do
go<00:01:45.090> on<00:01:45.240> Wi-Fi<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:45.810> will<00:01:46.170> be<00:01:46.290> much<00:01:46.530> faster<00:01:46.799> since

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
go on Wi-Fi it will be much faster since

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.880 
go on Wi-Fi it will be much faster since
it'll<00:01:47.909> take<00:01:48.060> less<00:01:48.240> time<00:01:48.299> to<00:01:48.540> connect<00:01:49.229> to<00:01:49.649> the

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
it'll take less time to connect to the

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.649 
it'll take less time to connect to the
server<00:01:50.100> let<00:01:50.909> me<00:01:51.030> go<00:01:51.210> ahead<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:51.390> do<00:01:51.540> the
