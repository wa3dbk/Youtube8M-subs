control of those tips what we can do is

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.520 
control of those tips what we can do is
a<00:02:08.190> simple<00:02:08.610> push<00:02:08.910> and<00:02:09.209> hold<00:02:09.539> on<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:10.020> soft<00:02:10.259> touch

recommendation<00:02:16.170> is<00:02:16.349> to<00:02:16.379> go<00:02:16.590> ahead<00:02:16.709> and<00:02:16.920> dial

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
recommendation is to go ahead and dial

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.610
