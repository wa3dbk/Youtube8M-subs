milli<00:02:23.350> and<00:02:24.030> worth<00:02:25.030> getting<00:02:25.330> yeah<00:02:26.050> I<00:02:26.080> think<00:02:26.530> it

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
milli and worth getting yeah I think it

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.190 
milli and worth getting yeah I think it
does<00:02:26.950> come<00:02:27.010> recommend<00:02:27.760> it<00:02:27.880> I<00:02:28.030> have<00:02:28.900> been<00:02:28.930> used

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
does come recommend it I have been used

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.100 
does come recommend it I have been used
it<00:02:29.350> for<00:02:29.590> week<00:02:29.800> what<00:02:30.220> would<00:02:31.030> probably<00:02:31.300> worry<00:02:31.840> me

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
it for week what would probably worry me

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.740 
it for week what would probably worry me
and<00:02:32.410> in<00:02:33.010> further<00:02:33.760> use<00:02:34.060> would<00:02:34.570> be<00:02:34.600> the

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
and in further use would be the

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.720 
and in further use would be the
construction<00:02:35.260> of<00:02:35.500> it<00:02:35.620> because<00:02:36.040> it's<00:02:36.220> plastic

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
construction of it because it's plastic

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.810 
construction of it because it's plastic
right<00:02:37.030> and<00:02:37.270> just<00:02:37.900> the<00:02:38.800> way<00:02:38.950> it<00:02:39.190> sounds<00:02:39.610> when

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
right and just the way it sounds when

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.700 
right and just the way it sounds when
you<00:02:39.850> do<00:02:40.060> this<00:02:40.300> it's<00:02:40.690> like<00:02:40.780> and<00:02:41.230> it's<00:02:41.350> pleather

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:41.710 
you do this it's like and it's pleather
