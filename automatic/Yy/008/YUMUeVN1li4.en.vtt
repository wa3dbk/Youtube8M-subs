00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:08.040
 hello all my bridlav and own 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.320
 deviations stew and before us fight on 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.679
 sandy river between the main force and 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:17.310
 clan against and 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:20.970
 sets of clan strength is 150 7 2 121 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:24.210
 4 bochata stb the rest of the Soviet stshki and 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.769
 one artillery of colors relative to 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.029
 my opinion is not bad for their Cartesian 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.000
 a little incomprehensible how will 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.380
 used 121 with their zero just 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.040
 vertical declination of the gun 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.559
 but, no less, is played from a heap of medium 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.329
 tanks and this is in my opinion optimal 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.989
 setup on this map 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:47.390
 first exit 57 predictably 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:53.250
 stays at the base of the artillery moves 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:56.190
 by zero per square k0 batik one goes on 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:00.030
 highlight squares there are seven that's it here 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.629
 a small hill st.hk takes this 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.600
 here is the place 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.210
 she can shine down the city she can 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:10.490
 shine up and one more batch remains 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:15.119
 along with 57 and we see 1 baht against and 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:16.890
 there are seven cars in the force much more 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.350
 medium tanks in this area 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.720
 therefore, I understand that they are here 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.280
 nothing can not do 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:28.380
 get some damage in their tanks 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.640
 and retreat back to the village when they see that 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.900
 the enemy retreats 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:37.290
 on the dunes back begin systematically but 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.009
 take the c-line slowly 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.790
 lines and 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:44.280
 occupy their part of the dunes 57 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.250
 still glow on e-4 square 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.229
 they are likely to go up 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.210
 relatively symmetry here this 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.090
 verticals then the north will try 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:58.310
 hold against 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:02:02.670
 dunes will occupy power and there will be a game 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:04.620
 -1 57 he could not from here childhood 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.810
 it could, in principle, go back 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:09.210
 me in a hurry that's the focus whether a couple of shots 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.660
 blindly attempt to target 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:14.820
 the remaining fifty-sevenths but you can 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.600
 hit but anyway killings 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:21.720
 No, meanwhile, bachatu against video from 1 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:24.750
 2 verticals go up and 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.680
 they cleaned the years that lighted just 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.600
 same square g7 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:33.810
 21 more but one of the ports remained there 57 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:39.510
 and the batchat discharged the drum and take 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:41.070
 one of against the trees break 57 we 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:45.000
 still in the majority 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:48.060
 its here and 100 forties here's another 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.750
 six ops 3 months and a little better vm. 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:54.090
 and they can from the dunes from the tower rising 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.910
 so here is the sides trying to cure 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:02.070
 easily pierce and and the tower 57 and batch a 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:03.660
 another 21 force is on the green it is very 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.570
 important now try after all 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:09.209
 hide artillery to just in 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:11.489
 somehow from here and not lit up 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:15.260
 not killed well, although it is basically hidden 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:20.689
 so what is relatively safe 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:22.579
 three minutes of battle passed power leads 21 they 

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:24.829
 evenly distributed evenly across 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:26.030
 half card the other half 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:31.180
 belongs to pro-tf 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:34.069
 and you can start the game positional 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.470
 most of the forces about you lit up 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:39.379
 until i see any artillery 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.359
 and the setup is two weave which remained 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:43.459
 on the base 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:46.690
 a bunch of batchatov wanted to drive on 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:49.000
 57 dunes wanted to help from above 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:53.870
 probably enough interesting tactics 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:56.150
 weave is a guarantee that will not be taken 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.250
 their base at least right away and a bunch 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:03.489
 drum tanks is an attempt to fast 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:03.489
 kills meanwhile all 22 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.280
 slightly increase the speed 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:16.709
 do not look crawls out 57 it is not clear where 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:21.239
 getting out and dying score 32 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:24.120
 Why ask to get off the lights butt 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:26.690
 immediately what they will try to throw from 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:30.330
 all directions then score 42 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:34.950
 why batch somewhere climbs climbs again 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:37.920
 57 previous two deaths nothing to him 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:40.980
 explained and he believes that he is definitely not 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:43.620
 nakidaet but our fears the bill barely in 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:46.350
 strength is not in a hurry 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:49.620
 after counting 223 tanks against 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:52.740
 they decided to become frags they are good 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:55.919
 position they have the advantage of repeating 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:58.230
 in three tanks is their territory they rush 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:02.640
 some and they have artillery which 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:05.040
 already made one frag well and plus 

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:06.720
 artillery force must throw over 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:10.620
 fifty-seventh is relatively straight 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:12.260
 aiming and artillery about iks i'm so 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:15.510
 I assume that all the same artillery 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:16.100
 forced to throw on the dunes we train 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:19.650
 too 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:22.460
 Needless to say the artillery forces do it and 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.460
 much easier 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:32.090
 part of the force is about three or four st-shki 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:35.160
 three stitches 57 are pulled to their base 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:37.110
 occupy a key point for highlighting not 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.130
 for the city in a friend all the same who is 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:43.200
 two 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:45.870
 goes to the top and 57 their control and immediately 

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:49.620
 at the same time, the batchat flies 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:53.910
 very important place this place allows 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:57.390
 highlight both up and here it is 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:59.130
 place square vd1 and square f6 and 

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:01.190
 artillery can throw already absolutely 

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:03.510
 with impunity these powers 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:05.160
 caught in the crossfire they can 

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:07.380
 to leave here because they throw in 

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:10.830
 medium tanks from the dunes and in the meantime 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:13.470
 here from here we call also goes fire all 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:16.620
 one action the passage of the novel is already on 

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:21.270
 Butcher on the back does a check of 5 2 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:24.450
 crushing 92 shot stitch is nothing 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:27.300
 can not do completely territory 

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:30.960
 card controls power six minutes to 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:33.500
 end of the battle and just need to finish 

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:37.260
 remaining forces against 

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:39.750
 focus goes well done hitting zhku not going 

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:41.729
 houses in the comb for this huge respect 

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:44.370
 need from focus naturally easy 

00:06:41.729 --> 00:06:47.340
 kill goals and only then do 

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:50.310
 by others, yes she hid and now you can 

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:50.610
 disassemble weave but nevertheless you are the goal 

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:54.720
 or 

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:57.950
 Now we get a hundred and it's 15 2 and a victory 

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.950
 clan power
