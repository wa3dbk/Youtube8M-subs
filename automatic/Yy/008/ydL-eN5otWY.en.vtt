00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.830
 atypical is to always have in brazil how it is 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.900
 Your mix inevat used the yellow and blue in the 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.500

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.840

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.420
 Real Brazil will have several hits as well 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.160
 It's legal for you to combine 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.170
 I used it on each nail 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.630
 I'll leave you the names of 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.029
 all the enamels in the registration box 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.560
 here on youtube there on the blog 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.989
 After I thought everything to be a 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.890
 called a top coat to start nor the 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.980
 art 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.309
 now I'm going to cut out my ribbon 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.620
 and I 'm going to use your little 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.390
 middle finger art 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.829
 so I cut the symbols in little feet 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:53.100
 then I cut again has stayed 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:56.940
 several fine lines first goes 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.050
 roll one diagonally in the center of my 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.210
 middle finger 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.690
 the others I'll put beside this 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.690
 first 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:14.189
 now that they're all stuck I push 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:17.490
 a little closer to the cuticle of the 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.350
 nail edges eg to lower glue 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:27.479
 well on my fingernail and did not let a 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:30.990
 and now is the time to cover with the 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:33.090
 another color of its nor green spill art and 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.679
 like this glaze I know he was 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.810
 very thin so it was not covering 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:38.580
 at once it passes several 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.920
 calls only so I spent the behind 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.259
 I did not expect to dry them on the other 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.009
 gerald alex does not know the gum was the 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.530
 River 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:51.319
 So I got some tweezers and I was pulling 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.319
 every my mother's durex ribbon there 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:09.920
 Now in the little pinkie I cut a little bit 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.120
 durex and left the account in the 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.220
 my nail 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.930
 then it is as if it were a triangle and that 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.470
 will do the part of the curtain 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.900
 I'll cut the edges so I can use 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.330
 well the drex on my fingernail and will not use 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.060
 nail polish watching that sometimes 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:29.840
 happens if it gets a bump that 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.910
 Duratex nail finishes enamel leak 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:36.100
 now I got the yellow enamel and 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:38.450
 I went over it, that's all there is no secret. 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:40.790
 also if you need one more layer 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.580
 you can pass 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:47.709
 remembering do not let this enamel dry 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.709
 as well as being quickly 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:54.100
 now let's go to the indicator clash 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:58.280
 aubrey inverted golden publisher 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:03:01.580
 so first I applied stitched 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:04.790
 on the right side afterwards with the brush 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.680
 of bird answered to spread now 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:10.670
 applying a little more and spreading 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:12.530
 again to stay a transition do not stay 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.530
 very marked 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:18.560
 then I got the glaze that the public 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.690
 is greater than applying a pure because I 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.209
 I did not want it to accumulate much base 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:25.570
 this law to x and after turning the 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:25.570
 marbles 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.939
 It is ready to cheer for only Animarte 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.650
