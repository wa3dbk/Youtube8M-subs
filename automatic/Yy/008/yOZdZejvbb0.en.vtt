doing some work with Ricky and a stuffed
fake<00:01:30.420> squirrel<00:01:30.860> well<00:01:31.860> we've<00:01:32.100> moved<00:01:32.370> on<00:01:32.580> a

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
fake squirrel well we've moved on a

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.310 
fake squirrel well we've moved on a
little<00:01:32.910> bit<00:01:33.060> from<00:01:33.210> that<00:01:33.300> she<00:01:33.750> was<00:01:34.080> pretty

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
little bit from that she was pretty

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.350 
little bit from that she was pretty
reactive<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.980> tweaking<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:35.700> I<00:01:35.910> think<00:01:36.180> she's

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
reactive to tweaking and I think she's

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.180 
reactive to tweaking and I think she's
pretty<00:01:36.540> much<00:01:36.690> figured<00:01:37.050> out<00:01:37.200> it<00:01:37.440> was<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:37.620> toy<00:01:37.890> and

pretty much figured out it was a toy and
she<00:01:38.490> was<00:01:38.610> just<00:01:38.640> curious<00:01:39.000> of<00:01:39.330> why<00:01:39.480> she<00:01:39.780> couldn't

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
she was just curious of why she couldn't

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.840 
she was just curious of why she couldn't
play<00:01:40.230> with<00:01:40.440> that<00:01:40.590> toy<00:01:40.860> but<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.580> squirrels

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
the squirrels she's doing a really good

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.600 
the squirrels she's doing a really good
job<00:02:03.750> of<00:02:03.990> holding<00:02:04.290> herself<00:02:04.590> back<00:02:04.800> even<00:02:05.490> when

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
job of holding herself back even when

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.270 
job of holding herself back even when
she<00:02:05.820> does<00:02:06.000> get<00:02:06.240> excited<00:02:06.780> but<00:02:07.620> the<00:02:07.740> problem<00:02:08.130> is

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
she does get excited but the problem is

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.430 
she does get excited but the problem is
is<00:02:08.520> she's<00:02:08.790> still<00:02:09.119> getting<00:02:09.360> excited<00:02:09.960> despite

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
is she's still getting excited despite

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.080 
is she's still getting excited despite
being<00:02:10.890> able<00:02:11.190> to<00:02:11.250> hold<00:02:11.400> herself<00:02:11.610> back

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
being able to hold herself back

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.760 
being able to hold herself back
basically<00:02:12.780> all<00:02:12.810> week<00:02:13.110> I've<00:02:13.260> been<00:02:13.290> taking

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
basically all week I've been taking

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.770 
basically all week I've been taking
Ricky<00:02:14.040> on<00:02:14.130> a<00:02:14.160> walk<00:02:14.430> through<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:14.940> park<00:02:15.120> we're

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
Ricky on a walk through the park we're

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.360 
Ricky on a walk through the park we're
taking<00:02:16.110> the<00:02:16.200> same<00:02:16.410> route<00:02:16.650> so<00:02:16.890> there's<00:02:17.100> no

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
taking the same route so there's no

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.250 
taking the same route so there's no
surprises<00:02:17.550> with<00:02:18.270> the<00:02:18.690> exception<00:02:19.110> of<00:02:19.170> the

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
surprises with the exception of the

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.930

squirrels<00:02:19.530> popping<00:02:19.920> up<00:02:20.010> here<00:02:20.250> and<00:02:20.400> there<00:02:20.550> now

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
squirrels popping up here and there now

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.880 
squirrels popping up here and there now
she<00:02:21.000> seems<00:02:21.420> to<00:02:21.630> remember<00:02:21.780> exactly<00:02:22.650> where

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
she seems to remember exactly where

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.380 
she seems to remember exactly where
she's<00:02:23.130> seen<00:02:23.370> this<00:02:23.520> girl's<00:02:23.820> the<00:02:24.000> day<00:02:24.180> before

she's seen this girl's the day before

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.510 
she's seen this girl's the day before
and<00:02:24.930> that's<00:02:25.230> where<00:02:25.440> she<00:02:25.590> gets<00:02:25.830> a<00:02:26.010> little<00:02:26.280> bit

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
and that's where she gets a little bit

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.280 
and that's where she gets a little bit
excited<00:02:26.640> as<00:02:27.120> we're<00:02:27.480> approaching<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:28.020> area

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
excited as we're approaching the area

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.200 
excited as we're approaching the area
where<00:02:28.650> she<00:02:28.890> knows<00:02:29.220> there<00:02:29.580> were<00:02:29.730> squirrels<00:02:30.000> in

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
where she knows there were squirrels in

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.000 
where she knows there were squirrels in
the<00:02:30.240> past<00:02:30.540> she<00:02:30.720> seems<00:02:31.080> to<00:02:31.230> pull<00:02:31.440> more<00:02:31.740> on<00:02:31.890> the

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
the past she seems to pull more on the

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.860 
the past she seems to pull more on the
leash<00:02:32.190> she's<00:02:32.730> really<00:02:33.150> trying<00:02:33.420> hard<00:02:33.600> to<00:02:33.720> hold

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
leash she's really trying hard to hold

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.750 
leash she's really trying hard to hold
herself<00:02:34.050> back<00:02:34.500> but<00:02:34.800> she<00:02:34.950> can't<00:02:35.190> seem<00:02:35.460> to<00:02:35.610> turn

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
herself back but she can't seem to turn

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.070 
herself back but she can't seem to turn
that<00:02:35.940> switch<00:02:36.120> off<00:02:36.420> on<00:02:36.570> her<00:02:36.660> brain<00:02:36.870> that's

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
that switch off on her brain that's

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.960 
that switch off on her brain that's
telling<00:02:37.440> her<00:02:37.560> don't<00:02:38.010> get<00:02:38.220> excited<00:02:38.340> the

telling her don't get excited the

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.640 
telling her don't get excited the
repetition<00:02:39.540> seems<00:02:39.750> to<00:02:39.930> be<00:02:40.020> helping<00:02:40.140> Ricky<00:02:40.620> a

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
repetition seems to be helping Ricky a

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.220 
repetition seems to be helping Ricky a
great<00:02:41.160> deal<00:02:41.490> before<00:02:42.090> we<00:02:42.510> started<00:02:42.810> doing<00:02:43.110> this

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
great deal before we started doing this

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.990 
great deal before we started doing this
every<00:02:43.800> time<00:02:43.980> we<00:02:44.130> came<00:02:44.250> to<00:02:44.370> the<00:02:44.460> park<00:02:44.640> she<00:02:44.820> was

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
every time we came to the park she was

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.850 
every time we came to the park she was
pulling<00:02:45.240> on<00:02:45.510> the<00:02:45.630> leash<00:02:45.660> but<00:02:46.170> after<00:02:46.350> a<00:02:46.530> week<00:02:46.710> of

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
pulling on the leash but after a week of

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.560 
pulling on the leash but after a week of
working<00:02:47.100> with<00:02:47.370> this<00:02:47.490> on<00:02:47.670> her<00:02:47.880> she<00:02:48.120> seems<00:02:48.390> to<00:02:48.540> be

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
working with this on her she seems to be

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.870 
working with this on her she seems to be
doing<00:02:48.690> a<00:02:49.080> lot<00:02:49.380> better<00:02:49.440> now<00:02:50.130> Ricky<00:02:50.400> seems<00:02:50.670> to<00:02:50.790> be

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
doing a lot better now Ricky seems to be

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.880 
doing a lot better now Ricky seems to be
recovering<00:02:51.180> a<00:02:51.570> lot<00:02:51.900> faster<00:02:52.170> after<00:02:52.590> her

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
recovering a lot faster after her

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.500 
recovering a lot faster after her
excitement<00:02:53.280> phase<00:02:53.550> of<00:02:53.820> seeing<00:02:54.030> the<00:02:54.150> squirrels

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
excitement phase of seeing the squirrels

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.050 
excitement phase of seeing the squirrels
but<00:02:55.230> she's<00:02:55.560> still<00:02:55.980> having<00:02:56.280> that<00:02:56.430> initial

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
but she's still having that initial

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.150 
but she's still having that initial
excitement<00:02:57.600> phase<00:02:57.780> and<00:02:58.110> it's<00:02:58.470> proving<00:02:59.010> to<00:02:59.040> be

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
excitement phase and it's proving to be

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.950 
excitement phase and it's proving to be
a<00:02:59.280> really<00:02:59.940> hard<00:03:00.120> challenge<00:03:00.270> for<00:03:00.630> us<00:03:00.660> to<00:03:00.840> get

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:00.960 
a really hard challenge for us to get

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.930 
a really hard challenge for us to get
her<00:03:01.020> past<00:03:01.260> it<00:03:01.500> ultimately<00:03:02.190> if<00:03:02.430> she<00:03:02.610> used<00:03:02.760> to

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
her past it ultimately if she used to

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.460 
her past it ultimately if she used to
become<00:03:03.180> a<00:03:03.210> guide<00:03:03.480> dog<00:03:03.510> she<00:03:03.930> needs<00:03:04.110> to<00:03:04.260> be<00:03:04.410> able
