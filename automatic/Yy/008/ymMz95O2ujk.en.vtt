00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.970

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.440

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.300

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.640
 favors to the soul so it starts with 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:24.720

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:28.140

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:32.170

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:34.120
 young needs a good car if I had 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.600
 one that would work something that I do not have 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:39.460
 because you think I would give it to you 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.229
 yes, I will carry my car 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.970
 take advantage of my food too 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.580
 well you could lose that food a little 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:50.940
 listen to me well you're going to put on method 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:53.100
 I need you to shut up is fine 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:57.500
 the favors that you think I owe you are not 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.500
 so important right the zombies 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.240
 I do not care because I do not have a car 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.149
 it works but there is one in this city 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:07.439
 pieces there are pieces in this action and fica 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:07.439
 is that you could repair one 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.239
 all right 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.920
 if I'm going to do it, I would need 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:17.190
 tools are on the other side of the 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.130
 city 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:23.590
 now help me pick them up and maybe 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:27.990
 can put together something that works 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:30.930
 but after this I will not owe you anything 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:33.960
 it's fine in a few days maybe we're 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.680

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:40.100

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.100

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.640
