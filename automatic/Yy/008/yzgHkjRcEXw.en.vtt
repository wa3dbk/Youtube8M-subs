anybody is really really dangerous the
drop<00:03:14.570> rates<00:03:14.810> aren't<00:03:15.020> great<00:03:15.380> but<00:03:16.130> if<00:03:16.250> you're

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
drop rates aren't great but if you're

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.730 
drop rates aren't great but if you're
lucky<00:03:16.520> it<00:03:16.760> can<00:03:16.910> average<00:03:17.150> out<00:03:17.420> between<00:03:17.570> 600<00:03:18.290> k<00:03:18.440> 2

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:18.740 
lucky it can average out between 600 k 2

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.340 
you with the drops of their vest and
stuff<00:03:47.090> so<00:03:47.300> i<00:03:47.330> decided<00:03:47.690> to<00:03:47.810> just<00:03:47.990> take<00:03:48.080> our

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:50.230 
stuff so i decided to just take our
ringer<00:03:48.800> wealth<00:03:49.010> and<00:03:49.280> that<00:03:49.550> would<00:03:49.730> allow<00:03:49.970> me<00:03:50.120> to

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:50.240 
ringer wealth and that would allow me to

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.550 
ringer wealth and that would allow me to
use<00:03:50.360> the<00:03:50.480> teleport<00:03:50.900> to<00:03:50.990> the<00:03:51.020> grant<00:03:51.260> exchange

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
use the teleport to the grant exchange

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.100 
use the teleport to the grant exchange
in<00:03:51.830> above<00:03:52.040> level<00:03:52.280> 20<00:03:52.640> wilderness<00:03:53.030> and<00:03:53.240> it

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
in above level 20 wilderness and it

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:55.660 
in above level 20 wilderness and it
proved<00:03:54.350> very<00:03:54.590> useful<00:03:54.710> three<00:03:55.160> times<00:03:55.400> that
