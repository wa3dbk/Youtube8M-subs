one you see right here was the first one
when<00:03:16.260> we<00:03:16.410> built<00:03:17.040> and<00:03:17.280> it<00:03:17.489> really<00:03:17.669> works<00:03:17.910> from

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
when we built and it really works from

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.809 
when we built and it really works from
better<00:03:18.389> for<00:03:18.630> larger<00:03:18.930> stamps<00:03:19.349> because<00:03:19.639> if<00:03:20.639> you

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 
better for larger stamps because if you

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:22.580 
better for larger stamps because if you
put<00:03:20.849> the<00:03:21.120> stamp<00:03:21.419> down<00:03:21.720> in<00:03:21.989> there<00:03:22.169> you<00:03:22.319> can't

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:31.400 
see it so the next one you built we
actually<00:03:26.730> lose<00:03:27.769> this<00:03:28.769> um<00:03:29.359> plexiglass<00:03:30.359> to<00:03:31.260> be
