 and here we increase and at low volume and 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.270
 here o 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:18.560
 you can see is that the entrance of the 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:20.540
 sd card and then it's very thin f1 is fine 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.630
 It's nice that his designer has a 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:27.590
 Here the front camera has the camera 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:30.950
 2 megapixel rear 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:34.880
 here it has a speaker here one 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:37.670
 loud speaker he's pink here because he's from 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.810
 but it has other colors available 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:45.799
 in the market 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:49.939
 and if it is the 10-inch trr 101 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:53.090
 He has that entrance he has here. 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:56.869
 input that the button shut it down here 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:59.079

 here are two sb and here's the camera 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.910
 back of that camera to bring of 2 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:12.640
 megapixels also here the front camera 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:16.330
 here where the low volume 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:18.400
 he here until he also has the two 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.190
 authors here have two speakers 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.709
 front of the other I have 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:27.580
 So I do not know if you can see 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:32.400
 video than 10 inch tr 101 it is 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.400
 well greater than 1 of 9 inches here 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.480
 the difference is a lot is good 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.610
 larger than the other 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.440
 Is he really the little guy? 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.620
 for you who want to play more games 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:47.590
 with more memory and I indicated 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.270
 plus three 101 because it has twice 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.060
 memory double the internal demand 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:55.330
 and his resolution here is his screen is 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.040
 much higher than that of Iraq indicated 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.530
 also he is also the bomb game but 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.450
 games but it also indicates it 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.280
 for those who want to take college or 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.630
 Penny if it's for him, right? 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.500
 it is easier to take because he is 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:10.660
 then the lower is better 9 inches 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.090
 take leads him too because he is more 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.940
 light and it does not heat does not heat 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:19.900
 nothing now from 10 inches it heats up 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:21.010
 A little bit but it's a little bit really 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.489
 those quental 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:26.860
 I was surprised by the acs, why? 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:30.190
 black is like a galaxie they too 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:32.110
 they are very fast they are very fast 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.680
 to navigate you enter here in the menu 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:39.430
 1 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:41.549
 the two are very fast then the staff 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:46.299
 I have a samsung galaxy 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:48.459
 tablet it the same thing difficult to 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:50.019
 to mess with them is all the same 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:52.810
 I see no difference in this country that 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:55.810
 receive very little even then this was the 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:58.410
