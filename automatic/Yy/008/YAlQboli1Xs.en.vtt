biggest<00:01:04.890> challenge<00:01:05.309> I've<00:01:05.430> got<00:01:05.640> in<00:01:05.880> work<00:01:06.240> on<00:01:06.540> a

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
biggest challenge I've got in work on a

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.450 
biggest challenge I've got in work on a
daily<00:01:06.810> basis<00:01:07.290> is<00:01:07.500> increasing<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.189> number<00:01:08.220> of

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
daily basis is increasing the number of

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.980 
daily basis is increasing the number of
people<00:01:08.640> playing<00:01:08.970> sport<00:01:09.270> because<00:01:09.659> that<00:01:09.840> is<00:01:09.960> a

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
people playing sport because that is a

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.660 
people playing sport because that is a
difficult<00:01:10.530> thing<00:01:10.590> to<00:01:10.830> do<00:01:11.100> that's<00:01:11.369> about

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
difficult thing to do that's about

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.060 
difficult thing to do that's about
changing<00:01:12.119> human<00:01:12.390> behavior<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:13.320> that's<00:01:13.860> up

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
changing human behavior and that's up

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.850 
changing human behavior and that's up
and<00:01:14.430> I<00:01:14.850> think<00:01:15.150> on<00:01:15.299> a

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
and I think on a

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.710 
and I think on a
L'Aquila<00:01:16.310> helpers<00:01:16.640> at<00:01:16.790> the<00:01:16.850> level<00:01:17.150> probably

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
L'Aquila helpers at the level probably

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.260 
L'Aquila helpers at the level probably
managing<00:01:18.290> the<00:01:18.380> last<00:01:18.560> team<00:01:18.800> of<00:01:18.890> people<00:01:19.270> it's

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
managing the last team of people it's

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:21.790 
managing the last team of people it's
the<00:01:20.390> hardest<00:01:20.690> bit<00:01:20.900> but<00:01:21.050> it's<00:01:21.170> awesome<00:01:21.650> the

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:21.800 
the hardest bit but it's awesome the

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.020 
the hardest bit but it's awesome the
most<00:01:21.950> rewarding<00:01:22.130> of<00:01:22.430> it<00:01:22.580> when<00:01:22.730> you<00:01:22.820> get<00:01:22.910> it

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
most rewarding of it when you get it

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.240 
most rewarding of it when you get it
right<00:01:23.210> and<00:01:23.540> when<00:01:23.840> people<00:01:23.990> do<00:01:24.230> good<00:01:24.410> stuff<00:01:24.530> get

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
right and when people do good stuff get

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.790 
right and when people do good stuff get
the<00:01:25.280> most<00:01:25.460> out<00:01:25.700> of<00:01:25.730> that<00:01:25.910> probably<00:01:26.650> and<00:01:27.650> what

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:27.800 
the most out of that probably and what

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.290 
the most out of that probably and what
advice<00:01:28.010> would<00:01:28.130> you<00:01:28.310> give<00:01:28.430> to<00:01:28.640> someone<00:01:28.970> that's

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:29.300 
advice would you give to someone that's

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.510 
advice would you give to someone that's
looking<00:01:29.540> to<00:01:29.900> enter<00:01:30.230> your<00:01:30.440> sector<00:01:31.280> and<00:01:31.430> the
