had<00:03:40.660> a<00:03:40.690> lot<00:03:40.810> of<00:03:40.870> copper<00:03:41.110> plants<00:03:41.410> I<00:03:41.500> don't<00:03:41.650> have

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
had a lot of copper plants I don't have

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:42.780 
had a lot of copper plants I don't have
a<00:03:41.769> whole<00:03:41.890> lot<00:03:42.010> of<00:03:42.100> experience<00:03:42.280> with<00:03:42.640> them<00:03:42.730> but

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
a whole lot of experience with them but

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.150 
a whole lot of experience with them but
my<00:03:43.030> very<00:03:43.540> first<00:03:43.780> one<00:03:43.989> was<00:03:44.230> dwarf<00:03:44.590> baby<00:03:44.860> tears

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
my very first one was dwarf baby tears

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.490 
my very first one was dwarf baby tears
and<00:03:46.090> I<00:03:46.330> think<00:03:46.510> that's<00:03:46.630> a<00:03:46.720> plant<00:03:46.959> people<00:03:47.170> think

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
and I think that's a plant people think

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.020 
and I think that's a plant people think
of<00:03:47.620> the<00:03:47.769> most<00:03:47.980> when<00:03:48.250> they<00:03:48.340> think<00:03:48.550> of<00:03:48.700> a<00:03:48.790> cover

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
of the most when they think of a cover

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.810 
of the most when they think of a cover
plant<00:03:49.330> in<00:03:50.200> my<00:03:50.350> opinion<00:03:50.739> that<00:03:51.250> plant<00:03:51.670> has<00:03:51.790> a

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:51.820 
plant in my opinion that plant has a

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.729 
plant in my opinion that plant has a
great<00:03:52.090> plant<00:03:52.330> it<00:03:52.450> has<00:03:52.570> really<00:03:52.870> small<00:03:53.530> leaves

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
great plant it has really small leaves

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:55.979 
great plant it has really small leaves
it<00:03:54.070> stays<00:03:54.280> really<00:03:54.459> small<00:03:54.760> and<00:03:54.880> compact<00:03:55.209> but<00:03:55.480> if

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
it stays really small and compact but if

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:57.930 
it stays really small and compact but if
you<00:03:56.140> litigate<00:03:56.440> if<00:03:56.800> you<00:03:56.950> don't<00:03:57.250> keep<00:03:57.430> on<00:03:57.730> top<00:03:57.910> of

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
you litigate if you don't keep on top of

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.690 
you litigate if you don't keep on top of
it<00:03:58.209> basically<00:03:58.930> what<00:03:59.230> happens<00:03:59.560> is<00:03:59.800> it<00:04:00.459> becomes

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
it basically what happens is it becomes

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.580 
it basically what happens is it becomes
really<00:04:01.150> buoyant<00:04:01.450> it<00:04:01.600> becomes<00:04:01.840> too<00:04:02.019> large<00:04:02.200> and

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
really buoyant it becomes too large and

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.050 
really buoyant it becomes too large and
it<00:04:02.709> uproots<00:04:03.100> itself<00:04:03.459> so<00:04:03.670> that<00:04:03.700> was<00:04:04.000> the

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
it uproots itself so that was the

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.690 
it uproots itself so that was the
problem<00:04:04.269> with<00:04:04.510> I<00:04:04.660> had<00:04:04.840> with<00:04:04.989> that<00:04:05.050> plant<00:04:05.700> so

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
problem with I had with that plant so

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.160 
problem with I had with that plant so
that<00:04:06.880> brooded<00:04:07.060> itself<00:04:07.480> and<00:04:07.690> then<00:04:07.810> basically

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
that brooded itself and then basically

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:09.690 
that brooded itself and then basically
that's<00:04:08.380> what<00:04:08.530> led<00:04:08.980> to<00:04:09.010> me<00:04:09.220> taking<00:04:09.250> down<00:04:09.670> that

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
that's what led to me taking down that

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.120 
that's what led to me taking down that
tank<00:04:10.090> I'll<00:04:10.930> leave<00:04:11.080> a<00:04:11.110> a<00:04:11.410> picture<00:04:11.890> of<00:04:11.980> what

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
tank I'll leave a a picture of what

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.430 
tank I'll leave a a picture of what
happens<00:04:12.459> when<00:04:13.000> that<00:04:13.239> plant<00:04:13.780> gets<00:04:13.989> uprooted

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
happens when that plant gets uprooted

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.050 
happens when that plant gets uprooted
it's<00:04:14.560> not<00:04:14.709> fun<00:04:14.950> so<00:04:14.980> I'll<00:04:15.280> put<00:04:15.459> that<00:04:15.550> Bush<00:04:15.730> that

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
it's not fun so I'll put that Bush that

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:23.140 
it's not fun so I'll put that Bush that
picture<00:04:16.330> right<00:04:16.450> here

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.810 

and<00:04:23.810> then<00:04:23.900> my<00:04:24.020> next<00:04:24.050> plant<00:04:24.740> was<00:04:24.949> s<00:04:25.160> reference<00:04:25.610> I

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
and then my next plant was s reference I

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.790 
and then my next plant was s reference I
use<00:04:25.970> that<00:04:26.180> plant<00:04:26.479> as<00:04:26.720> a<00:04:26.780> carb<00:04:27.229> apply<00:04:27.440> in<00:04:27.680> my

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
use that plant as a carb apply in my

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.890 
use that plant as a carb apply in my
hunter<00:04:28.100> gallon<00:04:28.370> tank<00:04:28.580> I<00:04:28.760> used<00:04:28.940> about<00:04:29.060> 500

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
hunter gallon tank I used about 500

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.430 
hunter gallon tank I used about 500
stems<00:04:30.110> to<00:04:30.380> get<00:04:30.530> the<00:04:30.620> carpet<00:04:31.010> in<00:04:31.160> that<00:04:31.490> tank<00:04:32.440> the

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
stems to get the carpet in that tank the

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.080 
stems to get the carpet in that tank the
thing<00:04:33.590> I<00:04:33.710> like<00:04:33.830> about<00:04:33.860> that<00:04:34.160> plant<00:04:34.460> is<00:04:34.729> that

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
thing I like about that plant is that

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:36.909 
thing I like about that plant is that
it's<00:04:35.270> too<00:04:35.510> large<00:04:35.720> to<00:04:35.990> use<00:04:36.110> as<00:04:36.290> kharbut<00:04:36.650> plants

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:36.919 
it's too large to use as kharbut plants

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:38.469 
it's too large to use as kharbut plants
and<00:04:37.040> a<00:04:37.070> lot<00:04:37.220> of<00:04:37.310> Tanks<00:04:37.550> especially<00:04:37.970> one<00:04:38.120> small

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:38.479 
and a lot of Tanks especially one small

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:41.170 
and a lot of Tanks especially one small
like<00:04:38.630> this<00:04:38.870> a<00:04:39.490> great<00:04:40.490> thing<00:04:40.669> about<00:04:40.699> that<00:04:40.880> plan

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
like this a great thing about that plan

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.850 
like this a great thing about that plan
as<00:04:41.300> its<00:04:41.419> root<00:04:41.600> structure<00:04:41.960> has<00:04:42.139> a<00:04:42.169> great<00:04:42.590> roof

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
as its root structure has a great roof

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.850 
as its root structure has a great roof
structure<00:04:43.220> if<00:04:43.460> you<00:04:44.240> let<00:04:44.510> that<00:04:44.690> mature<00:04:45.229> and<00:04:45.530> the

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
structure if you let that mature and the

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.020 
structure if you let that mature and the
roof<00:04:46.130> structure<00:04:46.370> and<00:04:46.550> that<00:04:46.610> plant<00:04:46.910> is

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030 
roof structure and that plant is

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.120 
roof structure and that plant is
ridiculous<00:04:47.600> in<00:04:47.810> that<00:04:48.080> tank<00:04:48.350> I<00:04:48.590> was<00:04:48.770> using<00:04:48.919> a

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
ridiculous in that tank I was using a

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.909 
ridiculous in that tank I was using a
dirt<00:04:49.550> using<00:04:50.060> dirt<00:04:50.389> so<00:04:50.720> it<00:04:51.350> really<00:04:51.530> just<00:04:51.590> took

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:51.919 
dirt using dirt so it really just took

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:54.550 
dirt using dirt so it really just took
off<00:04:52.100> from<00:04:52.280> me<00:04:52.430> a<00:04:52.460> nut<00:04:52.610> tank<00:04:52.910> in<00:04:53.840> this<00:04:53.990> tank<00:04:54.050> I'm

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 
off from me a nut tank in this tank I'm

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.250 
off from me a nut tank in this tank I'm
using<00:04:54.830> IE<00:04:55.220> bellum<00:04:55.699> adore<00:04:56.300> paragraphs<00:04:56.870> and<00:04:57.139> so

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:57.260 
using IE bellum adore paragraphs and so

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.320 
using IE bellum adore paragraphs and so
far<00:04:57.500> it's<00:04:57.740> been<00:04:57.830> easily<00:04:58.550> my<00:04:58.729> favorite<00:04:59.090> plant

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
far it's been easily my favorite plant

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.810 
far it's been easily my favorite plant
it<00:04:59.930> meets<00:05:00.260> all<00:05:00.410> the<00:05:00.530> criteria<00:05:00.650> by<00:05:01.160> lichen<00:05:01.610> and

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820 
it meets all the criteria by lichen and

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:05.529 
it meets all the criteria by lichen and
dwarf<00:05:02.600> plants<00:05:03.050> or<00:05:03.380> in<00:05:03.710> carpet<00:05:04.130> plants<00:05:04.510> has<00:05:05.510> a

dwarf plants or in carpet plants has a

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:08.020 
dwarf plants or in carpet plants has a
really<00:05:05.870> good<00:05:05.960> car<00:05:06.199> roof<00:05:06.889> structure<00:05:07.250> the<00:05:07.789> Leafs

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:08.030 
really good car roof structure the Leafs

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.060 
really good car roof structure the Leafs
stay<00:05:08.419> really<00:05:08.660> small<00:05:08.960> I<00:05:08.990> went<00:05:09.350> trim<00:05:09.710> this<00:05:09.860> tank

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.070 
stay really small I went trim this tank

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:12.040 
stay really small I went trim this tank
twice<00:05:10.370> I<00:05:10.729> haven't<00:05:11.300> trimmed<00:05:11.510> it<00:05:11.660> in<00:05:11.780> probably

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.050 
twice I haven't trimmed it in probably

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:13.210 
twice I haven't trimmed it in probably
two<00:05:12.199> weeks<00:05:12.229> and<00:05:12.590> you<00:05:12.710> can<00:05:12.740> see<00:05:12.949> it's<00:05:13.070> still

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:13.220 
two weeks and you can see it's still

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:16.150 
two weeks and you can see it's still
pretty<00:05:13.400> compact<00:05:14.139> so<00:05:15.139> easily<00:05:15.530> my<00:05:15.830> favorite

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 
pretty compact so easily my favorite

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.159 
pretty compact so easily my favorite
carpet<00:05:16.430> plant<00:05:16.610> so<00:05:16.760> far<00:05:16.970> has<00:05:17.090> been<00:05:17.120> a<00:05:17.570> bellum

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:18.169 
carpet plant so far has been a bellum

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:20.080 
carpet plant so far has been a bellum
any<00:05:18.740> carpet<00:05:19.039> plant<00:05:19.340> you<00:05:19.430> decide<00:05:19.699> to<00:05:19.820> go<00:05:19.910> with

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.090 
any carpet plant you decide to go with
