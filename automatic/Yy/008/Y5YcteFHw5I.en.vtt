00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:08.970
 hello welcome guys in the new video 

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:12.090
 finally register and I registered indeed 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:15.690
 the video on how I made this 3 cell 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:19.230
 the hairstyle I had in my makeup 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:22.070
 christmas christmas I comb all the hair 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.660
 back and liszt all placed on one side 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:27.599
 if you help me and I do a line 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.359
 side and with the front side 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.309
 I try to make a nice twist 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.190
 taking all the hair by hand that 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.230
 I have around the forehead so that you in 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.120
 frames well and that this 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.079
 twisting remains attached to 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.840
 cute and i take a hairpin i am 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.000
 stop behind the ear and the block e 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:52.770
 the jolie, however, towards this 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.140
 hairpin slightly shot this 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.059
 twist to give him a little more 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.649
 volume then it's up to you if you want to do it more 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.649
 tight or not 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:08.320
 and now I start with the ear of braid and 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:12.220
 divides the hair into two parts and then 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:14.850
 premium on the one hand a small thing and 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:20.350
 takes her to another place 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:21.820
 same thing from the other side you can do 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.460
 what bigger than the ones I have 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:27.820
 done I also have what smaller the 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.259
 or even mix the two things the result 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.330
 it will always be nice 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:33.850
 I make a bong mix but I don't do them 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.670
 not too small either because there 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:39.280
 puts a life and a half I find that the 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.500
 part more in quotes too difficult 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:45.000
 because I don't really have manual skills 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:47.619
 if to the initial one when the 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.289
 the attachment of the spike braid yes 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:51.970
 must train because it is most 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:56.530
 of hair to the greatest amount of 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:59.860
 hair once you send it you see 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:02.740
 that you can go much faster 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.170
 in short, because the beginning of the braid e 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:08.399
 formed then capellini visit escape 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.399
 away from all sides 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.860
 marin giostrai 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.640
 who is it 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.080
 6 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:46.299
 I love this hairstyle the braid 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:50.579
 spiga is really an incredible thing 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:50.579
 then the block the braid with an elastic band 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:57.969
 and you remember the hairpin we can 

00:02:55.719 --> 00:02:59.980
 take it out without messing because i 

00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:02.590
 hair is stuck inside the 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:07.299
 braid the braid opens a little bit 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:09.519
 because so formed so on time ad 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:12.540
 aqaba i honestly don't like i like it 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:16.060
 a nice braid with a wide thorn and well 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:22.780
 messy frulli miagi on the voice 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:26.280
 over come here in short, I open it a little 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.280
 this is the result 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:30.540
 you can also play there 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.939
 and I find it really a hairstyle 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:40.040
 pretty and not at all difficult if there 

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:42.250
 I really can't do i 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.250
 tourists 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:51.599
 I greet you boy I send you a kiss and there 

00:03:48.249 --> 00:03:51.599
