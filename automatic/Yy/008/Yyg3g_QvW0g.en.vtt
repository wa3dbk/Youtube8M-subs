different<00:00:37.110> category<00:00:37.260> let's<00:00:37.890> bring<00:00:38.040> in<00:00:38.160> some

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
different category let's bring in some

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.729 
different category let's bring in some
bikes<00:00:38.750> in<00:00:39.750> this<00:00:39.930> case<00:00:40.140> it's<00:00:40.350> a<00:00:40.440> really

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
bikes in this case it's a really

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.100 
bikes in this case it's a really
thoughtful<00:00:41.070> design<00:00:41.430> with<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:41.910> 101<00:00:42.210> xn<00:00:42.719> and

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
thoughtful design with the 101 xn and

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.459 
thoughtful design with the 101 xn and
some<00:00:43.260> touches<00:00:43.649> that<00:00:44.450> push<00:00:45.450> innovation<00:00:46.110> and

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
some touches that push innovation and

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.680 
some touches that push innovation and
technology<00:00:47.309> on<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.550> off-road<00:00:47.940> side<00:00:48.180> in<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.539> way

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
technology on the off-road side in a way

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.260 
technology on the off-road side in a way
that's<00:00:49.640> uncommon<00:00:50.640> for<00:00:50.789> people<00:00:50.910> that<00:00:51.149> are

coming electronic is going to happen

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.340 
coming electronic is going to happen
there<00:01:17.610> are<00:01:17.820> ports<00:01:18.210> that<00:01:18.450> will<00:01:18.659> work<00:01:19.020> for<00:01:19.259> this

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
there are ports that will work for this

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.810 
there are ports that will work for this
with<00:01:19.560> electronic<00:01:20.159> whether<00:01:20.400> that's<00:01:20.640> your

finally<00:01:24.750> brings<00:01:24.960> that<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.290> market

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:26.799 
finally brings that to market

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:29.399 
finally brings that to market
in<00:01:27.490> the<00:01:27.670> same<00:01:27.880> way<00:01:28.120> we've<00:01:28.960> come<00:01:29.110> back<00:01:29.229> to<00:01:29.290> the

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
in the same way we've come back to the

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:30.149 
in the same way we've come back to the
dropout

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:30.159 
dropout

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:33.210

there's<00:01:30.729> replaceable<00:01:31.360> drop<00:01:31.570> out<00:01:31.780> so<00:01:32.110> on<00:01:32.799> the

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
there's replaceable drop out so on the

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:34.859 
there's replaceable drop out so on the
road<00:01:33.340> bikes<00:01:33.640> what<00:01:33.909> you<00:01:34.030> see<00:01:34.240> is<00:01:34.510> that<00:01:34.659> we<00:01:34.840> have

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:34.869 
road bikes what you see is that we have

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:36.870 
road bikes what you see is that we have
a<00:01:34.990> replaceable<00:01:35.560> drop<00:01:35.860> out<00:01:36.070> that<00:01:36.340> accommodates

for a hardtail something that's pretty

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:52.590 
for a hardtail something that's pretty
unique<00:01:50.470> but<00:01:50.830> I<00:01:50.860> think<00:01:51.100> is<00:01:51.220> really<00:01:51.600> long

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600

you'll<00:02:19.420> see<00:02:19.570> asymmetrical<00:02:20.320> chain<00:02:20.530> stays<00:02:20.769> and

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
you'll see asymmetrical chain stays and

you'll see asymmetrical chain stays and
seat<00:02:21.160> stays<00:02:21.400> on<00:02:21.610> this<00:02:21.760> to<00:02:22.000> properly<00:02:22.390> balance

so<00:02:26.530> you<00:02:26.590> can<00:02:26.709> see<00:02:26.800> the<00:02:26.890> different<00:02:27.160> sizes<00:02:27.550> the

we<00:02:35.860> think<00:02:35.980> it's<00:02:36.160> the<00:02:36.280> right<00:02:36.430> thing<00:02:36.640> to<00:02:36.670> do<00:02:36.910> we

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
we think it's the right thing to do we

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.090 
we think it's the right thing to do we
use<00:02:37.690> a<00:02:37.720> post<00:02:37.989> mount<00:02:38.200> derailleur<00:02:38.560> which<00:02:38.680> is

use a post mount derailleur which is
really<00:02:39.459> we<00:02:40.120> think<00:02:40.239> the<00:02:40.390> superior<00:02:40.780> designed

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
really we think the superior designed

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.960 
really we think the superior designed
for<00:02:41.380> adjustment<00:02:41.890> service<00:02:42.130> for<00:02:42.519> the<00:02:42.610> end<00:02:42.730> user
