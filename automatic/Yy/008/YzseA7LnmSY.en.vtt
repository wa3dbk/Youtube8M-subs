00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
minute and the reason that I like to put

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.179 
minute and the reason that I like to put
the<00:01:57.570> apples<00:01:57.689> in<00:01:58.020> before<00:01:58.439> it's<00:01:58.560> done<00:01:58.799> is

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
the apples in before it's done is

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.709 
the apples in before it's done is
because<00:01:59.549> when<00:01:59.729> your<00:01:59.820> microwave<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.360> apples

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
because when your microwave the apples

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.450 
because when your microwave the apples
are<00:02:00.840> going<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.020> get<00:02:01.140> a<00:02:01.170> little<00:02:01.350> softer<00:02:01.920> and<00:02:02.130> it

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
are going to get a little softer and it

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.730 
are going to get a little softer and it
won't<00:02:02.670> be<00:02:02.880> like<00:02:03.060> you're<00:02:03.240> eating<00:02:03.420> oatmeal<00:02:04.350> with

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
won't be like you're eating oatmeal with

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.139 
won't be like you're eating oatmeal with
something<00:02:05.070> really<00:02:05.310> crunchy<00:02:05.759> in<00:02:05.850> it

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
something really crunchy in it

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.089 
something really crunchy in it
that's<00:02:06.390> just<00:02:06.630> preference<00:02:06.899> you<00:02:07.619> could<00:02:07.799> add<00:02:07.979> the

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099
