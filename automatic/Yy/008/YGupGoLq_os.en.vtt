points are different I'm back looking at
the<00:02:23.930> capacity<00:02:24.319> of<00:02:24.860> the<00:02:25.730> batteries<00:02:26.239> I<00:02:26.540> know<00:02:26.690> I

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
the capacity of the batteries I know I

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.289 
the capacity of the batteries I know I
said<00:02:27.379> the<00:02:28.040> shapes<00:02:28.340> are<00:02:28.580> different<00:02:28.970> and<00:02:29.239> you

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:29.299 
said the shapes are different and you

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:32.740 
said the shapes are different and you
can<00:02:29.450> see<00:02:29.690> inside<00:02:30.940> the<00:02:31.940> different<00:02:32.360> number<00:02:32.629> of

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
can see inside the different number of

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.680 
can see inside the different number of
pins<00:02:33.190> over<00:02:34.190> there<00:02:34.340> you<00:02:34.519> got<00:02:34.640> four<00:02:35.060> in<00:02:35.360> the<00:02:35.480> same

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
pins over there you got four in the same

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.020 
pins over there you got four in the same
group<00:02:36.019> they're<00:02:36.349> um<00:02:36.620> the<00:02:37.250> older<00:02:37.610> model<00:02:37.909> you've

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
group they're um the older model you've

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.319 
group they're um the older model you've
got<00:02:38.180> three<00:02:38.540> and<00:02:38.920> another<00:02:39.920> one<00:02:40.400> over<00:02:40.700> here<00:02:40.730> it's

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:41.329 
got three and another one over here it's

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:43.630 
got three and another one over here it's
got<00:02:41.450> the<00:02:41.510> little<00:02:41.659> rubber<00:02:42.110> seal<00:02:42.500> which<00:02:43.340> makes

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
got the little rubber seal which makes

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.009 
got the little rubber seal which makes
it<00:02:43.819> waterproof<00:02:44.829> the<00:02:45.829> new<00:02:45.980> battery<00:02:46.430> is<00:02:47.019> 2100

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
new radio to the older one is by getting

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.680 
new radio to the older one is by getting
rid<00:03:48.650> of<00:03:48.680> some<00:03:48.980> of<00:03:49.010> the<00:03:49.099> buttons<00:03:49.430> now<00:03:50.090> these

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
rid of some of the buttons now these

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.640 
rid of some of the buttons now these
contain<00:03:51.560> a<00:03:51.799> number<00:03:52.430> of<00:03:52.730> secondary<00:03:53.720> functions

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
contain a number of secondary functions

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.069 
contain a number of secondary functions
so<00:03:55.190> again<00:03:55.489> by<00:03:55.790> turning<00:03:56.120> the<00:03:56.180> radio<00:03:56.329> only<00:03:56.900> use

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:57.079 
so again by turning the radio only use

00:03:57.079 --> 00:03:59.259 
so again by turning the radio only use
the<00:03:57.260> same<00:03:57.470> buttons<00:03:57.829> and<00:03:58.489> changing<00:03:59.180> the
