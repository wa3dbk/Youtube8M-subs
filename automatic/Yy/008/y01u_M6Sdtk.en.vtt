don't put this in
it'll<00:01:33.800> just<00:01:33.830> be<00:01:34.160> white<00:01:36.250> so<00:01:37.250> the<00:01:37.369> instructions

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:37.940 
it'll just be white so the instructions

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.240 
it'll just be white so the instructions
did<00:01:38.180> say<00:01:38.450> to<00:01:38.510> wait<00:01:38.990> till<00:01:39.260> it<00:01:39.380> got<00:01:39.500> up<00:01:39.619> to<00:01:39.650> 180

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
did say to wait till it got up to 180

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.969 
did say to wait till it got up to 180
and<00:01:40.580> I<00:01:41.000> did<00:01:41.210> do<00:01:41.390> this<00:01:41.600> and<00:01:41.900> my<00:01:42.080> balloon<00:01:42.470> popped

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
and I did do this and my balloon popped

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:48.100 
and I did do this and my balloon popped
so<00:01:43.610> I<00:01:43.940> suggest<00:01:44.510> going<00:01:44.930> around<00:01:45.729> 160<00:01:46.729> 165<00:01:47.450> and

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
so I suggest going around 160 165 and

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.170 
so I suggest going around 160 165 and
then<00:01:49.100> you're<00:01:49.250> just<00:01:49.310> going<00:01:49.520> to<00:01:49.640> dip<00:01:49.940> your

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
then you're just going to dip your

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.630 
then you're just going to dip your
balloon<00:01:50.540> in<00:01:50.810> and<00:01:51.160> each<00:01:52.160> layer<00:01:52.430> you're<00:01:52.610> going

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
balloon in and each layer you're going

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.550 
balloon in and each layer you're going
to<00:01:52.790> wait<00:01:52.970> for<00:01:53.180> it<00:01:53.270> to<00:01:53.360> dry<00:01:53.630> and<00:01:53.960> then<00:01:54.050> dip<00:01:54.440> it

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
to wait for it to dry and then dip it

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.130 
to wait for it to dry and then dip it
back<00:01:54.590> in<00:01:54.979> and<00:01:55.280> as<00:01:55.910> you<00:01:56.060> can<00:01:56.150> see<00:01:56.360> I<00:01:56.390> did<00:01:56.690> switch

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
back in and as you can see I did switch

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.800 
back in and as you can see I did switch
pots<00:01:57.470> because<00:01:57.860> the<00:01:58.520> other<00:01:58.850> one<00:01:59.149> was<00:01:59.539> getting

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
pots because the other one was getting

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.040 
pots because the other one was getting
too<00:02:00.410> hot<00:02:00.649> and<00:02:01.009> it<00:02:01.429> wasn't<00:02:01.640> deep<00:02:01.970> enough<00:02:02.300> so<00:02:02.570> in

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.050 
too hot and it wasn't deep enough so in

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:04.270 
too hot and it wasn't deep enough so in
the<00:02:03.140> middle<00:02:03.289> of<00:02:03.470> layers<00:02:03.740> you're<00:02:04.070> going<00:02:04.220> to

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
the middle of layers you're going to

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.310 
the middle of layers you're going to
want<00:02:04.490> to<00:02:04.550> just<00:02:04.789> place<00:02:05.300> it<00:02:05.330> onto<00:02:05.630> the<00:02:05.750> parchment

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
want to just place it onto the parchment

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.050 
want to just place it onto the parchment
paper<00:02:06.350> and<00:02:06.950> make<00:02:07.100> the<00:02:07.250> bottom<00:02:07.610> a<00:02:07.700> little<00:02:07.820> bit

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
paper and make the bottom a little bit

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.419 
paper and make the bottom a little bit
flat<00:02:08.390> and<00:02:08.690> then<00:02:09.440> you're<00:02:09.710> going<00:02:09.860> to<00:02:09.950> stick<00:02:10.220> it

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
flat and then you're going to stick it

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:12.430 
flat and then you're going to stick it
back<00:02:10.460> into<00:02:10.970> the<00:02:11.180> wax<00:02:11.390> and<00:02:11.750> keep<00:02:12.080> repeating

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
back into the wax and keep repeating

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.000 
back into the wax and keep repeating
this<00:02:12.770> it<00:02:13.130> probably<00:02:13.820> took<00:02:14.060> me<00:02:14.380> around<00:02:15.380> three

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
this it probably took me around three

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.700 
this it probably took me around three
minutes<00:02:16.250> or<00:02:16.610> so<00:02:16.820> to<00:02:17.180> get<00:02:17.330> like<00:02:17.600> the<00:02:18.080> thickness

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:18.710 
minutes or so to get like the thickness

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.070 
minutes or so to get like the thickness
that<00:02:18.740> I<00:02:18.980> wanted<00:02:19.430> you<00:02:19.640> want<00:02:19.790> around<00:02:19.880> 1/4<00:02:20.690> to<00:02:20.960> 1/2

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
that I wanted you want around 1/4 to 1/2

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.680 
that I wanted you want around 1/4 to 1/2
inch

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:34.080 

so<00:02:26.560> before<00:02:27.010> the<00:02:27.370> stones<00:02:28.290> I<00:02:29.790> just<00:02:30.790> wanna<00:02:31.000> ask<00:02:33.090> at

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
so before the stones I just wanna ask at

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.660 
so before the stones I just wanna ask at
this<00:02:34.270> point<00:02:34.630> my<00:02:34.930> arm<00:02:35.290> to<00:02:35.590> get<00:02:35.740> tired<00:02:36.010> so<00:02:36.400> I<00:02:36.430> did

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
this point my arm to get tired so I did

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.390 
this point my arm to get tired so I did
have<00:02:36.850> to<00:02:37.060> switch<00:02:37.360> hands<00:02:37.660> and<00:02:38.070> you<00:02:39.070> just<00:02:39.250> want

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
have to switch hands and you just want

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.650 
have to switch hands and you just want
to<00:02:39.460> keep<00:02:39.640> going<00:02:39.850> until<00:02:40.060> you<00:02:40.330> have<00:02:40.450> the<00:02:40.630> desired

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
to keep going until you have the desired

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.520 
to keep going until you have the desired
thickness<00:02:41.320> and<00:02:42.360> when<00:02:43.360> you<00:02:43.570> have<00:02:44.020> the<00:02:44.170> desired

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
thickness and when you have the desired

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:45.840 
thickness and when you have the desired
thickness<00:02:44.740> you're<00:02:45.160> going<00:02:45.310> to<00:02:45.400> want<00:02:45.520> to<00:02:45.580> put<00:02:45.760> it

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
thickness you're going to want to put it

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.910 
thickness you're going to want to put it
into<00:02:45.970> the<00:02:46.150> wax<00:02:46.360> and<00:02:46.750> then<00:02:47.380> put<00:02:47.590> it<00:02:47.680> straight

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
into the wax and then put it straight

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.340 
into the wax and then put it straight
onto<00:02:48.130> the<00:02:48.220> parchment<00:02:48.790> paper<00:02:48.820> so<00:02:49.690> it<00:02:49.960> gets<00:02:50.140> that

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
onto the parchment paper so it gets that

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.040 
onto the parchment paper so it gets that
flat<00:02:50.560> bottom<00:02:50.740> so<00:02:51.130> it<00:02:51.250> sits<00:02:51.550> and<00:02:51.970> you<00:02:52.720> just<00:02:52.840> want

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
flat bottom so it sits and you just want

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.740 
flat bottom so it sits and you just want
to<00:02:53.080> let<00:02:53.200> it<00:02:53.260> cool<00:02:53.380> down<00:02:53.620> this<00:02:54.520> is<00:02:54.820> footage<00:02:55.360> from

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
to let it cool down this is footage from

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.920 
to let it cool down this is footage from
the<00:02:56.350> other<00:02:56.590> balloon<00:02:57.430> I<00:02:57.760> did<00:02:58.000> because<00:02:58.900> I

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
the other balloon I did because I

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.140

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
to let it drain out this one didn't come

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.830

tea light inside of there and you want
to<00:03:14.770> use<00:03:14.890> flameless<00:03:15.340> because<00:03:15.730> we<00:03:15.880> didn't<00:03:16.090> use

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
to use flameless because we didn't use

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.510 
to use flameless because we didn't use
high<00:03:16.420> melt<00:03:16.720> paraffin<00:03:17.200> wax<00:03:17.410> and<00:03:17.830> it's<00:03:18.370> just
