 those students seem to have 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.529
 other way to travel 

00:02:35.529 --> 00:02:39.329

00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:59.389
 and there everything is encouraged by the intervention that others have gone through 

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:02.389
 it is not just about surviving 

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:04.959
 also points out that 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:08.789
 so I know if we will be what happened but it will happen thanks to one more 

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:09.629
 defense 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:13.120
 she serves up for free ahead of this time it will arrive at this time 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.220

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.639
 and so that in addition to the removal of the barricades raised hundreds of young women 

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:22.639
 in the journey of the red square had its state is not serious by what I saw today 

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:24.369
 leftover 

00:03:24.369 --> 00:03:29.749
 - it was an experience of him as it was done with the phrase of which were the 

00:03:29.749 --> 00:03:35.239
 difficulties in case the research ends appears in the agency to analyze and act 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:36.430
 differently 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.749
 it is through it that we identify 

00:03:39.749 --> 00:03:43.939
 trade union entities still have the history of control of the 

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:48.059
 direction to mark this meeting is no wonder to receive a plaque 

00:03:53.179 --> 00:03:56.939
 what use my father said in the end something very important that the 

00:03:56.939 --> 00:03:58.800
 growing open or we know 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.090
 thanks to this and to others that we have a homeland that kind of thing does not 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.199
 come back to happen before 

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:09.199
 to say good trip to them we usually 

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:13.499
 bring a person who experienced this experience unfortunately these people 

00:04:13.499 --> 00:04:15.049
 are increasingly 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:18.139
 in the race the center is a living legend 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:20.729
 all that they do not forgive 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:25.300
 practically - a lot of people believe that this happened this year 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.759
 basically 

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:31.529
 very difficult to imagine what really happened in the square and what they 

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:36.800
 do not forgive it, it really added up, I think it consecrated this group that goes 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.409
 travel bring the testimonial of a notorious public person a division receives 

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:43.170
 said he cared about the community 

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:46.300
 speak directly with what they will see and establish created 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.810
 during her life I think it's complicated
