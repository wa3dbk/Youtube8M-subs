added<00:00:58.289> one<00:00:58.500> hundred<00:00:59.239> now<00:01:00.239> we<00:01:00.780> could<00:01:00.989> add<00:01:01.730> 40

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
added one hundred now we could add 40

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:10.429 
added one hundred now we could add 40
that<00:01:04.860> will<00:01:04.979> get<00:01:05.100> me<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:06.500> 509<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:08.150> now<00:01:09.439> I've

still<00:01:10.740> got<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:10.979> add<00:01:11.159> eight<00:01:12.740> that<00:01:13.740> will<00:01:13.979> get<00:01:14.130> me

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
still got to add eight that will get me

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:21.499 
still got to add eight that will get me
to<00:01:15.290> 517<00:01:16.310> the<00:01:17.310> same<00:01:17.580> answer<00:01:18.619> but<00:01:20.000> you<00:01:21.000> might<00:01:21.270> be

to 517 the same answer but you might be

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.660 
to 517 the same answer but you might be
encouraged<00:01:22.409> to<00:01:22.530> use<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.770> number<00:01:23.159> line<00:01:23.340> another

encouraged to use a number line another
way<00:01:26.270> 369<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:28.140> start<00:01:28.439> with<00:01:29.150> question<00:01:30.150> remember

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
way 369 to start with question remember

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.270 
way 369 to start with question remember
is<00:01:30.680> 369<00:01:31.680> ad<00:01:32.060> 148<00:01:33.650> but<00:01:34.650> we<00:01:34.740> could<00:01:34.920> say<00:01:35.040> well<00:01:35.189> how

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
is 369 ad 148 but we could say well how

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.190 
is 369 ad 148 but we could say well how
far<00:01:35.520> is<00:01:35.640> it<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:35.970> next<00:01:36.119> hole<00:01:36.689> hundred<00:01:37.079> well

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
far is it to the next hole hundred well

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:44.510 
far is it to the next hole hundred well
that's<00:01:37.430> 400<00:01:38.430> so<00:01:38.549> that's<00:01:39.530> 31<00:01:42.470> so<00:01:43.470> we've<00:01:43.619> got<00:01:43.740> 148

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
that's 400 so that's 31 so we've got 148

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.760 
that's 400 so that's 31 so we've got 148
we've<00:01:44.640> added<00:01:44.790> 31<00:01:45.479> well<00:01:46.170> let's<00:01:46.350> just<00:01:46.530> look<00:01:46.619> at

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
we've added 31 well let's just look at

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:53.179 
we've added 31 well let's just look at
the<00:01:46.860> 48<00:01:47.399> we<00:01:48.060> could<00:01:48.210> add<00:01:48.920> 17<00:01:49.920> on<00:01:51.770> so<00:01:52.770> now<00:01:53.009> we've

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
the 48 we could add 17 on so now we've

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.200 
the 48 we could add 17 on so now we've
added<00:01:53.310> 48<00:01:54.030> or<00:01:54.210> together<00:01:54.479> that<00:01:54.689> gets<00:01:54.960> us<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:56.210> 417

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
added 48 or together that gets us to 417

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:03.550 
added 48 or together that gets us to 417
and<00:01:57.719> now<00:01:58.140> let's<00:01:58.979> add<00:01:59.100> that<00:01:59.460> final<00:01:59.909> hundred

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.230 

answer<00:02:05.270> 517

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
answer 517

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.999 
answer 517
now<00:02:07.630> that's<00:02:07.810> just<00:02:07.870> a<00:02:08.080> couple<00:02:08.259> of<00:02:08.410> ways<00:02:08.619> that<00:02:08.649> we

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
now that's just a couple of ways that we

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.510 
now that's just a couple of ways that we
could<00:02:09.369> do<00:02:09.580> it<00:02:09.700> with<00:02:10.209> a<00:02:10.240> number<00:02:10.630> line<00:02:11.250> very<00:02:12.250> good

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
could do it with a number line very good

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.240 
could do it with a number line very good
to<00:02:13.150> help<00:02:13.270> people<00:02:13.600> to<00:02:14.230> visualize<00:02:14.560> what<00:02:15.100> they're

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
to help people to visualize what they're

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.890 
to help people to visualize what they're
doing<00:02:15.520> and<00:02:15.670> is<00:02:16.150> very<00:02:16.300> good<00:02:16.569> for<00:02:16.720> mental

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
doing and is very good for mental

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.350 
doing and is very good for mental
arithmetic<00:02:17.370> but<00:02:18.370> children<00:02:18.640> also<00:02:19.150> need<00:02:19.330> a

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
arithmetic but children also need a

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.080 
arithmetic but children also need a
written<00:02:19.750> method<00:02:20.490> so<00:02:21.490> have<00:02:21.640> a<00:02:21.670> look<00:02:21.880> at<00:02:22.000> our

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
written method so have a look at our

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.990 
written method so have a look at our
video<00:02:22.450> clip<00:02:22.750> on<00:02:22.900> a<00:02:22.959> method<00:02:23.470> known<00:02:23.650> as

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
video clip on a method known as

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
