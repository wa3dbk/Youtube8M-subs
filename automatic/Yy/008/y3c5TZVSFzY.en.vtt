the device but you can do that also if
you<00:01:39.600> like<00:01:41.960> ok<00:01:42.960> let's<00:01:43.229> go<00:01:43.380> ahead<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:43.560> turn<00:01:43.740> on

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
you like ok let's go ahead and turn on

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.770 
you like ok let's go ahead and turn on
the<00:01:43.890> projector<00:01:44.780> and<00:01:46.939> we'll<00:01:47.939> take<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.450> look<00:01:48.630> at

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
the projector and we'll take a look at

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.130 
the projector and we'll take a look at
the<00:01:48.869> wall<00:01:49.020> here<00:01:50.270> up<00:01:51.270> to<00:01:51.509> dim<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.720> lights<00:01:51.990> for

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
the wall here up to dim the lights for

00:01:52.140 --> 00:02:00.560 
the wall here up to dim the lights for
this<00:01:52.290> part<00:01:56.810> now<00:01:58.729> we<00:01:59.729> can<00:01:59.909> see<00:02:00.119> that<00:02:00.299> the

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
this part now we can see that the

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.100 
this part now we can see that the
projector<00:02:01.469> has<00:02:01.560> come<00:02:01.770> up<00:02:01.920> and<00:02:02.630> it<00:02:03.630> lists<00:02:03.960> a

connect to it as well as a URL now

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.410 
connect to it as well as a URL now
remember<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.770> projector<00:02:11.190> itself<00:02:11.310> is<00:02:12.030> running

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420
