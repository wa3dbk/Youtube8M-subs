00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:04.790
 hello my beloved youtube family 

00:00:03.199 --> 00:00:07.009
 well, this video is a video 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:09.259
 request of a written means of my 

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:11.839
 channel asked me if you please 

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:14.330
 can you make an idea can you give a 

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:17.390
 idea of ​​invitations to party with 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.010
 theme or theme of rock and roll so 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.750
 Well, it occurred to me to make a 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:23.779
 very pretty invitation very original in 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:27.609
 shape of a nice guitar shaped like 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:27.609
 well a star not so dad 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:33.320
 Well, I hope you like this idea 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.210
 It is super easy to do simply because 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.730
 we're going to need things that everyone 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.590
 have at home and good because as you can see 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.750
 here you are in the form of a guitar and 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.539
 from the back we can put the 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.399
 name of our small or small the 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:47.780
 years that I will fulfill and here then all 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:50.510
 the information we want you 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.309
 put on this occasion I did it because no 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.140
 so big but you can do it 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:56.120
 smaller or larger the size that 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.680
 you want and then to deliver it 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.379
 as I always said we can put it 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.420
 a bag of cellophane with a bit 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:04.760
 Chinese paper or with sweet if you 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.500
 want so good if you liked this 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.550
 idea of 15 see how to do it because I do not know 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.830
 lose this 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.390
 where I will show you how to do what 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.910
 let's use to make this pretty 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.630
 guitar for our rock party and 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.430
 roll 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.080
 we are going to need of course some 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.000
 molds 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.480
 and they will find on my website 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.890
 facebook light separate bbc for 1990 here 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.750
 they go against this mold if they see 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.330
 you are simply going to cut it down 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:32.300
 piece and if they want to do it then 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:34.430
 different color like this time I did in 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:37.670
 the back of green simply 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:39.590
 cut everything around here our 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.290
 guitar and already if we want to do the 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:45.770
 in front of another color because here is this 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:48.740
 part of here or if you want to do it as 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:51.470
 it's in this case that I'm going to do the 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.240
 one color guitar and the front of another 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.310
 color then here is also the star 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.870
 so well these are my molds if 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.510
 you want to make your molds 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:02.690
 ahead or if they want to occupy then the 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:04.760
 figure of a guitar as common that is 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.530
 different then they can also go to 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.570
 internet and they dropped mold like you 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.280
 want and well then we're going to need 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.780
 just this mold as I told you 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.850
 can you find my facebook page 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.110
 also let's go to us let's do 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.720
 all scissors of course for 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.880
 treat our mold glue in bar 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.130
 and any decoration that you 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.930
 want to decorate your guitar 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:29.310
 and the only thing they have to do 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:32.310
 is to cut all by pieces if they see well 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.049
 I cut it myself then the base I'll 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.530
 cut here the star to make it 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:40.590
 rosadita in case it is a girl and returned to 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:43.379
 cut this part here so you go 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.099
 over here simply you with a 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:46.980
 marker 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:49.049
 in this case the gray permanent marker 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.069
 or it can also be with a proofreader already 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:54.900
 see that they come in pen do these 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:57.120
 lines that are going to be the strings of 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.590
 of our guitar if you 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.010
 want to be more professional you can 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.480
 put also tanza or transparent thread 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.709
 since it is to fish also what 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.260
 you can put you can do it 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:09.030
 Well how beautiful you want 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.219
 what I am here, I am simply giving you the 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.750
 idea and you decorate it for your 

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:16.139
 I know that you decorate it 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:19.130
 always always better than me so 

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:20.750
 good tense and luxurious and of 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.150
 you can do it too 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:27.040
 simply then stop it from your room 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.040
 If you do not want to occupy 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:33.329
 for invitation here we are going to put 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.329
 our star 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.750
 okay 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.260
 here 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.720
 well attached 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.900
 and then we're going to paste this part of 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.900
 here 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:03.030
 as I told them I did it with a marker 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:03.030
 permanent gray 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:08.330
 but you can occupy the color that 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:11.049
 the color that you want to make 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.049
 its ropes 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.909
 ok so 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:19.260
 If he has to stay here, he is not 

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:19.260
 holding the glue well 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:31.020
 well now here to do these little things 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.750
 of these little buttons that have the 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:36.530
 guitars I just here you cut 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.530
 some strips 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.490
 if you do not want to leave a small 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:45.130
 strips if you see and on the tip I'm 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:47.200
 putting a diamond of the color that is 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:49.060
 our star on this occasion then 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:52.960
 I'm putting what are pink and in 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:56.139
 the other I put white white here 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:58.110
 we are going to cut a little 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:00.830
 and just with a little bit of 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:03.260
 glue 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:08.890
 we are going to put them in each stadium and 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:08.890
 I just put three gray lines 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.950
 because the battle is not counted 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:22.969
 How many strings does a guitar have? 

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:22.969
 so I just put 3 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.020
 A) Yes 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:36.110
 and the truth is these invitations are super 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:38.600
 easy to make 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:40.670
 or must see that it made me easy 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:44.620
 since I'm not decorating it much if 

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:44.620
 come here I put three diamonds 

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:49.740
 A) Yes 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:52.380
 now here 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:54.330
 has some little things here the guitars do not 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:56.460
 I know what they are either, but I saw her 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:58.080
 an image and so they have so here 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:01.560
 we are also going to cut a small 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:04.699
 strip that is wider than our 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.699
 Band - aid of this black 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:11.760
 that is wider and we are going to put it 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.760
 there 

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:19.259
 so that we stay like this 

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:22.060
 very beautiful the guitar had a trick 

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:24.699
 now what they are going to do that by the 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:26.850
 back on this occasion well my 

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:29.650
 invitation is going to be black from behind 

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:32.080
 you can put him if you see here he goes to 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:34.449
 While being black can put all the 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:36.880
 information with permanent marker 

00:06:34.449 --> 00:06:40.600
 make it gray so that it looks or what 

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:43.360
 they can cut a star from another 

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:44.500
 white or pink and they already put their 

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.120
 information 

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:48.759
