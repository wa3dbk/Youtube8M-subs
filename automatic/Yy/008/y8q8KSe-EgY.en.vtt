00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.320 
the rocket launcher the cheesy shit
game<00:02:11.910> pretty<00:02:12.270> much<00:02:13.040> so<00:02:14.040> i<00:02:14.340> use<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:14.790> Oversoul

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
game pretty much so i use the Oversoul

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.839 
game pretty much so i use the Oversoul
when<00:02:15.540> I<00:02:15.569> could<00:02:16.069> look<00:02:17.069> at<00:02:17.190> that<00:02:17.310> shot<00:02:17.640> right

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
when I could look at that shot right

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:19.220 
when I could look at that shot right
there<00:02:17.879> I<00:02:18.030> could<00:02:18.269> believe<00:02:18.390> I<00:02:18.599> killed<00:02:18.660> that<00:02:18.959> guy

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
there I could believe I killed that guy

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.330
