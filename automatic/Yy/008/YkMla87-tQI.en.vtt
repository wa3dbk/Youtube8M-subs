Austin<00:00:27.240> I<00:00:27.359> wonder<00:00:27.630> if<00:00:27.689> he's<00:00:27.810> gonna<00:00:27.930> give<00:00:28.140> us<00:00:28.170> a

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
Austin I wonder if he's gonna give us a

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:34.400 
Austin I wonder if he's gonna give us a
stunner<00:00:28.650> yeah<00:00:29.369> but<00:00:30.119> I<00:00:32.930> don't<00:00:33.930> know<00:00:34.110> what<00:00:34.290> it<00:00:34.380> is

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
stunner yeah but I don't know what it is

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.030 
stunner yeah but I don't know what it is
but<00:00:34.530> I<00:00:34.770> guess<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.219> Unreal<00:00:35.550> Engine<00:00:35.820> is<00:00:36.300> just

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:37.040 
but I guess the Unreal Engine is just

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.590 
but I guess the Unreal Engine is just
not<00:00:38.040> very<00:00:38.370> good<00:00:38.550> on<00:00:38.940> console<00:00:39.480> because

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
not very good on console because

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.450 
not very good on console because

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.399 
ddr3 RAM and that's pretty nice it was
very<00:01:22.770> nice<00:01:22.979> I<00:01:23.430> think<00:01:24.420> when<00:01:24.600> I<00:01:24.630> got<00:01:24.869> this<00:01:25.110> like<00:01:25.380> a

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
very nice I think when I got this like a

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.460 
very nice I think when I got this like a
year<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:25.799> a<00:01:25.950> half<00:01:25.979> ago<00:01:26.280> I<00:01:26.670> think<00:01:27.470> something

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
year and a half ago I think something

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.080 
year and a half ago I think something
like<00:01:28.590> that<00:01:28.829> it<00:01:28.979> or<00:01:29.310> maybe<00:01:29.430> I've<00:01:29.579> had<00:01:29.759> it<00:01:29.880> longer

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
like that it or maybe I've had it longer

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.420 
like that it or maybe I've had it longer

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:46.040 
he'll go tank
I<00:01:40.920> guess<00:01:41.920> I'll<00:01:42.220> go<00:01:43.560> guess<00:01:44.560> I'll<00:01:44.710> go<00:01:44.860> assault

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.050 
I guess I'll go guess I'll go assault

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.850 
I guess I'll go guess I'll go assault
even<00:01:47.050> though<00:01:47.170> I'm<00:01:47.290> not<00:01:47.500> really<00:01:47.800> uh<00:01:48.090> whoa<00:01:49.860> yes

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
even though I'm not really uh whoa yes

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.530 
even though I'm not really uh whoa yes
they<00:01:51.040> gave<00:01:51.250> him<00:01:51.430> the<00:01:51.460> special<00:01:51.940> kids<00:01:52.180> helmet

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 
that's not cool well I guess the assault

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.260 
that's not cool well I guess the assault
is<00:01:55.450> pretty<00:01:55.780> special<00:01:56.050> but<00:01:56.790> especially<00:01:57.790> in<00:01:58.180> a

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270
