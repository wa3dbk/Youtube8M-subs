gigabyte<00:00:49.070> so<00:00:50.070> let's<00:00:51.059> open<00:00:51.329> it<00:00:51.510> up

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:20.660 

and<00:01:11.290> let's<00:01:11.530> remove<00:01:11.890> the<00:01:12.130> cellophane

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.580 

let's<00:01:21.360> open<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.320> lid

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.240 

well<00:01:27.590> so<00:01:28.750> straightaway<00:01:29.750> on<00:01:29.840> top<00:01:30.200> we<00:01:31.010> have<00:01:31.040> the

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
well so straightaway on top we have the

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.039 
well so straightaway on top we have the
iPad<00:01:31.760> itself<00:01:33.100> now<00:01:34.330> first<00:01:35.330> impression<00:01:35.869> is<00:01:35.990> that

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
iPad itself now first impression is that

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:37.960 
iPad itself now first impression is that
the<00:01:36.259> device<00:01:36.500> now<00:01:37.190> it<00:01:37.280> does<00:01:37.400> have<00:01:37.610> some<00:01:37.790> weight

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
the device now it does have some weight

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.080 
the device now it does have some weight
to<00:01:38.150> it<00:01:38.180> but<00:01:38.930> it's<00:01:39.170> definitely<00:01:39.670> not<00:01:40.670> going<00:01:41.000> to

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
to it but it's definitely not going to

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.230 
to it but it's definitely not going to
break<00:01:41.299> feels<00:01:41.720> very<00:01:41.960> sturdy<00:01:42.200> in<00:01:42.409> the<00:01:42.500> hand<00:01:42.710> and

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
break feels very sturdy in the hand and

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.020 
break feels very sturdy in the hand and
obviously<00:01:44.240> the<00:01:45.020> build<00:01:45.259> quality<00:01:45.440> is<00:01:45.680> fantastic

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
obviously the build quality is fantastic

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.230 
obviously the build quality is fantastic
so<00:01:47.030> it's<00:01:47.180> going<00:01:47.270> to<00:01:47.360> set<00:01:47.509> this<00:01:47.570> aside<00:01:48.880> so<00:01:49.880> we

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
so it's going to set this aside so we

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.280 
so it's going to set this aside so we
then<00:01:50.600> have<00:01:50.810> the<00:01:52.119> design<00:01:53.119> by<00:01:53.330> Apple<00:01:54.080> in

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
then have the design by Apple in

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.160 
then have the design by Apple in
California<00:01:55.149> and<00:01:56.149> this<00:01:56.360> should<00:01:56.540> just<00:01:56.840> contain

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
California and this should just contain

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.800 
California and this should just contain
some<00:01:57.470> general<00:01:57.920> user<00:01:58.820> information<00:01:59.270> and

hopefully some apple stickers as well so

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.710 
hopefully some apple stickers as well so

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.650 
we have the 9.7 inch capacitive
touchscreen<00:03:18.380> which<00:03:19.380> is<00:03:19.590> led<00:03:19.800> backlit<00:03:20.600> now<00:03:21.600> the

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
touchscreen which is led backlit now the

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.570 
touchscreen which is led backlit now the
screen<00:03:22.110> itself<00:03:22.380> has<00:03:22.740> something<00:03:23.280> called<00:03:23.400> an

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
screen itself has something called an

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.260 
screen itself has something called an
oleophobic<00:03:23.880> coating<00:03:24.140> and<00:03:25.140> this<00:03:25.350> is<00:03:25.970> there<00:03:26.970> to

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
oleophobic coating and this is there to

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.630 
oleophobic coating and this is there to
reduce<00:03:27.810> the<00:03:27.960> number<00:03:28.200> of<00:03:28.230> fingerprints<00:03:28.800> but<00:03:29.430> as

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
reduce the number of fingerprints but as

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.510 
reduce the number of fingerprints but as
you<00:03:29.820> see<00:03:30.030> from<00:03:30.210> other<00:03:30.540> videos<00:03:30.900> and<00:03:31.250> as<00:03:32.250> you<00:03:32.370> can

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
you see from other videos and as you can

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
you see from other videos and as you can
see<00:03:32.550> now<00:03:32.910> this<00:03:33.720> is<00:03:34.110> a<00:03:34.530> fingerprint<00:03:35.130> magnet<00:03:35.540> so

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
see now this is a fingerprint magnet so

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.780 
see now this is a fingerprint magnet so
in<00:03:37.350> regards<00:03:37.560> parts<00:03:38.010> and<00:03:38.100> functions<00:03:38.280> on<00:03:38.760> the
