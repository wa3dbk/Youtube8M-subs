00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
on this helicopter quality wise I do not

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.880 
on this helicopter quality wise I do not
doubt<00:03:12.000> Walcheren<00:03:12.540> now<00:03:12.810> their<00:03:13.200> quality<00:03:13.710> has

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
doubt Walcheren now their quality has

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:14.690 
doubt Walcheren now their quality has
improved<00:03:13.920> a<00:03:14.430> lot

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
let's look inside under the hood

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.030 
let's look inside under the hood
everything<00:03:18.630> is<00:03:18.750> very<00:03:18.930> simple<00:03:19.290> won't<00:03:19.830> care<00:03:20.010> a

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
everything is very simple won't care a

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.340 
everything is very simple won't care a
digital<00:03:20.520> service<00:03:20.760> and<00:03:21.300> what<00:03:21.870> we<00:03:21.990> want<00:03:22.140> to<00:03:22.230> look

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
digital service and what we want to look

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.010 
digital service and what we want to look
at<00:03:22.530> now<00:03:22.770> is<00:03:22.800> the<00:03:23.370> motors<00:03:23.730> so<00:03:24.240> we<00:03:24.540> have<00:03:24.750> a<00:03:24.780> wok

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.020 
at now is the motors so we have a wok

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.800 
at now is the motors so we have a wok
here<00:03:25.260> a<00:03:25.290> brushless<00:03:25.680> motor<00:03:26.240> let<00:03:27.240> me<00:03:27.390> see<00:03:27.600> if<00:03:27.720> I

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
here a brushless motor let me see if I

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.920 
here a brushless motor let me see if I
can<00:03:28.020> see<00:03:28.200> the<00:03:28.320> kV<00:03:28.740> on<00:03:28.890> it<00:03:29.180> yep<00:03:30.180> here<00:03:30.600> we<00:03:30.630> are

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
can see the kV on it yep here we are

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.190 
can see the kV on it yep here we are
it's<00:03:31.260> a<00:03:31.530> 4000<00:03:32.250> kV<00:03:32.520> motor<00:03:32.700> Wow<00:03:33.390> now<00:03:33.840> this<00:03:34.020> thing

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
it's a 4000 kV motor Wow now this thing

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.560 
it's a 4000 kV motor Wow now this thing
is<00:03:34.290> gonna<00:03:34.410> rip<00:03:34.620> some<00:03:34.800> sweet<00:03:35.100> 3d<00:03:35.880> I<00:03:35.910> think<00:03:36.300> and

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
is gonna rip some sweet 3d I think and

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.040 
is gonna rip some sweet 3d I think and
let's<00:03:37.230> look<00:03:37.470> at<00:03:37.680> the<00:03:38.270> speed<00:03:39.270> controller<00:03:39.690> which

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.050 
let's look at the speed controller which

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:43.790 
let's look at the speed controller which
looks<00:03:40.320> like<00:03:40.560> 20a<00:03:41.510> okay<00:03:42.510> so<00:03:42.570> this<00:03:42.930> is<00:03:43.110> 28<00:03:43.440> speed

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
looks like 20a okay so this is 28 speed

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.530 
looks like 20a okay so this is 28 speed

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.040 
parts quality I'm not doubting the world
carrier<00:03:53.459> parts<00:03:53.790> quality<00:03:54.240> now<00:03:54.360> their<00:03:54.630> quality

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
carrier parts quality now their quality

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.050 
carrier parts quality now their quality
has<00:03:55.200> improved<00:03:55.230> a<00:03:55.740> lot<00:03:56.040> all<00:03:56.400> the<00:03:56.459> time<00:03:56.670> actually

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
has improved a lot all the time actually

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.540 
has improved a lot all the time actually
the<00:03:57.630> new<00:03:57.780> helicopters<00:03:58.410> are<00:03:58.680> actually<00:03:59.190> very

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
the new helicopters are actually very

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.370 
the new helicopters are actually very
nice<00:03:59.790> quality<00:04:00.300> helicopters<00:04:00.870> and<00:04:01.110> their

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
nice quality helicopters and their

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.110 
nice quality helicopters and their
performance<00:04:01.890> is<00:04:02.010> also<00:04:02.340> really<00:04:02.610> really<00:04:02.790> good

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
performance is also really really good

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.820 
performance is also really really good
so<00:04:03.600> now<00:04:03.720> I'm<00:04:03.780> going<00:04:03.959> to<00:04:04.020> bring<00:04:04.170> my<00:04:04.350> dimensions

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
so now I'm going to bring my dimensions

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.850 
so now I'm going to bring my dimensions
8<00:04:04.980> out<00:04:05.250> here<00:04:05.670> and<00:04:05.910> start<00:04:06.360> doing<00:04:06.540> the<00:04:06.990> setup<00:04:07.380> I'm

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 
8 out here and start doing the setup I'm

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.800 
8 out here and start doing the setup I'm
gonna<00:04:08.130> set<00:04:08.459> up<00:04:08.640> the<00:04:08.820> pitch<00:04:09.000> curves<00:04:09.390> and<00:04:09.480> total

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
gonna set up the pitch curves and total

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.830 
gonna set up the pitch curves and total
curves<00:04:10.020> on<00:04:10.230> setup<00:04:10.560> this<00:04:10.709> helicopter<00:04:11.040> right<00:04:11.490> on

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
curves on setup this helicopter right on

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.180 
curves on setup this helicopter right on
dimension<00:04:12.840> radio<00:04:13.200> and<00:04:13.410> then<00:04:13.560> we<00:04:13.680> will<00:04:13.800> go<00:04:13.980> out

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
dimension radio and then we will go out

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.000 
dimension radio and then we will go out
and<00:04:14.459> rip<00:04:15.180> some<00:04:15.420> 3d<00:04:15.690> on<00:04:15.810> this<00:04:16.020> helicopter<00:04:16.380> stay

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
and rip some 3d on this helicopter stay

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.209
