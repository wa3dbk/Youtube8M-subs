00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
 The exist four types of face 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.660
 have oval round square I think and we 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.599
 it really exist much more 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.969
 yes ok so here are the big basic ones 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.980
 the oval is always the ideal pads 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.509
 where people are working towards 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.580
 I have the people with a round 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.090
 relationship on the square faces and the 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.430
 rectangular face there is someone now 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.930
 ever came up with the idea of rules there 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.930
 to capture and nobody ever has 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.910
 said oval is the ideal image in ours 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.199
 beauty theory 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.420
 I am also always the first to cancel 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.700
 rules are there to break or 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.770
 something like that just to make it easy 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.800
 yes let's work towards the oval face 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.750
 And yes everywhere is the ideal beauty 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.820
 yes image of cameron diaz for example 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.000
 is said to be a young square 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.469
 has face I want to say that 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.020
 she then comes with harder work with 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.120
 very short hair double say especially if 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.370
 you want the photos and view the square 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.309
 say the jaw line below 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.559
 quite wide is that the sides to all 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.789
 on the right and you saw over the and 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:05.489
 carrie hairstyle rakuten where the length 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.439
 just on that line that flatters not 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.540
 That does not work 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.369
 but if someone is happier about it 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.180
 become them then he absolutely must do there 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.610
 yes french 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.220
 yes now a round face what do you do then 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.009
 best if you are really a bit of a sphere 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.540
 face have a round face or one 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.979
 convex face is actually the golden rule 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.000
 to always have the width a bit too 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.430
 try to camouflage 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.189
 so don't go broadening 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.170
 so certainly no volume on the sides 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.600
 flatter work to the face to 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.680
 possibly and the hair that back or side 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.329
 in the neck 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.740
 also always helps to form the long one 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.479
 bit the round of a bit too 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.930
 camouflage and so closely to longer form 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.390
 to create 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.030
 yes it is very simple theory says 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.799
 work to the oval so copy it 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.020
 oval and everything that falls outside of it 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.399
 try to camouflage as much as possible 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.409
 ok we have another one I know that 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.799
 osborne 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:57.499
 a famous actress who is her face 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:59.719
 actually a bit wider undecided 

00:01:57.499 --> 00:02:02.569
 offer and yes but I say so 

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:04.189
 pear-shaped absolute yes that is also absolute 

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:05.479
 and forming fucks about it 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:07.759
 a very clearly pronounced 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:09.440
 pear shaped leaves it is especially the 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:10.729
 face drawing so you will 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.920
 then also see that they have tried to 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.690
 create more volume at the top for that 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.140
 sharpness of the top too 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.140
 compile
