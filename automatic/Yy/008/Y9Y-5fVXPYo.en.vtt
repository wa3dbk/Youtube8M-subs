00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.780
 Sold for about 10 years 

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:10.899
 After the original legacy 

00:00:10.899 --> 00:00:13.979
 The second generation of Legacy has appeared 

00:00:13.979 --> 00:00:16.979
 October 1993 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:21.329
 Extend the wheel base by 50 mm 

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:24.659
 260032 

00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:27.659
 If you improve the habitability to the first generation 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.819
 Expansion of the full width 

00:00:30.819 --> 00:00:33.260
 With 160095 mm 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.150
 5 mm 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.150
 5 pieces of white sesame 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.160
 This second generation of Legacy 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.940
 Same as the first generation 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.940
 Sedan and touring had their main line of business lineup 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.400
 However 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.400
 By the explosive hit of the first touring wagon 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.820
 In the second generation 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.300
 Touring wagon is the main model 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.930
 Sedan model is 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.930
 It is not possible for someone to become a supporting player 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.970
 New Legacy Touring Wagon 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.320
 The top group was located 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.470
 After all it was area 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.220
 That engine 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.230
 It is 2 liters horizontally opposed 4-cylinder turbo 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.940
 Same as the first generation 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.230
 Par 5 is 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.290
 From single type 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.290
 The two-stage twin turbo had eight breaks 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.830
 By this improvement 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.010
 Turbo charging efficiency rises 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:34.380
 The output is 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.430
 2150 horsepower 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.750
 It is powered up to 31.5 kg meter 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.780
 Second generation of Legacy Touring Wagon 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.660
 The highlight is 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.950
 Debuted at a minor change in June 1996 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.640
 It's gtd 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.940
 In the history of legacy 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.210
 It is the first time to achieve 280 horsepower 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.950
 With this gtv 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.250
 Its power performance is 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.250
 It was overwhelming as the wagon of those days 

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:12.279
 Good photos were also playing a role there 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.109
 The gtd beat is 

00:02:17.109 --> 00:02:19.629
 Famous for shock absorbers 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:22.729
 Bilstein's initial letter 

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:25.729
 This Bilstein inverted damper is 

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:29.699
 Coupled with the body rigidity originally seems high 

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:33.859
 I found an exquisite ride 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:37.939
 This gtd is 

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:40.029
 As of that time 

00:02:40.029 --> 00:02:43.029
 I have been wearing a 17-inch wheel 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:47.709
 Demonstrated the appeal of help for car users who are driving 

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:50.899
 By the way 

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:54.069
 I did not achieve exactly the same evolution as this gtd 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:57.869
 Are you 

00:02:57.869 --> 00:03:01.389
 It was a maniac hidden behind gtd 

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:04.919
 It is this car 

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:07.739
 Flowering in the third generation Legacy 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:09.449
 It is the basis of bfo
