00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
does the / HR /

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.130 
does the / HR /
so<00:02:27.370> that's<00:02:27.820> pretty<00:02:28.330> simple<00:02:28.570> if<00:02:28.780> you've<00:02:28.930> been

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
so that's pretty simple if you've been

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.280 
so that's pretty simple if you've been
to<00:02:29.290> him<00:02:29.440> but<00:02:30.070> just<00:02:30.750> marriages<00:02:31.750> are<00:02:32.050> gonna

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
to him but just marriages are gonna

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.480 
to him but just marriages are gonna

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
good example and a bad example but why

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.240 
good example and a bad example but why
you<00:03:07.720> want<00:03:07.960> to<00:03:08.050> gather<00:03:08.230> is<00:03:08.560> because<00:03:08.950> you<00:03:09.130> have

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
you want to gather is because you have

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.240 
you want to gather is because you have
to<00:03:09.460> AOE<00:03:09.850> ice<00:03:10.420> down<00:03:11.080> as<00:03:11.380> fast<00:03:11.710> as<00:03:11.920> you<00:03:11.950> can

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
to AOE ice down as fast as you can

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.650 
to AOE ice down as fast as you can
within<00:03:13.060> 10<00:03:13.390> seconds<00:03:14.100> because<00:03:15.420> the<00:03:16.420> eyes<00:03:16.630> are

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
within 10 seconds because the eyes are

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.820 
within 10 seconds because the eyes are
going<00:03:17.650> to<00:03:17.740> explode<00:03:18.370> if<00:03:18.760> an<00:03:19.480> eye<00:03:19.930> is<00:03:20.320> sitting<00:03:20.740> on

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
going to explode if an eye is sitting on

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:22.980 
going to explode if an eye is sitting on
top<00:03:20.890> of<00:03:21.100> a<00:03:21.310> player<00:03:21.550> for<00:03:22.000> more<00:03:22.180> than<00:03:22.300> 10<00:03:22.540> seconds

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:22.990 
top of a player for more than 10 seconds

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.710 
top of a player for more than 10 seconds
so<00:03:23.920> you<00:03:24.010> have<00:03:24.130> to<00:03:24.340> AOE<00:03:24.640> them<00:03:24.940> down<00:03:25.180> real<00:03:25.480> quick

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
so you have to AOE them down real quick

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.140 
so you have to AOE them down real quick
now<00:03:26.680> in<00:03:26.980> the<00:03:27.190> clip<00:03:27.430> as<00:03:27.640> you<00:03:27.760> can<00:03:27.910> see<00:03:28.120> right

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
now in the clip as you can see right

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.580 
now in the clip as you can see right
here<00:03:28.720> I<00:03:28.870> died<00:03:29.350> because<00:03:29.860> he<00:03:30.490> used<00:03:31.030> enrage<00:03:31.590> door

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
here I died because he used enrage door

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.449 
here I died because he used enrage door
because<00:03:32.950> we<00:03:33.280> simply<00:03:33.490> kill<00:03:33.850> them<00:03:34.060> too<00:03:34.540> slow<00:03:35.459> so

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
because we simply kill them too slow so

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:39.330 
because we simply kill them too slow so
that's<00:03:36.640> also<00:03:36.880> an<00:03:37.120> ability<00:03:37.420> does<00:03:37.930> but<00:03:38.800> as<00:03:39.070> you

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
that's also an ability does but as you

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.280 
that's also an ability does but as you
can<00:03:39.459> see<00:03:39.670> he<00:03:39.940> cast<00:03:40.180> eyes<00:03:40.480> of<00:03:40.660> our<00:03:40.810> teeth<00:03:40.959> or<00:03:41.140> now

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
can see he cast eyes of our teeth or now

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.360 
can see he cast eyes of our teeth or now
and<00:03:41.970> the<00:03:42.970> person<00:03:43.600> in<00:03:44.050> the<00:03:44.260> middle<00:03:44.290> right<00:03:45.190> in

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
and the person in the middle right in

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:46.470 
and the person in the middle right in
front<00:03:45.580> of<00:03:45.670> me<00:03:45.790> as<00:03:45.880> you<00:03:46.000> can<00:03:46.120> see<00:03:46.270> he<00:03:46.450> just

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
front of me as you can see he just

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.110 
front of me as you can see he just
stands<00:03:47.020> there<00:03:47.080> he<00:03:47.680> doesn't<00:03:47.920> gather<00:03:48.190> of<00:03:48.490> course

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
stands there he doesn't gather of course

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.460 
stands there he doesn't gather of course
you<00:03:49.270> would<00:03:49.420> have<00:03:49.540> lost<00:03:49.690> anyway<00:03:49.900> and<00:03:50.380> that's

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
you would have lost anyway and that's

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.440 
you would have lost anyway and that's
why<00:03:50.680> it<00:03:50.740> doesn't<00:03:51.100> gather<00:03:51.220> but<00:03:51.880> this<00:03:52.209> is<00:03:52.420> just

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
why it doesn't gather but this is just

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.270 
why it doesn't gather but this is just
an<00:03:52.900> example<00:03:53.020> of<00:03:53.530> what<00:03:53.740> you're<00:03:53.860> not<00:03:54.040> supposed

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
an example of what you're not supposed

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.970 
an example of what you're not supposed
to<00:03:54.550> do<00:03:54.730> as<00:03:55.090> you<00:03:55.660> can<00:03:55.780> see<00:03:55.990> they<00:03:56.200> explode<00:03:56.709> and

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
to do as you can see they explode and

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.750 
to do as you can see they explode and
everybody<00:03:57.730> just<00:03:57.940> dies<00:03:58.209> instantly<00:03:59.310> so<00:04:00.310> that's

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
everybody just dies instantly so that's

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.930 
everybody just dies instantly so that's
a<00:04:00.910> bad<00:04:01.180> example<00:04:02.040> now<00:04:03.040> in<00:04:03.340> this<00:04:03.459> clip<00:04:03.670> as<00:04:03.850> you

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
a bad example now in this clip as you

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.240 
a bad example now in this clip as you

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:13.570 
there and we start to make as much a OE

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:16.349 
there and we start to make as much a OE
as<00:04:13.900> we<00:04:14.200> can<00:04:14.440> i<00:04:14.650> save<00:04:15.010> the<00:04:15.310> cooldown<00:04:15.790> for<00:04:16.150> that
