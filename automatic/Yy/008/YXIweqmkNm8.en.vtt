the<00:00:16.650> game<00:00:17.000> but<00:00:18.000> that<00:00:18.180> hasn't<00:00:18.390> stopped<00:00:18.900> them

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
the game but that hasn't stopped them

DK<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.689> support<00:00:22.289> so<00:00:22.890> radial<00:00:23.880> G<00:00:24.000> is<00:00:24.150> sort<00:00:24.359> of

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
DK to support so radial G is sort of

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.150 
DK to support so radial G is sort of
like<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:24.539> futuristic<00:00:24.990> racing<00:00:25.410> game<00:00:25.800> as<00:00:25.949> you<00:00:26.010> can

that loading screen not rift not set up
for<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.860> rift<00:00:56.039> which<00:00:56.309> is<00:00:56.460> ok<00:00:57.230> but<00:00:58.230> I<00:00:58.289> will<00:00:58.530> say

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
for the rift which is ok but I will say

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.689 
for the rift which is ok but I will say
it<00:00:59.609> is<00:00:59.640> very<00:01:00.149> very<00:01:00.270> jarring<00:01:01.190> so<00:01:02.190> what<00:01:02.399> I<00:01:02.430> like

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
it is very very jarring so what I like

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:03.889 
it is very very jarring so what I like
to<00:01:02.730> do<00:01:03.000> when<00:01:03.149> something<00:01:03.539> like<00:01:03.690> this<00:01:03.719> happens

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
to do when something like this happens

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.160 
to do when something like this happens
where<00:01:04.680> it's<00:01:04.890> clearly<00:01:05.280> not<00:01:05.400> an<00:01:05.760> image<00:01:06.090> set<00:01:07.049> up

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
where it's clearly not an image set up

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.590 
where it's clearly not an image set up
for<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.470> rift<00:01:07.650> is<00:01:07.830> I<00:01:08.280> close<00:01:08.580> one<00:01:08.850> eye<00:01:08.880> almost

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
for the rift is I close one eye almost

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.179 
for the rift is I close one eye almost
immediately<00:01:10.110> because<00:01:10.409> I've<00:01:10.530> noticed<00:01:10.890> with<00:01:10.979> my

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
immediately because I've noticed with my

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.080 
immediately because I've noticed with my
time<00:01:11.400> with<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.670> demos<00:01:12.000> I<00:01:13.340> don't<00:01:14.340> get<00:01:14.580> nauseous

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.850 
alright so as you can see we're here in
a<00:01:36.570> cockpit<00:01:36.810> of<00:01:37.170> a<00:01:37.439> racer<00:01:38.329> it's<00:01:39.329> got<00:01:39.860> positional

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
a cockpit of a racer it's got positional

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.310 
a cockpit of a racer it's got positional
tracking<00:01:40.890> so<00:01:41.520> I<00:01:41.549> can<00:01:41.729> lean<00:01:41.939> in<00:01:42.150> I<00:01:42.390> could<00:01:43.079> take<00:01:43.290> a

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
tracking so I can lean in I could take a

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.770 
tracking so I can lean in I could take a
look<00:01:43.890> over<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.189> side<00:01:44.549> it's<00:01:44.939> clearly<00:01:45.390> a<00:01:45.479> big

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
look over the side it's clearly a big

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.560 
look over the side it's clearly a big
futuristic<00:01:46.820> dome<00:01:49.070> it's<00:01:50.070> interesting<00:01:50.460> I<00:01:51.000> kind

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
futuristic dome it's interesting I kind

futuristic dome it's interesting I kind
of<00:01:51.780> feel<00:01:52.049> constrained<00:01:52.740> by<00:01:53.070> this<00:01:53.369> sort<00:01:54.180> of<00:01:54.240> grid

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
of feel constrained by this sort of grid

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.940 
of feel constrained by this sort of grid
here<00:01:55.310> for<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.399> cockpit<00:01:56.880> which<00:01:57.659> again<00:01:58.649> also

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
here for the cockpit which again also

here for the cockpit which again also
when<00:01:59.219> I<00:01:59.250> do<00:01:59.340> something<00:01:59.670> like<00:01:59.880> this<00:02:00.210> I<00:02:00.420> expect

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
when I do something like this I expect

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.389 
when I do something like this I expect
to<00:02:00.810> see<00:02:00.960> my<00:02:01.079> hand<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:01.500> when<00:02:01.619> I<00:02:01.649> don't<00:02:02.009> it's

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
to see my hand and when I don't it's

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.980 
to see my hand and when I don't it's
really<00:02:02.670> jarring<00:02:03.799> the

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
really jarring the

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.790 
really jarring the
positional<00:02:06.990> tracking<00:02:07.020> is<00:02:07.410> really<00:02:07.650> cool

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
positional tracking is really cool

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.560 
positional tracking is really cool
because<00:02:07.950> I<00:02:08.160> could<00:02:08.310> do<00:02:08.369> things<00:02:08.610> like<00:02:08.820> look<00:02:09.390> out

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:09.570 
because I could do things like look out

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:11.060 
because I could do things like look out
the<00:02:09.780> window<00:02:10.140> peer<00:02:10.470> out<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:10.710> window<00:02:10.950> a<00:02:10.979> little

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.070 
the window peer out the window a little

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.440 
the window peer out the window a little
bit<00:02:11.430> oh<00:02:12.470> there<00:02:13.470> we<00:02:14.400> could<00:02:14.550> also<00:02:14.700> look<00:02:15.030> behind

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
bit oh there we could also look behind

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.310 
bit oh there we could also look behind

Kickstarter radial gee I can hitting the

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.100 
Kickstarter radial gee I can hitting the
mic<00:02:21.810> again<00:02:22.610> ok<00:02:23.610> let's<00:02:24.330> get<00:02:24.450> this<00:02:24.510> all<00:02:24.780> set<00:02:25.050> up

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
mic again ok let's get this all set up

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.290 
mic again ok let's get this all set up
ready<00:02:25.700> let's<00:02:26.700> race<00:02:27.950> hold<00:02:28.950> on<00:02:29.070> centered<00:02:29.670> it<00:02:29.790> ok

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
ready let's race hold on centered it ok

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:36.770 
ready let's race hold on centered it ok
now<00:02:30.630> let's<00:02:30.660> race<00:02:33.710> my<00:02:34.710> right<00:02:34.920> trigger<00:02:35.250> is<00:02:35.780> my

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
now let's race my right trigger is my

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.350 
now let's race my right trigger is my
acceleration<00:02:37.590> the<00:02:38.550> first<00:02:38.820> time<00:02:38.970> I<00:02:39.000> tried<00:02:39.330> this

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
acceleration the first time I tried this

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.940 
acceleration the first time I tried this
setting<00:02:39.840> it<00:02:39.959> up<00:02:40.020> I<00:02:40.140> didn't<00:02:40.350> have<00:02:40.440> any<00:02:40.590> audio

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
setting it up I didn't have any audio

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.240 
setting it up I didn't have any audio
and<00:02:41.280> so<00:02:41.550> that<00:02:41.700> was<00:02:41.820> really<00:02:41.850> jarring<00:02:42.540> and

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
and so that was really jarring and

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.560 
and so that was really jarring and
really<00:02:44.250> took<00:02:44.370> me<00:02:44.550> out<00:02:44.640> of<00:02:44.670> the<00:02:44.760> moment<00:02:45.120> now<00:02:45.540> I

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
really took me out of the moment now I

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.540 
really took me out of the moment now I
feel<00:02:46.050> much<00:02:46.230> more<00:02:46.500> in<00:02:46.740> the<00:02:46.860> moment<00:02:47.010> now<00:02:47.370> that<00:02:47.520> I

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
feel much more in the moment now that I

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.449 
feel much more in the moment now that I
have<00:02:47.700> audio<00:02:48.290> so<00:02:49.290> I'm<00:02:49.380> sort<00:02:49.560> of<00:02:49.709> stuck<00:02:49.890> on<00:02:50.280> to

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
have audio so I'm sort of stuck on to

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:55.600 
have audio so I'm sort of stuck on to
this<00:02:51.560> cylindrical<00:02:52.560> track<00:02:53.250> here

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
this cylindrical track here

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.050 
this cylindrical track here
oh<00:02:55.670> we<00:02:56.480> hit<00:02:56.600> the<00:02:56.720> barrier<00:02:57.670> really<00:02:58.670> it's<00:02:58.880> the

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
oh we hit the barrier really it's the

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.970 
oh we hit the barrier really it's the
simplest<00:02:59.510> race<00:02:59.780> and<00:03:00.050> I<00:03:00.140> somehow<00:03:00.410> mess<00:03:00.710> it<00:03:00.890> up

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
simplest race and I somehow mess it up

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.390 
simplest race and I somehow mess it up
now<00:03:02.290> this<00:03:03.290> is<00:03:03.440> an<00:03:03.560> interesting<00:03:03.620> case<00:03:04.130> of

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
now this is an interesting case of

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.700 
now this is an interesting case of
virtual<00:03:04.730> reality<00:03:04.820> in<00:03:05.450> that<00:03:05.690> I<00:03:06.020> don't<00:03:06.500> find

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:06.710 
virtual reality in that I don't find

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:10.330 
virtual reality in that I don't find
myself<00:03:06.920> moving<00:03:07.520> my<00:03:07.790> head<00:03:07.970> a<00:03:08.030> whole<00:03:08.270> lot<00:03:09.340> maybe

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
myself moving my head a whole lot maybe

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.450 
myself moving my head a whole lot maybe
I<00:03:10.490> should<00:03:10.850> not<00:03:11.060> stop<00:03:11.360> hitting<00:03:11.630> those<00:03:11.750> barriers

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:12.460 
I should not stop hitting those barriers

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.310 
I should not stop hitting those barriers
I'm<00:03:13.460> more<00:03:13.790> or<00:03:13.910> less<00:03:14.090> just<00:03:14.120> looking<00:03:14.780> forward

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
I'm more or less just looking forward

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.030 
I'm more or less just looking forward
and<00:03:15.520> this<00:03:16.520> is<00:03:16.670> where<00:03:16.880> like<00:03:17.360> the<00:03:18.040> positional

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
and this is where like the positional

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.540 
and this is where like the positional
tracking<00:03:19.070> and<00:03:19.730> the<00:03:21.040> directional<00:03:22.040> tracking

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:22.550 
tracking and the directional tracking

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:25.000 
tracking and the directional tracking
sort<00:03:23.060> of<00:03:23.180> take<00:03:23.870> the<00:03:24.080> backseat<00:03:24.290> and<00:03:24.830> what

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
sort of take the backseat and what

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.970 
sort of take the backseat and what
really<00:03:25.250> adds<00:03:25.640> to<00:03:25.880> the<00:03:26.180> emergent<00:03:26.720> here<00:03:26.959> is<00:03:27.140> the

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
really adds to the emergent here is the

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.730 
really adds to the emergent here is the
field<00:03:28.340> of<00:03:28.580> view<00:03:28.820> and<00:03:29.360> the<00:03:30.140> sense<00:03:30.410> of<00:03:30.530> scale

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:30.740 
field of view and the sense of scale

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:32.830 
field of view and the sense of scale
that<00:03:30.920> comes<00:03:31.280> a<00:03:31.370> virtual<00:03:31.760> reality<00:03:32.180> that<00:03:32.630> makes

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
that comes a virtual reality that makes

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.210 
that comes a virtual reality that makes
us<00:03:32.959> feel<00:03:33.200> like<00:03:33.470> I'm<00:03:34.250> actually<00:03:34.489> there<00:03:35.920> now<00:03:36.920> I'm

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
us feel like I'm actually there now I'm

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.910 
us feel like I'm actually there now I'm
sure<00:03:37.520> this<00:03:37.700> is<00:03:37.820> going<00:03:37.910> to<00:03:38.030> differ<00:03:38.209> from<00:03:38.959> other

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
sure this is going to differ from other

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.070 
sure this is going to differ from other
seated<00:03:40.640> demos<00:03:41.330> and<00:03:41.600> other<00:03:41.690> seated

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080

fighting<00:03:44.900> experience<00:03:45.830> that<00:03:46.280> I've<00:03:46.370> tried<00:03:46.640> like

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
fighting experience that I've tried like

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.050 
fighting experience that I've tried like
planes<00:03:47.330> or<00:03:47.600> space<00:03:48.410> fighter<00:03:48.739> Sims<00:03:49.100> I<00:03:49.400> do<00:03:49.670> find

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
planes or space fighter Sims I do find

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:51.729 
planes or space fighter Sims I do find
myself<00:03:50.120> looking<00:03:50.630> around<00:03:51.020> in<00:03:51.200> the<00:03:51.290> cockpit<00:03:51.530> a

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
myself looking around in the cockpit a

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:54.610 
myself looking around in the cockpit a
lot<00:03:51.950> more<00:03:52.130> to<00:03:52.310> track<00:03:52.880> my<00:03:53.060> enemies<00:03:53.570> we're<00:03:54.260> here

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
lot more to track my enemies we're here

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.290 
lot more to track my enemies we're here
because<00:03:54.650> I'm<00:03:55.130> sort<00:03:55.400> of<00:03:55.489> locked<00:03:55.790> down<00:03:56.030> to<00:03:56.180> the

because I'm sort of locked down to the

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.990 
because I'm sort of locked down to the
track<00:03:56.540> I<00:03:56.900> don't<00:03:57.140> feel<00:03:57.530> the<00:03:57.739> need<00:03:57.820> to<00:03:58.820> look

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
track I don't feel the need to look

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.030 
track I don't feel the need to look
around<00:03:59.209> I<00:03:59.420> don't<00:03:59.570> have<00:03:59.690> to<00:03:59.840> anticipate<00:04:00.260> turns

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
around I don't have to anticipate turns

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.660 
around I don't have to anticipate turns
or<00:04:01.459> curves<00:04:02.440> I'm<00:04:03.440> sure<00:04:03.680> even<00:04:03.709> a<00:04:04.040> racing<00:04:04.519> game

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670

or curves I'm sure even a racing game
been<00:04:05.880> different<00:04:06.270> just<00:04:06.780> because<00:04:07.050> you're<00:04:07.319> sort

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
been different just because you're sort

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.650 
been different just because you're sort

ships<00:04:09.870> going<00:04:10.140> here<00:04:10.530> I'm<00:04:10.650> just<00:04:10.680> sort<00:04:11.610> of

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
ships going here I'm just sort of

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.290 
ships going here I'm just sort of
controlling<00:04:12.300> where<00:04:12.569> on<00:04:12.810> the<00:04:12.959> cylinder<00:04:13.349> I<00:04:13.709> am

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:14.300 
controlling where on the cylinder I am

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.909 
controlling where on the cylinder I am
the<00:04:15.300> turns<00:04:15.569> they're<00:04:15.959> all<00:04:16.139> doing<00:04:16.350> themselves<00:04:16.590> I

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
the turns they're all doing themselves I

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:19.490 
the turns they're all doing themselves I
could<00:04:17.070> just<00:04:17.190> let<00:04:17.430> go<00:04:17.639> and<00:04:17.669> here<00:04:18.660> you<00:04:18.750> go<00:04:18.930> just

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
could just let go and here you go just

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.000 
could just let go and here you go just
going<00:04:19.769> on<00:04:19.859> my<00:04:19.950> own<00:04:21.290> but<00:04:22.290> nevertheless<00:04:22.530> the

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
going on my own but nevertheless the

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:27.350 
going on my own but nevertheless the
sense<00:04:23.250> of<00:04:23.370> speed<00:04:23.700> really<00:04:23.910> helps<00:04:26.030> and<00:04:27.030> I<00:04:27.180> guess

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
sense of speed really helps and I guess

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.000 
sense of speed really helps and I guess
being<00:04:27.750> stuck<00:04:28.169> on<00:04:28.290> the<00:04:28.350> track<00:04:28.560> if<00:04:28.770> they<00:04:28.889> had

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
being stuck on the track if they had

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.010 
being stuck on the track if they had
taken<00:04:29.190> away<00:04:29.460> these<00:04:29.610> barriers<00:04:30.120> so<00:04:30.630> I<00:04:30.690> have<00:04:30.870> to

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
taken away these barriers so I have to

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.720 
taken away these barriers so I have to
worry<00:04:31.110> about<00:04:31.200> slowing<00:04:31.620> it<00:04:31.770> down<00:04:31.800> I'd<00:04:32.520> actually

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:32.730 
worry about slowing it down I'd actually

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.670 
worry about slowing it down I'd actually
just<00:04:33.090> hit<00:04:33.330> the<00:04:33.480> gas<00:04:33.660> will<00:04:34.020> try<00:04:34.230> that<00:04:34.410> right<00:04:34.560> now

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
just hit the gas will try that right now

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.760 
just hit the gas will try that right now
actually<00:04:34.830> just<00:04:35.280> hit<00:04:36.090> the<00:04:36.240> gas<00:04:36.419> and<00:04:36.560> use<00:04:37.560> it<00:04:37.710> as

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
actually just hit the gas and use it as

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.000 
actually just hit the gas and use it as
an<00:04:38.040> opportunity<00:04:38.280> to<00:04:38.669> explore<00:04:39.270> this<00:04:39.479> space

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.010
