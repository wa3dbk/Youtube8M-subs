been what we talked about for a few days
and<00:02:30.510> I<00:02:30.750> think<00:02:31.410> that<00:02:31.590> that<00:02:31.950> showed<00:02:32.340> tonight<00:02:32.550> I

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
and I think that that showed tonight I

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.370 
and I think that that showed tonight I
think<00:02:33.120> we<00:02:33.270> just<00:02:33.360> came<00:02:33.570> out<00:02:33.780> a<00:02:33.810> little<00:02:33.990> stronger

think we just came out a little stronger
than<00:02:34.470> we<00:02:34.560> had<00:02:34.710> in<00:02:34.740> past<00:02:35.010> few<00:02:35.250> games<00:02:35.400> i<00:02:35.670> mean<00:02:35.850> we

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
than we had in past few games i mean we

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.240
