00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
these nice holes on the side of these

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.060 
these nice holes on the side of these
buttons<00:01:59.100> so<00:01:59.850> you<00:01:59.939> can<00:02:00.119> actually<00:02:00.149> screw<00:02:00.810> in

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
buttons so you can actually screw in

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.920
