it tastes like tastes like the earth but
just<00:01:18.810> from<00:01:18.960> reading<00:01:19.140> from<00:01:19.560> their<00:01:20.720> website

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
just from reading from their website

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:28.010 
just from reading from their website
about<00:01:24.590> some<00:01:25.590> fun<00:01:25.770> facts<00:01:26.009> about<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.630> beets<00:01:27.630> I

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
about some fun facts about the beets I

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.140 
about some fun facts about the beets I
always<00:01:28.650> knew<00:01:28.920> that<00:01:28.950> they<00:01:29.280> were<00:01:30.229> high<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:31.409> iron

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 
always knew that they were high and iron

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.640 
always knew that they were high and iron
but<00:01:33.150> just<00:01:33.329> from<00:01:33.479> reading<00:01:33.810> some<00:01:34.470> of<00:01:34.560> their

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
but just from reading some of their

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.760 
but just from reading some of their
research<00:01:35.329> they're<00:01:36.329> also<00:01:36.479> high<00:01:36.840> in<00:01:37.020> phosphorus

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
research they're also high in phosphorus

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.160 
research they're also high in phosphorus
iron<00:01:38.729> calcium<00:01:39.390> potassium<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:40.680> magnesium

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
iron calcium potassium and magnesium

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.080 
iron calcium potassium and magnesium
it's<00:01:43.170> cool<00:01:43.320> because<00:01:43.500> calcium<00:01:44.430> is<00:01:44.549> a<00:01:44.729> kind<00:01:45.030> of

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
it's cool because calcium is a kind of

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.810 
it's cool because calcium is a kind of
hard<00:01:45.299> one<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.750> absorb<00:01:46.610> normally<00:01:47.610> when<00:01:47.729> you're

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
hard one to absorb normally when you're

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.960 
hard one to absorb normally when you're
making<00:01:48.060> salads<00:01:49.340> you<00:01:50.340> want<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.610> add<00:01:50.729> a<00:01:50.759> little

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
making salads you want to add a little

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.850 
making salads you want to add a little
bit<00:01:51.060> of<00:01:51.180> vitamin<00:01:51.600> C<00:01:51.840> so<00:01:52.110> make<00:01:52.259> like<00:01:52.409> an<00:01:52.530> orange

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
bit of vitamin C so make like an orange

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.010 
bit of vitamin C so make like an orange
dressing<00:01:53.460> or<00:01:53.759> add<00:01:54.060> strawberries<00:01:54.780> because

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
dressing or add strawberries because

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.880 
dressing or add strawberries because
that<00:01:55.950> vitamin<00:01:56.430> C<00:01:56.810> aids<00:01:57.810> in<00:01:58.290> helping<00:01:58.770> the

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
that vitamin C aids in helping the

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.880 
that vitamin C aids in helping the
calcium<00:01:59.369> absorption<00:01:59.780> and<00:02:00.780> it's<00:02:01.469> cool<00:02:01.649> that<00:02:01.680> it

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
calcium absorption and it's cool that it

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.749 
calcium absorption and it's cool that it
has<00:02:02.009> magnesium<00:02:02.549> because<00:02:03.829> magnesium<00:02:04.829> also

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
has magnesium because magnesium also

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.949 
has magnesium because magnesium also
aids<00:02:06.119> in<00:02:06.420> calcium<00:02:06.869> and<00:02:06.990> absorption<00:02:08.300> so<00:02:09.300> it's

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
aids in calcium and absorption so it's

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.400 
aids in calcium and absorption so it's
kind<00:02:10.229> of<00:02:10.259> a<00:02:10.349> two-in-one<00:02:11.660> deal<00:02:12.660> you<00:02:13.260> know

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
even have to eat another food to get

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.330 
even have to eat another food to get

I would use beets the beetroot powder as
a<00:04:39.110> paint<00:04:39.650> for<00:04:40.460> kids

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
what I don't know if this won't work but

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.360 
what I don't know if this won't work but
maybe<00:04:49.580> put<00:04:49.970> it<00:04:50.090> in<00:04:50.270> water<00:04:51.200> put<00:04:51.830> some<00:04:51.860> arrowroot

paint<00:04:56.960> or<00:04:57.170> a<00:04:57.200> water<00:04:57.500> color<00:04:57.830> let's<00:04:58.790> try<00:04:59.000> it<00:04:59.060> out

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:11.740 
beets make great chips in general you
can<00:05:05.480> dehydrate<00:05:05.660> beets<00:05:06.590> and<00:05:08.200> that<00:05:09.200> your<00:05:09.530> tea<00:05:10.750> I

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750 
can dehydrate beets and that your tea I

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:16.000 
can dehydrate beets and that your tea I
would<00:05:12.140> do<00:05:12.290> like<00:05:12.470> a<00:05:12.530> chaga<00:05:12.920> cinnamon<00:05:15.010> almond

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.010

would do like a chaga cinnamon almond
tea<00:05:17.050> but<00:05:18.050> I<00:05:18.230> would<00:05:18.620> also<00:05:18.920> put<00:05:19.190> the<00:05:19.310> beetroot

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:25.970 
I mean to that um but lastly I think

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:27.610 
I mean to that um but lastly I think
would<00:05:26.090> be<00:05:26.120> really<00:05:26.240> fun<00:05:26.750> to<00:05:26.900> have<00:05:26.930> the<00:05:27.290> beetroot

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:50.870 
and let's just see what that looks like

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:54.070 
and let's just see what that looks like
cuz<00:05:51.170> fresh<00:05:51.470> breeze<00:05:51.770> its<00:05:52.750> you<00:05:53.750> could<00:05:53.870> do<00:05:53.960> that

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.080 
cuz fresh breeze its you could do that

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:59.080 
cuz fresh breeze its you could do that
with<00:05:54.170> fresh<00:05:54.410> beets<00:05:54.680> and<00:05:55.510> it's<00:05:56.510> good<00:05:56.810> too<00:05:58.090> it's

00:05:59.080 --> 00:05:59.090 
with fresh beets and it's good too it's

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:02.280 
with fresh beets and it's good too it's
a<00:05:59.240> really<00:05:59.450> pretty<00:05:59.720> color

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:02.290 

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:07.630 

but<00:06:05.230> don't<00:06:06.230> always<00:06:06.320> have<00:06:06.680> fresh<00:06:07.010> beets<00:06:07.310> around

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:07.640 
but don't always have fresh beets around

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:12.750 
but don't always have fresh beets around
