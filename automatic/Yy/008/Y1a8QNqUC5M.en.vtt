00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.910
 from public it is the first of a series of educational tools 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:16.910
 editorial state is it that will allow all 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:22.130
 Children learn corridor simultaneously seven languages ​​in addition 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:27.020
 French English stories 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.020
 Mandarin and Portuguese 

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:35.680
 We live in a globalized world of constant changes where distances 

00:00:35.679 --> 00:00:41.589
 shorten the technology evolves rapidly and it is the communication the 

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:43.700
 that connects us with business 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.700
 society and diverse cultures 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.010
 speaking another language should no longer be a privilege 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:57.239
 in this millennium the new illiterate christie's does not know another language but more 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.820
 there are different job and educational opportunities to learn languages 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.820
 it is a healthy exercise for our brain 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.740
 this is demonstrated by recent psychiatric studies at the University of 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.610
 california in los angeles 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.730
 by speaking a second language, cognitive functions improve intelligence 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.730
 and also the perception and memory 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.080
 at birth the human being has 100 billion neurons 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.450
 which have little contact with each other 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.640
 and with the simplest experience 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.900
 so brain circuits are activated to form connections between them in a 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.020
 process called synapsis 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.550
 by frequently repeating an experience the brain connections are 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:44.700
 stabilize 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.310
 and the experience becomes part of the individual's knowledge 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.619
 this is how knowledge shapes the brain during the first two years 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:59.030
 of life and until the age of 7 the development of these connections 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.010
 increases so that the progressive iva 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.130
 but then it slows down 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.450
 and it almost stops at the end of early childhood 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.220
 a process known as brain visits 

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:14.420
 it is for this reason that there is here 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.860
 units we wanted to develop in early childhood we did not manage to do it 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.860
 later the opportunity is lost forever 

00:02:23.169 --> 00:02:24.799
 let's see why 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:30.829
 each entourage experience represents a neural network let's say a road of 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:32.199
 information 

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:36.339
 what happens if in our childhood we did not create enough entity with 

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:40.719
 unicaja when acquiring new knowledge and not making space to travel 

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:43.589
 he would have difficulties 

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:46.589
 correctly 

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:55.329
 Therefore, by early building a large number of roads 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:59.739
 communication information traffic will be permanent agility 

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:02.579
 well judge the polyglot ism 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:05.909
 so each language creates an independent path 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:08.559
 facilitating activities such as logic 

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:09.729
 the math 

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:12.349
 and music among others 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:17.310
 when speaking another language, the small muscles of the ear will be used differently 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:23.150
 and the associated nerve circuits is the one and that controls the voice that 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.760
 influences thinking and language structures involving 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.599
 all the nervous system 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:35.609
 our ears at birth are open to all language frequencies 

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:40.649
 however with the time finished it only synchronizes the common frequencies 

00:03:40.649 --> 00:03:45.019
 of diagnosis that surrounds them ie the mother tongue 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:50.769
 the voice only reproduces the only ones that can capture oblivion, this is why 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:55.549
 after a while, introducing another language is hard to memorize and 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:57.199
 to pronounce 

00:03:57.199 --> 00:04:02.029
 It should be remembered that it is repetition that reinforces learning 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:09.959
 it's all steve purdy crockery uses native and specialized shepherds 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:14.359
 so that our children carstens and adapt salander this castro insisted 

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:17.709
 in which if each of the seven languages 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:22.509
 besides, the music that composes the soundtrack of our method is rich in 

00:04:22.509 --> 00:04:27.389
 sound elements with musical textures that cover the entire spectrum 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:28.409
 musical 

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:33.009
 which so the polyglot pt method would be a tool of 

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:36.629
 full educational stimulation insuates 

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:37.770
 auditory 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:43.529
 Itatí olfactory is 100% sensory 

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:46.679
 assuming that education is more effective 

00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:52.530
 the editorial journalist we consider that our children 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:56.840
 about the future of our society interest in receiving while a 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.280
 adequate education for the purchasing power of the dollar the skills 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.999
 basic idioms 

00:05:03.999 --> 00:05:08.989
 as parents kyle shipyard heats it is our duty to accompany our 

00:05:08.989 --> 00:05:12.459
 children in their first steps on the path of languages 

00:05:12.999 --> 00:05:13.849
 and so 

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:17.330
 april fresh forces for future success 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:18.220
 this year 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.360
 our hands make the difference
