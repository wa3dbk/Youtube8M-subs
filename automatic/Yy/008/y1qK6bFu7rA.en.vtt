00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
as possible and that didn't really even

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.160 
as possible and that didn't really even

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
save me now there's a couple of

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.689 
save me now there's a couple of
strategies<00:00:58.590> for<00:00:58.620> this<00:00:58.829> I'm<00:00:59.280> gonna<00:00:59.430> show<00:00:59.520> you

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
strategies for this I'm gonna show you

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.049 
strategies for this I'm gonna show you
the<00:01:00.030> easiest<00:01:00.300> way<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.510> do<00:01:00.780> it<00:01:00.989> with<00:01:01.920> this<00:01:02.910> is<00:01:03.030> a

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
the easiest way to do it with this is a

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.690 
the easiest way to do it with this is a
really<00:01:03.329> long<00:01:03.480> fight<00:01:03.750> by<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.019> way<00:01:04.199> if<00:01:04.489> you<00:01:05.489> are

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
really long fight by the way if you are

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.859 
really long fight by the way if you are
using<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.570> bow<00:01:07.409> like<00:01:07.680> I<00:01:07.860> am<00:01:08.100> anyways<00:01:08.700> I<00:01:08.970> try<00:01:09.810> to

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
using a bow like I am anyways I try to

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.990 
using a bow like I am anyways I try to
poison<00:01:10.290> into<00:01:10.439> death<00:01:10.710> it<00:01:11.010> takes<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.430> while<00:01:11.580> this

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
poison into death it takes a while this

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.840 
poison into death it takes a while this
is<00:01:12.119> like<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.270> 10<00:01:12.570> minute<00:01:12.600> fight<00:01:13.110> for<00:01:13.380> me<00:01:13.490> so<00:01:14.490> I'm

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
is like a 10 minute fight for me so I'm

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.850 
is like a 10 minute fight for me so I'm
just<00:01:15.030> going<00:01:15.150> to<00:01:15.240> show<00:01:15.330> you<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.479> strategy<00:01:15.869> the

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
just going to show you the strategy the

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.570 
just going to show you the strategy the
idea<00:01:17.189> is<00:01:17.750> that<00:01:18.750> you<00:01:18.990> say<00:01:19.770> right<00:01:19.979> next<00:01:20.250> is<00:01:20.369> to

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
idea is that you say right next is to

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.420 
idea is that you say right next is to
head<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:21.140> watch<00:01:22.140> his<00:01:22.350> wings<00:01:22.590> if<00:01:22.890> his<00:01:23.189> wings

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
head and watch his wings if his wings

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.690 
head and watch his wings if his wings
start<00:01:23.700> flapping<00:01:24.210> like<00:01:25.049> that<00:01:25.290> run<00:01:25.650> away<00:01:25.890> run

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
start flapping like that run away run

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.370 
start flapping like that run away run
run<00:01:26.880> run<00:01:27.060> as<00:01:27.270> soon<00:01:27.420> as<00:01:27.570> you<00:01:27.659> hear<00:01:27.869> him<00:01:28.080> shoot

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
run run as soon as you hear him shoot

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.020 
run run as soon as you hear him shoot
breath<00:01:28.650> start<00:01:29.310> running<00:01:29.520> back<00:01:29.670> you<00:01:29.880> don't

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
breath start running back you don't

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.030 
breath start running back you don't
wanna<00:01:30.150> run<00:01:30.240> too<00:01:30.450> far<00:01:30.630> away<00:01:30.869> because<00:01:31.650> sometimes

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
wanna run too far away because sometimes

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.859 
wanna run too far away because sometimes
he<00:01:32.100> jumps<00:01:32.340> backwards<00:01:32.790> so<00:01:33.360> we're<00:01:33.509> gonna<00:01:33.600> get

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
he jumps backwards so we're gonna get

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.780 
he jumps backwards so we're gonna get
next<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.350> his<00:01:34.470> head<00:01:34.650> I'm<00:01:35.220> gonna<00:01:35.400> try<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:35.640> open

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
next to his head I'm gonna try and open

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.060 
next to his head I'm gonna try and open
up<00:01:35.970> his<00:01:36.180> wings<00:01:36.750> flap<00:01:37.170> time<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.680> run<00:01:37.770> away<00:01:37.920> again

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
up his wings flap time to run away again

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.429 
up his wings flap time to run away again
this<00:01:39.060> is<00:01:39.150> pretty<00:01:39.299> much<00:01:39.479> it<00:01:39.659> it's<00:01:39.869> actually<00:01:40.020> a

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
this is pretty much it it's actually a

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.170 
this is pretty much it it's actually a
very<00:01:40.650> simple<00:01:41.369> strategy<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.880> boss<00:01:42.000> is

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
very simple strategy the boss is

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.770 
very simple strategy the boss is
extremely<00:01:43.170> easy<00:01:43.380> once<00:01:44.189> you<00:01:44.340> learn<00:01:44.640> this<00:01:44.909> but

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
extremely easy once you learn this but

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.249 
extremely easy once you learn this but
until<00:01:46.110> then<00:01:47.090> you're<00:01:48.090> gonna<00:01:48.390> have<00:01:48.659> some<00:01:48.869> issues

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
until then you're gonna have some issues

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.230 
until then you're gonna have some issues
but<00:01:49.920> there<00:01:50.070> you<00:01:50.130> go<00:01:50.250> we're<00:01:50.759> gonna<00:01:50.850> shoot<00:01:51.119> him

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
but there you go we're gonna shoot him

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.660 
but there you go we're gonna shoot him
once<00:01:51.360> or<00:01:51.509> twice<00:01:51.799> watch<00:01:52.799> his<00:01:52.979> wings<00:01:53.189> watch<00:01:53.520> his

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
once or twice watch his wings watch his

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.730 
once or twice watch his wings watch his
wings<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.450> he's<00:01:54.899> flapping<00:01:55.320> or<00:01:55.530> so<00:01:55.649> we're

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
wings and he's flapping or so we're

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.770 
wings and he's flapping or so we're
gonna<00:01:55.829> run<00:01:56.009> away<00:01:56.100> sometimes<00:01:57.030> he'll<00:01:57.360> just<00:01:57.540> flap

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
gonna run away sometimes he'll just flap

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.770 
gonna run away sometimes he'll just flap
multiple<00:01:58.649> times<00:01:58.860> in<00:01:59.009> a<00:01:59.040> row<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.600> that<00:02:00.600> thing

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
multiple times in a row and that thing

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.990 
multiple times in a row and that thing
right<00:02:00.899> there<00:02:00.960> will<00:02:01.229> one<00:02:01.469> shot<00:02:01.710> you<00:02:01.880> but<00:02:02.880> what

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
right there will one shot you but what

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.480 
right there will one shot you but what
he<00:02:03.060> doesn't<00:02:03.240> do<00:02:03.420> that<00:02:03.600> it's<00:02:04.079> not<00:02:04.200> too<00:02:04.350> bad<00:02:04.500> so

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
he doesn't do that it's not too bad so

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.310 
he doesn't do that it's not too bad so
there<00:02:06.000> we<00:02:06.210> go<00:02:06.329> perfect<00:02:06.540> that's<00:02:06.930> what<00:02:07.079> I<00:02:07.110> want

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
there we go perfect that's what I want

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.380 
there we go perfect that's what I want
him<00:02:07.409> to<00:02:07.469> do<00:02:07.619> his<00:02:08.250> head<00:02:08.520> is<00:02:08.819> his<00:02:09.060> weak

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
him to do his head is his weak

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.140 
him to do his head is his weak
point<00:02:09.630> so<00:02:10.020> if<00:02:10.289> you<00:02:10.440> are<00:02:10.679> using<00:02:10.920> spells<00:02:11.520> or<00:02:11.970> any

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
point so if you are using spells or any

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.370 
point so if you are using spells or any
kind<00:02:12.300> of<00:02:12.330> range<00:02:12.480> attack<00:02:12.750> make<00:02:12.960> sure<00:02:13.080> to<00:02:13.230> shoot

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
kind of range attack make sure to shoot

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.860 
kind of range attack make sure to shoot
him<00:02:13.500> in<00:02:13.650> the<00:02:13.680> head<00:02:14.060> you're<00:02:15.060> going<00:02:15.600> to<00:02:15.720> use

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
him in the head you're going to use

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.470 
him in the head you're going to use
melee<00:02:16.230> you<00:02:16.290> got<00:02:16.500> to<00:02:16.590> pop<00:02:16.770> him<00:02:16.920> in<00:02:17.010> his<00:02:17.160> toes

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
melee you got to pop him in his toes

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.880 
melee you got to pop him in his toes
because<00:02:18.480> you<00:02:18.660> know<00:02:18.780> chopping<00:02:19.410> dragons<00:02:19.800> and

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
because you know chopping dragons and

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.620 
because you know chopping dragons and
toes<00:02:20.100> that's<00:02:20.490> how<00:02:20.610> you<00:02:20.670> kill<00:02:20.910> big<00:02:21.240> dragon

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
toes that's how you kill big dragon

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.890 
toes that's how you kill big dragon
right<00:02:21.810> I<00:02:22.050> guess<00:02:22.940> anyways<00:02:23.940> there<00:02:24.480> are<00:02:24.510> a<00:02:24.630> lot<00:02:24.870> of

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
right I guess anyways there are a lot of

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.180 
right I guess anyways there are a lot of
points<00:02:25.140> at<00:02:25.380> which<00:02:25.530> you<00:02:25.680> can<00:02:25.770> actually<00:02:25.920> target

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
points at which you can actually target

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.120 
points at which you can actually target
him<00:02:26.520> he<00:02:27.090> is<00:02:27.360> quite<00:02:27.720> large<00:02:27.959> but<00:02:28.800> for<00:02:28.950> the<00:02:29.040> most

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
him he is quite large but for the most

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.470 
him he is quite large but for the most
part<00:02:29.250> you've<00:02:29.610> seen<00:02:29.940> the<00:02:30.060> entire<00:02:30.090> fight

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
part you've seen the entire fight

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.120 
part you've seen the entire fight
already<00:02:30.810> like<00:02:31.230> that<00:02:31.440> is<00:02:31.590> literally<00:02:31.980> the

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
already like that is literally the

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.830 
already like that is literally the
entire<00:02:32.580> fight<00:02:32.820> now<00:02:33.000> he<00:02:33.060> does<00:02:33.330> another<00:02:33.540> attack

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
entire fight now he does another attack

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.360 
entire fight now he does another attack
where<00:02:34.020> he'll<00:02:34.170> like<00:02:34.320> shoot<00:02:34.560> at<00:02:34.680> his<00:02:34.800> chest<00:02:35.070> and

where he'll like shoot at his chest and
burn<00:02:36.030> underneath<00:02:36.390> him<00:02:36.660> but<00:02:36.840> we're<00:02:37.020> not<00:02:37.170> gonna

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
burn underneath him but we're not gonna

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.770 
burn underneath him but we're not gonna
go<00:02:37.590> that<00:02:37.800> far<00:02:38.010> underneath<00:02:38.400> him<00:02:38.600> some<00:02:39.600> people

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
go that far underneath him some people

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.420

strategy this seems like the easiest and
most<00:02:43.620> effective<00:02:44.610> way<00:02:45.030> of<00:02:45.060> fighting<00:02:45.510> a<00:02:45.600> dragon

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
goers ring of protection if you put that

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.700 
goers ring of protection if you put that
ring<00:04:29.100> on<00:04:29.340> you'll<00:04:30.330> have<00:04:30.390> this<00:04:30.660> little<00:04:30.930> cloud<00:04:31.470> on

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
ring on you'll have this little cloud on

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.730 
ring on you'll have this little cloud on
your<00:04:31.860> back<00:04:32.010> and<00:04:32.250> it<00:04:32.720> pretty<00:04:33.720> much<00:04:33.810> nullifies

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
your back and it pretty much nullifies

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.280 
your back and it pretty much nullifies
any<00:04:35.130> damage<00:04:35.550> taken<00:04:35.910> from<00:04:36.270> the<00:04:36.419> back<00:04:36.600> so<00:04:37.169> what

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.290 
any damage taken from the back so what

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.860 
any damage taken from the back so what
you<00:04:37.440> do<00:04:37.620> is<00:04:37.979> you<00:04:38.220> use<00:04:38.640> this<00:04:38.940> strategy<00:04:39.240> here<00:04:39.690> but

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
you do is you use this strategy here but

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.030 
you do is you use this strategy here but
if<00:04:39.960> you<00:04:40.050> make<00:04:40.169> the<00:04:40.290> mistake<00:04:40.320> and<00:04:40.620> you<00:04:40.860> don't

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 
if you make the mistake and you don't

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.850 
if you make the mistake and you don't
run<00:04:41.220> away<00:04:41.370> fast<00:04:41.729> enough<00:04:41.990> then<00:04:42.990> that<00:04:43.410> ring<00:04:43.680> will

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
run away fast enough then that ring will

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.469 
run away fast enough then that ring will
actually<00:04:44.220> stop<00:04:44.430> all<00:04:44.669> of<00:04:44.820> the<00:04:44.940> damage<00:04:45.210> from<00:04:45.300> the

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:45.479 
actually stop all of the damage from the

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:46.880 
actually stop all of the damage from the
fire<00:04:45.630> now<00:04:45.840> the<00:04:45.900> ring<00:04:46.169> will<00:04:46.290> break<00:04:46.560> after

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:46.890 
fire now the ring will break after

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:49.400 
fire now the ring will break after
taking<00:04:47.070> quite<00:04:47.310> a<00:04:47.340> bit<00:04:47.490> of<00:04:47.550> damage<00:04:47.669> so<00:04:47.930> you<00:04:48.930> only

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
taking quite a bit of damage so you only

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.350 
taking quite a bit of damage so you only
have<00:04:49.710> a<00:04:49.740> few<00:04:50.040> chances<00:04:50.460> for<00:04:50.700> that<00:04:50.880> to<00:04:51.000> work<00:04:51.030> you

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
have a few chances for that to work you

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.320 
have a few chances for that to work you
can<00:04:51.479> also<00:04:51.630> use<00:04:52.100> a<00:04:53.100> cameraman<00:04:53.729> name<00:04:53.970> but

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
can also use a cameraman name but

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.240 
can also use a cameraman name but
there's<00:04:54.510> the<00:04:54.660> ring<00:04:55.050> that<00:04:55.229> note<00:04:55.500> that<00:04:55.860> kind<00:04:56.190> of

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
there's the ring that note that kind of

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.730 
there's the ring that note that kind of
reduces<00:04:57.180> the<00:04:57.419> equipment<00:04:58.169> breakage<00:04:58.470> you<00:04:58.500> can

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
reduces the equipment breakage you can

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.350 
reduces the equipment breakage you can
put<00:04:58.890> those<00:04:59.010> two<00:04:59.190> together<00:04:59.340> and<00:04:59.700> that<00:05:00.150> makes

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
put those two together and that makes

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.150 
put those two together and that makes
for<00:05:00.810> a<00:05:00.840> great<00:05:01.200> combination<00:05:01.530> in<00:05:01.800> this<00:05:01.890> fight

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 
for a great combination in this fight

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.440 
for a great combination in this fight
the<00:05:02.520> other<00:05:02.700> thing<00:05:02.850> I<00:05:02.940> would<00:05:03.030> say<00:05:03.210> is<00:05:03.419> don't

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:03.450 
the other thing I would say is don't

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:05.270 
the other thing I would say is don't
even<00:05:03.810> worry<00:05:04.080> about<00:05:04.320> using<00:05:04.470> heavy<00:05:04.770> armor<00:05:05.100> as

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
even worry about using heavy armor as

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.500 
even worry about using heavy armor as

you can see I'm just messing around with
my<00:05:06.660> butterfly<00:05:06.930> armor<00:05:07.350> so<00:05:07.620> I<00:05:07.650> can<00:05:07.830> run<00:05:07.979> faster

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
my butterfly armor so I can run faster
