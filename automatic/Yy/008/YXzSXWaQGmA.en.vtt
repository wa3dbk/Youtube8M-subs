two<00:01:47.200> different<00:01:47.409> harmonies<00:01:48.250> on<00:01:48.670> one<00:01:49.060> page<00:01:49.420> but

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
two different harmonies on one page but

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.699 
two different harmonies on one page but
with<00:01:50.439> this<00:01:50.679> piano<00:01:52.170> everything<00:01:53.170> was<00:01:53.789> like

00:01:55.699 --> 00:01:55.709 
with this piano everything was like

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:59.309 
with this piano everything was like
really<00:01:56.709> life<00:01:57.390> it's<00:01:58.390> funny<00:01:58.599> to<00:01:58.840> speak<00:01:59.080> about

00:01:59.309 --> 00:01:59.319

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:08.769 
but I could really perceive they the

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:16.440 
but I could really perceive they the
precise<00:02:09.929> idea<00:02:10.929> that<00:02:14.400> this<00:02:15.400> kind<00:02:15.700> of<00:02:15.850> harmony

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
precise idea that this kind of harmony

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:51.490 
precise idea that this kind of harmony
critter<00:02:16.980> could<00:02:17.980> express
