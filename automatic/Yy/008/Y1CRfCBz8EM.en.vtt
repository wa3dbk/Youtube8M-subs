stage you have to have few processes the

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.020 
stage you have to have few processes the
first<00:00:53.600> one<00:00:53.780> is<00:00:54.769> that<00:00:54.949> you<00:00:55.429> want<00:00:55.460> to<00:00:55.760> determine

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
first one is that you want to determine

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:57.790 
first one is that you want to determine
where<00:00:56.420> your<00:00:56.629> bolts<00:00:56.960> are<00:00:57.079> going<00:00:57.170> to<00:00:57.289> go<00:00:57.410> and

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
where your bolts are going to go and

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.770 
where your bolts are going to go and
when<00:00:57.949> I<00:00:57.980> say<00:00:58.190> bolt<00:00:58.460> these<00:00:59.300> are<00:00:59.510> the<00:00:59.600> type<00:00:59.750> of

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 
when I say bolt these are the type of

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.380 
when I say bolt these are the type of
anchor<00:01:00.109> bolts<00:01:00.589> that<00:01:00.920> I'm<00:01:01.010> talking<00:01:01.129> about<00:01:01.390> um

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
anchor bolts that I'm talking about um

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.310 
anchor bolts that I'm talking about um
both<00:01:03.199> of<00:01:03.410> this<00:01:03.469> 5/8<00:01:04.160> thick<00:01:04.690> about<00:01:05.690> you<00:01:06.200> know

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
both of this 5/8 thick about you know

you need bolts you need a a spade be 5/8

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.410 
you need bolts you need a a spade be 5/8
in<00:01:14.360> this<00:01:14.450> case<00:01:14.660> a<00:01:14.870> 5/8<00:01:15.290> concrete<00:01:16.210> drill<00:01:17.210> been

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
in this case a 5/8 concrete drill been

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.800 
in this case a 5/8 concrete drill been
some<00:01:18.350> epoxy<00:01:18.740> um<00:01:18.980> epoxy<00:01:19.640> mixture<00:01:20.120> this<00:01:20.480> is<00:01:20.540> a

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
some epoxy um epoxy mixture this is a

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.070 
some epoxy um epoxy mixture this is a
concrete<00:01:21.260> epoxy<00:01:21.830> mixture<00:01:22.430> and<00:01:23.060> that's<00:01:23.600> it<00:01:23.750> so

if you notice what I did is that I mark

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.420 
if you notice what I did is that I mark
over<00:01:26.600> here<00:01:26.810> the<00:01:27.020> depth<00:01:27.290> that<00:01:27.530> I<00:01:27.830> want<00:01:28.130> to<00:01:28.280> go

much if you put too much of an excessive

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.750 
much if you put too much of an excessive
weight<00:04:14.409> you're<00:04:14.709> going<00:04:14.799> to<00:04:14.889> waste<00:04:15.069> it<00:04:15.340> and<00:04:15.400> it's

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
weight you're going to waste it and it's

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.939 
weight you're going to waste it and it's
going<00:04:15.879> to<00:04:15.969> just<00:04:16.150> burst<00:04:17.019> whenever<00:04:17.500> you<00:04:17.650> put<00:04:17.859> in

00:04:17.939 --> 00:04:17.949 
going to just burst whenever you put in

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:20.490 
going to just burst whenever you put in
it<00:04:18.099> so<00:04:18.479> put<00:04:19.479> a<00:04:19.570> lot<00:04:19.690> of<00:04:19.810> pressure<00:04:19.989> into<00:04:20.320> this

it so put a lot of pressure into this

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:32.429 
it so put a lot of pressure into this
thing

00:04:32.429 --> 00:04:32.439

all<00:05:12.939> the<00:05:12.969> way<00:05:13.060> through<00:05:15.120> make<00:05:16.120> sure<00:05:16.150> that<00:05:16.479> they

00:05:16.619 --> 00:05:16.629 
all the way through make sure that they

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:21.420 
are nice and anchor I always put the nut
first<00:05:20.020> here<00:05:20.440> I<00:05:20.500> found<00:05:20.770> that<00:05:20.949> sometimes<00:05:21.099> when
