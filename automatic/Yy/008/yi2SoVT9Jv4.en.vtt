and we're recording and this is part 33
we're<00:00:06.150> going<00:00:06.330> to<00:00:06.390> use<00:00:06.919> these<00:00:07.919> channel<00:00:08.490> shears

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
we're going to use these channel shears

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:20.990 
we're going to use these channel shears
on<00:00:09.150> Frank's<00:00:11.179> give<00:00:12.179> them<00:00:12.300> some<00:00:12.509> textures<00:00:20.000> are

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
on Frank's give them some textures are

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:43.670 
on Frank's give them some textures are
great<00:00:21.029> for<00:00:21.390> texturizing

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.210 

use<00:00:44.680> the<00:00:44.890> razor<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:47.050> put<00:00:47.290> some<00:00:47.410> razor<00:00:47.680> working

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:48.220 
use the razor and put some razor working

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.490 
use the razor and put some razor working
right<00:00:48.580> right<00:00:49.030> down<00:00:49.239> the<00:00:49.480> resistance<00:00:49.780> in<00:00:50.290> that

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.500 
right right down the resistance in that

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.950 
right right down the resistance in that
curls<00:00:51.400> will<00:00:51.580> get<00:00:51.730> it<00:00:51.850> for<00:00:52.059> the<00:00:52.420> way<00:00:52.570> and<00:00:52.930> the

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960 
curls will get it for the way and the

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:59.340 
curls will get it for the way and the
way<00:00:53.080> so<00:00:53.260> it's<00:00:53.620> based<00:00:53.890> blade<00:00:54.550> straighter<00:00:58.350> razor

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 
way so it's based blade straighter razor

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.049 
way so it's based blade straighter razor
has<00:00:59.620> a<00:00:59.650> guard<00:01:00.010> on<00:01:00.220> it<00:01:00.430> so<00:01:00.640> you<00:01:00.670> can't<00:01:00.970> really

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:01.059 
has a guard on it so you can't really

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:09.080 
has a guard on it so you can't really
cut<00:01:01.449> yourself

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.289 

I<00:01:09.210> just<00:01:09.840> lightly<00:01:10.189> combed<00:01:11.189> through<00:01:11.579> it<00:01:11.759> with

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
I just lightly combed through it with

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:20.640 
I just lightly combed through it with
the<00:01:12.420> razor<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:13.109> the<00:01:13.200> column

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:20.650 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.860 

they<00:01:21.400> do<00:01:21.460> that<00:01:21.790> i<00:01:21.820> can<00:01:22.120> see<00:01:22.300> that<00:01:22.330> it's<00:01:22.660> laying

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:22.870 
they do that i can see that it's laying

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:37.570 
they do that i can see that it's laying
straighter<00:01:23.410> and<00:01:23.880> straighter

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:46.870 

and<00:01:40.270> spiked<00:01:41.270> out<00:01:41.950> front<00:01:44.590> so<00:01:45.590> or<00:01:46.100> you<00:01:46.130> can<00:01:46.580> stand

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
and spiked out front so or you can stand

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:55.600 
and spiked out front so or you can stand
it<00:01:47.060> up<00:01:50.200> like<00:01:51.200> that<00:01:52.000> either<00:01:53.000> way<00:01:54.340> clearly<00:01:55.340> gel

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
it up like that either way clearly gel

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.360 
it up like that either way clearly gel
through<00:01:55.910> it<00:01:56.860> I'm<00:01:57.860> going<00:01:57.980> to<00:01:58.070> go<00:01:58.190> ahead<00:01:58.220> and

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:58.370 
through it I'm going to go ahead and

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.130 
through it I'm going to go ahead and
rinse<00:01:58.610> this<00:01:58.910> and<00:01:59.210> now<00:01:59.330> we'll<00:01:59.480> run<00:01:59.630> some<00:01:59.660> gel

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
rinse this and now we'll run some gel

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.140 
rinse this and now we'll run some gel
through<00:02:00.440> it<00:02:00.590> but<00:02:01.010> that's<00:02:01.280> basically<00:02:01.520> the

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.150 
through it but that's basically the
