00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
just like that and yeah you can also use

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.870 
just like that and yeah you can also use
a<00:00:21.420> lever<00:00:21.689> in<00:00:21.869> case<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.289> button<00:00:22.699> in<00:00:23.699> case

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
a lever in case the button in case

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.240 
a lever in case the button in case
you're<00:00:24.000> not<00:00:24.119> quick<00:00:24.269> enough<00:00:24.300> for<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.660> button

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:25.250 
you're not quick enough for the button

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.859 
you're not quick enough for the button
there<00:00:26.250> you<00:00:26.340> go<00:00:26.430> right<00:00:26.580> through<00:00:26.730> it<00:00:26.849> alright<00:00:27.539> so

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
there you go right through it alright so

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.400 
there you go right through it alright so
now<00:00:28.289> let's<00:00:28.470> get<00:00:28.590> to<00:00:28.650> making<00:00:28.949> this<00:00:30.230> all<00:00:31.230> right

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
now let's get to making this all right

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.970 
now let's get to making this all right
let's<00:00:31.890> over<00:00:32.880> this<00:00:33.000> way<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:33.590> then<00:00:34.590> just<00:00:34.770> use

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
let's over this way and then just use

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.770 
let's over this way and then just use
your<00:00:35.130> building<00:00:35.430> blocks<00:00:35.700> or<00:00:36.030> if<00:00:36.420> you're

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
your building blocks or if you're

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.510 
your building blocks or if you're
building<00:00:37.050> this<00:00:37.290> like<00:00:37.500> in<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:37.800> natural<00:00:38.340> cave

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
building this like in a natural cave

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.440 
building this like in a natural cave
system<00:00:38.850> or<00:00:38.910> something<00:00:39.149> that<00:00:39.239> would<00:00:39.329> work

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
system or something that would work

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.740 
system or something that would work
really<00:00:39.600> well<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:41.360> build<00:00:42.360> it<00:00:42.450> on<00:00:42.510> a<00:00:42.600> much

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
really well to build it on a much

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.950 
really well to build it on a much
smaller<00:00:42.780> scale<00:00:43.200> than<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.680> other<00:00:44.780> alright<00:00:45.780> so

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
smaller scale than the other alright so

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.029 
smaller scale than the other alright so
lever<00:00:46.200> here<00:00:46.649> block<00:00:47.640> behind<00:00:48.710> then<00:00:49.710> lay<00:00:49.860> down

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
lever here block behind then lay down

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.090 
lever here block behind then lay down
redstone<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:51.829> actually<00:00:52.829> you're<00:00:52.920> going<00:00:53.039> to

alright so let's I need a painting that
would<00:01:22.040> be<00:01:22.160> useful<00:01:23.140> come<00:01:24.140> on<00:01:24.260> panting<00:01:24.590> there<00:01:24.920> we

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.010 
would be useful come on panting there we

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:30.760 
would be useful come on panting there we
go<00:01:25.450> okay<00:01:26.450> so<00:01:26.510> if<00:01:27.410> you<00:01:28.840> there<00:01:29.840> we<00:01:29.930> go<00:01:30.050> anything

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
go okay so if you there we go anything

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.040 
go okay so if you there we go anything
just<00:01:30.980> like<00:01:31.070> that<00:01:31.690> and<00:01:32.690> you<00:01:32.780> want<00:01:32.930> to<00:01:32.990> come

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.050 
just like that and you want to come

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.420 
just like that and you want to come
around<00:01:33.170> this<00:01:33.440> side<00:01:34.210> and<00:01:35.290> that<00:01:36.290> and<00:01:37.130> you<00:01:37.190> got<00:01:37.340> to

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
around this side and that and you got to

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:38.830 
around this side and that and you got to
work<00:01:37.520> kind<00:01:37.730> of<00:01:37.790> quickly<00:01:37.970> otherwise<00:01:38.210> the<00:01:38.630> sign

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
work kind of quickly otherwise the sign

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.710 
work kind of quickly otherwise the sign
will<00:01:39.050> disappear<00:01:39.560> and<00:01:40.180> so<00:01:41.180> let's<00:01:41.390> see<00:01:41.600> if<00:01:41.690> that

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
will disappear and so let's see if that

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.110 
will disappear and so let's see if that
opens<00:01:42.170> it<00:01:42.320> that<00:01:43.280> doesn't<00:01:43.700> what<00:01:43.820> am<00:01:43.910> i<00:01:43.940> doing

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:44.120 
opens it that doesn't what am i doing

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:53.180 
opens it that doesn't what am i doing
wrong<00:01:44.270> ah<00:01:47.290> that's<00:01:48.290> why<00:01:49.150> well

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:58.790 

still<00:01:54.000> not<00:01:54.470> why<00:01:55.470> is<00:01:55.530> it<00:01:55.740> not<00:01:57.560> there<00:01:58.560> we<00:01:58.710> go

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:58.800 
still not why is it not there we go

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.750 
still not why is it not there we go
that's<00:01:59.010> why<00:01:59.190> let<00:02:00.120> me<00:02:00.180> take<00:02:00.330> out<00:02:00.450> that<00:02:00.600> block

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760 
that's why let me take out that block

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.630 
that's why let me take out that block
all<00:02:02.760> right<00:02:02.910> anyway<00:02:03.890> so<00:02:04.890> there<00:02:05.040> you<00:02:05.100> go<00:02:05.130> and<00:02:05.490> I

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
all right anyway so there you go and I

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.820 
all right anyway so there you go and I
use<00:02:05.790> buttons<00:02:06.480> cuz<00:02:06.720> it<00:02:06.870> it's<00:02:07.320> hidden<00:02:07.590> much

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
use buttons cuz it it's hidden much

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.250 
use buttons cuz it it's hidden much
better<00:02:08.070> so<00:02:08.880> oh<00:02:10.100> I<00:02:11.100> wasn't<00:02:11.430> quite<00:02:11.610> fast<00:02:11.910> enough

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
better so oh I wasn't quite fast enough

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.890 
better so oh I wasn't quite fast enough
there<00:02:13.260> we<00:02:13.350> go<00:02:14.120> so<00:02:15.120> if<00:02:15.360> you<00:02:15.450> put<00:02:15.660> that<00:02:15.750> in<00:02:15.870> your

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
there we go so if you put that in your

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.150 
there we go so if you put that in your
house<00:02:16.080> that'd<00:02:16.260> be<00:02:16.320> pretty<00:02:16.440> awesome<00:02:16.560> you<00:02:16.920> just

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
house that'd be pretty awesome you just

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.380 
house that'd be pretty awesome you just
have<00:02:17.250> a<00:02:17.280> bunch<00:02:17.430> of<00:02:17.580> paintings<00:02:17.790> hanging<00:02:18.120> up<00:02:18.270> all

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
have a bunch of paintings hanging up all

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.180 
have a bunch of paintings hanging up all
over<00:02:18.510> the<00:02:18.600> place<00:02:18.740> nobody<00:02:19.740> would<00:02:19.860> even<00:02:19.890> know

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
over the place nobody would even know

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.470 
over the place nobody would even know
about<00:02:20.220> it<00:02:20.430> this<00:02:20.640> buttons<00:02:21.000> kind<00:02:21.210> of<00:02:21.270> hard<00:02:21.420> to

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
about it this buttons kind of hard to
