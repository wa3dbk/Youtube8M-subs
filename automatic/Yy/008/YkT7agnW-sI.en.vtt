00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.470

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.900
 we found the cc is the one 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.620
 we are next 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:38.920

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.920
 this spectacular game 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:46.710
 attention to details something 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:48.990
 I really do say portal that there 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:52.040
 brings another world into the other anyway 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.040
 another area of ​​the world 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:01.900
 wardrobe 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:05.500
 becky ask me I know you would like to see naked 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:08.250
 however, life cannot be laminated 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.250
 let's try 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:17.720
 let's avoid my name 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:19.960
 there is the possibility, however, from another 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.960
 screen 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:32.180
 I think mine 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:32.180
 trusty pet will be peter parker 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.540
 but the incredible 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.480
 let's say 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:04:00.340

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.340
 charge and we give you a hand 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:25.640
 let's leave dago mountain we also cultivate 

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:33.460

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:33.460
 peppercorns in the acts one escapes 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:42.510

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:01.170

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:12.890

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:16.009
 there is however that red circle that yes 

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:19.430

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:19.430

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:28.570

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:28.570
 far 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.170
 this sense 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:53.000
 as if hearing the soundtrack too 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:53.000

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:58.440

00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:05.150

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:08.150
