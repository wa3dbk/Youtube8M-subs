00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
so we were assigned this is really girls

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:15.880 
so we were assigned this is really girls
we<00:00:14.670> were<00:00:14.759> assigned<00:00:14.969> to<00:00:15.120> make<00:00:15.269> a<00:00:15.299> human<00:00:15.719> brain

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:15.890 
we were assigned to make a human brain

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:18.590 
we were assigned to make a human brain
either<00:00:16.890> a<00:00:17.070> mobile<00:00:17.520> or<00:00:17.789> a<00:00:17.820> model<00:00:18.270> for

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
either a mobile or a model for

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.560 
either a mobile or a model for
psychology<00:00:19.529> class<00:00:19.740> to<00:00:20.609> understand<00:00:21.119> what<00:00:21.330> the

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
psychology class to understand what the

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.529 
psychology class to understand what the
little<00:00:22.080> bits<00:00:22.289> and<00:00:22.500> pieces<00:00:22.740> we<00:00:23.039> junk<00:00:23.310> so<00:00:24.119> this

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
little bits and pieces we junk so this

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:25.370 
little bits and pieces we junk so this
is<00:00:24.689> my<00:00:24.869> brain

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
is my brain

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.349 
is my brain
it's<00:00:25.769> made<00:00:26.039> of<00:00:26.130> a<00:00:26.220> paper<00:00:26.430> mache<00:00:26.820> in<00:00:26.970> a<00:00:27.000> balloon

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
it's made of a paper mache in a balloon

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.230 
it's made of a paper mache in a balloon
and<00:00:27.689> what<00:00:28.650> you<00:00:28.769> can<00:00:28.980> do<00:00:29.130> is<00:00:29.400> take<00:00:29.699> down<00:00:30.029> these

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
and what you can do is take down these

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.530 
and what you can do is take down these

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
three parts water and one part flour mix

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.830 
three parts water and one part flour mix
them<00:00:33.690> together<00:00:33.829> get<00:00:34.829> some<00:00:35.160> old<00:00:35.520> newspaper<00:00:36.120> and
