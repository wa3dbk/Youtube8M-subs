definitely we were expecting the how

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.260 
definitely we were expecting the how
first<00:01:27.600> seed<00:01:28.130> but<00:01:29.130> I<00:01:29.159> think<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.790> black<00:01:30.000> ops

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
first seed but I think the black ops

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.859 
first seed but I think the black ops
eating<00:01:30.540> points<00:01:30.869> were<00:01:31.400> yes<00:01:32.400> yes<00:01:32.850> yes<00:01:33.270> they<00:01:33.810> were

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.149 
and the online as well yeah yeah that's
that's<00:01:36.509> why<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.780> landlines<00:01:37.229> got<00:01:37.409> a<00:01:37.439> ir<00:01:37.979> seeds

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
that's why the landlines got a ir seeds

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.980 
that's why the landlines got a ir seeds
