needle you're gonna take string I took
about<00:00:05.220> my<00:00:05.490> arm's<00:00:05.910> length<00:00:06.000> of<00:00:06.390> a<00:00:06.509> string<00:00:06.870> and

00:00:07.419 --> 00:00:07.429 
about my arm's length of a string and

00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:10.520 
about my arm's length of a string and
you're<00:00:08.429> going<00:00:08.790> to<00:00:08.820> thread<00:00:09.450> it<00:00:09.570> to<00:00:09.780> through<00:00:10.260> the

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
you're going to thread it to through the

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.939 
you're going to thread it to through the
I<00:00:12.469> camera<00:00:13.469> through<00:00:13.920> the<00:00:14.070> eye<00:00:14.219> of<00:00:14.309> the<00:00:14.940> needle

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:15.949 
I camera through the eye of the needle

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:20.290 
I camera through the eye of the needle
okay<00:00:16.949> like<00:00:17.369> that<00:00:18.170> gonna<00:00:19.170> thread<00:00:19.529> it<00:00:19.680> through

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:20.300 
okay like that gonna thread it through

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.200 
okay like that gonna thread it through
and<00:00:21.300> then<00:00:21.949> pull<00:00:22.949> so<00:00:23.130> that<00:00:23.160> you<00:00:23.400> meet<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:23.939> two

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
and then pull so that you meet the two

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.849 
and then pull so that you meet the two
sides<00:00:24.600> of<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:25.080> thread<00:00:25.380> together

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:27.859 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:30.830 

and<00:00:28.859> you're<00:00:29.010> gonna<00:00:29.099> tie<00:00:29.400> a<00:00:29.429> knot<00:00:29.699> a<00:00:29.970> knot<00:00:30.359> at

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
and you're gonna tie a knot a knot at

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:37.459 
and you're gonna tie a knot a knot at
the<00:00:31.230> end<00:00:32.210> of<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.480> thread<00:00:33.780> and<00:00:35.870> I<00:00:36.870> would<00:00:37.020> do<00:00:37.170> two

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
the end of the thread and I would do two

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.319 
the end of the thread and I would do two
knots<00:00:37.739> for<00:00:38.010> safekeeping<00:00:38.250> on<00:00:38.850> top<00:00:39.030> of<00:00:39.210> one

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
knots for safekeeping on top of one

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.729 
knots for safekeeping on top of one
another<00:00:39.360> so<00:00:39.780> it<00:00:39.870> just<00:00:40.020> makes<00:00:40.140> one<00:00:40.350> bigger<00:00:40.620> or

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
another so it just makes one bigger or

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.619 
another so it just makes one bigger or
not<00:00:40.940> sometimes<00:00:41.940> you<00:00:42.059> don't<00:00:42.149> get<00:00:42.329> it<00:00:42.480> right

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
not sometimes you don't get it right

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.850 
not sometimes you don't get it right
away<00:00:42.750> there<00:00:43.559> we<00:00:43.649> go<00:00:43.829> so<00:00:44.280> now<00:00:45.500> we<00:00:46.500> have<00:00:46.680> our

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
away there we go so now we have our

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.029 
away there we go so now we have our
thread<00:00:47.390> so<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.600> first<00:00:48.899> piece<00:00:49.500> is<00:00:49.710> that<00:00:49.860> we're

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
thread so the first piece is that we're

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.459 
thread so the first piece is that we're
gonna<00:00:50.160> sew<00:00:50.399> together<00:00:50.640> is<00:00:51.120> we're<00:00:51.989> gonna<00:00:52.110> take

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
gonna sew together is we're gonna take

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.569 
gonna sew together is we're gonna take
one<00:00:53.219> of<00:00:53.520> our<00:00:53.730> sides<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:54.860> the<00:00:55.860> bottom<00:00:56.070> of<00:00:56.430> our

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
one of our sides and the bottom of our

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.529 
one of our sides and the bottom of our
mole<00:00:57.379> and<00:00:58.379> we<00:00:58.440> are<00:00:59.010> going<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.550> match<00:01:00.030> up<00:01:00.329> the

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
mole and we are going to match up the

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.880 
mole and we are going to match up the
pattern<00:01:00.960> sides<00:01:01.230> together<00:01:01.649> like<00:01:02.539> so<00:01:03.680> so<00:01:04.680> the

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
pattern sides together like so so the

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.289 
pattern sides together like so so the
feet<00:01:05.129> are<00:01:05.250> facing<00:01:05.369> one<00:01:05.670> another<00:01:05.700> in<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.119> back

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
feet are facing one another in the back

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.840 
feet are facing one another in the back
and<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.689> front<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:07.619> we<00:01:08.040> are<00:01:08.159> gonna<00:01:08.280> just<00:01:08.549> sew

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
and the front and we are gonna just sew

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.490 
and the front and we are gonna just sew
along<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:10.439> line<00:01:10.680> that<00:01:11.010> we<00:01:11.189> drew<00:01:11.930> so<00:01:12.930> starting

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
along the line that we drew so starting

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.109 
along the line that we drew so starting
at<00:01:14.869> you<00:01:15.869> can<00:01:16.020> start<00:01:16.290> at<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.729> front<00:01:17.729> doesn't

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
at you can start at the front doesn't

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.399 
at you can start at the front doesn't
really<00:01:18.240> matter<00:01:18.450> what<00:01:18.689> side<00:01:18.900> you<00:01:18.990> start<00:01:19.200> out

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
really matter what side you start out

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.620 
really matter what side you start out
but<00:01:19.500> you<00:01:19.590> start<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.920> front<00:01:20.240> and<00:01:21.240> we're<00:01:21.540> gonna

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
but you start the front and we're gonna

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.460 
but you start the front and we're gonna
put<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:21.900> needle<00:01:22.200> through<00:01:23.420> and<00:01:24.420> pull<00:01:24.689> tight<00:01:25.020> and

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
put a needle through and pull tight and

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.100 
put a needle through and pull tight and
just<00:01:26.400> sew<00:01:26.729> all<00:01:27.119> you<00:01:27.330> do<00:01:27.570> is<00:01:27.750> you<00:01:27.869> take<00:01:28.049> your

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
just sew all you do is you take your

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.530 
just sew all you do is you take your
needle<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.890> you<00:01:29.460> go<00:01:29.700> through<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.299> fabric

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
needle and you go through the fabric

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.670 
needle and you go through the fabric
Paul<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:32.540> then<00:01:33.540> through<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.140> fabric<00:01:34.350> just

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
Paul and then through the fabric just

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:41.539 
Paul and then through the fabric just
going<00:01:35.280> down<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.549> line<00:01:38.000> okay<00:01:39.950> just<00:01:40.950> continuing

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
going down the line okay just continuing

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.090 
going down the line okay just continuing
down<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.909> line<00:01:42.119> until<00:01:42.479> you<00:01:43.020> get<00:01:43.290> to<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.890> other

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
down the line until you get to the other

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.420 
down the line until you get to the other
side<00:01:44.490> just<00:01:45.259> like<00:01:46.259> so<00:01:46.680> so<00:01:47.159> you're<00:01:47.280> eventually

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
side just like so so you're eventually

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.190 
side just like so so you're eventually
gonna<00:01:47.729> get<00:01:47.970> some<00:01:48.180> stitches<00:01:48.450> that<00:01:48.869> will<00:01:49.049> look

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
gonna get some stitches that will look

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.960 
gonna get some stitches that will look
like<00:01:49.259> this<00:01:49.680> you're<00:01:50.310> gonna<00:01:50.399> go<00:01:50.579> all<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:50.939> way

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
like this you're gonna go all the way

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.490 
like this you're gonna go all the way
down<00:01:51.299> tracing<00:01:51.990> just<00:01:53.509> just<00:01:54.509> along<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.259> bottom

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
down tracing just just along the bottom

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.660 
down tracing just just along the bottom
of<00:01:55.740> our<00:01:56.130> mole<00:01:56.430> so<00:01:57.030> up<00:01:57.180> to<00:01:57.329> here<00:01:57.689> so<00:01:58.640> take<00:01:59.640> a

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
of our mole so up to here so take a

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.510 
of our mole so up to here so take a
moment<00:01:59.909> and<00:02:00.180> do<00:02:00.299> that<00:02:00.479> yourself<00:02:01.250> okay<00:02:02.250> once

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
moment and do that yourself okay once

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.330 
moment and do that yourself okay once
you<00:02:02.700> have<00:02:02.729> sewn<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.600> bottom<00:02:04.140> part<00:02:04.530> of<00:02:04.740> your

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
you have sewn the bottom part of your

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.819 
you have sewn the bottom part of your
first<00:02:05.700> side<00:02:05.969> to<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.450> bottom<00:02:06.750> of<00:02:06.869> your<00:02:06.899> mole<00:02:07.170> to

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
first side to the bottom of your mole to

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.880 
first side to the bottom of your mole to
tie<00:02:08.099> off<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.489> string<00:02:09.229> best<00:02:10.229> way<00:02:10.530> that<00:02:10.560> I've

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
tie off the string best way that I've

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:11.940 
tie off the string best way that I've
learned<00:02:11.190> how<00:02:11.310> to<00:02:11.340> do<00:02:11.640> it

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
learned how to do it

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.800 
learned how to do it
is<00:02:12.010> when<00:02:12.640> you<00:02:12.760> get<00:02:12.879> to<00:02:12.940> the<00:02:13.060> end<00:02:13.239> you<00:02:13.480> make<00:02:13.660> a

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
is when you get to the end you make a

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.780 
is when you get to the end you make a
little<00:02:14.050> you<00:02:14.470> stitch<00:02:15.129> kind<00:02:15.400> of<00:02:15.489> through<00:02:15.670> the

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
little you stitch kind of through the

stitches<00:03:54.880> on<00:03:54.970> the<00:03:55.060> bottom<00:03:55.389> a<00:03:55.540> little

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:56.109 
stitches on the bottom a little

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:58.410 
stitches on the bottom a little
suggestion<00:03:56.590> the<00:03:57.220> smaller<00:03:57.670> the<00:03:57.940> stitches<00:03:58.389> you

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
suggestion the smaller the stitches you

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.289 
suggestion the smaller the stitches you
make<00:03:58.810> the<00:03:59.380> more<00:04:00.040> secure<00:04:00.579> your<00:04:00.760> mole<00:04:00.970> will<00:04:01.180> be

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:01.299 
make the more secure your mole will be

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:03.330 
make the more secure your mole will be
so<00:04:01.569> my<00:04:01.720> stitches<00:04:02.079> are<00:04:02.200> kind<00:04:02.410> of<00:04:02.470> big<00:04:02.709> over<00:04:03.010> here

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
so my stitches are kind of big over here

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.759 
so my stitches are kind of big over here
but<00:04:03.910> starting<00:04:04.239> on<00:04:04.329> this<00:04:04.510> side<00:04:04.720> I<00:04:04.750> used<00:04:05.079> smaller

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:05.769 
but starting on this side I used smaller

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:07.830 
but starting on this side I used smaller
stitches<00:04:06.340> so<00:04:06.519> I<00:04:06.549> suggest<00:04:07.030> using<00:04:07.329> smaller

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
stitches so I suggest using smaller

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.009 
stitches so I suggest using smaller
stitches<00:04:08.260> but<00:04:08.500> that's<00:04:08.680> I'm<00:04:09.340> a<00:04:09.459> preference<00:04:10.150> so

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:11.019 
stitches but that's I'm a preference so

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:12.180 
stitches but that's I'm a preference so
what<00:04:11.139> we're<00:04:11.260> gonna<00:04:11.319> do<00:04:11.590> now<00:04:11.769> is<00:04:11.950> we're<00:04:12.130> gonna

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
what we're gonna do now is we're gonna

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:13.819 
what we're gonna do now is we're gonna

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:13.829 
sew the top of the mold together

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:16.740

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
the way to about two inches maybe three

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.400 
the way to about two inches maybe three
before<00:04:42.250> the<00:04:42.670> back<00:04:42.880> of<00:04:43.120> our<00:04:43.240> mall<00:04:43.480> because<00:04:44.260> we

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
before the back of our mall because we

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.710 
before the back of our mall because we
need<00:04:44.620> a<00:04:44.650> little<00:04:44.830> space<00:04:45.310> so<00:04:46.030> we<00:04:46.180> can<00:04:46.330> flip<00:04:46.540> our

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 
need a little space so we can flip our

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.840 
need a little space so we can flip our
mole<00:04:46.930> right<00:04:47.590> side<00:04:47.860> out<00:04:48.040> and<00:04:48.100> then<00:04:48.430> we<00:04:48.640> will

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:48.850 
mole right side out and then we will

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:51.480 
mole right side out and then we will
stuff<00:04:49.540> our<00:04:49.840> mole<00:04:50.080> and<00:04:50.320> then<00:04:50.620> continue<00:04:51.280> sewing

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:51.490 
stuff our mole and then continue sewing

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.490 
stuff our mole and then continue sewing
it<00:04:51.790> shut<00:04:52.030> so<00:04:52.450> we'll<00:04:52.600> get<00:04:52.720> there<00:04:52.930> in<00:04:53.020> a<00:04:53.080> moment

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:53.500

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.910 
it shut so we'll get there in a moment
so<00:04:54.330> still<00:04:55.330> being<00:04:55.750> flipped<00:04:56.050> inside<00:04:56.320> out<00:04:56.380> so

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:56.920 
so still being flipped inside out so

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.700 
so still being flipped inside out so

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 
right before the back of our mall we

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.710 
right before the back of our mall we
have<00:05:13.960> now<00:05:14.140> sewn<00:05:14.590> all<00:05:14.950> sides<00:05:15.880> of<00:05:16.300> our<00:05:16.540> mole

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:16.720 
have now sewn all sides of our mole

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.460 
have now sewn all sides of our mole
together<00:05:17.910> right<00:05:18.910> so<00:05:19.480> what<00:05:19.630> we're<00:05:19.750> gonna<00:05:19.810> do<00:05:20.169> is

that we still haven't sewn shut you're
gonna<00:05:26.560> flip<00:05:26.980> our<00:05:27.220> mole<00:05:27.520> right<00:05:28.150> side<00:05:28.419> out<00:05:28.450> so

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:29.169 
gonna flip our mole right side out so

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:31.770 
gonna flip our mole right side out so
that<00:05:29.290> our<00:05:29.320> fabric<00:05:29.830> shows<00:05:30.330> I'm<00:05:31.330> gonna<00:05:31.540> flip<00:05:31.750> it

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:41.970 
wait okay get the front side of our mole

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:44.940 
wait okay get the front side of our mole
and<00:05:42.970> I'll<00:05:43.090> flip<00:05:43.300> it<00:05:43.419> inside<00:05:43.600> out<00:05:43.830> find<00:05:44.830> the

all right so here we have or writes it
out<00:06:01.919> mole<00:06:02.360> so<00:06:03.360> there's<00:06:03.540> the<00:06:03.690> front<00:06:03.930> there's

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:04.350 
out mole so there's the front there's

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:05.210 
out mole so there's the front there's
the<00:06:04.500> face

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:05.220 
the face

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:09.350 
the face
there's<00:06:05.760> the<00:06:05.940> little<00:06:06.180> feet<00:06:06.510> in<00:06:07.139> the<00:06:07.290> back<00:06:08.360> this

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:09.360 
there's the little feet in the back this

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.140 
there's the little feet in the back this
is<00:06:09.570> pretty<00:06:09.810> flat<00:06:10.050> and<00:06:10.590> so<00:06:11.370> we<00:06:11.639> need<00:06:11.820> to<00:06:11.910> stuff
