00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
just too egotistical to realize that

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.420 
just too egotistical to realize that
there<00:01:20.369> are<00:01:20.400> gonna<00:01:20.729> be<00:01:20.909> better<00:01:21.090> players<00:01:21.420> than

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
them sometimes and hacks or not that

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.499 
them sometimes and hacks or not that
that<00:01:27.240> common<00:01:27.720> even<00:01:27.990> on<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.229> pc<00:01:28.590> version<00:01:28.619> of

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
that common even on the pc version of

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:32.210 
that common even on the pc version of
video<00:01:30.509> games<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:31.140> i<00:01:31.380> just<00:01:31.650> think<00:01:31.890> that<00:01:31.950> it's

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
video games and i just think that it's

video games and i just think that it's
kind<00:01:32.400> of<00:01:32.430> silly<00:01:32.640> that<00:01:32.909> people<00:01:33.299> are<00:01:33.659> just<00:01:33.869> so

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
kind of silly that people are just so

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.499 
kind of silly that people are just so
full<00:01:34.619> of<00:01:34.770> themselves<00:01:35.189> that<00:01:35.310> they<00:01:35.880> think<00:01:36.360> that

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
full of themselves that they think that

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.539 
full of themselves that they think that
if<00:01:37.229> if<00:01:37.530> you're<00:01:37.740> better<00:01:38.130> than<00:01:38.310> them<00:01:38.490> then<00:01:38.820> that

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
if if you're better than them then that

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:44.539 
if if you're better than them then that
