00:00:01.379 --> 00:00:04.600
 m 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.180
 then to note that I like a lot that is really very very 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:11.279
 succeeded hrs huskies and a year of uranium that is really very very beautiful 

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:16.330
 May 18 at the 18th and servette is stronger than others on coup by 

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:16.960
 stroke 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.099
 this figure takes 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:21.099
 the preceding month 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.609
 we were stronger 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.239
 e totally flat conquered by kurt rambis war like the other he is 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:28.789
 really well integrated 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:30.960
 with yet a battery that is 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.969
 perfectly the image of the crisis 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.030
 flat nine stations 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.080
 for the time of flat batteries 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.080
 is he going to fit under the machine at the beginning level 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.329
 during this first act 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.520
 it's a girl 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.790
 if mimi by losing 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.590
 and here also have the famous insurance system 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.700
 to be able to change the memory without having to leave a journalist who if he 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.400
 did not manage by default 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.340
 changed transport compared to what I mean very easily 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:59.190
 here 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.230
 no need to turn they are small jobs 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.170
 turnkey for easy access for a long time 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.410
 in the case of a crime 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.620
 what to put back in place 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:14.410
 another very positive point honda I'm totally not match if you see well 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:15.590
 hidden 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.030
 it is totally so pretty so successful morning and a slight textures here 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.030
 in white textures 20:10 peaceful very small cells it's true 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.820
 it's nice it's pretty pretty 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:27.980
 on both sides 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.380
 and we have a small silver edging on the back kino reminder a little bit 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.320
 because we will find in the machine the black version it reaches 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:38.500
 in aluminium 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.800
 we have this kind of waste and brushed metal 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.040
 again so johnny and below we have the same shares of citigoup have 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.040
 in the nose in black version not much difference 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.729
 it's possible to measure silver no longer normal inside 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.150
 it's different 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.060
 from a sharp political point of view 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.610
 we stay on very classic 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.610
 wal-mart the sdhc card reader 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.210
 the two gold 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.229
 usual jack 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.639
 comcast micro that two usb ports yet in peace and the famous sport 

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:18.019
 eternal sundstrand debate that allow to exploit them but without 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:20.989
 take the whole place somehow to take back the hand 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:22.630
 the power port 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.880
 on the other side a port vga a port that is really at the limit that 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.599
 even exceeds the fdu 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:29.729
 bread and the frame very lightly 

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:32.749
 third, the ideas that we are con aeration that the anti-theft 

00:02:34.419 --> 00:02:37.829
 you can see it's really full screen is very very strong basing 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:40.019
 on the rails the cr 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:41.770
 pretty successful in escaping group 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:45.920
 and when we love we learn lots of surprises points in rest bumping into 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.929
 aluminum 

00:02:47.929 --> 00:02:51.699
 the same material so it's really the same the same chassis as Chileans 

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:53.989
 are conscientious you have to try 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:56.229
 emerge physical keyboard keys 

00:02:56.229 --> 00:03:00.329
 a video that I have that the previous so the loop that is well done 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:04.029
 with arrow keys a good solution arrow keys here 

00:03:04.029 --> 00:03:06.929
 we're not at all anymore I'm completely crushed are they are 

00:03:06.929 --> 00:03:09.969
 really exploitable function been moved sometimes left spaces 

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:11.759
 required 

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:13.749
 1 detective 

00:03:13.749 --> 00:03:16.429
 again different from the others 

00:03:16.429 --> 00:03:20.410
 so he is completely separated from the rest by remaining subjects 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.280
 here is plastic but we go in the materials that they are well 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.450
 treated the same way as you see it no longer really doubt 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:27.099
 clique 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:29.850
 in fact you have to click on the bottom of the touch zone 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.059
 there is a slight textures on this area 

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:34.349
 why censorship and fingertips 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:39.159
 it's really our touchpad model and it expands the claims this is 

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:40.110
 compared to the screen 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:44.370
 the croatian cantelli reversed compared to November 2008 unfortunately 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.519
 this the screen is brilliant 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:49.780
 the screen is glossy and screen outline is treated in a matte way 

00:03:49.779 --> 00:03:51.419
 worry 

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:54.419
 of treatment according to him these plastics 

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:58.739
 it's quite pretty this second round of great apes to have a brilliant screen 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:03:59.559
 latest 

00:03:59.559 --> 00:04:02.559
 action accor the colors are passed Thursday 

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:05.650
 the side has had the rear part of the worker 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.510
 as before and resumed 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.759
 inside a small area of ​​luminy abyssinia 

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:14.359
 china's plane his bills we really felt very good very 

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:17.469
 manipulator did a very good game really taste of the months it's very 

00:04:17.469 --> 00:04:20.930
 very close beforehand makes it also be placed thicker 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.180
 to participate in this impression the world 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.740
 what pride of comfort 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:29.060
 the chair very well proportioned the touchpad ask what is a 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.920
 machine that are walking a total 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.940
 my goal is to help the models the previous model the radio is rendered 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.870
 more chain at 399 euros 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:41.100
 derosier specifications are expected a big big revolution simply 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.969
 threat 

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:44.400
 we shot with 255 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:49.960
 as long as we have memory type ddr3 we approach the memory ddr3 205 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.770
 hard drive candidates in the heads of all members of the n-type wifi 21 10 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:56.259
 euros and there it is not at all 

00:04:56.259 --> 00:04:57.819
 guillaume of the sea level 

00:04:57.819 --> 00:05:00.449
 a whole battery that allows battery modules to 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:02.449
 Lagardère 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:06.770
 we expect the craziest critics the part so I'm 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:08.569
 the palm rest 

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:11.569
 this is really a nice machine very nice to use 

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:13.849
 these successes m 

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:16.029
 in black version 

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:18.659
 it stands out not bad compared to other causes 

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:21.339
 because we were really very nice so we got a machine 

00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:24.659
 which is both pretty obvious very fine very light very nice to 

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:25.260
 use 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:29.030
 and who proposes afterwards about 10 hours 11 minutes negligence committed 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:31.270
 in autonomy with its li-po battery 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:32.639
 so that's really something 

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:36.309
 very nice that slides easily into a bag that takes no spaces 

00:05:36.309 --> 00:05:38.120
 it's really cool 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:42.189
 you're not the most successful just by the way out of the first kiss 

00:05:42.189 --> 00:05:45.489
 it's really at the point that grows very accurate very strongly 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:47.520
 very discretly 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.650
 ventilation is not heard at all 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:52.650
 and it's very nice to halt 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:56.800
 so this Saturday, September 18th they also have already turn to a fund 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.550
 who will have to arrive 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:59.460
 really these women
