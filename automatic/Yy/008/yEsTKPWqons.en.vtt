00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 let's take the roof fish which is a 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.350
 little fish you see already approaching 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.269
 look it smells like fish right from 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.730
 away which then are two meters though 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:17.330
 even dragons want fish over 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.330
 the girls who go from Ascoli know 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:34.070
 one thing I'm chunk today is here for 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.949
 to present you a new fashion the fashion of 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:40.400
 today it is the goldman smog 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:43.100
 let's start with today's fashion was ways 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:46.010
 that you asked me in so many and I have 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.410
 decided today to bring it to you and then 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.900
 I warn you that you will find these days 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:53.350
 almost every day a review of fashions 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:56.030
 because they finally let it out 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:59.300
 some updated way updated to 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.100
 1 point certain point 10 not new fashions ok 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.829
 the fashions are practically always the 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.000
 themselves are updated with new ones 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:07.130
 functionality 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.259
 someone is new but comes out but is not 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.789
 so much so until it introduces 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:14.690
 something interesting I decide not to 

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:17.149
 bring her a very small thing there or 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:20.090
 triggered an uproar in the last video 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:22.160
 because I said minecraft is dying 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.320
 I didn't say that I stop doing 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.490
 minecraft there is someone is understood piece 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.229
 now you thought so 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.539
 I never said that I stop doing 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:31.160
 minecraft I said that in my opinion 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:33.289
 minecraft if you do not give a nice one 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.390
 woke up and not introduce something 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:37.069
 new that is a new feature that 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.190
 is a new update anyway 

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:42.140
 something new here will happen one 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:45.349
 catastrophe because it is a game that is 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.500
 gone out of fashion until two months ago 

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:50.030
 months ago it could really decay 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.610
 however let's move on to the review of 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:56.090
 this fashion is a very short fad and 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:58.250
 simple but interesting the dragon mouse 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.190
 mode introduces us the possibility 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.119
 finally to use the dragons of 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.369
 land 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:07.489
 as you know when you defeat the boss 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:10.640
 of land that is lander dragon what happens 

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:12.980
 there is too much the egg with fifty 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.500
 globes of experience and more gives us to 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.780
 portal to take this egg of 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.160
 usually what you had to use 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.200
 you couldn't not talk to the piston 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.849
 love because the egg disappeared broke 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:27.680
 you had to take it with a beautiful one 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:29.390
 piston so we unplugged the egg ce 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.480
 we took it we brought it home like 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:35.390
 pretty useless trophy ok this way 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.640
 found the purpose of this egg us 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:41.030
 let's put the man in quotation marks 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:43.519
 new we place place on the ground and 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.200
 let's wait for what to take out 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:48.349
 will appear from this egg 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.180
 well this and her jason which is a 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:51.620
 a little different from the inter jangle 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.249
 normal because it wo n't start at 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:57.709
 fluttering everywhere is more an under the go 

00:02:55.249 --> 00:03:00.739
 let's say peaceful at the beginning why 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:02.079
 we will have to be careful not to attack it 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:05.599
 what happens when we write it 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:07.909
 we can say domesticate well it is 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:09.409
 very nice to have a domestic dragon ve 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:12.590
 I can confirm it because in mine 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:14.959
 garden or a domestic dragon for those who do 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.760
 he was asking questions is true I have 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.689
 a driving garden are more a man with 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.180
 a dragon 

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:23.150
 let's take the roof off the bullshit 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.400
 fish that is a little fish you see already yes 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.739
 come closer look smell fish 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.930
 from a distance that are two 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:33.049
 meters however also the dragons want the 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:36.499
 fish besides the girls that beat 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:38.870
 I know how to listen to it we see it astonishes and 

00:03:36.499 --> 00:03:42.049
 expect the hearts to reappear is 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:45.079
 suddenly it will be our dragon 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:47.180
 very nice but useless for now because 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:49.430
 besides giving us a look function 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.730
 let's see if it defends us because I remember 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:54.680
 old versions also defended me 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:57.529
 we have to see that way 0 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:00.139
 hello dragon oh yes as you see defends us 

00:03:57.529 --> 00:04:02.239
 the practically shocked good dragon you 

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:02.900
 I give another fish because you've been 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:04.639
 very good 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:08.299
 what we need to need 

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:10.819
 a sadoul of a very trivial not me 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:14.659
 I remember what it's called. I think it is a saddle 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:16.519
 exactly we place it on the cav all'under 

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:18.350
 jangle because I like to call it that 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:19.040
 seeing that even done well look at it 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.320
 tightens 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.690
 also excellent below and graphics 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.850
 the place that would be like appears 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:28.130
 I said the saddle first the right button 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:30.740
 and now we are on the back of our dragon 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:34.610
 and here we can fly 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:37.449
 r to fly up and down then if I blico 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:40.270
 r practically flies su se griko f 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:43.150
 back down then the animation a lot 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.590
 beautiful a flaw which I do not know if they have it 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:47.379
 introduced this way but I don't think so 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:50.169
 indeed it would be nice to shoot the 

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:53.650
 fireballs would be a little over power 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:55.900
 but let's say it would be very nice 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.520
 also because flying is enough can be 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.349
 very useful as a means of transport 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.150
 but if there was also the possibility of 

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:03.610
 attack right from the inter dragon 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:05.469
 it would really be a fake movie 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.539
 I was going to say I don't know why it is me 

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:09.580
 so exit is practically could 

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:11.740
 make battles a little eragon for 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.419
 who had read the book then boys 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:15.789
 this was the fashion of today a very way 

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:17.259
 simple very nice get ready for i 

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:18.789
 next videos because they will be on way 

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:21.310
 really fantastic that they have been 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:22.449
 updated in an exceptional way 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:23.979
 subscribe to the channel if you don't already have it 

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:25.779
 fact left a nice like we come to 

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:27.729
 But it is we light a thousand civilians 

00:05:25.779 --> 00:05:30.029
 we went on lost everything bye 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:30.029
 all
