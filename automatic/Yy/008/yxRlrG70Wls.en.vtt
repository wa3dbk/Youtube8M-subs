frets<00:03:36.700> of<00:03:37.090> Gibson<00:03:37.840> and<00:03:38.370> agile<00:03:39.370> don't<00:03:40.000> have<00:03:40.560> so

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
frets of Gibson and agile don't have so

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.190 
frets of Gibson and agile don't have so
let's<00:03:43.930> get<00:03:44.320> our<00:03:44.500> proof<00:03:44.740> so<00:03:45.040> you<00:03:45.280> got<00:03:46.200> hotter

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
let's get our proof so you got hotter

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.020 
let's get our proof so you got hotter
pickups<00:03:47.680> that<00:03:47.950> make<00:03:48.340> make<00:03:48.580> make<00:03:48.610> some

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
pickups that make make make some

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:54.150 
pickups that make make make some
difference<00:03:49.210> as<00:03:49.510> well<00:03:50.040> so<00:03:52.230> so<00:03:53.230> i<00:03:53.290> think<00:03:53.590> i<00:03:53.920> think

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
difference as well so so i think i think

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.070 
difference as well so so i think i think
it's<00:03:54.490> not<00:03:54.640> for<00:03:54.910> one<00:03:55.270> hundred<00:03:55.330> percent<00:03:55.510> to<00:03:55.870> to

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.080 
it's not for one hundred percent to to

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:02.420 
it's not for one hundred percent to to
compare<00:03:57.150> this<00:03:58.150> edge<00:03:58.390> of<00:03:58.570> guitar<00:03:58.930> to<00:04:00.270> to<00:04:01.270> those

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
compare this edge of guitar to to those

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.850 
compare this edge of guitar to to those
high-end<00:04:03.430> guitars<00:04:03.990> although<00:04:04.990> i'm<00:04:05.200> telling

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 
high-end guitars although i'm telling
