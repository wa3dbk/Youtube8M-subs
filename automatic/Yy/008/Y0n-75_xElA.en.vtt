00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:09.540
 Hello and welcome to this 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.850
 blog nice that we are here for the 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.350
 feathered friends are here today 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:14.370
 Chicken 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.130
 I want to lose a few words about it 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.769
 as I thought with the chickens 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:21.300
 should continue to run in the future 

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:22.589
 24 students but I will come 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.990
 Immediately to speak of which varieties 

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:28.710
 and then whole is supposed to run like this 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.970
 the half goes away every year and the 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.289
 the other half is that I have one 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.690
 great of two years i have 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.700
 The sussex did not know that 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.300
 they are ten in the last few days 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.940
 been 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.470
 they lay out every day so put in the 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.000
 the second year they are still full in 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.780
 legwork makes little sense 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.600
 exchange 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:49.620
 so always something about 6 cents white 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.700
 I bought everything dark chickens there 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.240
 I do not need to press around to 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.990
 lament 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:56.700
 So just the new ones in the next 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.620
 year next spring , the sexy ones go 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.790
 white and white again 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.410
 to so little in 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:04.589
 better to get away every year 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.090
 so what in the pot what land 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.380
 I was worried that is 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.240
 different varieties I do not know 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.549
 rothlÃ¤nder could probably get ran 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.479
 I'm not sure 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:14.399
 Ultimately, we do not play any role 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.490
 yes no no professional status is 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:19.859
 yes just to produce the little 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.259
 You can cut the pan and make it the right way 

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:23.549
 not when neighbors on the 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:25.890
 Afternoon coffee table after sitting 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:31.770
 I still had him briefly the wings to 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:36.960
 We make it easy to tinker 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:38.819
 I'm right here so then fell 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.679
 and then into the stall 

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:43.219
 there are already two others waiting for the 10th 

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:43.219
 can compensate 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.550
 Since then we have proven that 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:52.230
 then nothing is small anymore 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.230
 more swept through the area 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:04.840
 no, so that you become happy 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:06.370
 will be nine more this year 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.900
 worried elsewhere so I'm with 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.750
 to pick but were my at least from 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:13.080
 a gate like I'm over 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:20.080
 Lazy Switzerland 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:22.690
 yes yes yes yes peaceful brown-black 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:29.110
 would save roth countries were also there 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:32.250
 is even in the middle of it and I think he 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.250
 you stay here 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:39.330
 I think with this division 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.330
 we made a good choice 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.170
 which are now supported a bit 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.459
 I probably would have too 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.060
 you can see that further cuts 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:54.910
 the feathers catch on here but be 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.190
 we can not carry on now 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:02.459
 the area is another one 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:07.209
 Residents in our small domicile 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:09.250
 i have no traveling with you 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:11.410
 chickens worried now likely 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:14.709
 But more eggs are added to the production 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.690
 I am very happy with the day 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:18.040
 satisfied 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.060
 if they are not the dark ones now 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.030
 here from this year in the not 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.340
 do as well as the sussex then 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.640
 I am satisfied 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.640
 because on the rhine 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.500
 Of course you could ask yourself now 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.540
 whether all this chicken-keeping at all 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:38.410
 is profitable 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:41.290
 I think so because the profitable the 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.330
 we assume so chicken puts 180 eggs in 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.569
 year 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:50.709
 maybe it will be more meaty and less 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:54.190
 that say 200 eggs then that's 20 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:56.410
 Crates are round so take always bio 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:59.350
 eggs at 50 60 euros 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.630
 the thuner eight euro costs thus can 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:03.760
 I live 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:06.220
 then there's now so I guess that 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.170
 is quite profitable even if you do that 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.440
 feed is included here on the 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:13.690
 ways to get cheaper food 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:18.269
 but I work on it I always get 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:21.060
 so many ask for chicken videos 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:23.530
 I do not know everything 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.190
 but he is so easy which ones 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.680
 to keep 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:29.169
 there's still the chic tractor is there 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.850
 the link that you can create yourself in the 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:34.060
 gardening is like that 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:37.390
 quietly wait a minute silence her stop times 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:40.600
 nothing happens does not hurt is that 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:43.390
 hair cuts there is cut off 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:46.450
 one has seen and the other side as 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:52.300
 comparison so the flight looks complete 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:54.910
 from so and so I know that yourself 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.190
 now again for days just in here 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:05:00.160
 stop 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.700
 By the way, the 29 back there are green 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.260
 lehner 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:03.550
 we'll have another look at the 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.350
 has been doing the sit since 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.410
 meet around the back and move 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:09.430
 not a meter out of the corner 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:15.039
 probably will be a long time 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:17.330
 fashion and gezeter give up the the 

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:21.210
 have fought 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:23.310
 That's why I'm a few 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:26.040
 but nervous brush we write 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:29.250
 to be small yes I do you yes 

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:30.960
 nothing at all if I'm right there the 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:33.330
 sense of the thing be the lay green eggs 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.800
 or greenish eggs and there should the sun 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:36.650
 be healthy or not 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:39.690
 harmful as normal 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:40.710
 somehow cholesterol tasted on the spot 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:43.140
 one does not become one now 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:45.150
 if it's me for the pure 

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:47.690
 then I would go 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:49.920
 probably keep hybrid chickens 

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:52.980
 but we have one of them and 

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:56.370
 diesel hybrid chickens like to lay though 

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:58.670
 put a lot of eggs but there is 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:58.670
 nothing to it 

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:08.580
 But there are more new additions to the 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:10.010
 birds but about it in the next movie is 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:12.000
 not a nice sight 

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:12.960
 So I always find it 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.560
 fascinating 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:18.510
 as far as the new chickens 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.880
 Who wants to know more recently in the garden 

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:21.990
 lures youtube channel he has there I have 

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:25.140
 still a few to the left of others film 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:27.030
 clicked on by me click view 

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:27.600
 on the other side the link to 

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:28.740
 subscribe to 

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:32.790
 that can not hurt because they exist 

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:34.140
 a lot of interesting things always life 

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:37.470
 makes a family more interesting 

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:38.850
 trying to live better and more naturally 

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:41.480
 up soon 

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:41.480
 bye
