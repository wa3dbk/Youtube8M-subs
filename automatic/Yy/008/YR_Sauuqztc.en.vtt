00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.160
Diego: So now we're going to show you what
a Castegata [sp?] looks like.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.860
We call this nowadays a burleo front.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:17.710
Anna: We're going to take this front burleo
[sp?] or Castegata from a rock step.

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:24.460
So the partner will take you into a rock step
and as he brings you forward, you bring your

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.539
feet together and there will be a similar
whipping sensation as the Back Ocho but this

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:35.070
time knees together and you're going to come
around the front making sure your knees stay

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.140
together and you don't have any space.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.790
That it's closed.

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:41.170
Yes?

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.430
So one more time.

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:52.270
Side, from a rock step, forward, whipping
sensation, and he'll bring you back.

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:57.690
Rock step, forward, whipping sensation and
he'll bring you back.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.469
So the Castegata will look like this.

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:06.960
You're going to go from a rock step and using
the same opposition to create that whipping

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.539
sensation that your partner will lead.

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:13.580
So making sure that you keep your chest to
your partner and you're going to turn your

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:19.890
hips and your knees are going to stay together,
no space.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.940
And that's the forward burleo Castegata.

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.440
Now Diego will teach you the lead.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:25.520
Diego: OK.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.009
Let's take this from the basic.

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:33.320
So we're going to go side, forward into a
forward step, rock step, step back with her

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:34.670
forward step.

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.040
Now from that forward step that she takes
you, you're going to lead her into a Forward

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:45.200
Ocho and as she finds the last moment of the
Forward Ocho you're going to step into it

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.780
to create the Castegata.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:47.780
OK?

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:57.030
So, you got rock step, step with her and step
around her as you lead her.

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.030
OK?

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.470
This is better demonstrated with a partner
so let's take a look.

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.479
Side, forward, forward, rock step to a back
step.

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.420
She does a forward step.

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.910
Lead into a Forward Ocho and at the last minute-.

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.900
Let's try that one more time.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.380
And at the last minute you come to it by shifting-,
by taking a step side.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.210
From here you're going to end up on a cross
system-based system so you can close with

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.810
a cross basic.

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:49.370
Rock, step, back, lead it, rock, and (?).

00:02:49.370 --> 00:03:00.850
