really I did I wasn't a skeptical I
didn't<00:03:13.300> think<00:03:13.420> it<00:03:13.600> would<00:03:13.720> work<00:03:13.780> but<00:03:14.320> I<00:03:14.380> didn't

think<00:03:15.040> it<00:03:15.160> would<00:03:15.250> work<00:03:15.310> the<00:03:15.460> Senate<00:03:16.000> have<00:03:16.180> in

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
think it would work the Senate have in

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.330 
think it would work the Senate have in
the<00:03:16.480> time<00:03:16.690> it<00:03:16.840> has<00:03:16.990> then<00:03:17.620> it<00:03:17.770> kind<00:03:18.010> of<00:03:18.070> made<00:03:18.250> me

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
the time it has then it kind of made me

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.910 
the time it has then it kind of made me
realize<00:03:18.370> that<00:03:18.880> and<00:03:19.270> a<00:03:20.230> lot<00:03:20.620> more<00:03:20.650> can<00:03:20.890> be

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
realize that and a lot more can be

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.290 
realize that and a lot more can be
achieved<00:03:21.070> in<00:03:21.400> a<00:03:21.460> startup<00:03:21.700> there's<00:03:21.940> a<00:03:22.060> time

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:22.300 
achieved in a startup there's a time
