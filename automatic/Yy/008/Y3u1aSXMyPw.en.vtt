00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:12.260
 many scold gaming laptops for 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:13.400
 high cost and questionable 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.830
 performance 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.500
 but other options for playing on vacation 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.720
 away from civilization you still don't have 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.850
 Yes, and sometimes there are models that 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.340
 ready to compete in power with 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.590
 desktop computers new 17 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.570
 inch model from asus claims 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:34.070
 the title of the most powerful gaming notebook 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:36.739
 already the fact that the g750jh got 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.019
 latest nvidia geforce gtx graphics card 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:41.329
 880m says a lot 

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:43.879
 when developing a design for the j series bass 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:46.280
 inspired by stealth technology no 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:48.170
 rounded edges and matt 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.920
 the surface looks exactly like 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:54.229
 fighter but does not fly 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.760
 the laptop is heavy and big therefore 

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:56.839
 carrying it with you is not the most pleasant 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.909
 occupation 

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:01.249
 Well, unless you decide to lose extra 

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:03.710
 there is nothing superfluous on the body 

00:01:01.249 --> 00:01:05.780
 put a glowing rog logo on the cover 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.030
 she has an aluminum work surface there 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.910
 only the keyboard is big and comfortable 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.400
 touchpad and stylized power button 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:15.860
 hinge cover is not located on the very edge 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.750
 enclosures a little closer due to almost 5 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.400
 kilogram mass open laptop 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.500
 can easily one hand nothing 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.660
 it is not necessary to hold interesting 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.790
 placed connectors their main number 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:29.180
 is on the right they are on the left 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:32.540
 here vga and hdmi output is not a network connector 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:35.510
 a pair of high-speed ports usb 30 audio 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.050
 microphone and headphone jacks hit them 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.750
 season 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:41.390
 interface thunderbolt which integrates 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.250
 in itself write express and displayport to it 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.290
 chain can connect up to 6 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.950
 Peripheral paths are hard 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:51.590
 drives or monitors on the left all 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:55.910
 more modest here blu-ray drive 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:57.890
 2 ports usb 30 and card reader in general 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.900
 right-handed, this port placement may 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.640
 they like they got used to that right 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.100
 the side is practically occupied with nothing 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:07.540
 so if you insert a flash drive it can 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.540
 there is a certain discomfort 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.750
 the back is what wonderful 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.220
 reserved for dual cooling system 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.709
 specific air intakes just 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.140
 are its air vents 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:22.390
 so hot air will not 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.489
 blow your hands whether you're right handed or left handed 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.800
 the keyboard is very nice and even with 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:29.349
 backlit keys and full-size 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.599
 habits do not require a cursor block 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:33.459
 displayed just below so not too 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:35.739
 there is a digital block 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:37.959
 on the quality of the assembly claims in principle 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:40.510
 No, but we did find a couple of controversial places. 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:42.549
 here is not enough rigidity and under 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.430
 screen housing is not so tight 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:47.680
 but this stuff we note that we got caught 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.120
 test sample without cyrillic but in 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.610
 selling you will find exclusively 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.530
 localized screen models 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.450
 looking ahead I will say that it is 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.579
 the only serious complaint 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.829
 the creators of this notebook are prejudices 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:01.930
 about the reaction rate of the ps matrix 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:04.390
 still force manufacturers 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:07.180
 game models use tn display 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:10.500
 + film with unsatisfactory angles 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.500
 vertical view 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.880
 but with the color rendition everything is fine 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:18.459
 even some models will envy 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.620
 monitors on emf great color 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:22.959
 range smooth gamma performance and 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.900
 color temperature but all this stuff 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:29.049
 the main thing in the gaming laptop is the power hidden 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:32.799
 under the body and g750 jay-z can give 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:34.120
 a head start to many desktop computers here 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:36.459
 installed one of the fastest 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.609
 mobile four core processors 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:42.720
 intel core i7 47 2 0 already drink with frequency 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:45.780
 3 4 gigahertz and integrated graphics 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.640
 graphics 4600 but it is clearly not for you 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.520
 you need it inside this monster 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:53.790
 worth the latest discrete graphics card 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:56.040
 nvidia geforce gtx 780m without it 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.660
 fast it also accelerates safely 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.000
 using the official utility 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.490
 Yes, you install RAM 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.530
 there is no longer a maximum of 32 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:06.540
 gigabytes with drives all wrong 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:09.210
 just storage built for raid 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.790
 array of two ssd capacity 256 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:14.940
 gigabyte and in addition there is a terabyte 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:17.010
 7200 rpm hard drive for 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.200
 connections with the outside world are provided 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.209
 bluetooth modules 40 wi-fi 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.800
 ethernet of course similar models 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.210
 laptops are hardly suitable for 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.830
 mobile use 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.870
 but the less battery which 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.820
 hidden here allows you to hold out 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.770
 one and a half hours in games or more than three 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.320
 hours in more economical mode 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.300
 he makes a little noise at that 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.340
 some kind of lulling and not cutting and 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:41.040
 low CPU temperature when 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.960
 stress test does not exceed 80 degrees 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.150
 after sitting behind this laptop for several days 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.290
 parting with him is very sad in no 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.230
 single game performance problems 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:49.940
 did not arise felt a big reserve on 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:52.710
 future 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.300
 tests eloquently testify 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.940
 that before us is one of the most 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.350
 productive gaming laptops any 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.520
 modern toy will go on 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:03.870
 maximum settings at 60 70 fps 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:06.979
 imagine what numbers you can get 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:09.450
 when you start the game a year ago 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:11.210
 g750jh is good at almost everything 

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:13.140
 begin to design and finish 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:15.300
 performance true for 

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:16.860
 the opportunity to play anywhere his what 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.770
 please have to lay out a round 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.610
 the amount but if you really thought up to buy 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:24.240
 gaming laptop 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:29.570
 then g750jh perhaps the best option on 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:29.570
 today and that's it and 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:36.440
 And in the first infinity is not the limit of the branch 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.440
 hell
