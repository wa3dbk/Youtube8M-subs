letter<00:04:18.820> quilts<00:04:19.359> but<00:04:19.600> it's<00:04:19.870> been<00:04:20.080> really<00:04:20.260> hard

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
letter quilts but it's been really hard

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.680 
letter quilts but it's been really hard
for<00:04:20.799> me<00:04:20.950> because<00:04:21.160> they're<00:04:21.609> you<00:04:22.360> know<00:04:22.390> they

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
for me because they're you know they

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.530 
for me because they're you know they
have<00:04:23.530> all<00:04:23.650> these<00:04:23.830> complicated<00:04:24.729> techniques<00:04:25.330> so

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540 
have all these complicated techniques so

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.060 
have all these complicated techniques so
I<00:04:25.570> wanted<00:04:25.870> to<00:04:25.960> make<00:04:26.140> something<00:04:26.380> as<00:04:26.620> simple<00:04:26.860> as

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
I wanted to make something as simple as

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:28.470 
I wanted to make something as simple as
I<00:04:27.190> possibly<00:04:27.610> could

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:28.480 
I possibly could

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.660 
I possibly could
and<00:04:28.570> this<00:04:29.050> is<00:04:29.260> about<00:04:29.500> as<00:04:29.680> simple<00:04:29.980> as<00:04:30.190> I<00:04:30.610> think

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:30.670 
and this is about as simple as I think

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:33.600 
and this is about as simple as I think
you<00:04:30.970> can<00:04:31.120> get<00:04:31.390> the<00:04:31.840> alphabet<00:04:32.530> and<00:04:32.800> so<00:04:33.460> it's

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
you can get the alphabet and so it's

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.160 
you can get the alphabet and so it's
just<00:04:33.700> I've<00:04:34.030> taken<00:04:34.270> the<00:04:34.450> letters<00:04:34.750> and<00:04:34.930> paired
