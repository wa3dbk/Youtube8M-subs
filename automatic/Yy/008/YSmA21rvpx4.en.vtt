 already created specifically for selfies but all 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.520
 Contest details at the end of this. 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:40.379
 release and now let's get down to 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:42.450
 our theme our photos in instagram 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.820
 or in VKontakte profile can be safely 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.879
 call our electronic reflection 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.190
 souls from these photos you can learn about 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.100
 we are more than possible to us that 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.309
 I would like to start with the first such phenomenon 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.440
 as replacing your photos with strangers if 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.310
 your interlocutor for example vkontakte not 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.800
 shows you his face then so knows 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:06.980
 and this clinic is clear that we all have 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.090
 there is a complex and but these people believe me 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.370
 they are going wild 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.080
 such people cannot accept themselves and not 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.120
 I know how to be friends with responsibility 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.160
 it always seems to them that in all someone 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.650
 guilty even in those troubles that 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:21.020
 occur in their lives they are just 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.180
 victim of circumstances they are not capable 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.810
 set a high goal 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.790
 simple task they're usually lazy 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.500
 and limp but generally a girl who 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.060
 exposes his photo instead 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.090
 photo for example some 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.460
 supermodels almost always suffer either 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.650
 overweight or just not happy 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.530
 their appearance as for men 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.750
 I can say that 95 percent of all 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.729
 male representatives who 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.640
 instead of your personal photo on 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:52.090
 home page exhibit photos 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.200
 for example of a car , they do this 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.470
 demonstrate their displeasure 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.000
 financial situation if men 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.920
 put on the main page 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.140
 picture of an animal that 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.150
 girls take a look what is this 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.429
 animal and you without my comments 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.720
 it becomes clear what kind of psychological 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:10.880
 childhood trauma man 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.490
 trying to show 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:16.070
 if for example it is a lion then most likely 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:18.920
 it's about what he doesn't feel on 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:21.230
 in fact, in man's strength and energy 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.750
 but the romantic image is often 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.990
 indicative of a difficult situation in 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:29.360
 privacy move on fixing 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:32.030
 interest on certain parts of the body 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.470
 if you notice that your friend or your 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.780
 interlocutor of the social network 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.790
 predominantly positions itself through 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.940
 photos which are mostly 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:43.580
 emphasis is placed on certain parts 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.600
 bodies for example then lips can be eyes 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.360
 chest 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:50.300
 then body-oriented psychology 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.800
 gives you a very interesting tool for 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.290
 more understanding 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.910
 revealing and so if this is nonsense then this 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.010
 usually willing to accept 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.140
 willingness to communicate such people 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.080
 quite sociable and open 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:06.050
 back is always sincerity submission 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.450
 trust too and flexibility obedience 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:10.850
 perception of balance if on 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.030
 photos of the girl highlights the neck 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:15.740
 then look for traits like excitement 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.330
 ability to express passion in 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.050
 desire to obey in love 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.140
 relationship 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:23.120
 hair strength and vitality of the eye 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.960
 ability to listen and understand 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.510
 chest ability and desire to give 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:30.170
 language consent partnerships 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.890
 evidence that man 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.350
 inclined 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.690
 to be led by their physiological 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:37.730
 sex drug addiction needs 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.530
 from food if a person has special attention 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.900
 pays your shoulders you can 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.060
 see by pay who drive women 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.430
 shoulders are either men who are active 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.470
 engaged in fitness and accentuates his 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:51.140
 attention is on the shoulder girdle 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:53.300
 it speaks of the exaggerated requirements for 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.460
 imagine them to others about striving for 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:57.440
 responsibility in readiness for 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:59.360
 difficulties if on this page 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.160
 people that interest you 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.750
 find enough 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.300
 full length photos 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:08.000
 then you can safely assume that this 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:11.590
 man has a good life 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.810
 adapt strongly enough 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:17.600
 how would you say so autonomous in that 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.430
 meaning that if there is any problem then 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.039
 first he will try to solve it 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:25.300
 on their own and believe me he will find 

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:27.080
 these forces in himself despite the fact that he 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.759
 focused enough on 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.740
 emotional contact 

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:32.630
 if you see that man rarely 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.360
 puts photos in full growth 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:38.990
 then most likely it means that he 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:40.250
 not confident enough closed or 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.930
 possibly shy 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.940
 Well, that's a little minimum which 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:46.070
 will surely help you find out about those people 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.710
 with whom you communicate social networks 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:51.320
 a little more than what they are 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:53.210
 try to tell about themselves but in 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.639
