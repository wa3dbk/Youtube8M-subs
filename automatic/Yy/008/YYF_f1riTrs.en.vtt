00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.979 
are potentially dangerous tell us why
right

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
right

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.380 
right
well<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:44.129> Food<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.460> Drug<00:00:44.489> Administration

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
well the Food and Drug Administration

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.180 
well the Food and Drug Administration
does<00:00:45.420> not<00:00:45.780> regulate<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.590> caffeine<00:00:46.950> content

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
does not regulate the caffeine content

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.610 
does not regulate the caffeine content
in<00:00:47.989> energy<00:00:48.989> drinks<00:00:49.260> because<00:00:49.500> they're

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
in energy drinks because they're

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.830 
in energy drinks because they're
considered<00:00:50.039> food<00:00:50.219> supplements<00:00:50.879> so<00:00:51.480> for

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
considered food supplements so for

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.740 
considered food supplements so for
example<00:00:52.350> in<00:00:52.590> our<00:00:53.010> Cola<00:00:53.399> here<00:00:54.030> this<00:00:54.510> is

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
example in our Cola here this is

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.110 
example in our Cola here this is
regulated<00:00:55.410> this<00:00:55.620> has<00:00:55.890> about<00:00:56.129> 35<00:00:56.760> milligrams

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
regulated this has about 35 milligrams

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.569 
regulated this has about 35 milligrams
of<00:00:57.449> caffeine<00:00:57.660> so<00:00:58.500> what<00:00:58.620> is<00:00:58.710> it<00:00:58.859> regulated<00:00:59.460> what

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
of caffeine so what is it regulated what

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:00.950 
of caffeine so what is it regulated what
does<00:00:59.699> that<00:00:59.850> mean<00:01:00.090> that<00:01:00.270> if<00:01:00.359> it<00:01:00.420> exceeded<00:01:00.870> a

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
does that mean that if it exceeded a

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.389 
does that mean that if it exceeded a
certain<00:01:01.260> amount<00:01:01.410> they<00:01:01.680> would<00:01:01.890> be<00:01:02.039> right

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
certain amount they would be right

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.399 
certain amount they would be right
forced<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.910> reduce<00:01:03.120> it<00:01:03.480> right<00:01:03.750> so<00:01:04.019> there's<00:01:04.229> no

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
forced to reduce it right so there's no

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.080 
forced to reduce it right so there's no
more<00:01:04.619> than<00:01:04.739> 70<00:01:05.339> milligrams<00:01:05.580> of<00:01:05.909> caffeine

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
more than 70 milligrams of caffeine

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.170 
more than 70 milligrams of caffeine
that's<00:01:06.510> allowed<00:01:06.810> in<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.170> 12-ounce<00:01:07.760> can<00:01:08.760> of<00:01:08.790> any

35 milligrams and it has the amount of
sugar<00:01:14.100> that's<00:01:14.430> equivalent<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:15.119> two<00:01:15.390> of<00:01:15.659> those

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
this Red Bull right here exactly so this

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.789 
this Red Bull right here exactly so this
is<00:01:24.299> one<00:01:24.450> of<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.659> earliest<00:01:25.020> energy<00:01:25.530> drinks

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
is one of the earliest energy drinks

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.590 
is one of the earliest energy drinks
that<00:01:25.920> was<00:01:26.040> on<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.369> market<00:01:26.759> and<00:01:26.970> again<00:01:27.420> these

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
that was on the market and again these

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.840 
that was on the market and again these
are<00:01:27.659> promoted<00:01:28.409> as<00:01:28.590> sort<00:01:29.070> of<00:01:29.100> enhancing

endurance improving performance

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.060 
endurance improving performance
promoting<00:01:32.970> an<00:01:33.060> active<00:01:33.479> lifestyle<00:01:34.079> and<00:01:34.920> it's

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
promoting an active lifestyle and it's

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.590 
promoting an active lifestyle and it's
mainly<00:01:35.250> because<00:01:35.460> of<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.820> caffeine<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.240> sugar

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
mainly because of the caffeine and sugar

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.749 
mainly because of the caffeine and sugar
content<00:01:37.500> and<00:01:37.619> this<00:01:37.770> is<00:01:37.920> equivalent<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.579> right

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
content and this is equivalent a right

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.620 
content and this is equivalent a right
to<00:01:38.939> react<00:01:39.390> like<00:01:39.600> 3<00:01:39.930> cans<00:01:40.829> of<00:01:40.979> Cola<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.630> 2

to react like 3 cans of Cola and 2

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.810 
to react like 3 cans of Cola and 2
slices<00:01:43.020> of<00:01:43.200> cheesecake<00:01:44.100> so<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.610> sugar

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
slices of cheesecake so the sugar

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.880 
slices of cheesecake so the sugar
content<00:01:45.149> here<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:45.899> then<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.500> caffeine

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
content here and then the caffeine

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.399 
content here and then the caffeine
content<00:01:47.040> of<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.579> colas<00:01:48.000> and<00:01:48.240> then<00:01:48.840> here<00:01:49.200> we

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
content of the colas and then here we

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.090 
content of the colas and then here we
have<00:01:49.439> another<00:01:50.420> popular<00:01:51.420> energy<00:01:52.350> drink<00:01:52.680> which

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
have another popular energy drink which

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.179 
have another popular energy drink which
has<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.610> equivalent<00:01:53.970> of<00:01:54.450> 5<00:01:54.930> cans<00:01:55.320> of<00:01:55.590> Cola<00:01:55.890> and

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
has the equivalent of 5 cans of Cola and

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.060 
has the equivalent of 5 cans of Cola and
3<00:01:56.759> slices<00:01:57.570> of<00:01:57.930> cheesecake<00:01:58.229> so<00:01:58.710> you<00:01:58.770> can<00:01:58.950> make

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
3 slices of cheesecake so you can make

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.649 
3 slices of cheesecake so you can make
your<00:01:59.219> choices<00:01:59.460> and<00:01:59.909> then<00:02:00.119> let's<00:02:00.299> go<00:02:00.420> to<00:02:00.509> this

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
your choices and then let's go to this

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.420 
your choices and then let's go to this
missile<00:02:01.049> a<00:02:01.079> big<00:02:01.380> one<00:02:01.619> right<00:02:01.829> this<00:02:02.070> is<00:02:02.250> the

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
missile a big one right this is the

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.170 
missile a big one right this is the
monster<00:02:02.610> and<00:02:03.180> this<00:02:03.930> has<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.469> equivalent<00:02:05.159> of<00:02:05.340> 7

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
monster and this has the equivalent of 7

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.559 
monster and this has the equivalent of 7
cans<00:02:06.780> of<00:02:07.049> Cola<00:02:07.619> and<00:02:08.009> 4<00:02:08.489> slices<00:02:08.879> of<00:02:09.149> cheesecake

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
cans of Cola and 4 slices of cheesecake

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.190 
cans of Cola and 4 slices of cheesecake
it's<00:02:10.410> really<00:02:10.739> surprising<00:02:11.450> and<00:02:12.450> if<00:02:12.750> you<00:02:12.900> look

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
it's really surprising and if you look

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.650 
it's really surprising and if you look
for

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
for

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.240 
for
example<00:02:14.050> a<00:02:14.080> lot<00:02:14.320> of<00:02:14.470> these<00:02:14.590> don't<00:02:14.830> even<00:02:14.920> tell

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
example a lot of these don't even tell

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.160 
example a lot of these don't even tell
you<00:02:15.370> what<00:02:15.520> the<00:02:15.610> caffeine<00:02:15.940> content<00:02:16.210> is<00:02:16.690> I<00:02:16.900> had

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
you what the caffeine content is I had

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.810 
you what the caffeine content is I had
to<00:02:17.230> call<00:02:17.470> some<00:02:17.740> of<00:02:17.770> the<00:02:17.890> manufacturers<00:02:18.580> and

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
to call some of the manufacturers and

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.240 
to call some of the manufacturers and
look<00:02:19.000> for<00:02:19.360> the<00:02:19.960> amount<00:02:20.320> it<00:02:20.680> won't<00:02:20.860> it<00:02:21.010> doesn't

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
look for the amount it won't it doesn't

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.620 
look for the amount it won't it doesn't
actually<00:02:21.340> say<00:02:21.550> right<00:02:21.850> here<00:02:21.940> no<00:02:22.120> it<00:02:22.300> does<00:02:22.450> not

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
actually say right here no it does not

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.250 
actually say right here no it does not
some<00:02:23.140> of<00:02:23.260> them<00:02:23.410> do<00:02:23.590> but<00:02:23.620> this<00:02:23.950> one<00:02:24.160> doesn't<00:02:24.430> and

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
some of them do but this one doesn't and

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.600 
some of them do but this one doesn't and
the<00:02:26.260> problem<00:02:26.650> of<00:02:26.740> course<00:02:27.010> is<00:02:27.130> there's<00:02:27.340> other

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
the problem of course is there's other

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.580 
the problem of course is there's other
items<00:02:28.090> things<00:02:28.270> like<00:02:28.510> war<00:02:28.750> on<00:02:28.990> uh<00:02:29.020> other

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
items things like war on uh other

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.030 
items things like war on uh other
stimulants<00:02:30.370> that<00:02:30.730> actually<00:02:31.360> arc<00:02:31.540> a<00:02:31.890> form<00:02:32.890> of

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
stimulants that actually arc a form of

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.770 
stimulants that actually arc a form of
caffeine<00:02:33.460> but<00:02:33.880> those<00:02:34.000> are<00:02:34.150> always<00:02:34.300> marketed

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
caffeine but those are always marketed

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.900 
caffeine but those are always marketed
kind<00:02:35.110> of<00:02:35.200> as<00:02:35.290> a<00:02:35.320> natural<00:02:35.860> product<00:02:36.220> to<00:02:36.490> bat<00:02:36.670> your

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
kind of as a natural product to bat your

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.150 
kind of as a natural product to bat your
energy<00:02:37.330> frankly<00:02:37.900> okay<00:02:38.380> they're<00:02:38.680> primarily

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
energy frankly okay they're primarily

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.090 
energy frankly okay they're primarily
through<00:02:40.320> caffeine<00:02:41.320> and<00:02:41.560> then<00:02:41.740> there's<00:02:41.920> other

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
through caffeine and then there's other

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.030 
through caffeine and then there's other
kinds<00:02:42.490> of<00:02:42.520> energy<00:02:42.730> blends<00:02:43.480> ginseng<00:02:44.380> and<00:02:44.770> other

kinds of energy blends ginseng and other
items<00:02:45.600> that<00:02:46.600> are<00:02:47.110> that<00:02:47.410> are<00:02:47.590> felt<00:02:47.950> although

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
items that are that are felt although

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.090 
items that are that are felt although
they're<00:02:48.940> not<00:02:48.970> proven<00:02:49.540> to<00:02:49.720> increase<00:02:50.260> energy

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
they're not proven to increase energy

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.440 
they're not proven to increase energy
let's<00:02:51.400> talk<00:02:51.610> about<00:02:51.760> what<00:02:52.090> some<00:02:52.270> of<00:02:52.300> these

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
let's talk about what some of these

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.450 
let's talk about what some of these
people<00:02:52.660> in<00:02:52.930> the<00:02:53.020> survey<00:02:53.380> talked<00:02:53.740> about<00:02:54.010> weekly

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:54.460 
people in the survey talked about weekly

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.430 
people in the survey talked about weekly
jolt<00:02:54.850> and<00:02:55.060> crash<00:02:55.510> episodes<00:02:56.110> what<00:02:56.320> does<00:02:56.410> that

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
jolt and crash episodes what does that

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.860 
jolt and crash episodes what does that
mean<00:02:56.800> sure<00:02:57.130> well<00:02:57.940> I<00:02:57.970> think<00:02:58.210> throughout<00:02:58.660> the

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
mean sure well I think throughout the

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.390 
mean sure well I think throughout the
day<00:02:59.130> at<00:03:00.130> least<00:03:00.270> one<00:03:01.320> time<00:03:02.320> they<00:03:02.710> will<00:03:02.890> have<00:03:03.100> a

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
day at least one time they will have a

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.570 
day at least one time they will have a
certain<00:03:03.820> amount<00:03:03.910> of<00:03:04.240> drinks<00:03:04.920> el34<00:03:05.920> although

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
certain amount of drinks el34 although

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.310 
certain amount of drinks el34 although
they're<00:03:06.760> only<00:03:06.790> meant<00:03:07.150> to<00:03:07.300> have<00:03:07.540> you<00:03:07.960> know<00:03:08.080> one

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
they're only meant to have you know one

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.590 
they're only meant to have you know one
of<00:03:08.350> these<00:03:08.620> or<00:03:08.920> half<00:03:09.310> a<00:03:09.460> can<00:03:09.700> of<00:03:09.730> these<00:03:10.060> they're

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
of these or half a can of these they're

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.810 
of these or half a can of these they're
drinking<00:03:10.870> 3/4<00:03:11.710> often<00:03:12.190> mixing<00:03:12.520> them<00:03:12.670> with

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
drinking 3/4 often mixing them with

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.810 
drinking 3/4 often mixing them with
alcohol<00:03:13.030> and<00:03:13.630> so<00:03:14.170> of<00:03:14.290> course<00:03:14.500> that's<00:03:14.770> very<00:03:15.160> I

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
alcohol and so of course that's very I

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.090 
alcohol and so of course that's very I
mean<00:03:16.570> it's<00:03:16.660> very<00:03:16.690> dangerous<00:03:17.440> and<00:03:17.650> what

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
mean it's very dangerous and what

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.770 
mean it's very dangerous and what
happens<00:03:18.520> is<00:03:18.790> that<00:03:18.820> especially<00:03:19.420> when<00:03:19.540> you<00:03:19.630> mix

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
happens is that especially when you mix

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.330 
happens is that especially when you mix
them<00:03:19.900> with<00:03:20.080> alcohol<00:03:20.290> a<00:03:20.770> lot<00:03:20.920> of<00:03:21.070> college

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
them with alcohol a lot of college

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.570 
them with alcohol a lot of college
students<00:03:21.670> are<00:03:21.820> doing<00:03:22.060> that<00:03:22.209> is<00:03:23.200> that<00:03:23.830> because

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
students are doing that is that because

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.850 
students are doing that is that because
the<00:03:25.060> alcohol<00:03:25.720> is<00:03:25.870> a<00:03:25.900> depressant<00:03:26.050> and<00:03:26.650> the

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 
the alcohol is a depressant and the

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.530 
the alcohol is a depressant and the
energy<00:03:27.190> drink<00:03:27.430> of<00:03:27.550> the<00:03:27.610> stimulant<00:03:28.120> they're

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
energy drink of the stimulant they're

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.390 
energy drink of the stimulant they're
not<00:03:28.690> aware<00:03:29.080> of<00:03:29.140> how<00:03:29.350> intoxicated<00:03:30.100> they<00:03:30.250> are

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
not aware of how intoxicated they are

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.520 
not aware of how intoxicated they are
and<00:03:30.700> so<00:03:30.910> they'll<00:03:31.150> drink<00:03:31.420> more<00:03:31.690> alcohol<00:03:31.930> and

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
and so they'll drink more alcohol and

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.230 
and so they'll drink more alcohol and
then<00:03:32.860> of<00:03:32.980> course<00:03:33.190> they'll<00:03:33.340> crash<00:03:33.610> when<00:03:33.940> all<00:03:34.090> of

then of course they'll crash when all of

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.540 
then of course they'll crash when all of

that wears off and that do to the body

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.010 
that wears off and that do to the body
is<00:03:36.880> that<00:03:37.060> kind<00:03:37.390> of<00:03:37.450> setting<00:03:37.720> you<00:03:37.810> up<00:03:37.840> for

is that kind of setting you up for

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.800 
is that kind of setting you up for
diabetes<00:03:39.010> later<00:03:39.370> on<00:03:39.580> down<00:03:39.790> the<00:03:39.850> road<00:03:40.120> or<00:03:40.390> well

the<00:03:40.959> sugar<00:03:41.440> content<00:03:41.770> certainly<00:03:42.430> is<00:03:42.640> I<00:03:42.910> mean

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
the sugar content certainly is I mean

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.210 
the sugar content certainly is I mean
it's<00:03:43.150> a<00:03:43.209> and<00:03:43.630> and<00:03:43.810> it<00:03:44.020> leads<00:03:44.380> to<00:03:44.500> obesity<00:03:44.860> which

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
it's a and and it leads to obesity which

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.400 
it's a and and it leads to obesity which
of<00:03:45.340> course<00:03:45.370> leads<00:03:45.730> to<00:03:45.820> diabetes<00:03:46.270> but<00:03:46.989> that<00:03:47.200> up

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
of course leads to diabetes but that up

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.100 
of course leads to diabetes but that up
and<00:03:47.560> down<00:03:47.770> and<00:03:48.040> the<00:03:48.100> sugar<00:03:48.660> content<00:03:49.660> and<00:03:50.050> the

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 
and down and the sugar content and the

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:51.930 
and down and the sugar content and the
caffeine<00:03:50.500> content<00:03:50.709> will<00:03:51.190> increase<00:03:51.760> your

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
caffeine content will increase your

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.670 
caffeine content will increase your
heart<00:03:52.180> rate<00:03:52.300> give<00:03:52.989> you<00:03:53.110> a<00:03:53.170> sense<00:03:53.410> of<00:03:53.530> anxiety

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
heart rate give you a sense of anxiety

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.370 
heart rate give you a sense of anxiety
so<00:03:54.610> it's<00:03:55.060> not<00:03:55.180> necessarily<00:03:55.870> that<00:03:56.050> you<00:03:56.170> feel

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
so it's not necessarily that you feel

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.350 
so it's not necessarily that you feel
calm<00:03:56.709> and<00:03:56.739> you're<00:03:57.160> able<00:03:57.489> to<00:03:57.520> do<00:03:57.760> your<00:03:57.910> work<00:03:57.970> but

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.850 
calm and you're able to do your work but
you're<00:03:58.510> actually<00:03:58.660> more<00:03:58.930> anxious<00:03:59.140> because<00:03:59.739> of

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
you're actually more anxious because of

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.229 
you're actually more anxious because of
the<00:03:59.950> caffeine<00:04:00.340> and<00:04:00.550> let<00:04:00.730> me<00:04:00.820> ask<00:04:00.940> you<00:04:01.120> about

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
the caffeine and let me ask you about

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:03.810 
the caffeine and let me ask you about
people<00:04:01.540> calling<00:04:01.870> poison<00:04:02.470> control<00:04:02.800> can<00:04:03.100> you<00:04:03.130> OD

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
people calling poison control can you OD

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:05.670 
people calling poison control can you OD
on<00:04:03.850> caffeine<00:04:04.360> yes<00:04:04.600> you<00:04:04.870> can<00:04:05.170> and<00:04:05.470> you<00:04:05.650> can

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
on caffeine yes you can and you can

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.060 
on caffeine yes you can and you can
actually<00:04:06.130> even<00:04:06.489> have<00:04:06.880> heart<00:04:07.420> attacks<00:04:08.070> heart

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:09.070 
actually even have heart attacks heart

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:12.840 
actually even have heart attacks heart
rhythm<00:04:09.310> abnormalities<00:04:11.220> and<00:04:12.220> so<00:04:12.489> these<00:04:12.640> are

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850 
rhythm abnormalities and so these are
