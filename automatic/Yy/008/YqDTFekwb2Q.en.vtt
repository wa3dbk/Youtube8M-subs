00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.370
 not 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:14.370
 for them 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.570
 how did they choose 

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:25.990
 you can sweep the whole schedule 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.289
 asked what are goats 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:33.770
 sit write video find 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.870
 of how this is generally done 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.530
 what is school yes that is 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.530
 when we dance 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.770
 we have several types of work with 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.130
 speed up you can't 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.510
 but you money 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.840
 nervous sent 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.300
 average 3 minutes 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:55.270
 either slowly yes that is it plus th 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.010
 either we have a sharp option 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.660
 acceleration 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.699
 so here is a sharp acceleration 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:04.140
 actually there is an expo yes you are for sure 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:04.140
 have seen how it is performed 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:10.220
 imagine how it burns so here 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.830
 what you need to do to perform it 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.510
 so be it 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.360
 if it seems to you that this is just 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:20.200
 such a table is like this 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:23.470
 there is but how it is performed here is 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.230
 such a small nuance means nuance 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.530
 following 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:31.440
 in order to effect well bore well 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.060
 being watched you have to do what 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.180
 must understand that it consists of two 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.930
 Things first this short quick 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.530
 motion 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.240
 that is very fast and very short and 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.350
 when it is fast and short movement 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.720
 you 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.330
 j micro stop and after that 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.520
 slow motion yes that is by itself 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:55.090
 I owe myself if my boyfriend I show him 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:58.540
 Yes, it will look so fast 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.729
 quick stop and next furniture here 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:04.229
 this here then a quick stop you 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:08.459
 micro pause abut and you get 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:11.800
 yes, I'll show you now spoiled which 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.580
 how would we apply in all dances to 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.160
 all this 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.200
 dinner which is done from the head means 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.510
 look you need to learn how to do 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:24.880
 little head movement like this 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:26.980
 for example, that is, see what I do not teach 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.860
 i don't move my head like that 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.860
 or then you write no I go like 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:36.730
 such a small slope here such as 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:41.610
 if anything I twitch in the top 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:44.280
 another status so here 2 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:47.190
 motion component up the first component 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:50.640
 and it is short red short sharp 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.570
 movement on VAT and when he finished the meeting 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.460
 micro pause 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.890
 and after that we move slowly 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:58.290
 that is what we get with us 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:02.460
 There is such a thing there micro 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:06.300
 pause and slow motion is the same in 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:09.450
 the other side is micro pause and goes 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:13.640
 slow movements that is reversible yet 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:16.920
 times attention sharp short movement on 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:20.190
 niche and she makes herself done head 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:23.600
 all body 1 i'm the same way you have you 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:26.790
 fear forward or backward 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:32.030
 short sharp movement 1 stop and 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:32.030
 thereafter smoothly and slow motion 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:39.290
 yes that is you to the paper and what it 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.220
 and you make the topic more cool 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.430
 It looks and 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.950
 but you must not forget that there is 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:48.500
 here it is the separation between fast 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:51.760
 gimme a short movement and slow in 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.760
 the key is and 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:04:02.300
 once apple is about 1 sigma 1 don't swim here 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.459
 this is what is called exploitation 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:07.960
 that is, it is not necessary to do it 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:09.840
 head can also do it 

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:12.440
 or parts of the body for example 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.440
 little faces 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:18.359
 look sharply course mud and smoothly 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:25.220
 sharp 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:25.220
 you here this micro pause and you remove paradise 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:50.660
 do as I do will know 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.660
 immediately 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:55.580
 free 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:58.330
 that's what is called from prostrate need with you 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.330
 was lift and 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:04.720
 but dubstep dance doesn't come out 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.720
