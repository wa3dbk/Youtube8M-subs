00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.540 
I definitely did there are several cubes
I<00:00:18.750> have<00:00:18.930> though<00:00:19.080> that<00:00:19.289> I<00:00:19.439> never<00:00:20.039> really<00:00:20.340> found

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
I have though that I never really found

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.300 
I have though that I never really found
who<00:00:20.820> they<00:00:21.029> belong<00:00:21.390> to<00:00:21.420> but<00:00:21.990> it's<00:00:22.920> not<00:00:23.100> like<00:00:23.189> I

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
who they belong to but it's not like I

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.980 
who they belong to but it's not like I
really<00:00:23.550> use<00:00:23.760> them<00:00:24.000> I<00:00:24.119> didn't<00:00:24.390> still<00:00:24.779> live<00:00:24.900> on

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
really use them I didn't still live on

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.589 
really use them I didn't still live on
purpose<00:00:25.320> of<00:00:25.470> Sonic<00:00:25.800> they<00:00:25.920> have<00:00:26.010> much<00:00:26.220> value

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:26.599 
purpose of Sonic they have much value

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:30.859 
purpose of Sonic they have much value
but<00:00:27.599> yes<00:00:28.439> I<00:00:28.650> tried<00:00:29.160> very<00:00:29.400> hard<00:00:29.460> if<00:00:30.029> you<00:00:30.570> come<00:00:30.840> to

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
but yes I tried very hard if you come to

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.130 
but yes I tried very hard if you come to
Australia<00:00:31.590> where<00:00:31.830> would<00:00:32.009> you<00:00:32.130> go<00:00:32.309> first<00:00:33.140> the

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
Australia where would you go first the

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.760 
Australia where would you go first the
airport<00:00:35.329> and<00:00:36.329> I<00:00:36.450> probably<00:00:36.690> fly<00:00:37.050> there<00:00:37.290> so

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
airport and I probably fly there so

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.090 
airport and I probably fly there so
obviously<00:00:38.780> is<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:40.050> diet<00:00:40.260> megaminx<00:00:40.739> really

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
obviously is the diet megaminx really

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.020 
obviously is the diet megaminx really
worth<00:00:41.250> twenty<00:00:41.670> dollars<00:00:42.030> yes<00:00:42.809> it<00:00:43.230> is<00:00:43.950> by<00:00:44.700> far

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
worth twenty dollars yes it is by far

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.790 
worth twenty dollars yes it is by far
the<00:00:45.090> best<00:00:45.450> megaminx<00:00:46.020> especially<00:00:46.559> if<00:00:46.649> you<00:00:46.710> get

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
the best megaminx especially if you get

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.979 
the best megaminx especially if you get
it<00:00:46.920> with<00:00:47.039> ridges<00:00:47.430> I<00:00:47.640> mean<00:00:48.510> I<00:00:48.629> guess<00:00:48.750> there

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
it with ridges I mean I guess there

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.549 
it with ridges I mean I guess there
could<00:00:49.140> be<00:00:49.200> some<00:00:49.469> competitors<00:00:50.160> but<00:00:50.789> as<00:00:50.969> far<00:00:51.180> as

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
could be some competitors but as far as

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:54.500 
could be some competitors but as far as
megamixes<00:00:52.559> go<00:00:52.739> that<00:00:52.920> I<00:00:53.010> have<00:00:53.160> tried<00:00:53.399> I<00:00:53.670> felt

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
megamixes go that I have tried I felt

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.299 
megamixes go that I have tried I felt
many<00:00:55.079> diane's<00:00:55.620> that<00:00:55.770> are<00:00:56.010> better<00:00:56.160> than

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
many diane's that are better than

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.450 
many diane's that are better than
anything<00:00:57.149> else<00:00:57.300> that<00:00:57.390> I've<00:00:57.600> ever<00:00:57.629> tried<00:00:58.050> so

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
anything else that I've ever tried so

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.160 
anything else that I've ever tried so
it's<00:00:59.460> i'd<00:01:00.059> say<00:01:00.300> it's<00:01:00.480> worth<00:01:00.539> twenty<00:01:01.020> bucks

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
it's i'd say it's worth twenty bucks

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.360 
it's i'd say it's worth twenty bucks
because<00:01:01.440> you<00:01:01.620> could<00:01:01.770> spend<00:01:02.010> more<00:01:02.070> than<00:01:02.309> that

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
because you could spend more than that

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.310 
because you could spend more than that
on<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.640> megaminx<00:01:03.149> it's<00:01:03.420> not<00:01:03.750> really<00:01:03.960> that<00:01:04.080> good

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
on a megaminx it's not really that good

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.149 
on a megaminx it's not really that good
would<00:01:05.250> you<00:01:05.339> ever<00:01:05.519> open<00:01:06.000> up<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.420> Cuban<00:01:06.900> store<00:01:07.200> no

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
would you ever open up a Cuban store no

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.660 
would you ever open up a Cuban store no
because<00:01:08.760> I<00:01:09.030> would<00:01:09.150> take<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.360> lot<00:01:09.600> of<00:01:09.659> time<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.670> I

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
because I would take a lot of time and I

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.250 
because I would take a lot of time and I
don't<00:01:11.880> have<00:01:12.240> that<00:01:12.479> much<00:01:12.659> time<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:13.170> I<00:01:13.200> don't

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
don't have that much time and I don't

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.570 
don't have that much time and I don't
know<00:01:13.530> that<00:01:13.619> I<00:01:13.680> ever<00:01:13.770> will<00:01:14.070> have<00:01:14.280> that<00:01:14.460> much

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
know that I ever will have that much

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.090 
know that I ever will have that much
time<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:15.030> sell<00:01:15.990> cubes<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.650> plus<00:01:16.860> there's

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
time to sell cubes and plus there's

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.370 
time to sell cubes and plus there's
already<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:18.030> best<00:01:18.180> are<00:01:18.570> already<00:01:19.259> in

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
like this all the time could you solve

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.530 
like this all the time could you solve
two<00:01:28.650> cubes<00:01:29.100> in<00:01:29.400> each<00:01:29.700> of<00:01:29.880> your<00:01:30.000> hands<00:01:30.329> at<00:01:30.450> the

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.120 
once rode the bike with no hands and it
took<00:01:38.850> me<00:01:39.060> a<00:01:39.090> while<00:01:39.770> partially<00:01:40.770> because<00:01:40.829> i<00:01:41.009> was

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
took me a while partially because i was

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.940 
took me a while partially because i was
using<00:01:41.280> rube<00:01:41.549> experience<00:01:42.090> because<00:01:42.479> i<00:01:42.799> was<00:01:43.799> back

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
what is the most expensive q but you had

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.249 
what is the most expensive q but you had
stolen<00:01:49.860> off<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:51.119> top<00:01:51.360> of<00:01:51.390> my<00:01:51.570> head<00:01:51.630> all<00:01:52.170> I

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
stolen off the top of my head all I

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.139 
stolen off the top of my head all I
could<00:01:52.320> think<00:01:52.470> of<00:01:52.740> was<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:53.100> lin<00:01:53.310> yun<00:01:53.520> version<00:01:53.909> 1

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
could think of was the lin yun version 1

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.209 
could think of was the lin yun version 1
and<00:01:54.479> it<00:01:54.689> was<00:01:54.810> after<00:01:55.290> they<00:01:55.409> were<00:01:55.470> discontinued

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
and it was after they were discontinued

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
magic should be a WCA event do you think

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.610

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
that are dead what average do you need

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.020

round<00:03:09.440> really<00:03:10.440> just<00:03:10.560> depends<00:03:10.890> on<00:03:11.040> the

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
round really just depends on the

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.100 
round really just depends on the
competition<00:03:11.490> I'd<00:03:12.120> say<00:03:12.330> usually<00:03:12.870> it's<00:03:13.020> like

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
competition I'd say usually it's like

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.560 
competition I'd say usually it's like
eight<00:03:13.860> or<00:03:13.920> nine<00:03:14.220> seconds<00:03:14.910> but<00:03:15.030> I<00:03:15.090> definitely

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
eight or nine seconds but I definitely

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.720 
eight or nine seconds but I definitely
