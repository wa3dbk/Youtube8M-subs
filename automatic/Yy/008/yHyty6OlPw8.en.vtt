00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
created this kind of idea of the

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.850 
created this kind of idea of the

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
it but they really created I made it a

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.380 
it but they really created I made it a
popular<00:01:18.900> amongst<00:01:19.530> us<00:01:19.710> all<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.759> now<00:01:21.000> really

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
popular amongst us all and now really

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.660 
popular amongst us all and now really
what's<00:01:21.570> at<00:01:21.750> risk<00:01:21.780> is<00:01:22.290> as<00:01:22.619> we<00:01:22.830> go<00:01:23.040> forward<00:01:23.430> into

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
what's at risk is as we go forward into

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.520 
what's at risk is as we go forward into
a<00:01:23.850> system<00:01:24.509> where<00:01:24.659> people<00:01:24.689> want<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.259> subscribe
