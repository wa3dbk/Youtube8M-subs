very sturdy I actually put a 65 pound

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.600 
very sturdy I actually put a 65 pound
dumbbell<00:02:49.050> on<00:02:49.080> there<00:02:49.440> knowing<00:02:50.160> that<00:02:50.280> you<00:02:50.520> know

she can get up to about that weight you

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.280 
she can get up to about that weight you
know<00:02:52.470> most<00:02:52.709> likely<00:02:52.800> around<00:02:53.190> 50<00:02:53.610> pounds<00:02:53.910> but

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
definitely could support the the

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.570 
definitely could support the the
dumbbell<00:02:57.269> all<00:02:57.840> and<00:02:58.140> you<00:02:58.560> know<00:02:58.680> concentrated

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
dumbbell all and you know concentrated

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
in one area so I know it's it's sturdy

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.590 
in one area so I know it's it's sturdy
we<00:03:01.380> actually<00:03:01.650> put<00:03:01.830> some<00:03:02.040> we<00:03:02.730> put<00:03:02.940> some<00:03:03.209> bolts

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
we actually put some we put some bolts

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.090 
we actually put some we put some bolts
into<00:03:04.019> the<00:03:04.110> wood<00:03:04.320> because<00:03:04.800> there's<00:03:04.950> actually

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
into the wood because there's actually

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.560 
into the wood because there's actually
wood<00:03:05.519> in<00:03:05.610> the<00:03:05.700> middle<00:03:05.910> of<00:03:06.000> this<00:03:06.150> one<00:03:06.330> for

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
wood in the middle of this one for

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.930 
wood in the middle of this one for
support<00:03:07.019> and<00:03:07.200> then<00:03:07.860> we<00:03:08.040> bolted<00:03:08.519> it<00:03:08.640> on<00:03:08.760> in<00:03:08.880> the

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
support and then we bolted it on in the

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.030 
support and then we bolted it on in the
back<00:03:09.150> so<00:03:09.420> it<00:03:09.570> sits<00:03:09.870> on<00:03:10.019> there<00:03:10.140> very<00:03:10.320> sturdy<00:03:10.650> and

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
back so it sits on there very sturdy and

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.860 
back so it sits on there very sturdy and
again<00:03:11.430> I<00:03:11.670> cover<00:03:12.000> the<00:03:12.180> front<00:03:12.330> with<00:03:12.540> some<00:03:12.720> more
