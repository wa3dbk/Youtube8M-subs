00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:16.700
 Hello everyone, well, that's what the people of 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:19.400
 north face through its already known 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:22.520
 phrase demolition no never state 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:26.029
 exploring presents us then that the 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:28.310
 verbena heyncker high iker that has 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:31.130
 particular this boot this is a drop of 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.200
 Trekking in particular is a boot made 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.600
 to last and in particular it's a drop 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.910
 designed for us to go tremendously 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.649
 like those that is very important but 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:43.100
 how do they get it, let me tell you 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:45.470
 describe so very quickly that it is a 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.090
 boot like this the first thing that 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.910
 you have to observe is that it is a drop 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:52.250
 made mostly in leather made 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.830
 as before, it is definitely a 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:58.790
 leather that is also very nice very 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:01:01.010
 soft and that is largely united or 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:03.440
 is sewn with the system they call 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.750
 Austrian system that's a double one is 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.390
 a new a double sewing system the 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:11.070
 machine sews in a double seam of 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.409
 way that holds very strongly 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.409
 of all those areas that could suffer 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:19.020
 we would say of takeoff breaks of 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.850
 unstitched in short that has more 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.880
 these boots and your observers you will see 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.820
 that the part of the toe has a 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.040
 rubber in wash this rubber allows us 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.990
 put the boot in places where the 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.800
 abrasion in the toe area could 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.990
 be tremendously hard and scratch us 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.350
 break the leather therefore this 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.910
 border more than fine more details the 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.440
 Brooch system that comes from very 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.289
 down in a way that allows us 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.300
 button our boot in this area of 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:51.300
 very precise the toe part 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:53.970
 until half a bridge and then the second 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.420
 area allows us to tighten it in different 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.050
 forces 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.320
 thanks to these staples located in this 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.229
 area 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:05.590
 more particularities these fats are 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:07.840
 made in steel with which that's why it's 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.250
 very difficult to get rusted are very 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.610
 well taken, it is very difficult for 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:16.750
 let's start more details about this boot 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:19.090
 of this boot mounts a very soft eva is 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.610
 a boot with very good cushioning that 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.590
 also on the floor we put a rubber 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.480
 they vibrate like it could not be otherwise 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.970
 it is a rubber vibrates although it will give us the 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:31.930
 adherence that will give us a feeling of 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:33.910
 safety is not a rubber in this case 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.280
 tremendously technical is a boot 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.010
 designed to walk and climb 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.560
 sites that are not extremely 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:45.340
 complicated they also incorporate their 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:47.890
 system already known system cradle about 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.780
 the assembly of these soles that in 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.360
 definitive what it is going to give us is 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:55.360
 stability is a rigid sole to the 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:58.510
 lateral torsion and it also goes 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.790
 and save or rid of those intact so 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.400
 upset about the heel or plant area 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.200
 of the foot where the stones the stands 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.590
 roots can come in already 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:11.410
 cause us some kind of injury in your 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:14.650
 inside here you can not see but today we go 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:17.760
 I see it we have a template that has 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:20.290
 an antibacterial treatment that gives us 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.170
 obviously that's why the boot does not 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:27.390
 the usual bad smell after 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.390
 so many days of using it and finishing 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:34.130
 Rounding all this all this boot in 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.900
 definitive to finish giving you more 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.209
 credibility as it could not be otherwise 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.280
 way we assemble a goretex membrane 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:42.680
 that will give you impermeability 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.870
 very clearly we can put it in the 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:48.130
 water the time each fault up to a height 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:50.959
 approximate here as you can see and 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:53.780
 breathability there a little bit more 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:56.840
 justito of agreement nothing berberÃ¡ boot 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:59.630
 heyncker presented made for those who 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:02.860
 you like it because it's a boot made like 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:06.980
 from before and also with a weight of one kilo 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:09.519
 238 grams the pair at number 42 come 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.519
 see you
