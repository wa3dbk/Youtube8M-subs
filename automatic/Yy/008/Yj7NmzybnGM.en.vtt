00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:15.250
 martÃ­n a presentation of a model 

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:16.599
 personalized with a name that makes for 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:17.949
 the place where we are and that I am going to 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:19.180
 to say what he explains is that he does the 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:22.300
 difference between success and failure 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:24.490
 the goal is not so good the truth is that 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.619
 a direct association is not for a 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.689
 side even the platforms the passion 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:30.999
 of football the passion for driving and 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:32.559
 cars and good and what better to take advantage 

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:35.140
 our sponsorship with the selection 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:37.750
 national football that have facing the 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.270
 global 2014 a product like the goal with 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.520
 this name that the maximum expression 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:46.980
 let's say joy in this sport is 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.980
 opportunity so it's like that 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.219
 Y 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:00.219
 Y 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:09.280
 has basically aesthetic details in 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:12.400
 terms of equipment regarding 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.740
 comfort and safety the vehicle 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.630
 let's say it keeps the 1.6 engine from being 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.610
 a horse comes with the steering wheel 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.080
 multifunction logically with double 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.570
 But sometimes to this equipment 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.520
 normal that comes from the vehicle in this 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.530
 case has some details both 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.869
 exteriors as interiors that give you 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:32.409
 this profile a little more sportier more 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:34.630
 related to sport has some 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:36.520
 15 new alloy wheels 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.460
 inches that give you this look 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.289
 also quite sporty has the 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.630
 repeated mirrors in color 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:45.970
 black the rear spoiler coated in 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.970
 black color also logically in the 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:51.220
 side has a sticker plotter with 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.140
 the name let's say of the model with the 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.910
 word cab with the number 10 in the 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.340
 tailgate also has as a 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:02:00.070
 bump an identification a logo 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.990
 the Argentine flag also very subtle and 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.149
 in what is internal has the interior 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.830
 of roof also coated black has 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:08.220
 an aluminum footstool typical of a 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.020
 sport vehicle 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.780
 remarkable inside is a new 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.390
 Upholstered upholstery that not only grants 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.450
 more more comfort but really from 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.610
 the aesthetic point of view what 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.980
 they differentiate how many units are going to 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.450
 build of this vehicle and when will it 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.990
 be available a sale we have 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.450
 thought to produce 2,000 units is a 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.700
 important number not for goal let's say 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.220
 but it is an important number in 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.020
 terms of limited editions and the 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.270
 vehicle probably starts at 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.250
 invoice from the month of April with 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.510
 which towards the second fortnight of 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.140
 April will be available the 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.140
 official dealers 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:56.340
 I believe that to close this note both 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.409
 we have something to be desired 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.079
 I particularly wish you all that 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:03.150
 with the goal make a goal and that Argentina 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:05.909
 in a lot of goals also not the 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.280
 true that it would be a dream for everyone with 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:12.030
 which hopefully this is the clue 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:14.700
 let's say a good sign for the 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.859
 World Cup in Brazil and that success has 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.540
 had the goal in the Argentine market and 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:20.430
 that continues to be transmitted from 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.169
 some way to our players and 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.349
 have at least a good performance 

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:24.349
 there 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:43.470
 and
