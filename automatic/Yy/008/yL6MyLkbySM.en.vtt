looking for a really beautiful
asscher-cut<00:01:05.159> diamond<00:01:05.580> this<00:01:06.420> is<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.780> level<00:01:07.049> of

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
asscher-cut diamond this is the level of

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.280 
asscher-cut diamond this is the level of
light<00:01:07.350> return<00:01:07.680> you<00:01:07.950> should<00:01:08.130> be<00:01:08.220> aiming<00:01:08.369> for

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 
light return you should be aiming for

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.719 
light return you should be aiming for
now<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.350> interesting<00:01:10.710> difference<00:01:11.340> is<00:01:11.549> in<00:01:11.640> the

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
now the interesting difference is in the

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.750 
now the interesting difference is in the
crown<00:01:12.210> of<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.510> two<00:01:12.689> stones<00:01:13.250> both<00:01:14.250> diamonds

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
crown of the two stones both diamonds

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.700 
crown of the two stones both diamonds
are<00:01:14.850> graded<00:01:15.030> as<00:01:15.299> square<00:01:15.630> emerald<00:01:15.960> cut<00:01:16.140> by<00:01:16.320> dia

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
are graded as square emerald cut by dia

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.399 
are graded as square emerald cut by dia
however<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.820> stone<00:01:18.119> on<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.299> right<00:01:18.600> has<00:01:18.960> four

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
however the stone on the right has four

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.620 
however the stone on the right has four
step<00:01:19.710> cuts<00:01:20.009> in<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.250> crown<00:01:20.520> whereas<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.299> stone

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
step cuts in the crown whereas a stone

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.600 
step cuts in the crown whereas a stone
the<00:01:21.780> left<00:01:22.049> has<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.530> more<00:01:22.650> usual<00:01:22.860> three<00:01:23.369> step

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
the left has the more usual three step

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.480 
the left has the more usual three step
cuts<00:01:24.140> the<00:01:25.140> reason<00:01:25.439> for<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.590> extra<00:01:25.830> step<00:01:26.130> will

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
cuts the reason for the extra step will

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.700 
cuts the reason for the extra step will
most<00:01:26.790> likely<00:01:27.090> be<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.630> retain<00:01:27.960> more<00:01:28.140> carat

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
most likely be to retain more carat

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.789 
most likely be to retain more carat
weight<00:01:28.860> in<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.189> diamond<00:01:30.619> and<00:01:31.619> now<00:01:31.710> we're

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
weight in the diamond and now we're

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.740 
weight in the diamond and now we're
going<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:31.950> look<00:01:32.159> at<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.700> fire<00:01:33.299> of<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.600> two

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
going to look at the fire of the two

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.190 
going to look at the fire of the two
stones<00:01:34.670> what's<00:01:35.670> immediately<00:01:36.000> apparent<00:01:36.689> is<00:01:37.049> a

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
stones what's immediately apparent is a

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.590 
stones what's immediately apparent is a
lack<00:01:37.470> of<00:01:37.500> fire<00:01:37.920> in<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.189> table<00:01:38.759> on<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.180> diamond

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
lack of fire in the table on the diamond

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.050 
lack of fire in the table on the diamond
on<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.810> right<00:01:40.460> this<00:01:41.460> is<00:01:41.520> caused<00:01:41.850> by<00:01:41.939> the

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
on the right this is caused by the

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.060 
on the right this is caused by the
facets<00:01:42.659> not<00:01:42.869> being<00:01:43.110> correctly<00:01:43.500> positioned

facets not being correctly positioned

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.590 
facets not being correctly positioned
and<00:01:44.250> it's<00:01:44.399> causing<00:01:44.909> light<00:01:45.060> leakage<00:01:45.420> in<00:01:45.570> the

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
and it's causing light leakage in the

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.960 
and it's causing light leakage in the
stone<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.079> that's<00:01:46.229> affecting<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:47.399> fire<00:01:47.759> in

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
stone and that's affecting the fire in

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.340 
stone and that's affecting the fire in
the<00:01:48.060> diamond

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
the diamond

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.620 
the diamond

in comparison the Darmon on the left
looks<00:01:52.229> absolutely<00:01:52.979> beautiful

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:54.650 
looks absolutely beautiful

interesting because you might expect the

more<00:02:22.230> fire<00:02:22.620> from<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:23.010> crown<00:02:23.370> but<00:02:24.150> as<00:02:24.270> you<00:02:24.360> can

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
more fire from the crown but as you can

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.979 
more fire from the crown but as you can
see<00:02:24.510> that's<00:02:25.350> not<00:02:25.530> the<00:02:25.620> case<00:02:26.480> this<00:02:27.480> is<00:02:27.630> why<00:02:27.750> when
