hi<00:00:05.490> it's<00:00:05.670> mr.<00:00:05.940> Andersen<00:00:06.330> and<00:00:06.420> in<00:00:06.509> this<00:00:06.569> podcast

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
hi it's mr. Andersen and in this podcast

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.040 
hi it's mr. Andersen and in this podcast
I'm<00:00:07.290> going<00:00:07.350> to<00:00:07.470> talk<00:00:07.529> about<00:00:07.890> X<00:00:08.130> inactivation

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:09.050 
I'm going to talk about X inactivation

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:11.780 
I'm going to talk about X inactivation
sometimes<00:00:10.050> we<00:00:10.170> call<00:00:10.320> this<00:00:10.500> lion<00:00:10.920> ization<00:00:11.370> and

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
sometimes we call this lion ization and

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.209 
sometimes we call this lion ization and
that's<00:00:11.940> kind<00:00:12.690> of<00:00:12.750> giving<00:00:12.960> credit<00:00:13.139> to<00:00:13.320> person

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
that's kind of giving credit to person

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:15.770 
that's kind of giving credit to person
who<00:00:14.309> discovered<00:00:14.820> most<00:00:15.030> of<00:00:15.210> this<00:00:15.360> which<00:00:15.599> is

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
who discovered most of this which is

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.140 
who discovered most of this which is
Mary<00:00:16.080> lion<00:00:16.650> but<00:00:17.460> I<00:00:17.490> want<00:00:17.699> to<00:00:17.760> start<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:18.000> whole

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
Mary lion but I want to start the whole

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.580 
Mary lion but I want to start the whole
thing<00:00:18.180> by<00:00:18.539> talking<00:00:18.869> about<00:00:19.050> calico<00:00:19.560> and

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
thing by talking about calico and

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.460 
thing by talking about calico and
tortoiseshell<00:00:20.430> cats<00:00:20.880> calico<00:00:21.840> cats<00:00:22.050> like<00:00:22.289> this

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
tortoiseshell cats calico cats like this

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.380 
tortoiseshell cats calico cats like this
one<00:00:22.680> and<00:00:22.949> tortoiseshell<00:00:23.430> cats<00:00:23.699> like<00:00:23.939> this<00:00:24.180> are

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
one and tortoiseshell cats like this are

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.070 
one and tortoiseshell cats like this are
almost<00:00:25.050> always<00:00:25.580> female<00:00:26.689> which<00:00:27.689> puzzled

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
almost always female which puzzled

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.599 
almost always female which puzzled
scientists<00:00:28.500> for<00:00:28.680> a<00:00:28.740> long<00:00:28.920> time<00:00:29.189> until<00:00:29.400> we

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
scientists for a long time until we

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.160 
scientists for a long time until we
finally<00:00:29.939> figured<00:00:30.090> out<00:00:30.300> how<00:00:30.480> that<00:00:30.510> works<00:00:30.929> and

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
finally figured out how that works and

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.139 
finally figured out how that works and
it<00:00:31.289> puzzled<00:00:31.650> Mary<00:00:31.890> lion<00:00:32.219> as<00:00:32.520> well<00:00:32.669> here<00:00:32.969> she<00:00:33.000> is

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
it puzzled Mary lion as well here she is

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.270 
it puzzled Mary lion as well here she is
she<00:00:33.450> worked<00:00:33.600> at<00:00:33.750> Cambridge<00:00:34.230> but<00:00:34.829> basically

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
she worked at Cambridge but basically

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.410 
she worked at Cambridge but basically
what<00:00:35.399> she<00:00:35.550> found<00:00:35.730> is<00:00:35.940> that<00:00:36.090> when<00:00:36.210> she<00:00:36.360> was

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
what she found is that when she was

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.959 
what she found is that when she was
working<00:00:36.809> with<00:00:36.840> lab<00:00:37.200> rats<00:00:37.520> some<00:00:38.520> of<00:00:38.640> them<00:00:38.760> would

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
working with lab rats some of them would

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.060 
working with lab rats some of them would
be<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.450> white<00:00:39.780> some<00:00:40.170> would<00:00:40.290> be<00:00:40.410> a<00:00:40.440> grey<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:40.920> some

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
be a white some would be a grey and some

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.530 
be a white some would be a grey and some
would<00:00:41.160> be<00:00:41.309> kind<00:00:41.579> of<00:00:41.610> a<00:00:41.700> tortoiseshell<00:00:42.149> between

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
would be kind of a tortoiseshell between

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.869 
would be kind of a tortoiseshell between
the<00:00:42.629> two<00:00:42.809> but<00:00:43.050> she<00:00:43.559> found<00:00:43.829> is<00:00:44.129> that<00:00:44.280> most<00:00:44.640> of

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
the two but she found is that most of

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.510 
the two but she found is that most of
those<00:00:45.000> tortoiseshell<00:00:45.510> mice<00:00:45.780> were<00:00:46.050> on<00:00:46.520> females

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
those tortoiseshell mice were on females

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.920 
those tortoiseshell mice were on females
and<00:00:47.789> so<00:00:47.879> most<00:00:48.090> of<00:00:48.210> them<00:00:48.300> had<00:00:48.450> two<00:00:48.629> x

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
and so most of them had two x

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.810 
and so most of them had two x
chromosomes<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.829> she<00:00:49.920> was<00:00:50.070> also<00:00:50.250> working<00:00:50.550> on

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
chromosomes and she was also working on

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.090 
chromosomes and she was also working on
chromosomes<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.719> why<00:00:51.840> some<00:00:52.500> disorders<00:00:52.980> are

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
chromosomes and why some disorders are

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.619 
chromosomes and why some disorders are
more<00:00:53.250> prevalent<00:00:53.520> in<00:00:53.850> females<00:00:54.270> than<00:00:54.510> they<00:00:54.600> are

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
more prevalent in females than they are

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.049 
more prevalent in females than they are
in<00:00:54.899> males<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.469> so<00:00:55.559> we<00:00:55.800> know<00:00:55.949> that<00:00:56.160> sex<00:00:56.489> linkage

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
in males and so we know that sex linkage

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.299 
in males and so we know that sex linkage
but<00:00:57.809> basically<00:00:58.350> what<00:00:58.500> she<00:00:58.649> found<00:00:58.890> is<00:00:59.160> that

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
but basically what she found is that

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.950 
but basically what she found is that
when<00:00:59.430> you<00:00:59.550> look<00:00:59.789> into<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.210> nucleus<00:01:00.660> of<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:00.930> cell

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
when you look into the nucleus of a cell

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.850 
when you look into the nucleus of a cell
so<00:01:01.410> this<00:01:01.530> is<00:01:01.710> in<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.920> nucleus<00:01:02.430> in<00:01:02.629> every<00:01:03.860> cell

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
so this is in the nucleus in every cell

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.090 
so this is in the nucleus in every cell
of<00:01:05.129> every<00:01:06.000> female<00:01:06.510> one<00:01:07.350> of<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.560> X<00:01:07.710> chromosomes

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
of every female one of the X chromosomes

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.370 
of every female one of the X chromosomes
will<00:01:08.520> be<00:01:08.670> active<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:09.689> so<00:01:09.869> it<00:01:09.960> works<00:01:10.140> perfectly

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
will be active and so it works perfectly

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.660 
will be active and so it works perfectly
but<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.040> other<00:01:11.159> one<00:01:11.310> is<00:01:11.400> going<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.549> be

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
but the other one is going to be

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.090 
but the other one is going to be
inactive<00:01:12.240> it's<00:01:12.390> going<00:01:12.540> to<00:01:12.600> fall<00:01:12.869> apart<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:13.590> so

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
inactive it's going to fall apart and so

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.730 
inactive it's going to fall apart and so
if<00:01:14.189> you're<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.369> female<00:01:14.670> in<00:01:15.240> all<00:01:15.960> of<00:01:16.320> your<00:01:16.439> cells

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
if you're a female in all of your cells

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.460 
if you're a female in all of your cells
only<00:01:17.250> one<00:01:17.820> of<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.060> X<00:01:18.210> chromosomes<00:01:18.780> is<00:01:19.049> active

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
only one of the X chromosomes is active

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.830 
only one of the X chromosomes is active
and<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.680> other<00:01:19.830> one<00:01:19.979> is<00:01:20.100> inactive<00:01:20.640> it's<00:01:21.540> okay

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
and the other one is inactive it's okay

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.380 
and the other one is inactive it's okay
though<00:01:22.049> because<00:01:22.590> you're<00:01:22.770> fine<00:01:22.979> on<00:01:23.790> guys<00:01:24.150> side

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
though because you're fine on guys side

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.450 
though because you're fine on guys side
same<00:01:24.780> thing<00:01:24.810> we<00:01:25.200> only<00:01:25.320> have<00:01:25.590> one<00:01:25.860> X<00:01:26.070> chromosome

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
same thing we only have one X chromosome

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.039 
same thing we only have one X chromosome
and<00:01:26.610> so<00:01:26.759> sex<00:01:27.060> chromosomes<00:01:27.570> like<00:01:27.720> this<00:01:27.900> are

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
and so sex chromosomes like this are

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.810 
and so sex chromosomes like this are
kind<00:01:28.229> of<00:01:28.290> designed<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:28.860> just<00:01:29.009> work<00:01:29.310> on<00:01:29.490> their

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
kind of designed to just work on their

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.819 
kind of designed to just work on their
own<00:01:29.850> when<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:30.780> breaks<00:01:31.020> apart<00:01:31.380> like<00:01:31.500> that<00:01:31.560> we

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
own when it breaks apart like that we

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.890 
own when it breaks apart like that we
call<00:01:32.009> that<00:01:32.159> a<00:01:32.220> bar<00:01:32.700> body<00:01:33.119> or<00:01:33.450> that<00:01:33.630> X

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
call that a bar body or that X

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.800 
call that a bar body or that X
chromosome<00:01:34.409> is<00:01:34.530> now<00:01:34.880> inactivated<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:35.970> so<00:01:36.570> let

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
chromosome is now inactivated and so let

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:37.789 
chromosome is now inactivated and so let
me<00:01:36.869> kind<00:01:37.049> of<00:01:37.110> talk<00:01:37.290> you<00:01:37.320> through<00:01:37.530> how<00:01:37.619> this

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
me kind of talk you through how this

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.530 
me kind of talk you through how this
works<00:01:38.070> well<00:01:38.310> basically<00:01:38.490> when<00:01:38.939> you<00:01:39.060> are<00:01:39.090> born

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
works well basically when you are born

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.480 
works well basically when you are born
well<00:01:40.409> before<00:01:40.770> you're<00:01:40.890> born<00:01:41.100> when<00:01:41.340> you're<00:01:41.460> a

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
well before you're born when you're a

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.639 
well before you're born when you're a
zygote<00:01:42.060> that<00:01:42.299> zygote<00:01:42.869> if<00:01:43.170> you're<00:01:43.409> a<00:01:43.439> female

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
zygote that zygote if you're a female

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.520 
zygote that zygote if you're a female
will<00:01:44.009> have<00:01:44.159> two<00:01:44.399> X<00:01:44.700> chromosomes<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.689> those<00:01:46.350> X

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
will have two X chromosomes and those X

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.410 
will have two X chromosomes and those X
chromosomes<00:01:47.070> will<00:01:47.369> be<00:01:47.490> copied<00:01:47.939> when<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.210> cell

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
chromosomes will be copied when the cell

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.060 
chromosomes will be copied when the cell
goes<00:01:48.630> through<00:01:48.689> mitosis<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:49.590> so<00:01:49.710> we<00:01:49.799> go<00:01:49.920> from

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
goes through mitosis and so we go from

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.639 
goes through mitosis and so we go from
having<00:01:50.430> one<00:01:50.610> cell<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:51.060> two<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:51.630> then<00:01:52.229> to<00:01:52.350> four

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
having one cell to two and then to four

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.620 
having one cell to two and then to four
and<00:01:53.070> then<00:01:53.430> to<00:01:53.549> eight<00:01:53.820> and<00:01:54.090> I<00:01:54.149> could<00:01:54.299> keep<00:01:54.420> doing

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
and then to eight and I could keep doing

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.090 
and then to eight and I could keep doing
this<00:01:54.869> but<00:01:55.110> basically<00:01:55.259> when<00:01:55.740> you<00:01:55.799> get<00:01:55.890> a<00:01:55.950> big

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
this but basically when you get a big

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.709 
this but basically when you get a big
ball<00:01:56.310> of<00:01:56.490> cells<00:01:56.700> like<00:01:56.850> this<00:01:57.149> these<00:01:57.360> are<00:01:57.420> called

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
ball of cells like this these are called

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.389 
ball of cells like this these are called
stem<00:01:58.079> cells<00:01:58.380> they're<00:01:58.619> cells<00:01:58.890> it<00:01:59.040> can<00:01:59.159> become

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
stem cells they're cells it can become

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.910 
stem cells they're cells it can become
any<00:01:59.640> other<00:01:59.759> cell<00:01:59.969> but<00:02:00.930> right<00:02:01.200> around<00:02:01.560> this

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
any other cell but right around this

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.380 
any other cell but right around this
time<00:02:01.979> when<00:02:02.520> you<00:02:02.640> start<00:02:02.880> to<00:02:02.939> get<00:02:03.030> this<00:02:03.149> big

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
time when you start to get this big

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.600 
time when you start to get this big
blastula<00:02:03.869> there's<00:02:04.290> basically<00:02:04.770> a<00:02:04.920> flip<00:02:05.430> of<00:02:05.549> the

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
blastula there's basically a flip of the

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.119 
blastula there's basically a flip of the
coin<00:02:05.640> that<00:02:06.030> goes<00:02:06.210> on<00:02:06.360> in<00:02:06.540> each<00:02:06.810> of<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.200> cells

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
coin that goes on in each of the cells

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.190 
coin that goes on in each of the cells
and<00:02:08.459> so<00:02:08.670> one<00:02:08.970> of<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.209> X<00:02:09.360> chromosomes<00:02:09.929> will

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
and so one of the X chromosomes will

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.300 
and so one of the X chromosomes will
simply<00:02:10.709> wad<00:02:11.340> up<00:02:11.640> and<00:02:11.879> become

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
simply wad up and become

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.120 
simply wad up and become
inactivated<00:02:13.300> so<00:02:13.840> this<00:02:14.080> one<00:02:14.260> might<00:02:14.470> wad<00:02:14.709> up<00:02:14.950> and

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
inactivated so this one might wad up and

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:16.770 
inactivated so this one might wad up and
it's<00:02:15.220> a<00:02:15.280> 50/50<00:02:15.850> chance<00:02:15.880> which<00:02:16.390> are<00:02:16.540> the<00:02:16.630> ones

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
it's a 50/50 chance which are the ones

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.000 
it's a 50/50 chance which are the ones
are<00:02:16.900> going<00:02:17.020> to<00:02:17.080> wad<00:02:17.290> up<00:02:17.500> so<00:02:17.650> it<00:02:17.740> might<00:02:17.830> be<00:02:17.890> that

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
are going to wad up so it might be that

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.610 
are going to wad up so it might be that
one<00:02:18.490> it<00:02:18.790> might<00:02:18.910> be<00:02:19.060> that<00:02:19.240> one<00:02:19.569> so<00:02:20.200> it's<00:02:20.350> totally

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
one it might be that one so it's totally

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.490 
one it might be that one so it's totally
random<00:02:21.250> which<00:02:21.640> one's<00:02:21.880> going<00:02:22.150> to<00:02:22.209> wad<00:02:22.959> up<00:02:23.290> in

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
random which one's going to wad up in

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.330 
random which one's going to wad up in
each<00:02:23.950> of<00:02:24.160> these<00:02:25.080> now<00:02:26.080> the<00:02:26.680> one<00:02:26.890> that's<00:02:27.100> left

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
each of these now the one that's left

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.070 
each of these now the one that's left
it's<00:02:27.819> going<00:02:27.910> to<00:02:28.090> be<00:02:28.180> able<00:02:28.270> to<00:02:28.420> express<00:02:28.750> all<00:02:29.050> of

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
it's going to be able to express all of

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.720 
it's going to be able to express all of
the<00:02:29.200> genes<00:02:29.290> that<00:02:29.650> are<00:02:29.770> found<00:02:29.860> on<00:02:30.280> that<00:02:30.310> and

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
the genes that are found on that and

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.820 
the genes that are found on that and
what's<00:02:30.940> interesting<00:02:31.270> is<00:02:31.690> that<00:02:31.780> all<00:02:32.140> the<00:02:32.530> cells

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
what's interesting is that all the cells

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.090 
what's interesting is that all the cells
that<00:02:33.010> come<00:02:33.459> from<00:02:33.700> this<00:02:33.910> cell<00:02:34.920> likewise<00:02:35.920> are

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
that come from this cell likewise are

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.030 
that come from this cell likewise are
going<00:02:36.220> to<00:02:36.310> have<00:02:36.459> one<00:02:36.790> x<00:02:37.030> chromosome<00:02:37.390> that's

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
going to have one x chromosome that's

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.320 
going to have one x chromosome that's
inactivated<00:02:39.040> and<00:02:39.160> then<00:02:39.550> one<00:02:39.790> x<00:02:40.000> chromosome

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
inactivated and then one x chromosome

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.780 
inactivated and then one x chromosome
that's<00:02:40.660> activated<00:02:41.530> and<00:02:41.739> so<00:02:42.190> basically<00:02:42.520> this

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
that's activated and so basically this

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.880 
that's activated and so basically this
stem<00:02:43.090> cell<00:02:43.330> once<00:02:43.600> that<00:02:43.870> flip<00:02:44.320> of<00:02:44.440> the<00:02:44.500> coin<00:02:44.530> has

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
stem cell once that flip of the coin has

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.250 
stem cell once that flip of the coin has
occurred<00:02:45.370> it's<00:02:46.000> for<00:02:46.510> the<00:02:46.570> rest<00:02:46.780> of<00:02:46.930> the<00:02:47.050> life

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
occurred it's for the rest of the life

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.140 
occurred it's for the rest of the life
of<00:02:47.470> the<00:02:47.590> cell<00:02:47.800> and<00:02:48.010> all<00:02:48.250> the<00:02:48.489> cells<00:02:48.700> that<00:02:48.880> come

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
of the cell and all the cells that come

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.300 
of the cell and all the cells that come
from<00:02:49.390> that<00:02:49.480> and<00:02:49.930> so<00:02:50.380> that<00:02:50.530> tells<00:02:50.769> us<00:02:50.920> why<00:02:51.280> a

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
from that and so that tells us why a

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.160 
from that and so that tells us why a
calico<00:02:51.910> cat<00:02:52.090> is<00:02:52.239> female<00:02:52.540> let<00:02:52.750> me<00:02:52.840> talk<00:02:53.019> to<00:02:53.110> you

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
calico cat is female let me talk to you

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.199 
calico cat is female let me talk to you
through<00:02:53.380> that<00:02:53.500> so<00:02:53.769> if<00:02:53.860> you're<00:02:53.980> a<00:02:54.010> male<00:02:54.310> cat<00:02:54.700> you

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
through that so if you're a male cat you

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.570 
through that so if you're a male cat you
could<00:02:55.360> basically<00:02:55.540> be<00:02:55.870> an<00:02:56.080> orange<00:02:56.500> cat<00:02:56.800> or<00:02:57.069> a

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
could basically be an orange cat or a

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.759 
could basically be an orange cat or a
black<00:02:57.819> cat<00:02:58.120> or<00:02:58.390> you<00:02:58.780> could<00:02:58.900> be<00:02:58.989> a<00:02:59.019> white<00:02:59.260> cat<00:02:59.500> if

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
black cat or you could be a white cat if

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:01.410 
black cat or you could be a white cat if
you're<00:02:59.920> lacking<00:03:00.250> the<00:03:00.640> pigment<00:03:00.970> on<00:03:01.060> that<00:03:01.239> on

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
you're lacking the pigment on that on

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:02.970 
you're lacking the pigment on that on
the<00:03:01.540> hair<00:03:01.780> and<00:03:01.989> so<00:03:02.200> let's<00:03:02.410> look<00:03:02.530> at<00:03:02.680> this

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
the hair and so let's look at this

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.680 
the hair and so let's look at this
so<00:03:03.310> it's<00:03:03.430> found<00:03:03.640> on<00:03:03.730> the<00:03:03.850> X<00:03:04.000> chromosome<00:03:04.360> if<00:03:04.600> you

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
so it's found on the X chromosome if you

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.449 
so it's found on the X chromosome if you
have<00:03:04.780> the<00:03:04.900> black<00:03:05.140> gene<00:03:05.470> on<00:03:05.650> your<00:03:05.800> X<00:03:05.950> chromosome

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
have the black gene on your X chromosome

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:08.040 
have the black gene on your X chromosome
since<00:03:06.760> you<00:03:06.850> only<00:03:06.970> have<00:03:07.180> one<00:03:07.450> x<00:03:07.690> chromosome

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
since you only have one x chromosome

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:09.900 
since you only have one x chromosome
then<00:03:08.680> you're<00:03:08.830> going<00:03:08.920> to<00:03:08.980> be<00:03:09.100> a<00:03:09.130> black<00:03:09.370> cat<00:03:09.670> if

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
then you're going to be a black cat if

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.540 
then you're going to be a black cat if
you<00:03:10.480> have<00:03:10.780> the<00:03:11.080> orange<00:03:11.620> gene<00:03:11.980> on<00:03:12.280> your<00:03:12.400> X

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
you have the orange gene on your X

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.309 
you have the orange gene on your X
chromosome<00:03:13.090> then<00:03:13.390> you're<00:03:13.600> going<00:03:13.750> to<00:03:13.870> be<00:03:14.080> an

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 
chromosome then you're going to be an

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:15.660 
chromosome then you're going to be an
orange<00:03:14.890> cat<00:03:15.100> and<00:03:15.370> it's<00:03:15.489> pretty

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
orange cat and it's pretty

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.520 
orange cat and it's pretty
straightforward<00:03:16.000> because<00:03:16.540> in<00:03:16.900> every<00:03:17.260> cell

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
straightforward because in every cell

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:18.930 
straightforward because in every cell
there's<00:03:17.829> going<00:03:17.950> to<00:03:18.010> be<00:03:18.100> an<00:03:18.190> X<00:03:18.340> chromosome<00:03:18.700> with

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
there's going to be an X chromosome with

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.520 
there's going to be an X chromosome with
that<00:03:19.060> gene<00:03:19.299> it's<00:03:19.540> making<00:03:19.840> that<00:03:19.959> pigment<00:03:20.380> color

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
that gene it's making that pigment color

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.710 
that gene it's making that pigment color
now<00:03:21.280> let's<00:03:21.459> look<00:03:21.549> at<00:03:21.640> the<00:03:21.730> female<00:03:22.180> side<00:03:22.420> so<00:03:22.660> if

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
now let's look at the female side so if

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.360 
now let's look at the female side so if
you're<00:03:22.840> a<00:03:22.870> female<00:03:23.350> cat<00:03:23.590> you<00:03:23.829> have<00:03:23.920> two<00:03:24.130> X

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
you're a female cat you have two X

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.390 
you're a female cat you have two X
chromosomes<00:03:24.870> if<00:03:25.870> both<00:03:26.560> of<00:03:26.590> them<00:03:26.950> are<00:03:27.160> black

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
chromosomes if both of them are black

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.520 
chromosomes if both of them are black
gene<00:03:27.760> then<00:03:28.060> you're<00:03:28.209> going<00:03:28.299> to<00:03:28.360> have<00:03:28.570> a<00:03:28.600> black

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
gene then you're going to have a black

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.590 
gene then you're going to have a black
cat<00:03:29.920> now<00:03:30.220> what<00:03:30.370> you<00:03:30.459> should<00:03:30.489> know<00:03:30.850> is<00:03:30.880> that<00:03:31.150> in

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
cat now what you should know is that in

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.259 
cat now what you should know is that in
each<00:03:32.079> of<00:03:32.290> the<00:03:32.410> cells<00:03:32.739> of<00:03:33.190> this<00:03:33.579> cat<00:03:33.880> that

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
each of the cells of this cat that

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:36.390 
each of the cells of this cat that
produces<00:03:34.840> this<00:03:35.049> black<00:03:35.260> pigment<00:03:35.799> on<00:03:35.950> its<00:03:36.160> skin

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
produces this black pigment on its skin

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.220 
produces this black pigment on its skin
it's<00:03:37.150> going<00:03:37.329> to<00:03:37.390> be<00:03:37.450> a<00:03:37.480> different<00:03:37.959> X

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
it's going to be a different X

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.140 
it's going to be a different X
chromosome<00:03:38.890> that's<00:03:39.100> working<00:03:39.519> in<00:03:39.700> each<00:03:39.970> of

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
chromosome that's working in each of

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:41.910 
chromosome that's working in each of
those<00:03:40.239> so<00:03:40.480> that<00:03:40.630> flip<00:03:41.049> of<00:03:41.170> the<00:03:41.230> coin<00:03:41.260> has

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
those so that flip of the coin has

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:42.569 
those so that flip of the coin has
occurred

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:42.579 
occurred

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:45.210 
occurred
likewise<00:03:43.359> if<00:03:43.510> we've<00:03:43.660> got<00:03:43.870> you<00:03:44.380> know<00:03:44.530> an<00:03:44.739> orange

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
likewise if we've got you know an orange

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.160 
likewise if we've got you know an orange
gene<00:03:45.489> in<00:03:45.670> each<00:03:45.790> of<00:03:45.970> those<00:03:46.060> X<00:03:46.329> chromosomes<00:03:46.870> same

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
gene in each of those X chromosomes same

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.340 
gene in each of those X chromosomes same
thing<00:03:47.470> it's<00:03:47.680> going<00:03:47.829> to<00:03:47.920> be<00:03:48.480> orange<00:03:49.480> but<00:03:49.720> what's

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350 
thing it's going to be orange but what's

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.440 
thing it's going to be orange but what's
weird<00:03:50.680> is<00:03:51.010> if<00:03:51.160> you're<00:03:51.280> heterozygous<00:03:51.910> for<00:03:52.329> it

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
weird is if you're heterozygous for it

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.240 
weird is if you're heterozygous for it
and<00:03:52.600> so<00:03:52.720> if<00:03:52.810> you're<00:03:52.959> this<00:03:53.290> if<00:03:53.650> you're<00:03:53.799> a<00:03:53.859> female

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
and so if you're this if you're a female

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.630 
and so if you're this if you're a female
who<00:03:55.090> is<00:03:55.359> has<00:03:56.140> one<00:03:56.350> x<00:03:56.530> chromosome<00:03:56.859> with<00:03:57.160> a<00:03:57.190> black

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 
who is has one x chromosome with a black

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.030 
who is has one x chromosome with a black
gene<00:03:57.910> and<00:03:58.150> one<00:03:58.329> with<00:03:58.600> a<00:03:58.840> orange<00:03:59.320> gene<00:03:59.590> well<00:03:59.890> how

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
gene and one with a orange gene well how

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.830 
gene and one with a orange gene well how
could<00:04:00.190> this<00:04:00.310> occur<00:04:00.640> well<00:04:01.180> simple<00:04:01.570> let's<00:04:01.780> say

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
could this occur well simple let's say

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.840 
could this occur well simple let's say
we<00:04:01.989> match<00:04:02.200> this<00:04:02.560> a<00:04:02.620> black<00:04:03.070> cat<00:04:03.310> with<00:04:03.519> an<00:04:03.640> orange

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:03.850 
we match this a black cat with an orange

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.120 
we match this a black cat with an orange
cat<00:04:04.060> then<00:04:04.660> all<00:04:04.959> of<00:04:04.989> the<00:04:05.350> offspring<00:04:05.680> are<00:04:05.920> going

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
cat then all of the offspring are going

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:07.949 
cat then all of the offspring are going
to<00:04:06.220> be<00:04:06.340> like<00:04:06.519> this<00:04:06.730> and<00:04:07.000> so<00:04:07.510> what<00:04:07.690> is<00:04:07.780> it<00:04:07.870> going

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
to be like this and so what is it going

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:10.710 
to be like this and so what is it going
to<00:04:08.019> look<00:04:08.320> like<00:04:08.430> well<00:04:09.430> this<00:04:09.940> is<00:04:10.120> not<00:04:10.239> a<00:04:10.299> great

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
to look like well this is not a great

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.289 
to look like well this is not a great
animation<00:04:11.140> or<00:04:11.530> a<00:04:11.650> great<00:04:11.859> picture<00:04:12.220> but

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:12.299 
animation or a great picture but

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:14.819 
animation or a great picture but
basically<00:04:13.299> what<00:04:13.540> you'll<00:04:13.660> have<00:04:13.780> is<00:04:13.840> splotches

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:14.829 
basically what you'll have is splotches

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:17.580 
basically what you'll have is splotches
of<00:04:14.859> black<00:04:15.459> and<00:04:15.820> splotches<00:04:16.479> of<00:04:16.510> orange<00:04:16.959> and<00:04:17.140> so

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
of black and splotches of orange and so

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.050 
of black and splotches of orange and so
let's<00:04:17.769> look<00:04:17.979> at<00:04:18.070> this<00:04:18.220> black<00:04:18.489> right<00:04:18.789> here

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
let's look at this black right here

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.000 
let's look at this black right here
basically<00:04:19.299> what<00:04:19.690> happened<00:04:20.140> is<00:04:20.289> at<00:04:20.560> the<00:04:20.709> stem

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
basically what happened is at the stem

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.630 
basically what happened is at the stem
cell<00:04:21.310> stage<00:04:21.960> the<00:04:22.960> orange<00:04:23.380> gene<00:04:23.740> basically

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:24.640 
cell stage the orange gene basically

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:25.710 
cell stage the orange gene basically
this

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
this

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.050 
this
Jeanne<00:04:26.080> became<00:04:26.740> a<00:04:26.890> bar<00:04:27.160> body<00:04:27.430> so<00:04:27.730> it<00:04:27.790> became

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
Jeanne became a bar body so it became

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.780 
Jeanne became a bar body so it became
inactivated<00:04:29.050> and<00:04:29.140> all<00:04:29.830> the<00:04:30.100> cells<00:04:30.370> that<00:04:30.490> came

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:30.790 
inactivated and all the cells that came

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:32.940 
inactivated and all the cells that came
from<00:04:30.940> that<00:04:31.030> produced<00:04:31.630> black<00:04:32.020> pigment<00:04:32.590> I<00:04:32.680> think

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:32.950 
from that produced black pigment I think

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:33.750 
from that produced black pigment I think
that's<00:04:33.070> really<00:04:33.280> cool

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
that's really cool

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.680 
that's really cool
likewise<00:04:34.450> in<00:04:34.720> ones<00:04:34.960> where<00:04:35.260> the<00:04:35.620> black<00:04:36.070> one

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
likewise in ones where the black one

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.790 
likewise in ones where the black one
wadded<00:04:37.690> up<00:04:37.810> all<00:04:38.050> the<00:04:38.200> cells<00:04:38.410> that<00:04:38.530> come<00:04:38.710> from

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
wadded up all the cells that come from

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.920 
wadded up all the cells that come from
that<00:04:38.890> is<00:04:39.040> going<00:04:39.250> to<00:04:39.400> produce<00:04:39.550> orange<00:04:40.300> pigment

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
that is going to produce orange pigment

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.620 
that is going to produce orange pigment
and<00:04:41.050> so<00:04:41.590> that's<00:04:41.830> X<00:04:42.160> inactivation<00:04:42.640> it's<00:04:43.330> rare

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.630 
and so that's X inactivation it's rare

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:45.150 
and so that's X inactivation it's rare
that<00:04:43.840> we<00:04:43.960> see<00:04:43.990> this<00:04:44.290> occurring<00:04:44.830> and<00:04:44.980> that's

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.160 
that we see this occurring and that's

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.680 
that we see this occurring and that's
just<00:04:45.340> because<00:04:45.460> sex<00:04:45.850> cells<00:04:46.030> are<00:04:46.150> designed<00:04:46.360> to

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
just because sex cells are designed to

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:48.930 
just because sex cells are designed to
work<00:04:46.840> on<00:04:47.050> their<00:04:47.290> own<00:04:47.440> the<00:04:47.710> X<00:04:47.860> chromosome<00:04:48.370> now

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:48.940 
work on their own the X chromosome now

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:50.130 
work on their own the X chromosome now
two<00:04:49.000> quick<00:04:49.420> questions<00:04:49.570> you<00:04:49.900> should<00:04:50.050> be

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:50.140 
two quick questions you should be

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:51.210 
two quick questions you should be
thinking<00:04:50.470> right<00:04:50.650> away

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.220 
thinking right away

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.310 
thinking right away
is<00:04:51.280> number<00:04:51.940> one<00:04:52.180> what<00:04:52.390> about<00:04:52.420> the<00:04:52.690> white<00:04:52.930> why

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
is number one what about the white why

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.560 
is number one what about the white why
do<00:04:53.380> we<00:04:53.530> get<00:04:53.650> this<00:04:53.710> white<00:04:54.160> coloration<00:04:54.670> well<00:04:55.390> if

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:55.570 
do we get this white coloration well if

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:56.550 
do we get this white coloration well if
you<00:04:55.630> remember<00:04:55.930> when<00:04:56.050> I<00:04:56.080> talked<00:04:56.350> about

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 
you remember when I talked about

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:57.960 
you remember when I talked about
genetics<00:04:57.100> there's<00:04:57.340> a<00:04:57.400> process<00:04:57.790> called

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:57.970 
genetics there's a process called

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.060 
genetics there's a process called
epistasis<00:04:58.570> and<00:04:59.170> so<00:04:59.260> basically<00:04:59.620> there's<00:04:59.920> going

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.070 
epistasis and so basically there's going

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:01.680 
epistasis and so basically there's going
to<00:05:00.160> be<00:05:00.220> a<00:05:00.340> set<00:05:00.640> of<00:05:00.760> genes<00:05:00.940> that<00:05:01.120> determine<00:05:01.330> the

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.690 
to be a set of genes that determine the

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:03.900 
to be a set of genes that determine the
color<00:05:01.960> of<00:05:02.260> the<00:05:02.680> pigment<00:05:03.310> that's<00:05:03.430> added<00:05:03.730> to<00:05:03.820> the

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:03.910 
color of the pigment that's added to the

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:05.400 
color of the pigment that's added to the
hair<00:05:04.090> but<00:05:04.720> there's<00:05:04.870> going<00:05:04.960> to<00:05:05.020> be<00:05:05.110> another

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:05.410 
hair but there's going to be another

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:07.080 
hair but there's going to be another
gene<00:05:05.740> or<00:05:05.950> set<00:05:06.160> of<00:05:06.280> genes<00:05:06.490> that<00:05:06.610> are<00:05:06.790> actually

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.090 
gene or set of genes that are actually

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:09.870 
gene or set of genes that are actually
going<00:05:07.240> to<00:05:07.300> tell<00:05:07.480> us<00:05:07.510> is<00:05:07.780> that<00:05:07.860> color<00:05:08.860> added<00:05:09.610> to

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:09.880 
going to tell us is that color added to

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.370 
going to tell us is that color added to
the<00:05:10.060> hair<00:05:10.270> or<00:05:10.510> not<00:05:10.750> and<00:05:11.050> that's<00:05:11.110> called

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:11.380 
the hair or not and that's called

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:14.120 
the hair or not and that's called
epistasis<00:05:11.770> and<00:05:12.460> so<00:05:12.940> basically<00:05:13.450> in<00:05:13.690> these

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.130 
epistasis and so basically in these

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.560 
epistasis and so basically in these
cells<00:05:15.130> we're<00:05:15.520> not<00:05:15.640> actually<00:05:16.000> adding<00:05:16.450> the

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.570 
cells we're not actually adding the

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:18.840 
cells we're not actually adding the
pigment<00:05:16.930> but<00:05:17.080> up<00:05:17.200> here<00:05:17.230> we've<00:05:17.590> got<00:05:17.740> X<00:05:17.950> and<00:05:18.100> X

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:18.850 
pigment but up here we've got X and X

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:20.880 
pigment but up here we've got X and X
inactivation<00:05:19.380> another<00:05:20.380> question<00:05:20.770> you<00:05:20.860> should

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:20.890 
inactivation another question you should

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:22.710 
inactivation another question you should
be<00:05:21.130> thinking<00:05:21.430> yourself<00:05:21.520> is<00:05:22.030> at<00:05:22.270> the<00:05:22.360> beginning

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 
be thinking yourself is at the beginning

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.230 
be thinking yourself is at the beginning
I<00:05:22.810> said<00:05:22.870> almost<00:05:23.290> all<00:05:23.650> calico<00:05:24.610> cats<00:05:24.880> the<00:05:25.120> you'll

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:25.240 
I said almost all calico cats the you'll

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.390 
I said almost all calico cats the you'll
ever<00:05:25.390> see<00:05:25.600> are<00:05:25.750> going<00:05:25.870> to<00:05:25.930> be<00:05:26.020> female<00:05:26.320> well<00:05:27.250> how

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:27.400 
ever see are going to be female well how

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.060 
ever see are going to be female well how
could<00:05:27.520> we<00:05:27.580> ever<00:05:27.700> have<00:05:28.180> a<00:05:28.540> male<00:05:29.020> calico<00:05:29.770> cat

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:30.070 
could we ever have a male calico cat

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:32.280 
could we ever have a male calico cat
it's<00:05:30.940> pretty<00:05:31.150> simple<00:05:31.690> but<00:05:31.930> maybe<00:05:32.080> not

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:32.290 
it's pretty simple but maybe not

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:33.960 
it's pretty simple but maybe not
intuitive<00:05:32.860> basically<00:05:33.400> what<00:05:33.520> you<00:05:33.610> could<00:05:33.790> get

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:33.970 
intuitive basically what you could get

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:37.920 
intuitive basically what you could get
is<00:05:34.210> a<00:05:34.270> X<00:05:35.050> X<00:05:35.470> Y<00:05:36.040> male<00:05:36.790> and<00:05:37.150> so<00:05:37.450> how<00:05:37.750> does<00:05:37.810> that

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:37.930 
is a X X Y male and so how does that

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.230 
is a X X Y male and so how does that
occur<00:05:38.470> well<00:05:38.800> during<00:05:39.190> meiosis<00:05:39.460> you<00:05:39.850> could<00:05:40.120> get

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 
occur well during meiosis you could get

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.480 
occur well during meiosis you could get
nondisjunction<00:05:40.840> of<00:05:41.470> the<00:05:41.560> two<00:05:41.740> x<00:05:42.010> chromosomes

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:42.490 
nondisjunction of the two x chromosomes

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:44.909 
nondisjunction of the two x chromosomes
and<00:05:42.880> so<00:05:43.450> basically<00:05:43.810> you<00:05:44.020> could<00:05:44.169> get<00:05:44.320> one<00:05:44.560> that

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:44.919 
and so basically you could get one that

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:46.950 
and so basically you could get one that
is<00:05:45.160> of<00:05:45.490> the<00:05:45.580> orange<00:05:45.970> one<00:05:46.210> that<00:05:46.419> is<00:05:46.570> of<00:05:46.840> the

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960 
is of the orange one that is of the

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.430 
is of the orange one that is of the
black<00:05:47.169> and<00:05:47.560> so<00:05:47.950> you<00:05:48.010> could<00:05:48.250> have<00:05:48.460> a<00:05:49.290> we<00:05:50.290> call

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:50.440 
black and so you could have a we call

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:52.470 
black and so you could have a we call
this<00:05:50.620> Klinefelter<00:05:51.430> syndrome<00:05:51.460> in<00:05:51.910> humans<00:05:52.300> but

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:52.480 
this Klinefelter syndrome in humans but

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.030 
this Klinefelter syndrome in humans but
you<00:05:52.600> could<00:05:52.720> have<00:05:52.780> a<00:05:52.840> calico<00:05:53.290> male<00:05:53.560> but<00:05:53.860> again

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:54.040 
you could have a calico male but again

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:55.890 
you could have a calico male but again
it's<00:05:54.190> going<00:05:54.220> to<00:05:54.340> be<00:05:54.430> incredibly<00:05:54.940> rare<00:05:55.210> so

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:55.900 
it's going to be incredibly rare so

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:59.130 
it's going to be incredibly rare so
that's<00:05:56.110> X<00:05:56.880> inactivation<00:05:57.880> it's<00:05:58.660> rare<00:05:58.900> that<00:05:58.930> you

00:05:59.130 --> 00:05:59.140 
that's X inactivation it's rare that you

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:00.840 
that's X inactivation it's rare that you
could<00:05:59.320> see<00:05:59.500> this<00:05:59.680> in<00:05:59.860> humans<00:06:00.250> however<00:06:00.430> I<00:06:00.669> was

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:00.850 
could see this in humans however I was

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:02.880 
could see this in humans however I was
reading<00:06:01.360> and<00:06:01.540> there's<00:06:01.660> a<00:06:01.720> disorder<00:06:02.290> in<00:06:02.320> humans

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:02.890 
reading and there's a disorder in humans

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:05.250 
reading and there's a disorder in humans
where<00:06:03.070> they<00:06:03.220> lack<00:06:03.600> sweat<00:06:04.600> glands<00:06:04.900> you<00:06:05.140> can

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:05.260 
where they lack sweat glands you can

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:06.510 
where they lack sweat glands you can
imagine<00:06:05.620> that's<00:06:05.710> really<00:06:06.070> really<00:06:06.340> dangerous

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:06.520 
imagine that's really really dangerous

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:07.740 
imagine that's really really dangerous
because<00:06:06.850> you<00:06:06.970> can't<00:06:07.270> regulate<00:06:07.540> your

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:07.750 
because you can't regulate your

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:10.230 
because you can't regulate your
temperature<00:06:07.810> and<00:06:08.680> what<00:06:09.280> I<00:06:09.310> found<00:06:09.580> is<00:06:09.820> that<00:06:09.850> if

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:10.240 
temperature and what I found is that if

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.930 
temperature and what I found is that if
you<00:06:10.690> have<00:06:10.990> or<00:06:11.470> are<00:06:11.650> heterozygous<00:06:12.250> for<00:06:12.580> this<00:06:12.730> in

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:12.940 
you have or are heterozygous for this in

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:15.000 
you have or are heterozygous for this in
some<00:06:12.970> females<00:06:13.660> they'll<00:06:14.380> actually<00:06:14.620> have

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:15.010 
some females they'll actually have

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:16.920 
some females they'll actually have
patches<00:06:15.370> of<00:06:15.790> their<00:06:15.940> skin<00:06:16.240> where<00:06:16.480> they<00:06:16.660> have

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:16.930 
patches of their skin where they have

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:18.600 
patches of their skin where they have
sweat<00:06:17.350> glands<00:06:17.620> and<00:06:17.830> patches<00:06:18.250> where<00:06:18.430> they

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:18.610 
sweat glands and patches where they

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:20.159 
sweat glands and patches where they
don't<00:06:18.850> and<00:06:19.270> that's<00:06:19.450> just<00:06:19.660> due<00:06:19.810> to<00:06:19.840> X

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:20.169 
don't and that's just due to X

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:23.790 
don't and that's just due to X
inactivation<00:06:20.470> and<00:06:21.310> I<00:06:21.400> hope<00:06:21.520> that<00:06:21.669> so
