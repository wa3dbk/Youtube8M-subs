considered<00:00:36.399> abuse<00:00:37.289> but<00:00:38.289> I<00:00:38.320> don't<00:00:38.589> think<00:00:38.859> so<00:00:39.629> if

00:00:40.619 --> 00:00:40.629 
considered abuse but I don't think so if

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:42.090 
considered abuse but I don't think so if
you're<00:00:40.870> telling<00:00:41.109> everybody<00:00:41.469> that<00:00:41.800> you<00:00:41.920> make

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.100 
you're telling everybody that you make

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.310 
you're telling everybody that you make
really<00:00:42.579> rugged<00:00:42.850> knives<00:00:43.179> and<00:00:43.600> even<00:00:44.109> if<00:00:44.199> you

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.320 
really rugged knives and even if you

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.500 
really rugged knives and even if you
call<00:00:44.559> it<00:00:44.679> a<00:00:44.710> letter<00:00:44.980> neck<00:00:45.249> that<00:00:45.850> suggests<00:00:46.300> it's

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510 
call it a letter neck that suggests it's

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.720 
call it a letter neck that suggests it's
a<00:00:46.629> rugged<00:00:46.839> knife<00:00:47.140> you<00:00:47.980> should<00:00:48.159> be<00:00:48.309> able<00:00:48.399> to<00:00:48.519> be

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:48.730 
a rugged knife you should be able to be

done with it

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:53.160 
done with it
so<00:00:50.579> perhaps<00:00:51.579> I<00:00:51.879> should<00:00:52.089> change<00:00:52.510> the<00:00:52.659> name<00:00:52.690> to

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
so perhaps I should change the name to

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.040 
so perhaps I should change the name to
tender<00:00:54.010> love<00:00:54.249> and<00:00:54.280> care<00:00:54.460> knife<00:00:54.999> and<00:00:55.269> put<00:00:55.839> it<00:00:55.929> on

and here a fall says if you take it like
this<00:02:33.270> the<00:02:34.270> weight<00:02:34.480> is<00:02:34.630> in<00:02:34.660> the<00:02:34.810> front<00:02:34.900> of<00:02:35.230> the

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
this the weight is in the front of the

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.280 
this the weight is in the front of the
blade<00:02:35.560> so<00:02:35.860> it<00:02:36.790> will<00:02:36.970> chop<00:02:37.270> that<00:02:37.810> will<00:02:38.020> chop

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
blade so it will chop that will chop

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.090 
blade so it will chop that will chop
families<00:02:39.220> decent<00:02:39.400> by<00:02:40.090> the<00:02:40.150> way<00:02:40.800> you<00:02:41.800> have<00:02:42.010> the

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
families decent by the way you have the

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.300 
families decent by the way you have the
possibility<00:02:42.790> to<00:02:42.819> choke<00:02:43.269> up<00:02:43.480> to<00:02:43.630> the<00:02:43.750> blade<00:02:43.959> and

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
possibility to choke up to the blade and

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.820 
possibility to choke up to the blade and
use<00:02:45.310> it<00:02:45.550> more<00:02:46.330> in<00:02:46.480> a<00:02:46.569> bush<00:02:46.780> crafting<00:02:47.319> style<00:02:47.680> of

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
use it more in a bush crafting style of

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.420 
use it more in a bush crafting style of
way<00:02:48.040> for<00:02:48.489> carving<00:02:48.970> etc<00:02:49.480> and<00:02:50.290> if<00:02:50.739> you<00:02:50.890> look<00:02:51.220> if

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
way for carving etc and if you look if

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.670 
way for carving etc and if you look if
you<00:02:51.489> put<00:02:51.730> your<00:02:52.000> finger<00:02:52.299> here<00:02:52.480> then<00:02:53.380> the<00:02:53.500> weight

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
you put your finger here then the weight

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.800 
you put your finger here then the weight
is<00:02:53.890> in<00:02:54.040> the<00:02:54.280> handle<00:02:54.670> in<00:02:54.819> the<00:02:54.910> backside<00:02:55.330> so<00:02:55.390> it's

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
is in the handle in the backside so it's

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:01.590 
is in the handle in the backside so it's
easier<00:02:56.799> to<00:02:56.860> maneuver<00:02:58.650> so<00:03:00.180> that's<00:03:01.180> about<00:03:01.330> the

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
easier to maneuver so that's about the

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.860 
easier to maneuver so that's about the
modifications<00:03:02.290> to<00:03:02.500> the<00:03:02.860> blade<00:03:03.160> and<00:03:03.880> I'm<00:03:04.569> going

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
modifications to the blade and I'm going

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:10.229 
modifications to the blade and I'm going
to<00:03:04.959> add<00:03:05.110> some<00:03:05.319> more<00:03:05.500> glue<00:03:06.040> over<00:03:06.340> here<00:03:09.060> dance<00:03:10.060> or

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
to add some more glue over here dance or

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:15.410 
to add some more glue over here dance or
modifications<00:03:10.900> to<00:03:10.989> the<00:03:11.700> sheet<00:03:13.680> first<00:03:14.680> I

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
modifications to the sheet first I

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.660 
modifications to the sheet first I
squared<00:03:16.420> this<00:03:16.690> part<00:03:17.170> of<00:03:17.380> because<00:03:17.769> this<00:03:18.040> one<00:03:18.459> is

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
squared this part of because this one is

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.550 
squared this part of because this one is
primarily<00:03:19.630> going<00:03:19.989> inside<00:03:20.650> my<00:03:20.980> pack<00:03:21.280> I<00:03:22.560> don't

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
primarily going inside my pack I don't

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:24.780 
primarily going inside my pack I don't
need<00:03:23.739> to<00:03:23.859> point<00:03:24.130> there

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
need to point there

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.830 
need to point there
it<00:03:24.970> makes<00:03:25.299> the<00:03:25.510> whole<00:03:26.500> blade<00:03:27.370> or<00:03:28.209> the<00:03:28.480> package

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
it makes the whole blade or the package

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.060 
it makes the whole blade or the package
longer<00:03:29.620> and<00:03:29.880> it<00:03:30.880> might<00:03:31.090> even<00:03:31.900> puncture<00:03:32.590> my

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.070 
longer and it might even puncture my

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:35.640 
longer and it might even puncture my
backpack<00:03:33.690> after<00:03:34.690> a<00:03:34.720> while<00:03:34.959> cough<00:03:35.410> after

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
backpack after a while cough after

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.620 
backpack after a while cough after
rubbing<00:03:36.489> it<00:03:36.640> so<00:03:37.299> I<00:03:37.329> flatten<00:03:38.019> this<00:03:38.230> part<00:03:39.010> I<00:03:39.630> love

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
rubbing it so I flatten this part I love

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:46.050 
rubbing it so I flatten this part I love
with<00:03:40.810> this<00:03:41.019> part<00:03:42.120> and<00:03:43.950> what<00:03:44.950> I<00:03:44.980> will<00:03:45.130> do<00:03:45.670> also

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
with this part and what I will do also

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.599 
with this part and what I will do also
is<00:03:47.670> glue<00:03:48.670> this<00:03:49.890> because<00:03:50.890> I<00:03:51.040> don't<00:03:51.220> need<00:03:51.430> to

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:51.609 
is glue this because I don't need to

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:54.720 
is glue this because I don't need to
change<00:03:51.910> this<00:03:52.150> every<00:03:52.510> time<00:03:53.190> I'm<00:03:54.190> just<00:03:54.400> going<00:03:54.640> to

change this every time I'm just going to
glue<00:03:54.880> it<00:03:54.970> make<00:03:55.720> it<00:03:55.900> real<00:03:56.790> real<00:03:57.790> hard<00:03:58.090> use<00:03:58.890> but<00:03:59.890> I

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
glue it make it real real hard use but I

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.460 
glue it make it real real hard use but I
do<00:04:00.010> like<00:04:00.280> the<00:04:00.430> sheet<00:04:00.640> by<00:04:01.000> the<00:04:01.060> way<00:04:01.470> your
