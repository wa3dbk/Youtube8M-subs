sink<00:04:06.440> into<00:04:06.590> the<00:04:06.680> car<00:04:06.949> we<00:04:07.190> designed<00:04:07.549> it<00:04:07.639> into

00:04:07.899 --> 00:04:07.909 
sink into the car we designed it into

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:09.699 
sink into the car we designed it into
the<00:04:08.030> central<00:04:08.359> nervous<00:04:08.389> system<00:04:08.959> of<00:04:09.079> the<00:04:09.139> car<00:04:09.349> it

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:09.709 
the central nervous system of the car it

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:11.229 
the central nervous system of the car it
can<00:04:09.949> talk<00:04:10.159> to<00:04:10.310> every<00:04:10.609> computer<00:04:10.940> in<00:04:11.090> the
