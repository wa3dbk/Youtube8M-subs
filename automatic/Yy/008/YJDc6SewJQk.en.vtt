position that we reached after 41 moves

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.770 
position that we reached after 41 moves
and<00:00:13.710> it's<00:00:14.549> white<00:00:14.820> to<00:00:14.849> move<00:00:15.030> here<00:00:15.420> I<00:00:15.480> was

and it's white to move here I was
playing<00:00:16.020> white<00:00:16.320> here<00:00:16.680> and<00:00:17.270> well<00:00:18.270> perhaps<00:00:18.420> you

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
playing white here and well perhaps you

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.560 
playing white here and well perhaps you
would<00:00:18.840> like<00:00:19.020> to<00:00:19.320> have<00:00:19.789> for<00:00:20.789> yourself<00:00:20.910> a<00:00:21.330> short

look<00:00:21.779> first<00:00:22.500> at<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:22.800> position<00:00:23.220> you<00:00:23.580> can<00:00:23.730> pause

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
look first at the position you can pause

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.640 
look first at the position you can pause
the<00:00:24.119> video<00:00:24.210> if<00:00:24.449> you<00:00:24.480> like<00:00:24.720> and<00:00:24.990> see<00:00:25.230> what<00:00:25.439> would

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
the video if you like and see what would

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.769 
the video if you like and see what would
you<00:00:25.800> play<00:00:26.070> with<00:00:26.099> white<00:00:26.640> here<00:00:28.099> so<00:00:29.210> the<00:00:30.210> thing<00:00:30.480> in

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
you play with white here so the thing in

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.209 
you play with white here so the thing in
this<00:00:30.929> position<00:00:31.470> is<00:00:31.590> that<00:00:31.830> black<00:00:32.730> is<00:00:33.770> has<00:00:34.770> some

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
this position is that black is has some

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.889 
this position is that black is has some
winning<00:00:35.850> chances<00:00:36.500> because<00:00:37.500> of<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.190> fact<00:00:38.489> that

00:00:38.889 --> 00:00:38.899 
winning chances because of the fact that

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:41.750 
winning chances because of the fact that
the<00:00:39.899> bone<00:00:40.350> structure<00:00:40.920> of<00:00:41.040> black<00:00:41.309> is<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.550> bit

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
the bone structure of black is a bit

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.119 
the bone structure of black is a bit
better<00:00:41.969> than<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.480> white<00:00:42.840> bone<00:00:43.170> structure<00:00:43.649> if

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
better than the white bone structure if

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.150 
better than the white bone structure if
we<00:00:44.370> count<00:00:44.579> dick<00:00:45.059> so<00:00:45.300> called<00:00:45.539> bone<00:00:45.930> islands<00:00:46.469> we

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
we count dick so called bone islands we

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.360 
we count dick so called bone islands we
can<00:00:47.309> see<00:00:47.489> that<00:00:47.640> black<00:00:47.910> has<00:00:48.120> one<00:00:48.570> two<00:00:49.379> three

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
can see that black has one two three

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.720 
can see that black has one two three
islands<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.530> one<00:00:52.530> white<00:00:52.890> has<00:00:53.070> four<00:00:53.309> islands

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
islands and one white has four islands

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.900 
islands and one white has four islands
for<00:00:54.449> isolated<00:00:55.020> bones<00:00:55.260> so<00:00:56.160> there<00:00:56.610> are<00:00:56.699> more

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
for isolated bones so there are more

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.389 
for isolated bones so there are more
weakness<00:00:57.300> in<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.690> white<00:00:58.350> bone<00:00:58.710> structure<00:00:59.219> but

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
weakness in the white bone structure but

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.720 
weakness in the white bone structure but
in<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.640> white<00:00:59.820> in<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.149> black<00:01:00.449> bone<00:01:01.020> structure

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
in the white in the black bone structure

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.270 
in the white in the black bone structure
the<00:01:02.730> threat<00:01:03.120> of<00:01:03.300> black<00:01:04.229> is<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.799> trade<00:01:05.070> the

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
and after that after King takes d3 then

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.890 
and after that after King takes d3 then
advance<00:01:13.439> with<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.680> king<00:01:13.920> to<00:01:14.310> a5<00:01:14.790> and<00:01:15.150> then<00:01:15.689> to

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
advance with the king to a5 and then to

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.740 
advance with the king to a5 and then to
g4<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.650> capture<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.189> H<00:01:17.310> bone<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:17.880> then<00:01:18.420> he

g4 and capture the H bone and then he

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.850 
g4 and capture the H bone and then he
has<00:01:18.930> this<00:01:20.299> strong<00:01:21.299> weapon<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:22.200> H<00:01:22.380> bone<00:01:22.710> the

has this strong weapon the H bone the

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.039 
has this strong weapon the H bone the
will<00:01:23.009> advance<00:01:23.310> so<00:01:23.970> that<00:01:24.000> means<00:01:24.360> that<00:01:24.630> here

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
will advance so that means that here

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.730 
will advance so that means that here
white<00:01:25.979> should<00:01:26.909> not<00:01:27.180> trade<00:01:27.720> vision<00:01:28.380> bishops

white should not trade vision bishops

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.010 
white should not trade vision bishops
there<00:01:29.369> are<00:01:29.490> different<00:01:30.180> ways<00:01:30.360> of<00:01:30.750> avoiding

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
there are different ways of avoiding

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.999 
there are different ways of avoiding
this<00:01:31.650> trade<00:01:32.280> of<00:01:32.460> Bishops<00:01:32.880> of<00:01:33.560> course<00:01:34.560> we<00:01:34.860> need

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
this trade of Bishops of course we need

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.340 
this trade of Bishops of course we need
to<00:01:35.159> stay<00:01:35.369> on<00:01:35.400> this<00:01:35.670> diagonal<00:01:36.000> so<00:01:36.299> we<00:01:36.600> have<00:01:36.780> five

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
to stay on this diagonal so we have five

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.649 
to stay on this diagonal so we have five
possible<00:01:37.950> moves<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.520> believe<00:01:39.180> it<00:01:39.329> or<00:01:39.479> not

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
possible moves and believe it or not

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.170 
possible moves and believe it or not
only<00:01:40.140> one<00:01:40.380> of<00:01:40.409> those<00:01:40.770> five<00:01:41.040> moves<00:01:41.430> is<00:01:41.729> correct

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
only one of those five moves is correct

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.770 
only one of those five moves is correct
in<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.799> game<00:01:44.009> I<00:01:44.250> chose<00:01:44.280> for<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.270> wrong<00:01:45.540> one

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
in the game I chose for the wrong one

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.550 
in the game I chose for the wrong one
and<00:01:46.020> I<00:01:47.149> find<00:01:48.149> this<00:01:48.420> moment<00:01:49.020> actually<00:01:49.380> very

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
and I find this moment actually very

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.100 
and I find this moment actually very
instructive<00:01:50.159> because<00:01:50.610> it<00:01:50.759> shows<00:01:51.030> how<00:01:51.110> subtle

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
instructive because it shows how subtle

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.130 
instructive because it shows how subtle
and<00:01:52.409> subtle<00:01:52.979> sometimes<00:01:53.520> mistakes<00:01:54.420> can<00:01:54.750> be<00:01:54.780> in

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
and subtle sometimes mistakes can be in

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.850 
and subtle sometimes mistakes can be in
the<00:01:55.829> endgame<00:01:56.869> let<00:01:57.869> me<00:01:57.990> show<00:01:58.140> you<00:01:58.200> what<00:01:58.560> happens

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
the endgame let me show you what happens

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.289 
the endgame let me show you what happens
in<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.070> game<00:01:59.100> and<00:01:59.490> after<00:01:59.549> that<00:01:59.820> I'm<00:02:00.030> going<00:02:00.210> to

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
in the game and after that I'm going to

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.749 
in the game and after that I'm going to
show<00:02:00.450> you<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.869> correct<00:02:01.740> continuation<00:02:02.640> in

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
show you the correct continuation in

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.389 
show you the correct continuation in
this<00:02:03.020> innocent<00:02:04.020> game<00:02:04.200> what<00:02:04.770> I<00:02:04.799> did<00:02:05.009> is<00:02:05.250> I

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
so I advanced the poem and then it plays

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:27.060

King<00:02:21.340> to<00:02:21.520> a5<00:02:24.660> the<00:02:25.660> bishop<00:02:26.530> only<00:02:26.710> to<00:02:26.890> is

King to a5 the bishop only to is
guarding<00:02:27.580> g4<00:02:28.330> so<00:02:28.690> that<00:02:28.930> the<00:02:29.620> King<00:02:29.830> cannot

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
guarding g4 so that the King cannot

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.020 
guarding g4 so that the King cannot
advance<00:02:30.280> to<00:02:30.460> g4

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030

but<00:02:31.270> he's<00:02:31.420> attacking<00:02:31.920> f4<00:02:32.920> so<00:02:33.100> we<00:02:33.220> need<00:02:33.370> to

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:33.460 
but he's attacking f4 so we need to

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.200 
but he's attacking f4 so we need to
defend<00:02:33.730> the<00:02:33.910> one<00:02:34.440> King<00:02:35.440> to<00:02:35.560> e3<00:02:36.090> defending<00:02:37.090> the

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:51.210 
blacks strategy plays now Bishop to g4
attacking<00:02:46.690> the<00:02:47.050> pawn<00:02:47.290> on<00:02:47.560> d5<00:02:48.070> and<00:02:49.770> there<00:02:50.770> is<00:02:50.920> in

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
attacking the pawn on d5 and there is in

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.380 
attacking the pawn on d5 and there is in
fact<00:02:51.250> no<00:02:51.610> way<00:02:51.940> to<00:02:52.360> to<00:02:52.930> save<00:02:53.170> the<00:02:53.350> game<00:02:53.530> already

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
fact no way to to save the game already

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.630 
fact no way to to save the game already
here<00:02:55.390> first<00:02:55.810> I've<00:02:55.990> calculated<00:02:56.800> what<00:02:57.310> happens

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
here first I've calculated what happens

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.910 
here first I've calculated what happens
if<00:02:57.760> I<00:02:57.820> play<00:02:58.030> Bishop<00:02:58.240> c4<00:02:58.900> and<00:02:59.140> I<00:02:59.470> came<00:02:59.680> to<00:02:59.800> the

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
if I play Bishop c4 and I came to the

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.380 
if I play Bishop c4 and I came to the
conclusion<00:03:00.340> that<00:03:00.370> if<00:03:00.700> I<00:03:00.820> would<00:03:01.000> play<00:03:01.150> Bishop

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
conclusion that if I would play Bishop

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.470 
conclusion that if I would play Bishop
to<00:03:01.600> c4<00:03:02.020> here<00:03:02.610> it's<00:03:03.610> not<00:03:03.820> what<00:03:04.000> I<00:03:04.030> did<00:03:04.150> in<00:03:04.390> the

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
to c4 here it's not what I did in the

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.720 
to c4 here it's not what I did in the
game<00:03:04.660> but<00:03:04.810> if<00:03:05.110> I<00:03:05.320> would<00:03:05.500> have<00:03:05.800> done<00:03:06.040> this<00:03:06.190> then

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
game but if I would have done this then

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:12.060 
game but if I would have done this then
he<00:03:06.910> can<00:03:07.060> play<00:03:07.240> Bishop<00:03:07.450> to<00:03:07.660> h1<00:03:08.170> and<00:03:09.870> in<00:03:10.870> fact<00:03:11.769> I

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070 
he can play Bishop to h1 and in fact I

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.160 
he can play Bishop to h1 and in fact I
am<00:03:12.370> right<00:03:12.760> now<00:03:12.940> in<00:03:13.239> a<00:03:13.330> 6-1<00:03:13.660> position<00:03:14.550> because

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
am right now in a 6-1 position because

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.680 
am right now in a 6-1 position because
black<00:03:17.170> is<00:03:17.670> threatening<00:03:18.670> on<00:03:18.880> one<00:03:19.120> hand<00:03:19.390> to

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
black is threatening on one hand to

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.979 
black is threatening on one hand to
enter<00:03:20.489> here<00:03:21.489> and<00:03:21.700> on<00:03:22.269> the<00:03:22.390> other<00:03:22.510> hand<00:03:22.750> I

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
enter here and on the other hand I

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:25.740 
enter here and on the other hand I
cannot<00:03:23.470> move<00:03:23.709> the<00:03:24.519> Bishop<00:03:24.790> to<00:03:24.910> e2<00:03:25.030> back<00:03:25.420> to

cannot move the Bishop to e2 back to

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.020 
cannot move the Bishop to e2 back to
prevent<00:03:25.959> this<00:03:26.350> entrance<00:03:26.920> because<00:03:27.400> the<00:03:27.880> bishop

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
prevent this entrance because the bishop

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.880 
prevent this entrance because the bishop
is<00:03:28.239> attacking<00:03:28.620> d5<00:03:29.620> my<00:03:30.580> king<00:03:30.910> is<00:03:31.540> bound<00:03:31.930> to<00:03:32.769> the

is attacking d5 my king is bound to the
defense<00:03:33.220> of<00:03:33.519> a<00:03:33.640> four<00:03:33.970> so<00:03:34.959> that<00:03:35.290> means<00:03:35.709> that

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
defense of a four so that means that

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.370 
defense of a four so that means that
here<00:03:36.250> with<00:03:36.519> white<00:03:36.760> we<00:03:37.030> don't<00:03:37.239> have<00:03:37.510> any<00:03:37.780> good

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
here with white we don't have any good

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.930 
here with white we don't have any good
move<00:03:38.830> to<00:03:39.040> make<00:03:40.260> this<00:03:41.260> is<00:03:41.440> a<00:03:41.470> loss<00:03:41.680> position<00:03:41.940> so

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
move to make this is a loss position so

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.539 
move to make this is a loss position so
for<00:03:43.570> example<00:03:44.080> for<00:03:44.680> example<00:03:44.709> of<00:03:45.070> the<00:03:45.160> Bishop<00:03:45.430> to

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:45.549 
for example for example of the Bishop to

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:49.670 
for example for example of the Bishop to
b3<00:03:45.700> and<00:03:46.180> King<00:03:46.450> to<00:03:46.630> g4<00:03:47.080> simply<00:03:47.500> wins<00:03:47.680> after

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
b3 and King to g4 simply wins after

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.520 
b3 and King to g4 simply wins after
calculating<00:03:50.680> this<00:03:51.010> I<00:03:51.840> thought<00:03:52.840> okay<00:03:53.200> let<00:03:53.410> me

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
calculating this I thought okay let me

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.039 
calculating this I thought okay let me
try<00:03:53.739> something<00:03:54.370> else<00:03:54.459> perhaps<00:03:54.760> it<00:03:55.660> will<00:03:55.810> work

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:56.049 
try something else perhaps it will work

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:59.160 
try something else perhaps it will work
if<00:03:56.380> I<00:03:56.850> try<00:03:57.850> some<00:03:58.030> tactics<00:03:58.450> by<00:03:58.780> giving<00:03:59.080> and

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
if I try some tactics by giving and

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.410 
if I try some tactics by giving and
check<00:03:59.380> on<00:03:59.650> g4<00:04:00.160> so<00:04:00.400> I<00:04:00.459> play<00:04:00.640> Bishop<00:04:00.850> to<00:04:01.150> g4<00:04:01.570> check

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
check on g4 so I play Bishop to g4 check

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.800 
check on g4 so I play Bishop to g4 check
this<00:04:04.200> is<00:04:04.320> also<00:04:04.500> losing<00:04:04.740> effects<00:04:05.520> but<00:04:05.700> I<00:04:05.970> just

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
this is also losing effects but I just

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.450 
this is also losing effects but I just
wanted<00:04:07.260> to<00:04:07.500> see<00:04:08.220> if<00:04:08.460> his<00:04:08.700> good<00:04:09.540> work<00:04:10.190> perhaps<00:04:11.190> I

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:11.460 
wanted to see if his good work perhaps I

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.700 
wanted to see if his good work perhaps I
could<00:04:11.520> persuade<00:04:12.120> him<00:04:12.240> to<00:04:12.300> take<00:04:12.630> on<00:04:12.780> h4<00:04:13.200> and<00:04:13.470> go

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:13.710 
could persuade him to take on h4 and go

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:16.370 
could persuade him to take on h4 and go
with<00:04:13.950> my<00:04:14.070> king<00:04:14.340> to<00:04:14.580> to<00:04:14.850> d6<00:04:15.210> capture<00:04:15.780> d6<00:04:16.170> and<00:04:16.290> of

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:19.080 
this past born but my opponent played it

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:20.330 
this past born but my opponent played it
very<00:04:19.320> accurately

very accurately
we<00:04:20.430> played<00:04:20.640> h5<00:04:21.060> first<00:04:21.650> my<00:04:22.650> king<00:04:22.890> cannot<00:04:23.130> enter

all<00:05:02.340> the<00:05:02.580> other<00:05:02.730> players<00:05:03.000> already<00:05:03.540> had<00:05:03.720> to

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
all the other players already had to

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.909 
all the other players already had to
finish<00:05:04.200> their<00:05:05.130> games<00:05:05.370> and<00:05:06.110> I<00:05:07.110> continued<00:05:07.710> a<00:05:07.800> bit

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919 
finish their games and I continued a bit

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:11.570 
finish their games and I continued a bit
longer<00:05:08.130> but<00:05:08.400> this<00:05:08.970> was<00:05:09.240> actually<00:05:10.050> lost<00:05:10.620> now

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 
longer but this was actually lost now

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.690 
longer but this was actually lost now
let<00:05:11.760> me<00:05:11.850> return<00:05:12.030> to<00:05:12.419> the<00:05:12.540> initial<00:05:12.930> position

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:13.700 
let me return to the initial position

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:19.010 
let me return to the initial position
where<00:05:14.700> I<00:05:14.730> started<00:05:15.300> so<00:05:15.510> that's<00:05:16.440> here<00:05:17.360> so<00:05:18.360> Bishop

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020 
where I started so that's here so Bishop

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.930 
where I started so that's here so Bishop
to<00:05:19.110> e2<00:05:19.250> is<00:05:20.250> a<00:05:21.000> losing<00:05:21.270> move<00:05:22.340> the<00:05:23.340> correct<00:05:23.730> way

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940 
to e2 is a losing move the correct way

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:28.730 
to e2 is a losing move the correct way
to<00:05:23.970> play<00:05:24.210> this<00:05:25.160> I<00:05:26.160> analyzed<00:05:26.970> it<00:05:27.180> and<00:05:27.290> it<00:05:28.290> should

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:28.740 
to play this I analyzed it and it should

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:32.270 
to play this I analyzed it and it should
be<00:05:28.950> 5<00:05:29.250> actually<00:05:29.780> the<00:05:30.780> difference<00:05:31.280> the

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280 
be 5 actually the difference the

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.010 
be 5 actually the difference the
difference<00:05:32.610> is<00:05:33.060> that<00:05:33.240> with<00:05:34.080> Bishop<00:05:34.380> to<00:05:34.530> b5<00:05:35.100> I'm

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:36.020 
difference is that with Bishop to b5 I'm

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:40.070 
difference is that with Bishop to b5 I'm
already<00:05:37.020> defending<00:05:37.560> a<00:05:37.740> 4<00:05:38.390> so<00:05:39.390> that<00:05:39.570> means<00:05:39.750> that

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 
already defending a 4 so that means that

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.040 
already defending a 4 so that means that
a<00:05:40.350> move<00:05:40.680> like<00:05:40.919> Bishop<00:05:41.220> to<00:05:41.310> c2<00:05:41.730> doesn't<00:05:42.600> win<00:05:42.840> a

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 
a move like Bishop to c2 doesn't win a

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:50.240 
a move like Bishop to c2 doesn't win a
temple<00:05:44.540> so<00:05:45.540> here<00:05:45.990> white<00:05:46.860> can<00:05:46.890> play<00:05:47.100> King<00:05:47.760> to<00:05:47.910> e3

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:50.250 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:54.530 

and<00:05:50.630> if<00:05:51.630> the<00:05:51.960> king<00:05:52.110> goes<00:05:52.290> to<00:05:52.410> a5<00:05:53.180> then<00:05:54.180> Bishop

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:54.540 
and if the king goes to a5 then Bishop

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:58.160 
and if the king goes to a5 then Bishop
to<00:05:55.020> d7<00:05:55.850> the<00:05:56.850> bishop<00:05:57.270> now<00:05:57.420> the<00:05:57.480> white<00:05:57.810> Bishop

00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:58.170 
to d7 the bishop now the white Bishop

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:01.460 
to d7 the bishop now the white Bishop
hazard<00:05:58.500> has<00:05:58.770> two<00:05:59.010> functions<00:05:59.280> two<00:06:00.110> tasks<00:06:01.110> that

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:01.470 
hazard has two functions two tasks that

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:04.760 
hazard has two functions two tasks that
you<00:06:01.620> can<00:06:01.650> perform<00:06:02.480> preventing<00:06:03.480> the<00:06:04.020> black

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:04.770 
you can perform preventing the black

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:08.630 
you can perform preventing the black
King<00:06:05.010> from<00:06:05.580> entering<00:06:05.970> on<00:06:06.650> g4<00:06:07.650> and<00:06:07.860> also

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:08.640 
King from entering on g4 and also

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:13.370 
King from entering on g4 and also
defending<00:06:09.300> a<00:06:09.560> four<00:06:10.640> so<00:06:11.640> here<00:06:11.940> there<00:06:12.330> is<00:06:12.360> no<00:06:13.140> way

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:13.380 
defending a four so here there is no way

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:17.330 
defending a four so here there is no way
to<00:06:13.410> to<00:06:14.280> make<00:06:14.460> any<00:06:15.120> progress<00:06:15.450> for<00:06:15.840> black<00:06:16.340> the

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:17.340 
to to make any progress for black the

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:19.430 
to to make any progress for black the
king<00:06:17.550> must<00:06:17.730> go<00:06:17.880> to<00:06:17.940> f6<00:06:18.450> for<00:06:18.660> example<00:06:19.080> then<00:06:19.290> we

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:19.440 
king must go to f6 for example then we

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.410 
king must go to f6 for example then we
simply<00:06:19.770> go<00:06:19.890> back<00:06:19.920> with<00:06:20.250> the<00:06:20.340> Bishop<00:06:20.580> to<00:06:20.700> b5<00:06:21.060> and

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:21.420 
simply go back with the Bishop to b5 and

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:24.550 
simply go back with the Bishop to b5 and
there<00:06:21.960> is<00:06:22.080> no<00:06:22.380> way<00:06:22.950> of<00:06:23.280> making<00:06:23.550> progress<00:06:24.090> for

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:24.560 
there is no way of making progress for

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:28.340 
there is no way of making progress for
black<00:06:25.560> so<00:06:26.280> this<00:06:26.460> was<00:06:26.700> actually<00:06:26.970> the<00:06:27.300> way<00:06:27.540> to<00:06:27.600> to

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:28.350 
black so this was actually the way to to

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:32.390 
black so this was actually the way to to
play<00:06:28.530> this<00:06:28.710> endgame<00:06:29.130> and<00:06:30.800> now<00:06:31.800> go<00:06:31.980> back<00:06:32.160> to<00:06:32.190> the

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:32.400 
play this endgame and now go back to the

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.220 
play this endgame and now go back to the
initial<00:06:32.520> position<00:06:32.760> again<00:06:33.210> if<00:06:33.600> we<00:06:33.840> start<00:06:34.140> here

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:34.230 
initial position again if we start here

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:38.570 
initial position again if we start here
you<00:06:35.070> see<00:06:35.340> how<00:06:35.610> this<00:06:36.240> subtleties<00:06:37.170> work<00:06:37.770> is<00:06:38.220> just

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:38.580 
you see how this subtleties work is just

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:41.330 
you see how this subtleties work is just
one<00:06:38.850> tempo<00:06:39.390> that<00:06:39.570> is<00:06:39.780> important<00:06:40.320> and<00:06:40.500> the

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:41.340 
one tempo that is important and the

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:45.650 
one tempo that is important and the
position<00:06:41.820> of<00:06:41.940> this<00:06:42.180> Bishop<00:06:42.570> is<00:06:42.720> on<00:06:43.610> b5<00:06:44.610> and<00:06:44.880> d7

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:45.660 
position of this Bishop is on b5 and d7

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:48.740 
position of this Bishop is on b5 and d7
actually<00:06:45.960> much<00:06:46.110> better<00:06:46.320> than<00:06:46.500> on<00:06:47.130> this<00:06:47.750> part

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:48.750 
actually much better than on this part

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:51.490 
actually much better than on this part
of<00:06:48.900> the<00:06:48.990> board<00:06:49.200> where<00:06:49.440> I<00:06:49.470> placed<00:06:50.190> it<00:06:50.370> on<00:06:50.460> on<00:06:50.820> e2

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:51.500 
of the board where I placed it on on e2

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:55.760 
of the board where I placed it on on e2
so<00:06:52.500> that<00:06:53.280> was<00:06:53.550> another<00:06:54.090> let's<00:06:54.930> say<00:06:55.169> tough

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:55.770 
so that was another let's say tough

00:06:55.770 --> 00:07:00.740 
so that was another let's say tough
lesson<00:06:56.190> for<00:06:56.220> me<00:06:56.550> I<00:06:56.730> I<00:06:57.510> lost<00:06:58.050> the<00:06:58.230> game<00:06:58.440> but<00:06:59.750> we

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:00.750 
lesson for me I I lost the game but we

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:03.470 
lesson for me I I lost the game but we
won<00:07:00.960> we<00:07:01.169> won<00:07:01.440> actually<00:07:01.919> a<00:07:02.430> bit<00:07:03.120> more<00:07:03.150> of

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:03.480 
won we won actually a bit more of

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.330 
won we won actually a bit more of
knowledge<00:07:03.780> about<00:07:04.050> the<00:07:04.350> endgame<00:07:04.650> that's

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:05.340 
knowledge about the endgame that's

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:07.130 
knowledge about the endgame that's
that's<00:07:06.000> the<00:07:06.090> most<00:07:06.210> important<00:07:06.690> thing<00:07:06.720> when<00:07:07.050> you

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:07.140 
that's the most important thing when you

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:09.740 
that's the most important thing when you
lose<00:07:07.290> the<00:07:07.410> game<00:07:07.580> really<00:07:08.580> take<00:07:09.150> your<00:07:09.330> time<00:07:09.540> to
