00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.600
 hello rakhine friends in this 

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:08.200
 opportunity let's open the bar 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:10.719
 connection number 15 as you have 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:13.509
 seen there is an event the extension of 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:16.810
 connection bar and the connection is now 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:20.890
 the event is going to be until the 12th 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:22.320
 August that is when the event of 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:26.100
 July 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:29.490
 and some recommendations when we say 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:33.900
 you come in like this and so what you 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.850
 you do is so that if you want that 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.440
 upload advance collection and they are not 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.710
 connect 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.879
 with the income 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:45.230
 and reject because reject because if not 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:48.470
 they can refuse they gave you the 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.870
 invitations to enter the rooms as well 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:54.410
 can refuse, they will not reach you anymore 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:57.590
 becoming balaguer the computer and so 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:00.230
 will be able to move more calmly 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:05.030
 if you have a computer you can 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:08.330
 leave it on but they are not or not 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.300
 exaggerate so much and let her rest 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.700
 computer 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:15.149
 two 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:18.899
 to two or more hours so that way 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:21.440
 after you understand it again and you can 

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:25.430
 get to 15 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:28.000
 they saw this I got to 15 a little while ago 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.170
 I was just in 14 high little 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.620
 meanwhile I was doing the tv 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:36.850
 park and what we have to stay here 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:40.030
 this is necessarily the tickets 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:42.430
 without doubt they have to give us 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.460
 the tickets for the second ticket 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:49.710
 of gatza but without creating 5 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:51.690
 I do not think they give us anything else because 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.659
 would be against the rules as 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.700
 they publish it 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:58.310
 and what they have to give us is the 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:02.270
 second gazzano tickets saw 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:07.390
 second gacha tickets 5 see 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.390
 this I recommend this 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.759
 that they exchange these they know why 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.640
 let's use 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.640
 5 tickets 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:23.560
 and I already have six and one that had 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.560
 previously with 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.840
 with assistance not 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:32.200
 what did he give you 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.840
 where is the assistance here 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:38.800
 brandon watson will issue protective 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:43.140
 rating on the pack in the second gacha 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.140
 ticket 1 and 2 the core 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:49.500
 because I recommend that not to mention 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:53.580
 it gives you 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:57.150
 from 11 30% discount when 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:03:01.700
 there are about seven days to produce the 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.700
 second ticket of the gacha and what else 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:05.270
 I do not remember 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.490
 I think it was 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:14.800
 Let's see 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:14.800
 I not remember giving 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:22.820
 I only remember that it gives from 11 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:25.700
 give this 30% discount second ticket 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:28.190
 the gacha had the tickets for 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.980
 make park theme 10 of the tickets 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:33.590
 to do the park won of yÃºnes pack 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:38.500
 and 7 days of power research 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.500
 because redeem at 15 why 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:43.250
 because only you what they have 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.250
 what to do is 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:49.340
 get the first tickets 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.710
 Let's see 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:55.700
 they usually appear here 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:55.700
 here they are not 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.840
 I do not appreciate 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:11.640
 if you manage to get the first 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:14.430
 ticket 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:18.600
 they go to draw and they put the first ticket 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:21.750
 which is the one here can use the 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:24.810
 ticket and the four objects is going to 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:27.630
 touch one and you can use again 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:30.180
 ticket and it's going to play and another 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:32.660
 object of the three that are missing and that 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:35.880
 it would be satisfactory because we say 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:38.669
 you say put a calf that does not 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.960
 They can easily get as you can 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:46.680
 be in this event 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:49.410
 or a baby let's say the enlisting they put it 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.720
 they like the ticket and they get the third 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:54.900
 they use the other ticket and maybe they touch 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:57.210
 the second or fourth or maybe it's their turn 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.630
 the first one and they touch what you 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:02.440
 they want but always try to look 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:05.560
 something that 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:08.320
 I put here the search engine and see things that 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:10.810
 they serve you for example if you touch 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:13.120
 grabbing a pullback that may be that 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:15.579
 yes because that gives you several points I think 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.839
 that gives more than 100 

00:05:15.579 --> 00:05:20.370
 there is a good amount of points and 

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:25.229
 you have tracks you know why 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:28.080
 in a previous events this you bought and 

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:30.060
 you got all correspond to randomly 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:32.160
 they bought mercenaries if you have a 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:35.449
 mercenary and with good is and background 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.449
 this red 

00:05:37.249 --> 00:05:43.089
 you get if you have trap with the raffle 

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:45.969
 and that other armor transfers it 

00:05:43.089 --> 00:05:49.639
 let's say a mercenary and have me 

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:51.860
 that this red background like this I can 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:54.229
 transfer to this sum and it 's your 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:55.849
 I already need a red background and only 

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:58.599
 it would be necessary to retain it until more 15 and 

00:05:55.849 --> 00:06:01.099
 then up to plus 20 and so we'll do that 

00:05:58.599 --> 00:06:04.459
 be an armor without having to spend 

00:06:01.099 --> 00:06:06.939
 gold necessarily gold without having to 

00:06:04.459 --> 00:06:06.939
 spend gold 

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:13.390
 and so we would no longer be gold and wait for 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:16.849
 refinery events 

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:19.189
 I do not have one with a background 

00:06:16.849 --> 00:06:21.409
 my inventories are empty I do not have 

00:06:19.189 --> 00:06:24.910
 nothing with a background, I have not taken advantage of that 

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:27.220
 event in this account because 

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:28.930
 I have taken advantage of them in other accounts and 

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:30.220
 those other accounts I'm going to pass this 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:32.350
 account 

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:37.380
 I'm going to extract the extra committees for that 

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:37.380
 this school the tickets in 15 

00:06:37.529 --> 00:06:43.720
 to be able to get it 

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:43.720
 well that was all 

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:49.140
 and I think in a previous video I told them 

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:52.050
 that they gave in each number 

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:54.420
 see my previous videos and they are going to 

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:57.620
 be able to realize that in that number 

00:06:54.420 --> 00:07:00.320
 It gives that things we say is granted this 

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:03.810
 then I'm like this I have a video 

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:05.850
 explanatory the previously already good 

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:07.620
 that was all and see you later until a 

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:11.280
 Next Opportunity 

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:13.400
 and see you in a next video up 

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:13.400
 then
