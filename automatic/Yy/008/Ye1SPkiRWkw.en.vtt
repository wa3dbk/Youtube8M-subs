 Rich Salvadoran ice cream 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.650
 the ingredients are 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:58.410
 the first thing we're going to start doing 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.410
 is to remove the shell of the yucca 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.600

 or not 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:44.290
 to grind the yucca I put a little bit of 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:47.880
 milk is easier to grind so that's 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.880
 I 'm also going to add the cheese 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:09.970

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.970
 Total add a cup of milk 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:18.550

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.550
