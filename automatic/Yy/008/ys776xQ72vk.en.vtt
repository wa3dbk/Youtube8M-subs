00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:30.080 
something fairly simple like you just
need<00:02:27.250> to<00:02:27.370> add<00:02:27.549> more<00:02:27.879> antifreeze<00:02:28.810> to<00:02:29.200> the<00:02:29.290> car

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
need to add more antifreeze to the car

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.600 
need to add more antifreeze to the car
but<00:02:31.090> in<00:02:31.390> any<00:02:31.510> event<00:02:31.769> you<00:02:32.769> need<00:02:32.950> to<00:02:34.049> pull<00:02:35.049> over

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
but in any event you need to pull over

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.740 
but in any event you need to pull over
let<00:02:36.610> the<00:02:36.790> car<00:02:37.000> cool<00:02:37.329> down<00:02:38.849> possibly<00:02:39.849> and<00:02:40.180> check

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
let the car cool down possibly and check

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.289 
let the car cool down possibly and check
to<00:02:41.709> see<00:02:41.920> if<00:02:41.950> you<00:02:42.250> need<00:02:42.400> to<00:02:42.519> add<00:02:42.640> some<00:02:42.670> water<00:02:43.120> or

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:43.299 
to see if you need to add some water or

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:49.890 
to see if you need to add some water or
some<00:02:43.599> antifreeze<00:02:43.870> to<00:02:44.319> it<00:02:45.720> and<00:02:48.269> don't<00:02:49.269> drive<00:02:49.660> it

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
some antifreeze to it and don't drive it

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.430 
some antifreeze to it and don't drive it
very<00:02:50.140> far<00:02:50.530> with<00:02:51.280> that<00:02:52.079> temperature<00:02:53.079> light<00:02:53.260> on

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
very far with that temperature light on

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.690 
very far with that temperature light on
the<00:02:54.250> next<00:02:55.230> light<00:02:56.230> would<00:02:56.709> be<00:02:56.890> that<00:02:57.280> you<00:02:57.400> really

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
the next light would be that you really

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.490 
the next light would be that you really
need<00:02:57.819> to<00:02:57.879> be<00:02:57.970> concerned<00:02:58.239> about<00:02:58.540> is<00:02:58.780> the<00:02:58.810> oil

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
need to be concerned about is the oil

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.720 
need to be concerned about is the oil
light<00:02:59.980> and<00:03:00.370> it<00:03:01.329> looks<00:03:01.540> sort<00:03:01.780> of<00:03:01.900> like<00:03:01.959> a<00:03:02.430> an<00:03:03.430> oil

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
light and it looks sort of like a an oil

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:09.050 
light and it looks sort of like a an oil
lamp<00:03:04.090> an<00:03:04.480> old<00:03:04.659> old<00:03:05.019> oil<00:03:05.440> lamp<00:03:05.799> and<00:03:07.140> if<00:03:08.140> you

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
lamp an old old oil lamp and if you

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.640 
lamp an old old oil lamp and if you
ignore<00:03:10.060> this<00:03:10.269> light<00:03:10.569> you<00:03:11.140> could<00:03:11.290> really

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
ignore this light you could really

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.479 
ignore this light you could really
damage<00:03:12.040> the<00:03:12.220> engine<00:03:12.810> the<00:03:13.859> car<00:03:14.859> engines<00:03:15.280> of

damage the engine the car engines of

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:19.620 
damage the engine the car engines of
today<00:03:15.819> are<00:03:16.120> not<00:03:17.079> intended<00:03:17.620> to<00:03:18.069> run<00:03:18.459> with<00:03:19.419> any

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
today are not intended to run with any

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.680 
today are not intended to run with any
less<00:03:19.900> than<00:03:20.260> three<00:03:20.620> quarts<00:03:21.010> and<00:03:21.940> when<00:03:22.269> you<00:03:22.389> fill

less than three quarts and when you fill

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.050 
less than three quarts and when you fill
them<00:03:22.870> they<00:03:23.650> usually<00:03:24.310> contain<00:03:24.639> about<00:03:24.819> five
