was they put da here with a review of
optimal<00:00:06.270> nutrition<00:00:06.529> creatine<00:00:07.529> powder<00:00:07.680> I'd<00:00:08.130> be

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
optimal nutrition creatine powder I'd be

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:09.680 
optimal nutrition creatine powder I'd be
using<00:00:08.490> creatine<00:00:08.790> for<00:00:09.120> about<00:00:09.269> a<00:00:09.300> year<00:00:09.540> now

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
using creatine for about a year now

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.419 
using creatine for about a year now
before<00:00:10.170> I<00:00:10.200> started<00:00:10.530> using<00:00:10.590> creatine<00:00:10.950> I

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
before I started using creatine I

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.879 
before I started using creatine I
thought<00:00:12.059> to<00:00:12.210> myself<00:00:12.360> you<00:00:12.719> know<00:00:12.840> this<00:00:13.049> it<00:00:13.349> can't

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
thought to myself you know this it can't

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:14.509 
thought to myself you know this it can't
be<00:00:13.980> true

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
be true

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.599 
be true
I<00:00:14.549> read<00:00:15.000> that<00:00:15.269> creatine<00:00:15.630> helps<00:00:16.529> you<00:00:16.740> achieve

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
I read that creatine helps you achieve

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.640 
I read that creatine helps you achieve
more<00:00:18.060> reps<00:00:18.330> in<00:00:18.539> other<00:00:18.720> words<00:00:18.900> if<00:00:19.170> you<00:00:19.380> can<00:00:19.529> only

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
more reps in other words if you can only

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.670 
more reps in other words if you can only
do<00:00:19.949> eight<00:00:20.550> reps<00:00:20.609> of<00:00:21.300> benchpress<00:00:21.660> if<00:00:22.080> you<00:00:22.199> drink

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
do eight reps of benchpress if you drink

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.590 
do eight reps of benchpress if you drink
creatine<00:00:22.949> you<00:00:23.369> take<00:00:23.580> creatine<00:00:23.760> you<00:00:24.449> may

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
creatine you take creatine you may

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.870 
creatine you take creatine you may
actually<00:00:24.810> move<00:00:25.260> up<00:00:25.410> nine<00:00:25.830> to<00:00:26.279> nine<00:00:26.490> or<00:00:26.699> ten

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
actually move up nine to nine or ten

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.310 
actually move up nine to nine or ten
reps<00:00:27.119> so<00:00:27.449> I<00:00:27.480> said<00:00:27.660> there's<00:00:27.779> no<00:00:27.960> way<00:00:28.140> the

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
reps so I said there's no way the

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.320 
reps so I said there's no way the
creatine<00:00:28.680> does<00:00:28.740> what<00:00:29.340> people<00:00:29.730> said<00:00:29.939> creatine

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
creatine does what people said creatine

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.749 
creatine does what people said creatine
does<00:00:30.359> yeah<00:00:31.380> but<00:00:31.769> moving<00:00:32.009> forward<00:00:32.340> I<00:00:32.399> decided

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
does yeah but moving forward I decided

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.000 
does yeah but moving forward I decided
to<00:00:33.000> give<00:00:33.270> up<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.719> nutrition<00:00:34.110> creatine<00:00:34.800> powder

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
to give up the nutrition creatine powder

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.639 
to give up the nutrition creatine powder
a<00:00:35.309> try<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:35.910> here's<00:00:36.570> my<00:00:36.690> results<00:00:37.050> in<00:00:37.170> my<00:00:37.350> review

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
a try and here's my results in my review

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.350 
a try and here's my results in my review
first<00:00:38.010> of<00:00:38.250> all<00:00:38.370> you<00:00:38.489> teenybopper<00:00:39.000> should<00:00:39.180> know

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
first of all you teenybopper should know

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.560 
first of all you teenybopper should know
that<00:00:39.600> creatine<00:00:40.040> actually<00:00:41.040> works<00:00:41.250> it<00:00:42.059> works

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
that creatine actually works it works

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.750 
that creatine actually works it works
now<00:00:43.079> a<00:00:43.110> creatine<00:00:43.410> does<00:00:43.800> is<00:00:44.010> essentially<00:00:44.399> lets

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
now a creatine does is essentially lets

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.630 
now a creatine does is essentially lets
you<00:00:45.000> retain<00:00:45.570> more<00:00:45.840> water<00:00:45.899> weight<00:00:46.710> so<00:00:47.309> if<00:00:47.460> your

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
you retain more water weight so if your

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.850 
you retain more water weight so if your
muscles<00:00:48.149> have<00:00:48.660> more<00:00:49.020> water<00:00:49.230> in<00:00:49.559> them

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
muscles have more water in them

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.310 
muscles have more water in them
theoretically<00:00:50.760> speaking<00:00:51.059> you<00:00:51.989> will<00:00:52.230> achieve

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
theoretically speaking you will achieve

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.650 
theoretically speaking you will achieve
higher<00:00:52.920> reps<00:00:53.309> in<00:00:53.730> other<00:00:53.879> words<00:00:54.149> you<00:00:54.329> will<00:00:54.539> move

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
higher reps in other words you will move

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.630 
higher reps in other words you will move
up<00:00:54.899> in<00:00:55.050> reps<00:00:55.289> now<00:00:55.559> there's<00:00:55.739> a<00:00:55.800> lot<00:00:55.920> of<00:00:56.010> BS<00:00:56.219> going

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
up in reps now there's a lot of BS going

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.160 
up in reps now there's a lot of BS going
around<00:00:56.879> in<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.120> internet<00:00:57.629> says<00:00:57.840> you<00:00:57.989> gotta

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
around in the internet says you gotta

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.680 
around in the internet says you gotta
take<00:00:58.440> creatine<00:00:58.890> with<00:00:59.370> apple<00:01:00.030> juice<00:01:00.270> or<00:01:00.480> grape

thing about creatine is that you do not

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.219 
thing about creatine is that you do not
feel<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.030> results<00:01:24.420> right<00:01:24.600> away<00:01:24.869> it<00:01:25.080> takes
