it at night time you throw on the mask

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.720 
it at night time you throw on the mask
and<00:03:28.420> it's<00:03:28.510> like<00:03:28.690> heavy<00:03:29.019> but<00:03:29.320> not<00:03:29.470> thick<00:03:29.800> these

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
little bit too dark for me unless I

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.320

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:20.360 
think right over your brush if your

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:23.290 
think right over your brush if your
blush<00:04:20.570> looks<00:04:20.870> slightly<00:04:21.560> patchy<00:04:22.040> or<00:04:22.640> you<00:04:23.270> just

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
blush looks slightly patchy or you just

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.660 
blush looks slightly patchy or you just
want<00:04:23.600> to<00:04:23.660> soften<00:04:23.900> things<00:04:24.140> up<00:04:24.590> it<00:04:25.220> just<00:04:25.490> looks

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:25.670 
want to soften things up it just looks

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:27.550 
want to soften things up it just looks
so<00:04:25.850> good<00:04:26.060> it<00:04:26.270> just<00:04:26.390> diffuses<00:04:26.870> everything<00:04:27.410> out

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
so good it just diffuses everything out

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.830 
so good it just diffuses everything out
as<00:04:27.770> ambient<00:04:28.310> light<00:04:28.460> would<00:04:28.640> suggest<00:04:28.910> but<00:04:29.720> it's

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
as ambient light would suggest but it's

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.390

pigmented coverage I love it around the

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:02.230 
pigmented coverage I love it around the
nose<00:04:59.570> especially<00:05:00.440> lip<00:05:01.130> swatches<00:05:01.460> or<00:05:02.060> if

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
nose especially lip swatches or if

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.050 
nose especially lip swatches or if
you're<00:05:02.450> a<00:05:02.480> little<00:05:02.780> bit<00:05:02.990> messy<00:05:03.410> around<00:05:03.620> here

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060

you're a little bit messy around here
just<00:05:05.060> kind<00:05:05.630> of<00:05:05.720> on<00:05:06.350> the<00:05:06.410> edges<00:05:06.920> of<00:05:06.950> your<00:05:07.130> lips

it's<00:05:09.080> perfect<00:05:09.440> for<00:05:09.770> that<00:05:10.010> so<00:05:10.250> it<00:05:10.340> gives<00:05:10.490> enough

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
it's perfect for that so it gives enough

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:13.270 
it's perfect for that so it gives enough
coverage<00:05:11.630> but<00:05:11.870> it's<00:05:12.020> not<00:05:12.200> heavy<00:05:12.500> at<00:05:12.800> all<00:05:12.830> if

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:13.280 
coverage but it's not heavy at all if

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:14.920 
coverage but it's not heavy at all if
you<00:05:13.640> use<00:05:13.790> a<00:05:13.820> brush<00:05:14.120> you<00:05:14.330> get<00:05:14.450> a<00:05:14.480> light<00:05:14.720> dusting

you use a brush you get a light dusting

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:16.690 
you use a brush you get a light dusting
and<00:05:15.410> it's<00:05:15.560> mineralized<00:05:16.070> so<00:05:16.340> it<00:05:16.400> just<00:05:16.550> gives

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:16.700 
and it's mineralized so it just gives

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.150

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:35.030 
Hansen this one is actually probably a

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:37.570 
Hansen this one is actually probably a
little<00:05:35.180> over<00:05:35.600> priced<00:05:35.870> at<00:05:36.320> the<00:05:36.530> drugstore<00:05:36.770> but

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:37.580 
little over priced at the drugstore but

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.100 
little over priced at the drugstore but
I<00:05:37.640> wanted<00:05:37.880> to<00:05:37.940> give<00:05:38.180> it<00:05:38.210> a<00:05:38.300> go<00:05:38.450> and<00:05:38.600> I<00:05:38.690> do<00:05:38.750> like

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.110 
I wanted to give it a go and I do like

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.470 
I wanted to give it a go and I do like
it<00:05:39.380> the<00:05:39.590> brush<00:05:39.740> is<00:05:39.770> quite<00:05:40.190> thin<00:05:40.550> and<00:05:40.580> long<00:05:41.030> so

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:41.480 
it the brush is quite thin and long so

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:42.940 
it the brush is quite thin and long so
it's<00:05:41.630> good<00:05:41.780> for<00:05:41.930> someone<00:05:42.110> with<00:05:42.350> narrow<00:05:42.650> nail

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:42.950

beds<00:05:43.190> I<00:05:43.460> think<00:05:43.880> it<00:05:43.940> works<00:05:44.090> fine<00:05:44.360> for<00:05:44.420> me

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:44.720 
beds I think it works fine for me

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.220 
beds I think it works fine for me
because<00:05:45.230> you<00:05:45.620> just<00:05:46.520> do<00:05:47.360> a<00:05:47.390> few<00:05:47.660> more<00:05:47.840> swipes

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:48.230 
because you just do a few more swipes

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:50.260 
because you just do a few more swipes
but<00:05:48.530> it's<00:05:48.680> not<00:05:48.860> unmanageable<00:05:49.310> by<00:05:49.850> any<00:05:50.030> means

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:50.270 
but it's not unmanageable by any means

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:52.840 
but it's not unmanageable by any means
but<00:05:50.720> it<00:05:50.870> does<00:05:50.900> dry<00:05:51.260> very<00:05:51.740> very<00:05:52.070> quickly<00:05:52.460> which

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:52.850 
but it does dry very very quickly which

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:55.060 
but it does dry very very quickly which
I<00:05:53.000> really<00:05:53.210> love<00:05:53.480> so<00:05:53.870> I<00:05:54.080> pulled<00:05:54.590> this<00:05:54.710> out<00:05:54.890> when
