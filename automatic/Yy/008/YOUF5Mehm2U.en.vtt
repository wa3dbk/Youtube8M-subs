with<00:00:11.699> muting<00:00:12.119> the<00:00:12.150> strings<00:00:12.270> and<00:00:12.809> I<00:00:13.139> know

00:00:13.189 --> 00:00:13.199 
with muting the strings and I know

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:15.859 
with muting the strings and I know
exactly<00:00:13.740> what<00:00:14.430> most<00:00:15.090> players<00:00:15.209> when<00:00:15.480> they<00:00:15.629> and

exactly what most players when they and
I<00:00:15.930> was<00:00:16.049> one<00:00:16.199> of<00:00:16.320> them<00:00:16.410> when<00:00:16.680> you<00:00:16.710> first<00:00:17.010> start

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
I was one of them when you first start

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.280 
I was one of them when you first start
playing<00:00:17.279> you're<00:00:17.970> plucking<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.390> string<00:00:18.660> let's

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:19.290 
playing you're plucking the string let's

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.050 
playing you're plucking the string let's
say<00:00:19.380> you're<00:00:19.530> trying<00:00:19.860> to<00:00:19.920> play<00:00:20.040> a<00:00:20.070> scale<00:00:20.250> and

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
say you're trying to play a scale and

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.390 
say you're trying to play a scale and
you<00:00:21.660> pluck<00:00:22.020> with<00:00:22.200> your<00:00:22.410> like<00:00:22.950> in<00:00:23.070> a<00:00:23.130> certain

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
you pluck with your like in a certain

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.740 
you pluck with your like in a certain
way<00:00:23.490> where<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:23.760> string<00:00:24.000> rings<00:00:24.270> and<00:00:24.600> then<00:00:24.690> you

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
way where the string rings and then you

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.270 
way where the string rings and then you
go<00:00:24.840> to<00:00:24.900> play<00:00:25.080> another<00:00:25.320> note<00:00:25.410> and<00:00:25.740> they<00:00:25.980> blend

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:26.280 
go to play another note and they blend

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.860 
go to play another note and they blend
together<00:00:26.400> and<00:00:27.000> you<00:00:27.150> have<00:00:27.240> to<00:00:27.390> practice

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:27.870 
together and you have to practice

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:30.109 
together and you have to practice
several<00:00:28.140> ways<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:28.410> get<00:00:28.830> that<00:00:28.980> first<00:00:29.280> note<00:00:29.490> most

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
several ways to get that first note most

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.520 
several ways to get that first note most
of<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.300> time<00:00:30.450> to<00:00:30.630> stop<00:00:30.869> so<00:00:31.140> each<00:00:31.289> notes

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:31.530 
of the time to stop so each notes

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:33.110 
of the time to stop so each notes
individual<00:00:32.160> and<00:00:32.610> this<00:00:32.699> is<00:00:32.789> a<00:00:32.850> really

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
individual and this is a really

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.490 
individual and this is a really
prevalent<00:00:33.300> on<00:00:33.570> open<00:00:33.960> strings<00:00:34.199> because<00:00:34.350> you

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
prevalent on open strings because you

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.020 
prevalent on open strings because you
don't<00:00:34.650> have<00:00:34.770> any<00:00:34.950> left<00:00:35.190> hand<00:00:35.400> control<00:00:35.760> so<00:00:35.970> I'm

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
don't have any left hand control so I'm

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.160 
don't have any left hand control so I'm
gonna<00:00:36.120> show<00:00:36.239> you<00:00:36.300> a<00:00:36.420> couple<00:00:36.660> different<00:00:36.900> ways

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
gonna show you a couple different ways

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.710 
gonna show you a couple different ways
you<00:00:37.230> can<00:00:37.530> mute<00:00:37.650> strings<00:00:38.180> and<00:00:39.180> you<00:00:39.300> can<00:00:39.480> find

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:39.720 
you can mute strings and you can find

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.270 
you can mute strings and you can find
which<00:00:40.170> one<00:00:40.380> works<00:00:40.590> best<00:00:40.829> for<00:00:40.920> which<00:00:41.130> situation

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
which one works best for which situation

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.280 
which one works best for which situation
initially<00:00:42.270> let's<00:00:42.660> talk<00:00:42.810> about<00:00:42.930> your<00:00:43.110> right

initially let's talk about your right
hand<00:00:43.530> plucking<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.280> I<00:00:45.090> apologize<00:00:45.899> if<00:00:46.020> the

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
hand plucking and I apologize if the

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.590 
hand plucking and I apologize if the
camera<00:00:46.440> angles<00:00:46.680> not<00:00:46.800> ideal<00:00:47.160> but<00:00:47.970> a<00:00:48.210> lot<00:00:48.570> of

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
camera angles not ideal but a lot of

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.910 
camera angles not ideal but a lot of
guys<00:00:48.750> when<00:00:48.930> they<00:00:49.020> first<00:00:49.260> start<00:00:49.470> playing<00:00:49.500> they

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
guys when they first start playing they

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
they are afraid of touching the next

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.130 
they are afraid of touching the next
string<00:00:53.790> but<00:00:54.270> really<00:00:54.630> when<00:00:54.809> you're<00:00:54.930> playing

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140

with your fingers one things you want to
do<00:00:56.850> is<00:00:57.090> if<00:00:57.300> I'm<00:00:57.420> playing<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.780> g-string<00:00:58.230> I

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
do is if I'm playing the g-string I

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.100 
do is if I'm playing the g-string I
stroke<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.250> string<00:00:59.550> that<00:00:59.730> I<00:00:59.790> let<00:01:00.059> my<00:01:00.750> finger

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.110 
stroke the string that I let my finger

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.170 
stroke the string that I let my finger
touch<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.770> D<00:01:01.920> string<00:01:02.129> that<00:01:02.670> keeps<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.030> D

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
touch the D string that keeps the D

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.749 
touch the D string that keeps the D
string<00:01:03.390> quiet<00:01:03.750> from<00:01:04.229> rumbling<00:01:04.649> and<00:01:05.309> making

00:01:05.749 --> 00:01:05.759 
string quiet from rumbling and making

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:08.539 
string quiet from rumbling and making
noise<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.929> I<00:01:07.109> and<00:01:07.770> that's<00:01:08.039> really<00:01:08.219> I<00:01:08.490> think

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
noise and I and that's really I think

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:09.889 
noise and I and that's really I think
preferred<00:01:09.060> let's<00:01:09.270> say<00:01:09.359> if<00:01:09.450> I'm<00:01:09.569> playing<00:01:09.719> the<00:01:09.869> a

00:01:09.889 --> 00:01:09.899 
preferred let's say if I'm playing the a

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:12.830 
preferred let's say if I'm playing the a
string<00:01:10.380> instead<00:01:11.100> of<00:01:11.159> hooking<00:01:11.399> it<00:01:11.759> where<00:01:12.569> the

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
string instead of hooking it where the

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.480 
string instead of hooking it where the
string<00:01:13.109> you<00:01:13.319> can<00:01:13.350> ring<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:13.979> I<00:01:14.009> might<00:01:14.159> hit<00:01:14.340> this

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
string you can ring and I might hit this

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.919 
string you can ring and I might hit this
string<00:01:14.729> accidentally<00:01:15.149> I<00:01:15.329> just<00:01:15.630> go<00:01:15.719> ahead<00:01:15.780> and

00:01:15.919 --> 00:01:15.929 
string accidentally I just go ahead and

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:18.230 
string accidentally I just go ahead and
pluck<00:01:16.109> through<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:16.950> stop<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.579> e<00:01:17.609> string<00:01:18.029> from

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
pluck through and stop the e string from

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.389 
pluck through and stop the e string from
just<00:01:18.479> even<00:01:18.779> synthetically<00:01:19.499> vibrating<00:01:20.100> so

00:01:20.389 --> 00:01:20.399 
just even synthetically vibrating so

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:22.370 
just even synthetically vibrating so
that's<00:01:20.549> one<00:01:20.880> way<00:01:21.060> is<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.689> look<00:01:21.959> if<00:01:22.109> your<00:01:22.259> right

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
that's one way is to look if your right

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.919 
that's one way is to look if your right
hand<00:01:22.649> is<00:01:22.979> going<00:01:23.579> you<00:01:23.969> know<00:01:23.999> is<00:01:24.270> passing

00:01:24.919 --> 00:01:24.929 
hand is going you know is passing

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:26.239 
hand is going you know is passing
through<00:01:25.109> the<00:01:25.259> string<00:01:25.499> and<00:01:25.649> touching<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.039> next

00:01:26.239 --> 00:01:26.249 
through the string and touching the next

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:28.010 
through the string and touching the next
string<00:01:26.429> that's<00:01:26.639> actually<00:01:26.999> I<00:01:27.179> think<00:01:27.539> preferred

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
string that's actually I think preferred

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.109

one<00:02:11.910> way<00:02:12.060> is<00:02:12.180> if<00:02:12.270> I<00:02:12.330> play<00:02:12.570> a<00:02:12.600> note<00:02:12.630> and<00:02:13.050> I<00:02:13.230> want

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
one way is if I play a note and I want

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.220 
one way is if I play a note and I want
it<00:02:13.500> to<00:02:13.620> stop

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
it to stop

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.410 
it to stop
I<00:02:14.290> can<00:02:14.650> just<00:02:14.769> release<00:02:15.370> the<00:02:15.489> pressure<00:02:15.670> as<00:02:16.209> soon

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
I can just release the pressure as soon

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:17.880 
I can just release the pressure as soon
as<00:02:16.510> I<00:02:16.569> know<00:02:16.750> I<00:02:16.780> don't<00:02:16.900> want<00:02:17.110> to<00:02:17.170> get<00:02:17.319> my<00:02:17.650> thumb

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
as I know I don't want to get my thumb

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.740 
as I know I don't want to get my thumb
on<00:02:17.920> or<00:02:18.190> my<00:02:18.370> finger<00:02:18.670> off<00:02:18.849> because<00:02:19.330> it<00:02:19.480> actually

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
on or my finger off because it actually

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.140 
on or my finger off because it actually
sounds<00:02:20.170> another's<00:02:20.500> note<00:02:20.799> or<00:02:21.250> noise<00:02:21.790> actually

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
sounds another's note or noise actually

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.820 
sounds another's note or noise actually
but<00:02:22.720> I'll<00:02:22.840> just<00:02:23.230> release<00:02:23.500> the<00:02:23.650> pressure

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
but I'll just release the pressure

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.729 
but I'll just release the pressure
enough<00:02:24.810> that<00:02:25.810> it<00:02:25.930> stops<00:02:26.140> the<00:02:26.290> noise<00:02:26.319> from

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
enough that it stops the noise from

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:28.890 
enough that it stops the noise from
happening<00:02:27.099> the<00:02:27.220> sound<00:02:27.430> from<00:02:27.640> happening<00:02:27.909> so

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
happening the sound from happening so

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.210 
happening the sound from happening so
that's<00:02:29.080> one<00:02:29.319> way<00:02:29.500> as<00:02:29.650> you're<00:02:29.799> playing<00:02:30.040> you

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
that's one way as you're playing you

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.190 
that's one way as you're playing you
might<00:02:30.370> want<00:02:30.549> to<00:02:30.580> practice<00:02:30.790> like<00:02:31.599> holding<00:02:32.140> the

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
might want to practice like holding the

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.140 
might want to practice like holding the
sustain<00:02:32.650> though<00:02:32.950> and<00:02:33.280> then<00:02:33.370> releasing<00:02:33.849> or

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
sustain though and then releasing or

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.780 
sustain though and then releasing or
doing<00:02:34.569> sure<00:02:35.280> where<00:02:36.280> you<00:02:36.370> actually<00:02:36.489> kind<00:02:36.760> of

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
doing sure where you actually kind of

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.390 
doing sure where you actually kind of
flexing<00:02:37.180> your<00:02:37.299> hand<00:02:37.540> on<00:02:37.720> the<00:02:37.810> fingerboard<00:02:38.400> the

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
flexing your hand on the fingerboard the

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.770 
flexing your hand on the fingerboard the
other<00:02:39.519> thing<00:02:39.610> I<00:02:39.700> like<00:02:39.819> to<00:02:39.970> do<00:02:40.090> is<00:02:40.329> on<00:02:40.510> playing

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
other thing I like to do is on playing

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.539

flat of my pad on the note I'm sounding
but<00:02:51.459> push<00:02:51.730> my<00:02:51.910> fingertip<00:02:52.450> into<00:02:52.660> the<00:02:52.750> next

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
but push my fingertip into the next

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:54.330 
but push my fingertip into the next
string<00:02:53.170> then<00:02:53.859> it<00:02:53.980> doesn't<00:02:54.250> really

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
string then it doesn't really

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.069 
string then it doesn't really
sympathetically<00:02:55.209> vibrate<00:02:55.660> I<00:02:55.780> mean<00:02:55.959> if<00:02:56.019> you

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:56.079 
sympathetically vibrate I mean if you

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:57.900 
sympathetically vibrate I mean if you
pluck<00:02:56.290> on<00:02:56.470> it<00:02:56.590> you'll<00:02:56.680> get<00:02:56.769> a<00:02:56.829> noise<00:02:57.040> but<00:02:57.430> it's

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
pluck on it you'll get a noise but it's

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.839 
pluck on it you'll get a noise but it's
pretty<00:02:58.060> quiet<00:02:59.220> you<00:03:00.220> know<00:03:00.280> there's<00:03:00.489> other<00:03:00.609> ways

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:00.849 
pretty quiet you know there's other ways

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:02.250 
pretty quiet you know there's other ways
to<00:03:00.910> do<00:03:01.299> meat<00:03:01.510> strings<00:03:01.840> and<00:03:02.019> it's<00:03:02.109> all

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
to do meat strings and it's all

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.440 
to do meat strings and it's all
dependent<00:03:02.709> on<00:03:02.799> when<00:03:03.519> the<00:03:03.970> strings<00:03:04.299> are

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
dependent on when the strings are

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.720 
dependent on when the strings are
getting<00:03:05.410> in<00:03:05.500> your<00:03:05.590> way<00:03:05.650> when<00:03:06.280> the<00:03:06.370> notes<00:03:06.549> are

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
getting in your way when the notes are

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.119 
getting in your way when the notes are
like<00:03:06.879> bleh<00:03:07.359> bleeding<00:03:07.870> through<00:03:08.129> sometimes

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:09.129 
like bleh bleeding through sometimes

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:10.949 
like bleh bleeding through sometimes
I'll<00:03:09.280> let<00:03:09.400> my<00:03:09.519> finger<00:03:09.879> decide<00:03:10.480> on<00:03:10.599> my<00:03:10.660> finger

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
I'll let my finger decide on my finger

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:13.050 
I'll let my finger decide on my finger
rest<00:03:11.230> on<00:03:11.560> all<00:03:12.190> the<00:03:12.340> strings<00:03:12.579> so<00:03:12.700> that<00:03:12.819> even<00:03:12.910> if

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
rest on all the strings so that even if

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.250 
rest on all the strings so that even if
I'm<00:03:13.150> like<00:03:13.359> playing<00:03:13.510> on<00:03:13.629> the<00:03:13.780> G<00:03:13.989> on<00:03:14.019> the<00:03:14.230> E

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
I'm like playing on the G on the E

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.839 
I'm like playing on the G on the E
string<00:03:14.349> you<00:03:14.980> notice<00:03:15.160> this<00:03:15.250> step<00:03:15.430> coming<00:03:15.670> down

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:15.849 
string you notice this step coming down

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:18.000 
string you notice this step coming down
with<00:03:16.030> perfect<00:03:16.480> classical<00:03:16.900> technique<00:03:17.230> if<00:03:17.440> I

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
with perfect classical technique if I

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.680 
with perfect classical technique if I
just<00:03:18.370> may<00:03:18.489> be<00:03:18.549> played<00:03:18.849> upper<00:03:19.180> strings<00:03:19.510> that

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
just may be played upper strings that

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.839 
just may be played upper strings that
are<00:03:19.769> still<00:03:20.769> ringing<00:03:21.010> I'll<00:03:21.250> just<00:03:21.430> lower<00:03:21.700> my

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:21.849 
are still ringing I'll just lower my

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:24.360 
are still ringing I'll just lower my
finger<00:03:22.419> down<00:03:22.599> so<00:03:23.380> that<00:03:23.560> it<00:03:23.739> actually<00:03:24.160> touches

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
finger down so that it actually touches

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.280 
finger down so that it actually touches
and<00:03:24.730> I<00:03:24.790> can't<00:03:25.150> really<00:03:25.239> see<00:03:25.450> that<00:03:25.630> but<00:03:25.840> I'll

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
and I can't really see that but I'll

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.349 
and I can't really see that but I'll
lower<00:03:26.470> my<00:03:26.590> finger<00:03:27.069> down<00:03:27.250> so<00:03:27.579> it<00:03:27.700> rests<00:03:28.030> on<00:03:28.209> all

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:28.359 
lower my finger down so it rests on all

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:29.940 
lower my finger down so it rests on all
the<00:03:28.480> strings<00:03:28.780> that'll<00:03:29.230> keep<00:03:29.349> those<00:03:29.620> strings

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
the strings that'll keep those strings

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.670 
the strings that'll keep those strings
quiet<00:03:30.389> um<00:03:31.389> you<00:03:31.959> know<00:03:32.049> it's<00:03:32.230> really<00:03:32.470> impossible

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
quiet um you know it's really impossible

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.650 
quiet um you know it's really impossible
for<00:03:33.069> me<00:03:33.130> to<00:03:33.160> like<00:03:33.400> give<00:03:33.609> you<00:03:33.700> techniques<00:03:33.940> for

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
for me to like give you techniques for

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.240 
for me to like give you techniques for
every<00:03:35.079> possible<00:03:35.530> opportunity<00:03:35.799> that<00:03:36.190> you

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
every possible opportunity that you

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.360 
every possible opportunity that you
could<00:03:36.400> have<00:03:36.579> some<00:03:36.790> noisy<00:03:37.120> strings<00:03:37.799> or<00:03:38.799> notes

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
could have some noisy strings or notes

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:40.680 
could have some noisy strings or notes
ringing<00:03:39.790> through<00:03:39.970> when<00:03:40.150> you<00:03:40.209> want<00:03:40.389> to<00:03:40.480> silence

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
ringing through when you want to silence

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.809 
ringing through when you want to silence
so<00:03:41.410> you<00:03:41.470> can<00:03:41.739> actually<00:03:42.099> detective<00:03:42.639> this

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:42.819 
so you can actually detective this

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:44.729 
so you can actually detective this
yourself<00:03:43.299> and<00:03:43.540> kind<00:03:43.720> of<00:03:43.840> you<00:03:44.169> know<00:03:44.260> put<00:03:44.650> on

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
yourself and kind of you know put on

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:46.170 
yourself and kind of you know put on
your<00:03:44.919> sleuthing<00:03:45.160> hat<00:03:45.489> and<00:03:45.639> figure<00:03:45.880> this<00:03:46.000> out

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
your sleuthing hat and figure this out

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:47.970 
your sleuthing hat and figure this out
yourself<00:03:46.540> let's<00:03:47.079> say<00:03:47.200> it's<00:03:47.410> a<00:03:47.470> bass<00:03:47.620> line<00:03:47.769> from

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
yourself let's say it's a bass line from

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.860 
yourself let's say it's a bass line from
a<00:03:48.130> song<00:03:48.340> and<00:03:48.609> two<00:03:48.940> of<00:03:49.000> the<00:03:49.120> notes<00:03:49.299> are<00:03:49.480> bleeding

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
a song and two of the notes are bleeding

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.870 
a song and two of the notes are bleeding
you<00:03:50.380> can<00:03:50.410> actually<00:03:50.709> just<00:03:50.980> slow<00:03:51.310> it<00:03:51.340> down<00:03:51.489> and

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 
you can actually just slow it down and

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.640 
you can actually just slow it down and
find<00:03:52.150> the<00:03:52.269> mechanic<00:03:52.870> that's<00:03:53.049> leaving<00:03:53.290> that

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
find the mechanic that's leaving that

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.280 
find the mechanic that's leaving that
that<00:03:54.010> note<00:03:54.310> that<00:03:54.519> you<00:03:54.609> want<00:03:54.819> quiet<00:03:55.290> what's

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
that note that you want quiet what's

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:57.990 
that note that you want quiet what's
absent<00:03:56.799> why<00:03:56.919> is<00:03:56.980> it<00:03:57.190> still<00:03:57.430> ringing<00:03:57.669> now

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
absent why is it still ringing now

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.789 
absent why is it still ringing now
sometimes<00:03:58.450> you<00:03:58.569> can<00:03:58.720> mute<00:03:58.840> it<00:03:59.019> with<00:03:59.530> your

00:03:59.789 --> 00:03:59.799 
sometimes you can mute it with your

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:01.800 
sometimes you can mute it with your
right<00:04:00.310> hand<00:04:00.489> by<00:04:00.760> like<00:04:01.120> I<00:04:01.269> talked<00:04:01.480> about<00:04:01.569> by

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
right hand by like I talked about by

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.240 
right hand by like I talked about by
plucking<00:04:02.169> through<00:04:02.410> the<00:04:02.590> string<00:04:02.829> and<00:04:02.980> hitting

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
plucking through the string and hitting

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:04.860 
plucking through the string and hitting
the<00:04:03.370> next<00:04:03.519> string<00:04:03.790> sometimes<00:04:04.329> you<00:04:04.599> can<00:04:04.750> mute

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
the next string sometimes you can mute

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.409 
the next string sometimes you can mute
it<00:04:05.079> by<00:04:05.260> even<00:04:06.250> if<00:04:06.280> I'm<00:04:06.459> like<00:04:06.730> fretting<00:04:07.209> with<00:04:07.299> my

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:07.419 
it by even if I'm like fretting with my

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:08.940 
it by even if I'm like fretting with my
index<00:04:07.690> finger<00:04:07.959> and<00:04:08.379> I<00:04:08.440> don't<00:04:08.500> want<00:04:08.709> to<00:04:08.739> quiet

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
index finger and I don't want to quiet

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:10.110 
index finger and I don't want to quiet
these<00:04:09.129> notes<00:04:09.310> I'm<00:04:09.459> like<00:04:09.579> you<00:04:09.700> might<00:04:09.849> seem<00:04:10.030> to

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
these notes I'm like you might seem to

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.970 
these notes I'm like you might seem to
lower<00:04:10.359> my<00:04:10.569> pinky<00:04:10.959> down<00:04:11.109> to<00:04:11.319> quiet<00:04:11.560> the<00:04:11.709> D<00:04:11.859> and

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980 
lower my pinky down to quiet the D and

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:13.920 
lower my pinky down to quiet the D and
the<00:04:12.040> g<00:04:12.220> string<00:04:12.489> and<00:04:12.790> I'm<00:04:13.030> just<00:04:13.329> muting<00:04:13.840> them

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
the g string and I'm just muting them

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:15.210 
the g string and I'm just muting them
now<00:04:14.079> I'm<00:04:14.139> not<00:04:14.290> pushing<00:04:14.530> hard<00:04:14.769> enough<00:04:14.919> to<00:04:15.099> make

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
now I'm not pushing hard enough to make

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.969 
now I'm not pushing hard enough to make
a<00:04:15.250> sound<00:04:15.579> or<00:04:15.730> anything<00:04:16.139> so<00:04:17.139> you're<00:04:17.680> gonna<00:04:17.799> have

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:17.979 
a sound or anything so you're gonna have
