00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.099 
it's easier when you find a sunscreen
that's<00:01:46.770> already<00:01:46.950> in<00:01:47.189> your<00:01:47.219> moisturizer<00:01:48.109> so

00:01:50.269 --> 00:01:50.279 
that way you're kind of forced to put it

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:52.190 
that way you're kind of forced to put it
on<00:01:50.369> every<00:01:50.670> day<00:01:50.850> but<00:01:50.909> if<00:01:51.329> you<00:01:51.450> don't<00:01:51.689> have<00:01:51.929> that
