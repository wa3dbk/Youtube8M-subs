00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:09.880
 the earth is only seemingly one 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:11.620
 peaceful place actually becomes 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.599
 worldwide with the trade of light weight 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:17.099
 weapons and heavy military equipment more 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:17.099
 money earned as ever 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.310
 modern soldiers face the biggest 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:29.820
 military challenges 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.820
 history 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.510
 I 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.460
 The international arms trade is one 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.989
 lucrative business for a long time 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.449
 not only in government hands 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.489
 lies illegal weapons dealers 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:49.589
 unscrupulously make their profits over morals and 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.269
 human rights and thus heat the 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:52.260
 violent conflict resolution often 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:54.440
 intentionally 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.940
 in civil war in former Yugoslavia 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.100
 many probably over 100,000 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.799
 civilians through the use of weapons 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.600
 for military purposes victim of the 

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:11.159
 conventional war itself he has in 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:12.840
 these months combattant state and in 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.369
 for example, in bosnia 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.750
 go back it's just that stop 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.280
 not competent so she speaks the 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.679
 targeted population 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.819
 Children are drawn older 

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:23.009
 people really stop that 

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:25.140
 population layer there to thin out 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.830
 hold the sovereignty over these areas 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.929
 to reach 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.100
 that makes the civil war so extreme 

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:31.100
 mean and cruel 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.740
 the extent of destruction civilian 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.600
 facilities through the use of 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.420
 is an illegal traded war machine 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.950
 also the intentional 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.110
 crime at the unarmed 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.920
 civilian population indirectly go to that 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:50.570
 account of the arms dealers and thus lies 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.200
 so also the jurisdiction always 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.200
 becomes a criminal 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:01.820
 not tanks and bombs are the 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.820
 most effective killer in modern wars 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.780
 but lighter handguns 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.270
 fast-firing rifles and mobile 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.860
 weapon systems between constantly 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.660
 changing fronts dip the 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.610
 unscrupulous arms dealer sent 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.989
 submerge and often elude for years 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.989
 international jurisdiction 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.069
 the so-called outlaws you of course 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:26.549
 villages and draw a will to destroy 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:28.049
 behind it and that's up to you 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:29.750
 not the long the 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:32.700
 legitimacy and it is definite 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.689
 really criminal i do not think that 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:39.120
 there really is still an honor in the body 

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:40.859
 you should certainly have one 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.760
 Of course, this kind of criminal on 

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:44.819
 hunt every case 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.680
 it's just the thing you hunt one 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:49.769
 ghost 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:51.569
 these people perpetrate this crime 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:52.950
 yes have a protective shield and safe to 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:54.870
 their patrols are hiding 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.819
 very good and a country complete 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.590
 someone is destroying it 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:00.739
 takes a lot of time and a lot 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.739
 patience 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.739
 because in this hunting are the soldiers 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:06.720

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:09.319
 strategically and tactically often equal 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.319

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:20.370
 locate enemies 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:23.750
 turn off the guard 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.750
 eliminate hidden 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:33.170
 medal of honor now in threw

 trade
