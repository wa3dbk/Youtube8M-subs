00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:18.910
 hi guys today we're going to see various 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:22.300
 methods on how to penn your hands for the 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:24.640
 bandage for this flap and we put it 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.619
 inside the thumb 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:32.469
 we begin to do three laps around the bus 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:36.460
 in this way as later 

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:38.949
 we go up to the meetup and do others 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:43.139
 three laps tightening enough for 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:43.139
 cleaning it human like this inclination 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:51.459
 then always on the back of the hand 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:55.799
 we go down to hicks are another ride on 

00:00:51.459 --> 00:00:58.359
 wrist and we're going to block sells 

00:00:55.799 --> 00:01:00.609
 on the whole of the habitat and leaving 

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:05.320
 from the average index never annular and cancels 

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:07.660
 net we can do another round 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:15.420
 on the knuckles after passing through the 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:15.420
 first integer then better to flatter 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:20.820
 fine but not rimini 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:27.600
 all this we can turn from this 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:28.680
 part let's go back hicks ea 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.580
 will 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:35.130
 let's go block the thumb 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:40.619
 we conclude going to wrap around 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:43.590
 at 2 they will get a 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.420
 compact elementary bandage that 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.080
 protect no and keep the wrist 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.759
 blocked and also in the palm of the hand 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:55.890
 we will have enough space so as not to 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:57.899
 impeded we now see a 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.840
 advantage with a 4-meter bandage e 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.179
 means that can be useful for meetings 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.190
 more on the level 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:07.020
 let's always make the money three spins 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.429
 around the wrist 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.690
 we can also make four from later 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:16.220
 we have more then we think then above and 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.220
 let's make three turns beat the knuckles 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.120
 always keeping in this position e 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.420
 making the truth because so 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.420
 adherents 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.310
 back on the wrist this time we go 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:38.830
 to also sell a little of certain in this 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:42.630
 so here what it says first above and then 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.630
 on the other side a hundred 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.840
 all this we are going to block the 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:54.440
 advantage passing between the charms of the 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.440
 life as done in the previous village 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.920
 here depending on the nights that 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.150
 we want to protect more 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.280
 let's move in this direction 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.230
 in this direction personally 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:22.260
 I prefer to know it 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.260
 I hope 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.250
 also in this case we will have a message 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:34.310
 very resistant which therefore beats one 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.019
 hand because they protect the blocks 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.519
 a peculiarity of this bandage 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:39.920
 that we used bandages 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:41.959
 rigid and therefore even if they go to 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.549
 protect you the more the wedding is over 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:44.390
 difficult to use for reasons of 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:46.510
 adherence 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:50.390
 now we see a third type of advantage 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:55.430
 usable together in equal quantities 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:58.609
 to the difference compared to 40 this 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:00.590
 type of bandage will offer a great one 

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:02.420
 wrist support that will remain 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.310
 practically immobile and in any case 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:07.040
 will allow those useful movements to 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:09.109
 perform mild and at the same time 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.840
 it will fill the action a little more 

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:13.790
 of the knuckles and at the same time will go to 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.000
 stuffing a bit more of the area 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:19.099
 knuckles and thus protect further 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.739
 note the difference between what spas 

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:23.300
 my conventaccio that blocks the wrist and 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:25.720
 one must not even without a village that does not 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.720
 I put 

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:36.110
 and here is the advantage for us 

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:38.779
 the usual flap on the pole says 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:46.580
 let's start by turning on the knuckles and this one 

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:49.639
 time they can do 45 rpm by tightening 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:52.870
 and of course more and more then 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:56.889
 we can on the wrist here too we carry out 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.889
 four more laps 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:05.810
 we conclude by going to block bands 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:08.470
 lasts less than the usual console of 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.470
 ex structures 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:35.380
 we have thus carried out a message that 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:37.419
 goes to protect the knuckles a lot and 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:43.080
 however to give thickness to the wrist in 

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:43.080
 so that how much from mm up thanks 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:49.590
 I'm going to block the special belt 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.590
 the final vote
