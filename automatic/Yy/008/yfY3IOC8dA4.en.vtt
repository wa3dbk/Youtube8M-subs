00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 further we talk about the loan agreement cash 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.230
 means how to arrange it as 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.030
 protect your rights and interests already 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.250
 the moment of execution of such an agreement 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.019
 help us sort this private 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.240
 notary roman anastasia 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.850
 when transferring money as a loan 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.609
 citizens act differently make up 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.500
 a receipt is either a loan agreement 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.359
 in plain writing or 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.699
 notarize loan agreement 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.680
 all of these documents have different 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.439
 design requirements also have 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.250
 different legal consequences with regard to 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.020
 receipts 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.750
 I would like to draw attention to the fact that 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.059
 the receipt cannot replace the loan agreement 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.760
 because it only confirms the fact 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.680
 transfer of money under the conditions that 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.090
 defined in the contract therefore 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.200
 the law does not necessarily require 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.360
 notarization of the contract 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.950
 loan but by agreement of the parties 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.620
 such a contract can be certified 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.640
 notarially what are the features 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.210
 notarization of such 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.570
 of the contract 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.489
 notary when certifying the contract 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.559
 identifies the parties checks 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.750
 and have the ability of require 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.090
 necessary documents for certification 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.909
 such a contract if necessary 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.400
 draws up the consent of the spouse to the conclusion 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.320
 such a contract 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.630
 check the absence of restrictions on 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.970

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.240
 the intentions of the parties 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.920
 the notary draws up the text of the loan agreement 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.740
 as required by law 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.479
 for example monetary obligations under 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.430
 loan agreement must be expressed 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.740

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.740

 the official rate of the National Bank of Ukraine 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:39.299

 interest-free and in what cases 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.350
