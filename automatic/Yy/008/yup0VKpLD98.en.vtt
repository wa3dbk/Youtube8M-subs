 I'm here with a brand new video where 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.730
 we're going to talk about the new butterfield 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:23.039
 arline this new beating can be 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.260
 also called to fight 5 what not 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.730
 sees today of this new fight of 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.070
 we're going to see this new fight 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.529
 weapons and vehicles and many new ones 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.120
 images worth saying that it was 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.399
 made official only today by 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.100
 electronics that this game came out that 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.079
 this game is official the name eva 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.340
 and other things these are images I have 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.570
 found on the internet 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.850
 this should be one of the scenarios 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.160
 to fight 4 you run into battlefield 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.370
 drain beat 5 to put you five 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.860
 hard rahim we can find two factions 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.809
 these two factions are then of the 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.280
 police and what you want to see 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.320
 that of the wolf that of thieves then 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.629
 you can find mechanical operator is a 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.859
 force and professional or the four 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.960
 classes that we find in all 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:08.250
 always been butterfield 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.619
 regarding now here 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.260
 an image one of the first on all the 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.060
 weapons that will be there I don't think there is 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:22.229
 will be on these however we start 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:25.259
 we find a classic ak47 ak47 we can 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.540
 give with the charger along it then 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.689
 shield the baseball bat for the first 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:34.140
 time in this for the first time on 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.619
 butterfield and why in those 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:40.250
 previous 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:42.720
 there was never the c 49 but of course 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.939
 c4 instead always this was what not 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.009
 I would genuinely know what to tell you what it is 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:50.490
 what can be ahead 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:52.500
 surely we will have to find out later we have 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.500
 the camera that a camera 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.200
 we will probably be able to position it not 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.299
 I still well understand however also why it is 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.530
 just been presented today is already the 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:06.770
 fact that there are all these images 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:09.940
 They are already so much the street stinger 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:17.010
 what fells 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:21.670
 the trucks the 36 g then we have a grenade 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:31.270
 slogan and in what was all the 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:39.970
 smoke the harpoon then we have the how it is 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:43.270
 call the semtex all these things between 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:47.170
 there was a harpoon in the old and old 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:54.270
 bat film then we send them forward this 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:57.960
 pistolina then we have the bayonet luso 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:03:03.880
 a mine would not know what to get mine 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:13.680
 perhaps the landmine then later we have 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:24.060
 lemme 16 then we have as you can see 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:26.830
 m40 then the m9 the cabbage is called 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:30.670
 then demand a short-barreled reed gun 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:33.610
 then he stops this weapon sincerely 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:36.190
 a futuristic I wouldn't know what to tell you 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:44.820
 at least it's a collie because of the 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:44.820
 shake other machine gun wolves the 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:51.959
 shotgun the crossbow a but sorry 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.530
 I skipped a line probably here 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.939
 forget it 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:04:00.159
 however, I am about to accept a truncheon 

00:03:54.939 --> 00:04:01.599
 as you can still see the rpg 

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:04.329
 I'm telling you what below 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:05.700
 stupid rpg and then something I believe 

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:08.859
 both to ignite 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:10.689
 what they are doing now 

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:15.489
 see the technova that before 

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:19.209
 this gp I took this image and 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:22.090
 I enlarged this as I said 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:23.580
 first is the only thing that first photo 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.199
 video before recording then 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.780
 however I leave you in the description the 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:33.910
 site link where I found all 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:35.169
 these news American site where 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:37.320
 you can see also I have not put in 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:39.760
 this video of accessories all weapons 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.289
 and some accessories to put on 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.090
 vehicles we're going to see between 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:45.190
 very little 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:50.729
 here are the accessories I was talking about 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:56.410
 first all tori reading sights 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:59.039
 charger silencer knobs e 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.039
 let's move on to vehicles 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:06.099
 There are between four to the eye 

00:05:03.099 --> 00:05:09.580
 four helicopters four helicopters 

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:11.620
 I think the last ones will be different 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:14.050
 below those military ones the most in 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:16.150
 high maybe those of the day I don't know 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:18.610
 sincerely but precisely this 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:22.810
 police-based constitution ai 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:25.990
 thieves then we have the bikes the vans 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:32.080
 in short, machines for the police 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:33.270
 sports on trucks 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:40.020
 we have 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:41.700
 a bit of everything is also a greeting 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:45.630
 in possession of a video that I will leave you 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:48.510
 after that it would do some load after this 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:51.120
 video where I will show you there is a video 

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:55.230
 that came out like this on a can 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.800
 trailer is not known is anonymous so not 

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:58.560
 you know 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:00.810
 I still load it because at first 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:03.560
 news those just passed sorry 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:06.750
 were all possible emblems or 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:07.890
 archive mans that you can receive is 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:10.770
 this one 

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:13.740
 visceral could be a possible one 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:18.650
 manufacturer of course as you know 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:21.870
 it's just the one who puts the game 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:23.960
 in the producing thing the visceral like 

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:27.300
 I told you before pissing right 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:31.520
 then of this bacterium arline is obvious 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:33.960
 as you know it will be released in November 

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:37.560
 November is obviously not known in the 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:39.690
 new and 3 will be presented well today 

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:43.320
 like small houses there is only news 

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:46.470
 official of ars e per electronics 

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:49.560
 the rest everything I did 

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:51.090
 see I'm not telling you it's true 

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:53.880
 but they are the first images that they are 

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:56.340
 outputs of certain video sources enough 

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:59.880
 which instead will load later will be a video 

00:06:56.340 --> 00:07:03.500
 more than anything else that came out however they seem 

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:05.940
 quite equal to some images that 

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:07.440
 so it could be a preview of 

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:10.260
 a trainer that someone managed to 

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:12.000
 bring us for this most of all there 

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.680
