right here that this is just an example

00:05:56.089 --> 00:05:58.510 
right here that this is just an example
so<00:05:56.300> imagine<00:05:56.810> as<00:05:56.960> being<00:05:57.229> like<00:05:57.500> one<00:05:57.830> layer<00:05:58.190> of

00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:58.520 
so imagine as being like one layer of

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.760 
so imagine as being like one layer of
fabric<00:05:58.789> that<00:05:59.270> you<00:05:59.419> cut<00:05:59.690> and<00:06:00.050> you're<00:06:00.680> gonna

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:00.770 
fabric that you cut and you're gonna

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:04.300 
fabric that you cut and you're gonna
join<00:06:01.129> the<00:06:01.460> two<00:06:01.669> ends<00:06:02.060> together<00:06:02.229> the<00:06:03.229> wider<00:06:03.500> the

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:04.310 
join the two ends together the wider the

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:06.820 
join the two ends together the wider the
t-shirt<00:06:04.969> or<00:06:05.330> the<00:06:05.629> material<00:06:06.139> the<00:06:06.319> better<00:06:06.469> it<00:06:06.740> is

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:06.830 
t-shirt or the material the better it is

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:10.629 
t-shirt or the material the better it is
and<00:06:07.069> the<00:06:07.219> longer<00:06:07.699> the<00:06:07.879> more<00:06:08.839> I<00:06:09.319> guess<00:06:09.919> the

00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:10.639 
and the longer the more I guess the

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:12.939 
and the longer the more I guess the
better<00:06:10.819> that<00:06:11.000> is<00:06:11.330> so<00:06:11.750> the<00:06:11.900> wider<00:06:12.169> and<00:06:12.620> the

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:12.949 
better that is so the wider and the

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:16.119 
better that is so the wider and the
longer<00:06:13.400> the<00:06:14.360> material<00:06:14.870> is<00:06:15.080> the<00:06:15.469> more<00:06:15.710> layering

00:06:16.119 --> 00:06:16.129 
longer the material is the more layering

00:06:16.129 --> 00:06:18.159 
longer the material is the more layering
you<00:06:16.490> can<00:06:16.699> do<00:06:16.909> and<00:06:17.240> the<00:06:17.509> more<00:06:17.690> coverage<00:06:18.139> you

00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:18.169 
you can do and the more coverage you

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:20.709 
you can do and the more coverage you
will<00:06:18.379> get<00:06:18.620> so<00:06:19.490> you<00:06:19.580> just<00:06:19.759> join<00:06:20.029> the<00:06:20.180> two<00:06:20.419> ends

00:06:20.709 --> 00:06:20.719 
will get so you just join the two ends

00:06:20.719 --> 00:06:23.000 
will get so you just join the two ends
together

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.010
