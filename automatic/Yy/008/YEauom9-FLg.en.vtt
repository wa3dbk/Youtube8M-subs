00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
inches in height to the top of the visor

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 
permanent position you can't remove it

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.910 
permanent position you can't remove it
both<00:01:04.309> of<00:01:04.489> the<00:01:04.549> head<00:01:04.729> inside<00:01:05.239> is<00:01:05.920> articulated

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
both of the head inside is articulated

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.399 
both of the head inside is articulated
so<00:01:07.100> you<00:01:07.159> can<00:01:07.430> move<00:01:07.729> that<00:01:07.909> slightly<00:01:08.299> but<00:01:08.659> it's

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
so you can move that slightly but it's

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:12.580 
so you can move that slightly but it's
quite<00:01:09.829> difficult<00:01:10.280> because<00:01:10.790> this<00:01:11.600> visor<00:01:11.899> is<00:01:12.259> in

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590

quite difficult because this visor is in
the<00:01:12.740> winding<00:01:13.130> does<00:01:13.750> affect<00:01:14.750> the<00:01:15.650> access<00:01:16.580> to

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:16.940 
the winding does affect the access to

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.240 
the winding does affect the access to
Buzz<00:01:17.180> his<00:01:17.390> head<00:01:17.720> both<00:01:18.290> of<00:01:18.470> the<00:01:18.560> detail<00:01:18.950> on<00:01:19.070> the

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
they are ball jointed after the top but

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.149 
they are ball jointed after the top but
it<00:01:31.729> is<00:01:31.940> fixed<00:01:32.840> in<00:01:33.020> that<00:01:33.170> bend<00:01:33.470> position<00:01:33.950> and

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 
it is fixed in that bend position and

the arms the legs are fixed in that

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.719 
the arms the legs are fixed in that
event<00:01:50.030> position<00:01:50.600> after<00:01:50.810> the<00:01:51.049> knee<00:01:51.200> there<00:01:51.470> and

event position after the knee there and

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.030 
event position after the knee there and
that<00:01:52.729> is<00:01:53.210> all<00:01:53.510> the<00:01:53.750> articulation<00:01:54.590> on<00:01:54.799> this

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 
that is all the articulation on this

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.480 
that is all the articulation on this
figure<00:01:55.280> so<00:01:55.520> one<00:01:55.790> two<00:01:56.030> three<00:01:56.060> four<00:01:56.810> and<00:01:57.020> five

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
figure so one two three four and five

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.450 
figure so one two three four and five
points<00:01:58.490> of<00:01:58.700> articulation<00:01:58.909> but<00:02:00.009> that<00:02:01.009> doesn't

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
points of articulation but that doesn't

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.100 
points of articulation but that doesn't
matter<00:02:01.640> too<00:02:01.850> much<00:02:01.880> because<00:02:02.210> the<00:02:02.570> detail<00:02:02.960> on

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
matter too much because the detail on

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.109 
matter too much because the detail on
this<00:02:03.290> is<00:02:03.560> very<00:02:03.590> very<00:02:04.100> good<00:02:04.250> especially<00:02:04.759> at<00:02:05.060> the

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
this is very very good especially at the

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:08.050 
this is very very good especially at the
head<00:02:05.299> and<00:02:05.509> all<00:02:06.320> around<00:02:06.650> this<00:02:06.799> figure<00:02:07.040> and<00:02:07.579> also

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
head and all around this figure and also

head and all around this figure and also
the<00:02:08.209> backpack<00:02:08.629> as<00:02:08.810> well<00:02:08.959> the<00:02:09.110> wings<00:02:09.319> they<00:02:09.950> do

look<00:02:10.369> very<00:02:10.399> good<00:02:11.030> we<00:02:11.209> do<00:02:11.360> have<00:02:11.569> symbols<00:02:12.500> as

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739 
look very good we do have symbols as
