00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
little easy because they look around and

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:52.500 
little easy because they look around and
they<00:03:50.800> go<00:03:50.980> while<00:03:51.459> he<00:03:51.730> failed<00:03:51.970> and<00:03:52.239> he<00:03:52.269> failed

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510
