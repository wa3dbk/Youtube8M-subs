00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:04.770
 Tuesday evening 20:15 in the scandal in 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.140
 cottbus 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.620
 the club is down to the last seat 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:13.170
 what do they all want here? 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:15.540
 Quite simply it is quiz that side 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.600
 means it is pondered and advised to 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:21.300
 To round off three round ten questions 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.510
 the teams have to answer and that 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.869
 are the quizmasters georg and olaf them 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.609
 have called the quiz page to life 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:31.679
 but in turn every sunday 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.719
 afternoon the two are sitting in the wg 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.540
 living together and thinking 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.520
 ask for a quiz on the idea 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.670
 The two are at one 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.600
 come party 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.070
 then we said okay 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.110
 let's get together we'll do it 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.219
 in pubs quiz and there we had from 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.050
 at the beginning of the same 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.640
 intention to do something different 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.739
 we really wanted something completely 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.969
 So somehow we're special 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.199
 even outdo you when you have already 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.610
 really chance in public 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.079
 The pub, so to speak 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.120
 present and realize and 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.550
 are told to come let us all 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.960
 I can incorporate our talents 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.479
 program you can store well 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.460
 we both can do it very well 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.580
 and now the two already have that 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.619
 thirtieth page quiz organizes each one 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.470
 Sometimes the teams will know about it 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.740
 various areas queried one 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.299
 popular category the puzzles 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:24.140
 Do you know what concept was here 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.140
 is searched 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:38.390
 it is the old chancellor Helmut Kohl the um 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:41.409
 a bus is running so columbus searched 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:44.469
 became the sailor christoph columbus 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:46.609
 the quiz masters are satisfied or 

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:49.069
 Let's tell how it's time 

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:51.799
 Quits how it works 

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:53.750
 super great but the people are very much today 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:54.319
 very quiet and a constant that is total 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.939
 beautiful 

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:57.170
 we had made us a bit of sorrow 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:58.880
 because there are quite a few innovations 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.280
 new things have come up with new ones 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.909
 types of questions ask new questions because of it 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.709
 gets full 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:04.880
 I am really surprised that we have this 

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:07.340
 amount of people and this amount 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.280
 innovations are relatively professional 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.410
 could at the now 30 quiz you can 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.349
 the two but already rightly professionals 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.940
 call 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:18.680
 I can every week because it is one 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.480
 week find a nice variety for 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.470
 everyday not for me here very well me 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.470
 meet me every week with my 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:27.110
 So friend must have a pleasant 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.660
 diversion and yes you can stop 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.790
 to stimulate memory a bit 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.769
 that makes a lot of fun academic 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:37.459
 ask war gunther jauch stupid questions 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:38.540
 Here's the vie I say good man 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.360
 likes to do it and of course it does 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.890
 not friends again 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.060
 nevertheless it is always good overall 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.810
 winning a mood is always natural 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.800
 even better 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:50.240
 because the winning team gets the evening 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.400
 beverage coupons and when a team 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.890
 months victory comes then there is already 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.620
 something very special to jump on the side 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:01.430
 winner of the month september got to 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:03.230
 example boards still 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.670
 At some point, the longest will work 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.500
 quiz night to end 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.900
 she was quite quick in conclusion for 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.330
 she was great at both sides to 30 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.220
 so many teams have never been there at the 25th 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.780
 number of new record for us i found it 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.880
 just awesome I am always again 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.410
 Surprised how many people we reach 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.540
 and how many people we inspire and 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.770
 despite all efforts, it is nothing 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.630
 what I somehow regret it 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:24.290
 everything is worth it I am always again 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.200
 totally touched 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.690
 that makes incredibly fun absolutely so 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.489
 on in a few days without strings quiz 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.920
 but at the latest on Sunday afternoon 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:36.920
 The two sit together again and 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:40.060
 new questions come from the next one 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:45.580
