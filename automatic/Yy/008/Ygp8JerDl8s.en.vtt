down<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:54.930> end<00:01:55.049> there<00:01:55.229> I<00:01:55.350> just<00:01:55.530> spied<00:01:55.799> out<00:01:55.979> so

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
down the end there I just spied out so

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.370 
down the end there I just spied out so
that's<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:56.549> pretty<00:01:57.119> decent<00:01:57.630> pack<00:01:57.869> on<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.259> end

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
of that so we're quite foreign to the

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.690 
of that so we're quite foreign to the
pack<00:02:00.990> opening<00:02:01.409> so<00:02:01.590> far<00:02:01.829> we<00:02:01.950> still<00:02:02.009> haven't

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 
Henderson I'm thinking of we got

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:16.330 
Henderson I'm thinking of we got
spearing<00:04:14.209> that's<00:04:14.780> good<00:04:15.049> where's<00:04:15.890> Henderson
