00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:58.819 
this might to some degree one way I
think<00:01:57.689> you're<00:01:57.869> gonna<00:01:57.960> describe<00:01:58.320> it<00:01:58.530> is<00:01:58.649> you

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
think you're gonna describe it is you

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.069 
think you're gonna describe it is you
could<00:01:58.979> really<00:01:59.549> ride<00:01:59.820> this<00:02:00.030> bike<00:02:00.210> to<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:00.750> track

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
could really ride this bike to the track

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.080 
could really ride this bike to the track
do<00:02:01.649> a<00:02:01.679> track<00:02:02.009> day<00:02:02.219> and<00:02:02.460> then<00:02:02.609> right<00:02:02.789> at<00:02:02.939> home

which<00:02:03.420> is<00:02:03.450> pretty<00:02:03.750> much<00:02:03.929> what<00:02:04.200> we're<00:02:04.350> doing

00:02:04.669 --> 00:02:04.679

everything<00:02:13.830> then<00:02:14.280> the<00:02:14.459> ABS<00:02:14.819> is<00:02:15.030> operating<00:02:15.629> in

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
everything then the ABS is operating in

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.180 
everything then the ABS is operating in
the<00:02:15.780> background<00:02:15.900> now<00:02:16.349> it<00:02:16.500> is<00:02:16.620> switchable<00:02:16.980> you

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
the background now it is switchable you

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.550 
the background now it is switchable you
can<00:02:17.400> turn<00:02:17.610> it<00:02:17.790> off<00:02:17.879> the<00:02:18.120> ABS<00:02:18.209> and<00:02:18.629> the<00:02:18.690> TC<00:02:19.049> but

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
can turn it off the ABS and the TC but

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.190 
can turn it off the ABS and the TC but
even<00:02:19.769> with<00:02:19.920> the<00:02:20.040> you<00:02:20.250> know<00:02:20.310> operating<00:02:21.200> it's

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
even with the you know operating it's

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.050 
even with the you know operating it's
not<00:02:22.349> something<00:02:22.709> that<00:02:22.739> is<00:02:22.980> going<00:02:23.069> to<00:02:23.340> interfere

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
not something that is going to interfere

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.820

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
to start you know touching down and the

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.120 
to start you know touching down and the
shifters<00:02:30.230> now<00:02:31.230> we<00:02:31.290> didn't<00:02:31.590> really<00:02:31.739> have<00:02:31.920> time

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
shifters now we didn't really have time

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.620 
shifters now we didn't really have time
to<00:02:32.190> fiddle<00:02:32.459> with<00:02:32.640> suspension<00:02:33.150> but<00:02:33.299> of<00:02:33.420> course

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
to fiddle with suspension but of course

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.270

it<00:02:33.750> was<00:02:33.870> set<00:02:34.019> a<00:02:34.049> little<00:02:34.260> soft<00:02:34.560> for<00:02:34.860> the<00:02:35.069> track

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
it was set a little soft for the track

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.839 
it was set a little soft for the track
riding<00:02:35.489> so<00:02:35.880> you<00:02:35.970> could<00:02:36.120> stiffen<00:02:36.480> that<00:02:36.510> up

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:37.849 
riding so you could stiffen that up
