00:00:53.740 --> 00:01:03.500

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.060
 an article in which you are already nanÃ¡ 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.430
 Even in rock came when I was 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.610
 looking for someone to do some 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.620
 covers of tadim cerrone house one thing 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.580
 I wish I was studying in the 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.770
 time 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.290
 And then I got to know Sergio Murilo. 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.530
 which is the organ that was the scorer of the cd is 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.780
 the jucilei that accompanies me and there we 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.660
 he is what i too 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:43.410
 he showed me some things we 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:45.300
 realized well and that we recorded 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:48.600
 some songs send some 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:52.200
 record companies 7 thousand got interested 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:55.050
 In this story is the studio with 10 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:02:00.479
 songs we did three in the beautiful corridor 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:03.479
 author who is number 7 out more and is 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:06.090
 right course because I already had copyright band 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.160
 and also an entire composer then do 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.470
 only re-reading is then also a 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.830
 copyright work that is reviewing a 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:18.239
 work but the taste of having a 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:21.120
 Your unreleased song is indescribable, right? 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:24.030
 So that's it 12 songs two re-readings 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.760
 of rock classics and a song 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:31.010

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.010

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.480

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:21.030

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:32.890
 already in the stores is not only the death of the 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:36.760

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:39.070
 The king's will is a person's love. 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:44.020

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:50.410
