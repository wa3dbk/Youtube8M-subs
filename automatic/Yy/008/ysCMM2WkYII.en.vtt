feel<00:00:24.480> worried<00:00:24.630> about<00:00:24.750> washing<00:00:25.050> it<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.230> day

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.420 
I tried it was a couple of my other
primers<00:01:45.240> that<00:01:45.390> weren't<00:01:46.380> working<00:01:46.770> as<00:01:46.890> well<00:01:47.220> for

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
primers that weren't working as well for

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.920 
primers that weren't working as well for
me<00:01:47.490> as<00:01:47.579> I<00:01:47.670> would<00:01:47.790> have<00:01:47.880> liked<00:01:48.060> so<00:01:48.509> this<00:01:48.630> one<00:01:48.810> is

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
me as I would have liked so this one is

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.499 
me as I would have liked so this one is
also<00:01:49.079> a<00:01:49.229> squeezy<00:01:49.560> tube<00:01:49.860> application<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:50.850> this

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
also a squeezy tube application and this

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.969 
also a squeezy tube application and this
texture<00:01:52.170> is<00:01:52.350> more<00:01:53.280> like<00:01:53.640> kind<00:01:53.820> of<00:01:53.970> a<00:01:54.979> little

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
texture is more like kind of a little

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.800 
texture is more like kind of a little
more<00:01:56.070> thick<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:56.579> dense<00:01:56.759> it<00:01:57.119> reminds<00:01:57.689> me<00:01:57.780> very

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
more thick and dense it reminds me very

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.679 
more thick and dense it reminds me very
very<00:01:58.170> much<00:01:58.320> of<00:01:58.670> my<00:01:59.670> number<00:01:59.939> 3<00:02:00.149> favorite<00:02:00.509> which

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
very much of my number 3 favorite which

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.870 
very much of my number 3 favorite which
is<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:00.869> Urban<00:02:01.200> Decay<00:02:01.290> primer<00:02:01.799> potion<00:02:02.009> in<00:02:02.520> the

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
is the Urban Decay primer potion in the

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.760 
is the Urban Decay primer potion in the
new<00:02:03.060> packaging<00:02:03.780> not<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.170> old<00:02:04.320> doe<00:02:04.530> foot

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
new packaging not the old doe foot

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.679 
new packaging not the old doe foot
packaging<00:02:05.280> because<00:02:05.430> I<00:02:05.520> hated<00:02:05.939> that<00:02:06.119> formula

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
packaging because I hated that formula

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.609 
packaging because I hated that formula
so<00:02:07.469> this<00:02:07.890> one<00:02:08.569> this<00:02:09.569> is<00:02:09.750> urban<00:02:09.959> decay<00:02:10.200> and<00:02:10.410> this

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
so this one this is urban decay and this

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.430 
so this one this is urban decay and this
one's<00:02:10.830> Milani

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
one's Milani

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.460 
one's Milani
the<00:02:13.440> Milani<00:02:13.739> one<00:02:14.010> is<00:02:14.220> slightly<00:02:14.640> more<00:02:14.910> Brown

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
the Milani one is slightly more Brown

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.900 
the Milani one is slightly more Brown
whereas<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:16.560> urban<00:02:16.770> decay<00:02:16.890> is<00:02:17.040> slightly<00:02:17.640> more

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
whereas the urban decay is slightly more

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.150 
whereas the urban decay is slightly more
pale<00:02:18.209> but<00:02:18.870> they<00:02:18.959> both<00:02:19.140> thin<00:02:19.620> out<00:02:19.770> they<00:02:19.950> shear

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
pale but they both thin out they shear

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.040 
pale but they both thin out they shear
out<00:02:20.310> into<00:02:20.610> nothing<00:02:20.760> and<00:02:21.180> they're<00:02:21.720> about<00:02:21.930> the

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
out into nothing and they're about the

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.390 
out into nothing and they're about the
same<00:02:22.260> texture<00:02:22.680> they're<00:02:22.830> both<00:02:22.950> kind<00:02:23.220> of<00:02:23.280> like

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
same texture they're both kind of like

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.449 
same texture they're both kind of like
whipped<00:02:23.760> and<00:02:24.060> very<00:02:24.599> light<00:02:24.900> feeling<00:02:25.319> and<00:02:25.530> when

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
whipped and very light feeling and when

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.250 
whipped and very light feeling and when
you<00:02:26.520> put<00:02:26.700> them<00:02:26.819> on<00:02:26.940> they<00:02:27.209> don't<00:02:27.450> feel<00:02:27.750> like

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
you put them on they don't feel like

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.309 
you put them on they don't feel like
greasy<00:02:28.769> on<00:02:28.800> the<00:02:29.010> lid<00:02:29.190> whereas<00:02:29.790> this<00:02:30.269> one<00:02:30.599> feels

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
greasy on the lid whereas this one feels

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:32.960 
greasy on the lid whereas this one feels
a<00:02:31.440> bit<00:02:31.560> greasy<00:02:31.800> but<00:02:32.190> you<00:02:32.280> kind<00:02:32.489> of<00:02:32.519> just<00:02:32.670> let<00:02:32.760> it

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
a bit greasy but you kind of just let it

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.910 
a bit greasy but you kind of just let it
sit<00:02:33.239> for<00:02:33.269> a<00:02:33.420> minute<00:02:33.660> and<00:02:33.720> it's<00:02:33.900> fine<00:02:34.170> so<00:02:34.800> these

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
sit for a minute and it's fine so these

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.650 
sit for a minute and it's fine so these
don't<00:02:35.130> feel<00:02:35.340> as<00:02:35.519> greasy<00:02:35.940> there<00:02:36.450> definitely

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 
are a little more like whipped feeling

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:41.420 
are a little more like whipped feeling
like<00:02:40.019> when<00:02:40.140> you<00:02:40.230> do<00:02:40.349> this<00:02:40.470> you<00:02:40.860> kind<00:02:41.010> of<00:02:41.130> feel

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
like when you do this you kind of feel

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.160 
like when you do this you kind of feel
the<00:02:41.700> product<00:02:42.180> between<00:02:42.510> your<00:02:42.630> fingers<00:02:42.900> whereas

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
the product between your fingers whereas

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.320 
the product between your fingers whereas
with<00:02:43.349> the<00:02:43.950> balm<00:02:44.190> it<00:02:44.459> feels<00:02:44.640> more<00:02:44.760> like<00:02:44.819> a<00:02:44.940> serum

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
with the balm it feels more like a serum

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.259 
with the balm it feels more like a serum
and<00:02:45.390> you<00:02:45.480> don't<00:02:45.630> really<00:02:45.720> feel<00:02:45.989> it<00:02:46.880> the<00:02:47.880> Milani

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
and you don't really feel it the Milani

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:52.759 
and you don't really feel it the Milani
is<00:02:48.600> thicker<00:02:49.380> and<00:02:50.840> then<00:02:51.840> the<00:02:51.930> urban<00:02:52.200> decay<00:02:52.319> is<00:02:52.739> a

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
is thicker and then the urban decay is a

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:54.890 
is thicker and then the urban decay is a
little<00:02:53.130> more<00:02:53.580> blendable<00:02:54.180> but<00:02:54.569> for<00:02:54.720> some

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
little more blendable but for some

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.080 
little more blendable but for some
reason<00:02:55.230> I<00:02:55.470> just<00:02:55.860> like<00:02:56.190> this<00:02:56.340> one<00:02:56.519> a<00:02:56.549> tiny<00:02:56.880> tiny

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
reason I just like this one a tiny tiny

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.180 
reason I just like this one a tiny tiny
bit<00:02:57.239> more<00:02:57.480> than<00:02:57.660> the<00:02:57.750> Milani<00:02:58.019> they're<00:02:58.590> really

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
bit more than the Milani they're really

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.160 
bit more than the Milani they're really
