00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
agility is important and in my opinion

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.080

this<00:03:56.290> is<00:03:56.350> my<00:03:56.650> favorite<00:03:57.100> perk<00:03:57.310> out<00:03:57.550> of<00:03:57.760> the<00:03:57.880> two

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
this is my favorite perk out of the two

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.180 
this is my favorite perk out of the two
the<00:03:58.510> reason<00:03:58.810> why<00:03:58.959> is<00:03:58.989> because<00:03:59.230> i<00:03:59.560> find<00:03:59.950> it<00:04:00.070> the

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
the reason why is because i find it the

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.220 
the reason why is because i find it the
most<00:04:00.220> useful<00:04:00.730> but<00:04:01.330> then<00:04:01.540> again<00:04:01.660> maybe<00:04:01.959> your

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
most useful but then again maybe your

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.170 
most useful but then again maybe your
agility<00:04:02.500> is<00:04:02.800> already<00:04:03.160> good<00:04:03.310> enough<00:04:03.370> and<00:04:03.880> you

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
agility is already good enough and you

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.690 
agility is already good enough and you
might<00:04:04.209> find<00:04:04.390> snapshot<00:04:05.290> more<00:04:05.530> useful<00:04:06.040> i<00:04:06.220> guess

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
might find snapshot more useful i guess

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.850 
might find snapshot more useful i guess
it<00:04:06.850> all<00:04:06.970> depends<00:04:07.390> on<00:04:07.570> your<00:04:07.660> preference<00:04:08.200> of<00:04:08.350> the

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:08.860 
it all depends on your preference of the

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:10.949 
it all depends on your preference of the
perks<00:04:09.130> something<00:04:10.120> else<00:04:10.270> that's<00:04:10.480> beautiful

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 
perks something else that's beautiful

about this sniper rifle that works
similar<00:04:13.270> to<00:04:13.420> the<00:04:13.510> perk<00:04:13.720> firefly<00:04:14.320> if<00:04:14.470> you<00:04:14.590> guys

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:14.739 
similar to the perk firefly if you guys

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:16.770 
similar to the perk firefly if you guys
know<00:04:15.040> it's<00:04:15.250> the<00:04:15.580> Icebreaker<00:04:16.060> when<00:04:16.419> you<00:04:16.540> shoot

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
know it's the Icebreaker when you shoot

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.840 
know it's the Icebreaker when you shoot
and<00:04:16.930> kill<00:04:16.989> enemies<00:04:17.590> they<00:04:17.950> will<00:04:18.160> combust<00:04:18.549> and

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:18.850 
and kill enemies they will combust and

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:21.180 
and kill enemies they will combust and
by<00:04:19.239> combust<00:04:19.690> I<00:04:19.930> mean<00:04:20.140> they<00:04:20.289> explode<00:04:20.739> with<00:04:20.919> fire

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
by combust I mean they explode with fire

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:22.800 
by combust I mean they explode with fire
so<00:04:21.489> that's<00:04:21.669> why<00:04:21.820> I'm<00:04:21.940> confused<00:04:22.390> on<00:04:22.600> why<00:04:22.750> this

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
so that's why I'm confused on why this

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.510

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
this fire breaks I switch I guess that

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.760 
this fire breaks I switch I guess that
