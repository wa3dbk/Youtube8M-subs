00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:13.629
 when presenting the i30 expect profile to make the ael a special one 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:16.249
 variant will not take long 

00:00:16.249 --> 00:00:19.669
 and the koreans have kept their word because indeed you are standing there anyway 

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:20.949
 nice and fresh 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:24.199
 What is striking is that it is immediately the most beautiful responses 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:25.099
 and in addition 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:27.960
 I see you we can create very clear family faces 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.669
 that site tutti thirty or so put this car but also 40 here 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:34.669
 and that is no shame 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.700
 the suffering is three centimeters higher and 18 and a half centimeters longer 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.510
 job market 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.510
 I will have to ratify on the good to the passengers 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.210
 both in the front and in the back, this 30 can soak in terms of space 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.950
 with the toppers in its class Volkswagen Golf variant and the Ford focus 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.130
 and that also applies to the trunk has a capacity of 528 liters and that is 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:08.130
 more than a quarter more than the effects have forgiven 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.850
 in the netherlands there are two engines available for those thirty members and in 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:19.609
 it's not like that 

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:21.290
 during the incident 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.200
 the last and in front of our test car 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.200
 and that 135 horsepower engine that is full is actually fine 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.580
 it is nice and smooth and it is vibration-free 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.400
 but I want it, he is not eager 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.600
 It is often the case that you are in Hamburg that you can do that 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.600
 shift down 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.229
 art 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:42.710
 to unmask the ladies 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.710
 that is also because the gearbox has longer gear ratios 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.149
 on the other hand because of the victory too 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:50.469
 it is true that it is 

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:51.620
 in the highest gear 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.620
 very nice low revs 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.310
 donner suggests hukker 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.060
 it has been adjusted in details compared to that of its sister model kia sees 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.520
 but broadly similar 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.999
 nevertheless there are changes in driving behavior 

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:12.449
 the site is, for example, that a tighter suspension seems a bit sportier 

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:17.579
 this i30 yes this was swampy hour and with a bit more about him in the corners even more 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:19.869
 diving with the rider 

00:02:19.869 --> 00:02:22.389
 In doing so said the choice of tires 

00:02:22.389 --> 00:02:25.059
 what this car that 30 is talking about the tires 

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:28.059
 then for example the looks that have tested 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:37.689
 it is the site that has this car power steering preferably 8 

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:40.779
 but no matter which mode you choose, control remains aloof and 

00:02:40.779 --> 00:02:42.339
 numb 

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:45.369
 and that is unfortunate because the control German behind that of, for example 

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:48.369
 compete the focus with this otelul 

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:56.599
 So here is a built-up member that was made with stones that is quite intact 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:58.079
 far behind us 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:01.009
 this of those 30 looks neat and tidy 

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:04.349
 it looks very different from the site you have them sportier 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:05.029
 interior 

00:03:05.029 --> 00:03:08.439
 whereby the work becomes a bit all that has fallen behind you around 

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:09.719
 this car is not like that 

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:12.719
 it is perhaps something that can mainly be seen 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:27.149
 with this i30 week end 

00:03:27.149 --> 00:03:29.840
 down the throat or like the Volkswagen Golf variant 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.539
 and focus the ford 

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:34.289
 and I follow 30 at a very short distance 

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:37.369
 for space just after it is even more or less 

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:40.249
 and in terms of price, top it off 

00:03:40.249 --> 00:03:43.249
 but true while the shelves are going I will have to wait 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:47.639
 and moreover, designjet is just about that bit of class that the golf has and the 

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:48.730
 flair of focus
