down<00:02:17.290> just<00:02:18.290> short<00:02:18.590> of<00:02:18.709> touching<00:02:19.099> my<00:02:19.219> chest<00:02:19.549> and

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
down just short of touching my chest and

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.599 
down just short of touching my chest and
I<00:02:20.239> come<00:02:20.510> all<00:02:20.719> the<00:02:20.750> way<00:02:20.930> up<00:02:21.079> just<00:02:21.530> short<00:02:22.189> of<00:02:22.340> lock

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:22.609 
I come all the way up just short of lock

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:25.119 
I come all the way up just short of lock
out<00:02:22.909> keep<00:02:23.480> it<00:02:23.659> constant<00:02:24.500> tension<00:02:24.799> on<00:02:25.010> the

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:25.129 
out keep it constant tension on the

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:27.160 
out keep it constant tension on the
upper<00:02:25.459> chest<00:02:25.760> now<00:02:26.329> you<00:02:26.389> know<00:02:26.719> anything<00:02:27.049> about

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
upper chest now you know anything about

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.580 
upper chest now you know anything about
me<00:02:27.560> you<00:02:27.739> know<00:02:27.889> I<00:02:27.920> can<00:02:28.310> do<00:02:28.400> 225<00:02:28.909> for<00:02:29.810> 10<00:02:30.200> to<00:02:30.319> 12

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
me you know I can do 225 for 10 to 12

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.789 
me you know I can do 225 for 10 to 12
reps<00:02:30.980> easy<00:02:31.540> using<00:02:32.540> this<00:02:32.870> constant<00:02:33.530> tension

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:33.799 
reps easy using this constant tension

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:37.030 
reps easy using this constant tension
method<00:02:34.489> I<00:02:34.790> was<00:02:35.450> only<00:02:35.750> able<00:02:36.049> to<00:02:36.260> get<00:02:36.439> seven<00:02:36.920> and

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
method I was only able to get seven and

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.809 
method I was only able to get seven and
I<00:02:37.099> tried<00:02:37.549> my<00:02:37.579> hardest<00:02:38.420> to<00:02:38.959> get<00:02:39.109> 10<00:02:39.680> you<00:02:40.400> know<00:02:40.519> so

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:40.819 
I tried my hardest to get 10 you know so

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:43.330 
I tried my hardest to get 10 you know so
I<00:02:40.879> will<00:02:41.120> admit<00:02:41.540> using<00:02:42.379> constant<00:02:42.769> tension<00:02:43.099> it's

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
I will admit using constant tension it's

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:44.890 
I will admit using constant tension it's
a<00:02:43.400> little<00:02:43.639> harder<00:02:44.060> and<00:02:44.209> the<00:02:44.419> reason<00:02:44.720> being

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
a little harder and the reason being

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.050 
a little harder and the reason being
like<00:02:45.260> I<00:02:45.349> said<00:02:45.620> when<00:02:46.220> you<00:02:46.340> come<00:02:46.609> all<00:02:46.849> the<00:02:47.030> way

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
like I said when you come all the way

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.500 
like I said when you come all the way
down<00:02:47.180> you<00:02:48.049> lose<00:02:48.260> a<00:02:48.290> little<00:02:48.590> tension<00:02:49.000> also<00:02:50.000> your

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
down you lose a little tension also your

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.020 
down you lose a little tension also your
last<00:02:50.900> they<00:02:51.500> help<00:02:51.799> you<00:02:51.919> power<00:02:52.250> that<00:02:52.549> bitch<00:02:52.760> back

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
last they help you power that bitch back

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.899 
last they help you power that bitch back
up<00:02:53.299> I<00:02:53.569> have<00:02:54.019> real<00:02:54.260> strong<00:02:54.500> legs<00:02:54.950> so<00:02:55.489> I<00:02:55.519> was<00:02:55.760> in<00:02:55.849> a

00:02:55.899 --> 00:02:55.909 
up I have real strong legs so I was in a

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:58.709 
up I have real strong legs so I was in a
disadvantage<00:02:56.480> so<00:02:56.750> I<00:02:57.019> will<00:02:57.290> say<00:02:57.560> yes<00:02:57.799> use<00:02:58.519> a

00:02:58.709 --> 00:02:58.719 
disadvantage so I will say yes use a

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:01.360 
disadvantage so I will say yes use a
constant<00:02:59.719> tension<00:02:59.900> on<00:03:00.200> the<00:03:00.349> incline<00:03:00.709> bench<00:03:00.739> I

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
constant tension on the incline bench I

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.759 
constant tension on the incline bench I
was<00:03:02.060> a<00:03:02.090> little<00:03:02.450> weaker<00:03:02.840> and<00:03:03.019> it<00:03:03.200> made<00:03:03.620> the

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
was a little weaker and it made the

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:06.190 
was a little weaker and it made the
exercise<00:03:04.280> a<00:03:04.310> lot<00:03:04.669> harder<00:03:05.000> not<00:03:05.329> only<00:03:05.689> that<00:03:05.930> I

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
exercise a lot harder not only that I

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.280 
exercise a lot harder not only that I
had<00:03:06.799> the<00:03:07.040> most<00:03:07.069> epic<00:03:07.549> pump<00:03:08.329> I've<00:03:08.480> ever<00:03:08.689> had<00:03:09.019> on

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
had the most epic pump I've ever had on

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:10.030 
had the most epic pump I've ever had on
the<00:03:09.379> bench<00:03:09.560> press

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
the bench press

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.610 
the bench press
I'm<00:03:10.250> on<00:03:10.969> for<00:03:11.269> chest<00:03:11.569> was<00:03:11.810> just<00:03:12.169> throbbing

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
I'm on for chest was just throbbing

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.009 
I'm on for chest was just throbbing
aching<00:03:13.579> full<00:03:14.299> of<00:03:14.449> blood

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019

aching full of blood
I've<00:03:15.139> never<00:03:15.680> experienced<00:03:16.489> a<00:03:16.519> pump<00:03:16.819> that<00:03:17.030> good

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
I've never experienced a pump that good

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:19.390 
I've never experienced a pump that good
at<00:03:17.599> a<00:03:17.629> long<00:03:17.840> time<00:03:18.199> only<00:03:18.620> time<00:03:18.829> I<00:03:18.919> give<00:03:19.099> a<00:03:19.129> pump

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
at a long time only time I give a pump

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.149 
at a long time only time I give a pump
that<00:03:19.489> good<00:03:19.849> it's<00:03:20.540> when<00:03:20.780> I<00:03:20.810> do<00:03:20.959> chest<00:03:21.560> flies<00:03:22.989> but

00:03:24.149 --> 00:03:24.159 
that good it's when I do chest flies but

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:26.770 
that good it's when I do chest flies but
I'm<00:03:25.159> gonna<00:03:25.489> continue<00:03:25.879> to<00:03:26.060> use<00:03:26.180> a<00:03:26.299> full<00:03:26.540> range

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
I'm gonna continue to use a full range

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:31.000 
I'm gonna continue to use a full range
of<00:03:26.900> motion<00:03:27.079> and<00:03:27.379> let<00:03:27.500> me<00:03:27.680> explain<00:03:29.709> this<00:03:30.709> is<00:03:30.919> a

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
of motion and let me explain this is a

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.429 
of motion and let me explain this is a
compound<00:03:31.639> movement<00:03:31.879> meaning<00:03:32.449> it's<00:03:32.780> a<00:03:32.930> multi

00:03:33.429 --> 00:03:33.439 
compound movement meaning it's a multi

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:36.399 
compound movement meaning it's a multi
joint<00:03:33.500> movement<00:03:34.430> when<00:03:35.060> you<00:03:35.299> use<00:03:35.989> a<00:03:36.019> weight

00:03:36.399 --> 00:03:36.409 
joint movement when you use a weight

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:38.140 
joint movement when you use a weight
that's<00:03:36.889> heavy<00:03:37.159> I'm<00:03:37.370> not<00:03:37.489> talking<00:03:37.760> about<00:03:37.790> like
