00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:17.699
 And so good, see you, patrick and today. 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.730
 I'll show you how to solve the 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.800
 problem with the microphone down on the 12 x 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.019
 bacon realtek audio 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.170
 Good guys, I bought a new head set. 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.119
 and then I was recording the audios on it 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.260
 to test, to see if everything was 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.630
 right 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.530
 and then I saw that the eyes were very 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.260
 low 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.690
 I even thought it was defective and such 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.320
 So I went to give it a look. 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:48.000
 there I found that the defendant audio tech it 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:50.399
 Comes with by default it comes down then 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.550
 you have to manually configure 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:56.340
 however on some computers 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.309
 his configuration is different so I 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.469
 I'll teach you how to set the o 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.420
 defendant tech audio beauty 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.780
 good first thing people will use the 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.950
 windows xp method to increase the 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.869
 microphone 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.729
 Of course I do not think it will work. 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.960
 with a lot of people so it is not 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:19.140
 searched on my video then I 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.369
 followed by teaching how to set up the 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.240
 tech defendant 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.670
 good come on first come start panel 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.490
 of control 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:31.979
 speak audio device sounds you see 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.509
 here is to adjust the system volume it 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:38.490
 will open your window 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:40.470
 you come voice and good volume here 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.270
 I usually think it's over here. 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.430
 or six will increase in the last 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.710
 leaves very high 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.740
 if I have the option to increase these 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.659
 Here O increases as well which helps the 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.820
 My, how many do I think a lot of people do? 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.479
 you will not be able to increase these 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.880
 three 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.159
 sometimes it has even more but can not really 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.060
 increase then keep this here in the 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.430
 last 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.969
 you will feel a small difference 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.810
 but it will not be as big as the defendant 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.679
 tech 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:13.650
 I'm going to close it and give it a go and that's it. 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:16.049
 now we will manage by realtek 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.269
 to manage by alltech we come 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:21.450
 here is the smallest audio manager 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:24.810
 realtek may be setting it up 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.849
 also if you do not have here 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.720
 this icon you may be seeing here in 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:30.750
 shopping mall 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.849
 he also has both does not make the slightest 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.670
 difference 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:39.659
 You will open it, it will open the 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.780
 window close here good it's right here it 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:48.480
 will open this interface 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:52.440
 You 'll come here right mixer to record 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:56.459
 is at most one right here does not have 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:58.680
 option to increase the defendant tec to 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.900
 some have options for others not 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.299
 in my case I have no option of 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:07.709
 increase what we will do to people 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:09.599
 it will not set on recording the 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.220
 Funny is this is not burning in 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:14.609
 reproduction 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:17.760
 So we'll pass this one to the 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:20.819
 last screen as the last screen 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:25.650
 well I took a print as it comes from 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:29.879
 standard it does not come with both 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:35.340
 marked x2 right down you go 

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:41.000
 to make you uncheck x nÃ© 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:43.919
 Grandpa bauchi for you to see the difference 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.290
 of a difference in the microphone 

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:47.549
 We're going to mark this one here. 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.310
 as he will be down here you 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:52.680
 increase in the last month will feel 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:55.620
 a small difference but it is not so much 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:59.190
 still the difference is here 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:02.400
 these two advanced little dots are going 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:04.889
 apply and was ticked this increase option 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.760
 the sensitivity of the microphone and give 

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:07.919
 OK 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:11.639
 When you got ok, you'll feel the 

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:14.840
 largest possible difference will increase 

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:18.419
 A lot of the microphone will be very good. 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.199
 so the staff is this is super simple 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:23.130
 huh 

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:26.460
 It is super easy to not work still 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.210
 continue below you uncheck and make yourself 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.539
 the same thing 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:33.449
 here I did that in the hair pink on you 

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:36.720
 does the front pink on you will increase 

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:40.229
 at most it will uncheck the Chinese and 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:43.949
 comes here and in the advanced and brand 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:47.699
 I do not recommend this box very much. 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:51.810
 option because why this option leaves 

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:54.419
 very upset and very scandalous 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:57.120
 So it's for who's in big trouble. 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:05:00.750
 audio beauty for those who managed to 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:04.110
 with this option here it looks great but 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:06.990
 if you fail to have with you 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:08.460
 this beauty just this a personal video 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:10.560
 very fast class 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:12.919
 It's just that I'm staying here if 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:16.229
 register on the channel of your home that 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:18.000
 favorite and always ask for video lessons there 

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:22.169
 What are you doing? 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.759
 So I said, people, thank you, Brigadio. 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:26.120
 I'm going to stay here and say 

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:26.120
 thanks
