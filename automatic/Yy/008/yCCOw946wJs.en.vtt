00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
bit of Loctite and apply just a thin dab

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.780 
bit of Loctite and apply just a thin dab
of<00:05:28.110> it<00:05:28.230> went<00:05:28.950> to<00:05:29.040> one<00:05:29.130> of<00:05:29.160> the<00:05:29.280> bullet<00:05:29.520> ends

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:29.790 
of it went to one of the bullet ends

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:31.310 
of it went to one of the bullet ends
then<00:05:29.970> making<00:05:30.240> sure<00:05:30.360> that<00:05:30.630> your<00:05:30.720> both<00:05:30.990> end<00:05:31.169> is

then making sure that your both end is
like<00:05:32.100> all<00:05:32.280> bolts<00:05:32.610> that<00:05:32.760> we're<00:05:32.850> gonna

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:32.970 
like all bolts that we're gonna

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:35.750 
like all bolts that we're gonna
reinstall<00:05:33.480> nice<00:05:33.720> and<00:05:33.930> clean<00:05:34.340> which<00:05:35.340> Dave<00:05:35.580> is

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.370 
grab it as Loctite more more time

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:42.890 
grab it as Loctite more more time
double-checking<00:05:42.000> that<00:05:42.150> it's<00:05:42.360> nice<00:05:42.540> and<00:05:42.570> clean

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:42.900

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:48.220 
let's see it a bigger camp

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:50.100 
let's see it a bigger camp
and<00:05:48.970> you<00:05:49.330> know<00:05:49.450> the<00:05:49.540> wife<00:05:49.690> doesn't<00:05:49.900> know<00:05:50.050> and

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:18.940 
Freight variety is not the greatest if

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.990 
Freight variety is not the greatest if
you're<00:06:19.090> working<00:06:19.300> with<00:06:19.480> iron<00:06:19.870> block<00:06:20.880> you<00:06:21.880> know

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:22.000 
you're working with iron block you know

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.850 
you're working with iron block you know
you<00:06:22.060> don't<00:06:22.420> have<00:06:22.540> to<00:06:22.660> be<00:06:22.750> quite<00:06:23.020> as<00:06:23.290> precise

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:23.860 
you don't have to be quite as precise

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:25.830 
you don't have to be quite as precise
but<00:06:24.490> with<00:06:24.670> heads<00:06:24.910> you<00:06:25.150> definitely<00:06:25.570> want<00:06:25.720> to<00:06:25.750> be

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:25.840 
but with heads you definitely want to be

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:27.960 
but with heads you definitely want to be
precise<00:06:26.200> with<00:06:26.710> this<00:06:26.860> type<00:06:27.070> of<00:06:27.100> stuff<00:06:27.430> it's<00:06:27.610> 18

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:27.970

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:33.940 
you know like I said with iron it's

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:36.420 
you know like I said with iron it's
really<00:06:34.240> you<00:06:35.230> know<00:06:35.380> not<00:06:35.740> as<00:06:36.010> long<00:06:36.190> as<00:06:36.250> your

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:36.430 
really you know not as long as your

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:38.310 
really you know not as long as your
closer<00:06:36.670> your<00:06:37.030> okay<00:06:37.240> but<00:06:37.450> I<00:06:37.600> always<00:06:37.900> go<00:06:38.110> by<00:06:38.260> the

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:38.320 
closer your okay but I always go by the

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:39.870 
closer your okay but I always go by the
torque<00:06:38.590> specs<00:06:38.920> just<00:06:39.010> because<00:06:39.430> we<00:06:39.610> don't<00:06:39.760> want

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:39.880 
torque specs just because we don't want

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:41.400 
torque specs just because we don't want
anything<00:06:40.030> coming<00:06:40.330> apart<00:06:40.630> so<00:06:40.810> a<00:06:40.840> Loctite

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:41.410 
anything coming apart so a Loctite

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:44.100 
anything coming apart so a Loctite
torque<00:06:41.920> and<00:06:42.190> basically<00:06:43.150> they're<00:06:43.840> mostly

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:44.110 
torque and basically they're mostly

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:49.820 
torque and basically they're mostly
tight<00:06:44.410> so<00:06:44.650> you<00:06:44.710> want<00:06:45.010> to<00:06:45.070> just<00:06:45.160> click<00:06:46.680> click

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:49.830
