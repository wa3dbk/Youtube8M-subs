it just inspired me to do a review on
this<00:01:11.340> figure<00:01:11.820> now<00:01:12.260> I<00:01:13.260> first<00:01:13.590> didn't<00:01:14.130> have<00:01:14.580> any

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
this figure now I first didn't have any

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.370 
this figure now I first didn't have any
interest<00:01:15.690> in<00:01:15.870> this<00:01:16.080> at<00:01:16.470> all<00:01:16.850> I<00:01:17.960> just<00:01:18.960> really

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
interest in this at all I just really

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.870 
interest in this at all I just really
don't<00:01:19.500> give<00:01:19.680> two<00:01:19.860> shits<00:01:20.010> about<00:01:20.190> Black<00:01:20.640> Knight

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
don't give two shits about Black Knight

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.460 
don't give two shits about Black Knight
I<00:01:21.030> really<00:01:21.299> don't<00:01:21.780> really<00:01:22.080> care<00:01:22.260> much<00:01:22.380> about

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
I really don't really care much about

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.280 
I really don't really care much about
the<00:01:22.740> character<00:01:23.160> I<00:01:24.030> heard<00:01:24.660> that<00:01:24.780> he<00:01:24.900> was<00:01:25.020> in<00:01:25.080> the

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
the character I heard that he was in the

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.020 
the character I heard that he was in the
Avengers<00:01:25.740> at<00:01:25.860> one<00:01:25.980> point<00:01:26.190> so<00:01:26.520> I<00:01:26.550> figured<00:01:26.910> hey

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
Avengers at one point so I figured hey

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.580 
Avengers at one point so I figured hey
why<00:01:27.210> not<00:01:27.240> have<00:01:27.570> another<00:01:27.780> figure<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.230> go<00:01:28.350> in<00:01:28.470> my

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
why not have another figure to go in my

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.340 
why not have another figure to go in my
Avengers<00:01:28.980> display<00:01:29.780> but<00:01:30.780> I<00:01:30.810> just<00:01:31.080> thought<00:01:31.200> it

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
Avengers display but I just thought it

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.840 
Avengers display but I just thought it
looked<00:01:31.380> weak<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.220> I<00:01:32.250> never<00:01:32.400> really<00:01:32.640> cared

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
looked weak and I never really cared

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.010 
looked weak and I never really cared
about<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.150> character<00:01:33.540> I<00:01:33.570> know<00:01:33.690> what<00:01:33.930> the

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
about the character I know what the

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.250 
about the character I know what the
character<00:01:34.350> is<00:01:34.380> supposed<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.740> look<00:01:34.950> like<00:01:35.010> so

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:36.260 
character is supposed to look like so

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.570 
character is supposed to look like so
it's<00:01:37.260> like<00:01:37.380> after<00:01:37.680> I<00:01:37.800> opened<00:01:38.160> it<00:01:38.220> up<00:01:38.340> I<00:01:38.490> was

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580 
it's like after I opened it up I was

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:39.980 
it's like after I opened it up I was
like<00:01:38.730> oh<00:01:38.850> wow<00:01:39.030> this<00:01:39.240> is<00:01:39.390> actually<00:01:39.540> a<00:01:39.780> lot

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
like oh wow this is actually a lot

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.050 
like oh wow this is actually a lot
cooler<00:01:40.200> than<00:01:40.320> I<00:01:40.500> thought<00:01:40.710> he<00:01:40.830> was<00:01:41.040> um<00:01:41.610> this<00:01:41.910> is

I honestly think this is one of the
better<00:01:44.040> Hasbro<00:01:44.670> figures<00:01:45.120> especially<00:01:46.020> at<00:01:46.140> that

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
everything so it's you know the

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
articulation is much to be desired I'll

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.330 
articulation is much to be desired I'll
get<00:02:53.330> into<00:02:53.480> that<00:02:53.570> in<00:02:53.810> a<00:02:53.870> minute<00:02:54.020> but<00:02:54.410> um<00:02:54.560> I<00:02:54.800> think

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
get into that in a minute but um I think

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.200 
get into that in a minute but um I think
and<00:02:55.910> the<00:02:56.030> paint<00:02:56.270> detailing<00:02:56.780> is<00:02:56.900> a<00:02:57.230> bit<00:02:57.410> weak

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:58.210 
and the paint detailing is a bit weak

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:00.610 
and the paint detailing is a bit weak
my<00:02:59.210> first<00:02:59.480> ins<00:02:59.600> like<00:02:59.720> the<00:02:59.840> gray<00:03:00.110> right<00:03:00.350> here

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
my first ins like the gray right here

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:01.930 
my first ins like the gray right here
you<00:03:00.680> can<00:03:00.830> tell<00:03:01.010> there's<00:03:01.190> you<00:03:01.580> know<00:03:01.670> there's<00:03:01.850> no

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
you can tell there's you know there's no

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.240 
you can tell there's you know there's no
detail<00:03:02.330> there's<00:03:02.810> no<00:03:02.930> paint<00:03:03.230> detailing<00:03:03.860> at<00:03:04.010> all

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
detail there's no paint detailing at all

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.120 
detail there's no paint detailing at all
actually<00:03:05.060> except<00:03:05.360> for<00:03:05.570> the<00:03:05.810> the<00:03:06.170> torso<00:03:06.620> part<00:03:06.950> I

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
actually except for the the torso part I

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:08.080 
actually except for the the torso part I
guess<00:03:07.340> it's<00:03:07.490> supposed<00:03:07.580> to<00:03:07.730> be<00:03:07.850> like<00:03:08.000> this

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
guess it's supposed to be like this

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.150 
guess it's supposed to be like this
chainmail<00:03:08.600> kind<00:03:08.870> of<00:03:08.960> area<00:03:09.200> but<00:03:09.680> you<00:03:09.800> tell<00:03:09.980> this

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
chainmail kind of area but you tell this

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.980 
chainmail kind of area but you tell this
right<00:03:10.370> here<00:03:10.580> has<00:03:10.730> like<00:03:10.970> black<00:03:11.660> and<00:03:11.930> the

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:11.990

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:14.950 
right here has like black and the
creases<00:03:12.440> kind<00:03:12.800> of<00:03:13.330> so<00:03:14.330> I<00:03:14.360> thought<00:03:14.600> that<00:03:14.810> was

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:14.960 
creases kind of so I thought that was

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.040 
creases kind of so I thought that was
neat<00:03:15.200> I<00:03:15.590> thought<00:03:16.490> that's<00:03:16.610> pretty<00:03:16.910> cool<00:03:17.180> but<00:03:17.870> um

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
neat I thought that's pretty cool but um

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.200 
neat I thought that's pretty cool but um
but<00:03:18.710> overall<00:03:18.950> there's<00:03:19.220> no<00:03:19.340> paint<00:03:19.610> detailing

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:20.210 
but overall there's no paint detailing

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:23.200 
but overall there's no paint detailing
at<00:03:20.360> all<00:03:20.570> but<00:03:21.320> the<00:03:21.800> thing<00:03:22.010> is<00:03:22.040> is<00:03:22.340> that<00:03:22.370> there's

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:23.210 
at all but the thing is is that there's

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:25.300 
at all but the thing is is that there's
so<00:03:23.420> many<00:03:23.570> colors<00:03:23.900> put<00:03:24.530> on<00:03:24.650> to<00:03:24.800> this<00:03:24.920> figure

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
so many colors put on to this figure

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.330 
so many colors put on to this figure
that<00:03:25.340> you<00:03:26.120> don't<00:03:26.300> really<00:03:26.450> miss<00:03:26.780> it<00:03:26.930> so<00:03:27.170> much

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
that you don't really miss it so much

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.740 
that you don't really miss it so much
one<00:03:28.340> thing<00:03:28.490> I've<00:03:28.580> been<00:03:28.610> thinking<00:03:29.300> about<00:03:29.330> doing

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
one thing I've been thinking about doing

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.360 
one thing I've been thinking about doing
is<00:03:29.840> painting<00:03:30.200> his<00:03:30.350> belt<00:03:30.650> gold<00:03:31.040> because<00:03:31.310> I

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
is painting his belt gold because I

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.790 
is painting his belt gold because I
really<00:03:31.790> hate<00:03:32.000> this<00:03:32.180> flat<00:03:32.540> color<00:03:32.870> right<00:03:33.620> here

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:33.800 
really hate this flat color right here

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.380 
really hate this flat color right here
so<00:03:34.010> maybe<00:03:34.220> like<00:03:34.400> painting<00:03:34.880> like<00:03:35.030> the<00:03:35.180> notches

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
so maybe like painting like the notches

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.900 
so maybe like painting like the notches

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
that weird beige color it's gonna be

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.810 
that weird beige color it's gonna be
tough<00:03:51.080> doing<00:03:51.650> some<00:03:51.830> customizing<00:03:52.459> on<00:03:52.550> the<00:03:52.640> belt

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:52.820 
tough doing some customizing on the belt

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.570 
tough doing some customizing on the belt
actually<00:03:52.970> because<00:03:53.390> it's<00:03:53.709> it's<00:03:54.709> not<00:03:54.890> removable

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:55.580 
actually because it's it's not removable

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.510 
actually because it's it's not removable
at<00:03:55.760> all<00:03:55.970> so<00:03:56.450> you<00:03:56.840> could<00:03:56.959> it's<00:03:57.770> pretty<00:03:58.430> much

00:03:58.510 --> 00:03:58.520 
at all so you could it's pretty much

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.460 
at all so you could it's pretty much
glued<00:03:58.880> on<00:03:59.000> there<00:03:59.150> it<00:03:59.360> can<00:03:59.480> shift<00:04:00.020> it<00:04:00.230> around

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
glued on there it can shift it around

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.430 
glued on there it can shift it around
but<00:04:00.890> it's<00:04:01.040> glued<00:04:01.580> on<00:04:01.730> to<00:04:02.030> the<00:04:02.180> waist<00:04:02.780> there<00:04:03.110> so

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
but it's glued on to the waist there so

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.680 
but it's glued on to the waist there so
it's<00:04:03.650> not<00:04:03.800> removable<00:04:04.400> and<00:04:05.150> if<00:04:05.300> you<00:04:05.390> want<00:04:05.600> you

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690 
it's not removable and if you want you
