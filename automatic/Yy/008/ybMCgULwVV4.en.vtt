this<00:04:48.250> turn<00:04:48.580> out<00:04:48.789> it<00:04:49.720> holds<00:04:49.990> the<00:04:50.110> interface

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
this turn out it holds the interface

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.610 
this turn out it holds the interface
with<00:04:50.860> very<00:04:51.360> simple<00:04:52.360> shapes<00:04:52.630> and<00:04:52.960> very<00:04:53.199> simple

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
with very simple shapes and very simple

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.890 
with very simple shapes and very simple
constructs<00:04:54.070> yet<00:04:54.669> it<00:04:54.789> looks<00:04:54.820> alive<00:04:55.690> and

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 
constructs yet it looks alive and

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.980 
constructs yet it looks alive and
engaging<00:04:56.199> the<00:04:56.949> quick<00:04:57.159> launch<00:04:57.340> is<00:04:57.840> slanted<00:04:58.840> not

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
engaging the quick launch is slanted not

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.080 
engaging the quick launch is slanted not
just<00:04:59.199> because<00:04:59.409> we<00:04:59.530> think<00:04:59.680> it's<00:04:59.860> beautiful<00:05:00.340> it

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.090 
just because we think it's beautiful it

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.450

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
we want it to be very clear for the user
