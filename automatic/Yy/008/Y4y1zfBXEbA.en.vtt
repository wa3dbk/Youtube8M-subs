the July update for our bus project

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:14.810 
the July update for our bus project
probably<00:00:13.049> the<00:00:13.200> biggest<00:00:13.679> and<00:00:13.860> status<00:00:14.340> update

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
probably the biggest and status update

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.300 
probably the biggest and status update
since<00:00:15.179> our<00:00:15.299> last<00:00:15.480> one<00:00:15.809> is<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:16.529> bottom<00:00:16.890> of<00:00:17.190> our

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
since our last one is the bottom of our

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
radiator rusted through this is going to

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.380 
radiator rusted through this is going to
set<00:00:19.800> us<00:00:19.920> back<00:00:20.130> anywhere<00:00:20.699> from<00:00:20.850> twelve<00:00:21.180> to

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
set us back anywhere from twelve to

eighteen hundred dollars with larger

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.580 
eighteen hundred dollars with larger
than<00:00:23.760> usual<00:00:23.939> PFD<00:00:24.689> is<00:00:24.750> predicted<00:00:25.260> for<00:00:25.289> this

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
than usual PFD is predicted for this

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.679 
than usual PFD is predicted for this
year<00:00:25.859> this<00:00:26.369> may<00:00:26.640> not<00:00:26.849> set<00:00:27.029> us<00:00:27.150> back<00:00:27.359> as<00:00:27.510> much<00:00:27.630> as

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
year this may not set us back as much as

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.419 
year this may not set us back as much as
we<00:00:27.840> think<00:00:28.109> but<00:00:28.410> we'll<00:00:28.590> still<00:00:28.769> probably<00:00:29.250> leave

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
we think but we'll still probably leave

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.939 
we think but we'll still probably leave
later<00:00:29.730> than<00:00:29.939> we<00:00:30.090> thought<00:00:30.269> on<00:00:30.660> a<00:00:30.920> positive<00:00:31.920> note

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
later than we thought on a positive note

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.410 
later than we thought on a positive note
we<00:00:32.250> have<00:00:32.369> one<00:00:32.520> of<00:00:32.640> our<00:00:32.730> biggest<00:00:32.969> pieces<00:00:33.300> of
