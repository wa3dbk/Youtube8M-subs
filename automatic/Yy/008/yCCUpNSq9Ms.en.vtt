probably wondering why I'm holding my
mac<00:00:04.710> mini<00:00:05.009> well<00:00:05.250> today<00:00:05.609> I'm<00:00:05.910> gonna<00:00:06.120> be

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
mac mini well today I'm gonna be

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.230 
mac mini well today I'm gonna be
installing<00:00:06.660> 16<00:00:07.319> gigabytes<00:00:07.830> of<00:00:08.010> RAM<00:00:08.340> let's<00:00:09.000> do

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
installing 16 gigabytes of RAM let's do

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:19.609 
installing 16 gigabytes of RAM let's do
it<00:00:16.880> now<00:00:17.880> I<00:00:17.940> have<00:00:18.180> never<00:00:18.420> actually<00:00:18.750> changed<00:00:19.470> my

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
it now I have never actually changed my

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.400 
it now I have never actually changed my
ram<00:00:19.890> in<00:00:20.189> any<00:00:20.520> computer<00:00:21.090> besides<00:00:21.570> my<00:00:21.869> desktop

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
ram in any computer besides my desktop

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.359 
ram in any computer besides my desktop
so<00:00:22.439> this<00:00:22.800> is<00:00:22.949> going<00:00:23.039> to<00:00:23.130> be<00:00:23.189> a<00:00:23.220> little

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
so this is going to be a little

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.519 
so this is going to be a little
different<00:00:23.580> um<00:00:23.939> first<00:00:24.869> off<00:00:25.080> you<00:00:25.289> need<00:00:25.350> to

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
different um first off you need to

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.029 
different um first off you need to
basically<00:00:26.369> take<00:00:26.880> off<00:00:27.150> this<00:00:27.869> plastic<00:00:28.289> backing

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
basically take off this plastic backing

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.999 
basically take off this plastic backing
here<00:00:29.460> basically<00:00:29.699> by<00:00:30.029> turning<00:00:31.019> it<00:00:31.260> and<00:00:31.500> that's

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
here basically by turning it and that's

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.100 
here basically by turning it and that's
all<00:00:32.250> you<00:00:32.369> get<00:00:32.610> now<00:00:33.149> right<00:00:33.480> here<00:00:33.510> you're<00:00:34.020> going

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
all you get now right here you're going

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.720 
all you get now right here you're going
to<00:00:34.170> be<00:00:34.290> presented<00:00:34.739> with<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:35.010> ramp<00:00:35.280> right<00:00:35.610> up

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
to be presented with the ramp right up

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.240 
to be presented with the ramp right up
front<00:00:36.000> now<00:00:36.540> from<00:00:37.320> what<00:00:37.469> i<00:00:37.500> read<00:00:37.680> online<00:00:37.829> is

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
front now from what i read online is

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.220 
front now from what i read online is
just<00:00:38.399> these<00:00:38.520> two<00:00:38.760> clips<00:00:39.059> on<00:00:39.210> each<00:00:39.360> one<00:00:39.600> it<00:00:39.989> will

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
just these two clips on each one it will

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.080 
just these two clips on each one it will
unseat<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.829> ram<00:00:41.010> you<00:00:41.190> can<00:00:41.250> be<00:00:41.430> it<00:00:41.610> slides<00:00:41.910> up

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
unseat the ram you can be it slides up

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.090 
unseat the ram you can be it slides up
and<00:00:42.180> you<00:00:42.300> can<00:00:42.390> pull<00:00:42.629> it<00:00:42.750> out<00:00:42.870> so<00:00:43.469> exactly<00:00:43.829> what

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
and you can pull it out so exactly what

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.880 
and you can pull it out so exactly what
we<00:00:44.190> can<00:00:44.340> do<00:00:44.460> they<00:00:44.610> tell<00:00:44.850> you<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.059> be<00:00:45.180> careful

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 
we can do they tell you to be careful

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.029 
we can do they tell you to be careful
because<00:00:46.890> it's<00:00:47.280> very<00:00:47.520> easy<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:48.410> actually<00:00:49.410> snap

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
because it's very easy to actually snap

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.610 
because it's very easy to actually snap
the<00:00:50.280> clips<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:50.940> also<00:00:51.809> when<00:00:51.930> you're<00:00:52.020> doing<00:00:52.320> ram

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
the clips and also when you're doing ram

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.869 
the clips and also when you're doing ram
you<00:00:53.190> never<00:00:53.520> ever<00:00:53.879> want<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.960> touch<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:56.190> bottom

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
you never ever want to touch the bottom

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.150 
you never ever want to touch the bottom
our<00:00:58.670> gold<00:00:59.670> here<00:01:00.600> at<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.809> bottom<00:01:01.199> of<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.949> RAM

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
our gold here at the bottom of the RAM

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.219 
our gold here at the bottom of the RAM
itself<00:01:02.850> never<00:01:03.180> want<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.510> touch<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.840> actual

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
itself never want to touch the actual

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.200 
itself never want to touch the actual
connectors<00:01:04.710> down<00:01:04.920> there<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.880> you<00:01:05.970> want<00:01:06.119> to

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
connectors down there and you want to

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.719 
connectors down there and you want to
try<00:01:06.360> not<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.689> touch<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.080> RAM<00:01:07.280> period<00:01:08.280> as<00:01:08.490> much

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
try not to touch the RAM period as much

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.609 
try not to touch the RAM period as much
as<00:01:08.880> possible<00:01:09.030> because<00:01:09.450> just<00:01:09.900> it's<00:01:10.530> just

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
as possible because just it's just

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.710 
as possible because just it's just
better<00:01:10.860> for<00:01:10.979> it<00:01:11.310> I<00:01:11.490> guess<00:01:11.790> I'm<00:01:12.450> going<00:01:12.540> to<00:01:12.630> go

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
better for it I guess I'm going to go

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.260 
better for it I guess I'm going to go
ahead<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:12.960> open<00:01:13.200> up<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.770> two<00:01:14.549> sticks<00:01:15.060> of

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
ahead and open up the two sticks of

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.330 
ahead and open up the two sticks of
eight<00:01:15.570> gigabytes<00:01:16.020> each<00:01:16.350> which<00:01:16.680> is<00:01:16.799> a<00:01:16.830> total<00:01:17.220> of

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
eight gigabytes each which is a total of

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.060 
eight gigabytes each which is a total of
sixteen<00:01:17.939> gigabytes<00:01:18.509> of<00:01:18.810> RAM<00:01:19.439> I'm<00:01:19.799> actually

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
sixteen gigabytes of RAM I'm actually

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.969 
sixteen gigabytes of RAM I'm actually
really<00:01:20.490> really<00:01:21.180> excited<00:01:21.689> for<00:01:21.720> this<00:01:21.840> so<00:01:22.830> let's

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
really really excited for this so let's

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.880 
really really excited for this so let's
go<00:01:23.100> ahead<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.430> oh<00:01:24.710> I'm<00:01:25.710> already<00:01:25.890> dropping<00:01:26.369> ram

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
go ahead and oh I'm already dropping ram

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.230 
go ahead and oh I'm already dropping ram
I'm<00:01:28.890> gonna<00:01:29.070> break<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.490> RAM<00:01:29.640> right<00:01:29.850> I'm<00:01:30.030> gonna

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
I'm gonna break the RAM right I'm gonna

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.600 
I'm gonna break the RAM right I'm gonna
be<00:01:30.420> in<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.600> freaking<00:01:30.900> machine<00:01:31.200> yet<00:01:31.409> gonna<00:01:32.310> put

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
be in the freaking machine yet gonna put

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.310 
be in the freaking machine yet gonna put
it<00:01:32.700> back<00:01:32.909> in<00:01:33.150> you<00:01:33.570> just<00:01:33.780> basically<00:01:33.930> do<00:01:34.290> the
