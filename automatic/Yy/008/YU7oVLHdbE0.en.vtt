00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
at the full 30 watts which gives it a

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.640 
at the full 30 watts which gives it a
real<00:01:30.990> wide<00:01:31.560> sound<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.610> I've<00:01:33.509> set<00:01:33.840> this<00:01:34.020> pretty

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
real wide sound and I've set this pretty

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.649 
real wide sound and I've set this pretty
conservative<00:01:35.070> as<00:01:35.490> far<00:01:35.520> as<00:01:35.909> gain<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.479> you<00:01:36.540> can

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
conservative as far as gain and you can

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.569 
conservative as far as gain and you can
see<00:01:36.780> where<00:01:36.900> I<00:01:36.930> have<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.140> tone<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:38.159> volume

see where I have the tone and the volume

00:01:38.579 --> 00:02:13.910 
see where I have the tone and the volume
right<00:01:38.729> about<00:01:39.000> here<00:01:39.390> so<00:01:39.810> let's<00:01:40.020> take<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.259> listen

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.839

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:15.849 
sticking with the same tiny terror

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:19.380 
sticking with the same tiny terror
channel<00:02:16.360> let's<00:02:17.159> move<00:02:18.159> the<00:02:18.400> game<00:02:18.640> down<00:02:18.940> a<00:02:19.000> bit

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
channel let's move the game down a bit

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:41.630 
channel let's move the game down a bit
and<00:02:19.650> really<00:02:20.650> get<00:02:20.860> a<00:02:20.890> nice<00:02:21.480> clean<00:02:22.480> tone

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.039 

now<00:02:42.640> the<00:02:42.700> tiny<00:02:42.970> terror<00:02:43.209> channel<00:02:43.510> can<00:02:43.629> also<00:02:43.780> get

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.049 
now the tiny terror channel can also get

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:45.960 
now the tiny terror channel can also get
very<00:02:44.079> distorted<00:02:45.040> you<00:02:45.280> can<00:02:45.430> just<00:02:45.549> simply<00:02:45.640> just

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
very distorted you can just simply just

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.179 
very distorted you can just simply just
bump<00:02:46.420> up<00:02:46.510> the<00:02:46.689> game<00:02:46.930> I'm<00:02:47.650> going<00:02:47.829> to<00:02:47.890> move<00:02:48.010> the

bump up the game I'm going to move the
tone<00:02:48.370> a<00:02:48.400> little<00:02:48.549> bit<00:02:48.879> and<00:02:49.060> just<00:02:49.090> drop<00:02:49.720> the

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
tone a little bit and just drop the

00:02:49.870 --> 00:03:25.620 
tone a little bit and just drop the
volume<00:02:50.019> here<00:02:50.500> let's<00:02:50.950> take<00:02:51.069> a<00:02:51.129> listen

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.820 

okay<00:03:26.630> so<00:03:26.870> let's<00:03:27.110> hear<00:03:27.260> the<00:03:27.380> tiny<00:03:27.590> Terra

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830 
okay so let's hear the tiny Terra

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:29.830 
okay so let's hear the tiny Terra
channel<00:03:28.310> once<00:03:28.580> again<00:03:28.940> for<00:03:29.240> reference<00:03:29.660> and

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
channel once again for reference and

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.870 
channel once again for reference and
then<00:03:29.990> simply<00:03:30.680> by<00:03:30.800> flipping<00:03:31.130> the<00:03:31.370> switch<00:03:31.400> I'll

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
then simply by flipping the switch I'll

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.480 
then simply by flipping the switch I'll
go<00:03:32.150> right<00:03:32.420> to<00:03:32.660> the<00:03:33.200> fat<00:03:33.410> channel<00:03:33.800> so<00:03:34.250> here's<00:03:34.430> a

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:34.490

tiny<00:03:34.670> chair<00:03:34.910> of<00:03:35.030> channel

00:03:59.589 --> 00:03:59.599 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:01.780 

the<00:04:00.560> fat<00:04:00.769> Channel<00:04:01.069> certainly<00:04:01.430> gives<00:04:01.640> you<00:04:01.760> a

00:04:36.239 --> 00:04:36.249 
bring it back to where it was meant to

00:04:36.249 --> 00:05:10.050 
bring it back to where it was meant to
be<00:04:36.520> a<00:04:36.849> liquid<00:04:37.360> distortion<00:04:38.139> channel

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060
