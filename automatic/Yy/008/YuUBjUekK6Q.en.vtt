00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.640 

the<00:00:12.280> wascally<00:00:12.490> wabbit<00:00:13.090> the<00:00:13.720> rabbit<00:00:14.020> target<00:00:14.500> a

the wascally wabbit the rabbit target a

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:17.430 
the wascally wabbit the rabbit target a
lot<00:00:15.160> of<00:00:15.340> people<00:00:15.700> who<00:00:16.030> horrified<00:00:16.540> by<00:00:17.080> them<00:00:17.320> they

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:17.440 
lot of people who horrified by them they

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.730 
lot of people who horrified by them they
turn<00:00:17.650> the<00:00:17.770> corner<00:00:18.160> see<00:00:18.550> a<00:00:18.580> rabbit<00:00:18.850> station<00:00:19.450> and

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
turn the corner see a rabbit station and

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.410 
turn the corner see a rabbit station and
they<00:00:20.740> just<00:00:20.920> go<00:00:21.070> to<00:00:21.130> pieces<00:00:21.430> and<00:00:22.029> yet<00:00:22.240> it's

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:22.420 
they just go to pieces and yet it's

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.090 
they just go to pieces and yet it's
probably<00:00:22.600> one<00:00:22.869> of<00:00:22.900> the<00:00:23.050> simplest<00:00:23.350> targets<00:00:23.950> on

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:24.100 
probably one of the simplest targets on

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.430 
probably one of the simplest targets on
the<00:00:24.190> Clay's<00:00:24.400> course<00:00:24.730> what<00:00:25.720> makes<00:00:25.960> it<00:00:26.200> so

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:26.440 
the Clay's course what makes it so

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.290 
the Clay's course what makes it so
difficult<00:00:26.740> to<00:00:27.190> read<00:00:27.400> is<00:00:27.669> the<00:00:28.180> only

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:28.300 
difficult to read is the only

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.790 
difficult to read is the only
predictable<00:00:28.869> thing<00:00:29.080> about<00:00:29.259> a<00:00:29.320> rabbit<00:00:29.680> is

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:29.800 
predictable thing about a rabbit is

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.910 
predictable thing about a rabbit is
unpredictability<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:31.630> course<00:00:31.930> is<00:00:32.200> where

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:32.920 
unpredictability the course is where

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.310 
unpredictability the course is where
it's<00:00:33.040> bowled<00:00:33.340> over<00:00:33.580> is<00:00:34.000> rough<00:00:34.450> and<00:00:34.930> it<00:00:35.079> can

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:35.320 
it's bowled over is rough and it can

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.950 
it's bowled over is rough and it can
bounce<00:00:35.770> and<00:00:36.100> undulate<00:00:36.490> and<00:00:36.550> hop<00:00:37.000> along<00:00:37.360> this

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:37.960 
bounce and undulate and hop along this

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.990 
bounce and undulate and hop along this
is<00:00:38.020> compounded<00:00:38.530> by<00:00:38.829> the<00:00:39.040> ground<00:00:39.370> being<00:00:39.640> shot

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.000 
is compounded by the ground being shot

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.710 
is compounded by the ground being shot
up<00:00:40.030> by<00:00:40.780> the<00:00:41.520> shots<00:00:42.520> the<00:00:42.790> previous<00:00:43.210> shots<00:00:43.510> have

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:43.720 
up by the shots the previous shots have

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.690 
up by the shots the previous shots have
scarred<00:00:44.080> the<00:00:44.260> earth<00:00:44.410> and<00:00:44.710> also<00:00:45.280> there's<00:00:45.580> a

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:45.700 
scarred the earth and also there's a

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.790 
scarred the earth and also there's a
debris<00:00:46.060> from<00:00:46.210> the<00:00:46.360> broken<00:00:46.570> rabbits<00:00:47.080> and<00:00:47.290> so

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:47.800 
debris from the broken rabbits and so

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.550 
debris from the broken rabbits and so
the<00:00:48.190> rabbit<00:00:48.550> is<00:00:48.730> going<00:00:49.330> to<00:00:49.420> be<00:00:49.560> unpredictable

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:50.560 
the rabbit is going to be unpredictable

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.640 
the rabbit is going to be unpredictable
so<00:00:51.160> the<00:00:51.310> best<00:00:51.520> way<00:00:51.700> to<00:00:51.730> tackle<00:00:52.090> this<00:00:52.510> is<00:00:53.320> to

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:53.650 
so the best way to tackle this is to

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.620 
so the best way to tackle this is to
shoot<00:00:53.890> the<00:00:54.460> feet<00:00:54.730> off<00:00:54.940> the<00:00:55.120> rabbit<00:00:55.450> and

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:55.630 
shoot the feet off the rabbit and

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.690 
shoot the feet off the rabbit and
another<00:00:56.440> reason<00:00:56.680> for<00:00:56.920> this<00:00:57.220> is<00:00:57.430> the<00:00:57.550> way<00:00:57.670> a

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:57.700 
another reason for this is the way a

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.420 
another reason for this is the way a
shotgun<00:00:58.060> set<00:00:58.570> up<00:00:58.860> sixty<00:00:59.860> percent<00:01:00.010> of<00:01:00.340> the

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:00.430 
shotgun set up sixty percent of the

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.400 
shotgun set up sixty percent of the
pattern<00:01:00.820> or<00:01:01.000> two-thirds<00:01:01.660> is<00:01:01.930> above<00:01:02.260> the

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.410 
pattern or two-thirds is above the

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.320 
pattern or two-thirds is above the
horizontal<00:01:02.500> the<00:01:03.160> ribbon<00:01:03.490> one-third<00:01:03.970> below

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.330 
horizontal the ribbon one-third below

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.539 
horizontal the ribbon one-third below
sixty<00:01:04.930> forty<00:01:05.199> or<00:01:05.470> two-thirds<00:01:05.979> one-third

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:06.549 
sixty forty or two-thirds one-third

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:08.990 
sixty forty or two-thirds one-third
if<00:01:06.729> you<00:01:07.330> shoot<00:01:07.600> directly<00:01:07.930> at<00:01:08.290> the<00:01:08.500> rabbit

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
if you shoot directly at the rabbit

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.340 
if you shoot directly at the rabbit
what's<00:01:10.000> happening<00:01:10.420> is<00:01:10.540> two-thirds<00:01:11.080> of<00:01:11.259> your

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
what's happening is two-thirds of your

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.560 
what's happening is two-thirds of your
patterns<00:01:11.740> going<00:01:12.040> over<00:01:12.280> the<00:01:12.400> top<00:01:12.580> its<00:01:13.000> wasted

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
patterns going over the top its wasted

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.390 
patterns going over the top its wasted
so<00:01:13.990> you're<00:01:14.080> only<00:01:14.229> shooting<00:01:14.500> with<00:01:14.770> 1/3<00:01:15.070> of<00:01:15.220> your

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:15.400 
so you're only shooting with 1/3 of your

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.370 
so you're only shooting with 1/3 of your
load<00:01:15.549> whereas<00:01:16.390> if<00:01:16.509> you<00:01:16.600> shoot<00:01:16.840> the<00:01:16.990> feet<00:01:17.229> of

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
load whereas if you shoot the feet of

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.190 
load whereas if you shoot the feet of
the<00:01:17.499> rabbit<00:01:17.859> now<00:01:18.570> sixty<00:01:19.570> percent<00:01:19.719> of<00:01:20.109> that

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
the rabbit now sixty percent of that

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.260 
the rabbit now sixty percent of that
pattern<00:01:20.499> will<00:01:20.950> hit<00:01:21.159> the<00:01:21.340> target<00:01:21.549> and<00:01:21.850> the<00:01:21.939> 40

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
pattern will hit the target and the 40

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:23.819 
pattern will hit the target and the 40
percent<00:01:22.390> will<00:01:22.869> bounce<00:01:23.140> up<00:01:23.350> off<00:01:23.530> the<00:01:23.649> ground

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:23.829 
percent will bounce up off the ground

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:25.529 
percent will bounce up off the ground
picking<00:01:24.310> up<00:01:24.429> debris<00:01:24.670> increasing<00:01:25.390> your

00:01:25.529 --> 00:01:25.539 
picking up debris increasing your

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:28.590 
picking up debris increasing your
pattern<00:01:25.869> and<00:01:26.729> effectively<00:01:27.729> breaking<00:01:28.359> the

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
pattern and effectively breaking the

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.870 
pattern and effectively breaking the
target<00:01:29.020> cleanly<00:01:29.380> the<00:01:29.920> other<00:01:30.039> benefit<00:01:30.549> is<00:01:30.579> if

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
target cleanly the other benefit is if

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.149 
target cleanly the other benefit is if
the<00:01:31.030> rabbit<00:01:31.329> should<00:01:31.569> bounce<00:01:31.979> you've<00:01:32.979> got<00:01:33.130> a

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 
the rabbit should bounce you've got a

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:34.830 
the rabbit should bounce you've got a
good<00:01:33.399> look<00:01:33.609> at<00:01:33.729> it<00:01:33.850> and<00:01:33.909> it<00:01:34.119> will<00:01:34.240> come<00:01:34.509> up<00:01:34.539> and

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
good look at it and it will come up and

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.330 
good look at it and it will come up and
you<00:01:34.929> can<00:01:34.960> move<00:01:35.259> to<00:01:35.469> it<00:01:35.590> and<00:01:35.710> shoot<00:01:35.950> it<00:01:36.130> if

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
you can move to it and shoot it if

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.219 
you can move to it and shoot it if
you're<00:01:37.060> shooting<00:01:37.479> at<00:01:37.600> the<00:01:37.719> center<00:01:38.079> of<00:01:38.109> the

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.229 
you're shooting at the center of the

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:39.840 
you're shooting at the center of the
rabbit<00:01:38.560> what's<00:01:38.740> going<00:01:38.920> to<00:01:38.950> happen<00:01:39.310> now<00:01:39.460> is<00:01:39.670> if

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
rabbit what's going to happen now is if

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.239 
rabbit what's going to happen now is if
it<00:01:40.210> bounces<00:01:40.389> it<00:01:41.049> makes<00:01:41.409> you<00:01:41.590> flinch<00:01:41.920> and<00:01:42.130> you

00:01:42.239 --> 00:01:42.249 
it bounces it makes you flinch and you

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:44.700 
it bounces it makes you flinch and you
usually<00:01:42.429> pork<00:01:42.880> and<00:01:43.090> hole<00:01:43.240> put<00:01:43.450> it<00:01:43.569> now<00:01:44.350> rabbits

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
usually pork and hole put it now rabbits

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.709 
usually pork and hole put it now rabbits
look<00:01:44.979> very<00:01:45.429> very<00:01:45.670> quickly<00:01:45.999> and<00:01:46.329> it's<00:01:46.420> because

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:46.719 
look very very quickly and it's because

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:49.139 
look very very quickly and it's because
of<00:01:46.840> background<00:01:47.409> if<00:01:48.069> I<00:01:48.219> could<00:01:48.429> put<00:01:48.579> a<00:01:48.609> standard

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:49.149 
of background if I could put a standard

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:50.819 
of background if I could put a standard
trap<00:01:49.389> next<00:01:49.749> to<00:01:49.810> the<00:01:49.929> rabbit<00:01:50.229> trap<00:01:50.439> and<00:01:50.649> throw<00:01:50.799> a

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:50.829 
trap next to the rabbit trap and throw a

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:53.219 
trap next to the rabbit trap and throw a
low<00:01:51.069> clay<00:01:51.399> you<00:01:51.909> would<00:01:52.060> say<00:01:52.299> just<00:01:52.569> I<00:01:52.780> slowed<00:01:53.079> the

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
low clay you would say just I slowed the

00:01:57.369 --> 00:01:59.309 
sky the clay in the sky has no
background<00:01:57.880> so<00:01:58.060> it<00:01:58.179> looks<00:01:58.389> slower<00:01:58.659> whereas<00:01:59.289> a

00:01:59.309 --> 00:01:59.319 
background so it looks slower whereas a

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:01.529 
background so it looks slower whereas a
rabbit<00:01:59.709> passing<00:02:00.189> against<00:02:00.579> the<00:02:00.729> background<00:02:01.389> of

so most rabbits because of our shotgun

I missed hiring in front this is

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.490 
I missed hiring in front this is
compounded<00:02:15.670> by<00:02:15.970> the<00:02:16.540> shot<00:02:16.810> string<00:02:17.140> it<00:02:17.260> in<00:02:17.410> the

compounded by the shot string it in the

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:24.159 
it's being missed behind and people

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:25.500 
it's being missed behind and people
increasingly<00:02:24.909> miss

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
increasingly miss

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:30.549 
secret to the rabbit is to hit just the

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:34.229 
secret to the rabbit is to hit just the

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
front leg off in other ways if it was

front leg off in other ways if it was
stretching<00:02:34.599> any<00:02:34.959> lettuce<00:02:35.260> patch<00:02:35.650> just<00:02:36.489> take

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
stretching any lettuce patch just take

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.240 
stretching any lettuce patch just take
his<00:02:36.849> paw<00:02:37.120> off<00:02:37.180> and<00:02:37.569> so<00:02:38.200> you<00:02:38.260> keep<00:02:38.560> it<00:02:38.739> low<00:02:38.950> and

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
his paw off and so you keep it low and

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.860 
his paw off and so you keep it low and
you<00:02:39.640> just<00:02:39.790> shoot<00:02:40.060> at<00:02:40.239> the<00:02:40.329> front<00:02:40.540> edge<00:02:40.689> of<00:02:40.810> the
