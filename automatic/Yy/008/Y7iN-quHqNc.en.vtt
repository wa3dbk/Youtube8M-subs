00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 hello everybody else were missing you 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.560
 of the children of prescriptions and today I go 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.670
 teach you guys are going to make croquettes 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.059
 ground meat 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.059
 come on 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:48.380
 In the beginning, we'll put two 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:50.210
 spoons of olive oil in a pan 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.950
 on low heat 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:56.090
 this milk so that we can 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:57.860
 facilitate our ground beef then two 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.989
 pillars or cushion 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.720
 then we'll put ground beef and 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:05.180
 using first-fifth-gram food 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.640
 You can use meat you want and 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.350
 If you will use it, you will not 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.450
 increases the other ingredients 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.700
 I usually giving it to mix 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.690
 the olive oil and to make adding 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.640
 integers 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.680
 you can be a seasoning that you want 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.560
 I'm wearing mine on my 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:26.420
 preferably as oregano garlic 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:28.670
 the lemon juice, anyway, what I like about 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.770
 my ground beef but you can put 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.539
 for example onion that I have not put 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.310
 because I do not like 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:38.210
 anyway whatever you want 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:40.789
 add that single red that I 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.530
 I introduced him there he is to change the rope 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:44.660
 ground meat drop a little 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.630
 but my, then it's worth you 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:50.479
 look at the market because it's me 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:53.000
 I suggest a super good tip so it's just 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:55.069
 add rye always stirring 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.229
 everybody mix with what he accepts 

00:01:55.069 --> 00:02:01.369
 mixing with the meat can 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:03.950
 meat is already getting deep fried had 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:06.619
 then is this intention 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.750
 the salt also it is totally august 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:10.849
 You actually with the seasonings are 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.250
 August then it is the amount that you 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:13.700
 like or who prefer targeted in 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.090
 P 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.430
 we put a glass of water and 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:22.120
 the window to let this meat and 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.800
 kitchen and after 15 minutes we 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.750
 tam will take we still have to 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.150
 leaving a little a little follows 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.670
 the water in the pan to function 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.519
 a cup of wheat flour this water 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.920
 that's left in the shins, the quinoon it goes 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:39.459
 help us to take the ground meat 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.680
 with paulinha if we do not leave 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:45.190
 I'm really very difficult to 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:48.459
 make the alloy between the fault is milled 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:52.540
 So it's just there and messing around and messing with the 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:54.340
 Stop the league, there to make it cool. 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.099
 will be thinking that you're fine 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:00.010
 in the video loosening in the pan is a 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:02.049
 really clay and you know it's good 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.120
 when it gives you to put in the hand and 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:07.329
 roll and does not change in your mouth 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.489
 We'll leave it in a tracey bowl and 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:12.099
 so we would be pretty well do not need 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:14.739
 to be totally extinct 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:17.200
 and when it is warm to 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:20.500
 cold we will next step that is 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.700
 curl what you can go there in the format 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.230
 what you want 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.299
 what do we have a traditional bar 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.299
 which is what I did you want to do 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:30.609
 balls with meatballs or any other 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:33.250
 style you can then that will roll 

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:36.220
 super easy as croquette and we will go 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:38.730
 Rolling the whole mass is smoke that I did 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.049
 in the format that I did my 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.940
 approximately 30 any 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:44.260
 If you want to have a party, you have to 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.739
 make it a little smaller 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:52.230
 I was doing for jolio or without 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:52.230
 which is then made a larger size 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:07.950
 done that we will pass an egg 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.770
 that which separates us in commerce 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:14.100
 clean it so by mixing everything 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:16.140
 as if to do as if to speak 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:19.110
 the truth is deceiving that in the same 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:22.230
 thing then almost a man and then the 

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:25.860
 People will pass on the flour 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:28.350
 So it's super simple and that 's what 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:32.640
 gives a taste of the differential croquette of the 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:35.700
 croquette for me this is so it's super 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:39.270
 can only flour the egg that in the 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:42.480
 flour to I use an entire egg has 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:44.010
 people who used only rowing just so I like 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.860
 to pass an entire egg whenever I 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:48.540
 I'll cheat anything so I 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:51.120
 in this case I used the new inter too 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:51.990
 are all our croquettes in 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.610
 stoppages 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.790
 If you do not want to be on time, you 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:59.490
 can put in the freezer just like a coxinha 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:02.010
 You know but if you want to stay on the hour is 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:03.870
 just fry then fry too much 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:06.450
 simple no secret we put 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:10.170
 in a frying pan with plenty of oil and 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:11.640
 oil well and hot oil gets very 

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:13.080
 quick people do not have to be careful 

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:15.450
 not to burn 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:18.240
 and then it's just you come to be able to quote the two 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:20.700
 right sides think my camera 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:23.250
 affect both sides right 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:25.560
 The album just for you. I did not neglect it already. 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:30.060
 Almost anyone who cares 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:32.070
 careful not to get hurt, right? 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:34.680
 and then it's ready, I like to eat it is like this 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:37.650
 with little flowers left but you can 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:39.180
 start and then it's delicious, I hope 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:41.910
