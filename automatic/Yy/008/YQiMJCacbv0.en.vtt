movie that shows that he actually has
acting<00:01:49.130> chops<00:01:49.370> so<00:01:49.610> then<00:01:49.760> I<00:01:49.790> do<00:01:49.880> think<00:01:50.150> of

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:50.300 
acting chops so then I do think of

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.810 
acting chops so then I do think of
movies<00:01:50.480> like<00:01:50.570> 23<00:01:51.290> which<00:01:51.560> I<00:01:51.770> kind<00:01:52.370> of<00:01:52.520> dug<00:01:52.670> the

two<00:02:33.440> flawed<00:02:33.800> people<00:02:34.280> and<00:02:34.370> that's<00:02:34.430> the

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
two flawed people and that's the

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.430 
two flawed people and that's the
best-case<00:02:35.120> scenario<00:02:35.300> and<00:02:36.019> it<00:02:36.080> goes<00:02:36.170> into<00:02:36.350> the

best-case scenario and it goes into the

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.229 
best-case scenario and it goes into the
relationship<00:02:36.920> of<00:02:37.070> two<00:02:37.220> people<00:02:37.580> being<00:02:37.760> unique

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
so when someone tries to mimic the

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:41.020 
so when someone tries to mimic the
relationship<00:02:40.430> based<00:02:40.610> on<00:02:40.760> what<00:02:40.880> they<00:02:40.970> think

someone<00:02:41.390> likes<00:02:41.570> there's<00:02:41.900> usually<00:02:42.080> a

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
someone likes there's usually a

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:43.330 
someone likes there's usually a
different<00:02:42.530> outcome<00:02:42.650> because<00:02:43.010> the<00:02:43.100> chemistry

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
different outcome because the chemistry

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:44.740 
different outcome because the chemistry
between<00:02:43.580> those<00:02:43.790> two<00:02:43.970> people<00:02:44.150> is<00:02:44.450> different

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
between those two people is different

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.780 
between those two people is different
and<00:02:45.080> even<00:02:45.170> though<00:02:45.590> two<00:02:45.980> people<00:02:46.310> are<00:02:46.459> flawed

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
and even though two people are flawed

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.150 
and even though two people are flawed
and<00:02:47.120> love<00:02:47.330> is<00:02:47.480> flawed<00:02:47.870> on<00:02:48.260> a<00:02:48.320> biological<00:02:48.590> level

and love is flawed on a biological level
at<00:02:49.459> least<00:02:49.610> in<00:02:49.730> my<00:02:49.880> opinion<00:02:50.000> on<00:02:50.360> a<00:02:50.390> biological

at least in my opinion on a biological
level<00:02:51.019> it<00:02:51.260> doesn't<00:02:51.380> make<00:02:51.530> sense<00:02:51.769> for<00:02:51.830> human
