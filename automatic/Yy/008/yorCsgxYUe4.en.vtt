00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:38.200 
tasty in itself and I do like the design

tasty in itself and I do like the design
and<00:04:38.530> innovation<00:04:39.490> of<00:04:39.610> it<00:04:40.380> except<00:04:41.380> the

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
and innovation of it except the

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.880 
and innovation of it except the
execution<00:04:42.460> maybe<00:04:43.000> it's<00:04:43.780> just<00:04:44.380> need<00:04:44.710> more

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:44.890 
execution maybe it's just need more

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:48.420 
execution maybe it's just need more
