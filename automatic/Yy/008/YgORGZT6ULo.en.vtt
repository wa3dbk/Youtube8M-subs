00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
and after you add it it becomes hard to

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.070 
and after you add it it becomes hard to
beat<00:01:44.520> so<00:01:44.730> in<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:44.940> end<00:01:45.090> I<00:01:45.270> just<00:01:45.300> started<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:45.930> use

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 
beat so in the end I just started to use

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.920 
beat so in the end I just started to use
my<00:01:46.290> hands<00:01:46.680> I<00:01:47.090> added<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.180> flour<00:01:48.390> little<00:01:48.510> at<00:01:48.900> a

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
my hands I added the flour little at a

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.720 
my hands I added the flour little at a
time<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.410> make<00:01:49.440> beating<00:01:49.980> it<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.250> little<00:01:50.520> bit

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:50.730 
time to make beating it a little bit

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.870 
time to make beating it a little bit
easier<00:01:51.120> as<00:01:51.920> you<00:01:52.920> can<00:01:53.070> tell<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.370> dough<00:01:53.550> becomes

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
easier as you can tell the dough becomes

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.670 
easier as you can tell the dough becomes
pretty<00:01:54.300> thick<00:01:56.450> after<00:01:57.450> adding<00:01:58.110> all<00:01:58.230> your<00:01:58.290> file

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
pretty thick after adding all your file

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.590 
pretty thick after adding all your file
you're<00:01:58.830> going<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.010> add<00:01:59.130> 1<00:01:59.430> in<00:01:59.550> 1/4<00:01:59.970> teaspoon<00:02:00.420> of

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
you're going to add 1 in 1/4 teaspoon of

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.740 
you're going to add 1 in 1/4 teaspoon of
baking<00:02:00.930> soda<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.800> I<00:02:02.370> just<00:02:02.610> use<00:02:02.760> my<00:02:03.000> spatula<00:02:03.240> to

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
baking soda and I just use my spatula to

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.370 
baking soda and I just use my spatula to
combine<00:02:04.170> all<00:02:04.440> the<00:02:04.740> ingredients<00:02:04.770> together

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.220 

and<00:02:09.090> then<00:02:10.090> here<00:02:10.330> you<00:02:10.360> can<00:02:10.480> add<00:02:10.780> half<00:02:11.080> a

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
and then here you can add half a

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.530 
and then here you can add half a
teaspoon<00:02:11.260> of<00:02:11.770> salt<00:02:12.040> and<00:02:12.340> by<00:02:12.850> this<00:02:12.910> time<00:02:13.060> I<00:02:13.390> was

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
teaspoon of salt and by this time I was

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.670 
teaspoon of salt and by this time I was
using<00:02:13.720> my<00:02:13.930> hands<00:02:14.290> to<00:02:14.440> mix<00:02:14.590> the<00:02:14.830> dough<00:02:15.010> and<00:02:16.680> now

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
using my hands to mix the dough and now

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.170 
using my hands to mix the dough and now
it's<00:02:17.830> time<00:02:17.980> for<00:02:18.010> the<00:02:18.190> chocolate<00:02:18.640> chips<00:02:18.880> so<00:02:19.150> I

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
it's time for the chocolate chips so I

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.360
