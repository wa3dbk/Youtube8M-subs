00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
dry hair is because emo organ is

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.410 
dry hair is because emo organ is
considered<00:01:45.840> a<00:01:45.990> natural<00:01:46.380> moisturizer<00:01:47.210> so<00:01:48.210> if

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
considered a natural moisturizer so if

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.530 
considered a natural moisturizer so if
you<00:01:48.509> stuff<00:01:48.810> some<00:01:49.079> dry<00:01:49.320> hair<00:01:49.680> or<00:01:49.850> dry<00:01:50.850> scalp<00:01:51.240> and

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
you stuff some dry hair or dry scalp and

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.270 
you stuff some dry hair or dry scalp and
itchy<00:01:51.840> stock<00:01:52.259> which<00:01:52.649> you<00:01:52.829> know<00:01:52.950> that<00:01:52.979> itch

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
itchy stock which you know that itch

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.069 
itchy stock which you know that itch
might<00:01:53.610> be<00:01:53.790> due<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.390> dryness<00:01:54.659> on<00:01:54.930> your
