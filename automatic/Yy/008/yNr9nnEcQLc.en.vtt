with<00:03:50.310> the<00:03:50.400> balloons<00:03:50.640> the<00:03:50.880> minions<00:03:51.239> didn't

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
with the balloons the minions didn't

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.210

want to waste any spells or anything I

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.890 
want to waste any spells or anything I
think<00:03:53.400> I<00:03:53.430> drop<00:03:53.640> a<00:03:53.670> single<00:03:53.970> rage<00:03:54.269> just<00:03:54.600> to<00:03:54.750> sort

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
think I drop a single rage just to sort

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.840 
think I drop a single rage just to sort
of<00:03:55.019> speed<00:03:55.200> things<00:03:55.440> along<00:03:55.680> but<00:03:56.489> when<00:03:56.580> you<00:03:56.610> find

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
of speed things along but when you find

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:57.949 
of speed things along but when you find
a<00:03:56.940> base<00:03:57.060> like<00:03:57.269> this<00:03:57.420> it's<00:03:57.600> pretty<00:03:57.780> much<00:03:57.900> a

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
a base like this it's pretty much a

00:03:57.959 --> 00:03:59.600 
a base like this it's pretty much a
freebie<00:03:58.350> and<00:03:58.380> then<00:03:58.800> you<00:03:58.920> don't<00:03:59.160> need<00:03:59.340> to<00:03:59.489> use

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
freebie and then you don't need to use

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.040 
freebie and then you don't need to use
your<00:03:59.640> spells<00:04:00.060> or<00:04:00.209> your<00:04:00.330> heroes<00:04:00.690> which<00:04:00.840> is

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050 
your spells or your heroes which is

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:02.870 
your spells or your heroes which is
awesome<00:04:01.260> you<00:04:02.100> can<00:04:02.220> obviously<00:04:02.310> use<00:04:02.640> your

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
awesome you can obviously use your

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.270 
awesome you can obviously use your
heroes<00:04:03.120> to<00:04:03.209> speed<00:04:03.420> things<00:04:03.630> up<00:04:03.840> which<00:04:04.019> I<00:04:04.200> do<00:04:04.280> but

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
heroes to speed things up which I do but

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.250 
heroes to speed things up which I do but
of<00:04:05.370> course<00:04:05.580> you<00:04:05.610> don't<00:04:05.850> have<00:04:06.180> to<00:04:06.420> so<00:04:06.750> if<00:04:07.140> you

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
of course you don't have to so if you

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.720 
of course you don't have to so if you
guys<00:04:07.380> are<00:04:07.560> farming<00:04:07.950> up<00:04:08.070> here<00:04:08.370> in<00:04:08.550> these

leagues<00:04:08.970> with<00:04:09.269> l'union<00:04:09.840> then<00:04:10.049> that's<00:04:10.200> a<00:04:10.320> great

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
leagues with l'union then that's a great

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.890 
leagues with l'union then that's a great
way<00:04:10.799> to<00:04:10.860> sort<00:04:11.190> of<00:04:11.340> save<00:04:11.549> you<00:04:11.730> some<00:04:12.060> lewd<00:04:12.690> in

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
way to sort of save you some lewd in

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.370 
way to sort of save you some lewd in
some<00:04:13.170> time<00:04:13.410> by<00:04:14.340> doing<00:04:14.400> that<00:04:15.150> I<00:04:15.510> think<00:04:16.169> there's

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
some time by doing that I think there's

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.170 
some time by doing that I think there's
a<00:04:16.440> lot<00:04:16.830> of<00:04:16.859> people<00:04:17.250> farming<00:04:17.729> with<00:04:17.880> malunion

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:30.480 
he's in rage mode he gets so big I guess

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.420 
he's in rage mode he gets so big I guess
everything<00:04:30.900> gets<00:04:31.230> big<00:04:31.440> when<00:04:31.980> it's<00:04:32.130> in<00:04:32.220> rage

everything gets big when it's in rage

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.730 
everything gets big when it's in rage
mode<00:04:32.460> but<00:04:32.970> God<00:04:33.210> he's<00:04:33.480> just<00:04:33.780> he's<00:04:34.320> just<00:04:34.560> a

mode but God he's just he's just a

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.550 
mode but God he's just he's just a
lumbering<00:04:35.130> giant<00:04:35.670> um<00:04:35.850> I<00:04:36.420> think<00:04:36.510> that<00:04:37.200> what

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
lumbering giant um I think that what

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.590 
lumbering giant um I think that what
they<00:04:37.740> should<00:04:38.010> do<00:04:38.190> is<00:04:38.430> in<00:04:39.060> like<00:04:39.210> one<00:04:39.420> of<00:04:39.450> the

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
they should do is in like one of the

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.840 
they should do is in like one of the
future<00:04:39.930> updates<00:04:40.290> or<00:04:40.500> whatever<00:04:40.770> just<00:04:41.010> increase

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
future updates or whatever just increase

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.060 
future updates or whatever just increase
that<00:04:41.880> by<00:04:42.120> like<00:04:42.480> five<00:04:42.900> times<00:04:43.230> can<00:04:43.800> you<00:04:43.830> guys

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
that by like five times can you guys

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.850 
that by like five times can you guys
imagine<00:04:44.250> just<00:04:44.900> massive<00:04:45.900> barbarian<00:04:46.590> king

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
imagine just massive barbarian king

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.010 
imagine just massive barbarian king
stomping<00:04:47.520> down<00:04:47.670> buildings<00:04:48.180> and<00:04:48.390> stuff<00:04:48.510> that

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240

raid now this obviously is a really
strong<00:04:57.510> base<00:04:57.870> so<00:04:58.200> I'm<00:04:58.740> being<00:04:59.010> kind<00:04:59.160> of<00:04:59.310> ballsy

going<00:04:59.940> in<00:05:00.060> here<00:05:00.330> but<00:05:01.260> I<00:05:01.290> figured<00:05:01.620> if<00:05:01.710> I<00:05:01.800> could

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:01.950 
going in here but I figured if I could

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:03.710 
going in here but I figured if I could
get<00:05:02.130> rid<00:05:02.280> of<00:05:02.310> that<00:05:02.490> single<00:05:02.820> infernal<00:05:03.510> on<00:05:03.630> the

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
get rid of that single infernal on the

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.590 
get rid of that single infernal on the
one<00:05:03.960> side<00:05:03.990> i'd<00:05:04.470> be<00:05:04.620> pretty<00:05:04.980> good<00:05:05.310> to<00:05:05.460> go<00:05:05.640> but

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:06.600 
one side i'd be pretty good to go but

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.300 
one side i'd be pretty good to go but
then<00:05:06.720> the<00:05:06.840> other<00:05:06.870> problem<00:05:07.440> of<00:05:07.590> course<00:05:07.830> he<00:05:08.070> does

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
then the other problem of course he does

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.370 
then the other problem of course he does
only<00:05:08.610> have<00:05:08.880> two<00:05:09.150> he's<00:05:09.540> really<00:05:09.870> weird<00:05:10.050> he's

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
only have two he's really weird he's

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.320 
only have two he's really weird he's
like<00:05:10.530> a<00:05:10.560> half<00:05:10.920> town<00:05:11.220> all<00:05:11.400> ten<00:05:11.700> the<00:05:11.910> half<00:05:12.060> town

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330 
like a half town all ten the half town

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.900 
like a half town all ten the half town
all<00:05:12.450> night<00:05:12.630> but<00:05:13.500> he's<00:05:13.620> got<00:05:13.800> this<00:05:13.950> maxed<00:05:14.490> Expo

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:14.910 
all night but he's got this maxed Expo

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:17.510 
all night but he's got this maxed Expo
but<00:05:15.090> he<00:05:15.150> only<00:05:15.270> has<00:05:15.690> two<00:05:16.230> rather<00:05:16.770> than<00:05:16.920> three<00:05:17.070> I

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
but he only has two rather than three I

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.190 
but he only has two rather than three I
think<00:05:18.210> I<00:05:18.420> don't<00:05:18.600> know<00:05:18.660> I'm<00:05:18.810> trying<00:05:18.990> to<00:05:19.080> look

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:19.200 
think I don't know I'm trying to look

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.350 
think I don't know I'm trying to look
around<00:05:19.440> here<00:05:19.710> yeah<00:05:20.400> he's<00:05:20.700> sort<00:05:20.940> of<00:05:21.000> like<00:05:21.150> I

around here yeah he's sort of like I

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.000 
around here yeah he's sort of like I
think<00:05:21.600> he's<00:05:21.750> maybe<00:05:21.960> on<00:05:22.260> his<00:05:22.440> way<00:05:22.620> or<00:05:22.830> something

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.010
