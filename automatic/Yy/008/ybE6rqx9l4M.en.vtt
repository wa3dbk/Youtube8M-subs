you're gonna see as the black stake my
metallic<00:00:37.600> composite<00:00:38.290> brake<00:00:39.160> pads<00:00:39.400> are<00:00:39.520> gonna

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:39.700 
metallic composite brake pads are gonna

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.610 
metallic composite brake pads are gonna
do<00:00:39.880> everything<00:00:40.330> very<00:00:40.570> well<00:00:40.870> they<00:00:41.200> have<00:00:41.380> good

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:41.620 
do everything very well they have good

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.920 
do everything very well they have good
feel<00:00:41.890> good<00:00:41.920> performance<00:00:42.760> and<00:00:42.970> good<00:00:43.240> longevity

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:43.930 
feel good performance and good longevity

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.880 
feel good performance and good longevity
then<00:00:44.560> you<00:00:44.710> have<00:00:44.950> the<00:00:45.760> fifty<00:00:46.750> forty<00:00:47.079> compound

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890 
then you have the fifty forty compound

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.530 
then you have the fifty forty compound
now<00:00:48.070> this<00:00:48.280> is<00:00:48.460> more<00:00:48.700> of<00:00:48.790> a<00:00:48.940> specialist

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:49.540 
now this is more of a specialist

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.650 
now this is more of a specialist
compound<00:00:49.990> for<00:00:50.620> racing<00:00:51.250> purposes<00:00:51.660> you're

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660 
compound for racing purposes you're

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.810 
compound for racing purposes you're
gonna<00:00:52.750> be<00:00:52.960> able<00:00:53.200> to<00:00:53.320> get<00:00:53.470> a<00:00:53.500> lot<00:00:53.739> of<00:00:53.770> feel<00:00:54.160> a<00:00:54.550> lot

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:54.820 
gonna be able to get a lot of feel a lot

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.390 
gonna be able to get a lot of feel a lot
of<00:00:54.940> performance<00:00:55.540> very<00:00:56.380> very<00:00:56.829> aggressive

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:57.400 
of performance very very aggressive

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.060 
of performance very very aggressive
right<00:00:57.730> this<00:00:58.540> is<00:00:58.720> more<00:00:58.989> of<00:00:59.110> a<00:00:59.230> race<00:00:59.470> composite

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
right this is more of a race composite

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.220 
right this is more of a race composite
this<00:01:00.670> one<00:01:00.850> would<00:01:01.000> be<00:01:01.120> used<00:01:01.329> mostly<00:01:01.720> for<00:01:01.840> like

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.230 
this one would be used mostly for like

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.740 
this one would be used mostly for like
aggressive<00:01:02.829> trail<00:01:03.160> riding<00:01:03.520> and<00:01:03.970> downhilling

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.700 

also<00:01:07.750> want<00:01:07.930> to<00:01:07.960> make<00:01:08.110> sure<00:01:08.140> that<00:01:08.350> you<00:01:08.500> clean

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710 
also want to make sure that you clean

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.260 
also want to make sure that you clean
the<00:01:08.770> rotors<00:01:09.159> a<00:01:09.190> little<00:01:09.490> bit<00:01:09.580> very<00:01:09.880> thin

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
the rotors a little bit very thin

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.080 
the rotors a little bit very thin
sandpaper<00:01:11.110> and<00:01:11.229> a<00:01:11.320> little<00:01:11.560> bit<00:01:11.650> of<00:01:11.770> water<00:01:12.090> 400

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
sandpaper and a little bit of water 400

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.780 
sandpaper and a little bit of water 400
or<00:01:13.210> 600<00:01:13.510> grit<00:01:13.960> and<00:01:14.650> just<00:01:14.890> clean<00:01:15.310> the<00:01:15.460> rotors

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790 
or 600 grit and just clean the rotors

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.520 
or 600 grit and just clean the rotors
ever<00:01:16.150> so<00:01:16.390> slightly<00:01:16.720> and<00:01:16.990> then<00:01:17.170> you<00:01:17.380> can

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
ever so slightly and then you can

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.980 
ever so slightly and then you can
install<00:01:17.890> the<00:01:18.159> brake<00:01:18.370> pads<00:01:18.640> and<00:01:18.850> go<00:01:18.940> out<00:01:19.090> and<00:01:19.299> do

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
install the brake pads and go out and do

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
install the brake pads and go out and do
a<00:01:20.130> series<00:01:21.130> of<00:01:21.159> light<00:01:21.880> braking<00:01:22.540> procedures<00:01:23.170> so

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.010 
a series of light braking procedures so

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:25.890 
a series of light braking procedures so
what<00:01:24.190> we<00:01:24.310> usually<00:01:24.700> suggest<00:01:24.850> is<00:01:25.270> just<00:01:25.630> write<00:01:25.870> a

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:25.900 
what we usually suggest is just write a

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.590 
what we usually suggest is just write a
bicycle<00:01:26.560> up<00:01:27.100> to<00:01:27.280> like<00:01:27.430> maybe<00:01:27.670> ten<00:01:28.000> fifty<00:01:28.390> miles

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
bicycle up to like maybe ten fifty miles

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.710 
bicycle up to like maybe ten fifty miles
per<00:01:28.840> hour<00:01:28.960> and<00:01:29.740> get<00:01:30.010> on<00:01:30.130> the<00:01:30.250> brakes<00:01:30.490> all<00:01:31.030> the

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
per hour and get on the brakes all the

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.719 
per hour and get on the brakes all the
way<00:01:31.840> to<00:01:31.900> zero<00:01:32.260> and<00:01:32.530> repeat<00:01:33.130> that<00:01:33.310> braking

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
way to zero and repeat that braking

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:35.789 
way to zero and repeat that braking
procedure<00:01:33.850> like<00:01:34.360> three<00:01:34.600> or<00:01:34.720> four<00:01:34.900> times<00:01:35.080> what

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:35.799 
procedure like three or four times what

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:37.200 
procedure like three or four times what
you're<00:01:35.920> allowing<00:01:36.280> is<00:01:36.580> a<00:01:36.610> break<00:01:36.880> back<00:01:37.060> to

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
you're allowing is a break back to

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.149 
you're allowing is a break back to
varying<00:01:37.690> and<00:01:37.930> the<00:01:38.020> material<00:01:38.500> to<00:01:38.619> penny<00:01:38.830> to<00:01:39.040> the
