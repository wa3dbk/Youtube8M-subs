00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
you can see there's a full and further

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.889 
you can see there's a full and further
down<00:02:02.200> a<00:02:02.439> low<00:02:02.829> marker<00:02:03.340> and<00:02:03.520> again<00:02:04.390> we<00:02:04.539> must<00:02:04.689> make

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:04.899 
down a low marker and again we must make

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:06.510 
down a low marker and again we must make
sure<00:02:04.930> but<00:02:05.649> the<00:02:05.740> levels<00:02:06.070> are<00:02:06.219> somewhere

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
sure but the levels are somewhere

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.500 
sure but the levels are somewhere
between<00:02:06.579> the<00:02:07.270> fall<00:02:07.600> and<00:02:07.810> the<00:02:08.320> low<00:02:08.470> marker<00:02:09.510> here

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
this is the filler cap where you would

this is the filler cap where you would

the dipstick which is used to check to

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.130 
the dipstick which is used to check to
make<00:02:22.000> sure<00:02:22.060> the<00:02:22.360> car<00:02:22.569> has<00:02:22.840> the<00:02:23.020> relevant

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
make sure the car has the relevant

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.220 
make sure the car has the relevant
levels<00:02:23.650> your<00:02:24.459> examiner<00:02:24.970> will<00:02:25.120> not<00:02:25.330> ask<00:02:25.630> you<00:02:25.989> to

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
do this demonstration you would verbally

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.059 
do this demonstration you would verbally
explain<00:02:28.780> but<00:02:29.140> I'll<00:02:29.290> just<00:02:29.440> show<00:02:29.590> you<00:02:29.620> how<00:02:30.010> you

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
explain but I'll just show you how you

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:33.420 
explain but I'll just show you how you
check<00:02:30.459> but<00:02:30.880> the<00:02:30.970> levels<00:02:31.239> are<00:02:31.420> correct<00:02:32.430> when

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
check but the levels are correct when

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.729 
check but the levels are correct when
you<00:02:33.550> first<00:02:33.850> plant<00:02:34.150> the<00:02:34.330> dipstick<00:02:34.620> there<00:02:35.620> are

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
you first plant the dipstick there are

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.670 
you first plant the dipstick there are
two<00:02:35.950> loops<00:02:36.340> two<00:02:36.760> small<00:02:37.180> dots<00:02:37.510> at<00:02:37.780> the<00:02:37.840> very<00:02:38.350> end

of the dipstick now this first reading

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:43.500 
of the dipstick now this first reading
is<00:02:41.290> incorrect<00:02:42.069> as<00:02:42.340> the<00:02:42.670> oil<00:02:42.849> has<00:02:43.060> been<00:02:43.239> moving

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
is incorrect as the oil has been moving

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.330 
is incorrect as the oil has been moving
around<00:02:43.720> while<00:02:44.319> I've<00:02:44.500> been<00:02:44.680> driving<00:02:45.069> so<00:02:45.220> I'm

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
around while I've been driving so I'm

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.780 
around while I've been driving so I'm
going<00:02:45.459> to<00:02:45.489> clean<00:02:45.910> the<00:02:46.840> dipstick<00:02:47.459> petition<00:02:48.459> or

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790

going to clean the dipstick petition or
a<00:02:48.880> rag<00:02:49.200> I'm<00:02:50.200> going<00:02:50.380> to<00:02:50.440> read<00:02:50.560> it<00:02:50.739> back<00:02:50.920> in<00:02:51.100> again

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
a rag I'm going to read it back in again

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.600 
a rag I'm going to read it back in again
for<00:02:51.519> an<00:02:52.299> accurate<00:02:52.810> reading<00:02:52.989> and<00:02:53.290> the<00:02:54.130> or<00:02:54.250> level

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
for an accurate reading and the or level

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.460 
for an accurate reading and the or level
should<00:02:55.030> be<00:02:55.090> finishing<00:02:55.480> somewhere<00:02:56.049> between

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
should be finishing somewhere between

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.070 
should be finishing somewhere between
the<00:02:57.220> two<00:02:57.400> dots<00:02:57.640> and<00:02:57.850> it's<00:02:58.090> just<00:02:58.360> under<00:02:58.750> the

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
the two dots and it's just under the

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.440 
the two dots and it's just under the
high<00:02:59.260> dot<00:02:59.500> so<00:02:59.709> that's<00:02:59.860> absolutely<00:03:00.010> fine<00:03:00.760> but

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
high dot so that's absolutely fine but

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.570 
high dot so that's absolutely fine but
on<00:03:01.540> your<00:03:01.660> test<00:03:01.930> just<00:03:02.830> explain<00:03:03.130> it<00:03:03.310> so<00:03:03.519> you

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
on your test just explain it so you

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.460 
on your test just explain it so you
don't<00:03:03.670> end<00:03:03.850> up<00:03:03.940> covered<00:03:04.269> in<00:03:04.510> oil<00:03:04.630> just<00:03:05.170> before

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
don't end up covered in oil just before

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.699 
don't end up covered in oil just before
the<00:03:05.590> start<00:03:05.769> of<00:03:05.950> your<00:03:06.040> driving<00:03:06.310> test<00:03:07.290> to<00:03:08.290> let
