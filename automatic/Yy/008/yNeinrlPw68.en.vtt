00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 it is excellent for the agglos to 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:08.810
 picketing is the question we are going to 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.810
 pose and marl 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:16.320
 so yes handed it is where 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.570
 absolutely it is that michelle obama 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.920
 actively fight against obesity that 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.090
 is really a scourge in the United States 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.279
 so she had been in a school 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.689
 she came with a hula hoop and she 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.760
 did a demonstration and more 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.650
 since it was ignited is to say that 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.599
 the united states have started again 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.800
 discover and practice the hula hoop 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.390
 and it became an activity that we 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.579
 can find in a gym 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.829
 the interest is what it is 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.270
 super fun you really have to 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.219
 focus because if you're not 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.719
 concentrated the hoop falls and you 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.360
 work all the deep muscles 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:52.590
 we tried here what does this 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:54.149
 gives the game n 6 games retranslates the word 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.219
 in French it's the dance with hoops 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.530
 so we use belts 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.030
 also call you the tuft and we 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.440
 practice therefore movements that are going to 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.579
 mix a little bit with the dance a 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.680
 little bit with circus techniques 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.760
 gym and it will create the tassel 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.470
 dance 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.960
 with the hoop you will work 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.100
 early movements mainly 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.310
 at waist level so the belt 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.900
 abdominal place his greenhouse are in the 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.480
 hollow waist at the waist 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.950
 either you position your legs side to 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.990
 coast on a horizontal line that makes 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.850
 a side side motion be you 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.620
 position your legs one in front 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:33.790
 the other behind and a forward motion 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:36.420
 back then keep your feet well 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.420
 stuck to the ground 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.850
 it's very physical at the level of 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.590
 size you really have to contract and 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.420
 hold back the movement really make the 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.020
 whereabouts with the pool that 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.909
 it fits 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.580
 and suddenly they make several minutes 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:52.960
 even half an hour before it fits 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.110
 really a little moment around the 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.110
 cut 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:01.440
 then in dance we will develop 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.970
 other movements so with the arms 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.890
 with people will move the hoop 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:08.360
 everywhere on his body so we go 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.360
 really solicit all the muscles 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.810
 my muscles work the most these are 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.790
 the abs and the glutes and we feel 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.720
 well at the end of the course and but it falls 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.760
 it makes you want to do it again 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.930
 powerful maybe after work 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.849
 muscular what is interesting with 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.709
 the hoop is that we will also 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:24.299
 develop cardio so we can 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.790
 spend up to 600 calories per hour 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:28.079
 it's the equivalent of a good jogging and 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.549
 which will allow little by little 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:31.549
 improve your endurance ability 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:36.750
 we have mastered the hoop to the 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.310
 size we started to be able to 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.430
 move by taking small steps 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.959
 on the left and right side in 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.209
 back and forth 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:47.160
 courses are all public so we will 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.989
 say for people from 7 to 77 years old 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:53.010
 is a very fun activity where everyone 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:54.930
 evolves at its own pace after a session of 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.129
 course I feel rest relaxed I'm 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.650
 fit sense 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:02.239
 it gives me the punch actually have 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.239
 confessed to look before back 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:10.580
 super yeah 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:17.760
 wait wait it's a fight 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:18.599
 minnesota social crisis long the 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.040
 difference is that you have 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:21.569
 printing makes no effort it's a 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.080
 problem and that's it requires a lot of 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:23.160
 convenient 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.640
 yeah I have time I go to the beginning 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.640
 effectively 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.650
 it's a good ten years the teens 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.630
 that's what you really have to do 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.370
 a movement from front to back in 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.880
 contracting the abs continually 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.970
 yet he must look too since 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.970
 his 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.560
 a year ago his beloved is because 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.209
 you start in party turned with 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.010
 your pond make wheels what is 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:58.180
 natural we immediately want to 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.830
 do the greens the basin but must 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.550
 keep this rhythm in feast of before 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:04.720
 the back and includes contracting the 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.769
 associates can know what I have 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.480
 tried for filming 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:09.220
 yeah for five days I could not 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.230
 move then really that one feels there by 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.090
 yacine way really given burden 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.500
 you can not all anymore and you do not 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.910
 can no longer scream after your kids you 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.100
 can not do anything if you have 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:19.840
 the abs vision completely paralyzed 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.340
 for five days and there we feel 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.840
 really really understand all 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.850
 the concept muscles that's enough of before 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.729
 back shaves really keep that one 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:30.310
 back and forth morally it's a 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:32.830
 behind a canvas on the side if you 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.220
 want but it's left on 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.130
 the side 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.150
 so here it is here I have that side what 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:39.370
 is interesting because you can 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.200
 work the abs rather the 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:44.050
 find before front and back 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.490
 to present the trends s d it and 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.870
 it's really really interesting 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:51.100
 battle where they were super she has 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.270
 the advantage is that obviously it's 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.340
 cheap it's an investment it has 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:56.380
 returned to 35 euros or you invest 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.820
 in in this accessory to do it 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.320
 the abdominals he folds you can 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.990
 put in your suitcase is what is 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:04.000
 interesting then is that just the 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.620
 two movements so before back are 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.060
 now walk forward way for 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.380
 to have rain should especially the 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:10.090
 feet well anchored to the ground a little bit 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:12.039
 flexible on the knees is really 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:13.570
 make a move that's forward to 

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:15.400
 the back while contracting the abs 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:16.930
 continually otherwise it will relax 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.130
 and here we live after we can hold 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:21.099
 hours and hours and hours and 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:22.510
 hours the whole chain 10 and 600 

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:24.010
 calories per hour 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:25.479
 finally without calorie all the teams 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:27.400
 match a jogging in fact so 

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:29.470
 ten minutes a day is enough 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.200
 for the small cardio exercise 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.979
 morning we have opportunities 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.840
 try charm or at least two 

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:38.919
 she loves to an economy of 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:39.970
 the oif in psychology the wii how he 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:41.860
 must be concentrated ie cooked 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:43.000
 really on my exercise but at the same 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.689
 time I tell you that if I move on 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:50.589
 the sides 

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:54.429
 we get deconcentrated so that's it 

00:05:50.589 --> 00:05:56.439
 very well it's great then it falls on 

00:05:54.429 --> 00:05:57.729
 the side after that is the movement 

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:59.799
 forward and on the side is a little 

00:05:57.729 --> 00:06:01.389
 swayed the side but in general the 

00:05:59.799 --> 00:06:03.309
 foot technique forward and when 

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:04.929
 even easier easier since 

00:06:03.309 --> 00:06:08.709
 long on and after we can do some 

00:06:04.929 --> 00:06:11.139
 exercises after the waist can turn 

00:06:08.709 --> 00:06:12.909
 and get on and you can take some 

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:13.479
 months hoops or not you saw one 

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:15.129
 can do 

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:17.110
 it's the death of our lot and moselle 

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:18.879
 at the same time to finally turn this 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:20.259
 page and iron with new lovers 

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:22.239
 what is it 

00:06:20.259 --> 00:06:24.339
 we can really do choreography 

00:06:22.239 --> 00:06:25.899
 squeezes or even benevolent ya no 

00:06:24.339 --> 00:06:29.579
 no I do not wait because the guy 

00:06:25.899 --> 00:06:29.579
 he says she gives advice to all 

00:06:30.269 --> 00:06:35.379
 alexandre also was going to be four in 

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:36.819
 second class seeing I have not 

00:06:35.379 --> 00:06:39.879
 the option me I'll tell you that you have 

00:06:36.819 --> 00:06:41.619
 heresy m6 is auctioning a little zoom 

00:06:39.879 --> 00:06:44.679
 media bubble center rims doing that 

00:06:41.619 --> 00:06:46.749
 and that they forget guys I see there there 

00:06:44.679 --> 00:06:48.599
 I have accounts to universal comes this 

00:06:46.749 --> 00:06:52.509
 to play as well 

00:06:48.599 --> 00:06:54.489
 we play as amel to the pleasant and that's it 

00:06:52.509 --> 00:06:55.719
 yes it's good and so so what 

00:06:54.489 --> 00:06:58.629
 that this is to make shout 

00:06:55.719 --> 00:07:00.369
 scipion shoulders where we will do 

00:06:58.629 --> 00:07:01.239
 with two as I never do it the 

00:07:00.369 --> 00:07:02.429
 really asks a lot of 

00:07:01.239 --> 00:07:07.569
 coordination 

00:07:02.429 --> 00:07:09.309
 and then we have really 

00:07:07.569 --> 00:07:11.319
 arm and then after we can really 

00:07:09.309 --> 00:07:13.269
 add a really artistic touch 

00:07:11.319 --> 00:07:14.439
 to make it there it makes me majorettes me I 

00:07:13.269 --> 00:07:15.999
 I dreamed when I was little but 

00:07:14.439 --> 00:07:17.279
 done but you imagine you can 

00:07:15.999 --> 00:07:20.860
 do a month choreography how 

00:07:17.279 --> 00:07:22.139
 I am thanks for the lumbago has almost 

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:24.689
 Golden age 

00:07:22.139 --> 00:07:26.999
 I cried I see it was the humble 

00:07:24.689 --> 00:07:30.770
 good reactions maybe on this 

00:07:26.999 --> 00:07:30.770
 smile a lot of viewers
