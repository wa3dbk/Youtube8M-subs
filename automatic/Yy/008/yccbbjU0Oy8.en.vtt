all<00:00:01.920> right<00:00:02.070> everybody<00:00:02.460> I<00:00:03.170> have<00:00:04.170> here<00:00:04.529> the<00:00:05.180> RG

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
all right everybody I have here the RG

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.250 
all right everybody I have here the RG
copter<00:00:07.189> 2.6<00:00:08.269> saw<00:00:09.269> I<00:00:09.570> guess<00:00:09.870> you<00:00:09.990> could<00:00:10.080> call<00:00:10.200> it

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
copter 2.6 saw I guess you could call it

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.580 
copter 2.6 saw I guess you could call it
the<00:00:10.410> clone<00:00:10.679> of<00:00:10.710> the<00:00:11.040> actual<00:00:11.570> 2.6<00:00:12.570> from<00:00:12.780> 3d<00:00:13.110> 3d

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
the clone of the actual 2.6 from 3d 3d

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.740 
the clone of the actual 2.6 from 3d 3d
robotics<00:00:14.599> it<00:00:15.599> comes<00:00:15.809> with<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.230> new<00:00:16.470> blocks

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:17.750 
robotics it comes with the new blocks

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.470 
robotics it comes with the new blocks
GPS<00:00:18.750> and<00:00:19.260> magnetometer<00:00:20.130> over<00:00:20.910> here<00:00:21.119> it<00:00:21.330> is

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
GPS and magnetometer over here it is

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.120 
GPS and magnetometer over here it is
actually<00:00:21.869> upside<00:00:22.230> down<00:00:22.500> right<00:00:22.529> now<00:00:22.890> which

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
actually upside down right now which

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.700 
actually upside down right now which
you'll<00:00:23.279> find<00:00:23.310> out<00:00:23.609> why<00:00:23.789> in<00:00:23.850> a<00:00:24.000> second<00:00:24.390> and<00:00:24.710> here

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
you'll find out why in a second and here

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.300 
you'll find out why in a second and here
is<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.310> APM<00:00:26.970> unit<00:00:27.210> which<00:00:28.199> I<00:00:28.500> have<00:00:28.859> confirmed

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
is the APM unit which I have confirmed

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.580 
is the APM unit which I have confirmed
does<00:00:29.580> not<00:00:29.730> have<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.179> internal<00:00:31.170> compass

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
does not have the internal compass

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.620 
does not have the internal compass
because<00:00:31.920> there<00:00:32.099> is<00:00:32.189> actually<00:00:32.610> a<00:00:32.820> chip<00:00:33.210> missing

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
because there is actually a chip missing

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.790 
because there is actually a chip missing
off<00:00:33.930> of<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.260> board<00:00:35.120> so<00:00:36.230> the<00:00:37.230> problem<00:00:37.590> that<00:00:37.680> I'm

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
off of the board so the problem that I'm

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.420 
off of the board so the problem that I'm
having<00:00:37.850> is<00:00:39.469> you'll<00:00:40.469> notice<00:00:40.739> right<00:00:40.800> now<00:00:40.950> the

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
having is you'll notice right now the

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.540 
having is you'll notice right now the
system<00:00:41.790> is<00:00:42.000> facing<00:00:42.300> this<00:00:42.809> way<00:00:43.050> this<00:00:44.040> way<00:00:44.280> is

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
system is facing this way this way is

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:45.170 
system is facing this way this way is
north

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
north

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.450 
north
so<00:00:46.050> CEO<00:00:46.890> peter<00:00:47.660> north<00:00:48.660> so<00:00:49.350> I'm<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.500> rotate<00:00:49.890> west

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
so CEO peter north so I'm a rotate west

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.939 
so CEO peter north so I'm a rotate west
oh<00:00:51.110> my<00:00:52.110> did<00:00:52.170> that<00:00:52.399> perfect<00:00:54.739> everything<00:00:55.739> seems

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
oh my did that perfect everything seems

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.689 
oh my did that perfect everything seems
to<00:00:56.010> be<00:00:56.070> working<00:00:56.160> correctly<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:56.820> go<00:00:57.000> south<00:00:58.699> see

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
to be working correctly and go south see

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:05.270 
to be working correctly and go south see
South<00:01:01.039> let's<00:01:02.039> go<00:01:02.129> back<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.430> North<00:01:02.899> so<00:01:04.280> so

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
South let's go back to North so so

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.350 
South let's go back to North so so
probably<00:01:05.549> saying<00:01:05.700> yourself<00:01:05.850> well<00:01:06.210> why<00:01:06.299> don't

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
probably saying yourself well why don't

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.640 
probably saying yourself well why don't
you<00:01:06.450> just<00:01:06.570> go<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:06.750> this<00:01:06.869> initial<00:01:07.260> tab<00:01:07.409> right

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
you just go to this initial tab right

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.840 
you just go to this initial tab right
here<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:08.750> click<00:01:09.750> roll<00:01:10.200> 180<00:01:10.560> well<00:01:11.070> I've

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
here and click roll 180 well I've

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.670 
here and click roll 180 well I've
already<00:01:12.030> had<00:01:12.180> it<00:01:12.299> at<00:01:12.600> roll<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.020> 80<00:01:13.170> i<00:01:13.350> clicked

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
already had it at roll and 80 i clicked

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.399 
already had it at roll and 80 i clicked
here<00:01:13.890> which<00:01:14.490> is<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.790> PM<00:01:15.210> with<00:01:15.479> 3d<00:01:15.810> our<00:01:15.960> GPS

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
here which is a PM with 3d our GPS

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.170 
here which is a PM with 3d our GPS
compass<00:01:17.210> so<00:01:18.210> I<00:01:18.570> have<00:01:19.290> that<00:01:19.670> in<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.759> parameters

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
compass so I have that in the parameters

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.550 
compass so I have that in the parameters
right<00:01:21.360> now<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:21.840> that's<00:01:21.990> still<00:01:22.259> how<00:01:22.409> it's

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
right now and that's still how it's

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.370 
right now and that's still how it's
acting<00:01:22.920> GPS<00:01:23.670> needs<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:23.970> be<00:01:24.090> upside<00:01:24.869> down<00:01:25.080> for

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
acting GPS needs to be upside down for

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.260 
acting GPS needs to be upside down for
it<00:01:25.439> to<00:01:25.560> work<00:01:25.650> correctly<00:01:25.860> I've<00:01:26.850> even<00:01:27.119> tried

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
it to work correctly I've even tried

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.300 
it to work correctly I've even tried
this<00:01:27.600> on<00:01:28.729> none<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:30.380> you'll<00:01:31.380> you'll<00:01:31.829> see<00:01:32.130> what

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
this on none and you'll you'll see what

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.200 
this on none and you'll you'll see what
it<00:01:32.400> does<00:01:32.750> let<00:01:33.750> me<00:01:33.840> just<00:01:34.049> go<00:01:34.170> ahead<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.470> flip

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
it does let me just go ahead and flip

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:43.710 
it does let me just go ahead and flip
GPS<00:01:36.210> or<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.570> right<00:01:36.750> orientation

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.080 

so<00:01:44.440> now

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.720 

the<00:01:49.090> GPS<00:01:49.590> likes<00:01:50.590> to<00:01:50.860> point<00:01:52.350> west-northwest

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:53.730 
the GPS likes to point west-northwest

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.490 
the GPS likes to point west-northwest
whenever<00:01:54.730> I<00:01:54.790> have<00:01:55.060> none<00:01:55.420> selected<00:01:55.990> under<00:01:56.200> the

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
whenever I have none selected under the

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.600 
whenever I have none selected under the
initial<00:01:57.040> setup<00:01:58.020> so<00:01:59.020> let's<00:01:59.950> rotate<00:02:00.160> the<00:02:00.460> whole

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
initial setup so let's rotate the whole

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.780 
initial setup so let's rotate the whole
unit<00:02:01.380> you'll<00:02:02.380> notice<00:02:02.650> it<00:02:02.860> goes<00:02:03.070> south<00:02:03.400> because

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
unit you'll notice it goes south because

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.840 
unit you'll notice it goes south because
it's<00:02:03.940> using<00:02:04.090> the<00:02:04.770> geology<00:02:05.770> row<00:02:05.830> on<00:02:06.130> the<00:02:06.370> APM

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
it's using the geology row on the APM

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.160 
it's using the geology row on the APM
but<00:02:07.500> given<00:02:08.500> time<00:02:08.880> the<00:02:09.880> GPS<00:02:10.270> magnetometer<00:02:10.930> will

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
but given time the GPS magnetometer will

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.870 
but given time the GPS magnetometer will
tell<00:02:11.440> it<00:02:11.590> to<00:02:11.770> go<00:02:11.890> right<00:02:12.160> back<00:02:12.310> to<00:02:12.370> where<00:02:12.730> it<00:02:12.850> was

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
tell it to go right back to where it was

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.460 
tell it to go right back to where it was
I<00:02:13.710> don't<00:02:14.710> know<00:02:15.040> why<00:02:15.340> it<00:02:16.030> continually<00:02:17.020> faces

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
I don't know why it continually faces

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.760 
I don't know why it continually faces
West<00:02:17.740> like<00:02:18.070> this<00:02:18.310> under<00:02:18.790> this<00:02:18.940> setting<00:02:19.770> let's

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
West like this under this setting let's

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.230 
West like this under this setting let's
go<00:02:20.950> again<00:02:21.580> rotate<00:02:23.640> again<00:02:24.640> the<00:02:24.730> gyros<00:02:25.090> are

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 
go again rotate again the gyros are

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.680 
go again rotate again the gyros are
working<00:02:25.540> in<00:02:25.660> the<00:02:25.750> APM<00:02:26.290> but<00:02:26.680> the<00:02:27.690> magnetometer

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
working in the APM but the magnetometer

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:37.030 
working in the APM but the magnetometer
is<00:02:28.720> telling<00:02:29.140> it<00:02:29.230> to<00:02:29.260> go<00:02:30.210> west<00:02:32.370> west<00:02:33.370> northwest

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.740 

so<00:02:37.640> I<00:02:37.670> really<00:02:38.030> don't<00:02:38.150> know<00:02:38.299> what's<00:02:38.450> going<00:02:38.659> on

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
so I really don't know what's going on

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.199 
so I really don't know what's going on
here<00:02:38.959> just<00:02:39.200> for<00:02:39.760> demonstration<00:02:40.760> I'll<00:02:40.939> flip

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
here just for demonstration I'll flip

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:48.550 
here just for demonstration I'll flip
this<00:02:41.390> over<00:02:42.189> under<00:02:43.189> this<00:02:43.370> setting<00:02:47.379> give<00:02:48.379> it<00:02:48.470> a

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
this over under this setting give it a

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.809 
this over under this setting give it a
second<00:02:49.959> oddly<00:02:50.959> enough<00:02:51.110> whenever<00:02:51.590> I<00:02:51.680> flip<00:02:52.610> over

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 
second oddly enough whenever I flip over

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:57.190 
second oddly enough whenever I flip over
the<00:02:53.650> GPS<00:02:54.650> unit<00:02:55.010> I<00:02:55.190> can<00:02:55.940> still<00:02:56.299> get<00:02:56.480> eight

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
the GPS unit I can still get eight

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.050 
the GPS unit I can still get eight
satellites<00:02:57.590> inside<00:02:58.220> my<00:02:58.430> house<00:02:58.640> here<00:02:58.879> and<00:02:59.000> I

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
satellites inside my house here and I

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.970 
satellites inside my house here and I
have<00:02:59.150> a<00:02:59.209> tin<00:02:59.480> roof<00:02:59.690> which<00:03:00.620> is<00:03:00.769> pretty

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
have a tin roof which is pretty

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.920 
have a tin roof which is pretty
impressive<00:03:01.370> to<00:03:01.790> get<00:03:01.970> eight<00:03:02.150> satellites<00:03:02.390> and

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
impressive to get eight satellites and

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.559 
impressive to get eight satellites and
when<00:03:03.920> it's<00:03:04.040> in<00:03:04.370> normal<00:03:04.760> orientation<00:03:05.420> it's

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569 
when it's in normal orientation it's

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:08.080 
when it's in normal orientation it's
still<00:03:05.870> eight<00:03:06.079> satellites<00:03:06.349> so<00:03:06.980> I<00:03:07.220> mean<00:03:07.970> I'm

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
still eight satellites so I mean I'm

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:09.970 
still eight satellites so I mean I'm
even<00:03:08.239> wondering<00:03:08.629> if<00:03:08.810> I<00:03:08.930> can<00:03:08.989> just<00:03:09.319> mount<00:03:09.829> this

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
even wondering if I can just mount this

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.670 
even wondering if I can just mount this
in<00:03:10.190> my<00:03:10.510> mini<00:03:11.510> Talon

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
in my mini Talon

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.059 
in my mini Talon
airplane<00:03:13.280> upside<00:03:13.849> down<00:03:14.500> but<00:03:15.500> I'd<00:03:15.590> really<00:03:15.829> like

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:16.069 
airplane upside down but I'd really like

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:17.710 
airplane upside down but I'd really like
to<00:03:16.220> get<00:03:16.340> it<00:03:16.489> right<00:03:16.609> side<00:03:16.879> up<00:03:17.060> so<00:03:17.090> that<00:03:17.420> I<00:03:17.450> have

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
to get it right side up so that I have

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.860 
to get it right side up so that I have
you<00:03:18.170> know<00:03:18.230> better<00:03:18.980> reception<00:03:19.629> so<00:03:20.629> anyway

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
you know better reception so anyway

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.410 
you know better reception so anyway
let's<00:03:21.260> try<00:03:21.409> it<00:03:21.560> like<00:03:21.680> this<00:03:21.739> this<00:03:22.730> is<00:03:22.790> roll<00:03:23.150> at

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
let's try it like this this is roll at

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.080 
let's try it like this this is roll at
zero<00:03:23.870> there's<00:03:24.500> no<00:03:24.680> there's<00:03:25.430> no<00:03:25.489> correction

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
zero there's no there's no correction

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:32.170 
zero there's no there's no correction
under<00:03:26.810> the<00:03:26.900> initial<00:03:27.200> setup<00:03:28.120> so<00:03:30.040> let's<00:03:31.040> go<00:03:31.250> from

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
under the initial setup so let's go from

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:40.420 
under the initial setup so let's go from
south<00:03:32.450> to<00:03:32.480> west

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.670 

and<00:03:40.970> look<00:03:41.360> it's<00:03:41.629> going<00:03:41.840> right<00:03:42.019> back<00:03:42.230> to<00:03:42.470> the

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
and look it's going right back to the

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.440 
and look it's going right back to the
spot<00:03:43.549> that<00:03:43.579> it<00:03:43.790> likes<00:03:44.120> to<00:03:44.360> go<00:03:44.510> to<00:03:45.879> under<00:03:46.879> none<00:03:47.120> I

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
spot that it likes to go to under none I

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.979 
spot that it likes to go to under none I
really<00:03:48.230> don't<00:03:48.439> know<00:03:48.560> why<00:03:48.709> it's<00:03:48.890> doing<00:03:49.310> this

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
really don't know why it's doing this

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:53.410 
really don't know why it's doing this
well<00:03:50.989> let's<00:03:51.200> put<00:03:51.349> it<00:03:51.379> back<00:03:51.560> to<00:03:51.849> 180<00:03:52.849> one<00:03:53.239> more

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
well let's put it back to 180 one more

00:03:53.420 --> 00:04:02.080 
well let's put it back to 180 one more
time<00:03:55.269> give<00:03:56.269> it<00:03:56.299> a<00:03:56.420> moment<00:04:00.430> it's<00:04:01.430> rotating

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
time give it a moment it's rotating

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.520 
time give it a moment it's rotating
north<00:04:03.129> and<00:04:04.129> now<00:04:05.120> it's<00:04:05.299> working<00:04:06.260> like<00:04:06.409> it

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
north and now it's working like it

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.220 
north and now it's working like it
should<00:04:06.879> again<00:04:07.879> the<00:04:08.030> GPS<00:04:08.450> is<00:04:08.950> upside<00:04:09.950> down

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
should again the GPS is upside down

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:16.120 
should again the GPS is upside down
let's<00:04:12.230> go<00:04:12.440> south

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.449 

I've<00:04:16.760> tried<00:04:17.030> this<00:04:17.680> using<00:04:18.680> mission<00:04:18.920> planner<00:04:19.190> on

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
I've tried this using mission planner on

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.820 
I've tried this using mission planner on
a<00:04:19.700> Windows<00:04:20.000> computer<00:04:20.410> just<00:04:21.410> because<00:04:21.650> I<00:04:21.770> know

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:21.830 
a Windows computer just because I know

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:28.440 
a Windows computer just because I know
this<00:04:22.070> is<00:04:22.220> kind<00:04:22.490> of<00:04:22.580> new<00:04:23.080> a<00:04:24.080> PM<00:04:25.040> planner<00:04:25.310> is<00:04:26.120> new

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.860 

but<00:04:29.450> yes<00:04:29.690> it's<00:04:30.080> acting<00:04:30.440> quite<00:04:30.890> strange

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
but yes it's acting quite strange

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:38.260 
but yes it's acting quite strange
also<00:04:34.510> after<00:04:35.590> yeah<00:04:36.590> I'm<00:04:37.520> doing<00:04:37.790> this<00:04:37.850> video<00:04:38.000> now

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
also after yeah I'm doing this video now

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:39.960 
also after yeah I'm doing this video now
for<00:04:38.450> a<00:04:38.510> quick<00:04:38.660> demonstration<00:04:38.870> purpose<00:04:39.650> but

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970 
for a quick demonstration purpose but

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.150 
for a quick demonstration purpose but
after<00:04:40.970> everything<00:04:41.270> not<00:04:41.420> that<00:04:41.600> I've<00:04:41.720> done<00:04:42.500> here

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
after everything not that I've done here

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.170 
after everything not that I've done here
I<00:04:43.370> have<00:04:43.910> done<00:04:44.150> a<00:04:44.180> live<00:04:44.390> calibration
