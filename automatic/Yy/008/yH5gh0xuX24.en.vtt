00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 the people of youtube today we are going to do 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:08.189
 a paper heart in this case with 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:11.370
 cardboard is made in 23 minutes not 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.410
 it takes nothing and it's super original and then 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.920
 At the end we will put a little note here 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.740
 eva rubber is super easy super 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.650
 simple and super cute is what 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.430
 let's do is double this by the 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.680
 half 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.680
 so we apply well 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.250
 and now what we 're going to do is fold it 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.890
 again for the other half for another 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.850
 side do not have folded what we're going to 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.850
 to do is to open it 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:45.360
 and now we are going to take it this way for here 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.360
 up and the same with the other side 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:57.490
 to do is turn it around 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:00.010
 and we are going to double this from here 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:03.310
 up here below what we are going to 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:06.440
 to do is to fold them towards there of the two 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:09.170
 what we are going to do is turn it around 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.560
 and we are going to bend electric from here 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.560
 above 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.850
 I remove it so it does not look 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.009
 blas and the tip for inside 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.450
 and now we're going to do the same with the 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:27.369
 side 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.110
 and this is how we have stayed in our hearts 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:31.390
 finished and now what are we going to do 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.950
 with a piece of eva rubber I'm going to 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.719
 cut and we're going to make a little bow and what 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.080
 we put on one side so that it stays more 

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:38.960
 flirtatious 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.570
 a rectangular piece of rubber eva and a 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.660
 bit to put it in the middle 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:47.820
 of doing what we have done well 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:51.600
 done is to fold it on top of the other 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:54.180
 let's go and look like that and that's for the 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.370
 center if our heart has remained 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.830
 finished I hope you liked it 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:00.890

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.840
