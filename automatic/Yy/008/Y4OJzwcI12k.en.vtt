00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.139
 we begin to begin to remove the head gas-53 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:18.420
 in 1 head was shot 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:19.970
 very hard to rust on 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:25.519
 stiletto heels 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:29.210
 which did not allow to remove the head 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:37.170
 remove the second head where the problem 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:39.739
 the same is only very difficult and rusted 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.739
 of all 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:58.230
 so here it all looked was 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:01:05.040
 a drill tube is applied here 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:47.130
 sized grell it all drilled 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:50.180
 Now we will show how this water is for 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.180
 cooling bureau 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.660
 little by little 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:48.099
 little by little there are wells going 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:52.920
 studs one by one head starts 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:59.019
 move coming up from the board than 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:03:04.480
 we correct by the way the drill is applied from say 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:08.349
 so improvised auger taken prices 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:11.109
 It turns out 2 kilo watt so-called. aerial 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:15.280
 until they get given water there 2 kilos 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:19.109
 watt about suitable for these cases and 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:21.670
 Stan poured sand by you to us 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:25.109
 outer shell goes like a beetroot 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:29.260
 done like this 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:31.709
 who will be interested in that is how 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:35.220
 way with him though the head itself 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:39.400
 the problem is not only gas 53 different for you 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:43.470
 Volga where especially you work 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.470
