it<00:05:09.789> effectively<00:05:10.270> we'll<00:05:10.539> see<00:05:10.830> it<00:05:11.830> looks<00:05:12.010> like

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:12.070 
it effectively we'll see it looks like

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:13.320 
it effectively we'll see it looks like
the<00:05:12.310> whole<00:05:12.430> of<00:05:12.460> their<00:05:12.669> team<00:05:12.849> is<00:05:13.060> sort<00:05:13.270> of

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 
the whole of their team is sort of

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.000 
the whole of their team is sort of
focused<00:05:13.720> on<00:05:13.900> the<00:05:14.229> hill<00:05:14.380> that<00:05:14.560> we<00:05:14.680> were<00:05:14.800> just
