00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.850
 the truth 9360 that has arrived because no 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:13.630
 light on the display 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:17.800
 she understands she gets to see sometimes 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:21.040
 in the background the image without light and we are going to 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:23.520
 see what this can cause this 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.520
 problem 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.609
 there, the image will be reached 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.019
 against the light and start charging the 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.699
 software bar there we see the 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.640
 light bulbs the keyboard leds 

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:38.070
 illuminating and we see the led also of the 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.210
 illuminated transpac meaning that 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.670
 the phone is working 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.530
 correctly but it is not giving birth to 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.059
 display let's see then what we 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.059
 let's find in this case 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:52.970
 we see then there are two faults one that 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.120
 have 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.770
 to the light track of the display and this 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.480
 we can also save it, let's do 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.830
 a treatment here we're going to scrape that 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.440
 mysticism 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:07.130
 let's apply liquid cleaner 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:09.350
 they say to remove all that sulfate and 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.440
 everything that is damaged there and leaves us 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.540
 the track ready to make this vintage and 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.590
 we also see that there is a problem here in 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.229
 the connector 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.329
 in the connector of the display this track 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.390
 here to the third the one that has to do 

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:27.899
 with the voltage that activates the light of the 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:32.069
 display is sulphated and is not 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:34.020
 making contact in the humidity and the 

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:36.929
 volts that there is the voltage that arrives 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:40.799
 that line makes tin damage 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:42.299
 a fault and that totally welded what 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.119
 let's do is a treatment for 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:48.240
 can repair what all these 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.959
 questions of methods and procedures 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.369
 we will be seeing them in the course 

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:56.479
 specialized full for blackberry 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.479
 93 60 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:05.080
 then we are going to apply liquid 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.880
 cleaning service on that envelope s 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.510
 contact let's wait about five 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:13.930
 minutes for him to do the procedure 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:15.580
 of sulfatar that pizza then with a 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.610
 droplet let's remove what there is 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:21.160
 remained and then the residue of the liquid 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.590
 we are going to withdraw it with the other one with the 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.970
 demineralized water and we will also 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.520
 do the same procedure 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.290
 display connector here amateur going 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.780
 we're just going to take a little 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.310
 connector so that it is not going to go that 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.680
 humidity below the display or there is 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.360
 spotted after inhabitants we are going to 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.890
 wait and let's do the procedure 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.890
 and we are going to repair those pizzas 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:48.790
 and singing now we see that we already have the 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:50.890
 track after having applied 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.200
 the helpful cleaner site we see that 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.689
 track 3 already looks bright I do not know about 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.239
 neira like now and you're ready to 

00:02:55.689 --> 00:03:00.159
 receive the txamÃ³n plus after this 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:03.370
 year and already would solve the problem 

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:06.310
 work that by that contact 3 and already the 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:09.540
 display we have also enlisted it already 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.540
 we see that there are no euros 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.320
 ah 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.320
 ah 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:31.710
 Y 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:37.770
 and 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:05.959
 l 

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:14.870
 yes 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:14.870
 and 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:40.650
 how is it now you are ready to 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.650
 receive flush and be missed too 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:49.400
 and now then let's try yes yes what 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:51.440
 we already had the solution we wanted 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.630
 this is when you have released the 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.990
 tracks so we need to recover more 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:55.990
 can 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:05.290
 and let's say I'm wrong 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:19.590
 Arauca service technical service 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.590
 professional mobile phone
