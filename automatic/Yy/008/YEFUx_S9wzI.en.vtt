00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.950 
and many of the previous note 5 users
actually<00:00:17.010> felt<00:00:17.430> a<00:00:17.670> little<00:00:18.029> bit<00:00:18.180> disappointed

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
actually felt a little bit disappointed

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.519 
actually felt a little bit disappointed
when<00:00:19.830> they<00:00:20.039> see<00:00:20.550> that<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:21.240> node<00:00:21.689> 5<00:00:21.900> battery<00:00:22.350> is

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
when they see that the node 5 battery is

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.070 
when they see that the node 5 battery is
not<00:00:22.740> removable<00:00:23.660> the

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
not removable the

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.950 
not removable the
battery<00:00:25.619> capacity<00:00:26.010> is<00:00:26.369> also<00:00:27.090> downgraded<00:00:27.720> from

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
battery capacity is also downgraded from

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.679 
battery capacity is also downgraded from
the<00:00:28.320> previous<00:00:28.710> note<00:00:28.859> versions<00:00:29.369> it<00:00:29.880> is<00:00:30.179> only

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
the previous note versions it is only

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.250 
the previous note versions it is only
3000<00:00:31.560> milliamp<00:00:31.830> per<00:00:32.070> hour<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:32.870> just<00:00:33.870> like<00:00:34.050> the

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
3000 milliamp per hour and just like the

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.500 
3000 milliamp per hour and just like the
previous<00:00:34.340> Samsung<00:00:35.340> devices<00:00:35.640> it<00:00:36.000> has<00:00:36.210> the

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.319 
mode and also it can show you the detail
if<00:00:41.969> any<00:00:42.809> app<00:00:43.079> is<00:00:43.469> using<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:45.059> battery

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
if any app is using the battery

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.779 
if any app is using the battery
abnormally<00:00:46.289> although<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.160> battery<00:00:47.579> is

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
abnormally although the battery is

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.439 
abnormally although the battery is
smaller<00:00:48.570> than<00:00:48.840> before<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.469> it<00:00:49.829> is<00:00:49.950> not

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:50.449 
smaller than before and it is not

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:53.090 
smaller than before and it is not
removable<00:00:51.449> but<00:00:52.140> actually<00:00:52.530> I<00:00:52.559> am<00:00:52.770> pretty<00:00:52.829> happy

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
removable but actually I am pretty happy

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.510 
removable but actually I am pretty happy
with<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.699> battery<00:00:54.239> life<00:00:54.930> of<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.289> note<00:00:55.920> 5<00:00:56.160> I

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
with the battery life of the note 5 I

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.880 
with the battery life of the note 5 I
might<00:00:57.090> be<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.480> minority<00:00:57.719> of<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.140> node<00:00:58.440> users

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
might be the minority of the node users

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.400 
might be the minority of the node users
which<00:00:59.340> have<00:00:59.579> never<00:00:59.760> bought<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.390> spare<00:01:00.989> battery

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
which have never bought a spare battery

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.219 
which have never bought a spare battery
so<00:01:02.309> I<00:01:02.609> personally<00:01:03.149> don't<00:01:03.390> care<00:01:03.480> about<00:01:03.809> the

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
so I personally don't care about the

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.950 
so I personally don't care about the
removable<00:01:04.799> battery<00:01:05.129> as<00:01:05.519> much<00:01:05.820> as<00:01:06.030> some<00:01:06.780> other

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
removable battery as much as some other

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.179 
removable battery as much as some other
people<00:01:07.500> might<00:01:07.740> have

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
people might have

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.550 
people might have
having<00:01:08.729> said<00:01:08.939> that<00:01:08.970> I'm<00:01:09.420> getting<00:01:09.869> pretty<00:01:10.439> good

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
having said that I'm getting pretty good

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.399 
having said that I'm getting pretty good
battery<00:01:11.070> life<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.549> I'm<00:01:12.330> getting<00:01:12.689> from

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
battery life and I'm getting from

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.749 
battery life and I'm getting from
anywhere<00:01:14.689> 4<00:01:15.689> and<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:15.930> half<00:01:16.170> hour<00:01:16.409> of<00:01:16.770> screen<00:01:17.610> on

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
anywhere 4 and a half hour of screen on

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.109 
anywhere 4 and a half hour of screen on
time<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.299> more<00:01:19.170> than<00:01:19.350> five<00:01:19.560> hours<00:01:19.799> and<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.970> me

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
time to more than five hours and to me

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.320 
time to more than five hours and to me
this<00:01:21.659> is<00:01:21.720> nothing<00:01:22.009> groundbreaking<00:01:23.009> but<00:01:23.970> it's

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
this is nothing groundbreaking but it's

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.740 
this is nothing groundbreaking but it's
still<00:01:24.630> pretty<00:01:25.200> good<00:01:25.500> considering<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.750> device

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
still pretty good considering the device

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.920 
still pretty good considering the device
has<00:01:28.049> a<00:01:28.080> very<00:01:28.740> bright<00:01:29.100> screen<00:01:29.579> and<00:01:29.939> it<00:01:30.180> has<00:01:30.210> 4k

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
has a very bright screen and it has 4k

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.789 
has a very bright screen and it has 4k
screen<00:01:31.290> and<00:01:32.479> still<00:01:33.479> I<00:01:33.509> feel<00:01:33.960> it<00:01:34.200> is<00:01:34.350> a<00:01:34.380> very

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
screen and still I feel it is a very

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.670 
screen and still I feel it is a very
good<00:01:35.070> performance<00:01:35.460> although<00:01:36.090> we<00:01:37.049> have<00:01:37.290> now

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
good performance although we have now

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.280 
good performance although we have now
the<00:01:37.740> devices<00:01:38.430> with<00:01:38.610> very<00:01:38.939> big<00:01:39.329> batteries<00:01:39.930> and

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
the devices with very big batteries and

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.399 
the devices with very big batteries and
they<00:01:40.560> can<00:01:40.799> last<00:01:41.189> much<00:01:41.790> longer<00:01:41.899> than<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.200> note

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
they can last much longer than the note

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.389 
they can last much longer than the note
5<00:01:43.649> but<00:01:44.009> to<00:01:44.189> me<00:01:44.369> on<00:01:45.439> this<00:01:46.439> day<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.829> age<00:01:46.979> with<00:01:47.340> the

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
5 but to me on this day and age with the

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.020 
5 but to me on this day and age with the
quad<00:01:47.880> HD<00:01:48.060> screens<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:49.100> fast<00:01:50.100> processors<00:01:50.790> and

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
quad HD screens and fast processors and

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.590 
quad HD screens and fast processors and
also<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.560> Android<00:01:53.030> alda<00:01:54.060> Android<00:01:54.450> lollipop

also the Android alda Android lollipop

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.880 
also the Android alda Android lollipop
which<00:01:55.229> is<00:01:55.409> very<00:01:55.979> battery<00:01:56.430> hungry<00:01:56.850> OS<00:01:57.719> still<00:01:58.560> I

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
which is very battery hungry OS still I

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.889 
which is very battery hungry OS still I
think<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.340> four<00:01:59.759> and<00:01:59.909> a<00:01:59.939> half<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:00.420> five<00:02:00.600> hours

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
think the four and a half and five hours

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.319 
think the four and a half and five hours
is<00:02:01.229> pretty<00:02:01.619> decent<00:02:02.130> excludes<00:02:02.880> more<00:02:03.119> than

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
is pretty decent excludes more than

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.330 
is pretty decent excludes more than
decent<00:02:03.509> and<00:02:03.930> I'm<00:02:04.140> pretty<00:02:04.380> happy<00:02:05.009> with<00:02:05.189> the

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
decent and I'm pretty happy with the

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.290 
decent and I'm pretty happy with the
performance<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:06.170> your<00:02:07.170> mileage<00:02:07.560> might<00:02:08.250> vary

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
performance and your mileage might vary

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.999 
performance and your mileage might vary
because<00:02:09.300> your<00:02:09.989> usage<00:02:10.440> you<00:02:10.649> might<00:02:10.830> be

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
because your usage you might be

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.610 
because your usage you might be
different<00:02:11.459> from<00:02:11.610> mine<00:02:12.000> but

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
different from mine but

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.309 
different from mine but
usually<00:02:14.040> a<00:02:14.220> couple<00:02:14.370> of<00:02:14.549> email<00:02:15.299> accounts<00:02:15.420> that

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
usually a couple of email accounts that

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.119 
usually a couple of email accounts that
are<00:02:16.590> on<00:02:16.799> the<00:02:16.950> sink<00:02:17.280> and<00:02:17.750> also<00:02:18.750> I<00:02:19.019> use<00:02:19.860> Facebook
