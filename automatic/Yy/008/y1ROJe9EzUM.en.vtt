 the drink of the Latin American market 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:25.020
 born in Peru in 1988 in the middle of a 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:28.199
 great economic chaos and in times of a 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:30.810
 widespread violence the company has 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:34.879
 grown and has expanded not only in 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:39.270

 Dominican history 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.420
 real tail is constituted by the 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.540
 family years being these six 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.840
 brothers who with their parents founded 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:58.080
 the company in the yard of your house as 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.720
 they usually say in order to have another 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:03.150
 type of income because the 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:06.240
 terrorism that was ravaging the country in those 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:10.080
 times did not allow them to live on their 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.780
 normal source that was agriculture the 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.869
 first soft drinks were marketed 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:19.550
 in beer bottles because the 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:22.350
 brother of the yearlings jorge aÃ±aÃ±os 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:26.090
 I had experience in the distribution 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:28.740
 brewery started in this way 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:32.820
 getting a rudimentary machine 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.800
 to make soda called atahualpa the 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.410
 which is still in one of the 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.619
 numerous plants that real queue has in 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:43.610
 Peru's success is due to much 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:46.920
 to the technical training of the brothers 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:49.200
 mostly engineers achieved a 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.619
 nice drink to the 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.110
 palate of the population trying on what 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.939
 possible to use the least chemicals in 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.729
 its manufacture 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:02.820
 the distribution started between the neighbors 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:05.369
 then in the town where they resided and 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.710
 and it spread gradually his 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.860
 fame and the preference of the people for 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.989
 this drink helped a lot that flagellum 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.840
 of terrorism did not let enter 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:18.420
 trucks with products towards ayacucho if 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.849
 they did not pay a quota so the 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:24.330
 competition from other drinks was very 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:26.760
 little consolidating its brand it 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.790
 moved little by little to other areas 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.250
 close to ayacucho always with the 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.260
 vision of giving a soda at a price at 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.620
 reach of the vast majority of the 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:40.799
 population for those who drink a soft drink 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:43.769
 it was a luxury real tail change that giving 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:46.709
 better price and more quantity together with 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:49.990
 a nice flavor which has always 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:52.720
 characterized its products 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:55.210
 and his great acceptance made the family 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:58.540
 go consolidating far and wide 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:00.910
 of the Peruvian territory its success is based 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:04.090
 not in taking market from others 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:06.850
 refreshments but in expanding the market for 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:09.280
 consumers in Peru and its policy of 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:14.860
 no agreement for the price of 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:17.140
 real cola growth refreshments has 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.890
 now presence in many countries of 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:25.090
 america expanding to ecuador 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:29.980
 venezuela mexico chile costa rica 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:32.140
 Guatemalan Dominican Republic and always 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:35.410
 keeping its same golden rule 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:38.200
 quality at the right price because of its 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.480
 low cost is partly due to the fact that 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.540
 they work with the normal system of 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.610
 franchises but they are brothers 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.700
 those who together make the 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:51.160
 facilities opening projects 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:54.910
 own cutting out many expenses 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:56.990
 generated by a tertiarization of the 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.890
 product 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:01.380
 work 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:03.600
 real tail internally has always 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:06.200
 tried to work as an entity 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:09.290
 organized and highly functional 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:12.450
 having only what is indispensable for his 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:15.660
 running the luxuries are things that 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.519
 They do not look people in their offices 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.769
 that they elaborate in each of their 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:23.700
 facilities have as their goal the 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:26.090
 company growth mostly the 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:28.290
 actual tail staff is highly 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.600
 identified with the brand because it 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:33.180
 they feel proud to be the david that 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:36.230
 fight against a goliat formed by the 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:39.270
 large soft drinks like coke or pepsi 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:41.820
 each distribution center that ccoo the 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:44.280
 real opening is an autonomous entity 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:47.280
 who sees its growth and strength 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:50.520
 within the market that competes with the 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:52.710
 other distribution centers for being the 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.740
 which sells more or that more attention to 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:58.390
 client has real queue gives work 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:01.140
 direct to many people not 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:03.940
 just for the process of their refreshments 

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:07.090
 but also for the processes of 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:09.700
 distribution since one of your points 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:12.700
 strong is that it does not have large fleets 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:15.330
 of distribution units but that 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:18.220
 subcontracts these services to third parties 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:21.100
 always giving preference to the most 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:25.180
 small one of your rules is a 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:27.940
 dealer a unit to give work 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:31.270
 to as many people as possible 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:34.300
 because not only fair price and quality 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:37.510
 you can win a market but the 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:40.180
 job creation job 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:43.030
 that the company keeps 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:45.600
 and the real tail mystic is to concentrate 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:48.820
 his advertising work in the mouth 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:51.970
 more than in commercial saturation by 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:54.490
 the audiovisual media and is that this 

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:56.979
 Soda is taking a market that does not 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:59.500
 was attended to or was poorly attended to 

00:05:56.979 --> 00:06:02.710
 for the big soft drinks as for the 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:05.440
 local refreshments this work is largely 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:09.340
 measure made by their own workers 

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:11.830
 by the distributors people who 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:13.660
 they feel part of a large company that 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:17.500
 think about growing and that 

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:21.280
 growth comes from those in whom 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:24.430
 the family is therefore supported 

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:27.430
 forget how they started with a machine 

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:30.340
 rustic as a small business 

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:33.840
 familiar, if something is left over, it 's the 

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:33.840
 simplicity and humility
