00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.520 
pretty much to run straight toward me
start<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.270> break<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.689> outside<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.470> it

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
start to break to the outside and it

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.260 
start to break to the outside and it
just<00:01:31.740> barely<00:01:31.979> works<00:01:32.340> you<00:01:32.759> can<00:01:32.880> see<00:01:33.060> here<00:01:33.180> he

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
just barely works you can see here he

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.899 
just barely works you can see here he
grabs<00:01:33.509> smack<00:01:34.170> in<00:01:34.350> my<00:01:34.409> foot<00:01:34.710> kind<00:01:35.130> of<00:01:35.220> makes<00:01:35.820> me

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
grabs smack in my foot kind of makes me

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.520 
grabs smack in my foot kind of makes me
stumble<00:01:36.299> a<00:01:36.360> little<00:01:36.390> bit<00:01:36.689> but<00:01:37.170> then<00:01:37.290> I've<00:01:37.380> got

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
stumble a little bit but then I've got

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.069 
stumble a little bit but then I've got
enough<00:01:37.710> acceleration<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:39.509> run<00:01:39.720> out<00:01:39.869> of<00:01:39.900> that

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
enough acceleration to run out of that

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.690 
enough acceleration to run out of that
now<00:01:40.500> this<00:01:40.650> is<00:01:40.710> where<00:01:40.860> we<00:01:40.950> talk<00:01:41.100> about<00:01:41.159> pursuit

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
angles I want to go back here and just

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.109 
angles I want to go back here and just
take<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.259> look<00:01:43.500> at<00:01:43.649> what<00:01:44.159> Beeston<00:01:44.549> does<00:01:44.729> here<00:01:45.000> I

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
take a look at what Beeston does here I

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.240 
take a look at what Beeston does here I
want<00:01:45.329> you<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.450> notice<00:01:45.750> first<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.290> foremost<00:01:46.680> he

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
want you to notice first and foremost he

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.760 
want you to notice first and foremost he
really<00:01:47.700> doesn't<00:01:48.000> waver<00:01:48.540> in<00:01:48.869> his<00:01:49.320> pursuit<00:01:49.680> of

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
really doesn't waver in his pursuit of

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.050

where<00:01:51.180> we<00:01:51.270> see<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:51.479> lot<00:01:51.659> of<00:01:51.689> times<00:01:51.930> you<00:01:52.470> know

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560

this<00:01:52.770> is<00:01:52.829> exactly<00:01:53.310> I<00:01:53.340> mean<00:01:53.460> there<00:01:53.729> is<00:01:53.759> a<00:01:53.909> little

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
this is exactly I mean there is a little

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.120 
this is exactly I mean there is a little
bit<00:01:54.360> here<00:01:54.600> he<00:01:54.990> commits<00:01:55.350> down<00:01:55.560> a<00:01:55.590> little<00:01:55.920> bit

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
bit here he commits down a little bit

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.859 
bit here he commits down a little bit
then<00:01:56.640> he<00:01:56.729> breaks<00:01:56.969> back<00:01:57.299> out<00:01:57.479> but<00:01:57.630> nothing

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
then he breaks back out but nothing

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.580 
then he breaks back out but nothing
nearly<00:01:58.409> as<00:01:59.390> strong<00:02:00.390> of<00:02:00.420> an<00:02:00.869> angle<00:02:01.200> of<00:02:01.350> attack

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
nearly as strong of an angle of attack

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.709 
nearly as strong of an angle of attack
as<00:02:01.950> we<00:02:02.070> see<00:02:02.219> with<00:02:02.340> Madden<00:02:02.700> in<00:02:02.790> terms<00:02:03.420> of<00:02:03.570> watch

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719

and<00:02:59.319> distance<00:03:00.069> not<00:03:00.670> just<00:03:01.060> running<00:03:01.420> behind<00:03:01.510> the

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
and distance not just running behind the

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.750 
and distance not just running behind the
ball<00:03:01.959> carrier<00:03:02.319> hopes<00:03:02.620> to<00:03:02.830> to<00:03:03.250> catch<00:03:03.430> it<00:03:03.610> and<00:03:03.700> I

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
ball carrier hopes to to catch it and I

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.580 
ball carrier hopes to to catch it and I
also<00:03:03.910> kind<00:03:04.180> of<00:03:04.209> like<00:03:04.330> the<00:03:04.510> fact<00:03:04.720> you<00:03:04.870> see<00:03:05.110> you

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
here and we'll see beats and do the same

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.430 
here and we'll see beats and do the same
thing<00:03:12.760> Anderson<00:03:13.540> runs<00:03:13.720> the<00:03:13.840> whole<00:03:14.019> play<00:03:14.260> out

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
example of pursuit angles in this game

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:20.580 
example of pursuit angles in this game
show<00:03:19.180> you<00:03:19.239> that<00:03:19.510> it's<00:03:19.630> not<00:03:19.780> all<00:03:19.989> static<00:03:20.440> it's

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
show you that it's not all static it's

are they able to replicate pursuit

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.090 
are they able to replicate pursuit
angles<00:03:28.420> varying<00:03:29.109> down<00:03:29.560> the<00:03:29.709> field<00:03:29.920> from

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
angles varying down the field from

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
are we gonna continue to see the static

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.069 
are we gonna continue to see the static
straight-line<00:03:34.150> pursuit<00:03:34.569> that's<00:03:34.780> hampered
