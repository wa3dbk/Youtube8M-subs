00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:07.500
 Hello, how about you, good afternoon, my name? 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:11.070
 Omar Garcia is the system how I can 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.800
 lose weight dotcom and well then this 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:17.580
 I'm working out that this short video already 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:20.130
 that this is the second day if of this 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.039
 system that was testing the factor 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.740
 burns fat and well well not really 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:29.000
 there are big changes for this second 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:32.460
 day since you can you know it's not even 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.289
 a program a wonderful system in the 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.249
 which you can tell the difference in 

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:42.060
 the first days so well really 

00:00:38.249 --> 00:00:44.100
 in that sense to obviously change 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.630
 if what type what I can tell you is 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.070
 that if it has been hard for me to work 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:51.330
 chew slower and above all it 's to the 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.730
 time to go to the bathroom because if 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:56.250
 it is definitely more often not this 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.260
 I imagine that food everything 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.080
 is being implemented because I was 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.610
 beginning to be effect not so I think 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.160
 that right now what this is doing 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:08.100
 program is cleaning everything that is my 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:10.980
 system now something that happened to me but 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.890
 it happened to me it was 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:15.930
 in regret less here right now I have this 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.810
 scale in which then I 'm not going to 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.690
 weigh so you can see what the weight is 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.510
 that I have current and therefore we can 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:27.180
 determine if this factor system 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:29.190
 burning fat works or not that then 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.710
 It's what I'll do at this point I 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:35.070
 I will weigh and you will see with your 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.050
 own eyes in real time what is the 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.960
 current weight good indeed I did it 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:43.080
 and the truth is that I was shocked when 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.090
 I said wow how much it weighs but you're going to 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.830
 see you have at this moment what I'm going to 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.550
 do or yes I'm going to put the scale 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:52.159
 on the floor and let me go I'm sorry it's 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:56.090
 that this one 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:58.280
 my camera rafita but good that is the 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.939
 scale ok I do not know what I'm going to do to 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:04.840
 then it is to raise my feet and we are going to 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:04.840
 see how much weight 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:14.700
 wow if what you know are 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.700
 200 pounds 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.000
 but how strange 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:25.159
 good and I say that clear because yesterday 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:29.299
 exactly they were 200 pounds I do not know if 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:32.290
 one day but he scored less than 200 pounds a 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:32.290
 what are we going to see again 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:42.580
 as a brand like 190 pounds true and that 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:46.300
 that I have shoes in the pants 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:49.690
 denim and hat I do not know if already by the 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:52.030
 first day have dropped a few 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.810
 pounds I'm not sure but it makes me 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.810
 rare example 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.550
 well let's leave it more or less like this 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.760
 but let's say I want to say that I 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:08.040
 I started to have a sheet change which is 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:12.120
 great but I do not think so as I say just 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:14.849
 this yesterday I was thinking 200 even 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.910
 was a little bit past is a little bit 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:20.489
 last of the two hundred pounds that is 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:23.900
 205 210 approximately and right now 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:26.910
 I think from a day today to a day pajÃ­n 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:29.519
 53 I do not know how many you want but good 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.840
 let's say there are two hundred 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:33.840
 live the 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.760
 my current weight therefore therefore if 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.239
 I'm overweight anyway 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:41.040
 I have to go down at least until a no 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:43.799
 I know a seat about 20 pounds I have to 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:47.489
 lend approximately now 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:50.370
 then they are 200 pounds 170 that go down 20 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:52.200
 pounds then that's the goal so 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.900
 well now study you know what is my 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:57.150
 weight and you saw my photographs in the 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.819
 first videos how I looked 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.769
 belly and all that to all the fat that 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:03.989
 had accumulated in the chest or everything is 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:06.060
 so what we are going to work on 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:07.540
 quite pretty strong with this 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.390
 Program 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.549
 but if this program works if the 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.769
 scale does not lie to me because I'm super 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:17.910
 happy because then in just the 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:20.320
 first day well, but good as I say 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:22.780
 I did not want you to see it in time 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.160
 Real this we leave it at 200 pounds like this 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.570
 I do not think there's a big 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.360
 distraction one day for another but if it is 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:31.509
 that's good, well, this has been 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:34.419
 I hope we had all 

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:36.850
 enjoyed this video since for me it is 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:39.940
 motivate motivating and stimulating to know 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:43.000
 that day after day you're going to start going down 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:45.039
 gradually that all this is thanks to 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.570
 all the programs they offer in 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:48.550
 internet but obviously always and 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.110
 when to be very much very careful 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.849
 with each of them because not all 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.889
 they're good, that's why I 

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:55.479
 elaborated that investigation and I 'm 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:57.099
 presenting the best 

00:04:55.479 --> 00:05:00.729
 well that's been all my name is omar 

00:04:57.099 --> 00:05:03.070
 How can I get off the system? 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:04.960
