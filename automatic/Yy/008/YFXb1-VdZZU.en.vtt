that's<00:00:52.920> how<00:00:53.070> it<00:00:53.160> creates<00:00:53.399> its<00:00:53.550> own<00:00:53.640> compost<00:00:54.180> so

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
that's how it creates its own compost so

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.709 
that's how it creates its own compost so
it's<00:00:54.750> not<00:00:54.870> really<00:00:55.710> that<00:00:55.739> complicated<00:00:56.390> so<00:00:57.390> when

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
it's not really that complicated so when

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.330 
it's not really that complicated so when
you're<00:00:57.840> deciding<00:00:58.079> on<00:00:58.320> your<00:00:58.350> soil<00:00:58.800> I<00:00:59.010> just<00:00:59.190> get

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
you're deciding on your soil I just get

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.520 
you're deciding on your soil I just get
a<00:00:59.370> good<00:00:59.489> compost<00:00:59.879> mix<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:01.020> mix<00:01:01.320> that<00:01:01.500> I

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
a good compost mix and the mix that I

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.619 
a good compost mix and the mix that I
use<00:01:01.800> is<00:01:01.949> called<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.190> four-way<00:01:02.579> mix<00:01:02.879> it's<00:01:03.210> Irish

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
it so that together seems to work out

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.300 
it so that together seems to work out
really<00:01:16.170> well<00:01:16.380> for<00:01:16.590> me<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:16.799> I<00:01:17.009> don't<00:01:17.070> use

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310

anything else I'm deciding to use how

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.850 
anything else I'm deciding to use how
much<00:01:20.070> soil<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.700> use<00:01:20.939> so<00:01:21.630> when<00:01:22.200> picking<00:01:22.590> out<00:01:22.680> my

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
much soil to use so when picking out my

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.640 
much soil to use so when picking out my
soil<00:01:23.189> too<00:01:23.520> I<00:01:23.549> want<00:01:23.909> it<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.180> be<00:01:24.330> loose<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:25.080> moist

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
soil too I want it to be loose and moist

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.770 
soil too I want it to be loose and moist
and<00:01:26.100> fresh<00:01:26.520> but<00:01:27.330> not<00:01:27.950> still<00:01:28.950> steaming<00:01:29.520> hot<00:01:29.880> so

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
and fresh but not still steaming hot so

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:31.940 
and fresh but not still steaming hot so
you<00:01:30.840> got<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.140> make<00:01:31.259> sure<00:01:31.439> when<00:01:31.619> you<00:01:31.710> do<00:01:31.829> get

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
you got to make sure when you do get

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.800 
you got to make sure when you do get
compost<00:01:32.430> sometimes<00:01:32.820> it's<00:01:33.000> really<00:01:33.210> hot<00:01:33.390> still

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
compost sometimes it's really hot still

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.780 
compost sometimes it's really hot still
or<00:01:34.259> if<00:01:34.409> you're<00:01:34.530> making<00:01:34.650> your<00:01:34.890> own<00:01:34.920> compost<00:01:35.460> and

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
or if you're making your own compost and

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.539 
or if you're making your own compost and
is<00:01:35.909> still<00:01:36.180> hot<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:36.570> steaming<00:01:36.869> then<00:01:37.740> wait<00:01:38.520> a

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
is still hot and steaming then wait a

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:39.800 
is still hot and steaming then wait a
while<00:01:38.759> and<00:01:39.000> wait<00:01:39.060> give<00:01:39.270> another<00:01:39.540> couple

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
while and wait give another couple

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:40.130 
while and wait give another couple
months

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
months

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.560 
months
so<00:01:40.619> whenever<00:01:40.950> compost<00:01:41.579> is<00:01:41.820> really<00:01:42.240> really

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
so whenever compost is really really

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.530 
so whenever compost is really really
cold<00:01:42.990> it's<00:01:43.770> ready<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.310> use<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:44.820> it<00:01:45.329> needs<00:01:45.479> to

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
cold it's ready to use and it needs to

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.999 
cold it's ready to use and it needs to
be<00:01:45.600> airy<00:01:45.930> a<00:01:46.229> lot<00:01:46.439> of<00:01:46.500> times<00:01:46.680> a<00:01:46.710> little<00:01:46.770> bit<00:01:46.950> of

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
be airy a lot of times a little bit of

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.130 
be airy a lot of times a little bit of
gravel<00:01:47.399> underneath<00:01:47.790> your<00:01:48.240> beds<00:01:48.450> helps<00:01:48.899> a<00:01:48.990> lot

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
gravel underneath your beds helps a lot

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.260 
gravel underneath your beds helps a lot
to<00:01:49.380> give<00:01:49.530> it<00:01:49.649> good<00:01:49.770> drainage<00:01:50.040> and<00:01:50.549> when<00:01:51.240> I
