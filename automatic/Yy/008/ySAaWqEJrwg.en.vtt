00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
cups and you're gonna write your math

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.380 
cups and you're gonna write your math
facts<00:00:51.140> or<00:00:51.469> sight<00:00:52.010> words<00:00:52.309> on<00:00:52.579> the<00:00:52.730> bottom<00:00:53.270> of

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.209 
facts or sight words on the bottom of
them<00:00:53.600> you're<00:00:54.050> gonna<00:00:54.170> create<00:00:54.410> a<00:00:54.530> game<00:00:54.829> called

00:00:55.209 --> 00:00:55.219 
them you're gonna create a game called

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:58.810 
them you're gonna create a game called
power<00:00:56.090> towers<00:00:56.719> okay<00:00:57.050> I<00:00:57.489> store<00:00:58.489> them<00:00:58.670> in

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
power tower game looking kind of raggedy

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:10.990 
power tower game looking kind of raggedy
actually<00:01:09.710> I<00:01:09.740> need<00:01:09.890> to<00:01:09.950> make<00:01:10.160> so<00:01:10.369> many<00:01:10.460> ones<00:01:10.700> but

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
actually I need to make so many ones but

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.700 
actually I need to make so many ones but
they've<00:01:11.149> lasted<00:01:11.300> a<00:01:11.600> couple<00:01:11.720> years<00:01:12.170> okay<00:01:12.470> on

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
they've lasted a couple years okay on

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.649 
they've lasted a couple years okay on
the<00:01:13.250> bottoms<00:01:13.700> of<00:01:13.880> each<00:01:14.000> cup<00:01:14.299> you're<00:01:14.540> gonna

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
the bottoms of each cup you're gonna

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:17.590 
the bottoms of each cup you're gonna
write<00:01:14.990> basic<00:01:15.650> math<00:01:15.860> spec<00:01:16.189> math<00:01:16.580> effects<00:01:16.880> that

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
write basic math spec math effects that

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.990 
write basic math spec math effects that
one<00:01:17.840> shows<00:01:18.170> 1+1<00:01:19.040> here<00:01:19.909> we've<00:01:20.090> got<00:01:20.299> 6<00:01:21.020> plus<00:01:21.380> 0<00:01:22.000> 2

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
one shows 1+1 here we've got 6 plus 0 2

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.429 
one shows 1+1 here we've got 6 plus 0 2
plus<00:01:23.210> 1<00:01:23.860> okay<00:01:24.860> 5<00:01:25.579> plus<00:01:25.850> 1<00:01:25.970> and<00:01:26.390> the<00:01:26.750> basic<00:01:27.200> rules

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 
plus 1 okay 5 plus 1 and the basic rules

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:29.350 
plus 1 okay 5 plus 1 and the basic rules
of<00:01:27.590> the<00:01:27.680> game<00:01:27.920> is<00:01:28.220> before<00:01:28.700> you<00:01:28.820> can<00:01:29.000> stack<00:01:29.329> a

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
of the game is before you can stack a

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.810 
of the game is before you can stack a
cup<00:01:29.750> you<00:01:30.350> need<00:01:30.500> to<00:01:30.650> complete<00:01:31.070> that<00:01:31.250> math<00:01:31.520> back

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
cup you need to complete that math back

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.740 
cup you need to complete that math back
so<00:01:32.509> 5<00:01:32.869> plus<00:01:33.079> 1<00:01:33.320> the<00:01:33.650> kids<00:01:33.860> will<00:01:33.979> say<00:01:34.130> 5<00:01:34.369> 6<00:01:34.880> ok<00:01:35.540> and

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
so 5 plus 1 the kids will say 5 6 ok and

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.840 
so 5 plus 1 the kids will say 5 6 ok and
then<00:01:35.990> they<00:01:36.110> can<00:01:36.290> spell<00:01:36.680> start<00:01:37.399> making<00:01:37.700> their

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
then they can spell start making their

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.260 
then they can spell start making their
pyramids<00:01:38.420> next<00:01:38.990> is<00:01:39.140> 1<00:01:39.470> plus<00:01:39.770> or<00:01:40.040> that's<00:01:40.909> 5

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
pyramids next is 1 plus or that's 5

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.749 
pyramids next is 1 plus or that's 5
before<00:01:41.960> they<00:01:42.049> can<00:01:42.200> stack<00:01:42.439> it<00:01:42.470> they've<00:01:43.280> got<00:01:43.310> to

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
before they can stack it they've got to

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:46.929 
before they can stack it they've got to
do<00:01:44.600> the<00:01:44.720> math<00:01:44.979> so<00:01:45.979> you<00:01:46.040> can<00:01:46.189> imagine<00:01:46.430> with<00:01:46.759> this

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:46.939 
do the math so you can imagine with this

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:51.160 
do the math so you can imagine with this
whole<00:01:47.180> tub<00:01:47.659> or<00:01:48.079> this<00:01:48.229> whole<00:01:48.409> tube<00:01:49.189> of<00:01:50.170> math

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
whole tub or this whole tube of math

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.469 
whole tub or this whole tube of math
facts<00:01:51.500> they<00:01:52.219> end<00:01:52.399> up<00:01:52.549> making<00:01:52.790> these<00:01:53.030> towers

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
facts they end up making these towers

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.200 
facts they end up making these towers
almost<00:01:53.899> as<00:01:54.049> tall<00:01:54.259> as<00:01:54.320> they<00:01:54.680> are<00:01:54.860> here<00:01:55.159> is<00:01:55.340> what

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
almost as tall as they are here is what

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.060 
almost as tall as they are here is what
the<00:01:56.420> cipher<00:01:57.170> words<00:01:57.320> look<00:01:57.500> like<00:01:57.740> you've

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
the cipher words look like you've

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:59.709 
the cipher words look like you've
