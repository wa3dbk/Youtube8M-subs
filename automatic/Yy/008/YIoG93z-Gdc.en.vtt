00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 And then everyone, calm and graf. 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.660
 bringing another video and today you 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.090
 can see the look a little different 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.120
 half different business totalizing 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.940
 our there android version our new home 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.250
 casemate s2 light authorizing 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.580
 android 2 1 of the current android is 12 with 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.260
 3.6 and until finally samsung released the 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.269
 update for us think is the most 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.720
 wait everybody there you can see 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.939
 with my the prosecution is with 11 android 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.980
 with his point but it's a program 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.320
 that I put a theme plus the version 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.960
 all android to 2.3 county 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.059
 I go to all I 've seen here already I've tried 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.030
 update by cell phone but gave some 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:45.660
 error then updated the business stuff there 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.510
 did not work very well solar continues - but 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.969
 I 'm updating myself now I came here 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.730
 as you can see removed the chip and 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.579
 a memory card for the tpi of 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:00.210
 nothing happens and can reign image of the 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.219
 hiv and now returned isaacs process one 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.809
 little delayed by what I can see there 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.150
 I did not start the download I will not start 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.000
 but there were some travelers process 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.130
 It's going to be a little time-consuming , but for 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.420
 who waited so there is not it a little 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.280
 wait a little bit more it will not 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.630
 change nothing 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.630
 how can a boot 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:27.570
 now it will download the update from 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:29.159
 my opponent is just beginning to think that 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.619
 this fast even 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.570
 but there it is only to begin I think it's kind 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.880
 package in order to receive the 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.250
 official update even the authorization 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.930
 official from samsung and here nothing from ruth 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.930
 not original anyway 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.730
 so that's when we get back to video icon 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.020
 and we are going back still as it goes 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:51.660
 something happen 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.040
 as it is going to change something in the 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:56.300
 step by step we will come back to 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:02:00.690
 invitation looks and just a little something 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:03.060
 destination on the screen and you can see sent 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.010
 that little one who download 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.580
 It's over and now it's going to start I think 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.720
 is now installing the same and android 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.510
 how can you see if she also 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.489
 continued the same way changed nothing 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.130
 I do not know if it's going to call, it's going to start 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:19.320
 now is the part of the address of the 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.840
 download because it will change all the 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.820
 system will install a new one you already 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.880
 now that's the boring part of the deal 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:29.550
 Only it takes forever before it takes too long. 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.250
 but coming back with any changes in 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.260
 Anything to show you. 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.180
 Hey guys, you can see there from a 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.030
 change now users can take off 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.920
 before it was connected now to develop 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.989
 this download phase I think now yes 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.820
 installing if you go see that 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:47.549
 download and completed will start a new 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:50.840
 process has started 12 percent 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:54.690
 I think that right now there's the exchange of 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:56.850
 android the change of you can see 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.489
 accompanies this barbarism that barrinha 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:02.010
 on the vast android accompanying the 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:03.600
 download it now yes it will change the 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.510
 android solar system 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:10.080
 ufa and power to rotate of possible process 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.040
 It took my ass off and this will kill it 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.810
 that 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.150
 Like I said expect a little wait. 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.040
 another platoon wait a little 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.799
 difference there as you can see now 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.750
 the download process and concluded I 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:23.790
 I think now it's changing android 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:28.370
 time this visual you can see here 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:31.079
 It is complete the deal and it was fast 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.700
 even speaking to think so a little 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:36.390
 solar fast started 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:38.940
 she began again we do here 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:44.280
 hands on first hand here the first 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:45.780
 prints directly with the new firmware 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.150
 who can not see that this technique that 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.050
 changed the deadline was Marian was already Marian 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:53.020
 has changed to blue 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:55.090
 the owner of nests are small things that I 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:57.730
 I already answered here by calling 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:01.060
 already toning some things right 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:02.140
 Here 's still think that not 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.940
 will change nothing more 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:08.560
 It's just that for now, here it is. 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:10.900
 everything good everything beauty will do 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.880
 first impressions of it but then it goes 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:16.140
 have more videos in detail of the 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:18.790
 after a week of use and android 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:21.930
 2 light to see how it will look and how 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:23.980
 the owner's impressions and make a 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.320
 test week 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.510
 this performance these things will 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.190
 continue even my fear of 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:34.480
 update their performance 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:37.660
 battery processing as speech spend 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:41.020
 But you have to risk if you have 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:45.490
 update let's update the Italian 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:51.490
 connected the sensor there by updating 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:55.419
 same as you have no idea that 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:58.120
 Wow, that's a good idea. 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:59.230
 optimizing opening system applications 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:03.490
 android update is 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:05.680
 confirming in all but the application 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:08.440
 updating opportunities for contagion 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.790
 complete at startup and that you 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.910
 can see analyzed 

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:18.190
 already the new look of 4.1.2 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:22.930
 Let's see, here it will appear now. 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:25.240
 will fit the brand new galley that are 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:29.260
 my contacts have not changed anything 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:33.460
 It's a good thing I only had contact with a 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:38.860
 already itaÃº is the noise here is also 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:42.419
 thing of samsung thing that changed here a 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:42.419
 theme changed here too 

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:49.690
 I took the 16 chip I did not know that 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:53.740
 I have clothes 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:56.400
 not that notice 11 more fire in 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:58.750
 has nothing to do with popular 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:02.640
 I think he will teach at the moment how 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:02.640
 stir in the mobile thing I already know 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:21.280
 which I think is a backup 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:24.070
 I do not know that your name is drago box now. 

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:24.789
 dropbox is a storage business in 

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:28.410
 a cloud 

00:06:24.789 --> 00:06:33.550
 If you want to kidnap it then it 's 

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:37.600
 complete the beginning of 2010 is this is 

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:40.479
 always that next one does not arrive is one is one 

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:42.789
 suitcase full of wafer type that is 

00:06:40.479 --> 00:06:45.760
 downloaded is downloaded without node 

00:06:42.789 --> 00:06:47.500
 both of us but now let's use the term 

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:52.320
 your own original and here you can 

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:54.850
 confirm the actual update of the 

00:06:52.320 --> 00:07:01.530
 that the first earth first 

00:06:54.850 --> 00:07:06.150
 cell phone fan impressions only 

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:09.820
 Ok, ok, you changed the way. 

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:17.830
 I could see that the galley in one lost nothing 

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:20.050
 even here clothes ok come back here 

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:22.860
 barbaric task that has changed that I do not 

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:26.390
 It was thus if evaded it 

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:31.040
 Teacher, yes things 

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:31.970
 which is to close basic things that has changed 

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:34.790
 but that there is no big difference 

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:37.670
 then the month you pressed a button 

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:39.920
 here 3rd middle menu button my fine 

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:42.920
 it was not like that, you can not have change and 

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:44.570
 This hurts nothing, I did not want to have to erase. 

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:46.100
 the historical Matthew was teaching that 

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:49.100
 he already has a little more experience with 

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:51.260
 the camera also changed the 

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:57.230
 cane opened and must have changed and 

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:59.750
 Let's see you sent the icons 

00:07:57.230 --> 00:08:03.410
 Sometimes in the ask the oc is a recovery one 

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:05.030
 little but that's a little pity the 

00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:07.430
 first impressions of the phone that 

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:09.380
 I ended up updating this week 

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:11.690
 I'm going to touch him and I'll see how the 

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:13.490
 performance and next week a video 

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:17.390
 Full to show you how to 

00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:21.040
 really was your home 

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:21.040
 Thanks people that's it
