00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.330 
different versions of the zenfone 2
models<00:02:28.300> so<00:02:29.050> I'll<00:02:29.260> put<00:02:29.440> it<00:02:29.530> in<00:02:29.650> a<00:02:29.710> table<00:02:29.860> format

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
models so I'll put it in a table format

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.240 
models so I'll put it in a table format
so<00:02:30.520> you<00:02:30.580> can<00:02:30.790> see<00:02:30.940> the<00:02:31.060> actual<00:02:31.210> differences

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
so you can see the actual differences

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.980 
so you can see the actual differences
