how to solve the bottom layer using the

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.660 
how to solve the bottom layer using the
ideal<00:00:06.690> solution<00:00:07.170> now<00:00:08.010> I'm<00:00:08.280> going<00:00:08.429> to<00:00:08.490> show<00:00:08.639> you

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
ideal solution now I'm going to show you

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.839 
ideal solution now I'm going to show you
how<00:00:08.820> to<00:00:08.880> solve<00:00:09.090> the<00:00:09.510> keyhole<00:00:09.900> piece<00:00:10.170> and<00:00:10.849> the

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
how to solve the keyhole piece and the

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.330 
how to solve the keyhole piece and the
middle<00:00:12.090> layer<00:00:12.269> all<00:00:12.840> right<00:00:13.019> so<00:00:13.860> to<00:00:13.950> solve<00:00:14.160> the

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
middle layer all right so to solve the

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.740 
middle layer all right so to solve the
keyhole<00:00:14.700> piece<00:00:14.910> the<00:00:15.120> first<00:00:15.330> thing<00:00:15.540> you<00:00:15.630> have

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
keyhole piece the first thing you have

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.300 
keyhole piece the first thing you have
to<00:00:15.870> do<00:00:16.020> is<00:00:16.320> you<00:00:16.500> have<00:00:16.619> to<00:00:16.650> locate<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:17.190> key

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
to do is you have to locate the key

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.410 
to do is you have to locate the key
whole<00:00:17.580> piece<00:00:17.730> and<00:00:17.760> find<00:00:18.150> it

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
whole piece and find it

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.140 
whole piece and find it
okay<00:00:18.690> now<00:00:19.500> this<00:00:20.340> sides<00:00:20.609> going<00:00:20.789> to<00:00:20.880> be<00:00:20.939> white

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
okay now this sides going to be white

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.929 
okay now this sides going to be white
and<00:00:21.600> this<00:00:21.750> sides<00:00:21.990> going<00:00:22.170> to<00:00:22.260> be<00:00:22.320> green<00:00:22.590> okay<00:00:23.189> so

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
and this sides going to be green okay so

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.910 
and this sides going to be green okay so
obviously<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.689> white<00:00:24.900> and<00:00:25.080> green<00:00:25.260> piece<00:00:25.590> goes

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
obviously the white and green piece goes

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.620 
obviously the white and green piece goes
here<00:00:25.949> all<00:00:26.550> right<00:00:26.699> so<00:00:26.760> you<00:00:26.970> need<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.210> find<00:00:27.480> that

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
here all right so you need to find that

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.019 
here all right so you need to find that
white<00:00:27.840> and<00:00:28.019> green<00:00:28.170> piece<00:00:28.490> and<00:00:29.490> in<00:00:29.640> this<00:00:29.789> case

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
white and green piece and in this case

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.179 
white and green piece and in this case
it's<00:00:30.599> already<00:00:30.900> in<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.230> stash<00:00:31.500> spot<00:00:31.830> over<00:00:32.160> here

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
it's already in the stash spot over here

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.610 
it's already in the stash spot over here
okay<00:00:32.880> this<00:00:33.360> is<00:00:33.690> your<00:00:33.809> keyhole<00:00:34.170> piece<00:00:34.350> and

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
okay this is your keyhole piece and

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.709 
okay this is your keyhole piece and
there's<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.950> stash<00:00:35.190> spot<00:00:35.460> okay<00:00:35.760> that's<00:00:36.510> where

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
there's the stash spot okay that's where

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:37.940 
there's the stash spot okay that's where
you're<00:00:36.840> going<00:00:36.960> to<00:00:36.989> want<00:00:37.200> it<00:00:37.260> to<00:00:37.380> go<00:00:37.530> but<00:00:37.920> let's

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
you're going to want it to go but let's

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.650 
you're going to want it to go but let's
say<00:00:38.250> it<00:00:38.340> was<00:00:38.370> over<00:00:38.610> here<00:00:39.000> okay

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
say it was over here okay

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.830 
say it was over here okay
you<00:00:40.260> would<00:00:40.410> just<00:00:40.559> rotate<00:00:41.100> it<00:00:41.510> rotate<00:00:42.510> the

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
you would just rotate it rotate the

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.450 
you would just rotate it rotate the
middle<00:00:43.050> layer<00:00:43.200> until<00:00:43.860> it's<00:00:44.010> in<00:00:44.129> your<00:00:44.219> stash

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
middle layer until it's in your stash

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.900 
middle layer until it's in your stash
spot<00:00:44.760> all<00:00:44.910> right<00:00:45.140> now<00:00:46.140> from<00:00:46.559> here<00:00:46.980> what<00:00:47.550> you<00:00:47.579> do

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
spot all right now from here what you do

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.540 
spot all right now from here what you do
is<00:00:48.120> you<00:00:49.079> rotate<00:00:49.530> your<00:00:49.710> keyhole<00:00:50.100> piece<00:00:50.309> down

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
is you rotate your keyhole piece down

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.819 
is you rotate your keyhole piece down
and<00:00:50.879> then<00:00:51.719> you're<00:00:51.870> going<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:52.020> take<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.530> keep

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
and then you're going to take the keep

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.770 
and then you're going to take the keep
the<00:00:53.010> piece<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:53.699> instead<00:00:54.270> of<00:00:54.390> just<00:00:54.539> sticking

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
the piece and instead of just sticking

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.930 
the piece and instead of just sticking
it<00:00:55.079> into<00:00:55.199> place<00:00:55.520> you're<00:00:56.520> actually<00:00:56.789> going<00:00:56.879> to

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
it into place you're actually going to

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.150 
it into place you're actually going to
move<00:00:57.090> it<00:00:57.180> away<00:00:57.300> from<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.230> keyhole<00:00:58.410> piece<00:00:58.739> okay

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
move it away from the keyhole piece okay

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.979 
move it away from the keyhole piece okay
you<00:00:59.520> put<00:00:59.789> it<00:00:59.879> even<00:01:00.059> further<00:01:00.239> back<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.750> a<00:01:00.809> key

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
you put it even further back and a key

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.979 
you put it even further back and a key
over<00:01:01.320> here<00:01:01.350> all<00:01:01.859> right<00:01:02.120> then<00:01:03.120> you<00:01:03.719> take<00:01:03.960> your

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
over here all right then you take your

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.020 
over here all right then you take your
keyhole<00:01:04.470> piece<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.400> put<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:05.729> on<00:01:05.880> the

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
keyhole piece and you put it on the

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.000 
keyhole piece and you put it on the
other<00:01:06.150> side<00:01:06.299> over<00:01:06.810> here<00:01:07.170> okay<00:01:07.439> just<00:01:07.650> rotate<00:01:07.979> it

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
other side over here okay just rotate it

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.090 
other side over here okay just rotate it
like<00:01:08.220> that<00:01:08.460> put<00:01:08.729> it<00:01:08.970> over<00:01:09.150> there<00:01:09.450> okay<00:01:10.100> then

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
like that put it over there okay then

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.320 
like that put it over there okay then
you<00:01:11.520> rotate<00:01:11.880> your<00:01:12.030> middle<00:01:12.240> layer<00:01:12.890> until<00:01:14.330> the

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
you rotate your middle layer until the

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.300 
you rotate your middle layer until the
keyhole<00:01:15.689> piece<00:01:15.869> is<00:01:16.080> solved<00:01:16.409> in<00:01:16.470> place<00:01:16.860> right

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
keyhole piece is solved in place right

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.370 
keyhole piece is solved in place right
then<00:01:18.000> move<00:01:18.270> it<00:01:18.390> up<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:18.750> just<00:01:18.900> stick<00:01:19.080> it<00:01:19.110> into

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
then move it up and just stick it into

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.820 
then move it up and just stick it into
position

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
position

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.810 
position
all<00:01:20.189> right<00:01:20.420> now<00:01:21.420> a<00:01:21.810> lot<00:01:22.380> of<00:01:22.409> times<00:01:22.770> when<00:01:23.549> you<00:01:23.670> do

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
all right now a lot of times when you do

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.580 
all right now a lot of times when you do
that<00:01:24.030> this<00:01:24.570> piece<00:01:24.810> is<00:01:24.960> actually<00:01:25.110> going<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:25.470> be

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
that this piece is actually going to be

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.310 
that this piece is actually going to be
in<00:01:25.740> backwards<00:01:26.310> okay<00:01:27.030> it's<00:01:27.960> going<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.229> look

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
in backwards okay it's going to look

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.410 
in backwards okay it's going to look
like<00:01:28.380> this<00:01:30.829> okay<00:01:32.030> sometimes<00:01:33.030> it's<00:01:33.210> going<00:01:33.360> to

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
like this okay sometimes it's going to

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.630 
like this okay sometimes it's going to
look<00:01:33.540> like<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:34.040> where<00:01:35.040> it's<00:01:35.220> in<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.460> right

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
look like that where it's in the right

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.850 
look like that where it's in the right
spot<00:01:35.909> but<00:01:35.939> it's<00:01:36.299> backwards<00:01:36.590> now<00:01:37.590> if<00:01:37.710> that

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
spot but it's backwards now if that

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.760 
spot but it's backwards now if that
happens<00:01:38.430> what<00:01:39.210> you<00:01:39.299> do<00:01:39.479> is<00:01:40.170> your<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:40.439> take<00:01:40.680> the

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
happens what you do is your I take the

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.639 
happens what you do is your I take the
cube<00:01:40.920> like<00:01:41.130> this<00:01:41.840> you<00:01:42.840> take<00:01:43.020> that<00:01:43.200> piece<00:01:43.470> and

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
cube like this you take that piece and

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:44.990 
cube like this you take that piece and
you<00:01:43.740> move<00:01:43.979> it<00:01:44.100> down<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:44.520> put<00:01:44.670> it<00:01:44.759> in<00:01:44.850> your

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
you move it down and put it in your

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.679 
you move it down and put it in your
stash<00:01:45.240> spot<00:01:45.570> okay<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:46.649> from<00:01:47.369> here<00:01:47.790> instead<00:01:48.390> of

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
stash spot okay and from here instead of

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.300 
stash spot okay and from here instead of
just<00:01:48.840> moving<00:01:49.320> it<00:01:49.409> away<00:01:49.649> from<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.100> keyhole

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
just moving it away from the keyhole

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.340 
just moving it away from the keyhole
piece<00:01:50.670> you<00:01:51.479> got<00:01:51.570> to<00:01:51.689> put<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.899> keyhole<00:01:52.200> piece

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
piece you got to put the keyhole piece

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.480 
piece you got to put the keyhole piece
back<00:01:52.649> up<00:01:52.860> top<00:01:53.070> first<00:01:53.430> okay<00:01:54.740> then<00:01:55.740> you<00:01:56.189> move<00:01:56.369> it

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
back up top first okay then you move it

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.410 
back up top first okay then you move it
away<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:56.939> put<00:01:57.000> it<00:01:57.840> back<00:01:58.020> here<00:01:58.290> all<00:01:59.130> right<00:01:59.420> now

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
away and put it back here all right now

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.179 
away and put it back here all right now
you<00:02:00.930> take<00:02:01.079> your<00:02:01.140> keyhole<00:02:01.590> piece<00:02:01.799> and<00:02:02.009> put<00:02:02.159> it

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
you take your keyhole piece and put it

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.389 
you take your keyhole piece and put it
down<00:02:02.369> on<00:02:02.430> this<00:02:02.729> side<00:02:03.469> and<00:02:04.469> then<00:02:04.979> just<00:02:05.009> put<00:02:05.310> the

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
down on this side and then just put the

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:06.960 
down on this side and then just put the
piece<00:02:05.579> into<00:02:05.759> position

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
piece into position

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.870 
piece into position
all<00:02:07.720> right<00:02:07.870> and<00:02:08.320> they'll<00:02:08.530> solve<00:02:08.830> it<00:02:09.040> all<00:02:09.670> right

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
all right and they'll solve it all right

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.990 
all right and they'll solve it all right
so<00:02:10.780> that<00:02:10.960> solved<00:02:11.470> your<00:02:11.860> top<00:02:12.100> layer<00:02:12.400> completely

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
so that solved your top layer completely

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.250 
so that solved your top layer completely
and<00:02:13.150> your<00:02:13.240> bottom<00:02:13.540> layer<00:02:13.660> is<00:02:13.720> completely

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
and your bottom layer is completely

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.020 
and your bottom layer is completely
solved<00:02:14.620> now<00:02:14.740> just<00:02:15.430> takes<00:02:15.580> a<00:02:15.670> little<00:02:15.790> bit<00:02:15.940> of

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
solved now just takes a little bit of

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.910 
solved now just takes a little bit of
practice<00:02:16.240> of<00:02:16.750> solving<00:02:17.260> the<00:02:17.350> keyhole<00:02:17.680> piece

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
practice of solving the keyhole piece

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.740 
practice of solving the keyhole piece
okay<00:02:18.580> just<00:02:18.790> remember<00:02:18.880> keep<00:02:19.180> your<00:02:19.330> tube

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
okay just remember keep your tube

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.900 
okay just remember keep your tube
orientated<00:02:20.530> so<00:02:20.650> your<00:02:21.100> keyhole<00:02:21.430> piece<00:02:21.610> is<00:02:21.790> over

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
orientated so your keyhole piece is over

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.660 
orientated so your keyhole piece is over
here<00:02:22.330> and<00:02:23.170> then<00:02:23.320> stash<00:02:23.680> it<00:02:23.920> over<00:02:24.160> here<00:02:24.490> and

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
here and then stash it over here and

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.510 
here and then stash it over here and
then<00:02:25.360> move<00:02:25.720> it<00:02:25.870> away<00:02:26.040> put<00:02:27.040> it<00:02:27.160> on<00:02:27.250> the<00:02:27.400> other

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
then move it away put it on the other

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.610 
then move it away put it on the other
side<00:02:27.820> and<00:02:28.150> put<00:02:28.300> it<00:02:28.390> in<00:02:28.510> and<00:02:29.320> you'd<00:02:29.440> probably

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
side and put it in and you'd probably

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.380 
side and put it in and you'd probably
have<00:02:29.830> to<00:02:29.890> practice<00:02:30.430> it<00:02:30.520> a<00:02:30.580> little<00:02:30.760> bit<00:02:30.910> but<00:02:31.150> I

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
have to practice it a little bit but I

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:32.940 
have to practice it a little bit but I
explained<00:02:31.990> it<00:02:32.110> well<00:02:32.200> enough<00:02:32.440> so<00:02:32.590> you<00:02:32.680> should

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
explained it well enough so you should

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.530 
explained it well enough so you should
be<00:02:33.100> able<00:02:33.220> to<00:02:33.430> do<00:02:33.550> it<00:02:33.700> after<00:02:33.820> just<00:02:34.000> a<00:02:34.240> couple<00:02:34.420> of

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
be able to do it after just a couple of

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.580 
be able to do it after just a couple of
tries<00:02:34.810> okay<00:02:36.030> so<00:02:37.030> now<00:02:37.210> the<00:02:37.930> next<00:02:38.080> thing<00:02:38.350> to<00:02:38.470> do

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
tries okay so now the next thing to do

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.350 
tries okay so now the next thing to do
is<00:02:38.620> to<00:02:38.860> finish<00:02:39.040> solving<00:02:39.310> the<00:02:39.910> middle<00:02:40.180> layer

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
is to finish solving the middle layer

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.470 
is to finish solving the middle layer
all<00:02:40.900> right<00:02:41.520> and<00:02:42.520> the<00:02:42.640> first<00:02:42.850> thing<00:02:43.120> you<00:02:43.240> do

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
all right and the first thing you do

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.320 
all right and the first thing you do
when<00:02:43.870> solving<00:02:44.290> the<00:02:44.380> middle<00:02:44.620> layer<00:02:44.800> is<00:02:45.090> you<00:02:46.090> try

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
when solving the middle layer is you try

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.449 
when solving the middle layer is you try
and<00:02:46.480> find<00:02:46.690> one<00:02:47.170> of<00:02:47.200> these<00:02:47.500> side<00:02:47.830> pieces<00:02:48.130> in<00:02:48.400> the

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
and find one of these side pieces in the

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.910 
and find one of these side pieces in the
middle<00:02:48.580> layer<00:02:48.880> that<00:02:49.690> it's<00:02:49.840> that<00:02:50.200> is<00:02:50.380> in<00:02:50.650> its

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
middle layer that it's that is in its

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.560 
middle layer that it's that is in its
correct<00:02:51.310> position<00:02:51.990> okay<00:02:53.020> for<00:02:53.860> example<00:02:54.570> the

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
correct position okay for example the

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:56.940 
correct position okay for example the
red<00:02:55.750> and<00:02:55.930> green<00:02:56.140> piece<00:02:56.380> should<00:02:56.560> be<00:02:56.620> right<00:02:56.920> here

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
red and green piece should be right here

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.500 
red and green piece should be right here
because<00:02:57.370> this<00:02:57.490> sides<00:02:57.730> red<00:02:58.030> and<00:02:58.240> the<00:02:58.300> sites

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
because this sides red and the sites

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.240 
because this sides red and the sites
green<00:02:58.840> notice<00:02:59.350> the<00:02:59.440> blue<00:02:59.620> and<00:02:59.740> orange<00:02:59.890> ones

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
green notice the blue and orange ones

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.970 
green notice the blue and orange ones
there<00:03:00.459> okay<00:03:00.730> so<00:03:00.790> that's<00:03:01.090> wrong<00:03:01.800> this<00:03:02.800> should

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
there okay so that's wrong this should

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.350 
there okay so that's wrong this should
be<00:03:03.070> the<00:03:03.220> green<00:03:03.430> orange<00:03:03.790> and<00:03:03.940> it's<00:03:04.030> the<00:03:04.150> green

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
be the green orange and it's the green

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.290 
be the green orange and it's the green
red<00:03:04.600> so<00:03:04.810> that<00:03:04.840> one's<00:03:05.170> wrong<00:03:05.970> this<00:03:06.970> one<00:03:07.180> it's

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
red so that one's wrong this one it's

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.699 
red so that one's wrong this one it's
orange<00:03:07.600> green<00:03:07.810> and<00:03:08.020> it<00:03:08.080> should<00:03:08.260> be<00:03:08.380> orange

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
orange green and it should be orange

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.790 
orange green and it should be orange
blue<00:03:09.040> so<00:03:09.610> that<00:03:09.640> one's<00:03:09.970> wrong<00:03:10.170> but<00:03:11.170> over<00:03:11.410> here

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
blue so that one's wrong but over here

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.100 
blue so that one's wrong but over here
we<00:03:12.519> have<00:03:12.670> the<00:03:12.820> red<00:03:13.060> blue<00:03:13.360> piece<00:03:13.660> in<00:03:13.959> its

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
we have the red blue piece in its

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.229 
we have the red blue piece in its
correct<00:03:14.350> position<00:03:14.590> it's<00:03:15.430> just<00:03:15.760> not<00:03:15.940> color

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
correct position it's just not color

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:19.470 
correct position it's just not color
aligned<00:03:16.600> okay<00:03:17.260> so<00:03:18.130> what<00:03:18.310> you<00:03:18.430> do<00:03:18.670> is<00:03:19.090> you<00:03:19.300> take

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
aligned okay so what you do is you take

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.060 
aligned okay so what you do is you take
the<00:03:19.630> piece<00:03:19.840> that's<00:03:20.080> in<00:03:20.200> its<00:03:20.320> correct<00:03:20.530> position

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
the piece that's in its correct position

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:23.130 
the piece that's in its correct position
and<00:03:21.190> you<00:03:21.700> put<00:03:21.880> it<00:03:21.970> over<00:03:22.120> here<00:03:22.540> in<00:03:22.630> the<00:03:22.660> back<00:03:22.930> of

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
and you put it over here in the back of

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.350 
and you put it over here in the back of
the<00:03:23.200> cube<00:03:23.500> okay<00:03:24.280> where<00:03:24.550> you<00:03:24.640> can't<00:03:24.940> see<00:03:25.239> it

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
the cube okay where you can't see it

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.320 
the cube okay where you can't see it
this<00:03:26.260> sides<00:03:26.590> facing<00:03:27.130> you<00:03:27.310> and<00:03:27.610> it's<00:03:28.060> dashed

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.330 
this sides facing you and it's dashed

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.360 
this sides facing you and it's dashed
over<00:03:28.570> here<00:03:28.930> where<00:03:29.470> you<00:03:29.560> can't<00:03:29.800> see<00:03:30.070> it

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
over here where you can't see it

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.020 
over here where you can't see it
all<00:03:30.610> right<00:03:30.790> now<00:03:31.920> besides<00:03:32.920> that<00:03:33.340> scenario

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
all right now besides that scenario

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.910 
all right now besides that scenario
there's<00:03:34.720> another<00:03:34.959> scenario<00:03:35.230> where<00:03:35.470> none<00:03:35.890> of

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
there's another scenario where none of

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.949 
there's another scenario where none of
the<00:03:36.430> side<00:03:36.640> pieces<00:03:36.820> are<00:03:37.180> in<00:03:37.299> the<00:03:37.390> correct<00:03:37.600> spot

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
the side pieces are in the correct spot

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:40.710 
the side pieces are in the correct spot
and<00:03:38.709> if<00:03:38.799> that<00:03:38.950> happens<00:03:39.400> just<00:03:40.060> go<00:03:40.209> ahead<00:03:40.450> and<00:03:40.570> do

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
and if that happens just go ahead and do

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.390 
and if that happens just go ahead and do
the<00:03:40.840> algorithm<00:03:41.170> about<00:03:41.590> to<00:03:41.709> show<00:03:41.860> you<00:03:41.920> anyway

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
the algorithm about to show you anyway

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.430 
the algorithm about to show you anyway
all<00:03:42.760> right<00:03:42.910> but<00:03:43.150> usually<00:03:43.600> you<00:03:43.690> can<00:03:43.840> find<00:03:44.080> one

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
all right but usually you can find one

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.440 
all right but usually you can find one
piece<00:03:44.680> that's<00:03:44.950> in<00:03:45.040> its<00:03:45.160> correct<00:03:45.459> spot<00:03:45.760> if<00:03:46.239> you

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
piece that's in its correct spot if you

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.600 
piece that's in its correct spot if you
can't<00:03:46.690> do<00:03:47.260> the<00:03:47.380> algorithm<00:03:47.680> anyway<00:03:48.160> from<00:03:48.459> any

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.610 
can't do the algorithm anyway from any

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:50.490 
can't do the algorithm anyway from any
position<00:03:49.000> you<00:03:49.030> want<00:03:49.120> all<00:03:49.450> right<00:03:49.600> so<00:03:50.380> remember

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
position you want all right so remember

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.229 
position you want all right so remember
if<00:03:50.920> you<00:03:51.040> have<00:03:51.190> one<00:03:51.430> that's<00:03:51.580> correct

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 
if you have one that's correct

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:54.600 
if you have one that's correct
put<00:03:52.870> it<00:03:52.989> here<00:03:53.170> in<00:03:53.260> the<00:03:53.350> back<00:03:53.500> and<00:03:53.769> do<00:03:54.489> this

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
put it here in the back and do this

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.420 
put it here in the back and do this
algorithm<00:03:55.000> it's<00:03:55.450> super<00:03:56.110> duper<00:03:56.230> easy<00:03:56.410> okay<00:03:57.370> you

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
algorithm it's super duper easy okay you

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.210 
algorithm it's super duper easy okay you
take<00:03:57.730> the<00:03:57.790> center<00:03:58.180> and<00:03:58.390> move<00:03:58.930> it<00:03:59.049> up<00:03:59.220> right

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
take the center and move it up right

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:05.070 
take the center and move it up right
like<00:04:00.400> that<00:04:01.200> twist<00:04:02.200> the<00:04:02.380> top<00:04:02.590> twice<00:04:03.010> and<00:04:04.080> Center

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:05.080 
like that twist the top twice and Center

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.290 
like that twist the top twice and Center
back<00:04:05.260> down

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:06.300 
back down

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:10.160 
back down
twist<00:04:07.050> the<00:04:07.230> top<00:04:07.410> twice<00:04:07.770> okay<00:04:08.730> and<00:04:09.450> you're<00:04:10.020> just

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
twist the top twice okay and you're just

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.980 
twist the top twice okay and you're just
going<00:04:10.350> to<00:04:10.380> keep<00:04:10.650> doing<00:04:10.980> that<00:04:11.190> until<00:04:11.640> the<00:04:12.600> side

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:12.990 
going to keep doing that until the side

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:15.440 
going to keep doing that until the side
piece<00:04:13.230> facing<00:04:13.770> you<00:04:13.860> is<00:04:14.070> solved<00:04:14.700> okay

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
piece facing you is solved okay

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.300 
piece facing you is solved okay
so<00:04:15.900> I'm<00:04:15.990> going<00:04:16.110> to<00:04:16.140> do<00:04:16.260> it<00:04:16.350> again<00:04:16.800> Center<00:04:17.610> up

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
so I'm going to do it again Center up

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:27.080 
so I'm going to do it again Center up
twist<00:04:20.310> twice<00:04:21.770> Center<00:04:22.770> down<00:04:23.870> twist<00:04:24.870> twice<00:04:26.090> okay

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
twist twice Center down twist twice okay

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.180 
twist twice Center down twist twice okay
so<00:04:27.780> you<00:04:27.870> can<00:04:28.020> see<00:04:28.230> that<00:04:28.440> the<00:04:28.830> one<00:04:28.980> that<00:04:29.070> was

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
so you can see that the one that was

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.490 
so you can see that the one that was
facing<00:04:29.520> you<00:04:29.610> is<00:04:29.700> now<00:04:29.850> solved<00:04:30.390> and<00:04:31.320> the<00:04:31.410> one

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
facing you is now solved and the one

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.260 
facing you is now solved and the one
across<00:04:31.740> from<00:04:31.800> it<00:04:32.010> is<00:04:32.130> solved<00:04:32.550> but<00:04:33.090> when<00:04:33.210> we

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
across from it is solved but when we

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.200 
across from it is solved but when we
look<00:04:33.420> at<00:04:33.510> the<00:04:33.630> bottom<00:04:34.190> you<00:04:35.190> can<00:04:35.370> see<00:04:35.400> that<00:04:35.580> this

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
look at the bottom you can see that this

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:37.880 
look at the bottom you can see that this
is<00:04:36.420> in<00:04:36.540> the<00:04:36.570> correct<00:04:36.810> position<00:04:37.020> still<00:04:37.530> and

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:37.890 
is in the correct position still and

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:39.950 
is in the correct position still and
this<00:04:38.670> one<00:04:38.880> is<00:04:38.940> in<00:04:39.000> its<00:04:39.180> correct<00:04:39.450> position<00:04:39.570> but

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
this one is in its correct position but

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.330 
this one is in its correct position but
both<00:04:40.140> of<00:04:40.350> these<00:04:40.440> need<00:04:40.650> to<00:04:40.710> be<00:04:40.860> flipped<00:04:41.130> around

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
both of these need to be flipped around

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:42.770 
both of these need to be flipped around
all<00:04:41.790> right<00:04:41.880> they<00:04:42.000> need<00:04:42.060> to<00:04:42.180> be<00:04:42.240> twisted<00:04:42.690> in

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
all right they need to be twisted in

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.560 
all right they need to be twisted in
their<00:04:42.900> position<00:04:43.380> all<00:04:43.800> right<00:04:44.040> and<00:04:44.850> sometimes

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
their position all right and sometimes

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:47.960 
their position all right and sometimes
you're<00:04:46.230> going<00:04:46.320> to<00:04:46.380> have<00:04:46.440> all<00:04:46.770> four<00:04:47.370> side

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
you're going to have all four side

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.540 
you're going to have all four side
pieces<00:04:48.270> that<00:04:48.990> need<00:04:49.140> to<00:04:49.230> be<00:04:49.290> twisted<00:04:50.010> around<00:04:50.100> in

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
pieces that need to be twisted around in

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.540 
pieces that need to be twisted around in
their<00:04:50.700> position<00:04:51.180> all<00:04:51.720> right<00:04:51.920> sometimes<00:04:52.920> also

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
their position all right sometimes also

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.250 
their position all right sometimes also
you're<00:04:54.210> going<00:04:54.300> to<00:04:54.390> have<00:04:54.510> two<00:04:54.690> pieces<00:04:54.870> that<00:04:55.110> are

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.260 
you're going to have two pieces that are

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.380 
you're going to have two pieces that are
diagonal<00:04:56.250> from<00:04:56.430> each<00:04:56.550> other<00:04:56.760> like<00:04:56.820> this<00:04:57.180> one

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:57.390 
diagonal from each other like this one

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:58.940 
diagonal from each other like this one
and<00:04:57.630> that<00:04:57.810> one<00:04:57.870> need<00:04:58.290> to<00:04:58.320> be<00:04:58.470> twisted<00:04:58.680> around

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:58.950 
and that one need to be twisted around

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:00.740 
and that one need to be twisted around
and<00:04:59.550> I'll<00:04:59.640> cover<00:04:59.880> that<00:05:00.000> in<00:05:00.120> a<00:05:00.240> second<00:05:00.630> all

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
and I'll cover that in a second all

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:00.920 
and I'll cover that in a second all
right

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
right

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.440 
right
usually<00:05:01.890> it's<00:05:02.040> like<00:05:02.130> this<00:05:02.490> though<00:05:02.700> where<00:05:03.360> you

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:03.450 
usually it's like this though where you

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:06.110 
usually it's like this though where you
have<00:05:03.630> two<00:05:03.900> okay<00:05:04.530> and<00:05:04.710> this<00:05:05.250> is<00:05:05.460> where<00:05:05.640> you<00:05:05.790> use

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
have two okay and this is where you use

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.290 
have two okay and this is where you use
what's<00:05:06.840> known<00:05:07.050> as<00:05:07.200> the<00:05:07.470> Rubik<00:05:07.890> maneuver<00:05:08.550> okay

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
what's known as the Rubik maneuver okay

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.410 
what's known as the Rubik maneuver okay
this<00:05:10.200> is<00:05:10.410> the<00:05:10.560> ideal<00:05:10.860> solution<00:05:11.100> this<00:05:12.060> is<00:05:12.120> the

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:12.420 
this is the ideal solution this is the

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.720 
this is the ideal solution this is the
Rubik<00:05:12.720> maneuver<00:05:13.140> supposedly<00:05:13.980> invented<00:05:14.580> by

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:14.730 
Rubik maneuver supposedly invented by

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:17.900 
Rubik maneuver supposedly invented by
Erno<00:05:14.940> Rubik<00:05:15.720> okay<00:05:16.410> you<00:05:17.280> put<00:05:17.460> the<00:05:17.580> two<00:05:17.700> pieces

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:17.910 
Erno Rubik okay you put the two pieces

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:19.820 
Erno Rubik okay you put the two pieces
that<00:05:18.300> you<00:05:18.390> want<00:05:18.600> to<00:05:18.690> have<00:05:18.810> flipped<00:05:19.170> around<00:05:19.500> on

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830 
that you want to have flipped around on

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.040 
that you want to have flipped around on

twist<00:05:44.580> the<00:05:45.120> top<00:05:45.330> twice<00:05:45.750> and<00:05:46.680> as<00:05:46.860> you<00:05:46.950> can<00:05:47.040> see

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:47.100 
twist the top twice and as you can see

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.340 
twist the top twice and as you can see
that<00:05:47.460> went<00:05:47.670> ahead<00:05:47.730> and<00:05:47.940> solve<00:05:48.180> the<00:05:48.360> cube<00:05:48.570> okay

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:49.350 
that went ahead and solve the cube okay

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:59.800 
that went ahead and solve the cube okay
but<00:05:50.190> a<00:05:50.220> lot<00:05:50.400> of<00:05:50.430> times<00:05:50.700> it<00:05:50.880> looks<00:05:51.060> like<00:05:51.210> this

00:05:59.800 --> 00:05:59.810 

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:02.690 

these<00:06:00.810> two<00:06:01.020> are<00:06:01.140> screwed<00:06:01.410> up<00:06:01.560> and<00:06:01.770> the<00:06:02.400> ones<00:06:02.580> on

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:02.700 
these two are screwed up and the ones on

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:09.650 
these two are screwed up and the ones on
the<00:06:02.850> other<00:06:02.970> side<00:06:03.240> are<00:06:03.750> screwed<00:06:04.110> up<00:06:08.600> all<00:06:09.600> right

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:09.660 
the other side are screwed up all right

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:12.530 
the other side are screwed up all right
so<00:06:10.440> if<00:06:10.650> it's<00:06:10.950> like<00:06:11.220> this<00:06:11.490> where<00:06:11.820> you<00:06:12.090> got<00:06:12.210> every

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:12.540 
so if it's like this where you got every

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:15.350 
so if it's like this where you got every
piece<00:06:12.780> is<00:06:13.410> in<00:06:13.620> its<00:06:13.770> correct<00:06:14.040> spot<00:06:14.460> but<00:06:15.270> they

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.360 
piece is in its correct spot but they

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.420 
piece is in its correct spot but they
just<00:06:15.510> need<00:06:15.660> to<00:06:15.780> be<00:06:15.810> twisted<00:06:16.350> you<00:06:16.950> just<00:06:17.130> simply

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:49.080 
twist twist and that solved it okay the

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:51.380 
twist twist and that solved it okay the
last<00:06:49.350> scenario<00:06:49.620> is<00:06:50.160> where<00:06:50.370> you<00:06:50.490> have<00:06:50.670> two<00:06:51.210> that

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:51.390 
last scenario is where you have two that

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:53.180 
last scenario is where you have two that
are<00:06:51.450> diagonal<00:06:52.020> from<00:06:52.170> each<00:06:52.320> other<00:06:52.560> and<00:06:52.770> it

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:53.190 
are diagonal from each other and it

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:56.960 
are diagonal from each other and it
looks<00:06:53.370> like<00:06:53.430> this<00:06:53.730> I<00:06:55.280> have<00:06:56.280> to<00:06:56.430> do<00:06:56.550> the<00:06:56.670> Rubik

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:56.970 
looks like this I have to do the Rubik

00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:00.680 
looks like this I have to do the Rubik
maneuver<00:06:57.740> in<00:06:58.740> order<00:06:58.980> to<00:06:59.210> show<00:07:00.210> ya<00:07:00.390> this<00:07:00.630> is

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:00.690 
maneuver in order to show ya this is

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:06.590 
maneuver in order to show ya this is
done<00:07:03.440> okay<00:07:04.440> so<00:07:05.160> from<00:07:05.340> here<00:07:05.550> you<00:07:05.670> can<00:07:05.790> see<00:07:06.060> you

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:06.600 
done okay so from here you can see you

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:08.420 
done okay so from here you can see you
got<00:07:06.780> these<00:07:06.990> two<00:07:07.230> pieces<00:07:07.470> that<00:07:08.160> need<00:07:08.190> to<00:07:08.400> be

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:08.430 
got these two pieces that need to be

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:10.640 
got these two pieces that need to be
solved<00:07:08.940> all<00:07:09.090> right<00:07:09.300> if<00:07:09.990> that's<00:07:10.200> the<00:07:10.470> scenario

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:10.650 
solved all right if that's the scenario

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:12.950 
solved all right if that's the scenario
all<00:07:11.610> you<00:07:11.790> do<00:07:11.970> is<00:07:12.090> you<00:07:12.210> take<00:07:12.390> one<00:07:12.720> of<00:07:12.750> those

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:12.960 
all you do is you take one of those

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:15.290 
all you do is you take one of those
pieces<00:07:13.170> and<00:07:13.560> you<00:07:13.950> rotate<00:07:14.460> it<00:07:14.640> up<00:07:14.730> until<00:07:15.120> it's

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:15.300 
pieces and you rotate it up until it's

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:17.960 
pieces and you rotate it up until it's
across<00:07:15.630> from<00:07:15.690> the<00:07:16.080> other<00:07:16.110> one<00:07:16.470> okay<00:07:17.040> once<00:07:17.820> it's

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:17.970 
across from the other one okay once it's

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:19.610 
across from the other one okay once it's
like<00:07:18.120> that<00:07:18.360> then<00:07:18.960> just<00:07:19.110> do<00:07:19.200> your<00:07:19.320> Rubik

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:19.620 
like that then just do your Rubik

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:22.940 
like that then just do your Rubik
maneuver<00:07:19.950> Center<00:07:20.610> up<00:07:20.790> twist<00:07:21.540> Center<00:07:22.020> up<00:07:22.320> twist
