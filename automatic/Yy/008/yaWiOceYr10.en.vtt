00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:30.720 
then f then D flat and we do it again
same<00:02:22.180> thing

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.000 

now<00:02:30.940> the<00:02:31.000> third<00:02:31.450> time<00:02:31.750> through<00:02:32.050> it's<00:02:32.500> the<00:02:32.739> same

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
now the third time through it's the same

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.040 
now the third time through it's the same
chord<00:02:33.400> progression<00:02:33.459> and<00:02:34.180> the<00:02:34.270> same<00:02:34.540> outline

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
chord progression and the same outline

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.470 
chord progression and the same outline
of<00:02:35.110> notes<00:02:35.560> but<00:02:36.190> we're<00:02:36.340> going<00:02:36.459> to<00:02:36.550> add<00:02:36.700> one<00:02:37.239> note

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
of notes but we're going to add one note

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.449 
of notes but we're going to add one note
into<00:02:37.840> the<00:02:37.930> middle<00:02:38.200> of<00:02:38.349> this<00:02:38.530> so<00:02:39.129> we're<00:02:39.310> going

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
into the middle of this so we're going

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:42.960 
into the middle of this so we're going
to<00:02:39.580> fill<00:02:39.849> in<00:02:40.060> here<00:02:40.480> with<00:02:40.930> a<00:02:40.959> C<00:02:41.379> with<00:02:42.280> a<00:02:42.310> b-flat

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
to fill in here with a C with a b-flat

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.660 
to fill in here with a C with a b-flat
and<00:02:43.330> with<00:02:43.750> an<00:02:43.900> a-flat<00:02:44.410> and<00:02:44.920> we're<00:02:45.519> going<00:02:45.640> to

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
and with an a-flat and we're going to

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.000 
and with an a-flat and we're going to
play<00:02:45.910> all<00:02:45.940> three<00:02:46.390> notes<00:02:46.599> at<00:02:46.840> once<00:02:46.870> so<00:02:47.739> it<00:02:47.860> will

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
play all three notes at once so it will

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:54.770 
play all three notes at once so it will
sound<00:02:48.250> like<00:02:48.370> this

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.699 

and<00:02:55.260> then<00:02:55.500> we<00:02:55.620> have<00:02:55.800> a<00:02:55.980> d-flat<00:02:56.460> major<00:02:56.580> chord

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
and then we have a d-flat major chord

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.030 
and then we have a d-flat major chord
so<00:02:59.129> left<00:02:59.400> hand<00:02:59.640> is<00:02:59.760> on<00:02:59.909> d-flat<00:03:00.390> and<00:03:01.019> we<00:03:01.709> can<00:03:01.859> use

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
so left hand is on d-flat and we can use

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.039 
so left hand is on d-flat and we can use
these<00:03:02.250> notes<00:03:02.519> here<00:03:03.030> for<00:03:03.299> the<00:03:03.359> right<00:03:03.540> hand<00:03:03.780> D

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
these notes here for the right hand D

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:06.800 
these notes here for the right hand D
flat<00:03:04.439> fa

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
flat fa

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.110 
flat fa
and<00:03:06.900> then<00:03:07.470> for<00:03:07.710> the<00:03:07.770> section<00:03:08.160> that<00:03:08.280> has<00:03:08.520> let

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
and then for the section that has let

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.100 
and then for the section that has let
the<00:03:09.270> storm<00:03:09.570> rage<00:03:09.690> on<00:03:10.140> we'll<00:03:10.560> go<00:03:10.710> from<00:03:10.920> here<00:03:12.110> let

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
the storm rage on we'll go from here let

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.720 
the storm rage on we'll go from here let
the<00:03:13.260> storm<00:03:13.590> rage<00:03:14.040> on

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
the storm rage on

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.890 
the storm rage on
and<00:03:16.260> then<00:03:17.260> we<00:03:18.190> have<00:03:18.340> the<00:03:18.520> court<00:03:18.760> here

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
and then we have the court here

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.559 
and then we have the court here
D<00:03:21.470> flat<00:03:21.769> major<00:03:21.980> and<00:03:22.790> then<00:03:23.060> we<00:03:23.150> had<00:03:23.299> this<00:03:23.390> little

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:23.569 
D flat major and then we had this little

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:25.330 
D flat major and then we had this little
ending<00:03:24.110> which<00:03:24.409> just<00:03:24.709> comes<00:03:24.860> through<00:03:25.190> like

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
ending which just comes through like

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:32.710 
ending which just comes through like
this<00:03:28.090> so<00:03:29.090> a<00:03:29.450> flat<00:03:29.810> on<00:03:29.959> the<00:03:30.049> left<00:03:30.370> and<00:03:31.540> meet<00:03:32.540> a

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
this so a flat on the left and meet a

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.930 
this so a flat on the left and meet a
side<00:03:33.140> and<00:03:33.349> D<00:03:33.500> flat<00:03:33.680> in<00:03:34.010> the<00:03:34.159> right<00:03:34.340> and<00:03:34.790> it's

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
side and D flat in the right and it's

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.930 
side and D flat in the right and it's
going<00:03:35.120> to<00:03:35.180> go

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
going to go

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.080 
going to go
so<00:03:37.450> left<00:03:37.900> right<00:03:38.230> left<00:03:38.260> right<00:03:38.710> and<00:03:39.220> then<00:03:39.370> we're

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
so left right left right and then we're

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:41.880 
so left right left right and then we're
gonna<00:03:40.180> go<00:03:40.300> to<00:03:40.330> e-flat<00:03:40.870> and<00:03:41.200> change<00:03:41.530> this<00:03:41.680> note

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
gonna go to e-flat and change this note

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:43.680 
gonna go to e-flat and change this note
to<00:03:41.920> see
