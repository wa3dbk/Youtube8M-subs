hi<00:00:00.539> I'm<00:00:00.690> Farley<00:00:00.900> still<00:00:01.290> talking<00:00:01.589> about<00:00:01.680> wine

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:01.979 
hi I'm Farley still talking about wine

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.150 
hi I'm Farley still talking about wine
today<00:00:02.250> and<00:00:02.870> I<00:00:03.870> think<00:00:04.500> something<00:00:04.890> that<00:00:05.009> also

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
today and I think something that also

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.849 
today and I think something that also
confuses<00:00:05.819> people<00:00:05.850> is<00:00:06.450> determining<00:00:07.170> whether<00:00:07.379> a

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
confuses people is determining whether a

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.700 
confuses people is determining whether a
wine<00:00:08.370> is<00:00:08.550> bad<00:00:08.760> or<00:00:08.790> not<00:00:09.150> I<00:00:09.510> think<00:00:10.139> a<00:00:10.290> lot<00:00:10.440> of<00:00:10.469> time

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
wine is bad or not I think a lot of time

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.980 
wine is bad or not I think a lot of time
people<00:00:10.920> use<00:00:11.190> the<00:00:11.370> term<00:00:11.400> court<00:00:12.030> and<00:00:12.360> they're

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
people use the term court and they're

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.320 
people use the term court and they're
not<00:00:13.110> really<00:00:13.380> sure<00:00:13.559> they're<00:00:13.799> talking<00:00:14.190> about

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:14.330 
not really sure they're talking about

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.300 
not really sure they're talking about
this<00:00:15.330> is<00:00:15.509> sort<00:00:15.990> of<00:00:16.049> in<00:00:16.170> reference<00:00:16.590> to<00:00:16.890> ordering

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
this is sort of in reference to ordering

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.490 
this is sort of in reference to ordering
one<00:00:17.520> in<00:00:17.699> a<00:00:17.760> restaurant<00:00:18.090> because<00:00:18.420> a<00:00:18.840> wine<00:00:19.109> can

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
one in a restaurant because a wine can

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.250 
one in a restaurant because a wine can
be<00:00:19.529> not<00:00:19.980> what<00:00:20.220> you<00:00:20.400> expected<00:00:21.150> it<00:00:21.869> can<00:00:22.020> also<00:00:22.140> be

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
be not what you expected it can also be

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.140 
be not what you expected it can also be
something<00:00:22.769> that<00:00:22.920> you<00:00:23.039> didn't<00:00:23.340> like<00:00:23.580> but<00:00:24.000> that

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
something that you didn't like but that

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.820 
something that you didn't like but that
doesn't<00:00:24.480> necessarily<00:00:24.600> mean<00:00:25.080> that<00:00:25.230> it's<00:00:25.470> bad

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
doesn't necessarily mean that it's bad

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.759 
doesn't necessarily mean that it's bad
technically<00:00:26.760> it<00:00:27.449> could<00:00:27.630> still<00:00:27.900> you<00:00:28.199> know<00:00:28.289> it

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
technically it could still you know it

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.320 
technically it could still you know it
could<00:00:28.890> be<00:00:29.010> a<00:00:29.039> fine<00:00:29.340> wine<00:00:29.640> and<00:00:29.970> somebody<00:00:30.210> else

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
could be a fine wine and somebody else

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.939 
could be a fine wine and somebody else
could<00:00:30.599> like<00:00:30.779> it<00:00:31.019> it's<00:00:31.260> just<00:00:31.529> not<00:00:31.560> to<00:00:31.830> your

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
could like it it's just not to your

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.360 
could like it it's just not to your
taste<00:00:31.980> so<00:00:32.640> you<00:00:32.730> can't<00:00:33.059> really<00:00:33.360> blame<00:00:34.370> your

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
taste so you can't really blame your

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.630 
taste so you can't really blame your
lack<00:00:35.820> of<00:00:35.850> knowledge<00:00:36.210> or<00:00:36.750> your<00:00:37.710> not<00:00:38.070> knowing

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
lack of knowledge or your not knowing

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.060 
lack of knowledge or your not knowing
what<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.210> order<00:00:39.450> on<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.290> wine<00:00:40.500> being<00:00:40.829> bad

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
what to order on the wine being bad

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.420 
what to order on the wine being bad
times<00:00:41.969> when<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:42.270> wine<00:00:42.510> can<00:00:43.260> be<00:00:43.290> bad<00:00:43.649> include

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
times when a wine can be bad include

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.910 
times when a wine can be bad include
when<00:00:44.910> it's<00:00:45.030> court<00:00:45.480> now<00:00:45.930> what<00:00:46.079> that<00:00:46.110> means<00:00:46.500> is

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
when it's court now what that means is

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.220 
when it's court now what that means is
that<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:48.239> actual<00:00:48.870> cork<00:00:49.469> which<00:00:50.399> these<00:00:51.230> these

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
that the actual cork which these these

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.020 
that the actual cork which these these
quarks<00:00:52.739> that<00:00:52.980> are<00:00:53.070> not<00:00:53.190> synthetic<00:00:53.610> that<00:00:53.940> are

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
quarks that are not synthetic that are

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.110 
quarks that are not synthetic that are
actual<00:00:54.449> cork<00:00:54.840> come<00:00:55.620> from<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.280> particular<00:00:56.610> tree

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
actual cork come from a particular tree

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.799 
actual cork come from a particular tree
in<00:00:57.390> Portugal<00:00:57.989> in<00:00:58.140> which<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:59.539> bark<00:01:00.539> is

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
in Portugal in which the the bark is

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.930 
in Portugal in which the the bark is
stripped<00:01:01.170> off<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:01.859> then<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.219> trees<00:01:02.550> are<00:01:02.760> cut

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
stripped off and then the trees are cut

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.850 
stripped off and then the trees are cut
into<00:01:03.979> cut<00:01:04.979> into<00:01:05.220> slabs<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:06.560> sometimes<00:01:07.560> those

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
into cut into slabs and sometimes those

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.859 
into cut into slabs and sometimes those
you<00:01:08.340> know<00:01:08.460> pieces<00:01:08.790> of<00:01:08.909> wood<00:01:09.060> are<00:01:09.119> just<00:01:09.390> thrown

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
you know pieces of wood are just thrown

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.010 
you know pieces of wood are just thrown
onto<00:01:10.290> a<00:01:10.470> force<00:01:10.830> for<00:01:11.280> while<00:01:12.180> they<00:01:12.390> cut<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.780> rest

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
onto a force for while they cut the rest

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.899 
onto a force for while they cut the rest
of<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.320> trees<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:13.979> what<00:01:14.130> can<00:01:14.280> happen<00:01:14.430> is<00:01:14.729> that

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
of the trees and what can happen is that

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.690 
of the trees and what can happen is that
what<00:01:15.150> can<00:01:15.390> get<00:01:15.540> wet<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:16.200> it<00:01:16.860> can<00:01:17.040> develop<00:01:17.220> an

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
what can get wet and it can develop an

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.230 
what can get wet and it can develop an
invisible<00:01:18.240> mold<00:01:18.740> now<00:01:19.740> that<00:01:19.950> mold<00:01:20.280> you<00:01:21.000> can't

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
invisible mold now that mold you can't

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.070 
invisible mold now that mold you can't
see<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:21.810> so<00:01:22.200> when<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.650> quarks<00:01:23.070> are<00:01:23.549> cut<00:01:24.420> and

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
see and so when the quarks are cut and

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.830 
see and so when the quarks are cut and
sent<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:26.009> various<00:01:26.520> wineries<00:01:27.330> across<00:01:27.630> the

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
sent to various wineries across the

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.520 
sent to various wineries across the
world<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.470> put<00:01:29.400> into<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.939> bottles<00:01:30.090> if<00:01:30.689> that

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
world and put into the bottles if that

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.490 
world and put into the bottles if that
mold<00:01:31.829> is<00:01:32.040> present<00:01:32.640> then<00:01:33.210> as<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.780> wine<00:01:34.020> is

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
mold is present then as the wine is

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.980 
mold is present then as the wine is
stored<00:01:34.890> with<00:01:35.310> this<00:01:35.490> cork<00:01:35.939> that<00:01:36.299> mold<00:01:36.600> is<00:01:36.780> going

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
stored with this cork that mold is going

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.370 
stored with this cork that mold is going
to<00:01:37.049> actually<00:01:37.369> go<00:01:38.369> into<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.970> wine<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.600> it's<00:01:40.229> a

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
to actually go into the wine and it's a

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.440 
to actually go into the wine and it's a
sort<00:01:40.680> of<00:01:40.799> musty<00:01:42.350> just<00:01:43.350> off<00:01:43.560> flavor<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:44.670> you

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
sort of musty just off flavor and you

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.990 
sort of musty just off flavor and you
can<00:01:45.630> pretty<00:01:45.869> much<00:01:45.990> as<00:01:46.439> soon<00:01:47.280> as<00:01:47.430> you<00:01:47.549> smell<00:01:47.850> the

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
can pretty much as soon as you smell the

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.600 
can pretty much as soon as you smell the
wine<00:01:48.180> as<00:01:48.450> soon<00:01:48.600> as<00:01:48.720> it's<00:01:48.869> poured<00:01:49.259> it<00:01:49.610> smells

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
wine as soon as it's poured it smells

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.859 
wine as soon as it's poured it smells
like<00:01:51.259> extremely<00:01:52.259> like<00:01:52.729> over<00:01:53.729> exaggeration<00:01:54.509> of

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
like extremely like over exaggeration of

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.469 
like extremely like over exaggeration of
the<00:01:54.930> cork<00:01:55.320> itself<00:01:55.799> usually<00:01:56.189> you<00:01:56.520> can't<00:01:56.790> smell

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
the cork itself usually you can't smell

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.120 
the cork itself usually you can't smell
the<00:01:57.659> cork<00:01:57.930> which<00:01:58.140> is<00:01:58.320> why<00:01:58.439> you<00:01:58.500> don't<00:01:58.710> smell<00:01:59.070> it

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
the cork which is why you don't smell it

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.490 
the cork which is why you don't smell it
in<00:01:59.369> a<00:01:59.490> restaurant<00:01:59.659> but<00:02:00.659> if<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:01.049> wine<00:02:01.290> itself

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
in a restaurant but if the wine itself

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.179 
in a restaurant but if the wine itself
smells<00:02:02.189> sort<00:02:02.549> of<00:02:02.670> Corky<00:02:03.180> and<00:02:03.570> all<00:02:04.259> thin<00:02:05.009> it's

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
can be wrong with wine

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.210 
can be wrong with wine
as<00:02:11.220> if<00:02:11.430> it<00:02:11.610> does<00:02:11.850> get<00:02:12.390> air<00:02:12.810> into<00:02:13.440> it<00:02:13.770> somehow

the<00:03:02.490> wine<00:03:02.670> has<00:03:02.850> been<00:03:03.000> open<00:03:03.390> it'll<00:03:03.630> sort<00:03:03.870> of

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
the wine has been open it'll sort of

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.550 
the wine has been open it'll sort of
fade<00:03:05.310> out<00:03:05.550> and<00:03:05.850> the<00:03:06.570> wine<00:03:06.780> will<00:03:06.990> still<00:03:07.260> be<00:03:07.380> good

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
fade out and the wine will still be good

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.740 
fade out and the wine will still be good
so<00:03:07.950> if<00:03:08.100> you<00:03:08.220> do<00:03:08.370> open<00:03:08.700> a<00:03:08.790> bottle<00:03:09.090> of<00:03:09.180> wine<00:03:09.240> that

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
so if you do open a bottle of wine that

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.080 
so if you do open a bottle of wine that
you<00:03:10.200> think<00:03:10.620> might<00:03:10.860> not<00:03:11.070> be<00:03:11.220> quite<00:03:11.400> right<00:03:11.760> and

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
you think might not be quite right and

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.210 
you think might not be quite right and
you<00:03:12.900> don't<00:03:13.080> feel<00:03:13.260> like<00:03:13.500> trying<00:03:13.860> to<00:03:13.890> take<00:03:13.980> it

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
you don't feel like trying to take it

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.420 
you don't feel like trying to take it
back<00:03:14.430> or<00:03:15.230> it's<00:03:16.230> a<00:03:16.410> one<00:03:16.620> that<00:03:16.830> you've<00:03:16.920> had<00:03:17.100> for<00:03:17.160> a

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
long time come back to it don't just

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.830 
long time come back to it don't just
immediately<00:03:20.640> assume<00:03:21.060> that<00:03:21.270> it's<00:03:21.390> gone<00:03:21.570> bad

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
immediately assume that it's gone bad

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.150 
immediately assume that it's gone bad
and<00:03:22.290> pour<00:03:22.590> it<00:03:22.680> out<00:03:22.830> it<00:03:23.400> might<00:03:23.880> dissipate<00:03:24.540> so

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
and pour it out it might dissipate so

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.440 
and pour it out it might dissipate so
you<00:03:26.160> know<00:03:26.280> put<00:03:26.430> the<00:03:26.490> cork<00:03:26.700> back<00:03:26.730> in<00:03:26.910> it<00:03:27.209> maybe

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
you know put the cork back in it maybe

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.350 
you know put the cork back in it maybe
come<00:03:27.690> back<00:03:27.840> to<00:03:28.110> it<00:03:28.350> 12<00:03:28.830> hours<00:03:29.190> 24<00:03:29.880> hours<00:03:29.910> later
