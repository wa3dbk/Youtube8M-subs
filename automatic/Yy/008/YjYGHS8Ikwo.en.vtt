then once you've done both it should

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.200 
then once you've done both it should
look<00:01:36.040> like<00:01:36.100> this<00:01:36.250> then<00:01:38.580> take<00:01:39.580> some<00:01:39.760> red<00:01:39.970> clay

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210

tan colored paint and paint on Minnie

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.009 
tan colored paint and paint on Minnie
and<00:04:10.280> Mickey<00:04:10.400> face<00:04:10.819> it's<00:04:11.420> kind<00:04:11.510> of<00:04:11.780> hard<00:04:11.959> to

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:12.019 
and Mickey face it's kind of hard to

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:13.840 
and Mickey face it's kind of hard to
describe<00:04:12.260> the<00:04:12.590> shape<00:04:12.800> but<00:04:12.980> I<00:04:13.010> put<00:04:13.250> image<00:04:13.610> here

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:13.850 
describe the shape but I put image here

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:16.630 
describe the shape but I put image here
so<00:04:13.880> you<00:04:14.090> can<00:04:14.330> kind<00:04:14.630> of<00:04:14.810> see<00:04:15.110> it's<00:04:15.739> like<00:04:16.100> a<00:04:16.310> heart

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:16.640 
so you can kind of see it's like a heart

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.599 
so you can kind of see it's like a heart
I<00:04:16.940> guess<00:04:17.239> with<00:04:17.510> two<00:04:17.750> pieces<00:04:18.310> sticking<00:04:19.310> out<00:04:19.430> of

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609 
I guess with two pieces sticking out of

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:26.560 
I guess with two pieces sticking out of
the<00:04:19.729> side<00:04:19.970> if<00:04:20.329> that<00:04:20.510> makes<00:04:20.720> sense<00:04:23.919> and<00:04:25.570> then

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
the side if that makes sense and then

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:28.060 
the side if that makes sense and then
you<00:04:26.750> want<00:04:26.900> to<00:04:26.930> take<00:04:27.110> some<00:04:27.289> white<00:04:27.440> paint<00:04:27.680> and<00:04:27.919> do

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
you want to take some white paint and do

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:33.159 
you want to take some white paint and do
the<00:04:28.250> dots<00:04:28.460> on<00:04:28.760> Minnie's<00:04:29.240> bow<00:04:30.310> and<00:04:31.960> then<00:04:32.960> take

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:33.169 
the dots on Minnie's bow and then take

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:36.190 
the dots on Minnie's bow and then take
yellow<00:04:33.440> paint<00:04:33.650> and<00:04:33.800> do<00:04:33.979> the<00:04:34.130> two<00:04:34.570> over<00:04:35.570> as<00:04:35.780> you

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:36.200 
yellow paint and do the two over as you

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.620 
yellow paint and do the two over as you
can<00:04:36.350> see<00:04:36.500> I've<00:04:36.650> painted<00:04:36.919> on<00:04:37.280> the<00:04:37.630> features

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
can see I've painted on the features
