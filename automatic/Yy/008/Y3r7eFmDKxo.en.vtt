00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.690

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:06.239
 that they dokus again the twilight 

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:06.239

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:01.419
 embarrassing as I said with the heart for 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.190
 I'm right in the beginning 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:07.360

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:22.590

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.110
 if that's too long then he gets 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:35.820
 Do not do that anymore 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:38.730
 or something is running in the background 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:39.650
 no idea but otherwise I love 

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:41.880
 this calculator 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:43.830
 you have it a certain last couple 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:46.080
 to the notice that there were no bugs 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:48.780
 more so sound always grows very happy 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.920
 and cracked because my cpu totally 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:53.550
 was busy 

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:55.850
 now that does not happen 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:06:03.090

00:05:55.850 --> 00:06:04.740
 consejo de or muslim bhuiyan ankara 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:06.330
 I you never what I call 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:08.750
 probably the beak park 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.750
 as such 

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:23.330
 but no matter what i sometimes mistake for 

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:27.020
 or got caught in the game or something like that or 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:28.190
 in classic three games that bothers him 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:38.180
 really no longer the main thing I play 

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:40.100
 this game is something like this because I know 

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:41.510
 I try to quake the problem 

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:43.820
 finally to go on because on the 

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:46.180
 wiesn a bad end it coming 

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:50.060
 are maybe 20 30 more at the most 

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:51.470
 if it comes up maybe me 

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:53.510
 maybe underestimate this game 

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:55.070
 few technically sometimes but it is 

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:58.130
 not so much as you know you are 

00:06:55.070 --> 00:07:00.190
 have already made an assembly 

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:00.190
 begin 

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:24.710
 It starts again for this little one 

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:26.150
 section so I have title image 

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:27.290
 I made myself now 

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:29.300
 bit muffled 

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:31.760
 I just had to remember all this 

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:36.740
 that the bub of a microphone 

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:38.900
 has dropped off and I hope I am 

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:41.590
 generally a little bit quieter, it must 

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:44.540
 first turn down the microphone 

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:46.340
 but no matter if this partner is 

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:49.540
 fallen and we are the next 

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:49.540
