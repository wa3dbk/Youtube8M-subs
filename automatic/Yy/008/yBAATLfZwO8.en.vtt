00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
you see even from a distance it heats it

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.860

see it really just annihilates the wood
it's<00:02:21.500> absolutely<00:02:22.129> amazing<00:02:22.519> how<00:02:22.909> quick<00:02:23.209> this

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
it's absolutely amazing how quick this

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.880 
it's absolutely amazing how quick this
thing<00:02:23.599> burns<00:02:24.459> and<00:02:25.989> so<00:02:26.989> precise<00:02:27.439> and<00:02:27.650> you<00:02:27.739> do<00:02:27.860> a

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
thing burns and so precise and you do a

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.420 
thing burns and so precise and you do a
quick<00:02:28.220> to<00:02:28.430> you<00:02:28.549> can<00:02:28.670> draw<00:02:28.849> a<00:02:28.879> nice<00:02:29.060> quick<00:02:29.299> line

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
quick to you can draw a nice quick line

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.360 
quick to you can draw a nice quick line
it<00:02:31.430> sounds<00:02:31.760> almost<00:02:31.879> like<00:02:32.060> a<00:02:32.180> almost<00:02:33.250> like<00:02:34.250> a

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
it sounds almost like a almost like a

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.539 
it sounds almost like a almost like a
welding<00:02:34.849> an<00:02:35.720> arc<00:02:35.989> welder<00:02:36.349> in<00:02:36.470> a<00:02:36.560> bit<00:02:36.739> small<00:02:37.310> arc

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:37.549 
welding an arc welder in a bit small arc

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:39.490 
welding an arc welder in a bit small arc
welder<00:02:37.879> or<00:02:37.940> something<00:02:38.390> it's<00:02:39.319> pretty

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
welder or something it's pretty

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.610 
welder or something it's pretty
incredible<00:02:40.690> notice<00:02:41.690> I'm<00:02:41.840> not<00:02:41.900> trying<00:02:42.379> to<00:02:42.470> do

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
incredible notice I'm not trying to do

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.940 
incredible notice I'm not trying to do
anything<00:02:42.680> artistic<00:02:43.310> here<00:02:44.260> but<00:02:45.260> you<00:02:45.769> get<00:02:45.890> the

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
anything artistic here but you get the

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.330 
anything artistic here but you get the
idea<00:02:46.900> the<00:02:47.900> applications<00:02:48.530> for<00:02:48.680> this<00:02:48.799> are

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
idea the applications for this are

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:57.570 
idea the applications for this are
fantastic

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.460 

I<00:02:57.700> don't<00:02:58.270> know<00:02:58.360> from<00:02:58.540> the<00:02:58.630> first<00:02:58.660> person<00:02:59.050> to<00:02:59.260> do

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
I don't know from the first person to do

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:00.890 
I don't know from the first person to do
this<00:02:59.500> because<00:02:59.800> everyone<00:03:00.100> usually<00:03:00.280> burns

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
this because everyone usually burns

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.950 
this because everyone usually burns
metal<00:03:01.900> and<00:03:02.050> wood<00:03:02.320> I<00:03:02.560> mean<00:03:03.430> that<00:03:03.580> would

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:03.960 
metal and wood I mean that would

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.940 
metal and wood I mean that would
everyone<00:03:04.960> usually<00:03:05.200> burns<00:03:05.620> just<00:03:06.460> metal<00:03:07.950> but

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
everyone usually burns just metal but

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.410 
everyone usually burns just metal but
the<00:03:09.220> stuff<00:03:09.400> you<00:03:09.520> can<00:03:09.550> do<00:03:09.760> it<00:03:09.910> would<00:03:10.090> is<00:03:10.210> pretty

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
the stuff you can do it would is pretty

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:21.230 
the stuff you can do it would is pretty
incredible<00:03:10.540> too

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:21.240 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.630 

let's<00:03:21.840> try<00:03:21.960> to<00:03:22.080> draw<00:03:22.290> something<00:03:22.560> see<00:03:23.130> will

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
let's try to draw something see will

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.910 
let's try to draw something see will
draw<00:03:23.850> a<00:03:23.880> like<00:03:24.150> they<00:03:25.110> have<00:03:25.230> some<00:03:25.440> measurements

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
draw a like they have some measurements

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.390 
draw a like they have some measurements
here<00:03:26.070> let's<00:03:26.310> draw<00:03:26.460> some<00:03:26.640> circles<00:03:27.090> as<00:03:27.920> a<00:03:28.920> center

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
here let's draw some circles as a center

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:35.000 
here let's draw some circles as a center
of<00:03:29.430> my<00:03:29.550> circle<00:03:30.770> ready<00:03:33.050> it's<00:03:34.050> not<00:03:34.230> a<00:03:34.290> bad<00:03:34.530> circle

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
of my circle ready it's not a bad circle

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:42.210 
of my circle ready it's not a bad circle
there<00:03:35.750> so<00:03:36.750> concentric<00:03:37.440> rings

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.210 

see<00:03:42.880> how<00:03:42.970> quickly<00:03:43.300> it<00:03:43.570> burns<00:03:43.810> it<00:03:44.080> you<00:03:44.920> can<00:03:45.070> see

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
see how quickly it burns it you can see

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.280 
see how quickly it burns it you can see
where<00:03:45.370> i<00:03:45.430> tried<00:03:45.730> it<00:03:45.850> on<00:03:45.910> my<00:03:46.030> table<00:03:46.300> thinking

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
where i tried it on my table thinking

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.440 
where i tried it on my table thinking
that<00:03:47.440> it<00:03:47.560> would<00:03:47.620> be<00:03:47.850> it<00:03:48.850> wouldn't<00:03:49.150> take<00:03:49.300> us

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
that it would be it wouldn't take us

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:50.970 
that it would be it wouldn't take us
long<00:03:49.630> to<00:03:49.660> burn<00:03:49.960> it<00:03:50.140> for<00:03:50.290> some<00:03:50.500> stupid<00:03:50.830> reason

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
long to burn it for some stupid reason

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.680 
long to burn it for some stupid reason
now<00:03:51.580> my<00:03:51.760> table<00:03:52.150> is<00:03:52.210> permanently<00:03:52.630> ruined<00:03:54.690> look

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
now my table is permanently ruined look

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.780 
now my table is permanently ruined look
at<00:03:55.810> that<00:03:55.990> I<00:03:56.170> mean<00:03:56.350> you<00:03:56.740> you<00:03:57.040> can<00:03:57.250> get<00:03:57.520> quicker

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
at that I mean you you can get quicker

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.150 
at that I mean you you can get quicker
results<00:03:58.030> out<00:03:58.510> of<00:03:58.930> a<00:03:59.110> carbon<00:03:59.350> dioxide<00:03:59.950> laser

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
results out of a carbon dioxide laser

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.100 
results out of a carbon dioxide laser
then<00:04:00.940> you<00:04:01.060> do<00:04:01.180> out<00:04:01.360> of<00:04:01.450> this<00:04:01.540> stupid<00:04:01.810> little

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.110 
then you do out of this stupid little

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:08.370 
then you do out of this stupid little
torch<00:04:03.690> hho<00:04:04.690> torch<00:04:05.020> by<00:04:05.530> the<00:04:05.560> way<00:04:05.770> I<00:04:07.290> mean<00:04:08.290> you

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380 
torch hho torch by the way I mean you

torch hho torch by the way I mean you
can<00:04:08.560> write<00:04:08.710> letters<00:04:08.950> there's<00:04:09.910> a<00:04:10.060> nice<00:04:10.240> little

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
can write letters there's a nice little

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:15.810 
can write letters there's a nice little
I<00:04:11.130> i<00:04:12.130> don't<00:04:12.400> know<00:04:12.550> let's<00:04:12.670> do<00:04:12.850> an<00:04:12.940> a<00:04:14.520> I'm<00:04:15.520> sure

really put the time into drawing with

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.530 
really put the time into drawing with
this<00:04:31.510> thing<00:04:32.640> you<00:04:33.640> may<00:04:33.850> really<00:04:34.210> have<00:04:34.510> something
