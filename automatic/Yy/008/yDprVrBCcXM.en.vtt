00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.670

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.480
 stone that you want and I know 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.670
 would bring to the channel and good our dear 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:26.340
 friend and subscriber sterbik guzmán has 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.520
 asked that this time 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.619
 Chari x seek the pig so 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:36.829
 guys the first thing we have to do 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:39.079
 is to go flying up 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:42.350
 up india path good guys like 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:44.929
 you know in this in this pokemon remake 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.969
 mega blond and alpha sapphire we have the 

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:49.339
 easy and the ease of flying towards 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:52.729
 anywhere no matter now no 

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:55.070
 matter that it's just a city or town like that 

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:57.670
 that we are going to fly directly to the 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.670
 ine path 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:04.089
 and we 're going to get rid of a good walk 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.640
 walking 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:10.500
 so guys the only requirement for 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:14.960
 this mega stone is that it has to carry 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:18.700
 in his team a pokémon with strength 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.700
 so nothing guys we are going to enter 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.580
 and good what we have to do is 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.580
 direct us up 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:32.530
 here on the left 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.720
 and then up 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:38.470
 and as you see here you will find a stone 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:40.680
 to use effort and then we are going to 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.680
 do 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:51.210
 we use force 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.210
 and now we only move the stone 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:02:00.410
 then we make it fall into the hole 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.770
 and then we go up 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.770
 Boys 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.720
 and we will have to move 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:11.860
 this stone too 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.860
 so we move it 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:19.360
 and I recommend you bring a repellent because 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.730
 it's a bit annoying that they appear 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:25.520
 many pokemon every time and we 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.290
 hinder the good work here there is no longer 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.130
 We can leave it there 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.130
 we can come here 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.020
 to the bottom 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.030
 and below 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:48.270
 and good here we will find 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:51.480
 an item stone fire that will serve us 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:53.750
 to evolve to our pocket and 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.670
 good as you see here on your right side 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:03:01.120
 is there shining guys then only 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:05.740

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:08.400
