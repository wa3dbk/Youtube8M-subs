00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
times each and that's something i think

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.459

replayability in games and the

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.340 
replayability in games and the
challenges<00:00:56.969> around<00:00:57.300> that<00:00:57.660> now<00:00:58.199> I've

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
again sometimes that's because I really

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.499 
again sometimes that's because I really
enjoy<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.979> game<00:01:23.189> other<00:01:23.430> times<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:24.119> most

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.450 
enjoy the game other times and most
frequently<00:01:24.990> it's<00:01:25.170> because<00:01:25.560> they're<00:01:26.100> lighter

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
frequently it's because they're lighter

arrive when I'm thinking about

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.740 
arrive when I'm thinking about
replayability<00:01:41.220> here<00:01:41.640> I<00:01:41.670> think<00:01:41.970> I'd<00:01:42.509> like<00:01:42.689> to

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
replayability here I think I'd like to

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.510 
replayability here I think I'd like to
pick<00:01:43.049> games<00:01:43.350> that<00:01:43.680> go<00:01:43.799> beyond<00:01:44.070> that<00:01:44.100> games

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
pick games that go beyond that games

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.620 
pick games that go beyond that games
that<00:01:44.700> have<00:01:44.850> some<00:01:45.060> real<00:01:45.180> meat<00:01:45.329> on<00:01:45.479> their<00:01:45.600> bones

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
that have some real meat on their bones

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.899 
that have some real meat on their bones
that<00:01:46.170> maybe<00:01:46.380> take<00:01:46.649> a<00:01:46.890> good<00:01:47.280> chunk<00:01:47.460> of<00:01:47.549> time<00:01:47.610> to

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
that maybe take a good chunk of time to

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.630 
that maybe take a good chunk of time to
play<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.180> I<00:01:48.990> think<00:01:49.200> I<00:01:49.259> we<00:01:49.409> enjoy<00:01:49.770> sort<00:01:50.579> of

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
play and I think I we enjoy sort of

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.929 
play and I think I we enjoy sort of
honing<00:01:51.149> my<00:01:51.360> I<00:01:51.740> guess<00:01:52.740> my<00:01:53.009> strategies<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:53.880> my

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
honing my I guess my strategies and my

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.060 
honing my I guess my strategies and my
play<00:01:54.180> style<00:01:54.450> in<00:01:54.750> those<00:01:55.110> specific<00:01:55.320> games<00:01:55.890> but

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
play style in those specific games but

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.670 
play style in those specific games but
beyond<00:01:56.340> that<00:01:56.490> I<00:01:56.759> think<00:01:57.060> I'd<00:01:57.210> like<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.420> try<00:01:57.719> you

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
to find other people who also want to

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.800 
to find other people who also want to
play<00:02:28.860> these<00:02:29.010> games<00:02:29.280> now<00:02:30.270> if<00:02:30.360> you<00:02:30.450> have<00:02:30.540> a<00:02:30.570> large

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
play these games now if you have a large

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.270 
play these games now if you have a large
gaming<00:02:31.230> group<00:02:31.350> that's<00:02:31.560> not<00:02:31.800> such<00:02:32.010> a<00:02:32.100> big<00:02:32.220> deal

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
gaming group that's not such a big deal

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.340 
gaming group that's not such a big deal
because<00:02:32.520> you<00:02:32.730> can<00:02:32.880> split<00:02:33.390> that<00:02:33.480> up<00:02:33.660> amongst

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
because you can split that up amongst

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.080 
because you can split that up amongst
various<00:02:34.410> people<00:02:35.070> but<00:02:35.220> if<00:02:35.340> you're<00:02:35.460> like<00:02:35.610> me<00:02:35.850> i

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
various people but if you're like me i

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.760 
various people but if you're like me i
think<00:02:36.450> most<00:02:36.750> people<00:02:36.960> probably<00:02:37.170> are<00:02:37.560> you<00:02:37.680> have

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
think most people probably are you have

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.220 
think most people probably are you have
a<00:02:37.830> smaller<00:02:38.100> gaming<00:02:38.460> group<00:02:38.610> so<00:02:39.330> i<00:02:39.660> think<00:02:39.810> i'm

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
a smaller gaming group so i think i'm

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.930 
a smaller gaming group so i think i'm
going<00:02:40.470> to<00:02:40.560> have<00:02:40.740> to<00:02:40.770> consider<00:02:41.190> going<00:02:41.430> to<00:02:41.760> my

replayable for me and I am drawn to

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.100

infuse into the game myself or that the
game<00:03:09.150> offers<00:03:09.450> so<00:03:09.840> you<00:03:09.900> think<00:03:10.140> of<00:03:10.230> a<00:03:10.290> game<00:03:10.500> like

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
game offers so you think of a game like

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.500 
game offers so you think of a game like
elder<00:03:11.100> tour<00:03:11.370> or<00:03:11.670> dead<00:03:11.940> of<00:03:12.060> winter<00:03:12.209> these

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
elder tour or dead of winter these

usually have event cards crossroad cards

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.630 
usually have event cards crossroad cards

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
things that you draw that have a story

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.220 
things that you draw that have a story
element<00:03:18.060> your<00:03:18.180> read<00:03:18.360> out<00:03:18.510> loud<00:03:18.540> and<00:03:18.989> these<00:03:19.110> are

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
element your read out loud and these are

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.259 
element your read out loud and these are
going<00:03:19.350> to<00:03:19.440> come<00:03:20.100> from<00:03:20.280> a<00:03:20.340> large<00:03:20.519> deck<00:03:20.880> so<00:03:21.120> that

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
going to come from a large deck so that

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.870 
going to come from a large deck so that
every<00:03:21.690> time<00:03:21.840> you<00:03:21.900> play<00:03:22.230> odds<00:03:23.220> are<00:03:23.519> good<00:03:23.700> you're

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
every time you play odds are good you're

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.640 
every time you play odds are good you're
going<00:03:24.000> to<00:03:24.060> be<00:03:24.150> seeing<00:03:24.390> new<00:03:24.690> things<00:03:24.720> each<00:03:25.260> time

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
going to be seeing new things each time

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.540 
going to be seeing new things each time
and<00:03:25.860> I<00:03:25.890> think<00:03:26.100> that<00:03:26.340> almost<00:03:27.030> offers<00:03:27.600> that<00:03:28.550> same

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
and I think that almost offers that same

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.550 
and I think that almost offers that same
sense<00:03:29.820> of<00:03:30.000> discovery<00:03:30.810> that<00:03:31.110> you<00:03:31.200> have<00:03:31.380> when

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
sense of discovery that you have when

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.540 
sense of discovery that you have when
you<00:03:31.620> sit<00:03:31.800> down<00:03:31.830> and<00:03:32.010> play<00:03:32.130> a<00:03:32.160> game<00:03:32.340> for<00:03:32.370> the

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 
you sit down and play a game for the

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:34.280 
you sit down and play a game for the
first<00:03:32.670> time<00:03:32.970> it<00:03:33.150> helps<00:03:33.390> keep<00:03:33.450> that<00:03:33.870> fresh

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
first time it helps keep that fresh

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.500 
first time it helps keep that fresh
because<00:03:34.830> oftentimes<00:03:35.700> when<00:03:36.060> I<00:03:36.090> play<00:03:36.300> those

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
because oftentimes when I play those

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.360 
because oftentimes when I play those
games<00:03:36.540> I'm<00:03:37.350> still<00:03:37.650> seeing<00:03:37.830> things<00:03:38.130> for<00:03:38.250> the

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
games I'm still seeing things for the

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.790 
games I'm still seeing things for the
first<00:03:38.610> time<00:03:38.880> and<00:03:39.390> I<00:03:39.780> like<00:03:40.019> that<00:03:40.230> in<00:03:40.350> game<00:03:40.560> so<00:03:40.769> I

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
first time and I like that in game so I

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.440 
first time and I like that in game so I
imagine<00:03:41.160> that<00:03:41.760> at<00:03:41.850> least<00:03:41.970> a<00:03:42.060> couple<00:03:42.180> of<00:03:42.330> my

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
imagine that at least a couple of my

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.680 
imagine that at least a couple of my
selections<00:03:43.049> will<00:03:43.200> be<00:03:43.320> games<00:03:43.590> that<00:03:43.799> have<00:03:43.980> that

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
selections will be games that have that

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.410 
selections will be games that have that
scenario<00:03:45.690> based<00:03:46.110> play<00:03:46.610> event<00:03:47.610> decks<00:03:48.000> things

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
scenario based play event decks things

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.150 
scenario based play event decks things
that<00:03:48.570> have<00:03:48.690> narrative<00:03:49.200> story<00:03:49.470> elements<00:03:49.950> that

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
that have narrative story elements that

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.430 
that have narrative story elements that
change<00:03:50.580> each<00:03:50.880> time<00:03:51.180> that<00:03:51.360> you<00:03:51.480> play<00:03:51.720> then<00:03:52.320> I

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
change each time that you play then I

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.050 
change each time that you play then I
got<00:03:52.620> thinking<00:03:52.860> about<00:03:53.160> other<00:03:53.370> games<00:03:53.730> that<00:03:53.880> I've

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
got thinking about other games that I've

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.140 
got thinking about other games that I've
played<00:03:54.420> repeatedly<00:03:54.750> like<00:03:55.549> summoner<00:03:56.549> wars<00:03:56.820> and

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
played repeatedly like summoner wars and

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.270 
played repeatedly like summoner wars and
star<00:03:57.450> realms<00:03:57.660> I've<00:03:58.200> logged<00:03:58.470> hundreds<00:03:59.100> of

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
star realms I've logged hundreds of

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.890 
star realms I've logged hundreds of
plays<00:03:59.610> in<00:03:59.850> these<00:03:59.970> games<00:04:00.180> both<00:04:00.570> in<00:04:00.810> the

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
plays in these games both in the

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.530 
plays in these games both in the
physical<00:04:01.320> and<00:04:01.530> app<00:04:02.220> version<00:04:02.640> but<00:04:03.030> it<00:04:03.180> wasn't

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
physical and app version but it wasn't

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.690 
physical and app version but it wasn't
it<00:04:03.750> wasn't<00:04:04.500> a<00:04:04.650> story<00:04:04.920> element<00:04:05.310> really<00:04:05.519> that

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
it wasn't a story element really that

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.340 
it wasn't a story element really that
was<00:04:05.820> driving<00:04:06.060> me<00:04:06.269> back<00:04:06.510> to<00:04:06.540> those<00:04:06.750> games<00:04:07.080> I

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
was driving me back to those games I

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:12.650 
was driving me back to those games I
think<00:04:08.280> they<00:04:08.549> offer<00:04:08.850> something<00:04:09.769> similar<00:04:10.769> to<00:04:11.660> my

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
think they offer something similar to my

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.550 
think they offer something similar to my
chess<00:04:13.019> where<00:04:13.730> the<00:04:14.730> reason<00:04:15.150> to<00:04:15.239> play<00:04:15.390> is<00:04:15.720> to<00:04:15.989> get

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
chess where the reason to play is to get

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.219 
chess where the reason to play is to get
better<00:04:17.390> discover<00:04:18.390> new<00:04:18.600> tactics<00:04:19.049> new

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
better discover new tactics new

better discover new tactics new

of mastering the gameplay you can try

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
learn new ways of playing so I think

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.830 
learn new ways of playing so I think
probably<00:04:44.460> a<00:04:44.669> couple<00:04:44.820> my<00:04:45.000> choices<00:04:45.270> will<00:04:45.660> be

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
probably a couple my choices will be

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.900 
probably a couple my choices will be
something<00:04:46.259> in<00:04:46.440> the<00:04:46.500> living<00:04:46.800> card<00:04:47.190> game<00:04:47.400> format

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
something in the living card game format

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.840 
something in the living card game format
as<00:04:48.120> well<00:04:48.360> because<00:04:48.840> this<00:04:49.680> will<00:04:49.889> offer<00:04:50.160> the<00:04:50.610> the

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
as well because this will offer the the

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:52.969 
as well because this will offer the the
benefits<00:04:51.240> of<00:04:51.330> repeated<00:04:52.169> play<00:04:52.350> and<00:04:52.740> getting

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:52.979 
benefits of repeated play and getting

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:55.219 
benefits of repeated play and getting
better<00:04:53.160> at<00:04:53.310> a<00:04:53.370> game<00:04:53.550> but<00:04:53.729> also<00:04:53.910> an<00:04:54.419> expanding

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:55.229 
better at a game but also an expanding

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:57.469 
better at a game but also an expanding
carpool<00:04:55.740> so<00:04:56.370> there's<00:04:56.550> always<00:04:56.699> something<00:04:57.210> new

00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:57.479 
carpool so there's always something new

00:04:57.479 --> 00:04:59.029 
carpool so there's always something new
and<00:04:57.750> different<00:04:57.780> to<00:04:58.080> try<00:04:58.289> out<00:04:58.440> within<00:04:58.830> that

00:04:59.029 --> 00:04:59.039 
and different to try out within that

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:01.700 
and different to try out within that
same<00:04:59.370> set<00:04:59.880> of<00:04:59.910> rules<00:05:00.000> I<00:05:00.509> think<00:05:00.990> solo<00:05:01.320> games<00:05:01.560> are

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
same set of rules I think solo games are

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:03.080 
same set of rules I think solo games are
something<00:05:02.009> else<00:05:02.099> I'll<00:05:02.340> take<00:05:02.490> a<00:05:02.520> look<00:05:02.789> at<00:05:02.940> as

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
something else I'll take a look at as

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.540 
something else I'll take a look at as
well<00:05:03.330> because<00:05:03.919> well<00:05:04.919> it's<00:05:05.070> a<00:05:05.130> little<00:05:05.370> easier

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
well because well it's a little easier

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.089 
well because well it's a little easier
to<00:05:05.820> set<00:05:06.120> aside<00:05:06.210> time<00:05:06.599> to<00:05:06.660> play<00:05:07.110> games<00:05:07.139> if<00:05:07.830> it's

00:05:08.089 --> 00:05:08.099 
to set aside time to play games if it's

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:09.920 
to set aside time to play games if it's
totally<00:05:08.520> on<00:05:08.639> your<00:05:08.820> schedule<00:05:09.060> and<00:05:09.479> you're<00:05:09.810> not

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 
totally on your schedule and you're not

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.110 
totally on your schedule and you're not
requiring<00:05:10.380> somebody<00:05:10.800> else<00:05:10.979> to<00:05:11.190> make<00:05:11.310> the<00:05:11.910> same

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
requiring somebody else to make the same

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.210 
requiring somebody else to make the same
commitment<00:05:12.509> to<00:05:12.720> the<00:05:12.810> game<00:05:12.840> but<00:05:13.770> I<00:05:13.830> think<00:05:14.099> there

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 
commitment to the game but I think there

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.659 
commitment to the game but I think there
is<00:05:14.310> kind<00:05:14.520> of<00:05:14.699> a<00:05:14.880> general<00:05:15.630> question<00:05:15.780> about<00:05:16.669> what

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:17.669 
is kind of a general question about what

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:19.760 
is kind of a general question about what
kind<00:05:17.940> of<00:05:18.000> replayability<00:05:18.449> we<00:05:18.930> expect<00:05:19.440> from<00:05:19.650> a

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
kind of replayability we expect from a

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:22.490 
kind of replayability we expect from a
game<00:05:19.979> like<00:05:20.820> would<00:05:21.030> you<00:05:21.270> think<00:05:21.539> a<00:05:21.780> game<00:05:22.139> was<00:05:22.470> a

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
game like would you think a game was a

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.129 
game like would you think a game was a
waste<00:05:22.860> of<00:05:23.070> space<00:05:23.639> on<00:05:23.820> your<00:05:23.880> shelf<00:05:24.270> if<00:05:24.509> you<00:05:24.960> only

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:25.139 
waste of space on your shelf if you only

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:27.469 
waste of space on your shelf if you only
played<00:05:25.470> it<00:05:25.590> once<00:05:25.710> in<00:05:25.919> a<00:05:26.009> year<00:05:26.210> like<00:05:27.210> how<00:05:27.419> many

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:27.479 
played it once in a year like how many

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:30.200 
played it once in a year like how many
times<00:05:28.020> do<00:05:28.710> you<00:05:28.770> feel<00:05:29.190> you<00:05:29.430> need<00:05:29.669> to<00:05:29.820> play<00:05:30.180> a

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
times do you feel you need to play a

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.320 
times do you feel you need to play a
game<00:05:30.660> to<00:05:30.900> feel<00:05:31.139> like<00:05:31.320> it<00:05:31.470> has<00:05:31.560> really<00:05:31.889> i<00:05:32.330> don't

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:33.330 
game to feel like it has really i don't

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.600 
game to feel like it has really i don't
know<00:05:33.389> rewarded<00:05:34.080> you<00:05:34.260> for<00:05:34.650> the<00:05:34.830> money<00:05:35.070> that<00:05:35.430> you

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:35.610 
know rewarded you for the money that you

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:37.730

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740 
spent to get that game in the first

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.520 
spent to get that game in the first
place<00:05:38.039> so<00:05:38.400> i<00:05:38.729> want<00:05:39.090> us<00:05:39.180> to<00:05:39.300> think<00:05:39.570> what<00:05:40.020> is<00:05:40.320> it

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:40.530 
place so i want us to think what is it

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:42.649 
place so i want us to think what is it
about<00:05:40.650> games<00:05:41.159> that<00:05:41.460> makes<00:05:41.699> us<00:05:41.909> want<00:05:42.300> to<00:05:42.389> play

00:05:42.649 --> 00:05:42.659 
about games that makes us want to play

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:44.060 
about games that makes us want to play
them<00:05:42.870> over<00:05:43.139> and<00:05:43.229> over<00:05:43.320> again<00:05:43.530> thank<00:05:43.830> you<00:05:43.919> about

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:44.070 
them over and over again thank you about

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:45.500 
them over and over again thank you about
games<00:05:44.340> in<00:05:44.520> your<00:05:44.639> collection<00:05:44.849> you've<00:05:45.240> played

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:45.510 
games in your collection you've played

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:48.529 
games in your collection you've played
several<00:05:46.229> times<00:05:46.680> what<00:05:47.580> made<00:05:47.760> you<00:05:47.909> do<00:05:48.060> that<00:05:48.090> and

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:48.539 
several times what made you do that and

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:51.020 
several times what made you do that and
I<00:05:49.349> think<00:05:49.590> the<00:05:49.680> easy<00:05:49.830> answer<00:05:50.130> would<00:05:50.370> be<00:05:50.400> well

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:51.030 
I think the easy answer would be well

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:53.029 
I think the easy answer would be well
because<00:05:51.240> the<00:05:51.510> game<00:05:51.690> was<00:05:51.720> fun<00:05:52.110> but<00:05:52.680> let's<00:05:52.889> try

00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:53.039 
because the game was fun but let's try

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:55.250 
because the game was fun but let's try
to<00:05:53.130> avoid<00:05:53.460> that<00:05:53.520> answer<00:05:54.090> let's<00:05:54.479> instead<00:05:54.840> think

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:55.260 
to avoid that answer let's instead think

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.040 
to avoid that answer let's instead think
beyond<00:05:55.889> that<00:05:56.099> into<00:05:56.490> well<00:05:56.820> okay<00:05:57.060> specifically

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.050 
beyond that into well okay specifically

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:01.129 
beyond that into well okay specifically
what<00:05:58.740> made<00:05:59.159> that<00:05:59.190> activity<00:05:59.970> fund<00:06:00.479> for<00:06:00.900> me<00:06:01.110> I'd

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:01.139 
what made that activity fund for me I'd
