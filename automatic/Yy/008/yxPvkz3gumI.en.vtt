okay<00:00:02.669> here's<00:00:02.879> a<00:00:02.939> tutorial<00:00:03.300> on<00:00:03.540> how<00:00:03.629> to<00:00:03.810> make

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
okay here's a tutorial on how to make

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.369 
okay here's a tutorial on how to make
red<00:00:04.290> iron<00:00:04.799> oxide<00:00:05.390> I'm<00:00:06.390> not<00:00:06.629> making<00:00:06.930> thermite

red iron oxide I'm not making thermite

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.379 
red iron oxide I'm not making thermite
or<00:00:07.859> anything<00:00:08.189> like<00:00:08.370> this<00:00:08.580> I'm<00:00:08.849> working<00:00:09.150> on<00:00:09.240> an

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
or anything like this I'm working on an

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.169 
or anything like this I'm working on an
old<00:00:09.510> Edison<00:00:10.139> iron<00:00:10.380> nickel<00:00:10.860> battery<00:00:11.309> so<00:00:12.059> I'm

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
old Edison iron nickel battery so I'm

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.700 
old Edison iron nickel battery so I'm
making<00:00:12.450> my<00:00:12.540> own<00:00:12.599> chemical<00:00:13.080> stuff<00:00:13.290> so<00:00:13.469> I'm<00:00:13.530> one

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
making my own chemical stuff so I'm one

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.580 
making my own chemical stuff so I'm one
pretty<00:00:14.660> fairly<00:00:15.660> pure<00:00:15.929> and<00:00:16.350> they're<00:00:16.470> not

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
pretty fairly pure and they're not

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.760 
pretty fairly pure and they're not
perfect<00:00:17.039> but<00:00:17.250> anyway<00:00:17.910> start<00:00:18.750> out<00:00:18.869> with<00:00:19.020> we've

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
perfect but anyway start out with we've

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.010 
perfect but anyway start out with we've
got<00:00:19.800> a<00:00:20.010> little<00:00:20.340> bit<00:00:20.430> of<00:00:20.490> salt<00:00:20.699> water<00:00:20.990> about<00:00:21.990> a

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
got a little bit of salt water about a

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.040 
got a little bit of salt water about a
gallon<00:00:22.289> half<00:00:22.740> and<00:00:23.039> to<00:00:23.210> one<00:00:24.210> quarter<00:00:24.480> by<00:00:25.019> inch

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
gallon half and to one quarter by inch

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.429 
gallon half and to one quarter by inch
and<00:00:25.320> a<00:00:25.439> half<00:00:25.470> by<00:00:25.949> ten<00:00:26.220> inch<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:26.670> iron<00:00:26.760> rods<00:00:27.439> in

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
and a half by ten inch and iron rods in

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.560 
and a half by ten inch and iron rods in
the<00:00:28.769> solution<00:00:29.250> here<00:00:29.460> with<00:00:29.640> a<00:00:29.670> with<00:00:30.269> a<00:00:30.300> green

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
the solution here with a with a green

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.040 
the solution here with a with a green
and<00:00:30.810> with<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.260> black<00:00:31.529> and<00:00:31.830> red<00:00:32.009> slime<00:00:32.520> on<00:00:32.550> top

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.050 
and with the black and red slime on top

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.959 
and with the black and red slime on top
we<00:00:34.050> got<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.230> 40<00:00:34.620> amp<00:00:34.770> power<00:00:34.950> supply<00:00:35.219> which<00:00:35.940> is

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
we got a 40 amp power supply which is

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.740 
we got a 40 amp power supply which is
way<00:00:36.870> too<00:00:36.930> big<00:00:37.320> but<00:00:38.160> it<00:00:38.280> serves<00:00:39.030> a<00:00:39.149> purpose

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
way too big but it serves a purpose

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.780 
way too big but it serves a purpose
so<00:00:40.469> after<00:00:40.649> this<00:00:40.800> runs<00:00:41.040> for<00:00:41.250> about<00:00:41.309> fifteen

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
so after this runs for about fifteen

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.229 
so after this runs for about fifteen
hours<00:00:42.120> you'll<00:00:42.329> get<00:00:42.480> several<00:00:42.899> ounces<00:00:43.260> of<00:00:43.379> iron

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
hours you'll get several ounces of iron

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:48.860 
hours you'll get several ounces of iron
Fe<00:00:45.239> 2<00:00:45.989> O<00:00:46.020> 3<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.710> iron<00:00:47.250> hydroxide<00:00:48.000> because<00:00:48.480> it

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
Fe 2 O 3 and iron hydroxide because it

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.479 
Fe 2 O 3 and iron hydroxide because it
after<00:00:49.140> a<00:00:49.170> period<00:00:49.379> of<00:00:49.530> time<00:00:49.590> it<00:00:49.890> converts<00:00:50.219> to

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
after a period of time it converts to

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.540 
after a period of time it converts to
assault<00:00:50.850> into<00:00:51.410> sodium<00:00:52.410> hydroxide<00:00:53.100> instead<00:00:53.430> of

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
assault into sodium hydroxide instead of

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.360 
assault into sodium hydroxide instead of
sodium<00:00:53.850> chloride<00:00:54.800> process<00:00:55.800> slows<00:00:56.070> up<00:00:56.280> a

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
sodium chloride process slows up a

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.090 
sodium chloride process slows up a
little<00:00:56.610> bit<00:00:56.960> but<00:00:57.960> that's<00:00:58.079> normal<00:00:58.500> so<00:00:58.770> a<00:00:58.949> sodium

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
little bit but that's normal so a sodium

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.290 
little bit but that's normal so a sodium
hydroxide<00:01:02.100> could<00:01:02.340> be<00:01:02.489> used<00:01:02.730> it's<00:01:03.000> awful

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
hydroxide could be used it's awful

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.240 
hydroxide could be used it's awful
dangerous<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:04.379> small<00:01:04.619> amount<00:01:04.920> in<00:01:05.070> here

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
dangerous and the small amount in here

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.649 
dangerous and the small amount in here
would<00:01:05.519> really<00:01:05.700> make<00:01:05.820> a<00:01:05.880> big<00:01:06.090> difference<00:01:06.270> it

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
would really make a big difference it

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.660 
would really make a big difference it

starts out dissolving the arm the iron

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.330 
starts out dissolving the arm the iron

bar faster with the sodium chloride than
it<00:01:11.460> does<00:01:11.640> with<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.060> sodium<00:01:12.360> hydroxide<00:01:12.510> I<00:01:13.260> try

it does with the sodium hydroxide I try

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.620 
it does with the sodium hydroxide I try
and<00:01:13.979> sodium<00:01:14.280> carbonate<00:01:14.760> which<00:01:15.030> is<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.240> standard

lab<00:01:15.840> method<00:01:16.320> for<00:01:16.560> making<00:01:17.689> iron<00:01:18.689> oxide<00:01:19.170> in<00:01:19.290> the

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
lab method for making iron oxide in the

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.749 
lab method for making iron oxide in the
lab<00:01:19.500> but<00:01:19.710> it's<00:01:19.830> very<00:01:20.040> slow<00:01:20.280> I've<00:01:20.400> run<00:01:20.580> it<00:01:20.670> for

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
lab but it's very slow I've run it for

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.039 
lab but it's very slow I've run it for
two<00:01:20.790> days<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.240> probably<00:01:21.509> didn't<00:01:21.689> get<00:01:21.780> 10

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
two days and probably didn't get 10

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.010 
two days and probably didn't get 10
grams<00:01:22.320> but<00:01:23.130> anyway<00:01:23.460> once<00:01:23.759> it's<00:01:23.970> run<00:01:24.810> for

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
grams but anyway once it's run for

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.690 
grams but anyway once it's run for
several<00:01:25.200> hours<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.740> container<00:01:26.070> get<00:01:26.340> hot<00:01:26.520> the

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
several hours the container get hot the

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.370 
several hours the container get hot the
water<00:01:26.880> almost<00:01:27.119> boil<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.689> up<00:01:27.750> here<00:01:27.930> about<00:01:28.140> six

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
water almost boil and up here about six

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.289 
water almost boil and up here about six
hours<00:01:28.530> turn<00:01:28.829> it<00:01:28.920> off<00:01:29.040> let<00:01:29.220> it<00:01:29.340> cool<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:30.000> then

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
hours turn it off let it cool and then

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.840 
hours turn it off let it cool and then
start<00:01:30.509> back<00:01:30.689> up<00:01:30.720> again<00:01:31.460> alright<00:01:32.460> here's<00:01:32.790> what

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
start back up again alright here's what

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.990 
start back up again alright here's what
you<00:01:33.090> get<00:01:33.270> you<00:01:33.479> get<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:33.630> black<00:01:34.610> you<00:01:35.610> get<00:01:35.670> a<00:01:35.759> black

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
you get you get a black you get a black

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.330 
you get you get a black you get a black
mass<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:36.570> that's<00:01:37.079> what<00:01:37.320> you<00:01:37.439> do<00:01:37.590> is<00:01:37.770> let<00:01:38.159> it

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
mass and that's what you do is let it

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.090 
mass and that's what you do is let it
drain<00:01:38.759> out<00:01:38.939> until<00:01:39.299> it's<00:01:39.479> very<00:01:39.689> like<00:01:40.619> chocolate

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
drain out until it's very like chocolate

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.139 
drain out until it's very like chocolate
pudding<00:01:41.400> and<00:01:41.600> then<00:01:43.490> break<00:01:44.490> it<00:01:44.610> out<00:01:44.700> in<00:01:44.850> a<00:01:44.939> dish

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
pudding and then break it out in a dish

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.670 
pudding and then break it out in a dish
and<00:01:45.420> put<00:01:45.570> it<00:01:45.659> in<00:01:45.750> a<00:01:45.810> toaster<00:01:46.020> over<00:01:46.200> about<00:01:46.500> 200

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
and put it in a toaster over about 200

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.889 
and put it in a toaster over about 200
degrees<00:01:47.009> and<00:01:47.520> let<00:01:47.640> it<00:01:47.729> dry<00:01:47.970> for<00:01:48.540> a<00:01:48.630> couple

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
degrees and let it dry for a couple

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.920 
degrees and let it dry for a couple
hours<00:01:48.990> at<00:01:49.950> 382<00:01:50.670> degrees<00:01:51.060> Fahrenheit<00:01:51.570> iron

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
hours at 382 degrees Fahrenheit iron

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.749 
hours at 382 degrees Fahrenheit iron
hydroxide<00:01:52.560> turns<00:01:52.860> into<00:01:53.040> red<00:01:53.280> iron<00:01:53.579> oxide

technology to see if this is going to

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.310 
technology to see if this is going to
work<00:03:53.760> but<00:03:54.760> anyway<00:03:55.180> that's<00:03:55.660> the<00:03:55.870> lesson<00:03:56.079> from

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
right now and I'll run another video
