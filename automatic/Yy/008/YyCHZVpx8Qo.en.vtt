00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.340
 at the price of children and without something 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.410
 I promised you from that last line you want 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.209
 make a very easy craft is this 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.550
 bead bracelet and also teaches you 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:19.170
 another different only that I made it 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.060
 my sister because she loves them 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.949
 the peaks this is a rock style and to 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.779
 she likes it and if you also 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.250
 like this you will love it really 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.410
 it's very easy action the only thing that 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.210
 it takes a little bit is the state if 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.890
 The materials you can get us in 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.840
 any fabric store or in a 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.940
 haberdashery how much much and what 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.220
 I'm exaggerating I spent 40 pesos on 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.879
 make these two bracelets I hope that you 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.879
 like this tutorial 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:45.380
 The first thing we are going to use is going to be 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.150
 a small lock looks for one that gives you the 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.100
 turn your hand so you can use it 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.930
 Wristwatches are also going to use a 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.580
 estoperoles against these piquitos that 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.860
 I liked them more because they have an ojito 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.420
 to know them and they look better and brooches 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.850
 to be at arm wrestling I found 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.590
 these rings with these little things that 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.600
 they look like little teeth but you can 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.610
 use the ones you find begins 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.710
 putting your peaks or steers to your 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.630
 close in this case I am cooking 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.490
 because I found these but I the ones 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.680
 have 10 successes that only adhere to 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.869
 the cloth those are a lot easier to 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.229
 put on but we will last longer those who are 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:17.229
 cooked 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.200
 I found all the materials in one 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.200
 Cloth store 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.410
 when you finish sewing on one side 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.820
 continue with the other to fill all your 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.820
 closing of peaks or estoperoles 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:42.550
 when you finish placing them all 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.560
 will have something similar to this 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.300
 now with the pins that I mentioned 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.950
 at the beginning I'm going to close my bracelet 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.950
 these clasps and repression 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.050
 and with the rings I will create the brooch 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.920
 He cited for closing this is the same 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.920
 close the pressure 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.440
 and so my brooches are now the only thing 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.420
 What do I have to do is fasten my 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.220
 bracelet and we'll have our first 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.290
 design but in our next 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.790
 we designed to use the same only in 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.709
 instead of this but we are going to use them 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.720
 a chain that think about this design because 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.910
 it's easier to get a chain that 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.190
 the estoperoles this time then sew the 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.319
 string or paste it but I prefer 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.480
 sew it because I know it will last me longer 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:35.790
 so I recommend that each one of you 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.090
 the chain links to be 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.090
 see better 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:45.620
 just as the previous design is going 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.620
 to know him by both parties of the closing 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.190
 and this one we're going to put the 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.190
 clasps to close your bracelet 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.440
 when there is true t applied 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:07.440
 will be if your bracelet 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:14.460
 and ready has been our beautiful 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:15.990
 bracelets and super easy really 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:18.630
 they love these possibilities apart 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:20.760
 I told them and I promised to teach them something 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.410
 very easy that not at all expensive in 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.060
 truth to me it fills me a lot that you 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.070
 They know the things that I teach them though 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.230
 Here he is teaching because that's how I know 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:32.480
 like and it serves them and all in seeing the 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.480
 projection bracelet 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:45.260
 description truth I am here I know that 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:52.620
 really to know how many prisoners 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.710
 they want to make this office we go that 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.730
 another thing you want me to teach you to do 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:58.980
 comments although sometimes it does not give me 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:02.810
 time to hire everyone took into account 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.810
 everything you write to me 

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:08.040
 it happened to me to tell you that we are also going to 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:10.490
 need apple cider vinegar adds 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.620
 only two scoops 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:14.900
 to finish with our dressing with 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.400
 Salt and pepper to taste and stir it 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.680
 All very well 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.780
 for me in the morning I will use a 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.840
 price 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:25.910
 Serve it on a plate 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.700
 finish your dessert decorating it with 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:31.330
 worm gummies 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.330
 so we have left
