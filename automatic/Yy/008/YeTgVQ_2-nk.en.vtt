guys so I'm gonna do one of my trademark
flex<00:01:56.009> tests<00:01:56.520> so<00:01:57.270> I'm<00:01:57.990> putting<00:01:58.229> fair<00:01:58.860> amount<00:01:59.070> of

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
flex tests so I'm putting fair amount of

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.830 
flex tests so I'm putting fair amount of
pressure<00:01:59.369> on<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.729> notebook<00:02:00.030> itself<00:02:00.329> there's

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
almost no flex to the unit whatsoever so

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.359 
almost no flex to the unit whatsoever so
that<00:02:03.509> really<00:02:03.810> does<00:02:04.110> show<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.710> build<00:02:05.159> quality

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
that really does show the build quality

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:06.830

iPhone<00:03:27.880> comparison<00:03:28.540> for<00:03:28.780> thickness<00:03:28.959> here<00:03:29.380> I'm

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
iPhone comparison for thickness here I'm

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.140 
iPhone comparison for thickness here I'm
actually<00:03:29.950> going<00:03:30.190> to<00:03:30.280> fold<00:03:30.459> down<00:03:30.700> the<00:03:30.730> screen

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
actually going to fold down the screen

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.270 
actually going to fold down the screen
just<00:03:31.750> because<00:03:32.079> it<00:03:32.230> should<00:03:32.410> wake<00:03:32.590> up<00:03:32.769> instantly

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
just because it should wake up instantly

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.069 
just because it should wake up instantly
because<00:03:33.549> it<00:03:33.670> has<00:03:33.790> an<00:03:33.910> SSD<00:03:34.209> inside<00:03:34.720> it

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:35.079 
because it has an SSD inside it
