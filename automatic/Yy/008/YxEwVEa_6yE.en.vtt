to<00:04:14.270> the<00:04:14.540> settings<00:04:15.020> and<00:04:17.080> see<00:04:18.080> if<00:04:18.620> I<00:04:18.739> can<00:04:18.920> change

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
to the settings and see if I can change

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:26.410 
to the settings and see if I can change
kind<00:04:20.780> of<00:04:20.870> many<00:04:21.200> buttons<00:04:21.650> here<00:04:25.270> it<00:04:26.270> doesn't

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:26.420 
kind of many buttons here it doesn't

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:27.730 
kind of many buttons here it doesn't
really<00:04:26.570> seem<00:04:26.870> like<00:04:27.080> I<00:04:27.200> could<00:04:27.380> change<00:04:27.560> the

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
really seem like I could change the

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.080 
really seem like I could change the
buttons<00:04:28.040> but<00:04:28.190> I'm<00:04:28.310> pretty<00:04:28.490> sure<00:04:28.580> that<00:04:28.760> I<00:04:28.940> can

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
buttons but I'm pretty sure that I can

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:30.940 
buttons but I'm pretty sure that I can
change<00:04:29.240> the<00:04:29.390> buttons<00:04:29.720> so<00:04:30.020> I<00:04:30.260> basically<00:04:30.680> will

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
change the buttons so I basically will

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:36.180 
change the buttons so I basically will
play<00:04:31.340> the<00:04:31.490> game<00:04:31.960> without<00:04:32.960> that<00:04:34.750> this
