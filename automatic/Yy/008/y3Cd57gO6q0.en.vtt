00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:07.250
 We are going to talk right now to the 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.250
 farm 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:15.949
 j regarding a project meeting the 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:24.840
 raising a hen with the handsome hen 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:25.859
 that is what we will talk to him 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.289
 now roni 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.599
 this project creation of henbane hen 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.099
 everything indicates that it will work even here 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.010
 in the municipality of varjota 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.980
 Good morning everyone, in fact, this project 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.809
 It's already working out its green. 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.760
 I believe that this mobilization of the group 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.070
 through this partnership between 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.440
 the municipality of the prefecture 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.840
 j along with unions 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.539
 workers in the part of the 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.879
 mobilization of groups identify the 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.190
 groups that have potential so there 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.320
 some time is already happening then 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.079
 In fact, he said that it is already 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.189
 can there actually is 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.479
 following in stages 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:09.720
 all beneficiaries 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:14.450
 he already has something started taught then 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:19.250
 I think probably enough 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:24.409
 people are seeing here a 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:27.509
 It may come close. 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:33.890
 here we see that it is not a wire is a 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:39.119
 to show it to our friends. 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:42.799
 then viewers here we it 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:45.600
 here is an example of a first 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:48.030
 equipment of that preparation for the 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.790
 The creation of hen's hen is exactly 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.740
 in fact this work in a way 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.530
 differentiated that chicken design 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.350
 country in which we organize this 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.110
 program with the production actually this 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.930
 part of the screen is the so-called 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.780
 ex- chicken coop now is needed to 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.190
 that we can produce the quantity 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.440
 specific treatment of chickens within a 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.140
 since then this project has been 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.810
 all dimensioned respecting circular 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.819
 respect federal resolution in the 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.800
 What is it you say you have to create 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:22.200
 country chicken in the space of at least 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:25.080
 three square meters per area head 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.900
 daily picket of pasta then this 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.780
 partition this screen does not give us disgust 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:35.610
 condition guarantees this standardization of the 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:38.130
 product is very well here and if for this 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.500
 project which are the directors or 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.750
 supporters of this project, we know 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:46.190
 what the secretary has to the city hall 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:48.900
 through the secretariat of agriculture has 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:52.590
 other governments than other 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:55.860
 institutions is actually this project. 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.870
 when we design this project we 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.209
 we commented that there are some steps 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.010
 to make it possible to 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:04.110
 the first step would be part of the 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.880
 technical support consultancy 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:13.470
 that this project is being guaranteed 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:16.320
 the two groups so that it can be 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.930
 the other very strong partner 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:22.560
 How do you say it is a municipality of varjota 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:24.209

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:58.560
 perceives very great where the 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:59.610
