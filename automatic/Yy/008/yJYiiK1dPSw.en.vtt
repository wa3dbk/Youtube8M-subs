00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.289
 my dream of becoming a pig 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:17.940
 flying has finally come true you pay 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.310
 brothers of minecraft item hate are 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.270
 piece and today I'm here to introduce you to the 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.609
 mort mod 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.900
 let's start immediately let's see what's there 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.580
 introduces this new fashion 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.650
 meanwhile it immediately begins to tell you that 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.189
 this fashion was created by the hichans 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.860
 hichan is the programmer he created 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:36.059
 both the door to gun and the bee grinder e 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.460
 many other fashions 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.250
 this in my opinion is the fashions that it is 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.489
 the most beautiful of all was the anchor 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.770
 more epic I have to say it really is epic and 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.170
 and was developed only in three days 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.920
 imagine this fashion developed into 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.320
 just three days 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.670
 what introduces us well let's see it 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.770
 then this fashion begins in the meantime 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.980
 immediately telling you that it has functionality with 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.449
 all the other fashions that is, meanwhile, we would have 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.520
 need an animal an animal 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.320
 any one any bob we can 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.810
 take it from the hook kratos from the mutant 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.380
 created by all the fashions they introduce 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.020
 of the mod 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.450
 what we do kill the mob that 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.659
 we want is suddenly will come 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.570
 decomposed and you know what happens 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.619
 we transform ourselves in that way is one 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.320
 absurd thing 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.180
 I will come also the products powers 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.729
 special ie the clipper will explode 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.250
 the gas can throw fireballs but 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.140
 the best thing of all is that we do 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.630
 we could transform that way 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.909
 and besides doing the kinematics 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.979
 whatever we will also have powers 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.409
 special in every way for example 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.060
 let's take the spider kill the spider 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.880
 for example and we transform ourselves 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.009
 immediately in the spider we take the 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.680
 its heights ie the low one 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.970
 of the spider and we can when 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.299
 they will introduce I don't know if they already have it 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:57.420
 put no you see we can step over i 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.829
 higher blocks 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.719
 we could do it in later versions 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:04.079
 that is, for example, we find a block 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:06.000
 other 2 see so we can climb over it 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.740
 But we can't because we're alone 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.179
 one, however, in future versions 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.670
 we can do it 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:15.000
 and this is a special thing because 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:17.400
 no fashions in the shape fister mi 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.319
 remember what it's called introducing this 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.049
 what ever this thing done much better 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.790
 any mob for example slime it 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:26.340
 we also take the slime we become 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.959
 even smaller than large online municipality 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.409
 and we can do all the things they do 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:33.019
 slimes or like a hog a zombie 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:35.489
 a zombie the enemy we can't 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:38.159
 turn even into the zombie 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:40.109
 see we grow in height and we have the 

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:42.299
 zombie features the beautiful thing 

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:44.159
 besides all this is that then 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:46.169
 let's say a moment the fat one 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:48.959
 clicking the question mark button 

00:02:46.169 --> 00:02:51.030
 we have all the mobs on the menu 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:53.430
 that is, we can find spiders which ones 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.620
 we say transformed for example 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.209
 clicking the right button we will see 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.459
 the animation look beautiful 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.829
 animation and we become the 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:04.650
 little pig or we can do the thing 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:06.629
 reverse that is from porcellina slime and so 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.760
 away there is this wonderful animation 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:10.919
 fashion is made up for good and then we are 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.419
 also return to our basic form e 

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:15.449
 ios and now i'll take you off i'll show you 

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:16.829
 that when we turn ops I have 

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:19.139
 mistaken 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:21.290
 let's take a moment like this and do it 

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:24.629
 turn into a skeleton for a moment 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:26.519
 perfect when we transform look 

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:28.799
 the hand also changes the hand 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:30.510
 you see everything changes practically 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:33.750
 improved a lot that is a mod 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.879
 beautiful made in three days was 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.169
 very good however chan is one of the 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:39.750
 best ways I 've ever seen 

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:41.209
 comment on telling me what you think 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.530
 because I don't think I have any pick ups 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:45.569
 we can interact with all the blocks 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.759
 any even being skeletons o 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:49.109
 any other fashions and in the future I have 

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:50.849
 read these more still a beta 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:53.310
 all will be introduced 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:54.620
 upgrades that mobs have anyway 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.060
 guy in remembrance to put I like 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.680
 150 I will publish a new fashion 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.909

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:04.970
