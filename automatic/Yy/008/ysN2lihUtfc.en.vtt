after the water fountain break I ran

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.979 
after the water fountain break I ran
about<00:03:11.440> 0.2<00:03:12.190> miles<00:03:12.459> before<00:03:13.299> I<00:03:13.480> figured<00:03:13.840> that

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
about 0.2 miles before I figured that

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:18.570 
about 0.2 miles before I figured that
out<00:03:14.019> so<00:03:14.700> I<00:03:16.170> think<00:03:17.170> that's<00:03:17.440> great<00:03:17.590> it's<00:03:18.160> now<00:03:18.370> my

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
out so I think that's great it's now my

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.600 
out so I think that's great it's now my
personal<00:03:18.790> record<00:03:19.390> my<00:03:19.570> last<00:03:20.070> farthest<00:03:21.070> run<00:03:21.370> was

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.610 
personal record my last farthest run was

personal record my last farthest run was
eight<00:03:21.970> miles<00:03:22.350> so<00:03:23.350> I<00:03:23.680> have<00:03:23.920> no<00:03:24.220> doubt<00:03:24.489> that<00:03:24.790> in<00:03:25.239> a

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
eight miles so I have no doubt that in a

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.080 
eight miles so I have no doubt that in a
race<00:03:25.540> situation<00:03:25.840> I'd<00:03:26.680> have<00:03:26.950> no<00:03:27.280> problem

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
race situation I'd have no problem
