00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 Hello to you all antoha good and 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.540
 Now I invite you to look 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.780
 small but very interesting video 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.570
 Obzorchik from Gregory 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:15.750
 Grigory and shot means this video here 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.580
 on your system unit to freshly assembled 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.380
 system block configuration data 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:24.289
 system unit was compiled by us 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:27.599
 jointly within the framework of the pugachev assembly 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:29.849
 connection with this love special thanks 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.940
 great for sending in footage 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.710
 because of the wise assembly how would she not 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.510
 implies by itself was not even there 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.890
 I don’t even ask for requirements 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.329
 nobody if the speech assembly 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.079
 send some videos 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.879
 not necessarily at all 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.629
 difference let 's say interactive with antoha 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:54.329
 where participation is completely free but in 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.829
 same time there I really ask people for 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.260
 possibilities of course 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.379
 shoot some video clips at least 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.329
 small on the basis of assembly so here in 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.570
 framework interactive, in principle, we already have 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.189
 there were enough participants but 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:11.960
 Video reviews in my opinion was only 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:14.610
 two are not at all thick but here 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:18.570
 Gregory despite the fact that the assembly was 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.590
 it was not too hot to shoot 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.450
 video footage 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.890
 and now I invite you to watch 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:28.350
 video materialchik interesting enough 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.240
 Bundling good for my money then 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.630
 there is a very powerful plus me very 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.000
 Liked on let's design 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:40.470
 let's see what we did hello 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.630
 current is Gregoria from Moscow together 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.570
 collected with you a computer that's what 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:51.869
 It turned out the principle of the assembly 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:56.540
 I was particularly pleased that we 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:02:02.189
 yes we see all should guarantee that's 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:04.430
 proud on every block on every 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:09.179
 joint 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:12.580
 nightstand which guarantees that the flow 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:17.800
 years, you can easily contact 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:20.230
 but the warranty is specifically for the assembly and more 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.600
 there is a guarantee on specifically for specific 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.480
 the details 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:29.010
 specifically for each separately you asked 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:31.440
 see how the monitor is doing 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:38.380
 Basically everything suits me 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:41.590
 There is a function of catching blue light along the way for 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:50.980
 reading in principle on it I spend 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:53.770
 most of the time well actually there 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:58.090
 so many adjustment modes you can 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:59.400
 generally pick up your connecting me 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:03.550
 hdmi 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:05.830
 this is probably the most 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:08.920
 useless crap and what could be 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.180
 I always have some little things there 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:15.580
 there are small parts 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:19.030
 Well, in principle, ok so we have 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.950
 here it is that i was worried here 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:26.160
 the only moment that I don’t 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:29.650
 like here it's like a video card 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:35.230
 but since I am a person not experienced in this 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:38.019
 I think everything works fine 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:41.170
 overheated for fifty dollars probably 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:46.540
 no further heated may somehow have 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:53.400
 will muster up to try 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:04:00.510
 disperse vidosiki looked principle well 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:04:06.090
 showing how to drive like that 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:10.290
 like all normal cable laid 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:18.769
 they stick out and here you see another 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:23.130
 I picked up such a block 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:26.900
 The body itself is basically a button 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.900
 which speeds up the work 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:40.139
 additional valves that are still 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:45.510
 right there, too, in principle, I am satisfied with everything 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:49.650
 what wanted everything got the bottom there some 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:53.930
 mesh is that is, to the maximum body 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.930
 it suits me but one hundred percent 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:08.760
 tfp sq now will not show in 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:12.360
 principle in battle on ultra 8090 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:16.350
 edge 70 if falls it is very rare when 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:20.940
 some cruel chopped there 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:25.700
 And so the principle in tanks in a crisis I then 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:31.560
 there is well as it should be 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:35.250
 this assembly, he pulls all thanks 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:41.070
 you again antoha for something that helped 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:45.630
 assemble this comrade very 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:47.340
 thank you give thanks again 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:49.410
 where the video was filmed 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:52.770
 if you are interested in the service of Mukhachev 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:55.710
 assembly please contact group 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:58.040
 contact VKontakte by e 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:00.440
 which mail you will find in the video description 

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:03.060
 I will gladly help you to make 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:05.660
 configuration thanks everyone for watching up 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.660
 new meetings
