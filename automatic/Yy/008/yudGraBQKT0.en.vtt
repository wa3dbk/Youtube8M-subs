00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
thinking about the traction test let me

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:02.990 
thinking about the traction test let me
know<00:01:02.039> what<00:01:02.160> you<00:01:02.219> guys<00:01:02.309> think<00:01:02.489> about<00:01:02.640> this<00:01:02.820> idea

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
know what you guys think about this idea

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.539 
know what you guys think about this idea
is<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:03.780> just<00:01:04.019> one<00:01:04.290> single<00:01:04.559> shoe<00:01:04.860> in<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.040> video<00:01:05.309> as

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
is to just one single shoe in a video as

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.580 
is to just one single shoe in a video as
opposed<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:06.000> comparing<00:01:06.479> two<00:01:06.630> shoes<00:01:06.930> it'll<00:01:07.500> be

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
opposed to comparing two shoes it'll be

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.440 
opposed to comparing two shoes it'll be
a<00:01:07.619> lot<00:01:07.830> quicker<00:01:08.010> style<00:01:08.460> video<00:01:08.760> but<00:01:09.270> you<00:01:09.360> get

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
a lot quicker style video but you get

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.000 
a lot quicker style video but you get
lots<00:01:09.720> of<00:01:09.840> information<00:01:10.110> about<00:01:10.439> one<00:01:10.770> particular

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
lots of information about one particular

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.550 
lots of information about one particular
shoe<00:01:11.640> in<00:01:11.880> like<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:12.450> two<00:01:12.689> to<00:01:12.840> three<00:01:13.049> minute<00:01:13.320> video

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
shoe in like a two to three minute video

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.499 
shoe in like a two to three minute video
so<00:01:13.770> i<00:01:13.799> think<00:01:13.890> that<00:01:14.130> would<00:01:14.189> be<00:01:14.280> pretty<00:01:14.400> good<00:01:14.700> but

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
so i think that would be pretty good but

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.359 
so i think that would be pretty good but
moving<00:01:15.869> forward<00:01:16.259> with<00:01:16.470> these<00:01:16.650> traction<00:01:17.159> tests

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
moving forward with these traction tests

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.520 
moving forward with these traction tests
and<00:01:17.549> play<00:01:17.700> test<00:01:17.970> videos<00:01:18.299> I<00:01:18.540> want<00:01:19.049> to<00:01:19.140> make<00:01:19.259> like

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
and play test videos I want to make like

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.859 
and play test videos I want to make like
I<00:01:19.560> said<00:01:19.830> more<00:01:20.100> at<00:01:20.549> least<00:01:20.759> one<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.000> week<00:01:21.090> so<00:01:21.720> what
