00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
essential vitamins and things and I'm

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.270 
essential vitamins and things and I'm
also<00:03:22.570> instead<00:03:23.570> of<00:03:23.660> the<00:03:23.750> biotin<00:03:24.350> used<00:03:24.830> to<00:03:25.010> take

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
also instead of the biotin used to take

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.550 
also instead of the biotin used to take
biotin<00:03:25.820> I<00:03:25.940> now<00:03:26.150> take<00:03:26.209> silica<00:03:27.170> which<00:03:27.350> i<00:03:27.500> think

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
biotin I now take silica which i think

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.140 
biotin I now take silica which i think
is<00:03:27.800> quite<00:03:28.010> similar<00:03:28.519> but<00:03:29.269> I<00:03:29.330> think<00:03:29.570> silica<00:03:30.290> is

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
is quite similar but I think silica is

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.710 
is quite similar but I think silica is
more<00:03:32.860> vegetable<00:03:33.860> base<00:03:34.070> more<00:03:34.720> natural

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
more vegetable base more natural

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.690 
more vegetable base more natural
naturally<00:03:36.500> based<00:03:36.680> and<00:03:38.110> so<00:03:39.110> yeah<00:03:39.890> the<00:03:40.160> silica

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
naturally based and so yeah the silica

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.840 
naturally based and so yeah the silica
is<00:03:40.940> by<00:03:41.209> brand<00:03:42.019> called

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
is by brand called

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.960 
is by brand called
solar<00:03:43.850> solar<00:03:44.660> array<00:03:45.580> and<00:03:46.580> that's<00:03:46.790> about

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
solar solar array and that's about

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:48.060 
solar solar array and that's about
that's<00:03:47.510> so<00:03:47.540> good

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.070 
that's so good

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.600 
that's so good
still<00:03:49.070> would<00:03:49.160> take<00:03:49.370> those<00:03:50.019> every<00:03:51.019> day<00:03:51.049> as<00:03:51.410> well

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610 
still would take those every day as well
