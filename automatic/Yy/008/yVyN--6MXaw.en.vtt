your little nudie girl there and then

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.700 
your little nudie girl there and then
you've<00:01:09.570> got<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.780> forklift<00:01:10.229> that<00:01:10.470> you<00:01:10.560> can

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
you've got the forklift that you can

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.320 
you've got the forklift that you can
just<00:01:10.860> walk<00:01:11.010> for<00:01:11.220> as<00:01:11.280> well<00:01:11.460> which<00:01:11.670> is<00:01:11.700> pretty

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
just walk for as well which is pretty

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.520 
just walk for as well which is pretty
weird<00:01:12.540> but<00:01:12.720> you<00:01:12.780> could<00:01:12.900> probably<00:01:13.049> make<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.290> cool

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
weird but you could probably make a cool

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.740 
weird but you could probably make a cool
photo<00:01:13.740> of<00:01:13.979> you<00:01:14.159> like<00:01:14.369> trying<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.299> sit<00:01:15.570> inside

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
photo of you like trying to sit inside

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.149 
photo of you like trying to sit inside
it<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.170> you<00:01:16.409> could<00:01:16.530> actually<00:01:16.590> fool<00:01:16.979> some

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
it and you could actually fool some

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.130 
it and you could actually fool some
people<00:01:17.189> but<00:01:18.119> in<00:01:18.299> a<00:01:18.390> way<00:01:18.509> it's<00:01:18.750> quite<00:01:18.900> cool

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
people but in a way it's quite cool

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.420 
people but in a way it's quite cool
because<00:01:19.290> you<00:01:19.470> can<00:01:19.500> actually<00:01:19.650> hide<00:01:20.040> in<00:01:20.220> here

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
because you can actually hide in here

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.370 
because you can actually hide in here
and<00:01:20.490> people<00:01:20.850> can't<00:01:21.150> where<00:01:21.360> you<00:01:21.450> see<00:01:21.570> you<00:01:21.720> now

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
and people can't where you see you now

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.149 
and people can't where you see you now
if<00:01:22.439> you<00:01:22.560> do<00:01:22.619> want<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:22.860> know<00:01:22.950> where<00:01:23.100> the

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
if you do want to know where the

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.070 
if you do want to know where the
location<00:01:23.460> was<00:01:23.670> it<00:01:23.970> for<00:01:24.570> this<00:01:24.600> place<00:01:24.869> I

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
location was it for this place I

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.530 
location was it for this place I
actually<00:01:25.470> did<00:01:25.770> put<00:01:26.729> a<00:01:26.759> screen<00:01:27.150> shot<00:01:27.299> at<00:01:27.450> the

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
actually did put a screen shot at the

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.730 
actually did put a screen shot at the
end<00:01:27.689> of<00:01:27.840> this<00:01:27.900> video<00:01:28.080> so<00:01:28.439> you<00:01:28.530> can<00:01:28.560> actually

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
end of this video so you can actually

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.460 
end of this video so you can actually
see<00:01:28.890> where<00:01:29.280> its<00:01:29.909> actual<00:01:30.420> location<00:01:31.200> is<00:01:31.320> because

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
see where its actual location is because
