00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.020
 hello friends how are they and what they are 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:19.880
 the best and with the end not 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.170
 we have called rock &amp; move and so 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.960
 basically what this mode does is 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.939
 throw the cow the fungus cow to the 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.529
 chicken and the sheep then directly 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:29.060
 towards the sky very strange mind 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:31.010
 basically this mode is for 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.180
 entertain a little nothing more and also 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.519
 the other things but well let's see 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.840
 the first thing as you can see simply 

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:41.420
 I put the cow let's see is the 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.980
 the normal cow let's put it to normal 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.600
 this way on the floor we're going to 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.600
 appear in creative mode and 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.149
 how can you see what it does is go out 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.500
 flying like a rocket that's why it's called 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.199
 rockets because they fly out 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.100
 directly as a rocket and leave as 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.989
 a cross 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.989
 Now let's try the hen 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.370
 as you can see there is this one goes 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.240
 directly into space then 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:14.600
 will not come back let's see with the cow 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.600
 fungus 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.540
 and I think we say that the cow dies 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.380
 before going flying because life goes 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.510
 low obviously dies with the 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.560
 explosion but according to this the creator is 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.110
 what we will do is make more 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.400
 strong to the animals so that 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.860
 survive and can fly away until 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.040
 wherever we are, we are not going to try the 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.040
 chicken 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.790
 until now 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.430
 flying and another thing that does this mode 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.840
 it's a tremendous madness that when you have 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.030
 the bow of any arrow 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.110
 simply shoot instead of hunting 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.110
 an arrow comes out as 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.140
 in the immense 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:08.400
 until then practically this 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.400
 mode is very crazy to infuse life 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.489
 It is so crazy 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:19.280
 It's crazy fashion but good 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:21.709
 you are truly entertained by a cat with 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.599
 point of view other people are used to 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:26.060
 do this road without control caves 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:29.170
 as you can see we found a super 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:32.120
 cave with lava and there are many things 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.780
 interesting and well basically this is 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.780
 the only thing we do 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.610
 nothing fun for a while then 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:44.959
 good is because they like this mode and 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.370
 friends the first thing is to enter the forum 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:48.470
 that leave them the description of rocket 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.670
 maps will already see you going down 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.440
 little as you can see here in the 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.720
 images is supposed to be a cow that 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.630
 it's going to fly away it's supposed to be 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.950
 You can see if you look very closely you 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.810
 we go down a little more and as you can see 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.530
 here this is before you shoot the 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.870
 arch and here is after 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.340
 this is a mess in a world with this but 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.190
 good 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.170
 here we can give us videos 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.140
 and down here is the download 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.710
 We speak where it says download client 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.050
 it's that easy 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:19.250
 will send us to the beach that simply 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.250
 we wait 5 seconds of advertising 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:25.370
 and we're going to give him publicity later 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.930
 in is that we do not need modern 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.569
 then there is no problem just 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.340
 they have to put the archives of 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:33.050
 rocket mobs to the point folder minecraft 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.120
 and then, well, let's do that 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.860
 we pass the file to the desktop to 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.400
 can install it better we 're going to 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:42.800
 start we put app data percent by 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.930
 cent for windows xp users here 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.459
 they appreciate them executing and they put him 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.190
 percent pp data percent we go to the 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:50.569
 capital roaming point minecraft team 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:53.420
 minecraft right click to open with 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:55.599
 windows archiver accept or also 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:58.030
 you can choose benz and that is another 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:04:00.110
 compressor and here simply 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.579
 we select the goal folder for the party 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:03.739
 we have eliminated it in capital letters and we are going 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:05.840
 that if you just make sure that this 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:08.120
 messina folder this because if you do not go 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.410
 that your minecraft fails and if it's a 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.860
 principle is not just being 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:14.840
 Attentive to this step open your rocket mox 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:16.549
 they open the folder that comes inside 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.900
 rocket maps how to put here and 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:19.400
 we simply select all the 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.780
 files and we pass them to minecraft 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.520
 point jar preferably in the part of 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.570
 down so you do not go 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.340
 binder 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:28.100
 in this way the rocket is installed 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:30.290
 ways so easy the truth does not have 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.820
 nothing complex nothing else remember 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:33.500
 delete mint folder infito of that and 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:36.620
 ready as you can see I did not think everything 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.200
 perfect and good let's create a world 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:41.980
 creative to see if it works fast 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:43.990
 we can not anymore 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:46.189
 to see 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.449
 some eggs to make them come out 

00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:53.569
 flying where are the eggs 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:53.569
 let's put locke 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:59.120
 here are to see what worked with 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:01.390
 nothing with nothing we are going to fly away a 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.390
 cow 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:06.670
 goodbye little cow 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.389
 and well, it works perfectly and 

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:12.889
 good has all been because they like 

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:14.900
 this way they make sure they get their like if they 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:16.940
 liked and in the description is my channel 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:18.259
 secondary and this one is also my 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:20.030
 twitter my facebook if you want me 

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:21.770
 continue there and well that's it, it's all because 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:24.190
 they liked it will not make us next and 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:24.190
 goodbye
