00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.720 
current flowing in or out of the battery
has<00:00:12.450> to<00:00:12.480> pass<00:00:12.750> through<00:00:12.780> the<00:00:13.170> shunt<00:00:13.410> that<00:00:13.799> way<00:00:14.700> I

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
has to pass through the shunt that way I

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.490 
has to pass through the shunt that way I
can<00:00:15.120> see<00:00:15.480> whether<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:15.929> battery<00:00:16.199> is<00:00:16.320> being

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
can see whether the battery is being

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.929 
can see whether the battery is being
charged<00:00:17.070> or<00:00:17.340> discharged<00:00:17.940> at<00:00:18.150> any<00:00:18.300> time<00:00:19.939> see

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
charged or discharged at any time see

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.259 
charged or discharged at any time see
here<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:22.010> terminal<00:00:23.010> of<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.160> battery<00:00:23.189> I<00:00:23.730> have

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
here the terminal of the battery I have

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.769 
here the terminal of the battery I have
a<00:00:24.420> six<00:00:24.869> gauge<00:00:25.140> wire<00:00:25.410> going<00:00:25.740> to<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:25.980> shunt<00:00:26.779> and

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
a six gauge wire going to the shunt and

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.779 
a six gauge wire going to the shunt and
on<00:00:28.050> this<00:00:28.199> terminal<00:00:28.650> here<00:00:29.130> of<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.369> shunt<00:00:29.609> we

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
on this terminal here of the shunt we

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.669 
on this terminal here of the shunt we
have<00:00:30.000> an<00:00:30.330> accessory<00:00:30.869> wire<00:00:31.170> we've<00:00:31.500> not

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
have an accessory wire we've not

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:32.749 
have an accessory wire we've not
connected<00:00:32.040> anything

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
connected anything

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.180 
connected anything
yeah<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.930> green<00:00:34.140> wire<00:00:34.320> here<00:00:34.620> goes<00:00:34.950> to<00:00:35.100> the

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
yeah the green wire here goes to the

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.000 
yeah the green wire here goes to the
regulator<00:00:35.550> rectifier<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:36.570> this<00:00:37.010> terminal

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
regulator rectifier and this terminal

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.819 
regulator rectifier and this terminal
here<00:00:38.070> that's<00:00:38.820> why<00:00:39.059> here<00:00:39.360> is<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.870> normal<00:00:40.440> round

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
here that's why here is the normal round

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.510 
here that's why here is the normal round
wire<00:00:41.070> for<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.430> bike<00:00:42.920> up<00:00:43.920> here<00:00:44.129> we<00:00:44.340> have<00:00:44.489> the

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
wire for the bike up here we have the

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.060 
wire for the bike up here we have the
actual<00:00:45.059> meter<00:00:47.660> it's<00:00:48.660> not<00:00:48.870> on<00:00:49.050> right<00:00:49.230> now<00:00:49.469> turn

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
on it click turn the mic on you see it's

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.650 
on it click turn the mic on you see it's
drawn<00:00:54.600> about<00:00:55.280> 9.2<00:00:56.280> amps<00:00:56.760> just<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.300> run<00:00:57.480> the

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
drawn about 9.2 amps just to run the

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.510 
drawn about 9.2 amps just to run the
headlights<00:00:59.120> and<00:01:00.170> see<00:01:01.170> if<00:01:01.440> I<00:01:01.649> hit<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.219> front

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
headlights and see if I hit the front

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.960 
headlights and see if I hit the front
brakes<00:01:02.760> here<00:01:03.530> goes<00:01:04.530> up<00:01:04.559> if<00:01:05.129> I<00:01:05.369> start<00:01:05.670> using<00:01:05.700> the

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
brakes here goes up if I start using the

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.550 
brakes here goes up if I start using the
turn<00:01:06.450> signal

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.600 

first<00:01:12.560> thing<00:01:12.770> I'm<00:01:12.890> going<00:01:13.009> to<00:01:13.100> do<00:01:13.220> is<00:01:13.460> I'm<00:01:13.579> going

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
first thing I'm going to do is I'm going

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.649 
first thing I'm going to do is I'm going
to<00:01:13.820> crank<00:01:14.060> the<00:01:14.270> bike<00:01:14.649> with<00:01:15.649> the<00:01:15.680> CD<00:01:16.460> I

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:16.659 
to crank the bike with the CD I

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:19.899 
to crank the bike with the CD I
disconnected<00:01:17.659> here<00:01:17.960> that<00:01:18.920> way<00:01:19.100> I<00:01:19.189> can<00:01:19.490> see<00:01:19.759> how

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:19.909 
disconnected here that way I can see how

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:23.940 
disconnected here that way I can see how
much<00:01:20.119> it's<00:01:20.360> drawing<00:01:20.750> just<00:01:21.340> to<00:01:22.340> crank<00:01:23.329> the<00:01:23.450> bike

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
much it's drawing just to crank the bike

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:35.529 
much it's drawing just to crank the bike
there<00:01:24.950> we<00:01:25.039> go<00:01:33.670> see<00:01:34.670> jumps<00:01:35.090> pretty<00:01:35.360> high

00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:35.539 
there we go see jumps pretty high

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:37.719 
there we go see jumps pretty high
initially<00:01:36.079> but<00:01:36.590> then<00:01:36.710> it<00:01:36.890> settles<00:01:37.100> in<00:01:37.429> around

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
initially but then it settles in around

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:42.029 
initially but then it settles in around
70<00:01:38.380> earlier<00:01:39.380> it<00:01:39.590> was<00:01:39.770> kind<00:01:40.009> of<00:01:40.600> alternating<00:01:41.600> to

00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:42.039 
70 earlier it was kind of alternating to

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:45.059 
70 earlier it was kind of alternating to
low<00:01:43.039> 70s<00:01:43.640> to<00:01:43.880> upper<00:01:43.909> 90s

00:01:45.059 --> 00:01:45.069 
low 70s to upper 90s

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:47.460 
low 70s to upper 90s
it's<00:01:46.069> cranking<00:01:46.459> a<00:01:46.520> little<00:01:46.729> faster<00:01:47.090> right<00:01:47.240> now

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
it's cranking a little faster right now

00:01:47.470 --> 00:02:00.960 
it's cranking a little faster right now
alright<00:01:48.470> let's<00:01:49.159> reconnect<00:01:49.549> the<00:01:49.700> CDI<00:01:50.060> here

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.199 

okay

00:02:02.199 --> 00:02:02.209 
okay

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:04.700 
okay
that's<00:02:02.390> CDI<00:02:02.750> back<00:02:03.080> together

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
that's CDI back together

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:10.400 
that's CDI back together
and<00:02:05.370> let's<00:02:05.880> crank<00:02:06.120> it<00:02:08.929> see<00:02:09.929> that<00:02:10.170> is<00:02:10.380> really

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
and let's crank it see that is really

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:17.760 
and let's crank it see that is really
negative<00:02:11.009> which<00:02:11.520> shows<00:02:11.820> the<00:02:12.060> battery<00:02:12.300> is<00:02:12.630> hard

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.740 

maybe<00:02:18.280> 1300<00:02:19.120> rpm

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:33.420 

my

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:58.650 

No

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.050 

pretty<00:02:59.560> good

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.449 

like<00:03:04.140> now<00:03:05.140> it's<00:03:05.170> running<00:03:05.739> off<00:03:05.920> of<00:03:05.950> battery

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
like now it's running off of battery

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.110 
like now it's running off of battery
alone<00:03:06.730> you<00:03:07.000> can<00:03:07.150> see<00:03:07.299> it's<00:03:07.450> discharging<00:03:08.110> the

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
alone you can see it's discharging the

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:20.710 
alone you can see it's discharging the
reading<00:03:10.120> has<00:03:10.269> gone<00:03:10.450> positive

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.310 

I'm<00:03:21.500> hoping<00:03:21.890> that<00:03:22.330> I'll<00:03:23.330> be<00:03:23.390> able<00:03:23.630> to<00:03:23.840> figure

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
I'm hoping that I'll be able to figure

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:25.930 
I'm hoping that I'll be able to figure
out<00:03:24.470> why<00:03:24.740> I've<00:03:24.890> killed<00:03:25.190> a<00:03:25.340> couple<00:03:25.490> batteries

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
out why I've killed a couple batteries

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.770 
out why I've killed a couple batteries
recently<00:03:26.600> if<00:03:26.810> I<00:03:26.930> may<00:03:27.110> be<00:03:27.170> my<00:03:27.610> starter<00:03:28.780> is

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
recently if I may be my starter is

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.720 
recently if I may be my starter is
pulling<00:03:30.290> too<00:03:30.440> much<00:03:30.620> at<00:03:30.800> certain<00:03:31.070> times<00:03:31.340> and

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
pulling too much at certain times and

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.610 
pulling too much at certain times and
killing<00:03:32.150> the<00:03:32.240> battery<00:03:32.590> slowly<00:03:33.590> or<00:03:34.550> if

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
killing the battery slowly or if

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.610 
killing the battery slowly or if
something<00:03:36.620> is<00:03:36.830> going<00:03:37.010> on<00:03:37.250> and<00:03:37.960> I'm<00:03:38.960> having<00:03:39.440> a

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
something is going on and I'm having a
