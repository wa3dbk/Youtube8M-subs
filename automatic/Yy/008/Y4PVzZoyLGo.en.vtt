and<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.189> chest<00:00:29.460> comes<00:00:29.730> forward<00:00:30.090> and<00:00:30.500> so<00:00:31.500> what

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
and the chest comes forward and so what

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.430 
and the chest comes forward and so what
that<00:00:31.650> does<00:00:32.040> it<00:00:32.430> gives<00:00:32.850> us<00:00:33.000> an<00:00:33.149> early<00:00:33.480> jump<00:00:33.510> and

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
that does it gives us an early jump and

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.620 
that does it gives us an early jump and
it<00:00:34.559> makes<00:00:34.770> it<00:00:34.860> jump<00:00:35.250> forward<00:00:35.550> on<00:00:35.820> photos<00:00:36.270> so<00:00:36.600> we

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
it makes it jump forward on photos so we

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.330 
it makes it jump forward on photos so we
didn't<00:00:37.020> need<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.440> be<00:00:37.500> able<00:00:37.559> to<00:00:37.680> feel<00:00:37.980> what<00:00:38.219> it's

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
didn't need to be able to feel what it's

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.880 
didn't need to be able to feel what it's
like<00:00:38.430> not<00:00:39.120> just<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.510> keep<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.840> chest<00:00:40.050> up<00:00:40.379> but
