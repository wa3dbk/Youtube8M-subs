00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:18.000
 you can not really see that it is very 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:18.000
 beautiful 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:33.280
 and shared with the materials is the 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:36.399
 I got in a store where they sell 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:39.129
 fabrics and I only ordered them as flowers 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:48.100
 artificial colors there are many 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:50.559
 very many to choose the wire and what 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:55.749
 I ordered lined there are three colors green coffee 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:58.799
 and it seems to me that white and finally some 

00:00:55.749 --> 00:00:58.799
 scissors that cut 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:05.540
 with the procedure we must cut 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:09.050
 to the size of our head with our 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:11.120
 scissors that we are going to try to leave a 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.220
 little more than your head measures 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.760
 so that you do not get so tight and you 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.760
 go hurt 

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:24.440
 but to the sides in this way 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.440
 here 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:34.740
 adjust it and let's start with the part 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:36.690
 funnier than just you sing and good me 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.310
 I 'm not cutting one by one because 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.310
 they are stuck to it 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.659
 to go them place wire manna 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:49.229
 I only developed them towards 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:51.830
 the sides if the same for all 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.830
 other flowers 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.399
 all right 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.170
 good to remember that you can do it in 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:07.439
 another shape and another style 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:10.110
 if you want to combine more colors or 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:12.209
 remove him and put only one color I think 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.340
 that is how the truth is that 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.750
 I loved this idea so I hope 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.269
 to put it into practice and if so 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.730
 here below I leave my social networks 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:25.410
 for me to be able to observe it and what 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:27.590
 they subscribed to this video here 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.590
 down 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:39.110
 the extra bloopers material along with 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.110
