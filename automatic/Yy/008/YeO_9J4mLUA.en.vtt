few shots and in that time you're going
to<00:02:02.579> be<00:02:02.640> dead<00:02:02.820> if<00:02:03.000> you're<00:02:03.090> running<00:02:03.299> into<00:02:03.420> two<00:02:03.630> or

to be dead if you're running into two or

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.020 
to be dead if you're running into two or
three<00:02:03.869> people<00:02:04.280> well<00:02:05.280> now<00:02:05.460> this<00:02:05.640> game<00:02:05.820> type

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
three people well now this game type

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.819 
three people well now this game type
specifically<00:02:06.630> team<00:02:06.869> swat<00:02:07.079> i<00:02:07.320> think<00:02:07.710> it's

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
specifically team swat i think it's

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.490 
specifically team swat i think it's
actually<00:02:08.009> a<00:02:08.250> good<00:02:08.489> transition<00:02:09.170> for<00:02:10.170> a<00:02:10.200> call<00:02:10.410> of

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
actually a good transition for a call of

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.020 
actually a good transition for a call of
duty<00:02:10.679> player<00:02:10.860> because<00:02:11.459> it's<00:02:11.610> much<00:02:11.819> faster

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
duty player because it's much faster

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.090 
duty player because it's much faster
paced

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
paced

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.520 
paced
one<00:02:13.280> head<00:02:13.520> shot<00:02:13.790> one<00:02:14.720> head<00:02:14.900> shot<00:02:15.110> will<00:02:15.260> kill

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
one head shot one head shot will kill

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.800 
one head shot one head shot will kill
the<00:02:16.010> other<00:02:16.130> team<00:02:16.400> as<00:02:16.640> you<00:02:17.390> can<00:02:17.540> see<00:02:17.780> right

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
the other team as you can see right

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.510 
the other team as you can see right
there<00:02:18.140> I<00:02:18.170> just<00:02:18.320> killed<00:02:18.680> three<00:02:18.860> guys<00:02:19.190> I<00:02:19.400> was

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
there I just killed three guys I was

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.950 
there I just killed three guys I was
probably<00:02:19.670> like<00:02:19.910> when<00:02:20.180> most<00:02:20.330> epic<00:02:20.630> play<00:02:20.810> I've

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:20.960 
probably like when most epic play I've

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.840 
probably like when most epic play I've
ever<00:02:21.050> done<00:02:21.320> it<00:02:21.800> was<00:02:21.950> probably<00:02:22.280> pretty<00:02:22.610> bad

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
ever done it was probably pretty bad

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.830 
ever done it was probably pretty bad
play<00:02:23.060> but<00:02:23.740> for<00:02:24.740> me<00:02:24.950> it<00:02:25.190> was<00:02:25.340> an<00:02:25.460> epi<00:02:25.730> play<00:02:25.940> but

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
play but for me it was an epi play but

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.510 
play but for me it was an epi play but
yeah<00:02:26.930> I<00:02:26.960> mean<00:02:27.020> it's<00:02:27.200> faster<00:02:27.980> paced<00:02:28.190> a<00:02:28.340> lot

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
yeah I mean it's faster paced a lot

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.630 
yeah I mean it's faster paced a lot
faster<00:02:28.910> paced<00:02:29.150> so<00:02:29.840> um<00:02:30.140> it's<00:02:30.770> easier<00:02:31.220> for<00:02:31.310> a

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
faster paced so um it's easier for a

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.430 
faster paced so um it's easier for a
call<00:02:31.970> duty<00:02:32.180> player<00:02:32.480> to<00:02:32.750> to<00:02:33.080> make<00:02:33.320> that

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
call duty player to to make that

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.620 
call duty player to to make that
transition<00:02:33.710> to<00:02:34.130> this<00:02:34.250> type<00:02:34.430> of<00:02:34.460> game<00:02:34.760> you<00:02:35.540> know

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
transition to this type of game you know

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.170 
transition to this type of game you know
it<00:02:35.750> just<00:02:35.780> takes<00:02:36.050> one<00:02:36.230> shot<00:02:36.320> to<00:02:36.590> kill<00:02:36.740> someone

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
it just takes one shot to kill someone

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.640 
it just takes one shot to kill someone
so<00:02:38.180> there's<00:02:38.540> not<00:02:38.630> a<00:02:38.690> lot<00:02:38.840> of<00:02:38.870> frustration<00:02:39.470> I

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
so there's not a lot of frustration I

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.470 
so there's not a lot of frustration I
know<00:02:40.070> for<00:02:40.370> me<00:02:40.460> there's<00:02:40.640> a<00:02:40.700> lot<00:02:40.850> of<00:02:40.880> frustration

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
know for me there's a lot of frustration

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.910 
know for me there's a lot of frustration
sometimes<00:02:41.630> when<00:02:42.110> I'm<00:02:42.200> playing<00:02:42.350> and<00:02:42.680> I<00:02:42.710> see

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
sometimes when I'm playing and I see

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.950 
sometimes when I'm playing and I see
myself<00:02:43.040> feel<00:02:43.970> like<00:02:44.180> I'm<00:02:44.330> shooting<00:02:44.690> the<00:02:44.780> crap

talking to a lot of better players in me
I've<00:02:51.410> come<00:02:51.620> to<00:02:51.680> realize<00:02:52.070> what<00:02:52.100> my<00:02:52.370> mistakes

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
I've come to realize what my mistakes

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.610 
I've come to realize what my mistakes
are<00:02:52.940> and<00:02:53.240> I<00:02:53.300> mean<00:02:53.810> I'm<00:02:53.900> slowly<00:02:54.170> I<00:02:54.320> feel<00:02:54.530> like

are and I mean I'm slowly I feel like
I'm<00:02:54.770> getting<00:02:54.890> better<00:02:55.160> but<00:02:56.000> it<00:02:56.390> is<00:02:56.720> not<00:02:57.290> the

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
I'm getting better but it is not the

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.460 
I'm getting better but it is not the
greatest<00:02:57.910> transition<00:02:58.930> like<00:02:59.930> the<00:03:00.080> two<00:03:00.230> games

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
greatest transition like the two games

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.350 
greatest transition like the two games
are<00:03:00.650> completely<00:03:01.130> different<00:03:01.550> they<00:03:02.060> require

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
are completely different they require

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.100 
are completely different they require
completely<00:03:02.960> different<00:03:03.260> skill<00:03:03.470> sets<00:03:03.710> and<00:03:05.110> you

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
completely different skill sets and you

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.230 
completely different skill sets and you
know<00:03:06.200> I<00:03:06.230> I<00:03:06.410> personally<00:03:07.040> feel<00:03:07.160> that<00:03:07.220> in<00:03:07.490> Halo<00:03:07.820> it

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:08.240 
know I I personally feel that in Halo it

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.780 
know I I personally feel that in Halo it
requires<00:03:08.600> a<00:03:08.720> little<00:03:08.930> bit<00:03:09.080> more<00:03:09.520> strategy<00:03:10.520> a

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
requires a little bit more strategy a

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.970 
requires a little bit more strategy a
little<00:03:11.240> bit<00:03:11.330> more<00:03:11.480> patience<00:03:11.960> than<00:03:12.500> call<00:03:12.770> duty

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
little bit more patience than call duty

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.440 
little bit more patience than call duty
