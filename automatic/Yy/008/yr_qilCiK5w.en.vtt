00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389

 you always see great photos and 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.809

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.359
 home bound or just live too 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.529

 Settings on the camera especially 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.559
 are important and which are creative 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.840
 possibilities arise from it 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.180
