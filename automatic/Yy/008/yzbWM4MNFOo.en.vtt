00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
good as CLG but i think she'll do

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.039 
good as CLG but i think she'll do
something<00:00:14.400> quite<00:00:14.639> a<00:00:14.670> bit<00:00:14.880> and<00:00:15.089> EG<00:00:15.660> is<00:00:15.750> looking

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.170 
something quite a bit and EG is looking
all<00:00:16.199> right<00:00:16.350> it's<00:00:17.100> unfortunate<00:00:17.640> that<00:00:17.670> it's

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
all right it's unfortunate that it's

all right it's unfortunate that it's
this<00:00:18.570> late<00:00:18.779> into<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.080> season<00:00:19.170> so<00:00:19.859> they<00:00:20.189> don't

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
this late into the season so they don't

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.950 
this late into the season so they don't
have<00:00:20.430> much<00:00:20.609> chance<00:00:20.880> of<00:00:21.119> going<00:00:21.330> to<00:00:21.510> play<00:00:21.660> alps

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
have much chance of going to play alps

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.200 
have much chance of going to play alps
but<00:00:22.529> if<00:00:22.650> we<00:00:22.830> do<00:00:23.039> really<00:00:23.460> really<00:00:23.580> poorly<00:00:23.970> in

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
but if we do really really poorly in

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.210 
but if we do really really poorly in
this<00:00:24.660> super<00:00:24.900> week<00:00:25.050> they<00:00:25.320> could<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:26.099> hopefully

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
this super week they could and hopefully

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.130 
this super week they could and hopefully
we<00:00:26.519> don't<00:00:26.670> we<00:00:27.000> need<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.210> just<00:00:27.359> win<00:00:27.689> like<00:00:27.930> a

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140

we don't we need to just win like a
couple<00:00:28.380> games<00:00:28.560> and<00:00:28.830> we<00:00:29.670> should<00:00:29.939> be<00:00:30.060> pretty

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
couple games and we should be pretty

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.299 
couple games and we should be pretty
much<00:00:30.510> to<00:00:31.019> care<00:00:31.199> for<00:00:31.349> playoffs<00:00:31.619> but<00:00:31.890> obviously

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
much to care for playoffs but obviously

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.700

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
playoffs with a winning streak so we can

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.030 
playoffs with a winning streak so we can
have<00:00:37.290> like<00:00:37.559> some<00:00:37.980> momentum<00:00:38.370> going<00:00:38.550> in

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
before and even then like before even

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.919 
before and even then like before even
though<00:02:04.340> he<00:02:04.429> looses<00:02:05.710> loose<00:02:06.710> ablaze<00:02:07.069> um<00:02:07.869> when<00:02:08.869> I

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:13.570 
was on TSM it wasn't like oh let's boys
is<00:02:11.390> God<00:02:11.630> that<00:02:11.900> I<00:02:11.930> can't<00:02:12.470> lane<00:02:12.890> again<00:02:13.160> so<00:02:13.340> he's

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880

going<00:02:56.270> into<00:02:56.420> it<00:02:56.630> under<00:02:57.050> SPM<00:02:57.560> but<00:02:57.980> same<00:02:58.340> time

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
going into it under SPM but same time

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.050 
going into it under SPM but same time
can't<00:02:59.270> overestimate<00:02:59.630> him<00:02:59.990> I<00:03:00.200> there<00:03:00.970> see<00:03:01.970> ya

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
can't overestimate him I there see ya

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.780 
can't overestimate him I there see ya
yes<00:03:02.959> I'm<00:03:03.110> looking<00:03:03.200> pretty<00:03:03.530> good<00:03:03.590> i<00:03:03.680> know<00:03:03.829> and

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.330 

so<00:03:07.849> if<00:03:08.329> we<00:03:08.719> do<00:03:09.230> really<00:03:09.439> want<00:03:09.650> super<00:03:09.890> we<00:03:10.010> can

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
so if we do really want super we can

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
so if we do really want super we can
actually<00:03:10.459> get<00:03:10.640> fifth<00:03:10.879> place<00:03:11.090> which<00:03:11.329> is

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
actually get fifth place which is

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.020 
actually get fifth place which is
actually<00:03:11.780> pretty<00:03:12.680> good<00:03:13.340> for<00:03:13.519> us<00:03:13.640> we<00:03:13.879> would

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
actually pretty good for us we would

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.429 
actually pretty good for us we would
probably<00:03:14.299> play<00:03:14.510> against<00:03:14.840> LG<00:03:15.109> or<00:03:15.140> something

00:03:15.429 --> 00:03:15.439 
probably play against LG or something

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:17.589 
probably play against LG or something
which<00:03:15.560> we<00:03:15.680> have<00:03:15.829> a<00:03:15.859> money<00:03:16.099> record<00:03:16.400> against<00:03:16.969> and

00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:17.599 
which we have a money record against and

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:19.420 
which we have a money record against and
then<00:03:17.750> we<00:03:17.900> possibly<00:03:18.439> could<00:03:18.590> putting<00:03:18.859> it<00:03:18.980> on<00:03:19.099> cue

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
then we possibly could putting it on cue

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.099 
then we possibly could putting it on cue
which<00:03:19.700> we<00:03:19.849> also<00:03:20.090> when<00:03:20.510> you<00:03:20.629> record<00:03:20.840> against

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:21.109 
which we also when you record against

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:22.929 
which we also when you record against
but<00:03:21.680> again<00:03:21.890> it<00:03:21.980> really<00:03:22.159> depends<00:03:22.489> on<00:03:22.609> super

00:03:22.929 --> 00:03:22.939 
but again it really depends on super

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:24.970 
but again it really depends on super
weak<00:03:23.090> and<00:03:23.329> we<00:03:23.810> play<00:03:24.019> against<00:03:24.260> all<00:03:24.409> these<00:03:24.650> teams

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
weak and we play against all these teams

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.280 
weak and we play against all these teams
um<00:03:25.250> and<00:03:26.239> we<00:03:26.299> can<00:03:26.450> really<00:03:26.659> determine<00:03:26.780> where<00:03:27.260> we

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
um and we can really determine where we

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.559 
um and we can really determine where we
stack<00:03:27.620> up<00:03:27.650> we<00:03:28.400> can<00:03:28.489> go<00:03:28.579> for<00:03:28.879> all<00:03:28.970> be<00:03:29.120> really

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:29.569 
stack up we can go for all be really

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:31.089 
stack up we can go for all be really
good<00:03:29.689> for<00:03:29.810> us<00:03:29.900> but<00:03:30.200> I<00:03:30.230> don't<00:03:30.470> it's<00:03:30.920> gonna<00:03:31.010> be

00:03:31.089 --> 00:03:31.099 
good for us but I don't it's gonna be

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:33.879 
good for us but I don't it's gonna be
hard<00:03:31.310> to<00:03:31.430> do<00:03:31.549> so<00:03:31.760> and<00:03:32.359> then<00:03:33.140> it<00:03:33.379> might<00:03:33.530> not<00:03:33.680> mean

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:33.889 
hard to do so and then it might not mean

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:35.979 
hard to do so and then it might not mean
too<00:03:34.040> much<00:03:34.069> this<00:03:34.609> mean<00:03:34.849> that<00:03:34.879> where<00:03:35.659> it<00:03:35.750> will<00:03:35.959> be

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
too much this mean that where it will be

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:38.559 
too much this mean that where it will be
on<00:03:36.260> a<00:03:36.290> winning<00:03:36.439> streak<00:03:36.590> but<00:03:37.579> yeah<00:03:38.329> the<00:03:38.420> big

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:38.569 
on a winning streak but yeah the big

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:39.910 
on a winning streak but yeah the big
thing<00:03:38.689> is<00:03:38.719> just<00:03:38.930> to<00:03:39.019> be<00:03:39.170> really<00:03:39.409> consistent
