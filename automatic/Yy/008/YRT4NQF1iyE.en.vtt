 with you as in the text the battery of nobles 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:16.630

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.489
 about 60 a lot of head the issue the models that use the lawsuit 

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:23.970

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.040

 to the reader and only 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.120
 the assistant 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.470

 after this first 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.270
 for what 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.430

 in the opportune moment contacts all the ethnic groups can no longer contain the use 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.070
 urban 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.400
 This could have gone before he went back to driving. 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.080
 this means that you do not want to from that more painful moment than 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.710
 the instruments gave a law student he is very precise ie me 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.740

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:48.289
