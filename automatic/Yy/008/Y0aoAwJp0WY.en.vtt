this<00:04:29.590> rounded<00:04:30.810> this<00:04:31.810> was<00:04:32.020> just<00:04:32.229> an<00:04:32.349> issue<00:04:32.560> we

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
this rounded this was just an issue we

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.560 
this rounded this was just an issue we
had<00:04:32.949> with<00:04:33.130> the<00:04:33.190> prototype<00:04:33.610> that's<00:04:34.360> going<00:04:34.510> to

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
had with the prototype that's going to

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.899 
had with the prototype that's going to
be<00:04:34.659> fixed<00:04:35.080> it's<00:04:35.919> not<00:04:36.010> really<00:04:36.159> even<00:04:36.520> so<00:04:36.669> much<00:04:36.789> an

00:04:36.899 --> 00:04:36.909 
be fixed it's not really even so much an

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:38.550 
be fixed it's not really even so much an
issue<00:04:37.000> is<00:04:37.210> it's<00:04:37.419> just<00:04:37.510> too<00:04:37.810> rounded<00:04:38.229> for<00:04:38.470> my

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
issue is it's just too rounded for my

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.450 
issue is it's just too rounded for my
taste<00:04:39.750> this<00:04:40.750> one<00:04:40.960> the<00:04:41.080> lockups<00:04:41.440> fairly<00:04:42.099> late

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
taste this one the lockups fairly late

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.200 
taste this one the lockups fairly late
and<00:04:42.759> a<00:04:43.060> lot<00:04:43.180> of<00:04:43.240> that<00:04:43.419> was<00:04:43.539> my<00:04:43.750> fault<00:04:45.030> walk<00:04:46.030> up

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
and a lot of that was my fault walk up

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.540 
and a lot of that was my fault walk up
on<00:04:46.330> this<00:04:46.539> one<00:04:46.690> is<00:04:46.919> darn<00:04:47.919> near<00:04:47.979> perfect<00:04:48.130> needs

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
on this one is darn near perfect needs

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.240 
on this one is darn near perfect needs
to<00:04:48.639> drop<00:04:48.789> in<00:04:48.970> just<00:04:49.210> a<00:04:49.300> little<00:04:49.599> further<00:04:50.250> lockup

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
to drop in just a little further lockup

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.370 
to drop in just a little further lockup
will<00:04:51.520> be<00:04:51.610> about<00:04:51.789> 60,000<00:04:52.630> so<00:04:52.840> about<00:04:53.050> thirty

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.380 
will be about 60,000 so about thirty

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.290 
will be about 60,000 so about thirty
percent<00:04:53.469> that's<00:04:54.400> what<00:04:54.639> I<00:04:54.669> told<00:04:54.789> the<00:04:55.029> machine

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:55.300 
percent that's what I told the machine

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.770 
percent that's what I told the machine
shop<00:04:55.450> that
