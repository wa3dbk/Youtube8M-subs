00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:21.580 
right fishing rod in my fishing almost

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.179 
right fishing rod in my fishing almost
always<00:00:21.850> I'm<00:00:22.390> using<00:00:22.690> seven<00:00:23.380> to<00:00:23.680> eight<00:00:23.859> foot

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:24.189 
always I'm using seven to eight foot

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:26.250 
always I'm using seven to eight foot
rods<00:00:24.460> the<00:00:25.060> longer<00:00:25.420> rod<00:00:25.600> does<00:00:25.869> a<00:00:25.900> couple<00:00:26.140> of

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:26.260 
rods the longer rod does a couple of

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.410 
rods the longer rod does a couple of
things<00:00:26.320> for<00:00:26.680> you<00:00:26.740> the<00:00:27.130> obvious<00:00:27.310> one<00:00:27.760> is<00:00:27.970> it

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:28.420 
things for you the obvious one is it

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.210 
things for you the obvious one is it
gives<00:00:28.689> you<00:00:28.810> the<00:00:28.930> longer<00:00:29.320> cast<00:00:29.590> it<00:00:29.890> helps<00:00:30.160> you

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:30.220 
gives you the longer cast it helps you

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:31.920 
gives you the longer cast it helps you
to<00:00:30.340> get<00:00:30.430> the<00:00:30.490> bait<00:00:30.760> out<00:00:30.970> there<00:00:31.000> but<00:00:31.720> more

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:31.930 
to get the bait out there but more

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:33.990 
to get the bait out there but more
importantly<00:00:32.500> is<00:00:32.739> what<00:00:33.129> happens<00:00:33.519> after<00:00:33.879> the

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:34.000 
importantly is what happens after the

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.689 
importantly is what happens after the
strike<00:00:34.360> the<00:00:34.840> longer<00:00:35.260> rod<00:00:35.500> allows<00:00:36.040> me<00:00:36.340> to<00:00:36.489> have

00:00:36.689 --> 00:00:36.699 
strike the longer rod allows me to have

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:38.580 
strike the longer rod allows me to have
that<00:00:36.820> bigger<00:00:37.120> arch<00:00:37.420> when<00:00:37.719> I<00:00:37.750> set<00:00:38.050> the<00:00:38.170> hook<00:00:38.350> and

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:38.590 
that bigger arch when I set the hook and

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.740 
that bigger arch when I set the hook and
take<00:00:39.010> up<00:00:39.160> a<00:00:39.280> lot<00:00:39.579> more<00:00:39.790> line<00:00:40.090> stretch<00:00:40.480> even

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:40.750 
take up a lot more line stretch even

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.750 
take up a lot more line stretch even
with<00:00:41.079> low<00:00:41.290> stretch<00:00:41.649> lines<00:00:41.950> like<00:00:42.219> fluorocarbon

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:42.760 
with low stretch lines like fluorocarbon

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.420 
with low stretch lines like fluorocarbon
there<00:00:43.120> is<00:00:43.270> still<00:00:43.660> a<00:00:43.930> stretch<00:00:44.440> factor<00:00:44.770> and<00:00:45.160> that

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:45.430 
there is still a stretch factor and that

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.520 
there is still a stretch factor and that
long<00:00:45.730> rod<00:00:46.000> helps<00:00:46.420> to<00:00:46.570> take<00:00:46.750> that<00:00:46.989> stretch<00:00:47.290> out

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:47.530 
long rod helps to take that stretch out

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.319 
long rod helps to take that stretch out
and<00:00:47.710> drive<00:00:48.160> the<00:00:48.399> hook<00:00:48.610> into<00:00:48.790> the<00:00:48.879> fish's<00:00:49.300> mouth

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:49.329 
and drive the hook into the fish's mouth

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:52.260 
and drive the hook into the fish's mouth
and<00:00:49.809> that<00:00:50.140> high<00:00:50.410> rod<00:00:50.710> that<00:00:51.070> longer<00:00:51.489> rod<00:00:51.700> gives

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:52.270 
and that high rod that longer rod gives

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:54.479 
and that high rod that longer rod gives
me<00:00:52.420> more<00:00:52.690> of<00:00:52.809> a<00:00:52.899> vertical<00:00:53.440> lift<00:00:53.620> helpful<00:00:54.250> fish

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:54.489 
me more of a vertical lift helpful fish

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:56.639 
me more of a vertical lift helpful fish
not<00:00:54.760> like<00:00:54.910> we're<00:00:55.239> like<00:00:55.390> leads<00:00:55.780> it<00:00:56.020> is<00:00:56.379> so

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:56.649 
not like we're like leads it is so

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:58.260 
not like we're like leads it is so
important<00:00:57.219> so<00:00:57.340> the<00:00:57.670> next<00:00:57.879> time<00:00:58.090> you're

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:58.270 
important so the next time you're

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.450 
important so the next time you're
