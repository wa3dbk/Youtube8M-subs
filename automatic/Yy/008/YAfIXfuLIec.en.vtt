corner<00:00:50.219> I'm<00:00:50.910> not<00:00:51.149> sure<00:00:51.329> how<00:00:51.510> it<00:00:51.629> works<00:00:51.809> in

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
corner I'm not sure how it works in

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.720 
corner I'm not sure how it works in
other<00:00:52.079> corners<00:00:52.500> but<00:00:52.739> I<00:00:52.770> can<00:00:52.980> only<00:00:53.070> assume<00:00:53.280> it

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
other corners but I can only assume it

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.240 
other corners but I can only assume it
would<00:00:53.850> brick<00:00:54.120> on<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.600> other<00:00:54.930> corners<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:56.070> go

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
would brick on the other corners and go

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.910 
would brick on the other corners and go
to<00:00:56.340> this<00:00:56.489> corner<00:00:56.789> and<00:00:57.120> then<00:00:57.360> crouch<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:58.109> what

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
to this corner and then crouch and what

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.619 
to this corner and then crouch and what
this<00:00:59.039> will<00:00:59.100> do<00:00:59.370> is<00:00:59.399> create<00:00:59.789> a<00:00:59.879> zombie<00:01:00.270> barrier

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
this will do is create a zombie barrier

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.640 
this will do is create a zombie barrier
glitch<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:01.170> zombies<00:01:01.920> can<00:01:02.160> I<00:01:02.250> hit<00:01:02.460> you<00:01:03.589> but<00:01:04.589> I
