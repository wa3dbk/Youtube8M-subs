 The corner of Nice is a hatchet of things so this game 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.000
 normal but quickly annoying 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.939
 like a few hours to play 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.509

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:22.860

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:50.119

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.799
 called survivalcraft 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.939
 the game, too, I really liked it but 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.060
 not that you can craft here but 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.720
 is that you can see here, I am going to hit here 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.330
 this gin 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:29.569
 bull cow and bull running at me 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:29.569
 two bulls well of course in one how fast 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:37.459
 maybe a 30 killer blouse could anyone 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.459
 to kill 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:46.970
 what make the game more interesting here 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:53.640
 look and now i'm going to land and they 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:57.799
 they will kill me on what to do as much as it cost 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.799
 you can be groups of even a lot then 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:08.740
 at the dolly plate up the game is good to 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:17.650
 kill about erase 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:24.210
 what do you now brewed show 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:24.210
 the third game is terraria 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:32.400
 also 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:35.890
 roshen games to play so may well 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:38.940
 So I noticed that in all like 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:45.190
 Meinkravt can play on the network as if 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:48.459
 together and on the server there of course 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:51.090
 cool here i have such a pet 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:59.920
 android i can call 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:04:02.170
 spear something smells here here such here 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:09.209
 there is a lot of stuff here 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:12.280
 iron a lot of everything so take a pick 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:14.050
 the most interesting here is not a pickaxe not an ax 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:22.270
 nothing at all would not end 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:44.379
 endless here 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:48.789
 we found to pour out in general too 

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:53.169
 playing is not very interesting to me 

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:58.500
 should i walk like it so that the police department 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:58.500
 there are many animals little chest straight 

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:10.380
 wooden boomer but these I have 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:13.380
 ordinary and world ruthlessly 8 chance 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.380
 birth11 

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:39.419
 ok now I'll show you the last game about 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.870
 kidkraft 

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:42.870
 pocket craft 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:52.660
 I hate this game because here's a pancake 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:55.960
 as it was done and these developers 

00:05:52.660 --> 00:06:00.120
 that she rolls over not 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:05.110
 flips like 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:08.650
 jagt upside down will be altogether 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:14.110
 some kind of stupid game or how soft it is 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:16.590
 say without meaning either in creative 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:21.520
 either survival and we have a lot of things 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:37.770
 little psilons how much and life is and 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:37.770
 zombies are cool all know fire / if 

00:06:38.039 --> 00:06:47.800
 you would not advise it for download 

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:51.000
 I do not know who wants to download from anyone who 

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:51.000
 does not draw meinkravt 

00:06:53.729 --> 00:07:04.360
 it's time to take stock and on the first 

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:05.320
 place we have survivalcraft well this is 

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:07.660
 my opinion 

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:10.500
 on the second block story on the third 

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:15.330
 terraria and the last papercraft 

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:15.330
 so okay with you was Nikita all bye
