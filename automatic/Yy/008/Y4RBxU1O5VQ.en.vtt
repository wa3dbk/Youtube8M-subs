00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 hello to all beautiful welcome in 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:07.109
 this new video today's video will be 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.330
 a little different because I'll make you a trick 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.599
 of magic those cards and I hope you 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.910
 costa like hello usually I do 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.920
 in fact, this game in the lovers I speak 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.690
 of brothers believes george weasley who 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.670
 during a winter day take 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.480
 a deck of cards and cut it more or 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.930
 less than half 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:28.500
 in this way then they start to mix 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:32.880
 the cards so as to get the 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:35.880
 cards alternating between black and red though 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.190
 not satisfied because they want a deck 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.000
 really very messy take the 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.040
 cards 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.620
 some yes and begin to turn them upside down 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.090
 some didn't like this this way 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.670
 very angry everyone else 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.410
 students and even professors why it? 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.050
 you could play cards with a deck 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.879
 so messy and slowly starts 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.579
 from detaching from fred and george 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.890
 they kept messing up the deck 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.230
 but slowly they begin to feel the 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:05.100
 lack of their friends and they understood that 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.650
 there was something to do here is this 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.010
 it was theirs but as you can see some 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.630
 cards were face to face and the other to back 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:15.180
 of others there were others 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.880
 I do or were they both face them 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:23.750
 but since they were their magicians with one 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:27.720
 snap of fingers I could flip 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:29.729
 all the boulder and the students 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.579
 professors were already happy because 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.220
 wedding was all upside down regularly 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:39.270
 but they are very good magicians 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:42.680
 with another snap they could 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:47.810
 create precisely the scale starting from the king 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.810
 to get up to the ace armed 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.590
 but they were gods as I have already told you 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:57.159
 very big wizards and I could do 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:02:00.040
 all other scales starting from 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:05.110
 that of spades was aimed at 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:08.440
 flowers and then again that of hearts and 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.630
 that of paintings and I hope this 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.390
 video a little different you both liked and 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.090
