the street that I was skateboarding on

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.550 
the street that I was skateboarding on
and<00:04:24.320> I

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
and I

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:25.990 
and I
did<00:04:24.740> not<00:04:24.889> realize<00:04:25.280> this<00:04:25.490> into<00:04:25.730> the<00:04:25.820> last

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
did not realize this into the last

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.090 
did not realize this into the last
second<00:04:26.419> because<00:04:27.020> I<00:04:27.260> had<00:04:27.410> all<00:04:27.650> this<00:04:27.770> stuff

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100 
second because I had all this stuff

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.070 
second because I had all this stuff
going<00:04:28.130> on<00:04:28.490> in<00:04:28.550> music<00:04:29.000> and<00:04:29.120> stuff<00:04:29.389> and<00:04:29.600> like

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
going on in music and stuff and like

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.110 
going on in music and stuff and like
there<00:04:30.350> was<00:04:30.440> a<00:04:30.500> stop<00:04:30.710> sign<00:04:30.889> for<00:04:31.190> her<00:04:31.280> and<00:04:31.460> I<00:04:31.880> kind

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
there was a stop sign for her and I kind

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.580 
there was a stop sign for her and I kind
of<00:04:32.180> figured<00:04:32.330> if<00:04:32.720> there<00:04:32.900> was<00:04:33.020> a<00:04:33.050> car<00:04:33.290> they<00:04:33.440> would

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
of figured if there was a car they would

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.590 
of figured if there was a car they would
stop<00:04:33.800> that<00:04:34.100> I<00:04:34.310> have<00:04:34.580> the<00:04:34.760> right<00:04:34.880> the<00:04:35.180> civilian

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 
stop that I have the right the civilian

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.659 
stop that I have the right the civilian

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340
