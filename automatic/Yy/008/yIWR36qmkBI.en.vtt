the place of the sacrificial system

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:01.469 
the place of the sacrificial system
which<00:01:57.100> went<00:01:57.399> before<00:01:57.690> it<00:01:58.690> is<00:01:59.560> a<00:01:59.940> reminder<00:02:00.940> of

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
which went before it is a reminder of

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:06.960 
which went before it is a reminder of
what<00:02:02.410> he<00:02:02.619> did<00:02:02.920> for<00:02:03.310> us<00:02:04.410> now<00:02:05.410> the<00:02:06.009> bread<00:02:06.280> was

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
what he did for us now the bread was

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.609 
what he did for us now the bread was
unleavened<00:02:07.959> bread

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
unleavened bread

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.559 
unleavened bread
now<00:02:09.610> the<00:02:09.670> leaven<00:02:10.360> is<00:02:10.569> a<00:02:10.780> symbol<00:02:11.319> of<00:02:11.440> sin<00:02:12.390> so<00:02:13.390> the

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
now the leaven is a symbol of sin so the

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.960 
now the leaven is a symbol of sin so the
bread<00:02:13.810> had<00:02:14.080> to<00:02:14.230> be<00:02:14.380> unleavened<00:02:15.099> because<00:02:15.490> Jesus

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
bread had to be unleavened because Jesus

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.920 
bread had to be unleavened because Jesus
Christ<00:02:16.300> was<00:02:16.660> sinless<00:02:17.380> and<00:02:18.240> in<00:02:19.240> the<00:02:19.360> same<00:02:19.630> way

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
Christ was sinless and in the same way

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.199 
Christ was sinless and in the same way
therefore<00:02:20.349> the<00:02:20.800> wine<00:02:21.010> must<00:02:21.790> have<00:02:22.000> been

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
therefore the wine must have been

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:24.900 
therefore the wine must have been
unfermented<00:02:23.170> wine<00:02:23.880> because<00:02:24.880> the

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
unfermented wine because the

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.710 
unfermented wine because the
fermentation<00:02:25.480> process<00:02:25.990> is<00:02:26.860> also<00:02:27.420> used<00:02:28.420> as<00:02:28.690> a

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
fermentation process is also used as a

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.100 
fermentation process is also used as a
symbol<00:02:29.260> of<00:02:29.380> sin<00:02:29.910> so<00:02:30.910> it<00:02:31.030> was<00:02:31.239> unfermented<00:02:31.840> wine

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
symbol of sin so it was unfermented wine

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.290 
symbol of sin so it was unfermented wine
and<00:02:33.180> unleavened<00:02:34.180> bread<00:02:35.670> now<00:02:36.670> how<00:02:36.940> does<00:02:37.000> this

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
and unleavened bread now how does this

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.199 
and unleavened bread now how does this
differ<00:02:37.569> from<00:02:37.780> the<00:02:38.050> mass<00:02:38.459> the<00:02:39.459> Bible<00:02:39.880> says<00:02:40.180> that

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
differ from the mass the Bible says that

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.970 
differ from the mass the Bible says that
Jesus<00:02:40.810> Christ<00:02:41.460> by<00:02:42.460> one<00:02:43.060> sacrifice<00:02:43.980> forever

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
Jesus Christ by one sacrifice forever

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.800 
Jesus Christ by one sacrifice forever
made<00:02:45.820> perfect

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
made perfect

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.920 
made perfect
so<00:02:48.170> his<00:02:48.410> one<00:02:48.709> sacrifice<00:02:49.069> at<00:02:49.730> the<00:02:49.910> cross<00:02:50.180> was

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
so his one sacrifice at the cross was

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.610 
so his one sacrifice at the cross was
sufficient<00:02:51.770> but<00:02:52.610> the<00:02:52.819> mass<00:02:53.090> is<00:02:53.480> a<00:02:53.620> continual

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
sufficient but the mass is a continual

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.120 
sufficient but the mass is a continual
sacrifice<00:02:55.540> the<00:02:56.540> mass<00:02:56.780> according<00:02:57.620> to<00:02:57.950> their

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
sacrifice the mass according to their

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.710 
sacrifice the mass according to their
definition<00:02:58.760> is<00:03:00.069> exactly<00:03:01.069> the<00:03:01.370> same<00:03:01.720> sacrifice

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
definition is exactly the same sacrifice

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.320 
definition is exactly the same sacrifice
that<00:03:03.200> took<00:03:03.470> place<00:03:03.740> at<00:03:04.069> the<00:03:04.340> cross<00:03:04.520> that's<00:03:04.970> why

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
that took place at the cross that's why

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.510 
that took place at the cross that's why
in<00:03:05.540> a<00:03:05.660> Roman<00:03:06.020> Catholic<00:03:06.200> Church<00:03:06.800> you<00:03:07.160> have<00:03:07.190> an

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 
in a Roman Catholic Church you have an

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.600 
in a Roman Catholic Church you have an
altar<00:03:08.090> and<00:03:08.390> in<00:03:09.319> a<00:03:09.440> Protestant<00:03:09.650> Church<00:03:10.190> you<00:03:10.430> do

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
altar and in a Protestant Church you do

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.420 
altar and in a Protestant Church you do
not<00:03:10.760> have<00:03:11.030> an<00:03:11.180> altar<00:03:11.739> because<00:03:12.739> an<00:03:12.860> altar<00:03:13.220> is<00:03:13.400> a

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
not have an altar because an altar is a

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.559 
not have an altar because an altar is a
place<00:03:13.819> where<00:03:14.630> a<00:03:14.690> sacrifice<00:03:15.470> takes<00:03:15.890> place<00:03:16.569> so

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:17.569 
place where a sacrifice takes place so

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:20.620 
place where a sacrifice takes place so
there<00:03:18.290> is<00:03:18.530> a<00:03:18.560> repeat<00:03:19.190> of<00:03:19.459> the<00:03:19.610> sacrifice<00:03:20.269> over

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
there is a repeat of the sacrifice over

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.580 
there is a repeat of the sacrifice over
and<00:03:21.200> over<00:03:21.860> and<00:03:22.100> over<00:03:22.489> again<00:03:22.820> and<00:03:23.590> Roman

and over and over again and Roman

and over and over again and Roman
Catholicism<00:03:24.920> teaches<00:03:25.850> the<00:03:26.360> doctrine<00:03:26.900> of

Catholicism teaches the doctrine of

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:31.229 
Catholicism teaches the doctrine of
transubstantiation<00:03:29.230> that<00:03:30.230> the<00:03:30.470> bread

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
transubstantiation that the bread

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:36.160 
transubstantiation that the bread
changes<00:03:32.380> literally<00:03:33.380> into<00:03:34.340> the<00:03:34.880> literal<00:03:35.510> body

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
changes literally into the literal body

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:37.750 
changes literally into the literal body
of<00:03:36.530> Christ

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
of Christ

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.440 
of Christ
now<00:03:38.750> that<00:03:39.380> is<00:03:39.590> not<00:03:39.800> biblical<00:03:40.300> because<00:03:41.300> the

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
now that is not biblical because the

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.190 
now that is not biblical because the
Bible<00:03:41.810> says<00:03:42.050> he<00:03:42.230> was<00:03:42.380> sacrificed<00:03:43.100> once<00:03:43.700> and<00:03:44.200> we

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
Bible says he was sacrificed once and we

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.460 
Bible says he was sacrificed once and we
do<00:03:45.350> not<00:03:45.500> sacrifice<00:03:46.250> him<00:03:46.550> over<00:03:47.330> and<00:03:47.540> over<00:03:48.290> and

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
do not sacrifice him over and over and

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.370 
do not sacrifice him over and over and
over<00:03:48.709> again<00:03:49.040> so<00:03:49.459> the<00:03:50.420> symbols<00:03:50.840> of<00:03:50.959> the<00:03:51.140> bread

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
over again so the symbols of the bread

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.759 
over again so the symbols of the bread
and<00:03:51.590> the<00:03:51.739> wine<00:03:51.769> are<00:03:52.510> exactly<00:03:53.510> that<00:03:53.810> symbols

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:54.769 
and the wine are exactly that symbols

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:58.600 
and the wine are exactly that symbols
which<00:03:55.610> point<00:03:56.030> to<00:03:56.780> the<00:03:56.930> body<00:03:57.170> of<00:03:57.440> Christ<00:03:57.950> who

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610 
which point to the body of Christ who

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.810 
which point to the body of Christ who
was<00:03:58.730> broken<00:03:59.239> for<00:03:59.420> us<00:03:59.480> and<00:03:59.900> the<00:04:00.019> wine<00:04:00.519> points<00:04:01.519> to

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:01.820 
was broken for us and the wine points to

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:05.500 
was broken for us and the wine points to
the<00:04:01.940> blood<00:04:02.180> that<00:04:02.930> was<00:04:03.170> spilt<00:04:03.620> for<00:04:03.890> us<00:04:04.269> now<00:04:05.269> who

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
the blood that was spilt for us now who

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.340 
the blood that was spilt for us now who
may<00:04:05.720> partake<00:04:06.260> in<00:04:07.329> the<00:04:08.329> communion<00:04:08.720> service

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:09.350 
may partake in the communion service

may partake in the communion service
well<00:04:09.860> the<00:04:09.980> Bible<00:04:10.340> is<00:04:10.430> really<00:04:10.790> quite<00:04:11.060> clear

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
that if you eat of the bread and you

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.830 
that if you eat of the bread and you
haven't<00:04:14.780> made<00:04:15.140> right<00:04:15.470> with<00:04:15.739> your<00:04:15.920> brother
