and so wherever you stick it down is
where<00:04:01.819> it's<00:04:02.060> going<00:04:02.329> to<00:04:02.389> be<00:04:02.509> so<00:04:03.319> we're<00:04:03.439> just

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
where it's going to be so we're just

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:09.179 
where it's going to be so we're just
going<00:04:03.680> to<00:04:03.769> barely<00:04:04.459> fold<00:04:04.909> it<00:04:05.030> over<00:04:05.859> like<00:04:06.859> so<00:04:07.250> and

00:04:09.179 --> 00:04:09.189 
going to barely fold it over like so and

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:12.759 
going to barely fold it over like so and
I'm<00:04:10.189> going<00:04:10.340> to<00:04:10.370> gently<00:04:10.699> roll<00:04:11.180> this<00:04:11.449> up<00:04:11.769> trying

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:12.769 
I'm going to gently roll this up trying

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:14.469 
I'm going to gently roll this up trying
to<00:04:12.889> get<00:04:13.040> it<00:04:13.159> as<00:04:13.370> tight<00:04:13.400> or<00:04:14.060> keep<00:04:14.239> it<00:04:14.359> as<00:04:14.419> tight

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:14.479 
to get it as tight or keep it as tight

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:19.270 
to get it as tight or keep it as tight
as<00:04:14.989> I<00:04:15.139> possibly<00:04:15.560> can<00:04:16.539> while<00:04:17.539> I<00:04:17.599> roll<00:04:18.019> it<00:04:18.169> up<00:04:18.349> I'm

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
as I possibly can while I roll it up I'm

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.550 
as I possibly can while I roll it up I'm
going<00:04:19.519> to<00:04:20.470> pick<00:04:21.470> this<00:04:21.709> roll<00:04:22.070> up<00:04:22.280> get<00:04:22.699> my<00:04:22.849> pan

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
going to pick this roll up get my pan

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.210 
going to pick this roll up get my pan
out<00:04:24.560> of<00:04:24.830> the<00:04:24.979> way

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:28.800 

going<00:04:27.430> to<00:04:27.580> set<00:04:27.880> this<00:04:28.000> down<00:04:28.060> on<00:04:28.420> my<00:04:28.570> cutting

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
going to set this down on my cutting

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:34.050 
going to set this down on my cutting
board<00:04:29.640> and<00:04:31.350> hopefully<00:04:32.670> it<00:04:33.670> will<00:04:33.820> stay

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
board and hopefully it will stay

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.660 
board and hopefully it will stay
together<00:04:34.440> alright<00:04:35.440> now<00:04:35.680> to<00:04:35.740> cut<00:04:36.130> these<00:04:36.310> I've

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:36.670 
together alright now to cut these I've

together alright now to cut these I've
got<00:04:36.820> some<00:04:37.090> monofilament<00:04:37.540> here<00:04:38.170> I<00:04:38.290> don't<00:04:38.440> know

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
got some monofilament here I don't know

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.680 
got some monofilament here I don't know
how<00:04:38.650> well<00:04:38.830> you<00:04:38.950> can<00:04:39.040> see<00:04:39.100> that<00:04:39.450> you<00:04:40.450> can<00:04:40.570> also

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 
how well you can see that you can also

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.510 
how well you can see that you can also
use<00:04:40.900> selling<00:04:41.260> bread<00:04:41.500> or<00:04:41.680> whatever<00:04:41.980> else<00:04:42.400> you

use selling bread or whatever else you
have<00:04:42.550> to<00:04:42.940> cut<00:04:43.750> this<00:04:43.900> anyway<00:04:44.230> I'm<00:04:44.410> just<00:04:44.590> going

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
have to cut this anyway I'm just going

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.670 
have to cut this anyway I'm just going
to<00:04:44.740> slide<00:04:45.040> it<00:04:45.190> under<00:04:45.460> here<00:04:46.260> about<00:04:47.260> an<00:04:47.380> inch

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
to slide it under here about an inch

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.050 
to slide it under here about an inch
from<00:04:48.070> the<00:04:48.250> end<00:04:48.400> because<00:04:48.730> I'm<00:04:48.790> going<00:04:48.910> to<00:04:48.970> do

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
from the end because I'm going to do

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.750 
from the end because I'm going to do
these<00:04:49.210> in<00:04:49.600> 1<00:04:50.230> inch<00:04:50.410> slices<00:04:50.710> you're<00:04:51.550> going<00:04:51.700> to

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:51.760 
these in 1 inch slices you're going to

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.520 
these in 1 inch slices you're going to
take<00:04:51.850> the<00:04:52.000> ends<00:04:52.330> and<00:04:52.450> fold<00:04:52.750> them<00:04:52.870> over<00:04:53.050> and

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
take the ends and fold them over and

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.410 
take the ends and fold them over and
this<00:04:54.070> is<00:04:54.190> just<00:04:54.370> like<00:04:54.490> cutting<00:04:54.730> Simon<00:04:55.150> rolls

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:55.420 
this is just like cutting Simon rolls

00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:01.530 
this is just like cutting Simon rolls
just<00:04:58.620> pull<00:04:59.620> it<00:04:59.740> through<00:05:00.010> and<00:05:00.540> it

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:01.540 
just pull it through and it

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:05.430 
just pull it through and it
automatically<00:05:02.020> cuts<00:05:02.350> for<00:05:02.800> you<00:05:03.480> and<00:05:04.480> there<00:05:05.290> is

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 
automatically cuts for you and there is

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.760 
automatically cuts for you and there is
one<00:05:05.710> of<00:05:05.830> our<00:05:06.010> rolls

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
one of our rolls

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.850 
one of our rolls
slide<00:05:08.770> the<00:05:08.920> monofilament<00:05:09.340> under<00:05:09.730> there<00:05:09.910> again

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
slide the monofilament under there again

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:18.300 
slide the monofilament under there again
twist<00:05:11.860> it<00:05:12.010> over<00:05:12.220> and<00:05:12.430> pull<00:05:14.460> it<00:05:15.460> tight<00:05:17.310> and

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.310 
twist it over and pull it tight and

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:21.180

there<00:05:18.970> is<00:05:19.210> another<00:05:19.720> one<00:05:19.930> and<00:05:20.260> then<00:05:20.950> just<00:05:21.100> go

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:21.190 
there is another one and then just go

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:28.230 
there is another one and then just go
ahead<00:05:21.310> and<00:05:24.480> put<00:05:25.480> these<00:05:25.630> onto<00:05:26.200> a<00:05:26.640> plate<00:05:27.640> here

the rest of the roll until you get all
of<00:05:34.120> your<00:05:34.150> slices<00:05:34.750> done<00:05:35.050> and<00:05:35.710> after<00:05:36.250> you<00:05:36.340> get

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:36.490

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:38.200 
them all cut and put them out on a plate

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.740 
them all cut and put them out on a plate
this<00:05:38.590> is<00:05:38.770> what<00:05:39.010> they<00:05:39.280> look<00:05:39.520> like<00:05:39.550> as<00:05:40.419> you<00:05:40.600> can

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:40.750 
this is what they look like as you can

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:43.280 
this is what they look like as you can
see<00:05:40.900> here<00:05:41.110> this<00:05:41.260> is<00:05:41.320> one<00:05:41.650> that<00:05:42.070> I<00:05:42.100> did

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:43.290 
see here this is one that I did

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:46.500 
see here this is one that I did
following<00:05:44.290> the<00:05:44.380> recipe<00:05:44.770> directly<00:05:45.220> or<00:05:45.510> exactly

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:46.510 
following the recipe directly or exactly

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:47.820 
following the recipe directly or exactly
by<00:05:46.780> using<00:05:46.960> one<00:05:47.229> and<00:05:47.320> a<00:05:47.350> half<00:05:47.470> cups<00:05:47.680> of

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:47.830 
by using one and a half cups of

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:49.650 
by using one and a half cups of
marshmallows<00:05:48.040> and<00:05:48.580> you<00:05:49.270> can<00:05:49.390> see<00:05:49.510> that

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:49.660 
marshmallows and you can see that

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:51.440 
marshmallows and you can see that
marshmallow<00:05:50.080> it<00:05:50.169> layer<00:05:50.320> is<00:05:50.560> really<00:05:50.740> thick<00:05:51.220> I

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:51.450 
marshmallow it layer is really thick I

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:54.180 
marshmallow it layer is really thick I
actually<00:05:52.450> prefer<00:05:52.930> this<00:05:53.110> using<00:05:53.560> one<00:05:53.740> cup<00:05:53.979> of

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:54.190 
actually prefer this using one cup of

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:56.969 
actually prefer this using one cup of
marshmallows<00:05:54.880> so<00:05:55.150> go<00:05:55.840> ahead<00:05:55.930> and<00:05:56.080> just<00:05:56.890> use

00:05:56.969 --> 00:05:56.979 
marshmallows so go ahead and just use

00:05:56.979 --> 00:05:59.430 
marshmallows so go ahead and just use
the<00:05:57.250> one<00:05:57.400> cup<00:05:57.640> it<00:05:58.270> also<00:05:58.479> tastes<00:05:58.870> less<00:05:59.169> like

00:05:59.430 --> 00:05:59.440 
the one cup it also tastes less like

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.850 
the one cup it also tastes less like
baby<00:05:59.680> half<00:05:59.950> spring<00:06:00.250> which<00:06:00.580> is<00:06:00.700> a<00:06:00.729> plus<00:06:01.229> so<00:06:02.229> but

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:02.860 
baby half spring which is a plus so but

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:05.280 
baby half spring which is a plus so but
I<00:06:02.890> still<00:06:03.100> think<00:06:03.310> strawberry<00:06:04.090> or<00:06:04.360> lime<00:06:04.660> even

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:05.290 
I still think strawberry or lime even

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:07.260 
I still think strawberry or lime even
lemon<00:06:05.560> would<00:06:05.680> be<00:06:05.800> better<00:06:06.010> than<00:06:06.340> this<00:06:06.760> orange

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:07.270 
lemon would be better than this orange

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:09.750 
lemon would be better than this orange
really<00:06:08.020> how<00:06:08.260> that<00:06:08.530> is<00:06:08.680> how<00:06:08.800> you<00:06:08.860> make<00:06:09.100> jello

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:09.760 
really how that is how you make jello

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:12.600 
really how that is how you make jello
