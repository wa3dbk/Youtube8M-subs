just a great sort of thing I mean it's

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:21.770 
just a great sort of thing I mean it's
pretty<00:03:20.280> crazy<00:03:20.519> it's<00:03:20.760> really<00:03:20.970> rugged<00:03:21.269> as<00:03:21.540> well

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
pretty crazy it's really rugged as well

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.229 
pretty crazy it's really rugged as well
it<00:03:21.870> can<00:03:21.900> take<00:03:22.290> a<00:03:22.500> bit<00:03:22.709> of<00:03:22.769> hits<00:03:23.100> you<00:03:23.310> know<00:03:24.090> so

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
it can take a bit of hits you know so

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:25.580 
it can take a bit of hits you know so
the<00:03:24.329> whole<00:03:24.450> point<00:03:24.690> of<00:03:24.720> the<00:03:24.810> jumping<00:03:25.139> sumo<00:03:25.319> is

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
the whole point of the jumping sumo is

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.610 
the whole point of the jumping sumo is
this<00:03:25.920> little<00:03:26.220> tail<00:03:27.150> right<00:03:27.420> here<00:03:27.480> retracts<00:03:28.319> in

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
this little tail right here retracts in

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.120 
this little tail right here retracts in
like<00:03:28.920> a<00:03:28.950> spring<00:03:29.430> and<00:03:29.670> then<00:03:30.209> it<00:03:30.420> jumps<00:03:31.010> which<00:03:32.010> I

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
like a spring and then it jumps which I

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.610 
like a spring and then it jumps which I
found<00:03:32.340> really<00:03:32.880> cool<00:03:33.150> really<00:03:33.389> fun<00:03:33.720> as<00:03:33.959> well<00:03:34.230> now

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
found really cool really fun as well now

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.110 
found really cool really fun as well now
so<00:03:34.829> surprised<00:03:35.069> that<00:03:35.099> first<00:03:35.519> because<00:03:35.880> when

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
so surprised that first because when

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.460 
so surprised that first because when
they<00:03:36.269> rolled<00:03:36.540> it<00:03:36.690> off<00:03:36.780> the<00:03:36.900> table<00:03:37.049> I'm<00:03:37.260> like<00:03:37.380> oh

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
they rolled it off the table I'm like oh

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.500 
they rolled it off the table I'm like oh
my<00:03:37.650> god<00:03:37.829> I<00:03:37.859> would<00:03:38.040> never<00:03:38.370> do<00:03:38.609> that<00:03:38.639> but<00:03:39.150> it<00:03:39.359> can

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
my god I would never do that but it can

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.150 
my god I would never do that but it can
take<00:03:39.660> it<00:03:39.870> I<00:03:39.959> mean<00:03:40.109> you've<00:03:40.530> got<00:03:40.680> these<00:03:40.799> rubber

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
take it I mean you've got these rubber

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.729 
take it I mean you've got these rubber
wheels<00:03:42.120> right<00:03:42.419> here<00:03:42.450> depending<00:03:43.380> on<00:03:43.500> what

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
wheels right here depending on what

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:46.370 
wheels right here depending on what
surface<00:03:43.950> you're<00:03:44.280> driving<00:03:45.120> on<00:03:45.299> you<00:03:46.049> may<00:03:46.169> have

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
surface you're driving on you may have

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.589 
surface you're driving on you may have
to<00:03:46.470> change<00:03:46.769> these<00:03:47.069> you<00:03:47.609> know<00:03:47.730> every<00:03:48.329> now<00:03:48.419> and

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:48.599 
to change these you know every now and

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:49.640 
to change these you know every now and
then<00:03:48.660> especially<00:03:49.169> if<00:03:49.230> you're<00:03:49.319> doing<00:03:49.500> it

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
then especially if you're doing it

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.229 
then especially if you're doing it
outdoors<00:03:49.799> a<00:03:50.130> lot<00:03:50.220> as<00:03:50.489> you<00:03:50.700> know<00:03:50.790> they<00:03:50.970> would

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
outdoors a lot as you know they would

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:53.870 
outdoors a lot as you know they would
wheeled<00:03:51.840> away<00:03:52.139> but<00:03:52.680> as<00:03:52.889> well<00:03:53.160> these<00:03:53.579> things

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
wheeled away but as well these things

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.890 
wheeled away but as well these things
right<00:03:54.090> here<00:03:54.950> they<00:03:55.950> go<00:03:56.130> in<00:03:56.459> the<00:03:57.030> wheels<00:03:57.239> so<00:03:57.810> you

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
right here they go in the wheels so you

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.650 
right here they go in the wheels so you
can<00:03:57.959> actually<00:03:58.200> make<00:03:58.530> it<00:03:58.709> a<00:03:58.799> bit<00:03:59.069> more<00:03:59.630> you<00:04:00.630> know

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
can actually make it a bit more you know

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.199 
can actually make it a bit more you know
Swift<00:04:01.650> in<00:04:02.010> turning<00:04:02.549> it's<00:04:02.760> just<00:04:02.940> a<00:04:03.000> lot<00:04:03.180> more

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
Swift in turning it's just a lot more

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.960 
Swift in turning it's just a lot more
easier<00:04:03.900> but<00:04:04.470> if<00:04:04.530> you<00:04:04.590> do<00:04:04.799> want<00:04:05.010> to<00:04:05.069> sort<00:04:05.220> of<00:04:05.310> get

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
easier but if you do want to sort of get

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.000 
easier but if you do want to sort of get
out<00:04:06.180> you<00:04:06.419> can<00:04:06.569> just<00:04:06.599> they<00:04:06.989> soon<00:04:07.230> just<00:04:07.560> pop<00:04:07.829> out

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
out you can just they soon just pop out

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.949 
out you can just they soon just pop out
like<00:04:08.040> so<00:04:08.549> and<00:04:08.790> the<00:04:09.299> off<00:04:09.419> then<00:04:09.569> you've<00:04:09.690> got<00:04:09.840> the

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
like so and the off then you've got the

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:13.099 
like so and the off then you've got the
full<00:04:10.230> force<00:04:10.560> of<00:04:10.650> the<00:04:11.190> jumping<00:04:11.639> sumo<00:04:11.880> again<00:04:12.810> the

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:13.109 
full force of the jumping sumo again the

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:14.839 
full force of the jumping sumo again the
whole<00:04:13.260> point<00:04:13.440> of<00:04:13.560> it<00:04:13.709> is<00:04:13.829> to<00:04:14.130> jump<00:04:14.340> goes<00:04:14.669> pretty

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:14.849 
whole point of it is to jump goes pretty

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:17.599 
whole point of it is to jump goes pretty
fast<00:04:15.180> as<00:04:15.359> well<00:04:15.389> this<00:04:15.690> has<00:04:15.900> does<00:04:16.200> have<00:04:16.440> a<00:04:16.620> built

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
fast as well this has does have a built

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:20.569 
fast as well this has does have a built
in<00:04:17.760> camera<00:04:17.969> as<00:04:18.329> does<00:04:18.989> the<00:04:19.440> rolling<00:04:19.829> spider<00:04:20.070> but

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 
in camera as does the rolling spider but

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:22.290 
in camera as does the rolling spider but
it's<00:04:20.700> only<00:04:20.880> made<00:04:21.299> I<00:04:21.479> mean<00:04:21.630> it's<00:04:21.750> mainly

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
it's only made I mean it's mainly

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.020 
it's only made I mean it's mainly
therefore<00:04:22.900> you<00:04:23.860> know<00:04:23.949> for<00:04:24.129> the<00:04:24.190> stabilization

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
therefore you know for the stabilization

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.659 
therefore you know for the stabilization
of<00:04:25.110> the<00:04:26.110> drone<00:04:26.440> itself<00:04:26.800> where's<00:04:27.099> here<00:04:27.460> you've

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:27.669 
of the drone itself where's here you've

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:31.080 
of the drone itself where's here you've
got<00:04:27.879> I<00:04:28.169> believe<00:04:29.169> it's<00:04:29.379> not<00:04:29.560> HD<00:04:29.949> camera<00:04:30.370> but

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
got I believe it's not HD camera but

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:32.460 
got I believe it's not HD camera but
it's<00:04:31.270> a<00:04:31.360> camera<00:04:31.659> in<00:04:31.750> there<00:04:31.870> which<00:04:32.020> you<00:04:32.050> can<00:04:32.259> use

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
it's a camera in there which you can use

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.189 
it's a camera in there which you can use
to<00:04:32.650> record<00:04:32.860> take<00:04:33.340> photos<00:04:33.699> as<00:04:33.879> well<00:04:34.150> as<00:04:34.389> look<00:04:34.720> as

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:35.199 
to record take photos as well as look as

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:38.219 
to record take photos as well as look as
it<00:04:35.440> goes<00:04:35.680> over<00:04:35.889> Wi-Fi<00:04:36.490> so<00:04:37.479> I<00:04:37.780> mean<00:04:37.990> really

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:38.229 
it goes over Wi-Fi so I mean really

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:39.960 
it goes over Wi-Fi so I mean really
great<00:04:38.440> now<00:04:38.830> what's<00:04:39.009> really<00:04:39.129> cool<00:04:39.340> about<00:04:39.400> the

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970 
great now what's really cool about the

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:41.670 
great now what's really cool about the
rolling<00:04:40.270> Sumer<00:04:40.629> is<00:04:40.840> it<00:04:41.110> has<00:04:41.319> its<00:04:41.500> own

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
rolling Sumer is it has its own

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.219 
rolling Sumer is it has its own
personality<00:04:41.979> as<00:04:42.849> you<00:04:43.150> can<00:04:43.300> hear<00:04:43.780> every<00:04:44.080> time

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:44.229 
personality as you can hear every time

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:45.779 
personality as you can hear every time
you<00:04:44.349> interact<00:04:44.650> to<00:04:44.979> connect<00:04:45.430> it

00:04:45.779 --> 00:04:45.789 
you interact to connect it

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:47.189 
you interact to connect it
it<00:04:45.970> makes<00:04:46.240> all<00:04:46.449> these<00:04:46.569> weird<00:04:46.900> and<00:04:47.050> wacky

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:47.199 
it makes all these weird and wacky

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:49.350 
it makes all these weird and wacky
noises<00:04:47.680> which<00:04:47.860> I<00:04:47.979> found<00:04:48.220> really<00:04:48.669> cool<00:04:48.879> and<00:04:49.300> I

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
noises which I found really cool and I

noises which I found really cool and I
really<00:04:49.659> loved<00:04:49.930> it<00:04:50.110> now<00:04:50.710> also<00:04:51.099> with<00:04:51.759> the<00:04:52.360> you

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:52.690 
really loved it now also with the you

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:54.990 
really loved it now also with the you
know<00:04:52.810> app<00:04:53.139> of<00:04:53.530> the<00:04:53.770> mini<00:04:53.949> drones<00:04:54.340> everything

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 
know app of the mini drones everything

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.820 
know app of the mini drones everything
is<00:04:55.120> all-in-one<00:04:55.659> and<00:04:55.930> what<00:04:56.139> I<00:04:56.169> love<00:04:56.409> about<00:04:56.440> it

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:57.809 
is all-in-one and what I love about it
like<00:04:57.009> the<00:04:57.190> ar.drone
