00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:07.020
 today we are going to prepare yogurt cake and 

00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:10.380
 we will use these ingredients 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.930
 a lemon yogurt 3 eggs a measure 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.420
 of yogurt sunflower oil 2 measures 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:18.000
 of sugar yogurt 3 sizes of yogurt 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.050
 wheat flour a sachet of yeast and 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.050
 a little butter 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:27.500
 We'll start by taking a little 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.180
 butter or margarine and with it in 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.240
 graz do inside a mold 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:34.700
 plum cake you have to try to get right to 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.500
 all the corners since that is where 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.350
 more chances there are that we are 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.820
 I can paste the cake we also throw 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.320
 a little flour 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.450
 we are turning the mold at the same time 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.270
 we tap to spread the 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.010
 is adhered throughout the surface 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:51.080
 when we have the mold well floured 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.050
 we turn it over and remove the excess 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:56.210
 optionally to get better the 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.739
 cake after baking what we can 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.769
 cut out some paper bands 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:03.320
 sulfurized and cross over the mold 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:05.180
 truth is that it is very useful once 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.460
 prepared the mold we preheated the 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.950
 180 degree oven with heat up and 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.290
 down now let's start doing the 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.300
 biscuit dough the first thing we will do 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.540
 will be emptying the lemon yogurt in a 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.430
 container and clean the container well 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.750
 that we will use it as a reference 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.020
 to measure the amounts of the 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.020
 ingredients 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.560
 in a large bowl we throw the three 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.670
 eggs together with two base measures of 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.670
 sugar yogurt 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:43.590
 We beat well with a whisk 

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:43.590
 rods about 3 or 4 minutes 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.600
 when we see that the mixture has doubled 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.270
 the volume and is frothy and whitish 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.310
 we toss the lemon yogurt and then a 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.490
 measure of the yogurt cup of oil of 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.490
 sunflower 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.250
 we keep beating half a minute more to 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.580
 that all the 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.580
 ingredients 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:16.409
 We measured three glasses of flour and 

00:02:14.249 --> 00:02:18.659
 we add to the mix although it's not 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:20.400
 strictly necessary to sift the 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:23.090
 you can do it with a colander 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.090
 fine mesh 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.849
 and now let's add the yeast 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.920
 powder chemistry we mix well until 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:36.730
 that the flour is completely integrated and 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.730
 no lumps left 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.660
 once we have the mass ready the 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.230
 we turn over the mold that we have 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.230
 prepared 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.620
 we tap the mold on 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.510
 the table for the dough to settle 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.300
 completely and also to remove 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:04.060
 some bubbles that may remain 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:06.670
 with the oven preheated to 180 degrees 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.350
 we put it halfway up although the 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.440
 Baking times depend on each 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:15.310
 we will have it ready after 30 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:17.770
 or 35 minutes once this time has passed 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.750
 and look like this we check if it's 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:22.030
 made by sticking a wooden skewer 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.920
 long in the center if it comes out dry 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.800
 means that we can get it out of the 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.650
 oven 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:31.320
 we let it cool before unmolding and 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:34.230
 ready with the paper strips that we put 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:36.600
 It is very comfortable to take out a dish like 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:39.390
 you have seen is a cake really 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.520
 easy to make is one of those candies that 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.710
 all of our grandmothers and mothers have 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.960
 in his cookbook and that they go from 

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:47.850
 generation in generation at home what 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:50.010
 we do a lot for breakfast and for 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.780
 take in the afternoon with coffee but 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.060
 we also prepare it sometimes for 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:57.540
 use as a base for pies cakes and 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:59.430
 other sweets so you know if you never 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.850
 you have tried it we encourage you to what 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:07.070
 do not regret you see you in
