00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.130 
on baby it's your time to fly today you

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.170 
on baby it's your time to fly today you
can<00:00:25.310> see<00:00:25.520> batteries<00:00:26.270> are<00:00:26.450> here<00:00:26.780> and<00:00:26.930> my<00:00:27.530> dx7

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:28.180 
can see batteries are here and my dx7

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.619 
can see batteries are here and my dx7
also<00:00:29.180> rests<00:00:29.660> very<00:00:29.840> well<00:00:30.290> inside<00:00:31.090> I<00:00:32.090> had<00:00:32.390> to

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:32.629 
also rests very well inside I had to

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:38.049 
also rests very well inside I had to
walk<00:00:33.260> tight<00:00:33.559> a<00:00:33.860> lot<00:00:34.340> of<00:00:34.489> screws<00:00:34.899> actually<00:00:37.059> in

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:38.059 
walk tight a lot of screws actually in

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:40.150 
walk tight a lot of screws actually in
the<00:00:38.210> beginning<00:00:38.660> the<00:00:38.899> helicopter<00:00:39.499> needed<00:00:40.039> a

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160 
the beginning the helicopter needed a

00:00:40.160 --> 00:03:56.700 
the beginning the helicopter needed a
lot<00:00:40.339> of

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:56.710 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:59.530 

after<00:03:57.710> trying<00:03:57.950> two<00:03:58.280> different<00:03:58.700> gyros<00:03:59.090> on<00:03:59.300> one

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
after trying two different gyros on one

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.740 
after trying two different gyros on one
battery<00:04:00.020> I<00:04:00.860> can<00:04:01.459> easily<00:04:01.880> conclude<00:04:02.090> that

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
battery I can easily conclude that

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.710 
battery I can easily conclude that
battery<00:04:03.740> time<00:04:03.980> flight<00:04:04.700> time<00:04:04.940> is<00:04:05.120> really<00:04:05.420> nice

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
battery time flight time is really nice

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.830 
battery time flight time is really nice
on<00:04:06.020> one<00:04:06.290> battery<00:04:06.709> I<00:04:06.970> still<00:04:07.970> need<00:04:08.120> to<00:04:08.300> set<00:04:08.660> up

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
on one battery I still need to set up

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.470 
on one battery I still need to set up
the<00:04:09.410> swash<00:04:09.650> plate<00:04:09.860> sub<00:04:10.400> trims<00:04:10.760> a<00:04:11.030> little<00:04:11.330> bit

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
the swash plate sub trims a little bit

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:12.760 
the swash plate sub trims a little bit
because<00:04:11.660> when<00:04:11.959> going<00:04:12.170> forward<00:04:12.590> flight

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:12.770 
because when going forward flight

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:16.120 
because when going forward flight
helicopter<00:04:13.340> climbs<00:04:14.000> up<00:04:14.209> nose<00:04:14.480> up<00:04:14.720> that<00:04:15.590> that

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
helicopter climbs up nose up that that

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:17.920 
helicopter climbs up nose up that that
is<00:04:16.250> some<00:04:16.430> elevator<00:04:16.820> setup<00:04:17.209> I<00:04:17.299> need<00:04:17.480> to<00:04:17.600> do

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
is some elevator setup I need to do

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.470 
is some elevator setup I need to do
apart<00:04:18.380> from<00:04:18.530> this<00:04:18.829> helicopter<00:04:19.310> is<00:04:19.519> like<00:04:19.940> I<00:04:20.209> can

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:20.480 
apart from this helicopter is like I can

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.810 
apart from this helicopter is like I can
say<00:04:20.720> it's<00:04:20.930> a<00:04:21.019> very<00:04:21.230> good<00:04:21.410> helicopter<00:04:21.980> but<00:04:22.520> we

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
say it's a very good helicopter but we

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.000 
say it's a very good helicopter but we
are<00:04:23.060> having<00:04:23.270> trouble<00:04:23.540> with<00:04:23.780> the<00:04:24.020> gyros<00:04:24.440> kts

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
are having trouble with the gyros kts

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.970 
are having trouble with the gyros kts
800<00:04:25.520> and<00:04:25.730> our<00:04:25.940> tech<00:04:26.150> v3<00:04:26.570> stock<00:04:26.840> gyro<00:04:27.169> it's

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:27.980 
800 and our tech v3 stock gyro it's

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:30.190 
800 and our tech v3 stock gyro it's
totally<00:04:28.610> no<00:04:28.910> no<00:04:29.090> on<00:04:29.300> this<00:04:29.480> one<00:04:29.720> it's<00:04:29.930> not

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.200 
totally no no on this one it's not

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.650 
totally no no on this one it's not
working<00:04:30.830> for<00:04:31.010> any<00:04:31.190> kind<00:04:31.460> of<00:04:31.550> treaty<00:04:31.820> I<00:04:32.060> can<00:04:32.480> do

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
working for any kind of treaty I can do

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.020 
working for any kind of treaty I can do
a<00:04:32.690> good<00:04:33.080> flight<00:04:33.440> like<00:04:33.770> normal<00:04:34.100> flight<00:04:34.370> but<00:04:34.640> 3d

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
a good flight like normal flight but 3d

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.900 
a good flight like normal flight but 3d
is<00:04:35.210> not<00:04:35.480> possible<00:04:36.230> at<00:04:36.410> the<00:04:36.530> moment<00:04:36.830> so<00:04:37.250> we<00:04:37.730> will

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:37.910 
is not possible at the moment so we will

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.900 
is not possible at the moment so we will
go<00:04:38.690> home<00:04:38.900> and<00:04:38.960> give<00:04:39.530> it<00:04:39.560> a<00:04:39.710> new<00:04:39.890> gyro<00:04:40.400> and<00:04:40.760> we

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 
go home and give it a new gyro and we

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:42.580 
go home and give it a new gyro and we
will<00:04:41.060> come<00:04:41.240> back<00:04:41.270> and<00:04:41.630> give<00:04:41.870> it<00:04:41.900> one<00:04:42.020> more<00:04:42.380> try

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
will come back and give it one more try

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:44.440 
will come back and give it one more try
and<00:04:42.890> see<00:04:43.100> how<00:04:43.250> behave<00:04:43.610> how<00:04:44.000> it<00:04:44.150> will<00:04:44.300> behave

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:44.450 
and see how behave how it will behave

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:46.540 
and see how behave how it will behave
