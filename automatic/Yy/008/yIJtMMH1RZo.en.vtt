 sort of tasting note we're going to 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.780
 take an Augustinian each 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.820
 and we will try doneness 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.290
 shrimp does not have to be gummy not 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.610
 has to offer a lot of resistance and 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.200
 when it is well cooked, some must 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.150
 to be crispy is a way to 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.030
 say it but like the teeth have 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:27.410
 a little initial resistance and then no 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:30.440
 has everything ordinary that moon does not 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.950
 feel the taste its use the juice a 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.950

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.069
 shrimp that I like is great there 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.560

 so here we have shrimp and point 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.800

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.090
