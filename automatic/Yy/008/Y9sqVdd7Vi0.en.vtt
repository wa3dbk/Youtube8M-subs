HD two thousand now for those of you
that<00:00:25.439> don't<00:00:25.560> know<00:00:25.679> this<00:00:25.980> is<00:00:26.130> a<00:00:26.220> camera

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
that don't know this is a camera

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.839 
that don't know this is a camera
stabilizer<00:00:27.359> you<00:00:27.749> said<00:00:28.019> your<00:00:28.619> your<00:00:28.650> DSLR<00:00:29.550> or

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
stabilizer you said your your DSLR or

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.479 
stabilizer you said your your DSLR or
your<00:00:30.210> video<00:00:30.599> camera<00:00:30.869> I'm<00:00:31.650> directly<00:00:32.220> on<00:00:32.400> the

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
your video camera I'm directly on the

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.849 
your video camera I'm directly on the
top<00:00:32.669> of<00:00:32.700> this<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.420> once<00:00:34.050> you<00:00:34.170> balance<00:00:34.620> it<00:00:34.739> out

00:00:34.849 --> 00:00:34.859 
top of this and once you balance it out

00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:37.430 
top of this and once you balance it out
it<00:00:35.520> will<00:00:35.609> stay<00:00:35.850> straight<00:00:36.210> you<00:00:36.420> can<00:00:36.600> run<00:00:36.840> jiggle

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
it will stay straight you can run jiggle

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.290 
it will stay straight you can run jiggle
around<00:00:37.530> with<00:00:37.920> it<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:38.219> essentially<00:00:39.000> you're

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
around with it and essentially you're

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.540 
around with it and essentially you're
going<00:00:39.449> to<00:00:39.510> get<00:00:39.660> no<00:00:40.289> wobble<00:00:40.769> once<00:00:41.250> you<00:00:41.430> learn

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
going to get no wobble once you learn

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.360 
going to get no wobble once you learn
how<00:00:41.579> to<00:00:41.730> use<00:00:41.850> it<00:00:42.149> now<00:00:42.870> as<00:00:43.140> far<00:00:43.440> as<00:00:43.739> how<00:00:44.100> this

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
how to use it now as far as how this

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.340 
how to use it now as far as how this
thing<00:00:44.640> works<00:00:44.899> it<00:00:45.899> does<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:46.530> very<00:00:46.920> good<00:00:47.399> job<00:00:48.350> and

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
thing works it does a very good job and

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.410 
thing works it does a very good job and
that<00:00:49.559> is<00:00:49.739> sort<00:00:50.010> of<00:00:50.039> subjective<00:00:50.609> also<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.149> where

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
that is sort of subjective also to where

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.180 
that is sort of subjective also to where
you<00:00:51.539> are<00:00:51.750> I've<00:00:52.410> noticed<00:00:52.679> that<00:00:52.890> if<00:00:53.070> you're

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
you are I've noticed that if you're

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.700 
you are I've noticed that if you're
indoors<00:00:53.750> it's<00:00:54.750> kind<00:00:54.989> of<00:00:55.050> hard<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.320> use<00:00:55.530> it

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
indoors it's kind of hard to use it

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.950 
indoors it's kind of hard to use it
because<00:00:55.829> in<00:00:56.339> order<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.149> use<00:00:57.359> this<00:00:57.539> you<00:00:57.719> can't

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
because in order to use this you can't

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.329 
because in order to use this you can't
be<00:00:58.079> touching<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.530> camera<00:00:58.920> a<00:00:58.980> whole<00:00:59.190> lot

00:00:59.329 --> 00:00:59.339 
be touching the camera a whole lot

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:01.430 
be touching the camera a whole lot
therefore<00:01:00.300> you<00:01:00.390> can't<00:01:00.600> be<00:01:00.690> adjusting<00:01:01.199> your

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
therefore you can't be adjusting your

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.549 
therefore you can't be adjusting your
manual<00:01:01.980> focus<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.579> whatnot<00:01:02.850> so<00:01:03.030> if<00:01:03.559> you're

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
manual focus and whatnot so if you're

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.170 
manual focus and whatnot so if you're
indoors<00:01:04.980> you're<00:01:05.280> probably<00:01:05.579> going<00:01:05.939> to<00:01:06.030> have<00:01:06.119> to

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
indoors you're probably going to have to

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.810 
indoors you're probably going to have to
have<00:01:06.509> it<00:01:06.659> on<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:07.170> lower<00:01:07.680> f-stop<00:01:08.280> due<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.700> the

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
have it on a lower f-stop due to the

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.600 
have it on a lower f-stop due to the
lighting<00:01:09.150> situation<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:10.310> for<00:01:11.310> those<00:01:11.400> of<00:01:11.460> you

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
lighting situation and for those of you

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.280 
lighting situation and for those of you
that<00:01:11.759> know<00:01:11.820> DSLR<00:01:12.509> you<00:01:12.689> would<00:01:12.780> know<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.079> lower

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
that know DSLR you would know the lower

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.740 
that know DSLR you would know the lower
f-stop<00:01:13.799> means<00:01:14.130> that<00:01:14.880> more<00:01:15.150> stuff<00:01:15.390> is<00:01:15.540> going<00:01:15.659> to

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
f-stop means that more stuff is going to

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.590 
f-stop means that more stuff is going to
be<00:01:15.840> out<00:01:15.960> of<00:01:15.990> focus<00:01:16.229> so<00:01:16.850> therefore<00:01:17.850> it's<00:01:18.149> a<00:01:18.240> lot

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
be out of focus so therefore it's a lot

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.899 
be out of focus so therefore it's a lot
easier<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:19.020> use<00:01:19.259> it<00:01:19.500> in<00:01:19.680> well-lit<00:01:20.340> lighting

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
easier to use it in well-lit lighting

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.580 
easier to use it in well-lit lighting
situations<00:01:21.509> because<00:01:21.840> you<00:01:21.960> can<00:01:22.110> put<00:01:22.350> it<00:01:22.439> at<00:01:22.560> a

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
situations because you can put it at a

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.100 
situations because you can put it at a
higher<00:01:22.829> f-stop<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:24.509> everything<00:01:24.930> is<00:01:25.020> over

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
higher f-stop and and everything is over

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.569 
higher f-stop and and everything is over
being<00:01:25.320> focused<00:01:25.740> that<00:01:25.860> way<00:01:25.979> you<00:01:26.070> can<00:01:26.220> just<00:01:26.250> sort

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:26.579 
being focused that way you can just sort

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:28.280 
being focused that way you can just sort
of<00:01:26.670> glide<00:01:26.880> with<00:01:26.939> it<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:27.930> you<00:01:28.020> don't<00:01:28.140> really

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
of glide with it and you don't really

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.929 
of glide with it and you don't really
have<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.560> worry<00:01:28.710> about<00:01:29.189> you<00:01:29.549> know<00:01:29.610> touching

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
have to worry about you know touching

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.990 
have to worry about you know touching
your<00:01:30.149> camera<00:01:31.009> because<00:01:32.009> definitely<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.670> begin

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
your camera because definitely to begin

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.730 
your camera because definitely to begin
with<00:01:33.180> I<00:01:33.509> wouldn't<00:01:34.140> know<00:01:34.259> because<00:01:34.409> I<00:01:34.560> haven't

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
with I wouldn't know because I haven't

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.530 
with I wouldn't know because I haven't
used<00:01:35.100> this<00:01:35.250> for<00:01:35.520> you<00:01:35.790> know<00:01:35.939> for<00:01:36.180> a<00:01:36.210> few<00:01:36.390> months

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
used this for you know for a few months

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.880 
used this for you know for a few months
whatever<00:01:36.780> I've<00:01:37.079> only<00:01:37.229> had<00:01:37.380> it<00:01:37.439> for<00:01:37.560> a<00:01:37.710> few<00:01:37.740> days

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
whatever I've only had it for a few days

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.910 
whatever I've only had it for a few days
so<00:01:38.810> but<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:39.930> begin<00:01:40.200> with<00:01:40.380> from<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.649> beginner

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
so but to begin with from a beginner

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.910 
so but to begin with from a beginner
standpoint<00:01:41.990> you<00:01:42.990> know<00:01:43.020> it<00:01:43.229> gets<00:01:43.380> fairly

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
standpoint you know it gets fairly

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.410 
standpoint you know it gets fairly
difficult<00:01:44.219> to<00:01:44.549> touch<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.880> camera<00:01:45.090> while

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
difficult to touch the camera while

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.569 
difficult to touch the camera while
you're<00:01:45.630> operating<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:46.649> glidecam<00:01:47.100> just

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
you're operating the glidecam just

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.690 
you're operating the glidecam just
because<00:01:47.880> of<00:01:48.229> how<00:01:49.229> it<00:01:49.320> works<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:49.799> how<00:01:49.860> gentle

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
because of how it works and how gentle

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.330 
because of how it works and how gentle
you<00:01:50.729> have<00:01:50.969> to<00:01:51.090> be<00:01:51.270> with<00:01:52.020> it<00:01:52.170> now<00:01:52.890> as<00:01:53.039> far<00:01:53.189> as

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
side you just turn those and it moves it

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.590 
side you just turn those and it moves it
millimeters<00:04:04.700> so<00:04:04.910> you<00:04:04.970> can<00:04:05.209> move<00:04:05.300> your<00:04:05.360> camera

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
to do with no camera on it but if I move

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:32.650 
to do with no camera on it but if I move
my<00:04:31.550> hand<00:04:31.820> around<00:04:31.940> a<00:04:32.180> little<00:04:32.330> bit<00:04:32.479> you'll

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
my hand around a little bit you'll

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.130 
my hand around a little bit you'll
notice<00:04:32.960> that<00:04:32.990> the<00:04:33.650> top<00:04:33.919> is<00:04:34.190> staying<00:04:34.460> pretty

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:35.140 
notice that the top is staying pretty

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.260 
notice that the top is staying pretty
pretty<00:04:36.140> flat<00:04:36.500> pretty<00:04:36.740> solid<00:04:37.010> and<00:04:37.370> that's<00:04:38.030> kind

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
pretty flat pretty solid and that's kind

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150 
am right now at the top where the camera

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:45.640 
am right now at the top where the camera
would<00:04:44.270> be<00:04:44.419> of<00:04:44.600> course<00:04:44.630> it's<00:04:45.110> going<00:04:45.200> to<00:04:45.350> do<00:04:45.440> even

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
would be of course it's going to do even

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:46.870 
would be of course it's going to do even
better<00:04:45.740> with<00:04:45.979> more<00:04:46.130> weight<00:04:46.340> on<00:04:46.520> it<00:04:46.700> because

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 
better with more weight on it because

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.180 
better with more weight on it because
that's<00:04:47.090> how<00:04:47.180> these<00:04:47.360> things<00:04:47.390> work<00:04:47.810> but<00:04:48.190> where

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 
that's how these things work but where

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:50.440 
that's how these things work but where
the<00:04:49.250> camera<00:04:49.520> would<00:04:49.610> be<00:04:49.789> it'd<00:04:49.970> be<00:04:50.180> staying

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:50.450 
the camera would be it'd be staying

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:52.630 
the camera would be it'd be staying
totally<00:04:50.720> still<00:04:51.140> and<00:04:51.410> so<00:04:51.770> that<00:04:51.979> that's<00:04:52.280> why

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:52.640 
totally still and so that that's why

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.560 
totally still and so that that's why
this<00:04:52.700> thing<00:04:53.090> works<00:04:53.300> so<00:04:53.510> well<00:04:55.180> moving<00:04:56.180> on<00:04:56.360> down

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 
this thing works so well moving on down

on<00:05:09.470> there<00:05:09.620> whatever<00:05:09.800> this<00:05:10.039> is<00:05:10.280> like<00:05:10.970> a<00:05:11.000> powder

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330 
on there whatever this is like a powder

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.250 
on there whatever this is like a powder
coated<00:05:11.690> paint<00:05:11.930> and<00:05:12.169> it<00:05:12.590> looks<00:05:12.770> really<00:05:12.860> nice

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:14.260 
coated paint and it looks really nice

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.969 
coated paint and it looks really nice
moving<00:05:15.260> down<00:05:15.380> here<00:05:15.410> a<00:05:16.060> glidecam<00:05:17.060> uses<00:05:17.510> a

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:17.979 
moving down here a glidecam uses a

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:21.340 
moving down here a glidecam uses a
mixture<00:05:18.979> of<00:05:19.220> leverage<00:05:19.970> and<00:05:20.180> wait<00:05:20.479> to<00:05:21.050> balance

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:21.350 
mixture of leverage and wait to balance

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:23.529 
mixture of leverage and wait to balance
the<00:05:21.470> camera<00:05:21.830> so<00:05:22.240> whenever<00:05:23.240> you<00:05:23.300> put<00:05:23.419> your

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:23.539 
the camera so whenever you put your

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:25.140 
the camera so whenever you put your
camera<00:05:23.810> on<00:05:23.870> top<00:05:24.110> you're<00:05:24.500> gonna<00:05:24.620> either<00:05:24.800> put

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.150 
camera on top you're gonna either put

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.510 
camera on top you're gonna either put
more<00:05:26.150> weight<00:05:26.300> down<00:05:26.479> here<00:05:26.840> which<00:05:27.520> they've

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:28.520 
more weight down here which they've

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.480 
more weight down here which they've
given<00:05:28.820> you<00:05:29.120> a<00:05:29.390> lot<00:05:30.169> of<00:05:30.229> the<00:05:30.710> zero<00:05:30.950> weight<00:05:31.280> so

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:31.490 
given you a lot of the zero weight so

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:33.400 
given you a lot of the zero weight so
you<00:05:31.550> can<00:05:31.760> attach<00:05:32.300> the<00:05:32.570> bottom<00:05:32.870> of<00:05:33.050> it<00:05:33.169> this<00:05:33.350> is

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:33.410 
you can attach the bottom of it this is

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:37.390 
you can attach the bottom of it this is
like<00:05:33.620> 10<00:05:33.800> pounds<00:05:35.289> or<00:05:36.289> if<00:05:36.919> you<00:05:37.130> want<00:05:37.250> to<00:05:37.310> make

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:37.400 
like 10 pounds or if you want to make

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:38.529 
like 10 pounds or if you want to make
finer<00:05:37.640> adjustment<00:05:38.090> you're<00:05:38.180> gonna<00:05:38.270> put<00:05:38.450> the

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:38.539 
finer adjustment you're gonna put the

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:39.820 
finer adjustment you're gonna put the
weight<00:05:38.690> down<00:05:38.720> here<00:05:39.110> and<00:05:39.289> let's<00:05:39.349> say<00:05:39.560> it's<00:05:39.680> not

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:39.830 
weight down here and let's say it's not

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:41.770 
weight down here and let's say it's not
perfectly<00:05:40.130> balanced<00:05:40.490> you<00:05:41.060> can<00:05:41.210> adjust<00:05:41.330> this

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:41.780 
perfectly balanced you can adjust this

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:44.140 
perfectly balanced you can adjust this
down<00:05:42.080> giving<00:05:42.470> it<00:05:42.680> more<00:05:42.830> leverage<00:05:43.250> on<00:05:43.880> a<00:05:43.970> very

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:44.150 
down giving it more leverage on a very

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:47.110 
down giving it more leverage on a very
fine<00:05:44.419> level<00:05:44.750> and<00:05:45.140> get<00:05:45.890> that<00:05:46.099> perfect<00:05:46.400> that

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.120 
fine level and get that perfect that

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.820 
fine level and get that perfect that
perfect<00:05:47.150> balance<00:05:47.810> that<00:05:48.200> you're<00:05:48.320> looking<00:05:48.620> for

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:48.830 
perfect balance that you're looking for

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:50.500 
perfect balance that you're looking for
so<00:05:49.460> that's<00:05:49.700> where<00:05:49.880> you<00:05:49.940> would<00:05:50.030> adjust<00:05:50.150> that

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:50.510 
so that's where you would adjust that

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:54.219 
so that's where you would adjust that
right<00:05:50.960> there<00:05:51.580> and<00:05:52.599> like<00:05:53.599> I<00:05:53.720> said<00:05:53.780> you<00:05:54.110> would

00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:54.229 
right there and like I said you would

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:56.440 
right there and like I said you would
add<00:05:54.380> your<00:05:54.590> weights<00:05:54.830> here<00:05:55.729> to<00:05:55.849> the<00:05:55.940> bottom<00:05:56.270> and

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:56.450 
add your weights here to the bottom and

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:57.760 
add your weights here to the bottom and
they've<00:05:57.200> done<00:05:57.320> a<00:05:57.380> pretty<00:05:57.560> good<00:05:57.650> job

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:57.770 
they've done a pretty good job

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:59.589 
they've done a pretty good job
engineering<00:05:58.490> that<00:05:58.700> like<00:05:59.000> it<00:05:59.150> should<00:05:59.330> be<00:05:59.360> done

00:05:59.589 --> 00:05:59.599 
engineering that like it should be done

00:05:59.599 --> 00:06:02.260 
engineering that like it should be done
you<00:05:59.750> can<00:05:59.870> move<00:06:00.020> this<00:06:00.169> around<00:06:00.320> and<00:06:01.270> really

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:02.270 
you can move this around and really

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:04.210 
you can move this around and really
there's<00:06:02.450> there's<00:06:02.750> a<00:06:02.810> lot<00:06:03.020> of<00:06:03.050> changes<00:06:03.950> you<00:06:04.070> can

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:04.220 
there's there's a lot of changes you can

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:06.070 
there's there's a lot of changes you can
make<00:06:04.280> to<00:06:04.610> each<00:06:04.760> individual<00:06:05.360> piece<00:06:05.599> of<00:06:05.900> the

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:06.080 
make to each individual piece of the

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.339 
make to each individual piece of the
glidecam<00:06:07.300> now<00:06:08.300> with<00:06:08.450> all<00:06:08.570> that<00:06:08.690> being<00:06:08.810> said<00:06:08.930> I

00:06:09.339 --> 00:06:09.349 
glidecam now with all that being said I

00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:11.460 
glidecam now with all that being said I
am<00:06:09.890> having<00:06:10.220> a<00:06:10.430> lot<00:06:10.610> of<00:06:10.640> fun<00:06:10.849> with<00:06:10.970> this<00:06:11.090> thing

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:11.470 
am having a lot of fun with this thing

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:14.680 
am having a lot of fun with this thing
like<00:06:12.470> I<00:06:12.500> said<00:06:12.740> my<00:06:12.919> my<00:06:13.310> honestly<00:06:14.060> my<00:06:14.360> thoughts

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:14.690 
like I said my my honestly my thoughts

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:16.630 
like I said my my honestly my thoughts
on<00:06:14.900> it<00:06:15.020> I<00:06:15.110> give<00:06:15.320> it<00:06:15.410> like<00:06:15.440> a<00:06:15.620> 5<00:06:15.890> out<00:06:16.070> of<00:06:16.099> 5<00:06:16.190> stars

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:16.640 
on it I give it like a 5 out of 5 stars

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:19.360 
on it I give it like a 5 out of 5 stars
it<00:06:16.940> does<00:06:17.150> a<00:06:17.300> perfect<00:06:17.780> job<00:06:18.130> it's<00:06:19.130> really

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:19.370 
it does a perfect job it's really

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:22.180 
it does a perfect job it's really
durable<00:06:19.580> because<00:06:20.180> I<00:06:20.680> sometimes<00:06:21.680> you<00:06:21.830> know<00:06:21.919> you

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:22.190

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:23.780 
going so you can just throw this thing

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:25.840 
going so you can just throw this thing
in<00:06:23.900> your<00:06:23.990> bag<00:06:24.280> cram<00:06:25.280> it<00:06:25.310> in<00:06:25.460> there<00:06:25.580> with<00:06:25.730> your

tripod your cameras and whatnot and then

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:29.230 
tripod your cameras and whatnot and then
you'll<00:06:27.860> be<00:06:28.040> good<00:06:28.160> to<00:06:28.220> go<00:06:28.340> you<00:06:28.910> don't<00:06:29.060> have<00:06:29.180> to
