your route can one hand be exciting but
hitting<00:01:02.370> climb<00:01:02.820> after<00:01:03.000> climb<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.629> not

hitting climb after climb and not
knowing<00:01:03.930> what<00:01:04.110> lays<00:01:04.320> ahead<00:01:04.350> can<00:01:05.100> also<00:01:05.369> be

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
knowing what lays ahead can also be

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:06.859
