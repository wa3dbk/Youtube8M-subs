you<00:02:44.640> should<00:02:44.819> definitely<00:02:45.000> think<00:02:45.180> about<00:02:45.390> making

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
you should definitely think about making

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.900 
you should definitely think about making
some<00:02:46.049> soup

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.960 

a<00:02:54.890> little<00:02:55.890> bit<00:02:55.980> of<00:02:56.010> steamed<00:02:56.340> broccoli<00:02:56.640> that<00:02:56.820> I

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
a little bit of steamed broccoli that I

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.630 
a little bit of steamed broccoli that I
had<00:02:57.180> left<00:02:57.390> over<00:02:57.600> in<00:02:57.690> the<00:02:57.720> fridge<00:02:57.990> and<00:02:58.640> I

had left over in the fridge and I

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.640 
had left over in the fridge and I
probably<00:03:00.120> could<00:03:00.420> have<00:03:00.450> gotten<00:03:01.260> the<00:03:01.410> soup

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
probably could have gotten the soup

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.100 
probably could have gotten the soup
creamier<00:03:02.160> if<00:03:02.700> I<00:03:02.850> blended<00:03:03.180> it<00:03:03.300> longer<00:03:03.690> but<00:03:03.720> I

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
creamier if I blended it longer but I

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.170 
creamier if I blended it longer but I
tasted<00:03:04.980> it<00:03:05.100> and<00:03:05.280> I'm<00:03:05.370> like<00:03:05.430> I<00:03:05.730> like<00:03:05.970> it<00:03:06.090> like

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
tasted it and I'm like I like it like

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.370 
tasted it and I'm like I like it like
