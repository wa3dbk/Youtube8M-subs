00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.530
 hello youtube friends in this new 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.020
 video I will show you how to fix your 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:18.290
 samsung cellphone from a trunk this 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:20.300
 occurs for the vast majority of times and 

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:22.970
 we make the rodeos with tutorial videos 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.460
 of youtube and then they give us the matches 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.980
 bad things that are irregular to us are left with 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:31.730
 bad configurations like bluetooth 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:34.309
 with asier it turns on and off alone and the 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:37.940
 camera serves us or etcetera in this 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:42.140
 video I will do the tutorial with an s4 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:46.000
 as you can see for this tutorial 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:49.609
 so we will need a program called 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.399
 jodi that is the sand book 

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:55.579
 description of the video and download it 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:59.149
 unzip and a folder will come out 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:01.090
 equal to mine well and they give you application 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:04.000
 they give you yes 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:07.720
 and then this picture will come out before 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:11.950
 this will need the software of the 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:14.500
 cell will also leave the page where 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:18.340
 you can find the software the firmware 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:23.260
 from samsung cell phone because how is this 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:26.410
 a model ds4 and 9500 then they can 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:30.520
 download any of these versions 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:32.550
 from here I give you download and as you can see 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.580
 Well, now 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:38.070
 is downloading and how I have it 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.570
 downloaded then canceled it whose 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.420
 Downloads folder 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.520
 how can you see this here what something 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:49.060
 decompress will leave a file equal to 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:53.200
 this to proceed to proceed with the 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:56.010
 cell rule we turn it off we turn off 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.010
 the cell phone 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.719
 mobile 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:06.719
 we hope it goes out 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.950
 on the cell phone 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:19.300
 until it shuts down completely 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.300
 we wait 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:33.150
 once our cell phone is turned off 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:35.720
 well then with the keys of ignition of 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:40.040
 volume down and the center 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:43.270
 let's enter the mode 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:47.240
 pick up and to be able to 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:49.910
 install our new firmware 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.540
 and it will rid us of all those damages 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.760
 caused 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.760
 with the bad drip as you can see 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:03:00.310
 we enter the mode we give continue with 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:04.480
 the volume key up 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:06.340
 and there comes the android logo and good 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.879
 so 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:12.630
 we got into the avalanche program and hit 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:18.050
 in fight 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:20.700
 we look for our unzipped file 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.920
 files in our file and we give to 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.500
 open 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:28.420
 to do this we will need that these 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:30.230
 two squares are stubborn 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:34.790
 is 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:37.909
 and the process will begin 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:40.720
 the new firmware without problem to the 

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:43.060
 beginning of 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.370
 this new installation of the firmware 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.110
 from the telephone and the program 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.430
 exit that answers us and that's why 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:52.209
 normal 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:55.079
 while installing this will take a few 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:55.079
 minutes 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:02.740
 we want to pause the video to make the video 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.740
 while it is installed 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:11.110
 how can they be seeing 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:14.810
 the new same is being installed 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:17.600
 our phone's firmware 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:21.859
 this took two minutes and you can 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:24.700
 keep producing the video until it 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:28.000
 install completely 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:30.090
 good friends and how do you see this process is 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.500
 a little late 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:37.500
 Well, it's almost over and if it comes out 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:40.500
 an equal box of file is next to it 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:43.680
 it imports the port that is connected 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:47.010
 cellular is the port with 5 then the 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:51.830
 operation is still normal as they see the 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:51.830
 cell is also filling his bar 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.780
 then yes 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:02.659
 we are still waiting for this may take 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:05.150
 for 15 minutes it's a bit of a process 

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:09.550
 slow 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:09.550
 consider the video another ratico 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:18.050
 as it is possible to see and it already goes out that resisted 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.050
 again 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:23.430
 when this happens the cell will learn 

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:25.590
 again and then it's going to start 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:26.980
 configure we hope it is configured 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.500
 single 

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:32.960
 Well, if you want, it's recipes because 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:35.690
 process went well and as we can see 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:38.680
 here in the program box says 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:40.370
 ok recipe or the user project 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:43.840
 optimum 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:43.840
 we hope to make a garment 

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:13.640
 this process of cell initiation 

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:17.180
 it's a bit slow since it takes a while 

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:19.990
 configure all your settings and 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:19.990
 configurations 

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:27.170
 our cell phone 

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:29.560
 and because this cell phone had a damage of 

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:32.960
 camera that served us by the sea rodeo 

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:34.340
 So then, what do you pledge then? 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:37.670
 to take the test if the camera has 

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:40.640
 served or not with this we give reference 

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:43.070
 if the new software update has 

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:45.790
 removed how bad we have done with the 

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:45.790
 bad rodeo 

00:06:46.689 --> 00:06:52.389
 We hope as I said this 

00:06:49.449 --> 00:06:54.489
 configuration is a bit slow so 

00:06:52.389 --> 00:06:57.900
 that are being configured by configuring 

00:06:54.489 --> 00:07:00.660
 the new updates 

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:02.490
 we will press the video until it 

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:05.389
 update the cell phone that is a price 

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:05.389
 pretty slow 

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:14.110
 and as you can see friends already 

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:18.160
 they updated and the cell phone is starting 

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:20.500
 well apparently we start well we are going to 

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:23.370
 see if our error has been fixed 

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:23.370
 of the camera 

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:26.670
 camera 

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:33.040
 and how friends can see the camera and 

00:07:31.139 --> 00:07:36.730
 works on 

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:39.160
 thank you very much for watching me tutorial and if

 video and if they require another kind of 

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:47.710
