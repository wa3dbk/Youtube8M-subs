00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 if you have ear music lovers and that 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:04.259
 music has an important place in 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.440
 your life 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.599
 the names of nobuo uematsu kôji kondô or 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.550
 still matt oulmene should you is 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.200
 familiar indeed these composers 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.230
 behind the final soundtracks 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.910
 fantasy zelda and diablo have put everything in 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.070
 work for each scene to become 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.380
 imperishable a good composition is 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.330
 so essential to any good game so 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.369
 to create a special atmosphere we 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.199
 we then tried to understand how 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.449
 a composer managed to find the note 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.710
 perfect and how to integrate them into the 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.690
 game we went to meet 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.190
 river olive tree to whom we owe 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.829
 especially the soundtracks of the un 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.210
 was dark age of orcs and men's 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.950
 generality is that very often the 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.030
 composer and therefore hired by a 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.950
 studio a cheater 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.450
 so he's going to have to live and music 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.879
 this music we will ask him in a 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.170
 particular style after maybe a 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.210
 kind of contest between several 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.860
 composers on that style there and they will 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.329
 choose which is the best this style 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.140
 and then him 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.940
 according to the directions of the studio down will do 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.160
 a music will deliver music after 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.409
 music in relation to the indications of the 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.460
 studio so for deus ex 3 the way 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.409
 which they worked on is that they have 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.260
 does the best so the layers with 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.330
 a curve the mood when we're in 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.540
 train to explore by having steels when 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.500
 we reach when someone or spot is 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.759
 well there is going to be something 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.680
 classical it was music and when we 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.000
 is in action phase bella the third 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.600
 layer so gets set up and sealed 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.950
 big percussion 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.930
 so it's a layer system like 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.310
 that of layher so that was it and that's 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.680
 still much exploited in the 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.340
 video but now me for example I 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.630
 am in search 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.689
 me what interests me is to go to 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.369
 Beyond that, I have a real saying 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:37.229
 ambitions I have a yearning for that 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.549
 the music is more at the heart of 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.810
 the experience of the small player 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.210
 demonstration on his previous 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:51.320
 production an independent game named 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:51.320
 harold there I double 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.380
 I 5th 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.659
 m 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:08.420
 there you go you are left right and cool 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:11.120
 now I'm going to die you see 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.620
 how do the warnings on j the 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.330
 music will get excited and the more you go 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.580
 like a one that is to say that you will 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.690
 to say but wait if chili 5th there 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.860
 what was happening to 4 what is it 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.340
 is happening at the 3d what was happening at 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.760
 2 and 1 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.380
 and that motivates you the composer remains 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.760
 then at the disposal of the team of 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.330
 development throughout the 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.130
 production 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.500
 they have all the information 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:34.400
 necessary in order to create a music 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.720
 sticky perfectly to the game for fact 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.310
 aspirations come from the creative 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.530
 director ie he when he 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.870
 speak he'll explain his game by 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.120
 example remember me and jean max jean 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.130
 maxime mauritius 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.590
 he explained to me that his game was based 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.720
 on memory the glitch and on the fact 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.880
 that she was a heroine and so he 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.890
 wanted the music to reflect his and 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.620
 so I had to think and 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:00.050
 I listen to them speak who I am 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.280
 who support you his idea that it makes 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.480
 his way through me so we 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.050
 end up with the idea of ​​using a 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.450
 orchestra 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:07.489
 to do this software fluently 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.980
 used his cube is for creation 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:12.049
 musical compositions pro tools 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.810
 for music mixing and post 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:16.640
 production as well as audio kinect wise 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.190
 for integration into the video game 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.380
 thanks to these tools the composer enjoys 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.360
 exceptional artistic freedom 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.640
 his creation has no limit but his 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.900
 creativity and so is before everything 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.640
 a panel of possibilities 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.560
 besides olive tree of river us 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.049
 explains a technique he used 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.750
 for the next remember me the violin 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:38.510
 that sounds we will say in a very way 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.739
 pretty like that well we'll do and we 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:43.310
 will make a lawsuit singh a bit like 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:45.049
 the dj do then lloris will have him 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.329
 played perfectly and actually it's for 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:49.850
 actually support this idea of ​​the glitch of 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:52.370
 memory and especially the human side 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:54.410
 so the acoustic side and the side 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.510
 electronics the future the fact that we are 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.950
 left in memorial plane and that makes that 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.360
 bombard 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.740
 we can be controlled and it's a bit 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:04.120
 all the story 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:06.580
 the game also attracts big names 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.530
 of the movie harry gregson williams this 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:11.560
 composer of x men origins and 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:13.090
 prometheus and michael giacchino 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.400
 the man behind the star music 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:16.840
 trekking and the recent john carter or 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.150
 also worked on series also 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.910
 prestigious that metal gear solid or 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.680
 call of duty but inspirations 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.340
 coming from the cinema are not to the taste of 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.560
 everybody 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:30.120
 video game music and that of 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.120
 movies not having the same utility 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:35.200
 overall the video game is inspired by the 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:38.320
 cinema that's on it so for the music 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:40.150
 it's the same said it's for me 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.590
 an emancipation that is necessary for 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.470
 video games but which for the moment is 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:46.420
 not yet there to know that good bath them 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.010
 people they'll go listen to batman or 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:49.900
 so they'll go listen to throne or 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:51.430
 so they will go listen because 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.060
 Caribbean and they'll say that's what we 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.500
 wants in our game 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.850
 that's because there is a 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.140
 normalization flaw a kind of 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:57.370
 democratization of this kind of music 

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:57.580
 which makes these referents to all the 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.040
 world 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.710
 I have all the music I could 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:04.660
 to make any reference name a movie 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:06.550
 especially but again 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:09.580
 it's because I have a real 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:11.710
 will to that, ie not to 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.060
 to be different these games I'm not trying to 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.860
 I 'm different because I do not like 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.230
 the others are not that I try to 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.450
 put at the service of the game 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:19.890
 even if a conservatory will help you 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:20.610
 acquire the basics of composition 

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:22.440
 musical 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:24.660
 it's mostly your investment and 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.970
 your knowledge for the video game that 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:29.100
 will be your greatest asset I am a 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:30.780
 very big player I am passionate about 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:33.540
 video games actually it's I'm doing almost 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.530
 of video game music in fact I 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:35.910
 make video game music for 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:38.160
 work for the video game to in 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:41.600
 actually be in touch with the video game and not 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.600
 to make music
