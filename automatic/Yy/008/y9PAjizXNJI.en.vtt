00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.139 

this<00:01:17.430> bar<00:01:17.790> right<00:01:17.970> here<00:01:19.190> changes<00:01:20.190> the<00:01:20.220> speed<00:01:20.670> of

00:01:21.139 --> 00:01:21.149 
this bar right here changes the speed of

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:23.950 
this bar right here changes the speed of
the<00:01:21.479> tune<00:01:21.659> of<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.869> car<00:01:22.170> but<00:01:23.040> it'll<00:01:23.399> override

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
the tune of the car but it'll override

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.080 
the tune of the car but it'll override
the<00:01:24.960> gearing<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.649> the<00:01:26.130> limiting<00:01:26.580> on<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.880> car

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.550 
the gearing and the limiting on the car
and<00:01:27.390> make<00:01:27.690> it<00:01:27.720> like<00:01:28.460> really<00:01:29.460> fast<00:01:29.850> I<00:01:30.270> think

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
and make it like really fast I think

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.380 
and make it like really fast I think
it's<00:01:31.560> probably<00:01:31.800> over<00:01:32.520> 300<00:01:32.759> miles<00:01:33.149> an<00:01:33.330> hour

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
it's probably over 300 miles an hour

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.230 
it's probably over 300 miles an hour
here<00:01:33.690> but<00:01:34.320> I<00:01:34.399> like<00:01:35.399> playing<00:01:35.640> with<00:01:35.789> it<00:01:36.000> here

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
here but I like playing with it here

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.359 
here but I like playing with it here

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
because if you go too fast a lot of the

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.320 
because if you go too fast a lot of the
times<00:01:38.750> you<00:01:39.750> just<00:01:39.810> lose<00:01:40.229> control<00:01:40.259> too<00:01:40.920> easily
