00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:12.070
 Hello everyone, there are only a few days left 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:14.680
 at Christmas and I want to propose one 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:17.590
 a really nice recipe is a brioche 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:20.439
 very particular to nutella to me 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.779
 reminiscent of a snowflake with a star 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:25.030
 I find it absolutely perfect for 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:27.789
 Christmas, take advantage of it 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:30.210
 it takes very little for a very sweet thought 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:30.210
 to the next 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:54.430
 250 g of flour 00 mill that advances 250 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:59.410
 g manitoba flour mill chiavazza 80 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:05.680
 g of warm water 60 g of sugar 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:11.590
 eridania 80 grams of warm milk 3 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:18.280
 eggs 30 g of soft butter 15 grams of 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:20.160
 beer yeast 300 g of nutella per 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.780
 start dissolve the yeast 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.729
 in warm water and start a 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.440
 dilute it with your fingers until yes 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:29.259
 melts 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:32.229
 I add 4 tablespoons of flour taken from 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:38.860
 total then joining the manitoba that 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:44.250
 doubling 0 and activating the kneading machine now 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:47.080
 I add the eggs and continue to knead 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.780
 gradually adding a little flour for 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:53.680
 give body to the dough 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:56.229
 in this way it will absorb it well 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.180
 add the warm milk leaving one 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:01.600
 little aside to polish the brioche 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.340
 before cooking and continue with the 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.560
 flour 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.160
 after which I add the soft butter and 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:12.440
 I let it knead for two minutes 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:15.880
 the dough will be smooth and homogeneous 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.880
 puts it in a bowl 

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:28.819
 I cover with the film and it is born in 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:31.219
 double this time 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.780
 I break the leavening spilling 

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:43.639
 the dough on a pastry board well 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:47.359
 sprinkled with flour a little flour 

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:51.290
 also on the surface and divide the 

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:53.870
 composed in four parts helping me with 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:58.819
 the rolling pin spread the balls to one 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:03:00.889
 about 3 mm thick I wear the first one 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:03.250
 puff on a baking sheet lined with paper 

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:03.250
 oven 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.879
 I extend a very thin layer of 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:14.079
 Nutella to spread it out better there 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:16.340
 I advise to cool the bain-marie 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:19.569
 keep in mind to leave a 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.569
 centimeter from the edges 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:29.920
 I continue closing with the second 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:34.200
 puff pastry again with nutella e 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.200
 close with the other disc and so on 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:42.190
 close with the last layer of pasta 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:44.560
 brioche will then have to get four 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:47.560
 layers of puff pastry and three layers of 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:52.210
 edge seal model pinching there 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:54.790
 with fingers and bring the canvas to the fridge for 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:58.870
 15 minutes to better cut the 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:01.330
 brioche and will make the nutella sweat 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:04.030
 a croissant making a cross without 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:06.930
 but to reach the center I continue 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.930
 cutting the diagonals 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:16.890
 and divide them in half, obtaining everything 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:16.890
 16 triangles 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:28.449
 at this point I take a triangle e 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:31.080
 starting from the center I do two laps 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:31.080
 full 

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:38.280
 I continue with the others alternating in the 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:38.280
 direction 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:47.190
 I let it rise again until 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:51.690
 doubling brushes the surface with the 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:55.130
 milk and in the oven at 180 degrees for 20 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:55.130
 minutes or less
