00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
and I think we only need about 3000 more

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.479 
and I think we only need about 3000 more
which<00:03:25.110> is<00:03:25.230> absolutely<00:03:25.620> insane<00:03:25.980> and<00:03:26.190> I<00:03:26.430> don't

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
which is absolutely insane and I don't

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.520 
which is absolutely insane and I don't
think<00:03:26.940> that<00:03:27.060> the<00:03:27.150> 300<00:03:27.660> case<00:03:27.780> special<00:03:28.200> will<00:03:28.410> be

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
think that the 300 case special will be

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.470 
think that the 300 case special will be
able<00:03:28.650> to<00:03:28.799> go<00:03:28.920> up<00:03:28.950> exactly<00:03:29.519> when<00:03:29.700> I<00:03:29.730> hit<00:03:29.940> it<00:03:30.000> but

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:15.389 
camera had really low battery so I will

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:16.520

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
anyways let's see here can with the

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.960 
anyways let's see here can with the
stunt<00:04:19.230> now<00:04:19.859> we<00:04:19.919> keep<00:04:20.160> hitting<00:04:20.400> the<00:04:20.489> billboard

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:22.230 
so we need to go a bit higher I think

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:24.200
