00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:11.300
 we are trying to bring this 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.309
 project that has come a long time ago 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.410
 but obviously because of the distance because 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:18.260
 it's outside of Guatemala it became a 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:19.680
 bit difficult but I finally think that 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:23.190
 we are going to 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:26.010
 to enter the market and good to make a 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:27.930
 brand born in guatemala a brand that 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.550
 first god is going to represent no 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.640
 only the soccer player because 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.890
 obviously this is how with many people 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.900
 he will see him but the Guatemalan athlete 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:42.850
 that represents because it's discipline in 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:46.840
 the foreigner casual sportswear 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:49.680
 obviously we have medium short goals 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:55.320
 and long term 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:56.760
 let's try to be in the sport myself 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.640
 I think the easiest thing would be in football 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.739
 obviously but then we want to be in 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.350
 Other good sports 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.510
 obviously when we are talking about 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:11.400
 casual brand is that the Guatemalan salt 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:15.020
 when they wear it, but I eat 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:19.470
 athlete would like to see this sports brand 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:21.660
 when the athletes are representing 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.369
 guatemala to use it when you 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.760
 are putting their gold medals of 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.590
 bronze silver 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.260
 that guatemala first god play 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.090
 world with this brand of 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.610
 baseball selections basketball 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.870
 badminton softball when when 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.650
 absolutely everyone who has 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.650
 excel 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:46.720
 we do not have all the names registered 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:49.580
 Wolves but some details are still missing 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:52.220
 the maquilas in guatemala the great 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.990
 most work for important firms 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.970
 abroad 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.090
 and obviously make a space of interest 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:01.850
 a bit difficult but we are finding 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.850
 people who are helping us and textile companies 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.290
 and South America 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.030
 and they are also shaking hands 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.759
 then you just need to find those people 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.420
 to commit to this project and there 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.420
 we start towards 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.750
 I was always 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.270
 that is the dream of seeing Guatemala with 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.050
 a mark 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:27.530
 the Guatemalan sport with a brand 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:29.660
 if born in own guatemala 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.970
 I had to do Olympic cycles and I 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:35.180
 I noticed the shortage of clothes when 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:38.470
 we did the olympic cycle for us 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:42.319
 the athletes and I think that over there we can 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:44.800
 we can start already winning something not a 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:44.800
 good presentation 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.140
 and that the athletes feel comfortable 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.569
 as well 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:55.130
 and the uniforms are apt to compete 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:56.990
 and that is not a brand of which the 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:00.130
 people speak and they feel proud 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:00.130
 to deport him
