00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:22.020
 near where the esther leaves this 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.630

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.270

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.380

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.280

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:41.810
 kilometers per hour this car in the 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:43.850
 Real life would be a honda acura ns x 2015 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:47.260
 in online mode you can find it 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:50.579
 for 240 thousand dollars 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:54.929
 and I also take the opportunity to say 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:58.890
 not only the car appears here 

00:00:54.929 --> 00:01:02.670
 esther street also appears the eaves and 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:05.430
 the car that was seen at the end of 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.310
 start forgiveness at the beginning of the video 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.850
 that was parked with the alarm 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.460
 lit 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.480
 it would be good this car that we are now 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.480
 me up 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.820
 but I tuned hundred percent already 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.970
 you will see now we will get here in a 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.510
 alley 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.510
 you will see 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.690
 that looks like it's a vip zone then 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.970
 very luxurious cars usually spend them 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:37.860
 I recommend that you spend at night because 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.860
 those hours always tend to find them 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.500
 around here now you will see that the car comes out 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:47.580

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.090

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.820

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.750
 map and where it's located does also 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.540

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.420
 here in this position and in the other 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.930
 destination position that I left in purple 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:14.910
 there is a five-seater parking 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.520
 and on the second floor there is always a 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.760
 tuned car that can be a surprise 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:24.300
 to read and this and the other car that 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:27.150
 I found or among several but try it and 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.819
 you will see that they will not only disappoint 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:33.930
