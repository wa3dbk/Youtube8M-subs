happened with the warlords of Draenor
alpha<00:00:06.480> and<00:00:06.839> honestly<00:00:07.230> so<00:00:07.620> little<00:00:07.950> that<00:00:08.189> they

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
it's been a bit ridiculous that it's

lasted<00:00:36.719> so<00:00:36.899> long<00:00:37.309> so<00:00:38.309> it's<00:00:38.460> definitely<00:00:38.760> going

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
lasted so long so it's definitely going

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
backup and unrolling with the next patch

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.340 
backup and unrolling with the next patch
now<00:00:44.700> this<00:00:44.879> was<00:00:45.090> confirmed<00:00:45.329> on<00:00:45.780> Twitter<00:00:45.840> via

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
now this was confirmed on Twitter via

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.150 
bumper and in the same fell swoop he
also<00:00:48.870> confirmed<00:00:49.410> that<00:00:49.620> they<00:00:49.800> wouldn't<00:00:50.129> be

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
also confirmed that they wouldn't be

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.680 
also confirmed that they wouldn't be
doing<00:00:50.460> anything<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:50.940> silvermoon<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:51.600> patch

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
doing anything to silvermoon and patch

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.500 
doing anything to silvermoon and patch
6.0<00:00:52.500> but<00:00:53.309> I<00:00:53.340> don't<00:00:53.640> think<00:00:53.760> Silverman<00:00:54.270> really

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
6.0 but I don't think Silverman really

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.510 
6.0 but I don't think Silverman really
needed<00:00:54.870> anything<00:00:54.960> I<00:00:55.410> mean<00:00:55.860> it's<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.129> really

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
needed anything I mean it's a really

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.430 
needed anything I mean it's a really
kind<00:00:56.760> of<00:00:56.910> beautiful<00:00:57.180> looking<00:00:57.600> city<00:00:57.870> as<00:00:58.079> it<00:00:58.289> is

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
kind of beautiful looking city as it is

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.470 
kind of beautiful looking city as it is
ok<00:00:59.160> I<00:00:59.370> suppose<00:00:59.520> some<00:01:00.030> people<00:01:00.059> would<00:01:00.420> like

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
ok I suppose some people would like

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.470 
ok I suppose some people would like
flying<00:01:00.930> there<00:01:01.260> but<00:01:02.160> it's<00:01:02.489> just<00:01:02.760> not<00:01:02.850> worth<00:01:03.239> the

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
flying there but it's just not worth the

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.899 
flying there but it's just not worth the
work<00:01:03.690> it<00:01:04.350> really<00:01:04.589> isn't<00:01:04.830> that<00:01:05.100> there's<00:01:05.729> more

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
work it really isn't that there's more

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.250 
work it really isn't that there's more
important<00:01:06.360> things<00:01:06.390> for<00:01:06.720> Blizzard<00:01:07.049> to<00:01:07.140> be

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
important things for Blizzard to be

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
slots those they're meant for reagents

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.260 
slots those they're meant for reagents
and<00:01:24.330> your<00:01:25.110> reagents<00:01:25.799> will<00:01:26.040> form<00:01:26.400> stacks<00:01:26.909> of

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
and your reagents will form stacks of

there<00:01:46.079> are<00:01:46.110> lots<00:01:46.740> people<00:01:47.070> i<00:01:47.159> know<00:01:47.220> that<00:01:47.610> have

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
there are lots people i know that have

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.789 
there are lots people i know that have
really<00:01:48.299> got<00:01:48.570> a<00:01:48.600> problem<00:01:49.020> where<00:01:49.439> they're

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
really got a problem where they're

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.649 
really got a problem where they're
maxing<00:01:50.310> out<00:01:50.399> banks<00:01:50.850> based<00:01:51.090> on<00:01:51.270> loads<00:01:51.509> of

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
maxing out banks based on loads of

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.780 
maxing out banks based on loads of
characters<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:52.439> they<00:01:52.979> end<00:01:53.159> up<00:01:53.340> having<00:01:53.640> a

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
characters and they end up having a

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.880 
characters and they end up having a
great<00:01:54.360> deal<00:01:54.540> of<00:01:54.570> trouble<00:01:54.930> managing<00:01:55.470> their

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
great deal of trouble managing their

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.319 
great deal of trouble managing their
items<00:01:56.250> because<00:01:56.549> they<00:01:56.670> just<00:01:56.820> don't<00:01:56.969> have<00:01:57.119> the

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
items because they just don't have the

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.179 
items because they just don't have the
room<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:57.750> store<00:01:57.960> it<00:01:58.110> all<00:01:58.229> well<00:01:58.740> this<00:01:58.920> is<00:01:59.040> going

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
room to store it all well this is going

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.249 
room to store it all well this is going
to<00:01:59.340> massively<00:01:59.790> cut<00:02:00.060> down<00:02:00.270> on<00:02:00.420> that<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:00.780> also

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
to massively cut down on that and also

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.840 
to massively cut down on that and also
means<00:02:01.710> that<00:02:01.799> you'll<00:02:02.130> have<00:02:02.189> somewhere<00:02:02.610> just<00:02:02.759> to

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
means that you'll have somewhere just to

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.870 
means that you'll have somewhere just to
dump<00:02:03.119> all<00:02:03.299> your<00:02:03.360> reagents<00:02:04.079> and<00:02:04.200> so<00:02:05.130> in<00:02:05.640> terms

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
dump all your reagents and so in terms

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.969 
dump all your reagents and so in terms
of<00:02:06.090> just<00:02:06.240> keeping<00:02:06.540> your<00:02:06.689> bags<00:02:06.930> clear<00:02:07.469> if<00:02:07.590> you

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
of just keeping your bags clear if you

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.790 
of just keeping your bags clear if you
do<00:02:08.129> happen<00:02:08.310> to<00:02:08.459> be<00:02:08.580> back<00:02:08.759> at<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.060> town<00:02:09.390> then

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
do happen to be back at the town then

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.260 
do happen to be back at the town then
just<00:02:10.800> throw<00:02:11.039> your<00:02:11.220> reagents<00:02:11.670> in<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:11.849> bank<00:02:12.060> it

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
just throw your reagents in the bank it

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.830 
just throw your reagents in the bank it
doesn't<00:02:12.720> matter<00:02:12.840> you've<00:02:13.080> got<00:02:13.230> so<00:02:13.440> much

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
doesn't matter you've got so much

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.509 
doesn't matter you've got so much
that<00:02:14.620> there's<00:02:14.860> not<00:02:15.010> a<00:02:15.040> great<00:02:15.250> deal<00:02:15.340> of

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:15.519 
that there's not a great deal of

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:17.610 
that there's not a great deal of
consequence<00:02:16.120> to<00:02:16.239> it<00:02:16.510> I<00:02:16.690> think<00:02:17.110> that<00:02:17.140> helps<00:02:17.500> out

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
consequence to it I think that helps out

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.530 
consequence to it I think that helps out
a<00:02:17.650> lot<00:02:17.709> and<00:02:18.190> it's<00:02:18.370> a<00:02:18.430> pretty<00:02:18.580> good<00:02:18.819> way<00:02:18.970> of<00:02:19.000> just

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
a lot and it's a pretty good way of just

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.320 
a lot and it's a pretty good way of just
giving<00:02:20.319> us<00:02:20.530> a<00:02:20.620> extra<00:02:21.430> little<00:02:21.610> bit<00:02:21.849> of<00:02:21.970> quality

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
giving us a extra little bit of quality

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.190 
giving us a extra little bit of quality
of<00:02:22.360> life<00:02:23.099> okay<00:02:24.099> so<00:02:24.160> next<00:02:24.550> we<00:02:25.239> have<00:02:25.510> another

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
that they have increased the size of

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.479 
that they have increased the size of
void<00:02:31.150> storage<00:02:31.690> they've<00:02:32.290> actually<00:02:32.560> doubled<00:02:33.370> it

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
void storage they've actually doubled it

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:35.550 
void storage they've actually doubled it
they've<00:02:33.640> added<00:02:33.910> a<00:02:33.970> second<00:02:34.330> tab<00:02:34.510> meaning<00:02:35.049> we

thousand and I think that's actually

your way through a few quests to to

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:44.339 
your way through a few quests to to
unlock<00:03:42.880> these<00:03:43.060> things<00:03:43.389> I<00:03:43.599> don't<00:03:43.840> think<00:03:44.169> it's<00:03:44.290> a

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:44.349 
unlock these things I don't think it's a

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:46.830 
unlock these things I don't think it's a
major<00:03:44.530> issue<00:03:44.859> and<00:03:45.250> I<00:03:46.030> guess<00:03:46.269> the<00:03:46.480> decent

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
major issue and I guess the decent

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.629 
major issue and I guess the decent
enough<00:03:47.019> gold<00:03:47.349> sink<00:03:47.680> what's<00:03:48.280> going<00:03:48.519> to<00:03:48.579> be

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:48.639 
enough gold sink what's going to be

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:50.190 
enough gold sink what's going to be
interesting<00:03:49.150> is<00:03:49.269> how<00:03:49.389> we<00:03:49.450> attain<00:03:49.989> the

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
interesting is how we attain the

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.559 
interesting is how we attain the
buildings<00:03:50.680> that<00:03:50.829> you<00:03:51.280> do<00:03:51.489> not<00:03:51.730> naturally<00:03:52.060> get

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:52.569 
buildings that you do not naturally get

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:54.509 
buildings that you do not naturally get
throughout<00:03:52.840> questing<00:03:53.410> so<00:03:53.620> maybe<00:03:54.220> there<00:03:54.430> are

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 
throughout questing so maybe there are

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:55.890 
throughout questing so maybe there are
some<00:03:54.549> profession-based<00:03:55.150> ones<00:03:55.569> or<00:03:55.720> something

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
some profession-based ones or something

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.960 
some profession-based ones or something

of<00:05:05.340> you<00:05:05.759> I<00:05:05.789> on<00:05:06.300> the<00:05:06.419> trill<00:05:06.599> tip<00:05:06.840> that<00:05:07.380> says<00:05:07.770> if<00:05:07.979> a

00:05:08.059 --> 00:05:08.069 
of you I on the trill tip that says if a

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:09.710 
of you I on the trill tip that says if a
glyph<00:05:08.310> is<00:05:08.460> exclusive<00:05:09.000> with<00:05:09.150> any<00:05:09.270> other<00:05:09.449> glyphs

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:09.720 
glyph is exclusive with any other glyphs

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.740 
glyph is exclusive with any other glyphs
because<00:05:10.199> obviously<00:05:10.349> you<00:05:10.770> couldn't<00:05:11.009> have

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750 
because obviously you couldn't have

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.899 
because obviously you couldn't have
three<00:05:12.750> different<00:05:13.080> polymorph<00:05:13.770> glyphs<00:05:14.580> you

00:05:14.899 --> 00:05:14.909 
three different polymorph glyphs you

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:16.670 
three different polymorph glyphs you
know<00:05:15.000> like<00:05:15.180> monkey<00:05:15.569> penguin<00:05:15.990> and<00:05:16.110> porcupines

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
know like monkey penguin and porcupines

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.740 
know like monkey penguin and porcupines
so<00:05:17.099> it's<00:05:17.699> it's<00:05:17.970> pretty<00:05:18.210> cool<00:05:18.419> that<00:05:18.479> they've
