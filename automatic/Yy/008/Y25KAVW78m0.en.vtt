00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:36.769

 always to a new video and in this 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:50.210
 opportunity we will begin this recount 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:51.559
 with this game called link rivers go in 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.780
 we will have to go with our 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:56.750
 rabid birds in all the races 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.369
 to compete and win and be the best 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.289
 we can all improve our 

00:00:58.369 --> 00:01:01.820
 vehicles and we can also buy a 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:03.890
 great variety of them and also 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.899
 we can play different types of 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.690
 careers as they can be versus the 

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:11.030
 competitive online or play a very style 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.890
 entertaining that is the angry birds ruiz 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.929
 in which we will have to eliminate all 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.179
 the fruits and reach the goal with the 

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:18.890
 indicator is a very wonderful game and 

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:21.220
 as always you will find it in the play 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.220
 store 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.780
 and as a second recommendation we will have 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.670
 this great game called the greatest 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.429
 margin in this we will continue with 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.020
 our soldier all over the land and 

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:34.390
 we will have to eliminate some 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.759
 evil minuets that will be pulling us 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.829
 his tours in chinchón things like that and 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:40.420
 we will have to prevent this from 

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:42.640
 hit and at the same time we will have to 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.289
 eliminate all wild ninjas that 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.600
 let's see to appear we will go through 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:48.219
 different types of maps and at the same time 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.409
 we are going, it will be done more 

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:52.509
 difficult the game we will have to avoid 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:56.070
 eliminate citizens and 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:59.250
 concentrate on eliminating the ninjas 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.409
 green sorry chip happens is the third 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.900
 recommendation and it is very entertaining the 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.180
 history tells us that perseo was in 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.459
 the terrain of Olympic competition and 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.649
 he arrives in Copernicus and sells him some boots 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.690
 which have wings and no longer 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.459
 You can stop during the whole race 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.170
 this is how we will have to go 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.750
 running throughout the Olympiad and 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.030
 we will have to eliminate eliminating and 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.860
 jumping all over the land we will have 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.570
 that we collect coins we will have to 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.670
 take care of all the enemies and 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.709
 we will have to reach the damn 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.470
 copérnico to give him a beating for 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:34.050
 have stolen the money 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.420
 and the next recommendation is this 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.220
 game called roman from maps in this 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.770
 we will find a large area 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.470
 for different levels and its theme of 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.960
 the next the Martian aliens 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.580
 with Roman style they have invaded our 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.470
 planet and we will have to 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.420
 eliminate them all but be careful 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.490
 because as you progress in 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.800
 each one of the maps its improvement 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:59.160
 technology will be remarkable and it will be much 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:01.050
 harder to eliminate them all and to 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.420
 finish with this count we will have 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.070
 this game called the cjex pierce of the 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.750
 fair that's clear 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.700
 in this game will have the theme of 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.680
 We compete with jousts in the 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.240
 which will have to be faster than 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.070
 our adversary we will have to 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.390
 control with our left side our 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.820
 shield and with our right side 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.830
 our vast one we will also be able to play 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.720
 online form apart from campaign and 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.640
 survival and in the online form we will have 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.290
 that compete against different people 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:29.300
 of the world and we will also have to 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:31.640
 improve our elements in armory 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:34.220
