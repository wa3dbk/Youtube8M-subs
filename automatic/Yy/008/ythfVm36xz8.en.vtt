00:00:00.159 --> 00:00:03.530
 Like loneliness 

00:00:03.539 --> 00:00:06.280
 Lyrics: Wu Qingfeng 

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:09.530
 Lead singer: Soda Green 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.521
 Raised a dream in the dusty memories 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:01:01.021
 The man in the photo once lived with me. 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:07.641
 Got a dream in the past and lived a river 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:14.511
 Has moisturized the pulse in the real side 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.511
 Life comes to the window 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.331
 Did not scream and walked away from us 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.201
 Who is trapped by love who sacrifices for love 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:30.261
 Who is deeper than anyone? 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.801
 At that time, I stood up and extended my hand. 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.391
 I saw the outline as a universe. 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.081
 Sweet habits become life 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.171
 I learned what 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.831
 Now the story develops me. 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.391
 Learned to live and enjoy loneliness 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.141
 Intense language becomes gentle 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.331
 What brought it again? 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:09.321
 If you have never walked, how do you understand? 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:25.791
 Flying over the past, sometimes burning eyes 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:32.821
 The wounded line now sounds easy 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:39.511
 Quietly calmed down and sometimes laughed 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:46.291
 I look at the wind at the moment, it is still the wind. 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.351
 Life blows in front of 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.171
 Do not make a palm print 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.851
 Squandered the fate and saw the scenery 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:02.071
 I know profoundly 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.731
 At that time, I stood up and extended my hand. 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.291
 I saw the outline as a universe. 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.041
 Sweet habits become life 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.791
 I learned what 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.851
 Now the story develops me. 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.471
 Learned to live and enjoy loneliness 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.101
 Intense language becomes gentle 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.891
 What brought it again? 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:36.721
 If you have never walked, how do you understand? 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.971
 At that time, I stood up and extended my hand. 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.531
 I saw the outline as a universe. 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.221
 Sweet habits become life 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.411
 I learned what 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.031
 Now the story develops me. 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.661
 Learned to live and enjoy loneliness 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.411
 Intense language becomes gentle 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.591
 What brought it again? 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:17.911
 If you have never walked, how do you understand?
