also made by Murray Tech and this one is

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.609 
also made by Murray Tech and this one is
the<00:00:17.190> Mega<00:00:17.400> Man<00:00:17.490> X<00:00:17.910> controller<00:00:18.449> for<00:00:18.990> Nintendo

as you can see also very nice stone
packaging

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:30.849 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:33.900 

opening<00:00:31.720> it<00:00:31.810> up<00:00:31.929> but<00:00:32.829> it's<00:00:33.460> also<00:00:33.610> got<00:00:33.879> a

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:33.910 
opening it up but it's also got a

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.630 
opening it up but it's also got a
display<00:00:34.480> in<00:00:34.899> so<00:00:35.260> it's<00:00:35.410> stand<00:00:35.710> very<00:00:36.280> much<00:00:36.430> like

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:36.640 
display in so it's stand very much like

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.139 
display in so it's stand very much like
the<00:00:36.820> shadow<00:00:37.030> controller<00:00:38.940> just<00:00:39.940> get<00:00:40.090> the

00:00:40.139 --> 00:00:40.149 
the shadow controller just get the

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:46.680 
the shadow controller just get the
controller<00:00:40.570> out

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.900 

it's<00:00:47.170> got<00:00:47.320> some<00:00:47.469> really<00:00:47.680> nice<00:00:47.920> Megaman

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:48.910 
it's got some really nice Megaman

00:00:48.910 --> 00:01:01.580 
it's got some really nice Megaman
artwork<00:00:49.420> on<00:00:49.629> it<00:00:52.199> sticks

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.149 

also<00:01:02.280> feels<00:01:02.579> like<00:01:03.059> quality<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:03.830> as<00:01:04.830> also<00:01:05.010> a

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
also feels like quality and as also a

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.940 
also feels like quality and as also a
small<00:01:05.489> controller<00:01:06.080> but<00:01:07.080> not<00:01:07.229> that<00:01:07.409> much<00:01:07.619> more

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
small controller but not that much more

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.660 
small controller but not that much more
than<00:01:08.010> your<00:01:08.310> normal<00:01:08.400> GameCube<00:01:09.060> controller

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
than your normal GameCube controller

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:22.820 
than your normal GameCube controller
with<00:01:11.670> all<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.940> buttons

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.220 

now<00:01:23.370> most<00:01:23.670> Mega<00:01:23.940> Man<00:01:24.180> fans<00:01:24.450> will<00:01:24.780> already<00:01:25.140> have

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:25.230 
now most Mega Man fans will already have

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.830 
now most Mega Man fans will already have
this<00:01:25.590> controller<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.630> that<00:01:27.630> would<00:01:27.720> probably

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
this controller and that would probably

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.320 
this controller and that would probably
already<00:01:28.080> know<00:01:28.440> that<00:01:28.470> it's<00:01:28.980> quite<00:01:29.280> hard<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:30.030> get

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.330 
already know that it's quite hard to get

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.960 
already know that it's quite hard to get
and<00:01:30.630> if<00:01:31.140> you<00:01:31.260> do<00:01:31.560> manage<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:31.920> get<00:01:32.280> you<00:01:32.640> will<00:01:32.820> be

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
and if you do manage to get you will be

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.820 
and if you do manage to get you will be
paying<00:01:33.330> for<00:01:33.450> it<00:01:33.660> as<00:01:33.960> these<00:01:34.260> do<00:01:34.470> go<00:01:34.680> quite<00:01:34.950> high

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
paying for it as these do go quite high

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:42.350 
paying for it as these do go quite high
they<00:01:37.830> are<00:01:37.860> getting<00:01:38.160> rarer<00:01:39.260> so<00:01:40.260> if<00:01:40.470> you<00:01:40.620> do<00:01:41.360> if

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
they are getting rarer so if you do if

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.920 
they are getting rarer so if you do if
you<00:01:42.510> are<00:01:42.660> off<00:01:42.870> to<00:01:42.900> one<00:01:43.670> then<00:01:44.670> you<00:01:45.330> better<00:01:45.570> snap

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
you are off to one then you better snap

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.020 
you are off to one then you better snap
one<00:01:46.140> up<00:01:46.290> while<00:01:46.740> they<00:01:46.890> still<00:01:47.220> are<00:01:47.580> a<00:01:47.610> reasonable

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
one up while they still are a reasonable

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.490 
one up while they still are a reasonable
cross

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:01.179 

again<00:01:54.250> very<00:01:54.580> much<00:01:54.640> a<00:01:54.760> quality-control

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:01.189 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:03.459 

and<00:02:01.310> the<00:02:02.030> diamond<00:02:02.479> is<00:02:02.810> slightly<00:02:03.049> different<00:02:03.289> in

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:03.469 
and the diamond is slightly different in

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:05.649 
and the diamond is slightly different in
the<00:02:03.500> shadows<00:02:03.890> but<00:02:04.759> if<00:02:04.880> you<00:02:04.969> can<00:02:05.119> see<00:02:05.390> it<00:02:05.479> but

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
the shadows but if you can see it but

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:08.919 
the shadows but if you can see it but
it's<00:02:05.810> got<00:02:05.960> like<00:02:07.330> knocks<00:02:08.330> in<00:02:08.599> there<00:02:08.780> or

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
it's got like knocks in there or

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.890 
it's got like knocks in there or
something<00:02:09.640> it<00:02:10.640> just<00:02:10.670> gives<00:02:11.209> it<00:02:11.330> a<00:02:11.450> really<00:02:11.480> nice

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
something it just gives it a really nice

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:20.210 
something it just gives it a really nice
look<00:02:11.959> to<00:02:12.319> it

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.790 

so<00:02:20.760> possibly<00:02:21.420> even<00:02:21.810> a<00:02:21.930> bit<00:02:22.080> more<00:02:22.110> cooler<00:02:22.620> than

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
so possibly even a bit more cooler than

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:28.790 
so possibly even a bit more cooler than
the<00:02:22.950> actual<00:02:23.250> shadow<00:02:23.460> controller<00:02:27.470> this<00:02:28.470> also

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
the actual shadow controller this also

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.980 
the actual shadow controller this also
comes<00:02:29.160> with<00:02:29.340> a<00:02:29.460> manual<00:02:29.910> like<00:02:30.540> the<00:02:30.720> shadow

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
comes with a manual like the shadow

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:45.119 
comes with a manual like the shadow
controller

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:45.129 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:48.759 

also<00:02:46.129> has<00:02:46.340> information<00:02:46.579> about<00:02:47.180> it<00:02:47.769> the

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:48.769 
also has information about it the

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:59.170 
also has information about it the
Megaman<00:02:49.400> picture<00:02:49.790> there

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:05.190 

another<00:02:59.959> megaman<00:03:00.680> image

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.420 

yeah

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.729 

ryo-san<00:03:10.209> controller<00:03:11.370> looks<00:03:12.370> great<00:03:13.739> feels

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
ryo-san controller looks great feels

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:19.260 
ryo-san controller looks great feels
nice

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:19.270 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.800
