boxing as well

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.020 
boxing as well
it's<00:01:20.060> hard<00:01:20.690> it's<00:01:21.380> a<00:01:21.440> lot<00:01:21.560> of<00:01:21.590> work<00:01:21.830> a<00:01:22.100> lot<00:01:22.970> of

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
it's hard it's a lot of work a lot of

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.540 
it's hard it's a lot of work a lot of
sweat<00:01:23.240> a<00:01:23.780> lot<00:01:24.140> of<00:01:24.200> time<00:01:24.440> but<00:01:24.740> I<00:01:24.800> enjoy<00:01:25.160> it<00:01:25.370> I

sweat a lot of time but I enjoy it I

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.360 
sweat a lot of time but I enjoy it I
think<00:01:26.090> it's<00:01:26.240> more<00:01:26.420> fun<00:01:26.690> than<00:01:26.840> it<00:01:26.990> is<00:01:27.140> work<00:01:27.440> so

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:28.370 
think it's more fun than it is work so

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.420 
think it's more fun than it is work so
it's<00:01:29.180> really<00:01:29.480> not<00:01:29.660> an<00:01:29.930> issue<00:01:30.280> training<00:01:31.280> so

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
it's really not an issue training so

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.100 
it's really not an issue training so
often<00:01:31.820> I<00:01:31.970> could<00:01:32.360> train<00:01:32.540> every<00:01:32.750> day<00:01:32.780> and<00:01:33.080> I

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
often I could train every day and I

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:34.540 
often I could train every day and I
would<00:01:33.170> be<00:01:33.320> okay<00:01:33.560> but<00:01:33.740> you<00:01:33.860> know<00:01:33.980> there's

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:34.550 
would be okay but you know there's

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.760

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.270 

they<00:02:42.120> help<00:02:42.390> but<00:02:43.140> if<00:02:43.260> you<00:02:43.440> become<00:02:43.800> the<00:02:44.010> fear

they help but if you become the fear

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.330 
they help but if you become the fear
then<00:02:44.819> you're<00:02:45.030> run<00:02:45.209> by<00:02:45.450> fear<00:02:45.890> you<00:02:46.890> can't<00:02:47.130> make<00:02:47.310> a

then you're run by fear you can't make a
choice<00:02:47.430> as<00:02:48.060> you<00:02:48.269> are<00:02:48.450> to<00:02:48.600> fear<00:02:48.810> absolutely<00:02:49.799> I

choice as you are to fear absolutely I

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:52.130 
choice as you are to fear absolutely I
think<00:02:50.130> it's<00:02:50.250> more<00:02:51.209> than<00:02:51.420> we<00:02:51.540> expected

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
think it's more than we expected

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.350 
think it's more than we expected
more<00:02:52.530> than<00:02:52.709> we<00:02:52.799> could<00:02:52.890> have<00:02:52.950> anticipated<00:02:53.360> you

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
more than we could have anticipated you

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.000 
more than we could have anticipated you
know<00:02:54.480> walking<00:02:54.720> into<00:02:54.959> the<00:02:55.140> arrangement<00:02:55.709> so<00:02:55.890> we

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
know walking into the arrangement so we

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.870 
know walking into the arrangement so we
didn't<00:02:56.250> really<00:02:56.720> foresee<00:02:57.720> all<00:02:57.989> the<00:02:58.140> benefits

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
didn't really foresee all the benefits

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.069 
didn't really foresee all the benefits
her<00:02:59.880> you<00:03:00.030> know<00:03:00.120> our<00:03:00.180> initial<00:03:00.329> hope<00:03:00.660> was<00:03:00.840> just

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:01.079 
her you know our initial hope was just

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:03.380 
her you know our initial hope was just
to<00:03:01.260> make<00:03:01.440> her<00:03:01.650> a<00:03:01.860> stronger<00:03:02.370> person<00:03:02.820> in<00:03:02.970> a

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
to make her a stronger person in a

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.430 
to make her a stronger person in a
confrontation<00:03:05.269> so<00:03:06.269> much<00:03:06.420> more<00:03:06.600> than<00:03:06.780> that<00:03:06.810> yes

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
confrontation so much more than that yes

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.350 
confrontation so much more than that yes
we<00:03:07.709> could<00:03:07.980> have<00:03:08.100> done<00:03:08.220> nothing<00:03:08.400> but<00:03:08.549> actually

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
we could have done nothing but actually

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.780 
we could have done nothing but actually
I<00:03:09.709> think<00:03:10.709> when<00:03:10.950> you<00:03:11.010> have<00:03:11.070> a<00:03:11.130> child<00:03:11.370> you<00:03:11.579> can't

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
I think when you have a child you can't

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.990 
I think when you have a child you can't
do<00:03:11.940> nothing<00:03:12.320> okay<00:03:13.320> I<00:03:13.739> think<00:03:14.609> when<00:03:14.700> you<00:03:14.820> have<00:03:14.970> a

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
do nothing okay I think when you have a

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000 
do nothing okay I think when you have a
child<00:03:15.269> you<00:03:15.630> don't<00:03:15.840> have<00:03:16.109> a<00:03:16.140> choice<00:03:16.530> to<00:03:16.859> do

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
child you don't have a choice to do

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.000 
child you don't have a choice to do
nothing<00:03:17.370> I<00:03:17.640> think<00:03:18.090> that<00:03:18.329> you<00:03:18.480> must<00:03:19.170> always<00:03:19.500> be

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
nothing I think that you must always be

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.710 
nothing I think that you must always be
searching<00:03:20.430> for<00:03:20.459> something<00:03:20.820> you<00:03:21.239> must<00:03:21.390> always

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
searching for something you must always

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.680 
searching for something you must always
be<00:03:22.109> moving<00:03:22.440> forward<00:03:23.000> finding<00:03:24.000> the<00:03:24.150> time<00:03:24.390> to<00:03:24.600> do

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
be moving forward finding the time to do

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.220 
be moving forward finding the time to do
something<00:03:25.109> I<00:03:26.030> think<00:03:27.030> doing<00:03:27.630> nothing<00:03:27.989> just

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
something I think doing nothing just

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:38.599 
something I think doing nothing just
sitting<00:03:28.410> there<00:03:28.470> is<00:03:29.040> not<00:03:29.340> an<00:03:30.239> option<00:03:37.609> it's

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:38.609 
sitting there is not an option it's

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:40.699 
sitting there is not an option it's
important<00:03:39.060> to<00:03:39.180> know<00:03:39.359> what<00:03:39.840> drives<00:03:40.079> you<00:03:40.440> and

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
important to know what drives you and

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:43.460 
important to know what drives you and
the<00:03:41.310> voices<00:03:41.880> or<00:03:42.120> the<00:03:42.239> concepts<00:03:42.810> that<00:03:43.200> drive

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
the voices or the concepts that drive

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.800 
the voices or the concepts that drive
you<00:03:43.769> and<00:03:44.519> once<00:03:44.730> you<00:03:44.880> are<00:03:45.060> aware<00:03:45.209> of<00:03:45.359> that<00:03:45.510> you
