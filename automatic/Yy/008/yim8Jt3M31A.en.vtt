you zone them after you showing blitz

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.410 
you zone them after you showing blitz
they<00:01:36.039> will<00:01:36.189> both<00:01:36.310> occupy<00:01:36.759> the<00:01:36.820> same<00:01:37.060> spot<00:01:37.390> on

next thing i like to do is bring down

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:50.310 
next thing i like to do is bring down
both<00:01:47.829> safeties<00:01:48.340> what<00:01:49.119> this<00:01:49.329> does<00:01:49.689> in<00:01:49.960> effect

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
both safeties what this does in effect

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.050 
both safeties what this does in effect
is<00:01:50.499> it<00:01:50.649> makes<00:01:50.829> it<00:01:50.950> look<00:01:51.159> like<00:01:51.189> you're<00:01:51.460> running

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
is it makes it look like you're running

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.389 
is it makes it look like you're running
man<00:01:52.420> blitz<00:01:52.780> coverage<00:01:53.249> hopefully<00:01:54.249> it<00:01:54.340> will

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399 
man blitz coverage hopefully it will

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:56.130 
man blitz coverage hopefully it will
cause<00:01:54.609> your<00:01:54.789> opponent<00:01:55.179> to<00:01:55.329> block<00:01:55.719> a<00:01:55.749> running

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
running back or you could just use the

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.130 
running back or you could just use the
free<00:02:21.460> safety<00:02:21.670> as<00:02:22.060> a<00:02:22.090> whole<00:02:22.390> and<00:02:22.660> take<00:02:22.930> away

from those inside path leads rendering
it<00:02:43.630> almost<00:02:43.990> useless<00:02:44.470> and<00:02:44.980> stupid<00:02:45.010> for<00:02:45.850> your

go there so we saw that hag picked the
time<00:02:51.640> pass<00:02:51.880> leave<00:02:52.210> there<00:02:52.480> let's<00:02:52.930> say<00:02:53.080> that

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
time pass leave there let's say that

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.140 
time pass leave there let's say that
we've<00:02:53.410> gone<00:02:53.620> ahead<00:02:53.770> and<00:02:53.920> decided<00:02:54.820> that<00:02:55.030> we

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
we've gone ahead and decided that we

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.650 
we've gone ahead and decided that we
want<00:02:55.360> to<00:02:55.450> just<00:02:56.640> place<00:02:57.640> hag<00:02:57.970> in<00:02:58.180> a<00:02:58.270> different

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
want to just place hag in a different

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.650 
want to just place hag in a different
zone<00:02:59.070> and<00:03:00.070> let's<00:03:00.790> say<00:03:00.940> that<00:03:00.970> we're<00:03:01.330> attacking

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
zone and let's say that we're attacking

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.730 
zone and let's say that we're attacking
with<00:03:02.380> whips<00:03:02.740> or<00:03:02.980> out<00:03:03.160> routes<00:03:03.460> as<00:03:03.670> well<00:03:03.700> so<00:03:04.740> for

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:05.740 
with whips or out routes as well so for

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.920 
with whips or out routes as well so for
the<00:03:05.830> sake<00:03:05.980> of<00:03:06.040> this<00:03:06.250> play<00:03:06.780> we're<00:03:07.780> going<00:03:07.870> to

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
the sake of this play we're going to

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.210 
the sake of this play we're going to
take<00:03:08.140> away<00:03:08.440> Anquan<00:03:08.980> Boldin<00:03:09.210> who's<00:03:10.210> running<00:03:10.600> a

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
take away Anquan Boldin who's running a

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.450 
take away Anquan Boldin who's running a
route<00:03:12.220> to<00:03:12.400> the<00:03:12.490> outside<00:03:13.170> so<00:03:14.170> all<00:03:14.800> we<00:03:15.100> have<00:03:15.130> in

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:15.460 
route to the outside so all we have in

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:17.330 
route to the outside so all we have in
the<00:03:15.520> middle<00:03:15.820> are<00:03:16.030> these<00:03:16.150> two<00:03:16.390> linebackers

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
the middle are these two linebackers

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.100 
the middle are these two linebackers
they<00:03:18.340> still<00:03:18.820> if<00:03:19.060> they<00:03:19.240> have<00:03:19.330> enough<00:03:19.390> speed<00:03:19.900> and

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
they still if they have enough speed and

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:21.930 
they still if they have enough speed and
awareness<00:03:20.590> but<00:03:20.860> as<00:03:21.220> you<00:03:21.340> know<00:03:21.460> here<00:03:21.700> we've<00:03:21.910> got

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
awareness but as you know here we've got

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.510 
awareness but as you know here we've got
the<00:03:22.380> Browns<00:03:23.380> caloocan<00:03:23.920> boy<00:03:24.070> bow<00:03:24.280> and<00:03:24.490> I

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:24.520 
the Browns caloocan boy bow and I

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.040 
the Browns caloocan boy bow and I
believe<00:03:24.730> that's<00:03:24.820> to<00:03:25.030> quell<00:03:25.240> Jax<00:03:25.600> and<00:03:25.810> don't

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.050 
believe that's to quell Jax and don't

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:27.390 
believe that's to quell Jax and don't
really<00:03:26.200> have<00:03:26.410> a<00:03:26.440> whole<00:03:26.710> lot<00:03:26.740> of<00:03:26.920> speed<00:03:27.250> and

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
really have a whole lot of speed and

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.450 
really have a whole lot of speed and
awareness<00:03:27.820> but<00:03:28.060> they're<00:03:28.750> still<00:03:28.840> gonna<00:03:29.110> be

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:29.460 
awareness but they're still gonna be

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:33.240 
awareness but they're still gonna be
pretty<00:03:30.460> efficient<00:03:30.970> at<00:03:31.060> stopping<00:03:31.360> these<00:03:32.250> these

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
pretty efficient at stopping these these

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.280 
pretty efficient at stopping these these
routes<00:03:33.580> well<00:03:33.940> actually<00:03:34.360> it<00:03:34.690> would<00:03:34.840> help<00:03:34.960> if<00:03:35.110> I

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
routes well actually it would help if I

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.670 
routes well actually it would help if I
throw<00:03:36.250> the<00:03:36.870> seams<00:03:37.870> down<00:03:38.020> the<00:03:38.260> middle<00:03:38.410> so

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
throw the seams down the middle so

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.110 
throw the seams down the middle so
having<00:03:39.010> those<00:03:39.100> crossing<00:03:39.520> patterns<00:03:39.850> so<00:03:39.970> let's

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
having those crossing patterns so let's

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.460 
having those crossing patterns so let's
try<00:03:40.300> that<00:03:40.420> a<00:03:40.480> kid<00:03:41.130> we<00:03:42.130> place<00:03:42.340> hag<00:03:42.580> in<00:03:42.760> the<00:03:43.470> bud

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
try that a kid we place hag in the bud

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.800 
try that a kid we place hag in the bud
zone<00:03:44.580> so<00:03:45.580> we're<00:03:45.970> taking<00:03:46.090> away<00:03:46.390> that<00:03:46.570> route

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
zone so we're taking away that route

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.030 
zone so we're taking away that route
we're<00:03:47.020> going<00:03:47.140> to<00:03:47.200> go<00:03:47.290> ahead<00:03:47.320> and<00:03:47.530> use<00:03:47.650> a<00:03:47.680> reward

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
we're going to go ahead and use a reward

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.790 
we're going to go ahead and use a reward
here<00:03:48.310> on<00:03:48.430> this<00:03:48.550> side<00:03:48.820> with<00:03:49.030> the<00:03:49.120> running<00:03:49.300> back

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:49.800 
here on this side with the running back

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.870 
here on this side with the running back
you're<00:03:50.800> in<00:03:50.890> an<00:03:50.980> us<00:03:51.100> the<00:03:51.250> linebackers<00:03:51.730> do<00:03:51.850> a

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 
you're in an us the linebackers do a

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.050 
you're in an us the linebackers do a
pretty<00:03:52.180> good<00:03:52.270> job<00:03:52.420> at<00:03:53.460> taking<00:03:54.460> away<00:03:54.880> the

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
pretty good job at taking away the

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.790 
pretty good job at taking away the
middle<00:03:55.210> of<00:03:55.330> the<00:03:55.420> field<00:03:55.600> forcing<00:03:56.230> you<00:03:56.350> to<00:03:56.500> throw

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:56.800 
middle of the field forcing you to throw

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.310 
middle of the field forcing you to throw
to<00:03:56.860> the<00:03:57.130> outside<00:03:57.550> and<00:03:57.990> the<00:03:58.990> alignment

00:03:59.310 --> 00:03:59.320 
to the outside and the alignment

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.730 
to the outside and the alignment
pre-snap<00:03:59.830> has<00:04:00.340> our<00:04:01.060> db's<00:04:01.630> shaded<00:04:02.290> the<00:04:02.410> outside

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:02.740 
pre-snap has our db's shaded the outside

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.950 
pre-snap has our db's shaded the outside
maybe<00:04:03.130> even<00:04:03.430> head<00:04:03.640> up<00:04:03.790> on<00:04:03.970> the<00:04:04.090> the<00:04:04.360> wide

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:04.960 
maybe even head up on the the wide

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.790 
maybe even head up on the the wide
receiver<00:04:05.290> so<00:04:05.650> it's<00:04:06.100> a<00:04:06.220> tough<00:04:06.490> throw<00:04:06.760> to<00:04:06.880> make

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:07.800 
receiver so it's a tough throw to make

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.660 
receiver so it's a tough throw to make
the<00:04:08.800> middle<00:04:09.040> of<00:04:09.100> the<00:04:09.160> field<00:04:09.310> has<00:04:09.490> just

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
the middle of the field has just

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.630 
the middle of the field has just
rendered<00:04:09.970> completely<00:04:10.890> you<00:04:11.890> can't<00:04:12.280> throw<00:04:12.490> to

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 
rendered completely you can't throw to

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.540 
rendered completely you can't throw to
it<00:04:12.780> so<00:04:13.780> what<00:04:14.110> if<00:04:14.200> your<00:04:14.320> opponent<00:04:14.530> is<00:04:14.770> not<00:04:15.070> using

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:15.550 
it so what if your opponent is not using

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:17.610 
it so what if your opponent is not using
bunch<00:04:15.790> what<00:04:16.419> if<00:04:16.539> they<00:04:16.690> go<00:04:16.900> I'm<00:04:17.140> sorry<00:04:17.410> what

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
bunch what if they go I'm sorry what

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.380 
bunch what if they go I'm sorry what
they're<00:04:17.769> not<00:04:17.890> using<00:04:18.040> snubs<00:04:18.430> they<00:04:19.030> just<00:04:19.209> want

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:19.390 
they're not using snubs they just want

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:22.260 
they're not using snubs they just want
to<00:04:19.450> have<00:04:19.750> you<00:04:20.200> no<00:04:20.320> one<00:04:20.700> seemed<00:04:21.700> threat<00:04:22.060> on<00:04:22.180> the

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
to have you no one seemed threat on the

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:23.700 
to have you no one seemed threat on the
field<00:04:22.450> let's<00:04:22.690> say<00:04:22.810> they<00:04:22.960> run

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
field let's say they run

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.210 
field let's say they run
bunch<00:04:25.720> this<00:04:26.720> defense<00:04:27.140> still<00:04:27.470> works<00:04:27.740> and<00:04:28.040> it's

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
bunch this defense still works and it's

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.550 
bunch this defense still works and it's
actually<00:04:28.550> very<00:04:28.580> flexible<00:04:29.240> defense<00:04:29.600> so<00:04:29.900> I'll

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
actually very flexible defense so I'll

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.040 
actually very flexible defense so I'll
show<00:04:30.740> you<00:04:30.830> this<00:04:30.950> here<00:04:31.570> setup<00:04:32.570> is<00:04:32.630> very<00:04:32.720> much

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
show you this here setup is very much

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.440 
show you this here setup is very much
the<00:04:33.200> same<00:04:33.350> you<00:04:33.650> would<00:04:33.860> still<00:04:34.070> zone<00:04:34.430> the<00:04:35.090> guy<00:04:35.270> on

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450 
the same you would still zone the guy on

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.240 
the same you would still zone the guy on
the<00:04:35.570> side<00:04:35.720> that<00:04:35.780> you<00:04:36.140> think<00:04:36.410> is<00:04:36.560> a<00:04:36.590> threat<00:04:37.010> and

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
the side that you think is a threat and

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.100 
the side that you think is a threat and
if<00:04:37.970> you<00:04:38.090> fear<00:04:38.480> that<00:04:38.510> they're<00:04:38.840> going<00:04:38.930> to<00:04:38.990> throw

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
if you fear that they're going to throw

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.320 
if you fear that they're going to throw
a<00:04:39.200> corner<00:04:39.560> out<00:04:39.680> there<00:04:39.890> you've<00:04:40.190> still<00:04:40.580> got<00:04:40.940> two

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
a corner out there you've still got two

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.230 
a corner out there you've still got two
guys<00:04:41.510> rushing<00:04:42.050> if<00:04:42.260> you<00:04:42.440> want<00:04:42.650> to<00:04:42.880> place<00:04:43.880> your<00:04:44.060> d

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
guys rushing if you want to place your d

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.360 
guys rushing if you want to place your d
end<00:04:44.420> in<00:04:44.570> a<00:04:44.630> buzz<00:04:44.810> own<00:04:45.050> I<00:04:45.290> recommend<00:04:45.830> having<00:04:46.160> the

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
end in a buzz own I recommend having the

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.880 
end in a buzz own I recommend having the
more<00:04:46.580> athletic<00:04:46.720> lineman<00:04:47.720> in<00:04:47.870> the<00:04:48.620> D<00:04:48.770> in

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:48.890 
more athletic lineman in the D in

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:50.590 
more athletic lineman in the D in
position<00:04:49.400> such<00:04:49.670> that<00:04:49.700> they<00:04:50.000> can<00:04:50.180> cover<00:04:50.390> as

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:50.600 
position such that they can cover as

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.480 
position such that they can cover as
well<00:04:50.780> so<00:04:51.620> what<00:04:51.890> you're<00:04:52.040> going<00:04:52.130> to<00:04:52.220> do<00:04:52.370> is

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490 
well so what you're going to do is

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.040 
well so what you're going to do is
basically<00:04:53.270> just<00:04:53.660> take<00:04:54.230> away<00:04:54.560> the<00:04:54.740> deep<00:04:54.980> seam

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
basically just take away the deep seam

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.500 
basically just take away the deep seam
with<00:04:57.050> the<00:04:58.010> help<00:04:58.220> of<00:04:58.310> the<00:04:58.430> linebacker<00:04:58.880> if<00:04:59.390> you

00:04:59.500 --> 00:04:59.510 
with the help of the linebacker if you

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:01.450 
with the help of the linebacker if you
see<00:04:59.690> anything<00:04:59.990> cross<00:05:00.620> the<00:05:00.920> middle<00:05:01.190> that<00:05:01.400> is

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
see anything cross the middle that is

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.330 
see anything cross the middle that is
your<00:05:01.760> responsibility<00:05:02.450> to<00:05:02.480> jump<00:05:02.930> it<00:05:03.080> so<00:05:03.620> let's

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:04.340 
your responsibility to jump it so let's

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.090 
your responsibility to jump it so let's
say<00:05:04.460> they<00:05:04.640> run<00:05:04.820> something<00:05:05.240> like<00:05:05.930> this<00:05:06.260> they're

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:07.100 
say they run something like this they're

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:08.080 
say they run something like this they're
going<00:05:07.220> to<00:05:07.280> look<00:05:07.400> to<00:05:07.520> throw<00:05:07.670> the<00:05:07.790> seam<00:05:07.940> to

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.090 
going to look to throw the seam to

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:10.770 
going to look to throw the seam to
bouldin<00:05:08.510> then<00:05:09.020> the<00:05:09.230> corner<00:05:09.500> out<00:05:09.710> to<00:05:09.890> Jones<00:05:10.250> and

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780 
bouldin then the corner out to Jones and

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.450 
bouldin then the corner out to Jones and
then<00:05:11.780> looked<00:05:12.170> across<00:05:12.410> the<00:05:12.680> middle<00:05:12.920> be<00:05:13.010> Dixit

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460 
then looked across the middle be Dixit

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:18.280 
then looked across the middle be Dixit
and<00:05:15.040> assuming<00:05:16.040> that<00:05:16.190> I<00:05:16.220> have<00:05:16.550> four<00:05:17.540> hands<00:05:17.930> you

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:18.290 
and assuming that I have four hands you

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:19.990 
and assuming that I have four hands you
would<00:05:18.410> see<00:05:18.590> how<00:05:18.740> would<00:05:18.920> take<00:05:19.100> away<00:05:19.340> the<00:05:19.550> inside

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 
would see how would take away the inside

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.150 
would see how would take away the inside
throw<00:05:20.210> to<00:05:20.360> bouldin<00:05:20.750> the<00:05:21.470> corner<00:05:21.800> route<00:05:21.950> is

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.160 
throw to bouldin the corner route is

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.430 
throw to bouldin the corner route is
gone<00:05:22.400> and<00:05:22.700> then<00:05:23.240> both<00:05:23.450> those<00:05:23.660> cross<00:05:23.930> patterns

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:24.440 
gone and then both those cross patterns

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:27.190 
gone and then both those cross patterns
i<00:05:24.620> would<00:05:24.770> jump<00:05:25.040> those<00:05:25.250> as<00:05:25.430> well<00:05:25.900> pretty<00:05:26.900> good

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:27.200 
i would jump those as well pretty good

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.920 
i would jump those as well pretty good
coverage<00:05:27.890> you<00:05:28.490> would<00:05:28.580> have<00:05:28.640> to<00:05:28.700> assume

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:28.930 
coverage you would have to assume
