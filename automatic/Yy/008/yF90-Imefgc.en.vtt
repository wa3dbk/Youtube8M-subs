00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
that they deserve and I think if they

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.759 
that they deserve and I think if they
thought<00:02:42.519> of<00:02:42.670> them<00:02:42.820> more<00:02:43.090> as<00:02:43.150> creatures<00:02:43.840> of<00:02:44.470> God

and<00:02:45.190> if<00:02:45.310> they<00:02:45.430> spayed<00:02:45.730> and<00:02:45.760> neutered<00:02:45.970> I<00:02:46.300> think

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
and if they spayed and neutered I think

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.570 
and if they spayed and neutered I think
we<00:02:46.750> could<00:02:46.930> take<00:02:47.140> bring<00:02:47.440> this<00:02:47.590> under<00:02:48.250> control
