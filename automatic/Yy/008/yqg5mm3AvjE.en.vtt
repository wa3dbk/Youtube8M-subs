00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.020
 with the snipers so here is a little meadow 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.610
 jousting nice so you'll see some 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.930
 tripe quads ends I tell you 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.899
 no more fifth place we start 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.789
 gently with fz6 ti with his little 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.410
 50 experts attention the clip can 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.539
 to get there it will make us simply 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.649
 we'll see the insertion potions 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.000
 tactical the game just started 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.780
 so it's going to be just that parties 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.970
 who have just started 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.840
 he will make us a little colada for 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.570
 start here 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.830
 and he'll make us a simple so he 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.220
 when I was eating to you to start 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.860
 a part 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.110
 it's very good in fourth place on 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.240
 is with Jordan 74 with his ballista 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.520
 so the same pre-chaptelat souls 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.220
 watch it will make us a little 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.720
 column and a simple wahlberg that is going 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.770
 to get frankly gg to you at the 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.229
 third place we end up with 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.460
 chaotic with the 50 and I can you 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.000
 to say that he really deserves his 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.070
 third place 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.350
 I would have preferred anyway 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.790
 little bit higher but I think that a 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.260
 Third place is not bad 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.180
 So here you will see will look 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:45.320
 we make a very small hair bug we 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:48.230
 chain with a 1 4 mpi so here 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.400
 frankly I have you guy at the second 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:49.940

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.050

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.210
 at the second phase in this case work 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.220
 Shooters with his expert 50 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.090

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.840
 always arise 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.100
 always in this place on the map here 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.440

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.400
