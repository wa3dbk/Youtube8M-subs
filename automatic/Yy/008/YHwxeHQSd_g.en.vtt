hello again welcome to a dsr parole with
me<00:00:20.619> Mike<00:00:21.190> Smith<00:00:21.580> and<00:00:22.650> what<00:00:23.650> we're<00:00:23.800> going<00:00:23.830> to<00:00:24.040> do

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:24.160 
me Mike Smith and what we're going to do

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.420 
me Mike Smith and what we're going to do
today<00:00:24.370> is<00:00:24.520> just<00:00:24.880> set<00:00:25.840> up<00:00:25.990> a<00:00:26.230> basic<00:00:26.590> drum<00:00:27.220> buss

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:27.430 
today is just set up a basic drum buss

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.590 
today is just set up a basic drum buss
and<00:00:28.320> apply<00:00:29.320> some<00:00:29.680> parallel<00:00:30.610> or<00:00:30.850> New<00:00:31.570> York

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:31.600 
and apply some parallel or New York

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.560 
and apply some parallel or New York
compression<00:00:32.610> a<00:00:33.610> very<00:00:34.210> simple

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:34.570 
compression a very simple

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.490 
compression a very simple
straightforward<00:00:34.960> so<00:00:35.770> let's<00:00:36.579> start<00:00:36.879> by

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
straightforward so let's start by

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.640 
straightforward so let's start by
creating<00:00:38.500> a<00:00:39.600> bunch<00:00:40.600> of<00:00:40.660> audio<00:00:40.930> tracks<00:00:41.230> let's

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:41.650 
creating a bunch of audio tracks let's

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:48.540 
creating a bunch of audio tracks let's
create<00:00:41.920> four<00:00:44.579> ok<00:00:45.780> will<00:00:46.780> also<00:00:47.320> create<00:00:47.739> a<00:00:48.160> group

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:48.550 
create four ok will also create a group

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:55.110 
create four ok will also create a group
to<00:00:49.120> root<00:00:49.930> them<00:00:50.110> to<00:00:50.290> so<00:00:50.620> f<00:00:50.890> for<00:00:51.870> ad<00:00:52.870> group<00:00:54.120> stereo

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.120 
to root them to so f for ad group stereo

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.549 
to root them to so f for ad group stereo
group<00:00:55.510> in<00:00:55.870> fact<00:00:56.200> we'll<00:00:56.380> add<00:00:56.500> to<00:00:58.200> sort<00:00:59.200> and

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
group in fact we'll add to sort and

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:07.499 
group in fact we'll add to sort and
we'll<00:00:59.980> call<00:01:00.160> one<00:01:03.449> drum<00:01:04.449> buss<00:01:04.659> and<00:01:06.270> we'll<00:01:07.270> call

00:01:07.499 --> 00:01:07.509 
we'll call one drum buss and we'll call

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:16.020 
we'll call one drum buss and we'll call
this<00:01:07.540> one<00:01:07.960> and<00:01:08.880> why<00:01:12.840> compression<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:15.490> lot<00:01:15.999> of

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
this one and why compression a lot of

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.719 
this one and why compression a lot of
people<00:01:16.119> seem<00:01:16.719> to<00:01:16.749> get<00:01:16.990> mixed<00:01:17.350> up<00:01:17.490> New<00:01:18.490> York

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:18.729 
people seem to get mixed up New York

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:21.059 
people seem to get mixed up New York
compression<00:01:19.299> and<00:01:19.509> parallel<00:01:20.259> compression<00:01:20.619> add

00:01:21.059 --> 00:01:21.069 
compression and parallel compression add

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:24.199 
compression and parallel compression add
the<00:01:21.399> same<00:01:21.670> thing<00:01:22.319> Sachin<00:01:23.319> compression<00:01:23.920> is<00:01:24.100> a

00:01:24.199 --> 00:01:24.209 
the same thing Sachin compression is a

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:27.120 
the same thing Sachin compression is a
completely<00:01:25.209> different<00:01:25.689> entity<00:01:26.380> we've<00:01:26.950> gone

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
completely different entity we've gone

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.160 
completely different entity we've gone
into<00:01:27.369> those<00:01:27.520> videos<00:01:27.880> previously<00:01:28.479> saw<00:01:28.749> check

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
into those videos previously saw check

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.789 
into those videos previously saw check
out<00:01:29.319> my<00:01:29.469> youtube<00:01:29.649> page<00:01:30.100> for<00:01:30.369> those<00:01:31.560> so<00:01:32.560> yeah

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:32.799 
out my youtube page for those so yeah

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:36.209 
out my youtube page for those so yeah
that's<00:01:33.069> it<00:01:33.929> all<00:01:34.929> right<00:01:35.079> let's<00:01:35.380> offer<00:01:35.590> the<00:01:35.770> pool

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:36.219 
that's it all right let's offer the pool

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:40.709 
that's it all right let's offer the pool
ctrl<00:01:36.880> +<00:01:37.029> P<00:01:37.060> I've<00:01:38.049> already<00:01:38.409> got<00:01:39.209> some<00:01:40.209> loops<00:01:40.450> in

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:40.719 
ctrl + P I've already got some loops in

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:46.919 
ctrl + P I've already got some loops in
here<00:01:41.109> let's<00:01:41.469> just<00:01:41.590> drag<00:01:42.310> these<00:01:42.609> in<00:01:45.719> we've<00:01:46.719> got

00:01:46.919 --> 00:01:46.929 
here let's just drag these in we've got

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:51.390 
here let's just drag these in we've got
sort

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:51.400 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.400 

ok<00:01:52.400> so<00:01:53.330> lets<00:01:53.540> just<00:01:53.690> hear<00:01:53.900> them<00:01:54.080> all<00:01:54.200> together

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:54.410 
ok so lets just hear them all together

00:01:54.410 --> 00:02:01.630 
ok so lets just hear them all together
and<00:01:54.680> get<00:01:59.710> pretty<00:02:00.710> straightforward<00:02:01.340> fall<00:02:01.520> to

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
and get pretty straightforward fall to

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.090 
and get pretty straightforward fall to
the<00:02:01.760> floor<00:02:01.790> loop<00:02:02.650> what<00:02:03.650> we<00:02:03.740> shall<00:02:03.920> do

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
the floor loop what we shall do

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.100 
the floor loop what we shall do
initially<00:02:04.990> is<00:02:06.520> i<00:02:07.520> mean<00:02:07.580> we<00:02:07.850> can<00:02:08.030> name<00:02:08.840> them

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
initially is i mean we can name them

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:21.810 
initially is i mean we can name them
kick<00:02:12.940> float<00:02:13.940> one<00:02:17.050> loop<00:02:18.050> two<00:02:18.700> and<00:02:19.840> luke<00:02:20.840> three

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
kick float one loop two and luke three

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.730 
kick float one loop two and luke three
so<00:02:22.820> initially<00:02:23.060> what<00:02:23.660> we'll<00:02:23.810> do<00:02:23.960> is<00:02:24.260> we'll<00:02:24.410> send

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
so initially what we'll do is we'll send

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:29.800 
so initially what we'll do is we'll send
the<00:02:25.190> loops<00:02:25.430> to<00:02:26.090> the<00:02:26.570> drum<00:02:27.020> buss<00:02:27.170> so<00:02:28.480> at<00:02:29.480> the<00:02:29.570> top

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
the loops to the drum buss so at the top

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.170 
the loops to the drum buss so at the top
where<00:02:30.200> we<00:02:30.470> can<00:02:30.620> route<00:02:30.830> our<00:02:31.100> audio<00:02:31.580> instead<00:02:32.150> of

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
where we can route our audio instead of

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.730 
where we can route our audio instead of
it<00:02:32.330> going<00:02:32.360> to<00:02:32.600> the<00:02:32.690> stereo<00:02:33.050> out<00:02:33.230> which<00:02:33.440> is<00:02:33.590> the

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
it going to the stereo out which is the

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.520 
it going to the stereo out which is the
master<00:02:34.130> will<00:02:34.910> route<00:02:35.150> it<00:02:35.300> to<00:02:35.330> the<00:02:35.510> group<00:02:35.720> drum

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
master will route it to the group drum

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:44.790 
master will route it to the group drum
buss<00:02:37.480> group<00:02:38.830> drumble's<00:02:40.030> group<00:02:42.850> rumbles<00:02:43.850> and

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
buss group drumble's group rumbles and

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:53.440 
buss group drumble's group rumbles and
effectively<00:02:45.800> now<00:02:46.010> if<00:02:46.130> we<00:02:46.250> saw<00:02:46.460> law<00:02:46.520> that<00:02:52.450> let's

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
effectively now if we saw law that let's

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.090 
effectively now if we saw law that let's
call<00:02:53.750> it<00:02:53.870> up<00:02:53.960> differently<00:02:54.380> so<00:02:54.650> you<00:02:54.709> can<00:02:54.860> see

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
call it up differently so you can see

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:00.430 
call it up differently so you can see
it's<00:02:55.250> an<00:02:55.340> hour<00:02:55.459> mix<00:02:55.640> it<00:02:58.450> so<00:02:59.450> they<00:02:59.600> go<00:02:59.840> all<00:03:00.050> the

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
it's an hour mix it so they go all the

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.430 
it's an hour mix it so they go all the
percussion<00:03:00.860> elements<00:03:01.280> are<00:03:01.880> now<00:03:02.060> added<00:03:02.510> to<00:03:02.990> the

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
percussion elements are now added to the

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.190 
percussion elements are now added to the
drum<00:03:03.650> boss<00:03:03.850> so<00:03:04.850> if<00:03:05.060> we<00:03:05.150> go<00:03:05.270> into<00:03:05.420> there<00:03:05.720> will

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
drum boss so if we go into there will

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.229 
drum boss so if we go into there will
maybe<00:03:06.440> add<00:03:06.920> a<00:03:07.310> little<00:03:07.550> bit<00:03:07.790> of<00:03:08.770> compression

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
maybe add a little bit of compression

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:15.640 
maybe add a little bit of compression
I'll<00:03:11.239> just<00:03:11.420> use<00:03:11.570> a<00:03:11.600> cubase<00:03:12.140> one<00:03:14.170> quite<00:03:15.170> a<00:03:15.200> slow

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
I'll just use a cubase one quite a slow

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.170 
I'll just use a cubase one quite a slow
attack<00:03:15.800> a<00:03:16.400> slow<00:03:17.209> release<00:03:18.610> we'll<00:03:19.610> put<00:03:19.850> that<00:03:19.880> on

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
attack a slow release we'll put that on

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:34.099 
attack a slow release we'll put that on
peak

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:34.109 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:36.780 

now<00:03:35.109> we've<00:03:35.230> got<00:03:35.409> just<00:03:35.739> two<00:03:35.920> sorts<00:03:36.249> of<00:03:36.340> jet<00:03:36.579> laws

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
now we've got just two sorts of jet laws

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:48.899 
now we've got just two sorts of jet laws
a<00:03:36.819> little<00:03:37.209> bit<00:03:40.739> to<00:03:41.739> bring<00:03:41.889> the<00:03:41.980> kick<00:03:42.159> in<00:03:47.909> so

00:03:48.899 --> 00:03:48.909 
a little bit to bring the kick in so

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:51.270 
a little bit to bring the kick in so
that's<00:03:49.299> that's<00:03:49.540> basically<00:03:50.049> the<00:03:50.409> percussion

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
that's that's basically the percussion

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.949 
that's that's basically the percussion
routed<00:03:51.939> to<00:03:52.389> a<00:03:52.719> group<00:03:54.209> just<00:03:55.209> call<00:03:55.419> those<00:03:55.629> so<00:03:55.900> you

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
routed to a group just call those so you

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.800 
routed to a group just call those so you
can<00:03:56.079> see<00:03:56.260> what<00:03:56.349> we're<00:03:56.499> doing<00:03:57.569> so<00:03:58.569> there's<00:03:58.750> your

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
can see what we're doing so there's your

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.140 
can see what we're doing so there's your
percussion<00:03:59.230> elements<00:03:59.560> they're<00:04:00.340> all<00:04:00.549> these

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
percussion elements they're all these

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.390 
percussion elements they're all these
three<00:04:01.480> elements<00:04:01.569> are<00:04:01.959> then<00:04:02.200> routed<00:04:02.680> into<00:04:03.159> this

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
three elements are then routed into this

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.640 
three elements are then routed into this
drum<00:04:03.669> buss<00:04:03.849> so<00:04:04.269> we<00:04:04.419> have<00:04:04.569> control<00:04:05.049> layer<00:04:05.319> the

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
drum buss so we have control layer the

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.530 
drum buss so we have control layer the
beauty<00:04:05.980> of<00:04:06.040> that<00:04:06.069> as<00:04:06.340> you<00:04:06.819> can<00:04:07.000> see<00:04:07.209> we<00:04:07.389> can

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
beauty of that as you can see we can

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.379 
beauty of that as you can see we can
apply<00:04:07.719> compression<00:04:08.129> reverb<00:04:09.129> etc<00:04:09.669> what<00:04:10.299> we're

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:10.389 
apply compression reverb etc what we're

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:14.580 
apply compression reverb etc what we're
going<00:04:10.510> to<00:04:10.629> do<00:04:10.719> now<00:04:10.989> is<00:04:13.049> parallel<00:04:14.049> or<00:04:14.230> New<00:04:14.560> York

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
going to do now is parallel or New York

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.180 
going to do now is parallel or New York
compression<00:04:15.570> so<00:04:16.570> what<00:04:17.229> we'll<00:04:17.380> do<00:04:17.590> is<00:04:17.799> we'll

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
compression so what we'll do is we'll

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.930 
compression so what we'll do is we'll
actually<00:04:18.400> route<00:04:19.060> the<00:04:20.019> drumble's<00:04:20.500> out<00:04:20.940> into

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
actually route the drumble's out into

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.870 
actually route the drumble's out into
another<00:04:22.870> group<00:04:23.139> which<00:04:23.560> is<00:04:23.770> our<00:04:23.949> NY

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
another group which is our NY

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.219 
another group which is our NY
compression<00:04:26.610> turn<00:04:27.610> that<00:04:27.729> on<00:04:27.789> and<00:04:28.150> we'll<00:04:29.050> put

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:29.229 
compression turn that on and we'll put

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:34.110 
compression turn that on and we'll put
that<00:04:29.380> 20<00:04:29.830> DB<00:04:30.580> initially<00:04:32.400> bring<00:04:33.400> that<00:04:33.550> down<00:04:33.759> and

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
that 20 DB initially bring that down and

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.990 
that 20 DB initially bring that down and
what<00:04:34.720> we'll<00:04:34.840> do<00:04:35.020> is<00:04:35.259> if<00:04:35.680> we<00:04:35.830> go<00:04:35.979> on<00:04:36.099> to<00:04:36.220> the<00:04:36.250> NY

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
what we'll do is if we go on to the NY

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.110 
what we'll do is if we go on to the NY
compressor<00:04:37.509> channel<00:04:38.190> we<00:04:39.190> will<00:04:39.370> then<00:04:39.580> add<00:04:39.789> a

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
compressor channel we will then add a

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.240 
compressor channel we will then add a
compressor<00:04:40.780> I'll<00:04:41.139> just<00:04:41.380> use<00:04:41.560> the<00:04:41.740> inbuilt

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 
compressor I'll just use the inbuilt

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.790 
compressor I'll just use the inbuilt
cubist<00:04:42.699> one<00:04:42.849> again<00:04:43.120> now<00:04:43.990> what<00:04:44.199> we'll<00:04:44.380> do<00:04:44.560> with

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
cubist one again now what we'll do with

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.640 
cubist one again now what we'll do with
this<00:04:45.009> is<00:04:45.250> will<00:04:45.789> go<00:04:45.970> massively<00:04:46.630> over<00:04:47.289> the<00:04:47.409> top

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 
this is will go massively over the top

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.820 
this is will go massively over the top
will<00:04:48.570> squash<00:04:49.570> the<00:04:49.930> living<00:04:50.199> daylights<00:04:50.620> out<00:04:50.770> of

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
will squash the living daylights out of

00:04:50.830 --> 00:05:12.850 
will squash the living daylights out of
it<00:04:51.099> and<00:04:53.880> see

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.469 

now<00:05:13.860> you<00:05:13.919> can<00:05:14.219> obviously<00:05:14.370> see<00:05:14.849> there<00:05:15.120> there's

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:15.479 
now you can obviously see there there's

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:19.670 
now you can obviously see there there's
a<00:05:15.599> massive<00:05:16.289> amount<00:05:16.560> again<00:05:16.830> reduction<00:05:18.469> so<00:05:19.469> now

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 
a massive amount again reduction so now

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:32.749 
a massive amount again reduction so now
if<00:05:19.889> I<00:05:19.949> slowly<00:05:20.250> bring<00:05:20.490> this<00:05:20.580> back<00:05:20.789> up<00:05:31.699> there<00:05:32.699> you

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:32.759 
if I slowly bring this back up there you

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:36.980 
if I slowly bring this back up there you
go<00:05:32.879> you<00:05:32.969> can<00:05:33.120> really<00:05:35.270> really<00:05:36.270> hear<00:05:36.539> the<00:05:36.659> squash

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:36.990 
go you can really really hear the squash

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:46.730 
go you can really really hear the squash
ones<00:05:37.289> there<00:05:43.639> now<00:05:44.639> the<00:05:45.000> idea<00:05:45.120> the<00:05:46.110> idea<00:05:46.139> really

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.740 
ones there now the idea the idea really

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.369 
ones there now the idea the idea really
there<00:05:47.099> is<00:05:47.370> is<00:05:47.789> for<00:05:48.120> you<00:05:48.270> to<00:05:48.300> use<00:05:48.599> your<00:05:48.629> your

there is is for you to use your your

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:52.059 
there is is for you to use your your
ears<00:05:49.680> and<00:05:49.770> decide<00:05:50.550> what's<00:05:51.029> nice<00:05:51.300> for<00:05:51.569> you

ears and decide what's nice for you

00:05:52.069 --> 00:05:55.040 
ears and decide what's nice for you
obviously<00:05:53.069> this<00:05:53.250> is<00:05:53.460> just<00:05:53.819> a<00:05:53.969> quick<00:05:54.300> quick

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.050 
obviously this is just a quick quick

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:57.260 
obviously this is just a quick quick
tutorial<00:05:55.740> just<00:05:55.979> to<00:05:56.129> to<00:05:56.550> show<00:05:56.729> you<00:05:56.789> how<00:05:57.000> to<00:05:57.060> do

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:57.270 
tutorial just to to show you how to do

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:59.629 
tutorial just to to show you how to do
the<00:05:57.419> routine<00:05:57.659> more<00:05:57.990> than<00:05:58.139> anything<00:05:58.319> and<00:05:58.680> of

00:05:59.629 --> 00:05:59.639 
the routine more than anything and of

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:01.939 
the routine more than anything and of
course<00:05:59.669> all<00:06:00.029> you<00:06:00.270> can't<00:06:00.479> pressure<00:06:00.949> compressor

00:06:01.939 --> 00:06:01.949 
course all you can't pressure compressor

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:04.040 
course all you can't pressure compressor
settings<00:06:02.550> could<00:06:02.879> be<00:06:03.029> altered<00:06:03.479> to<00:06:03.509> suit<00:06:03.659> your

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:04.050 
settings could be altered to suit your

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.980 
settings could be altered to suit your
taste<00:06:04.349> what<00:06:05.219> I<00:06:05.250> tend<00:06:05.580> to<00:06:05.669> do<00:06:05.849> is<00:06:06.180> I<00:06:06.479> have<00:06:06.719> a<00:06:06.750> nice

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:06.990 
taste what I tend to do is I have a nice

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:08.600 
taste what I tend to do is I have a nice
drumble<00:06:07.469> so<00:06:07.710> have<00:06:07.889> them<00:06:08.039> sounding<00:06:08.430> really

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:08.610 
drumble so have them sounding really

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:10.730 
drumble so have them sounding really
nice<00:06:08.940> and<00:06:09.240> tight<00:06:09.479> and<00:06:09.690> clean<00:06:09.900> a<00:06:09.960> play<00:06:10.409> a<00:06:10.440> little

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:10.740 
nice and tight and clean a play a little

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:12.589 
nice and tight and clean a play a little
bit<00:06:10.919> of<00:06:11.009> compression<00:06:11.370> and<00:06:11.759> reverb<00:06:12.150> on<00:06:12.300> there

00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:12.599 
bit of compression and reverb on there

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:15.019 
bit of compression and reverb on there
and<00:06:12.810> then<00:06:13.589> on<00:06:13.770> the<00:06:13.860> New<00:06:14.039> York<00:06:14.279> compressor<00:06:14.849> I'll

00:06:15.019 --> 00:06:15.029 
and then on the New York compressor I'll

00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:18.860 
and then on the New York compressor I'll
slam<00:06:15.509> it<00:06:15.690> really<00:06:16.169> really<00:06:16.500> hard<00:06:16.969> and<00:06:17.969> then<00:06:18.300> just

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:18.870 
slam it really really hard and then just

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:21.589 
slam it really really hard and then just
bring<00:06:19.050> up<00:06:19.289> enough<00:06:19.770> of<00:06:19.889> it<00:06:20.039> to<00:06:20.069> suit<00:06:20.460> and<00:06:20.759> the

00:06:21.589 --> 00:06:21.599 
bring up enough of it to suit and the

00:06:21.599 --> 00:06:23.089 
bring up enough of it to suit and the
beauty<00:06:21.930> of<00:06:22.020> that<00:06:22.080> is<00:06:22.199> you<00:06:22.469> tend<00:06:22.710> to<00:06:22.770> get<00:06:22.919> all

00:06:23.089 --> 00:06:23.099 
beauty of that is you tend to get all

00:06:23.099 --> 00:06:25.159 
beauty of that is you tend to get all
the<00:06:23.310> the<00:06:23.849> transients<00:06:24.509> and<00:06:24.810> the<00:06:24.960> really

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:25.169 
the the transients and the really

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:27.950 
the the transients and the really
squashed<00:06:25.800> elements<00:06:26.430> and<00:06:26.639> you<00:06:27.180> can<00:06:27.629> get<00:06:27.810> them

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:27.960 
squashed elements and you can get them

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.320 
squashed elements and you can get them
to<00:06:27.990> just<00:06:28.349> brighten<00:06:29.250> up<00:06:29.370> and<00:06:29.610> thicken<00:06:29.849> up<00:06:30.120> the

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:30.330 
to just brighten up and thicken up the

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:33.499 
to just brighten up and thicken up the
whole<00:06:30.539> drums<00:06:31.729> New<00:06:32.729> York<00:06:32.969> compression<00:06:33.419> or

00:06:33.499 --> 00:06:33.509 
whole drums New York compression or

00:06:33.509 --> 00:06:35.290 
whole drums New York compression or
parallel<00:06:33.870> compression<00:06:34.169> doesn't<00:06:34.710> have<00:06:34.949> to<00:06:35.129> be

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:35.300 
parallel compression doesn't have to be

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:38.600 
parallel compression doesn't have to be
specifically<00:06:36.300> just<00:06:36.599> on<00:06:36.839> drums<00:06:37.169> either<00:06:37.650> of

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:38.610 
specifically just on drums either of

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:41.320 
specifically just on drums either of
course<00:06:38.939> you<00:06:39.120> can<00:06:39.300> do<00:06:39.419> it<00:06:39.539> on<00:06:39.659> vocals<00:06:40.349> or<00:06:40.710> since

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:41.330 
course you can do it on vocals or since

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:44.290 
course you can do it on vocals or since
you<00:06:42.330> know<00:06:42.449> it<00:06:42.509> took<00:06:43.139> to<00:06:43.259> you<00:06:43.379> personal<00:06:43.889> taste

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:44.300 
you know it took to you personal taste

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.939 
you know it took to you personal taste
my<00:06:45.300> one<00:06:45.509> recommendation<00:06:45.870> would<00:06:46.500> be<00:06:46.560> not<00:06:46.919> to

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:46.949 
my one recommendation would be not to

00:06:46.949 --> 00:06:49.519 
my one recommendation would be not to
parallel<00:06:47.520> compress<00:06:48.000> everything<00:06:48.379> because<00:06:49.379> it

00:06:49.519 --> 00:06:49.529 
parallel compress everything because it

00:06:49.529 --> 00:06:52.790 
parallel compress everything because it
sounds<00:06:50.009> too<00:06:50.419> too<00:06:51.419> much<00:06:51.449> too<00:06:51.930> overbearing<00:06:52.349> but

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:52.800 
sounds too too much too overbearing but

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.670 
sounds too too much too overbearing but
it<00:06:53.129> works<00:06:53.460> fantastic<00:06:53.819> on<00:06:54.449> drums<00:06:54.689> and<00:06:54.930> really

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:55.680 
it works fantastic on drums and really

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:59.920 
it works fantastic on drums and really
nice<00:06:55.830> on<00:06:56.009> vocals<00:06:57.199> so<00:06:58.400> just<00:06:59.400> to<00:06:59.490> recap

00:06:59.920 --> 00:06:59.930 
nice on vocals so just to recap

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:02.450 
nice on vocals so just to recap
initially<00:07:00.930> we<00:07:01.110> created<00:07:01.589> a<00:07:01.830> few<00:07:02.310> audio

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:02.460 
initially we created a few audio

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:04.820 
initially we created a few audio
channels<00:07:03.000> the<00:07:03.990> percussion<00:07:04.439> ones<00:07:04.589> are<00:07:04.740> in

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:04.830 
channels the percussion ones are in

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:07.850 
channels the percussion ones are in
orange<00:07:05.069> here<00:07:05.370> we<00:07:06.060> then<00:07:06.270> routed<00:07:06.599> those<00:07:07.020> to<00:07:07.620> a

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:07.860 
orange here we then routed those to a

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:10.159 
orange here we then routed those to a
group<00:07:08.370> channel<00:07:08.789> which<00:07:09.479> were<00:07:09.630> created<00:07:10.050> by

00:07:10.159 --> 00:07:10.169 
group channel which were created by

00:07:10.169 --> 00:07:12.379 
group channel which were created by
pressing<00:07:10.529> f4<00:07:10.919> we<00:07:11.550> created<00:07:11.969> a<00:07:12.060> couple<00:07:12.300> of

00:07:12.379 --> 00:07:12.389 
pressing f4 we created a couple of

00:07:12.389 --> 00:07:13.060 
pressing f4 we created a couple of
groups

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:13.070 
groups

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:16.220 
groups
named<00:07:14.070> them<00:07:14.280> drum<00:07:14.490> boss<00:07:14.669> and<00:07:14.910> NY<00:07:15.720> compression

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:16.230 
named them drum boss and NY compression

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:18.890 
named them drum boss and NY compression
so<00:07:17.160> we<00:07:17.310> routed<00:07:17.639> the<00:07:17.850> three<00:07:18.300> percussion<00:07:18.720> ones

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:18.900 
so we routed the three percussion ones

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:21.710 
so we routed the three percussion ones
into<00:07:19.320> the<00:07:19.410> drum<00:07:19.620> buss<00:07:19.770> we<00:07:20.639> applied<00:07:20.910> some<00:07:21.210> basic

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:21.720 
into the drum buss we applied some basic

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:25.700 
into the drum buss we applied some basic
effects<00:07:22.080> there<00:07:22.410> and<00:07:22.650> then<00:07:23.639> value<00:07:24.270> the<00:07:24.419> send<00:07:24.720> we
