gorgeous I didn't read it for the

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.310 
gorgeous I didn't read it for the
longest<00:01:38.579> time<00:01:38.789> and<00:01:39.149> I<00:01:39.359> don't<00:01:39.420> know<00:01:39.840> why<00:01:39.990> I<00:01:40.020> put

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
longest time and I don't know why I put

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.660 
longest time and I don't know why I put
it<00:01:40.439> off<00:01:40.590> because<00:01:40.859> it<00:01:41.640> was<00:01:42.539> just<00:01:42.899> so<00:01:43.280> lovely<00:01:44.280> and

even<00:01:46.530> better<00:01:46.560> on<00:01:47.039> reflection<00:01:47.460> so<00:01:47.880> that's

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
even better on reflection so that's

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.499 
even better on reflection so that's
number<00:01:48.240> one

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
number one

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.270 
number one
