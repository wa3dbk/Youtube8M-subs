00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:17.549
 the world 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:21.389
 television was in Switzerland so he knew from his insides the 

00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:23.109
 fascinating world of the c 

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:24.049
 the cern 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:26.969
 it's about recreating the implant from the beginning of the universe 

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:29.389
 to congratulate 

00:02:29.389 --> 00:02:32.949
 It is a structure of great proportions located 100 meters under

 that crosses three countries

 susupuato to two scientists 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.370
 have been of great importance to better understand the moment of 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:41.369
 creation

 and now for the world of fiction 

00:02:48.779 --> 00:02:50.109
 bergara 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:52.209
 mauro 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.750
 for it the tape was shot mostly in the city of Rome 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.200
 and because of the forecasts by the Vatican to shoot in any church 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.519
 Roman the team decides to continue the recordings in the sony studios 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:04.929
 in Los Angeles 

00:03:04.929 --> 00:03:08.449
 but how to shoot a film set mostly in the Vatican 

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:14.689
 as videographers posing as tourists manage to capture more than 250 thousand 

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:18.439
 enough material images so that those responsible for the aspects 

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:22.089
 special reconstruct faithfully fringe has added 

00:03:33.779 --> 00:03:36.779
 archaga 

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:41.479
 a dye none of the main themes that the movie angels deals with and 

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:45.219
 demons the ancient struggle that has always existed between science and religion 

00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:48.700
 for centuries scientists have tried to understand 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.370
 many aspects of our world none of them at the time of creation 

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:58.299
 when a little atco 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:01.879
 throughout the film the nature of the banks is sometimes discussed 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:05.249
 some way since the beginning of civilization both the church and the 

00:04:05.249 --> 00:04:09.940
 science tried to decipher this enigma of the human being angels and demons is 

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:12.730
 a less controversial story than the code da vinci 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.509
 but not so much since again the church functions as the main character 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:21.150
 this movie will surely raise as much dust as its predecessor did 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.999
 in a civil society life between historical rigor and science 

00:04:24.999 --> 00:04:27.999
 fiction
