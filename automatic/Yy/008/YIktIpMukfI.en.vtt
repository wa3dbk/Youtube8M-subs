00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
which is where the floating rib is and

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.499 

proper<00:01:54.950> out<00:01:55.100> this<00:01:55.250> one<00:01:55.430> that<00:01:55.610> was<00:01:55.790> pretty<00:01:56.329> much

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
proper out this one that was pretty much

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:58.420 
proper out this one that was pretty much
sharp<00:01:57.079> on<00:01:57.320> to<00:01:57.470> the<00:01:57.590> year<00:01:57.680> that<00:01:57.920> was<00:01:58.100> as<00:01:58.280> well

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
sharp on to the year that was as well

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:59.740 
sharp on to the year that was as well
which<00:01:58.610> would<00:01:58.729> take<00:01:58.880> his<00:01:59.030> equilibrium<00:01:59.390> and

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
which would take his equilibrium and

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:07.800 
which would take his equilibrium and
take<00:01:59.899> them<00:02:00.079> down

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.630 

yes<00:02:08.810> actually<00:02:09.350> this<00:02:09.709> little<00:02:09.860> procedure<00:02:10.280> as

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
yes actually this little procedure as

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:17.660 
yes actually this little procedure as
well

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:28.160 

you're<00:02:18.670> on<00:02:18.760> it<00:02:20.130> was<00:02:21.130> it<00:02:22.290> mad

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:34.080 

they<00:02:29.170> build<00:02:29.410> floors<00:02:30.060> probably<00:02:31.060> I<00:02:32.880> think<00:02:33.880> it

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
they build floors probably I think it

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
they build floors probably I think it
was<00:02:34.180> more<00:02:34.270> because<00:02:34.420> I<00:02:34.630> punched<00:02:34.900> you<00:02:34.930> in<00:02:35.050> the

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
was more because I punched you in the

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.350 
was more because I punched you in the
year
