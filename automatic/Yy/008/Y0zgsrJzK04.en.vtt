the dresser but you can figure that it's
wood<00:00:31.410> so<00:00:32.189> basically<00:00:32.579> what<00:00:32.730> I've<00:00:32.850> done<00:00:32.969> is<00:00:33.120> I

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
wood so basically what I've done is I

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.170 
wood so basically what I've done is I
sand<00:00:34.050> it<00:00:34.200> down<00:00:34.230> clear<00:00:35.070> down<00:00:35.250> to<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.550> original

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
sand it down clear down to the original

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.650 
sand it down clear down to the original
wood

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
wood

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.729 
wood
I<00:00:36.930> used<00:00:37.940> they<00:00:38.940> actually<00:00:39.300> used<00:00:39.480> 180<00:00:39.960> then<00:00:40.559> I

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
I used they actually used 180 then I

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.060 
I used they actually used 180 then I
finished<00:00:41.100> up<00:00:41.280> with<00:00:41.430> 220<00:00:42.149> and<00:00:42.360> then<00:00:43.320> cleaned<00:00:43.950> it

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
finished up with 220 and then cleaned it

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
primer hardener ESU 439 again these are

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.260 
primer hardener ESU 439 again these are
one-to-one<00:01:29.400> so<00:01:29.640> you're<00:01:29.759> going<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:29.939> mix<00:01:30.090> them

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
one-to-one so you're going to mix them

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.469 
one-to-one so you're going to mix them
equal<00:01:30.960> parts<00:01:31.320> alright<00:01:32.250> that's<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.090> epoxy

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
equal parts alright that's the epoxy

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.149 
equal parts alright that's the epoxy
primer<00:01:33.750> going<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:34.470> put<00:01:34.560> that<00:01:34.710> on<00:01:34.860> you're<00:01:35.070> going

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
primer going to put that on you're going

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.800 
primer going to put that on you're going
to<00:01:35.250> let<00:01:35.400> it<00:01:35.430> dry

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
to let it dry

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.930 
to let it dry
in<00:01:37.410> between<00:01:37.710> codes<00:01:37.950> course<00:01:38.310> probably<00:01:38.640> 15

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
in between codes course probably 15

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.240 
in between codes course probably 15
minutes<00:01:39.090> or<00:01:39.330> so<00:01:39.480> in<00:01:40.230> between<00:01:40.530> coach<00:01:40.740> coding<00:01:41.160> on

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
minutes or so in between coach coding on

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.610 
minutes or so in between coach coding on
your<00:01:41.430> on<00:01:42.360> your<00:01:42.630> temperature<00:01:42.900> I've<00:01:43.110> got<00:01:43.290> 70

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:43.620 
your on your temperature I've got 70

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:44.990 
your on your temperature I've got 70
degrees<00:01:43.920> in<00:01:44.100> here<00:01:44.190> so<00:01:44.430> it<00:01:44.640> drives<00:01:44.790> pretty

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
degrees in here so it drives pretty

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.210 
degrees in here so it drives pretty
