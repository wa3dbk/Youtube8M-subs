have a relationship with a place or a
time<00:00:35.110> is<00:00:35.770> through<00:00:36.070> my<00:00:36.220> art<00:00:36.750> my<00:00:37.750> body<00:00:37.960> painting

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350 
time is through my art my body painting

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.460 
time is through my art my body painting
is<00:00:38.410> what<00:00:38.590> I<00:00:38.620> do<00:00:39.010> all<00:00:39.040> the<00:00:39.370> time<00:00:39.750> so<00:00:40.750> by<00:00:41.170> bringing

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:41.470 
is what I do all the time so by bringing

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.319 
is what I do all the time so by bringing
my<00:00:41.649> my<00:00:41.980> art<00:00:42.190> here<00:00:42.460> it's<00:00:42.670> sort<00:00:42.910> of<00:00:42.970> my<00:00:43.149> way<00:00:43.180> of

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:43.329 
my my art here it's sort of my way of

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:46.080 
my my art here it's sort of my way of
really<00:00:44.140> connecting<00:00:44.290> to<00:00:44.680> it<00:00:44.829> when<00:00:45.670> I<00:00:45.700> make<00:00:45.910> the

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:46.090 
really connecting to it when I make the

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.389 
really connecting to it when I make the
art<00:00:46.270> I<00:00:46.510> don't<00:00:46.930> very<00:00:47.649> often<00:00:47.920> when<00:00:48.010> I<00:00:48.070> do<00:00:48.130> body

00:00:48.389 --> 00:00:48.399 
art I don't very often when I do body

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:50.069 
art I don't very often when I do body
painting<00:00:48.670> I<00:00:48.880> feed<00:00:49.300> off<00:00:49.329> the<00:00:49.570> energy<00:00:49.600> of<00:00:49.930> the

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:50.079 
painting I feed off the energy of the

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:52.740 
painting I feed off the energy of the
model<00:00:50.410> to<00:00:50.739> inspire<00:00:51.130> the<00:00:51.579> art<00:00:51.790> what<00:00:52.270> energy<00:00:52.690> are

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:52.750 
model to inspire the art what energy are

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.650 
model to inspire the art what energy are
you<00:00:52.870> getting<00:00:53.079> from<00:00:53.230> her<00:00:54.149> well<00:00:55.149> you<00:00:55.300> know<00:00:55.420> I<00:00:55.450> was

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:55.660 
you getting from her well you know I was

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.450 
you getting from her well you know I was
originally<00:00:55.989> gonna<00:00:56.079> start<00:00:56.410> off<00:00:56.559> with<00:00:56.590> red<00:00:57.040> but

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460 
originally gonna start off with red but

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.569 
originally gonna start off with red but
uh<00:00:57.489> you<00:00:58.329> know<00:00:58.450> and<00:00:59.020> then<00:00:59.320> I<00:00:59.469> felt<00:01:00.160> like<00:01:00.309> the<00:01:00.460> red

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:00.579 
uh you know and then I felt like the red

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:02.700 
uh you know and then I felt like the red
was<00:01:00.789> too<00:01:00.910> hard<00:01:01.149> so<00:01:01.420> I<00:01:01.660> just<00:01:02.050> took<00:01:02.170> the<00:01:02.320> red<00:01:02.500> and

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
was too hard so I just took the red and

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.679 
was too hard so I just took the red and
I<00:01:02.770> just<00:01:03.010> sort<00:01:03.219> of<00:01:03.340> you<00:01:03.610> know<00:01:03.850> toned<00:01:04.180> it<00:01:04.329> down<00:01:04.360> so

00:01:04.679 --> 00:01:04.689 
I just sort of you know toned it down so

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:06.570 
I just sort of you know toned it down so
I<00:01:04.750> think<00:01:04.839> to<00:01:05.470> the<00:01:05.500> to<00:01:06.040> the<00:01:06.130> extent<00:01:06.400> of<00:01:06.490> the

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.580 
I think to the to the extent of the

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.719 
I think to the to the extent of the
color<00:01:06.790> it<00:01:07.000> was<00:01:07.119> you<00:01:07.630> know<00:01:07.720> fire<00:01:08.260> but<00:01:08.680> but<00:01:09.280> a<00:01:09.310> you

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729 
color it was you know fire but but a you

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:11.430 
color it was you know fire but but a you
know<00:01:09.820> a<00:01:09.850> little<00:01:10.030> bit<00:01:10.180> more<00:01:10.360> of<00:01:10.510> a<00:01:10.659> fire<00:01:11.409> that

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:11.440 
know a little bit more of a fire that

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.440 
know a little bit more of a fire that
you<00:01:11.650> can<00:01:11.830> feel<00:01:12.040> with<00:01:12.159> your<00:01:12.250> hands<00:01:12.520> almost<00:01:12.820> the

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
you can feel with your hands almost the

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.480 
you can feel with your hands almost the
other<00:01:13.479> thing<00:01:13.810> is<00:01:13.930> is<00:01:14.110> that<00:01:14.140> you<00:01:15.040> know<00:01:15.130> painting

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
other thing is is that you know painting

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.609 
other thing is is that you know painting
in<00:01:15.580> this<00:01:15.670> kind<00:01:15.880> of<00:01:15.909> environment<00:01:16.180> there's<00:01:16.659> so

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:17.619 
in this kind of environment there's so

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:19.440 
in this kind of environment there's so
much<00:01:17.740> energy<00:01:17.920> and<00:01:18.460> a<00:01:18.670> lot<00:01:18.820> of<00:01:18.850> that<00:01:19.030> energy<00:01:19.060> is

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
much energy and a lot of that energy is

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.039 
much energy and a lot of that energy is
about<00:01:19.659> empowerment<00:01:20.080> and<00:01:20.409> so<00:01:20.920> I<00:01:21.369> feel<00:01:21.820> that<00:01:22.049> my

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:23.049 
about empowerment and so I feel that my

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:26.010 
about empowerment and so I feel that my
work<00:01:23.310> is<00:01:24.310> definitely<00:01:24.610> inspired<00:01:25.180> by<00:01:25.420> a<00:01:25.720> large

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
work is definitely inspired by a large

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.080 
work is definitely inspired by a large
extent<00:01:26.380> not<00:01:26.770> just<00:01:27.040> occupied<00:01:27.520> but<00:01:27.729> the<00:01:27.880> the

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
extent not just occupied but the the

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.010 
extent not just occupied but the the
strength<00:01:28.330> that<00:01:28.450> it<00:01:28.570> takes<00:01:28.720> for<00:01:28.840> a<00:01:28.900> lot<00:01:28.990> of

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
strength that it takes for a lot of

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.570 
strength that it takes for a lot of
people<00:01:29.320> to<00:01:29.409> be<00:01:29.500> sure<00:01:29.619> are<00:01:29.950> you<00:01:30.040> getting<00:01:30.369> more

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580 
people to be sure are you getting more

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.240 
people to be sure are you getting more
of<00:01:30.700> the<00:01:30.790> energy<00:01:31.150> from<00:01:31.450> the<00:01:32.110> crowd<00:01:32.439> or<00:01:32.799> from<00:01:33.070> her

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
of the energy from the crowd or from her

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.190 
of the energy from the crowd or from her
your<00:01:33.580> model<00:01:33.880> I<00:01:34.180> think<00:01:34.540> that<00:01:34.689> energy<00:01:35.049> is

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
your model I think that energy is

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.179 
your model I think that energy is
something<00:01:35.350> that's<00:01:35.650> sort<00:01:35.830> of<00:01:35.890> it's<00:01:36.040> almost

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:36.189 
something that's sort of it's almost

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:38.010 
something that's sort of it's almost
like<00:01:36.369> sunlight<00:01:36.790> it<00:01:37.030> sort<00:01:37.509> of<00:01:37.600> like<00:01:37.720> kind<00:01:37.900> of

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
like sunlight it sort of like kind of

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.899 
like sunlight it sort of like kind of
flows<00:01:38.229> all<00:01:38.530> around<00:01:38.830> I<00:01:39.040> think<00:01:39.250> a<00:01:39.430> lot<00:01:39.700> of<00:01:39.729> the

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 
flows all around I think a lot of the

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:41.399 
flows all around I think a lot of the
energy<00:01:40.030> of<00:01:40.270> the<00:01:40.360> model<00:01:40.630> is<00:01:40.780> inspired<00:01:41.170> by<00:01:41.259> the

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409 
energy of the model is inspired by the

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:43.859 
energy of the model is inspired by the
crowd<00:01:41.710> and<00:01:42.189> so<00:01:42.670> I<00:01:42.939> think<00:01:43.240> that<00:01:43.509> there's<00:01:43.689> a<00:01:43.750> lot

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
crowd and so I think that there's a lot

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:45.690 
crowd and so I think that there's a lot
of<00:01:44.020> things<00:01:44.200> that<00:01:44.320> flow<00:01:44.560> through<00:01:44.770> when<00:01:45.340> I<00:01:45.369> paint

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
of things that flow through when I paint

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.069 
of things that flow through when I paint
they<00:01:45.850> turn<00:01:46.060> out<00:01:46.119> to<00:01:46.180> be<00:01:46.299> so<00:01:46.540> conscious<00:01:46.960> of

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:47.079 
they turn out to be so conscious of

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:50.249 
they turn out to be so conscious of
exactly<00:01:47.530> no<00:01:48.460> knowing<00:01:49.030> why<00:01:49.509> I<00:01:49.540> painted<00:01:50.110> this

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:50.259 
exactly no knowing why I painted this

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:51.990 
exactly no knowing why I painted this
line<00:01:50.500> or<00:01:50.770> why<00:01:50.920> I<00:01:50.950> painted<00:01:51.369> that<00:01:51.520> line<00:01:51.790> or

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
line or why I painted that line or

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.850 
line or why I painted that line or
what's<00:01:52.150> the<00:01:52.240> source<00:01:52.509> of<00:01:52.659> it<00:01:52.780> as<00:01:53.140> much<00:01:53.380> as<00:01:53.560> kind

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
what's the source of it as much as kind

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.530 
what's the source of it as much as kind
of<00:01:53.920> just<00:01:54.130> opening<00:01:54.759> up<00:01:54.880> that<00:01:55.060> part<00:01:55.299> of<00:01:55.390> my<00:01:55.479> brain

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
of just opening up that part of my brain

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:56.710 
of just opening up that part of my brain
and<00:01:55.900> just<00:01:56.020> kind<00:01:56.170> of<00:01:56.229> letting<00:01:56.409> the<00:01:56.500> are

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
and just kind of letting the are

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.900 
and just kind of letting the are
go<00:01:56.840> through<00:01:57.110> have<00:01:57.590> you<00:01:57.740> done<00:01:57.920> participated<00:01:58.850> in

helping to bring out that message I
think<00:02:23.210> very<00:02:23.960> much<00:02:24.230> so<00:02:24.290> for<00:02:24.680> a<00:02:24.740> number<00:02:25.010> of

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
think very much so for a number of

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.410 
think very much so for a number of
reasons<00:02:25.160> we've<00:02:25.640> had<00:02:25.760> a<00:02:25.790> lot<00:02:25.970> of<00:02:26.060> people<00:02:26.270> come

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
reasons we've had a lot of people come

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.610 
reasons we've had a lot of people come
up<00:02:26.450> and<00:02:26.630> say<00:02:26.720> you're<00:02:26.930> distracting<00:02:27.440> from<00:02:27.530> the

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
up and say you're distracting from the

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.100 
up and say you're distracting from the
cause<00:02:27.890> and<00:02:28.430> all<00:02:28.520> sorts<00:02:28.910> of<00:02:29.000> statements<00:02:29.300> and<00:02:29.690> I

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
cause and all sorts of statements and I

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.449 
cause and all sorts of statements and I
understand<00:02:30.560> where<00:02:30.709> they're<00:02:30.830> coming<00:02:30.860> from<00:02:31.190> I

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
understand where they're coming from I

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:33.820 
understand where they're coming from I
really<00:02:31.790> do<00:02:31.940> it's<00:02:32.209> a<00:02:32.420> complaint<00:02:33.230> I've<00:02:33.350> had<00:02:33.560> at

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
really do it's a complaint I've had at

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.370 
really do it's a complaint I've had at
other<00:02:34.100> you<00:02:34.790> know<00:02:34.910> conferences<00:02:35.570> and<00:02:35.810> protests

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
other you know conferences and protests

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.290 
other you know conferences and protests
that<00:02:36.440> there<00:02:36.590> have<00:02:36.770> been<00:02:36.800> but<00:02:37.670> I<00:02:37.700> think<00:02:37.940> part<00:02:38.180> of

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
that there have been but I think part of

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:39.670 
that there have been but I think part of
the<00:02:38.450> statement<00:02:38.870> is<00:02:38.930> the<00:02:39.020> fact<00:02:39.230> that<00:02:39.320> you<00:02:39.470> don't

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
the statement is the fact that you don't

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.370 
the statement is the fact that you don't
need<00:02:40.100> words<00:02:40.459> or<00:02:40.910> a<00:02:40.940> sign<00:02:41.270> to<00:02:41.630> express<00:02:41.959> yourself

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
need words or a sign to express yourself

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.070 
need words or a sign to express yourself
and<00:02:42.620> that<00:02:42.880> just<00:02:43.880> because<00:02:44.330> I<00:02:44.780> don't<00:02:44.840> have

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
and that just because I don't have

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.449 
and that just because I don't have
something<00:02:45.260> that<00:02:45.440> says<00:02:45.650> you<00:02:45.950> know<00:02:46.070> and<00:02:46.220> wall

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
something that says you know and wall

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:48.040 
something that says you know and wall
street<00:02:46.640> or<00:02:46.940> stuff<00:02:47.120> like<00:02:47.300> that<00:02:47.450> doesn't<00:02:47.780> mean

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
street or stuff like that doesn't mean

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:49.620 
street or stuff like that doesn't mean
that<00:02:48.200> there<00:02:48.380> isn't<00:02:48.500> a<00:02:48.680> statement<00:02:49.010> being<00:02:49.160> here

hasn't been the case so I think for me
the<00:03:12.890> statement<00:03:13.130> also<00:03:13.400> is<00:03:13.760> the<00:03:13.880> fact<00:03:14.120> that<00:03:14.209> I

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
the statement also is the fact that I

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.660 
the statement also is the fact that I
can<00:03:14.480> stand<00:03:14.720> out<00:03:14.930> here<00:03:15.170> and<00:03:15.500> express<00:03:15.860> myself<00:03:16.100> or

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
can stand out here and express myself or

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.030 
can stand out here and express myself or
in<00:03:16.970> this<00:03:17.239> case<00:03:17.510> be<00:03:17.690> the<00:03:17.720> canvas<00:03:18.050> that<00:03:18.650> is<00:03:18.830> being

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
in this case be the canvas that is being

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.000 
in this case be the canvas that is being
expressed<00:03:19.400> upon<00:03:19.850> and<00:03:20.380> it's<00:03:21.380> been<00:03:21.590> mostly<00:03:21.920> a

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
expressed upon and it's been mostly a

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:23.530 
expressed upon and it's been mostly a
positive<00:03:22.459> experience

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
really think of it that way I think it

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.939
