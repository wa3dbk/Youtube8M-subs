from<00:00:58.880> the<00:00:59.030> bias<00:00:59.270> can<00:00:59.600> be<00:00:59.630> used<00:00:59.930> to<00:01:00.140> slow<00:01:00.290> him

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:00.560 
from the bias can be used to slow him

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.220 
from the bias can be used to slow him
down<00:01:00.850> let's<00:01:01.850> take<00:01:02.120> a<00:01:02.150> closer<00:01:02.570> look<00:01:02.750> on<00:01:03.170> how

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:03.230 
down let's take a closer look on how

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.280 
down let's take a closer look on how
some<00:01:03.740> of<00:01:03.890> the<00:01:04.729> provided<00:01:05.360> vehicles<00:01:05.869> can<00:01:06.140> be

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
some of the provided vehicles can be

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.980 
some of the provided vehicles can be
used<00:01:08.920> the<00:01:09.920> main<00:01:10.159> purpose<00:01:10.700> of<00:01:10.850> the<00:01:11.180> bikes<00:01:11.420> is<00:01:11.720> to

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
used the main purpose of the bikes is to

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.140 
used the main purpose of the bikes is to
drop<00:01:12.230> tight<00:01:12.530> in<00:01:12.800> front<00:01:13.070> of<00:01:13.250> the<00:01:13.400> Leviathan<00:01:13.970> and

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
drop tight in front of the Leviathan and

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.900 
drop tight in front of the Leviathan and
thus<00:01:14.450> slow<00:01:14.840> him<00:01:15.050> down<00:01:15.080> a<00:01:15.560> good<00:01:16.160> way<00:01:16.310> of<00:01:16.340> doing

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:16.910 
thus slow him down a good way of doing

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.120 
thus slow him down a good way of doing
this<00:01:17.090> is<00:01:17.300> by<00:01:17.390> using<00:01:17.900> the<00:01:18.200> bikes<00:01:18.410> burst<00:01:18.890> of

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
this is by using the bikes burst of

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.190 
this is by using the bikes burst of
speed<00:01:19.250> to<00:01:19.910> get<00:01:20.090> in<00:01:20.300> front<00:01:20.570> of<00:01:20.750> a<00:01:20.840> followed
