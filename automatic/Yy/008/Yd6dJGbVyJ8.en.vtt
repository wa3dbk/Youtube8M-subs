hi<00:00:01.319> guys<00:00:01.530> so<00:00:01.709> this<00:00:01.740> is<00:00:01.920> my<00:00:02.040> new<00:00:02.340> quadcopter<00:00:03.030> as

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
hi guys so this is my new quadcopter as

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.740 
hi guys so this is my new quadcopter as
you<00:00:03.300> can<00:00:03.449> see<00:00:03.659> here<00:00:04.160> it's<00:00:05.160> a<00:00:05.460> Extron<00:00:06.060> mini<00:00:06.359> and

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
you can see here it's a Extron mini and

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.650 
you can see here it's a Extron mini and
it<00:00:07.740> cost<00:00:08.040> about<00:00:08.220> like<00:00:08.639> two<00:00:09.179> thousand<00:00:09.570> or

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
it cost about like two thousand or

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.490 
it cost about like two thousand or
something<00:00:10.019> and<00:00:10.230> here<00:00:10.860> is<00:00:10.980> its<00:00:11.160> controller<00:00:11.670> and

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:12.500 
something and here is its controller and

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.410 
something and here is its controller and
as<00:00:13.500> you<00:00:13.620> can<00:00:13.710> see<00:00:13.769> that<00:00:14.250> the<00:00:14.549> controller<00:00:15.000> has

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
as you can see that the controller has

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.880 
as you can see that the controller has
quite<00:00:15.750> quite<00:00:16.049> many<00:00:16.260> controls

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
quite quite many controls

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.060 
quite quite many controls
this<00:00:17.430> one<00:00:17.640> is<00:00:17.760> for<00:00:18.230> providing<00:00:19.230> acceleration

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
this one is for providing acceleration

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.730 
this one is for providing acceleration
so<00:00:20.369> by<00:00:21.060> using<00:00:21.600> this<00:00:21.930> upward<00:00:22.529> and<00:00:22.650> downward

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
so by using this upward and downward

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.000 
so by using this upward and downward
motion<00:00:23.670> you<00:00:23.730> can<00:00:23.939> control<00:00:24.510> altitude<00:00:25.019> and<00:00:25.260> the

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
motion you can control altitude and the

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.939 
motion you can control altitude and the
same<00:00:26.220> one<00:00:26.400> has<00:00:26.550> like<00:00:26.789> a<00:00:27.590> horizontal<00:00:28.590> movement

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
same one has like a horizontal movement

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.450 
same one has like a horizontal movement
as<00:00:29.070> well<00:00:29.250> so<00:00:29.429> it<00:00:29.670> can<00:00:29.820> be<00:00:29.939> used<00:00:30.150> for<00:00:30.449> app<00:00:31.460> for

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
as well so it can be used for app for

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.729 
as well so it can be used for app for
providing<00:00:32.759> rotation<00:00:33.480> on<00:00:33.600> on<00:00:33.809> its<00:00:34.350> own<00:00:34.559> axis

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
providing rotation on on its own axis

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.700 
providing rotation on on its own axis
this<00:00:35.610> one<00:00:35.790> is<00:00:35.910> called<00:00:36.059> left<00:00:36.329> right<00:00:36.710> forward

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
this one is called left right forward

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.920 
this one is called left right forward
backward<00:00:38.280> functionality<00:00:38.910> and<00:00:39.059> it<00:00:39.780> has<00:00:39.899> a

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
backward functionality and it has a

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.490 
backward functionality and it has a
couple<00:00:40.170> of<00:00:40.230> more<00:00:40.500> other<00:00:40.980> buttons<00:00:41.340> for<00:00:42.500> it's

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
couple of more other buttons for it's

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.220 
couple of more other buttons for it's
called<00:00:43.739> scrubbing<00:00:44.040> so<00:00:44.670> basically<00:00:45.390> it<00:00:45.899> can<00:00:46.110> be

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
called scrubbing so basically it can be

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.299 
called scrubbing so basically it can be
used<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:46.680> stabilize<00:00:46.860> Iraq<00:00:48.289> 24<00:00:49.289> segments<00:00:49.739> so

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
used to stabilize Iraq 24 segments so

00:00:50.309 --> 00:01:02.880 
used to stabilize Iraq 24 segments so
let's<00:00:50.489> start<00:00:55.910> applying<00:00:56.910> it<00:00:57.120> in<00:00:58.730> quite<00:00:59.730> nicely

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.090 

stasia<00:01:04.120> so<00:01:05.120> you<00:01:05.180> do<00:01:05.479> Gratiot<00:01:05.930> once<00:01:06.140> once<00:01:06.830> every

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
stasia so you do Gratiot once once every

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.930 
stasia so you do Gratiot once once every
day<00:01:07.250> once<00:01:07.550> and<00:01:07.729> why<00:01:08.740> it<00:01:09.740> looks<00:01:10.280> quite<00:01:10.550> sturdy

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:10.940 
day once and why it looks quite sturdy

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:46.040 
day once and why it looks quite sturdy
it<00:01:11.240> flies<00:01:11.510> right<00:01:11.780> though<00:01:15.430> from<00:01:16.430> the<00:01:16.610> sponsor

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.050 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.960 

so<00:01:47.050> I<00:01:47.440> just<00:01:47.890> can<00:01:48.040> see<00:01:48.280> some<00:01:48.580> time<00:01:48.760> right

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970 
so I just can see some time right

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.990 
so I just can see some time right
crashes<00:01:49.450> and<00:01:49.720> it's<00:01:50.560> rotors<00:01:51.460> get<00:01:51.640> disconnected

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
crashes and it's rotors get disconnected

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.560 
crashes and it's rotors get disconnected
itself<00:01:52.660> and<00:01:53.470> we<00:01:54.250> pop<00:01:54.490> it<00:01:54.670> down<00:01:55.680> nice<00:01:56.680> and<00:01:56.710> easy

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
itself and we pop it down nice and easy

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.690 
itself and we pop it down nice and easy
what<00:01:58.570> if<00:01:58.720> joy<00:01:58.900> is<00:01:59.170> once<00:01:59.410> once<00:01:59.830> of<00:02:00.130> our<00:02:00.400> orders

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
what if joy is once once of our orders

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.330 
what if joy is once once of our orders
comes<00:02:00.940> out<00:02:01.090> you<00:02:01.270> can<00:02:01.680> realize<00:02:02.680> itself<00:02:03.040> so

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
comes out you can realize itself so

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:11.160 
comes out you can realize itself so
videos<00:02:03.760> that<00:02:04.030> it's<00:02:04.390> cooler<00:02:04.780> than<00:02:09.990> we<00:02:10.990> have

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
videos that it's cooler than we have

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:34.980 
videos that it's cooler than we have
here<00:02:13.680> do<00:02:14.680> some<00:02:14.950> flips<00:02:16.170> try<00:02:17.170> that<00:02:33.690> let's<00:02:34.690> give

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
here do some flips try that let's give

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:39.740 
here do some flips try that let's give
it<00:02:35.020> another<00:02:35.140> try<00:02:35.940> put<00:02:36.940> in<00:02:37.060> Ricardian<00:02:37.690> plus<00:02:38.080> try

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
it another try put in Ricardian plus try

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:58.789 
it another try put in Ricardian plus try
connect<00:02:40.750> it<00:02:40.960> back

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:06.120 

powers<00:02:59.799> gone

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.760 

so<00:03:07.150> even<00:03:08.150> break<00:03:08.480> that<00:03:08.750> gets<00:03:08.989> batteries<00:03:09.440> as

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:09.770 
so even break that gets batteries as

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:46.910 
so even break that gets batteries as
went<00:03:10.160> down

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:57.509 

let's<00:03:47.920> stop

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:01.899 

so<00:03:58.519> to<00:03:58.640> make<00:03:58.879> sure<00:03:59.120> it<00:03:59.330> has<00:03:59.980> certain<00:04:00.980> HQ<00:04:01.549> before

00:04:01.899 --> 00:04:01.909 
so to make sure it has certain HQ before

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:03.780 
so to make sure it has certain HQ before
you<00:04:02.030> try<00:04:02.450> to<00:04:02.480> perform<00:04:02.959> those<00:04:03.110> flips<00:04:03.470> because

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
you try to perform those flips because

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.610 
you try to perform those flips because
when<00:04:04.790> when<00:04:04.970> out<00:04:05.120> it<00:04:05.269> preps<00:04:05.629> it<00:04:05.870> uses<00:04:06.349> so<00:04:06.500> much

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
when when out it preps it uses so much

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.970 
when when out it preps it uses so much
here<00:04:07.010> I<00:04:08.019> think<00:04:09.019> we<00:04:09.110> have<00:04:09.200> a<00:04:09.260> couple<00:04:09.680> of<00:04:09.769> more

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
here I think we have a couple of more

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.729 
here I think we have a couple of more
minutes<00:04:10.159> with<00:04:10.610> chills<00:04:11.260> buzzer<00:04:12.260> on<00:04:12.500> five

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:12.739 
minutes with chills buzzer on five

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:15.220 
minutes with chills buzzer on five
minutes<00:04:13.099> for<00:04:13.280> charge<00:04:13.610> and<00:04:14.540> then<00:04:14.659> we<00:04:14.780> lost<00:04:14.930> two

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
minutes for charge and then we lost two

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.020 
minutes for charge and then we lost two
of<00:04:15.409> the<00:04:15.560> rooters<00:04:15.890> so<00:04:16.220> we'll<00:04:16.489> have<00:04:16.609> to<00:04:16.790> find

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
of the rooters so we'll have to find

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:18.539 
of the rooters so we'll have to find
another<00:04:17.180> one

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
another one

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:23.200 
another one
it's<00:04:19.549> going<00:04:19.820> to<00:04:19.940> be<00:04:20.060> a<00:04:20.090> hard<00:04:20.410> task<00:04:21.410> so<00:04:21.829> I<00:04:22.210> think

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
it's going to be a hard task so I think

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.350 
it's going to be a hard task so I think
I<00:04:23.300> wish<00:04:23.690> should<00:04:23.870> end<00:04:24.020> this<00:04:24.199> video<00:04:24.410> right<00:04:24.770> here

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
I wish should end this video right here

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.500 
I wish should end this video right here
you<00:04:26.360> just<00:04:26.600> got<00:04:26.780> review<00:04:27.290> of<00:04:27.620> extra<00:04:28.340> mini<00:04:28.610> that

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
you just got review of extra mini that

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.890 
you just got review of extra mini that
it<00:04:29.720> comes<00:04:29.990> with<00:04:30.080> 2.4<00:04:30.740> gigahertz<00:04:31.510> controller

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
it comes with 2.4 gigahertz controller

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.020 
it comes with 2.4 gigahertz controller
they<00:04:33.050> have<00:04:33.199> camera<00:04:33.530> version<00:04:33.919> as<00:04:34.039> well<00:04:34.070> and<00:04:34.550> I

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
they have camera version as well and I

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.029
