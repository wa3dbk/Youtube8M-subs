we interrupt this program for an
important<00:00:01.410> yeah<00:00:05.180> why<00:00:06.180> is<00:00:06.240> my<00:00:06.540> ps4<00:00:06.839> not<00:00:07.500> reading

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890

important yeah why is my ps4 not reading
disks<00:00:08.370> I'm<00:00:09.210> assuming<00:00:09.719> you<00:00:09.840> actually<00:00:10.320> put<00:00:10.559> a

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
disks I'm assuming you actually put a

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.890 
disks I'm assuming you actually put a
disk<00:00:10.889> in<00:00:11.099> and<00:00:11.309> that<00:00:11.790> it<00:00:11.910> is<00:00:12.059> not<00:00:12.240> the<00:00:12.450> cleaning

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
disk in and that it is not the cleaning

disk in and that it is not the cleaning
disk<00:00:13.139> I<00:00:13.469> do<00:00:14.190> not<00:00:14.490> think<00:00:14.730> I<00:00:14.880> put<00:00:15.089> a<00:00:15.120> cleaning

the<00:00:18.240> first<00:00:18.510> solution<00:00:19.020> is<00:00:19.260> running<00:00:19.680> a<00:00:19.770> cleaning

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
the first solution is running a cleaning

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
or grimy it won't read the discs as long

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.980 
or grimy it won't read the discs as long
as<00:00:26.340> I<00:00:26.460> do<00:00:26.519> not<00:00:26.760> have<00:00:26.820> to<00:00:27.210> take<00:00:27.359> it<00:00:27.539> apart<00:00:27.840> to

as I do not have to take it apart to
dust<00:00:28.260> it<00:00:28.439> it'll<00:00:29.400> ruin<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.820> warranty<00:00:30.269> though

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
dust it it'll ruin the warranty though

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.510 
dust it it'll ruin the warranty though
it<00:00:30.869> does<00:00:31.019> not<00:00:31.170> hurt<00:00:31.470> to<00:00:31.679> vacuum<00:00:32.099> up<00:00:32.250> dust

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
it does not hurt to vacuum up dust

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
reinstall the software I've heard you

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.120 
reinstall the software I've heard you
could<00:01:41.670> rebuild<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.180> database<00:01:42.770> that's<00:01:43.770> the

could rebuild the database that's the

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.960 
could rebuild the database that's the
next<00:01:44.280> option

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
next option

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.600 
next option
well<00:01:45.329> maybe<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.259> last<00:01:46.470> option<00:01:46.799> on<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.430> list

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.039 
well maybe the last option on the list
after<00:01:48.170> doing<00:01:49.170> that<00:01:49.380> restart<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.220> ps4<00:01:50.430> I<00:01:51.149> did

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
after doing that restart the ps4 I did

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.249 
after doing that restart the ps4 I did
say<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.380> try<00:01:52.770> reinstalling<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.759> software<00:01:54.259> now
