00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.060
 study night you have to vote 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.640
 for nocturnal and so we will 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.529
 discover a little bit it's secret is 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:35.830
 why he appeared in the league of 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:35.830
 nighttime legends was designed by israel 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:43.040
 nocturnal is expressed by jason hristophe 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:45.260
 nocturnal is a Latin word derived from nox 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.559
 our little ones which means a night and 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:51.199
 nighttime us 1 to hull which means all 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:53.059
 evenings in French at night means 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:55.159
 black where darkness 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.780
 historically this word is a very term 

00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:59.540
 ancient applied to the executioners of the 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.879
 night since the average night age is the 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.739
 first champion to be previewed 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:07.400
 during a popular event 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:09.290
 the pax east 2011 the ultimate two nocturnal 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.659
 whose name is paranoia was in 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.850
 celebrates the file liabilities sticks so 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:15.590
 which was simply called paranoia and the 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.750
 the former past final stick actually 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.159
 allow enemies to miss their 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.880
 attacks against him there is tremendously 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:24.979
 hypotheses between z and between nocturnal 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.930
 are a lot of people who confuse 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:29.229
 and precisely we do not really know 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.979
 if there is a connection between the two 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:33.110
 now compared to these quotes 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:34.610
 so at night with a quote that 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.920
 looks like that of cho'gath afraid of 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.049
 darkness after embrace darkness 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.600
 to be a reference to the darkness 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:43.159
 which is a game we have another 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.930
 reference to their weather forecast for 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:46.850
 dark tonight with a chance of pain 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.200
 or pain I do not know I have not 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.759
 very well translated could be a 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.250
 reference to a routine 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:55.359
 george map aisne the movie that 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.359
 is called like this 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.450
 about these skins so nocturnal 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.850
 frosty terror then the only thing to 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.880
 tell the sequence them which allows us 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:09.280
 to change his so has his kind of 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.790
 black marks on the floor and his terror 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:16.840
 going back to then this skin is 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:19.030
 appeared in 2011 during the Halloween of 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.650
 the league of legends there is nothing 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.350
 else to say apart from that are aaa 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.700
 allows to launch small ghosts in 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.489
 same time as its black mark on the ground 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.770
 aeternum nocturnal so his skin 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:31.390
 legendary we already know they 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.640
 so modify that every night are 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.680
 modified in relation to his skin his voice 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:39.100
 and his attitude are very similar to 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.170
 herbinger of the mass effect series no he 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.209
 there are also several quotes that he 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.190
 looks like for example their existence 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:47.580
 it's an error we transcend the 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.920
 time fate can only be avoided 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.510
 the end of the day is near and we PERSONS 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.250

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.510
 10 we fight like one and the other 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.610
 end of the day is close the moment of 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.320
 our turn finally comes short there are full 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:06.160
 little references like that that we 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:07.299
 makes you think a lot about this game 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.440
 for this champion my friends do not hesitate 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:09.070
