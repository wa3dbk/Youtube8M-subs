00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:07.490
 I would like to lecture how to fold a dove in Yes 

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:11.820
 It is a small pigeon pigeon that symbolizes happiness 

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:14.910
 Yes 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:18.900
 It looks like a little bird, but with a pigeon 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.810
 Yes I would like to give a lecture on how to fold 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.670
 Well first 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.670
 Please fold it into a triangle 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:43.250
 It is in 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:43.250
 It is about one third from the bottom I understand one third of the width of this triangle from the bottom to the top 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.900
 The width of the width is yeah yeah 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.210
 Heart of wings 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:56.070
 Will be the width 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:01:00.030
 Yes Dee Turn It is this 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:05.830
 I turned it over and only one of these triangles 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:08.820
 Top about half of it is about half of the width as a guide 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.820
 Wrap 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.140
 Something like this 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:26.220
 Yes two have in the vertical it is Should this form 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.220
 And then to two fold 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:46.420
 This cutting edge is slightly 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:51.000
 The position may not match 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.000
 I 'm giving up as much as possible 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:01.010
 It feels like 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:03.100
 At this point, the smaller this triangle is the face. 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.100
 The 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:09.020
 Yes this is fine 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.470
 This time, although I am facing up wings 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.850
 Huh 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.840
 this 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:16.769
 It is part of the corner 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:20.110
 On the basis of the part with a little crossing 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:22.900
 And the wings lift up diagonally 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:27.239
 The angle is still painful 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.239
 The fact that their favorite Well 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:32.480
 Angle also is wearing somewhat obliquely 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.050
 If you 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.050
 Saying it 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:40.640
 Number was the one by also I think there try shifting slightly 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:52.670
 Well, this triangle small public is a face , so it's a bone crest so I'm getting down inside 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.670
 Face 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.900
 We wait for the length of our hot spring bill 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.709
 Let's judge 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.709
 Te jar or Nechi' 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.730
 Something like this 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:20.800
 Yes 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:22.200
 It looks a bit poor now, but for the time being the heart is completed 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:28.010
 That say 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:28.010
 Is yes So how folding of the heart is more than
