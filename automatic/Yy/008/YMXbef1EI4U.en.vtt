show you where that is you can see the

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:40.620 
show you where that is you can see the
Pelican<00:02:30.340> case<00:02:30.520> just<00:02:30.880> under<00:02:31.150> he'll<00:02:39.360> these<00:02:40.360> two

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
Pelican case just under he'll these two

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.140 
Pelican case just under he'll these two
bits<00:02:40.930> here<00:02:41.140> hook<00:02:41.680> one<00:02:41.860> to<00:02:42.040> the<00:02:42.220> back<00:02:42.820> and<00:02:43.090> that

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
bits here hook one to the back and that

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.430 
bits here hook one to the back and that
locks<00:02:43.720> into<00:02:43.959> the<00:02:44.520> back<00:02:45.520> that<00:02:46.480> basically<00:02:47.170> the

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
locks into the back that basically the

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.530 
locks into the back that basically the
locking<00:02:48.190> mount<00:02:48.400> and<00:02:49.000> it's<00:02:49.150> reasonably

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
locking mount and it's reasonably

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.420 
locking mount and it's reasonably
spacious<00:02:50.080> that's<00:02:50.410> a<00:02:50.470> knock<00:02:50.680> off<00:02:50.830> Pelican<00:02:51.280> to

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
spacious that's a knock off Pelican to

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.990 
spacious that's a knock off Pelican to
Holloway<00:02:52.739> so<00:02:53.739> that's<00:02:53.890> pretty<00:02:54.070> good<00:02:54.280> and<00:02:54.550> for

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
Holloway so that's pretty good and for

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.600 
Holloway so that's pretty good and for
this<00:02:55.600> I've<00:02:56.260> also<00:02:56.530> got<00:02:57.720> one<00:02:58.720> to<00:02:59.050> support<00:02:59.470> a<00:02:59.680> Givi

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
this I've also got one to support a Givi

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.540 
this I've also got one to support a Givi
case<00:03:00.910> as<00:03:01.209> well<00:03:01.950> let<00:03:02.950> me<00:03:03.040> just<00:03:03.220> see<00:03:03.340> if<00:03:03.400> I've<00:03:03.519> got

worlds<00:03:15.700> there<00:03:15.880> in<00:03:16.269> some<00:03:16.570> respects<00:03:17.250> let's<00:03:18.250> take

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
worlds there in some respects let's take

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:19.800 
worlds there in some respects let's take
this<00:03:18.579> off<00:03:18.790> it's<00:03:19.000> pretty<00:03:19.060> straightforward<00:03:19.780> you

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
this off it's pretty straightforward you

just basically unscrew those three and
through<00:03:23.290> lift<00:03:24.100> it<00:03:24.220> off<00:03:24.340> good<00:03:24.820> to<00:03:24.970> go<00:03:25.120> you<00:03:25.720> can

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
through lift it off good to go you can

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.680 
through lift it off good to go you can
get<00:03:25.989> other<00:03:26.110> adapters<00:03:26.709> as<00:03:26.890> well<00:03:27.100> on<00:03:28.090> this<00:03:28.450> Tiger

here<00:04:49.540> if<00:04:50.440> you<00:04:50.590> have<00:04:50.740> it<00:04:50.860> off<00:04:51.010> obviously<00:04:51.610> that's

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
here if you have it off obviously that's

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.240 
here if you have it off obviously that's
