started on a weight-loss journey and one

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.019 
started on a weight-loss journey and one
of<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.750> things<00:00:25.019> that<00:00:25.289> I<00:00:25.529> worked<00:00:26.430> on<00:00:26.640> was

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
of the things that I worked on was

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.480 
of the things that I worked on was
cycling<00:00:27.810> I<00:00:27.990> really<00:00:28.380> enjoyed<00:00:28.680> riding<00:00:28.980> my<00:00:29.250> bike

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
cycling I really enjoyed riding my bike

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.310 
cycling I really enjoyed riding my bike
and<00:00:29.519> I<00:00:29.789> found<00:00:30.090> that<00:00:30.240> it<00:00:30.330> was<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.480> one<00:00:30.779> activity

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
and I found that it was the one activity

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.080 
and I found that it was the one activity
that<00:00:31.500> I<00:00:31.529> could<00:00:31.800> do<00:00:31.920> for<00:00:32.189> extended<00:00:32.640> periods<00:00:33.030> of

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
that I could do for extended periods of

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.060 
that I could do for extended periods of
time<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:33.630> not<00:00:33.780> become<00:00:34.170> horribly<00:00:34.590> fatigued

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
time and not become horribly fatigued

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.729 
time and not become horribly fatigued
and<00:00:35.399> one<00:00:36.149> day<00:00:36.329> I've<00:00:36.510> gone<00:00:36.780> out<00:00:36.989> for<00:00:37.170> a<00:00:37.230> ride<00:00:37.440> and

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
and one day I've gone out for a ride and

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.970 
and one day I've gone out for a ride and
realized<00:00:38.190> that<00:00:38.309> I<00:00:38.489> had<00:00:38.520> rode<00:00:39.290> ten<00:00:40.290> miles<00:00:40.559> in

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
realized that I had rode ten miles in

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.580 
realized that I had rode ten miles in
one<00:00:41.760> hour<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.480> I<00:00:42.570> was<00:00:42.750> really<00:00:42.960> impressed<00:00:43.440> with

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
one hour and I was really impressed with

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.650 
one hour and I was really impressed with
that<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:44.100> so<00:00:44.579> I<00:00:44.610> thought<00:00:44.850> maybe<00:00:45.120> I'm<00:00:45.360> strong

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
that and so I thought maybe I'm strong

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.900 
that and so I thought maybe I'm strong
enough<00:00:45.690> to<00:00:46.200> actually<00:00:46.739> ride<00:00:46.950> it<00:00:47.190> in<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.340> race<00:00:47.489> and

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
enough to actually ride it in a race and

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.660 
enough to actually ride it in a race and
so<00:00:48.420> last<00:00:48.780> year<00:00:48.989> I<00:00:49.140> signed<00:00:49.530> up<00:00:49.739> for<00:00:49.770> my<00:00:50.280> first

so last year I signed up for my first

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.360 
so last year I signed up for my first
organized<00:00:51.449> ride<00:00:51.899> and<00:00:52.289> that<00:00:52.710> was<00:00:52.829> for<00:00:53.010> diabetes

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
oil smoothing that on I just got out of

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.199 
oil smoothing that on I just got out of
the<00:03:53.239> pool<00:03:53.450> maybe<00:03:54.370> thirty<00:03:55.370> five<00:03:55.640> minutes<00:03:55.880> ago

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
the pool maybe thirty five minutes ago

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:00.039 
the pool maybe thirty five minutes ago

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:00.049 
so my hair is still somewhat damp and I

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:02.410 
so my hair is still somewhat damp and I
need<00:04:00.680> to<00:04:00.769> go<00:04:00.920> through<00:04:01.100> that<00:04:01.130> whole<00:04:01.700> routine<00:04:01.940> of
