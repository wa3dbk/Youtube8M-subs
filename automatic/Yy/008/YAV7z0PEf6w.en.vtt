important to be able to stop a bike once
you're<00:02:31.830> once<00:02:32.430> you're<00:02:32.610> going<00:02:32.940> on<00:02:33.090> it<00:02:33.239> most

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
you're once you're going on it most

bikes have a front brake and a rear

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.559 
bikes have a front brake and a rear
brake<00:02:37.470> the<00:02:37.980> front<00:02:38.010> brake<00:02:38.610> when<00:02:39.090> you<00:02:39.180> squeeze

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
brake the front brake when you squeeze

brake the front brake when you squeeze
the<00:02:39.750> lever<00:02:39.960> here

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
the lever here

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.770 
the lever here
they're<00:02:40.920> little<00:02:41.100> brake<00:02:41.400> pads<00:02:41.760> that<00:02:42.120> close

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
they're little brake pads that close

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.190 
they're little brake pads that close
together<00:02:43.110> and<00:02:43.880> contact<00:02:44.880> the<00:02:45.090> rim<00:02:45.300> what<00:02:46.110> we

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
together and contact the rim what we

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.770 
together and contact the rim what we
want<00:02:46.470> is<00:02:46.770> for<00:02:47.310> these<00:02:47.610> brake<00:02:48.090> pads<00:02:48.420> when<00:02:48.720> I

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
want is for these brake pads when I

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.050 
want is for these brake pads when I
squeeze<00:02:49.110> the<00:02:49.290> lever<00:02:49.500> to<00:02:49.770> close<00:02:50.100> in<00:02:50.400> from<00:02:50.970> the

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
squeeze the lever to close in from the

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.100 
squeeze the lever to close in from the
sides<00:02:51.300> as<00:02:51.600> you<00:02:52.110> see<00:02:52.320> them<00:02:52.470> doing<00:02:52.850> see<00:02:53.850> in<00:02:54.690> and

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
sides as you see them doing see in and

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.620 
sides as you see them doing see in and
out<00:02:55.350> so<00:02:55.740> as<00:02:55.920> I<00:02:55.950> release<00:02:56.280> the<00:02:56.700> brake<00:02:56.910> lever<00:02:57.210> the

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
out so as I release the brake lever the

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.720 
out so as I release the brake lever the
pads<00:02:57.900> move<00:02:58.170> out<00:02:58.410> allowing<00:02:58.860> the<00:02:59.130> wheel<00:02:59.280> to<00:02:59.490> spin

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
pads move out allowing the wheel to spin

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.160 
pads move out allowing the wheel to spin
one<00:03:00.000> more<00:03:00.210> time<00:03:00.450> and<00:03:00.860> now<00:03:01.860> it's<00:03:02.100> closed<00:03:03.170> what's

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
one more time and now it's closed what's

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.990 
one more time and now it's closed what's
good<00:03:04.350> about<00:03:04.530> this<00:03:04.680> is<00:03:04.920> that<00:03:05.160> the<00:03:05.460> brake<00:03:05.670> pads

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
good about this is that the brake pads

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.570 
good about this is that the brake pads
are<00:03:06.240> moving<00:03:06.690> from<00:03:07.320> the<00:03:07.590> different<00:03:07.950> sides<00:03:08.130> and

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
are moving from the different sides and

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.700 
are moving from the different sides and
coming<00:03:09.210> in<00:03:09.330> at<00:03:09.510> the<00:03:09.600> same<00:03:09.630> time<00:03:10.080> sometimes

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:10.710 
coming in at the same time sometimes

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:13.730 
coming in at the same time sometimes
break<00:03:11.340> will<00:03:11.610> be<00:03:11.760> will<00:03:12.390> be<00:03:12.420> poorly<00:03:13.140> centered

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:13.740 
break will be will be poorly centered

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.070 
break will be will be poorly centered
and<00:03:13.920> one<00:03:14.490> of<00:03:14.760> the<00:03:15.240> pads<00:03:15.540> will<00:03:15.810> rub

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
and one of the pads will rub

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.190 
and one of the pads will rub
continuously<00:03:16.860> on<00:03:17.130> the<00:03:17.400> wheel<00:03:17.760> which<00:03:18.570> is<00:03:18.780> not<00:03:18.960> a

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
continuously on the wheel which is not a

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.350 
continuously on the wheel which is not a
safety<00:03:19.680> problem<00:03:19.890> but<00:03:20.250> it<00:03:20.370> certainly<00:03:20.790> makes

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
safety problem but it certainly makes

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.570 
safety problem but it certainly makes
the<00:03:21.570> bike<00:03:21.750> go<00:03:22.290> more<00:03:22.530> slowly<00:03:22.680> if<00:03:23.100> you<00:03:23.220> have<00:03:23.370> one

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
the bike go more slowly if you have one

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.490 
the bike go more slowly if you have one
of<00:03:23.700> the<00:03:23.760> brakes<00:03:24.030> that's<00:03:24.300> always<00:03:24.600> contacting

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
of the brakes that's always contacting

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.340 
of the brakes that's always contacting
the<00:03:25.590> rim<00:03:25.800> I<00:03:26.100> do<00:03:27.000> notice<00:03:27.360> one<00:03:27.720> problem<00:03:28.020> with

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
the rim I do notice one problem with

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.020 
the rim I do notice one problem with
this<00:03:28.410> bicycle<00:03:29.010> that<00:03:29.340> actually<00:03:29.790> is<00:03:29.880> a<00:03:29.910> pretty

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
this bicycle that actually is a pretty

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.840 
this bicycle that actually is a pretty
serious<00:03:30.510> one<00:03:31.070> there<00:03:32.070> are<00:03:32.130> a<00:03:32.190> lot<00:03:32.280> of<00:03:32.310> parts<00:03:32.700> of

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
serious one there are a lot of parts of

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.100 
serious one there are a lot of parts of
the<00:03:32.940> bike<00:03:33.120> that<00:03:33.330> it's<00:03:33.450> really<00:03:33.690> important<00:03:34.080> to

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
the bike that it's really important to

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:35.630 
the bike that it's really important to
have<00:03:34.290> have<00:03:34.620> them<00:03:34.770> tight<00:03:35.010> have<00:03:35.250> bolts

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
have have them tight have bolts

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.300 
have have them tight have bolts
tightened<00:03:36.030> things<00:03:36.180> like<00:03:36.450> that<00:03:36.660> and<00:03:37.310> here's

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
tightened things like that and here's

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.420 
tightened things like that and here's
one<00:03:38.610> where<00:03:39.600> it's<00:03:39.870> not<00:03:40.050> tight<00:03:40.380> and<00:03:40.680> it<00:03:41.100> could<00:03:41.310> be

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
one where it's not tight and it could be

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.250 
one where it's not tight and it could be
a<00:03:41.460> disastrous<00:03:42.180> when<00:03:42.840> you<00:03:42.960> turn<00:03:43.230> the

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
a disastrous when you turn the

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.229 
a disastrous when you turn the
handlebars<00:03:43.920> you<00:03:44.430> want<00:03:44.640> the<00:03:44.760> wheel<00:03:44.940> to<00:03:45.209> turn

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
handlebars you want the wheel to turn

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:48.260 
handlebars you want the wheel to turn
with<00:03:46.200> with<00:03:46.830> the<00:03:46.950> handlebars<00:03:47.400> but<00:03:47.700> if<00:03:47.850> you<00:03:47.940> look

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:48.270 
with with the handlebars but if you look

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:51.890 
with with the handlebars but if you look
at<00:03:48.420> this<00:03:48.510> see<00:03:48.750> how<00:03:48.930> it's<00:03:49.170> loose<00:03:49.470> so<00:03:50.480> you<00:03:51.480> could

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
at this see how it's loose so you could

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.320 
at this see how it's loose so you could
be<00:03:51.989> riding<00:03:52.380> along<00:03:52.470> and<00:03:53.070> turn<00:03:53.700> the<00:03:53.850> handle<00:03:54.150> bars

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
be riding along and turn the handle bars

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:55.940 
be riding along and turn the handle bars
to<00:03:54.600> the<00:03:54.630> left<00:03:54.720> and<00:03:55.110> the<00:03:55.170> wheel<00:03:55.410> doesn't<00:03:55.709> move

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
to the left and the wheel doesn't move

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.090 
to the left and the wheel doesn't move
with<00:03:56.190> it<00:03:56.220> and<00:03:56.750> you<00:03:57.750> have<00:03:57.900> a<00:03:57.930> real<00:03:58.170> problem<00:03:58.350> so

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
with it and you have a real problem so

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.340 
with it and you have a real problem so
what<00:03:59.250> I'm<00:03:59.370> going<00:03:59.459> to<00:03:59.520> do<00:03:59.730> is<00:04:00.110> align<00:04:01.110> the

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
what I'm going to do is align the

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.560 
what I'm going to do is align the
handlebars<00:04:01.860> with<00:04:01.950> the<00:04:02.220> wheel<00:04:02.430> and<00:04:02.790> this<00:04:03.390> is

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
handlebars with the wheel and this is

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.690 
handlebars with the wheel and this is
the<00:04:03.720> bolt<00:04:03.930> right<00:04:04.200> here<00:04:04.230> that<00:04:04.830> is<00:04:04.980> responsible

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
the bolt right here that is responsible

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.420 
the bolt right here that is responsible
for<00:04:05.940> keeping<00:04:06.510> the<00:04:06.780> handlebars<00:04:07.350> attached<00:04:08.100> to

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
for keeping the handlebars attached to

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.580 
for keeping the handlebars attached to
the<00:04:08.610> wheel<00:04:09.030> so<00:04:09.660> I'm<00:04:09.810> going<00:04:09.959> to<00:04:09.989> tighten<00:04:10.410> this

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
the wheel so I'm going to tighten this

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.550 
the wheel so I'm going to tighten this
with<00:04:11.400> a<00:04:11.430> with<00:04:12.150> a<00:04:12.180> wrench<00:04:12.480> six<00:04:13.080> millimeter

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
with a with a wrench six millimeter

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.159 
with a with a wrench six millimeter
wrench<00:04:13.800> as<00:04:14.040> it<00:04:14.190> turns<00:04:14.370> out<00:04:14.520> to<00:04:14.700> be<00:04:14.730> and<00:04:15.140> after<00:04:16.140> I

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
wrench as it turns out to be and after I

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:19.250 
wrench as it turns out to be and after I
tighten<00:04:16.620> that<00:04:16.739> now<00:04:17.400> you<00:04:18.239> see<00:04:18.450> that<00:04:18.480> problem<00:04:19.109> is

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
tighten that now you see that problem is

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.890 
tighten that now you see that problem is
bent<00:04:19.650> has<00:04:19.830> been<00:04:19.859> solved<00:04:20.459> because<00:04:20.700> now<00:04:21.180> when<00:04:21.870> I

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
bent has been solved because now when I

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.370 
bent has been solved because now when I
turn<00:04:22.020> the<00:04:22.320> handlebars<00:04:22.680> the<00:04:23.490> wheel<00:04:23.700> turns<00:04:24.000> also

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
turn the handlebars the wheel turns also

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.590 
turn the handlebars the wheel turns also
so<00:04:25.380> that's<00:04:25.590> one<00:04:25.800> example<00:04:25.830> of<00:04:26.520> a<00:04:26.700> bolt<00:04:27.210> that<00:04:27.419> has

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
so that's one example of a bolt that has

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.900 
so that's one example of a bolt that has
to<00:04:27.750> be<00:04:27.870> tight<00:04:28.160> there<00:04:29.160> are<00:04:29.310> other<00:04:29.460> ones<00:04:29.700> to

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:29.910 
to be tight there are other ones to

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:32.510 
to be tight there are other ones to
places<00:04:30.450> that<00:04:30.480> you<00:04:31.080> want<00:04:31.350> the<00:04:31.530> bicycle<00:04:31.919> to<00:04:32.400> be

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
places that you want the bicycle to be

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.020 
places that you want the bicycle to be
tight<00:04:32.820> at<00:04:33.750> the<00:04:33.780> center<00:04:34.260> of<00:04:34.290> a<00:04:34.680> wheel<00:04:34.919> is<00:04:35.280> what's

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
tight at the center of a wheel is what's

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.780 
tight at the center of a wheel is what's
called<00:04:36.270> the<00:04:36.419> the<00:04:36.780> hub<00:04:36.990> and<00:04:37.610> there<00:04:38.610> are

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790 
called the the hub and there are

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:40.700 
called the the hub and there are
bearings<00:04:39.240> in<00:04:39.450> the<00:04:39.540> hub<00:04:39.720> and<00:04:40.020> sometimes<00:04:40.500> those

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
bearings in the hub and sometimes those

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.560 
bearings in the hub and sometimes those
bearings<00:04:41.160> get<00:04:41.340> loose<00:04:41.580> and<00:04:41.880> when<00:04:42.390> that<00:04:42.540> happens

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
bearings get loose and when that happens

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.070 
bearings get loose and when that happens
then<00:04:43.470> I<00:04:44.070> can<00:04:44.640> feel<00:04:44.880> actually<00:04:45.120> as<00:04:45.480> I<00:04:45.630> move<00:04:45.900> this

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
then I can feel actually as I move this

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.560 
then I can feel actually as I move this
rim<00:04:46.380> back<00:04:46.590> and<00:04:46.830> forth<00:04:47.130> I<00:04:47.430> can<00:04:47.940> feel<00:04:48.180> that<00:04:48.419> the

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 
rim back and forth I can feel that the

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:52.790 
rim back and forth I can feel that the
bearing<00:04:48.990> at<00:04:49.260> the<00:04:49.380> hub<00:04:49.590> is<00:04:49.919> loose<00:04:50.220> and<00:04:51.650> so<00:04:52.650> what

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
bearing at the hub is loose and so what

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.150 
bearing at the hub is loose and so what
i<00:04:52.830> would<00:04:52.950> do<00:04:53.220> is

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 
i would do is

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.420 
i would do is
make<00:04:54.880> a<00:04:54.910> note<00:04:55.180> of<00:04:55.240> that<00:04:55.390> and<00:04:55.950> when<00:04:56.950> I'm<00:04:57.040> fixing

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
make a note of that and when I'm fixing

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.250 
make a note of that and when I'm fixing
the<00:04:57.550> bike<00:04:57.730> I<00:04:57.910> would<00:04:58.060> take<00:04:58.270> the<00:04:58.390> wheel<00:04:58.600> out<00:04:58.810> and

00:04:59.250 --> 00:04:59.260 
the bike I would take the wheel out and

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.500 
the bike I would take the wheel out and
use<00:04:59.950> some<00:05:00.280> special<00:05:00.820> wrenches<00:05:01.240> to<00:05:01.480> tighten

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:01.510 
use some special wrenches to tighten

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.660 
use some special wrenches to tighten
that<00:05:02.110> bearing<00:05:02.620> in<00:05:02.800> the<00:05:02.830> hub<00:05:03.130> to<00:05:03.340> make<00:05:03.490> sure

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:03.670 
that bearing in the hub to make sure

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:05.880 
that bearing in the hub to make sure
that<00:05:03.970> that<00:05:04.510> a<00:05:04.570> little<00:05:04.780> bit<00:05:04.870> of<00:05:04.990> looseness<00:05:05.230> goes

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:05.890 
that that a little bit of looseness goes

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:12.330 
that that a little bit of looseness goes
away<00:05:06.150> now<00:05:07.150> similarly<00:05:08.550> back<00:05:09.550> here<00:05:10.950> you<00:05:11.950> notice

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.340 
away now similarly back here you notice

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.600 
away now similarly back here you notice
that<00:05:12.370> there<00:05:12.730> is<00:05:12.760> a<00:05:12.880> left<00:05:13.780> left<00:05:14.560> hand<00:05:14.710> crank<00:05:15.370> and

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:15.610 
that there is a left left hand crank and

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.890 
that there is a left left hand crank and
a<00:05:15.700> right<00:05:15.910> hand<00:05:15.940> crank<00:05:16.600> and<00:05:17.190> there<00:05:18.190> is<00:05:18.310> a<00:05:18.340> part

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 
a right hand crank and there is a part

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.000 
a right hand crank and there is a part
called<00:05:19.900> a<00:05:20.050> bottom<00:05:20.380> bracket<00:05:20.860> that<00:05:20.950> goes

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:21.010 
called a bottom bracket that goes

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:24.750 
called a bottom bracket that goes
through<00:05:21.610> the<00:05:22.300> middle<00:05:23.020> of<00:05:23.110> the<00:05:23.170> bike<00:05:23.440> and<00:05:24.340> that

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:24.760 
through the middle of the bike and that

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.480 
through the middle of the bike and that
connects<00:05:25.690> these<00:05:25.840> cranks<00:05:26.170> together<00:05:26.590> as<00:05:26.860> I<00:05:27.280> move

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490 
connects these cranks together as I move

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.400 
connects these cranks together as I move
this<00:05:27.670> back<00:05:27.880> and<00:05:28.120> forth<00:05:28.210> just<00:05:28.570> pushing<00:05:29.200> it<00:05:29.290> in

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:29.410 
this back and forth just pushing it in

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:32.190 
this back and forth just pushing it in
and<00:05:29.590> out<00:05:29.650> I<00:05:29.710> can<00:05:30.070> feel<00:05:30.310> a<00:05:30.600> keen<00:05:31.600> feeling<00:05:31.870> which

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:32.200 
and out I can feel a keen feeling which

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.350 
and out I can feel a keen feeling which
means<00:05:32.500> that<00:05:32.770> that<00:05:32.950> the<00:05:33.610> bearing<00:05:34.060> in<00:05:34.210> that

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360 
means that that the bearing in that

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.040 
means that that the bearing in that
bottom<00:05:34.750> bracket<00:05:35.170> is<00:05:35.290> loose<00:05:35.560> so<00:05:36.900> when<00:05:37.900> you're

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:38.050 
bottom bracket is loose so when you're

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:39.630 
bottom bracket is loose so when you're
riding<00:05:38.260> long<00:05:38.680> you<00:05:38.980> would<00:05:39.130> you<00:05:39.250> would<00:05:39.340> feel

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:39.640 
riding long you would you would feel

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.880 
riding long you would you would feel
that<00:05:39.910> and<00:05:40.300> the<00:05:40.780> bike<00:05:40.960> would<00:05:41.140> not<00:05:41.350> shift<00:05:41.710> as

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:41.890 
that and the bike would not shift as

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:43.710 
that and the bike would not shift as
well<00:05:42.130> and<00:05:42.550> it<00:05:42.700> would<00:05:42.880> probably<00:05:43.090> make<00:05:43.390> noises

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:43.720 
well and it would probably make noises

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.080 
well and it would probably make noises
also<00:05:44.350> so<00:05:44.590> what<00:05:45.220> I<00:05:45.250> would<00:05:45.460> do<00:05:45.610> would<00:05:45.790> i<00:05:45.820> be<00:05:46.060> i

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.090 
also so what I would do would i be i

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:48.660 
also so what I would do would i be i
would<00:05:46.390> take<00:05:46.570> this<00:05:46.810> apart<00:05:47.530> and<00:05:47.920> make<00:05:48.310> sure<00:05:48.340> it's

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:48.670 
would take this apart and make sure it's

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:50.370 
would take this apart and make sure it's
nice<00:05:48.790> and<00:05:48.850> tight<00:05:49.210> so<00:05:49.240> that<00:05:49.480> the<00:05:50.050> bike<00:05:50.230> would

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:50.380 
nice and tight so that the bike would

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:52.830 
nice and tight so that the bike would
work<00:05:50.590> correctly<00:05:51.040> so<00:05:51.580> the<00:05:51.940> the<00:05:52.330> headset<00:05:52.810> is

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:52.840 
work correctly so the the headset is

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.440 
work correctly so the the headset is
another<00:05:53.320> place<00:05:53.620> there<00:05:53.950> our<00:05:54.190> bearings<00:05:55.030> there

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:55.450 
another place there our bearings there

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:58.200 
another place there our bearings there
are<00:05:55.630> bearings<00:05:56.020> here<00:05:56.440> and<00:05:56.620> here<00:05:57.400> at<00:05:57.610> the<00:05:57.790> bottom

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:58.210 
are bearings here and here at the bottom

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:01.020 
are bearings here and here at the bottom
and<00:05:58.360> the<00:05:58.690> top<00:05:58.720> of<00:05:58.930> the<00:05:59.230> headset<00:05:59.710> and<00:06:00.030> the

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:01.030 
and the top of the headset and the

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:03.030 
and the top of the headset and the
bearings<00:06:01.510> are<00:06:01.780> what<00:06:02.020> are<00:06:02.140> responsible<00:06:02.830> for

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:03.040 
bearings are what are responsible for

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.640 
bearings are what are responsible for
making<00:06:03.250> this<00:06:03.820> whole<00:06:04.090> part<00:06:04.510> here<00:06:04.810> turn<00:06:05.170> nice

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:05.650 
making this whole part here turn nice

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:08.330 
making this whole part here turn nice
and<00:06:05.950> smoothly<00:06:06.220> so<00:06:06.970> if<00:06:07.240> this<00:06:07.360> becomes<00:06:07.720> loose

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:08.340 
and smoothly so if this becomes loose

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:10.620 
and smoothly so if this becomes loose
then<00:06:09.340> that<00:06:09.490> needs<00:06:09.730> to<00:06:09.820> be<00:06:09.940> tightened<00:06:10.210> up<00:06:10.450> as

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:10.630 
then that needs to be tightened up as

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:13.170 
then that needs to be tightened up as
well<00:06:10.810> or<00:06:11.080> sometimes<00:06:11.950> the<00:06:12.490> headset<00:06:12.880> needs<00:06:13.060> to

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:13.180 
well or sometimes the headset needs to

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:15.360 
well or sometimes the headset needs to
be<00:06:13.300> replaced<00:06:13.750> or<00:06:14.080> new<00:06:14.350> grease<00:06:14.620> put<00:06:14.919> in<00:06:15.070> it<00:06:15.220> or

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:15.370 
be replaced or new grease put in it or

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:17.130 
be replaced or new grease put in it or
things<00:06:15.760> like<00:06:15.850> that<00:06:15.970> that<00:06:16.390> a<00:06:16.450> mechanic<00:06:16.990> would

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:17.140 
things like that that a mechanic would

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:20.250 
things like that that a mechanic would
be<00:06:17.290> able<00:06:17.410> to<00:06:18.120> diagnose<00:06:19.120> and<00:06:19.540> figure<00:06:19.960> out<00:06:19.990> how

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:22.240 
to solve those are some of the things

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.120 
to solve those are some of the things
