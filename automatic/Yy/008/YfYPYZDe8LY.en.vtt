00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:07.120
 hello you dearly welcome in 

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:09.610
 my cakes and cakes because today 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:12.519
 come again a recipe from me what 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:14.910
 like to eat the solid that 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:18.699
 It looks like a grin with sugar syrup 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.890
 for that we need a glass jar it is 

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:25.900
 no matter which one you take then I have one 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:28.509
 glass of mail and a glass of ca you have her 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:31.300
 how much does one fit into a glass? 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:33.640
 wine it does not matter which glass you take 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.820
 always do the same with them 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:40.180
 Then I have five eggs for her 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:44.200
 package of vanilla sugar a package of baking powder 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:52.539
 then we need a glass of cold milk 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:58.000
 for later i miss the flour with the 

00:00:52.539 --> 00:01:02.460
 baking powder and the circle and give that 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.460
 you're still there with ten men 

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:18.280
 I have a round here now 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:24.100
 Just say the day I 've got it before 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:27.149
 used and then it will be at 200 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:30.219
 bake about 30 minutes 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:30.969
 so my semolina cake is out of the 

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:33.609
 oven 

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:37.719
 I'll be in the hot cake now 

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:39.520
 So give a glass of cold milk over it 

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:42.130
 very important is that the milk 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:45.039
 kite must be then comes naturally 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.619
 sugar syrup on it means sugar syrup is 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:50.770
 also hot I'll tell you here always if 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:53.469
 her sweets with sugar like that 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:56.770
 prepared then must either pastry 

00:01:53.469 --> 00:02:00.670
 be warm that cold or let on 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:02.979
 this is exactly the reverse here 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.140
 both were first I have cold first 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:09.009
 given milk on it and then give the 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:11.349
 warm sugar syrup still on it and 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.750
 then let it pass through 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:16.000
 and then if the sugar syrup right 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.959
 is pulled through you can then with 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.299
 decorate coconut shavings 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:24.639
 so after the sugar is very correct 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:27.849
 is pulled through you can then synonymous 

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:30.540
 Decorate with grated coconut and then 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:30.540
 to cut 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.650
 Of course I hope that 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.930
 platzeck also likes because that is 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.030
 really great super delicious I wish 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.650
 Have fun trying it out and 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.650
 say goodbye until the next video
