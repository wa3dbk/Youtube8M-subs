00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
one Court is going to go in the carboy

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.719 
one Court is going to go in the carboy
two<00:01:47.540> courts<00:01:47.960> is<00:01:48.200> going<00:01:48.650> to<00:01:49.040> be<00:01:49.159> used<00:01:49.400> for<00:01:49.520> our

two courts is going to be used for our

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:52.330 
two courts is going to be used for our
honey<00:01:49.940> mixture<00:01:50.360> and<00:01:50.659> the<00:01:51.470> leftovers<00:01:52.010> will<00:01:52.220> be

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
honey mixture and the leftovers will be

00:01:52.340 --> 00:02:03.470 
honey mixture and the leftovers will be
used<00:01:52.640> to<00:01:52.850> top<00:01:53.090> off<00:01:53.360> our<00:01:53.570> meat

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:03.480 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.270 

you<00:02:04.020> will<00:02:04.170> need<00:02:04.320> to<00:02:04.500> put<00:02:04.740> your<00:02:04.950> honey

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
you will need to put your honey

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.000 
you will need to put your honey
container<00:02:05.820> in<00:02:06.150> some<00:02:06.450> warm<00:02:06.810> water<00:02:07.080> it<00:02:07.440> will

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.010 
container in some warm water it will

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:10.040 
container in some warm water it will
help<00:02:08.070> make<00:02:08.520> it<00:02:08.700> less<00:02:08.910> viscous<00:02:09.270> so<00:02:09.810> it<00:02:09.930> is

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
help make it less viscous so it is

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.870 
help make it less viscous so it is
easier<00:02:10.470> to<00:02:10.560> pour<00:02:13.130> we<00:02:14.130> are<00:02:14.250> going<00:02:14.490> to<00:02:14.580> heat<00:02:14.850> up

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
easier to pour we are going to heat up

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.200 
easier to pour we are going to heat up
the<00:02:15.240> two<00:02:15.450> quarts<00:02:15.840> we<00:02:16.020> put<00:02:16.290> aside<00:02:16.590> to<00:02:17.210> 115

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
the two quarts we put aside to 115

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.600 
the two quarts we put aside to 115
degrees<00:02:18.660> then<00:02:19.470> we<00:02:19.620> are<00:02:19.740> going<00:02:19.950> to<00:02:20.070> take<00:02:20.310> it<00:02:20.490> off

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
degrees then we are going to take it off

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.120 
degrees then we are going to take it off
heat<00:02:20.940> so<00:02:21.660> we<00:02:21.810> do<00:02:21.930> not<00:02:22.080> scorch<00:02:22.560> our<00:02:22.680> honey<00:02:22.920> when

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
heat so we do not scorch our honey when

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.110 
heat so we do not scorch our honey when
we<00:02:23.250> pour<00:02:23.550> it<00:02:23.700> in<00:02:24.350> stir<00:02:25.350> and<00:02:25.710> dissolve<00:02:26.400> the

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
we pour it in stir and dissolve the

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:45.170 
we pour it in stir and dissolve the
honey

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.780
