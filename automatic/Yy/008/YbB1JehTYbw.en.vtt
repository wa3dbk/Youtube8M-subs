00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.799 
one is put on my favorite of all the
animated<00:00:11.130> figures<00:00:11.370> I<00:00:11.400> don't<00:00:11.580> know<00:00:11.639> why<00:00:11.809> it's

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
animated figures I don't know why it's

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:13.789 
animated figures I don't know why it's
probably<00:00:12.929> because<00:00:13.230> he<00:00:13.320> was<00:00:13.440> the<00:00:13.559> first

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
probably because he was the first

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.570 
probably because he was the first
animated<00:00:14.160> figure<00:00:14.490> I<00:00:14.519> ever<00:00:14.700> actually<00:00:15.059> got<00:00:16.580> so

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
animated figure I ever actually got so

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.939 
animated figure I ever actually got so
yeah<00:00:18.020> and<00:00:19.020> it<00:00:19.230> is<00:00:19.260> just<00:00:19.560> awesome

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
yeah and it is just awesome

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.640 
yeah and it is just awesome
I<00:00:20.300> mean<00:00:21.300> jet<00:00:21.570> mode<00:00:21.720> and<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.080> vehicle<00:00:22.410> and<00:00:22.560> the

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
I mean jet mode and the vehicle and the

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.590 
I mean jet mode and the vehicle and the
vehicle<00:00:22.859> modes<00:00:23.279> might<00:00:23.400> not<00:00:23.519> be<00:00:23.580> that<00:00:23.670> good<00:00:23.850> but

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
vehicle modes might not be that good but

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.509 
vehicle modes might not be that good but
you<00:00:24.720> know<00:00:24.840> I<00:00:25.050> still<00:00:25.470> think<00:00:25.800> that<00:00:25.859> this<00:00:26.039> toy<00:00:26.279> is

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
you know I still think that this toy is

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.700 
you know I still think that this toy is
just<00:00:26.789> badass<00:00:27.769> so<00:00:28.769> yeah<00:00:30.349> as<00:00:31.349> you<00:00:31.439> can<00:00:31.500> probably

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
just badass so yeah as you can probably

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.400 
just badass so yeah as you can probably

notice he is missing what I have one
little<00:00:34.559> he<00:00:34.950> comes<00:00:35.219> with<00:00:35.370> em<00:00:35.610> too<00:00:36.000> you<00:00:36.329> know

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
obviously but I like this figure quite a

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.310 
obviously but I like this figure quite a
while<00:00:39.680> since<00:00:40.680> 2008<00:00:41.489> so<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.390> missile<00:00:42.719> has<00:00:43.020> just

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
while since 2008 so the missile has just

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.470 
while since 2008 so the missile has just
walked<00:00:43.559> away<00:00:44.000> he<00:00:45.000> quit

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
walked away he quit

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.350 
walked away he quit
yeah<00:00:45.989> I<00:00:46.200> don't<00:00:46.410> know<00:00:46.700> but<00:00:47.700> yeah<00:00:47.820> I<00:00:47.850> really<00:00:47.940> like

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.380 
yeah I don't know but yeah I really like
this<00:00:48.450> jet<00:00:48.690> mode<00:00:49.070> it's<00:00:50.070> panacea<00:00:50.969> accurate

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
this jet mode it's panacea accurate

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.639 
this jet mode it's panacea accurate
because<00:00:51.449> it<00:00:51.600> was<00:00:51.780> of<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.020> tank<00:00:52.230> treads<00:00:52.469> on<00:00:52.559> the

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
because it was of the tank treads on the

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.750 
because it was of the tank treads on the
bottom<00:00:52.829> of<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:52.949> jet<00:00:53.070> mode<00:00:54.260> so<00:00:55.260> yeah<00:00:55.410> I<00:00:55.760> love

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
bottom of the jet mode so yeah I love

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.740 
bottom of the jet mode so yeah I love
the<00:00:56.879> gold<00:00:56.969> Decepticon<00:00:57.480> symbol<00:00:59.449> looks<00:01:00.449> pretty

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
the gold Decepticon symbol looks pretty

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.349

comparison here he is next to you know
it's<00:01:15.930> acid<00:01:16.259> storm

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
it's acid storm

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:20.570 
it's acid storm
yeah<00:01:19.259> blitz<00:01:19.530> fingers<00:01:19.830> kind<00:01:19.950> of<00:01:20.070> small<00:01:20.310> in

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
yeah blitz fingers kind of small in

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.230 
yeah blitz fingers kind of small in
vehicle<00:01:20.939> mode<00:01:20.970> for<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.240> Voyager<00:01:22.820> you<00:01:23.820> know<00:01:23.909> acid

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
vehicle mode for a Voyager you know acid

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.100 
vehicle mode for a Voyager you know acid
storm<00:01:24.420> is<00:01:24.890> almost<00:01:25.890> as<00:01:26.310> long<00:01:26.490> as<00:01:26.640> him<00:01:27.049> but<00:01:28.049> you

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
storm is almost as long as him but you

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.960 
storm is almost as long as him but you
know<00:01:28.200> this<00:01:28.979> thing's<00:01:29.189> got<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.400> lot<00:01:29.520> of<00:01:29.610> bulk<00:01:29.790> on

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
know this thing's got a lot of bulk on

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:36.080 
know this thing's got a lot of bulk on
him<00:01:30.090> so<00:01:31.049> yeah<00:01:34.189> but<00:01:35.189> yeah<00:01:35.310> that's<00:01:35.460> why<00:01:35.670> if<00:01:35.790> a<00:01:35.880> jet

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
him so yeah but yeah that's why if a jet

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.179 
him so yeah but yeah that's why if a jet
mode<00:01:36.270> it's<00:01:37.079> part<00:01:37.259> of<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.380> weakest<00:01:37.799> of<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:37.979> two

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
mode it's part of the weakest of the two

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.069 
mode it's part of the weakest of the two
but<00:01:39.090> it<00:01:39.180> is<00:01:39.210> still<00:01:39.479> lost<00:01:39.659> I<00:01:39.840> mean<00:01:39.960> it's

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
but it is still lost I mean it's

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.560 
but it is still lost I mean it's
probably<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.680> most<00:01:40.799> frequently<00:01:41.369> used<00:01:41.570> mode

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
probably the most frequently used mode

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.350 
probably the most frequently used mode
in<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.869> show<00:01:43.110> for<00:01:43.619> Blitzwing<00:01:44.100> anyway<00:01:44.310> so<00:01:45.240> yeah

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
in the show for Blitzwing anyway so yeah

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.480 
in the show for Blitzwing anyway so yeah
the<00:01:45.960> transformation<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.740> tank<00:01:47.009> mode<00:01:47.159> you<00:01:47.310> want

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
the transformation to tank mode you want

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.289 
the transformation to tank mode you want
to<00:01:47.670> flip<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.420> nose<00:01:48.570> cone<00:01:48.750> in<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.500> then<00:01:50.009> flip

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299 
to flip the nose cone in and then flip

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:56.149 
to flip the nose cone in and then flip
the<00:01:51.299> fuselage<00:01:51.810> in<00:01:52.049> I<00:01:52.140> think<00:01:52.729> then<00:01:54.979> bolt<00:01:55.979> them

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
the fuselage in I think then bolt them

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.760 
the fuselage in I think then bolt them
down<00:01:56.340> and<00:01:56.930> just<00:01:57.930> close<00:01:58.110> them<00:01:58.320> together<00:01:58.439> just

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
down and just close them together just

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.810 
down and just close them together just
like<00:01:58.829> that<00:01:59.119> then<00:02:00.119> lift<00:02:00.990> this<00:02:01.110> up<00:02:01.610> tap<00:02:02.610> it<00:02:02.729> on

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
like that then lift this up tap it on

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.100 
like that then lift this up tap it on
there<00:02:02.969> you<00:02:03.119> want<00:02:03.240> to<00:02:03.299> rotate<00:02:03.479> these<00:02:03.780> tank

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
there you want to rotate these tank

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.540 
there you want to rotate these tank
turrets<00:02:04.469> around<00:02:05.479> like<00:02:06.479> that<00:02:07.399> then<00:02:08.399> you<00:02:08.520> can

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
turrets around like that then you can

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.490 
turrets around like that then you can
cavity<00:02:09.060> in<00:02:09.149> there<00:02:09.360> a<00:02:09.750> lot<00:02:10.170> of<00:02:10.229> people<00:02:10.440> who

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
cavity in there a lot of people who

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.750 
cavity in there a lot of people who
actually<00:02:10.619> pointed<00:02:11.009> this<00:02:11.069> out<00:02:11.220> is<00:02:11.430> grabbing

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
actually pointed this out is grabbing

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.430 
actually pointed this out is grabbing
his<00:02:11.879> ass

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
his ass

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.090 
his ass
I<00:02:13.470> just<00:02:13.980> so<00:02:14.160> unmistakably<00:02:14.400> blitz<00:02:15.150> wing<00:02:15.860> yeah<00:02:16.860> I

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
I just so unmistakably blitz wing yeah I

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.630 
I just so unmistakably blitz wing yeah I
know<00:02:17.550> I<00:02:17.580> open<00:02:18.570> up<00:02:18.630> the<00:02:18.810> panel<00:02:19.140> I'm<00:02:19.500> just<00:02:19.740> full

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
know I open up the panel I'm just full

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:27.320 
know I open up the panel I'm just full
I'd<00:02:23.630> fall<00:02:24.630> by<00:02:24.810> it<00:02:24.890> like<00:02:25.890> that<00:02:26.150> and<00:02:27.150> we're<00:02:27.240> gonna

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
I'd fall by it like that and we're gonna

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.020 
I'd fall by it like that and we're gonna
just<00:02:27.540> take<00:02:27.690> these<00:02:28.490> close<00:02:29.490> them<00:02:29.610> together<00:02:29.730> and

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
just take these close them together and

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.100 
just take these close them together and
then<00:02:30.230> fold<00:02:31.230> that<00:02:31.260> down<00:02:31.380> just<00:02:32.570> like<00:02:33.570> that<00:02:33.630> and

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
then fold that down just like that and

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.220 
then fold that down just like that and
there<00:02:34.500> is<00:02:34.610> Blitzwing<00:02:35.610> in<00:02:36.120> here's<00:02:36.540> a<00:02:36.720> tank<00:02:37.050> mode

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
there is Blitzwing in here's a tank mode

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.950 
there is Blitzwing in here's a tank mode
and<00:02:37.440> it's<00:02:37.620> much<00:02:37.770> more<00:02:37.980> compact<00:02:38.720> it's<00:02:39.720> actually

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
and it's much more compact it's actually

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.480 
and it's much more compact it's actually
really<00:02:40.380> small<00:02:40.560> it's<00:02:40.800> smaller<00:02:41.040> than<00:02:41.130> a<00:02:41.250> lot<00:02:41.370> as

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
really small it's smaller than a lot as

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.190 
really small it's smaller than a lot as
it<00:02:41.580> looks<00:02:41.730> figures<00:02:42.060> so<00:02:42.630> it's<00:02:42.780> kind<00:02:42.990> of<00:02:43.020> weird

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
it looks figures so it's kind of weird

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.710 
it looks figures so it's kind of weird
are<00:02:43.410> we<00:02:43.440> and<00:02:44.430> such<00:02:44.640> a<00:02:44.730> spread<00:02:45.060> out<00:02:45.180> of<00:02:45.330> jet<00:02:45.510> mode

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
are we and such a spread out of jet mode

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.510 
are we and such a spread out of jet mode
and<00:02:45.990> robot<00:02:46.290> mode<00:02:46.440> and<00:02:46.620> you<00:02:46.680> just<00:02:46.800> maybe<00:02:46.980> can

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
and robot mode and you just maybe can

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.830 
and robot mode and you just maybe can
transform<00:02:47.940> into<00:02:48.150> something<00:02:48.360> that's<00:02:48.600> this

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
transform into something that's this

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.100 
transform into something that's this
small<00:02:50.420> just<00:02:51.420> looking<00:02:51.720> for<00:02:51.870> a<00:02:51.900> size<00:02:52.080> comparison

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
small just looking for a size comparison

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.630 
small just looking for a size comparison
I'll<00:02:52.860> just<00:02:52.980> do<00:02:53.130> it<00:02:53.160> that's<00:02:53.370> a<00:02:53.550> storm<00:02:53.820> again<00:02:55.640> so

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
I'll just do it that's a storm again so

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.200 
I'll just do it that's a storm again so
yeah<00:02:56.850> I<00:02:57.140> mean<00:02:58.140> acid<00:02:59.070> storm<00:02:59.280> was<00:02:59.490> about<00:02:59.880> as<00:03:00.060> long

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.210 
yeah I mean acid storm was about as long

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.780 
yeah I mean acid storm was about as long
as<00:03:00.390> blitz<00:03:00.570> swinging<00:03:00.840> jet<00:03:01.020> mode<00:03:01.490> you<00:03:02.490> know<00:03:02.580> now

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
as blitz swinging jet mode you know now

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.760 
as blitz swinging jet mode you know now
it's<00:03:03.060> gone<00:03:03.240> to<00:03:03.690> that<00:03:03.810> I<00:03:03.870> mean<00:03:03.990> acid<00:03:04.380> stops<00:03:04.620> not

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
it's gone to that I mean acid stops not

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.440 
it's gone to that I mean acid stops not
in<00:03:04.860> the<00:03:04.950> full<00:03:05.550> picture<00:03:05.910> what<00:03:06.240> you<00:03:06.300> know<00:03:06.390> you

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
in the full picture what you know you

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.660 
in the full picture what you know you
get<00:03:06.660> this<00:03:06.810> you<00:03:07.080> get<00:03:07.200> the<00:03:07.290> gist<00:03:07.500> of<00:03:07.590> it<00:03:07.710> so<00:03:08.520> yeah

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
get this you get the gist of it so yeah

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.170 
get this you get the gist of it so yeah
and<00:03:09.620> that's<00:03:10.620> comparison<00:03:11.100> with<00:03:11.220> a<00:03:11.250> same<00:03:11.940> mold

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
and that's comparison with a same mold

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.490 
and that's comparison with a same mold
they<00:03:12.450> even<00:03:12.600> know<00:03:12.690> I'm<00:03:12.810> doing<00:03:12.900> the<00:03:13.140> same<00:03:13.320> wall

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
they even know I'm doing the same wall

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.110 
they even know I'm doing the same wall
but<00:03:13.680> you<00:03:13.710> know<00:03:13.860> there<00:03:14.760> is<00:03:14.880> an<00:03:14.940> exit<00:03:15.180> thrust

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
but you know there is an exit thrust

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.880 
but you know there is an exit thrust
well<00:03:18.120> very<00:03:18.540> awesome<00:03:18.900> tank<00:03:19.140> mode<00:03:19.290> and<00:03:19.650> the

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
well very awesome tank mode and the

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:25.460 
well very awesome tank mode and the
turret<00:03:20.190> can<00:03:20.430> rotate<00:03:20.580> 360<00:03:21.420> degrees<00:03:24.350> so<00:03:25.350> yeah

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
turret can rotate 360 degrees so yeah

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.540 
turret can rotate 360 degrees so yeah
that's<00:03:25.800> why<00:03:25.890> it's<00:03:26.310> got<00:03:26.400> little<00:03:26.610> wheels<00:03:26.880> here

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.550 
that's why it's got little wheels here

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:31.160 
that's why it's got little wheels here
which<00:03:29.550> one<00:03:29.730> allowed<00:03:29.940> him<00:03:30.120> to<00:03:30.300> kind<00:03:30.630> of<00:03:30.810> sort<00:03:31.020> of

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
which one allowed him to kind of sort of

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.640 
which one allowed him to kind of sort of
roll<00:03:31.410> more<00:03:32.040> skidding<00:03:32.790> along<00:03:33.440> but<00:03:34.440> you<00:03:34.530> know

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
roll more skidding along but you know

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.310 
roll more skidding along but you know
whatever<00:03:34.890> and<00:03:35.220> it'll<00:03:35.640> actually<00:03:35.790> fire<00:03:36.320> both

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
whatever and it'll actually fire both

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.210 
whatever and it'll actually fire both
missiles

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.440 

so<00:03:41.220> yeah<00:03:41.370> that's<00:03:41.520> why<00:03:41.640> this<00:03:41.700> tank<00:03:42.000> mode<00:03:42.150> and

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
so yeah that's why this tank mode and

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.150 
so yeah that's why this tank mode and
transformation<00:03:43.140> to<00:03:43.260> robot<00:03:43.620> mode<00:03:43.770> is<00:03:43.860> actually

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
transformation to robot mode is actually

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:49.010 
transformation to robot mode is actually
kind<00:03:44.310> of<00:03:44.370> tall<00:03:44.580> so<00:03:46.430> so<00:03:47.430> yeah<00:03:47.550> we're<00:03:48.540> going<00:03:48.660> to

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:49.020 
kind of tall so so yeah we're going to

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:54.380 
kind of tall so so yeah we're going to
come<00:03:49.860> out<00:03:49.980> here<00:03:50.930> like<00:03:51.930> to<00:03:52.050> be<00:03:52.170> back<00:03:53.330> open<00:03:54.330> up

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
come out here like to be back open up

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.260 
come out here like to be back open up
this<00:03:54.510> panel<00:03:55.520> like<00:03:56.520> that<00:03:56.730> you<00:03:56.820> wanna<00:03:56.970> pull<00:03:57.240> out

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:57.270 
this panel like that you wanna pull out

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:02.420 
this panel like that you wanna pull out
this<00:03:57.510> little<00:03:57.570> heel<00:03:58.020> there<00:04:00.080> then<00:04:01.080> you<00:04:01.430> just

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
this little heel there then you just

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.100 
this little heel there then you just
pull<00:04:02.730> out<00:04:02.760> the<00:04:02.940> feet<00:04:05.240> like<00:04:06.240> that<00:04:06.270> then<00:04:06.720> fall

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
pull out the feet like that then fall

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:11.300 
pull out the feet like that then fall
down<00:04:07.310> the<00:04:08.310> legs<00:04:09.560> tight<00:04:10.560> close<00:04:10.830> those<00:04:10.980> panels

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
down the legs tight close those panels

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.590 
down the legs tight close those panels
back<00:04:11.430> over<00:04:12.350> for<00:04:13.350> that<00:04:13.470> heel

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:14.600 
back over for that heel

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:19.699 
back over for that heel
just<00:04:15.600> like<00:04:15.750> that<00:04:17.810> then<00:04:18.810> we're<00:04:19.290> gonna<00:04:19.410> rotate

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
just like that then we're gonna rotate

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.830 
just like that then we're gonna rotate
his<00:04:19.980> tank<00:04:20.250> to<00:04:20.340> her<00:04:20.459> up

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
his tank to her up

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.530 
his tank to her up
pull<00:04:22.410> this<00:04:22.560> off<00:04:22.770> there<00:04:23.040> on<00:04:23.550> tab<00:04:23.790> it<00:04:23.940> and<00:04:24.090> pull

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540 
pull this off there on tab it and pull
