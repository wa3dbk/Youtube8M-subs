00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.290
 gel polish in this at the request of ours 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:17.029

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:21.240
 optimal time for removing gel polish 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.169
 In-in coverage two weeks from the day 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:27.419
 applying for the beginning we will process the nails 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:29.640
 hard buff it will remove the gloss and 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:31.669
 will speed up the work gel remover 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.669
 varnish 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.340
 to protect the cuticle and the skin around 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.470
 the nail 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.310
 apply a small amount of any 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.310
 cuticle oil 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.620
 Now let's cut the most common 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.060
 cosmetic sponge into small pieces 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.060
 to the size of the nail 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.030
 generously applied to the resulting billet 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.410
 means for removing the gel varnish gel 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.690
 remover for nerds 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:14.900
 it remains only to wrap our tight 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.900
 marigold foil and wait 10-15 minutes 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.080
 Until means means where lacquer 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.880
 cover we destroy some 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.110
 process stereotypes 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.750
 gel polish remover 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.800
 firstly no 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.590
 special foil 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.630
 the most common approach in the kitchen 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.910
 second does not matter which side 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.450
 you will return your nails ki and glossy and 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.800
 matte foil equally effective 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.780
 critic do not expect that 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.880
 put my hand with ultraviolet foil 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.200
 lamp you will greatly speed up the process 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.450
 polish remover gel 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.790
 because foil reflects ultraviolet 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.290
 rays so they are just a little 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.190
 heat the nail well, that's 10 minutes flew by 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.619
 it's time to take the foil 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:01.050
 as you can see gel lacquer coating 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.820
 pretty well dissolved 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.100
 only remove its remnants with 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.360
 orange sticks or for example 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.360
 cuticle scapula 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.780
 that's all last time we go baf 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.940
 low abrasivity 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.599
 and the nail is clean and ready for the new 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.599
 gel polish coating 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:49.890
