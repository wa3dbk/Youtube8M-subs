00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
clicking it's time to replace it I

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.179 
clicking it's time to replace it I
ignored<00:00:27.810> it<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.109> I<00:00:28.410> waited<00:00:28.650> till<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.010> end

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189

another piece of plastic and a key
underneath<00:02:15.599> that<00:02:15.840> holds<00:02:16.230> it<00:02:16.380> um<00:02:17.310> we've<00:02:17.790> had

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
underneath that holds it um we've had

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.059 
underneath that holds it um we've had
some<00:02:18.120> extreme<00:02:18.599> cold<00:02:18.959> up<00:02:19.140> here<00:02:19.170> on<00:02:19.470> Long<00:02:19.620> Island

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
some extreme cold up here on Long Island

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.280 
some extreme cold up here on Long Island
in<00:02:20.160> the<00:02:20.220> last<00:02:20.400> two<00:02:20.670> weeks<00:02:20.700> and<00:02:21.180> I<00:02:21.930> think

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
in the last two weeks and I think

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.250 
in the last two weeks and I think
plastic<00:02:22.830> it<00:02:23.190> just<00:02:23.400> got<00:02:23.610> fatigued<00:02:24.090> and<00:02:24.390> it<00:02:24.989> just

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
plastic it just got fatigued and it just

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.710 
plastic it just got fatigued and it just
cracked<00:02:25.650> for<00:02:26.250> the<00:02:26.370> two<00:02:26.970> weeks<00:02:27.120> we<00:02:27.239> had<00:02:27.450> below

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
cracked for the two weeks we had below

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.890 
cracked for the two weeks we had below
zero<00:02:27.989> weather<00:02:28.610> and<00:02:29.610> it<00:02:29.760> just<00:02:29.970> bottom<00:02:30.660> falls

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
zero weather and it just bottom falls

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.620 
zero weather and it just bottom falls
out<00:02:31.110> and<00:02:31.349> everything<00:02:31.680> else<00:02:31.829> follows<00:02:32.150> so<00:02:33.150> you

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
out and everything else follows so you

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.390 
out and everything else follows so you
got<00:02:33.780> to<00:02:33.870> be<00:02:33.959> really<00:02:34.470> careful<00:02:34.650> once<00:02:35.040> you<00:02:35.190> hear

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
got to be really careful once you hear

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.660 
got to be really careful once you hear
that<00:02:35.430> pop<00:02:35.849> that<00:02:36.750> it's<00:02:37.079> time<00:02:37.290> to<00:02:37.470> replace<00:02:37.709> it<00:02:37.829> so

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
that pop that it's time to replace it so

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.940 
that pop that it's time to replace it so
anyway<00:02:39.060> to<00:02:39.480> get<00:02:39.630> it<00:02:39.750> done<00:02:39.959> make<00:02:40.620> sure<00:02:40.769> that

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
anyway to get it done make sure that

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.479
