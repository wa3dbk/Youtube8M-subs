00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.509
 hello to all the future of the djs yes 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.849
 as the title says a theme that few 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.860
 pay attention is something serious that is 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.410
 happening all over the world because every 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.630
 day culture is losing more and more 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.660
 since the digital era is killing 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.490
 the being dj yes although many say what 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.279
 otherwise they bring new 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.220
 tools and digital media and others 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.199
 things the truth is that today the 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.869
 market is full of controllers of 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.149
 every day a new one comes out 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.610
 you can find Chinese trinkets and 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.010
 Extremely expensive brands 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.559
 recognized now you can be a dj with a 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.590
 simple pc and a controller of 100 euros 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:46.289
 you download from the web programs like 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.260
 tractor or virtual dj pirated with 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.809
 crack and everything weigh 200 megabytes and what 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.000
 you install the same as you already have software 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.329
 mixtures according to the statistics of the 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.219
 software companies in their annual report 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:01.199
 they claim that 80 percent of the djs 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.040
 and in Latin America they work with software 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.290
 of pirate mixes 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:08.520
 now the next step is to put in 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:12.010
 google music house techno minimal 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:15.190
 download and you will leave links to 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:17.230
 download thousands of free tracks until 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.090
 we can find the latest successes of 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.100
 the great beat port music page and 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.920
 all free with just one click music 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.570
 pirated by other users if it's a 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.550
 of the biggest music pages 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.370
 electronic that every day 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.770
 update songs or tracks almost 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:35.650
 300 thousand topics per day and sell them to a 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:39.640
 very low cost from 99 cents 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:41.200
 euros up to 3 euros most of the 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.630
 electronic music producers 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.880
 they also download pirated software 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:49.420
 to create this same as he speaks tom 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:51.700
 logic or reason and thousands of samples or 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.130
 loops on the web now do not put love 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.800
 to make music they do it like a 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:59.470
 competition the one that has more songs 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:02.140
 created to go up fast to beat port 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:05.950
 and brag about looking for some seal that 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:08.410
 upload your tracks because because in big 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:11.500
 port do not give him everything 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:14.860
 of what it says the track costs 50 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.560
 is for beat port and the other 50% is for 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:20.980
 the record label and the producer 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:23.080
 receives only 25% of all this 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.590
 so if a track costs 99 cents 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:29.080
 the producer will receive 24 cents per 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.420
 every download for that song he made 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.190
 it took hours and hours doing a fucking 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.290
 track that if it really is 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.900
 extremely good and with a sound of 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.690
 fucking mother will be in the top 100 maximum 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.910
 a week then how I repeat are more than 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.940
 300 thousand tracks that are published per day 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.860
 in beatport your song will go to the 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.960
 history in just a few days and it will be 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.930
 digital junk now let alone the 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:55.390
 small record labels that only 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.490
 listen to the same friends of the producer 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.950
 who is responsible for doing stupid 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:02.710
 advertising on facebook and twitter for 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.570
 achieve to sell something in bridgeport is a 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.940
 war of never ending producers ' 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:09.130
 seen so mediocre types that do and 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.800
 they upload a song in the morning and in the 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.390
 night they already have another list to upload 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.350
 you believe that there is love or passion in 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.630
 this 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:19.150
 just for the simple fact of having more themes 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:22.270
 and to believe the maximum now we return in 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.740
 the past when the dj was exclusive by 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:26.320
 his music because he did it with 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:29.200
 analog synthesizers and it took months 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:31.090
 in doing a track that if someone wanted 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.370
 play his music had to buy the 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.710
 vinyl or the original CD and really 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:38.230
 I had to know how to mix and match 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:41.260
 issues come out of trouble not like today 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.540
 that with a fucking button called zinc what 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:46.090
 they do but people will say I play with 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.550
 pioneer cdj because I do not like the 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.680
 fish to touch but today is the 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:53.590
 same shit as pioners to tail cdj 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.690
 2000 nexus that includes zinc button now 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.780
 you imagine how many sons of bitches who do not 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:00.610
 they know how to mix they're going to be dj like 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.400
 they did with the macbook to up law the 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:06.490
 native instruments controllers x1 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:08.380
 they believed dj and they only use the zinc button there 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:11.170
 uncles today who are so mediocre 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:13.000
 that can not tie two subjects the cdj 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:16.000
 normal of the classics 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.329
 cdj thousand only prick if you carry your macbook 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.150
 and his tractor until the time of 2002 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:23.949
 it was perfect for the djs nothing of 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.379
 drivers and nothing software is 

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:29.620
 you had to know how to really click 

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:31.389
 can click on a disc or on a king or 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.759
 be that because of this is dying 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:36.370
 slowly the guilt of the digital age 

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:38.379
 but to finish there's a good thing about 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:41.860
 all this and it's from someone who we have not 

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:44.229
 spoken is the vinyl acetate lp or as 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.270
 what you want to call it is fashionable again 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:48.159
 has returned in europe people are 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:51.189
 saturated with the facilities and vagrancy 

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:52.870
 of the djs so they are picking up the 

00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:54.729
 better format the vinyl and they are 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.830
 turning the mythical turntables 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:59.620
 techniques since mastering these is the 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:02.949
 jane real work of sound is 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:04.629
 special and very warm so a house 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:06.729
 record companies that produce vinyl only 

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:08.530
 press the best topics and at least one 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:10.840
 500 lot if you want your music 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:14.349
 be on vinyl but people will say 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:17.439
 vinyl is old format the big dj's 

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:19.689
 click with mac and pioneer and yes yes but 

00:05:17.439 --> 00:05:22.360
 if you go see these guys have been for years 

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:24.699
 and vinyl only played before them 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.870
 nowadays they do it for convenience because 

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:28.450
 they travel a lot 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:30.700
 and they are so globally recognized that 

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:33.850
 people do not care what they use 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:35.620
 so I put a recorded being and all this 

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:37.510
 it is summed up that very soon it will be over 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:40.300
 the digital garbage and all the real ones 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:42.490
 they will return to the vinyl site you are right 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:45.640
 but almost nobody plays with vinyl and it's very 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:48.790
 expensive that's because you do not know what you say 

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:51.460
 by benzing ricardo villalobos 10,000 is 

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:54.160
 bernardo hangar sven vath and many more 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:58.120
 they have kept the format where 

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:59.830
 then buy vinyls from seven euros and 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:02.350
 those that are on offer from two euros 

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:04.570
 you know in records and create course 

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:09.430
 some others so if you're thinking 

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:12.910
 to be dj buy a techniques as 1200 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:15.340
 m2 and a decent mixer and do not spend that your 

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:17.560
 money in digital waste so you value what 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:20.020
 what do you do and every vinyl you buy what 

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:22.810
 you will feel and the music will be there 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:25.810
 on your vinyl it only depends on your dexterity 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:28.150
 and from your ear I hope that this video will 

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:32.730
 open your eyes and make them realize 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:32.730
 in the quality that we are living
