you<00:00:35.640> know<00:00:35.760> what<00:00:35.910> let's<00:00:36.090> talk<00:00:36.300> about<00:00:36.450> height

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
you know what let's talk about height

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.010

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
at this guy a whole lot but he seems to

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.760 
at this guy a whole lot but he seems to
me<00:01:09.120> that<00:01:09.390> either<00:01:09.510> he's<00:01:09.840> his<00:01:10.320> joints<00:01:10.680> are

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
me that either he's his joints are

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.440 
me that either he's his joints are
really<00:01:11.070> really<00:01:11.460> stuck<00:01:11.760> or<00:01:12.030> he<00:01:12.180> just<00:01:12.330> doesn't

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
really really stuck or he just doesn't

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.330 
really really stuck or he just doesn't
have<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.780> articulation<00:01:13.560> that<00:01:13.680> we<00:01:13.800> saw<00:01:14.010> in

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
have the articulation that we saw in

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.290 
have the articulation that we saw in
rush<00:01:14.730> with<00:01:15.420> Mega<00:01:15.720> Man<00:01:15.990> so<00:01:16.560> I<00:01:16.590> think<00:01:16.800> that<00:01:17.340> the

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:18.300 
rush with Mega Man so I think that the

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.970 
rush with Mega Man so I think that the
only<00:01:18.390> thing<00:01:18.600> I'm<00:01:18.690> sure<00:01:18.720> about<00:01:19.140> is<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.650> head<00:01:19.830> is

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:19.980 
only thing I'm sure about is the head is

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.800 
only thing I'm sure about is the head is
on<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.130> giant<00:01:20.580> big<00:01:20.760> fat<00:01:21.000> ball<00:01:21.270> peg<00:01:21.510> so<00:01:21.690> it's

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
on a giant big fat ball peg so it's

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.780 
on a giant big fat ball peg so it's
pretty<00:01:21.990> limited<00:01:22.200> but<00:01:22.650> he<00:01:23.340> still<00:01:23.580> looks

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
pretty limited but he still looks

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.580 
pretty limited but he still looks
awesome<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.300> purple<00:01:24.630> metallic<00:01:25.080> is<00:01:25.230> great

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
awesome the purple metallic is great

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.770 
awesome the purple metallic is great
there's<00:01:26.520> lots<00:01:26.790> of<00:01:26.940> different<00:01:27.330> colors<00:01:27.660> going

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
there's lots of different colors going

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.190 
there's lots of different colors going
on<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.380> sculpt<00:01:28.710> work<00:01:28.860> is<00:01:29.010> fantastic<00:01:30.000> I<00:01:30.240> don't

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
on the sculpt work is fantastic I don't

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.660 
on the sculpt work is fantastic I don't
know<00:01:31.320> about<00:01:31.500> anything<00:01:31.860> else<00:01:32.160> as<00:01:32.400> far<00:01:32.430> as

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
know about anything else as far as

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.760 
know about anything else as far as
articulation<00:01:33.480> goes<00:01:33.660> it<00:01:34.020> looks<00:01:34.200> like<00:01:34.440> the<00:01:34.590> feet

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
articulation goes it looks like the feet

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.650 
articulation goes it looks like the feet
are<00:01:34.890> articulated<00:01:35.550> but<00:01:36.030> then<00:01:36.180> they<00:01:36.330> don't<00:01:36.450> want

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:36.660 
are articulated but then they don't want

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.510 
are articulated but then they don't want
to<00:01:36.750> move<00:01:36.900> so<00:01:38.030> I'm<00:01:39.030> not<00:01:39.300> gonna<00:01:39.510> stress<00:01:39.960> it<00:01:40.170> and

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
to move so I'm not gonna stress it and

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.590 
to move so I'm not gonna stress it and
I'm<00:01:41.520> guessing<00:01:41.970> that<00:01:42.000> there's<00:01:42.270> really<00:01:42.420> not

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
I'm guessing that there's really not

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.330 
I'm guessing that there's really not
much<00:01:42.810> anybody's<00:01:43.260> gonna<00:01:43.410> do<00:01:43.680> as<00:01:43.800> far<00:01:43.830> as<00:01:44.010> posing

Buster<00:03:36.400> whatever<00:03:36.670> you<00:03:36.790> want<00:03:36.910> to<00:03:36.970> call<00:03:37.150> it<00:03:37.330> so

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
Buster whatever you want to call it so

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:38.730 
Buster whatever you want to call it so
it's<00:03:38.020> pretty<00:03:38.200> cool

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:38.740 
it's pretty cool

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:43.230 
it's pretty cool
the<00:03:39.700> articulation<00:03:40.390> the<00:03:40.420> head<00:03:40.570> is<00:03:40.930> on<00:03:41.200> a<00:03:42.240> kind

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:43.240 
the articulation the head is on a kind

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.490 
the articulation the head is on a kind
of<00:03:43.300> like<00:03:43.510> a<00:03:43.540> ball<00:03:43.810> hinge<00:03:44.050> it's<00:03:44.230> a<00:03:44.290> little

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
of like a ball hinge it's a little

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.190 
of like a ball hinge it's a little
different<00:03:44.650> than<00:03:44.830> the<00:03:45.070> SH<00:03:45.940> figure<00:03:46.300> arts<00:03:46.570> but

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
different than the SH figure arts but

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.140 
different than the SH figure arts but
it's<00:03:47.350> effectively<00:03:48.130> the<00:03:48.280> same<00:03:48.730> I<00:03:48.910> mean<00:03:49.000> you'll

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
it's effectively the same I mean you'll

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.940 
it's effectively the same I mean you'll
get<00:03:49.240> any<00:03:49.450> posing<00:03:49.870> you<00:03:49.930> want<00:03:50.110> out<00:03:50.290> of<00:03:50.410> it<00:03:50.590> the

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
get any posing you want out of it the

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.220 
get any posing you want out of it the
neck<00:03:51.130> is<00:03:51.280> on<00:03:51.370> a<00:03:51.430> ball<00:03:51.700> peg<00:03:52.000> the<00:03:52.510> shoulders<00:03:52.990> are

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
neck is on a ball peg the shoulders are

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.950 
neck is on a ball peg the shoulders are
on<00:03:53.260> floating<00:03:53.920> ball<00:03:54.100> hinges<00:03:54.700> so<00:03:55.450> those<00:03:55.750> can

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:55.960 
on floating ball hinges so those can

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.740 
on floating ball hinges so those can
just<00:03:56.790> slide<00:03:57.790> around<00:03:57.940> like<00:03:58.210> that<00:03:58.480> and<00:03:58.540> then

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
just slide around like that and then

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.080 
just slide around like that and then
it's<00:03:58.990> the<00:03:59.110> hinge<00:03:59.320> in<00:03:59.560> the<00:03:59.710> shoulder<00:04:00.130> the<00:04:00.670> bicep

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
it's the hinge in the shoulder the bicep

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
course I'm not his arm off they are a

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:16.620 
course I'm not his arm off they are a
little<00:04:15.550> loose<00:04:15.790> though<00:04:16.000> I<00:04:16.030> wish<00:04:16.270> you<00:04:16.450> could

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
little loose though I wish you could

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.720 
little loose though I wish you could
actually<00:04:17.020> pose<00:04:17.380> those<00:04:17.709> but<00:04:18.340> they<00:04:18.459> kind<00:04:18.700> of

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:18.730 
actually pose those but they kind of

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:20.610 
actually pose those but they kind of
just<00:04:18.910> sit<00:04:19.120> wherever<00:04:19.239> you<00:04:19.510> put<00:04:19.720> the<00:04:19.870> arm<00:04:20.049> it's

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
just sit wherever you put the arm it's

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.260 
just sit wherever you put the arm it's
not<00:04:20.770> a<00:04:20.799> horrible<00:04:21.130> situation<00:04:21.820> but<00:04:21.850> it<00:04:22.030> could<00:04:22.150> be

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
not a horrible situation but it could be

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.840 
not a horrible situation but it could be
better<00:04:22.420> here's<00:04:23.110> a<00:04:23.200> double<00:04:23.530> hinged<00:04:23.950> elbow<00:04:24.460> with

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 
better here's a double hinged elbow with

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:26.610 
better here's a double hinged elbow with
the<00:04:25.000> floating<00:04:25.270> piece<00:04:25.630> in<00:04:25.840> the<00:04:25.930> middle<00:04:26.230> to<00:04:26.380> hide

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
the floating piece in the middle to hide

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.890 
the floating piece in the middle to hide
the<00:04:26.830> articulation<00:04:27.490> from<00:04:27.670> the<00:04:27.880> back<00:04:28.090> so<00:04:28.690> that's

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
the articulation from the back so that's

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.100 
the articulation from the back so that's
cool<00:04:29.520> slightly<00:04:30.520> better<00:04:30.790> design<00:04:31.270> this<00:04:31.510> time<00:04:31.780> to

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
cool slightly better design this time to

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.110 
cool slightly better design this time to
peg<00:04:32.350> in<00:04:32.530> the<00:04:33.220> alternate<00:04:33.669> arms<00:04:33.970> and

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
peg in the alternate arms and

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.820 
peg in the alternate arms and
having<00:04:34.479> a<00:04:34.540> weird<00:04:34.780> little<00:04:34.930> hook-shaped<00:04:35.530> thing

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
having a weird little hook-shaped thing

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.280 
having a weird little hook-shaped thing
it's<00:04:36.010> more<00:04:36.400> of<00:04:36.490> a<00:04:36.580> straight<00:04:36.880> peg<00:04:37.150> that<00:04:37.840> goes<00:04:38.050> in

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.290 
it's more of a straight peg that goes in

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:39.750 
it's more of a straight peg that goes in
there<00:04:38.530> and<00:04:38.770> like<00:04:38.949> I<00:04:39.040> said<00:04:39.100> you<00:04:39.310> can<00:04:39.430> just<00:04:39.580> swap

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:39.760 
there and like I said you can just swap

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.480 
there and like I said you can just swap
it<00:04:39.940> out<00:04:40.030> with<00:04:40.090> the<00:04:40.389> Buster<00:04:40.780> if<00:04:40.870> you<00:04:40.990> want<00:04:41.490> or

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
it out with the Buster if you want or

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.600 
it out with the Buster if you want or
you<00:04:43.090> could<00:04:43.210> just<00:04:43.330> not<00:04:43.510> put<00:04:43.690> it<00:04:43.780> back<00:04:43.960> in<00:04:44.139> at<00:04:44.290> all

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
you could just not put it back in at all

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.610 
you could just not put it back in at all
it<00:04:45.610> is<00:04:45.639> a<00:04:45.790> little<00:04:46.060> tricky<00:04:46.360> to<00:04:46.389> get<00:04:46.600> these<00:04:46.780> parts

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
it is a little tricky to get these parts

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.439 
it is a little tricky to get these parts
to<00:04:47.800> swap<00:04:48.010> out<00:04:48.250> but<00:04:48.550> it's<00:04:48.669> not<00:04:48.790> too<00:04:49.000> bad<00:04:49.240> once

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:49.449 
to swap out but it's not too bad once

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:51.360 
to swap out but it's not too bad once
you<00:04:49.510> get<00:04:49.660> used<00:04:49.720> to<00:04:50.020> it<00:04:50.110> the<00:04:50.560> hands<00:04:50.919> are<00:04:51.010> just<00:04:51.160> on

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
you get used to it the hands are just on

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.850 
you get used to it the hands are just on
a<00:04:51.400> simple<00:04:51.729> ball<00:04:52.090> peg<00:04:52.389> so<00:04:52.990> it's<00:04:53.139> fairly<00:04:53.500> limited

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
a simple ball peg so it's fairly limited

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.879 
a simple ball peg so it's fairly limited
but<00:04:54.400> you'll<00:04:54.820> probably<00:04:55.110> get<00:04:56.110> enough<00:04:56.410> out<00:04:56.590> of<00:04:56.770> it

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:56.889 
but you'll probably get enough out of it

00:04:56.889 --> 00:04:58.140 
but you'll probably get enough out of it
that<00:04:56.979> it<00:04:57.100> won't<00:04:57.340> be<00:04:57.430> a<00:04:57.460> problem

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
that it won't be a problem

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.600 
that it won't be a problem
torso<00:04:58.930> is<00:04:59.050> on<00:04:59.139> a<00:04:59.169> double<00:04:59.530> ball<00:04:59.740> peg<00:05:00.010> the<00:05:00.310> upper

torso is on a double ball peg the upper
torso<00:05:00.840> hidden<00:05:01.840> well<00:05:02.050> by<00:05:02.290> the<00:05:02.350> fact<00:05:02.680> that<00:05:02.800> he

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
torso hidden well by the fact that he

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.770 
torso hidden well by the fact that he
has<00:05:03.010> the<00:05:03.190> chest<00:05:03.430> armor<00:05:03.820> there<00:05:04.030> so<00:05:04.330> that's<00:05:04.510> cool

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
has the chest armor there so that's cool

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:06.930 
has the chest armor there so that's cool
then<00:05:05.290> the<00:05:05.440> lower<00:05:05.620> torso<00:05:05.919> is<00:05:06.190> on<00:05:06.280> a<00:05:06.310> single<00:05:06.760> ball

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940 
then the lower torso is on a single ball

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:10.140 
then the lower torso is on a single ball
peg<00:05:07.440> again<00:05:08.440> pretty<00:05:09.280> effective<00:05:09.850> you<00:05:09.910> can<00:05:09.970> get

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
peg again pretty effective you can get

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:11.640 
peg again pretty effective you can get
pretty<00:05:10.360> good<00:05:10.449> range<00:05:10.840> of<00:05:10.960> motion<00:05:11.110> out<00:05:11.380> of<00:05:11.470> this

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.650 
pretty good range of motion out of this

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:13.980 
pretty good range of motion out of this
guy<00:05:11.860> and<00:05:12.610> it<00:05:12.789> looks<00:05:12.970> pretty<00:05:13.300> good<00:05:13.479> either<00:05:13.720> way

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990 
guy and it looks pretty good either way

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.080 
guy and it looks pretty good either way
so<00:05:14.050> I<00:05:14.229> like<00:05:14.440> that<00:05:14.470> then<00:05:15.250> his<00:05:15.400> hips<00:05:15.639> are<00:05:15.940> on

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090 
so I like that then his hips are on

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:18.240 
so I like that then his hips are on
these<00:05:16.270> weird<00:05:16.539> kind<00:05:16.810> of<00:05:16.960> ball<00:05:17.110> hinges<00:05:17.650> with

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.250 
these weird kind of ball hinges with

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:20.279 
these weird kind of ball hinges with
these<00:05:18.430> little<00:05:18.580> collars<00:05:19.030> around<00:05:19.389> them<00:05:19.600> pretty

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:20.289 
these little collars around them pretty

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:24.000 
these little collars around them pretty
good<00:05:20.500> range<00:05:20.710> of<00:05:20.860> motion<00:05:21.660> not<00:05:22.660> a<00:05:23.050> huge<00:05:23.860> amount

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:24.010 
good range of motion not a huge amount

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:27.060 
good range of motion not a huge amount
but<00:05:24.340> definitely<00:05:25.210> enough<00:05:25.330> so<00:05:25.930> that's<00:05:26.139> okay<00:05:26.500> he

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:27.070 
but definitely enough so that's okay he

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:29.100 
but definitely enough so that's okay he
has<00:05:27.220> double<00:05:27.550> hinge<00:05:27.789> knees<00:05:28.060> just<00:05:28.750> like<00:05:28.840> the

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
has double hinge knees just like the

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:32.550 
has double hinge knees just like the
arms<00:05:29.970> the<00:05:30.970> problem<00:05:31.389> with<00:05:31.570> this<00:05:31.780> is<00:05:32.110> that<00:05:32.139> the

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560 
arms the problem with this is that the

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.800 
arms the problem with this is that the
slip<00:05:32.860> joint<00:05:32.889> type<00:05:33.430> of<00:05:33.580> thing<00:05:33.760> on<00:05:33.910> here<00:05:34.180> doesn't

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:34.810 
slip joint type of thing on here doesn't

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:37.409 
slip joint type of thing on here doesn't
work<00:05:34.960> as<00:05:35.139> well<00:05:35.320> as<00:05:35.440> on<00:05:35.560> the<00:05:35.680> elbows<00:05:36.070> so<00:05:36.610> you're

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:37.419 
work as well as on the elbows so you're

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:39.900 
work as well as on the elbows so you're
gonna<00:05:37.539> see<00:05:37.750> a<00:05:37.780> gap<00:05:38.050> sometimes<00:05:38.650> like<00:05:39.520> down<00:05:39.729> in

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:39.910 
gonna see a gap sometimes like down in

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:42.719 
gonna see a gap sometimes like down in
there<00:05:40.150> so<00:05:40.930> that's<00:05:41.139> not<00:05:41.320> ideal<00:05:41.430> so<00:05:42.430> just<00:05:42.639> don't

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:42.729 
there so that's not ideal so just don't

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:44.210 
there so that's not ideal so just don't
bend<00:05:42.940> them<00:05:43.060> all<00:05:43.150> the<00:05:43.240> way<00:05:43.360> and<00:05:43.450> you'll<00:05:43.539> be<00:05:43.660> okay

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:44.220 
bend them all the way and you'll be okay

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.830 
bend them all the way and you'll be okay
and<00:05:45.220> then<00:05:45.340> the<00:05:45.460> ankles<00:05:45.820> have<00:05:46.450> that<00:05:46.630> weird

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:46.840 
and then the ankles have that weird

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.379 
and then the ankles have that weird
convoluted<00:05:47.530> ball<00:05:48.520> peg<00:05:48.849> ball<00:05:49.120> hinge

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:49.389 
convoluted ball peg ball hinge

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:51.089 
convoluted ball peg ball hinge
combination<00:05:50.169> you<00:05:50.320> can<00:05:50.410> kind<00:05:50.710> of<00:05:50.770> see<00:05:50.889> what's

00:05:51.089 --> 00:05:51.099 
combination you can kind of see what's

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:53.490 
combination you can kind of see what's
going<00:05:51.160> on<00:05:51.430> in<00:05:51.610> there<00:05:51.820> to<00:05:52.510> articulate<00:05:53.320> these
