having<00:01:27.840> anything<00:01:28.049> on<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.350> ground<00:01:28.650> so<00:01:29.159> he

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
having anything on the ground so he

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.340 
having anything on the ground so he
built<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.579> couple<00:01:29.970> some<00:01:30.180> colonias<00:01:30.689> as<00:01:30.900> both<00:01:31.170> of

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
built a couple some colonias as both of

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.870 
built a couple some colonias as both of
his<00:01:31.409> bases<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:31.979> some<00:01:32.100> zerglings<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.610> defend

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
his bases and some zerglings to defend

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.219 
his bases and some zerglings to defend
as<00:01:32.970> well<00:01:33.119> he's<00:01:33.299> got<00:01:33.479> good<00:01:33.720> positioning<00:01:34.170> on

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
as well he's got good positioning on

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.450 
as well he's got good positioning on
those<00:01:34.350> songs<00:01:34.500> as<00:01:34.680> well<00:01:34.740> so<00:01:35.220> he's<00:01:35.340> actually

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
those songs as well so he's actually

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.910 
those songs as well so he's actually
pretty<00:01:35.820> well<00:01:36.060> defended<00:01:36.420> against<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:37.619> zealot

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
pretty well defended against the zealot

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.440 
pretty well defended against the zealot
counter-attack<00:01:38.340> that<00:01:38.520> obviously<00:01:38.820> uh<00:01:38.939> that

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
counter-attack that obviously uh that

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.410 
counter-attack that obviously uh that
did<00:01:39.630> not<00:01:39.750> work<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:40.700> any<00:01:41.700> DTS<00:01:42.090> or<00:01:42.210> anything

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
did not work and any DTS or anything

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.149 
did not work and any DTS or anything
like<00:01:42.450> that<00:01:42.570> looks<00:01:43.530> like<00:01:43.619> it's<00:01:43.770> gonna<00:01:43.829> come<00:01:44.040> in

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
like that looks like it's gonna come in

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.200 
like that looks like it's gonna come in
here<00:01:44.220> and<00:01:44.340> try<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.549> pick<00:01:44.640> off<00:01:44.759> some<00:01:44.909> stuff<00:01:45.090> in

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
here and try and pick off some stuff in

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.670 
here and try and pick off some stuff in
the<00:01:45.270> main<00:01:45.420> again<00:01:45.659> I<00:01:45.840> really<00:01:46.290> think<00:01:46.380> he<00:01:46.530> does

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
the main again I really think he does

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.980 
the main again I really think he does
need<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:46.950> do<00:01:47.070> some<00:01:47.220> more<00:01:47.250> harassment<00:01:47.520> here

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
need to do some more harassment here

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.240 
need to do some more harassment here
since<00:01:48.990> he's<00:01:49.140> got<00:01:49.380> this<00:01:49.530> advantage<00:01:49.950> he's<00:01:50.100> got

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
since he's got this advantage he's got

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.630 
since he's got this advantage he's got
this<00:01:50.369> error<00:01:50.549> advantage<00:01:50.640> he's<00:01:51.299> forced<00:01:52.640> Britney

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
this error advantage he's forced Britney

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.999 
this error advantage he's forced Britney
to<00:01:53.729> get<00:01:53.820> lot<00:01:54.119> of<00:01:54.149> ground<00:01:54.630> a<00:01:54.930> lot<00:01:55.409> of<00:01:55.530> Defense's

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
to get lot of ground a lot of Defense's

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.620 
to get lot of ground a lot of Defense's
on<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.189> ground<00:01:56.369> you<00:01:56.700> know<00:01:56.790> archons<00:01:57.240> what<00:01:57.479> have
