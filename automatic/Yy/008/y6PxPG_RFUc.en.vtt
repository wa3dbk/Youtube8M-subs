00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.529
 gives 

00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:08.529
 film science today human energy 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:19.070
 neo awake 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:22.250
 wake up or you are the chosen one 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:25.450
 complete your training 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.450
 already according to you 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:29.779
 show it 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.910
 Y 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:53.100
 and dance 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.100
 Y 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:59.570
 well done or black thank you but because 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.000
 my eyes hurt because never before 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.860
 you had used them, humanity is 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.470
 being exploited by machines 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.909
 the matrix generates a virtual life that does not 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:12.070
 it is real 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:16.159
 Hey, Mr. Alderson, or should I say, 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:21.570
 He denied that what he hears is the sound of what 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:26.940
 inevitable that is the sound of his death 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:29.729
 what are you talking about I am the agent smith he 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:33.000
 come to reconnect it to the 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:36.540
 matrix to be happy again if 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.580
 I see you do not pay attention to him or do not care 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.979
 your happiness all you want is 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.580
 connect a machine to extract your 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.310
 Energy 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:47.810
 you do not see it but it's being yours to 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.810
 connect it to the matrix 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.060
 do not 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:55.880
 but the Lord of you must 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.980
 say but the doctor says it for you 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.890
 this is very dangerous 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:03.980
 yes doctor because if it is not 110 and the 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.720
 agent smith comes with a wire to 220 and 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:08.510
 we plug it into a cne transformer or 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:11.060
 busting that does not work and in fiction 

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:13.460
 the premise that the machines that 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.050
 they dominate the world they need energy and 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.300
 as the main source of energy that 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.010
 is the sun is no longer available cultivate 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.290
 to human beings just to 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.510
 extract your energy but what an idea 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.680
 macabre doctor imagine that a mind 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:29.270
 perverse have that idea cunda the example 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.370
 cultivate people to extract energy and 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.290
 make the appliance work 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.010
 house or whatever it is not either 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.900
 it would work 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.510
 it is true that the human body generates 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.370
 energy person generates from nothing the 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.410
 generates just from another 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.360
 source of energy the food that we eat 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.260
 that's true because if we eat a 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.360
 roast 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.770
 the vaquita that we eat previously 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.010
 He must have eaten something that gives 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:53.360
 energy and there gave in the key the 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.480
 plants and other organisms 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.129
 photosynthetics use solar energy 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.840
 the carbon dioxide of the air for 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:01.700
 produce another type of compounds in 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.400
 certain way they transform the energy 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.379
 light in chemical energy animals 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.900
 that eat the plants get that 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:11.060
 energy and other animals like 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.769
 humans eat those animals and also 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.599
 getting energy from well to good 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:16.940
 then it means that the energy that 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:18.890
 we need to live comes 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.379
 of the sun without the sun the cycle ends 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.970
 vital and therefore there is no food that 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:25.250
 is one of the main problems of the 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.290
 doctor's matrix argument no but I 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.840
 I saw the movie seven times five 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.690
 Sometimes I saw film I saw twice 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.579
 cable because I really did not understand it 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.870
 well and there they say that these people do not 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:39.440
 fed in a traditional way 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:42.079
 but they would ingest their nutrients 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:45.019
 through a kind of liquefied 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:47.660
 they did with dead people it 's the same no 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:49.519
 closes in each cycle you lose a little 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:52.220
 of energy if I eat a steak 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:53.780
 I incorporate that energy into my body but 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.879
 even if I 'm not doing anything even if I'm 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.040
 asleep, energy is being wasted 

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:59.959
 example in the vital organs by another 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.030
 side each time a type is transformed 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:03.770
 of energy in another one also loses a 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.990
 portion of that energy in shape 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:08.750
 doctor to see suppose that I 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:11.240
 will connect to the matrix with the loss of 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:14.210
 energy and I should ingest more than 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:16.489
 a person to get that energy very 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:18.530
 well generation after generation would go 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:20.450
 losing in the energy of the bodies and 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.250
 as there is no other source of energy anymore 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:24.740
 the sun is no longer available 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.510
 then the machines that 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.580
 they dominate the world they are going to end up in two 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:29.870
 or three generations doctor who you think 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.850
 always decide talking about this from 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:34.700
 eat the neighbors do not go back to the 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:38.590
 movie and let's go with that 93 I think 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.590
 perfect the one of the accurate shots 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.610
 remember that you are so fast that you can 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:47.960
 circumvent certain laws of physics 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.960
 dodge the bullets 

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:08.130
 and I see that it cost him a little physically and 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:09.419
 I think of a doctor who would have to try 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.830
 a little less talk and 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:13.009
 congresses and do a little more 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.009
 exercise
