00:00:14.152 --> 00:00:51.479
Ah -

00:00:58.468 --> 00:01:06.781
When the bright Big Dipper

00:01:06.781 --> 00:01:16.022
in the sky we see

00:01:16.022 --> 00:01:25.612
Father General

00:01:25.612 --> 00:01:34.807
We ask ourselves where you are now

00:01:34.807 --> 00:01:43.375
Light shines at the window

00:01:43.375 --> 00:01:52.315
of the Supreme Headquarters

00:01:52.315 --> 00:02:02.392
General! Out there somewhere

00:02:02.392 --> 00:02:11.425
Where are you sure to be?

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:33.693
Even in dreams we miss you

00:02:33.693 --> 00:02:42.958
Fatherly General

00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:52.246
Awake we want to meet

00:02:52.246 --> 00:03:01.418
Our General

00:03:01.418 --> 00:03:09.568
Though we're far away from you

00:03:09.568 --> 00:03:19.436
Looking up to the northern sky

00:03:19.436 --> 00:03:28.956
We greet you each morning

00:03:28.956 --> 00:03:36.921
Please receive our best wishes

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:17.045
- Ah

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:29.189
Fatherly General!

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:39.917
- Ah

00:04:39.917 --> 00:04:50.203
Where are you?

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:01.999
Benevolent parental love

00:05:01.999 --> 00:05:09.406
That you value high

00:05:09.406 --> 00:05:16.813
shines as the first rays in the morning

00:05:16.813 --> 00:05:23.152
Revealing the right path

00:05:23.152 --> 00:05:30.513
To the General

00:05:30.513 --> 00:05:37.479
At the Supreme Headquarters

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:48.694
After much deliberation - After much deliberation

00:05:48.694 --> 00:06:01.442
We will find the way to you
