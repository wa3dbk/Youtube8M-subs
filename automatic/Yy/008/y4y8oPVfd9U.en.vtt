00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
coming up true to color right here it's

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:45.620 
coming up true to color right here it's
a<00:04:40.460> probably<00:04:41.460> a<00:04:41.580> medium<00:04:42.000> toned<00:04:42.330> orange<00:04:44.630> it's

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
a probably a medium toned orange it's

a probably a medium toned orange it's
coming<00:04:45.990> up<00:04:46.140> more<00:04:46.290> copper<00:04:46.800> let<00:04:47.190> me<00:04:47.280> wipe<00:04:47.460> my
