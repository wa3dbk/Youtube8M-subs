I<00:00:10.700> was<00:00:11.700> tougher<00:00:12.360> than<00:00:12.389> last<00:00:12.719> year's<00:00:13.049> the<00:00:13.889> last

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
I was tougher than last year's the last

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.390 
I was tougher than last year's the last
cycles<00:00:14.960> qualifying<00:00:15.960> round<00:00:16.230> so<00:00:16.590> which<00:00:17.220> is<00:00:17.250> a

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
cycles qualifying round so which is a

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.400 
cycles qualifying round so which is a
good<00:00:17.550> credit<00:00:17.789> to<00:00:18.060> Oceania<00:00:18.779> and<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:19.109> woman's

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
good credit to Oceania and the woman's

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.439 
good credit to Oceania and the woman's
development<00:00:20.400> program<00:00:20.789> throughout<00:00:21.270> the

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
development program throughout the

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.679 
development program throughout the
islands<00:00:21.840> both<00:00:22.800> PNG<00:00:23.310> and<00:00:23.340> Tonga<00:00:23.850> were<00:00:24.090> a<00:00:24.119> lot

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
islands both PNG and Tonga were a lot

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.380 
islands both PNG and Tonga were a lot
more<00:00:25.160> structurally<00:00:26.160> organized<00:00:26.609> and<00:00:27.000> I<00:00:27.210> think

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
more structurally organized and I think

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.120 
more structurally organized and I think
technically<00:00:28.080> better<00:00:28.439> than<00:00:28.710> they<00:00:28.800> have<00:00:29.010> been

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
technically better than they have been

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.560 
technically better than they have been
in<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.279> past<00:00:29.369> so<00:00:29.789> they<00:00:29.910> did<00:00:30.090> provide<00:00:30.330> us<00:00:30.510> with

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
in the past so they did provide us with

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.139 
in the past so they did provide us with
a<00:00:30.720> lot<00:00:30.840> of<00:00:30.990> challenges<00:00:31.529> yeah<00:00:32.460> we<00:00:32.669> were<00:00:32.850> going

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
a lot of challenges yeah we were going

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.350 
a lot of challenges yeah we were going
into<00:00:33.329> expecting<00:00:33.989> there<00:00:34.200> it<00:00:35.190> would<00:00:35.460> be<00:00:35.730> like

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
into expecting there it would be like

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.639 
into expecting there it would be like
not<00:00:36.630> as<00:00:36.719> hard<00:00:36.930> as<00:00:37.020> playing<00:00:37.290> other<00:00:37.440> teams

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
not as hard as playing other teams

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.440 
not as hard as playing other teams
overseas<00:00:38.100> but<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.610> island<00:00:38.910> teams<00:00:39.090> are<00:00:39.210> always

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
overseas but the island teams are always

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.420 
overseas but the island teams are always
quite<00:00:39.660> physical<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.469> so<00:00:41.040> after<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.399> first

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
quite physical and so after the first

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.729 
quite physical and so after the first
game<00:00:41.850> we<00:00:42.059> sort<00:00:42.300> of<00:00:42.390> swore<00:00:42.690> that<00:00:43.050> they<00:00:43.500> would

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
game we sort of swore that they would

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.410 
game we sort of swore that they would
come<00:00:43.890> out<00:00:44.040> stronger<00:00:44.340> this<00:00:44.579> year<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:45.090> so<00:00:45.300> we

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
come out stronger this year and so we

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.479 
come out stronger this year and so we
were<00:00:45.539> quite<00:00:45.750> surprised<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.890> kiss<00:00:47.100> after<00:00:47.280> that

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
were quite surprised a kiss after that

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.819 
were quite surprised a kiss after that
first<00:00:47.700> game<00:00:47.879> but<00:00:48.120> we<00:00:48.930> just<00:00:49.170> keep<00:00:49.410> doing<00:00:49.710> that

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
first game but we just keep doing that

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.000 
first game but we just keep doing that
like<00:00:50.219> I<00:00:50.579> guess<00:00:50.969> I<00:00:51.350> sort<00:00:52.350> of<00:00:52.379> came<00:00:52.739> as<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:52.920> shock

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
like I guess I sort of came as a shock

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.110 
like I guess I sort of came as a shock
but<00:00:53.600> we<00:00:54.600> keep<00:00:54.780> going<00:00:54.930> we'll<00:00:55.260> just<00:00:55.440> speak<00:00:56.120> you
