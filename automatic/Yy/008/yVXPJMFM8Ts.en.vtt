 elite gaming today on destiny for 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.620
 regarding the end of carrot 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.420
 available with the latest dlc the 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.769
 left the darkness from the deep 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.690
 I'm going to start this series 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.280
 of videos dedicated to how to complete 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.839
 raid raid as you like 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.580
 call it today we're going to see 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.650
 how to overcome the labyrinth of the 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.320
 Basic lanterns should arrive by 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.240
 practice from the beginning where it exposes where 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.800
 then there is the end of this maze 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.480
 where the bridge will be present 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.769
 will lead to the next air 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.019
 and throughout this path yes 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.730
 will accumulate weight stacks 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.590
 of darkness and poor words do not exist 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.329
 will allow you to jump you will be more 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.370
 lenses of your movements and if 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.230
 up to 10 the only way they will join 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.510
 take them off is to stop by 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.890
 stop near these lanterns that you 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.600
 will activate when you approach 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.489
 when a member of your team does 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.559
 will approach and which will exclude after approx 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.270
 10 15 seconds I honestly don't know the 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.820
 exact duration of these lanterns therefore 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.230
 you are born as you will put a foot 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.149
 off the platform they will start ad 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.399
 accumulate you have to reach the 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.050
 first lantern as a team wait 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.280
 that stacks get lighter than you 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.710
 you can move freely again 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.270
 then run to the second and so on up 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.950
 to the sixteenth actor lantern present 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.600
 this platform that will serve ad 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.340
 activate times but we get there calmly 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.750
 also I want to remind you that in 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.010
 this labyrinth is also present 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.479
 first cash in the raid 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.130
 if you are interested in knowing how 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.689
 get it click here in the image 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.610
 video you will be taken to the dedicated video 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.590
 exactly how to find this box 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.970
 returning to talk about the raid and instead the 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.000
 biggest difficulty in this part 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.340
 of the raid is in the low light that 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.180
 it is an easily solved problem 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.009
 increasing screen brightness 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.329
 in the setting the texts put them at 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.310
 maximum is good or bad you will succeed in 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.750
 see and indeed that is precisely this 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.430
 also managed to avoid all 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.950
 obstacles all along the way 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.630
 there are small or large holes 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.820
 that they will make you fall and die 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.079
 increasing the brightness you should be 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.060
 able to see them enough 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.200
 easily but you will have to stay the same 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.240
 very careful because some are 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.340
 hidden behind low behind a curve 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.079
 so when you run eyes open to no 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.490
 fall into the second big one 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.170
 danger instead is given by the great 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.060
 amount of enemies that will be there both 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.619
 slaves the explosive slaves that you don't 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.750
 I remember how some are called 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.219
 knights and finally an ogre all that 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.750
 what you'll have to do is move around like 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.670
 team kill all the enemies there 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.050
 they will come closer 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.550
 thus making it arrive as a solid 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.230
 group at the end of the videos anyway 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.840
 I will try to put the whole path 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.310
 to travel speeded up maybe not 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.900
 end I will leave without washing 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.459
 simply to show you the video 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.989
 said I don't know yet anyway I want 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:22.610
 show all the way exactly 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:24.380
 to travel so you won't have to 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.209
 waste time looking for it once 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.050
 arrived at the last lantern what 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:29.270
 represents this platform 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.650
 exactly as it was present at the beginning 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.840
 to activate the bridge he was making me 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.400
 throw everyone into the abyss well 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.080
 in there activated by start a 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.910
 make a bridge at this point 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.160
 the infinite data of the cats will arrive 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.440
 orcs, knights, some other slaves 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.569
 acolyte, well, all you have to do 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.890
 will be or be able to defend the six as 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:47.390
 we did we lost some 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.799
 man but it is not a problem because to the 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.180
 end once power passed but 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:51.980
 also the later part all those 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.810
 deaths will be reborn and will make you 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.190
 company exactly where you will be there at 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.600
 new there then they will also have you not 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.940
 too then the important thing that at least 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.440
 one survives or put yourself on 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.970
 pebbles nearby so doing that 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.230
 Libyan knight slaves who have 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.000
 melee attacks will not 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.709
 killing you the only problem could 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.150
 be the orcs but if you had a titan 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:09.709
 with the bubble you are safe even from 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.870
 the one once the bridge will be 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:13.609
 fully formed and the great 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.410
 door behind you will be open 

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:17.420
 lecce rete the writing the way is clear 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.250
 something like that and lower left 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.930
 you will have to cross the bridge throw yourself over 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.489
 towards the light you will be teleported 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.380
 to the next area where he will give you the 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:26.359
 too many first and you will have to venture with 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.100
 the second part of the raid was this 

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:29.750
