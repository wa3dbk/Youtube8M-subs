much more radiation than the atmosphere

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.590 
much more radiation than the atmosphere
this<00:03:00.770> means<00:03:01.100> that<00:03:01.310> the<00:03:01.460> Sun<00:03:01.730> heats<00:03:02.060> the<00:03:02.180> ground

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
this means that the Sun heats the ground

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.400 
this means that the Sun heats the ground
and<00:03:02.870> the<00:03:03.290> ground<00:03:03.500> heats<00:03:03.860> the<00:03:04.040> atmosphere<00:03:05.410> not

all parts of the earth are warmed

equally regions around the equator

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:11.920 
equally regions around the equator

receive more concentrated solar

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.220 
receive more concentrated solar
radiation<00:03:12.530> then<00:03:12.980> do<00:03:13.130> areas<00:03:13.490> around<00:03:13.640> the<00:03:13.910> poles

radiation then do areas around the poles

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.140 
radiation then do areas around the poles
the<00:03:15.230> result<00:03:15.620> is<00:03:15.740> that<00:03:15.770> the<00:03:15.980> equator<00:03:16.430> is<00:03:16.640> warmer

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
the result is that the equator is warmer

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.440 
the result is that the equator is warmer
than<00:03:17.300> the<00:03:17.420> poles<00:03:18.940> temperature<00:03:19.940> differences

than the poles temperature differences
also<00:03:20.870> result<00:03:21.260> because<00:03:21.620> land<00:03:21.980> and<00:03:22.250> water<00:03:22.550> do

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
also result because land and water do

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.470 
also result because land and water do
not<00:03:22.970> absorb<00:03:23.270> solar<00:03:23.600> radiation<00:03:24.140> equally

not absorb solar radiation equally

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.020 
not absorb solar radiation equally
because<00:03:26.480> air<00:03:26.960> moves<00:03:27.290> warm<00:03:28.190> air<00:03:28.400> and<00:03:28.580> cold<00:03:28.640> air
