00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:04.950
 only everyone is a maintenance of 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.020
 production and today we end up 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.150
 for a new video where I will 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.400
 This custom of methane so we'll 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.019
 consider that by a clone of the 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.049
 grid company so here you are 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:19.410
 can see that he is green so he has some 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:22.529
 arm towards is also a green crest 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.920
 so I'm going to approach him so here's the 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.960
 cre is very well done what we know that 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:32.250
 arms and so that's it 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:34.770
 and he also has a beachhead of everything 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:41.129
 what is more normal like you 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:42.559
 can see it so here at the on the 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:47.129
 helmet 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:53.390
 it's self-adhesive paper 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:53.390
 then we have a club of the 501st legion 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:59.430
 so here it is a plot beyond rex in 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.840
 fact also is from Terex in 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.299
 below that I had echo but some 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:08.820
 little traits that he had so here 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:13.439
 so the helmet one so the base we're going 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:15.659
 to say the low base of the custom then after 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.540
 Ben finally here enough to finance the 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:26.220
 Customize helmet since the torso 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:30.030
 stay the same so here he has a head 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:36.930
 of all that she also except that he has some 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:40.020
 beard reads then we have the commander 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:45.390

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:49.350

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:53.689
 normal clown 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:56.719
