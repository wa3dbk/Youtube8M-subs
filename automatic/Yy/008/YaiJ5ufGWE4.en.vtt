 but the world could aggregate because it creates the expenses 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.660
 anyone who has kinect invited to participate in groups a little more 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.310
 crowded although I doubt that this connection was born to download 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.179
 the application can hold a similar amount of data

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.840
 we went to beyond we have passed the peaks of the imaginary towards places 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.370
 unknown those distance may seem the blue planet but beware 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.860

 what is the most remote fantasy you have ever had 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.780
 I always wanted to cross a river with a rubber chicken with the 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.249
 pulley in the middle 

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:12.999
 the problem is that this always rigorously crazy crowd flakes everything out if 

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:17.540

 falling asleep and speed that will reverse the direction of travel allows 

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:32.859
 constant amount of space until gradually the pulley in the middle 

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:34.769
 station was on half of the tour 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:38.430
 the extremity of the halved parliamentary chicken remained attached time 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.249
 that remains for me to live savoring putting the port up to detach myself from the 

00:02:42.249 --> 00:02:43.479
 pulley in the middle 

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:46.849

 I would really like to know who has hired this technician 

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:14.780
 an idea of ​​the precise indications and he does not understand where to put his hands 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.590

 first of all, the tg1 finally of bulletins is applied to the whole board 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.439
 of war always tried to download responsibilities of the games 

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:07.699
 in an attempt to justify criminal action by obscuring the apps 

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:09.009
 burning truths 

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:13.029
 he always looked for a quick scapegoat that was everyone's reach 

00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:16.740
 the fruits struck the ignorance of the dazed mass of the goats of 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.270
 bazaar journalists 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:23.410

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:31.250
 unaware of the pd 18 superimposed on the cover 

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:36.110
 and if on the one hand America protected the video game the first amendment in 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:41.440
 Italy always against the tide began a period of closure 50 if freedom 

00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:42.469

 the case of norway the madman who exterminated 90 and passes the tg1 

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:51.589
 once again to praise the guilt and the game as a means 

00:05:51.589 --> 00:05:53.740
 among the madness is the criminal gesture 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:56.930
 waiting for the real truths about the extremist inclination 20 

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:01.810
 the people have always been influenced by the words of these news programs as always 

00:06:01.809 --> 00:06:04.090
 game identifiers like evil 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:09.010
 and what players like traveling terrorists but I refuse to resist 

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:13.699
 media blasphemy and misuse of terms has prompted these 

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:15.549
 last create associations 

00:06:15.549 --> 00:06:19.849
 movements against misinformation designed to guarantee the real digita of the work 

00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:21.039
 whole multimedia 

00:06:21.039 --> 00:06:24.460
 finally after years we kept our space 

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:28.550
 of the videogame on everyone's lips synonymous with the work by which 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:31.550
 youtube - can regain emotion forever 

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:41.009
 and here we are when the first appointment is the urban landscape but not the city 

00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:45.490
 any we are in the locality of portapalazzo with a view towards the future 

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:50.449
 food shopping malls no fish market in the room 

00:06:50.449 --> 00:06:55.120
 stagnates an idea of ​​revolution born from the brilliant idea of ​​the architect fuksas e 

00:06:55.120 --> 00:07:00.020
 than in the twenty-first century. the one I know 'palace on the north west side 

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:04.669
 but let's start from the origins of the door to the Palazzo Pitti delivered by the abuse 

00:07:04.669 --> 00:07:06.649
 possessive from before Neapolitans 

00:07:06.649 --> 00:07:11.419
 veneto we reach you with Moroccan Chinese chicken today portapalazzo comes 

00:07:11.419 --> 00:07:15.499
 delivered in the hands of Turin's proud of their market 

00:07:15.499 --> 00:07:21.139
 a cognition has not changed the time the prejudice of the people is not the 

00:07:21.139 --> 00:07:25.539
 non-EU presence to tarnish the name of the palace door but the voices of 

00:07:25.539 --> 00:07:28.289
 those who do not live have lived this reality 

00:07:28.289 --> 00:07:32.560
 reminds me of the guide of paimio on a school trip which he declared a palace door 

00:07:32.559 --> 00:07:34.809
 common infamous arzana dangerous 

00:07:34.809 --> 00:07:38.859
 if center of couple exchanges if people went wrong I am sure that 

00:07:38.859 --> 00:07:43.069
 these characteristics also exist in other parts but perhaps it is not made 

00:07:43.069 --> 00:07:48.099
 account which trade vicar women outgrow games around you 

00:07:48.099 --> 00:07:52.270
 moves in the most remote possibility of visiting a squalid place as a door 

00:07:52.269 --> 00:07:55.749
 palace remember that I grew up in this post 

00:07:57.909 --> 00:07:59.699
 try turning on the lights 

00:07:59.699 --> 00:08:03.840
