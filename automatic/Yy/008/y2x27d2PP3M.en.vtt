00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 this is another 3 knife today from 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:09.389
 kershaw companies 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:12.450
 this modelka is called compound 1940 of 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.440
 let's say it no way even more 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.990
 inexpensive option 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.289
 turbine knife which is made in the us they 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.630
 very similar about the same 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.779
 looks like there is a slight difference in 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.510
 blades well then here we have a system 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:31.590
 knitting needle 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:33.750
 flipper liner we klitschko let's open 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.559
 and see open the same knife 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.079
 kershaw 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.530
 I really am in his hands 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.090
 twist very like this knife to the touch 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.410
 so let's open neatly 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:48.120
 and do not like that he 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:50.489
 pretty well sharpened and I donâ€™t know 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.879
 to someone he can be reminded of a shoemaker 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:01:05.840
 knife 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:01:05.840
 Well, I like this little knife so much 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:16.860
 you cut quite a good shape 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.119
 cut or quite passive power 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.670
 cafe for 1 pass 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:25.700
 Well, in general, let's see what we 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:31.170
 we have here we have such a knife 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:34.770
 so big enough for me 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:37.500
 standard but rather large blade 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:42.590
 again if I remember correctly called 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:45.420
 raven cliff means here I wonder what 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:49.950
 now if we look even take another 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:52.409
 knife kershaw yes then processing with us 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.320
 and here and there in the same way it kolenochki 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.780
 sand blasting but the liners are such 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.719
 see rude traces of processing and somehow 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.680
 here it is so brilliant here 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:06.630
 really very matte 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:09.210
 sandblasting is such an interesting 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:12.180
 klyaksochka cute and she 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:14.790
 rearranges again without side need 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:18.240
 very, very much this clip like these 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:21.540
 here's how on kershaw zing is also very 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:28.890
 a nice knife 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:33.990
 g10 probably 10 but it is not the same as 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:35.190
 me we have a pit bike pin about here please 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.330
 forgiveness will have to stop again 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.770
 let's continue the dimensions are almost identical 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:44.220
 my last discovery 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.990
 this kershaw sleeps bank grip 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.790
 only bring a little bit 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:51.330
 shorter than five millimeters 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:55.110
 but on the waters of the handle especially on the back 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:59.280
 the parts are very similar these knives 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.360
 Do you see something like this ? 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.340
 look like these knives 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.459
 the only thing here is not here 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.500
 notches on it and sharp enough 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:10.500
 tip what if of course you push 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:13.890
 pressed very boss cheerfully shot 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:16.080
 just the smartest here with this knife 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.660
 same as you and this knife feeling 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.440
 that kershaw began to put the spring 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.400
 more powerful 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:27.510
 but again, I just think so nose 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:32.310
 made in china there is enough 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:35.070
 so three screws plus 4 axial very 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:38.989
 nice blade shape and she too 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:41.910
 after all, allows you to cut on the plane 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:45.709
 that's what's due to this bend due to 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:48.450
 bend handle in relation to the knee 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:51.480
 In general, an interesting such a knife too 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:54.959
 also quite inexpensive here is very similar to 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:58.320
 turbines with a spoke too 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:04:00.260
 nice clip. but nevertheless here 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:04.709
 so for me, as if I'm talking here 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:07.620
 the discovery was this knife here kirsch to me 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:09.750
 Recently, more pleased than even 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.330
 cold steel although its recently mesh 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.380
 again, Iâ€™ll just say to me 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:21.010
 turned out to be here is the problem on 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:23.320
 speak bampi means here it turns out at me 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:27.690
 I would notice that I clip for a couple of days 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:31.780
 got loose and dangles then left to right 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:33.910
 when I started to watch everything 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.350
 I tried to twist the screw and turned 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:37.300
 what's inside some almost 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:40.090
 aluminum bushings in which the thread 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.470
 it simply by elos I effortlessly about 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.900
 began to twist and they spin 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.880
 scroll but in general now 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.400
 I have a primary task 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:51.250
 replace new bolts and replace those 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.710
 sleeves for the rest or at least 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:57.220
 I will try the bolts tomorrow 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:05:00.670
 taps to pick up or all the same something 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:02.530
 another will have to do here is why 

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:06.430
 such here we started to give today I 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:08.650
 I do not know, let's censor and compare 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:11.980
 This of course immediately say not enduro enduro 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:15.340
 More than that, it weighs about 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:20.220
 as much well in general by the knees 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:24.070
 something like this but enduro on 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:27.580
 on a little bit on the floor a centimeter line but 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:29.350
 about 3-4 more times 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:34.210
 millimeter eaten here about here 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:37.870
 wedges that's why but really wear 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:40.630
 seems strong enough elastic to hand 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:42.220
 That's how I kept a great shave 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:45.790
 I think it is also great here and so 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:47.590
 There are no problems with a pony, but when 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:49.350
 you add up is not very 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:53.110
 comfortable and that 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:55.870
 when pressed feeling but i think that 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:56.830
 if this case will be a little undermined 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:59.320
 generally wonderful 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:00.900
 so let me remind you that it was kershaw 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:03.460
 compound 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:06.240
 good kershaw knife so everyone 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:06.240
 thanks, bye
