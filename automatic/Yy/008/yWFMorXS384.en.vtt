00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
about you know maybe what the right and

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:27.619 
about you know maybe what the right and
wrong<00:02:23.310> of<00:02:23.550> it<00:02:23.670> is<00:02:23.879> as<00:02:24.239> far<00:02:24.810> as<00:02:26.000> we're<00:02:27.000> Americans

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:27.629

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.490 
and this is how we should treat each
other<00:02:29.040> I<00:02:29.310> think<00:02:29.730> that's<00:02:30.060> fine<00:02:30.269> but<00:02:31.019> but<00:02:31.379> the

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
other I think that's fine but but the

other I think that's fine but but the
how-to<00:02:31.739> stuff<00:02:32.340> I<00:02:32.879> think<00:02:33.840> I<00:02:33.900> would<00:02:34.050> have

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
how-to stuff I think I would have

how-to stuff I think I would have
charged<00:02:34.440> admission<00:02:34.620> for<00:02:35.040> that<00:02:35.160> do<00:02:35.340> a<00:02:35.370> couple
