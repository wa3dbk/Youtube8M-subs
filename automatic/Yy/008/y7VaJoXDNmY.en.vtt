okay<00:00:07.960> the<00:00:08.170> system<00:00:08.620> to<00:00:08.890> operate<00:00:08.920> the<00:00:09.370> system<00:00:09.900> is

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:10.900 
okay the system to operate the system is

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.070 
okay the system to operate the system is
very<00:00:11.170> simple<00:00:11.559> you<00:00:12.490> know<00:00:12.639> basically<00:00:13.570> you<00:00:13.719> hook

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:14.080 
very simple you know basically you hook

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.169 
very simple you know basically you hook
up<00:00:14.290> your<00:00:14.320> water

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
up your water

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.760 
up your water
hoes<00:00:15.680> and<00:00:16.680> as<00:00:17.220> you<00:00:17.369> can<00:00:17.520> see<00:00:17.580> we<00:00:18.000> have<00:00:18.180> a<00:00:18.210> big

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:18.770 
hoes and as you can see we have a big

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.380 
hoes and as you can see we have a big
heavy-duty<00:00:19.770> strainer<00:00:20.340> on<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.820> inlet<00:00:21.150> hose

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
heavy-duty strainer on the inlet hose

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.019 
heavy-duty strainer on the inlet hose
this<00:00:22.110> will<00:00:22.259> take<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.529> seat<00:00:22.949> seaweed<00:00:23.880> and

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
this will take the seat seaweed and

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.609 
this will take the seat seaweed and
sticks<00:00:24.390> and<00:00:24.599> that<00:00:24.720> sort<00:00:24.960> of<00:00:25.020> thing<00:00:25.259> out<00:00:25.410> of<00:00:25.439> the

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
sticks and that sort of thing out of the

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.859 
sticks and that sort of thing out of the
water<00:00:25.800> and<00:00:26.160> then<00:00:26.789> we<00:00:26.910> also<00:00:27.090> have<00:00:27.419> a<00:00:27.450> finer

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
water and then we also have a finer

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.800 
water and then we also have a finer
strainer<00:00:28.349> and<00:00:28.650> this<00:00:29.189> lives<00:00:29.490> close<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.300> box

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
strainer and this lives close to the box

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.900 
strainer and this lives close to the box
so<00:00:31.259> that<00:00:31.289> it's<00:00:31.650> easy<00:00:31.890> to<00:00:32.070> service<00:00:32.550> and

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
so that it's easy to service and

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.340 
so that it's easy to service and
maintain<00:00:33.530> just<00:00:34.530> simply<00:00:36.860> if<00:00:37.860> you<00:00:37.920> remove<00:00:38.460> your

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 
maintain just simply if you remove your

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.439 
maintain just simply if you remove your
protective<00:00:40.350> caps<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:40.980> this<00:00:41.670> simply<00:00:42.120> snaps

00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:42.449 
protective caps and this simply snaps

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:44.930 
protective caps and this simply snaps
into<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.900> front<00:00:43.110> of<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.230> box<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:43.890> then<00:00:44.760> we

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
into the front of the box and then we

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.030 
into the front of the box and then we
have<00:00:45.150> what<00:00:45.329> we<00:00:45.449> call<00:00:45.629> a<00:00:45.690> brine<00:00:46.050> discharge<00:00:46.739> hose

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:47.040 
have what we call a brine discharge hose

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.979 
have what we call a brine discharge hose
this<00:00:47.339> is<00:00:47.549> the<00:00:47.699> excess<00:00:48.059> water<00:00:48.330> that<00:00:48.479> goes<00:00:48.750> back

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
this is the excess water that goes back

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.170 
this is the excess water that goes back
to<00:00:49.199> the<00:00:49.320> source<00:00:49.619> and<00:00:49.979> we're<00:00:50.699> going<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:50.850> snap

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
to the source and we're going to snap

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.609 
to the source and we're going to snap
that<00:00:51.830> on<00:00:52.830> to<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.489> other<00:00:53.699> fitting<00:00:54.290> and<00:00:55.290> then<00:00:55.440> we

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:55.619 
that on to the other fitting and then we

00:00:55.619 --> 00:01:00.200 
that on to the other fitting and then we
have<00:00:55.799> a<00:00:55.830> product<00:00:56.339> tube<00:00:57.150> and<00:00:58.129> that<00:00:59.129> just<00:00:59.519> simply

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
have a product tube and that just simply

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.969 
have a product tube and that just simply
threads<00:01:00.570> on<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.080> front<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.439> the<00:01:01.500> box<00:01:01.739> as

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:01.979 
threads on to the front of the box as

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:04.910 
threads on to the front of the box as
well<00:01:02.600> that's<00:01:03.600> where<00:01:03.839> your<00:01:03.989> fresh<00:01:04.229> water<00:01:04.260> comes

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
well that's where your fresh water comes

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.640 
well that's where your fresh water comes
out<00:01:05.540> as<00:01:06.540> you<00:01:06.810> can<00:01:06.960> see<00:01:07.110> in<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.290> front<00:01:07.439> of<00:01:07.590> the
