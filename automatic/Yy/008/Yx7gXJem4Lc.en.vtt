plane<00:05:27.259> too<00:05:27.679> so<00:05:27.979> he<00:05:28.129> he<00:05:28.639> has<00:05:28.729> two<00:05:28.909> modes<00:05:29.119> right

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:29.989 
plane too so he he has two modes right

00:05:29.989 --> 00:05:31.209 
plane too so he he has two modes right
there<00:05:30.259> that's<00:05:30.409> what<00:05:30.589> he<00:05:30.709> would<00:05:30.889> look<00:05:31.039> like

00:05:31.209 --> 00:05:31.219 
there that's what he would look like

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:32.379 
there that's what he would look like
with<00:05:31.399> wings<00:05:31.639> that's<00:05:31.939> what<00:05:32.089> he<00:05:32.179> would<00:05:32.299> look

00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:32.389 
with wings that's what he would look
