00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:17.520

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:20.490

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.470
 family member who offsets them and 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.430

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:55.829
 first of all I 'll apply the alley 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.809
 in which a great shoot for practicality 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.370
 because it is multifunctional it is very 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.590
 products in just one 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.570
 so instead of taking your 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.489
 you need multiple products you only take 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.560
 the vehicle in which it solves 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.439
 and this is the beak in da l'orÃ©al that I 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:14.600
 simply because they love leave 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.600
 perfect coverage without regret 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:27.350
 now I will apply the corrective this law 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.310

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:35.619
 they give way 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:35.619
 the first was that in the case it is the average color 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:55.679
 and now I'm going to apply the compact 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.450
 throughout the course including the 

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:59.810
 eyes that will facilitate at the time 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.810
 it's gone 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:09.020
 good came to my eyes in my 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.840
 bag I only found a quartet when the 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.310
 sigils and a brush or 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.480
 I'll have to do some magic with these 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.020
 three products 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:21.230
 the quartet is avon's cappuccino and he 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:23.360
 It has many neutral colors that I love. 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.320
 So how stupid are you going to be very useful? 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.850
 I'll wear light brown and dark 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:31.300
 mixed to draw mine 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.300
 eyebrow 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:41.360
 now I'll get a uzi lighter and 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:44.750
 I'll mark the corner of my eyes. 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:47.240
 external and the car with that brush 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:51.020
 even I know it was not a smoking function 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:53.770
 nothing is just a synthetic anymore was the 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.770
 what was on for today? 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:07.600
 and now I'm going to study with fingers yes 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:10.240
 this marcon gives of supercerto people 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.430
 especially if you used old 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.070
 of dusting the eyelid 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.950
 so there's no excuse not to disappear 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:20.770
 that shadow over there now I'm 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.950
 darker brown shadow in the corner 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:22.950
 external 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:35.209
 Are you smoking with your finger? 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:49.090
 now with that dark brown shadow and 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:51.930
 I'll go over the lower eyelashes 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:54.790
 I love doing this in any small 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:59.260
 Okay now I'll take this shade. 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:01.920
 shimmering pink and I'll apply it on 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.920
 mobile eyelid 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:18.620
 and finally the lighter shadow for 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:18.620
 illuminate the inner client of the eyes 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:30.090
 and now to get it all it's just 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:33.130
 We get quite enough even us 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:35.560
 lots of eyelash mascara 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:38.140
 I love this mask on the eyelashes. 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.630
 which houses the impact it really 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:43.890

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.890

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:51.939
 now it would be ideal to apply two more 

00:04:50.109 --> 00:04:53.409
 How did my bag have people? 

00:04:51.939 --> 00:04:56.289
