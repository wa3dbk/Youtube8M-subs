00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:32.240
 substances released or let 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.070
 We are a hazardous substances consultant 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.540
 site that has been that too 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.100
 has measured and it just has grains 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.130
 until the property can be released 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.130
 to become 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.990
 tikibad is fast-paced 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:47.720
 evacuated and countable about 900 to 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.399
 1000 guests accommodated in us 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.740
 restaurant laplace 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:53.659
 and now the guests are in groups 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.390
 back to get their swimwear 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:58.399
 because many of those guests were too 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.470
 holiday gases produced here in our garden 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:03.530
 believe or with their own tent or caravan 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.119
 here at the Duinrell holiday park 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.009
 and then of course also 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:11.269
 day guests because the tikibad is already too up 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:12.950
 open 10 o'clock that night is one 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:15.680
 short circuit on the outside 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:18.769
 LED lights are created and how they are created 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:21.530
 is that will naturally will be sorted out 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:24.739
 but it is a fact that because of that 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:27.950
 a fire has started and polyester 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:30.290
 burnt in that slide is about one 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.250
 meter or two three we have on that 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.280
 moment 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:37.550
 completely on fire we were 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.510
 actually equipped with violence 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.860
 you were about to 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.200
 to slide down 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.820
 then we knew it was serious to them 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.830
 which is actually our happiness afterwards 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.540
 has been that we are the first out 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.709
 and our belongings were green suits me 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.480
 because that now stands rest is all 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:52.130
 without car keys under all in it 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.780
 bikini in that cold and they have it 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.780
 really nothing came 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:01.160
 I saw that many people were leaving and 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:04.330
 sirens so I thought this could be wrong 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.330
 so I immediately left
