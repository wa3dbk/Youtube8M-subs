on the back of the bag so let's get in
there<00:00:52.850> did<00:00:53.850> you<00:00:53.879> get<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.120> good<00:00:54.270> look<00:00:54.449> at<00:00:54.570> that

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
there did you get a good look at that

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.959 
there did you get a good look at that
salt<00:00:55.110> cluster<00:00:55.739> I<00:00:55.920> don't<00:00:56.760> know<00:00:56.820> it<00:00:56.940> just

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
salt cluster I don't know it just

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.229 
salt cluster I don't know it just
doesn't<00:00:57.420> have<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:58.430> just<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.579> look<00:00:59.760> to<00:00:59.940> it

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
doesn't have a just the look to it

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.490 
doesn't have a just the look to it
looks<00:01:00.809> lumpy<00:01:01.170> I<00:01:02.629> would<00:01:03.629> think<00:01:03.750> that<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:04.379> it

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
looks lumpy I would think that and it

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.560 
looks lumpy I would think that and it
says<00:01:04.650> right<00:01:04.830> there<00:01:04.860> chips<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.610> large<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.330> show

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
says right there chips and large to show

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.140 
says right there chips and large to show
texture<00:01:07.200> I<00:01:07.530> think<00:01:08.040> I'd<00:01:08.130> be<00:01:08.250> neat<00:01:08.430> if<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.729> salt

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
texture I think I'd be neat if the salt

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.140 
texture I think I'd be neat if the salt
was<00:01:09.330> just<00:01:09.570> dropping<00:01:09.990> down<00:01:10.439> and<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:11.790> vinegar

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
was just dropping down and the vinegar

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.440 
was just dropping down and the vinegar
was<00:01:12.330> in<00:01:12.479> something<00:01:12.900> a<00:01:12.990> little<00:01:13.020> fancier<00:01:14.450> maybe

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
was in something a little fancier maybe

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.539 
was in something a little fancier maybe
with<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.659> splash<00:01:16.290> of<00:01:16.619> water<00:01:16.860> from<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.520> ocean

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
with a splash of water from the ocean

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.679 
with a splash of water from the ocean
you<00:01:18.119> know<00:01:18.270> sea<00:01:19.170> salt<00:01:20.030> now<00:01:21.030> it<00:01:21.090> doesn't<00:01:21.270> say<00:01:21.450> sea

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
you know sea salt now it doesn't say sea

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.480 
you know sea salt now it doesn't say sea
salt<00:01:22.020> so<00:01:22.259> maybe<00:01:22.470> that's<00:01:22.710> why<00:01:22.979> they<00:01:23.159> didn't<00:01:23.400> do

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
salt so maybe that's why they didn't do

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.179 
salt so maybe that's why they didn't do
that<00:01:23.640> huh<00:01:24.060> so<00:01:24.840> just<00:01:25.049> a<00:01:25.170> plain<00:01:25.470> looking<00:01:25.860> chip

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
that huh so just a plain looking chip

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.399 
that huh so just a plain looking chip
and<00:01:26.430> if<00:01:27.390> you<00:01:27.479> know<00:01:27.600> lays<00:01:27.810> they've<00:01:28.110> got<00:01:28.229> a<00:01:28.259> nice

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
and if you know lays they've got a nice

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:37.109 
and if you know lays they've got a nice
little<00:01:28.590> crisp<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.340> them

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:40.679 

and<00:01:38.109> it's<00:01:38.289> good<00:01:38.530> I<00:01:38.770> mean<00:01:39.009> I<00:01:39.520> like<00:01:40.030> salt<00:01:40.390> chips

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:40.689

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:45.609 
and vinegar chips but I'm not going to

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:50.270 
and vinegar chips but I'm not going to
gravitate<00:01:45.880> to<00:01:46.390> them<00:01:46.479> as<00:01:46.659> my<00:01:47.069> first<00:01:48.069> choice

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280
