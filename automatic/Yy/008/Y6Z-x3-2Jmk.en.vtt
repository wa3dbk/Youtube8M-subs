00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:11.309
 the youtube staff rodrigues technician 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.530
 It was to bring more people to you today 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.480
 will have a test camera that the galaxy 12 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.670
 the first show the layout after I 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.779
 and all the functions 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.580
 she may have 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.100
 in fact all is not because in beauty 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.779
 road of the panorama all this is for sure 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.490
 would make a video of ten minute cameras 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.330
 and an idea is to show the quality of 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.189
 images 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.009
 the video quality of both the front and 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.480
 a rear is video image of them two 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.250
 because it is what most folks is based 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.000
 but I'll show you the layout of the 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.790
 camera 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.510
 basically how tidy you're put 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.300
 here it comes 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.920
 so we have on the left side there we 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.649
 we have the gear that shows all the 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.440
 settings which is what the camera has 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.129
 there to offer in the case the size of the photo 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:56.670
 with the rear here you can put 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:01:00.030
 2516 by 1932 than 5 megapixels 4 per 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:03.210
 three and three dots 9h pixels 2060 with 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.220
 1,015 36 5 by 3 to 1 as it is 4 by 3 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:10.080
 the galley of the lips 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:12.869
 the photo is stay this way then the 3.9 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.869
 megapixels is the best indication there for 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:19.140
 photos you use any way you want 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.939
 we have 3 173 points 12.05 will we 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.909
 we have here iso is that there is something that you 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:26.400
 you must configure your form also 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.070
 measuring mode a matrix point between the 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.040
 powerful can lose a powerful being 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:35.220
 face that gave center measurement mode 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.570
 weighted matrix is okay and actually point 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.439
 I do not have much knowledge about 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.450
 camera pardoned and if I fatal touch for 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.960
 take pictures or can not be touched 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:49.890
 hd video size certainty and 24 years of 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:52.140
 pesd 40 tá hdmi vga to watch and 16 per 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.329
 new in hd and four by 34 for three 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.189
 so hd is always going to be better in both 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.680
 Quality and size is okay. 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.290
 we're calling video showed mode 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:05.759
 normal recording output ms effect is 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.869
 we have for the purposes here sindsep 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.440
 negative 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:13.200
 let's go back here it 's flash off or 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.900

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.019
 10 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.840
 seconds here you have the active flash no 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:22.269
 Automatically activates the front and 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.930
 show that's something I'm ugly 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:25.689
 ramesh 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.540

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:31.510
 there is also the front here we have 2 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:34.060

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.879

 you can pause the video save and take photo 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.060
 so you have these settings and and 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.989
 we have other configurations between 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.909
