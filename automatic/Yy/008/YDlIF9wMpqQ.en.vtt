basically means that you have to
sacrifice<00:01:09.750> at<00:01:10.200> least<00:01:10.380> two<00:01:10.710> or<00:01:10.860> more<00:01:10.890> monsters

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
that's I kind of think that that kind of

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.300 
that's I kind of think that that kind of
concept<00:01:19.140> of<00:01:19.259> summon<00:01:19.530> summoning<00:01:20.009> is<00:01:20.100> kind<00:01:20.280> of

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
concept of summon summoning is kind of

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.289 
concept of summon summoning is kind of
interesting<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:20.729> adds<00:01:20.909> a<00:01:21.000> little<00:01:21.090> bit<00:01:21.210> more

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
interesting and adds a little bit more

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.149 
interesting and adds a little bit more

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
of your turn the problem with that is

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.450 
of your turn the problem with that is
that<00:01:51.270> well<00:01:51.930> it's<00:01:52.290> not<00:01:52.470> there<00:01:52.710> to<00:01:52.890> do<00:01:53.130> anything

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
that well it's not there to do anything

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.429 
that well it's not there to do anything
basically<00:01:53.659> so<00:01:54.659> you<00:01:54.689> better<00:01:55.020> hope<00:01:55.200> you're

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
basically so you better hope you're

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.069 
basically so you better hope you're
going<00:01:55.710> to<00:01:55.860> get<00:01:56.790> rid<00:01:56.909> of<00:01:57.000> it<00:01:57.149> for<00:01:57.329> one<00:01:57.360> turn<00:01:57.750> to

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079

okay<00:02:13.650> my<00:02:13.800> final<00:02:14.100> thoughts<00:02:14.340> on<00:02:14.610> started

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
okay my final thoughts on started

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.870 
okay my final thoughts on started
striking<00:02:15.270> well<00:02:15.720> it's<00:02:15.990> not<00:02:16.800> horrible<00:02:17.100> but<00:02:17.670> it's

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
striking well it's not horrible but it's

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.670 
striking well it's not horrible but it's
not<00:02:18.030> exactly<00:02:18.210> one<00:02:18.600> of<00:02:18.630> the<00:02:18.720> best<00:02:19.050> cards<00:02:19.350> either

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
not exactly one of the best cards either

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.980 
not exactly one of the best cards either
but<00:02:20.550> it<00:02:20.640> still<00:02:20.880> might<00:02:21.180> be<00:02:21.330> worth<00:02:21.510> having<00:02:21.540> in

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
but it still might be worth having in

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.210 
but it still might be worth having in
the<00:02:22.050> deck<00:02:22.230> so<00:02:22.500> if<00:02:22.560> you<00:02:22.680> want<00:02:22.860> to<00:02:22.950> incorporate

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
close to some start a struggle because

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.750 
close to some start a struggle because
well<00:03:24.690> it's<00:03:25.050> a<00:03:25.110> double-edged<00:03:25.470> sword<00:03:25.500> yeah<00:03:26.460> when

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
well it's a double-edged sword yeah when

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.190 
well it's a double-edged sword yeah when
it<00:03:26.850> destroys<00:03:27.240> the<00:03:27.330> defensive<00:03:27.720> position<00:03:28.020> once

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
it destroys the defensive position once

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.540 
it destroys the defensive position once
they're<00:03:28.350> all<00:03:28.500> your<00:03:28.710> opponent's<00:03:29.100> monsters<00:03:29.160> in

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
they're all your opponent's monsters in

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.340 
they're all your opponent's monsters in
defense<00:03:29.580> position<00:03:30.330> are<00:03:30.420> destroyed<00:03:30.720> the

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
defense position are destroyed the

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.010 
defense position are destroyed the
downside<00:03:31.980> is<00:03:32.220> that<00:03:32.250> well<00:03:32.850> it<00:03:33.450> destroys<00:03:33.780> every

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:34.020 
downside is that well it destroys every

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:35.060 
downside is that well it destroys every
other<00:03:34.140> monster<00:03:34.500> on<00:03:34.530> your<00:03:34.620> side<00:03:34.710> of<00:03:34.890> the<00:03:34.980> field

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
other monster on your side of the field

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.190 
other monster on your side of the field
that<00:03:35.250> didn't<00:03:35.430> attack<00:03:35.660> but<00:03:36.660> it<00:03:36.750> makes<00:03:36.900> up<00:03:37.050> for

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
that didn't attack but it makes up for

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.110 
that didn't attack but it makes up for
that<00:03:37.230> with<00:03:37.350> a<00:03:37.530> 3,000<00:03:38.280> attack<00:03:38.490> points<00:03:38.550> but<00:03:39.060> that

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
that with a 3,000 attack points but that

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.670 
that with a 3,000 attack points but that
doesn't<00:03:39.570> matter<00:03:39.660> because<00:03:39.930> if<00:03:40.350> it's<00:03:40.500> the<00:03:40.590> only

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
doesn't matter because if it's the only

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:41.950 
doesn't matter because if it's the only
thing<00:03:40.830> out<00:03:41.010> on<00:03:41.160> your<00:03:41.280> field<00:03:41.520> and<00:03:41.760> your

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:41.960 
thing out on your field and your

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.450 
thing out on your field and your
opponent<00:03:42.960> destroys<00:03:43.380> you<00:03:43.500> with<00:03:43.650> a<00:03:43.680> spell<00:03:44.220> trap

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:44.460 
opponent destroys you with a spell trap

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:46.010 
opponent destroys you with a spell trap
or<00:03:44.550> monster<00:03:44.700> effect<00:03:45.090> then<00:03:45.630> you're<00:03:45.840> pretty

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:46.020 
or monster effect then you're pretty

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.550 
or monster effect then you're pretty
much<00:03:46.230> screwed<00:03:46.410> on<00:03:46.740> that<00:03:46.890> well<00:03:48.320> my<00:03:49.320> final

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
much screwed on that well my final

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.060 
much screwed on that well my final
thoughts<00:03:49.980> on<00:03:50.190> red<00:03:50.460> dragon<00:03:50.880> archfiend<00:03:51.300> well

thoughts on red dragon archfiend well
it's<00:03:53.070> not<00:03:53.280> horrible<00:03:54.270> but<00:03:54.330> it<00:03:54.750> could<00:03:54.990> have<00:03:55.080> been

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
it's not horrible but it could have been

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.190 
it's not horrible but it could have been
better<00:03:55.350> for<00:03:55.770> the<00:03:55.950> card<00:03:56.190> that<00:03:56.370> it<00:03:56.490> is<00:03:57.020> but<00:03:58.020> if

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
better for the card that it is but if

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.620 
better for the card that it is but if
you<00:03:58.260> want<00:03:58.350> to<00:03:58.620> use<00:03:58.740> this<00:03:58.920> in<00:03:59.100> your<00:03:59.130> deck<00:03:59.630> you

you want to use this in your deck you
can<00:04:00.660> use<00:04:00.930> it<00:04:01.050> if<00:04:01.140> you<00:04:01.260> want

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800
