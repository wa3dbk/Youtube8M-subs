00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
to go from level 11 to 16 pretty curious

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:50.950 
to go from level 11 to 16 pretty curious
actually<00:01:48.820> this<00:01:49.820> is<00:01:49.970> not<00:01:50.119> including<00:01:50.630> ring<00:01:50.780> so

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
actually this is not including ring so

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.570 
actually this is not including ring so
guys<00:01:51.140> remember<00:01:51.530> rings<00:01:51.740> are<00:01:51.950> the<00:01:52.100> most<00:01:52.250> pricey
