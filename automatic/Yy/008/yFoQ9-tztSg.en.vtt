00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.960
 energizing bronze boat moisturizers 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.960
 plate 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:41.160
 the cloud computing project was born 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.100
 root of the equipment support topic 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:47.490
 assets have to be given a lot 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.800
 daily support for resolution 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.630
 problems that need time to 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.400
 use the time in other work in 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.790
 other projects to improve 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:02:00.140
 infrastructure in to think about new 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.140
 possibilities for the company 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:06.520
 everything started because in Colombia I was going to 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.619
 start operations with a plant in 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.990
 canyon only to enter 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:14.950
 new staff in a new structure 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:16.840
 this I did not want to implement a new 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.569
 way of life 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.549
 cloud computing 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:23.680
 for the users so they prepare that 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:25.269
 they say in their jobs to do 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.700
 the requirements for them to work 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:32.310
 in applications for the subject of 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.310
 control and administrative of this plant 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:39.510
 we reviewed several cloud providers 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:43.920
 computing which we turned in a 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:45.450
 cost a cost benefit and reviewing the 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.200
 points in favor of each company 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.970
 as gm to a support more suited to the 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.430
 needs the needs that I had 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.190
 of my applications of success users 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.930
 what a way 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:00.180
 they also told me that all the compu 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.300
 it was compatible with the cloud that they 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.540
 they were driving 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:08.990
 also the cost benefit is very good 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.940
 it was fast and on the subject of accesses the 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:13.530
 subject of the services included within 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.959
 from the same cloud 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.530
 it seems to us a better option and there 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.530
 we made the decision 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.129
 we started with the orientation of 20 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.459
 desks in the cloud at the plant 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:38.849
 Barranquilla where users enter 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:41.810
 to office office tools 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:44.129
 2013 that are installed in the cloud 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.709
 additional our applications are 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:48.870
 Access through the service 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.909
 described in the cloud to a terminal server 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.349
 which is directly connected to 

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:54.269
 our databases where the 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:56.489
 suÃ¡rez users enter your system 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:58.889
 its management system 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:02.129
 accounting to your order system and 

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:04.560
 commercial and then they work normal too 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:06.420
 he makes his impressions we have a service 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.850
 of 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:12.250
 of print collage where the 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:14.950
 user sends his impression arrives at 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:17.019
 print server on how and from there 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.209
 are redirected locally to the 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:21.489
 printer that have the site where 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:24.630
 they print everything they need and there's 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:24.630
 communication problems 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:34.250
 when the systems assistant 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:36.650
 Railing calls me informs me that I do not know 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.700
 dedicate to support simply doing 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:41.830
 the revisions 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:45.190
 very basic channel network 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:47.920
 permissions on the application no more 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:50.970
 about problems on the machines 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:54.370
 machines do not present problems for me 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:57.730
 I have problems inside the desk in 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:05:00.700
 the cloud and everything then work normal not 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:03.520
 is devoting more than all the control to 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:06.900
 take an administration of the equipment 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.900
 of computation that we have the before 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:15.830
 very well easy a call we have a 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:19.080
 cell phone number or even direct 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:21.120
 by email we have to do 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:25.020
 a change of password in a user change 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:26.840
 pass information when they do the when 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.790
 they do the 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:31.669
 move from one platform to another that 

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:34.280
 we had what we had in this project was 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:37.070
 in the night from one day to the next 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:39.020
 have the greatest traumas a 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:41.030
 change a password an access 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.770
 additional a connection to a new 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:45.759
 printer 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:45.759
 take minutes
