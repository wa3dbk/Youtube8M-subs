I've<00:00:21.119> learned<00:00:21.150> along<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:21.779> way

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:31.739 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:34.740 

okay<00:00:32.739> what<00:00:32.920> do<00:00:32.980> we<00:00:33.010> have<00:00:33.070> freshly<00:00:34.000> cut<00:00:34.420> green

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:43.329 
the material the more often you'll have

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:46.910 
the material the more often you'll have
to<00:00:43.540> clean<00:00:43.870> the<00:00:44.379> chute<00:00:44.680> to<00:00:44.710> prevent<00:00:45.190> jams

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920

pointing out the obvious gloves and eye

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.540 
pointing out the obvious gloves and eye
protection<00:00:49.420> the<00:00:50.350> chipper<00:00:50.620> is<00:00:50.800> not<00:00:51.010> that<00:00:51.280> loud

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.550 
protection the chipper is not that loud

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.549 
protection the chipper is not that loud
but<00:00:51.909> when<00:00:52.059> you<00:00:52.180> reach<00:00:52.420> down<00:00:52.750> your<00:00:52.780> ear<00:00:53.290> goes

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:53.559 
but when you reach down your ear goes

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:55.410 
but when you reach down your ear goes
right<00:00:53.890> into<00:00:54.100> the<00:00:54.309> hoppers<00:00:54.760> so<00:00:54.940> I<00:00:55.000> guess<00:00:55.239> I'll

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420 
right into the hoppers so I guess I'll

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.750 
right into the hoppers so I guess I'll
start<00:00:55.540> wearing<00:00:55.989> your<00:00:56.019> protection<00:00:56.739> also<00:00:57.519> I

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
start wearing your protection also I

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.430 
start wearing your protection also I
keep<00:00:57.940> a<00:00:58.089> stick<00:00:58.390> to<00:00:58.570> push<00:00:58.809> in<00:00:58.989> clear<00:00:59.260> material

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
keep a stick to push in clear material

00:00:59.440 --> 00:02:30.790 
keep a stick to push in clear material
so<00:01:00.040> and<00:01:00.489> here<00:01:00.699> we<00:01:00.850> go

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.440 

the<00:02:31.800> machine<00:02:32.130> I<00:02:32.340> keep<00:02:32.550> it<00:02:32.700> in<00:02:32.760> the<00:02:32.819> garage<00:02:33.090> it's

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
the machine I keep it in the garage it's

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.390 
the machine I keep it in the garage it's
easy<00:02:33.720> to<00:02:33.900> move<00:02:34.140> it's<00:02:34.410> on<00:02:34.560> wheels<00:02:34.830> weighs<00:02:35.220> about

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
easy to move it's on wheels weighs about

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.820 
easy to move it's on wheels weighs about
80<00:02:35.760> pounds<00:02:35.970> it's<00:02:36.840> sealed<00:02:37.200> so<00:02:37.380> you<00:02:37.470> don't<00:02:37.650> have

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
80 pounds it's sealed so you don't have

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.650 
80 pounds it's sealed so you don't have
to<00:02:37.980> oil<00:02:38.010> it<00:02:38.250> just<00:02:38.490> plug<00:02:38.730> it<00:02:38.850> in<00:02:39.030> there's<00:02:39.450> the
