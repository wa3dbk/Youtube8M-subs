every<00:01:04.920> single<00:01:05.220> time<00:01:05.400> so<00:01:05.610> it's<00:01:05.760> awesome

every single time so it's awesome

because<00:01:06.390> in<00:01:07.170> my<00:01:07.290> eyes<00:01:07.500> I<00:01:07.680> kind<00:01:07.860> of<00:01:07.920> look<00:01:08.040> at<00:01:08.070> it

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
because in my eyes I kind of look at it

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.219 
because in my eyes I kind of look at it
like<00:01:08.280> this<00:01:08.549> like<00:01:09.030> just<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.570> sentry<00:01:09.960> gun<00:01:10.020> is

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
like this like just the sentry gun is

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.230 
like this like just the sentry gun is
like<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.530> normal<00:01:10.950> variant<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:12.060> then<00:01:12.150> you

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
like the normal variant and then you

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.490 
like the normal variant and then you
could<00:01:12.360> put<00:01:12.570> things<00:01:12.720> on<00:01:12.960> it<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.170> make<00:01:13.260> it<00:01:13.320> like<00:01:13.470> a

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
could put things on it to make it like a

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.560 
could put things on it to make it like a
professional<00:01:14.130> or<00:01:14.220> elite<00:01:14.460> variant<00:01:14.909> stuff<00:01:15.360> like

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
professional or elite variant stuff like

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.050 
professional or elite variant stuff like
that<00:01:15.780> makes<00:01:16.439> it<00:01:16.590> pretty<00:01:16.740> cool<00:01:17.009> so<00:01:17.369> like<00:01:17.850> I<00:01:18.000> said

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
that makes it pretty cool so like I said

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.060 
that makes it pretty cool so like I said
you<00:01:18.240> put<00:01:18.540> on<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.750> sentry<00:01:19.170> gun<00:01:19.200> kill<00:01:19.619> streak<00:01:19.920> in

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
you put on the sentry gun kill streak in

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.130 
you put on the sentry gun kill streak in
order<00:01:20.250> to<00:01:20.400> get<00:01:20.520> this<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:20.880> then<00:01:21.330> you<00:01:21.659> press<00:01:21.900> Y

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
order to get this and then you press Y

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.770 
order to get this and then you press Y
over<00:01:22.560> it<00:01:22.650> or<00:01:23.030> triangle<00:01:24.030> or<00:01:24.119> whatever<00:01:24.360> console

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
over it or triangle or whatever console

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.300 
over it or triangle or whatever console
you're<00:01:24.900> playing<00:01:25.110> on<00:01:25.229> so<00:01:25.890> where<00:01:26.009> you<00:01:26.070> can<00:01:26.130> put

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
you're playing on so where you can put

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.890 
you're playing on so where you can put
attachments<00:01:27.000> on<00:01:27.119> it<00:01:27.270> and<00:01:27.420> then<00:01:27.509> you<00:01:27.630> put<00:01:27.869> on

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
attachments on it and then you put on

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.440 
attachments on it and then you put on
the<00:01:28.229> rippable<00:01:28.850> attachments<00:01:29.850> now<00:01:30.000> rippable

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
the rippable attachments now rippable

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.179 
the rippable attachments now rippable
doesn't<00:01:30.900> really<00:01:31.020> make<00:01:31.229> sense<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.650> me<00:01:31.860> like<00:01:32.040> the

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
doesn't really make sense to me like the

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.800 
doesn't really make sense to me like the
name<00:01:32.400> at<00:01:32.610> first<00:01:32.640> I<00:01:33.030> just<00:01:33.210> kind<00:01:33.390> of<00:01:33.420> looked<00:01:33.659> at

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
name at first I just kind of looked at

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.630 
name at first I just kind of looked at
it<00:01:33.990> like<00:01:34.380> that's<00:01:34.500> probably<00:01:34.740> some<00:01:35.159> bullshit

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
it like that's probably some bullshit

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.010 
it like that's probably some bullshit
thing<00:01:35.850> that<00:01:36.000> I<00:01:36.030> don't<00:01:36.150> really<00:01:36.270> want<00:01:36.689> to<00:01:36.780> use

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
thing that I don't really want to use

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.380 
thing that I don't really want to use
and<00:01:37.229> it's<00:01:37.320> probably<00:01:37.619> useless<00:01:38.070> so<00:01:39.060> I<00:01:39.090> kind<00:01:39.329> of

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
and it's probably useless so I kind of

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.969 
and it's probably useless so I kind of
ignored<00:01:39.540> that<00:01:39.869> but<00:01:40.020> I<00:01:40.049> decided<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.650> read<00:01:40.829> the

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
ignored that but I decided to read the

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.319 
ignored that but I decided to read the
description<00:01:41.490> and<00:01:41.820> I<00:01:41.909> thought<00:01:42.060> it<00:01:42.210> sounded

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
description and I thought it sounded

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.539 
description and I thought it sounded
pretty<00:01:42.600> awesome<00:01:42.960> so<00:01:43.079> I<00:01:43.110> threw<00:01:43.470> it<00:01:43.560> on<00:01:43.680> as<00:01:43.950> well

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
pretty awesome so I threw it on as well

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.149 
pretty awesome so I threw it on as well
as<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.939> laser<00:01:45.210> energy<00:01:45.960> beam<00:01:46.259> or<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.680> laser

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
as the laser energy beam or the laser

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.859 
as the laser energy beam or the laser
directed-energy<00:01:47.970> or<00:01:48.299> whatever<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.659> fuck

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
directed-energy or whatever the fuck

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.200 
directed-energy or whatever the fuck
that<00:01:49.170> thing<00:01:49.439> is<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.250> I<00:01:50.340> decided<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:50.850> throw<00:01:51.030> it

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
that thing is and I decided to throw it

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.020 
that thing is and I decided to throw it
on<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:51.509> I<00:01:51.600> ran<00:01:51.810> around<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.860> gun<00:01:53.220> was<00:01:53.759> a

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
on and I ran around and the gun was a

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.289 
on and I ran around and the gun was a
freaking<00:01:55.040> tank<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.460> thing<00:01:56.700> literally<00:01:57.000> just

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
freaking tank the thing literally just

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.690 
freaking tank the thing literally just
melted<00:01:57.719> everyone<00:01:58.229> it<00:01:58.590> was<00:01:58.740> like<00:01:58.920> an<00:01:59.070> e/m<00:01:59.430> one

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
melted everyone it was like an e/m one

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.850 
melted everyone it was like an e/m one
the<00:01:59.880> one<00:02:00.060> laser<00:02:00.299> light<00:02:00.689> machine<00:02:01.079> gun<00:02:01.259> but

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
the one laser light machine gun but

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.780 
the one laser light machine gun but
times<00:02:02.399> 10<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.479> thing<00:02:03.719> kills<00:02:03.990> in<00:02:04.259> literally

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
times 10 the thing kills in literally

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.459 
times 10 the thing kills in literally
almost<00:02:05.790> instantly<00:02:06.329> it<00:02:06.509> pretty<00:02:06.899> much<00:02:07.079> has<00:02:07.140> the

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
almost instantly it pretty much has the

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.619 
almost instantly it pretty much has the
damage<00:02:07.890> of<00:02:08.099> like<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.759> Lynx<00:02:09.149> or<00:02:09.270> any<00:02:09.420> other

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
damage of like the Lynx or any other

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.780 
damage of like the Lynx or any other
sniper<00:02:09.989> rifle<00:02:10.319> kills<00:02:10.560> so<00:02:10.739> fast<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.520> one

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
sniper rifle kills so fast the one

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.460 
sniper rifle kills so fast the one
downside<00:02:12.569> to<00:02:12.629> it

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
downside to it

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.280 
downside to it
is<00:02:13.530> it<00:02:13.740> doesn't<00:02:14.220> last<00:02:14.460> forever<00:02:15.110> you<00:02:16.110> don't

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
is it doesn't last forever you don't

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.660 
is it doesn't last forever you don't
really<00:02:16.410> get<00:02:16.590> that<00:02:16.650> many<00:02:16.950> bullets<00:02:17.310> with<00:02:17.460> it<00:02:17.580> you

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
really get that many bullets with it you

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.610 
really get that many bullets with it you
only<00:02:17.820> have<00:02:18.000> enough<00:02:18.180> like<00:02:18.630> ammunition<00:02:19.410> to<00:02:19.500> get

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
only have enough like ammunition to get

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.620 
only have enough like ammunition to get
there<00:02:19.830> like<00:02:19.950> five<00:02:20.250> or<00:02:20.430> six<00:02:20.460> kills<00:02:20.940> and<00:02:21.480> then

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
there like five or six kills and then

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:22.790 
there like five or six kills and then
you<00:02:21.690> have<00:02:21.810> to<00:02:21.900> get<00:02:22.020> another<00:02:22.260> one<00:02:22.410> so<00:02:22.530> that<00:02:22.650> is<00:02:22.770> a

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
you have to get another one so that is a

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.590 
you have to get another one so that is a
huge<00:02:22.950> vomiter<00:02:23.400> but<00:02:23.520> it<00:02:23.610> definitely<00:02:23.790> is<00:02:24.180> a<00:02:24.210> fun

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
huge vomiter but it definitely is a fun

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.870 
huge vomiter but it definitely is a fun
five<00:02:24.870> to<00:02:25.050> six<00:02:25.290> kills<00:02:25.590> just<00:02:26.460> to<00:02:26.580> run<00:02:26.760> around

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
five to six kills just to run around

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.360 
five to six kills just to run around
let's<00:02:27.240> get<00:02:27.360> a<00:02:27.390> bunch<00:02:27.570> of<00:02:27.660> kills<00:02:27.900> with<00:02:28.190> and<00:02:29.190> just

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
let's get a bunch of kills with and just

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.980 
let's get a bunch of kills with and just
have<00:02:29.520> a<00:02:29.550> lot<00:02:29.790> of<00:02:29.940> fun<00:02:30.120> with<00:02:30.270> so<00:02:30.420> it<00:02:30.510> is<00:02:30.600> awesome

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
have a lot of fun with so it is awesome

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.930 
have a lot of fun with so it is awesome
is<00:02:31.110> pretty<00:02:31.320> much<00:02:31.470> like<00:02:31.590> a<00:02:31.650> hidden<00:02:32.010> gun<00:02:32.250> but<00:02:32.820> not

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
is pretty much like a hidden gun but not

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.160 
is pretty much like a hidden gun but not
only<00:02:33.120> can<00:02:33.450> you<00:02:33.570> put<00:02:33.720> on<00:02:33.810> the<00:02:33.960> laser

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
only can you put on the laser

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.280 
only can you put on the laser
directed-energy<00:02:34.860> you<00:02:35.370> can<00:02:35.520> also<00:02:35.640> put<00:02:35.910> on<00:02:35.940> a

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
directed-energy you can also put on a

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.410 
directed-energy you can also put on a
freaking<00:02:37.290> rocket<00:02:38.250> launcher<00:02:38.730> and<00:02:38.910> now<00:02:39.000> most<00:02:39.270> of

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
freaking rocket launcher and now most of

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.120 
freaking rocket launcher and now most of
the<00:02:39.510> rocket<00:02:39.900> launches<00:02:40.230> in<00:02:40.380> this<00:02:40.530> game<00:02:40.770> don't

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
the rocket launches in this game don't

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.670 
the rocket launches in this game don't
really<00:02:41.430> do<00:02:41.700> too<00:02:41.730> much<00:02:42.090> like<00:02:42.720> if<00:02:42.990> you<00:02:43.140> just<00:02:43.320> hit

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
really do too much like if you just hit

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.100 
really do too much like if you just hit
them<00:02:43.800> in<00:02:43.950> or<00:02:44.160> hit<00:02:44.370> a<00:02:44.400> by<00:02:44.670> their<00:02:44.940> feet<00:02:45.240> you<00:02:45.990> know

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
them in or hit a by their feet you know

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.780 
them in or hit a by their feet you know
in<00:02:46.230> like<00:02:46.380> five<00:02:46.709> yards<00:02:47.160> away<00:02:47.250> from<00:02:47.400> them<00:02:47.640> it's

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
in like five yards away from them it's

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.130 
in like five yards away from them it's
not<00:02:47.940> gonna<00:02:48.180> kill<00:02:48.450> him<00:02:48.600> you'll<00:02:48.690> just<00:02:48.959> get<00:02:49.080> a

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
not gonna kill him you'll just get a

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.510 
not gonna kill him you'll just get a
hitmarker<00:02:49.470> they're<00:02:50.100> really<00:02:50.340> not<00:02:50.459> that

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
hitmarker they're really not that

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.100 
hitmarker they're really not that
overpowered<00:02:51.240> in<00:02:51.360> this<00:02:51.510> game<00:02:51.720> things<00:02:51.959> like

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
overpowered in this game things like

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.830 
overpowered in this game things like
that<00:02:52.290> mayhem<00:02:52.520> or<00:02:53.520> the<00:02:53.640> Stinger<00:02:54.060> type<00:02:54.360> missile

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
that mayhem or the Stinger type missile

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.590 
that mayhem or the Stinger type missile
whatever<00:02:55.110> one<00:02:55.560> that<00:02:55.770> is<00:02:55.950> but<00:02:56.760> this<00:02:57.030> freaking

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
whatever one that is but this freaking

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.660 
whatever one that is but this freaking
one<00:02:57.750> when<00:02:57.930> you<00:02:57.990> put<00:02:58.170> the<00:02:58.290> Rockets<00:02:58.740> on<00:02:58.890> it<00:02:59.040> just

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
one when you put the Rockets on it just

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.270 
one when you put the Rockets on it just
destroys<00:03:00.660> just<00:03:01.080> demolishes<00:03:01.740> the<00:03:01.890> enemies

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
destroys just demolishes the enemies

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.790 
destroys just demolishes the enemies
definitely<00:03:03.209> put<00:03:03.450> that<00:03:03.480> on<00:03:03.870> it<00:03:04.020> is<00:03:04.110> so<00:03:04.410> much<00:03:04.560> fun

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
definitely put that on it is so much fun

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.310 
definitely put that on it is so much fun
to<00:03:04.950> use<00:03:05.100> I<00:03:05.280> do<00:03:05.340> think<00:03:05.790> the<00:03:05.940> laser<00:03:06.180> is<00:03:06.540> a<00:03:06.840> little

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
to use I do think the laser is a little

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.510 
to use I do think the laser is a little
bit<00:03:07.410> better<00:03:07.620> if<00:03:07.830> you<00:03:07.920> are<00:03:08.040> trying<00:03:08.340> to<00:03:08.430> get

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
bit better if you are trying to get

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.460 
bit better if you are trying to get
kills<00:03:08.880> and<00:03:09.090> go<00:03:09.180> on<00:03:09.300> kill<00:03:09.570> streaks<00:03:09.840> but<00:03:10.320> the

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
kills and go on kill streaks but the

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.530 
kills and go on kill streaks but the
Rockets<00:03:11.010> definitely<00:03:11.610> are<00:03:11.730> a<00:03:11.760> lot<00:03:12.030> of<00:03:12.060> fun<00:03:12.360> to

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
Rockets definitely are a lot of fun to

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.240 
Rockets definitely are a lot of fun to
use<00:03:12.720> if<00:03:12.870> you<00:03:12.959> want<00:03:13.020> to<00:03:13.200> take<00:03:13.350> out<00:03:13.530> kill<00:03:13.860> streaks

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
use if you want to take out kill streaks

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.880 
use if you want to take out kill streaks
or<00:03:15.120> just<00:03:15.330> basically<00:03:16.260> put<00:03:16.470> it<00:03:16.560> in<00:03:16.620> people's

giant<00:03:19.019> rockets<00:03:19.410> at<00:03:19.530> everybody<00:03:19.860> or<00:03:20.790> you<00:03:20.850> can

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
giant rockets at everybody or you can

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.060 
giant rockets at everybody or you can
just<00:03:21.300> not<00:03:21.480> put<00:03:21.720> anything<00:03:21.959> on<00:03:22.230> there<00:03:22.709> any

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
just not put anything on there any

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:24.440 
just not put anything on there any
attachments<00:03:23.730> on<00:03:23.820> it<00:03:23.910> and<00:03:24.000> just<00:03:24.090> leave<00:03:24.269> the

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
attachments on it and just leave the

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:24.920 
attachments on it and just leave the
rippable

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
rippable

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.870 
rippable
and<00:03:25.320> you<00:03:25.470> can<00:03:25.650> run<00:03:25.769> around<00:03:25.890> with<00:03:26.220> pretty<00:03:26.700> much

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
and you can run around with pretty much

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.370 
and you can run around with pretty much
another<00:03:27.180> light<00:03:27.390> machine<00:03:27.750> and<00:03:27.930> that's<00:03:27.989> not<00:03:28.200> too

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
another light machine and that's not too

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.560 
another light machine and that's not too
good<00:03:28.560> but<00:03:28.620> it<00:03:29.070> does<00:03:29.370> cost<00:03:29.700> less<00:03:30.030> points<00:03:30.450> to

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
good but it does cost less points to

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.030 
good but it does cost less points to
earn<00:03:30.600> since<00:03:31.110> you<00:03:31.230> know<00:03:31.320> obviously<00:03:31.680> putting<00:03:31.890> on

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
earn since you know obviously putting on

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.280 
earn since you know obviously putting on
the<00:03:32.130> laser<00:03:32.310> directed<00:03:32.820> energy<00:03:33.239> or<00:03:33.660> the<00:03:33.900> Rockets

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
the laser directed energy or the Rockets

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.470 
the laser directed energy or the Rockets
cost<00:03:34.530> like<00:03:34.680> an<00:03:34.800> extra<00:03:35.040> 150<00:03:35.850> points<00:03:36.150> but<00:03:36.330> that

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
cost like an extra 150 points but that

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.660 
cost like an extra 150 points but that
is<00:03:36.600> really<00:03:36.720> big<00:03:36.959> of<00:03:37.050> a<00:03:37.110> deal<00:03:37.590> but<00:03:37.890> this<00:03:38.250> gun<00:03:38.519> is

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
is really big of a deal but this gun is

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.240 
is really big of a deal but this gun is
honestly<00:03:39.150> so<00:03:39.480> much<00:03:39.510> fun<00:03:39.989> I<00:03:40.019> wish<00:03:40.410> I<00:03:40.650> wish<00:03:41.130> it

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
honestly so much fun I wish I wish it

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:42.770 
honestly so much fun I wish I wish it
was<00:03:41.400> a<00:03:41.430> gun<00:03:41.610> in<00:03:41.730> the<00:03:41.820> game<00:03:41.970> because<00:03:42.150> honestly

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
was a gun in the game because honestly

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.840 
was a gun in the game because honestly
if<00:03:42.959> you<00:03:43.170> had<00:03:43.410> more<00:03:43.739> ammunition<00:03:44.130> in<00:03:44.519> it<00:03:44.640> I<00:03:44.790> would

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
if you had more ammunition in it I would

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.699 
if you had more ammunition in it I would
easily<00:03:45.330> say<00:03:45.870> this<00:03:45.900> is<00:03:46.170> the<00:03:46.260> best<00:03:46.440> gun<00:03:46.620> an

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
easily say this is the best gun an

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.979 
easily say this is the best gun an
advanced<00:03:47.010> worker<00:03:47.420> destroys<00:03:48.420> everything

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
advanced worker destroys everything

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:52.610 
advanced worker destroys everything
kills<00:03:49.950> instantly<00:03:50.730> it<00:03:51.720> is<00:03:51.780> decent<00:03:52.380> mobility

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
kills instantly it is decent mobility

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.800 
kills instantly it is decent mobility
and<00:03:53.040> it<00:03:53.280> is<00:03:53.400> pretty<00:03:53.640> accurate<00:03:54.180> too<00:03:54.360> so<00:03:54.570> it<00:03:54.720> is

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
and it is pretty accurate too so it is

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.600 
and it is pretty accurate too so it is
amazing<00:03:55.350> definitely<00:03:55.530> try<00:03:56.010> this<00:03:56.070> out

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
amazing definitely try this out

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.520 
amazing definitely try this out
maybe<00:03:56.970> so<00:03:57.180> many<00:03:57.330> guys<00:03:57.480> can<00:03:57.660> get<00:03:57.870> DNA<00:03:58.140> bumps

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
maybe so many guys can get DNA bumps

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.199 
maybe so many guys can get DNA bumps
with<00:03:58.650> this<00:03:58.769> I<00:03:58.890> actually<00:03:59.070> don't<00:03:59.730> know<00:03:59.940> if<00:03:59.970> you

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
with this I actually don't know if you

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:02.150 
with this I actually don't know if you
can<00:04:00.420> acquire<00:04:00.930> kill<00:04:01.380> streaks<00:04:01.650> with<00:04:01.830> it<00:04:01.950> like

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
can acquire kill streaks with it like

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.699 
can acquire kill streaks with it like
the<00:04:02.310> DNA<00:04:02.580> bomb<00:04:02.989> since<00:04:03.989> it<00:04:04.170> is<00:04:04.290> a<00:04:04.320> kill<00:04:04.590> streak

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
the DNA bomb since it is a kill streak

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:07.070 
the DNA bomb since it is a kill streak
in<00:04:04.980> you<00:04:05.010> know<00:04:05.250> you<00:04:05.310> can't<00:04:05.640> really<00:04:05.959> like<00:04:06.959> you

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 
in you know you can't really like you

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.990 
in you know you can't really like you
can't<00:04:07.320> call<00:04:07.500> in<00:04:07.560> a<00:04:07.620> warbird<00:04:08.070> and<00:04:08.340> get<00:04:08.730> a<00:04:08.760> DNA

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
can't call in a warbird and get a DNA

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.820 
can't call in a warbird and get a DNA
bomb<00:04:09.360> from<00:04:09.600> 30<00:04:09.810> kills<00:04:10.080> in<00:04:10.200> the<00:04:10.230> warbird<00:04:10.470> so<00:04:10.799> I

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
bomb from 30 kills in the warbird so I

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:11.900 
bomb from 30 kills in the warbird so I
don't<00:04:11.010> know<00:04:11.070> why<00:04:11.220> it<00:04:11.280> would<00:04:11.459> be<00:04:11.489> able<00:04:11.700> to<00:04:11.760> use

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
don't know why it would be able to use

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.640 
don't know why it would be able to use
this<00:04:12.030> the<00:04:12.690> sense<00:04:12.959> you're<00:04:13.110> gonna<00:04:13.230> do<00:04:13.410> that<00:04:13.500> so<00:04:13.620> I

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
this the sense you're gonna do that so I

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:14.690 
this the sense you're gonna do that so I
don't<00:04:13.709> really<00:04:13.830> think<00:04:13.950> that's<00:04:14.100> possible<00:04:14.250> but

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
don't really think that's possible but

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.880 
don't really think that's possible but
this<00:04:14.790> is<00:04:14.910> definitely<00:04:15.090> an<00:04:15.540> awesome<00:04:16.109> class<00:04:16.680> I

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:16.890 
this is definitely an awesome class I

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.170 
this is definitely an awesome class I
definitely<00:04:17.190> like<00:04:17.280> you<00:04:17.340> guys<00:04:17.430> to<00:04:17.549> try<00:04:17.820> this<00:04:17.850> out

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
definitely like you guys to try this out

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.880 
definitely like you guys to try this out
it<00:04:18.299> is<00:04:18.390> almost<00:04:18.570> like<00:04:18.750> a<00:04:18.810> secret<00:04:19.290> weapon<00:04:19.410> in

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:19.890 
it is almost like a secret weapon in

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:21.710 
it is almost like a secret weapon in
advanced<00:04:20.220> warfare<00:04:20.430> some<00:04:21.150> that<00:04:21.359> you<00:04:21.419> kind<00:04:21.630> of

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
advanced warfare some that you kind of

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.330 
advanced warfare some that you kind of
have<00:04:21.810> to<00:04:21.900> play<00:04:22.020> the<00:04:22.229> game<00:04:22.380> a<00:04:22.410> lot<00:04:22.590> and<00:04:22.800> dig<00:04:23.099> a

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
have to play the game a lot and dig a

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.250 
have to play the game a lot and dig a
lot<00:04:23.820> to<00:04:24.090> find<00:04:24.330> that<00:04:24.450> out<00:04:24.570> so<00:04:24.690> hopefully<00:04:25.140> I<00:04:25.169> can

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
lot to find that out so hopefully I can

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.750 
lot to find that out so hopefully I can
see<00:04:25.560> more<00:04:25.710> people<00:04:25.860> running<00:04:26.250> around<00:04:26.370> with

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
see more people running around with

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.340 
see more people running around with
the<00:04:26.850> snow<00:04:27.030> because<00:04:27.510> it<00:04:27.660> is<00:04:27.750> a<00:04:27.780> lot<00:04:27.960> of<00:04:28.080> fun<00:04:28.230> and

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
the snow because it is a lot of fun and

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:29.690 
the snow because it is a lot of fun and
I<00:04:28.410> think<00:04:28.440> everyone<00:04:28.860> should<00:04:28.890> try<00:04:29.130> it<00:04:29.190> out<00:04:29.550> you

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700 
I think everyone should try it out you

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.190 
I think everyone should try it out you
know<00:04:29.790> whether<00:04:29.970> it's<00:04:30.150> the<00:04:30.300> laser<00:04:30.510> energy<00:04:30.690> or

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200 
know whether it's the laser energy or
