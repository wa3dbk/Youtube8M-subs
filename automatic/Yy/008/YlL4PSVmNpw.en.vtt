00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
a hundred percent real life KITT there's

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.820 
a hundred percent real life KITT there's
a<00:00:30.060> sentiment<00:00:30.630> in<00:00:30.810> a<00:00:31.019> frame<00:00:31.320> that<00:00:31.349> we're<00:00:31.679> knees

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
a sentiment in a frame that we're knees

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.190 
a sentiment in a frame that we're knees
from<00:00:31.980> that<00:00:32.219> so<00:00:32.520> it's<00:00:33.180> just<00:00:33.480> a<00:00:33.660> real<00:00:33.899> quick<00:00:33.930> one

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
from that so it's just a real quick one

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.510 
from that so it's just a real quick one
and<00:00:35.360> kind<00:00:36.360> of<00:00:36.510> creates<00:00:36.840> a<00:00:36.960> little<00:00:37.170> bit<00:00:37.350> of<00:00:37.530> a

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
and kind of creates a little bit of a

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.479 
and kind of creates a little bit of a
different<00:00:38.910> effect<00:00:40.160> so<00:00:41.160> we're<00:00:41.280> going<00:00:41.340> to<00:00:41.460> start

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
different effect so we're going to start

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.090 
different effect so we're going to start
with<00:00:41.879> grabbing<00:00:42.180> our<00:00:42.920> quarter<00:00:43.920> inch<00:00:46.100> wood

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100
