what is it you want from me because I'm
not<00:01:52.590> quite<00:01:52.890> sure<00:01:54.140> so<00:01:55.140> then<00:01:55.320> when<00:01:55.530> they<00:01:55.680> would

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
not quite sure so then when they would

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.709 
not quite sure so then when they would
come<00:01:56.100> back<00:01:56.340> and<00:01:56.820> if<00:01:57.000> they<00:01:57.180> were<00:01:57.240> pleasantly

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
come back and if they were pleasantly

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.120 
come back and if they were pleasantly
surprised<00:01:58.200> of<00:01:58.409> what<00:01:58.530> happened<00:01:58.950> with<00:01:59.070> the

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
surprised of what happened with the

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.570 
surprised of what happened with the
whole

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
whole

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.820 
whole
we<00:01:59.760> would<00:01:59.970> put<00:02:00.120> them<00:02:00.210> in<00:02:00.360> our<00:02:00.480> hackamore<00:02:01.170> and

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 
we would put them in our hackamore and

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.340 
we would put them in our hackamore and
we'd<00:02:02.370> get<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.820> horses<00:02:03.300> coming<00:02:03.780> into<00:02:04.170> the

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
we'd get the horses coming into the

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.910 
we'd get the horses coming into the
cradle<00:02:04.980> and<00:02:05.270> when<00:02:06.270> they<00:02:06.450> did<00:02:06.720> that<00:02:07.020> then<00:02:07.680> we

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
cradle and when they did that then we

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.100 
cradle and when they did that then we
would<00:02:08.040> go<00:02:08.220> ahead<00:02:08.340> and<00:02:08.520> get<00:02:08.729> them<00:02:08.850> later<00:02:09.050> now<00:02:10.050> we

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
would go ahead and get them later now we

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.380 
would go ahead and get them later now we
just<00:02:10.619> go<00:02:10.800> straight<00:02:11.100> to<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.400> combination<00:02:11.760> bit

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
just go straight to the combination bit

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.900 
just go straight to the combination bit
because<00:02:13.140> we're<00:02:13.530> still<00:02:13.800> asking<00:02:14.340> from<00:02:14.550> the<00:02:14.700> nose

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
because we're still asking from the nose

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.510 
because we're still asking from the nose
first<00:02:15.270> as<00:02:15.600> we<00:02:15.810> would<00:02:16.020> with<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:16.320> hackmore<00:02:16.530> but

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
first as we would with the hackmore but

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.450 
first as we would with the hackmore but
we<00:02:17.700> have<00:02:17.910> the<00:02:18.120> mouthpiece<00:02:18.360> as<00:02:18.900> a<00:02:18.930> backup<00:02:19.460> the

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
we have the mouthpiece as a backup the

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.180 
we have the mouthpiece as a backup the
other<00:02:20.700> thing<00:02:21.080> is<00:02:22.080> when<00:02:22.410> you<00:02:22.590> work<00:02:22.860> these

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
other thing is when you work these

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.310 
other thing is when you work these
horses<00:02:23.610> we<00:02:24.600> do<00:02:24.810> several<00:02:25.140> different

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
horses we do several different

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.760 
horses we do several different
mouthpieces<00:02:26.300> we<00:02:27.300> do<00:02:27.510> levelled<00:02:27.930> ones<00:02:28.230> level

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
mouthpieces we do levelled ones level

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.710 
mouthpieces we do levelled ones level
two<00:02:29.040> and<00:02:29.160> level<00:02:29.250> three<00:02:29.520> mouthpieces<00:02:30.330> in<00:02:30.630> the

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
two and level three mouthpieces in the

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.190 
two and level three mouthpieces in the
combination<00:02:31.400> so<00:02:32.400> not<00:02:32.700> one<00:02:33.030> bit<00:02:33.420> fits<00:02:33.780> every

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
combination so not one bit fits every

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.650 
combination so not one bit fits every
horse<00:02:34.440> you've<00:02:35.160> got<00:02:35.490> to<00:02:35.730> fit<00:02:35.940> the<00:02:36.090> mouthpiece

their horses they can get them through a
test<00:03:10.950> they<00:03:11.790> used<00:03:12.060> to<00:03:12.209> have<00:03:12.360> to<00:03:12.540> come<00:03:12.750> out<00:03:12.959> of

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
test they used to have to come out of

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.470 
test they used to have to come out of
the<00:03:13.230> test<00:03:13.470> go<00:03:13.769> back<00:03:14.010> into<00:03:14.340> an<00:03:14.580> illegal<00:03:14.970> bit<00:03:15.330> to

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
the test go back into an illegal bit to

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.170 
the test go back into an illegal bit to
keep<00:03:15.630> their<00:03:15.840> horses<00:03:16.140> relaxed<00:03:16.860> because<00:03:17.670> we

keep their horses relaxed because we

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.479 
keep their horses relaxed because we
train<00:03:18.660> on<00:03:18.900> a<00:03:18.930> horse<00:03:19.260> ninety<00:03:19.830> percent<00:03:20.040> of<00:03:20.370> the

we train on a horse and schooling ninety
percent<00:03:26.519> of<00:03:26.850> the<00:03:26.940> time<00:03:27.180> we<00:03:27.420> show<00:03:27.660> them<00:03:27.840> less

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
percent of the time we show them less

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.530 
percent of the time we show them less
than<00:03:28.080> ten<00:03:28.500> percent<00:03:28.920> of<00:03:29.040> the<00:03:29.100> time<00:03:29.340> so<00:03:29.640> we<00:03:30.269> want

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
than ten percent of the time so we want

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.840 
than ten percent of the time so we want
that<00:03:30.780> horses<00:03:31.290> relaxed<00:03:31.950> in<00:03:32.070> his<00:03:32.160> mind<00:03:32.489> as<00:03:32.700> we

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
that horses relaxed in his mind as we

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.210 
that horses relaxed in his mind as we
can<00:03:33.030> possibly<00:03:33.209> get<00:03:33.840> him<00:03:34.019> what<00:03:34.709> we're<00:03:34.890> trained

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
can possibly get him what we're trained

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.100 
can possibly get him what we're trained
anointing<00:03:35.760> and<00:03:35.940> that's<00:03:36.750> where<00:03:36.989> the

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
anointing and that's where the

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.290 
anointing and that's where the
combination<00:03:37.470> comes<00:03:38.100> into<00:03:38.489> play<00:03:38.700> for<00:03:38.730> a<00:03:39.030> lot<00:03:39.269> of

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
combination comes into play for a lot of

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.150 
combination comes into play for a lot of
