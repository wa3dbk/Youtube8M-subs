 Speak there , people are welcome more. 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.830
 a video of this time bringing here the 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.870
 gameplay of a link is a cold game yet 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.240
 had voted making the download available 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.880
 It's for you and I'll never put it on. 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.310
 never kamke with a camera showing 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.140
 my face because I forgot the headphone 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.250
 that I use to record that it has a 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.390
 microphone better 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.800
 I'm using this one that I not only 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.689
 to play I will not record almost from him 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.669
 because he has a really bad album 11 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.260
 He sucks so I'll get on 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.059
 I'll show you a little bit about the 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.450
 game then let's go 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:42.030
 Let me get it here for clothes. 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.510
 I already played I will not talk enough 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.219
 but the game is an amount 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.039
 illegal here already to talk a little about 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.320
 The game is but it 's a bit difficult to talk and 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.210
 play the same time at last in this game here 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.190
 It's personal, as I told you now. 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.100
 available for free to these only you 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.809
 download and have fun and I found this 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.899
 game that actually who showed me it 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.720
 It was the drag I 'm going to put on his channel. 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.220
 here in the inscription by why, after all, 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.860
 was my son when I met the game 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.869
 asked for a choice after all if 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.790
 If he did not know the game yet, right? 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.080
 then put the channel here in the 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.290
 description we will also bring 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.540
 some gameplay together here and the goal 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.700
 Gameplay here I want to hear from you. 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.680
 I say do not bring more gameplay from the game 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.900
 the channel is because I want to vary 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.479
 enough in games but the same way 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.400
 I do not want to leave fps. 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.890
 but let's try to deconcentrate myself 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.180
 I'm not very good at the game yet the staff 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.390
 I mean I already got some matches 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:42.740
 good but not always is not always this 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.659
 I do not know how to speak too little vowel 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.180
 This game here is something that I like. 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.909
 enough in him I even commented a lot 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:54.119
 with the contrary the impression it gives is that 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.430
 the guys used the hit my 3 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.530
 It 's a personal thing, it reminds me very well. 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.380
 and I believe in this Sunday game but the 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.550
 I do not know if it's the mark that stays on the 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.430
 in the head 12 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.940
 friends do not know but it reminds me 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.890
 very much the master seo has achieved 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:13.800
 recharge and still does not 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.990
 and it's something that I think the boy broke 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.360
 One thing I found cool here is the 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:27.450
 customization system every day you 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:29.610
 can mess gang get ready come 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.710
 I'll be very still here for me and 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:36.390
 not to be too boring but these by 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:40.140
 here the fight is one of the points 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:42.240
 that the button in one of the confreres 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.040
 I commented to the crack is precisely 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.960
 the personal grenade the grenade 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.310
 It seems like you're here. 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.350
 she does not want to go 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.120
 this is the impression I have when 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.610
 Throw a grenade at someone, huh? 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:57.060
 Come on, you do not start with guns. 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.920
 very good here but as it is, one thing is 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.800
 one thing I think I should have 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.690
 quite a lot of money game at stake 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.640
 is this thing to take away the weapon 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.739
 free of charge were not for 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.540
 certain time that neither you get the 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:12.390
 barÃ§a is gaining a day's weapon even though 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:15.660
 be it for the day is for example three days you 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:18.989
 or you have such to work on the swing 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:21.840
 Why play shooting game talk is a lot 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:23.459
 difficult and then it is something that motivates 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.600
 quite the thing to give them in 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:29.700
 natal areas 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:33.360
 So I thought it was cool in the game and 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:36.690
 this area here I won from one day only 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:39.959
 playing well for 8/3 well so do not 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:42.480
 the best map of the phrase but has come 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.560
 plenty of water also personal and I 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.630
 fact that it is a cold game has 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:50.760
 enough to sell even with a 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:54.390
 real money neowin dollar will not know 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:59.150
 change the way a little out of the sameness 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:59.150
 here to make a kick over there 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:08.680
 Good, I'll enjoy the call over here. 

00:04:05.969 --> 00:04:09.999
 has enough but has only one 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:15.909
 from what I saw there are three modalities 

00:04:09.999 --> 00:04:16.449
 they have are three modes that take 

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:20.739
 average 

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:22.180
 playing league and classes are also 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:25.090
 three modalities 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:28.930
 met eff / playing an conquest which is hereby 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:34.289
 for who ever played and w3 know it looks like 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:36.849
 enough the name nation to achieve 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:38.740
 conquer is very similar to me 

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:42.820
 let that steal flag thing 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:47.530
 only that despite the flag until the 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:51.370
 enormous amount of 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:54.460
 flags I do not think I played 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:56.560
 I had 16 flags to pick up a 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:05:11.880
 thing that is a point that I said that 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:11.880
 closely resembles the bf 31 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.030
 I do not want to make a video too much 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.530
 detailed personal I just want to show 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:20.349
 the game for you guys say something 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.849
 Basic to him and but he also gives to 

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:24.789
 you see third person third 

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:28.479
 person is mars style knows more 

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:30.340
 light or is it is that the person 

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:33.360
 You play both first-person and 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:38.550
 I 'm playing and third weight 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:38.550
 while granada canada well there my God 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:43.300
 I'm making history here then. 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:45.840
 making history here 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.840
 come on 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:50.020
 The phone ringing I think the camera 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:52.120
 catch 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:54.940
 I 'm very dumb I did a little 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:57.729
 I left and forgot my microphone. 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:59.169
 there then I hope you forgive me and 

00:05:57.729 --> 00:06:00.969
 You're going to have to take this my 

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:05.540
 ugly face in the days for a long time 

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:07.700
 Wow, the guys are 

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:09.500
 affront this map here by them is 

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:12.110
 small and does not change then the Spanish 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:12.500
 solve this guy that's where ours is there 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:14.660
 behind 

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:18.290
 so it does not change much, but when it has 

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:21.140
 a great one here in which the gigantic Pope 

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:22.550
 here that corresponds to the exchange is 

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:23.210
 making me look very ugly taking my 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:26.540
 God 

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:28.310
 and it's a cool thing I think it's 

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:31.550
 the fact of giving to play many people 

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:34.370
 who think I've seen map of 48 people 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:36.140
 then there is that war that is also 

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:37.580
 another point that I said you remember giving 

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:40.700
 tranquility and realizes that for you 

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:42.890
 see a ready well I think that's it 

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:45.170
 staff 21/3 a legal freight 

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:46.880
 so if you want more gameplay 

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:48.380
 of this game is a jewel of light sound and 

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:50.210
 video your favorites sign up for 

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:53.030
 channel scifi the new and that's it 

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:55.130
 Thank you, pardon me for what I showed. 

00:06:53.030 --> 00:07:01.790
 My face comes here for you and even more. 

00:06:55.130 --> 00:07:06.080
 staff spoke with a knife that I 

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:10.190
 I have a little warm weather 

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:13.240
 because the cool thing is that the card 

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:13.240
 boarding is chauvinist
