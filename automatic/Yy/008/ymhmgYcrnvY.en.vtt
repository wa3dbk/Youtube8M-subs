00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:43.020
 if I get confused in the camera by the 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.900
 component that surely maybe 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:48.800
 you heard my dad a little bit because 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.800
 also my sisters and me 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:58.599
 this one is already closed and maybe some challenge 

00:03:55.389 --> 00:04:01.530
 in with the girl because she was 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:01.530
 commenting on this 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:13.190
 all right 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:15.320
 well then I also bought this 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.910
 some chocolate frogs dear to the 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.660
 movie this were also from the 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.850
 venice movie 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:24.780
 good 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.780
 I'm not going to open it 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:29.620
 in clear for me and now we have to open 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.389
 seriously 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.389
 they have to go around 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:42.780
 and we are going to open it 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.290
 I have left jumping 

00:04:56.839 --> 00:05:06.270
 but 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:08.440
 good good here is the frog 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:11.490
 the chocolate 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.490
 it really seems 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:20.240
 I'm not going to take it out because if it's not a 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:21.590
 clutter and she told me that before 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:25.740
 open it 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:28.289
 so the obligation yes 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:30.889
 useless since I do not know what they bring you and 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:30.889
 apart down 

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:37.699

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:39.729

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:43.159
 I know English but not many words 

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:45.700
 well we can follow it on 

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:47.100
 pause and read it 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:48.600

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:01.330
 last last of all 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:06.940

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:12.720
 what if 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:19.050

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:23.440

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:28.729

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.729
 that fact 

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:35.210
 and it's worth 

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:45.060
 to change 

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:45.060
 you have to keep it, I 'm not going to do it 

00:06:47.409 --> 00:06:51.549

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:55.550

00:06:57.919 --> 00:07:03.630

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:03.630
