00:00:05.479 --> 00:00:09.710

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:11.030
 very long this time is not a video of a 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.490
 minecraft gameplay though what 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:15.680
 you have in the background yes it is but the 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.539
 theme is not this 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.910
 I have already collected the titles that most 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:21.800
 have liked the series of the new headquarters 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.240
 what will I do with subscribers and now 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.949
 I already have free time I 'm going to do 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.839
 videos with you I'll be able to 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:30.409
 interact as are the comrades and 

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:31.849
 well the thing is that they are more than nine 

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:35.660
 more than five titles that have 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:39.800
 delighted and then I decided to make a 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:42.200
 vote and that you vote we are going to 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.910
 leave the link in the description and I'll leave 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.440
 to avoid more or less good ones more or less 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.600
 less I will not dictate the titles that 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.140
 I have chosen are 'between survival 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.630
 Celestial aerial madness in freefall 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:57.800
 rampaging in the sky sky the sky lanz 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:58.940
 do not fall pain skies sky craft and big 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.680
 sky 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.000
 These are the titles that have hurt me the most 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.440
 liked those that you have put in the 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.780
 comments that I think are more than 200 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.060
 comments imagine what has 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:11.810
 cost choose the ones I like the most 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:14.750
 just leave the background gameplay that 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.430
 As you can see, it's a team deathmatch and good 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:20.330
 with much more I hope that I have 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:24.470
 liked the video is pretty good 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:26.150
 and nothing to vote on the website you know 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.670
 you have to select the ones that you most 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.920
 Like you can select more than one 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.140
 because you can always like more than 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.420
 one but usually select one or 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.490
 two and good the selections with the 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.860
 palomita you give abbott and in the 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:43.250
 results you will see good when finished 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.980
 this weekend on Sunday at the end 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.440
 it's Sunday I choose where I have 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:50.390
 more votes and that will be the title of the 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.400
 series and I'll be able to start recording with 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.470
 all of you because if I did not have the 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.620
 title could not record because what would you say 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:00.140
 we are in a new episode of the series 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:02.090
 that does not have a title because it is not 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.040
 plan and we are going that you have liked the 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.680
 video I leave you with the gameplay that is not going 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.209
 to last much longer I guess a minute 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.190
 and with some background music 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:12.230
 relaxing so you can relax 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.270
 our muscles while you vote these 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.760
 incredible titles for the new series 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:20.770
 not much more than telling me I say goodbye 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.770
 this metra do and goodbye camera
