going to use a kettlebell I recommend

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.399 
going to use a kettlebell I recommend
using<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.760> lighter<00:01:06.000> kettle<00:01:06.299> melt<00:01:06.450> so<00:01:06.840> until<00:01:07.320> you

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
using a lighter kettle melt so until you

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.190 
using a lighter kettle melt so until you
get<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:07.860> this<00:01:08.070> level<00:01:08.760> but<00:01:09.119> bland<00:01:09.900> is<00:01:10.020> going<00:01:10.140> to

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
get to this level but bland is going to

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.050 
get to this level but bland is going to
use<00:01:10.290> a<00:01:10.320> little<00:01:10.500> heavier<00:01:10.860> one<00:01:11.040> so<00:01:11.549> you're<00:01:11.939> going

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
use a little heavier one so you're going

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.780 
use a little heavier one so you're going
to<00:01:12.090> go<00:01:12.210> into<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.510> kettlebell<00:01:13.500> position<00:01:14.070> low

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
to go into a kettlebell position low

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.520 
to go into a kettlebell position low
wire<00:01:14.970> sort<00:01:15.270> with<00:01:15.420> stance<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:15.960> this<00:01:16.200> is<00:01:16.320> called

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
wire sort with stance and this is called

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.359 
wire sort with stance and this is called
an<00:01:16.619> alternate<00:01:17.330> swing<00:01:18.330> so<00:01:19.020> he's<00:01:19.470> throwing<00:01:20.070> the

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
an alternate swing so he's throwing the

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.550 
an alternate swing so he's throwing the
kettlebell<00:01:20.700> up<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:21.000> then<00:01:21.659> grabbing<00:01:22.080> it<00:01:22.409> which

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
kettlebell up and then grabbing it which

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.539 
kettlebell up and then grabbing it which
is<00:01:22.680> gonna<00:01:22.830> train<00:01:23.130> what's<00:01:23.369> called

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
is gonna train what's called

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.490 
is gonna train what's called
deceleration<00:01:24.540> which<00:01:24.689> really<00:01:25.200> helps

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
deceleration which really helps

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.499 
deceleration which really helps
strengthen<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:26.189> integrity<00:01:26.430> of<00:01:26.670> your<00:01:26.790> joints

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
strengthen the integrity of your joints

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.960 
strengthen the integrity of your joints
and<00:01:27.600> strengthens<00:01:28.560> your<00:01:28.650> core<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.340> movement

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
and strengthens your core the movement

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.219 
and strengthens your core the movement
which<00:01:30.270> you<00:01:30.420> probably<00:01:30.600> can't<00:01:30.780> tell<00:01:31.110> it

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
which you probably can't tell it

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.179 
which you probably can't tell it
probably<00:01:31.470> looks<00:01:31.590> like<00:01:31.710> he's<00:01:31.829> using<00:01:32.100> his

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
probably looks like he's using his

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.280 
probably looks like he's using his
shoulders<00:01:32.520> but<00:01:32.700> Brian<00:01:33.329> is<00:01:33.479> an<00:01:33.630> athlete<00:01:34.110> and

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
shoulders but Brian is an athlete and

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.990 
shoulders but Brian is an athlete and
he's<00:01:34.439> using<00:01:34.680> his<00:01:34.920> hips<00:01:35.189> in<00:01:35.310> his<00:01:35.460> core<00:01:35.670> so<00:01:35.880> he's

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
he's using his hips in his core so he's

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.149 
he's using his hips in his core so he's
generating<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.930> power<00:01:37.229> with<00:01:37.590> his<00:01:37.619> hips<00:01:37.950> and

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
generating the power with his hips and

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.969 
generating the power with his hips and
