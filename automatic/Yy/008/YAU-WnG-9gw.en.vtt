my studio on this video I wanted to show
you<00:00:06.899> how<00:00:07.020> I<00:00:07.049> tackle<00:00:07.350> our<00:00:07.589> real<00:00:07.770> difficult<00:00:08.400> fur

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
you how I tackle our real difficult fur

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.339 
you how I tackle our real difficult fur
and<00:00:09.059> I<00:00:09.360> couldn't<00:00:09.599> think<00:00:09.690> of<00:00:09.809> anything<00:00:10.050> more

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
and I couldn't think of anything more

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:11.660 
and I couldn't think of anything more
difficult<00:00:10.559> than<00:00:10.950> that<00:00:11.010> of<00:00:11.280> a<00:00:11.370> Snow<00:00:11.639> Leopard

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
difficult than that of a Snow Leopard

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.740 
difficult than that of a Snow Leopard
it's<00:00:12.630> really<00:00:13.049> thick<00:00:13.410> luxurious<00:00:13.920> and<00:00:14.730> also<00:00:15.450> the

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
it's really thick luxurious and also the

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.170 
it's really thick luxurious and also the
spots<00:00:16.170> and<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:16.770> twists<00:00:17.190> and<00:00:17.310> turns<00:00:17.550> of<00:00:17.910> the

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
spots and the twists and turns of the

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.939 
spots and the twists and turns of the
fur<00:00:18.449> and<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.869> texture<00:00:19.350> as<00:00:19.470> well

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
fur and the texture as well

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.189 
fur and the texture as well
really<00:00:20.520> I<00:00:20.880> made<00:00:21.300> me<00:00:21.480> think<00:00:21.750> that<00:00:21.869> this<00:00:21.990> was

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
really I made me think that this was

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.349 
really I made me think that this was
going<00:00:22.350> to<00:00:22.410> be<00:00:22.560> a<00:00:22.590> real<00:00:23.100> difficult<00:00:23.730> type<00:00:23.910> of<00:00:23.939> fur

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
going to be a real difficult type of fur

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.140 
going to be a real difficult type of fur
to<00:00:24.390> tackle<00:00:25.019> but<00:00:25.830> what<00:00:25.949> I<00:00:25.980> wanted<00:00:26.340> to<00:00:26.430> do<00:00:26.609> was

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
to tackle but what I wanted to do was

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.419 
to tackle but what I wanted to do was
then<00:00:27.420> simplify<00:00:28.230> my<00:00:28.439> process<00:00:28.890> from<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.310> other

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
then simplify my process from the other

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.450 
then simplify my process from the other
videos<00:00:29.849> I<00:00:30.150> didn't<00:00:30.990> use<00:00:31.140> any<00:00:31.470> medium<00:00:31.980> I've<00:00:32.219> only

the<00:00:37.590> only<00:00:37.770> thing<00:00:37.920> I've<00:00:38.070> used<00:00:38.370> is<00:00:38.550> some

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
the only thing I've used is some

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.150 
the only thing I've used is some
odorless<00:00:39.300> thinners<00:00:39.780> so<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.469> supplies<00:00:40.860> are

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
odorless thinners so the supplies are

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.029 
odorless thinners so the supplies are
really<00:00:41.730> simple<00:00:42.239> okay<00:00:45.050> so<00:00:46.050> I'm<00:00:46.350> gonna<00:00:46.500> mix<00:00:46.710> up<00:00:46.890> a

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
really simple okay so I'm gonna mix up a

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.700 
really simple okay so I'm gonna mix up a
mid-tone<00:00:47.640> color<00:00:48.120> I<00:00:48.480> just<00:00:48.660> put<00:00:49.050> a<00:00:49.320> little<00:00:49.469> bit

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
mid-tone color I just put a little bit

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.430 
mid-tone color I just put a little bit
of<00:00:49.829> odorless<00:00:50.430> thinners<00:00:50.820> on<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.390> palette<00:00:51.840> so

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
of odorless thinners on the palette so

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.200 
of odorless thinners on the palette so
I'm<00:00:52.530> gonna<00:00:52.620> mix<00:00:52.860> up<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.190> mid-tone<00:00:53.699> now<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.120> as

I'm gonna mix up the mid-tone now and as

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.250 
I'm gonna mix up the mid-tone now and as
I'm<00:00:54.390> doing<00:00:54.629> that

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.720 

with<00:00:59.260> these<00:00:59.380> opaque<00:00:59.860> colors<00:01:00.430> you're<00:01:00.610> gonna

with these opaque colors you're gonna

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:02.460 
with these opaque colors you're gonna
see<00:01:00.970> that<00:01:01.120> this<00:01:01.270> pinyin<00:01:01.660> will<00:01:01.810> come<00:01:01.990> along<00:01:02.230> and

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:02.470 
see that this pinyin will come along and

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:09.230 
see that this pinyin will come along and
start<00:01:03.100> to<00:01:03.310> grow<00:01:03.640> really<00:01:04.000> really<00:01:04.450> quickly

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.790 

once<00:01:10.240> again<00:01:10.360> I'm<00:01:10.630> painting<00:01:11.020> through<00:01:11.320> that's<00:01:11.500> a

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:11.800 
once again I'm painting through that's a

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.460 
once again I'm painting through that's a
bit<00:01:12.130> further<00:01:12.430> away<00:01:12.670> then<00:01:13.540> overlap<00:01:14.170> in<00:01:14.350> the

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
bit further away then overlap in the

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.290 
bit further away then overlap in the
strokes<00:01:14.740> lately<00:01:17.220> my<00:01:18.220> brush<00:01:18.520> is<00:01:18.700> generally<00:01:19.210> at

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:19.300 
strokes lately my brush is generally at

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.240 
strokes lately my brush is generally at
around<00:01:19.540> about<00:01:19.720> a<00:01:19.780> 45<00:01:20.380> degree<00:01:20.530> angle<00:01:20.740> to<00:01:21.220> the

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
around about a 45 degree angle to the

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.860 
around about a 45 degree angle to the
canvas<00:01:23.610> what<00:01:24.610> I'm<00:01:24.730> gonna<00:01:24.880> do<00:01:25.090> now<00:01:25.330> is<00:01:25.360> make<00:01:25.720> up

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:25.870 
canvas what I'm gonna do now is make up

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:29.160 
canvas what I'm gonna do now is make up
a<00:01:25.930> nice<00:01:26.110> deep<00:01:26.440> dark<00:01:27.130> black<00:01:27.520> and<00:01:27.880> I<00:01:28.630> wanna<00:01:28.840> paint

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:33.480 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.110 

then<00:01:34.410> you<00:01:34.530> can<00:01:34.680> see<00:01:34.800> quite<00:01:35.070> easily<00:01:35.130> now<00:01:35.820> how

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:36.120 
then you can see quite easily now how

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.500 
then you can see quite easily now how
that<00:01:36.150> under<00:01:36.930> paintin<00:01:37.470> is<00:01:38.240> stopping<00:01:39.240> me

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:39.510 
that under paintin is stopping me

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.870 
that under paintin is stopping me
needing<00:01:40.110> to<00:01:40.140> put<00:01:40.440> in<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.680> million<00:01:41.100> tiny<00:01:41.370> hairs

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
needing to put in a million tiny hairs

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.030 
needing to put in a million tiny hairs
to<00:01:42.210> get<00:01:42.620> virtually<00:01:43.620> the<00:01:43.770> same<00:01:43.800> effect<00:01:45.890> and<00:01:46.890> you

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
to get virtually the same effect and you

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.260 
to get virtually the same effect and you
really<00:01:47.490> just<00:01:47.760> looking<00:01:48.180> at<00:01:48.330> create<00:01:49.170> in<00:01:49.730> fur<00:01:50.730> no

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
really just looking at create in fur no

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.760 
really just looking at create in fur no
this<00:01:51.450> could<00:01:51.660> be<00:01:51.780> it<00:01:51.870> you<00:01:52.050> could<00:01:52.350> do<00:01:52.440> it<00:01:52.560> with<00:01:52.740> a

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
this could be it you could do it with a

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.310 
this could be it you could do it with a
tiger<00:01:53.340> or<00:01:53.370> a<00:01:53.520> lion<00:01:53.820> if<00:01:54.540> you're<00:01:54.780> a<00:01:54.810> beginner<00:01:55.230> and

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
may be good to start without the spot so

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:03.870 
may be good to start without the spot so
lions<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:58.020> easy
