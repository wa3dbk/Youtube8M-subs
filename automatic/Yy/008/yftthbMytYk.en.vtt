00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
and the other one behind you it's a

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
reciprocal motion of running now you're

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.380 
reciprocal motion of running now you're
going<00:00:31.470> to<00:00:31.529> step<00:00:31.800> backwards<00:00:32.399> with<00:00:32.910> that<00:00:33.120> foot

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
going to step backwards with that foot

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.240 
going to step backwards with that foot
and<00:00:33.660> as<00:00:33.780> you<00:00:33.899> do<00:00:34.050> so<00:00:34.079> move<00:00:34.649> your<00:00:34.770> arms<00:00:35.070> in<00:00:35.160> the

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
and as you do so move your arms in the

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.680 
and as you do so move your arms in the
opposite<00:00:35.579> direction<00:00:35.700> we're<00:00:36.450> going<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.630> go

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
opposite direction we're going to go

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.600 
opposite direction we're going to go
forward<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:37.380> backward<00:00:37.800> just<00:00:38.010> like<00:00:38.160> this<00:00:38.340> for

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
forward and backward just like this for

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.440 
forward and backward just like this for
10<00:00:38.790> strides<00:00:39.120> forward<00:00:39.450> is<00:00:39.690> 1<00:00:39.980> this<00:00:40.980> is<00:00:41.190> 2<00:00:41.430> as<00:00:41.670> you

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
10 strides forward is 1 this is 2 as you

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.940 
10 strides forward is 1 this is 2 as you
step<00:00:42.719> back<00:00:42.899> make<00:00:43.230> sure<00:00:43.260> you're<00:00:43.559> stepping

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
step back make sure you're stepping

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.380 
step back make sure you're stepping
forward<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.430> backwards<00:00:44.789> just<00:00:44.879> in<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.120> straight

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
forward and backwards just in a straight

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.450 
forward and backwards just in a straight
playing<00:00:45.629> a<00:00:45.719> common<00:00:46.110> error<00:00:46.410> is<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:46.950> turn<00:00:47.309> your

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
playing a common error is to turn your

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.910 
playing a common error is to turn your
foot<00:00:47.670> outward<00:00:47.940> as<00:00:48.390> you<00:00:48.450> step<00:00:49.200> back<00:00:49.379> make<00:00:49.890> sure

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
foot outward as you step back make sure

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.979 
foot outward as you step back make sure
you<00:00:50.190> stay<00:00:50.430> right<00:00:50.670> here<00:00:51.059> in<00:00:51.210> that<00:00:51.629> stride

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
you stay right here in that stride

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.130 
you stay right here in that stride
position<00:00:52.199> so<00:00:52.649> it's<00:00:52.770> looking<00:00:53.100> like<00:00:53.280> this<00:00:54.140> after

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
position so it's looking like this after

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.709 
position so it's looking like this after
you've<00:00:55.260> done<00:00:55.469> 10<00:00:55.860> with<00:00:56.699> normal<00:00:57.149> stride<00:00:57.420> length

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
you've done 10 with normal stride length

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.450 
you've done 10 with normal stride length
then<00:00:58.199> we're<00:00:58.379> going<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.559> go<00:00:58.680> 10<00:00:58.949> with<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.160> long

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
then we're going to go 10 with the long

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.369 
then we're going to go 10 with the long
stride<00:00:59.699> so<00:01:00.030> put<00:01:00.210> that<00:01:00.359> right<00:01:00.570> foot<00:01:00.750> way<00:01:01.020> out<00:01:01.230> in

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
stride so put that right foot way out in

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.979 
stride so put that right foot way out in
front<00:01:01.410> left<00:01:02.190> arm<00:01:02.460> up<00:01:02.699> right<00:01:03.120> on<00:01:03.300> back<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:03.660> take

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
front left arm up right on back and take

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.980 
front left arm up right on back and take
a<00:01:04.019> big<00:01:04.470> stride<00:01:04.949> going<00:01:05.549> forward<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:06.360> backward

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
a big stride going forward and backward

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.510 
a big stride going forward and backward
again<00:01:07.200> watch<00:01:07.439> for<00:01:07.710> that<00:01:07.740> turn<00:01:08.070> out<00:01:08.280> of<00:01:08.400> that

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
again watch for that turn out of that

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.760 
again watch for that turn out of that
foot<00:01:08.790> make<00:01:09.180> sure<00:01:09.420> it<00:01:09.570> stays<00:01:09.810> straight<00:01:10.320> as<00:01:10.560> you

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
foot make sure it stays straight as you

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.149 
foot make sure it stays straight as you
step<00:01:11.010> back<00:01:11.689> 10<00:01:12.689> repetitions<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.650> then<00:01:14.040> you're

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
step back 10 repetitions and then you're

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.679 
step back 10 repetitions and then you're
going<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.340> turn<00:01:14.490> into<00:01:14.549> a<00:01:14.820> short<00:01:15.150> quick<00:01:15.390> stride

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
going to turn into a short quick stride

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.370 
going to turn into a short quick stride
so<00:01:16.409> it<00:01:16.470> looks<00:01:16.650> like<00:01:16.710> this<00:01:16.979> I<00:01:18.020> get<00:01:19.020> those<00:01:19.140> arms

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
so it looks like this I get those arms

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.120 
so it looks like this I get those arms
moving<00:01:19.530> with<00:01:19.920> every<00:01:20.250> footstep<00:01:20.600> 10<00:01:21.600> reps

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
moving with every footstep 10 reps

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.890 
moving with every footstep 10 reps
you'll<00:01:23.130> do<00:01:23.310> that<00:01:23.340> same<00:01:23.790> action<00:01:24.330> on<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.720> other

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
you'll do that same action on the other

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.530 
you'll do that same action on the other
leg<00:01:25.170> now<00:01:26.040> we're<00:01:26.280> going<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.430> get<00:01:27.000> your<00:01:27.150> motion

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
leg now we're going to get your motion

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.690 
leg now we're going to get your motion
going<00:01:27.689> side<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.080> side<00:01:28.259> so<00:01:29.040> we<00:01:29.159> put<00:01:29.340> your<00:01:29.490> feet<00:01:29.670> a

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
going side to side so we put your feet a

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.249 
going side to side so we put your feet a
little<00:01:29.759> bit<00:01:29.939> wider<00:01:30.150> sometimes<00:01:30.869> I'll<00:01:31.020> have<00:01:31.049> a

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
little bit wider sometimes I'll have a

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.929 
little bit wider sometimes I'll have a
line<00:01:31.619> on<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.979> ground<00:01:32.250> if<00:01:32.369> you<00:01:32.460> run<00:01:32.640> it<00:01:32.729> working

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
line on the ground if you run it working

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.060 
line on the ground if you run it working
off<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.090> track<00:01:33.390> it<00:01:33.570> works<00:01:33.750> great<00:01:33.960> then<00:01:34.799> you<00:01:34.920> can

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
off a track it works great then you can

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.039 
off a track it works great then you can
start<00:01:35.280> here<00:01:35.640> with<00:01:35.670> a<00:01:35.820> wider<00:01:36.150> position<00:01:36.659> put

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
start here with a wider position put

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.690 
start here with a wider position put
your<00:01:37.229> foot<00:01:37.409> same<00:01:37.740> thing<00:01:37.920> in<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.070> normal<00:01:38.250> stride

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
your foot same thing in a normal stride

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
up this inner thigh do the same thing

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.330 
up this inner thigh do the same thing
with<00:01:59.040> a<00:01:59.070> long<00:01:59.430> stride<00:01:59.820> position<00:02:00.030> live<00:02:00.810> long<00:02:01.340> so

with a long stride position live long so

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.389 
with a long stride position live long so
looks<00:02:02.579> like<00:02:02.640> this<00:02:02.759> and<00:02:04.100> then<00:02:05.100> we're<00:02:05.219> going<00:02:05.310> to

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
looks like this and then we're going to

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.109 
looks like this and then we're going to
go<00:02:05.460> wide<00:02:05.729> short<00:02:06.719> so<00:02:07.229> opposite<00:02:07.710> arm<00:02:07.950> up<00:02:08.129> real

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
go wide short so opposite arm up real

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.979 
go wide short so opposite arm up real
quick<00:02:09.420> wyd<00:02:10.140> position<00:02:10.709> though<00:02:11.510> 10<00:02:12.510> reps<00:02:12.780> for

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
quick wyd position though 10 reps for

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.550 
quick wyd position though 10 reps for
each<00:02:13.140> of<00:02:13.290> those

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
each of those

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.250 
each of those
then<00:02:13.980> hit<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.310> right<00:02:14.459> side<00:02:14.730> now<00:02:15.630> now<00:02:16.170> we're

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
then hit the right side now now we're

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.780 
then hit the right side now now we're
going<00:02:16.349> to<00:02:16.440> finish<00:02:16.590> up<00:02:16.860> now<00:02:17.040> with<00:02:17.280> going<00:02:17.640> with<00:02:17.670> a

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
going to finish up now with going with a

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.059 
going to finish up now with going with a
narrow<00:02:18.090> stride<00:02:18.540> so<00:02:19.080> now<00:02:19.349> we're<00:02:19.739> going<00:02:19.830> to<00:02:19.920> go

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
narrow stride so now we're going to go

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.780 
narrow stride so now we're going to go
right<00:02:21.060> foot<00:02:21.360> in<00:02:21.450> front<00:02:21.569> of<00:02:21.720> left<00:02:21.900> foot

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
right foot in front of left foot

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.370 
right foot in front of left foot
opposite<00:02:23.790> arm<00:02:23.910> up<00:02:24.180> and<00:02:24.390> we're<00:02:25.080> two<00:02:25.140> step

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
opposite arm up and we're two step

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.790 
opposite arm up and we're two step
behind<00:02:25.849> so<00:02:26.849> now<00:02:27.150> runners<00:02:27.810> distance<00:02:28.560> runners

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
behind so now runners distance runners

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.650 
behind so now runners distance runners
especially<00:02:28.890> tend<00:02:29.760> to<00:02:29.849> run<00:02:29.970> with<00:02:30.090> a<00:02:30.120> little

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
especially tend to run with a little

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.449 
especially tend to run with a little
narrower<00:02:31.080> base<00:02:31.349> of<00:02:31.530> support<00:02:31.860> than<00:02:32.010> a<00:02:32.099> sprinter

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
narrower base of support than a sprinter

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.309 
narrower base of support than a sprinter
so<00:02:32.610> this<00:02:32.730> is<00:02:32.880> real<00:02:33.180> important<00:02:33.690> to<00:02:34.050> get<00:02:34.200> this

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
so this is real important to get this

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:37.670 
so this is real important to get this
warm<00:02:34.620> up<00:02:34.739> position<00:02:35.190> narrow<00:02:35.790> position<00:02:36.680> tougher

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
warm up position narrow position tougher

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.890 
warm up position narrow position tougher
on<00:02:37.709> your<00:02:37.980> balance<00:02:38.480> but<00:02:39.480> good<00:02:39.660> for<00:02:39.840> your

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
on your balance but good for your

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.890 
on your balance but good for your
stretching<00:02:40.410> your<00:02:40.530> biomechanics<00:02:41.190> of<00:02:41.250> running

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
stretching your biomechanics of running

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.660 
stretching your biomechanics of running
we're<00:02:42.900> going<00:02:43.019> to<00:02:43.080> go<00:02:43.200> 10<00:02:43.800> times<00:02:43.830> forward<00:02:44.550> and

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
we're going to go 10 times forward and

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.520 
we're going to go 10 times forward and
backward<00:02:45.030> on<00:02:45.150> the<00:02:45.569> right<00:02:45.750> leg<00:02:45.959> on<00:02:46.140> the<00:02:46.200> left

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
backward on the right leg on the left

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.380 
backward on the right leg on the left
leg<00:02:46.709> now<00:02:47.610> we're<00:02:47.760> going<00:02:47.850> to<00:02:47.910> work<00:02:48.090> three

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
leg now we're going to work three

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:49.970 
leg now we're going to work three
dimensionally<00:02:48.989> the<00:02:49.110> third<00:02:49.380> is<00:02:49.530> a<00:02:49.560> transverse

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
dimensionally the third is a transverse

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.370 
dimensionally the third is a transverse
plane<00:02:50.310> so<00:02:50.910> we're<00:02:51.060> to<00:02:51.120> keep<00:02:51.330> your<00:02:51.510> left<00:02:52.140> foot

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
plane so we're to keep your left foot

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.500 
plane so we're to keep your left foot
slightly<00:02:52.650> towed<00:02:52.980> in<00:02:53.130> your<00:02:54.000> right<00:02:54.209> foot<00:02:54.450> is

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
slightly towed in your right foot is

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.270 
slightly towed in your right foot is
going<00:02:54.540> to<00:02:54.720> be<00:02:54.810> forward<00:02:55.260> and<00:02:55.440> slightly<00:02:55.799> toten

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
going to be forward and slightly toten

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.530 
going to be forward and slightly toten
so<00:02:56.430> both<00:02:56.610> of<00:02:56.640> them<00:02:56.850> are<00:02:56.910> in<00:02:56.940> the<00:02:57.030> pigeon<00:02:57.360> toed

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
so both of them are in the pigeon toed

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.140 
so both of them are in the pigeon toed
position<00:02:58.019> opposite<00:02:59.010> arm<00:02:59.220> position<00:02:59.640> and<00:02:59.849> we're

only<00:03:31.140> worked<00:03:31.829> on<00:03:31.980> your<00:03:32.130> stride<00:03:32.430> and<00:03:32.730> a<00:03:33.390> normal

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
only worked on your stride and a normal

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.660 
only worked on your stride and a normal
would<00:03:33.989> call<00:03:34.200> sagittal<00:03:35.100> plane<00:03:35.160> but<00:03:35.549> we've

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
would call sagittal plane but we've

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.160 
would call sagittal plane but we've
worked<00:03:35.880> out<00:03:36.030> it<00:03:36.150> side<00:03:36.359> to<00:03:36.390> side<00:03:36.600> and<00:03:37.049> we've

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
worked out it side to side and we've

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.990 
worked out it side to side and we've
worked<00:03:37.350> on<00:03:37.500> the<00:03:37.620> transverse<00:03:38.100> plane<00:03:38.310> so<00:03:38.790> you're

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
worked on the transverse plane so you're

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.910 
worked on the transverse plane so you're
ready<00:03:39.150> to<00:03:39.269> go<00:03:39.420> out<00:03:39.450> and<00:03:39.750> run<00:03:39.930> your<00:03:40.230> competition

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
ready to go out and run your competition

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.090 
ready to go out and run your competition
or<00:03:41.130> have<00:03:41.430> a<00:03:41.459> great<00:03:41.640> workout
