00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:03.710 

okay<00:00:01.770> this<00:00:01.949> is<00:00:02.100> the<00:00:02.220> Phillips<00:00:02.580> 75<00:00:03.120> watt<00:00:03.360> LED

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
okay this is the Phillips 75 watt LED

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.599 
okay this is the Phillips 75 watt LED
bulb<00:00:03.959> and<00:00:04.650> I'm<00:00:04.740> just<00:00:04.859> gonna<00:00:04.950> turn<00:00:05.160> on<00:00:05.400> so<00:00:05.580> you

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
bulb and I'm just gonna turn on so you

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:06.829 
bulb and I'm just gonna turn on so you
can<00:00:05.730> kind<00:00:05.850> of<00:00:05.879> see<00:00:06.060> what<00:00:06.210> it<00:00:06.270> looks<00:00:06.420> like<00:00:06.509> when

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
can kind of see what it looks like when

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.650 
can kind of see what it looks like when
it's<00:00:06.990> actually<00:00:07.560> turned<00:00:08.130> on<00:00:08.309> I<00:00:08.580> have<00:00:09.450> the<00:00:09.540> white

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
it's actually turned on I have the white

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.660 
it's actually turned on I have the white
balance<00:00:09.840> like<00:00:10.080> camera<00:00:10.380> adjusted<00:00:10.830> so<00:00:11.490> it

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
balance like camera adjusted so it

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.240 
balance like camera adjusted so it
should<00:00:11.969> put<00:00:12.120> out<00:00:12.210> a<00:00:12.240> nice<00:00:12.420> white<00:00:13.290> light<00:00:13.559> which

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
should put out a nice white light which

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.099 
should put out a nice white light which
is<00:00:14.370> actually<00:00:14.670> pretty<00:00:14.849> representative<00:00:15.509> of

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
is actually pretty representative of

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.269 
is actually pretty representative of
what<00:00:16.379> it<00:00:16.470> puts<00:00:16.560> out<00:00:17.630> so<00:00:18.630> there<00:00:18.750> you<00:00:18.810> can<00:00:18.840> see

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:19.279 
what it puts out so there you can see

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:22.160 
what it puts out so there you can see
how<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.340> light<00:00:20.490> comes<00:00:20.609> out<00:00:20.789> of<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.029> loops<00:00:21.900> and

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
how the light comes out of the loops and

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.550 
how the light comes out of the loops and
it<00:00:22.260> is<00:00:22.380> indeed<00:00:22.680> white<00:00:22.949> I<00:00:23.689> know<00:00:24.689> in<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:24.930> retail

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
it is indeed white I know in the retail

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.920 
it is indeed white I know in the retail
packaging<00:00:26.099> they<00:00:26.939> have<00:00:27.119> a<00:00:27.150> big<00:00:27.449> sticker<00:00:27.810> right

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
packaging they have a big sticker right

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.990 
packaging they have a big sticker right
over<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.470> yellow<00:00:28.890> plastic<00:00:29.429> that<00:00:29.490> says<00:00:29.699> puts

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
over the yellow plastic that says puts

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.479 
over the yellow plastic that says puts
out<00:00:30.119> white<00:00:30.840> light<00:00:31.080> because<00:00:32.040> I'm<00:00:32.130> sure<00:00:32.250> people

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
out white light because I'm sure people

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.280 
out white light because I'm sure people
are<00:00:32.579> kind<00:00:32.880> of<00:00:32.910> confused<00:00:33.059> easily<00:00:33.809> about<00:00:33.989> what

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
are kind of confused easily about what

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.440 
are kind of confused easily about what
color<00:00:34.469> puts<00:00:34.739> out<00:00:34.890> based<00:00:35.850> on<00:00:36.090> what<00:00:36.239> it<00:00:36.300> looks

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
color puts out based on what it looks

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.720 
color puts out based on what it looks
like<00:00:36.570> when<00:00:36.750> it's<00:00:36.870> shut<00:00:36.989> off<00:00:37.340> but<00:00:38.340> it<00:00:38.430> is<00:00:38.550> good

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
like when it's shut off but it is good

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.020 
like when it's shut off but it is good
light<00:00:40.010> I'm<00:00:41.010> gonna<00:00:41.219> let<00:00:41.340> this<00:00:41.430> run<00:00:41.640> for<00:00:41.670> about

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
light I'm gonna let this run for about

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.060 
light I'm gonna let this run for about
half<00:00:42.239> an<00:00:42.360> hour<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:42.750> I'll<00:00:43.530> come<00:00:43.739> back<00:00:43.770> and

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
half an hour and I'll come back and

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.229 
half an hour and I'll come back and
measure<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.340> temperature<00:00:44.579> of<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.910> heat<00:00:45.030> sink

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
measure the temperature of the heat sink

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.990 
measure the temperature of the heat sink
just<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.870> see<00:00:45.989> how<00:00:46.050> hot<00:00:46.200> it<00:00:46.320> gets<00:00:46.969> normally<00:00:47.969> I

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
just to see how hot it gets normally I

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.790 
just to see how hot it gets normally I
have<00:00:48.329> this<00:00:48.480> in<00:00:48.690> somewhat<00:00:49.500> more<00:00:49.680> of<00:00:49.710> an

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
have this in somewhat more of an

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.380 
have this in somewhat more of an
enclosed<00:00:50.190> fixture

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
enclosed fixture

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.790 
enclosed fixture
I<00:00:51.420> took<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:52.140> Bell<00:00:52.760> off<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:54.059> lamp<00:00:54.590> so<00:00:55.590> it<00:00:55.649> might

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
I took the Bell off the lamp so it might

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.590 
I took the Bell off the lamp so it might
not<00:00:56.160> quite<00:00:56.430> be<00:00:56.489> as<00:00:56.670> warm<00:00:56.910> as<00:00:57.000> it<00:00:57.059> would<00:00:57.210> be<00:00:57.329> when

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
not quite be as warm as it would be when

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.720 
not quite be as warm as it would be when
I<00:00:57.660> normally<00:00:57.960> operate<00:00:58.320> it<00:00:58.410> I<00:00:58.559> can<00:00:59.250> see<00:00:59.430> in<00:00:59.579> there

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
I normally operate it I can see in there

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.630 
I normally operate it I can see in there
I've<00:00:59.850> got<00:00:59.879> I<00:01:00.359> kept<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.020> receipt<00:01:01.640> because

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
I've got I kept the receipt because

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.750 
I've got I kept the receipt because
guaranteed<00:01:03.329> for<00:01:03.600> six<00:01:04.049> years<00:01:04.409> so<00:01:04.979> I<00:01:05.010> figure<00:01:05.489> you

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
guaranteed for six years so I figure you

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.899 
guaranteed for six years so I figure you
know<00:01:06.540> I<00:01:06.869> use<00:01:07.049> it<00:01:07.170> quite<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.350> bit<00:01:07.490> so<00:01:08.490> I<00:01:08.520> can<00:01:08.640> that

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
know I use it quite a bit so I can that

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:09.980 
know I use it quite a bit so I can that
might<00:01:09.030> come<00:01:09.180> in<00:01:09.270> handy<00:01:09.360> but<00:01:09.600> keeping<00:01:09.900> that

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
might come in handy but keeping that

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.880 
might come in handy but keeping that
anyway<00:01:10.979> when<00:01:11.880> I<00:01:11.909> never<00:01:12.060> operate<00:01:12.420> this<00:01:12.890> with

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
anyway when I never operate this with

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.760 
anyway when I never operate this with
the<00:01:14.159> actual<00:01:14.580> shade<00:01:15.060> on<00:01:15.240> there<00:01:16.229> vents<00:01:16.619> in<00:01:16.710> the

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
the actual shade on there vents in the

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.609 
the actual shade on there vents in the
back<00:01:16.950> of<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.159> lamp<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:18.290> there<00:01:19.290> are<00:01:19.439> some

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
back of the lamp and there are some

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:20.929 
back of the lamp and there are some
convection<00:01:20.130> currents<00:01:20.460> that<00:01:20.549> go<00:01:20.670> through<00:01:20.850> the

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
convection currents that go through the

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:21.350 
convection currents that go through the
lamp

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
lamp

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.160 
lamp
I<00:01:21.390> actually<00:01:21.750> took<00:01:22.080> a<00:01:22.200> smoldering<00:01:22.740> piece<00:01:23.040> of

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
I actually took a smoldering piece of

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.109 
I actually took a smoldering piece of
paper<00:01:25.170> towel<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:26.189> with<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.490> smoke<00:01:26.790> gets

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
paper towel and with the smoke gets

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.280 
paper towel and with the smoke gets
sucked<00:01:27.390> in<00:01:27.509> through<00:01:27.540> here<00:01:27.869> so<00:01:28.020> like<00:01:28.110> I<00:01:28.170> see

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
sucked in through here so like I see

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.840 
sucked in through here so like I see
there<00:01:28.409> is<00:01:28.500> convection<00:01:28.860> actually<00:01:29.729> going

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
there is convection actually going

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.700 
there is convection actually going
through<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.299> fixture<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:31.170> help<00:01:31.290> cool<00:01:31.470> it<00:01:31.590> off

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
through the fixture to help cool it off

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.560 
through the fixture to help cool it off
so<00:01:32.009> that<00:01:32.280> convection<00:01:33.150> is<00:01:33.210> not<00:01:33.329> going<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.509> be

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
so that convection is not going to be

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.960 
so that convection is not going to be
present<00:01:33.960> in<00:01:34.110> this<00:01:34.200> configuration<00:01:34.850> but<00:01:35.850> it's

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
present in this configuration but it's

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.670 
present in this configuration but it's
more<00:01:36.090> exposed<00:01:36.479> I<00:01:36.659> expect<00:01:37.020> it<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.170> probably<00:01:37.409> be

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
more exposed I expect it to probably be

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.140 
more exposed I expect it to probably be
a<00:01:37.710> little<00:01:37.829> bit<00:01:37.950> cooler<00:01:38.310> than<00:01:38.850> it<00:01:39.000> would<00:01:39.119> be

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
a little bit cooler than it would be

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.030 
a little bit cooler than it would be
otherwise<00:01:39.240> but<00:01:39.840> anyway<00:01:40.560> I'll<00:01:40.650> come<00:01:40.799> back<00:01:40.890> in

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
otherwise but anyway I'll come back in

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.679 
otherwise but anyway I'll come back in
about<00:01:41.159> half<00:01:41.369> an<00:01:41.460> hour<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:41.880> then<00:01:42.360> measure<00:01:42.570> the

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
about half an hour and then measure the

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:43.730 
about half an hour and then measure the
temperature<00:01:43.049> so<00:01:43.229> you<00:01:43.290> can<00:01:43.409> see<00:01:43.560> what<00:01:43.649> its

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
temperature so you can see what its

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.010 
temperature so you can see what its
gonna<00:01:43.799> be<00:01:44.210> okay<00:01:45.210> this<00:01:45.360> bulbs<00:01:45.659> been<00:01:45.780> running

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.649 
for about 45 minutes now I'm gonna check
the<00:01:48.869> temperature<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.290> see<00:01:49.439> how<00:01:49.560> warm<00:01:49.799> it<00:01:49.890> got

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
the temperature to see how warm it got

I'm gonna shut this off and then see
what<00:01:54.780> time<00:01:54.990> temperature<00:01:55.560> can<00:01:55.680> get

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
what time temperature can get

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:02.030 
what time temperature can get
okay<00:01:57.899> so<00:01:57.960> here's<00:01:58.170> towards<00:01:58.439> the<00:01:58.530> base<00:01:59.540> and<00:02:01.040> scan

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
okay so here's towards the base and scan

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:15.460 
okay so here's towards the base and scan
up<00:02:02.280> towards<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:02.640> top

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470

yes<00:02:16.100> you<00:02:16.220> can<00:02:16.370> see<00:02:16.580> it's<00:02:16.730> about<00:02:17.720> a<00:02:17.960> hundred<00:02:18.410> and

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
yes you can see it's about a hundred and

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.500 
yes you can see it's about a hundred and
fifty<00:02:18.620> degrees<00:02:19.040> on<00:02:19.280> average<00:02:19.430> at<00:02:19.910> the<00:02:20.030> base<00:02:20.180> and

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
fifty degrees on average at the base and

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.480 
fifty degrees on average at the base and
up<00:02:21.260> towards<00:02:21.500> the<00:02:21.560> top<00:02:21.740> where<00:02:21.920> the<00:02:21.950> actual<00:02:22.100> LEDs

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
up towards the top where the actual LEDs

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:27.250 
up towards the top where the actual LEDs
are<00:02:22.700> it's<00:02:22.880> closer<00:02:23.180> to<00:02:23.300> you<00:02:24.520> 160<00:02:26.080> so<00:02:27.080> that's
