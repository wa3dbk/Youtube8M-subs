00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:04.670
 here 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.440
 it's offensive 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.860
 and everyone at the school can see that Berliners came from Ossietzky 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.269
 High school on alert like almost all schools in Germany 

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:22.499
 Victims to the guitars pillory bullied for all who see their cell phone via 

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:26.869
 Internet the cyber-world poisoned the reality on the internet side 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:30.960
 Everybody else is able to finish secret the victims of the 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.830
 Attacks do not know who is behind it 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:35.370
 everyone could have been 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.510
 Not only will the community find there 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:39.160
 found on the toilet 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.170
 you could over times 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.710
 Now you have to be able to paint virtually 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.520
 and nobody knows how the system works 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.260
 insofar it is forbidden to her 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.820
 24 hours a day, day and night 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.820
 Can anyone read that someone is dealing? 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.560
 here in this class was the last attack Enlightenment is needed 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.200
 I dar 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.150
 but hello 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.990
 as criminal offenses 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.799
 Police Chief Commissioner Scherbarth explains to students the legal 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:13.610
 Consequences of bullying 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.400
 He explains to victims how they could protect themselves Crisis prevention 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.120
 This is what the Berlin police call them, they are looking for contact with schools 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.160
 even come to protein brawls for bullying on the Internet 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.490
 Result 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.530
 Victims fight back One hundred and fifty insults have already been reported 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.960
 but there are even worse scenarios some schools in Berlin have on 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.760
 October get like this school in Pankow the Senate is at the worst 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.820
 prepared 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.030
 There are ten contingency plans that write like a school board too 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.860
 has to act 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.420
 Clearly, whatever the police are turned on in the marketplace, these became 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.390
 Children notice a threat analysis 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.360
 delayed delivery is or is not 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.010
 luckily there were no amok threats at his school but also his 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.289
 Students are made over a sign SZ 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:04.030
 Pachter SchÃ¶neberger has warned to the pupils' spokesman 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.630
 they should themselves be doing some business around bullied schoolmates to help them out 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.700
 Do this with humor, boycott the site instead of solving gossip 

00:02:13.669 --> 00:02:16.669
 completely different information 

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:22.790
 but Alphonse does solve this for the youthful post on Ash Roosevelt 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.909
 we just want to have it solid 

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:28.629
 currently being asked about things of carriages and costumes for Wikipedia articles 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:29.519
 would have 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:33.939
 or others just to get other things and some things 

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:35.089
 path 

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:36.680
 the idea works 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.050
 The site was free from gossip for weeks, because only 50 entries 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.659
 are displayed per school meanwhile 

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:45.239
 is the page on the index 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:46.889
 but the students demanded more 

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:49.079
 go public with it 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:51.279
 written on TV 

00:02:51.279 --> 00:02:53.449
 try us 

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:56.939
 the page al-schogur Siepert absolutely no raison d'Ãªtre this absolutely 

00:02:56.939 --> 00:02:57.689
 dreadful 

00:02:57.689 --> 00:03:01.909
 you have no control over what is written on the internet about him 

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:06.810
 wos lands who reads it and there must be something against it and there 

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:07.429
 is 

00:03:07.429 --> 00:03:10.799
 that was briefly the first first step in which Celler could do but long-term 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:13.849
 should prohibitions 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:17.450
 because on the page is not only made with words and pictures 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:18.650
 Student bare 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.919
 sneaky 

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:26.559
 the whole affair clearly be the program in the morning just when they are more 

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:30.819
 Videos or photos show the other domestic unpleasant situation 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:32.259
 Cooling scenes 

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:35.999
 that's kind of a trophy hunt is among the teenagers 

00:03:35.999 --> 00:03:39.999
 has the worst brutal video or who has the best stock of his 

00:03:39.999 --> 00:03:43.769
 Girlfriend the employment place to which means here also so acknowledgment 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:46.059
 of performance offered her a certain role 

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:49.900
 Sociologist Catherine Klipfel has been researching internet bullying for years 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:54.989
 Eicher Gosse show the designer world into reality via division 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.319
 Aug threats brutal brawls 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:01.539
 But internet forums like Facebook are now a reality 

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:05.409
 a reality for students as well as school life 

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:10.620
 one goes also in the instruction company representatives festival program 

00:04:10.619 --> 00:04:13.069
 put the social 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:14.549
 Hansen 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:19.190
 Muenster while dancing they show their most intimate thoughts with forgotten 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:23.460
 the driven out of the world wide web i'm not coming to empire and in the 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:24.630
 Night lived in tents 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.730
 that was what someone would write 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:30.380
 about me then I would be really scared so far you do not know who it was 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.700
 and how ill he is such threats on the al-Shabab south side 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.389
 change the school life at the Carl von Ossietzky Gymnasium 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:41.370
 because the platforms are acting perfidiously 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.150
 that's mean that back over the school 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.150
 the schools are normally shelters 

00:04:48.059 --> 00:04:51.629
 some things except that from society to teenagers 

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:53.569
 penetrates outside 

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:59.520
 and here you drink this shelter space the schools are trying their students too 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.750
 protect the strong for the Styrian world with the so 

00:05:02.749 --> 00:05:04.349
 of course also Saxony 

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:06.840
 because the next attack is presented
