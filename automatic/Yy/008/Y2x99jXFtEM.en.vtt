feel as clean they said but with these
um<00:01:46.049> I<00:01:46.619> have<00:01:47.579> actually<00:01:48.060> not<00:01:48.329> had<00:01:48.600> a<00:01:48.630> problem

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
um I have actually not had a problem

with them and it doesn't set as much as

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.450 
with them and it doesn't set as much as
shampoo<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.350> that's<00:01:52.470> why<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.829> sulfate<00:01:53.310> is

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460
