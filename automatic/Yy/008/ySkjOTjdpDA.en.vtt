00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:24.760 
to do that every single game and i think

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.660

to<00:01:24.910> an<00:01:25.000> extent<00:01:25.300> i'm<00:01:25.570> blessed<00:01:26.250> that<00:01:27.250> is<00:01:27.370> that<00:01:27.550> it

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
to an extent i'm blessed that is that it

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.810 
to an extent i'm blessed that is that it
just<00:01:27.820> happens<00:01:28.350> maybe<00:01:29.350> you<00:01:29.530> feel<00:01:29.770> that<00:01:30.100> there's

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820 
just happens maybe you feel that there's

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.820 
just happens maybe you feel that there's
an<00:01:30.970> Argentinian<00:01:31.600> player<00:01:31.840> that<00:01:32.230> plays<00:01:32.560> in<00:01:32.770> a

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830 
an Argentinian player that plays in a

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.630 
an Argentinian player that plays in a
similar<00:01:33.190> way<00:01:33.220> to<00:01:33.400> you<00:01:33.820> or<00:01:34.120> you<00:01:34.150> feel<00:01:34.780> that

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
similar way to you or you feel that

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.590 
similar way to you or you feel that
identified<00:01:36.640> but

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600

identified but
so<00:01:39.260> that's<00:01:39.470> an<00:01:39.560> interesting<00:01:39.890> question<00:01:39.979> I<00:01:40.400> I

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
so that's an interesting question I I

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.510 
so that's an interesting question I I
think<00:01:41.150> hockey<00:01:41.689> is<00:01:41.810> a<00:01:41.840> sports<00:01:42.200> that<00:01:42.590> you<00:01:43.310> can

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
think hockey is a sports that you can

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.550 
think hockey is a sports that you can
really<00:01:43.850> express<00:01:44.689> yourself<00:01:45.080> in<00:01:45.290> a<00:01:45.380> very

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
really express yourself in a very

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.100 
really express yourself in a very
individual<00:01:46.009> way<00:01:46.240> Argentina<00:01:47.240> has<00:01:47.330> many<00:01:47.750> great

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
individual way Argentina has many great

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.520 
individual way Argentina has many great
great<00:01:48.380> players<00:01:48.680> as<00:01:49.100> you<00:01:49.130> know<00:01:49.780> so<00:01:50.780> for<00:01:51.259> me<00:01:51.380> to
