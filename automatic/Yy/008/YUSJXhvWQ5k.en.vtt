feel like I'm going to drop it it's got

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.800 
feel like I'm going to drop it it's got
almost<00:03:03.530> a<00:03:03.830> it's<00:03:04.519> smoothing<00:03:05.299> yet<00:03:05.450> it's<00:03:05.599> got<00:03:05.750> a

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
almost a it's smoothing yet it's got a

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.809 
almost a it's smoothing yet it's got a
very<00:03:06.170> fine<00:03:06.890> texture<00:03:07.430> to<00:03:07.670> it

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:07.819 
very fine texture to it

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:10.570 
very fine texture to it
Wow<00:03:08.349> it's<00:03:09.349> pretty<00:03:09.680> thin<00:03:09.950> although<00:03:10.370> it's<00:03:10.489> gonna

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
Wow it's pretty thin although it's gonna

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.009 
Wow it's pretty thin although it's gonna
be<00:03:10.730> thicker<00:03:11.000> than<00:03:11.239> the<00:03:11.360> other<00:03:11.510> devices<00:03:11.840> that

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
be thicker than the other devices that

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:14.530 
be thicker than the other devices that
we're<00:03:12.290> gonna<00:03:12.410> compare<00:03:12.830> this<00:03:12.950> against<00:03:13.540> feels

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
we're gonna compare this against feels

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.509 
we're gonna compare this against feels
like<00:03:14.780> it<00:03:14.930> would<00:03:15.049> make<00:03:15.080> for<00:03:15.590> a<00:03:15.620> very<00:03:15.709> nice<00:03:16.220> phone

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 
like it would make for a very nice phone

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:18.780 
like it would make for a very nice phone
with<00:03:16.760> the<00:03:16.849> chin<00:03:17.090> holding<00:03:18.049> it<00:03:18.140> up<00:03:18.230> to<00:03:18.350> your<00:03:18.410> ear

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
with the chin holding it up to your ear

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.740 
with the chin holding it up to your ear
obviously<00:03:19.790> let's<00:03:19.970> take<00:03:20.150> a<00:03:20.180> look<00:03:20.390> at<00:03:20.450> the<00:03:20.540> hero

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
obviously let's take a look at the hero

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.080 
obviously let's take a look at the hero
compared<00:03:21.200> to<00:03:21.350> other<00:03:21.560> devices<00:03:22.340> so<00:03:22.850> we'll<00:03:22.970> take

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
compared to other devices so we'll take

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.800 
compared to other devices so we'll take
a<00:03:23.150> look<00:03:23.329> at<00:03:23.450> the<00:03:23.570> iPhone<00:03:23.959> first<00:03:25.390> the<00:03:26.390> hero<00:03:26.630> has

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
a look at the iPhone first the hero has

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.259 
a look at the iPhone first the hero has
a<00:03:26.840> much<00:03:27.079> smaller<00:03:27.440> screen<00:03:27.739> than<00:03:27.980> the<00:03:28.070> iPhone<00:03:28.489> in

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
a much smaller screen than the iPhone in

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:30.729 
a much smaller screen than the iPhone in
terms<00:03:29.540> of<00:03:29.720> thickness<00:03:29.989> it's<00:03:30.380> kind<00:03:30.500> of<00:03:30.530> hard<00:03:30.709> to

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
terms of thickness it's kind of hard to

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:32.740 
terms of thickness it's kind of hard to
judge<00:03:30.980> thickness<00:03:31.370> because<00:03:31.609> of<00:03:31.640> the<00:03:31.790> chin<00:03:32.060> but

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
judge thickness because of the chin but

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.599 
judge thickness because of the chin but
it's<00:03:32.900> definitely<00:03:33.170> thicker<00:03:33.769> than<00:03:34.100> the<00:03:34.250> iPhone

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:34.609 
it's definitely thicker than the iPhone

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:37.120 
it's definitely thicker than the iPhone
let's<00:03:35.269> take<00:03:35.510> a<00:03:35.540> look<00:03:35.780> at<00:03:35.870> the<00:03:36.019> new<00:03:36.290> Samsung

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
let's take a look at the new Samsung

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.449 
let's take a look at the new Samsung
omnia<00:03:37.340> 2<00:03:38.230> also<00:03:39.230> has<00:03:39.410> a<00:03:39.620> smaller<00:03:40.010> screen<00:03:40.310> than

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
omnia 2 also has a smaller screen than

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:43.629 
omnia 2 also has a smaller screen than
the<00:03:40.489> omnia<00:03:40.850> 2<00:03:41.060> and<00:03:41.299> is<00:03:42.340> about<00:03:43.340> the<00:03:43.489> same

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:43.639 
the omnia 2 and is about the same

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:45.430 
the omnia 2 and is about the same
thickness<00:03:43.940> a<00:03:44.239> little<00:03:44.510> bit<00:03:44.630> thicker<00:03:44.840> possibly

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
thickness a little bit thicker possibly

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.069 
thickness a little bit thicker possibly
the<00:03:46.250> hero<00:03:46.519> doesn't<00:03:46.850> feel<00:03:47.090> as<00:03:47.329> thick<00:03:47.690> as<00:03:47.870> say

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:48.079 
the hero doesn't feel as thick as say

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:50.110 
the hero doesn't feel as thick as say
the<00:03:48.230> omnia<00:03:48.620> 2<00:03:48.859> because<00:03:49.310> it's<00:03:49.670> got<00:03:49.880> this

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
the omnia 2 because it's got this

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.319 
the omnia 2 because it's got this
tapered<00:03:50.600> edge<00:03:51.160> sort<00:03:52.160> of<00:03:52.310> like<00:03:52.579> the<00:03:52.819> iPhone

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:53.329 
tapered edge sort of like the iPhone

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:55.150 
tapered edge sort of like the iPhone
does<00:03:53.540> let's<00:03:54.410> take<00:03:54.530> a<00:03:54.560> look<00:03:54.799> at<00:03:54.920> how<00:03:55.040> it

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
does let's take a look at how it

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:01.059 
does let's take a look at how it
compares<00:03:55.579> to<00:03:55.700> the<00:03:55.940> HTC<00:03:56.859> Touch<00:03:57.859> HD<00:03:58.209> and<00:04:00.069> there

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:01.069 
compares to the HTC Touch HD and there

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:02.800 
compares to the HTC Touch HD and there
are<00:04:01.160> some<00:04:01.310> similarities<00:04:01.519> between<00:04:02.060> these<00:04:02.389> HTC

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
are some similarities between these HTC

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.960 
are some similarities between these HTC
devices<00:04:03.079> like<00:04:03.440> the<00:04:03.620> speaker<00:04:04.250> girl<00:04:04.579> at<00:04:04.670> the<00:04:04.760> top

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
devices like the speaker girl at the top

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.270 
devices like the speaker girl at the top
with<00:04:05.180> the<00:04:05.209> LED<00:04:05.930> indicator<00:04:06.380> light<00:04:06.470> on<00:04:07.040> either

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
with the LED indicator light on either

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.610 
with the LED indicator light on either
side<00:04:07.639> and<00:04:07.880> in<00:04:08.690> terms<00:04:08.900> of<00:04:09.049> thickness<00:04:09.380> it<00:04:09.590> is

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
side and in terms of thickness it is

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.610 
side and in terms of thickness it is
thicker<00:04:10.190> and<00:04:10.489> finally<00:04:11.420> next<00:04:11.840> to<00:04:12.019> the<00:04:12.170> HTC

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
thicker and finally next to the HTC

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:17.259 
thicker and finally next to the HTC
touch<00:04:12.920> diamond2<00:04:13.510> it's<00:04:14.510> a<00:04:15.549> more<00:04:16.549> wide<00:04:16.880> than<00:04:17.150> the

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:17.269 
touch diamond2 it's a more wide than the

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:18.909 
touch diamond2 it's a more wide than the
touch<00:04:17.450> diamond2<00:04:17.660> if<00:04:18.049> we<00:04:18.139> stack<00:04:18.440> them<00:04:18.650> on<00:04:18.739> one

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:18.919 
touch diamond2 if we stack them on one

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:22.089 
touch diamond2 if we stack them on one
another<00:04:19.190> but<00:04:19.940> in<00:04:20.030> terms<00:04:20.209> of<00:04:20.389> thickness<00:04:21.099> turn

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:22.099 
another but in terms of thickness turn

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:24.219 
another but in terms of thickness turn
it<00:04:22.220> the<00:04:22.280> other<00:04:22.310> way<00:04:22.870> they're<00:04:23.870> actually<00:04:24.140> about

00:04:24.219 --> 00:04:24.229 
it the other way they're actually about

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:26.320 
it the other way they're actually about
the<00:04:24.349> same<00:04:24.530> thickness

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
the same thickness

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.119 
the same thickness
so<00:04:26.629> that's<00:04:26.780> it<00:04:26.900> for<00:04:26.990> the<00:04:27.080> unboxing<00:04:27.199> of<00:04:27.620> the<00:04:27.680> HTC

00:04:28.119 --> 00:04:28.129 
so that's it for the unboxing of the HTC

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:30.339 
so that's it for the unboxing of the HTC
hero<00:04:28.550> really<00:04:28.909> impressed<00:04:29.539> with<00:04:29.810> the<00:04:29.960> new<00:04:30.110> style

00:04:30.339 --> 00:04:30.349
