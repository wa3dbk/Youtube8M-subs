00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
quite sturdy and it's not so easy to

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.680 
quite sturdy and it's not so easy to
pull<00:00:29.789> apart<00:00:29.820> as<00:00:30.359> this<00:00:30.539> one<00:00:30.810> was<00:00:31.640> okay<00:00:32.640> so<00:00:33.300> for

this<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.739> this<00:00:35.010> part<00:00:35.340> of<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.579> sword

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
this and this part of the sword

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.360 
this and this part of the sword
I<00:00:36.270> used<00:00:37.079> foam<00:00:37.469> core<00:00:37.890> which<00:00:38.510> looks<00:00:39.510> like<00:00:39.629> this

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
I used foam core which looks like this

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.270 
I used foam core which looks like this
it's<00:00:41.370> just<00:00:41.399> a<00:00:41.670> scrap<00:00:42.090> from<00:00:42.649> when<00:00:43.649> I<00:00:43.680> was<00:00:43.890> making

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
it's just a scrap from when I was making

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.330 
it's just a scrap from when I was making
it<00:00:44.579> so<00:00:44.940> this<00:00:45.930> it<00:00:46.140> looks<00:00:46.379> like<00:00:46.559> this<00:00:46.829> in<00:00:47.280> the

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
it so this it looks like this in the

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.490 
it so this it looks like this in the
middle<00:00:47.789> is<00:00:48.410> this<00:00:49.430> farm<00:00:50.430> stuff<00:00:51.050> and<00:00:52.050> on<00:00:52.379> the

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
middle is this farm stuff and on the

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.619 
middle is this farm stuff and on the
outside<00:00:52.890> especially<00:00:53.610> like<00:00:54.090> this<00:00:54.239> really

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
outside especially like this really

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.189 
outside especially like this really
tough<00:00:55.020> card<00:00:55.789> so<00:00:56.789> I<00:00:57.329> thought<00:00:57.840> it<00:00:57.930> would<00:00:58.020> be

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
tough card so I thought it would be

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.639 
tough card so I thought it would be
really<00:00:58.500> good<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:59.100> use<00:00:59.340> for<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.449> sword<00:01:01.109> because

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
really good to use for a sword because

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.649 
really good to use for a sword because
it's<00:01:02.030> quite<00:01:03.030> sturdy<00:01:03.390> see<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.880> it<00:01:05.880> weren't

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
it's quite sturdy see and it weren't

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.429 
it's quite sturdy see and it weren't
break<00:01:06.930> so<00:01:07.470> easily<00:01:08.810> but<00:01:09.810> you<00:01:09.960> still<00:01:10.140> have<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.350> be

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
break so easily but you still have to be

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.969 
break so easily but you still have to be
careful<00:01:10.619> with<00:01:10.950> it<00:01:11.100> of<00:01:11.189> course<00:01:11.460> you<00:01:11.820> can't<00:01:12.000> just

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
careful with it of course you can't just

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:16.460 
careful with it of course you can't just
throw<00:01:13.979> it<00:01:14.130> well<00:01:14.310> around<00:01:14.790> and<00:01:15.180> not<00:01:15.960> expected<00:01:16.409> to

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
throw it well around and not expected to

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.350 
throw it well around and not expected to
break<00:01:16.650> it<00:01:16.920> might<00:01:17.159> break<00:01:17.369> I'm<00:01:17.820> not<00:01:18.030> sure<00:01:18.150> sure

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
break it might break I'm not sure sure

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.469 
break it might break I'm not sure sure
but<00:01:19.400> so<00:01:20.400> this<00:01:20.520> is<00:01:20.729> really<00:01:20.939> good

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
but so this is really good

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.320 
but so this is really good
you<00:01:22.229> don't<00:01:22.409> have<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.680> make<00:01:22.950> it<00:01:23.189> out<00:01:23.369> of<00:01:23.400> that<00:01:23.759> if

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
you don't have to make it out of that if

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.230 
you don't have to make it out of that if
you<00:01:24.600> can't<00:01:24.840> find<00:01:25.080> it<00:01:25.290> you<00:01:25.500> know<00:01:25.939> you<00:01:26.939> can't

rest of it so I just gave it a couple of
coats<00:02:19.260> and<00:02:20.010> I<00:02:20.459> actually<00:02:20.700> put<00:02:21.180> Mod<00:02:21.870> Podge<00:02:22.530> Mod

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
coats and I actually put Mod Podge Mod

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:24.280 
coats and I actually put Mod Podge Mod
Podge<00:02:23.250> on<00:02:23.579> it

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
Podge on it

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.770 
Podge on it
just<00:02:25.290> seal<00:02:25.590> it<00:02:25.670> but<00:02:26.670> and<00:02:27.000> then<00:02:27.239> paint<00:02:27.510> it<00:02:27.659> over

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
it so it kind of made it easier to paint

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:39.649 
it so it kind of made it easier to paint
on<00:02:33.599> actually<00:02:34.849> and<00:02:35.849> then<00:02:37.310> pop<00:02:38.310> glued<00:02:38.609> it<00:02:38.819> to

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:39.659 
on actually and then pop glued it to

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:43.699 
on actually and then pop glued it to
this<00:02:40.170> rest<00:02:40.620> of<00:02:40.859> this<00:02:41.010> stuff<00:02:41.720> so<00:02:42.720> this<00:02:43.319> is<00:02:43.530> what

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
this rest of this stuff so this is what

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:51.190 
this rest of this stuff so this is what
the<00:02:43.859> handle<00:02:44.340> looks<00:02:44.549> like<00:02:49.549> it's<00:02:50.549> officially

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
the handle looks like it's officially

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.869 
the handle looks like it's officially
stuck<00:02:52.200> together<00:02:52.409> all<00:02:53.129> of<00:02:53.310> it<00:02:53.430> stuck<00:02:53.700> together

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:53.879 
stuck together all of it stuck together

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:59.990 
stuck together all of it stuck together
with<00:02:54.090> hot<00:02:54.540> glue<00:02:56.239> as<00:02:57.239> you<00:02:57.299> can<00:02:57.540> see<00:02:57.900> in<00:02:58.170> there<00:02:59.000> so

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
with hot glue as you can see in there so

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.319 
with hot glue as you can see in there so
this<00:03:00.180> part<00:03:00.629> is<00:03:00.959> part<00:03:01.920> of<00:03:02.069> the<00:03:02.250> original<00:03:02.459> sword

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
this part is part of the original sword

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:06.020 
this part is part of the original sword
the<00:03:03.720> foam<00:03:03.930> sword<00:03:04.260> so<00:03:04.859> up<00:03:05.129> there<00:03:05.370> you<00:03:05.700> can<00:03:05.819> see

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
the foam sword so up there you can see

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.800 
the foam sword so up there you can see
where<00:03:06.269> this<00:03:06.420> originally<00:03:07.290> was<00:03:08.420> so<00:03:09.420> I<00:03:09.510> just

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
where this originally was so I just

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.780 
where this originally was so I just
pulled<00:03:10.290> it<00:03:10.439> down<00:03:10.470> a<00:03:10.680> bit<00:03:10.829> and<00:03:13.400> made<00:03:14.400> the<00:03:14.519> handle

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
pulled it down a bit and made the handle

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.939 
pulled it down a bit and made the handle
longer<00:03:15.239> for<00:03:16.109> the<00:03:16.230> bottom<00:03:16.560> I<00:03:16.739> made<00:03:18.829> it's<00:03:19.829> a

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:19.949 
longer for the bottom I made it's a

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:23.330 
longer for the bottom I made it's a
pyramid<00:03:20.280> type<00:03:20.639> shape<00:03:20.970> out<00:03:21.239> of<00:03:21.440> the<00:03:22.440> same<00:03:22.680> stuff

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
pyramid type shape out of the same stuff

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.979 
pyramid type shape out of the same stuff
fine<00:03:24.090> cool<00:03:24.389> and<00:03:26.000> you<00:03:27.000> can<00:03:27.150> kind<00:03:27.419> of<00:03:27.510> see<00:03:27.780> where

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
fine cool and you can kind of see where

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:32.420 
fine cool and you can kind of see where
I<00:03:28.019> cut<00:03:28.500> it<00:03:29.810> but<00:03:30.810> it<00:03:31.319> still<00:03:31.829> works<00:03:32.010> pretty<00:03:32.280> well

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
I cut it but it still works pretty well

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.899 
I cut it but it still works pretty well
I<00:03:32.940> decide<00:03:33.900> to<00:03:33.930> use<00:03:34.079> like<00:03:34.470> a<00:03:34.500> hot<00:03:34.859> pink<00:03:35.220> for<00:03:35.790> the

00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:35.909 
I decide to use like a hot pink for the

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:40.339 
I decide to use like a hot pink for the
color<00:03:36.260> so<00:03:37.260> be<00:03:37.470> more<00:03:37.769> like<00:03:38.959> be<00:03:39.959> more<00:03:40.169> of<00:03:40.260> a

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:40.349 
color so be more like be more of a

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:42.979 
color so be more like be more of a
contrast<00:03:40.949> in<00:03:41.310> I<00:03:41.579> think<00:03:42.090> in<00:03:42.329> this<00:03:42.479> show<00:03:42.720> it's

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
contrast in I think in this show it's

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.729 
contrast in I think in this show it's
more<00:03:43.199> of<00:03:43.349> a<00:03:43.440> baby<00:03:43.709> pink<00:03:44.750> but<00:03:45.750> I<00:03:45.989> think<00:03:46.319> it<00:03:46.409> still

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
more of a baby pink but I think it still

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:48.199 
more of a baby pink but I think it still
looks<00:03:46.979> pretty<00:03:47.159> good

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
looks pretty good

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:54.259 
looks pretty good
I<00:03:51.290> haven't<00:03:52.290> glazed<00:03:52.769> it<00:03:53.190> at<00:03:53.400> all<00:03:53.579> yet

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
I haven't glazed it at all yet

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:57.800 
I haven't glazed it at all yet
which<00:03:55.019> I<00:03:55.169> thought<00:03:55.470> I<00:03:55.500> might<00:03:55.949> but<00:03:56.699> I'm<00:03:57.449> not<00:03:57.599> too

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
which I thought I might but I'm not too

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.839 
which I thought I might but I'm not too
sure<00:03:58.079> I<00:03:59.000> might<00:04:00.000> just<00:04:00.209> leave<00:04:00.449> it<00:04:00.629> as<00:04:00.870> it<00:04:01.049> is<00:04:01.849> but

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:02.849 
sure I might just leave it as it is but

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:06.349 
sure I might just leave it as it is but
yeah<00:04:03.859> you<00:04:04.859> can<00:04:05.129> glaze<00:04:05.459> them<00:04:05.819> if<00:04:05.940> you<00:04:06.120> want

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:06.359 
yeah you can glaze them if you want

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:11.059 
yeah you can glaze them if you want
because<00:04:07.040> it<00:04:08.040> would<00:04:08.250> look<00:04:08.489> nice<00:04:09.620> it's<00:04:10.620> kinda<00:04:11.010> I

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:11.069 
because it would look nice it's kinda I

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:13.069 
because it would look nice it's kinda I
think<00:04:11.280> it's<00:04:11.400> shiny<00:04:11.699> enough<00:04:11.909> as<00:04:12.269> it<00:04:12.449> is<00:04:12.479> because

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079 
think it's shiny enough as it is because

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:15.399 
think it's shiny enough as it is because
the<00:04:13.319> paint<00:04:13.560> I<00:04:13.680> used<00:04:13.889> was<00:04:14.099> quite<00:04:14.370> cheap<00:04:14.609> so

00:04:15.399 --> 00:04:15.409 
the paint I used was quite cheap so

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:18.189 
the paint I used was quite cheap so
cheap<00:04:16.409> painted<00:04:16.739> shiny<00:04:16.919> paints<00:04:17.430> that<00:04:17.489> are<00:04:17.669> here

00:04:18.189 --> 00:04:18.199 
cheap painted shiny paints that are here

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:22.459 
cheap painted shiny paints that are here
so<00:04:19.199> this<00:04:19.349> basically<00:04:19.799> in<00:04:20.130> comparison<00:04:20.820> so<00:04:21.469> I

00:04:22.459 --> 00:04:22.469 
so this basically in comparison so I

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:25.640 
so this basically in comparison so I
think<00:04:22.919> I've<00:04:23.190> done<00:04:23.370> pretty<00:04:23.669> well<00:04:24.120> on<00:04:24.900> a<00:04:25.020> sword

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
think I've done pretty well on a sword

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:31.620 
think I've done pretty well on a sword
my<00:04:26.650> sword<00:04:27.010> is<00:04:27.340> just<00:04:27.670> long<00:04:28.000> bit<00:04:28.420> longer<00:04:28.690> I<00:04:30.630> saw

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
my sword is just long bit longer I saw

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.900 
my sword is just long bit longer I saw
it's<00:04:31.810> just<00:04:32.110> a<00:04:32.380> little<00:04:32.650> bit<00:04:32.890> longer<00:04:33.190> and

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
it's just a little bit longer and

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.910 
it's just a little bit longer and
finning<00:04:34.510> sword<00:04:35.760> as<00:04:36.760> you<00:04:36.940> can<00:04:37.120> see<00:04:37.540> but<00:04:38.260> I<00:04:38.530> think

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:38.920 
finning sword as you can see but I think

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:42.060 
finning sword as you can see but I think
I've<00:04:39.040> done<00:04:39.250> really<00:04:39.700> well<00:04:40.210> I<00:04:40.830> think<00:04:41.830> the

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
I've done really well I think the

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.310 
I've done really well I think the
handles<00:04:42.490> are<00:04:42.640> actually<00:04:43.000> quite<00:04:43.480> around<00:04:44.140> the

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.320 
handles are actually quite around the

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.950 
handles are actually quite around the
same<00:04:44.620> size
