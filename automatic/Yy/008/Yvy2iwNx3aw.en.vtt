00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
DOE rec and strength conditioning the

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.660 
DOE rec and strength conditioning the
strength<00:01:40.410> of<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.619> training<00:01:41.010> what<00:01:41.160> I<00:01:41.190> mean<00:01:41.460> by

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
strength of the training what I mean by

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.120 
strength of the training what I mean by
this<00:01:41.729> is<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.930> facts<00:01:43.229> what<00:01:43.619> if<00:01:43.800> you<00:01:43.920> have<00:01:44.100> a

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
this is the facts what if you have a

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.660 
this is the facts what if you have a
look<00:01:44.400> is<00:01:45.119> poor<00:01:45.479> sets<00:01:45.930> but<00:01:46.740> they're<00:01:47.010> relatively

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
look is poor sets but they're relatively

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.140 
look is poor sets but they're relatively
low<00:01:48.180> reps<00:01:48.900> right<00:01:49.440> so<00:01:49.860> for<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.130> first<00:01:50.340> set<00:01:50.760> is

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.150 
low reps right so for the first set is

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.190 
low reps right so for the first set is
for<00:01:51.450> X<00:01:51.690> then<00:01:52.590> floor<00:01:53.100> ups<00:01:53.280> again<00:01:53.670> then<00:01:54.450> two<00:01:54.930> reps

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
for X then floor ups again then two reps

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.219 
for X then floor ups again then two reps
and<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:56.010> third<00:01:56.280> set<00:01:56.700> then<00:01:57.479> two<00:01:57.780> reps<00:01:57.990> for<00:01:58.200> the

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
and the third set then two reps for the

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.310 
and the third set then two reps for the
last<00:01:58.530> set<00:01:58.860> as<00:01:59.010> well<00:01:59.250> so<00:01:59.760> two<00:02:00.150> reps<00:02:00.479> from<00:02:01.050> four

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
last set as well so two reps from four

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.770 
last set as well so two reps from four
reps<00:02:01.530> means<00:02:01.860> that<00:02:02.070> you<00:02:02.190> need<00:02:02.369> to<00:02:02.490> increase<00:02:02.940> the

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
reps means that you need to increase the

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.529 
reps means that you need to increase the
weight<00:02:04.259> that<00:02:04.500> you're<00:02:04.649> doing<00:02:05.300> because<00:02:06.300> you're

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:06.539 
weight that you're doing because you're

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:08.960 
weight that you're doing because you're
only<00:02:06.660> gonna<00:02:06.869> be<00:02:07.110> doing<00:02:07.380> two<00:02:07.619> reps<00:02:07.920> okay<00:02:08.820> and

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
only gonna be doing two reps okay and

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.480 
only gonna be doing two reps okay and
you<00:02:09.060> do<00:02:09.300> this<00:02:09.600> because<00:02:10.350> the<00:02:10.679> conditions<00:02:11.280> for

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
you do this because the conditions for

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.520 
you do this because the conditions for
strength<00:02:11.850> is<00:02:12.120> direct<00:02:12.840> through<00:02:13.050> strength

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
strength is direct through strength

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.190 
strength is direct through strength
training<00:02:13.850> and<00:02:14.850> that's<00:02:15.540> what<00:02:15.750> I<00:02:15.780> like<00:02:16.050> about

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
training and that's what I like about

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.070 
training and that's what I like about
this<00:02:16.440> workout<00:02:16.890> you<00:02:17.640> will<00:02:17.880> be<00:02:18.120> increasing<00:02:18.960> the

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
this workout you will be increasing the

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.130 
this workout you will be increasing the
strength<00:02:19.380> of<00:02:19.590> your<00:02:19.950> legs<00:02:20.330> so<00:02:21.330> another<00:02:21.870> thing<00:02:21.960> I

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
strength of your legs so another thing I

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.830 
strength of your legs so another thing I
like<00:02:22.380> about<00:02:22.410> this<00:02:22.890> is<00:02:23.250> all<00:02:24.060> the<00:02:24.120> sets<00:02:24.540> and<00:02:24.690> all

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
like about this is all the sets and all

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.660 
like about this is all the sets and all
the<00:02:24.930> repetitions<00:02:26.120> are<00:02:27.120> ideal<00:02:27.480> for<00:02:27.570> the<00:02:28.230> legs

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
the repetitions are ideal for the legs

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.840 
the repetitions are ideal for the legs
development<00:02:30.680> this<00:02:31.680> is<00:02:31.740> a<00:02:31.950> workout<00:02:32.400> that<00:02:32.640> I

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
development this is a workout that I

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.150 
development this is a workout that I
would<00:02:33.330> be<00:02:33.480> doing<00:02:33.630> this<00:02:33.930> is<00:02:34.140> very<00:02:34.710> similar<00:02:35.040> to

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
would be doing this is very similar to

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.980 
would be doing this is very similar to
the<00:02:35.250> workouts<00:02:35.550> that<00:02:35.700> I<00:02:35.880> do<00:02:35.940> things<00:02:36.510> I<00:02:36.750> probably

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
the workouts that I do things I probably

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.520 
the workouts that I do things I probably
don't<00:02:37.470> like<00:02:37.800> about<00:02:38.040> this<00:02:38.190> workout<00:02:38.640> is

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
don't like about this workout is

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.460 
don't like about this workout is
probably<00:02:40.530> the<00:02:41.370> carp<00:02:41.760> raisers<00:02:42.360> is<00:02:42.870> only<00:02:43.050> four

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
probably the carp raisers is only four

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:49.340 
probably the carp raisers is only four
sets<00:02:43.830> of<00:02:44.370> 12<00:02:44.730> reps<00:02:45.920> the<00:02:46.920> card<00:02:47.280> I<00:02:47.670> prefer<00:02:48.300> to<00:02:48.900> hit

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
sets of 12 reps the card I prefer to hit

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.990 
sets of 12 reps the card I prefer to hit
them<00:02:49.500> up<00:02:49.650> a<00:02:49.830> lot<00:02:50.190> more<00:02:51.740> even<00:02:52.740> so<00:02:53.280> far<00:02:53.520> to<00:02:53.670> go<00:02:53.819> as

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
them up a lot more even so far to go as

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.690 
them up a lot more even so far to go as
say<00:02:54.450> eight

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
say eight

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.570 
say eight
well<00:02:56.330> since<00:02:56.870> easy<00:02:57.440> the<00:02:57.770> cards<00:02:58.130> are<00:02:58.280> pretty

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
well since easy the cards are pretty

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.830 
well since easy the cards are pretty
stubborn<00:02:59.270> bastards<00:03:01.209> they<00:03:02.209> can<00:03:02.360> take<00:03:02.540> a<00:03:02.569> lot

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
stubborn bastards they can take a lot

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.729 
stubborn bastards they can take a lot
more<00:03:04.150> so<00:03:05.150> I<00:03:05.180> would<00:03:05.690> prefer<00:03:06.050> to<00:03:06.080> see<00:03:06.319> a<00:03:06.349> lot<00:03:06.560> more

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
more so I would prefer to see a lot more

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:09.940 
more so I would prefer to see a lot more
hard<00:03:07.520> work<00:03:08.150> having<00:03:08.840> a<00:03:08.930> look<00:03:09.050> at<00:03:09.530> everything
