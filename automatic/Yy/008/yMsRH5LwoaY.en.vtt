the<00:04:08.370> reason<00:04:08.610> why<00:04:08.700> they're<00:04:08.850> able<00:04:08.940> to<00:04:09.060> do<00:04:09.180> this

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
the reason why they're able to do this

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:10.580 
the reason why they're able to do this
is<00:04:09.450> because<00:04:09.570> they're<00:04:09.840> able<00:04:09.959> to<00:04:10.049> make<00:04:10.200> each<00:04:10.350> and

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
is because they're able to make each and

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:11.949 
is because they're able to make each and
every<00:04:10.739> movement<00:04:10.980> each<00:04:11.280> and<00:04:11.340> every<00:04:11.549> part

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
every movement each and every part

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:14.180 
every movement each and every part
conceptually<00:04:12.959> interesting<00:04:13.620> even<00:04:13.860> the<00:04:13.950> parts

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
conceptually interesting even the parts

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:15.530 
conceptually interesting even the parts
where<00:04:14.340> they're<00:04:14.489> just<00:04:14.519> kind<00:04:14.850> of<00:04:14.940> doing<00:04:15.360> that

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
where they're just kind of doing that

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.390 
where they're just kind of doing that
metal<00:04:15.840> gaze<00:04:16.019> idea<00:04:16.320> that<00:04:16.500> shoegaze<00:04:16.919> metal<00:04:17.220> gaze
