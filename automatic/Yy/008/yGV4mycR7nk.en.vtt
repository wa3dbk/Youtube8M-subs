00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:06.700
 hello good today I'm going to teach you how to do 

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:09.549
 this cute in watermelon is very simple 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:11.679
 and well I want to dedicate it to this 

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:14.789
 girl who told me to dedicate my 

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:16.990
 video so good more for her 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:19.840
 we need to place the loom of this 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:22.289
 ok way let's start with the 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:25.800
 green gummies 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:30.359
 on the edge we take three green gummies 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:33.329
 and we put them for example from here da 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.309
 same where do you start? 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.780
 because we're not going to make it very big and 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.750
 you want to make it bigger 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:43.429
 they make it longer 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.429
 we take so many more 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.350
 of the greens are going to be all the time to 

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:52.350
 through voucher 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.970
 Well, I take this opportunity to tell you that 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:05.360
 subscribe to my channel to write me 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:07.160
 with any doubt or question and good 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.650
 if you want me to do something to you 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:12.160
 special or something you tell me and I 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.160
 tried 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.810
 now that we have finished with the greens 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:24.310
 we have to put the red ones 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:26.979
 and the nuggets we are going to put them now 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:29.290
 it depends on what you want to do, I have 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:32.729
 put 25 but good if you want 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:37.240
 put more or less yours according to you 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:40.210
 we take a black rubber band we give it 4 or 5 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:44.700
 turns that are tight 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.700
 and now we take two red gummies 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.290
 and we had it 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:55.060
 and we leave it aside for later 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:02:00.780
 place it and I already have all my chips 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:04.310
 Well, let's go fill the watermelon 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.470
 and we are going to intersperse these rubber bands 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.939
 it is worth for example we put two 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.939
 red gummies from here 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:20.769
 here here and now for example I'm going to 

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:23.129
 so put a nugget is lame 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:26.200
 two sides leaving the black rubber in the middle 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:28.950
 and I put it like gummies 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.950
 normal 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.590
 well then we have to go doing it 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.300
 all 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.300
 putting each one to your liking 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.930
 let's go to the bottom 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.700
 it is now that we have filled the part 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:36.790
 red we have to put red gummies 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:40.469
 to join the braids 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.469
 well doing triangles 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:01.980
 now we put in the latter a bomb 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:06.080
 green to make our knot nothing the 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.080
 back 16 times 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:16.459
 ok since we would only miss 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.459
 think everything 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:21.400
 ok we start thinking the greens 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:33.990
 to then go forward in the 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.990
 red 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:54.620
 once twisted this line here 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:57.020
 let's go forward 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:59.330
 so in parallel you still do not finish that 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:01.280
 is here because if not hope not 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:03.830
 they will catch this the last thing is done 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:06.500
 first we do the part of the knot and 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:10.750
 we do the parallel attention and by 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.750
 last we tensed this part 

00:05:58.529 --> 00:06:05.939
 think about all this you have to think this 

00:06:03.249 --> 00:06:05.939
 line here 

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:24.430
 ok here we passed our hook 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:26.910
 taking all the gums we take a 

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:26.910
 green rubber 

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:32.760
 and we pass it up and now we do 

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:34.700
 a knot consisting of passing a rubber band 

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:37.100
 inside the other 

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:40.630
 and look at the now is the most fun 

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:40.630
 what is to release everything 

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:07.370
 Well, this week has been our 

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:09.650
 watermelon 

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:12.260
 now you just have to place the 

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:14.690
 rubber bands stretch 

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:16.460
 Well, here's the video today 

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:18.430
