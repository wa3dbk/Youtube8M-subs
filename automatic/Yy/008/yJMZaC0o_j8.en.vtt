this at Toy Fair but I didn't get to
build<00:02:00.910> it<00:02:01.060> I<00:02:01.210> will<00:02:01.420> actually<00:02:01.780> want<00:02:01.960> to<00:02:02.020> build

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:02.260

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.730 
build it I will actually want to build
this<00:02:02.530> set<00:02:02.830> this<00:02:03.600> Evan<00:02:04.600> said<00:02:04.870> he<00:02:05.110> want<00:02:05.410> to<00:02:05.500> build

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.270 
this set this Evan said he want to build
it<00:02:07.170> so<00:02:08.170> I<00:02:08.200> guess<00:02:08.410> I'll<00:02:08.560> have<00:02:08.709> to<00:02:08.770> find<00:02:08.979> another

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
it so I guess I'll have to find another

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.460 
it so I guess I'll have to find another
set<00:02:09.520> though<00:02:09.790> maybe<00:02:09.970> I'll<00:02:10.179> build<00:02:10.360> that<00:02:10.540> a<00:02:10.869> TTE

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
set though maybe I'll build that a TTE

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.530 
set though maybe I'll build that a TTE
that<00:02:11.890> Evan<00:02:12.190> never<00:02:12.400> built<00:02:12.760> so<00:02:13.060> how<00:02:13.120> many<00:02:13.240> bags
