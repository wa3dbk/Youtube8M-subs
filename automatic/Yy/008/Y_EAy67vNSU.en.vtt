00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.240
 defender galé o 4 3 3 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.939
 beauty this information I leave the ibra and 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.570

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:42.240
 puts there in the middle as second striker 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:44.549
 matuidi I leave it as mlg or e 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.869
 sock link with the bay also thiago 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:51.000
 motta steering wheel maxsuel lateral ee 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.040
 I do not know if it 's a milestone I do not know 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.500
 who is david chelsea luis is the 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.909
 marquinhos side beauty guys we 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:02.130
 there then for what matters the galley 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.049
 if you want to make the video there and copy 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.180
 I really liked it because it's a team of 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.730
 a lot of speed and long balls so the 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.830
 What matters is here 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:13.010
 the instruction of the offensive style team 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.480
 against attack because as I look 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.310
 human being is a team that stays playing 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.590
 A lot of the ball he picks up the ball comes out in 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.580
 speed released forced it is so 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.190
 it works 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.200
 provocative long pass in the area of 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:27.310
 also use the tips one 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:30.020
 little tip players 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:33.830
 keep positioning because it is not much 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:35.630
 cool you keep trading positions 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.820
 because you are going to launch the 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.980
 ball pro ibra hair and brown in front 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:42.200
 or are you accustomed to it there? 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.000
 in the middle of the march is not legal 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.240
 guys then put it on keep 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.700
 the scope of support did not change much 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.680
 I did not put too many players 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.470
 close to not leave their positions 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:57.470
 You're going to throw that one in the truth. 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.420
 play ball in long pass is not good 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.920
 attack numbers I put up medium only for 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.260
 those players who are above the 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:08.090
 line of the field the meat is so 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:10.850
 in the defensive part is style retranca 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.220
 The opinion galera maintains one of the best 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.030
 defenses néné claro is david luiz and thiago 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.800
 silva 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.209
 but it is good to play a little bit 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:22.400
 because it does not have a lot of speed 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:24.170
 To go back to is how to talk is to put it back. 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.110
 the team in ninth defensive position then 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:30.500
 place the boom area that counts 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:32.570
 restraint puts you wide and 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:36.860
 people can be aggressive 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:38.420
 lost ball squeezed to take is the ball 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.610
 of the opposing team defensive line I 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.350
 I put very low step not leaving a 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:45.110
 line to the producer a ball in the 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:47.090
 back and the density I put so 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:50.420
 more or less, it does not leave a thing nor 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:53.360
 A lot or a little, so folks, this is the 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:55.310
 my training here in defense in numbers 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.930
 I put a lot of it, I always defended it. 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:00.110
 I put a lot to defend the maximum of 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:02.690
 players possible, ok then guys 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:05.570
 I hope you have enjoyed it and July is 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:07.400
 fight again for your comment I 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:09.980
 I did it quickly here because I already 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.910
 I leave it mounted, but test and Julius Caesar 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:16.609
 send people you think remember 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:18.650
 10 requires patience and training 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:21.030
 it's not everyone who plays no use 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:23.280
 you pick ball trying to dribble 23 not 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:26.100
 use the puzzle formation and 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:29.310

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:32.639
