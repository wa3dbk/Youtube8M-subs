down straight on it guitar is a vintage

00:00:54.649 --> 00:01:04.680 
down straight on it guitar is a vintage
strap<00:00:55.649> copy

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:04.690 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.810 

straight<00:01:05.690> into<00:01:05.870> an<00:01:05.960> alternate<00:01:06.500> error<00:01:06.710> so<00:01:07.250> just

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
straight into an alternate error so just

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.050 
straight into an alternate error so just
to<00:01:07.910> show<00:01:08.120> you<00:01:08.150> that<00:01:08.450> everything's<00:01:09.400> stock<00:01:10.400> you

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
to show you that everything's stock you

to show you that everything's stock you
know<00:01:11.210> all<00:01:11.450> normal<00:01:11.870> stuff<00:01:12.110> nothing<00:01:12.320> modified

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:12.800 
know all normal stuff nothing modified

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.770 
know all normal stuff nothing modified
or<00:01:12.920> anything<00:01:13.070> like<00:01:13.280> that<00:01:13.340> and<00:01:13.670> let's<00:01:14.510> clean<00:01:14.750> it

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
or anything like that and let's clean it

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:40.290 
or anything like that and let's clean it
on<00:01:14.990> this<00:01:15.470> is<00:01:15.650> a<00:01:15.920> wrap

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.300 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.010 

so<00:01:41.300> basically<00:01:41.630> what<00:01:42.290> this<00:01:42.380> does<00:01:42.440> when<00:01:42.710> it's<00:01:42.830> in

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
so basically what this does when it's in

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.560 
so basically what this does when it's in
I'll<00:01:45.020> tell<00:01:45.170> you<00:01:45.860> straight<00:01:46.310> from<00:01:46.340> no<00:01:47.210> you<00:01:47.390> can

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
I'll tell you straight from no you can

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.660 
I'll tell you straight from no you can
see<00:01:48.790> just<00:01:49.790> off<00:01:50.000> the<00:01:50.119> screen<00:01:50.390> up<00:01:50.540> here<00:01:51.490> you<00:01:52.490> take

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
see just off the screen up here you take

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.690 
see just off the screen up here you take
a<00:01:52.729> daisy-chain<00:01:53.500> power<00:01:54.500> supply<00:01:54.830> power<00:01:55.430> supply

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
a daisy-chain power supply power supply

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.370 
a daisy-chain power supply power supply
goes<00:01:55.880> straight<00:01:56.090> into<00:01:56.300> that<00:01:56.540> and<00:01:57.020> there's<00:01:57.290> a

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
goes straight into that and there's a

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:58.870 
goes straight into that and there's a
channel<00:01:57.740> to<00:01:58.070> the<00:01:58.190> wrap<00:01:58.369> and<00:01:58.580> the<00:01:58.670> tube

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
channel to the wrap and the tube

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.399 
channel to the wrap and the tube
screamer<00:01:59.000> and<00:01:59.509> then<00:01:59.840> you<00:01:59.900> just<00:02:00.080> connect<00:02:00.350> to

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
screamer and then you just connect to

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:01.800 
screamer and then you just connect to
your<00:02:00.500> pedals<00:02:00.770> like<00:02:00.890> you<00:02:01.009> normally<00:02:01.190> would

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
your pedals like you normally would

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.060 
your pedals like you normally would
now<00:02:02.810> all<00:02:03.020> it<00:02:03.140> does<00:02:03.289> is<00:02:03.470> it<00:02:03.500> reduces<00:02:03.710> the

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
now all it does is it reduces the

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.070 
now all it does is it reduces the
voltage<00:02:04.220> to<00:02:04.580> the<00:02:04.670> circuit<00:02:05.119> in<00:02:05.630> LA

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
voltage to the circuit in LA

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.779 
voltage to the circuit in LA
years<00:02:06.500> ago<00:02:06.649> people<00:02:06.770> used<00:02:07.250> to<00:02:07.369> put<00:02:07.550> dead

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:07.789 
years ago people used to put dead

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:09.550 
years ago people used to put dead
batteries<00:02:08.179> and<00:02:08.360> things<00:02:08.780> like<00:02:08.899> that<00:02:08.959> in<00:02:09.229> pedals

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.100 
starts to break up this one doesn't and
a<00:02:34.130> bit<00:02:34.790> further<00:02:34.940> than<00:02:35.150> this<00:02:35.269> one<00:02:35.480> so<00:02:35.510> and<00:02:36.019> I've

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
a bit further than this one so and I've

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:37.900 
a bit further than this one so and I've
tried<00:02:36.230> it<00:02:36.380> weird<00:02:36.530> being<00:02:36.650> off<00:02:36.920> a<00:02:37.190> couple<00:02:37.790> of

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
tried it weird being off a couple of

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.430 
tried it weird being off a couple of
other<00:02:38.120> pedals<00:02:38.420> so<00:02:38.540> it<00:02:38.630> is<00:02:38.690> different<00:02:38.959> with

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
other pedals so it is different with

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.740 
other pedals so it is different with
different<00:02:39.470> pedals<00:02:40.010> and<00:02:40.340> so<00:02:41.000> as<00:02:41.090> that<00:02:41.299> set<00:02:41.600> now

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
different pedals and so as that set now

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.199 
different pedals and so as that set now
it's<00:02:41.930> just<00:02:42.110> done<00:02:42.230> normal<00:02:42.590> voltage<00:02:43.030> it<00:02:44.030> goes

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
it's just done normal voltage it goes

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.080 
it's just done normal voltage it goes
all<00:02:44.510> the<00:02:44.540> way<00:02:44.630> around<00:02:45.220> to<00:02:46.220> it<00:02:46.370> basically<00:02:46.610> coin

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
all the way around to it basically coin

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:52.569 
all the way around to it basically coin
there<00:02:47.360> supply<00:02:47.750> off<00:02:48.250> so<00:02:49.250> if<00:02:49.640> we<00:02:49.820> start<00:02:51.579> normal

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:52.579 
there supply off so if we start normal

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:59.780 
there supply off so if we start normal
voltage

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.700 

it<00:03:00.790> cuts<00:03:01.120> off<00:03:01.330> and<00:03:01.840> then<00:03:02.020> you'll<00:03:02.290> start

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:02.710 
it cuts off and then you'll start

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:05.370 
it cuts off and then you'll start
squelching<00:03:03.430> isin<00:03:03.730> need<00:03:04.720> to<00:03:04.810> compensate<00:03:05.080> way

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
squelching isin need to compensate way

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.430 
squelching isin need to compensate way
bit<00:03:05.560> more<00:03:05.740> volume

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:04:26.800 

probably<00:03:09.220> not<00:03:09.540> velcro<00:03:10.540> a<00:03:10.660> four<00:03:10.930> star<00:03:11.170> please

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.390 

so<00:04:27.810> all<00:04:28.110> happens<00:04:28.440> if<00:04:28.530> you<00:04:28.590> push<00:04:28.800> it<00:04:28.950> too<00:04:29.100> far<00:04:29.130> it

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
so all happens if you push it too far it

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.080 
so all happens if you push it too far it
will<00:04:29.730> cut<00:04:30.360> power<00:04:30.600> off

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
will cut power off

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:51.709 
will cut power off
bring<00:04:33.090> it<00:04:33.180> back<00:04:33.360> in<00:04:33.510> slowly

00:04:51.709 --> 00:04:51.719 

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:57.629 

yeah<00:04:52.719> that's<00:04:52.990> the<00:04:53.139> rap<00:04:56.250> it's<00:04:57.250> pretty<00:04:57.520> much

00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:57.639 
yeah that's the rap it's pretty much

00:04:57.639 --> 00:04:59.610 
yeah that's the rap it's pretty much
about<00:04:57.789> normal<00:04:58.240> just<00:04:58.389> there<00:04:58.599> so<00:04:59.229> I<00:04:59.289> said<00:04:59.530> you

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
about normal just there so I said you

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:00.659 
about normal just there so I said you
can<00:04:59.770> when<00:04:59.860> you're<00:04:59.919> pretty<00:05:00.099> round<00:05:00.310> so<00:05:00.430> luck<00:05:00.580> to

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:00.669 
can when you're pretty round so luck to

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:43.559 
can when you're pretty round so luck to
overclock

00:05:43.559 --> 00:05:43.569 

00:05:43.569 --> 00:05:46.239 

so<00:05:44.569> yeah<00:05:44.719> it's<00:05:44.990> about<00:05:45.169> it<00:05:45.319> really<00:05:45.439> it's<00:05:46.069> not

00:05:46.239 --> 00:05:46.249 
so yeah it's about it really it's not

00:05:46.249 --> 00:05:49.089 
so yeah it's about it really it's not
something<00:05:46.580> that<00:05:46.729> you'd<00:05:46.819> probably<00:05:47.029> use<00:05:48.099> live

00:05:49.089 --> 00:05:49.099 
something that you'd probably use live

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:50.850 
something that you'd probably use live
in<00:05:49.610> a<00:05:49.729> band<00:05:49.939> or<00:05:50.059> anything<00:05:50.240> like<00:05:50.479> that<00:05:50.509> but

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:50.860 
in a band or anything like that but

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:53.589 
in a band or anything like that but
messing<00:05:51.860> around<00:05:51.949> in<00:05:52.159> your<00:05:52.249> bedroom<00:05:52.580> it's<00:05:53.389> a

00:05:53.589 --> 00:05:53.599 
messing around in your bedroom it's a

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:55.899 
messing around in your bedroom it's a
it's<00:05:54.169> a<00:05:54.259> bit<00:05:54.409> of<00:05:54.469> a<00:05:54.529> laugh<00:05:54.710> trying<00:05:55.009> to<00:05:55.099> get<00:05:55.789> new

00:05:55.899 --> 00:05:55.909 
it's a bit of a laugh trying to get new

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:58.209 
it's a bit of a laugh trying to get new

00:05:58.209 --> 00:05:58.219 
sounds out of all the pedals see if

00:05:58.219 --> 00:05:59.499 
sounds out of all the pedals see if
anybody<00:05:58.520> wants<00:05:58.699> anything<00:05:58.819> for<00:05:59.089> anything<00:05:59.270> like
