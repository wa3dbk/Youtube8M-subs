let's<00:01:55.619> say<00:01:55.890> computer<00:01:56.490> screen<00:01:57.000> with<00:01:57.329> take

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
let's say computer screen with take

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.440 
let's say computer screen with take
charge<00:01:58.619> okay<00:01:59.840> now

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
charge okay now

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.279 
charge okay now
let's<00:02:03.409> do<00:02:03.590> the<00:02:03.770> maths<00:02:04.450> so<00:02:05.450> if<00:02:05.600> you<00:02:05.750> all<00:02:06.020> make

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:06.289 
let's do the maths so if you all make

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:09.309 
let's do the maths so if you all make
this<00:02:06.560> at<00:02:06.860> home<00:02:07.130> make<00:02:07.820> sure<00:02:07.880> you<00:02:08.269> cut<00:02:08.599> out<00:02:08.810> a<00:02:08.840> box

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
this at home make sure you cut out a box

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:14.350 
this at home make sure you cut out a box
and<00:02:10.099> write<00:02:10.910> the<00:02:11.120> keys<00:02:11.480> and<00:02:12.290> I<00:02:12.920> get<00:02:13.459> them<00:02:13.670> it<00:02:14.060> get

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
and write the keys and I get them it get

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.540 
and write the keys and I get them it get
something<00:02:14.810> to<00:02:14.989> decorate<00:02:15.260> and<00:02:16.010> put<00:02:16.340> some

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
something to decorate and put some

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.900 
something to decorate and put some
pictures<00:02:16.790> on<00:02:17.239> the<00:02:17.420> screen<00:02:17.780> and<00:02:18.230> five<00:02:19.099> mouse

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
pictures on the screen and five mouse

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.500 
pictures on the screen and five mouse
all<00:02:20.420> right<00:02:20.540> here<00:02:21.050> there's<00:02:21.470> a<00:02:21.590> stress<00:02:22.120> used<00:02:23.120> a
