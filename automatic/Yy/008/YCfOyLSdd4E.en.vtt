00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 hello hdblog.it we are acer in new york 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:08.400
 performance new products and this is 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:11.370
 the new aspire switch 11 is the only one 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.200
 product displayed here in this event by 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.960
 new york with core processor m then 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.960
 fanless is a 2 in 1 that clearly is 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.949
 detaches and this is used as a tablet 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.410
 11 inches so in short enough 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.060
 large enough or connected in 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.680
 different measures because you can put it in 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.300
 this mode notebook mode can be 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.550
 put in this other must use it 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.349
 in such a way a tripod can be made 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.399
 can do different things the plague 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.950
 successor of the model released last 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.040
 year resumes a little those pro lines 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.870
 point is enhanced with processors 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.460
 core processors me with one with some 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.860
 aesthetic differences right a 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.570
 design level of functionality that 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.370
 which I liked best is the keyboard 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.039
 because the card of this model is 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.260
 really important one evening that allows 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.809
 to write comfortably very well 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.789
 spaced all the 4 a cerano products 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.680
 a keyboard that I think is better 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.640
 than in past years and is one 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.170
 good news because in short 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.520
 basically if you buy a 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.040
 portable because it describes itself must 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.170
 work seriously and therefore if needed 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.909
 invest in this input devices 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.549
 but the same is true for the palate you look at 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.960
 how many big ones need five to five fingers per 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.939
 to cover it 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.600
 for the rest we have professor like vi 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.580
 I said then a false configuration 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.790
 basic with certain standards I wanted to say 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:28.020
 not basic with micro sd micro hdmi e 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:32.000
 usb 3.0 the size according to how many it was 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:34.829
 doc which can contain a 500gb disk 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.360
 those a mechanical disk inside and 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.820
 that this time is proposed 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.369
 with a particular software that have us 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.979
 explained here who allows that avoids that 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.320
 prevents damage to the data 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.990
 in the event of impromptu separation of the 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.439
 tablet from the dall art from the docking 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.310
 station 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.350
 there is a software that practically 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.079
 synchronize the two parts make species of 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.060
 buffer and therefore prevents a fall 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.979
 in short, anything that could ruin the 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.280
 data that is stored in the disk was 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.810
 a fundamental thing 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.640
 because this is in effect a 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.140
 portable a business laptop 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.530
 then I also liked this part 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.660
 rubberized on the bottom that allows you to 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.490
 really support it with a comfort 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.860
 important because it is quite high 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.720
 therefore it creates a good good thickness no 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.400
 you see a good inclination and then me 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.130
 like this new service zipper 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.000
 nor acer 2.0 as I saw in 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.830
 switch 10 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.310
 even this new one opens up more 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:29.069
 and it is finally good news 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.630
 unfortunately I can't do this model 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:33.190
 turn it on because it is not in use it 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.400
 we saw one running but not 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.750
 we can show it on video here they hope 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.540
 configured information will be released 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.790
 on price and availability configurations 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.340
 tell us that the prices will also be 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.230
 very very interesting so yes 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.489
 will probably start from a base from one 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.260
 low base however still remains a 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:51.340
 product for companies for i 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.530
 professionals for those who want 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.840
 mainly with laptop because a 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.519
 11 tablet can be a bit difficult 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.130
 another gem that I forgot to mention 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:03.010
 here is the synaptic visitor then 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.510
 exposed to the flaw active penn can be 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.460
 clearly added the active band 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.570
 just aren't 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.460
 all deeds and devices can be 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:10.530
 an expense in my opinion 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:12.690
 absolutely convincing for more 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.000
 information I am here now I will look for a 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.400
 find other details in between 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.870
 the square ato this bronze finish 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.460
 remember that of switch 10 of the 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.350
 last year this year we saw that 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:24.480
 it has been changed a lot, very nice 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.610
 sober very elegant I do not remember 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.440
 see something you've seen something 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.900
 similar it recently has this 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.970
 could be a good rival of the 300 c 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.320
 of asus no in that in that band 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.120
 you can more often a package more 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.530
 heavy but obviously with a keyboard and 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.150
 a tag for better for more 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:43.760
 information read the article 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.760
