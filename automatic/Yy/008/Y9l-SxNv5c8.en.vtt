00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.150 
make a video as a I guess it's kind of a
support<00:00:09.690> video<00:00:10.050> for<00:00:10.110> people<00:00:10.469> that<00:00:10.830> have<00:00:10.860> been

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
support video for people that have been

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.839 
support video for people that have been
asking<00:00:11.730> about<00:00:12.090> my<00:00:12.420> windows<00:00:12.690> 8<00:00:13.019> video<00:00:13.290> and

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:13.849 
asking about my windows 8 video and

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:15.890 
asking about my windows 8 video and
basically<00:00:14.849> they've<00:00:15.089> just<00:00:15.330> been<00:00:15.480> saying<00:00:15.780> the

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
basically they've just been saying the

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.590 
basically they've just been saying the
link<00:00:16.109> is<00:00:16.260> broken<00:00:16.440> and<00:00:17.250> everything<00:00:17.730> like<00:00:18.539> that

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
link is broken and everything like that

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.849 
link is broken and everything like that
just<00:00:19.050> because<00:00:19.500> I<00:00:19.850> guess<00:00:21.470> they<00:00:22.470> thought<00:00:22.680> it<00:00:22.830> was

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
just because I guess they thought it was

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.609 
just because I guess they thought it was
and<00:00:23.460> stuff<00:00:23.670> like<00:00:23.820> that<00:00:23.880> but<00:00:24.060> they<00:00:24.660> also<00:00:24.869> or<00:00:25.380> one

and stuff like that but they also or one

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.580 
and stuff like that but they also or one
guy<00:00:25.800> also<00:00:25.980> asked<00:00:26.580> for<00:00:26.910> a<00:00:27.240> tutorial<00:00:28.050> on<00:00:28.349> how<00:00:28.410> to

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
guy also asked for a tutorial on how to

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.070 
guy also asked for a tutorial on how to
do<00:00:28.769> it<00:00:28.920> because<00:00:29.039> I<00:00:29.250> know<00:00:29.490> it<00:00:29.849> is<00:00:30.060> a<00:00:30.090> little<00:00:30.720> bit

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
do it because I know it is a little bit

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.630 
do it because I know it is a little bit
complicated<00:00:31.439> especially<00:00:31.800> if<00:00:32.279> you've<00:00:32.460> never

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
complicated especially if you've never

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.700 
complicated especially if you've never
you<00:00:33.090> know<00:00:33.180> run<00:00:33.540> a<00:00:33.570> virtualization<00:00:34.230> before

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
you know run a virtualization before

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.430 
you know run a virtualization before
anything<00:00:35.160> like<00:00:35.309> that<00:00:35.340> so<00:00:36.329> I'm<00:00:36.989> just<00:00:37.230> going<00:00:37.380> to

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
anything like that so I'm just going to

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.200 
anything like that so I'm just going to
go<00:00:37.620> ahead<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:37.829> walk<00:00:38.219> walk<00:00:38.760> you<00:00:38.969> through

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
getting the file and then also

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.430 
getting the file and then also
downloading<00:00:42.180> it<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.450> then<00:00:42.600> running<00:00:42.930> it<00:00:43.170> in<00:00:43.320> a

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
downloading it and then running it in a

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.930 
downloading it and then running it in a
virtual<00:00:43.920> machine<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.250> I<00:00:44.520> showed<00:00:44.760> you<00:00:44.910> a

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
virtual machine and I showed you a

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.330 
virtual machine and I showed you a
little<00:00:45.300> bit<00:00:45.450> of<00:00:45.690> it<00:00:45.809> when<00:00:46.079> i<00:00:46.110> made<00:00:46.770> this<00:00:47.129> video

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.850 
through the steps of how to setup the
virtual<00:00:51.390> machine<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:51.899> I<00:00:52.469> know<00:00:52.530> there's

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
virtual machine and I know there's

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.220 
virtual machine and I know there's
videos<00:00:53.309> out<00:00:53.550> there<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:54.239> everything<00:00:54.989> like

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
like that that people may not really

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.330 
like that that people may not really
care<00:01:34.170> about<00:01:34.259> but<00:01:34.470> I<00:01:34.530> put<00:01:34.740> it<00:01:34.829> up<00:01:34.950> there<00:01:34.979> just

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.910 
care about but I put it up there just
maybe<00:01:35.939> because<00:01:36.450> it<00:01:36.960> really<00:01:37.229> helps<00:01:37.290> me<00:01:37.590> out<00:01:37.680> if

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
maybe because it really helps me out if

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.190 
maybe because it really helps me out if
you<00:01:37.950> go<00:01:38.310> check<00:01:38.970> me<00:01:39.150> out<00:01:39.180> or<00:01:39.540> something<00:01:39.900> if<00:01:40.049> you

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200

like what I do but anyways I will go
ahead<00:01:43.320> and<00:01:43.560> quit<00:01:44.520> talking<00:01:45.149> about<00:01:45.180> that<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.720> go

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
just go to this link and click there and

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.660 
just go to this link and click there and
it's<00:02:25.469> going<00:02:25.590> to<00:02:25.650> take<00:02:25.799> you<00:02:25.920> to<00:02:25.950> get<00:02:26.250> another

it's going to take you to get another

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.520 
it's going to take you to get another
adfly<00:02:27.090> thing<00:02:27.390> now<00:02:27.599> the<00:02:27.659> reason<00:02:27.870> why<00:02:28.140> I<00:02:28.200> do<00:02:28.290> this

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
adfly thing now the reason why I do this

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.020 
adfly thing now the reason why I do this
is<00:02:28.739> because<00:02:28.859> it<00:02:29.189> does<00:02:29.400> shorten<00:02:29.939> everything

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
is because it does shorten everything

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.080 
is because it does shorten everything
for<00:02:30.569> me<00:02:30.719> and<00:02:31.010> so<00:02:32.010> I<00:02:32.040> don't<00:02:32.280> have<00:02:32.459> least<00:02:32.730> long

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
for me and so I don't have least long

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.720 
for me and so I don't have least long
links<00:02:33.599> and<00:02:33.810> it<00:02:33.930> does<00:02:34.109> give<00:02:34.769> me<00:02:34.950> a<00:02:34.980> little<00:02:35.519> bit

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
links and it does give me a little bit

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.270 
links and it does give me a little bit
of<00:02:35.879> money<00:02:36.139> but<00:02:37.139> you<00:02:37.290> duhh<00:02:37.650> mean<00:02:37.829> it<00:02:37.920> doesn't

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
of money but you duhh mean it doesn't

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.309 
of money but you duhh mean it doesn't
cost<00:02:38.459> you<00:02:38.760> anything<00:02:39.030> it's<00:02:39.389> really<00:02:39.569> easy<00:02:39.900> and

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
cost you anything it's really easy and

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.220 
cost you anything it's really easy and
it<00:02:40.560> takes<00:02:41.370> five<00:02:41.700> seconds<00:02:42.180> more<00:02:42.389> so<00:02:42.659> hopefully

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
it takes five seconds more so hopefully

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.770 
it takes five seconds more so hopefully
people<00:02:43.379> don't<00:02:43.709> mind<00:02:43.879> so<00:02:44.879> then<00:02:45.450> you're<00:02:45.689> going

you now what that is is it's a third

so then you're just going to want to
create<00:05:26.940> a<00:05:27.060> virtual<00:05:27.510> drive<00:05:27.720> now<00:05:27.900> and<00:05:28.169> say<00:05:28.620> hit

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770 
create a virtual drive now and say hit

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:32.060 
create a virtual drive now and say hit
create<00:05:29.010> and<00:05:29.810> yes<00:05:30.810> you<00:05:30.840> want<00:05:31.110> it<00:05:31.200> to<00:05:31.290> be<00:05:31.320> a<00:05:31.440> VDI

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.070 
create and yes you want it to be a VDI

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:34.340 
create and yes you want it to be a VDI
file<00:05:32.460> and<00:05:32.760> you<00:05:33.090> want<00:05:33.270> it<00:05:33.330> to<00:05:33.390> be<00:05:33.600> dynamically

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:34.350 
file and you want it to be dynamically

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:36.920 
file and you want it to be dynamically

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:40.580 
allocated and you're going to want at
least<00:05:36.990> 25<00:05:37.710> gigs<00:05:38.070> just<00:05:38.550> because<00:05:38.940> 25<00:05:39.900> gigs<00:05:40.200> is

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:40.590

what<00:05:40.890> it<00:05:41.010> needs<00:05:41.250> to<00:05:41.430> run<00:05:41.610> well<00:05:41.880> it<00:05:41.970> needs<00:05:42.180> 20

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:42.600 
what it needs to run well it needs 20

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.740 
what it needs to run well it needs 20
technically<00:05:43.050> to<00:05:43.169> run<00:05:43.380> but<00:05:43.650> anyways<00:05:44.600> so<00:05:45.600> now

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:45.750 
technically to run but anyways so now

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:47.420 
technically to run but anyways so now
you're<00:05:45.870> going<00:05:46.020> to<00:05:46.080> have<00:05:46.229> this<00:05:46.530> created<00:05:47.250> and

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:47.430 
you're going to have this created and

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.000 
you're going to have this created and
you're<00:05:48.060> going<00:05:48.180> to<00:05:48.240> hit<00:05:48.330> start<00:05:48.840> now<00:05:49.200> this<00:05:49.229> works

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.010 
you're going to hit start now this works

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:52.159 
you're going to hit start now this works
very<00:05:50.250> similar<00:05:50.700> in<00:05:50.729> VMware<00:05:51.300> if<00:05:51.479> you<00:05:51.690> want<00:05:51.990> to

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:52.169 
very similar in VMware if you want to

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:54.909 
very similar in VMware if you want to
see<00:05:52.350> VMware<00:05:52.860> you<00:05:53.280> can<00:05:53.400> go<00:05:53.520> to<00:05:53.580> my<00:05:53.729> other<00:05:53.940> video

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:54.919 
see VMware you can go to my other video

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:58.010 
see VMware you can go to my other video
that<00:05:55.919> you<00:05:56.430> know<00:05:56.520> I<00:05:56.550> just<00:05:56.640> showed<00:05:57.090> you<00:05:57.120> and<00:05:57.570> that

that you know I just showed you and that

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:00.110 
that you know I just showed you and that
one<00:05:58.169> is<00:05:58.200> vmware<00:05:58.650> and<00:05:58.860> i<00:05:59.340> don't<00:05:59.550> really<00:05:59.729> explain

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.120 
one is vmware and i don't really explain

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.270 
one is vmware and i don't really explain
setting<00:06:00.660> it<00:06:00.750> up<00:06:00.840> but<00:06:01.169> it's<00:06:02.010> pretty

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:02.280 
setting it up but it's pretty

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:03.980 
setting it up but it's pretty
self-explanatory<00:06:02.640> now<00:06:03.630> you're<00:06:03.780> going<00:06:03.870> to

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:19.010 
don't have virtualization turn on

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:36.240 
see it is a windows 8 set up so it is in

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.020 
see it is a windows 8 set up so it is in
fact<00:06:36.270> working<00:06:36.660> everything<00:06:37.169> is<00:06:37.729> very<00:06:38.729> very
