00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:41.159 

John<00:07:35.050> Cena<00:07:36.039> wins<00:07:36.460> the<00:07:39.270> reason<00:07:40.270> why<00:07:40.449> Cena<00:07:40.840> will

00:07:41.159 --> 00:07:41.169 
John Cena wins the reason why Cena will

00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:44.369 
John Cena wins the reason why Cena will
win<00:07:41.349> is<00:07:41.529> because<00:07:42.219> he<00:07:43.029> didn't<00:07:43.539> win<00:07:43.779> last<00:07:43.810> year

00:07:44.369 --> 00:07:44.379 
win is because he didn't win last year

00:07:44.379 --> 00:07:47.429 
win is because he didn't win last year
and<00:07:44.740> so<00:07:45.490> it<00:07:45.639> makes<00:07:45.939> sense<00:07:46.150> for<00:07:46.599> the<00:07:46.900> company

00:07:47.429 --> 00:07:47.439 
and so it makes sense for the company

00:07:47.439 --> 00:07:59.140 
and so it makes sense for the company
for<00:07:47.620> him<00:07:48.310> to<00:07:48.789> win<00:07:49.029> this<00:07:49.539> year
