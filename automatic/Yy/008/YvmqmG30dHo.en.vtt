the u2 is different because every step
of<00:00:39.950> the<00:00:40.070> way<00:00:40.220> is<00:00:40.550> a<00:00:40.700> challenge

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.090 

when<00:00:44.420> you<00:00:44.540> take<00:00:44.750> off<00:00:44.990> it's<00:00:45.470> like<00:00:45.680> riding<00:00:46.040> a

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
when you take off it's like riding a

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.280 
when you take off it's like riding a
rocket<00:00:46.250> it's<00:00:47.140> something<00:00:48.140> that's

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:48.290 
rocket it's something that's

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.990 
rocket it's something that's
undescribable

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.420 

up<00:00:53.510> in<00:00:53.750> altitude<00:00:54.050> you're<00:00:54.500> higher<00:00:55.010> than<00:00:55.040> any

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430

challenge is below ten feet that's why

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.330 
challenge is below ten feet that's why
they<00:00:59.720> call<00:00:59.870> it<00:00:59.900> the<00:01:00.020> dragon<00:01:00.230> lady<00:01:00.590> completely

everything is exponentially harder when
you're<00:01:11.030> in<00:01:11.180> space<00:01:11.300> you<00:01:11.720> put<00:01:12.380> yourself<00:01:12.770> in<00:01:12.890> a

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
you're in space you put yourself in a

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.250 
you're in space you put yourself in a
sleeping<00:01:13.369> bag<00:01:13.430> put<00:01:14.150> oven<00:01:14.750> mitts<00:01:14.930> on<00:01:15.080> your

hands and a fishbowl on your helmet and

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.260 
hands and a fishbowl on your helmet and
then<00:01:18.050> go<00:01:18.170> sit<00:01:18.380> in<00:01:18.470> the<00:01:18.530> closet<00:01:19.010> for<00:01:19.250> 10<00:01:19.850> hours

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
then go sit in the closet for 10 hours

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.020 
then go sit in the closet for 10 hours
and<00:01:20.479> get<00:01:21.410> close<00:01:21.650> to<00:01:21.860> the<00:01:21.950> experience<00:01:22.520> but<00:01:22.790> that

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
and get close to the experience but that

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.150 
and get close to the experience but that
said<00:01:23.840> the<00:01:23.960> closet<00:01:24.350> doesn't<00:01:24.500> have<00:01:24.740> nearly<00:01:25.009> the

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:25.160 
said the closet doesn't have nearly the

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:38.359 
said the closet doesn't have nearly the
view

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.210 

we<00:01:39.369> can<00:01:39.520> fly<00:01:39.700> up<00:01:39.880> to<00:01:39.930> 70,000<00:01:40.930> feet<00:01:41.170> and<00:01:41.710> it's

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
we can fly up to 70,000 feet and it's

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.700 
we can fly up to 70,000 feet and it's
really<00:01:42.430> because<00:01:42.760> they<00:01:43.060> saved<00:01:43.990> any<00:01:44.350> kind<00:01:44.619> of

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
really because they saved any kind of

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.289 
really because they saved any kind of
weight<00:01:44.860> they<00:01:45.040> could<00:01:45.280> and<00:01:45.520> so<00:01:45.700> you<00:01:45.790> don't<00:01:46.030> have

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:46.299 
weight they could and so you don't have

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:50.460 
weight they could and so you don't have
your<00:01:46.570> normal<00:01:46.900> landing<00:01:47.440> gear<00:01:48.100> for<00:01:48.909> us<00:01:49.200> we<00:01:50.200> come

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
your normal landing gear for us we come

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.560 
your normal landing gear for us we come
down<00:01:50.710> and<00:01:51.040> we<00:01:51.159> have<00:01:51.369> to<00:01:51.580> basically<00:01:51.970> hold<00:01:52.240> it<00:01:52.479> at

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
down and we have to basically hold it at

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.719 
down and we have to basically hold it at
about<00:01:52.750> two<00:01:52.990> feet<00:01:53.229> and<00:01:53.530> then<00:01:53.770> try<00:01:54.009> to<00:01:54.070> stall<00:01:54.460> it

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
about two feet and then try to stall it

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:57.210 
about two feet and then try to stall it
if<00:01:54.909> you<00:01:55.540> stall<00:01:55.899> that<00:01:56.140> airplane<00:01:56.619> from<00:01:56.860> four

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
if you stall that airplane from four

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:58.649 
if you stall that airplane from four
feet<00:01:57.490> you're<00:01:57.940> probably<00:01:58.180> going<00:01:58.390> to<00:01:58.479> bend

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:58.659 
feet you're probably going to bend

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:01.260 
feet you're probably going to bend
something<00:01:58.960> you<00:01:59.409> stall<00:01:59.680> it<00:01:59.830> from<00:02:00.100> six<00:02:00.580> or<00:02:00.970> ten

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
something you stall it from six or ten

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:02.760 
something you stall it from six or ten
feet<00:02:01.299> you're<00:02:02.080> really<00:02:02.350> going<00:02:02.440> to<00:02:02.530> break

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
feet you're really going to break

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:03.450 
feet you're really going to break
something

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
something

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.330 
something
it's<00:02:03.780> elbows<00:02:04.780> hands<00:02:05.320> feet<00:02:05.830> everything

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
it's elbows hands feet everything

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.800 
it's elbows hands feet everything
working<00:02:06.580> together<00:02:06.729> just<00:02:07.060> to<00:02:07.299> keep<00:02:07.450> the<00:02:07.600> plane

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
working together just to keep the plane

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.719 
working together just to keep the plane
going<00:02:08.170> straight<00:02:08.530> and<00:02:08.739> landing<00:02:09.369> on<00:02:09.489> the<00:02:09.520> runway

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
going straight and landing on the runway

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.320 
going straight and landing on the runway
so<00:02:10.269> having<00:02:10.570> that<00:02:10.810> car<00:02:11.140> there<00:02:11.530> is<00:02:11.880> really<00:02:12.880> a

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
so having that car there is really a

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.140 
so having that car there is really a
safety<00:02:13.959> check<00:02:14.440> for<00:02:14.769> us<00:02:14.950> to<00:02:15.550> make<00:02:15.730> sure<00:02:15.760> we're

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
safety check for us to make sure we're

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.390 
safety check for us to make sure we're
not<00:02:16.180> you<00:02:16.840> know<00:02:16.959> dropping<00:02:17.410> in<00:02:17.739> a<00:02:17.860> plane<00:02:18.160> that

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
not you know dropping in a plane that

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.970 
not you know dropping in a plane that
has<00:02:18.810> 250<00:02:19.810> million<00:02:20.050> dollars<00:02:20.470> worth<00:02:20.739> of

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
has 250 million dollars worth of

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.390 
has 250 million dollars worth of
sensitive<00:02:21.640> sensors<00:02:22.060> on<00:02:22.269> there

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
sensitive sensors on there

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.420 
sensitive sensors on there
you<00:02:25.060> need<00:02:25.209> cars<00:02:25.540> with<00:02:25.840> a<00:02:25.870> lot<00:02:26.049> of<00:02:26.170> power

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
you need cars with a lot of power

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.740 
you need cars with a lot of power
because<00:02:27.430> depending<00:02:27.760> on<00:02:28.000> the<00:02:28.150> airfield<00:02:28.480> we're

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
because depending on the airfield we're

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.550 
because depending on the airfield we're
at<00:02:28.900> you<00:02:29.349> may<00:02:29.530> only<00:02:29.709> have<00:02:29.799> a<00:02:30.010> hundred<00:02:30.939> yard

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
at you may only have a hundred yard

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.229 
at you may only have a hundred yard
running<00:02:32.560> to<00:02:33.189> get<00:02:33.340> to<00:02:33.489> the<00:02:33.579> runway<00:02:33.760> so<00:02:33.970> if<00:02:34.180> you

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
running to get to the runway so if you

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:36.030 
running to get to the runway so if you
have<00:02:34.329> a<00:02:34.390> car<00:02:34.629> that<00:02:34.659> takes<00:02:35.079> you<00:02:35.650> know<00:02:35.769> a<00:02:35.799> good

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
have a car that takes you know a good

you're sitting at the end of the runway
you're<00:02:59.820> checking<00:03:00.150> the<00:03:00.390> plane's

you're checking the plane's

two feet from there he'll touch tail

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:45.390 
two feet from there he'll touch tail
wheel<00:03:38.860> first<00:03:39.160> and<00:03:39.490> touchdown<00:03:44.100> since<00:03:45.100> I<00:03:45.220> was<00:03:45.370> a

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
wheel first and touchdown since I was a

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.340 
wheel first and touchdown since I was a
kid<00:03:45.670> I'd<00:03:46.090> always<00:03:46.150> wanted<00:03:46.660> to<00:03:46.750> fly<00:03:47.050> high<00:03:47.320> I

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
kid I'd always wanted to fly high I

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.860 
kid I'd always wanted to fly high I
wanted<00:03:47.710> to<00:03:47.830> try<00:03:48.460> to<00:03:48.520> go<00:03:48.700> into<00:03:48.880> space<00:03:49.150> to<00:03:49.720> me

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
wanted to try to go into space to me

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.930 
wanted to try to go into space to me
this<00:03:50.080> was<00:03:50.290> the<00:03:50.560> next<00:03:51.070> best<00:03:51.370> thing<00:03:51.520> is<00:03:51.790> that

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
this was the next best thing is that

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.880 
this was the next best thing is that
even<00:03:52.120> if<00:03:52.300> you<00:03:52.360> just<00:03:52.390> fly<00:03:52.720> at<00:03:52.870> once<00:03:52.900> at<00:03:53.380> altitude

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
even if you just fly at once at altitude

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:55.650 
even if you just fly at once at altitude
it<00:03:54.040> something<00:03:54.760> that<00:03:54.790> the<00:03:55.030> majority<00:03:55.270> the<00:03:55.480> world

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
it something that the majority the world

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:00.120 
it something that the majority the world
will<00:03:55.840> never<00:03:56.080> do<00:03:57.930> you're<00:03:58.930> one<00:03:59.260> of<00:03:59.350> the<00:03:59.440> three<00:04:00.010> or
