00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.170 

this<00:00:01.140> is<00:00:01.319> just<00:00:01.530> a<00:00:01.650> quick<00:00:01.890> video<00:00:02.070> of<00:00:02.580> me

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:05.180 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:11.180 

setting<00:00:06.180> the<00:00:06.299> sag<00:00:06.660> on<00:00:06.960> the<00:00:07.080> rc4<00:00:09.679> now<00:00:10.679> they<00:00:10.920> have

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
setting the sag on the rc4 now they have

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.580 
setting the sag on the rc4 now they have
my<00:00:11.429> brother<00:00:11.700> or<00:00:12.030> my<00:00:12.150> parents<00:00:12.540> around<00:00:12.780> moments

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
my brother or my parents around moments

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.589 
my brother or my parents around moments
I<00:00:13.740> have<00:00:14.400> to<00:00:14.519> do<00:00:14.759> it<00:00:14.880> by<00:00:15.030> myself

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
I have to do it by myself

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.519 
I have to do it by myself
so<00:00:16.440> I've<00:00:16.619> got<00:00:16.920> a<00:00:17.160> ruler<00:00:17.910> and<00:00:18.300> I've<00:00:19.230> got<00:00:19.410> the

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
so I've got a ruler and I've got the

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.550 
so I've got a ruler and I've got the
beginning<00:00:19.859> of<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.130> ruler<00:00:20.660> at<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:21.840> center<00:00:22.380> of

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
beginning of the ruler at the center of

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.580 
beginning of the ruler at the center of
the<00:00:22.740> mounting<00:00:23.250> bolt<00:00:23.810> I've<00:00:24.810> just<00:00:25.019> got<00:00:25.199> it<00:00:25.230> held

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
the mounting bolt I've just got it held

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:34.250 
the mounting bolt I've just got it held
in<00:00:25.740> by<00:00:26.180> simple<00:00:29.029> rubber<00:00:30.029> bands<00:00:32.660> not<00:00:33.660> there<00:00:33.960> so

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
in by simple rubber bands not there so

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.580 
in by simple rubber bands not there so
it's<00:00:34.530> right<00:00:34.829> in<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.130> center<00:00:36.079> so<00:00:37.079> there's<00:00:37.350> no

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
it's right in the center so there's no

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.660 
it's right in the center so there's no
mistake

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:50.200 

and<00:00:43.790> now<00:00:44.480> I<00:00:44.810> will<00:00:45.170> jump<00:00:45.560> on<00:00:46.120> and<00:00:49.000> get<00:00:50.000> the

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
and now I will jump on and get the

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:59.900 
and now I will jump on and get the
measurement<00:00:53.020> get<00:00:54.020> the<00:00:54.170> measurement

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.320 

of<00:01:00.540> how<00:01:00.690> much<00:01:00.840> is<00:01:01.020> shot<00:01:01.230> compresses<00:01:01.890> so<00:01:02.360> the

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
of how much is shot compresses so the

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:11.690 
of how much is shot compresses so the
initial<00:01:06.330> length<00:01:06.630> is<00:01:09.890> 240<00:01:10.890> millimeters<00:01:11.550> so

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
initial length is 240 millimeters so

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.840 
initial length is 240 millimeters so
remember<00:01:12.120> that<00:01:14.600> so<00:01:15.600> I<00:01:15.630> said<00:01:16.170> before<00:01:16.350> by<00:01:17.040> myself

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
remember that so I said before by myself

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:27.310 
remember that so I said before by myself
here<00:01:22.520> and<00:01:23.520> my<00:01:24.480> real<00:01:24.750> will<00:01:25.020> is<00:01:25.470> leaned<00:01:26.010> against

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
here and my real will is leaned against

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.550 
here and my real will is leaned against
polled<00:01:28.320> here<00:01:28.830> I<00:01:29.270> mean<00:01:30.320> that's<00:01:31.320> how<00:01:31.500> I'm

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
polled here I mean that's how I'm

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
polled here I mean that's how I'm
balancing<00:01:33.050> so<00:01:34.050> now<00:01:34.770> I'm<00:01:34.950> getting<00:01:35.130> compressed

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
balancing so now I'm getting compressed

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:42.730 
balancing so now I'm getting compressed
with<00:01:35.820> exactly<00:01:36.270> 2<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.869> 0<00:01:38.119> now<00:01:40.460> how<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:41.520> work<00:01:41.820> out

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
with exactly 2 to 0 now how you work out

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:50.350 
with exactly 2 to 0 now how you work out
is

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:02:01.930 

if<00:01:51.360> you<00:01:51.690> can<00:01:51.900> see<00:01:52.230> this<00:01:57.560> so<00:01:58.560> initial<00:01:59.070> is<00:01:59.900> 240

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:01.940 
if you can see this so initial is 240

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.360 
if you can see this so initial is 240
take<00:02:02.940> it's<00:02:03.840> pretty<00:02:04.170> common-sense<00:02:04.560> maps<00:02:05.130> but<00:02:05.340> I

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:05.370 
take it's pretty common-sense maps but I

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.300 
take it's pretty common-sense maps but I
just<00:02:05.520> will<00:02:05.700> show<00:02:05.940> how<00:02:06.060> it's<00:02:06.240> done

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
just will show how it's done

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.680 
just will show how it's done
it's<00:02:08.310> a<00:02:08.369> difference<00:02:08.790> of<00:02:08.940> two<00:02:09.150> centimeters

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
it's a difference of two centimeters

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.030 
it's a difference of two centimeters
that's<00:02:09.930> the<00:02:10.140> compression<00:02:10.940> now<00:02:12.830> we<00:02:13.830> know<00:02:14.010> that

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
that's the compression now we know that

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.750 
that's the compression now we know that
this<00:02:14.550> shock<00:02:15.000> moves

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
this shock moves

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:26.750 
this shock moves
Shoni<00:02:17.760> six<00:02:19.580> millimeters<00:02:21.440> so<00:02:22.440> I've<00:02:22.590> got<00:02:22.890> a<00:02:25.760> sag

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
Shoni six millimeters so I've got a sag

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.050 
Shoni six millimeters so I've got a sag
of<00:02:27.000> 26%<00:02:27.660> which<00:02:27.990> is<00:02:28.230> not<00:02:28.440> high<00:02:28.650> enough<00:02:29.060> so

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
of 26% which is not high enough so

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.150 
of 26% which is not high enough so
that's<00:02:30.840> how<00:02:31.020> you<00:02:31.080> work<00:02:31.260> out<00:02:31.500> sex<00:02:31.860> obviously

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
that's how you work out sex obviously

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.850 
that's how you work out sex obviously
you<00:02:32.430> have<00:02:32.550> to<00:02:32.630> loosen<00:02:33.630> the<00:02:33.960> preload<00:02:34.590> and

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
you have to loosen the preload and

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.890 
you have to loosen the preload and
hopefully<00:02:37.860> aim<00:02:38.190> for<00:02:38.520> around<00:02:41.330> 0.3<00:02:42.330> so<00:02:42.720> that

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
hopefully aim for around 0.3 so that

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.390 
hopefully aim for around 0.3 so that
would<00:02:43.020> be<00:02:43.140> 30%<00:02:45.500> yeah<00:02:46.500> so<00:02:46.950> that's<00:02:47.130> how<00:02:47.280> it's

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
would be 30% yeah so that's how it's

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.990 
would be 30% yeah so that's how it's
done<00:02:47.460> and<00:02:47.610> then<00:02:47.880> afterwards<00:02:48.950> so<00:02:49.950> I've<00:02:50.040> got<00:02:50.310> all

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
done and then afterwards so I've got all

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.900 
done and then afterwards so I've got all
my<00:02:51.110> free<00:02:52.110> loads<00:02:52.380> and<00:02:52.740> compressions<00:02:53.400> high<00:02:53.670> and

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
my free loads and compressions high and

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:59.479 
my free loads and compressions high and
low<00:02:54.560> on<00:02:56.360> out<00:02:57.360> most<00:02:57.900> say<00:02:58.260> highest<00:02:58.739> -<00:02:59.010> and<00:02:59.400> no

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
low on out most say highest - and no

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.600 
low on out most say highest - and no
pluses<00:03:00.150> so<00:03:01.140> I<00:03:01.200> can<00:03:01.410> get<00:03:01.560> this<00:03:01.680> preload<00:03:02.220> right

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
pluses so I can get this preload right

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.070 
pluses so I can get this preload right
in<00:03:02.820> the<00:03:02.910> first<00:03:03.120> place<00:03:03.420> so<00:03:04.380> yeah<00:03:05.810> so<00:03:06.810> it's<00:03:06.959> all

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
in the first place so yeah so it's all

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.890 
in the first place so yeah so it's all
just<00:03:07.320> playing<00:03:07.709> around<00:03:08.209> mucking<00:03:09.209> around<00:03:09.330> till

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
just playing around mucking around till

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.890 
just playing around mucking around till
we<00:03:09.930> get<00:03:10.140> the<00:03:10.260> right<00:03:10.440> value
