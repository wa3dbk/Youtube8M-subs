00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:07.450
 here we are now 

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:09.309
 giovanni bracco a face that everyone 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:09.730
 know who loves to go to sea with a 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:11.670
 rubber dinghy 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.840
 surely he will have followed some 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.789
 john bracco's adventure are 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.190
 different and different raids is already done with 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:20.740
 motonautica vesuviana if I have made them 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:23.470
 four two styles and two winter styles that 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.939
 luckily everyone played with bombs then 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.470
 knows very well those who are i 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:28.599
 means that are produced here we are 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.550
 several journalists guests came to 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:32.940
 to browse right in the house of 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.980
 Brazilian powerboat to better understand 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.420
 what's behind these coming months 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.949
 a little from the lines regarding 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.500
 precisely the construction techniques that is 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:44.230
 beyond the design that each one 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.340
 then his preferences can 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.500
 like it or not, but here 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.820
 actually there is something coming out 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.410
 from the lines regarding 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.910
 the use of some materials and 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.170
 some the some techniques that 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.210
 in short, we have seen that in infusion 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.280
 which gives important advantages but 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.769
 let's say that I the Vesuvian powerboat 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:03.330
 love baptized with the engineer 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:07.330
 we have known each other since the distant 94 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:10.510
 indeed he arrived at one ad 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:12.880
 such a technology to be 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:15.760
 considered if not the number 11 of the 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.630
 more technological sites that are there 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:21.409
 today in the Italian square 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:25.340
 tomorrow all this technology and so on 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:28.340
 is served and serves the end user for 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.860
 have a lighter medium that comes 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:34.399
 driven with less effort by the engine 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:36.200
 so that it has lower consumption and 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:38.869
 respectful speed 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.310
 how your experience has affected e 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:43.009
 all that relationship you created with 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.960
 the vincenzo engineer in these years in the 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:46.429
 improve what can be one 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.439
 production that already the game with the 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:50.780
 very precise and very clear ideas though 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:53.539
 he followed a certain path with you 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.799
 they exchange different different images 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:58.369
 given different opinions you have 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:59.959
 reported after every ride but me 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:02.420
 I hope so 

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:04.640
 it's a question you should ask him 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.740
 I hope he took advantage of it 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.099
 he says it is so from our experiences 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:15.920
 common then I used his boats 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:20.840
 let's say of average size the 650 the 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:23.030
 seven hundred the 7 80 and now who knows that 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.859
 it is not the turn of the summits all 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.600
 data that obviously for what they are 

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:28.250
 your initiatives the adventures that you do 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.780
 he used to follow are 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.579
 very important especially when yes 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.560
 must match the performance you need 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:35.630
 be interesting but with consumption at 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.160
 consumption today becomes more and more 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.989
 important here on the other shirt 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.940
 let's see suzuki which by the way is really 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:42.319
 engaged with on this occasion with 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.090
 these two days to do these tests 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:45.560
 in water of 90 by 40 to 40 in 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.410
 particular intrigues us because it is a 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.269
 seed 320 with a 40 horses must be able to 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.980
 give the best of themselves in this 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:54.019
 sense of the yard must do a job 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.700
 which is not just lightening the boat 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:57.260
 but to study water lines too 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.299
 i imagine mistrust of weights all over 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.950
 what it takes to optimize that 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:03.049
 which is a 40 horses we're talking about 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.359
 of a 200 300 center 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:06.350
 of course with the power many are covered 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:09.290
 what's this 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:10.569
 actually 40 is a little bit reinvigorated 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.810
 let's say we're level 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:14.950
 of the 60 horses anyway the dinghy 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.739
 events 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:20.590
 this new model has a hull that 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:23.409
 it came flush from the tubulars so it is 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:25.060
 comparable also to something more 

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:28.239
 we say that the measurement on events is a 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:30.489
 slightly narrow and all in all it offers 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:35.379
 more than decent performances for those 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:37.419
 does not want to take on the driving license problem 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:39.489
 obviously the version with 90 horses 

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:41.650
 it's a bit different 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:44.169
 and something that will surely give more 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.569
 user satisfaction at the level of 

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:47.739
 speed 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:52.060
 let's say one of the warhorses 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:55.840
 of the mv yard is just the space a 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:58.810
 board the fact of being able to take advantage of 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:01.750
 what is the space of the raft that 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:05.019
 in itself it is not very large compared to 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:08.889
 boat however is used with a lot 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:13.000
 profit and decentralized console offers 

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:14.590
 a way of living on board let's say 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.639
 higher quality for more comfort 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.940
 compared to the other 

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:21.880
 all always seasoned with fairings 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:24.190
 very efficient so water lines or 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.229
 very efficient that allow you to 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.370
 travel at respectable speeds with 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:30.009
 of costs 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.389
 let's say a little more content then 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:33.729
 we leave all our friends 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:34.810
 fans of rafts and sea of 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:35.889
 passion to live the sea 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.900
 let's leave this question mark 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:40.030
 who knows what next initiative 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.710
 will propose Giovanni Bracco if it will be tied 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:45.340
 to this new 620 presented its own 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:47.380
 today in the Amalfi coast for which a 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.639
 short then we'll let you know what the 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.940
 next initiative by Giovanni Bach 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:53.740
 certainly grace not only sea 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:56.820
 we hope we can say something 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.820
 positive this winter too 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.840
 not that a company also because we come 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:01.840
 anyway 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:13.300
 the boat that won everything ready too 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:16.620
 a world championship 2004 in Naples does not exist 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.620
 I will do marina it continues 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.010
 first Mediterranean and then the ocean 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.010
 Atlantic
