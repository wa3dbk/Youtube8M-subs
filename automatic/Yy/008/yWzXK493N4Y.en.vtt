00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:08.280
 yes, I thought you would make it 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.320
 video to pay negative and potencies 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.780
 I also pack the playlist once 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.780
 when calculating with negative numbers and 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.710
 once with powers and potent laws 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.800
 maybe now again 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.330
 So it was about that 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.330
 different spellings if I have 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.210
 a negative number without brackets high 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.010
 an exponent and for the 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.170
 negative number is in parentheses and me 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.649
 had already said in a video that 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:37.530
 you just have to be careful with the version 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:39.000
 What if the high number of the exponent 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.100
 I just want to go here again 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.620
 perhaps make clear at the beginning 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.899
 very short 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:48.629
 two high 7s, for example, calls the whole thing 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.640
 Potentially what is below is the 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.250
 basis and what is above is the 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:57.270
 exponent and 27 I could yes 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:59.129
 write down as 2 x 2 x 2 and 2 x 2 x 2 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.260
 So seven times the two in a row 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.329
 written the other way as I can say 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.920
 I write down this shortened as 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.680
 two high 7 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.720
 so what comes out of here now i had 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.060
 already made clear if no 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.600
 bracket around the negative number is then 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:18.030
 is the count with a high number 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.560
 stronger than multiplying by and 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.759
 here nothing would be more 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:28.380
 imagine stand as minus 1 x 2 high 1 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:31.110
 or at the version - 1 x 2 high two 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.150
 so the minus is always high 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:37.619
 I do not have to pay anything 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:41.520
 always two high 1 is 2 - stays two 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:44.579
 high two is four - two remain high 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:49.350
 three is eight that's minus and so on 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:51.270
 you can see that every time - no matter how 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.790
 how the high number is like that 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.030
 exponent is that - always remains 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:02:02.430
 but if the negative number is in parentheses 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:03.750
 is packed - two high 1 he gives me 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.990
 Write now and look something 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:11.240
 happens results in - 2 - 2 high 2 results 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:17.990
 plus 4 -2 83 gives - 8 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:21.140
 + 16 - 32 plus 64 why this now 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:25.240
 change - plus - maybe you can see it 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:28.520
 always when the number is high 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:30.320
 the result is positive why that has 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.000
 as I said here to do with 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:36.710
 how can you - two to two 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:39.620
 is rewrite - two times - two minus 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:42.800
 times minus plus plus when I'm up 3 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.900
 again - to multiply minus 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.270
 times minus was just minus again 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.470
 but then yields - and so does each one 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.020
 always the change instead 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:54.710
 so you can remember if I have one 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:57.590
 odd number have high and the negative 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:03:01.610
 number in brackets the result - but at 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:03.470
 even high numbers and the negative ones 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.770
 number here in the base in brackets 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.210
 then something positive comes out of me 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.320
 think with the picture it really should 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:12.140
 be clear 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:15.170
 also with the other video if still 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.400
 Something is writing underneath I want 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.160
 make a picture but how 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.490
 I hope it is everything 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.490
 clarified
