that we cut down out in the pasture the

it today you see there's a thistle
better<00:00:11.309> not<00:00:11.570> touch<00:00:12.570> that<00:00:14.059> looking<00:00:15.059> pretty

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
better not touch that looking pretty

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.930 
better not touch that looking pretty
good<00:00:15.450> so<00:00:16.199> far<00:00:16.490> we're<00:00:17.490> looking<00:00:17.699> at<00:00:17.789> coming

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
good so far we're looking at coming

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.740 
good so far we're looking at coming
through<00:00:18.119> and<00:00:18.210> baling<00:00:18.480> it<00:00:18.570> tomorrow<00:00:20.750> still

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
through and baling it tomorrow still

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.040 
through and baling it tomorrow still
underneath<00:00:22.580> you<00:00:23.580> can<00:00:23.730> find<00:00:24.029> patches<00:00:24.630> that<00:00:24.930> are

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
underneath you can find patches that are

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.160 
underneath you can find patches that are
still<00:00:25.470> a<00:00:25.500> little<00:00:25.650> wet<00:00:25.980> but<00:00:26.570> by<00:00:27.570> tomorrow<00:00:27.930> we're

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
still a little wet but by tomorrow we're

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.929 
still a little wet but by tomorrow we're
thinking<00:00:28.470> that<00:00:28.619> it<00:00:28.710> should<00:00:28.859> be<00:00:29.010> pretty<00:00:29.820> good

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
thinking that it should be pretty good

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:30.820 
thinking that it should be pretty good
to<00:00:30.179> go

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:30.830 
to go

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.260 
to go
assuming<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:32.189> moisture<00:00:32.550> dries<00:00:32.850> off<00:00:33.059> pretty

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
assuming the moisture dries off pretty

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.229 
assuming the moisture dries off pretty
early<00:00:33.360> in<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.690> day<00:00:34.700> now<00:00:35.700> something

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
early in the day now something

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.810 
early in the day now something
interesting<00:00:36.360> that<00:00:36.719> I<00:00:36.899> read<00:00:37.140> yesterday<00:00:37.820> was

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
interesting that I read yesterday was

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.470 
interesting that I read yesterday was
that<00:00:40.040> apparently<00:00:41.040> there's<00:00:41.219> some<00:00:41.480> wildfires

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
that apparently there's some wildfires

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.110 
that apparently there's some wildfires
going<00:00:42.780> on<00:00:42.989> in<00:00:43.140> Canada<00:00:43.379> right<00:00:43.649> now<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:44.700> if<00:00:45.000> you

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
going on in Canada right now and if you

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.569 
going on in Canada right now and if you
look<00:00:45.270> up<00:00:45.620> the<00:00:46.620> sky<00:00:47.750> we<00:00:48.750> have<00:00:48.870> this<00:00:49.020> like

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579 
look up the sky we have this like

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:53.660 
look up the sky we have this like
covering<00:00:50.579> haze<00:00:50.850> all<00:00:51.329> over<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.750> sky<00:00:52.489> this<00:00:53.489> guy

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
covering haze all over the sky this guy

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.990 
covering haze all over the sky this guy
is<00:00:53.730> not<00:00:53.940> really<00:00:54.120> blue<00:00:54.809> blue<00:00:55.140> as<00:00:55.289> it<00:00:55.410> usually<00:00:55.559> is

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
is not really blue blue as it usually is

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.910 
is not really blue blue as it usually is
and<00:00:57.000> I<00:00:57.059> guess<00:00:57.270> that's<00:00:57.449> because<00:00:57.690> smoke<00:00:58.590> from

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
and I guess that's because smoke from

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.360 
and I guess that's because smoke from
the<00:00:59.219> fire<00:00:59.910> out<00:01:00.120> in<00:01:00.270> Canada<00:01:00.449> is<00:01:01.370> traveling

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
the fire out in Canada is traveling

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.850 
the fire out in Canada is traveling
southeast<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.199> we're<00:01:04.199> getting<00:01:04.320> some<00:01:04.619> of<00:01:04.710> it

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
southeast and we're getting some of it

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.620 
southeast and we're getting some of it
it's<00:01:05.100> traveling<00:01:05.610> through<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.180> atmosphere

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
it's traveling through the atmosphere

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.109 
it's traveling through the atmosphere
and<00:01:06.780> I<00:01:07.020> guess<00:01:07.590> when<00:01:07.860> wind<00:01:08.280> gust<00:01:08.460> long<00:01:08.700> gust

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
and I guess when wind gust long gust

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.640 
and I guess when wind gust long gust
launched<00:01:09.450> it<00:01:09.570> down<00:01:09.720> south<00:01:10.020> so<00:01:10.320> now<00:01:10.470> we're

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
launched it down south so now we're

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.510 
launched it down south so now we're
getting<00:01:10.920> it<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:12.770> it's<00:01:13.770> pretty<00:01:13.979> out<00:01:14.159> at<00:01:14.340> least

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
getting it and it's pretty out at least

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.969 
getting it and it's pretty out at least
but<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.720> sun's<00:01:15.990> trying<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.560> shine<00:01:16.770> through

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
but the sun's trying to shine through

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.690 
but the sun's trying to shine through
that<00:01:17.990> haze<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.409> not<00:01:20.159> getting<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.460> kind<00:01:20.640> of

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
that haze and not getting the kind of

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.609 
that haze and not getting the kind of
sun<00:01:20.880> exposure<00:01:21.180> we<00:01:21.509> would<00:01:21.689> have<00:01:21.840> on<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.409> typical

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
sun exposure we would have on a typical

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.060 
sun exposure we would have on a typical
day<00:01:23.150> so<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.450> haze<00:01:24.930> been<00:01:25.170> sitting<00:01:25.439> here<00:01:25.560> for<00:01:25.830> a

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
day so the haze been sitting here for a

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.980 
day so the haze been sitting here for a
day<00:01:26.820> or<00:01:26.970> two<00:01:27.000> longer<00:01:27.299> than<00:01:27.540> we<00:01:27.659> would<00:01:27.840> usually

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
day or two longer than we would usually

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.940 
day or two longer than we would usually

where we can actually get to them with
the<00:02:15.360> bed<00:02:15.570> with<00:02:15.930> the<00:02:16.020> flatbed<00:02:16.440> and<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:17.010> truck

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
the bed with the flatbed and the truck

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.210 
the bed with the flatbed and the truck
and<00:02:17.370> trailer<00:02:17.660> because<00:02:18.660> that<00:02:19.470> hasn't<00:02:19.650> stands

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
and trailer because that hasn't stands

and trailer because that hasn't stands
the<00:02:20.430> hills<00:02:20.730> are<00:02:20.880> too<00:02:21.120> steep<00:02:21.390> for<00:02:22.040> us<00:02:23.040> to<00:02:23.250> move

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
the hills are too steep for us to move

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.880 
the hills are too steep for us to move
across<00:02:23.640> with<00:02:23.970> the<00:02:24.120> flatbed<00:02:24.870> so<00:02:25.170> we're<00:02:25.770> moving

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
across with the flatbed so we're moving

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.290 
across with the flatbed so we're moving
all<00:02:26.130> the<00:02:26.220> bales<00:02:26.370> over<00:02:26.610> to<00:02:26.670> one<00:02:26.820> hillside<00:02:27.210> and

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
all the bales over to one hillside and

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.240 
all the bales over to one hillside and
then<00:02:27.390> we're<00:02:27.480> going<00:02:27.570> to<00:02:27.660> come<00:02:27.840> in<00:02:27.960> with<00:02:27.990> a

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
then we're going to come in with a

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.640 
then we're going to come in with a
trailer<00:02:29.250> later<00:02:29.730> on<00:02:30.110> after<00:02:31.110> the<00:02:31.140> Bills<00:02:31.410> have

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
trailer later on after the Bills have

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.770 
trailer later on after the Bills have
kind<00:02:31.860> of<00:02:31.920> cooled<00:02:32.130> off<00:02:32.310> and<00:02:32.630> we're<00:02:33.630> going<00:02:33.720> to

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
kind of cooled off and we're going to

00:02:33.780 --> 00:03:38.339 
kind of cooled off and we're going to
haul<00:02:33.900> them<00:02:34.020> out<00:02:34.080> of<00:02:34.200> here

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:38.349 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:40.229 

now<00:03:39.129> some<00:03:39.310> of<00:03:39.340> you<00:03:39.549> have<00:03:39.609> asked<00:03:39.939> me<00:03:39.999> why<00:03:40.209> we

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
now some of you have asked me why we

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:41.819 
now some of you have asked me why we
don't<00:03:40.480> have<00:03:40.629> a<00:03:40.659> bail<00:03:40.900> kicker<00:03:41.200> on<00:03:41.290> the<00:03:41.469> back<00:03:41.650> of

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
don't have a bail kicker on the back of

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:43.500 
don't have a bail kicker on the back of
our<00:03:41.890> baler<00:03:42.129> so<00:03:42.819> we<00:03:42.939> don't<00:03:43.090> have<00:03:43.150> to<00:03:43.299> back<00:03:43.480> up

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
our baler so we don't have to back up

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.339 
our baler so we don't have to back up
every<00:03:43.959> time<00:03:44.170> we<00:03:44.549> make<00:03:45.549> a<00:03:45.579> bail<00:03:46.019> well

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:47.349 
every time we make a bail well

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:52.110 
every time we make a bail well
lutely<00:03:47.980> cell<00:03:48.280> sides<00:03:50.040> you<00:03:51.040> tell<00:03:51.280> me<00:03:51.459> should<00:03:52.060> we

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
lutely cell sides you tell me should we

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:59.640 
lutely cell sides you tell me should we
get<00:03:52.269> a<00:03:52.329> bail<00:03:52.510> kicker<00:03:57.750> all<00:03:58.750> it<00:03:58.930> takes<00:03:59.170> is<00:03:59.409> turn

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
get a bail kicker all it takes is turn

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.429 
get a bail kicker all it takes is turn
the<00:03:59.799> baler<00:04:00.510> just<00:04:01.510> the<00:04:01.629> wrong<00:04:01.810> way<00:04:02.079> when<00:04:02.319> you're

00:04:02.429 --> 00:04:02.439 
the baler just the wrong way when you're

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:04.740 
the baler just the wrong way when you're
backing<00:04:02.620> up<00:04:02.920> and<00:04:03.480> you're<00:04:04.480> going<00:04:04.599> to<00:04:04.629> be

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
backing up and you're going to be

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.589 
backing up and you're going to be
sending<00:04:04.989> those<00:04:05.139> bales<00:04:05.439> off<00:04:06.239> down<00:04:07.239> into<00:04:07.480> the

00:04:07.589 --> 00:04:07.599 
sending those bales off down into the

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:09.720 
sending those bales off down into the
ravine<00:04:07.840> and<00:04:08.079> that's<00:04:08.530> not<00:04:08.680> a<00:04:08.709> good<00:04:08.889> thing<00:04:09.069> and<00:04:09.489> a

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
ravine and that's not a good thing and a

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.179 
ravine and that's not a good thing and a
lot<00:04:09.879> of<00:04:09.909> our<00:04:10.090> fields<00:04:10.450> are<00:04:10.569> on<00:04:11.189> somewhat

00:04:12.179 --> 00:04:12.189 
lot of our fields are on somewhat

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:13.470 
lot of our fields are on somewhat
hillsides<00:04:12.609> because<00:04:12.909> we<00:04:13.030> live<00:04:13.180> in<00:04:13.269> a<00:04:13.329> hilly

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
hillsides because we live in a hilly

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.279 
hillsides because we live in a hilly
area<00:04:14.310> and<00:04:15.359> these<00:04:16.359> particular<00:04:16.599> hillsides

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:17.289 
area and these particular hillsides

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:19.140 
area and these particular hillsides
there<00:04:17.560> isn't<00:04:17.859> really<00:04:17.919> a<00:04:18.039> spot<00:04:18.430> where<00:04:18.940> you<00:04:19.000> can

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
there isn't really a spot where you can

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.449 
there isn't really a spot where you can
park<00:04:19.449> or<00:04:20.019> not<00:04:20.139> really<00:04:20.289> park<00:04:20.500> but<00:04:20.739> you<00:04:20.769> can<00:04:21.190> stop

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
park or not really park but you can stop

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.770 
park or not really park but you can stop
and<00:04:22.270> push<00:04:22.479> the<00:04:22.660> bales<00:04:22.840> back<00:04:23.310> without<00:04:24.780> having

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
and push the bales back without having

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.409 
and push the bales back without having
them<00:04:25.870> roll<00:04:26.110> off<00:04:26.320> on<00:04:26.560> you<00:04:26.740> so<00:04:27.310> it's<00:04:28.120> nice<00:04:28.389> to

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:28.419 
them roll off on you so it's nice to

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:30.749 
them roll off on you so it's nice to
have<00:04:28.780> a<00:04:29.050> bill<00:04:29.440> a<00:04:29.830> baler<00:04:30.250> without<00:04:30.490> a<00:04:30.520> kicker

00:04:30.749 --> 00:04:30.759 
have a bill a baler without a kicker

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:32.460 
have a bill a baler without a kicker
because<00:04:31.000> then<00:04:31.120> you<00:04:31.210> can<00:04:31.330> just<00:04:31.509> back<00:04:32.080> up<00:04:32.320> to

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
because then you can just back up to

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.770 
because then you can just back up to
where<00:04:32.590> you<00:04:32.680> want<00:04:32.860> it<00:04:32.919> to<00:04:33.009> drop<00:04:33.220> open<00:04:34.090> it<00:04:34.419> up<00:04:34.570> and

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780 
where you want it to drop open it up and

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.300 
where you want it to drop open it up and
then<00:04:35.320> you<00:04:35.500> can<00:04:35.620> have<00:04:35.770> more<00:04:35.919> control<00:04:35.979> over

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
then you can have more control over

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.670 
then you can have more control over
where<00:04:36.669> you're<00:04:36.789> sending<00:04:36.970> it<00:04:37.180> because<00:04:37.680> bale

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
where you're sending it because bale

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.439 
where you're sending it because bale
kickers<00:04:39.009> are<00:04:39.160> intended<00:04:39.550> for<00:04:39.580> flatter<00:04:40.000> areas

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:40.449 
kickers are intended for flatter areas

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:42.210 
kickers are intended for flatter areas
if<00:04:40.660> you<00:04:40.900> kick<00:04:41.500> out<00:04:41.650> the<00:04:41.770> bale<00:04:41.889> it's<00:04:42.070> not

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
if you kick out the bale it's not

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.460 
if you kick out the bale it's not
rolling<00:04:42.460> anywhere<00:04:42.820> but<00:04:43.030> around<00:04:43.419> here<00:04:43.780> in

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
rolling anywhere but around here in

00:04:44.470 --> 00:05:16.270 
rolling anywhere but around here in
these<00:04:44.650> parts<00:04:45.419> not<00:04:46.419> a<00:04:46.479> good<00:04:46.659> idea

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.040 

now<00:05:17.280> if<00:05:17.400> you<00:05:17.490> look<00:05:17.580> at<00:05:17.669> the<00:05:17.759> sky<00:05:18.060> we<00:05:18.720> still<00:05:18.930> have

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050 
now if you look at the sky we still have

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:20.809 
now if you look at the sky we still have
that<00:05:19.169> dull<00:05:19.440> haze<00:05:19.680> from<00:05:20.009> the<00:05:20.159> canadian<00:05:20.550> fires

00:05:20.809 --> 00:05:20.819 
that dull haze from the canadian fires

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:26.570 
that dull haze from the canadian fires
even<00:05:21.659> in<00:05:21.810> the<00:05:21.990> today<00:05:24.800> sky<00:05:25.800> isn't<00:05:26.009> blue<00:05:26.159> it's

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 
even in the today sky isn't blue it's

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:29.050 
even in the today sky isn't blue it's
just<00:05:26.729> that<00:05:26.879> dull<00:05:27.300> white<00:05:27.870> milky<00:05:28.379> color<00:05:28.590> still

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:29.060 
just that dull white milky color still

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.219 
just that dull white milky color still
it's<00:05:30.060> been<00:05:30.240> like<00:05:30.389> that<00:05:30.509> for<00:05:30.569> the<00:05:30.750> past<00:05:30.990> few

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:31.229 
it's been like that for the past few

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:33.770 
it's been like that for the past few
days<00:05:31.409> and<00:05:31.770> I'm<00:05:32.759> not<00:05:32.909> sure<00:05:33.120> exactly<00:05:33.360> when<00:05:33.690> it's

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780 
days and I'm not sure exactly when it's

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.740 
days and I'm not sure exactly when it's
supposed<00:05:33.960> to<00:05:34.020> let<00:05:34.199> up<00:05:34.440> the<00:05:34.740> Sun<00:05:35.729> isn't<00:05:36.569> really

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:36.750 
supposed to let up the Sun isn't really

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.500 
supposed to let up the Sun isn't really
in<00:05:36.870> that<00:05:37.139> tent
