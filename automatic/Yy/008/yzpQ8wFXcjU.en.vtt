multiple<00:00:58.559> TV<00:00:59.219> channels<00:00:59.579> on<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.789> TV<00:01:00.089> and<00:01:00.210> you

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:00.269 
multiple TV channels on the TV and you

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:01.910 
multiple TV channels on the TV and you
could<00:01:00.449> punch<00:01:00.659> to<00:01:00.809> change<00:01:01.079> and<00:01:01.379> then<00:01:01.710> it<00:01:01.829> would

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
could punch to change and then it would

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.189 
could punch to change and then it would
eventually<00:01:02.069> turn<00:01:02.399> off<00:01:02.640> but<00:01:03.019> normally<00:01:04.019> things

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
eventually turn off but normally things

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.960 
eventually turn off but normally things
are<00:01:04.320> just<00:01:04.409> on<00:01:04.680> or<00:01:04.890> off<00:01:05.040> in<00:01:05.070> growtopia<00:01:05.580> so

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
are just on or off in growtopia so

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.880 
are just on or off in growtopia so
that's<00:01:06.120> pretty<00:01:06.300> legit<00:01:06.690> there's<00:01:07.440> a<00:01:07.530> microwave

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
that's pretty legit there's a microwave

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.280 
that's pretty legit there's a microwave
so<00:01:08.280> if<00:01:08.369> you<00:01:08.460> want<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:08.729> do<00:01:08.850> some<00:01:09.060> cooking<00:01:09.240> I<00:01:09.600> you

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
so if you want to do some cooking I you

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.240 
so if you want to do some cooking I you
would<00:01:10.409> think<00:01:10.500> that<00:01:10.590> it<00:01:10.740> would<00:01:10.829> cook<00:01:11.040> faster

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
would think that it would cook faster

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.800 
would think that it would cook faster
and<00:01:11.520> like<00:01:11.729> take<00:01:11.939> away<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.240> nutritional

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
and like take away the nutritional

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.569 
and like take away the nutritional
content<00:01:12.960> but<00:01:13.560> I<00:01:13.740> think<00:01:14.040> he<00:01:14.100> just<00:01:14.220> operates

00:01:14.569 --> 00:01:14.579 
content but I think he just operates

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:16.969 
content but I think he just operates
like<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.729> normal<00:01:15.060> oven<00:01:15.360> or<00:01:15.600> like<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.500> stove<00:01:16.740> or

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979

either<00:01:43.829> you<00:01:44.070> typed<00:01:44.340> in<00:01:44.490> a<00:01:44.579> random<00:01:44.939> world<00:01:45.149> name

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
either you typed in a random world name

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.289 
either you typed in a random world name
and<00:01:45.869> you<00:01:46.619> put<00:01:46.799> like<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:46.979> lock<00:01:47.340> either<00:01:47.820> just

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
and you put like a lock either just

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.969 
and you put like a lock either just
around<00:01:48.539> the<00:01:48.689> first<00:01:48.990> part<00:01:49.109> of<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.469> door<00:01:49.710> so

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
around the first part of the door so

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.940 
around the first part of the door so
that<00:01:50.130> no<00:01:50.460> one<00:01:50.579> can<00:01:50.729> steal<00:01:51.000> your<00:01:51.180> stuff<00:01:51.479> and

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
that no one can steal your stuff and

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.170 
that no one can steal your stuff and
that's<00:01:52.950> like<00:01:53.159> another<00:01:53.490> thing<00:01:53.759> that<00:01:53.939> I<00:01:54.000> should

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
that's like another thing that I should

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.490 
that's like another thing that I should
probably<00:01:54.270> make<00:01:54.570> a<00:01:54.600> whole<00:01:54.689> video<00:01:54.990> on<00:01:55.109> it's<00:01:55.320> just

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
probably make a whole video on it's just

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.010 
probably make a whole video on it's just
locks<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:56.009> how<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.159> apply<00:01:56.460> them<00:01:56.840> here's<00:01:57.840> how<00:01:57.990> I

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
locks and how to apply them here's how I

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.990 
locks and how to apply them here's how I
like<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.289> build<00:01:58.590> do<00:01:59.490> you<00:01:59.549> see<00:01:59.670> how<00:01:59.759> I'm<00:01:59.880> just

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
like to build do you see how I'm just

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.370 
like to build do you see how I'm just
like<00:02:00.179> running<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:00.600> placing<00:02:00.990> at<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.200> same

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
like running and placing at the same

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.429 
like running and placing at the same
time<00:02:01.679> and<00:02:02.270> these<00:02:03.270> are<00:02:03.420> two<00:02:03.630> items<00:02:04.020> that<00:02:04.109> are

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
time and these are two items that are

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:14.059 
time and these are two items that are
farmable<00:02:05.750> and<00:02:07.009> we'll<00:02:08.009> do<00:02:08.280> a<00:02:08.310> little<00:02:08.960> gold<00:02:12.080> okay

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
farmable and we'll do a little gold okay

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.849 
farmable and we'll do a little gold okay
this<00:02:14.819> is<00:02:14.999> farming<00:02:15.420> you<00:02:16.109> break<00:02:16.409> the<00:02:16.590> blocks

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:16.859 
this is farming you break the blocks

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:19.489 
this is farming you break the blocks
with<00:02:17.760> intentions<00:02:18.329> of<00:02:18.569> getting<00:02:18.780> more<00:02:19.170> blocks

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:19.499 
with intentions of getting more blocks

00:02:19.499 --> 00:02:22.280 
with intentions of getting more blocks
and<00:02:19.799> more<00:02:20.159> seeds<00:02:20.629> you're<00:02:21.629> gonna<00:02:21.749> plant<00:02:22.109> the

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
and more seeds you're gonna plant the

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.379 
and more seeds you're gonna plant the
seeds<00:02:22.530> to<00:02:23.159> get<00:02:23.370> more<00:02:23.579> blocks<00:02:23.909> and<00:02:26.150> okay<00:02:27.150> do<00:02:27.299> you

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:27.389 
seeds to get more blocks and okay do you

00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:29.690 
seeds to get more blocks and okay do you
see<00:02:27.540> how<00:02:27.659> gold<00:02:27.959> gives<00:02:28.200> me<00:02:28.349> a<00:02:28.379> lot<00:02:28.650> that<00:02:29.609> was

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
see how gold gives me a lot that was

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:36.440 
see how gold gives me a lot that was
three<00:02:29.969> gems<00:02:30.239> there<00:02:31.129> none<00:02:33.650> for<00:02:34.650> gems<00:02:35.040> and<00:02:35.450> this

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
three gems there none for gems and this

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.429 
three gems there none for gems and this
is<00:02:36.599> how<00:02:36.719> you<00:02:36.780> farm<00:02:37.109> it's<00:02:37.469> slow<00:02:38.219> and<00:02:38.609> steady<00:02:39.060> and

00:02:39.429 --> 00:02:39.439 
is how you farm it's slow and steady and

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:42.199 
is how you farm it's slow and steady and
there<00:02:40.439> is<00:02:40.560> a<00:02:40.590> timer<00:02:40.980> so<00:02:41.400> you<00:02:41.459> do<00:02:41.700> have<00:02:41.730> to<00:02:41.969> like

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
there is a timer so you do have to like

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.289 
there is a timer so you do have to like
keep<00:02:42.450> pushing<00:02:42.810> the<00:02:42.930> buttons<00:02:43.290> um<00:02:44.269> some<00:02:45.269> people

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
keep pushing the buttons um some people

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:48.349 
keep pushing the buttons um some people
go<00:02:45.659> crazy<00:02:45.870> with<00:02:46.260> farming<00:02:46.680> like<00:02:46.950> I<00:02:47.159> I<00:02:47.849> used<00:02:48.209> to

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:48.359 
go crazy with farming like I I used to

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:50.720 
go crazy with farming like I I used to
farm<00:02:48.569> hardcore<00:02:49.260> but<00:02:49.709> now<00:02:49.889> I<00:02:49.919> keep<00:02:50.430> it<00:02:50.579> pretty

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
farm hardcore but now I keep it pretty

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:51.440 
farm hardcore but now I keep it pretty
low-key

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
low-key

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.780 
low-key
so<00:02:53.329> they<00:02:54.329> actually<00:02:54.510> nerfed<00:02:55.079> it<00:02:55.319> 700<00:02:55.859> Steph

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
so they actually nerfed it 700 Steph

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.750 
so they actually nerfed it 700 Steph
second<00:02:57.780> huh<00:02:57.930> MooMoo<00:02:58.260> nerfed<00:02:59.069> farming<00:02:59.579> on

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
second huh MooMoo nerfed farming on

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.610 
second huh MooMoo nerfed farming on
certain<00:03:00.239> items<00:03:00.569> that<00:03:00.659> had<00:03:00.870> certain<00:03:01.109> rarity

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
certain items that had certain rarity

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.050 
certain items that had certain rarity
yes<00:03:01.739> this<00:03:01.949> means<00:03:02.159> certain<00:03:02.430> rare<00:03:02.609> he<00:03:02.730> doesn't

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
yes this means certain rare he doesn't

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.069 
yes this means certain rare he doesn't
even<00:03:03.120> know<00:03:03.299> why<00:03:03.389> I<00:03:03.419> did<00:03:03.659> that<00:03:03.689> but<00:03:04.250> um<00:03:05.250> it<00:03:05.790> was

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
even know why I did that but um it was

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:09.110 
even know why I did that but um it was
I<00:03:07.109> think<00:03:07.530> coral<00:03:07.949> was<00:03:08.280> in<00:03:08.430> the<00:03:08.519> nerfing<00:03:08.849> pile

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
I think coral was in the nerfing pile

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.189 
I think coral was in the nerfing pile
and<00:03:09.480> then<00:03:10.169> sugar<00:03:10.769> cane<00:03:11.209> my<00:03:12.209> god<00:03:12.510> some<00:03:12.930> of<00:03:13.049> y'all

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:13.199 
and then sugar cane my god some of y'all

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:15.289 
and then sugar cane my god some of y'all
went<00:03:13.439> crazy<00:03:13.680> with<00:03:14.189> the<00:03:14.340> sugar<00:03:14.579> cane<00:03:14.849> farming

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
went crazy with the sugar cane farming

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:17.750 
went crazy with the sugar cane farming
apparently<00:03:15.840> and<00:03:16.319> there's<00:03:17.219> something<00:03:17.430> about

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
apparently and there's something about

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.300 
apparently and there's something about
how<00:03:18.000> some<00:03:18.780> people<00:03:18.930> don't<00:03:19.379> like<00:03:19.650> to<00:03:19.949> have<00:03:20.069> the

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
how some people don't like to have the

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.559 
how some people don't like to have the
blocks<00:03:20.579> touching<00:03:21.120> each<00:03:21.239> other<00:03:22.040> okay

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:23.569 
blocks touching each other okay

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:26.059 
blocks touching each other okay
certain<00:03:24.569> blocks<00:03:24.810> break<00:03:25.139> faster<00:03:25.590> than<00:03:25.769> others

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:26.069 
certain blocks break faster than others

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:27.860 
certain blocks break faster than others
so<00:03:26.310> these<00:03:26.430> purples<00:03:26.939> you<00:03:27.120> can<00:03:27.269> really<00:03:27.540> blitz

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
so these purples you can really blitz

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.539 
so these purples you can really blitz
through<00:03:28.109> compared<00:03:28.590> to<00:03:28.709> the<00:03:28.799> goals<00:03:29.040> which<00:03:29.340> take

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
through compared to the goals which take

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:32.240 
through compared to the goals which take
a<00:03:29.579> long<00:03:29.790> time<00:03:30.060> in<00:03:31.049> addition<00:03:31.439> to<00:03:31.680> that<00:03:31.919> you<00:03:32.129> need

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
a long time in addition to that you need

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.490 
a long time in addition to that you need
to<00:03:32.370> take<00:03:32.549> into<00:03:32.970> effect<00:03:33.120> how<00:03:33.870> long<00:03:34.079> it<00:03:34.229> takes

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
to take into effect how long it takes

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.439 
to take into effect how long it takes
these<00:03:35.099> blocks<00:03:35.459> to<00:03:35.699> grow<00:03:36.259> like<00:03:37.259> scope<00:03:37.769> this<00:03:37.919> out

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:38.449 
these blocks to grow like scope this out

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:42.649 
these blocks to grow like scope this out
purple<00:03:40.340> coral<00:03:41.340> should<00:03:42.030> have<00:03:42.120> got<00:03:42.209> one<00:03:42.389> gold

00:03:59.929 --> 00:03:59.939 
purple blocks farm that means that every

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:02.569 
purple blocks farm that means that every
time<00:04:00.180> that<00:04:00.209> you<00:04:00.479> do<00:04:00.629> around<00:04:01.019> you'll<00:04:01.919> have<00:04:01.979> more

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
time that you do around you'll have more

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:04.490 
time that you do around you'll have more
than<00:04:02.790> you<00:04:03.060> started<00:04:03.120> with<00:04:03.569> before<00:04:03.870> so<00:04:04.079> they'll

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
than you started with before so they'll

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.749 
than you started with before so they'll
grow<00:04:04.709> on<00:04:05.040> you<00:04:05.479> growtopia<00:04:06.479> and<00:04:07.019> then

00:04:07.749 --> 00:04:07.759 
grow on you growtopia and then

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:09.979 
grow on you growtopia and then
eventually<00:04:08.759> you'll<00:04:08.879> have<00:04:09.000> over<00:04:09.239> 200<00:04:09.780> and<00:04:09.840> then

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
eventually you'll have over 200 and then

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.349 
eventually you'll have over 200 and then
you'll<00:04:10.169> have<00:04:10.289> to<00:04:10.439> set<00:04:10.620> a<00:04:10.650> stack<00:04:10.949> aside<00:04:11.329> so<00:04:12.329> I

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:12.359 
you'll have to set a stack aside so I

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:13.789 
you'll have to set a stack aside so I
can<00:04:12.539> do<00:04:12.629> those<00:04:12.780> again<00:04:12.900> in<00:04:13.019> two<00:04:13.289> hours<00:04:13.319> these

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
can do those again in two hours these

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:17.409 
can do those again in two hours these
again<00:04:14.099> in<00:04:14.219> three<00:04:14.609> or<00:04:15.090> gold<00:04:15.569> is<00:04:15.840> 19<00:04:16.500> hours

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:17.419 
again in three or gold is 19 hours

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:19.580 
again in three or gold is 19 hours
that's<00:04:18.419> a<00:04:18.509> really<00:04:18.719> long<00:04:18.870> time<00:04:19.109> and<00:04:19.169> that's<00:04:19.469> one

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
that's a really long time and that's one

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:20.830 
that's a really long time and that's one
of<00:04:19.620> the<00:04:19.739> reasons<00:04:20.099> that

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
of the reasons that

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.540 
of the reasons that
some<00:04:21.620> people<00:04:21.829> don't<00:04:21.920> like<00:04:22.040> to<00:04:22.250> farm<00:04:22.460> gold<00:04:22.700> um

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
some people don't like to farm gold um

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.490 
some people don't like to farm gold um
it's<00:04:25.550> really<00:04:25.760> hard<00:04:26.060> to<00:04:26.210> start<00:04:26.510> farms<00:04:26.990> the<00:04:27.320> way

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
it's really hard to start farms the way

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.830 
it's really hard to start farms the way
that<00:04:27.889> um<00:04:28.070> sometimes<00:04:28.940> you<00:04:29.150> can<00:04:29.300> get<00:04:29.510> one<00:04:29.660> going

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
that um sometimes you can get one going

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.720 
that um sometimes you can get one going
and<00:04:30.080> sometimes<00:04:30.440> you<00:04:30.560> can't<00:04:30.860> there's<00:04:31.430> a<00:04:31.520> big

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:31.730 
and sometimes you can't there's a big

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:35.950 
and sometimes you can't there's a big
random<00:04:32.210> element<00:04:32.660> to<00:04:32.810> it<00:04:33.880> so<00:04:34.880> I<00:04:35.360> don't<00:04:35.660> know<00:04:35.750> I

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
random element to it so I don't know I

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.480 
random element to it so I don't know I
honestly<00:04:36.470> this<00:04:36.710> is<00:04:36.860> just<00:04:36.889> kind<00:04:37.130> of<00:04:37.160> like<00:04:37.310> some
