00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.980
 so much good for all the kids I am 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:14.320
 the observers who are here today for 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:17.380
 present you the top 5 of the scenes 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.960
 moving in video games as I had 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:22.449
 promised indeed I take advantage of it immediately for 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:25.180
 thank you those 4,000 lay people over 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:26.920
 received in the previous video kebir vi 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.300
 you really are great 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.679
 before proceeding I remember that 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.810
 continuing with the video viewing 

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:33.040
 you might come across spoilers then 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.710
 be very careful 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:40.149
 having said that we can immediately start 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:42.280
 with this new fifth ranking 

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:45.309
 place we find one of the final scenes of 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.230
 metal gear solid 3 snake eater in a 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:50.320
 field covered with white flowers yes 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.120
 collide in and the boss after a long 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.510
 battle and just snake to get out of it 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.460
 winner and to kill his mentor 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.410
 only later, however, will you discover 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.719
 which in reality was not a boss 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:04.059
 traitor but a heroine she had 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:05.820
 tried to avoid a war between the 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.740
 United States and Russia 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.450
 unfortunately this secret will remain mentioned 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.670
 in the story to hear only snake 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.799
 he will carry in his heart the heroic deeds 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.549
 of the one who saved the world from 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:17.470
 war 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:19.900
 a really moving scene in which 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.229
 student and mentor collide for 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.229
 the last time 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.960
 fourth place for the death scene of 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.480
 john marston in red dead redemption 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.340
 what about having the character who 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.890
 used for the whole adventure to fall 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.660
 on the ground after being hit has me 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.240
 really left speechless 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:42.210
 I couldn't believe my parents yet 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.860
 it was so john was dead but from heroes 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.430
 after rescuing his family 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.200
 and having challenged his revolver para 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.300
 to die then 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.619
 a very sad scene that I wouldn't have 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.619
 never wanted to attend 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.350
 in third place we find a scene of 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.790
 modern warfare 2 and precisely that 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.520
 in which the death of the rude is shown 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.789
 and that of ghost one of the most characters 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.440
 charismatic of the entire series and to whom 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:12.450
 personally I am more fond of the two 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.730
 they have indeed been betrayed by the general 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.069
 shepard and used to recover some 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.590
 to then get rid of them like nothing 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.300
 perhaps I was left above all crowded 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.220
 when the two soldiers are burned 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.380
 after having spilled gasoline 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.420
 while a scene was still alive 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:31.080
 really touching that it deserves right 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.610
 to enter this top 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.519
 the second step of the podium is occupied 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.050
 from the scene of the last of us which 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:39.769
 we can assist in spite of ourselves 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:42.480
 on the death of sarah, daughter of joy 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:44.310
 the epidemic has just broken out e 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.530
 jobs is trying to bring them up to safety 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.750
 bild and running away from those who are 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.610
 been infected 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.430
 fortunately the two are saved by 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:56.430
 a soldier who is ordered to 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.350
 kill two joels at this point yes 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.510
 time in the hope of protecting the 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.110
 skin but things do not go in the verse 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.540
 quite right 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:06.570
 the bullet indeed hit the 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.820
 little joy saved by his brother 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:12.450
 Tommy tries to reassure her by telling her 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:13.970
 that all will be well but unfortunately 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.769
 baby dies in his arms 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.900
 a heartbreaking scene that for a breath 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:21.260
 does not reach its head 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.260
 Ranking 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:27.090
 the first place of this top goes to 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:29.430
 final scene of walking dead sea su juan 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.070
 in which we witness the death of 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.960
 character from the difficult past who 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:36.330
 however he found in the small a clement 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:39.690
 you have the strength to go on and on 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:41.970
 to survive unfortunately during history 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.790
 he is moved and not much left 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.950
 before turning into a zombie 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:48.960
 furthermore clement must also decide whether 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.820
 kill or not the one who was like 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.160
 a father for him during you establish me 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:55.260
 I barely held back my tears 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.790
 what's even more heartbreaking is that 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.160
 of not being able to do so to save there 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.910
 despite the choices made during the 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.830
 game 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:05.100
 the end always remains however 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:07.680
 same raw and sad and it is really for 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:12.090
 this reason that in my opinion this 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:14.340
 scene deserves to find itself in the first place 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.019
 well guys the video ends here i will 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.519
 thank you for watching if it is video 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:19.290
 liked leave a live 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:21.269
 if we arrive at least 3000 light vi 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.720
 I will immediately bring another top on which I am 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.370
 working 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.710
 otherwise you will have to wait a while 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.240
 more don't forget to comment and me 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.810
 I recommend tell me what you think of 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.820
 this top 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.280
 if you agree with me or if you would 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.919
 inserted some other scene collect 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.960
 if following your advice maybe 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:39.060
 a second top could come out 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:43.430
 I thank you once again for the 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.430
 vision you are fantastic and hello
