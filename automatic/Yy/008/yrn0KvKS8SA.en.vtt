what we're trying to do is make the

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.530 
what we're trying to do is make the
guitar<00:00:13.590> sound<00:00:14.070> like<00:00:14.370> one<00:00:15.030> chord<00:00:15.360> you<00:00:15.450> know

guitar sound like one chord you know
right<00:00:15.719> now<00:00:15.839> if<00:00:15.990> I<00:00:16.080> play<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:16.410> guitar<00:00:17.000> there's

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
right now if I play the guitar there's

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.120 
right now if I play the guitar there's
no<00:00:18.180> cord<00:00:18.449> to<00:00:18.690> that<00:00:18.869> right<00:00:19.109> so<00:00:19.680> what<00:00:19.949> I'm<00:00:20.010> going

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
no cord to that right so what I'm going

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.800 
no cord to that right so what I'm going
to<00:00:20.189> do<00:00:20.310> is<00:00:20.460> tune<00:00:20.699> it<00:00:20.850> to<00:00:20.880> a<00:00:21.060> D<00:00:21.330> chord<00:00:21.660> and

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
to do is tune it to a D chord and

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.599 
to do is tune it to a D chord and
there's<00:00:21.930> a<00:00:21.990> specific<00:00:22.199> way<00:00:22.560> to<00:00:22.769> do<00:00:23.100> that<00:00:23.279> you're

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
there's a specific way to do that you're

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.370 
there's a specific way to do that you're
going<00:00:23.699> to<00:00:23.760> go<00:00:23.910> ahead<00:00:24.000> and<00:00:24.240> drop<00:00:24.539> your<00:00:24.960> sixth

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.400 
going to go ahead and drop your sixth
string<00:00:25.650> down<00:00:25.949> to<00:00:26.250> D<00:00:26.460> so<00:00:27.180> I<00:00:27.510> already<00:00:27.930> have<00:00:28.170> a<00:00:28.199> D

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
string down to D so I already have a D

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.139 
string down to D so I already have a D
the<00:00:28.619> fourth<00:00:28.890> string<00:00:31.189> to<00:00:32.189> drop<00:00:32.430> down<00:00:32.640> my<00:00:32.820> sixth

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
string to the and then I'm also going to

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.530 
string to the and then I'm also going to
get<00:00:37.440> my<00:00:37.620> first<00:00:37.890> string<00:00:38.370> which<00:00:38.730> is<00:00:38.760> e<00:00:39.090> right<00:00:39.329> now

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
down to D as well somebody's the same

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.069 
down to D as well somebody's the same
method<00:00:42.239> I'm<00:00:42.329> going<00:00:42.360> to<00:00:42.480> use<00:00:42.600> that<00:00:42.780> fourth

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
method I'm going to use that fourth

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.080 
method I'm going to use that fourth
string<00:00:43.379> D<00:00:46.010> now<00:00:47.010> we<00:00:47.070> got<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.520> little<00:00:47.670> trickier

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
string D now we got a little trickier

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.270 
string D now we got a little trickier
we're<00:00:48.210> going<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.390> use<00:00:48.570> we<00:00:49.230> need<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.860> second

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
we're going to use we need the second

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.569 
we're going to use we need the second
string<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:50.820> be<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:51.920> so<00:00:52.920> I'm<00:00:53.010> going<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.160> use<00:00:53.399> the

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
string to be a so I'm going to use the

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.060 
string to be a so I'm going to use the
fifth<00:00:53.850> string<00:00:54.300> which<00:00:54.600> is<00:00:54.629> already<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:55.110> in<00:00:55.739> order

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
fifth string which is already a in order

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.180 
fifth string which is already a in order
to<00:00:56.190> tune<00:00:56.399> down<00:00:57.020> the<00:00:58.020> my<00:00:58.260> second<00:00:58.710> string<00:00:58.949> to

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
to tune down the my second string to

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.299 
to tune down the my second string to
match<00:00:59.430> that<00:00:59.670> note

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:07.450 

and<00:01:04.600> then<00:01:05.600> there's<00:01:05.780> one<00:01:06.080> more<00:01:06.110> step<00:01:06.740> this

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
and then there's one more step this

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:08.890 
and then there's one more step this
one's<00:01:07.670> a<00:01:07.759> little<00:01:07.850> trickier<00:01:08.360> because<00:01:08.540> there's

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
one's a little trickier because there's

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.380 
one's a little trickier because there's
no<00:01:09.080> string<00:01:09.530> that<00:01:09.830> matches<00:01:10.250> this<00:01:10.460> we<00:01:11.090> need<00:01:11.270> to

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
no string that matches this we need to

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.840 
no string that matches this we need to
try<00:01:11.630> and<00:01:11.689> get<00:01:11.960> this<00:01:12.110> third<00:01:12.439> string<00:01:12.890> to<00:01:13.490> be<00:01:13.520> F

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
try and get this third string to be F

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.279 
try and get this third string to be F
sharp<00:01:14.680> so<00:01:15.759> the<00:01:16.759> way<00:01:16.909> I<00:01:16.939> do<00:01:17.149> it<00:01:17.479> is<00:01:17.630> I'm<00:01:18.110> going<00:01:18.229> to

00:01:18.279 --> 00:01:18.289 
sharp so the way I do it is I'm going to

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:20.590 
sharp so the way I do it is I'm going to
go<00:01:18.409> to<00:01:18.470> the<00:01:18.619> fourth<00:01:18.950> string<00:01:19.399> right<00:01:20.180> I<00:01:20.210> haven't
