 color solutions carrot bright blue 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:17.420
 black and balloon they differ only 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:20.989
 color not only the light of the handle but also 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:24.140
 light clips in and blue and the table will be 

00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:27.320
 white black and balloon clips were 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.910
 black on this is actually the difference all 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.950
 other advantages and disadvantages 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:34.489
 I'll tell you by example 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:37.820
 handle from the same 10 complex milling and 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:40.820
 very good and tactile wearing a knife not 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:43.910
 ask even if the hand is wet hand 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.500
 the tips are no spoon repeating completely 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.650
 this form 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:53.480
 steel guides 3 figure races 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:57.290
 here and two supporting races inside are no longer 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:01:00.710
 curly wedge massed 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:03.739
 sandblasting in Russian 447 on the blade 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:07.009
 Keeps sharpening well, cuts well 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:09.229
 has a notch on this fate for 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:11.330
 acura thumb can be good 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.110
 put maximum effort into 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.380
 planing 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:17.930
 or whom I forgot here the standard ax 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.980
 words two-sided with spring 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.890
 standard 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:26.270
 with a certain skill knife can 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:31.430
 fold and insert 3 green hands with one hand 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:34.250
 again there is no lanyard hole 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.600
 the forest can be transplanted on both sides 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.730
 if suddenly 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.130
 lanyard you all the same and like us 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:44.660
 hang then you can try to do it 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.740
 interesting knife for the last race 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:49.430
 nice 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:51.350
 as you remember, this is a copy of the knife hekler Koh 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.710
 which was made for Kepler in 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:58.430
 epic companies are good 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:01.930
 handy thing and probably not bad 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:05.800
 compete even this on hot for daria 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:09.140
 I recommend 4 colors available for 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:13.810
 the right good choice is more 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.810
 what good enough knife recommend
