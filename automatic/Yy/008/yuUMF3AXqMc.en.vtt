00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:15.930 
playing on this side and most of these

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:17.510 
playing on this side and most of these
will<00:00:16.230> not<00:00:16.260> miss<00:00:16.590> these<00:00:16.770> let<00:00:17.070> me<00:00:17.130> rephrase<00:00:17.460> that

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
will not miss these let me rephrase that

will not miss these let me rephrase that
some<00:00:18.180> of<00:00:18.330> these<00:00:18.420> are<00:00:18.689> a<00:00:18.720> little<00:00:18.869> tricky<00:00:19.170> so<00:00:20.240> if

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
some of these are a little tricky so if

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.060 
some of these are a little tricky so if
you<00:00:22.020> understand<00:00:22.529> them<00:00:22.680> they're<00:00:22.800> very

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
you understand them they're very

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.710 
you understand them they're very
consistent<00:00:23.700> so<00:00:23.939> like<00:00:24.180> this<00:00:24.360> one<00:00:24.540> for<00:00:24.689> example

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
consistent so like this one for example

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.690 
consistent so like this one for example
the<00:00:25.169> shadow<00:00:25.470> you<00:00:25.650> unwind<00:00:25.980> yourself<00:00:26.160> right

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:26.700 
the shadow you unwind yourself right

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.159 
the shadow you unwind yourself right
when<00:00:26.849> you<00:00:26.939> walk<00:00:27.029> out<00:00:27.239> that<00:00:27.270> door<00:00:27.419> find

holes right in the middle so right there

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.200 
holes right in the middle so right there
and<00:02:11.430> right<00:02:11.459> there<00:02:12.360> you<00:02:12.630> go<00:02:13.670> and<00:02:14.670> once<00:02:15.060> again

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
and right there you go and once again

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.680 
and right there you go and once again
this<00:02:15.630> one<00:02:15.810> is<00:02:15.960> very<00:02:16.080> consistent<00:02:17.210> I'm<00:02:18.210> even<00:02:18.570> if

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
this one is very consistent I'm even if

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:19.760 
this one is very consistent I'm even if
they're<00:02:18.870> laying<00:02:19.050> down<00:02:19.230> you

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
they're laying down you

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.260 
they're laying down you
be<00:02:19.950> able<00:02:20.100> to<00:02:20.190> get<00:02:20.310> them<00:02:20.430> visit<00:02:20.730> hits<00:02:20.880> low<00:02:21.090> on

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
be able to get them visit hits low on

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:26.900 
be able to get them visit hits low on
the<00:02:21.360> bomb<00:02:22.610> and<00:02:24.050> I<00:02:25.050> mean<00:02:25.440> we<00:02:26.130> did<00:02:26.280> this<00:02:26.400> tutorial

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
the bomb and I mean we did this tutorial

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.770 
the bomb and I mean we did this tutorial
on<00:02:27.060> ba<00:02:27.270> ba<00:02:27.630> ba<00:02:28.020> so<00:02:28.200> I<00:02:28.800> think<00:02:29.550> there's<00:02:29.700> five<00:02:30.120> five

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
on ba ba ba so I think there's five five

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.050 
on ba ba ba so I think there's five five
or<00:02:30.960> six<00:02:31.170> spots<00:02:31.410> I<00:02:31.560> can<00:02:31.740> remember<00:02:32.270> so<00:02:33.270> here's<00:02:34.020> to

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
or six spots I can remember so here's to

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.080 
or six spots I can remember so here's to
Bombay<00:02:36.060> so<00:02:36.750> same<00:02:37.290> spot<00:02:37.650> basically<00:02:38.490> as<00:02:38.700> you<00:02:38.910> did

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
Bombay so same spot basically as you did

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.130 
Bombay so same spot basically as you did
balme<00:02:39.600> again<00:02:40.730> now<00:02:41.730> this<00:02:42.090> one<00:02:42.330> is<00:02:42.360> basically

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
balme again now this one is basically

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.790 
balme again now this one is basically
bomb<00:02:43.410> the<00:02:43.590> bomb<00:02:44.210> so<00:02:45.210> the<00:02:46.140> enemy<00:02:46.290> is<00:02:46.560> going<00:02:46.740> to

bomb that you're going to go to the

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.180 
bomb that you're going to go to the
other<00:02:50.610> bomb<00:02:50.910> in<00:02:51.360> a<00:02:51.780> very<00:02:51.960> sneaky<00:02:52.320> fashion<00:02:52.830> line

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
up right here with it then look straight

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.140 
up right here with it then look straight
above<00:02:55.710> a<00:02:55.860> make<00:02:56.130> sure<00:02:56.280> you<00:02:56.460> straight<00:02:56.700> above<00:02:56.940> it

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
above a make sure you straight above it

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.170 
above a make sure you straight above it
and<00:02:57.980> make<00:02:58.980> sure<00:02:59.010> he's<00:02:59.400> the<00:02:59.550> fusing<00:02:59.910> which<00:03:00.060> I

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
and make sure he's the fusing which I

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.330 
and make sure he's the fusing which I
did<00:03:00.390> not<00:03:00.420> I<00:03:00.780> just<00:03:00.990> stood<00:03:01.140> anyways<00:03:01.530> but<00:03:02.040> he<00:03:02.130> made

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
did not I just stood anyways but he made

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:09.770 
did not I just stood anyways but he made
it<00:03:02.930> and<00:03:04.220> yeah<00:03:05.220> there<00:03:05.580> you<00:03:05.670> go<00:03:07.100> and<00:03:08.120> wait<00:03:09.120> for<00:03:09.540> it

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
it and yeah there you go and wait for it

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.070 
it and yeah there you go and wait for it
so<00:03:11.030> you're<00:03:12.030> throwing<00:03:12.480> this<00:03:12.510> she's<00:03:12.840> going<00:03:12.990> to

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
so you're throwing this she's going to

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.400 
so you're throwing this she's going to
go<00:03:13.380> through<00:03:13.710> every<00:03:14.360> part<00:03:15.360> of<00:03:15.450> the<00:03:15.810> array<00:03:16.110> that

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
go through every part of the array that

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.160 
go through every part of the array that
is<00:03:16.650> there<00:03:17.010> whatever<00:03:17.760> and<00:03:17.970> then<00:03:18.120> he<00:03:18.330> spreads

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
is there whatever and then he spreads

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.930 
is there whatever and then he spreads
his<00:03:19.260> legs<00:03:19.500> opens<00:03:20.040> wide<00:03:20.280> and<00:03:20.610> that's<00:03:20.730> what

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
his legs opens wide and that's what

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.680 
his legs opens wide and that's what
happens<00:03:21.300> all<00:03:21.710> right<00:03:22.710> now<00:03:23.100> I<00:03:23.130> think<00:03:23.940> yeah<00:03:24.480> this

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
happens all right now I think yeah this

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.940 
happens all right now I think yeah this
is<00:03:24.870> the<00:03:24.990> final<00:03:25.290> one<00:03:25.940> moving<00:03:26.940> on<00:03:27.060> to<00:03:27.390> the<00:03:28.020> tube

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
is the final one moving on to the tube

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.630 
is the final one moving on to the tube
spot<00:03:29.280> for<00:03:29.870> bomb<00:03:30.870> bethania<00:03:31.410> so<00:03:32.040> just<00:03:32.310> basically

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
spot for bomb bethania so just basically

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.010 
spot for bomb bethania so just basically
playing<00:03:32.940> anywhere<00:03:33.390> in<00:03:33.540> here<00:03:33.570> it<00:03:33.840> doesn't

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:34.020 
playing anywhere in here it doesn't

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.130 
playing anywhere in here it doesn't
really<00:03:34.200> matter<00:03:34.410> because<00:03:34.770> it<00:03:35.100> is<00:03:35.370> a<00:03:36.030> wide<00:03:36.390> range

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
really matter because it is a wide range

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.080 
really matter because it is a wide range
i<00:03:37.440> guess<00:03:37.650> of<00:03:37.920> it's<00:03:38.310> basically<00:03:38.760> your<00:03:38.970> own

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
i guess of it's basically your own

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.460 
i guess of it's basically your own
little<00:03:39.240> mortar<00:03:39.660> team<00:03:39.870> going<00:03:40.290> off<00:03:40.730> so<00:03:42.230> in<00:03:43.230> a<00:03:43.350> way

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
little mortar team going off so in a way

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.199 
little mortar team going off so in a way
you<00:03:43.530> might<00:03:43.650> want<00:03:43.980> to<00:03:44.040> have<00:03:44.130> your<00:03:44.550> teammate<00:03:44.970> and

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
you might want to have your teammate and

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.330 
you might want to have your teammate and
plant<00:03:45.480> it<00:03:45.680> to<00:03:46.680> get<00:03:46.860> all<00:03:47.010> the<00:03:47.070> way<00:03:47.130> back<00:03:47.280> here

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
plant it to get all the way back here

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.340 
plant it to get all the way back here
but<00:03:47.850> I<00:03:48.150> mean<00:03:48.600> doesn't<00:03:48.840> really<00:03:49.050> matter<00:03:49.260> you

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
but I mean doesn't really matter you

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.290 
but I mean doesn't really matter you
