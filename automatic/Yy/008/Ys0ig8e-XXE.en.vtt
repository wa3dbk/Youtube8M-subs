00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 to all his kamikaze ovaries 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.589
 is today a new video 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:11.389
 following the request of a few 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:15.480
 of you were silent how to do it 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:17.760
 tripod in quotation marks for ipod and 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:32.160
 iphone end all smart phones 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:33.690
 ipodtouch so bah it's gone then 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.370
 first of all you will have to 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.620
 rolls of toilet paper or paper 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.149
 sopalin nutgrass paper roll paper 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.680
 you can cut it in half or you 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.690
 can leave it to make a tripod 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.210
 more after you are going to need to 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.620
 colored tape it's optional but 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.379
 it's just to make it more beautiful 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.120
 as well as a marker and a pair of 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.949
 scissors a first time you go 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:58.100
 wrap it around the toilet paper or 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:02.539
 paper paper 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:04.759
 depending on what you have once 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:06.409
 that this tedious step is finally 

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:10.759
 finished you can bring yourself some 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:13.009
 scissors and cut the scotch that you 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:15.790
 will give something a little more 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:18.979
 nice then that's where the marker 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:27.490
 well you are going to make cash 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:27.490
 notches like that deep enough for 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:37.070
 your phone just gets up 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:40.330
 do two opposite and that she is to 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.330
 about the same size 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.950
 so you dose and one after that there is 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.420
 has one on that side and one on that side 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.899
 and after you will cut out your 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:55.350
 hooks people I cut out the 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:58.549
 now that I discover here a step 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.549
 of relatively simple 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:06.860
 must be about the same 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.210
 of the same depth so that's me 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:12.320
 seems not bad this step is over 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:15.130
 you cut out a little this part 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:21.170
 there the shortest part 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:24.020
 the part not the part that will hold in 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:32.870
 do the phone but the other you 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:35.360
 go the cut is a little bit up and 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:43.540
 you will fold a little bit his 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:43.540
 sides up and the other too 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:51.370
 that's what you get after a 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:54.489
 very practical and very nice tutorial that 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.530
