will go straight to this folder here
it's<00:00:43.670> real<00:00:43.820> simple<00:00:44.030> to<00:00:44.239> get<00:00:44.360> there<00:00:44.570> just<00:00:44.810> go<00:00:44.960> to

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.020 
it's real simple to get there just go to

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.420 
it's real simple to get there just go to
my<00:00:45.320> computer<00:00:45.829> and<00:00:47.649> under<00:00:48.649> favorite<00:00:49.070> should

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:49.430 
my computer and under favorite should

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.770 
my computer and under favorite should
have<00:00:49.579> downloads<00:00:50.120> so<00:00:51.489> here<00:00:52.489> we<00:00:52.579> go<00:00:52.730> eight<00:00:53.480> point

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
have downloads so here we go eight point

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
point seven so

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.320 
point seven so
it<00:01:06.650> should<00:01:06.950> look<00:01:07.130> like<00:01:07.190> this<00:01:07.610> if<00:01:07.880> you<00:01:08.120> have

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
it should look like this if you have

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
it should look like this if you have
wind<00:01:08.630> wrong<00:01:08.810> already

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
wind wrong already

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.550 
wind wrong already
if<00:01:09.500> you<00:01:09.680> don't<00:01:09.980> have<00:01:10.190> WinRAR<00:01:10.720> it's<00:01:11.720> a<00:01:12.140> good

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
if you don't have WinRAR it's a good

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.950 
if you don't have WinRAR it's a good
program<00:01:12.920> to<00:01:13.070> have<00:01:13.480> you<00:01:14.480> just<00:01:14.630> go<00:01:14.780> into<00:01:14.900> Google

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
program to have you just go into Google

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.590 
program to have you just go into Google
type<00:01:15.440> in<00:01:15.590> WinRAR<00:01:16.240> it's<00:01:17.240> a<00:01:17.450> WI<00:01:17.960> n<00:01:18.290> space<00:01:18.680> AR<00:01:19.070> AR

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
type in WinRAR it's a WI n space AR AR

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.620 
type in WinRAR it's a WI n space AR AR
it's<00:01:20.600> real<00:01:20.930> simple<00:01:21.140> to<00:01:21.260> install<00:01:22.450> it's<00:01:23.450> not<00:01:23.600> a

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
it's real simple to install it's not a

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.810 
it's real simple to install it's not a
real<00:01:23.870> big<00:01:24.080> file<00:01:24.350> it's<00:01:24.650> a<00:01:24.740> useful<00:01:25.070> program<00:01:25.490> so

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
real big file it's a useful program so

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.150 
real big file it's a useful program so
the<00:01:26.540> future<00:01:26.930> you<00:01:27.140> probably<00:01:27.380> use<00:01:27.530> it<00:01:27.710> a<00:01:27.860> lot<00:01:28.040> of

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:28.160 
the future you probably use it a lot of

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.250 
the future you probably use it a lot of
computers<00:01:28.520> already<00:01:28.729> have<00:01:28.970> it<00:01:29.150> but<00:01:29.450> so<00:01:30.020> this<00:01:30.140> is

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:30.260 
computers already have it but so this is

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
computers already have it but so this is
what<00:01:30.380> I<00:01:30.410> look<00:01:30.620> like<00:01:30.650> if<00:01:30.920> you<00:01:30.950> were<00:01:31.070> to<00:01:31.160> have<00:01:31.250> one

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
what I look like if you were to have one

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.820 
what I look like if you were to have one
law<00:01:31.600> yeah<00:01:32.600> sometimes<00:01:33.170> it<00:01:33.320> should<00:01:33.500> work<00:01:33.650> as

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
law yeah sometimes it should work as

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.390 
law yeah sometimes it should work as
well<00:01:34.040> for<00:01:34.250> this<00:01:34.370> though<00:01:34.640> so<00:01:35.979> what<00:01:36.979> you<00:01:37.100> do<00:01:37.220> have

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400 
well for this though so what you do have

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.010 
well for this though so what you do have
to<00:01:37.520> do<00:01:37.640> is<00:01:37.820> you<00:01:37.970> want<00:01:38.150> to<00:01:38.180> extract<00:01:38.720> them<00:01:38.900> all

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
to do is you want to extract them all

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.840 
to do is you want to extract them all
back<00:01:39.259> so<00:01:39.440> we're<00:01:39.560> gonna<00:01:39.680> hit<00:01:39.890> extract<00:01:40.460> here<00:01:40.729> I

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
back so we're gonna hit extract here I

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.580 
back so we're gonna hit extract here I

to<00:04:33.889> start<00:04:34.160> the<00:04:34.250> game<00:04:34.280> with<00:04:34.460> XVM<00:04:35.000> stat<00:04:35.300> from<00:04:35.539> now

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
to start the game with XVM stat from now

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:37.360 
to start the game with XVM stat from now
on<00:04:35.870> not<00:04:36.080> the<00:04:36.289> world<00:04:36.470> of<00:04:36.590> tanks<00:04:36.979> or<00:04:37.130> the<00:04:37.220> world

on not the world of tanks or the world
tanks<00:04:37.639> launcher<00:04:38.000> from<00:04:38.180> XVM<00:04:38.720> stat<00:04:39.400> again<00:04:40.400> if

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
tanks launcher from XVM stat again if

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.240 
tanks launcher from XVM stat again if
you're<00:04:41.150> not<00:04:41.360> using<00:04:41.720> XVM<00:04:42.320> the<00:04:42.710> launcher<00:04:43.100> will

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
you're not using XVM the launcher will

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:44.170 
you're not using XVM the launcher will
do<00:04:43.430> just<00:04:43.669> fine

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
do just fine

do just fine
so<00:04:44.960> if<00:04:45.110> we<00:04:45.260> start<00:04:45.650> the<00:04:45.800> game<00:04:45.830> with<00:04:45.979> axiom<00:04:46.520> stat

00:04:46.779 --> 00:04:46.789 
so if we start the game with axiom stat

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:51.279 
so if we start the game with axiom stat
let's<00:04:47.060> see<00:04:47.270> opens<00:04:47.660> up
