00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:06.359
 hello people and welcome to my 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:09.030
 video to the latest minecraft snapshot 13 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:12.450
 w01 aja from his app schott im 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.910
 2013 comes before the actually 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.400
 promised new means person 1.4 point 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.859
 7 in the launcher online but goes no matter the 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.170
 be forgiven because it's finally over 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.279
 real innovations in minecraft brings 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.260
 this whole version 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.420
 the first innovation is that redstone 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.570
 circuits and pistons in total 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.340
 work more stable and reliable 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.910
 work and some bugs in advance 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.190
 were 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.140
 There are also some new items 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.469
 I'll tell you the asta of it 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.370
 Imagine is the compass 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.770
 the whole 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.960
 maybe the itr of you know something 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:53.960
 that's it's definitely a blog 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:56.520
 Signal part of a circuit of 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.460
 signals compares that means he 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.129
 compares this signal with the two 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.140
 here laterally which is stronger if 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.270
 the signal here is stronger that we 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.310
 then comes back here in the redstone 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.159
 signal forwarded if you 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.530
 lateral once by the two signals 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.450
 the signal is not stronger here 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.240
 forwarded if so save now 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.979
 redstone line will not be here 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.680
 redstone signal more spent 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.350
 the same goes for here or if 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.240
 Both are on because just the two signals 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.400
 stronger than this one because that's it 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.530
 already two blocks is on the way and the 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:37.050
 only one blog if I am now 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:41.390
 sets here far away the torch 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:43.740
 such a torch 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:51.510
 If I continue the torch here now 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:55.080
 is put down here anyway in 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:57.900
 signal forwarded that means like me 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.730
 fully said if the two signals 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.590
 from the side stronger are one of the 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.490
 Both signals will be no signal 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.590
 output 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.300
 it is actually a signal output 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.170
 quite simply here you can still there 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.420
 to adjust 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.520
 depending on whether there is this light on or 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.590
 off is if the signal that comes here 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.080
 just continue to be conducted or 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.610
 whether this should be strengthened yet 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.130
 time and again with full power 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.200
 should be forwarded 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:25.350
 that is exactly what the carpenter and 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.300
 allows new possibilities in 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.820
 Construction of redstone circuits like 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.400
 Let's all this crafting part 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:35.550
 recipe looks like this is on 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:38.610
 the repeater ajar works that way 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.950
 we need for three stones three 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.570
 redstone tortoise and a nice quads 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.630
 and then we get a redstone 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.970
 Compressor and what he said now 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.290
 name quartz yes there is a new one 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.600
 blog in the net 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.790
 next to the normal never stones 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.980
 and these denominator briggs are now available 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:03:00.180
 Also a backwards it will build off 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:03.930
 you get nice quartz out it sees 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:06.209
 so we need nice quartz and that 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.880
 just to build this carpenter else 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.320
 so far there is no point yes then come 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.200
 I'll go to the next update 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:15.270
 funnel yes up here you can buy items 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.430
 throw in for example redstone and 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.720
 here again redstone blog on me 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.459
 will also come back soon 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:24.180
 and then here are the funnel in it 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:27.150
 and if lore or a box under it 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:29.280
 The items are then lost in the 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.110
 Pillow Rhine directly what now unfortunately 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.450
 not working but that's because 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.730
 that the old one is not finished yet 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.480
 you here and now also look down there 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:41.370
 just becomes like the work in progress 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.820
 displayed and if you put that 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.530
 then comes a funnel out of it exactly 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:48.570
 What else is there for items there are here 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.160
 this crate this redstone crate the 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:52.230
 tracklist so the case 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.180
 the box when you open its the 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.870
 you can see redstone signal here now 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.910
 in the background 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.490
 I have this light here 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:05.550
 demonstrate if you have the crate here 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:08.010
 making it the light to also briefly 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.750
 always see the redstone signals 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.640
 triggers also there's a day 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:15.300
 Light sensor so a kind of solar cell ever 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:16.830
 after daylight daytime incidence of light 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.680
 is here in different strengths 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:20.459
 redstone signal sent out 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:28.950
 that means if I am now for example 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:31.110
 night after the set 20.000 so it will be 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:32.610
 this night and the lamp goes off selection 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:37.380
 no redstone signal more comes then 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:39.150
 usually again day and the lamp goes 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:42.900
 you can do it again , for example 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:44.550
 use to know in the cave when 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.620
 day it was high or should be around 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.420
 automatic cooling system to build what 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.980
 protects one from monsters and so on 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:52.950
 There are some uses 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:56.730
 from the whole yes so also so 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:59.280
 a cool update yes what is it then 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:02.220
 still there are these pressure plates 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:05.490
 here they work much like 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:07.680
 normal pressure plates only that measure 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.400
 Can how many items on each of them 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.770
 lie 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:15.810
 I'll take a stack for example 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:17.600
 dirt and 16 stones and then I may 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:21.450
 just the two stacks here easy 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:23.970
 drauflos techno 1 and then we 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:26.040
 here damn the case if nothing stack 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:29.070
 number one and then we have in here 

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:31.800
 two blocks long redstone signal so 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:33.930
 now two times on it and already 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.590
 we have 1 3 blocks long redstone 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.690
 signal 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:39.090
 depending on how many items everyone on it 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:41.100
 puts here is a different 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:43.220
 long redstone signal sent that 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:45.900
 The same is true for this gold plate 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:48.300
 if now three teams on it 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:51.000
 First, a long time is doing more and more items 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.720
 on it and then it will signal 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.760
 live longer and longer 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.560
 depending on how many items on it 

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:58.169
 does this work just as well 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:00.890
 printing plates here are just made of iron 

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:02.780
 and gold tasted 

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:04.190
 and yes 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:06.170
 then there is this redstone here 

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:08.090
 block that is made of redstone 

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:08.810
 and works like a redstone 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:10.490
 torch 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:12.530
 So it can be redstone again 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:14.150
 torch, however, he has the cool 

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:17.810
 property that we move the 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:18.800
 For example, with slopes what 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:22.850
 of course new possibilities 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:26.320
 building in redstone allows and yes 

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:28.580
 to bear his part to Redstone update 

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:30.290
 and then I'm curious what 

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:32.120
 I can still come up with that are 

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:39.140
 First of all, the innovation with the 

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:40.490
 snapshot 12/13 w01 a exactly and it was it 

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:42.080
 from this snapshot again 

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:43.820
 real snapshot with many innovations 

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.180
 Let's see what I think of myself 

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:45.980
 leaves 

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:49.780
 I hope the video has fallen and until 

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:49.780
 to a next video until then Zschau
