but<00:06:44.070> today<00:06:44.310> I<00:06:44.340> thought<00:06:44.670> their<00:06:45.060> passage<00:06:45.480> was

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:45.810 
but today I thought their passage was

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:47.780 
but today I thought their passage was
incisive<00:06:46.440> you<00:06:46.890> know<00:06:47.100> and<00:06:47.280> people<00:06:47.400> are<00:06:47.550> talking

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:47.790 
incisive you know and people are talking

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:49.550 
incisive you know and people are talking

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:51.170 
about they need to replace goals with
Jason<00:06:49.890> Scotland<00:06:50.310> talking<00:06:50.460> about<00:06:50.670> the<00:06:50.880> centre

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:51.180 
Jason Scotland talking about the centre

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:52.940 
Jason Scotland talking about the centre
forward<00:06:51.540> but<00:06:51.960> I<00:06:51.990> think<00:06:52.080> Brendan's<00:06:52.590> replaced

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:52.950 
forward but I think Brendan's replaced

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:55.070 
forward but I think Brendan's replaced
it<00:06:53.100> with<00:06:53.250> me<00:06:53.640> Scott<00:06:53.910> Sinclair<00:06:54.120> and<00:06:54.510> the<00:06:54.870> goals

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:55.080 
it with me Scott Sinclair and the goals

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:57.830 
it with me Scott Sinclair and the goals
that<00:06:55.320> they<00:06:55.740> got<00:06:56.010> this<00:06:56.190> guy<00:06:56.400> was<00:06:56.580> super<00:06:56.840> police

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:57.840 
that they got this guy was super police

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:00.320

and<00:07:00.780> this<00:07:00.870> is<00:07:01.020> just<00:07:01.200> it's<00:07:01.860> a<00:07:01.919> bit<00:07:02.070> of<00:07:02.160> likely<00:07:02.430> a

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:02.460 
and this is just it's a bit of likely a

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:05.420 
and this is just it's a bit of likely a
force<00:07:02.850> to<00:07:03.030> look<00:07:03.510> more<00:07:04.169> but<00:07:04.620> a<00:07:04.650> lovely<00:07:04.919> back<00:07:05.220> and
