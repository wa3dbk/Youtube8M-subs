which is OnStar I think is part of this

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:49.860 
which is OnStar I think is part of this
laptop<00:05:48.400> you<00:05:48.789> put<00:05:49.029> this<00:05:49.150> and<00:05:49.360> they<00:05:49.449> come<00:05:49.659> to<00:05:49.779> you

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:56.740 
switching which is on auto here and if i

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.839 
switching which is on auto here and if i
go<00:05:56.889> to<00:05:57.029> down<00:05:58.029> is<00:05:58.300> stamina<00:05:58.990> and<00:05:59.139> up<00:06:00.099> is<00:06:00.279> 23<00:06:00.819> a

00:06:00.839 --> 00:06:00.849 
go to down is stamina and up is 23 a

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:02.700 
go to down is stamina and up is 23 a
switch<00:06:01.240> it's<00:06:01.539> a<00:06:01.599> three-way<00:06:01.930> switch<00:06:02.169> that's

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:02.710 
switch it's a three-way switch that's

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:05.550 
switch it's a three-way switch that's
neat<00:06:03.009> yeah<00:06:03.490> what<00:06:04.330> would<00:06:04.449> be<00:06:04.569> neater<00:06:04.779> is<00:06:05.020> using

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:05.560 
neat yeah what would be neater is using

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.469 
neat yeah what would be neater is using
the<00:06:05.740> software<00:06:06.099> that<00:06:06.550> comes<00:06:06.699> with<00:06:06.849> in<00:06:07.089> videos

00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:07.479 
the software that comes with in videos

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:09.809 
the software that comes with in videos
new<00:06:07.960> processors<00:06:08.710> but<00:06:08.919> then<00:06:09.129> this<00:06:09.370> one<00:06:09.580> doesn't

00:06:09.809 --> 00:06:09.819 
new processors but then this one doesn't

00:06:09.819 --> 00:06:12.869 
new processors but then this one doesn't
do<00:06:09.909> it<00:06:09.999> so<00:06:10.419> that's<00:06:10.599> the<00:06:10.719> unboxing<00:06:11.610> we<00:06:12.610> got<00:06:12.759> some

00:06:12.869 --> 00:06:12.879 
do it so that's the unboxing we got some

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:15.619 
do it so that's the unboxing we got some
lights<00:06:12.909> here<00:06:13.360> we<00:06:13.509> would<00:06:14.050> like<00:06:14.139> to<00:06:14.169> if<00:06:14.409> we<00:06:14.529> have
