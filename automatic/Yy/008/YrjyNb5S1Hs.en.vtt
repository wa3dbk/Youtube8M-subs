00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.939
 what hello guys the details for 

00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:05.190
 accompany me again here in a video 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.210
 more from gamerland i am mike and we are 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.919
 back here in the section of 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.380
 older mechanisms of consoles for 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:13.290
 the tv 19 this time I bring you a 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.450
 pretty curious mechanism because it's going 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.820
 to allow us to save many processes 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.520
 especially this crippling part of 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.810
 try to cook our food u 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.210
 other materials you already know that the 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.550
 problem of getting material material into 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.710
 the furnaces to be able to burn it after 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.539
 remove them keep a copper is something 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.340
 crushing believe me these with this system 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.380
 guys, we're going to be able to save this 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.540
 type of processes here I have three chests 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.370
 the first chest asks me for the material that 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.690
 will serve as fuel to be able 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.309
 cook our food or any 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.710
 material in this case I will use 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.719
 coal that is a material that needs 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.850
 as fuel the second chest I 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.070
 will allow entering the materials that 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.579
 I want to cook in this case I'm going to put 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.170
 chickens chops and calves and we close 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.690
 this chest and it automatically 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.489
 will begin to transfer two objects to a 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.710
 oven that is down here that is going 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.019
 to see the mechanism so that in the end in 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.880
 this chest guys get the result of 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.190
 all of our foods that are being 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.190
 cooking 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.750
 very easy very compact and you do not need 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.670
 many materials to be able to create 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.620
 what do they do after after the 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.170
 organizer system of objects that has 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.180
 been brutal many entered but now 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.950
 I bring you something light because the 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.180
 truth is very easy to perform already 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.400
 they saw they are cooking all the 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.100
 objects and observe the mechanism guys 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.780
 it's very simple, we're going to be about 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.420
 a few jumpers a few 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:35.000
 hoppers also an oven and a system 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.680
 pretty peculiar watch guys so 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.930
 the truth to create this system is going to 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.750
 save many processes and the truth we 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:44.990
 will speed up the burn part and 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.400
 that is cooking our food 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.480
 guys so I hope you can 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.100
 copy watching this video because the 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.960
 true 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.910
 it's going to be very cool how can 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.030
 observe the example that I have just 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:58.729
 show is all the circuitry 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.020
 from the outside is exposed but thanks 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:01.580
 what is so compact we can 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.930
 hide underground and to do this 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.750
 it's very simple we have to make a 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.820
 excavation five by five with one 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.920
 maximum depth of three blocks is worth 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.380
 guys, now we're going to find 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.730
 right in the middle or be one two and 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.769
 three instance blocks 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.360
 and right here we are going to place a 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:19.519
 welder but the jumper to be 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.530
 pointing up in this way 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:23.480
 then we are going to place a hopper that 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.790
 point towards the soldering iron and on top of that 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.739
 welder we are going to place an oven 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.260
 remember to be crouched to be able 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:32.150
 place the objects now in that oven 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.299
 let's place another one that points 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.940
 towards this and on top of these two objects 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:40.700
 we are going to place another hopper that points to 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.459
 this hopper and another that points towards the 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.920
 oven and finally we're going to add other 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:49.610
 two welders compute up 1 and 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.799
 2 perfect we will have the system 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:55.400
 transfer of objects that go between 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:57.620
 between the oven and the chests is good 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.359
 once the system is done now we are going to 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.609
 place the chests but it is important 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:03.410
 that place them in this order the coffer 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:06.049
 trap has to be exactly in 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.030
 medium and the other two normal chests in 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:10.190
 the corners in this way the chest of 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.569
 in the middle when you enter an object will send 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.730
 a stop network signal so that it 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:15.049
 transfer to the oven and the others 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.879
 chests will be functioning for a 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:18.980
 clock system and right now we're going to create 

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:20.240
 Now let's create the clock system 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.520
 which is the one that will allow back 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.110
 and the objects of the chest to the oven and 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.660
 oven to the chest the truth is a system 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.370
 very simple let's go in this part 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.780
 that we are facing, we are going to go to 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.120
 the back and in the second 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.950
 welder we are going to place a torch of 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.530
 networks above santurtzi we are going to 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:38.780
 place a block and two other blocks 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:41.240
 down here is worth those two blocks we are going to 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.790
 place repeaters like this and 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.890
 let's give a tick to each of this 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:48.470
 way vouchers guys we're doing really well now 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.690
 here we are going to place two blocks you 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:53.600
 let's remove one here down perfect 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:55.700
 we put here one in the middle and two others 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.050
 up but let's remove the one below 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.420
 in this way it is worth and here we are going to 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:01.760
 place another repeater with a tick of 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.350
 difference well from this chest of 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:07.160
 next side let's place a block 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:09.290
 here below another above and another below 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.630
 here we are going to place another repeater with 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:14.570
 a tick of difference and here we go to 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:16.400
 place in the last a little red ton 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:19.739
 and already with these guys we would be creating 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.810
 our clock system that will allow 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:24.539
 is the transfer of objects 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.910
 chest to the oven and from the oven to the chest and 

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:28.860
 vinci that we would have with this our 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.419
 automatic kiln system already 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.190
 it's just a matter of covering the 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:34.620
 circuitry and even here put a 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.910
 block that did not correspond to the grass but 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.560
 you can place a block for 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.750
 that combines with your floor there is no 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.699
 problem we just open the 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.710
 first chest that will allow us to enter 

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:45.509
 the fuel that in this case was 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.039
 coal the second will be the materials 

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:49.259
 that we are going to burn like in the previous 

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:51.180
 example I showed you pure meals now 

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:53.099
 I'm going to show you how to burn the 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:55.050
 minerals worth we incorporate the 

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:56.880
 minerals we close the chest go 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.490
 we just open the third to see 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:01.050
 the result of our system of 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:03.449
 furnaces that the truth is very simple very 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.250
 easy to make and very compact because the 

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:08.300
 you can not see that he had so much 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:11.960
 circuitry true guys 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:14.509
 there it is and I was already scared girls 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:17.629
 this system can help you a lot 

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:19.610
 to be able to burn your objects that 

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:21.349
 have on your map survival 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:24.110
 you can really create this system several 

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:27.259
 sometimes although of course there is one more version 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:29.680
 industrial a little more professional by 

00:05:27.259 --> 00:05:33.259
 so to say to create a more system 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.909
 broad burning of materials the boys 

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:36.560
 but we'll be watching it 

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:38.900
 soon here in the channel while 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:41.270
 I break my head so I can create 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.830
 that mechanism in boy the truth is a 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:45.199
 very simple system I hope you have them 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:46.340
 liked if it was like that like share with 

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:49.219
 your friends so they have this system 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:50.509
 of automatic ovens in their worlds and 

00:05:49.219 --> 00:05:51.860
 also subscribe if here in the channel 

00:05:50.509 --> 00:05:54.409
 gamerland because he will be bringing a lot 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:57.349
 content of these mechanisms atheist 

00:05:54.409 --> 00:06:00.669
 19 so I'll see you soon I'm 

00:05:57.349 --> 00:06:00.669
 mckee and take care 

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:09.250
 i 

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:33.120
 we are worth 

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:45.879
 because look 

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:02.850
 and
