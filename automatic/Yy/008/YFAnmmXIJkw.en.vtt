00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.540 
end and middle on top but all in here is
all<00:00:20.160> wood<00:00:20.810> not<00:00:21.810> what<00:00:22.140> applied<00:00:22.500> to<00:00:22.800> metal<00:00:23.130> just

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
all wood not what applied to metal just

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.810 
all wood not what applied to metal just
a<00:00:23.760> solid<00:00:24.480> wood<00:00:24.720> piece<00:00:25.730> so<00:00:27.439> let's<00:00:28.439> look<00:00:28.650> at<00:00:28.890> the

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
a solid wood piece so let's look at the

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:37.959 
a solid wood piece so let's look at the
nib<00:00:32.660> the<00:00:33.660> nib<00:00:33.989> is<00:00:35.899> just<00:00:36.899> a<00:00:36.989> stainless<00:00:37.500> steel

00:00:37.959 --> 00:00:37.969 
nib the nib is just a stainless steel

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:41.510 
nib the nib is just a stainless steel
nib<00:00:38.969> but<00:00:39.420> I<00:00:39.450> will<00:00:39.809> say<00:00:40.079> it's<00:00:40.410> medium<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.309> it's

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
nib but I will say it's medium and it's

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.110 
nib but I will say it's medium and it's
smooth<00:00:42.030> as<00:00:42.360> god-knows-what<00:00:43.430> it<00:00:44.430> has<00:00:45.090> a

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
smooth as god-knows-what it has a

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.529 
smooth as god-knows-what it has a
breathing<00:00:45.750> hole<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:46.530> I<00:00:47.430> will<00:00:47.730> show<00:00:47.969> you<00:00:48.000> how

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
breathing hole and I will show you how

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.520 
breathing hole and I will show you how
it<00:00:48.750> writes<00:00:49.050> in<00:00:49.500> my<00:00:49.920> writing<00:00:50.219> sample<00:00:50.640> is<00:00:51.480> you<00:00:52.350> if

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
it writes in my writing sample is you if

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.400 
it writes in my writing sample is you if
you<00:00:52.739> can<00:00:52.949> notice<00:00:53.280> here<00:00:53.750> this<00:00:54.750> is<00:00:54.870> a<00:00:54.989> relatively

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
you can notice here this is a relatively

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.740 
you can notice here this is a relatively
small<00:00:56.600> writing<00:00:57.600> section<00:00:58.789> and<00:00:59.789> it's<00:01:00.059> somewhat

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
small writing section and it's somewhat

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.520 
small writing section and it's somewhat
sharp<00:01:01.109> too<00:01:01.530> so<00:01:02.010> when<00:01:02.879> I<00:01:03.000> write<00:01:03.359> I<00:01:03.719> don't<00:01:04.379> hold

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
sharp too so when I write I don't hold

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.080 
sharp too so when I write I don't hold
the<00:01:04.680> pencil<00:01:06.680> above<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.799> pencil<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.729> fountain

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
the pencil above the pencil the fountain

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.000 
the pencil above the pencil the fountain
pad<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.360> little<00:01:09.630> bit<00:01:09.840> higher<00:01:10.080> up<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.770> get<00:01:10.979> a

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
pad a little bit higher up to get a

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.850 
pad a little bit higher up to get a
smoother<00:01:11.700> surface<00:01:12.380> rather<00:01:13.380> than<00:01:13.619> writing

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
smoother surface rather than writing

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.969 
smoother surface rather than writing
closer<00:01:14.490> here<00:01:15.180> then<00:01:15.600> you<00:01:15.840> have<00:01:15.869> this<00:01:16.759> this<00:01:17.759> lip

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
closer here then you have this this lip

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:22.179 
closer here then you have this this lip
bothering<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.490> cutting<00:01:20.880> into<00:01:21.150> your<00:01:21.270> finger

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:22.189 
bothering and cutting into your finger

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:27.230 
bothering and cutting into your finger
now<00:01:23.189> let's<00:01:23.430> look<00:01:23.580> at<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:24.150> inside<00:01:25.939> the<00:01:26.939> feed

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
now let's look at the inside the feed

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.340 
now let's look at the inside the feed
and<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:28.439> system<00:01:28.829> that<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:29.009> use<00:01:29.990> to<00:01:30.990> feed<00:01:31.200> the

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
and the system that I use to feed the

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.460 
and the system that I use to feed the
ink<00:01:31.500> I<00:01:31.860> personally<00:01:32.640> use<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:33.240> cartridge

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
ink I personally use a cartridge

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.359 
ink I personally use a cartridge
not<00:01:34.829> a<00:01:34.860> cartridge<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:36.530> converter<00:01:37.530> that<00:01:37.650> I<00:01:37.890> got

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
not a cartridge a converter that I got

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.770 
not a cartridge a converter that I got
for<00:01:38.670> about<00:01:38.880> nine<00:01:39.390> cents<00:01:41.090> and<00:01:42.090> it<00:01:42.570> works

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
for about nine cents and it works

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.520 
for about nine cents and it works
relatively<00:01:43.290> well<00:01:45.020> right<00:01:46.020> now<00:01:46.200> I'm<00:01:46.350> using

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
relatively well right now I'm using

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.109 
relatively well right now I'm using

water Bend serenity blue so that action

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.149 
water Bend serenity blue so that action
works<00:01:51.299> extremely<00:01:52.079> well<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:52.649> want<00:01:52.829> to<00:01:52.920> show

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:07.489 
really gonna work all wood inside but

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:11.920 
really gonna work all wood inside but
it's<00:02:08.489> all<00:02:08.670> wood<00:02:08.849> inside<00:02:09.239> which<00:02:09.479> is<00:02:09.629> very<00:02:09.869> nice

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
it's all wood inside which is very nice

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.640 
it's all wood inside which is very nice
just<00:02:12.930> reassemble<00:02:13.590> the<00:02:13.650> pen<00:02:14.630> also<00:02:15.630> having<00:02:16.530> it

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
just reassemble the pen also having it

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.850 
just reassemble the pen also having it
having<00:02:17.160> it<00:02:17.370> being<00:02:17.610> wood<00:02:18.440> it's<00:02:19.440> kind<00:02:19.770> of

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
having it being wood it's kind of

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.920 
having it being wood it's kind of
problematic<00:02:20.280> because<00:02:21.060> I<00:02:21.360> don't<00:02:21.660> know<00:02:21.780> if<00:02:21.840> you

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
problematic because I don't know if you

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.780 
problematic because I don't know if you
guys<00:02:22.080> who's<00:02:22.320> you<00:02:22.500> guys<00:02:22.680> can<00:02:22.830> see<00:02:23.070> that<00:02:23.100> that

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
guys who's you guys can see that that

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.520 
guys who's you guys can see that that
blue<00:02:24.210> is<00:02:24.510> from<00:02:25.260> the<00:02:25.380> ink<00:02:25.590> and<00:02:26.780> you<00:02:27.780> don't<00:02:28.200> want

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
blue is from the ink and you don't want

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.300 
blue is from the ink and you don't want
it<00:02:28.650> to<00:02:28.770> soak<00:02:29.070> into<00:02:29.340> the<00:02:29.610> to<00:02:30.540> the<00:02:30.690> wood<00:02:30.960> even

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
it to soak into the to the wood even

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.510 
it to soak into the to the wood even
though<00:02:32.310> it<00:02:32.430> has<00:02:32.670> a<00:02:33.500> protective<00:02:34.500> coating<00:02:35.340> over

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
though it has a protective coating over

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.170 
though it has a protective coating over
it

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
it

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.540 
it
due<00:02:36.780> to<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:37.080> oils<00:02:37.440> with<00:02:37.530> your<00:02:37.680> hands<00:02:38.280> you

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
due to the oils with your hands you

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.160 
due to the oils with your hands you
probably<00:02:38.910> will<00:02:39.030> wash<00:02:39.240> that<00:02:39.570> protective

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
probably will wash that protective

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.540 
probably will wash that protective
coating<00:02:40.650> off<00:02:40.830> eventually<00:02:41.820> and<00:02:42.060> then<00:02:42.300> any

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
coating off eventually and then any

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.050 
coating off eventually and then any
colorations

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060

was<00:03:44.880> amazed<00:03:45.360> to<00:03:45.630> view<00:03:45.990> the<00:03:46.170> quickness<00:03:46.470> and

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
was amazed to view the quickness and

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:55.490 
was amazed to view the quickness and
dexterity<00:03:47.310> of<00:03:47.670> the<00:03:47.970> juggler<00:03:53.900> you<00:03:54.900> can<00:03:55.080> hear<00:03:55.470> a

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
dexterity of the juggler you can hear a

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.920 
dexterity of the juggler you can hear a
little<00:03:55.980> reverb<00:03:57.560> but<00:03:58.560> trust<00:03:59.520> me<00:03:59.730> this<00:04:00.540> fountain

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
little reverb but trust me this fountain

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:26.510 
little reverb but trust me this fountain
pen<00:04:01.290> is<00:04:01.500> very<00:04:05.210> very

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.760 

probably<00:04:27.520> one<00:04:27.730> of<00:04:27.760> the<00:04:28.560> more<00:04:29.560> enjoyable

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
probably one of the more enjoyable

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:44.400 
probably one of the more enjoyable
fountain<00:04:30.760> pens<00:04:31.120> that<00:04:31.450> I<00:04:32.110> write<00:04:32.800> with<00:04:43.200> see<00:04:44.200> the

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
fountain pens that I write with see the

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.020 
fountain pens that I write with see the
public<00:04:44.710> is<00:04:44.860> amazed<00:04:45.160> to<00:04:45.400> view<00:04:45.580> the<00:04:45.790> quickness

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
public is amazed to view the quickness

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.990 
public is amazed to view the quickness
and<00:04:46.360> the<00:04:46.419> dexterity<00:04:46.900> of<00:04:47.169> the<00:04:47.530> juggler<00:04:47.980> now<00:04:48.760> I'm

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
and the dexterity of the juggler now I'm

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.620 
and the dexterity of the juggler now I'm
still<00:04:49.360> a<00:04:49.389> little<00:04:49.660> line<00:04:49.840> variation<00:04:51.270> if<00:04:52.270> it

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:52.630 
still a little line variation if it

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:55.350 
still a little line variation if it
allows<00:04:52.840> it<00:04:53.110> to<00:04:53.140> so<00:04:53.860> this<00:04:54.040> is<00:04:54.190> a<00:04:54.220> thick<00:04:54.580> line<00:04:54.850> and

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
allows it to so this is a thick line and

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:10.500 
allows it to so this is a thick line and
this<00:04:55.780> is<00:04:55.840> a<00:04:56.400> thin<00:04:57.400> line<00:04:57.669> so<00:05:03.960> thick<00:05:07.800> thin<00:05:09.390> and<00:05:10.390> I

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:10.510 
this is a thin line so thick thin and I

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:11.820 
this is a thin line so thick thin and I
guess<00:05:10.720> you<00:05:10.870> can<00:05:11.020> see<00:05:11.229> a<00:05:11.260> little<00:05:11.620> line

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
guess you can see a little line

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.969 
guess you can see a little line
variation<00:05:12.250> not<00:05:12.910> much<00:05:13.210> the<00:05:13.840> nib<00:05:14.050> is<00:05:14.080> not<00:05:14.440> the

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:14.979 
variation not much the nib is not the

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:18.180 
variation not much the nib is not the
most<00:05:15.160> flexible<00:05:15.700> but<00:05:15.880> it's<00:05:16.060> not<00:05:16.240> the<00:05:16.419> most<00:05:17.190> so

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:18.190 
most flexible but it's not the most so

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:20.730 
most flexible but it's not the most so
I'm<00:05:18.430> still<00:05:18.639> a<00:05:18.669> little<00:05:18.790> shading<00:05:19.180> and<00:05:19.660> this<00:05:20.440> pen

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:20.740 
I'm still a little shading and this pen

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:24.270 
I'm still a little shading and this pen
will<00:05:21.070> lay<00:05:21.400> down<00:05:21.430> a<00:05:22.120> nice<00:05:22.710> consistent<00:05:23.710> line<00:05:23.950> the

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:24.280 
will lay down a nice consistent line the

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:29.990 
will lay down a nice consistent line the
whole<00:05:24.490> time<00:05:25.260> no<00:05:26.260> need<00:05:26.560> to<00:05:26.979> ever<00:05:27.850> worry<00:05:28.600> about

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 
whole time no need to ever worry about

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.320 
whole time no need to ever worry about
about<00:05:31.000> that<00:05:31.330> aspect<00:05:31.840> of<00:05:31.990> the<00:05:32.140> pen<00:05:32.380> and<00:05:33.100> I'm<00:05:34.030> not

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:34.330 
about that aspect of the pen and I'm not

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:38.820 
about that aspect of the pen and I'm not
a<00:05:34.360> big<00:05:34.600> calligraphy<00:05:35.200> fan<00:05:35.440> so<00:05:35.919> I<00:05:36.479> went<00:05:37.479> and<00:05:38.020> I'm

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:38.830 
a big calligraphy fan so I went and I'm

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:42.210 
a big calligraphy fan so I went and I'm
not<00:05:39.190> a<00:05:39.220> big<00:05:39.370> leaguer<00:05:39.669> if<00:05:39.760> a<00:05:40.590> calligraphy<00:05:41.590> fan

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:42.220 
not a big leaguer if a calligraphy fan

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:46.409 
not a big leaguer if a calligraphy fan
the<00:05:42.910> little<00:05:43.210> duh<00:05:44.310> but<00:05:45.310> I<00:05:45.340> can<00:05:45.729> I<00:05:45.910> would<00:05:46.180> think

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:46.419 
the little duh but I can I would think

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:47.909 
the little duh but I can I would think
that<00:05:46.539> this<00:05:46.810> one<00:05:46.990> will<00:05:47.140> be<00:05:47.320> the<00:05:47.350> best<00:05:47.440> for

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:47.919 
that this one will be the best for

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:50.100 
that this one will be the best for
calligraphy<00:05:48.220> because<00:05:48.760> of<00:05:48.880> the<00:05:49.080> variation<00:05:50.080> the

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
calligraphy because of the variation the

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.590 
calligraphy because of the variation the
line<00:05:50.350> variation<00:05:50.650> that<00:05:51.039> has<00:05:51.520> maybe<00:05:52.270> if<00:05:52.479> it<00:05:52.570> had

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:52.600 
line variation that has maybe if it had

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.740 
line variation that has maybe if it had
more<00:05:53.850> it'll<00:05:54.850> be<00:05:54.970> better<00:05:55.180> for<00:05:55.450> calligraphy

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:55.750 
more it'll be better for calligraphy

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:59.909 
more it'll be better for calligraphy
this<00:05:56.169> is<00:05:56.320> probably<00:05:56.800> just<00:05:57.539> fun<00:05:58.539> pen<00:05:58.960> and<00:05:59.200> also

00:05:59.909 --> 00:05:59.919 
this is probably just fun pen and also

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:01.380 
this is probably just fun pen and also
if<00:06:00.039> you<00:06:00.190> want<00:06:00.430> to<00:06:00.520> make<00:06:00.729> this<00:06:00.880> close<00:06:01.120> this

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:01.390 
if you want to make this close this

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:03.360 
if you want to make this close this
pentacle<00:06:01.870> give<00:06:02.020> you<00:06:02.080> food<00:06:02.260> pen<00:06:02.620> you<00:06:02.830> could<00:06:03.100> not

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:03.370 
pentacle give you food pen you could not

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:05.900 
pentacle give you food pen you could not
because<00:06:03.820> the<00:06:04.330> nibs<00:06:04.660> are<00:06:04.870> not<00:06:05.200> interchangeable

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:05.910 
because the nibs are not interchangeable

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:09.180 
because the nibs are not interchangeable
so<00:06:06.910> I<00:06:06.940> hope<00:06:07.419> you<00:06:07.570> all<00:06:07.600> enjoyed<00:06:08.410> this<00:06:08.860> review
