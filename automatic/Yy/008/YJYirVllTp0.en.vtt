00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:06.150
 hello good friends to all and welcome 

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:08.340
 to a magic video more today I bring you 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.170
 another magic trick with cards but not 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.110
 any trick but I bring you 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.630
 the first magic trick that I acquired is 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.789
 a very good trick the truth is that what 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.859
 I keep making people and people 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.669
 Surprise but also how easy it is 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.679
 sometimes it does not go well at all so 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:27.630
 now I will do it soon and 

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:32.309
 If someone wants it revealed what 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:34.680
 I will reveal and hope you like it and we will 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.740
 start with the effect 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.440
 let's start with the effect first thing 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:43.260
 what we have to do is take out the 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.270
 game of the case the truth is that it is 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.370
 a deck that I love very recently 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.140
 I have them and they go very well 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.660
 soon I will surely make reviews of 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.870
 these decks because many many magicians 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:59.510
 they do it and I think it's very well said 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.510
 this we are going to start doing 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.310
 perfect and now what we have to 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.680
 do is give two letters to the viewer 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.440
 for example you are 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.650
 these 2 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:16.410
 and now we are going to extend 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.000
 the letters now let's say that a 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.140
 viewer put a letter where 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.400
 want 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:27.710
 and another letter wherever you want 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.710
 let's put them 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.400
 let's mix a little 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:40.030
 I have done this we have already mixed 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:48.909
 this movement we draw two letters that 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:51.580
 are the two cards chosen by the 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:53.140
 viewer is a very easy trick of 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.720
 do I hope that many people have 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.399
 seen how it's done and it's a very trick 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.400
 easy so many people can do it 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:02.440
 soon I will reveal 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.870
 If someone does not know, I hope you 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:08.040
 like and subscribe if we see one 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:08.040
