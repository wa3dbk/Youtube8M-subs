00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 hello youtuber os this is my second 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.150
 tutorial and I bring you a light but 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.910
 powerful program to accelerate the 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:12.450
 processor and as they say there or see 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:15.000
 block it then I tell you this program 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.960
 it's from 2009 and it came on a record that brought 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.029
 my pc is called getting 22 actually 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.340
 the program is from the brand us rock very 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.250
 recognized for making motherboards 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.460
 more than one must know her of course 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.949
 this program is 100% safe does not burn the 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.469
 processor does not overheat and is very 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.500
 efficient I say it from my own experience 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.629
 but as always there is one but the only 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.420
 problem is that this program only serves 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.520
 for rock platforms or just 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.100
 works with motherboards 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.320
 rock brands I tell you in all safety 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.420
 do not be afraid because I marked the pc because 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.760
 does not pass this program comes graduated 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.430
 so that it does not happen is the incredible and 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.050
 exciting the program as always 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.649
 I will leave the download limit in the 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:04.309
 good video description let's start 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:04.309
 we download the program 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:23.369
 we open the tunnel we give you next again 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:23.369
 next and install 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.960
 I have a program called cpu zeta 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.510
 which serves to see all the processing 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.820
 of the pc apart from telling you all the 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:52.400
 information from your pc from the speed 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.200
 from the processor to the voltage I'll use it 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.820
 to verify that the program does not 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.820
 is lying or is a farce 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.690
 notice this number is not going to change 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:16.849
 because that's how the processor comes 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.849
 2.70 megahertz defect 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.040
 but here it tells us the speed of 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:26.010
 processor that is what matters 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.690
 2,693 point 54 megahertz notice that it is 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.870
 the same speed that marks us 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.940
 program get sloot system I ask you 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.190
 please do not mess with this anymore 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.870
 that this controls the temperature of the cpu 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.989
 apart from other things 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.870
 aluar monitor do not mess with this either 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:45.000
 control voltage either you already know 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.000
 what is it good for but none of this is going to 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.820
 use so leave it like this 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.170
 overclocking this is what we will use 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.720
 notice now we should only increase 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.550
 where it says cpu frequent because it's the 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.310
 that increases the speed of the processor 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.590
 eye do not increase or decrease pce 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.569
 frequent because it controls the network and if 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.060
 we move even a little bit we will not have 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:07.950
 internet if you move it you will have to restart 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.890
 the pc and ready it returns to its normal state 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.780
 where it says s &amp; p radio is to multiply 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.300
 the mega hertz but it's coming to the maximum 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.950
 so you can not increase in this 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.019
 part that says on and off is so that 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.150
 when you restart your shutdown the pc to 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:23.940
 turn on the program start with the pc 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:27.450
 the normal frequency in my case is 2 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:29.870
 and the rise up to 225 and they give you where 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.870
 says go 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:41.530
 and ready my 2.70 giga hertz processor 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:44.170
 it happened to be now one of 3 gigas erc 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:47.650
 we see that the cpu z tells us that the 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:51.760
 speed has increased from 2,693 points 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:54.580
 63 megahertz to 3,040 point 53 megahertz 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.290
 good friends I will give you a piece of advice 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.420
 increase the frequency of 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:01.210
 processor because it will not stand 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:03.610
 so much they are not going to burn so no 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:05.950
 worry if in any case they reach 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:08.530
 increase 30 times more and the processor does not 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.630
 it endures calm because the pc 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.940
 Restart and ready you will return to your state 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:16.180
 normal try to increase what they can 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:18.010
 without exceeding I only increase it 25 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.870
 times and that's enough for me if they want 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.970
 put your processor back with the 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:24.250
 frequency of before they only lower the 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:27.160
 often as it was before or what 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:29.530
 they start the pc mine was in 200 of 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.990
 factory so I put it back in 200 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.970
 by the way where it says on and off is for 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:36.070
 when you want to start the pc and 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:39.130
 that the program increases the speed of 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:41.230
 processor automatically is to say yes 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:43.030
 they leave it on when turning off the PC or 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:45.340
 restart it when they turn it on 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.110
 program will start with the PC increasing 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.450
 automatically the frequency that 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:51.580
 you have put if you do not want it 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:53.920
 so just leave it off, I'll leave the 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:57.040
 limit the program for systems of 32 and 

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:59.860
 64 bits, good friends, that's all 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.600
 Anything not forget me know 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.270
 I recommend the program because it is 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:06.760
 100% safe and I only recommend programs 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:11.040
 effective and safe hand up 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:11.040
