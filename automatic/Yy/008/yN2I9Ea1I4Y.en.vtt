 first of a long series 

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:16.029
 we receive a lot of letters from our 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.380
 Belgian friends and because the Belgians are 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:19.390
 already come to the construction sites in France 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.769
 I wanted to come 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.060
 help 

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:24.160
 here is a family here in belgium so 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.609
 so his buttocks and I'm glad it's 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.009
 a pure happiness 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:28.630
 since the passing of a storm in 2010 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:31.119
 home jean him laughing me it 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.590
 was completely ravaged desperate the 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:34.420
 family was able to count on the 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.610
 determining friends so that the show 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.949
 stop at home that we are without good 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:42.690
 heard the situation of jean luc and 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:45.059
 Muriel we absolutely wanted 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.520
 pick up i'm going to say a little bit 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.870
 the inaccessible in our French neighbors 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.030
 and I think that after multiple 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.649
 attempts we got there and 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.390
 today it's thanks and an army of 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:56.500
 volunteers and suppliers that the 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.440
 work can begin 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:02.440
 I am the neighbor of jean-luc muriel 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.600
 drown sacha so we're here could say 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.860
 what can we do we will 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:11.940
 do and there we are moving 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:14.680
 there all that remained in the house and 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.330
 the first matches written at the start 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.860
 to arrive and many more than us 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.200
 have been contacted a few 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.090
 weeks now by tf1 so that's 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.649
 with pleasure a soul we tried 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.080
 to meet their needs and therefore 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:27.789
 actually we have here their 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.800
 provide all that is materials of 

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:30.539
 shell and finish all that 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.320
 free 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:34.119
 obviously this is the principle 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.100
 actually complete solidarity 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:36.640
 so actually it's totally 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.229
 Free 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.360
 the team now has three weeks 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:41.590
 to make miracles like at each 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.890
 times the yards lasts two to three 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.410
 weeks 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.939
 sometimes 4 turbo galley we'll see 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.560
 because knew that the presently there 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:48.790
 are there anyway things that are 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.770
 are not done correctly in the 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.360
 house his windows there will have been asked 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.890
 only with expansive foam 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.810
 see the carpenters who are in the process 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.490
 to disassemble and remove all the most 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.590
 all the foam around the 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.380
 bastides windows and that in general it is 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.549
 with these with hooks fasteners 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.720
 in the wall in the stone to make 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:06.640
 first hold the window and then 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.500
 isolated with expansive foam and well 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.729
 this is yes, a result is that there 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.350
 today we have windows that have 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.579
 been asked micmacs of moss and that's 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.709
 completely out of the ordinary so we have to 

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:15.510
 resume everything but I have an army they 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:18.940
 are motivated 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:22.000
 no no it's true that the Belgians I 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.620
 was aware but he proves me there in 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.060
 being numerous and motivated on motivated 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.739
 yes we are going to do very beautiful 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.959
 things in three weeks they are 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:29.700
 able to work miracles and they 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.600
 will arrive 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.459
 question do you have a call 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.019
 announced at the volunteer level at 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:36.430
 level of materials where you go enough 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:37.600
 for the moment we have first 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:37.989
 primers in materials but it's the nerve 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.390
 of the war 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:42.100
 because it's true that I'm leaving for 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.209
 the urgency of life to the vital minimum of 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.260
 allows them to go home if we 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.690
 can go further with elements 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.109
 decoration with furniture etc well 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.109
 willingly
