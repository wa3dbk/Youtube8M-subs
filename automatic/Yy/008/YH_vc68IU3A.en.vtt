hey guys now I'm going to grill a pizza
I<00:00:07.410> didn't<00:00:07.890> make<00:00:08.010> it<00:00:08.220> it's<00:00:08.400> from<00:00:08.970> Papa<00:00:09.330> Murphy's

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:11.269 
I didn't make it it's from Papa Murphy's

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:15.650 
I didn't make it it's from Papa Murphy's
so<00:00:12.269> I'm<00:00:12.509> just<00:00:12.690> using<00:00:12.870> lump<00:00:13.320> charcoal<00:00:14.070> here<00:00:14.660> and

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
so I'm just using lump charcoal here and

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.300 
so I'm just using lump charcoal here and
I'm<00:00:15.780> just<00:00:15.929> gonna<00:00:16.080> put<00:00:16.260> off<00:00:16.440> on<00:00:16.680> one<00:00:16.890> side<00:00:19.310> half

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
I'm just gonna put off on one side half

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:37.310 
I'm just gonna put off on one side half
on<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.670> other<00:00:20.820> side<00:00:35.809> spread<00:00:36.809> these<00:00:36.960> holes

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
on the other side spread these holes

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:48.500 
on the other side spread these holes
evenly<00:00:46.370> I'll<00:00:47.370> give<00:00:47.700> this<00:00:47.789> a<00:00:47.940> few<00:00:48.149> more<00:00:48.329> minutes

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
evenly I'll give this a few more minutes

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.160 
evenly I'll give this a few more minutes
because<00:00:49.309> the<00:00:50.309> bottom<00:00:50.760> of<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.600> chimney<00:00:51.930> was

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
because the bottom of the chimney was

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.389 
because the bottom of the chimney was
hotter<00:00:52.469> than<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.829> top<00:00:53.039> of<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.219> chimney

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
hotter than the top of the chimney

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.310 
hotter than the top of the chimney
something<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:54.000> get<00:00:54.059> this<00:00:54.270> side<00:00:54.510> time<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:55.140> kind

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
something to get this side time to kind

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.990 
something to get this side time to kind
of<00:00:55.379> heat<00:00:55.530> up<00:00:55.559> so<00:00:55.890> we<00:00:56.010> have<00:00:56.100> even<00:00:56.399> weak<00:00:56.579> heating

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
of heat up so we have even weak heating
