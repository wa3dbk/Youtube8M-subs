00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
them out they sure do well the game plan

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.670 
them out they sure do well the game plan
is<00:00:55.320> first<00:00:55.770> that<00:00:56.300> we're<00:00:57.300> going<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.680> stabilize

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
is first that we're going to stabilize

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.229 
is first that we're going to stabilize
and<00:00:59.010> secure<00:00:59.460> the<00:01:00.210> red<00:01:00.449> spire<00:01:01.250> you<00:01:02.250> can<00:01:02.489> look

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
and secure the red spire you can look

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.520 
and secure the red spire you can look
and<00:01:03.600> see<00:01:03.870> that<00:01:03.899> some<00:01:04.739> of<00:01:04.769> that<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:06.570> bottom

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
and see that some of that the the bottom

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.030 
and see that some of that the the bottom
of<00:01:07.650> that<00:01:07.860> is<00:01:08.130> not<00:01:08.820> resting<00:01:09.330> on<00:01:09.450> soil<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:10.170> so

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
of that is not resting on soil and so

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.429 
of that is not resting on soil and so
one<00:01:11.670> of<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.880> first<00:01:12.510> game<00:01:12.750> plan<00:01:13.020> will<00:01:13.229> be<00:01:13.320> to

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
one of the first game plan will be to

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.469 
one of the first game plan will be to
stabilize<00:01:13.950> that<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.490> then<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:14.729> stabilize<00:01:15.240> the

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
stabilize that and then to stabilize the

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.359 
stabilize that and then to stabilize the
area<00:01:15.659> around<00:01:16.759> around<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.479> sinkhole<00:01:18.960> and

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
area around around the the sinkhole and

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:22.219 
area around around the the sinkhole and
we<00:01:20.369> estimate<00:01:20.970> our<00:01:21.030> construction<00:01:21.840> management

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
we estimate our construction management

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.200 
we estimate our construction management
firm<00:01:22.650> estimates<00:01:22.860> that'll<00:01:23.460> take<00:01:23.610> about<00:01:23.759> ten

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
firm estimates that'll take about ten

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.330 
firm estimates that'll take about ten
days<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:24.750> then<00:01:25.560> they're<00:01:25.740> looking<00:01:26.070> at<00:01:26.189> two

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
days and then they're looking at two

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.190 
days and then they're looking at two
different<00:01:26.729> ways<00:01:26.850> with<00:01:27.150> regard<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:27.600> extracting

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
different ways with regard to extracting

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.620 
different ways with regard to extracting
the<00:01:28.380> car<00:01:28.790> you<00:01:29.790> know<00:01:29.909> if<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.150> look<00:01:30.329> at<00:01:30.450> the

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
the car you know if you look at the

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.480 
the car you know if you look at the
SkyDome<00:01:30.900> from<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.439> outside<00:01:31.890> it<00:01:32.100> has<00:01:32.130> those

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
SkyDome from the outside it has those

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.569 
SkyDome from the outside it has those
big<00:01:32.700> yellow<00:01:33.200> panels<00:01:34.200> on<00:01:34.439> it<00:01:34.619> so<00:01:34.950> one<00:01:35.369> thought

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
big yellow panels on it so one thought

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.670 
big yellow panels on it so one thought
is<00:01:35.790> to<00:01:36.000> remove<00:01:36.299> some<00:01:36.689> of<00:01:36.810> those<00:01:36.930> panels<00:01:37.259> and

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
is to remove some of those panels and

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.130 
is to remove some of those panels and
let<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.820> crane<00:01:39.119> then<00:01:40.189> hang<00:01:41.189> down<00:01:41.430> from

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
let the crane then hang down from

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.620 
let the crane then hang down from
sticking<00:01:43.140> over<00:01:43.530> into<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.100> into<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.149> museum

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
sticking over into the into the museum

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.560 
sticking over into the into the museum
the<00:01:45.810> other<00:01:46.220> option<00:01:47.220> is<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.430> come<00:01:48.119> down<00:01:48.299> from

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
the other option is to come down from

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.370 
the other option is to come down from
the<00:01:48.689> top<00:01:49.020> we<00:01:49.770> do<00:01:49.950> have<00:01:50.189> a<00:01:50.220> level<00:01:50.759> flat<00:01:51.380> about

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
the top we do have a level flat about

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.889 
the top we do have a level flat about
probably<00:01:52.799> about<00:01:52.950> another<00:01:53.100> 40-foot<00:01:53.899> section

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
probably about another 40-foot section

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.499 
probably about another 40-foot section
up<00:01:55.049> there<00:01:55.079> that<00:01:55.979> could<00:01:56.280> be<00:01:56.430> opened<00:01:56.850> up<00:01:57.000> and<00:01:57.299> the

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
up there that could be opened up and the

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.590 
up there that could be opened up and the
crane<00:01:57.810> actually<00:01:58.350> then<00:01:58.590> come<00:01:59.520> down<00:01:59.700> straight

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
crane actually then come down straight

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.539 
crane actually then come down straight
from<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.049> very<00:02:01.229> very<00:02:01.469> top<00:02:01.740> before<00:02:02.250> we<00:02:02.310> go

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
from the very very top before we go

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:03.980 
from the very very top before we go
obviously<00:02:02.969> you're<00:02:03.119> standing<00:02:03.540> right<00:02:03.570> in<00:02:03.750> front

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
obviously you're standing right in front

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.480 
obviously you're standing right in front
of<00:02:04.079> that<00:02:04.200> hole<00:02:04.409> I<00:02:04.619> just<00:02:04.890> have<00:02:05.009> to<00:02:05.100> ask<00:02:05.250> you<00:02:05.399> me

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
of that hole I just have to ask you me

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.999 
of that hole I just have to ask you me
do<00:02:05.610> you<00:02:05.700> yeah<00:02:06.479> you<00:02:07.320> said<00:02:07.500> this<00:02:07.590> was<00:02:07.740> out<00:02:07.829> of<00:02:07.950> the

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
do you yeah you said this was out of the

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.499 
do you yeah you said this was out of the
blue<00:02:08.220> I<00:02:08.459> mean<00:02:08.610> are<00:02:08.819> you<00:02:08.879> afraid<00:02:09.090> it<00:02:09.270> could<00:02:09.390> be

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
blue I mean are you afraid it could be

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.090 
blue I mean are you afraid it could be
bigger<00:02:09.780> do<00:02:10.080> you<00:02:10.170> know<00:02:10.379> you<00:02:10.830> would

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
bigger do you know you would

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.620 
bigger do you know you would
you<00:02:11.190> had<00:02:11.280> no<00:02:11.370> idea<00:02:11.700> was<00:02:11.910> there<00:02:12.150> so<00:02:12.390> could<00:02:12.540> there

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
you had no idea was there so could there

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.210 
you had no idea was there so could there
be<00:02:12.690> other<00:02:12.810> sinkholes<00:02:13.470> under<00:02:13.710> the<00:02:13.800> museum

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
be other sinkholes under the museum

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.560 
be other sinkholes under the museum
could<00:02:14.430> this<00:02:14.550> one<00:02:14.730> get<00:02:14.880> bigger<00:02:15.090> do<00:02:15.390> you<00:02:15.450> have

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
could this one get bigger do you have

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:21.380 
could this one get bigger do you have
any<00:02:15.690> idea<00:02:18.500> the<00:02:19.610> you<00:02:20.610> know<00:02:20.670> sinkholes<00:02:21.150> are

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
any idea the you know sinkholes are

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.880 
any idea the you know sinkholes are
something<00:02:21.750> that's<00:02:21.870> real<00:02:22.140> common<00:02:22.380> for<00:02:22.770> this

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
something that's real common for this

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.390 
something that's real common for this
area<00:02:23.250> we<00:02:24.180> we<00:02:25.110> live<00:02:25.320> with<00:02:25.530> it<00:02:25.710> we<00:02:25.740> deal<00:02:26.040> with<00:02:26.070> it

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
area we we live with it we deal with it

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.640 
area we we live with it we deal with it
every<00:02:26.730> day

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
every day

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.020 
every day

this and of course Mammoth Cave National

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.360 
this and of course Mammoth Cave National
Park<00:02:30.480> is<00:02:30.900> only<00:02:31.080> 20<00:02:31.440> miles<00:02:31.650> up<00:02:31.890> the<00:02:32.010> road<00:02:32.160> from

Park is only 20 miles up the road from

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.830 
Park is only 20 miles up the road from
us<00:02:32.580> so<00:02:33.300> this<00:02:33.480> is<00:02:33.710> we<00:02:34.850> we<00:02:35.850> have<00:02:35.880> the<00:02:36.180> technology

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
us so this is we we have the technology

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.300 
us so this is we we have the technology
we<00:02:36.870> have<00:02:37.140> the<00:02:37.260> understanding<00:02:37.500> we<00:02:38.040> have<00:02:38.190> the

we have the understanding we have the

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.750 
we have the understanding we have the

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
top of sinkholes this is a very strange

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.440 
top of sinkholes this is a very strange
occurrence<00:02:45.860> we<00:02:46.860> der<00:02:47.160> anticipating<00:02:48.090> that<00:02:48.120> it

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
occurrence we der anticipating that it

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.510 
occurrence we der anticipating that it
was<00:02:48.630> the<00:02:48.870> rains<00:02:49.110> a<00:02:49.620> lot<00:02:49.890> of<00:02:50.010> the<00:02:50.100> rains<00:02:50.280> that

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
was the rains a lot of the rains that

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.520 
was the rains a lot of the rains that
we've<00:02:50.640> had<00:02:50.850> have<00:02:50.970> been<00:02:51.000> more<00:02:51.330> than<00:02:51.510> normal<00:02:52.380> the

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
we've had have been more than normal the

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.830 
we've had have been more than normal the
last<00:02:52.740> two<00:02:53.010> or<00:02:53.040> three<00:02:53.160> years<00:02:53.340> and<00:02:53.970> as<00:02:54.480> you<00:02:54.690> all

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
last two or three years and as you all

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.480 
last two or three years and as you all
will<00:02:55.020> remember<00:02:55.050> the<00:02:55.530> five<00:02:55.740> hundred<00:02:56.130> year<00:02:56.280> rain

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
will remember the five hundred year rain

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:58.850 
will remember the five hundred year rain
that<00:02:56.730> we<00:02:56.910> had<00:02:57.150> most<00:02:57.870> of<00:02:58.020> the<00:02:58.110> publicity<00:02:58.470> was

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
that we had most of the publicity was

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.160 
that we had most of the publicity was
Nashville<00:02:59.400> but<00:02:59.580> you<00:03:00.090> know<00:03:00.180> that<00:03:00.390> raised<00:03:00.690> the

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
Nashville but you know that raised the

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.440 
Nashville but you know that raised the
water<00:03:01.380> levels<00:03:01.770> would<00:03:01.980> come<00:03:02.220> up<00:03:02.430> I<00:03:02.820> didn't<00:03:03.210> sink

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
water levels would come up I didn't sink

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.120 
water levels would come up I didn't sink
back<00:03:03.660> down<00:03:03.930> and<00:03:04.080> every<00:03:04.290> time<00:03:04.530> they<00:03:04.710> would<00:03:04.830> sink

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
back down and every time they would sink

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.010 
back down and every time they would sink
they<00:03:05.550> they<00:03:05.910> would<00:03:06.060> take<00:03:06.240> some<00:03:06.480> of<00:03:06.510> that<00:03:06.630> soil

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
they they would take some of that soil

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.710 
they they would take some of that soil
with<00:03:07.260> them<00:03:07.470> but<00:03:07.680> engineers<00:03:08.610> our<00:03:09.240> engineering

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
with them but engineers our engineering

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.230 
with them but engineers our engineering
people<00:03:10.260> all<00:03:10.470> tell<00:03:10.710> us<00:03:10.890> that<00:03:11.460> this<00:03:11.730> building<00:03:11.970> is

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.240 
people all tell us that this building is

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.870 
people all tell us that this building is
safe<00:03:12.480> that<00:03:13.230> the<00:03:13.560> museum<00:03:14.100> building<00:03:14.490> is<00:03:14.640> safe

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
safe that the museum building is safe

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.050 
safe that the museum building is safe
and<00:03:15.150> so<00:03:16.140> we<00:03:16.170> have<00:03:16.560> we<00:03:17.460> feel<00:03:17.670> very<00:03:17.850> comfortable

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
and so we have we feel very comfortable

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.360 
and so we have we feel very comfortable
with<00:03:18.480> that<00:03:18.660> and<00:03:18.870> the<00:03:19.380> key<00:03:19.560> is<00:03:19.740> the<00:03:19.920> stormwater

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
with that and the key is the stormwater

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.450 
with that and the key is the stormwater
management<00:03:20.550> and<00:03:21.330> programs<00:03:22.080> and<00:03:22.320> that<00:03:23.100> you<00:03:23.280> put

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:23.460 
management and programs and that you put

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:26.600 
management and programs and that you put
in<00:03:23.580> place<00:03:23.610> to<00:03:23.850> deal<00:03:24.060> with<00:03:24.240> that
