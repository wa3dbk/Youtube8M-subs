have water everywhere so do it somewhere
waterproof<00:01:10.500> but<00:01:10.790> you<00:01:11.790> know<00:01:11.850> you're<00:01:12.000> just

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
waterproof but you know you're just

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.620 
waterproof but you know you're just
going<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.360> roll<00:01:13.010> your<00:01:14.010> IT<00:01:14.189> band<00:01:14.490> so<00:01:15.030> from<00:01:15.270> just

going to roll your IT band so from just
above<00:01:15.869> your<00:01:16.080> knee<00:01:16.400> to<00:01:17.400> just<00:01:17.640> below<00:01:17.939> your<00:01:18.150> hip

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
above your knee to just below your hip

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.450 
above your knee to just below your hip
if<00:01:18.600> that's<00:01:18.810> really<00:01:19.259> uncomfortable<00:01:19.680> for<00:01:20.280> you

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
if that's really uncomfortable for you

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.090 
if that's really uncomfortable for you
bring<00:01:21.119> this<00:01:21.270> foot<00:01:21.540> forward<00:01:22.020> but<00:01:22.770> what<00:01:22.920> this

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
bring this foot forward but what this

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.280 
bring this foot forward but what this
does<00:01:23.159> is<00:01:23.580> it<00:01:23.759> takes<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.540> connective<00:01:25.049> tissue

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
does is it takes the connective tissue

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.920 
does is it takes the connective tissue
and<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:26.250> muscle<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:27.030> does<00:01:27.210> that<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.840> it

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
and the muscle and it does that and it

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.899 
and the muscle and it does that and it
helps<00:01:28.259> break<00:01:28.500> adhesions<00:01:29.159> between<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.729> two

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
helps break adhesions between the two

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.580 
helps break adhesions between the two
which<00:01:30.450> are<00:01:30.600> actually<00:01:31.049> locking<00:01:31.470> up<00:01:31.560> your

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
which are actually locking up your

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.770 
which are actually locking up your
flexibility<00:01:32.340> so<00:01:32.579> if<00:01:32.670> you<00:01:32.790> stretch<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.420> you

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
flexibility so if you stretch and you

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.749 
flexibility so if you stretch and you
don't<00:01:33.990> find<00:01:34.680> you<00:01:34.829> move<00:01:35.070> better<00:01:35.310> on<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.729> ice

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
don't find you move better on the ice

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.390 
don't find you move better on the ice
this<00:01:36.630> is<00:01:36.810> probably<00:01:37.290> one<00:01:37.829> of<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.040> big<00:01:38.220> reasons

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
this is probably one of the big reasons

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.149 
this is probably one of the big reasons
why<00:01:38.820> so<00:01:39.479> let's<00:01:39.659> take<00:01:39.900> a<00:01:39.930> few<00:01:40.049> minutes<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:40.799> it's

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
why so let's take a few minutes and it's

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.120 
why so let's take a few minutes and it's
not<00:01:41.340> like<00:01:41.579> fast<00:01:42.450> it's<00:01:43.049> you<00:01:43.320> know<00:01:43.409> like<00:01:44.100> a

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
not like fast it's you know like a

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.929 
not like fast it's you know like a
massage

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
massage

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.149 
massage
find<00:01:45.659> those<00:01:45.840> trigger<00:01:46.110> points<00:01:46.530> if<00:01:46.619> you<00:01:46.740> find<00:01:47.009> a

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
find those trigger points if you find a

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.389 
find those trigger points if you find a
gnarly<00:01:48.030> not<00:01:48.210> sit<00:01:48.659> on<00:01:48.689> it<00:01:48.990> till<00:01:49.920> it<00:01:50.100> kind<00:01:50.310> of

gnarly not sit on it till it kind of
melts<00:01:50.700> away<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:50.939> bit<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.390> then<00:01:51.840> keep<00:01:52.229> going

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:53.149 
melts away a bit and then keep going

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:57.020 
melts away a bit and then keep going
when<00:01:54.149> I<00:01:54.180> do<00:01:54.439> my<00:01:55.439> lats<00:01:55.680> like<00:01:55.979> this<00:01:56.219> I'm<00:01:56.549> on<00:01:56.880> the

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
when I do my lats like this I'm on the

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.330 
when I do my lats like this I'm on the
back<00:01:57.240> border<00:01:57.719> of<00:01:57.840> my<00:01:57.960> armpit<00:01:58.439> kind<00:01:58.950> of<00:01:59.040> from<00:01:59.189> my

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
back border of my armpit kind of from my

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.880 
back border of my armpit kind of from my
armpit<00:01:59.790> down<00:02:00.060> I'm<00:02:00.420> not<00:02:00.750> getting<00:02:01.079> up<00:02:01.229> here<00:02:01.710> on

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
armpit down I'm not getting up here on

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:08.949 
armpit down I'm not getting up here on
my<00:02:02.460> arm<00:02:02.700> I<00:02:03.030> can<00:02:03.899> also<00:02:04.200> do<00:02:04.560> my<00:02:04.740> adductors<00:02:05.630> here

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:10.830 

and<00:02:09.049> you'll<00:02:09.679> probably<00:02:09.799> find<00:02:10.069> quite<00:02:10.549> a<00:02:10.579> few

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
and you'll probably find quite a few

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:17.229 
and you'll probably find quite a few
knots<00:02:11.890> there<00:02:13.870> and<00:02:15.340> you<00:02:16.340> can<00:02:16.459> do<00:02:16.579> lots<00:02:16.790> of<00:02:16.939> areas

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
knots there and you can do lots of areas

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:23.830 
knots there and you can do lots of areas
but<00:02:17.420> we'll<00:02:17.989> do<00:02:18.170> glutes<00:02:22.030> getting<00:02:23.030> all<00:02:23.299> the

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
but we'll do glutes getting all the

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.380 
but we'll do glutes getting all the
surfaces<00:02:24.439> so<00:02:24.650> not<00:02:24.799> just<00:02:25.069> rolling<00:02:25.519> over<00:02:25.819> the

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
surfaces so not just rolling over the

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.369 
surfaces so not just rolling over the
same<00:02:26.629> tissue<00:02:28.750> think<00:02:29.750> a<00:02:29.840> lot<00:02:29.989> of<00:02:30.109> you<00:02:30.230> do<00:02:30.349> a

00:02:30.369 --> 00:02:30.379 
same tissue think a lot of you do a

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:32.020 
same tissue think a lot of you do a
great<00:02:30.650> job<00:02:30.859> stretching<00:02:31.430> your<00:02:31.549> hips

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
great job stretching your hips

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.910 
great job stretching your hips
sometimes<00:02:32.780> you<00:02:32.930> stretch<00:02:33.230> your<00:02:33.379> hips<00:02:33.590> side<00:02:33.890> to

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
sometimes you stretch your hips side to

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.819 
sometimes you stretch your hips side to
side<00:02:34.069> and<00:02:34.519> front<00:02:34.579> to<00:02:35.090> back<00:02:35.769> sometimes<00:02:36.769> you

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:36.829 
side and front to back sometimes you

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:39.970 
side and front to back sometimes you
just<00:02:36.859> stretch<00:02:37.189> them<00:02:37.459> into<00:02:38.200> external<00:02:39.200> rotation

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
just stretch them into external rotation

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.789 
just stretch them into external rotation
but<00:02:40.640> you<00:02:41.239> very<00:02:41.629> often<00:02:41.900> miss<00:02:42.260> stretching<00:02:42.680> them

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:42.799 
but you very often miss stretching them

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:44.530 
but you very often miss stretching them
in<00:02:42.920> the<00:02:43.010> internal<00:02:43.549> rotation<00:02:43.670> which<00:02:44.239> is<00:02:44.389> where

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
in the internal rotation which is where

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.690 
in the internal rotation which is where
your<00:02:44.690> butterfly<00:02:45.139> flare<00:02:45.440> comes<00:02:45.739> from<00:02:46.010> so<00:02:46.430> this

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
your butterfly flare comes from so this

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.229 
your butterfly flare comes from so this
one<00:02:46.970> again<00:02:47.840> it's<00:02:48.200> not<00:02:48.409> new<00:02:48.769> it's<00:02:49.099> not

earth-shattering take off my microphone
pack<00:02:53.000> here<00:02:53.599> but<00:02:54.439> it's<00:02:54.590> just<00:02:54.829> nice<00:02:55.159> wide<00:02:55.519> feed

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
this I'm just applying about 30%

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.170 
this I'm just applying about 30%
pressure<00:03:06.049> and<00:03:06.500> I<00:03:06.980> just<00:03:07.250> feel<00:03:07.430> a<00:03:07.489> stretching

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
pressure and I just feel a stretching

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
pinching or a block this is not the

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.599 
pinching or a block this is not the
right<00:03:17.209> exercise<00:03:17.840> for<00:03:18.560> you<00:03:18.709> the<00:03:19.190> first<00:03:19.400> two

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:19.609 
right exercise for you the first two

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:21.640 
right exercise for you the first two
were<00:03:19.760> easy<00:03:20.000> this<00:03:20.780> one<00:03:21.049> you<00:03:21.139> might<00:03:21.260> not<00:03:21.470> like

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
were easy this one you might not like

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.550 
were easy this one you might not like
very<00:03:21.919> much<00:03:22.069> it's<00:03:22.819> very<00:03:23.060> hard<00:03:23.329> but<00:03:24.260> it's<00:03:24.440> to

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
very much it's very hard but it's to

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.080 
very much it's very hard but it's to
build<00:03:24.739> some<00:03:24.949> of<00:03:25.069> the<00:03:25.129> stamina<00:03:25.639> that<00:03:25.669> you<00:03:25.879> need

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
build some of the stamina that you need

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.390 
build some of the stamina that you need
to<00:03:26.269> keep<00:03:26.510> in<00:03:26.750> your<00:03:26.900> nice<00:03:27.500> ready<00:03:27.799> position<00:03:28.040> when

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
to keep in your nice ready position when

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.330 
to keep in your nice ready position when
you<00:03:28.519> guys<00:03:28.639> get<00:03:28.940> tired<00:03:29.379> you<00:03:30.379> get<00:03:30.590> standing<00:03:31.159> up

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
you guys get tired you get standing up

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.240 
you guys get tired you get standing up
and<00:03:31.579> bending<00:03:31.940> forward<00:03:32.209> so<00:03:32.810> you<00:03:32.900> have<00:03:33.230> no<00:03:33.500> power

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
and bending forward so you have no power

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.610 
and bending forward so you have no power
from<00:03:35.090> your<00:03:35.239> legs<00:03:35.299> and<00:03:35.780> you're<00:03:36.109> putting<00:03:36.290> a<00:03:36.440> lot

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
from your legs and you're putting a lot

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.039 
from your legs and you're putting a lot
of<00:03:36.650> load<00:03:37.040> on<00:03:37.069> your<00:03:37.819> lower<00:03:38.000> back<00:03:38.120> and<00:03:38.329> making<00:03:38.930> it

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:39.049 
of load on your lower back and making it

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:41.379 
of load on your lower back and making it
tired<00:03:39.349> and<00:03:39.709> achy<00:03:40.159> and<00:03:40.190> over<00:03:40.879> time<00:03:41.120> it<00:03:41.269> could

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:41.389 
tired and achy and over time it could

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:43.539 
tired and achy and over time it could
lead<00:03:41.599> to<00:03:41.629> an<00:03:41.900> injury<00:03:42.229> so<00:03:42.769> in<00:03:42.919> this<00:03:43.069> one<00:03:43.340> we're

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:43.549 
lead to an injury so in this one we're

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:45.629 
lead to an injury so in this one we're
going<00:03:43.729> to<00:03:43.790> do<00:03:43.970> some<00:03:44.209> explosive<00:03:44.840> movements<00:03:45.319> and

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:45.639 
going to do some explosive movements and

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:48.309 
going to do some explosive movements and
then<00:03:46.639> we're<00:03:46.819> going<00:03:46.909> to<00:03:47.000> do<00:03:47.180> a<00:03:47.209> static<00:03:47.840> hold<00:03:47.870> to

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:48.319 
then we're going to do a static hold to

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:50.140 
then we're going to do a static hold to
build<00:03:48.530> up<00:03:48.709> some<00:03:49.190> fatigue<00:03:49.549> so<00:03:49.760> we're<00:03:49.879> trying<00:03:50.030> to

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
build up some fatigue so we're trying to

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.000 
build up some fatigue so we're trying to
teach<00:03:50.359> you<00:03:50.569> that<00:03:50.750> you<00:03:50.989> can<00:03:51.590> still<00:03:51.739> be

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
teach you that you can still be

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.089 
teach you that you can still be
explosive<00:03:52.639> even<00:03:53.479> if<00:03:53.599> you're<00:03:53.750> fatigued<00:03:54.169> and

00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:55.099 
explosive even if you're fatigued and

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:56.589 
explosive even if you're fatigued and
give<00:03:55.370> you<00:03:55.459> a<00:03:55.519> little<00:03:55.760> more<00:03:55.879> resistance<00:03:56.449> so

00:03:56.589 --> 00:03:56.599 
give you a little more resistance so

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:57.869 
give you a little more resistance so
that<00:03:56.780> you<00:03:56.870> can<00:03:57.049> stay<00:03:57.290> in<00:03:57.319> this<00:03:57.500> position

00:03:57.869 --> 00:03:57.879 
that you can stay in this position

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:01.869 
that you can stay in this position
longer<00:03:58.879> before<00:03:59.269> that<00:03:59.540> fatigue<00:04:00.049> sets<00:04:00.349> in<00:04:00.879> so

00:04:01.869 --> 00:04:01.879 
longer before that fatigue sets in so

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:03.009 
longer before that fatigue sets in so
we're<00:04:02.030> just<00:04:02.060> going<00:04:02.269> to<00:04:02.359> start<00:04:02.540> with<00:04:02.629> three
