00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
taillight you see the calls that you

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.580 
taillight you see the calls that you
have<00:01:56.490> that<00:01:56.640> in<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:56.969> manual<00:01:57.180> is<00:01:57.450> actually<00:01:57.810> they

have that in the manual is actually they

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.859 
have that in the manual is actually they
talk<00:01:58.829> to<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.040> specific<00:01:59.490> colors<00:01:59.850> so<00:02:00.719> you<00:02:00.840> can

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
talk to the specific colors so you can

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:08.469 
talk to the specific colors so you can
connect<00:02:01.350> actually

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.390

connectors<00:02:47.099> easier<00:02:47.579> one<00:02:48.540> side<00:02:48.840> is<00:02:49.079> gonna<00:02:49.200> be

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
connectors easier one side is gonna be

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:55.250 
connectors easier one side is gonna be
for<00:02:49.560> the<00:02:49.650> plug<00:02:50.959> let's<00:02:51.959> plug<00:02:52.200> it<00:02:52.349> in<00:02:53.359> done<00:02:54.359> and

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
other thing to do is go to the barre and

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.360 
other thing to do is go to the barre and

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
connect the plus sign to it to the

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.760 
connect the plus sign to it to the
arness<00:03:27.230> don't<00:03:28.230> plug<00:03:28.440> it<00:03:28.590> in<00:03:29.810> just<00:03:30.810> do<00:03:31.410> that<00:03:31.620> the

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.770 
arness don't plug it in just do that the

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:34.730 
arness don't plug it in just do that the
last<00:03:32.010> moment<00:03:32.400> and<00:03:33.350> let's<00:03:34.350> go<00:03:34.470> to<00:03:34.530> the<00:03:34.650> next

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
there under the to the barre connected

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.820 
there under the to the barre connected
directly<00:03:46.860> run<00:03:47.490> it<00:03:47.670> under<00:03:48.030> the<00:03:48.060> tank<00:03:48.450> I<00:03:48.830> mean

anything is gonna be censored over there

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.060 
anything is gonna be censored over there
the<00:04:10.830> GPS<00:04:11.340> is<00:04:11.550> also<00:04:11.850> put<00:04:12.330> it<00:04:12.450> over<00:04:12.660> here<00:04:13.230> on<00:04:13.380> this

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070 
the GPS is also put it over here on this

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:16.250 
the GPS is also put it over here on this
magnetized<00:04:14.730> so<00:04:14.760> it<00:04:15.239> has<00:04:15.480> magnet<00:04:15.930> over<00:04:16.019> there

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
magnetized so it has magnet over there

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.670 
magnetized so it has magnet over there
and<00:04:16.620> the<00:04:17.580> key<00:04:17.760> Center<00:04:18.180> just<00:04:18.600> on<00:04:18.959> top<00:04:19.440> of<00:04:19.590> the

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
and the key Center just on top of the

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.210 
and the key Center just on top of the
tank<00:04:20.359> I<00:04:21.359> had<00:04:22.140> to<00:04:22.260> do<00:04:22.410> some<00:04:22.590> modifications

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
tank I had to do some modifications

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.820 
tank I had to do some modifications
though<00:04:23.430> because<00:04:24.030> the<00:04:24.480> clasp<00:04:25.140> cable<00:04:25.590> for<00:04:25.770> the

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
though because the clasp cable for the

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.970 
though because the clasp cable for the
power<00:04:26.040> wasn't<00:04:26.760> long<00:04:27.419> enough<00:04:27.720> so<00:04:28.590> I<00:04:28.620> actually

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:28.980 
power wasn't long enough so I actually

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.100 
power wasn't long enough so I actually
had<00:04:29.340> to<00:04:29.370> extend<00:04:29.910> the<00:04:30.150> cable<00:04:30.540> you<00:04:30.750> know<00:04:30.870> with<00:04:31.080> a

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
had to extend the cable you know with a

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.560 
had to extend the cable you know with a
little<00:04:31.470> little<00:04:32.160> trick<00:04:32.460> I<00:04:32.610> took<00:04:32.910> one<00:04:33.270> of<00:04:33.390> the

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
little little trick I took one of the

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:39.110 
little little trick I took one of the
cables<00:04:34.380> of<00:04:34.500> the<00:04:34.970> regular<00:04:37.460> regular<00:04:38.460> harness

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
cables of the regular regular harness

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.020 
cables of the regular regular harness
that<00:04:39.870> I<00:04:39.900> put<00:04:40.230> and<00:04:40.530> excuse<00:04:41.160> it<00:04:41.310> to<00:04:41.430> extend<00:04:41.730> it<00:04:41.910> to

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
that I put and excuse it to extend it to

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.080 
that I put and excuse it to extend it to
it<00:04:42.150> and<00:04:42.390> I<00:04:42.510> connect<00:04:42.810> it<00:04:42.900> to<00:04:43.050> it<00:04:43.169> and<00:04:43.850> run<00:04:44.850> it<00:04:44.970> on

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
it and I connect it to it and run it on

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:49.220 
it and I connect it to it and run it on

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:05.120 
seat there's some space over there so
and<00:05:03.150> also<00:05:03.840> I<00:05:04.080> put<00:05:04.140> it<00:05:04.380> there<00:05:04.530> at<00:05:04.740> the<00:05:04.890> same<00:05:05.070> time

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.130 
and also I put it there at the same time

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:06.409 
and also I put it there at the same time
because<00:05:05.550> I<00:05:05.640> didn't<00:05:05.850> want<00:05:06.000> it<00:05:06.030> to<00:05:06.150> have<00:05:06.330> you

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:06.419 
because I didn't want it to have you

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:09.500 
because I didn't want it to have you
know<00:05:06.540> access<00:05:06.990> to<00:05:07.140> it<00:05:07.260> just<00:05:07.560> because<00:05:08.270> just<00:05:09.270> you

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:09.510 
know access to it just because just you

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:12.469 
know access to it just because just you
know<00:05:10.100> pull<00:05:11.100> up<00:05:11.250> the<00:05:11.490> seat<00:05:11.760> and<00:05:12.000> having<00:05:12.360> the

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:12.479 
know pull up the seat and having the

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:14.150 
know pull up the seat and having the
main<00:05:12.660> unit<00:05:12.930> over<00:05:13.110> here<00:05:13.140> would<00:05:13.530> be<00:05:13.680> like<00:05:13.860> too

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 
main unit over here would be like too

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.980 
main unit over here would be like too
obvious<00:05:14.610> and<00:05:14.820> you<00:05:14.940> know<00:05:15.030> just<00:05:15.330> have<00:05:15.540> to<00:05:15.660> cut<00:05:15.840> it

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:15.990 
obvious and you know just have to cut it

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:18.350 
obvious and you know just have to cut it
and<00:05:16.830> doesn't<00:05:17.400> make<00:05:17.490> sense<00:05:17.760> to<00:05:17.880> have<00:05:17.970> an<00:05:18.090> alarm

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 
and doesn't make sense to have an alarm

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.360 
and doesn't make sense to have an alarm
if<00:05:18.630> you're<00:05:18.930> gonna<00:05:19.050> put<00:05:19.289> it
