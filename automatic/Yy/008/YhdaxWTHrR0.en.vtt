00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
steering column there's five millimeter

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.229 
steering column there's five millimeter
bolts<00:00:38.219> you<00:00:38.340> take<00:00:38.550> those<00:00:38.730> three<00:00:39.030> five

bolts you take those three five
millimeter<00:00:39.690> bolts<00:00:40.050> off<00:00:40.170> and<00:00:40.440> then<00:00:40.980> you<00:00:41.070> play

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
millimeter bolts off and then you play

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.979 
millimeter bolts off and then you play
with<00:00:41.430> it<00:00:41.579> a<00:00:41.610> little<00:00:41.760> bit<00:00:42.000> until<00:00:42.120> you<00:00:42.390> can<00:00:42.750> pop

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
with it a little bit until you can pop

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.510 
with it a little bit until you can pop
everything<00:00:43.469> off<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:43.980> be<00:00:44.129> careful<00:00:44.399> you<00:00:44.460> don't

everything off and be careful you don't
break<00:00:44.820> it<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.620> then<00:00:46.620> what<00:00:46.890> you<00:00:46.980> do<00:00:47.190> is<00:00:47.219> you

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
break it and then what you do is you

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.040 
break it and then what you do is you
reach<00:00:47.940> behind<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.450> steering<00:00:48.750> wheel

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
reach behind the steering wheel

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.450 
reach behind the steering wheel
and<00:00:49.760> you<00:00:50.760> can't<00:00:51.000> see<00:00:51.210> me<00:00:51.329> reaching<00:00:51.510> behind<00:00:51.989> but

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
and you can't see me reaching behind but

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.350 
and you can't see me reaching behind but
essentially<00:00:53.460> what<00:00:53.640> you're<00:00:53.760> going<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:53.969> do<00:00:54.149> is

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
essentially what you're going to do is

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.420 
essentially what you're going to do is
reach<00:00:54.750> behind<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.230> steering<00:00:55.469> wheel<00:00:55.620> there's

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
reach behind the steering wheel there's

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.770 
reach behind the steering wheel there's
three<00:00:56.760> holes<00:00:56.969> there<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:58.010> there<00:00:59.010> is<00:00:59.280> this

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 
three holes there and there is this

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.060 
three holes there and there is this
basically<00:01:00.780> you're<00:01:01.170> going<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.559> move<00:01:01.770> this

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
basically you're going to move this

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.149 
basically you're going to move this
spring<00:01:02.399> down<00:01:02.609> like<00:01:02.850> that<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.409> that<00:01:04.409> spring<00:01:04.860> is

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
spring down like that and that spring is

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.929 
spring down like that and that spring is
actually<00:01:05.760> gripping<00:01:06.360> on<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:07.850> hopefully<00:01:08.850> you

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
actually gripping on to hopefully you

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.719 
actually gripping on to hopefully you
can<00:01:09.060> see<00:01:09.299> it<00:01:09.450> this<00:01:10.350> plastic<00:01:10.740> guy<00:01:11.189> right<00:01:11.460> here

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
can see it this plastic guy right here

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.760 
can see it this plastic guy right here
that<00:01:12.320> has<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.619> see<00:01:14.610> if<00:01:14.700> I<00:01:14.760> could<00:01:14.939> zoom<00:01:15.119> on<00:01:15.330> it<00:01:15.770> it

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
that has a see if I could zoom on it it

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.010 
that has a see if I could zoom on it it
has<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:16.979> little<00:01:17.220> hook<00:01:17.549> on<00:01:17.790> it<00:01:17.820> so<00:01:18.600> basically

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
has a little hook on it so basically

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.450 
has a little hook on it so basically
that<00:01:19.979> hook<00:01:20.280> grabs<00:01:21.150> on<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.799> this<00:01:22.799> spring<00:01:23.189> and

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
that hook grabs on to this spring and

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.940 
that hook grabs on to this spring and
once<00:01:23.939> you<00:01:24.060> move<00:01:24.210> that<00:01:24.390> spring<00:01:24.720> in<00:01:24.990> that<00:01:25.740> hook

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
once you move that spring in that hook

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.350 
once you move that spring in that hook
comes<00:01:26.189> right<00:01:26.369> off<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:26.759> you<00:01:26.820> do<00:01:26.939> that<00:01:27.090> with<00:01:27.330> all

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
comes right off and you do that with all

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.230 
comes right off and you do that with all
three<00:01:27.900> of<00:01:27.930> them<00:01:28.189> all<00:01:29.189> three<00:01:29.640> sides<00:01:29.939> I'll

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
three of them all three sides I'll

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.020 
three of them all three sides I'll
you'll<00:01:30.600> see<00:01:30.780> those<00:01:30.960> holes<00:01:31.170> in<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.409> back<00:01:31.590> and

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
you'll see those holes in the back and

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.539 
you'll see those holes in the back and
then<00:01:33.030> it<00:01:33.210> just<00:01:33.450> pops<00:01:33.720> right<00:01:33.840> out<00:01:34.250> so<00:01:35.250> I<00:01:35.310> don't

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
then it just pops right out so I don't

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.069 
then it just pops right out so I don't
know<00:01:35.640> about<00:01:35.790> any<00:01:36.090> electrical<00:01:36.630> people<00:01:36.930> say

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
know about any electrical people say

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.330 
know about any electrical people say
disconnect<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.680> battery<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.159> all<00:01:38.220> this

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
disconnect the battery and all this

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.069 
disconnect the battery and all this
other<00:01:38.520> stuff<00:01:38.640> you<00:01:38.939> probably<00:01:39.329> should<00:01:39.600> do<00:01:39.720> that

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
other stuff you probably should do that

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.140 
other stuff you probably should do that
there<00:01:40.560> are<00:01:40.710> also<00:01:40.860> people<00:01:41.189> who<00:01:41.369> say<00:01:41.790> you<00:01:41.850> need

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.479 
millimeter tool in there and if you grab
it<00:02:04.200> just<00:02:04.229> right<00:02:04.880> yeah<00:02:05.880> I<00:02:05.969> guess<00:02:06.299> it<00:02:06.450> would

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:07.489 
it just right yeah I guess it would

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:10.760 
it just right yeah I guess it would
would<00:02:08.489> release<00:02:08.879> all<00:02:09.149> of<00:02:09.270> them<00:02:09.390> so<00:02:09.720> I<00:02:09.989> guess

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
would release all of them so I guess

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.820 
would release all of them so I guess
that's<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.190> correct<00:02:11.430> thing<00:02:11.610> to<00:02:11.760> do

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
that's the correct thing to do

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.250 
that's the correct thing to do
as<00:02:12.950> you<00:02:13.220> push<00:02:13.730> on<00:02:13.910> in<00:02:14.150> on<00:02:14.390> that<00:02:14.570> and<00:02:14.780> all<00:02:15.020> three

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
as you push on in on that and all three

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.900 
as you push on in on that and all three
of<00:02:15.290> them<00:02:15.440> will<00:02:15.530> come<00:02:15.650> out<00:02:15.800> if<00:02:15.980> you<00:02:16.100> can't<00:02:16.340> and

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910
