00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.990
 guys but you never get stuck because you can't sometimes just a 

00:00:03.989 --> 00:00:06.380
 draw certain things block yourself 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:10.280
 now I'll show you a little trick remember how to block of 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.850
 when you plan to use sausages and eggs for lunch time. network run 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.490
 in cooking and lunch time pop then look carefully and you'll understand me 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.550
 lunch time 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.310
 when lunch time 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.179
 try doing it using a man-shaped sausage shape 

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:35.559
 and then a slightly larger egg shape for the sausage 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:40.600
 for the arms 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.600
 use forms auctioned to a man 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:48.940
 and for the legs 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.010
 some sausage-like shapes you give to a man 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.590
 you saw this i meant with it's lunch time 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:07.770
 then drawing some sausage eggs we can depict the figure 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.940
 a person's base eggs eggs eggs eggs eggs eggs eggs 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.230
 but above all with this technique we can make sketches of figures 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.700
 human 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.039
 intent on making any kind of eggs the eggs the movement 

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:20.110
 do with friends 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.000
 to do pugliesi in the store comes the mac works I what xd not able art 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.660
 let's see how to put all these tricks into practice 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.520
 we start running again in the kitchen 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.700
 and a new shape a little bigger for the body 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.890
 then we make some 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.600
 echo of the awakening will be finished you can finally run into cooking 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.070
 eita those in the shape of eggs and sausage look how nice 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.610
 apartments with this technique we can also draw animals 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.910
 I would say volley 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.250
 you are watching 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.680
 let's try add a kitchen design 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.620
 always using a horse 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.930
 first of all we build the basic form of the eggs and the eggs the eggs 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:19.090
 then once finished the eggs the eggs in the details and the final forms 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.179
 animal's 

00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:23.179
 the head that draws my mane 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:28.329
 then the head 

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:31.499
 and also the head 

00:02:31.499 --> 00:02:34.499
 with the game of 

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:38.869
 which we also call the head 

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:39.969
 I prefer 

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:43.889
 all using only vinyl glue in equal parts with water 

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:47.779
 and here is that finished drawing with the deleted batida guidelines 

00:02:47.779 --> 00:02:48.520
 nice eh 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.540
 and it is really a nice trick this remember you want to run in the kitchen is 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.220
 lunch time p then use and eggs and sausage try it too 

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:03.279
 I have 

00:03:03.279 --> 00:03:09.609
 I love new transitions meteo.it invades poland to use like you 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:16.569
 now guys I want to show you one 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:21.810
 too funny tail an eye to a man for a giant eye from 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:22.659
 stick to the wall 

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:25.980
 so that you fix with the erased pencil guidelines 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.900
 i have to do it is very simple we just have to continue your head for 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.360
 doing it more or less expensive must be a balloon how many times I have passed 

00:03:38.499 --> 00:03:41.739
 apply newspaper strips over the glue 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:45.219
 lists in the thesis of the other newspaper to make them adhere 

00:03:50.929 --> 00:03:55.679
 applied lots of strips of newspaper cover the whole 

00:03:55.679 --> 00:04:00.349
 balloon with about three layers of newspaper but be careful of year 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:03.509
 cover the knot holding the newspaper balloon closed 

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:06.459
 and when we finish this job 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:10.090
 and it will have dried we will have a balloon covered with three layers the 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:11.789
 perfume e-mail 

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:12.959
 remember remember 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:16.350
 of the opening we have left on top for this we need as usual 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:16.629
 for 

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:18.379
 blow up balloons 

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:22.689
 you call me slightly outside taking a pair of scissors that you do 

00:04:22.689 --> 00:04:25.689
 much attention 

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:40.610
 a raisport for soup 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:41.419
 perfect 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:44.830
 now we see together what to do with this applies 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.590
 with the scissors starting from the slot with this applies 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.340
 cut the longest papier mache balloon by dividing the half 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:01.229
 care, paint these two halves 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:05.099
 the first photo now we have to defend him we have to decide which 

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:06.000
 color did 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.720
 we could do it for example exactly like the color of sausage anyway 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.620
 this one take take take take take away greens sure 

00:05:16.339 --> 00:05:20.360
 you only need to pass the brush soaked in vinyl glue in equal parts 

00:05:20.359 --> 00:05:21.629
 with water 

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:25.259
 it doesn't matter if the color overlaps the pupil in the center the important thing is 

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:28.020
 that does not come out of the outer circle 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:31.110
 then cusano of the vinyl glue and underlined the external contour 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:32.490
 iris 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:36.330
 you have observed your eyes you will see the link and when we are done with 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:37.360
 paint by eye 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.870
 let it die in the kitchen to dry now we need the other half 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:44.520
 the one we had painted of our skin color 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:45.800
 to make eyelids 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.599
 let's see how it's done 

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:53.139
 now I go to a horse leash lint a horse ah then notice the eyelids are 

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:53.939
 relief 

00:05:53.939 --> 00:05:57.499
 I really looked like eggs, eggs, eggs, I also added 

00:05:57.499 --> 00:05:58.150
 eyelashes 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:59.530
 now we can decide 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:03.200
 pepper not it to the wall today let it simply I was in the kitchen then 

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:07.370
 try it yourself guys and build a big eye like this unfortunately 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:11.020
 even for today the art attacks are over it's lunch time I'll wait for you 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:12.009
 in the next 

00:06:12.009 --> 00:06:15.009
 bet with lots of other quartz surprises 

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:24.880
