00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
and I would go over this race and I

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.149 
and I would go over this race and I
would<00:01:27.840> open<00:01:28.170> my<00:01:28.290> eyes<00:01:28.470> I<00:01:28.650> have<00:01:28.799> tears<00:01:29.040> in<00:01:29.100> my

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
would open my eyes I have tears in my

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.520 
would open my eyes I have tears in my
eyes<00:01:29.250> because<00:01:29.610> I<00:01:29.880> felt<00:01:30.600> like<00:01:30.659> I<00:01:30.780> just<00:01:31.259> want

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
eyes because I felt like I just want

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.499 
eyes because I felt like I just want
them<00:01:31.680> at<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.860> gold<00:01:32.070> medal<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.490> I<00:01:32.670> saw<00:01:33.329> my<00:01:33.450> name

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
them at the gold medal and I saw my name

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.300 
them at the gold medal and I saw my name
on<00:01:33.720> top<00:01:33.960> of<00:01:34.140> scoreboard<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:34.770> it<00:01:34.890> wasn't<00:01:35.220> so

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
on top of scoreboard and it wasn't so

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.780 
on top of scoreboard and it wasn't so
much<00:01:35.369> about<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:36.390> time<00:01:36.900> I<00:01:36.930> set<00:01:37.380> in<00:01:37.650> my<00:01:38.040> thoughts

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
much about the time I set in my thoughts

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.450 
much about the time I set in my thoughts
and<00:01:39.030> my<00:01:39.210> imagery<00:01:39.990> my<00:01:40.200> rehearsal<00:01:40.680> it<00:01:41.130> was<00:01:41.280> more

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
and my imagery my rehearsal it was more

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.950 
and my imagery my rehearsal it was more
about<00:01:41.549> executing<00:01:42.240> technically<00:01:42.780> what<00:01:42.899> I

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
about executing technically what I

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.149 
about executing technically what I
wanted<00:01:43.259> to<00:01:43.320> do<00:01:43.470> where<00:01:43.770> I<00:01:43.829> wanted<00:01:44.100> to

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
wanted to do where I wanted to

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.530 
wanted to do where I wanted to
accelerate<00:01:44.729> and<00:01:44.850> what<00:01:44.939> part<00:01:45.149> of<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.270> track

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
accelerate and what part of the track

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.539 
accelerate and what part of the track
where<00:01:46.200> I<00:01:46.229> wanted<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:46.710> let<00:01:46.799> relax<00:01:47.189> how<00:01:47.520> I

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
where I wanted to let relax how I

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.120 
where I wanted to let relax how I
thought<00:01:47.850> I<00:01:47.880> should<00:01:47.939> look<00:01:48.299> in<00:01:48.479> a<00:01:48.570> turn<00:01:49.040> you<00:01:50.040> know

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
thought I should look in a turn you know

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.920 
thought I should look in a turn you know
poaching<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.670> last<00:01:50.880> lap<00:01:51.180> that<00:01:51.420> kind<00:01:51.689> of<00:01:51.720> thing

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
poaching the last lap that kind of thing

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.100 
poaching the last lap that kind of thing
so<00:01:52.200> when<00:01:52.890> it<00:01:53.009> happened<00:01:53.399> in<00:01:53.490> 2002<00:01:54.149> it<00:01:54.479> was

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
so when it happened in 2002 it was

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.469 
so when it happened in 2002 it was
surreal<00:01:55.350> because<00:01:55.740> I<00:01:55.890> gotten<00:01:56.700> done<00:01:56.880> it<00:01:57.090> was<00:01:57.210> so

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
surreal because I gotten done it was so

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.109 
surreal because I gotten done it was so
much<00:01:57.780> like<00:01:58.500> what<00:01:58.710> I<00:01:58.740> envisioned<00:01:59.280> you<00:01:59.820> tell<00:02:00.030> me

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
much like what I envisioned you tell me

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.270 
much like what I envisioned you tell me
think<00:02:00.299> about<00:02:00.420> this<00:02:00.659> like<00:02:00.990> well<00:02:01.229> just<00:02:02.040> am<00:02:02.189> I

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
think about this like well just am I

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.800 
think about this like well just am I
going<00:02:02.399> to<00:02:02.490> wake<00:02:02.610> up<00:02:02.640> or<00:02:03.030> just<00:02:03.060> really<00:02:03.479> yet<00:02:03.659> I

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
going to wake up or just really yet I

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.060 
going to wake up or just really yet I
mean<00:02:04.049> he<00:02:04.170> was<00:02:04.350> that<00:02:04.500> before<00:02:04.799> from<00:02:04.890> other

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
mean he was that before from other

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.249 
mean he was that before from other
athletes<00:02:05.520> but<00:02:05.700> you<00:02:06.240> know<00:02:06.329> the<00:02:06.689> pain<00:02:06.930> was<00:02:07.079> real

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
athletes but you know the pain was real

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.650 
athletes but you know the pain was real
in<00:02:07.380> my<00:02:07.469> legs<00:02:07.680> that's<00:02:07.920> for<00:02:08.099> sure<00:02:08.280> but<00:02:08.940> if<00:02:09.479> I

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
in my legs that's for sure but if I

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.360 
in my legs that's for sure but if I
would<00:02:09.840> I<00:02:09.869> would<00:02:10.289> actually<00:02:10.440> try<00:02:10.770> to<00:02:10.800> imagine

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
would I would actually try to imagine

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.100 
would I would actually try to imagine
the<00:02:11.550> pain<00:02:11.760> as<00:02:11.940> well<00:02:11.970> when<00:02:12.330> I<00:02:12.360> visualize<00:02:12.930> my

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
the pain as well when I visualize my

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.809 
the pain as well when I visualize my
races

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
races

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:15.339 
races
like<00:02:14.030> the<00:02:14.480> feeling<00:02:14.780> I<00:02:14.840> had<00:02:15.019> when<00:02:15.140> I<00:02:15.200> came

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:15.349 
like the feeling I had when I came

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:16.949 
like the feeling I had when I came
across<00:02:15.469> one<00:02:15.799> in<00:02:16.010> set<00:02:16.189> the<00:02:16.280> world<00:02:16.430> record<00:02:16.549> and

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
across one in set the world record and

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.390 
across one in set the world record and
you<00:02:17.959> know<00:02:18.049> a<00:02:18.079> few<00:02:18.319> pairs<00:02:18.560> later<00:02:18.769> if<00:02:18.889> I<00:02:18.980> had<00:02:19.249> won

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
you know a few pairs later if I had won

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.759 
you know a few pairs later if I had won
the<00:02:19.519> gold<00:02:19.730> was<00:02:19.969> just<00:02:20.810> an<00:02:20.900> amazing<00:02:20.989> billion<00:02:21.590> and

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
the gold was just an amazing billion and

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:23.349 
the gold was just an amazing billion and
a<00:02:21.829> lot<00:02:22.010> of<00:02:22.040> that<00:02:22.249> you<00:02:22.459> know<00:02:22.519> was<00:02:22.760> was<00:02:23.180> what<00:02:23.329> I

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:23.359 
a lot of that you know was was what I
