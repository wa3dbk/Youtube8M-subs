this old bathroom we're working on the
bathroom<00:00:02.159> door<00:00:02.600> closes<00:00:03.600> but<00:00:04.350> the<00:00:04.500> latch

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
bathroom door closes but the latch

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.120 
bathroom door closes but the latch
doesn't<00:00:05.490> catch<00:00:05.850> in<00:00:06.210> the<00:00:06.660> old<00:00:06.810> strike<00:00:07.170> plate<00:00:07.529> so

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
doesn't catch in the old strike plate so

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.360 
doesn't catch in the old strike plate so
the<00:00:08.220> problem<00:00:08.670> was<00:00:08.910> the<00:00:09.450> whoever<00:00:10.260> set<00:00:10.889> this<00:00:11.070> up

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
the problem was the whoever set this up

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.450 
the problem was the whoever set this up
to<00:00:11.759> the<00:00:11.849> old<00:00:12.030> door<00:00:12.420> this<00:00:13.139> latch<00:00:13.650> plate<00:00:13.980> was<00:00:14.160> too

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
to the old door this latch plate was too

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.640 
to the old door this latch plate was too
high<00:00:14.730> so<00:00:15.120> we're<00:00:15.240> going<00:00:15.389> to<00:00:15.450> need<00:00:15.599> to<00:00:15.960> match

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
high so we're going to need to match

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:17.420 
high so we're going to need to match
this<00:00:16.980> out

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
this out

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.150

I used a pencil and I made a mark on the

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.150 
I used a pencil and I made a mark on the
bottom<00:00:20.490> of<00:00:20.910> where<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.300> latch<00:00:21.510> is<00:00:21.840> and<00:00:22.769> now

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
bottom of where the latch is and now

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.439 
bottom of where the latch is and now
what<00:00:23.400> we're<00:00:23.519> going<00:00:23.609> to<00:00:23.699> have<00:00:23.880> to<00:00:24.029> do<00:00:24.180> is<00:00:24.330> we're

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
what we're going to have to do is we're

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.210 
what we're going to have to do is we're
going<00:00:24.539> to<00:00:24.600> have<00:00:24.750> to<00:00:24.900> use<00:00:24.990> a<00:00:25.019> chisel<00:00:25.439> and<00:00:25.800> we're

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
going to have to use a chisel and we're

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.150 
going to have to use a chisel and we're
going<00:00:26.340> to<00:00:26.400> have<00:00:26.580> to<00:00:26.730> lower<00:00:27.230> this<00:00:28.230> strike<00:00:28.830> plate

and I'm going to create an outline where
I<00:00:52.590> want<00:00:52.980> my<00:00:54.110> notch<00:00:55.110> to<00:00:55.410> stop<00:00:55.710> so<00:00:56.340> once<00:00:56.579> I<00:00:56.789> not

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
I want my notch to stop so once I not

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.000 
I want my notch to stop so once I not
getting<00:00:57.510> this<00:00:57.570> outline<00:00:58.109> then<00:00:58.559> I'm<00:00:58.680> pulling

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
getting this outline then I'm pulling

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.670 
getting this outline then I'm pulling
this<00:00:59.370> extra<00:00:59.789> wood<00:00:59.969> now<00:01:00.960> that<00:01:01.140> I've<00:01:01.260> defined

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
this extra wood now that I've defined

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.520 
this extra wood now that I've defined
the<00:01:01.949> outline<00:01:02.489> of<00:01:02.520> where<00:01:03.180> I<00:01:03.210> want<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:03.719> take<00:01:04.140> the

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
the outline of where I want to take the

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.219 
the outline of where I want to take the
wood<00:01:05.150> I'm<00:01:06.150> just<00:01:06.360> going<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.659> work<00:01:06.869> at<00:01:07.110> another

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
wood I'm just going to work at another

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:25.210 
wood I'm just going to work at another
time<00:01:12.049> and<00:01:13.189> remove<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.340> wood<00:01:14.580> up<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:15.030> that<00:01:15.180> mark

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:33.350 

and<00:01:26.220> now<00:01:26.340> even<00:01:26.520> by<00:01:26.759> hand<00:01:27.119> you<00:01:27.810> can<00:01:27.990> just<00:01:32.360> work

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
and now even by hand you can just work

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:40.770 
and now even by hand you can just work
the<00:01:33.540> chisel<00:01:33.960> and<00:01:34.170> remove<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:35.040> extra<00:01:35.880> wood

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.170 

and<00:01:41.950> then<00:01:42.950> that<00:01:43.100> should<00:01:43.310> be<00:01:43.340> the<00:01:43.550> depth<00:01:43.880> of<00:01:44.090> the

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
and then that should be the depth of the

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.000 
and then that should be the depth of the
plate<00:01:44.510> and<00:01:44.780> now<00:01:45.230> we're<00:01:45.410> going<00:01:45.590> to<00:01:45.680> have<00:01:45.860> to

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.010 
plate and now we're going to have to

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.850 
plate and now we're going to have to
expand<00:01:46.460> the<00:01:46.610> hole<00:01:46.850> to<00:01:47.720> match<00:01:47.960> this<00:01:48.230> line<00:01:48.530> so

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
expand the hole to match this line so

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.100 
expand the hole to match this line so
that<00:01:48.980> the<00:01:49.100> latch<00:01:49.340> fits<00:01:49.730> in<00:01:49.910> here<00:01:50.060> now<00:01:50.870> that<00:01:51.020> I

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
that the latch fits in here now that I

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.230 
that the latch fits in here now that I
matched<00:01:51.350> out<00:01:51.560> for<00:01:51.770> the<00:01:51.830> plate<00:01:52.100> and<00:01:52.340> I<00:01:52.940> now<00:01:53.210> a

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
matched out for the plate and I now a

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.620 
matched out for the plate and I now a
hole<00:01:53.750> out<00:01:53.780> I'm<00:01:54.260> going<00:01:55.190> to<00:01:55.370> drill<00:01:55.850> a<00:01:56.150> pilot<00:01:56.180> hole

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
hole out I'm going to drill a pilot hole

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.830 
hole out I'm going to drill a pilot hole
half<00:01:57.440> the<00:01:57.740> size<00:01:58.040> of<00:01:58.520> the<00:01:59.330> screw<00:01:59.600> that<00:01:59.750> I'm

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
half the size of the screw that I'm

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.120 
half the size of the screw that I'm
putting<00:02:00.110> in<00:02:00.230> here<00:02:00.380> so<00:02:00.590> we<00:02:00.680> don't<00:02:00.800> crack<00:02:01.100> the

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
putting in here so we don't crack the

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:09.190 
putting in here so we don't crack the
wood<00:02:06.760> and<00:02:07.760> then<00:02:08.750> we'll<00:02:08.840> screw<00:02:09.050> it<00:02:09.110> in<00:02:09.170> place

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
wood and then we'll screw it in place

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.240 
wood and then we'll screw it in place
and<00:02:10.100> the<00:02:10.729> strike<00:02:10.970> plate<00:02:11.180> screw<00:02:11.630> it<00:02:11.690> in<00:02:11.780> place

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
and the strike plate screw it in place

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.390 
and the strike plate screw it in place
and<00:02:13.250> now<00:02:13.880> the<00:02:13.910> door<00:02:14.270> locks<00:02:15.080> so<00:02:15.620> very<00:02:15.920> easy<00:02:16.130> to

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
and now the door locks so very easy to

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.850 
and now the door locks so very easy to
move<00:02:16.490> a<00:02:16.550> strike
