 public transport Kyivpastrans 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.730

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.680
 to get there 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.960
 I decided to check whether it is easy 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.299
 way the language for the experiment will ride on 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:27.820
 all modes of transport and start with the tram 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:34.929

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.840
 a minute earlier 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:08.349
 Ukraine seems to be getting closer to 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.420

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:16.209

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:10.590
 sometimes with a minute error here 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:13.710

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:04.270
 phones on here 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:12.750
 so that Kievpastrans consider poser and 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:12.750
 then some kind of discrimination is obtained
