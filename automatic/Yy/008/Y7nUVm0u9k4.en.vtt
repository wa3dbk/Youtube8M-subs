of am a national champion I hate myself
so<00:00:15.929> let's<00:00:16.230> get<00:00:16.379> started<00:00:16.800> okay<00:00:16.980> so<00:00:17.609> when<00:00:17.880> I<00:00:17.940> open

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
so let's get started okay so when I open

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.700 
so let's get started okay so when I open
the<00:00:18.300> package<00:00:18.660> that<00:00:18.720> they<00:00:18.930> sent<00:00:19.170> me<00:00:19.289> it<00:00:19.500> came

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
the package that they sent me it came

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.310 
the package that they sent me it came
with<00:00:19.859> a<00:00:19.890> WOD<00:00:20.670> nation<00:00:21.119> gear<00:00:21.420> speed<00:00:21.779> rope<00:00:22.050> bag

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
with a WOD nation gear speed rope bag

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.590 
with a WOD nation gear speed rope bag
the<00:00:22.890> speed<00:00:23.130> rope<00:00:23.340> itself<00:00:23.670> with<00:00:23.939> a<00:00:23.970> black<00:00:24.330> wire

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
the speed rope itself with a black wire

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.660 
the speed rope itself with a black wire
and<00:00:24.869> an<00:00:25.439> extra<00:00:25.740> wire<00:00:25.920> that<00:00:26.099> was<00:00:26.220> blue<00:00:26.460> I

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
and an extra wire that was blue I

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.550 
and an extra wire that was blue I
actually<00:00:26.910> changed<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.539> black<00:00:27.779> wire<00:00:27.990> out<00:00:28.289> into

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
actually changed the black wire out into

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.990 
actually changed the black wire out into
the<00:00:28.680> blue<00:00:28.830> one<00:00:29.039> because<00:00:29.400> I<00:00:29.550> thought<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.880> blue

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
the blue one because I thought the blue

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.279 
the blue one because I thought the blue
one<00:00:30.179> looks<00:00:30.269> a<00:00:30.420> lot<00:00:30.539> cooler<00:00:30.689> I<00:00:31.019> don't<00:00:31.230> know

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
one looks a lot cooler I don't know

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.020 
one looks a lot cooler I don't know
that's<00:00:31.529> just<00:00:31.679> my<00:00:31.949> preference<00:00:32.219> as<00:00:32.669> you<00:00:32.910> can

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
that's just my preference as you can

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.790 
that's just my preference as you can
tell<00:00:33.210> in<00:00:33.329> this<00:00:33.450> video<00:00:33.750> I'm<00:00:33.989> not<00:00:34.050> that<00:00:34.410> great<00:00:34.559> at

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
tell in this video I'm not that great at

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.470 
tell in this video I'm not that great at
speed<00:00:35.040> so<00:00:35.309> I<00:00:35.340> asked<00:00:35.640> one<00:00:35.760> of<00:00:35.790> my<00:00:35.910> fastest

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
speed so I asked one of my fastest

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.850 
speed so I asked one of my fastest
teammates<00:00:36.899> Jeannie<00:00:37.260> if<00:00:37.590> she<00:00:37.739> would

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
teammates Jeannie if she would

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.229 
teammates Jeannie if she would
demonstrate<00:00:38.280> her<00:00:38.430> speed<00:00:38.670> skills<00:00:38.940> with<00:00:39.120> this

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
demonstrate her speed skills with this

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.700 
demonstrate her speed skills with this
rope<00:00:39.450> yeah<00:00:39.719> like<00:00:39.899> a<00:00:39.930> game<00:00:40.200> face<00:00:40.440> on<00:00:40.559> like

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
rope yeah like a game face on like

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.209 
rope yeah like a game face on like
you're<00:00:40.829> ready<00:00:41.070> go<00:00:41.550> oh<00:00:42.590> is<00:00:43.590> that<00:00:43.680> actually<00:00:44.129> your

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
you're ready go oh is that actually your

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.090 
you're ready go oh is that actually your
face<00:00:44.960> you<00:00:45.960> can<00:00:46.110> actually<00:00:46.260> very<00:00:46.530> faintly<00:00:46.860> see

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
face you can actually very faintly see

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.709 
face you can actually very faintly see
the<00:00:47.219> rope<00:00:47.399> go<00:00:47.640> around<00:00:47.879> which<00:00:48.090> is<00:00:48.239> really<00:00:48.539> rare

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
the rope go around which is really rare

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.180 
the rope go around which is really rare
and<00:00:48.780> speed<00:00:49.110> rope<00:00:49.289> so<00:00:49.530> my<00:00:49.710> opinion<00:00:50.039> that's

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
and speed rope so my opinion that's

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.209 
and speed rope so my opinion that's
pretty<00:00:50.399> cool<00:00:53.960> moving<00:00:54.960> on<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.230> triples<00:00:55.620> I<00:00:55.890> can

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
pretty cool moving on to triples I can

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.830 
pretty cool moving on to triples I can
very<00:00:56.430> easily<00:00:56.699> say<00:00:57.059> that<00:00:57.090> this<00:00:57.420> rope<00:00:57.600> feels

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
very easily say that this rope feels

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.779 
very easily say that this rope feels
great<00:00:58.170> not<00:00:58.649> only<00:00:58.890> is<00:00:59.010> it<00:00:59.039> very<00:00:59.309> comfortable<00:00:59.730> to

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
great not only is it very comfortable to

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.849 
great not only is it very comfortable to
hold<00:01:00.120> that<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:00.660> spends<00:01:00.960> really<00:01:01.230> smooth<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.739> it

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
hold that it spends really smooth and it

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.860 
hold that it spends really smooth and it
surprisingly<00:01:02.399> like<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:03.000> me<00:01:03.120> lightness<00:01:03.660> is

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
surprisingly like to me lightness is

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.359 
surprisingly like to me lightness is
important<00:01:04.320> for<00:01:04.409> speed<00:01:04.680> ropes<00:01:04.920> because<00:01:05.250> it

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
important for speed ropes because it

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.219 
important for speed ropes because it
requires<00:01:05.729> less<00:01:05.970> effort<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.479> spin<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:07.020> it<00:01:07.080> can

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
requires less effort to spin and it can

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.990 
requires less effort to spin and it can
keep<00:01:07.409> you<00:01:07.560> going<00:01:07.770> longer<00:01:08.070> it's<00:01:08.549> weird<00:01:08.820> though

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
keep you going longer it's weird though

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.429 
keep you going longer it's weird though
because<00:01:09.150> when<00:01:09.420> you<00:01:09.510> hold<00:01:09.689> it<00:01:09.900> it's<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.260> bit

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
because when you hold it it's a bit

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:11.929 
because when you hold it it's a bit
heavier<00:01:10.770> than<00:01:10.860> other<00:01:11.159> speed<00:01:11.460> rope<00:01:11.670> that<00:01:11.820> I've

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
heavier than other speed rope that I've

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.030 
heavier than other speed rope that I've
used<00:01:12.119> before<00:01:12.240> but<00:01:12.720> when<00:01:12.900> you<00:01:13.020> actually<00:01:13.260> use<00:01:13.650> it

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
used before but when you actually use it

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.280 
used before but when you actually use it
it's<00:01:14.400> like<00:01:14.610> all<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:15.060> weight<00:01:15.299> just<00:01:15.780> disappear

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
it's like all the weight just disappear

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.570 
it's like all the weight just disappear
so<00:01:16.439> it's<00:01:16.560> really<00:01:16.680> weird<00:01:17.009> it's<00:01:17.189> kind<00:01:17.369> of<00:01:17.400> cool

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
so it's really weird it's kind of cool

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.460 
so it's really weird it's kind of cool
because<00:01:17.729> it's<00:01:18.150> been<00:01:18.360> so<00:01:18.570> smoothly<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.080> feels

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
because it's been so smoothly and feels

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.289 
because it's been so smoothly and feels
so<00:01:19.560> light<00:01:19.860> when<00:01:20.040> you<00:01:20.130> use<00:01:20.400> it<00:01:20.610> I<00:01:20.790> was<00:01:21.000> able<00:01:21.150> to

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
so light when you use it I was able to

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.600 
so light when you use it I was able to
do<00:01:21.450> 60<00:01:21.900> consecutive<00:01:22.049> triple<00:01:22.710> unders<00:01:22.979> five

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
do 60 consecutive triple unders five

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.609 
do 60 consecutive triple unders five
consecutive<00:01:24.000> quarters<00:01:24.509> wonders<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.290> even

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
consecutive quarters wonders and even

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.590 
consecutive quarters wonders and even
managed<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:25.920> quit<00:01:26.220> if<00:01:26.430> you<00:01:26.610> don't<00:01:26.880> know<00:01:27.030> aquent

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
managed to quit if you don't know aquent

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.600 
managed to quit if you don't know aquent
or<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:27.869> quintuple<00:01:28.409> under<00:01:28.860> is<00:01:29.100> when<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.430> rope

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
or a quintuple under is when the rope

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.850 
or a quintuple under is when the rope
makes<00:01:29.850> five<00:01:30.180> full<00:01:30.540> revolutions<00:01:31.259> around<00:01:31.619> your

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
makes five full revolutions around your

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.370 
makes five full revolutions around your
body<00:01:32.009> okay<00:01:32.520> on<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.030> hardware<00:01:33.390> when<00:01:34.110> I<00:01:34.140> got

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
body okay on to the hardware when I got

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.080 
body okay on to the hardware when I got
this<00:01:34.560> rope<00:01:34.770> it<00:01:35.070> was<00:01:35.189> really<00:01:35.460> long<00:01:35.700> so

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
this rope it was really long so

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.060 
this rope it was really long so
obviously<00:01:36.630> I<00:01:36.720> have<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.079> adjust<00:01:37.200> it<00:01:37.590> I<00:01:37.829> don't

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
obviously I have to adjust it I don't

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.710 
obviously I have to adjust it I don't
know<00:01:38.159> about<00:01:38.250> other<00:01:38.549> jumpers<00:01:39.000> but<00:01:39.329> I<00:01:39.360> really

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
know about other jumpers but I really

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.420 
know about other jumpers but I really
prefer<00:01:39.750> my<00:01:40.170> ropes<00:01:40.380> short<00:01:40.680> especially<00:01:40.950> for

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
prefer my ropes short especially for

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.710 
prefer my ropes short especially for
speed<00:01:41.670> because<00:01:42.000> I<00:01:42.119> kind<00:01:42.299> of<00:01:42.360> hunched<00:01:42.570> over

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
speed because I kind of hunched over

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.179 
speed because I kind of hunched over
because<00:01:43.200> I<00:01:43.320> feel<00:01:43.500> like<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.680> short<00:01:43.950> little

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
because I feel like the short little

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.130 
because I feel like the short little
rope<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.759> faster<00:01:45.180> you'll<00:01:45.360> go<00:01:45.540> you<00:01:45.960> know<00:01:46.079> what

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
rope the faster you'll go you know what

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.420 
rope the faster you'll go you know what
I<00:01:46.229> mean<00:01:46.380> but<00:01:46.590> again<00:01:46.890> that's<00:01:47.100> just<00:01:47.220> my

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
I mean but again that's just my

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.130 
I mean but again that's just my
preference<00:01:47.670> however<00:01:48.329> what<00:01:48.750> I<00:01:48.780> want<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.049> go

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
preference however what I want to go

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.050 
preference however what I want to go
adjust<00:01:49.500> it<00:01:49.680> as<00:01:49.860> you<00:01:49.920> can<00:01:50.280> see<00:01:50.460> it's<00:01:50.610> a<00:01:50.670> hardware

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
adjust it as you can see it's a hardware

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.370 
adjust it as you can see it's a hardware
is<00:01:51.149> a<00:01:51.270> little<00:01:51.659> bit<00:01:51.840> more<00:01:52.020> complicated

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
is a little bit more complicated

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.260 
is a little bit more complicated
compared<00:01:52.979> to<00:01:53.070> other<00:01:53.189> ropes<00:01:53.490> it's<00:01:53.850> not<00:01:54.119> as

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
compared to other ropes it's not as

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.300 
compared to other ropes it's not as
simple<00:01:54.720> and<00:01:55.020> there's<00:01:55.170> a<00:01:55.259> lot<00:01:55.409> more<00:01:55.590> pieces<00:01:55.860> so

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
simple and there's a lot more pieces so

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.800 
simple and there's a lot more pieces so
adjusting<00:01:56.790> it<00:01:56.939> was<00:01:57.060> kind<00:01:57.299> of<00:01:57.390> difficult

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
adjusting it was kind of difficult

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:58.819 
adjusting it was kind of difficult
because<00:01:58.079> of<00:01:58.259> all<00:01:58.500> these<00:01:58.680> different

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
because of all these different

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.889 
because of all these different
components<00:01:59.280> in<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.670> hardware<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.540> Rope<00:02:00.719> is

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
components in the hardware the Rope is

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.359 
components in the hardware the Rope is
actually<00:02:01.229> more<00:02:01.350> flexible<00:02:01.890> to<00:02:01.950> move<00:02:02.250> around

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
actually more flexible to move around

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.520 
actually more flexible to move around
and<00:02:02.880> it's<00:02:03.060> obviously<00:02:03.479> more<00:02:03.750> durable<00:02:04.229> which

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
and it's obviously more durable which

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.780 
and it's obviously more durable which
for<00:02:04.740> me<00:02:04.829> is<00:02:04.920> great<00:02:05.100> because<00:02:05.430> I<00:02:05.579> go<00:02:05.759> through

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
for me is great because I go through

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.170 
for me is great because I go through
ropes<00:02:06.210> like<00:02:06.450> literally

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
ropes like literally

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.270 
ropes like literally
every<00:02:07.480> week<00:02:07.660> it's<00:02:07.930> ridiculous<00:02:08.440> another<00:02:08.890> added

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
every week it's ridiculous another added

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.800 
every week it's ridiculous another added
plus<00:02:09.430> was<00:02:09.700> the<00:02:09.850> rubber<00:02:10.060> covering<00:02:10.540> that<00:02:10.660> they

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
plus was the rubber covering that they

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.630 
plus was the rubber covering that they
had<00:02:11.020> on<00:02:11.170> the<00:02:11.260> road<00:02:11.410> not<00:02:11.740> only<00:02:12.010> was<00:02:12.190> it<00:02:12.220> shiny

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
had on the road not only was it shiny

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.090 
had on the road not only was it shiny
and<00:02:13.000> colorful<00:02:13.510> and<00:02:13.690> great<00:02:13.930> the<00:02:14.770> rubber<00:02:14.980> ring

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
and colorful and great the rubber ring

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.740 
and colorful and great the rubber ring
is<00:02:15.280> actually<00:02:15.700> really<00:02:15.880> good<00:02:16.090> safety<00:02:16.570> wise

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
is actually really good safety wise

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.300 
is actually really good safety wise
obviously<00:02:17.380> when<00:02:17.530> you<00:02:17.620> warm<00:02:17.800> yourself<00:02:17.920> it's

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
obviously when you warm yourself it's

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:19.770 
obviously when you warm yourself it's
still<00:02:18.490> kind<00:02:18.670> of<00:02:18.730> hurt<00:02:18.940> but<00:02:19.240> I<00:02:19.270> think<00:02:19.540> it<00:02:19.600> hurts

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
still kind of hurt but I think it hurts

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.630 
still kind of hurt but I think it hurts
a<00:02:19.870> lot<00:02:19.900> less<00:02:20.080> or<00:02:20.710> I<00:02:20.770> started<00:02:21.040> using<00:02:21.160> this<00:02:21.400> rope

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
a lot less or I started using this rope

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.550 
a lot less or I started using this rope
I<00:02:21.790> actually<00:02:21.970> used<00:02:22.240> another<00:02:22.480> rope<00:02:22.750> and<00:02:23.020> it<00:02:23.440> was

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
I actually used another rope and it was

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.740 
I actually used another rope and it was
just<00:02:23.740> completely<00:02:23.830> bare<00:02:24.460> wire<00:02:24.730> and<00:02:25.120> you<00:02:25.510> have

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
just completely bare wire and you have

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.180 
just completely bare wire and you have
no<00:02:26.050> idea<00:02:26.350> how<00:02:26.470> many<00:02:26.530> times<00:02:26.800> I've<00:02:27.040> actually

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
no idea how many times I've actually

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.070 
no idea how many times I've actually
caught<00:02:27.520> myself<00:02:27.670> from<00:02:28.330> doing<00:02:28.390> speed<00:02:28.900> and

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
caught myself from doing speed and

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.190 
caught myself from doing speed and
whipping<00:02:29.380> myself<00:02:29.530> so<00:02:30.010> hard<00:02:30.190> it<00:02:30.460> hurts<00:02:30.880> so<00:02:31.600> bad

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
whipping myself so hard it hurts so bad

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.410 
whipping myself so hard it hurts so bad
the<00:02:32.290> things<00:02:32.650> I<00:02:32.950> endure<00:02:33.250> for<00:02:33.550> jump<00:02:33.730> it's<00:02:34.240> also

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
the things I endure for jump it's also

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.240 
the things I endure for jump it's also
one<00:02:34.690> of<00:02:34.720> the<00:02:34.930> many<00:02:35.170> reasons<00:02:35.410> why<00:02:35.710> I<00:02:35.740> hate<00:02:36.010> speed

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
one of the many reasons why I hate speed

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.190 
one of the many reasons why I hate speed
obviously<00:02:37.210> you<00:02:37.420> guys<00:02:37.570> know<00:02:37.630> I'm<00:02:37.900> more<00:02:38.020> of<00:02:38.140> a

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
obviously you guys know I'm more of a

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.199 
obviously you guys know I'm more of a
freestyle<00:02:38.590> jumper<00:02:39.010> but<00:02:39.250> yeah<00:02:39.430> also<00:02:39.730> there's<00:02:40.090> a

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
freestyle jumper but yeah also there's a

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:41.760 
freestyle jumper but yeah also there's a
little<00:02:40.480> bit<00:02:40.600> of<00:02:40.630> plastic<00:02:41.170> in<00:02:41.290> the<00:02:41.380> top<00:02:41.560> of<00:02:41.709> the

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
little bit of plastic in the top of the

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.470 
little bit of plastic in the top of the
rope<00:02:41.980> to<00:02:42.130> keep<00:02:42.310> the<00:02:42.459> handles<00:02:42.790> in<00:02:42.910> place<00:02:43.090> which

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
rope to keep the handles in place which

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.870 
rope to keep the handles in place which
is<00:02:43.660> so<00:02:44.020> great<00:02:44.200> I<00:02:44.500> actually<00:02:45.070> really<00:02:45.550> do<00:02:45.700> love

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
is so great I actually really do love

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.310 
is so great I actually really do love
this<00:02:46.060> rope<00:02:46.270> and<00:02:46.390> definitely<00:02:46.840> plan<00:02:47.020> on<00:02:47.140> using

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
this rope and definitely plan on using

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.020 
this rope and definitely plan on using
it<00:02:47.560> for<00:02:47.740> future<00:02:47.920> competitions<00:02:48.160> like<00:02:48.880> I<00:02:48.970> think

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
it for future competitions like I think

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.330 
it for future competitions like I think
out<00:02:49.270> regionals<00:02:49.840> in<00:02:49.990> like<00:02:50.140> three<00:02:50.440> weeks<00:02:50.470> so<00:02:51.040> I'm

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
out regionals in like three weeks so I'm

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:52.560 
out regionals in like three weeks so I'm
definitely<00:02:51.700> going<00:02:51.790> to<00:02:51.850> use<00:02:52.000> it<00:02:52.120> there<00:02:52.300> if<00:02:52.480> you

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
definitely going to use it there if you

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.330 
definitely going to use it there if you
participate<00:02:53.170> in<00:02:53.200> CrossFit<00:02:53.709> or<00:02:53.890> just<00:02:54.160> like

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
participate in CrossFit or just like
