okay so few things that I want to
discuss<00:01:37.759> between<00:01:38.240> the<00:01:38.539> two<00:01:38.780> um<00:01:39.970> this<00:01:40.970> heats<00:01:41.479> up

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
discuss between the two um this heats up

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.260 
discuss between the two um this heats up
really<00:01:41.869> really<00:01:42.020> fast<00:01:42.320> actually<00:01:42.680> and<00:01:43.270> the

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
really really fast actually and the

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.880 
really really fast actually and the
difference<00:01:44.570> that<00:01:44.630> I<00:01:44.750> seen<00:01:45.110> between<00:01:45.380> the<00:01:45.679> two

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
difference that I seen between the two

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.630 
difference that I seen between the two
is<00:01:46.659> that<00:01:47.659> you<00:01:48.439> know<00:01:48.560> obviously<00:01:48.710> the<00:01:49.130> shape<00:01:49.399> is

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
is that you know obviously the shape is

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.330 
is that you know obviously the shape is
different<00:01:49.780> you<00:01:50.780> can<00:01:50.899> see<00:01:51.079> this<00:01:51.200> is<00:01:51.409> more<00:01:52.159> of<00:01:52.220> a

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
different you can see this is more of a

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.139 
different you can see this is more of a
cone<00:01:52.640> shape<00:01:52.960> versus<00:01:53.960> just<00:01:54.409> the<00:01:54.619> regular

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:55.149 
cone shape versus just the regular

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:58.330 
cone shape versus just the regular
curling<00:01:56.149> iron<00:01:56.420> shape<00:01:56.689> this<00:01:57.409> goes<00:01:57.619> up<00:01:57.770> to<00:01:57.890> 400

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
curling iron shape this goes up to 400

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.210 
curling iron shape this goes up to 400
degrees<00:01:58.369> and<00:01:58.850> this<00:01:58.970> one's<00:01:59.149> 350<00:01:59.990> so<00:02:00.440> this<00:02:00.920> goes

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
degrees and this one's 350 so this goes

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.449 
degrees and this one's 350 so this goes
up<00:02:01.429> a<00:02:01.610> little<00:02:01.640> bit<00:02:01.970> higher<00:02:02.679> typically<00:02:03.679> i<00:02:03.740> go

00:02:04.449 --> 00:02:04.459 
up a little bit higher typically i go

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:06.969 
up a little bit higher typically i go
around<00:02:04.580> 360<00:02:05.330> anyways<00:02:05.750> when<00:02:06.289> I<00:02:06.319> had<00:02:06.530> a<00:02:06.560> not<00:02:06.740> mean

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
around 360 anyways when I had a not mean

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:08.770 
around 360 anyways when I had a not mean
game<00:02:07.159> for<00:02:07.340> this<00:02:07.429> one<00:02:07.610> and<00:02:07.880> I<00:02:08.179> just<00:02:08.360> see<00:02:08.509> that<00:02:08.690> it

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
game for this one and I just see that it

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.080 
game for this one and I just see that it
did<00:02:08.929> take<00:02:09.140> a<00:02:09.170> little<00:02:09.319> bit<00:02:09.440> longer<00:02:09.679> for<00:02:10.090> porta

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
did take a little bit longer for porta

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.509 
did take a little bit longer for porta
coral<00:02:11.360> but<00:02:11.780> once<00:02:12.019> i<00:02:12.140> went<00:02:12.410> up<00:02:12.530> to<00:02:12.590> a<00:02:12.739> high<00:02:13.099> which

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:13.519 
coral but once i went up to a high which

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:16.809 
coral but once i went up to a high which
is<00:02:13.640> normally<00:02:14.000> how<00:02:14.209> i<00:02:14.239> would<00:02:14.630> go<00:02:15.130> it's<00:02:16.130> a<00:02:16.489> little

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
is normally how i would go it's a little

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:21.970 
is normally how i would go it's a little
bit<00:02:16.940> faster<00:02:17.360> and<00:02:19.060> this<00:02:20.060> here<00:02:20.630> has<00:02:20.930> the<00:02:21.769> same

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
bit faster and this here has the same

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.660 
bit faster and this here has the same
thing<00:02:22.250> has<00:02:22.459> like<00:02:23.319> the<00:02:24.319> off<00:02:24.500> button<00:02:24.830> here<00:02:25.519> and

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
thing has like the off button here and

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.390 
thing has like the off button here and
then<00:02:26.150> you<00:02:26.269> just<00:02:26.480> adjust<00:02:26.630> the<00:02:27.500> heating<00:02:27.920> between

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
then you just adjust the heating between

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.080 
then you just adjust the heating between
these<00:02:28.610> two<00:02:28.819> dials<00:02:29.319> this<00:02:30.319> one<00:02:30.560> here<00:02:31.190> you<00:02:31.970> have

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
these two dials this one here you have

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.289 
these two dials this one here you have
to<00:02:32.180> hold<00:02:32.359> on<00:02:32.690> to<00:02:33.049> the<00:02:33.350> power<00:02:33.920> button<00:02:34.160> for<00:02:34.609> it<00:02:35.150> to

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:35.299 
to hold on to the power button for it to

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:37.539 
to hold on to the power button for it to
forward<00:02:35.690> to<00:02:35.900> light<00:02:36.140> up<00:02:36.320> and<00:02:36.500> then<00:02:36.980> adjust<00:02:37.400> it

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:37.549 
forward to light up and then adjust it

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:38.890 
forward to light up and then adjust it
with<00:02:37.579> the<00:02:37.820> same<00:02:38.060> power<00:02:38.359> button<00:02:38.660> though<00:02:38.750> so

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
with the same power button though so

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.599 
with the same power button though so
there's<00:02:39.049> only<00:02:39.260> one<00:02:39.590> button<00:02:40.299> I<00:02:42.340> notice<00:02:43.340> though

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:43.609 
there's only one button I notice though

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:46.750 
there's only one button I notice though
while<00:02:44.030> using<00:02:44.390> this<00:02:45.109> that<00:02:45.650> I<00:02:45.980> accidentally

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
while using this that I accidentally

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.819 
while using this that I accidentally
push<00:02:47.120> the<00:02:47.390> power<00:02:47.569> button<00:02:47.720> for<00:02:48.200> some<00:02:48.440> reason

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:48.829 
push the power button for some reason

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:50.259 
push the power button for some reason
and<00:02:49.010> it<00:02:49.130> turned<00:02:49.310> off<00:02:49.489> probably<00:02:49.790> like<00:02:50.150> the

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:50.269 
and it turned off probably like the

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:53.050 
and it turned off probably like the
recorders<00:02:50.660> of<00:02:50.840> the<00:02:50.930> way<00:02:51.700> through<00:02:52.700> my<00:02:52.819> hair

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
recorders of the way through my hair

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.360 
recorders of the way through my hair
I've<00:02:54.049> never<00:02:54.260> had<00:02:54.500> a<00:02:54.530> problem<00:02:54.799> with<00:02:55.040> this<00:02:55.160> one

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
I've never had a problem with this one

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.789 
I've never had a problem with this one
though<00:02:55.489> I'm<00:02:55.609> not<00:02:55.640> sure<00:02:55.819> why<00:02:56.920> like<00:02:58.209> maybe<00:02:59.209> cuz

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
though I'm not sure why like maybe cuz

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:01.840 
though I'm not sure why like maybe cuz
there's<00:03:00.799> like<00:03:00.950> just<00:03:01.190> some<00:03:01.340> more<00:03:01.700> of<00:03:01.760> an

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
there's like just some more of an

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.090 
there's like just some more of an
imprint<00:03:02.329> here<00:03:02.540> so<00:03:02.930> I'm<00:03:03.139> not<00:03:03.260> really<00:03:03.410> bumping

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
imprint here so I'm not really bumping

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.280 
imprint here so I'm not really bumping
into<00:03:04.280> it<00:03:04.489> I<00:03:04.579> have<00:03:04.730> to<00:03:04.760> actually<00:03:04.970> press<00:03:05.450> it<00:03:05.690> to

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
into it I have to actually press it to

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.800 
into it I have to actually press it to
turn<00:03:06.500> it<00:03:06.650> off<00:03:06.769> like<00:03:07.430> this<00:03:07.730> I<00:03:08.030> guess<00:03:08.359> I<00:03:08.540> could

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
turn it off like this I guess I could

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.860 
turn it off like this I guess I could
press<00:03:09.200> it<00:03:09.350> easily<00:03:09.920> I'm<00:03:10.700> not<00:03:10.910> sure<00:03:11.269> but<00:03:11.810> it

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
press it easily I'm not sure but it

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.580 
press it easily I'm not sure but it
turned<00:03:12.170> off<00:03:12.549> and<00:03:13.549> then<00:03:13.910> I<00:03:14.299> there<00:03:15.019> was<00:03:15.109> only<00:03:15.319> one

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
turned off and then I there was only one

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.789 
turned off and then I there was only one
occasion<00:03:16.329> one<00:03:17.329> strand<00:03:17.720> where<00:03:18.109> I<00:03:18.139> did<00:03:18.560> bump

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799 
occasion one strand where I did bump

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:22.180 
occasion one strand where I did bump
into<00:03:19.250> the<00:03:19.730> arm<00:03:20.450> part<00:03:20.780> of<00:03:20.959> the<00:03:21.170> curling<00:03:22.100> iron

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
into the arm part of the curling iron

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.660 
into the arm part of the curling iron
and<00:03:22.600> you<00:03:23.600> know<00:03:23.690> just<00:03:23.959> kind<00:03:24.350> of<00:03:24.380> it<00:03:25.250> didn't<00:03:25.489> hurt

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
and you know just kind of it didn't hurt

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.960 
and you know just kind of it didn't hurt
but<00:03:25.730> it's<00:03:26.269> just<00:03:26.600> like<00:03:26.750> a<00:03:26.959> startled<00:03:27.410> so<00:03:28.100> there's

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
but it's just like a startled so there's

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:30.430 
but it's just like a startled so there's
definitely<00:03:29.329> a<00:03:29.600> difference<00:03:29.630> between<00:03:30.200> the<00:03:30.290> two

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
definitely a difference between the two

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.530 
definitely a difference between the two
because<00:03:30.590> this<00:03:30.950> one<00:03:31.130> has<00:03:31.160> a<00:03:31.340> stopper<00:03:31.970> at<00:03:32.420> the

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
because this one has a stopper at the

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.660 
because this one has a stopper at the
end<00:03:32.720> so<00:03:33.109> i<00:03:33.139> can<00:03:33.440> actually<00:03:33.590> you<00:03:34.310> know<00:03:34.430> if<00:03:34.579> i

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
end so i can actually you know if i

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.820 
end so i can actually you know if i
accidentally<00:03:35.299> bump<00:03:35.569> into<00:03:35.720> it<00:03:36.080> and<00:03:36.349> i<00:03:36.799> don't

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:36.830 
accidentally bump into it and i don't

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:38.740 
accidentally bump into it and i don't
get<00:03:37.069> burned<00:03:37.310> or<00:03:37.549> anything<00:03:37.849> like<00:03:37.879> that

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
get burned or anything like that

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.350 
get burned or anything like that
so<00:03:39.200> that's<00:03:39.410> a<00:03:39.560> good<00:03:39.590> thing<00:03:39.770> about<00:03:40.010> this<00:03:40.430> the

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
so that's a good thing about this the

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.780 
so that's a good thing about this the
curls<00:03:41.780> are<00:03:42.140> different<00:03:42.770> though<00:03:42.950> I<00:03:43.310> mean<00:03:43.580> you

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
curls are different though I mean you

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.030 
curls are different though I mean you
can<00:03:43.880> see<00:03:44.060> these<00:03:44.270> are<00:03:44.510> just<00:03:44.660> normal<00:03:45.020> what<00:03:45.950> you

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
can see these are just normal what you

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.680 
can see these are just normal what you
would<00:03:46.190> get<00:03:46.400> with<00:03:46.460> a<00:03:46.670> curling<00:03:47.000> iron<00:03:47.210> you<00:03:47.570> know

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
would get with a curling iron you know

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.620 
would get with a curling iron you know
cuz<00:03:47.900> it's<00:03:48.050> all<00:03:48.190> uniform<00:03:49.190> throughout<00:03:49.450> if<00:03:50.450> I

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
cuz it's all uniform throughout if I

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.290 
cuz it's all uniform throughout if I
were<00:03:50.840> to<00:03:51.020> use<00:03:51.200> this<00:03:51.620> I<00:03:52.340> would<00:03:52.760> get<00:03:52.910> more<00:03:53.150> of<00:03:53.210> a

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:53.300 
were to use this I would get more of a

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.590 
were to use this I would get more of a
beach<00:03:53.540> type<00:03:53.900> wave<00:03:54.440> of<00:03:54.830> curls<00:03:55.430> um<00:03:55.760> it<00:03:56.150> will<00:03:56.480> be

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:56.600 
beach type wave of curls um it will be

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.010 
beach type wave of curls um it will be
tapered<00:03:57.110> and<00:03:57.550> it's<00:03:58.550> sort<00:03:59.180> of<00:03:59.270> it<00:03:59.450> will<00:03:59.570> fit<00:03:59.840> a

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:00.020 
tapered and it's sort of it will fit a

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:01.750 
tapered and it's sort of it will fit a
lot<00:04:00.230> of<00:04:00.350> like<00:04:00.560> the<00:04:00.860> asian<00:04:01.220> style<00:04:01.459> of<00:04:01.580> hair

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
lot of like the asian style of hair

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.820 
lot of like the asian style of hair
because<00:04:02.209> it's<00:04:02.750> usually<00:04:03.020> follow<00:04:03.290> at<00:04:03.530> the<00:04:03.590> top

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:03.830 
because it's usually follow at the top

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:06.699 
because it's usually follow at the top
and<00:04:04.070> then<00:04:04.280> skinny<00:04:04.760> towards<00:04:05.090> the<00:04:05.150> bottom<00:04:05.680> so<00:04:06.680> it

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709 
and then skinny towards the bottom so it

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:09.370 
and then skinny towards the bottom so it
depends<00:04:07.310> on<00:04:07.430> what<00:04:07.610> type<00:04:07.820> of<00:04:07.850> style<00:04:08.540> the<00:04:09.110> curls

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
depends on what type of style the curls

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.430 
depends on what type of style the curls
that<00:04:09.500> you<00:04:09.680> want<00:04:09.950> that<00:04:10.790> you<00:04:11.030> would<00:04:11.209> get<00:04:11.410> so<00:04:12.410> I

on Monica is 120 but I definitely see
the<00:04:22.640> difference<00:04:22.850> of<00:04:23.800> getting<00:04:24.800> this<00:04:24.950> type<00:04:25.220> of

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
the difference of getting this type of

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.810 
the difference of getting this type of
curling<00:04:25.850> iron<00:04:26.030> only<00:04:26.419> because<00:04:26.510> the<00:04:26.840> curls<00:04:27.260> are

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
curling iron only because the curls are

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.370 
curling iron only because the curls are
like<00:04:28.820> fuller<00:04:29.180> and<00:04:29.570> just<00:04:29.810> a<00:04:29.870> few<00:04:30.020> tips<00:04:30.169> when

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
like fuller and just a few tips when

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.280 
like fuller and just a few tips when
using<00:04:30.740> this<00:04:30.890> is<00:04:31.390> with<00:04:32.390> thick<00:04:32.630> strands<00:04:32.990> you'll

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.290 
using this is with thick strands you'll

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:36.909 
using this is with thick strands you'll
get<00:04:33.530> waves<00:04:34.160> more<00:04:34.760> of<00:04:34.820> a<00:04:34.910> wave<00:04:35.150> curl<00:04:35.680> and<00:04:36.680> then

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:36.919 
get waves more of a wave curl and then

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:39.370 
get waves more of a wave curl and then
with<00:04:37.160> thinner<00:04:37.460> strands<00:04:37.850> you'll<00:04:38.270> get<00:04:38.510> these

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380 
with thinner strands you'll get these

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.220 
with thinner strands you'll get these
type<00:04:40.130> of<00:04:40.160> like<00:04:40.610> curls<00:04:41.120> here<00:04:41.510> which<00:04:41.810> I<00:04:41.990> really

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:42.230 
type of like curls here which I really

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:44.500 
type of like curls here which I really
like<00:04:42.560> and<00:04:42.800> for<00:04:43.190> the<00:04:43.280> tutorial<00:04:43.640> that's<00:04:44.330> what

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:44.510 
like and for the tutorial that's what

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:48.430 
like and for the tutorial that's what
I'm<00:04:44.600> going<00:04:44.840> for<00:04:45.340> so<00:04:46.660> there<00:04:47.660> is<00:04:47.810> a<00:04:48.050> two-year

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 
I'm going for so there is a two-year

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.830 
I'm going for so there is a two-year
warranty<00:04:48.620> on<00:04:49.040> this<00:04:49.250> which<00:04:49.580> is<00:04:49.729> great<00:04:50.000> I<00:04:50.300> think

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
warranty on this which is great I think

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.380 
warranty on this which is great I think
the<00:04:51.050> corner<00:04:51.470> is<00:04:51.590> usually<00:04:51.979> 11<00:04:52.610> year<00:04:53.120> I'm<00:04:53.270> not

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:53.390 
the corner is usually 11 year I'm not

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:55.030 
the corner is usually 11 year I'm not
sure<00:04:53.600> of<00:04:53.630> the<00:04:53.810> double<00:04:54.110> check<00:04:54.350> and<00:04:54.650> it<00:04:54.770> comes<00:04:54.919> in

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.040 
sure of the double check and it comes in

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.620 
sure of the double check and it comes in
two<00:04:55.100> sizes<00:04:55.190> this<00:04:55.700> is<00:04:55.850> the<00:04:55.970> three-quarter<00:04:56.450> inch

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:56.630 
two sizes this is the three-quarter inch

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.170 
two sizes this is the three-quarter inch
and<00:04:56.930> there's<00:04:57.380> another<00:04:57.919> one<00:04:58.100> for<00:04:58.310> a<00:04:58.370> one<00:04:58.729> in<00:04:58.910> the

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
and there's another one for a one in the

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.150 
and there's another one for a one in the
great<00:04:59.570> thing<00:04:59.780> about<00:04:59.810> this<00:05:00.080> one<00:05:00.650> compared<00:05:01.070> to

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.160 
great thing about this one compared to

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.340 
great thing about this one compared to
this<00:05:01.430> is<00:05:01.790> that<00:05:02.030> this<00:05:02.240> does<00:05:02.479> one<00:05:02.630> this<00:05:03.140> doesn't

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:03.350 
this is that this does one this doesn't

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:05.590 
this is that this does one this doesn't
have<00:05:03.500> an<00:05:03.890> automatic<00:05:04.190> shut<00:05:04.790> off<00:05:04.820> and<00:05:05.300> i<00:05:05.390> think

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:05.600 
have an automatic shut off and i think

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.710 
have an automatic shut off and i think
maybe<00:05:05.780> that's<00:05:06.020> why<00:05:06.260> I<00:05:06.830> turned<00:05:07.550> off<00:05:07.820> because

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 
maybe that's why I turned off because

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.050 
maybe that's why I turned off because
there<00:05:09.140> is<00:05:09.260> it<00:05:09.620> just<00:05:09.890> automatically<00:05:10.520> shuts<00:05:10.850> off

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.060 
there is it just automatically shuts off

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.800 
there is it just automatically shuts off
I'm<00:05:11.390> not<00:05:11.630> sure<00:05:11.870> that's<00:05:12.590> the<00:05:12.740> reason<00:05:12.950> why<00:05:13.810> I'm

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:14.810 
I'm not sure that's the reason why I'm

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:16.210 
I'm not sure that's the reason why I'm
gonna<00:05:15.080> have<00:05:15.200> to<00:05:15.260> like<00:05:15.410> give<00:05:15.590> this<00:05:15.710> a<00:05:15.770> few<00:05:16.070> more

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:16.220 
gonna have to like give this a few more

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.750 
gonna have to like give this a few more
tests<00:05:16.490> to<00:05:16.820> see<00:05:17.830> but<00:05:18.830> if<00:05:18.919> you're<00:05:19.040> not<00:05:19.130> using<00:05:19.430> it

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:19.760 
tests to see but if you're not using it

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.430 
tests to see but if you're not using it
everything<00:05:20.330> they<00:05:20.510> know<00:05:20.630> just<00:05:20.930> like<00:05:21.050> shut<00:05:21.260> off

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 
everything they know just like shut off
