going to find your game to need a lot
more<00:01:08.899> parts<00:01:09.380> replaced<00:01:09.799> because<00:01:10.250> the

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
more parts replaced because the

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.130 
more parts replaced because the
lubrication<00:01:10.939> would<00:01:11.299> have<00:01:11.390> worn<00:01:11.659> out<00:01:11.869> or

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
lubrication would have worn out or

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:13.990 
lubrication would have worn out or
disappeared<00:01:12.799> dried<00:01:13.130> up<00:01:13.310> all<00:01:13.460> together<00:01:13.610> and

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
disappeared dried up all together and

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.749 
disappeared dried up all together and
then<00:01:14.600> it<00:01:14.720> causes<00:01:14.960> wear<00:01:15.380> patterns<00:01:15.799> quite<00:01:16.520> badly

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:16.759 
then it causes wear patterns quite badly

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:18.880 
then it causes wear patterns quite badly
so<00:01:16.970> it's<00:01:17.840> always<00:01:18.079> best<00:01:18.290> to<00:01:18.409> have<00:01:18.500> your<00:01:18.740> watch

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
so it's always best to have your watch

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.249 
so it's always best to have your watch
serviced<00:01:19.819> regularly<00:01:20.060> before<00:01:20.749> anything

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259

majorly goes wrong now does that advice

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:25.629 
majorly goes wrong now does that advice
make<00:01:24.350> much<00:01:24.590> difference<00:01:24.889> if<00:01:25.159> the<00:01:25.280> watch<00:01:25.460> is

00:01:25.629 --> 00:01:25.639 
make much difference if the watch is

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:27.879 
make much difference if the watch is

than that that's when you get those what

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:02.739 
than that that's when you get those what
happens<00:02:00.889> I've<00:02:00.979> mentioned<00:02:01.189> before<00:02:01.420> now<00:02:02.420> Kyle

if<00:02:03.229> someone's<00:02:03.679> got<00:02:03.829> a<00:02:03.859> Rolex<00:02:04.209> Submariner<00:02:05.209> or<00:02:05.749> a

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
if someone's got a Rolex Submariner or a

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.969 
if someone's got a Rolex Submariner or a
omega<00:02:07.189> seamaster<00:02:07.729> like<00:02:08.300> a<00:02:08.330> diving<00:02:08.630> watch<00:02:09.050> how

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
omega seamaster like a diving watch how

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.070 
omega seamaster like a diving watch how
often<00:02:10.250> should<00:02:10.459> they<00:02:10.759> get<00:02:11.060> that<00:02:11.300> check<00:02:11.660> to<00:02:11.900> see

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
often should they get that check to see

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.220 
often should they get that check to see
whether<00:02:12.290> it's<00:02:13.010> still<00:02:13.310> waterproof<00:02:13.940> or<00:02:14.480> is<00:02:14.990> it

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
whether it's still waterproof or is it

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:16.990 
whether it's still waterproof or is it
or<00:02:15.410> is<00:02:15.530> that<00:02:15.560> not<00:02:15.830> an<00:02:15.950> issue<00:02:16.069> if<00:02:16.490> you've<00:02:16.849> got<00:02:16.970> a

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
or is that not an issue if you've got a

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.670 
or is that not an issue if you've got a
submariner<00:02:17.480> is<00:02:17.900> it<00:02:18.110> always<00:02:18.290> going<00:02:18.560> to<00:02:18.650> be

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
submariner is it always going to be

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.010 
submariner is it always going to be
waterproof<00:02:19.310> yeah<00:02:20.150> a<00:02:20.180> lot<00:02:20.450> of<00:02:20.510> people<00:02:20.720> think

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
waterproof yeah a lot of people think

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.540 
waterproof yeah a lot of people think
that<00:02:21.200> when<00:02:21.440> they<00:02:21.590> buy<00:02:21.740> a<00:02:21.770> waterproof<00:02:22.310> watch

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
that when they buy a waterproof watch

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:23.740 
that when they buy a waterproof watch
it's<00:02:22.970> going<00:02:23.120> to<00:02:23.180> stay<00:02:23.360> waterproof

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
it's going to stay waterproof

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.319 
it's going to stay waterproof
unfortunately<00:02:24.709> that's<00:02:24.799> not<00:02:24.950> the<00:02:25.069> case<00:02:25.329> the

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:26.329 
unfortunately that's not the case the

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:28.050 
unfortunately that's not the case the
only<00:02:26.510> thing<00:02:26.659> that<00:02:26.810> keeps<00:02:27.079> a<00:02:27.200> watch<00:02:27.379> waterpro

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
only thing that keeps a watch waterpro

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.780 
only thing that keeps a watch waterpro
is<00:02:28.630> the<00:02:29.020> style<00:02:29.739> of<00:02:29.830> the<00:02:29.950> case<00:02:30.130> and<00:02:30.160> the<00:02:30.459> terrors

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
is the style of the case and the terrors

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.000 
is the style of the case and the terrors
of<00:02:30.819> the<00:02:30.940> case<00:02:31.209> but<00:02:32.050> most<00:02:32.319> importantly<00:02:32.830> the

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
of the case but most importantly the

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.729 
of the case but most importantly the
gaskets<00:02:33.489> in<00:02:34.180> it<00:02:34.360> even<00:02:34.540> if<00:02:34.840> you<00:02:35.110> picture<00:02:35.319> a<00:02:35.470> case

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
gaskets in it even if you picture a case

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:37.620 
gaskets in it even if you picture a case
without<00:02:35.950> a<00:02:36.130> glossy<00:02:36.430> and<00:02:36.700> basically<00:02:37.209> you've

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
without a glossy and basically you've

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.510 
without a glossy and basically you've
got<00:02:37.750> to<00:02:37.870> hold<00:02:38.020> in<00:02:38.170> the<00:02:38.260> case<00:02:38.500> without<00:02:39.250> the

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
got to hold in the case without the

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.300 
got to hold in the case without the
crown<00:02:39.760> which<00:02:40.000> is<00:02:40.150> the<00:02:40.239> wonder<00:02:40.540> at<00:02:40.599> the<00:02:40.630> side

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
crown which is the wonder at the side

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.410 
crown which is the wonder at the side
without<00:02:42.310> that<00:02:42.640> being<00:02:42.880> there<00:02:43.060> you've<00:02:43.239> got<00:02:43.270> a

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
without that being there you've got a

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.120 
without that being there you've got a
hole<00:02:43.630> in<00:02:43.750> the<00:02:43.870> case<00:02:44.080> so<00:02:44.560> in<00:02:44.650> between<00:02:44.739> those

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
hole in the case so in between those

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.910 
hole in the case so in between those
components<00:02:45.519> and<00:02:45.970> the<00:02:46.750> founder<00:02:47.380> case<00:02:47.590> you've

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
components and the founder case you've

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.309
