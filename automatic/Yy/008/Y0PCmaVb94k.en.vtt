00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
were teams of different eras like our

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.320 
were teams of different eras like our
season<00:00:28.890> was<00:00:29.010> season<00:00:29.130> one<00:00:29.490> for<00:00:29.760> pretty<00:00:30.240> much

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
season was season one for pretty much

everyone<00:00:30.779> watching<00:00:31.230> for<00:00:31.439> us<00:00:31.529> Casas<00:00:32.040> was<00:00:32.279> just

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
everyone watching for us Casas was just

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.850 
everyone watching for us Casas was just
almost<00:00:33.239> unthinkable<00:00:33.690> they<00:00:34.320> were<00:00:34.440> up<00:00:34.559> against

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
almost unthinkable they were up against

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.920 
almost unthinkable they were up against
rosters<00:00:35.460> that<00:00:35.489> had<00:00:36.120> been<00:00:36.300> training<00:00:36.630> together

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
rosters that had been training together

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.080 
rosters that had been training together
solidly<00:00:37.710> for<00:00:37.890> months<00:00:38.219> leading<00:00:38.489> up<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.730> dream

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
solidly for months leading up to dream

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.060 
solidly for months leading up to dream
act<00:00:39.270> fnatic<00:00:39.809> at<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:39.989> replacement<00:00:40.410> and<00:00:40.739> still

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
act fnatic at a replacement and still

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:48.410 
act fnatic at a replacement and still
managed<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.520> win<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.790> tournament<00:00:47.270> so<00:00:48.270> when

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
managed to win the tournament so when

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.819 
managed to win the tournament so when
season<00:00:48.750> two<00:00:48.899> came<00:00:49.140> around<00:00:49.350> obviously<00:00:49.559> the

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
season two came around obviously the

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.010 
season two came around obviously the
patch<00:00:50.070> changes<00:00:50.100> were<00:00:50.760> in<00:00:50.940> there<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.719> game

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
patch changes were in there and the game

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.560 
patch changes were in there and the game
of<00:00:52.350> all<00:00:52.680> I<00:00:52.920> think<00:00:53.010> it<00:00:53.309> was<00:00:53.430> partly<00:00:53.850> that<00:00:53.940> fnatic

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
of all I think it was partly that fnatic

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.930 
of all I think it was partly that fnatic
couldn't<00:00:55.260> adapt<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.739> it<00:00:55.860> in<00:00:55.980> time<00:00:56.190> we<00:00:56.789> were

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
couldn't adapt to it in time we were

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.060 
couldn't adapt to it in time we were
practicing<00:00:57.300> very<00:00:57.600> little<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.199> then<00:00:58.859> when

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
practicing very little and then when

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.160 
practicing very little and then when
this<00:00:59.280> strong<00:00:59.850> tears<00:01:00.059> inside<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.570> show<00:01:00.750> up<00:01:00.930> like

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
this strong tears inside to show up like

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.200 
this strong tears inside to show up like
Moscow<00:01:01.770> five<00:01:01.980> back<00:01:02.219> then<00:01:02.430> we<00:01:02.850> didn't<00:01:03.149> know

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
Moscow five back then we didn't know

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.609 
Moscow five back then we didn't know
what<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:03.480> do<00:01:03.570> vs<00:01:03.809> then<00:01:03.960> they<00:01:04.110> were<00:01:04.199> really<00:01:04.439> good

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
what to do vs then they were really good

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.800 
what to do vs then they were really good
and<00:01:04.769> we<00:01:04.890> were<00:01:05.010> used<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.400> reduce<00:01:05.549> hobbies<00:01:06.510> again

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
and we were used to reduce hobbies again

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.350 
and we were used to reduce hobbies again
they<00:01:07.170> burst<00:01:07.560> onto<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.070> scene<00:01:08.360> demanded

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
they burst onto the scene demanded

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.210 
they burst onto the scene demanded
respect<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:10.080> started<00:01:10.530> winning<00:01:10.799> from

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
respect and started winning from

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.520 
respect and started winning from
basically<00:01:11.939> every<00:01:12.390> single<00:01:12.689> event<00:01:12.750> I<00:01:13.170> think<00:01:13.439> we

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
basically every single event I think we

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.190 
basically every single event I think we
didn't<00:01:13.830> lose<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:13.979> single<00:01:14.270> best-of-three<00:01:15.270> much

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
didn't lose a single best-of-three much

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.310 
didn't lose a single best-of-three much
against<00:01:16.650> American<00:01:16.950> teams<00:01:17.130> we<00:01:17.970> were<00:01:18.659> playing

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
against American teams we were playing

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.850 
against American teams we were playing
good<00:01:19.590> even<00:01:19.920> against<00:01:20.310> Korean<00:01:21.119> teams<00:01:21.740> and<00:01:22.740> I

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
good even against Korean teams and I

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.190 
good even against Korean teams and I
think<00:01:23.189> they<00:01:23.460> were<00:01:23.520> kinda<00:01:24.360> innovating<00:01:25.080> the

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
think they were kinda innovating the

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.380 
think they were kinda innovating the
game<00:01:25.380> at<00:01:25.530> that<00:01:25.710> time<00:01:25.920> I<00:01:26.189> would<00:01:26.640> actually<00:01:26.880> say

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
game at that time I would actually say

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.600 
game at that time I would actually say
that<00:01:27.600> Moscow<00:01:28.470> five<00:01:28.740> has<00:01:29.009> changed<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.430> matter

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
that Moscow five has changed the matter

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.210 
that Moscow five has changed the matter
and<00:01:29.970> they<00:01:30.450> gave<00:01:30.630> a<00:01:30.659> whole<00:01:30.900> new<00:01:30.930> view<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:31.470> what

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
and they gave a whole new view and what

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.550 
and they gave a whole new view and what
you<00:01:32.369> can<00:01:32.520> actually<00:01:32.670> do<00:01:33.060> in<00:01:33.299> this<00:01:33.390> game<00:01:33.630> that

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
you can actually do in this game that

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.800 
you can actually do in this game that
was<00:01:34.770> because<00:01:35.130> we<00:01:35.460> were<00:01:35.700> new<00:01:35.970> to<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.270> scene<00:01:36.600> and

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
was because we were new to the scene and

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.649 
was because we were new to the scene and
we<00:01:37.290> were<00:01:37.350> not<00:01:37.590> affected<00:01:38.189> by<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.729> meta<00:01:39.150> with

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
we were not affected by the meta with

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.120 
we were not affected by the meta with
her<00:01:39.810> like<00:01:40.470> full<00:01:40.860> of<00:01:41.509> ambitions<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:42.899> we<00:01:43.860> really

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
her like full of ambitions and we really

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.220 
her like full of ambitions and we really
wanted<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.670> win<00:01:44.880> everyone<00:01:45.360> interpret

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:46.230 
wanted to win everyone interpret

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:48.330 
wanted to win everyone interpret
so<00:01:47.230> most<00:01:47.410> got<00:01:47.560> five<00:01:47.710> going<00:01:47.950> into<00:01:48.130> the<00:01:48.190> World

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
so most got five going into the World

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.310 
so most got five going into the World
Championship<00:01:48.700> who<00:01:48.850> probably<00:01:49.510> the<00:01:49.900> favorites

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
Championship who probably the favorites

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.200 
Championship who probably the favorites
for<00:01:50.410> the<00:01:50.530> tournament<00:01:50.980> I<00:01:51.040> expected<00:01:51.880> Moscow

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
for the tournament I expected Moscow

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.480 
for the tournament I expected Moscow
five<00:01:52.390> to<00:01:52.600> be<00:01:52.840> in<00:01:53.140> the<00:01:53.320> final<00:01:53.740> even<00:01:54.220> though<00:01:54.340> they

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
five to be in the final even though they

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.970 
five to be in the final even though they
got<00:01:54.640> heard<00:01:54.880> of<00:01:55.000> fourth<00:01:55.270> rows<00:01:56.110> season<00:01:56.770> two<00:01:56.950> I

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:56.980 
got heard of fourth rows season two I

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:58.530 
got heard of fourth rows season two I
think<00:01:57.220> they<00:01:57.670> would<00:01:57.910> have<00:01:57.940> perform<00:01:58.420> much

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
think they would have perform much

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:09.260 
think they would have perform much
better<00:01:58.570> if<00:01:58.960> they<00:01:59.170> had<00:01:59.500> practiced<00:01:59.740> harder

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:15.690 

championship<00:02:10.270> playoffs<00:02:14.160> during<00:02:15.160> very

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
championship playoffs during very

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.970 
championship playoffs during very
between<00:02:16.060> gambit<00:02:16.840> and<00:02:17.050> fnatic<00:02:17.410> started<00:02:17.800> in

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
between gambit and fnatic started in

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.730 
between gambit and fnatic started in
season<00:02:18.130> three<00:02:18.460> were<00:02:18.730> actually<00:02:19.410> showing<00:02:20.410> them

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
season three were actually showing them

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
rivalry that suddenly grew was clear

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.180

marecus<00:02:31.930> team<00:02:32.200> don't<00:02:32.500> have<00:02:32.740> really<00:02:33.010> what

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
marecus team don't have really what

marecus team don't have really what
points<00:02:33.640> the<00:02:34.090> only<00:02:34.240> problem<00:02:34.840> the<00:02:34.990> planning<00:02:35.350> can

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
points the only problem the planning can

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.790 
points the only problem the planning can
have<00:02:36.040> is<00:02:36.220> are<00:02:36.820> themselves<00:02:37.720> I<00:02:37.870> think<00:02:38.620> it's<00:02:38.740> a

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
have is are themselves I think it's a

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.350 
have is are themselves I think it's a
clash<00:02:39.070> of<00:02:39.250> play<00:02:39.460> styles<00:02:39.700> when<00:02:39.940> you<00:02:40.000> compare

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
clash of play styles when you compare

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.930

gambit to fanatically a lot of teams

team you know there are Tina it just

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.720

lose them we were trying to beat them

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.300 
lose them we were trying to beat them
but<00:02:52.350> unfortunately<00:02:53.350> we<00:02:53.470> lost<00:02:53.650> a<00:02:53.830> lot<00:02:53.950> of<00:02:54.010> games

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
but unfortunately we lost a lot of games

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.970 
but unfortunately we lost a lot of games
against<00:02:54.790> them<00:02:54.910> they<00:02:55.300> run<00:02:55.480> both<00:02:55.750> LCS<00:02:56.470> finals

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
against them they run both LCS finals

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.740 
against them they run both LCS finals
they<00:02:57.520> wanted<00:02:57.820> that<00:02:57.940> title<00:02:58.239> they<00:02:58.480> were<00:02:58.600> all

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
they wanted that title they were all

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.390 
they wanted that title they were all
ready<00:02:58.870> to<00:02:58.989> spring<00:02:59.320> champions<00:02:59.830> they<00:03:00.010> wanted<00:03:00.310> to

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
ready to spring champions they wanted to

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:08.500 
ready to spring champions they wanted to
become<00:03:00.520> the<00:03:01.120> European<00:03:01.660> champions

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.420 

I<00:03:08.540> think<00:03:09.470> there's<00:03:09.709> a<00:03:09.830> certain<00:03:09.980> kind<00:03:10.400> of

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
I think there's a certain kind of

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.910 
I think there's a certain kind of
rivalry<00:03:10.940> between<00:03:11.209> us<00:03:11.810> and<00:03:11.989> gambit<00:03:12.290> it's<00:03:12.620> still

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
rivalry between us and gambit it's still

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.860 
rivalry between us and gambit it's still
hard<00:03:13.129> to<00:03:13.190> understand<00:03:13.670> their<00:03:14.180> playstyle

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
hard to understand their playstyle

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.190 
hard to understand their playstyle
because<00:03:15.349> it's<00:03:15.500> changing<00:03:15.920> I<00:03:16.099> think<00:03:16.489> that<00:03:16.610> they

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
because it's changing I think that they

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.449 
because it's changing I think that they
stepped<00:03:18.200> up<00:03:18.319> their<00:03:18.500> game<00:03:18.830> and<00:03:19.010> they're

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
stepped up their game and they're

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:20.470 
stepped up their game and they're
playing<00:03:19.730> really<00:03:19.970> good<00:03:20.180> at<00:03:20.269> the<00:03:20.360> moment

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
playing really good at the moment

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.630 
playing really good at the moment
there's<00:03:21.349> a<00:03:21.440> lot<00:03:21.590> of<00:03:21.680> arguments<00:03:22.159> between<00:03:22.340> the

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
there's a lot of arguments between the

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.430 
there's a lot of arguments between the
two<00:03:22.790> teams<00:03:23.000> of<00:03:23.239> who<00:03:23.629> is<00:03:23.840> the<00:03:24.049> most<00:03:24.230> successful

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
two teams of who is the most successful

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.410 
two teams of who is the most successful
it's<00:03:25.129> pretty<00:03:25.310> much<00:03:25.400> impossible<00:03:25.549> because<00:03:26.330> you

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
it's pretty much impossible because you

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.119 
it's pretty much impossible because you
can<00:03:26.569> argue<00:03:26.720> for<00:03:27.019> both<00:03:27.140> things<00:03:27.410> the<00:03:27.709> Fertile

00:03:28.119 --> 00:03:28.129 
can argue for both things the Fertile

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:31.300 
can argue for both things the Fertile
can<00:03:28.340> both<00:03:28.519> results<00:03:29.060> of<00:03:29.420> course<00:03:29.810> limit<00:03:30.310> gambit

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
can both results of course limit gambit

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.880 
can both results of course limit gambit
yes<00:03:31.580> but<00:03:31.940> I<00:03:31.970> think<00:03:32.060> that<00:03:32.360> fnatic<00:03:32.959> overall<00:03:33.500> have

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
yes but I think that fnatic overall have

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:36.339 
yes but I think that fnatic overall have
been<00:03:34.190> the<00:03:34.970> European<00:03:35.750> team<00:03:35.959> in<00:03:36.140> league<00:03:36.260> of

00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:36.349 
been the European team in league of

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:38.350 
been the European team in league of
legends<00:03:36.739> but<00:03:37.069> you<00:03:37.190> can<00:03:37.340> bet<00:03:37.519> come<00:03:37.819> the<00:03:37.970> end<00:03:38.090> of

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
legends but you can bet come the end of

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.259 
legends but you can bet come the end of
the<00:03:38.690> spring<00:03:38.930> split<00:03:39.170> it<00:03:39.560> will<00:03:39.890> be<00:03:40.040> fnatic<00:03:40.730> vs.

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.269 
the spring split it will be fnatic vs.

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:43.720 
the spring split it will be fnatic vs.
