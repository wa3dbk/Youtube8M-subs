this is like a conversion kit so you can
put<00:00:52.230> it<00:00:53.149> almost<00:00:54.149> anywhere<00:00:54.480> on<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.840> board<00:00:55.050> not

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
put it almost anywhere on the board not

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.680 
put it almost anywhere on the board not
as<00:00:55.350> good<00:00:55.500> as<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.710> est<00:00:56.010> bindings<00:00:56.399> but<00:00:56.610> if<00:00:57.570> you

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
is put the bolt things through the

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:35.230 
is put the bolt things through the
channel<00:01:31.930> set<00:01:32.930> up<00:01:33.050> where<00:01:33.259> you<00:01:33.380> want<00:01:34.090> I'm<00:01:35.090> going

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
channel set up where you want I'm going

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.460 
channel set up where you want I'm going
to<00:01:35.300> set<00:01:35.450> it<00:01:35.540> up<00:01:35.630> on<00:01:35.750> the<00:01:35.869> reference<00:01:36.259> so

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
to set it up on the reference so

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:37.630 
to set it up on the reference so
basically<00:01:36.800> my<00:01:36.979> binding<00:01:37.280> is<00:01:37.340> going<00:01:37.490> to<00:01:37.580> be

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
basically my binding is going to be

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.240 
basically my binding is going to be
straight<00:01:37.910> Center<00:01:38.300> because<00:01:38.920> you<00:01:39.920> know<00:01:40.009> I<00:01:40.070> like

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
straight Center because you know I like

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.580 
straight Center because you know I like
to<00:01:40.280> ride<00:01:40.520> switch<00:01:40.729> to<00:01:41.720> tail<00:01:41.930> presses<00:01:42.200> and<00:01:42.470> all

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
to ride switch to tail presses and all

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.359 
to ride switch to tail presses and all
sorts<00:01:42.830> of<00:01:43.600> kind<00:01:44.600> of<00:01:44.660> dumb<00:01:44.869> tricks<00:01:45.229> so<00:01:45.619> I<00:01:45.830> guess

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
sorts of kind of dumb tricks so I guess

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:47.440 
sorts of kind of dumb tricks so I guess
some<00:01:46.490> of<00:01:46.550> my<00:01:46.670> bindings<00:01:47.000> up<00:01:47.090> right<00:01:47.270> in<00:01:47.420> the

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
some of my bindings up right in the

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.620 
some of my bindings up right in the
middle

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.050 

so<00:01:50.170> I<00:01:50.200> can<00:01:50.380> do<00:01:51.070> all<00:01:51.100> sorts<00:01:51.250> of<00:01:51.460> stuff<00:01:51.729> so<00:01:51.909> once

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
so I can do all sorts of stuff so once

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.950 
so I can do all sorts of stuff so once
you<00:01:52.150> put<00:01:52.330> your<00:01:52.619> base<00:01:53.619> plate<00:01:54.450> into<00:01:55.450> the<00:01:55.630> binding

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
you put your base plate into the binding

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.789 
you put your base plate into the binding
at<00:01:56.110> the<00:01:56.409> setting<00:01:56.770> you<00:01:56.830> want<00:01:57.009> -<00:01:57.340> 12<00:01:58.180> million<00:01:58.420> 12

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
at the setting you want - 12 million 12

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:04.460 
at the setting you want - 12 million 12
the<00:01:59.799> buck<00:02:00.009> stance

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470

what you want to do is kind of get you
know<00:02:07.790> just<00:02:08.790> estimate<00:02:09.240> so<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.810> reference

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
know just estimate so the reference

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.500 
know just estimate so the reference
point<00:02:10.380> is<00:02:10.500> right<00:02:10.680> right<00:02:11.340> down<00:02:11.520> the<00:02:11.670> middle<00:02:11.700> you

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
point is right right down the middle you

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.000 
point is right right down the middle you
like<00:02:12.690> writing<00:02:12.900> back<00:02:13.170> and<00:02:13.530> of<00:02:13.590> course<00:02:13.770> you<00:02:13.890> can

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
like writing back and of course you can

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.930 
like writing back and of course you can
move<00:02:14.100> back<00:02:14.310> or<00:02:14.610> forward<00:02:14.930> everyone<00:02:15.930> so<00:02:16.940> lined

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
move back or forward everyone so lined

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.760 
move back or forward everyone so lined
up<00:02:18.090> on<00:02:18.210> the<00:02:18.240> reference<00:02:18.660> because<00:02:19.350> that's<00:02:19.590> right

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
up on the reference because that's right

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:26.660 
up on the reference because that's right
down<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:20.010> middle

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.670 

just<00:02:27.670> like<00:02:27.820> that

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
just like that

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.530 
just like that
what<00:02:30.250> you<00:02:30.370> want<00:02:30.489> to<00:02:30.579> do<00:02:30.700> is<00:02:30.909> put<00:02:31.120> your<00:02:31.239> screws

what you want to do is put your screws
in<00:02:35.849> you<00:02:36.849> don't<00:02:36.939> want<00:02:37.030> to<00:02:37.180> make<00:02:37.269> them<00:02:37.420> super

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
in you don't want to make them super

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.339 
in you don't want to make them super
tight<00:02:37.989> it<00:02:39.569> if<00:02:40.569> you<00:02:40.689> want<00:02:40.870> to<00:02:40.900> be<00:02:41.049> able<00:02:41.109> to<00:02:41.200> move

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:51.129 
actually screwed in but not tight line

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:53.339 
actually screwed in but not tight line
it<00:02:51.250> up<00:02:51.400> using<00:02:51.639> the<00:02:52.030> little<00:02:52.659> slot<00:02:52.930> where<00:02:53.319> you

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:53.349 
it up using the little slot where you

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:55.500 
it up using the little slot where you
want<00:02:53.650> so<00:02:53.980> like<00:02:54.700> I<00:02:54.790> said<00:02:54.969> I'm<00:02:55.150> putting<00:02:55.299> it<00:02:55.480> right

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
want so like I said I'm putting it right

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.199 
want so like I said I'm putting it right
down<00:02:55.719> the<00:02:55.810> middle<00:02:55.840> so<00:02:56.170> the<00:02:56.290> reference<00:02:56.560> line<00:02:57.209> so

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
down the middle so the reference line so

00:02:58.209 --> 00:02:59.099 
down the middle so the reference line so
just<00:02:58.359> make<00:02:58.480> sure<00:02:58.510> it's<00:02:58.750> right<00:02:58.900> in<00:02:59.019> the<00:02:59.079> middle

00:02:59.099 --> 00:02:59.109 
just make sure it's right in the middle

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:02.190 
just make sure it's right in the middle
you<00:02:59.700> got<00:03:00.700> it<00:03:00.819> at<00:03:00.939> the<00:03:01.030> angle<00:03:01.389> your<00:03:01.930> binding

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
you got it at the angle your binding

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.819 
you got it at the angle your binding
angle<00:03:02.560> you<00:03:02.680> want<00:03:04.109> and<00:03:05.109> then<00:03:05.409> all<00:03:05.500> you<00:03:05.620> need<00:03:05.650> to

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:05.829 
angle you want and then all you need to

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:09.210 
angle you want and then all you need to
do<00:03:05.950> is<00:03:06.099> just<00:03:06.250> screwed<00:03:06.519> on<00:03:06.669> tight<00:03:06.909> and<00:03:08.220> that's

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
do is just screwed on tight and that's

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.619 
do is just screwed on tight and that's
how<00:03:09.430> you<00:03:10.590> put<00:03:11.590> these<00:03:12.120> bindings<00:03:13.120> in<00:03:13.269> there<00:03:13.389> the

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:13.629 
how you put these bindings in there the

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:16.740 
how you put these bindings in there the
baseplate<00:03:14.230> into<00:03:14.590> the<00:03:14.739> natural<00:03:15.730> board<00:03:16.150> if<00:03:16.629> you

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
baseplate into the natural board if you

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.080 
baseplate into the natural board if you
have<00:03:16.780> the<00:03:16.989> est<00:03:17.409> bindings<00:03:17.859> it's<00:03:18.790> pretty<00:03:18.969> much

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
have the est bindings it's pretty much

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.479 
have the est bindings it's pretty much
the<00:03:19.209> same<00:03:19.389> thing<00:03:19.689> but<00:03:19.719> of<00:03:19.989> course<00:03:20.489> you're

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
the same thing but of course you're

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:22.679 
the same thing but of course you're
going<00:03:21.609> to<00:03:21.669> be<00:03:21.819> putting<00:03:22.030> the<00:03:22.180> screws<00:03:22.419> on<00:03:22.599> the

00:03:22.679 --> 00:03:22.689 
going to be putting the screws on the

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:25.080 
going to be putting the screws on the
slots<00:03:22.989> in<00:03:23.200> an<00:03:23.290> offside<00:03:23.709> course<00:03:24.519> ot<00:03:24.790> be<00:03:24.939> way

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
slots in an offside course ot be way

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.000 
slots in an offside course ot be way
more<00:03:25.120> adjustability<00:03:25.689> so

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
more adjustability so

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:35.520 
more adjustability so
those<00:03:28.430> are<00:03:28.580> better<00:03:28.700> but<00:03:31.209> mine<00:03:32.209> uses

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.590 

you
