00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:09.889
 so part 2 here we are already shooting with 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:14.670
 flashlight to show so i 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:17.360
 in the hot box temperature sensor 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.360
 Greek 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:26.140
 here so here what we see turns out 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:28.770
 right engine can look like this 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:35.650
 This sensor looks like 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:36.520
 that is, just taken the usual tee on 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:42.190
 one second 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:45.430
 and 3 flanges go that are screwed into 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:51.040
 this tee and which can connect 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:58.239
 hoses there such a Christmas tree garbage leads here 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:01:00.790
 respectively a thread 10 on 1 there on 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:08.650
 my thread does not remember exactly yes 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:09.700
 mine is 10 by 10 and step 1 is connected all 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:13.409
 basically 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:16.270
 a regular place will come to me later 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.760
 I think the oil pressure sensor 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.420
 in the most important for soo borey he will 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:30.060
 put on such 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:37.130
 elementary transition here with him 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:37.130
 cells go like this 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:49.259
 installation shit that is it 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:53.189
 put so screwed 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:55.939
 instead of the filter and then here 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:02:02.340
 wind the filter itself 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:07.640
 there are different too fails 22 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:12.000
 by half 20 by half three quarters 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:19.940
 1618 and a half that is possible in principle 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.940
 pick at all by 2
