Hey whats up perrymons, I'm Winghaven and I left the "hello hello" behind.

00:00:04.994 --> 00:00:08.534
But before going with the gameplay i would like to comment a small detail about this game that you'll see now

00:00:09.483 --> 00:00:19.701
Now, what I just have done, if you didn't realize I was reloading and when the enemy appeared I switched between pistol and primary gun

00:00:20.324 --> 00:00:26.521
and here I do it for the second time, why I do that for? To cancel the reload and allow me to keep shooting with the AEK

00:00:28.187 --> 00:00:41.262
I recommend you to do this if you know that you have 10 or more bullets in the primary weapon and the enemy is relativelly close to you, so 10bullets would be enough

00:00:41.654 --> 00:00:49.545
In the other hand, if you have less than 10 bullets i recommend you to change inmediatelly to the pistol

00:00:49.948 --> 00:00:58.123
and if the enemy is far enough and you can get cover, complete the reload and then try to kill him the primary weapon.

00:00:58.954 --> 00:01:08.903
With all this explained, I'll continue with the gameplay. I am playing rush in wake island, and as you can see, im playing with the new "post-patch" aek.

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:19.586
Sorry for the delay, but I was without pc for 1 week. this is my first contact with the AEK it feels pretty good, and i like it. 

00:01:19.851 --> 00:01:23.830
But now, I have a little dilema, I don't know which weapon to use, AEK or M16A3. 

00:01:24.963 --> 00:01:29.718
So the thing i usually do, for publics and even when I compete, I choose the weapon depending on what map im going to play. 

00:01:30.217 --> 00:01:43.932
I play with aek for close maps like bazaar, metro or seine and I play with the m16 for longer ranges like teheran for example.

00:01:44.512 --> 00:01:51.780
I know this map has longe range situations, but i wanted to test the new aek in all situations, and as i said before, the feeling of the post post-patch aek is good.

00:01:52.818 --> 00:02:02.974
In this gameplay I feelt like a little weak with the AEK, haven't played with it for a while and it was like I need to get used to it

00:02:03.177 --> 00:02:10.666
but I have preared an AEK video on bazaar which I'll upload it tomorrow or the day after tomorrow

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:20.602
I scored like a 30-3, the duels were mostly close range and that's where the AEK is really good

00:02:21.593 --> 00:02:28.177
Here as you can see the enemies are locked in their own base, even though they're supossed to attack

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:40.080
Not because of us but them, because they weren't moving a lot from their own base, as you can see there are a lot of snipers, support with bipod camping.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:46.585
They weren't doing any kind of effort to leave their own base, so I tried to do my best

00:02:46.896 --> 00:02:53.937
because when they are camping like that is pretty hard to make good strikes, but I managed to play a decent gameplay 

00:02:54.374 --> 00:02:56.836
and when the enemies killed me I was getting revive almost every time

00:02:57.631 --> 00:03:05.727
Nothing interesting happened about the gameplay, so I hope to upload close quarters with the new weapons

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:15.695
I'll try to make CQ videos with the AEK, since the maps are close and is where that weapon acts at its best

00:03:16.397 --> 00:03:21.311
I bought the premium like 10h ago but EA still haven't sent me the key

00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:28.035
I guess EA has a cam and they saw the retarded face and they thought "We'll send him the key within a month so fuck him"

00:03:28.378 --> 00:03:33.307
But whenever I get it you'll have all the videos you want because as you know I want to upload a lot more videos

00:03:33.684 --> 00:03:39.629
I always say and then I've some delays, but this time I've excuse, my motherboard crashed

00:03:40.127 --> 00:03:47.441
Talking about next videos I want to keep going with the #BFTips, and also the wallbangings videos

00:03:47.831 --> 00:03:59.531
I released the bazaar one and you liked a lot and you demanded a new one, so I'll get burwan/reverde who always help me in the videos

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:05.165
and I'll bring you a new wallbanbing video, I guess metro or bazaar, which are interestings maps to make wallbang.

00:04:05.495 --> 00:04:10.795
Here I got killed finally by one of the camping snipers after I don't know how many kills I got

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:24.928
Nothing else interesting happens, I want to comment a little detail, as you can see I'm with my beloved G18

00:04:25.319 --> 00:04:33.526
but there's a weapon that I use on xbox called 93R, which you unlock playing CO-OP and I really recomment it because is really good

00:04:34.023 --> 00:04:36.571
So I'll try to unlock it

00:04:36.929 --> 00:04:45.224
Here I was checking how the recoil worked exactly, and as you saw is was up and to the left 

00:04:45.552 --> 00:04:48.988
so in order to control it you've to move the mouse down and to the right, obviously 

00:04:49.608 --> 00:05:01.495
And here If I'd have had the 93R... right now, I'd have killed him in the first burst, here with the G18 I fail a little bit but I manage to kill him

00:05:02.073 --> 00:05:07.738
I'll try to unlock the 93R and do a little review because, personally, I like a little bit more than the G18

00:05:08.422 --> 00:05:16.581
We're reaching the end of the video, I know is a little bit short, but I was testing the AEK post-patch

00:05:16.942 --> 00:05:23.555
The video I want to upload in bazaar is around 8-9mins, and I think you'd have more fun watching it

00:05:23.854 --> 00:05:26.330
because this one wasn't nothing especial so I'm sorry for that

00:05:26.552 --> 00:05:35.785
So like always, if you liked it, eventhough is a little short thumps up &amp; favorites, which that motivates me a lot and I won't get tired of saying it

00:05:36.694 --> 00:05:40.777
Like always, thanks for watching and cya later!

00:05:41.464 --> 00:05:46.924
eh! haven't left yet, I got killed, I leave now, cya people! muak!
