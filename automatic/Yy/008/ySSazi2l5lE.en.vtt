00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
because I have not seen any other

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.770 
because I have not seen any other
tactical<00:03:02.070> snipers<00:03:02.430> on<00:03:02.850> YouTube<00:03:03.270> and<00:03:03.390> so<00:03:03.540> to<00:03:03.600> me

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
tactical snipers on YouTube and so to me

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.520 
tactical snipers on YouTube and so to me
64<00:03:04.380> 3<00:03:04.590> is<00:03:04.740> very<00:03:05.100> respectable<00:03:05.880> and<00:03:06.090> as<00:03:06.990> far<00:03:07.470> as

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
64 3 is very respectable and as far as

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.010 
64 3 is very respectable and as far as
dragon<00:03:08.010> gameplay<00:03:08.370> is<00:03:08.610> concerned<00:03:09.000> I<00:03:09.180> think<00:03:09.240> and

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
dragon gameplay is concerned I think and

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:13.130 
dragon gameplay is concerned I think and
I'm<00:03:10.440> even<00:03:10.710> desensitized<00:03:11.550> to<00:03:11.730> the<00:03:12.510> high<00:03:12.870> amount

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
I'm even desensitized to the high amount

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.070 
I'm even desensitized to the high amount
of<00:03:13.200> kills<00:03:13.350> like<00:03:13.530> the<00:03:13.680> 60<00:03:14.130> 70<00:03:14.610> plus<00:03:14.820> range<00:03:15.060> I<00:03:15.270> you

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
but if it's a gameplay I generally won't

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.580 
but if it's a gameplay I generally won't
even<00:03:21.420> watch<00:03:21.690> the<00:03:21.870> game<00:03:21.990> play<00:03:22.140> unless<00:03:22.320> it's

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
even watch the game play unless it's

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.620 
even watch the game play unless it's
absolutely<00:03:22.890> insane<00:03:23.580> like<00:03:24.000> over<00:03:24.330> on<00:03:24.510> their

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630

absolutely insane like over on their
kills<00:03:24.840> with<00:03:25.110> something<00:03:25.500> then<00:03:26.040> maybe<00:03:26.340> I'll

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
kills with something then maybe I'll

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.340 
kills with something then maybe I'll
take<00:03:26.730> my<00:03:26.940> some<00:03:27.270> some<00:03:27.450> time<00:03:27.660> to<00:03:27.780> watch<00:03:27.990> the<00:03:28.200> game

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:36.200 
good um the gameplay market if you will
the<00:04:34.139> reason<00:04:34.530> why<00:04:34.800> people<00:04:35.610> have<00:04:35.879> such<00:04:36.060> high

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
the reason why people have such high

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.960 
the reason why people have such high
standards<00:04:36.419> now<00:04:36.720> I<00:04:36.900> think<00:04:37.560> is<00:04:37.740> because<00:04:38.220> a<00:04:38.550> the

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
standards now I think is because a the

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:40.580 
standards now I think is because a the
market<00:04:39.270> is<00:04:39.330> oversaturated<00:04:39.690> we<00:04:40.169> got<00:04:40.319> a<00:04:40.349> lot<00:04:40.560> of

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
market is oversaturated we got a lot of

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.129 
market is oversaturated we got a lot of
people<00:04:40.770> who<00:04:41.310> get<00:04:41.639> you<00:04:41.819> know<00:04:41.940> 80<00:04:42.419> kills<00:04:42.870> and<00:04:43.080> I

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:43.139 
people who get you know 80 kills and I

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:44.779 
people who get you know 80 kills and I
think<00:04:43.379> I'm<00:04:43.560> gonna<00:04:43.740> be<00:04:43.860> YouTube<00:04:44.099> famous<00:04:44.340> let<00:04:44.699> me

00:04:47.869 --> 00:04:47.879 
put this stuff on and that's why we have

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:49.070

so<00:04:48.060> many<00:04:48.120> high<00:04:48.330> kill<00:04:48.509> game<00:04:48.659> boys<00:04:48.780> I<00:04:48.900> think

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
so many high kill game boys I think

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.409 
so many high kill game boys I think
that's<00:04:49.229> a<00:04:49.349> big<00:04:49.530> reason<00:04:49.680> and<00:04:50.039> also<00:04:50.610> I<00:04:51.060> think

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:51.419 
that's a big reason and also I think

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:53.839 
that's a big reason and also I think

back in cod4 if you would get or World

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.490 
back in cod4 if you would get or World
War<00:05:27.479> if<00:05:27.539> you<00:05:27.629> would<00:05:27.750> get<00:05:27.840> the<00:05:27.960> dogs<00:05:28.139> or<00:05:28.319> maybe

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:28.500 
War if you would get the dogs or maybe

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.309 
War if you would get the dogs or maybe
be<00:05:28.710> between<00:05:29.250> 5<00:05:29.699> and<00:05:29.969> 10<00:05:30.090> kills<00:05:30.360> tops<00:05:30.659> now<00:05:31.259> you

00:05:31.309 --> 00:05:31.319 
be between 5 and 10 kills tops now you

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:33.649 
be between 5 and 10 kills tops now you
can<00:05:31.560> get<00:05:31.680> killstreaks<00:05:32.009> they<00:05:32.759> get<00:05:33.000> you<00:05:33.180> you

00:05:33.649 --> 00:05:33.659 
can get killstreaks they get you you

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:35.990 
can get killstreaks they get you you
know<00:05:33.750> 20<00:05:34.169> kills<00:05:34.380> 25<00:05:34.889> kills<00:05:35.190> and<00:05:35.370> because<00:05:35.969> of

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 
know 20 kills 25 kills and because of

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.269 
know 20 kills 25 kills and because of
that<00:05:36.120> that<00:05:36.810> to<00:05:37.080> me<00:05:37.110> is<00:05:37.259> the<00:05:37.469> main<00:05:37.830> reason<00:05:38.159> why

00:05:38.269 --> 00:05:38.279 
that that to me is the main reason why

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:39.559 
that that to me is the main reason why
people<00:05:38.490> look<00:05:38.729> for<00:05:38.880> high<00:05:39.000> school<00:05:39.210> and<00:05:39.270> gameplay

00:05:39.559 --> 00:05:39.569 
people look for high school and gameplay

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:41.959 
people look for high school and gameplay
because<00:05:40.020> if<00:05:40.319> you<00:05:40.440> only<00:05:40.590> get<00:05:40.860> 30<00:05:41.069> kills<00:05:41.400> then

00:05:41.959 --> 00:05:41.969 
because if you only get 30 kills then

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:43.339 
because if you only get 30 kills then
chances<00:05:42.630> are<00:05:42.750> you<00:05:42.930> could<00:05:43.050> have<00:05:43.169> been<00:05:43.319> just

00:05:43.339 --> 00:05:43.349 
chances are you could have been just

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:44.890 
chances are you could have been just
using<00:05:43.860> you<00:05:43.979> know<00:05:44.009> a<00:05:44.130> chopper<00:05:44.669> gunner

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:44.900 
using you know a chopper gunner

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:46.999 
using you know a chopper gunner
lightning<00:05:45.900> striking<00:05:46.139> hellstorm<00:05:46.529> missile<00:05:46.560> and

00:05:46.999 --> 00:05:47.009 
lightning striking hellstorm missile and

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:49.490 
lightning striking hellstorm missile and
just<00:05:47.610> getting<00:05:47.819> that<00:05:47.969> streak<00:05:48.690> once<00:05:49.050> will<00:05:49.380> get

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:49.500 
just getting that streak once will get

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.800 
just getting that streak once will get
you<00:05:49.620> 30<00:05:49.770> kills<00:05:50.099> so<00:05:50.699> I<00:05:50.729> think<00:05:50.849> that<00:05:51.120> because<00:05:51.690> the

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:51.810 
you 30 kills so I think that because the

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.450 
you 30 kills so I think that because the
killstreaks<00:05:52.469> the<00:05:52.740> score<00:05:53.009> streaks<00:05:53.219> are<00:05:53.340> so

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:53.460 
killstreaks the score streaks are so

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.820 
killstreaks the score streaks are so
