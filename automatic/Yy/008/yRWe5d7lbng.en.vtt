00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.440 
just kind of like going through I was
like<00:02:12.950> oh<00:02:13.130> maybe<00:02:13.310> even<00:02:13.580> get<00:02:13.670> some<00:02:13.700> gems<00:02:14.060> and<00:02:14.240> I

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
like oh maybe even get some gems and I

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.120 
like oh maybe even get some gems and I
actually<00:02:14.600> went<00:02:15.140> up<00:02:15.200> with<00:02:15.350> ton<00:02:15.500> of<00:02:15.530> gems<00:02:15.800> and

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
actually went up with ton of gems and

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.130 
actually went up with ton of gems and
I'm<00:02:16.550> really<00:02:16.820> saving<00:02:17.150> up<00:02:17.240> for<00:02:17.270> that<00:02:17.480> third

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
I'm really saving up for that third

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.700 
I'm really saving up for that third
builder<00:02:18.680> which<00:02:18.980> is<00:02:19.510> 500<00:02:20.510> gems<00:02:20.780> about<00:02:21.470> a

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:21.710 
builder which is 500 gems about a

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.070 
builder which is 500 gems about a
hundred<00:02:22.190> and<00:02:22.220> three<00:02:22.400> gems<00:02:22.670> away<00:02:22.970> and<00:02:23.210> I<00:02:23.720> think

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
hundred and three gems away and I think

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.020 
hundred and three gems away and I think
that's<00:02:24.230> totally<00:02:24.440> possible<00:02:24.800> with<00:02:25.760> all<00:02:25.910> the

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
that's totally possible with all the

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.280 
that's totally possible with all the
achievements<00:02:26.090> and<00:02:26.600> stuff<00:02:26.750> that<00:02:26.900> you<00:02:26.960> get<00:02:27.110> as

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
let's get I got the same defensive

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.910 
let's get I got the same defensive
design<00:02:50.120> as<00:02:50.390> the<00:02:50.690> last<00:02:50.900> video<00:02:51.230> when<00:02:51.440> we<00:02:51.470> came<00:02:51.740> up

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
design as the last video when we came up

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.950 
design as the last video when we came up
with<00:02:52.040> it<00:02:52.220> and<00:02:52.400> so<00:02:53.390> let's<00:02:53.570> see<00:02:53.660> how<00:02:53.750> it's<00:02:53.900> been

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:53.960 
with it and so let's see how it's been

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.920 
with it and so let's see how it's been
doing<00:02:54.400> so<00:02:55.400> I<00:02:55.460> kind<00:02:55.910> of<00:02:56.000> got<00:02:56.120> destroyed<00:02:56.270> by

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
doing so I kind of got destroyed by

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.120 
doing so I kind of got destroyed by
minions<00:02:57.500> by<00:02:57.860> Dean<00:02:58.810> this<00:02:59.810> not<00:03:00.380> minions<00:03:00.620> it<00:03:01.040> was

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
minions by Dean this not minions it was

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.160 
minions by Dean this not minions it was
just<00:03:01.340> combination<00:03:02.030> of<00:03:02.150> things<00:03:02.360> he<00:03:02.540> had<00:03:02.570> a<00:03:02.660> he

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
just combination of things he had a he

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.449 
just combination of things he had a he
had<00:03:03.260> a<00:03:03.290> good<00:03:03.410> troop<00:03:03.740> composition<00:03:03.920> but<00:03:04.340> those

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
had a good troop composition but those

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.930 
had a good troop composition but those
minions<00:03:04.910> probably<00:03:05.360> really<00:03:05.750> threw<00:03:05.990> off<00:03:06.170> my

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
minions probably really threw off my

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.630 
minions probably really threw off my
defenses<00:03:07.940> and<00:03:08.570> they<00:03:08.690> did<00:03:08.959> and<00:03:09.310> so<00:03:10.310> keep

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
defenses and they did and so keep

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.750 
defenses and they did and so keep
definitely<00:03:11.090> God<00:03:11.209> is<00:03:11.440> 61%<00:03:12.440> but<00:03:13.250> that's<00:03:13.370> ok<00:03:13.700> I

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
definitely God is 61% but that's ok I

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:21.870 
definitely God is 61% but that's ok I
Alyssa<00:03:16.760> Morgan<00:03:17.690> Alyssa<00:03:18.200> Morgan<00:03:18.650> got<00:03:20.050> 95

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
his or her 39 barbarians and 21 archers

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:27.180 
his or her 39 barbarians and 21 archers
so<00:04:23.350> it<00:04:23.740> is<00:04:24.070> working<00:04:24.460> it<00:04:25.449> gets<00:04:25.690> a<00:04:25.780> little<00:04:26.190> weak

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
so it is working it gets a little weak

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.490 
so it is working it gets a little weak
when<00:04:27.220> there's<00:04:27.820> at<00:04:28.150> least<00:04:28.210> a<00:04:28.750> ton<00:04:29.050> of<00:04:29.080> troops

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
when there's at least a ton of troops

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.620 
when there's at least a ton of troops
which<00:04:29.919> I'm<00:04:30.100> not<00:04:30.220> really<00:04:30.430> prepared<00:04:30.639> for<00:04:31.090> these

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
which I'm not really prepared for these

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.400 
which I'm not really prepared for these
defenses<00:04:32.440> aren't<00:04:32.889> prepared<00:04:33.250> for<00:04:33.340> it<00:04:33.729> but<00:04:34.539> I

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
defenses aren't prepared for it but I

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.659 
defenses aren't prepared for it but I
think<00:04:35.970> overall<00:04:36.970> it's<00:04:37.509> been<00:04:37.660> a<00:04:37.889> good<00:04:38.889> base<00:04:39.130> so

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:39.669 
think overall it's been a good base so

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:42.029 
think overall it's been a good base so
let's<00:04:40.449> start<00:04:40.840> going<00:04:41.169> on<00:04:41.289> let's<00:04:41.680> make<00:04:41.889> our

00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:42.039 
let's start going on let's make our

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:52.850 
let's start going on let's make our
