Iowa today's demonstration is between
the<00:00:06.569> older<00:00:06.990> more<00:00:07.259> traditional<00:00:07.319> method<00:00:08.099> of

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
the older more traditional method of

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.280 
the older more traditional method of
insulating<00:00:08.610> RVs<00:00:08.910> utilizing<00:00:09.630> the<00:00:09.719> fiberglass

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
insulating RVs utilizing the fiberglass

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.650 
insulating RVs utilizing the fiberglass
insulation<00:00:10.730> versus<00:00:11.730> the<00:00:11.880> much<00:00:12.120> preferred

as<00:00:17.160> used<00:00:17.400> as<00:00:17.670> you<00:00:17.820> can<00:00:17.970> see<00:00:18.180> here<00:00:18.600> on<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:19.380> wall

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
as used as you can see here on the wall

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.500 
as used as you can see here on the wall
structures<00:00:20.100> of<00:00:20.250> a<00:00:20.310> surveyor<00:00:20.670> travel<00:00:21.150> trailer

now<00:00:21.960> back<00:00:22.170> over<00:00:22.350> to<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.619> fiberglass

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
now back over to the fiberglass

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.040 
now back over to the fiberglass
insulation<00:00:23.400> where<00:00:23.789> you<00:00:23.880> can<00:00:24.060> see<00:00:24.269> that<00:00:24.869> the

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
insulation where you can see that the

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.410 
insulation where you can see that the
fiberglass<00:00:25.380> after<00:00:25.949> a<00:00:26.189> little<00:00:26.789> bit<00:00:26.880> of<00:00:26.970> usage

fiberglass after a little bit of usage

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.670 
fiberglass after a little bit of usage
and<00:00:27.599> bouncing<00:00:27.960> around<00:00:28.050> it<00:00:28.289> will<00:00:28.380> form<00:00:28.619> some

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
and bouncing around it will form some

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.279 
and bouncing around it will form some
gaps<00:00:29.220> areas<00:00:30.179> where<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.510> insulation<00:00:31.019> is<00:00:31.109> not

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
gaps areas where the insulation is not

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.709 
gaps areas where the insulation is not
doing<00:00:31.619> its<00:00:31.769> job<00:00:32.009> it<00:00:32.520> can<00:00:32.730> absorb<00:00:32.910> water<00:00:33.450> and

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
doing its job it can absorb water and

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.360 
doing its job it can absorb water and
moisture<00:00:33.989> it<00:00:34.380> shrinks<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:34.829> compresses

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
moisture it shrinks and compresses

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.520 
moisture it shrinks and compresses
you're<00:00:35.489> losing<00:00:35.790> your<00:00:35.880> r-value<00:00:36.450> then<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:36.989> as<00:00:37.500> a

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
you're losing your r-value then and as a

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.020 
you're losing your r-value then and as a
result<00:00:37.920> you're<00:00:38.040> gonna<00:00:38.219> wind<00:00:38.460> up<00:00:38.610> with<00:00:38.790> an<00:00:38.879> R

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
result you're gonna wind up with an R

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.290 
result you're gonna wind up with an R
value<00:00:39.059> of<00:00:39.809> approximately<00:00:40.250> r3<00:00:41.250> whereas<00:00:41.879> you<00:00:42.120> do

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
value of approximately r3 whereas you do

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.450 
value of approximately r3 whereas you do
not<00:00:42.420> have<00:00:42.719> that<00:00:42.899> happening<00:00:43.410> with<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:44.010> nature

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
not have that happening with the nature

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.810 
not have that happening with the nature
of<00:00:44.489> a<00:00:44.820> vacuum<00:00:45.629> bonded<00:00:45.809> foam<00:00:46.309> insulation<00:00:47.309> which

of a vacuum bonded foam insulation which
repels<00:00:48.180> water<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.719> adds<00:00:49.110> strength<00:00:49.559> and

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
repels water and adds strength and

repels water and adds strength and
durability<00:00:49.980> does<00:00:50.430> not<00:00:50.579> shrink<00:00:50.760> or<00:00:50.969> compress

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
durability does not shrink or compress

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.010 
durability does not shrink or compress

and retains an r-value of approx r8 now

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.959 
and retains an r-value of approx r8 now
as<00:00:55.410> you<00:00:55.559> can<00:00:55.649> see<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.949> gaps<00:00:56.190> form<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.789> lower

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
as you can see the gaps form the lower

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.020 
as you can see the gaps form the lower
our<00:00:57.270> value<00:00:57.600> for<00:00:57.870> would<00:00:58.289> be<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:59.280> result<00:00:59.670> on<00:00:59.940> the

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
our value for would be a result on the

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.299 
our value for would be a result on the
harbor<00:01:00.300> glass<00:01:00.480> insulation<00:01:01.129> you're<00:01:02.129> gonna

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
harbor glass insulation you're gonna

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.490 
harbor glass insulation you're gonna
also<00:01:02.520> notice<00:01:02.910> it<00:01:03.030> absorb<00:01:03.660> moisture<00:01:03.899> retain

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
also notice it absorb moisture retain

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.080 
also notice it absorb moisture retain
moisture<00:01:04.680> you<00:01:05.129> know<00:01:05.309> what<00:01:05.519> that's<00:01:05.729> going<00:01:06.000> to

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
moisture you know what that's going to

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.840 
moisture you know what that's going to
mean<00:01:06.390> it's<00:01:06.900> gonna<00:01:07.080> mean<00:01:07.350> eventual<00:01:07.979> rot<00:01:08.310> could

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
mean it's gonna mean eventual rot could

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.149 
mean it's gonna mean eventual rot could
mean<00:01:09.060> mold<00:01:09.330> mildew<00:01:09.659> smells<00:01:10.200> you're<00:01:10.740> not<00:01:10.920> going

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
mean mold mildew smells you're not going

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.859 
mean mold mildew smells you're not going
to<00:01:11.250> have<00:01:11.430> that<00:01:11.460> with<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:11.790> surveyor<00:01:12.210> wall<00:01:12.570> where

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
to have that with a surveyor wall where

it's going to be vacuum bonded now this

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.940 
it's going to be vacuum bonded now this
vacuum<00:01:14.909> bonded<00:01:15.360> structure<00:01:15.750> also<00:01:16.049> adds<00:01:16.259> in<00:01:16.590> a
