00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:08.160
 good on this occasion we will work 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:11.190
 the same program that adds two numbers to 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.860
 through two in the text box 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.470
 but this time the result is not going to 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.680
 show in another text box but 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.970
 in the title bar 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.699
 of the window 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.060
 then we proceed from the next 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.060
 shape 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.169
 at 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.169
 method 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:40.250
 perform action 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:44.740
 where the sum is calculated we write the 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.740
 next code and we have it 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.610
 that instruction which means that 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.610
 if the button is pressed 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.489
 so 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:03.130
 the button in this case call it 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:05.770
 I called the button the button that makes me 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:09.870
 the calculation here shows you user add 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:14.840
 but internally I called him 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:18.549
 vtn eternally call it from tns 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.549
 is when you press that button 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.789
 what is done is the following 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:37.049
 the method 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:42.030
 the test as I explained earlier 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:44.630
 capture data from a frame times 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:48.920
 from a faithful test of a little love you 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.920
 these people are what capture 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:58.340
 store it in this variable that in this 

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:58.340
 case the call creates it of type string 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:05.250
 for him 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:07.560
 the other text box in this case 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.489
 change them where to the box 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.890
 text batches as they appear by default 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:17.400
 written corner of people captures the 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:21.150
 data stored here and then here 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:24.480
 creates an entire variable the flame x 1 and 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:27.370
 what is in this variable that is of 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.730
 string type 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.530
 he passes it to me through that 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.850
 instruction 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.190
 construction what makes me 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.600
 convert whole 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.950
 this string value 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:45.380
 the same for 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:48.290
 what was saved or stored 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.160
 in the second text box that is 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.370
 in this variable 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.760
 the whole steps and save it here in x 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.950
 one 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.790
 already here they are converted 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:03.180
 in integer values and in that way creates 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:05.940
 a variable sum that can be added by me 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.500
 I would have placed each one directly and 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.769
 so much here to add up I would not have 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:13.170
 worked because those are values ​​type 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:15.330
 string is what that instruction does 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.980
 then what happens to us values ​​people already 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.530
 explain the previous video 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.370
 in 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:25.700
 and here we do the opposite process 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:30.680
 It turns out that to print 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:34.630
 the value that is a whole value does not 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:38.800
 I can print as a whole value 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:41.470
 this exclusion will leave me here in total 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:44.950
 stream type form 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:46.300
 and so the seventh inclusion what it does 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.090
 Is it going to print me or are we going to see 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:52.150
 results in that title bar 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.860
 window we see in this case already the 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.880
 variable is for this string type 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.880
 because here the shared 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:04.299
 and that's it this way it works 

00:04:01.219 --> 00:04:04.299
 the program add 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:09.520
 otherwise we are going to run it 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.760
 it simply looks like the tall window 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.910
 then the photobooks to show the 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:21.250
 messages emits a value 3 the other value 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:24.639
 3 must add and in the title bar 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:27.389
 we can give the result until the 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:27.389
 next occasion
