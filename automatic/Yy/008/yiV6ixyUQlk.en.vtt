00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:01.410 
alright now we're going to do some

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.420 
alright now we're going to do some
lessons<00:00:01.949> on<00:00:02.389> inverted<00:00:03.389> nose<00:00:03.870> in<00:00:04.279> once<00:00:05.279> you've

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
lessons on inverted nose in once you've

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.460 
lessons on inverted nose in once you've
got<00:00:05.670> your<00:00:05.700> upright<00:00:06.299> hovering<00:00:06.899> down<00:00:07.109> and

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
got your upright hovering down and

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.089 
got your upright hovering down and
you've<00:00:07.649> got<00:00:07.830> that<00:00:09.139> memorized<00:00:10.139> and<00:00:10.469> it's<00:00:10.830> nice

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
you've got that memorized and it's nice

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.220 
you've got that memorized and it's nice
and<00:00:11.309> natural<00:00:11.460> and<00:00:12.030> comfortable<00:00:12.420> for<00:00:12.870> you<00:00:13.019> and

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
and natural and comfortable for you and

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.350 
and natural and comfortable for you and
you<00:00:13.650> can<00:00:13.679> go<00:00:14.009> into<00:00:14.160> forward<00:00:14.549> flight<00:00:14.759> and<00:00:15.089> you

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
you can go into forward flight and you

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.640 
you can go into forward flight and you
think<00:00:15.540> you're<00:00:15.690> ready<00:00:15.780> for<00:00:15.900> some<00:00:16.199> inverted

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
think you're ready for some inverted

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.980 
think you're ready for some inverted
stuff<00:00:16.920> usually<00:00:17.850> a<00:00:18.060> lot<00:00:18.240> of<00:00:18.359> people<00:00:18.480> move<00:00:18.810> on

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
stuff usually a lot of people move on

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.140 
stuff usually a lot of people move on
first<00:00:19.439> to<00:00:19.740> their<00:00:19.890> nose<00:00:20.100> and<00:00:20.310> inverted<00:00:20.760> it

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
first to their nose and inverted it

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.759 
first to their nose and inverted it
really<00:00:21.330> depends<00:00:21.689> if<00:00:21.840> they<00:00:22.020> try<00:00:22.320> to<00:00:22.380> use<00:00:22.590> the

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
really depends if they try to use the

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.910 
really depends if they try to use the
elevator<00:00:23.250> or<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:23.550> aileron<00:00:24.060> to<00:00:25.019> get<00:00:25.529> inverted

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
elevator or the aileron to get inverted

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.920 
elevator or the aileron to get inverted
but<00:00:26.400> usually<00:00:26.580> people<00:00:26.939> will<00:00:27.119> use<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.449> elevator

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
but usually people will use the elevator

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.740 
but usually people will use the elevator
and<00:00:28.170> we'll<00:00:29.010> end<00:00:29.220> up<00:00:29.310> learning<00:00:29.789> nose<00:00:30.179> in<00:00:30.420> before

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
and we'll end up learning nose in before

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.770 
and we'll end up learning nose in before
they<00:00:30.869> learn<00:00:31.019> tail<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:31.560> inverted<00:00:32.070> so<00:00:32.780> the

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
they learn tail and inverted so the

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.959 
they learn tail and inverted so the
thing<00:00:33.989> for<00:00:34.200> inverted<00:00:34.649> instead<00:00:35.550> of<00:00:35.579> giving<00:00:35.760> a

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
thing for inverted instead of giving a

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.310 
thing for inverted instead of giving a
positive<00:00:36.360> pitch<00:00:36.510> once<00:00:36.809> you're<00:00:36.960> upside<00:00:37.170> down

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
positive pitch once you're upside down

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.060 
positive pitch once you're upside down
you're<00:00:37.469> going<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:37.649> want<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:37.829> give<00:00:37.950> it<00:00:38.040> a

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
you're going to want to give it a

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.790 
you're going to want to give it a
negative<00:00:38.190> pitch<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:39.059> push<00:00:39.270> it<00:00:39.420> up<00:00:39.600> so<00:00:40.260> that<00:00:40.290> the

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
negative pitch to push it up so that the

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:41.840 
negative pitch to push it up so that the
pitch<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.160> throttle<00:00:41.489> is<00:00:41.520> going<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:41.790> be

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
pitch the throttle is going to be

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.630 
pitch the throttle is going to be
opposite<00:00:42.450> also<00:00:43.200> when<00:00:43.320> it's<00:00:43.469> upside<00:00:43.590> down<00:00:43.770> the

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
opposite also when it's upside down the

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.760 
opposite also when it's upside down the
rudder<00:00:44.940> is<00:00:45.480> going<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:45.870> be<00:00:45.960> opposite<00:00:46.500> of<00:00:46.590> what

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
rudder is going to be opposite of what

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.580 
rudder is going to be opposite of what
it<00:00:46.860> is<00:00:47.010> when<00:00:47.550> you're<00:00:47.960> straight<00:00:48.960> up<00:00:49.140> usually

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
it is when you're straight up usually

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.729 
it is when you're straight up usually
instead<00:00:50.129> of<00:00:50.600> when<00:00:51.600> you're<00:00:51.719> upright<00:00:51.960> you<00:00:52.620> give

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
instead of when you're upright you give

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:53.930 
instead of when you're upright you give
it<00:00:52.860> less<00:00:53.039> stick<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:53.520> it's<00:00:53.610> going<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:53.820> turn

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
it less stick and it's going to turn

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.850 
it less stick and it's going to turn
counterclockwise<00:00:54.390> well<00:00:55.260> now<00:00:55.440> if<00:00:55.590> you<00:00:55.649> give<00:00:55.770> it

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
counterclockwise well now if you give it

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.130 
counterclockwise well now if you give it
less<00:00:56.039> stick<00:00:56.280> it'll<00:00:56.820> seem<00:00:57.329> like<00:00:57.360> it's<00:00:57.690> turning

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
less stick it'll seem like it's turning

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.619 
less stick it'll seem like it's turning
clockwise<00:00:58.640> same<00:00:59.640> things<00:00:59.879> right<00:01:00.149> stick<00:01:00.449> will

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
clockwise same things right stick will

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.500 
clockwise same things right stick will
make<00:01:00.780> it<00:01:00.899> turn<00:01:01.109> counterclockwise<00:01:02.510> another

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
make it turn counterclockwise another

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.969 
make it turn counterclockwise another
thing<00:01:03.719> that's<00:01:03.899> opposite<00:01:04.470> of<00:01:04.650> what<00:01:04.769> it<00:01:04.860> usually

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
thing that's opposite of what it usually

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.760 
thing that's opposite of what it usually
is<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.519> aileron<00:01:06.000> so<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.810> aileron<00:01:07.229> here<00:01:07.650> if

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
is the aileron so the aileron here if

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.620 
is the aileron so the aileron here if
you<00:01:07.860> give<00:01:07.979> it<00:01:08.100> right<00:01:08.430> stick<00:01:08.939> it<00:01:09.180> will<00:01:09.360> roll<00:01:09.600> to

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
you give it right stick it will roll to

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.929 
you give it right stick it will roll to
the<00:01:09.869> left<00:01:09.990> side<00:01:10.500> if<00:01:10.799> you<00:01:11.130> have<00:01:11.220> a<00:01:11.250> left<00:01:11.610> stick

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
the left side if you have a left stick

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.109 
the left side if you have a left stick
it'll<00:01:12.510> roll<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.020> right<00:01:13.229> side<00:01:13.610> so<00:01:14.610> the

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
it'll roll to the right side so the

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.510 
it'll roll to the right side so the
things<00:01:15.330> that<00:01:15.420> are<00:01:15.570> opposite<00:01:16.110> is<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.890> aileron

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
things that are opposite is the aileron

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.950 
things that are opposite is the aileron
the<00:01:18.240> rudder<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:18.830> the<00:01:19.830> pitch<00:01:20.299> the<00:01:21.299> things<00:01:21.570> that

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
the rudder and the pitch the things that

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.149 
the rudder and the pitch the things that
are<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.140> same<00:01:22.350> or<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.680> thing<00:01:22.860> that<00:01:23.009> is<00:01:23.100> the

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
are the same or the thing that is the

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.789 
are the same or the thing that is the
same<00:01:23.400> is<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.670> elevator<00:01:24.420> so<00:01:25.259> when<00:01:25.530> your<00:01:25.650> nose

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
same is the elevator so when your nose

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.200 
same is the elevator so when your nose
in<00:01:26.689> and<00:01:27.689> your<00:01:28.020> inverted<00:01:28.350> pushing<00:01:29.070> up<00:01:29.520> is<00:01:29.880> still

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
in and your inverted pushing up is still

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.210 
in and your inverted pushing up is still
going<00:01:30.299> to<00:01:30.390> make<00:01:30.450> it<00:01:30.600> go<00:01:30.720> forward<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:31.650> pushing

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
going to make it go forward and pushing

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.890 
going to make it go forward and pushing
down<00:01:32.430> it's<00:01:32.970> still<00:01:33.119> going<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.299> make<00:01:33.420> it<00:01:33.540> go<00:01:33.659> back

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
down it's still going to make it go back

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.929 
down it's still going to make it go back
so<00:01:34.680> let's<00:01:34.860> do<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.070> demonstration<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.790> watch

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
so let's do the demonstration and watch

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.539 
so let's do the demonstration and watch
my<00:01:36.119> sticks<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:36.840> see<00:01:37.439> how<00:01:38.340> we're<00:01:38.520> doing

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
my sticks and and see how we're doing

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.819 
my sticks and and see how we're doing
this<00:01:40.970> let's<00:01:41.970> get<00:01:42.150> up<00:01:42.329> but<00:01:43.020> if<00:01:43.500> you're<00:01:43.649> doing

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
this let's get up but if you're doing

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.170 
this let's get up but if you're doing
this<00:01:43.890> in<00:01:44.040> real<00:01:44.189> life<00:01:44.340> get<00:01:44.490> pretty<00:01:44.790> far<00:01:45.030> away

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
this in real life get pretty far away

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.249 
this in real life get pretty far away
and<00:01:45.570> get<00:01:46.229> really<00:01:46.530> high<00:01:46.890> up<00:01:47.869> because<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:49.049> first

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
and get really high up because the first

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.359 
and get really high up because the first
inverter<00:01:49.560> is<00:01:49.710> going<00:01:49.829> to<00:01:49.890> be<00:01:49.979> pretty<00:01:50.100> bad<00:01:50.310> and

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
inverter is going to be pretty bad and

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.100 
inverter is going to be pretty bad and
definitely<00:01:50.939> i'd<00:01:51.210> say<00:01:51.450> get<00:01:51.630> comfortable<00:01:51.960> with

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
definitely i'd say get comfortable with

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.139 
definitely i'd say get comfortable with
it<00:01:52.320> on<00:01:52.439> a<00:01:52.470> sim<00:01:52.829> long<00:01:53.130> before<00:01:53.549> you<00:01:53.670> try<00:01:53.909> it<00:01:53.970> in

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
it on a sim long before you try it in

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.020 
it on a sim long before you try it in
real<00:01:54.299> life<00:01:55.009> so<00:01:56.009> what<00:01:56.189> you<00:01:56.280> want<00:01:56.430> to<00:01:56.490> do<00:01:56.610> is<00:01:56.790> you

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
real life so what you want to do is you

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.060 
real life so what you want to do is you
know<00:01:57.450> in<00:01:57.570> order<00:01:57.689> to<00:01:57.899> do<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.590> Flip<00:01:58.860> you're

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
know in order to do the Flip you're

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.620 
know in order to do the Flip you're
gonna<00:01:59.159> pull<00:01:59.399> back<00:01:59.640> on<00:01:59.909> the<00:01:59.939> elevator<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:00.420> just

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
gonna pull back on the elevator and just

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.200 
gonna pull back on the elevator and just
keep<00:02:00.780> going<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.290> once<00:02:01.860> your<00:02:02.009> inverted<00:02:02.340> go<00:02:02.670> the

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
keep going and once your inverted go the

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.929 
keep going and once your inverted go the
opposite<00:02:03.810> under<00:02:04.079> pitch<00:02:04.320> see<00:02:04.979> so<00:02:05.219> now<00:02:05.369> up<00:02:05.610> is

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
opposite under pitch see so now up is

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.930 
opposite under pitch see so now up is
down<00:02:05.969> and<00:02:06.479> down<00:02:06.570> is<00:02:07.229> up<00:02:07.409> or<00:02:08.160> they<00:02:08.610> could<00:02:08.640> say

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
down and down is up or they could say

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.100 
down and down is up or they could say
down<00:02:09.690> is<00:02:09.869> up<00:02:10.140> and<00:02:10.379> up<00:02:10.709> is<00:02:11.099> expensive

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
down is up and up is expensive

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.080 
down is up and up is expensive
so<00:02:14.110> now<00:02:14.260> that<00:02:14.409> you<00:02:14.530> want<00:02:15.069> to<00:02:15.159> get<00:02:15.459> the<00:02:15.580> nose<00:02:15.730> and

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
so now that you want to get the nose and

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.000 
so now that you want to get the nose and
I'll<00:02:16.690> bring<00:02:17.049> it<00:02:17.200> in<00:02:17.290> a<00:02:17.349> little<00:02:17.379> bit<00:02:17.709> closer

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
I'll bring it in a little bit closer

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.390 
I'll bring it in a little bit closer
here<00:02:18.450> so<00:02:19.450> just<00:02:19.480> like<00:02:19.810> I<00:02:19.930> said<00:02:20.400> elevator

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
here so just like I said elevator

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.119 
here so just like I said elevator
forward<00:02:22.180> it<00:02:22.299> still<00:02:22.480> makes<00:02:22.629> go<00:02:22.780> forward<00:02:23.170> back

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:24.129 
forward it still makes go forward back

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:27.300 
forward it still makes go forward back
still<00:02:24.519> makes<00:02:24.730> it<00:02:24.849> go<00:02:24.970> back<00:02:25.209> towards<00:02:25.599> you<00:02:26.310> the

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
still makes it go back towards you the

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.729 
still makes it go back towards you the
ailerons<00:02:27.790> stuff<00:02:28.150> is<00:02:28.360> completely<00:02:29.019> opposite

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
ailerons stuff is completely opposite

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:32.750 
ailerons stuff is completely opposite
right<00:02:30.519> is<00:02:30.700> going<00:02:30.849> to<00:02:30.909> make<00:02:31.000> it<00:02:31.030> roll<00:02:31.239> left<00:02:31.500> and

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
right is going to make it roll left and

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.339 
right is going to make it roll left and
then<00:02:33.760> left<00:02:36.690> it's<00:02:37.690> going<00:02:37.810> to<00:02:37.870> make<00:02:37.989> it<00:02:38.140> roll

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:38.349 
then left it's going to make it roll

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:45.500 
then left it's going to make it roll
right<00:02:38.560> see

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.429 

then<00:02:45.720> there's<00:02:46.319> also<00:02:46.530> the<00:02:47.340> rudder<00:02:48.230> see<00:02:49.230> how

00:02:49.429 --> 00:02:49.439 
then there's also the rudder see how

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:51.199 
then there's also the rudder see how
giving<00:02:49.860> it<00:02:50.010> left<00:02:50.459> rudder<00:02:50.670> makes<00:02:51.000> it<00:02:51.090> turn

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
giving it left rudder makes it turn

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:56.660 
giving it left rudder makes it turn
clockwise<00:02:54.620> also<00:02:55.620> right<00:02:55.860> rudder<00:02:56.099> next<00:02:56.519> turn

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
clockwise also right rudder next turn

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.640 
clockwise also right rudder next turn
counterclockwise<00:02:56.970> so<00:02:57.959> that's<00:02:58.110> the<00:02:58.260> opposite

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
counterclockwise so that's the opposite

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.229 
counterclockwise so that's the opposite
of<00:02:58.739> what<00:02:58.920> you're<00:02:59.010> used<00:02:59.220> to<00:02:59.340> so<00:03:00.000> it's<00:03:00.150> a<00:03:00.209> little

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
of what you're used to so it's a little

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.420 
of what you're used to so it's a little
tricky<00:03:00.720> all<00:03:01.049> this<00:03:01.349> is<00:03:01.409> really<00:03:01.799> the<00:03:02.010> opposite

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
tricky all this is really the opposite

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:03.710 
tricky all this is really the opposite
of<00:03:02.549> what<00:03:02.700> you're<00:03:02.790> used<00:03:02.970> to<00:03:03.120> i<00:03:03.150> recommend

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
of what you're used to i recommend

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.569 
of what you're used to i recommend
getting<00:03:04.319> really<00:03:04.709> good<00:03:04.829> at<00:03:04.860> this<00:03:04.980> on<00:03:05.250> the<00:03:05.340> sim

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:05.579 
getting really good at this on the sim

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:06.740 
getting really good at this on the sim
because<00:03:05.909> trying<00:03:06.120> to<00:03:06.180> learn<00:03:06.269> this<00:03:06.450> in<00:03:06.599> real

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
because trying to learn this in real

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.210 
because trying to learn this in real
life<00:03:06.959> and<00:03:07.079> get<00:03:07.200> good<00:03:07.319> at<00:03:07.470> it<00:03:07.500> becomes<00:03:08.069> a<00:03:08.159> little

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
life and get good at it becomes a little

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.970 
life and get good at it becomes a little
tricky<00:03:08.670> we<00:03:09.239> will<00:03:09.450> try<00:03:09.989> to<00:03:10.049> do<00:03:10.200> to<00:03:10.379> tick<00:03:10.680> tocks

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
tricky we will try to do to tick tocks

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.849 
tricky we will try to do to tick tocks
and<00:03:11.220> stuff<00:03:11.430> and<00:03:11.870> you<00:03:12.870> know<00:03:12.900> usually<00:03:13.260> just<00:03:13.560> ends

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:13.859 
and stuff and you know usually just ends

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:16.460 
and stuff and you know usually just ends
in<00:03:13.980> disaster<00:03:14.790> at<00:03:15.239> least<00:03:15.450> it<00:03:15.569> did<00:03:15.750> for<00:03:15.780> me<00:03:15.989> i<00:03:16.109> was

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
in disaster at least it did for me i was

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:17.990 
in disaster at least it did for me i was
i<00:03:16.650> got<00:03:16.680> ahead<00:03:17.010> of<00:03:17.069> myself<00:03:17.159> and<00:03:17.640> i<00:03:17.700> was<00:03:17.790> trying

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
i got ahead of myself and i was trying

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.430 
i got ahead of myself and i was trying
to<00:03:18.030> do<00:03:18.180> this<00:03:18.329> but<00:03:18.870> you<00:03:18.900> want<00:03:19.049> to<00:03:19.109> get<00:03:19.230> to<00:03:19.319> where

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
to do this but you want to get to where

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.680 
to do this but you want to get to where
you<00:03:19.560> can<00:03:19.709> get<00:03:20.099> a<00:03:20.159> nice<00:03:20.340> level<00:03:20.730> nose<00:03:21.209> and<00:03:21.480> hover

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
you can get a nice level nose and hover

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.379 
you can get a nice level nose and hover
right<00:03:22.349> in<00:03:22.470> front<00:03:22.650> of<00:03:22.739> you<00:03:22.890> small<00:03:23.609> inputs<00:03:24.090> just
