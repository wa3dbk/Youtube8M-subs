inline citations this is good stuff for

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.859 
inline citations this is good stuff for
you<00:00:20.279> to<00:00:20.400> know<00:00:20.520> so<00:00:21.359> first<00:00:21.570> we're<00:00:21.720> going<00:00:21.810> to

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
you to know so first we're going to

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.050 
you to know so first we're going to
start<00:00:22.050> off<00:00:22.230> with<00:00:22.710> your<00:00:23.189> more<00:00:23.400> in-depth<00:00:23.789> paper

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
start off with your more in-depth paper

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.089 
start off with your more in-depth paper
which<00:00:24.330> will<00:00:24.449> require<00:00:24.660> footnotes<00:00:25.260> footnotes

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
which will require footnotes footnotes

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.279 
which will require footnotes footnotes
are<00:00:26.279> usually<00:00:26.580> used<00:00:26.880> if<00:00:27.090> you<00:00:27.240> have<00:00:27.269> a<00:00:27.960> paper

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
are usually used if you have a paper

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.299 
are usually used if you have a paper
that<00:00:28.590> has<00:00:28.830> lots<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.699> lots<00:00:29.910> of<00:00:30.090> research<00:00:30.480> in<00:00:30.689> it

00:00:31.299 --> 00:00:31.309 
that has lots and lots of research in it

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:33.940 
that has lots and lots of research in it
so<00:00:32.309> therefore<00:00:32.520> you<00:00:32.880> you<00:00:33.059> sort<00:00:33.300> of<00:00:33.390> have<00:00:33.540> to

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:33.950 
so therefore you you sort of have to

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.400 
so therefore you you sort of have to
make<00:00:34.950> special<00:00:35.520> a<00:00:35.730> special<00:00:36.149> place<00:00:36.480> for<00:00:37.260> your

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
make special a special place for your

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.510 
make special a special place for your
notes<00:00:37.850> and<00:00:38.850> more<00:00:39.180> in-depth<00:00:39.719> notes<00:00:40.129> on<00:00:41.129> these

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
notes and more in-depth notes on these

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.850 
notes and more in-depth notes on these
citations<00:00:42.180> so<00:00:43.110> footnotes<00:00:43.500> are<00:00:43.649> actually

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
citations so footnotes are actually

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.830 
citations so footnotes are actually
going<00:00:43.980> to<00:00:44.040> have<00:00:44.219> little<00:00:44.850> numbers<00:00:45.210> out<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:45.719> the

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
going to have little numbers out to the

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.990 
going to have little numbers out to the
side<00:00:46.050> that<00:00:46.260> will<00:00:46.379> connect<00:00:46.770> with<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.430> EndNote

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
essay where all the numbers will be

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.959 
essay where all the numbers will be
listed<00:02:01.200> out<00:02:01.320> with<00:02:01.590> citations<00:02:02.159> so<00:02:02.579> endnotes

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
listed out with citations so endnotes

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.600 
listed out with citations so endnotes
are<00:02:03.119> something<00:02:03.360> even<00:02:03.570> bigger<00:02:04.610> inline

publishing information and stuff like

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.750 
publishing information and stuff like
that<00:02:34.290> it's<00:02:34.860> because<00:02:35.130> you'll<00:02:35.310> have<00:02:35.430> a<00:02:35.490> work

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
that it's because you'll have a work

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.480 
that it's because you'll have a work
cited<00:02:36.120> page<00:02:36.270> at<00:02:36.660> the<00:02:36.750> end<00:02:36.930> of<00:02:37.110> your<00:02:37.230> paper<00:02:37.490> so

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
cited page at the end of your paper so

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.580 
cited page at the end of your paper so
therefore<00:02:39.120> there's<00:02:39.450> no<00:02:39.540> there's<00:02:40.020> no<00:02:40.080> footnote

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
therefore there's no there's no footnote

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.680 
therefore there's no there's no footnote
to<00:02:41.130> connect<00:02:41.490> that<00:02:41.580> information<00:02:42.150> on<00:02:42.330> the<00:02:42.510> paper

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
to connect that information on the paper

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.380 
to connect that information on the paper
but<00:02:43.020> there<00:02:43.140> will<00:02:43.200> be<00:02:43.260> something<00:02:43.530> at<00:02:43.800> the<00:02:43.950> end

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
but there will be something at the end

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.120 
but there will be something at the end
so<00:02:45.390> hopefully<00:02:46.290> this<00:02:46.410> will<00:02:46.470> get<00:02:46.620> you<00:02:46.709> started

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130
