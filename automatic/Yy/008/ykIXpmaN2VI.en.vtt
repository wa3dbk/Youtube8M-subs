00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
reason or another i had never heard of

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.429 
reason or another i had never heard of
it<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.100> i<00:01:14.729> think<00:01:14.939> it's<00:01:15.180> really<00:01:15.600> effective<00:01:16.020> so

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
it and i think it's really effective so

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.230 
it and i think it's really effective so
here's<00:01:16.979> how<00:01:17.100> it<00:01:17.189> works<00:01:17.310> usually<00:01:18.060> when<00:01:18.210> a

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
here's how it works usually when a

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.030 
here's how it works usually when a
player<00:01:18.509> is<00:01:18.540> attacking<00:01:19.170> through<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.470> triangle

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
player is attacking through the triangle

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.710 
player is attacking through the triangle
which<00:01:20.460> is<00:01:20.700> this<00:01:20.880> little<00:01:21.060> area<00:01:21.299> between<00:01:21.540> the

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
which is this little area between the

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.170 
which is this little area between the
players<00:01:22.020> stick<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.500> skates<00:01:23.090> generally<00:01:24.090> what

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
players stick and skates generally what

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.520 
players stick and skates generally what
they<00:01:24.299> tend<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.570> do<00:01:24.689> is<00:01:24.720> they<00:01:24.900> throw<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.350> puck

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
they tend to do is they throw the puck

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.380 
they tend to do is they throw the puck
through<00:01:25.560> then<00:01:26.189> they<00:01:26.369> lift<00:01:26.640> up<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.030> come<00:01:27.180> over

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
through then they lift up and come over

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.569 
through then they lift up and come over
that<00:01:27.810> player<00:01:28.080> stick<00:01:28.530> so<00:01:29.009> they<00:01:29.070> throw<00:01:29.310> through

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
that player stick so they throw through

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.819 
that player stick so they throw through
lift<00:01:30.060> up<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.450> come<00:01:30.570> over<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.049> what<00:01:31.439> that<00:01:31.590> does

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
lift up and come over and what that does

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.620 
lift up and come over and what that does
is<00:01:32.040> it<00:01:32.159> gives<00:01:32.579> you<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.700> bigger<00:01:32.909> risk<00:01:33.150> of<00:01:33.390> losing

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
is it gives you a bigger risk of losing

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.109 
is it gives you a bigger risk of losing
the<00:01:33.810> puck<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.229> it<00:01:34.650> also<00:01:34.799> raises<00:01:35.610> your<00:01:35.850> center

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
the puck and it also raises your center

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.090 
the puck and it also raises your center
of<00:01:36.150> gravity<00:01:36.240> so<00:01:36.720> it<00:01:36.810> slows<00:01:37.079> you<00:01:37.259> down<00:01:37.290> what

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
of gravity so it slows you down what

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.550 
of gravity so it slows you down what
feathering<00:01:38.549> does<00:01:38.759> is<00:01:39.000> instead<00:01:39.930> of<00:01:40.049> coming<00:01:40.380> up

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
feathering does is instead of coming up

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.980 
feathering does is instead of coming up
and<00:01:40.829> over<00:01:41.130> is<00:01:41.280> what<00:01:41.880> you<00:01:42.030> do<00:01:42.299> is<00:01:42.509> you're<00:01:42.899> going

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
and over is what you do is you're going

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.889 
and over is what you do is you're going
to<00:01:43.079> pull<00:01:43.409> your<00:01:43.439> stick<00:01:44.369> up<00:01:44.579> so<00:01:45.210> a<00:01:45.240> loose<00:01:45.479> grip<00:01:45.750> on

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
to pull your stick up so a loose grip on

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.330 
to pull your stick up so a loose grip on
your<00:01:46.020> bottom<00:01:46.229> hand<00:01:46.380> pull<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.829> stick<00:01:47.040> up<00:01:47.189> and

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
your bottom hand pull the stick up and

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.460 
your bottom hand pull the stick up and
around<00:01:47.670> Oh<00:01:48.060> case<00:01:48.479> you're<00:01:48.720> pulling<00:01:48.990> it<00:01:49.079> in<00:01:49.290> and

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
around Oh case you're pulling it in and

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.319 
around Oh case you're pulling it in and
around<00:01:49.740> that<00:01:50.009> allows<00:01:50.579> you<00:01:50.790> to<00:01:50.820> keep<00:01:51.030> that<00:01:51.180> low

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
around that allows you to keep that low

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.700 
around that allows you to keep that low
center<00:01:51.600> of<00:01:51.630> gravity<00:01:51.720> so<00:01:52.140> you<00:01:52.229> can<00:01:52.380> make<00:01:52.560> your

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
center of gravity so you can make your

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.069 
center of gravity so you can make your
move<00:01:52.920> then<00:01:53.880> explode<00:01:54.390> through<00:01:54.720> to<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.049> other

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
move then explode through to the other

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.950 
move then explode through to the other
side<00:01:55.460> keeping<00:01:56.460> your<00:01:56.579> momentum<00:01:56.939> going<00:01:57.149> so<00:01:57.840> it's

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
side keeping your momentum going so it's

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.840 
side keeping your momentum going so it's
a<00:01:58.049> much<00:01:58.409> more<00:01:58.590> effective<00:01:58.770> way<00:01:59.159> of<00:01:59.340> attacking

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
a much more effective way of attacking

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.870 
a much more effective way of attacking
through<00:02:00.210> that<00:02:00.299> triangle<00:02:00.600> you<00:02:01.200> can<00:02:01.350> see<00:02:01.880> to

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
through that triangle you can see to

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.179 
through that triangle you can see to
pull<00:02:03.090> through<00:02:03.320> my<00:02:04.320> center<00:02:04.590> of<00:02:04.649> gravity<00:02:04.710> stays

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
pull through my center of gravity stays

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:06.570 
pull through my center of gravity stays
nice<00:02:05.430> and<00:02:05.460> low<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:05.909> entire<00:02:06.180> two

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
nice and low the entire two

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.540 
nice and low the entire two
so<00:02:07.580> that's<00:02:07.730> feather<00:02:08.890> and<00:02:09.890> here<00:02:10.250> we<00:02:10.340> have<00:02:10.429> the

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
so that's feather and here we have the

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:11.950 
so that's feather and here we have the
actual<00:02:10.670> sweet<00:02:11.030> hand<00:02:11.210> set<00:02:11.450> up<00:02:11.540> you<00:02:11.630> can<00:02:11.750> see<00:02:11.870> I'm

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
actual sweet hand set up you can see I'm

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.690 
actual sweet hand set up you can see I'm
using<00:02:11.990> it<00:02:12.350> in<00:02:12.470> the<00:02:12.590> forefoot<00:02:13.100> version<00:02:13.520> here

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
using it in the forefoot version here

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.270 
using it in the forefoot version here
and<00:02:14.210> just<00:02:14.510> doing<00:02:14.690> some<00:02:14.840> wide<00:02:15.140> fast<00:02:15.650> slalom

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
and just doing some wide fast slalom

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.020 
and just doing some wide fast slalom
there<00:02:17.350> and<00:02:18.350> on<00:02:19.130> this<00:02:19.220> one<00:02:19.370> we're<00:02:19.580> doing<00:02:19.910> a

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
there and on this one we're doing a

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.520 
there and on this one we're doing a
little<00:02:20.180> bit<00:02:20.300> of<00:02:20.330> a<00:02:20.420> toe<00:02:20.600> drag<00:02:20.900> through<00:02:21.260> each

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
little bit of a toe drag through each

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:33.100 
little bit of a toe drag through each
one<00:02:21.560> of<00:02:21.770> the<00:02:21.830> gaps<00:02:31.510> this<00:02:32.510> one<00:02:32.690> I<00:02:32.720> kind<00:02:32.930> of<00:02:32.959> got<00:02:33.080> a

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
one of the gaps this one I kind of got a

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:34.810 
one of the gaps this one I kind of got a
little<00:02:33.230> bit<00:02:33.500> creative<00:02:33.680> just<00:02:34.040> started<00:02:34.640> making

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
little bit creative just started making

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.910 
little bit creative just started making
stuff<00:02:35.030> 5<00:02:35.240> I<00:02:35.420> put<00:02:35.600> 22<00:02:35.930> foot<00:02:36.410> sections<00:02:36.800> together

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
stuff 5 I put 22 foot sections together

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.830 
stuff 5 I put 22 foot sections together
and<00:02:37.700> you<00:02:37.820> can<00:02:37.940> see<00:02:38.060> a<00:02:38.090> stick<00:02:38.300> handle<00:02:38.570> on<00:02:38.660> one

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
and you can see a stick handle on one

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.240 
and you can see a stick handle on one
side<00:02:39.050> and<00:02:39.080> stick<00:02:39.440> handle<00:02:39.680> on<00:02:39.770> the<00:02:39.830> other<00:02:39.980> side

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
side and stick handle on the other side

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.280 
side and stick handle on the other side
and<00:02:40.520> you<00:02:41.510> can<00:02:41.600> kind<00:02:41.720> of<00:02:41.810> get<00:02:41.930> creative<00:02:42.230> with

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
and you can kind of get creative with

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.050 
and you can kind of get creative with
this<00:02:42.410> even<00:02:43.100> start<00:02:43.310> pulling<00:02:43.550> toe<00:02:43.850> dragged

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
this even start pulling toe dragged

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:49.510 
this even start pulling toe dragged
through<00:02:44.270> the<00:02:44.330> different<00:02:44.600> gaps<00:02:48.040> and<00:02:49.040> pull<00:02:49.280> over

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 
through the different gaps and pull over

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.210 
through the different gaps and pull over
the<00:02:49.640> backhand<00:02:50.060> side<00:02:50.830> start<00:02:51.830> to<00:02:51.890> see<00:02:51.980> cowering

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
the backhand side start to see cowering

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:58.330 
the backhand side start to see cowering
through<00:02:52.400> the<00:02:52.489> gaps<00:02:52.670> on<00:02:52.820> that<00:02:52.970> side<00:02:56.860> this<00:02:57.860> is<00:02:58.070> by

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
through the gaps on that side this is by

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.430 
through the gaps on that side this is by
the<00:02:58.370> way<00:02:58.489> really<00:02:58.820> good<00:02:59.030> for<00:02:59.390> your<00:02:59.630> wrist<00:03:00.230> and

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
the way really good for your wrist and

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.050 
the way really good for your wrist and
forearm<00:03:00.590> strength<00:03:00.950> do<00:03:01.640> this<00:03:01.790> for<00:03:01.940> a<00:03:01.970> couple

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
forearm strength do this for a couple

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.120 
forearm strength do this for a couple
