power frame quarry type design because

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.590 
power frame quarry type design because
apparently<00:00:45.829> that<00:00:46.100> adds<00:00:46.429> a<00:00:46.789> way<00:00:47.030> to<00:00:47.089> actually

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
apparently that adds a way to actually

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.389 
apparently that adds a way to actually
move<00:00:47.809> multiple<00:00:48.109> blocks<00:00:48.589> and<00:00:48.890> so<00:00:49.039> it<00:00:49.100> creates

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:49.399 
move multiple blocks and so it creates

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:51.459 
move multiple blocks and so it creates
kind<00:00:49.550> of<00:00:49.640> like<00:00:49.789> a<00:00:49.820> frame<00:00:50.120> quarry<00:00:50.390> design<00:00:50.749> which

00:00:51.459 --> 00:00:51.469 
kind of like a frame quarry design which

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:53.950 
kind of like a frame quarry design which
is<00:00:51.589> extremely<00:00:52.010> cool<00:00:52.159> but<00:00:53.120> he<00:00:53.300> said<00:00:53.570> the<00:00:53.719> design

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
is extremely cool but he said the design

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.419 
is extremely cool but he said the design
was<00:00:54.199> kind<00:00:54.379> of<00:00:54.409> inefficient<00:00:55.070> he<00:00:55.159> showed<00:00:55.399> a

00:00:55.419 --> 00:00:55.429 
was kind of inefficient he showed a

00:00:55.429 --> 00:00:57.369 
was kind of inefficient he showed a
design<00:00:55.819> and<00:00:56.120> it<00:00:56.390> looked<00:00:56.569> awesome<00:00:56.780> but<00:00:57.140> it<00:00:57.230> also

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
design and it looked awesome but it also

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:00.520 
design and it looked awesome but it also
looked<00:00:57.710> highly<00:00:58.269> overcomplicated<00:00:59.269> so<00:01:00.260> I

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
looked highly overcomplicated so I

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.799 
looked highly overcomplicated so I
thought<00:01:00.949> back<00:01:01.159> a<00:01:01.429> while<00:01:01.819> ago<00:01:02.149> hmm

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
thought back a while ago hmm

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:05.020 
thought back a while ago hmm
excuse<00:01:03.559> me<00:01:03.710> dire<00:01:03.920> wolf<00:01:04.159> 20<00:01:04.460> released<00:01:04.760> a<00:01:04.909> video

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
excuse me dire wolf 20 released a video

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.710 
excuse me dire wolf 20 released a video
and<00:01:05.650> in<00:01:06.650> his<00:01:06.920> video<00:01:07.250> it<00:01:07.550> was<00:01:07.790> using<00:01:08.300> turtles

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
and in his video it was using turtles

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.300 
and in his video it was using turtles
and<00:01:08.930> mining<00:01:09.560> wells<00:01:10.330> to<00:01:11.330> create<00:01:11.840> a<00:01:12.310> fishing

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
and mining wells to create a fishing

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.219 
and mining wells to create a fishing
design<00:01:13.640> and<00:01:14.060> I<00:01:14.330> decided<00:01:14.659> I'd<00:01:14.840> go<00:01:14.990> ahead<00:01:15.079> and

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
design and I decided I'd go ahead and

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:18.340 
design and I decided I'd go ahead and
attempt<00:01:16.159> to<00:01:16.369> combine<00:01:16.640> the<00:01:16.969> two<00:01:17.149> so<00:01:17.719> in<00:01:18.079> here<00:01:18.290> I

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
attempt to combine the two so in here I

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.030 
attempt to combine the two so in here I
have<00:01:18.680> a<00:01:19.180> three<00:01:20.180> turtles<00:01:20.990> all<00:01:21.229> mining<00:01:21.710> turtles

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
have a three turtles all mining turtles

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.889 
have a three turtles all mining turtles
and<00:01:22.159> their<00:01:22.490> slaves<00:01:22.850> and<00:01:23.240> they<00:01:23.509> all<00:01:23.630> run<00:01:23.810> the

00:01:23.889 --> 00:01:23.899 
and their slaves and they all run the

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:26.590 
and their slaves and they all run the
program<00:01:24.259> listen<00:01:24.820> then<00:01:25.820> I<00:01:25.850> have<00:01:26.119> this<00:01:26.299> main

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
program listen then I have this main

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.450 
program listen then I have this main
turtle<00:01:26.930> right<00:01:27.049> here<00:01:27.320> which<00:01:27.890> has<00:01:27.950> the<00:01:28.100> energy

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
turtle right here which has the energy

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.550 
turtle right here which has the energy
tesseract<00:01:29.180> in<00:01:29.479> conjunction<00:01:30.259> with<00:01:30.409> the

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
tesseract in conjunction with the

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.980 
tesseract in conjunction with the
redstone<00:01:30.920> energy<00:01:31.310> conduit<00:01:31.700> and<00:01:32.030> it<00:01:32.450> runs<00:01:32.750> the

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
redstone energy conduit and it runs the

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.050 
redstone energy conduit and it runs the
main<00:01:33.170> program<00:01:33.619> itself<00:01:33.979> now<00:01:34.340> each<00:01:34.520> turtle<00:01:34.789> has

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
main program itself now each turtle has

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.179 
main program itself now each turtle has
an<00:01:35.210> inner<00:01:35.360> chest<00:01:35.630> as<00:01:35.840> well<00:01:36.110> so<00:01:36.649> that<00:01:36.799> they<00:01:36.979> can

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:37.189 
an inner chest as well so that they can

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:40.719 
an inner chest as well so that they can
refuel<00:01:37.729> themselves<00:01:38.710> so<00:01:39.710> anyway<00:01:40.009> that's<00:01:40.369> what

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
refuel themselves so anyway that's what

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:42.969 
refuel themselves so anyway that's what
that<00:01:40.880> does<00:01:41.090> now<00:01:41.299> in<00:01:41.570> here<00:01:42.439> we<00:01:42.680> have<00:01:42.829> the

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
that does now in here we have the

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:44.529 
that does now in here we have the
drawbridge<00:01:43.369> and<00:01:43.729> then<00:01:43.880> we'll<00:01:44.030> have<00:01:44.210> either

00:01:44.529 --> 00:01:44.539 
drawbridge and then we'll have either

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:48.719 
drawbridge and then we'll have either
red<00:01:44.869> stored<00:01:45.079> energy<00:01:45.200> cell<00:01:45.740> a<00:01:45.950> conduit<00:01:46.909> a

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:52.789 
mining well or in their chests and I

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:55.029 
mining well or in their chests and I
have<00:01:53.060> 17<00:01:53.539> in<00:01:53.719> here<00:01:53.929> but<00:01:54.590> if<00:01:54.770> you<00:01:54.920> actually

00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:55.039 
have 17 in here but if you actually

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:56.709 
have 17 in here but if you actually
subtract<00:01:55.520> one<00:01:55.729> from<00:01:55.759> this<00:01:56.030> number<00:01:56.270> it's<00:01:56.570> going

00:01:56.709 --> 00:01:56.719 
subtract one from this number it's going

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:59.050 
subtract one from this number it's going
to<00:01:56.780> be<00:01:56.869> how<00:01:56.990> many<00:01:57.170> it's<00:01:57.289> going<00:01:57.409> to<00:01:57.530> deploy<00:01:58.060> so

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
to be how many it's going to deploy so

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.020 
to be how many it's going to deploy so
couldn't<00:01:59.270> do<00:01:59.450> 16<00:01:59.990> excuse<00:02:00.920> me<00:02:01.100> again<00:02:01.280> so<00:02:01.880> with

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
couldn't do 16 excuse me again so with

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.160 
couldn't do 16 excuse me again so with
only<00:02:02.179> four<00:02:02.630> Turtles

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
only four Turtles

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:04.539 
only four Turtles
I'm<00:02:03.289> actually<00:02:03.560> going<00:02:03.890> to<00:02:04.070> be<00:02:04.219> deploying

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549 
I'm actually going to be deploying

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:07.239 
I'm actually going to be deploying
sixteen<00:02:05.119> mining<00:02:05.509> wells<00:02:05.719> um<00:02:06.130> so<00:02:07.130> basically

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:07.249 
sixteen mining wells um so basically

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:10.359 
sixteen mining wells um so basically
going<00:02:07.820> to<00:02:07.939> be<00:02:08.119> mining<00:02:08.570> a<00:02:08.750> chunk<00:02:09.590> at<00:02:09.740> a<00:02:09.800> time<00:02:09.890> and

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
going to be mining a chunk at a time and

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.580 
going to be mining a chunk at a time and
I<00:02:11.240> haven't<00:02:11.510> finished<00:02:11.930> this<00:02:12.020> program<00:02:12.410> as<00:02:12.530> you

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
I haven't finished this program as you

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.110 
I haven't finished this program as you
can<00:02:12.740> see<00:02:12.860> there's<00:02:13.010> no<00:02:13.130> chunk<00:02:13.400> loaders<00:02:13.790> so

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
can see there's no chunk loaders so

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.050 
can see there's no chunk loaders so
you'd<00:02:14.360> have<00:02:14.450> to<00:02:14.600> watch<00:02:14.900> this<00:02:15.170> turtle<00:02:16.070> run<00:02:16.310> and

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
you'd have to watch this turtle run and

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.430 
you'd have to watch this turtle run and
whatnot<00:02:17.420> I<00:02:17.450> haven't<00:02:17.840> got<00:02:17.930> that<00:02:18.140> and<00:02:18.290> there's

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
whatnot I haven't got that and there's

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.500 
whatnot I haven't got that and there's
some<00:02:18.650> bugs<00:02:18.890> with<00:02:19.010> the<00:02:19.190> refuel<00:02:19.760> function<00:02:20.300> that

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
some bugs with the refuel function that

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.990 
some bugs with the refuel function that
I'm<00:02:20.659> working<00:02:21.260> out<00:02:21.560> but<00:02:21.920> it<00:02:22.159> works<00:02:22.400> well<00:02:22.670> enough

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
I'm working out but it works well enough

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.880 
I'm working out but it works well enough
right<00:02:23.209> now<00:02:23.239> I<00:02:23.420> can<00:02:23.690> show<00:02:23.810> it<00:02:23.840> to<00:02:23.959> you<00:02:24.080> guys

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
right now I can show it to you guys

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.190 
right now I can show it to you guys
over<00:02:25.160> here<00:02:25.430> I<00:02:25.460> have<00:02:26.030> some<00:02:26.390> power<00:02:26.990> being

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
over here I have some power being

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.520 
over here I have some power being
generated<00:02:27.490> and<00:02:28.490> then<00:02:29.420> here<00:02:29.750> is<00:02:29.900> the<00:02:30.110> white<00:02:30.350> in

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
generated and then here is the white in

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.050 
generated and then here is the white in
your<00:02:30.680> chest<00:02:30.920> this<00:02:31.130> is<00:02:31.280> then<00:02:31.460> a<00:02:31.490> chest<00:02:31.820> at<00:02:31.970> the

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
your chest this is then a chest at the

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.940 
your chest this is then a chest at the
turtle<00:02:32.420> the<00:02:32.540> mining<00:02:32.990> wells<00:02:33.110> be<00:02:33.260> dumping<00:02:33.590> into

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
turtle the mining wells be dumping into

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.800 
turtle the mining wells be dumping into
which<00:02:34.520> will<00:02:34.670> be<00:02:34.760> going<00:02:34.910> into<00:02:35.240> this<00:02:35.510> system

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
which will be going into this system

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.930 
which will be going into this system
right<00:02:36.170> here<00:02:36.230> and<00:02:36.680> so<00:02:37.520> we're<00:02:37.670> going<00:02:37.760> to<00:02:37.880> go

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
right here and so we're going to go

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.640 
right here and so we're going to go
ahead<00:02:38.060> and<00:02:38.420> we'll<00:02:38.630> just<00:02:38.780> give<00:02:38.960> it<00:02:39.080> a<00:02:39.140> quick<00:02:39.290> run

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
ahead and we'll just give it a quick run

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.130 
ahead and we'll just give it a quick run
real<00:02:39.860> quick<00:02:39.890> and<00:02:40.400> we'll<00:02:40.850> call<00:02:41.150> it<00:02:41.330> our<00:02:41.540> run

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
real quick and we'll call it our run

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.440 
real quick and we'll call it our run
let's<00:02:42.410> dig<00:02:42.740> and<00:02:43.010> we'll<00:02:43.190> just<00:02:43.310> run<00:02:43.460> it<00:02:43.610> once<00:02:43.820> and

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
let's dig and we'll just run it once and

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.370 
let's dig and we'll just run it once and
so<00:02:45.050> you<00:02:45.110> can<00:02:45.230> see<00:02:45.470> and<00:02:46.780> they<00:02:47.780> all<00:02:47.930> go<00:02:48.110> ahead

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
so you can see and they all go ahead

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.260 
so you can see and they all go ahead
they<00:02:48.560> start<00:02:48.890> mining<00:02:49.310> they<00:02:49.430> start<00:02:49.730> going<00:02:50.030> down

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
they start mining they start going down

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.449 
they start mining they start going down
and<00:02:51.230> if<00:02:51.350> we<00:02:51.470> go<00:02:51.590> ahead<00:02:51.709> and<00:02:51.920> check<00:02:52.040> here<00:02:52.340> you

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
and if we go ahead and check here you

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:53.949 
and if we go ahead and check here you
can<00:02:52.610> see<00:02:52.820> that<00:02:52.970> it's<00:02:53.120> stumping<00:02:53.600> the<00:02:53.690> stand

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
can see that it's stumping the stand

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.080 
can see that it's stumping the stand
stone<00:02:54.200> in<00:02:54.350> here<00:02:54.620> which<00:02:55.190> is<00:02:55.310> being<00:02:55.520> pulled<00:02:55.910> out

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
stone in here which is being pulled out

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.770 
stone in here which is being pulled out
into<00:02:56.650> this<00:02:57.650> system<00:02:58.130> right<00:02:58.310> here<00:02:58.660> so<00:02:59.660> you<00:02:59.750> can

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
into this system right here so you can

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.010 
into this system right here so you can
see<00:02:59.959> this<00:03:00.140> is<00:03:00.320> actually<00:03:00.680> increasing<00:03:01.070> as<00:03:01.430> well

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.020 
see this is actually increasing as well

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.500 
see this is actually increasing as well
and<00:03:03.020> so<00:03:03.290> we'll<00:03:03.470> let<00:03:03.680> them<00:03:03.860> run<00:03:04.370> real<00:03:04.850> quick<00:03:04.880> and

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
and so we'll let them run real quick and

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.830 
and so we'll let them run real quick and
now<00:03:06.050> one<00:03:06.350> slight<00:03:06.650> bug<00:03:06.920> to<00:03:07.160> note<00:03:07.540> because<00:03:08.540> the

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
now one slight bug to note because the

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.150 
now one slight bug to note because the
way<00:03:08.959> mining<00:03:09.290> wells<00:03:09.440> work<00:03:09.680> they<00:03:09.890> actually

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
way mining wells work they actually

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.699 
way mining wells work they actually
deposit<00:03:10.760> some<00:03:11.000> of<00:03:11.090> the<00:03:11.239> stuff<00:03:12.080> they<00:03:12.260> get<00:03:12.470> in

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
deposit some of the stuff they get in

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:15.310 
deposit some of the stuff they get in
this<00:03:13.459> one<00:03:13.760> drawbridge<00:03:14.360> most<00:03:14.989> of<00:03:15.110> the<00:03:15.170> time

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
this one drawbridge most of the time

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.080 
this one drawbridge most of the time
it's<00:03:15.500> not<00:03:15.590> a<00:03:15.650> big<00:03:15.739> deal<00:03:16.070> considering<00:03:16.610> it'll<00:03:16.970> be

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
it's not a big deal considering it'll be

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.690 
it's not a big deal considering it'll be
the<00:03:17.300> first<00:03:17.570> two<00:03:18.170> layers<00:03:18.440> I<00:03:18.830> get<00:03:19.040> pause<00:03:19.250> tossed

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
the first two layers I get pause tossed

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:20.890 
the first two layers I get pause tossed
in<00:03:19.940> here<00:03:19.970> so<00:03:20.239> most<00:03:20.390> of<00:03:20.450> the<00:03:20.540> time<00:03:20.690> it<00:03:20.840> will

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
in here so most of the time it will

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.270 
in here so most of the time it will
actually<00:03:21.170> just<00:03:21.290> be<00:03:21.350> dirt<00:03:21.709> that<00:03:21.890> gets<00:03:22.100> tossed

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
actually just be dirt that gets tossed

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.620 
actually just be dirt that gets tossed
in<00:03:22.610> here<00:03:23.170> um<00:03:24.170> but<00:03:24.920> since<00:03:25.820> this<00:03:26.030> is<00:03:26.209> all

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
in here um but since this is all

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.930 
in here um but since this is all
sandstone<00:03:27.260> world<00:03:27.590> it<00:03:27.920> it's<00:03:28.550> actually

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
sandstone world it it's actually

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.840 
sandstone world it it's actually
sandstone<00:03:29.560> that<00:03:30.560> gets<00:03:30.980> put<00:03:31.220> in<00:03:31.340> there<00:03:31.549> and<00:03:31.730> you

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
sandstone that gets put in there and you

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:33.100 
sandstone that gets put in there and you
can<00:03:31.970> see<00:03:32.120> they'll<00:03:32.330> all<00:03:32.450> go<00:03:32.630> ahead<00:03:32.870> they'll

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
can see they'll all go ahead they'll

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:34.690 
can see they'll all go ahead they'll
move<00:03:33.320> forward<00:03:33.769> and<00:03:33.890> they'll<00:03:34.040> be<00:03:34.130> ready<00:03:34.280> to<00:03:34.489> go

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
move forward and they'll be ready to go

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.180 
move forward and they'll be ready to go
and<00:03:35.030> they<00:03:35.690> all<00:03:35.870> have<00:03:36.140> their<00:03:36.320> stuff<00:03:36.650> back<00:03:36.830> in<00:03:37.070> it

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
and they all have their stuff back in it

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.009 
and they all have their stuff back in it
so<00:03:37.700> it's<00:03:37.790> a<00:03:37.850> really<00:03:38.000> cool<00:03:38.209> system<00:03:38.450> I<00:03:38.780> thought

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
so it's a really cool system I thought

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:42.009 
so it's a really cool system I thought
it<00:03:39.200> was<00:03:39.410> um<00:03:39.739> really<00:03:40.160> good<00:03:40.489> see<00:03:41.420> if<00:03:41.540> we<00:03:41.690> check

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
it was um really good see if we check

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:43.900 
it was um really good see if we check
you<00:03:42.350> can<00:03:42.470> see<00:03:42.650> they<00:03:42.799> go<00:03:42.920> all<00:03:43.160> the<00:03:43.280> way<00:03:43.310> down<00:03:43.610> to

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
you can see they go all the way down to

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:48.970 
you can see they go all the way down to
bedrock<00:03:44.269> in<00:03:45.459> approximately<00:03:46.459> 35<00:03:47.000> seconds<00:03:47.980> I've

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
bedrock in approximately 35 seconds I've

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.009 
bedrock in approximately 35 seconds I've
been<00:03:49.160> messing<00:03:49.340> with<00:03:49.519> this<00:03:49.820> an<00:03:50.150> attempt<00:03:50.750> to<00:03:50.840> get

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.019 
been messing with this an attempt to get

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:52.630 
been messing with this an attempt to get
more<00:03:51.260> but<00:03:51.500> it<00:03:51.620> seems<00:03:51.860> like<00:03:52.040> it's<00:03:52.220> still<00:03:52.310> only

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 
more but it seems like it's still only

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.840 
more but it seems like it's still only
in<00:03:52.940> putting<00:03:53.390> about<00:03:53.510> a<00:03:53.660> hundred<00:03:54.080> MJ<00:03:54.850> they're

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
in putting about a hundred MJ they're

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:57.759 
in putting about a hundred MJ they're
only<00:03:56.090> pulling<00:03:56.510> out<00:03:56.660> a<00:03:56.690> hundred<00:03:56.930> MJ<00:03:57.440> so<00:03:57.500> I<00:03:57.620> have

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
only pulling out a hundred MJ so I have

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:00.210 
only pulling out a hundred MJ so I have
to<00:03:57.860> figure<00:03:58.100> out<00:03:58.130> a<00:03:58.250> better<00:03:58.580> way<00:03:59.180> to<00:03:59.209> power<00:03:59.780> it

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
to figure out a better way to power it

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.070 
to figure out a better way to power it
considering<00:04:01.220> this<00:04:01.340> is<00:04:01.519> giving<00:04:02.180> a<00:04:02.330> maximum<00:04:03.049> of

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 
considering this is giving a maximum of

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.310 
considering this is giving a maximum of
100<00:04:03.590> mega<00:04:03.830> joules<00:04:04.100> to<00:04:05.030> 16<00:04:05.540> different<00:04:05.690> engines

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:06.320 
100 mega joules to 16 different engines

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.380 
100 mega joules to 16 different engines
but<00:04:06.830> anyway<00:04:07.010> I'm<00:04:07.220> going<00:04:07.549> to<00:04:07.700> let<00:04:07.850> this<00:04:08.000> program

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
but anyway I'm going to let this program

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.060 
but anyway I'm going to let this program
won't<00:04:08.600> run<00:04:08.930> and<00:04:09.140> let<00:04:09.260> you<00:04:09.380> guys<00:04:09.500> kind<00:04:09.739> of<00:04:09.830> see

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.070 
won't run and let you guys kind of see

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:13.449 
won't run and let you guys kind of see
how<00:04:10.280> it<00:04:10.610> works<00:04:11.180> so<00:04:12.080> we<00:04:12.320> will<00:04:12.530> go<00:04:12.680> ahead<00:04:12.799> and<00:04:12.950> run

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 
how it works so we will go ahead and run

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:17.370 
how it works so we will go ahead and run
let's<00:04:13.760> dig<00:04:14.360> for<00:04:15.350> let's<00:04:15.709> say<00:04:15.980> I<00:04:16.370> don't<00:04:16.609> know

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
let's dig for let's say I don't know

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.140 
let's dig for let's say I don't know
twenty<00:04:18.380> five<00:04:18.560> times<00:04:18.919> and<00:04:19.280> I'll<00:04:19.489> go<00:04:19.640> ahead<00:04:19.760> and

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
twenty five times and I'll go ahead and

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:21.550 
twenty five times and I'll go ahead and
fast-forward<00:04:20.540> that<00:04:20.870> for<00:04:21.049> you<00:04:21.140> guys<00:04:21.260> so<00:04:21.500> you

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
fast-forward that for you guys so you

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.520 
fast-forward that for you guys so you
guys<00:04:21.620> can<00:04:21.950> watch<00:04:22.130> it<00:04:22.340> go
