00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.490 

so<00:01:59.860> to<00:02:00.040> accommodate<00:02:00.280> the<00:02:00.730> turbo<00:02:01.270> we<00:02:01.480> put<00:02:02.140> Forge

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
so to accommodate the turbo we put Forge

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.550 
so to accommodate the turbo we put Forge
piston<00:02:03.070> with<00:02:03.910> lower<00:02:04.090> compression<00:02:04.750> ratio<00:02:05.380> and

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
piston with lower compression ratio and

piston with lower compression ratio and
the<00:02:05.830> engine<00:02:06.160> I<00:02:06.340> also<00:02:06.820> changed<00:02:07.300> the<00:02:07.450> injector

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:07.900 
the engine I also changed the injector

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.590 
the engine I also changed the injector
compared<00:02:08.320> to<00:02:08.440> standard<00:02:08.770> maverick<00:02:09.369> so<00:02:10.270> this<00:02:10.450> is

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
compared to standard maverick so this is

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.920 
compared to standard maverick so this is
new<00:02:11.320> for<00:02:11.560> specifically<00:02:12.310> for<00:02:12.400> the<00:02:12.670> turbo<00:02:13.090> the

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
new for specifically for the turbo the

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.160 
new for specifically for the turbo the
turbo<00:02:14.200> itself<00:02:14.560> is<00:02:14.850> running<00:02:15.850> with<00:02:16.570> electronic

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
turbo itself is running with electronic

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.370 
turbo itself is running with electronic
boost<00:02:17.350> control<00:02:17.830> it's<00:02:18.480> variable<00:02:19.480> from<00:02:19.840> zero<00:02:20.170> to

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
boost control it's variable from zero to

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.800 
boost control it's variable from zero to
eight<00:02:20.620> pounds<00:02:21.280> of<00:02:21.400> boost<00:02:21.580> so<00:02:22.330> this<00:02:22.540> is<00:02:22.690> all

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
eight pounds of boost so this is all

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.990 
eight pounds of boost so this is all
electronically<00:02:23.620> managed<00:02:24.070> and<00:02:24.400> is<00:02:24.730> going<00:02:24.910> to

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
electronically managed and is going to

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.170 
electronically managed and is going to
vary<00:02:25.210> during<00:02:25.540> the<00:02:25.690> ride<00:02:26.160> depending<00:02:27.160> -<00:02:27.790> to<00:02:28.000> make

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
vary during the ride depending - to make

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.180 
vary during the ride depending - to make
it<00:02:28.330> optimal<00:02:28.840> performance<00:02:29.080> basically<00:02:29.890> and

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
it optimal performance basically and

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.790 
it optimal performance basically and
also<00:02:30.940> one<00:02:31.240> of<00:02:31.270> the<00:02:31.450> major<00:02:31.690> change<00:02:32.110> we<00:02:32.290> did<00:02:32.470> is

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
also one of the major change we did is

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.990 
also one of the major change we did is
in<00:02:33.220> the<00:02:33.610> CVT<00:02:34.450> we're<00:02:35.410> using<00:02:35.650> a<00:02:35.860> totally<00:02:36.340> new

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000

in the CVT we're using a totally new

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.210 
driven clutch it's what we call QRS or
quick<00:02:40.870> response<00:02:40.900> system<00:02:41.709> it's<00:02:41.980> going<00:02:42.100> to

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
quick response system it's going to

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.610 
quick response system it's going to
clamp<00:02:42.640> the<00:02:42.820> belt<00:02:43.030> much<00:02:43.270> quicker<00:02:43.570> for<00:02:43.930> a<00:02:43.990> crisp
