hi<00:00:12.080> this<00:00:12.140> is<00:00:12.410> my<00:00:12.680> hair<00:00:12.920> from<00:00:13.070> play<00:00:13.309> official

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:13.760 
hi this is my hair from play official

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.929 
hi this is my hair from play official
and<00:00:14.740> today<00:00:15.740> I'm<00:00:15.830> releasing<00:00:16.070> a<00:00:16.309> video<00:00:16.429> about

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:16.939 
and today I'm releasing a video about

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:20.349 
and today I'm releasing a video about
all<00:00:17.929> of<00:00:17.989> the<00:00:18.529> what<00:00:19.099> I<00:00:19.130> would<00:00:19.400> say<00:00:19.579> a<00:00:19.609> viable

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:20.359 
all of the what I would say a viable

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:23.409 
all of the what I would say a viable
kind<00:00:20.749> of<00:00:20.869> healing<00:00:21.140> specs<00:00:21.650> for<00:00:22.039> PVE<00:00:22.489> in<00:00:22.880> mists

00:00:23.409 --> 00:00:23.419 
kind of healing specs for PVE in mists

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:25.569 
kind of healing specs for PVE in mists
of<00:00:23.449> pandaria<00:00:23.919> so<00:00:24.919> I'm<00:00:24.980> going<00:00:25.159> to<00:00:25.189> start<00:00:25.489> off

00:00:25.569 --> 00:00:25.579 
of pandaria so I'm going to start off

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:27.519 
of pandaria so I'm going to start off
with<00:00:25.640> druids<00:00:26.060> because<00:00:26.869> that's<00:00:27.050> probably<00:00:27.380> what

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:27.529 
with druids because that's probably what

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:30.429 
with druids because that's probably what
I've<00:00:27.619> been<00:00:27.769> playing<00:00:28.039> the<00:00:28.220> most<00:00:29.050> so<00:00:30.050> on<00:00:30.319> the

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:30.439 
I've been playing the most so on the

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:33.720 
I've been playing the most so on the
first<00:00:30.679> tree<00:00:31.039> we<00:00:31.579> have<00:00:31.819> 15<00:00:32.570> 10<00:00:32.840> movement<00:00:33.320> speed

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:33.730 
first tree we have 15 10 movement speed

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.900 
first tree we have 15 10 movement speed
we<00:00:34.730> have<00:00:34.970> an<00:00:35.330> ability<00:00:35.600> that<00:00:36.310> leaps<00:00:37.310> is<00:00:37.550> forward

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910 
we have an ability that leaps is forward

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.090 
we have an ability that leaps is forward
and<00:00:38.030> puts<00:00:38.240> them<00:00:38.450> proud<00:00:38.810> and<00:00:39.110> we<00:00:39.560> have<00:00:39.710> wild

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
and puts them proud and we have wild

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.430 
and puts them proud and we have wild
charge<00:00:40.340> which<00:00:40.670> is<00:00:40.700> basically<00:00:41.390> used<00:00:41.720> to<00:00:41.900> swap

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 
charge which is basically used to swap

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.640 
charge which is basically used to swap
places<00:00:42.620> with<00:00:42.950> someone<00:00:43.520> because<00:00:44.470> we<00:00:45.470> won't

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:45.650 
places with someone because we won't

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.620 
places with someone because we won't
really<00:00:45.980> be<00:00:46.070> switching<00:00:46.670> forms<00:00:47.030> that<00:00:47.270> much<00:00:47.450> in

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:47.630 
really be switching forms that much in

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.350 
really be switching forms that much in
PvE<00:00:47.990> I<00:00:48.050> guess<00:00:48.410> so<00:00:49.190> out<00:00:49.370> of<00:00:49.400> these<00:00:49.700> I<00:00:50.000> think

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360 
PvE I guess so out of these I think

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.530 
PvE I guess so out of these I think
probably<00:00:51.080> wild<00:00:51.620> charge<00:00:51.860> is<00:00:52.130> the<00:00:52.280> best<00:00:52.540> just

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:53.540 
probably wild charge is the best just

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.140 
probably wild charge is the best just
because<00:00:53.870> we<00:00:54.110> can<00:00:54.290> simply<00:00:55.100> just<00:00:55.130> fly<00:00:55.490> to<00:00:55.520> people

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:56.150 
because we can simply just fly to people

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.360 
because we can simply just fly to people
just<00:00:56.180> just<00:00:56.840> like<00:00:57.020> that<00:00:57.230> it's<00:00:57.680> quick<00:00:58.010> it's<00:00:58.310> easy

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
just just like that it's quick it's easy

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.990 
just just like that it's quick it's easy
is<00:00:58.970> very<00:00:59.480> mobile<00:01:00.010> another<00:01:01.010> thing<00:01:01.340> that<00:01:01.610> might

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
is very mobile another thing that might

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.929 
is very mobile another thing that might
be<00:01:02.210> effective<00:01:02.810> is<00:01:03.020> the<00:01:03.860> 15th<00:01:04.309> cent<00:01:04.519> movement

00:01:04.929 --> 00:01:04.939 
be effective is the 15th cent movement

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:06.969 
be effective is the 15th cent movement
speed<00:01:05.179> increased<00:01:05.689> but<00:01:05.990> I<00:01:06.020> don't<00:01:06.319> think<00:01:06.560> it

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
speed increased but I don't think it

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:09.219 
speed increased but I don't think it
will<00:01:07.310> provide<00:01:07.759> as<00:01:08.090> bigger<00:01:08.299> bonuses<00:01:08.899> while<00:01:09.079> it

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
will provide as bigger bonuses while it

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.179 
will provide as bigger bonuses while it
charged<00:01:09.560> us<00:01:10.569> now<00:01:11.569> for<00:01:11.630> our<00:01:11.840> second<00:01:12.229> tree<00:01:12.439> we

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:13.189 
charged us now for our second tree we

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:15.760 
charged us now for our second tree we
have<00:01:13.399> nature<00:01:14.329> swiftness<00:01:14.749> renewal<00:01:15.590> and

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
have nature swiftness renewal and

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.029 
have nature swiftness renewal and
scenario<00:01:16.700> would<00:01:16.969> out<00:01:17.869> of<00:01:18.229> these<00:01:18.439> I<00:01:18.770> think

00:01:19.029 --> 00:01:19.039 
scenario would out of these I think

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:21.550 
scenario would out of these I think
either<00:01:19.460> nature<00:01:19.939> swiftness<00:01:20.359> or<00:01:20.719> scenario<00:01:21.229> ward

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
either nature swiftness or scenario ward

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.379 
either nature swiftness or scenario ward
or<00:01:21.859> what<00:01:22.369> we're<00:01:22.520> going<00:01:22.639> to<00:01:22.759> be<00:01:22.789> going<00:01:22.999> for

00:01:23.379 --> 00:01:23.389 
or what we're going to be going for

00:01:23.389 --> 00:01:25.539 
or what we're going to be going for
scenario<00:01:24.170> em<00:01:24.229> ward<00:01:24.469> is<00:01:24.679> just<00:01:24.979> another<00:01:25.219> hot

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:25.549 
scenario em ward is just another hot

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:29.169 
scenario em ward is just another hot
it's<00:01:25.850> on<00:01:25.999> 30<00:01:26.299> second<00:01:26.749> cooldown<00:01:26.899> and<00:01:28.179> it

00:01:29.169 --> 00:01:29.179 
it's on 30 second cooldown and it

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:31.779 
it's on 30 second cooldown and it
actually<00:01:29.359> provides<00:01:29.990> slightly<00:01:30.950> less<00:01:31.249> healing

00:01:31.779 --> 00:01:31.789 
actually provides slightly less healing

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:34.359 
actually provides slightly less healing
per<00:01:31.999> second<00:01:32.509> or<00:01:32.749> healing<00:01:33.530> per<00:01:33.740> minute<00:01:34.100> should

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.369 
per second or healing per minute should

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:36.879 
per second or healing per minute should
I<00:01:34.490> say<00:01:34.700> overall<00:01:35.119> the<00:01:35.630> nature<00:01:36.079> swiftness<00:01:36.530> does

00:01:36.879 --> 00:01:36.889 
I say overall the nature swiftness does

00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:39.309 
I say overall the nature swiftness does
however<00:01:37.639> because<00:01:38.509> it's<00:01:38.689> on<00:01:38.840> a<00:01:38.869> shorter

00:01:39.309 --> 00:01:39.319 
however because it's on a shorter

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:41.080 
however because it's on a shorter
cooldown<00:01:39.469> you<00:01:39.889> can<00:01:40.069> get<00:01:40.249> that<00:01:40.429> bit<00:01:40.639> of<00:01:40.670> extra

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
cooldown you can get that bit of extra

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.830 
cooldown you can get that bit of extra
healing<00:01:41.509> more<00:01:41.689> often<00:01:42.880> so<00:01:43.880> for<00:01:44.090> that<00:01:44.209> reason<00:01:44.270> I

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
healing more often so for that reason I

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.629 
healing more often so for that reason I
picks<00:01:45.499> an<00:01:45.649> area<00:01:45.920> board<00:01:46.189> over<00:01:46.399> nature

00:01:46.629 --> 00:01:46.639 
picks an area board over nature

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:50.550 
picks an area board over nature
swiftness<00:01:47.319> however<00:01:48.319> it<00:01:49.189> does<00:01:49.520> cost<00:01:49.789> money<00:01:50.060> so

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
swiftness however it does cost money so

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.139 
swiftness however it does cost money so
it's<00:01:51.560> pretty<00:01:51.889> even<00:01:52.340> between<00:01:52.609> those<00:01:52.880> and<00:01:52.909> we

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:53.149 
it's pretty even between those and we

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:56.379 
it's pretty even between those and we
might<00:01:53.359> be<00:01:53.509> switching<00:01:53.749> fights<00:01:54.639> now<00:01:55.639> for<00:01:56.329> the

00:01:56.379 --> 00:01:56.389 
might be switching fights now for the

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:58.749 
might be switching fights now for the
next<00:01:56.509> tree<00:01:56.869> we<00:01:57.079> are<00:01:57.200> fairly<00:01:57.469> swarm<00:01:57.859> mass

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
next tree we are fairly swarm mass

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:01.779 
next tree we are fairly swarm mass
entanglement<00:01:59.420> and<00:01:59.689> typhoon<00:02:00.490> none<00:02:01.490> of<00:02:01.520> these

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:01.789 
entanglement and typhoon none of these

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:04.490 
entanglement and typhoon none of these
are<00:02:02.329> super<00:02:03.020> beneficial<00:02:03.229> to<00:02:03.920> us

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
are super beneficial to us

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.680 
are super beneficial to us
you<00:02:05.010> know<00:02:05.190> in<00:02:05.400> in<00:02:06.360> pv<00:02:06.810> Ezra<00:02:07.350> stone<00:02:07.910> so<00:02:08.910> I<00:02:09.300> think

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
you know in in pv Ezra stone so I think

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.520 
you know in in pv Ezra stone so I think
in<00:02:10.020> most<00:02:10.200> cases<00:02:10.560> you<00:02:10.920> probably<00:02:11.250> pick<00:02:11.490> typhoon

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
in most cases you probably pick typhoon

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.290 
in most cases you probably pick typhoon
just<00:02:13.530> because<00:02:13.890> if<00:02:14.220> there's<00:02:14.490> a<00:02:14.580> few<00:02:14.850> ads<00:02:15.030> about

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
just because if there's a few ads about

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.210 
just because if there's a few ads about
and<00:02:15.690> stuff<00:02:15.900> you<00:02:16.020> can<00:02:16.200> help<00:02:16.440> keep<00:02:16.680> those<00:02:16.860> under

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
and stuff you can help keep those under

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.190 
and stuff you can help keep those under
control<00:02:17.700> but<00:02:18.420> I've<00:02:18.540> just<00:02:18.780> got<00:02:18.990> mass

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200

increases all damage of healing done by

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.790 
increases all damage of healing done by
twenty<00:04:21.190> percent<00:04:21.430> 30<00:04:21.759> seconds<00:04:22.300> and<00:04:22.360> also<00:04:22.800> 25%

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
twenty percent 30 seconds and also 25%

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.900 
twenty percent 30 seconds and also 25%
of<00:04:23.949> the<00:04:24.130> healing<00:04:24.520> we<00:04:24.729> do<00:04:24.910> is<00:04:25.650> also<00:04:26.650> added<00:04:27.550> on<00:04:27.729> as

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
of the healing we do is also added on as

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.060 
of the healing we do is also added on as
damage<00:04:28.300> so<00:04:28.690> it's<00:04:29.440> going<00:04:29.650> to<00:04:29.740> do<00:04:29.830> a<00:04:29.860> bit<00:04:30.039> of

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
damage so it's going to do a bit of

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.580 
damage so it's going to do a bit of
extra<00:04:30.460> damage<00:04:30.699> and<00:04:31.509> it<00:04:31.960> gives<00:04:32.139> us<00:04:32.259> twenty

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
extra damage and it gives us twenty

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:34.560 
extra damage and it gives us twenty
percent<00:04:32.800> healing<00:04:33.160> for<00:04:33.370> 30<00:04:33.669> seconds<00:04:34.389> that's

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
percent healing for 30 seconds that's

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.629 
percent healing for 30 seconds that's
quite<00:04:34.810> a<00:04:34.840> long<00:04:35.080> time<00:04:35.110> so<00:04:36.039> we<00:04:36.190> could<00:04:36.340> use<00:04:36.490> that

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:36.639 
quite a long time so we could use that

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:39.240 
quite a long time so we could use that
