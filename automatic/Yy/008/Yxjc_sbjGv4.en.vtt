00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.209 
wait and feel to see if you maybe feel a
hit<00:01:38.200> on<00:01:38.289> the<00:01:38.380> way<00:01:38.500> down<00:01:38.530> sometimes<00:01:39.070> just

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:39.219 
hit on the way down sometimes just

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:40.319 
hit on the way down sometimes just
throwing<00:01:39.340> that<00:01:39.429> drop<00:01:39.700> you'll<00:01:39.880> actually<00:01:40.030> pick

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:40.329 
throwing that drop you'll actually pick

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:42.330 
throwing that drop you'll actually pick
up<00:01:40.420> a<00:01:40.539> fish<00:01:40.780> once<00:01:41.590> you've<00:01:41.740> got<00:01:41.890> the<00:01:42.039> line<00:01:42.189> on

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
up a fish once you've got the line on

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.859 
up a fish once you've got the line on
the<00:01:42.429> bottom<00:01:42.759> you<00:01:42.850> go<00:01:42.969> ahead<00:01:43.090> and<00:01:43.420> reel<00:01:43.689> in<00:01:43.810> a

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
the bottom you go ahead and reel in a

the bottom you go ahead and reel in a
bit<00:01:44.020> of<00:01:44.289> slack<00:01:44.500> and<00:01:44.530> what<00:01:44.770> you<00:01:44.829> want<00:01:44.979> to<00:01:45.039> do<00:01:45.100> is

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:45.159 
bit of slack and what you want to do is

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:47.160 
bit of slack and what you want to do is
you<00:01:45.219> just<00:01:45.249> want<00:01:45.369> to<00:01:45.549> test<00:01:45.789> where<00:01:46.780> you<00:01:46.810> can<00:01:47.020> feel

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
you just want to test where you can feel

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:48.359 
you just want to test where you can feel
the<00:01:47.200> bottom<00:01:47.469> if<00:01:47.710> you<00:01:47.770> got<00:01:47.890> a<00:01:47.920> good<00:01:48.100> if<00:01:48.189> you<00:01:48.249> get

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:48.369 
the bottom if you got a good if you get

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:49.919 
the bottom if you got a good if you get
the<00:01:48.460> right<00:01:48.700> weight<00:01:48.939> of<00:01:49.060> your<00:01:49.179> slab<00:01:49.450> with<00:01:49.840> the

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:53.799 
should be able to feel at the bottom you

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:55.109 
should be able to feel at the bottom you
should<00:01:53.829> have<00:01:54.070> -<00:01:54.189> I<00:01:54.219> can<00:01:54.399> see<00:01:54.609> it<00:01:54.640> but<00:01:54.909> I<00:01:54.969> don't

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.119 
should have - I can see it but I don't

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:56.310 
should have - I can see it but I don't
really<00:01:55.210> have<00:01:55.299> to<00:01:55.450> see<00:01:55.630> it<00:01:55.719> I<00:01:55.780> can<00:01:55.899> feel<00:01:56.079> it<00:01:56.200> it's

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
really have to see it I can feel it it's

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.130 
really have to see it I can feel it it's
bottom<00:01:56.740> bottom<00:01:57.520> bottom<00:01:57.700> and<00:01:58.299> then<00:01:58.869> you<00:01:58.960> want

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
bottom bottom bottom and then you want

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.919 
bottom bottom bottom and then you want
to<00:01:59.170> start<00:01:59.409> your<00:01:59.499> jigging<00:01:59.859> you<00:01:59.950> want<00:02:00.159> a<00:02:00.219> jig

00:02:00.919 --> 00:02:00.929 
to start your jigging you want a jig

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:03.510 
to start your jigging you want a jig
between<00:02:01.929> 6<00:02:02.350> to<00:02:02.409> 12<00:02:02.710> inches<00:02:02.859> up<00:02:03.249> and<00:02:03.369> down

between 6 to 12 inches up and down

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.219 
between 6 to 12 inches up and down
sometimes<00:02:03.759> we'll<00:02:04.090> see<00:02:04.179> a<00:02:04.210> higher<00:02:04.509> but<00:02:04.810> start

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
sometimes we'll see a higher but start

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:06.959 
sometimes we'll see a higher but start
out<00:02:05.380> with<00:02:05.499> that<00:02:05.710> to<00:02:05.890> learn<00:02:06.009> the<00:02:06.219> technique<00:02:06.850> in

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:06.969 
out with that to learn the technique in

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:08.940 
out with that to learn the technique in
the<00:02:07.060> field<00:02:07.329> and<00:02:07.899> what<00:02:08.050> you<00:02:08.140> want<00:02:08.380> to<00:02:08.470> do<00:02:08.649> is<00:02:08.830> you

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
the field and what you want to do is you

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.430 
the field and what you want to do is you
want<00:02:09.190> to<00:02:09.250> make<00:02:09.520> this<00:02:09.880> slab<00:02:10.240> look<00:02:10.600> like<00:02:11.410> a

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
want to make this slab look like a

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.900 
want to make this slab look like a
minnow<00:02:11.830> that's<00:02:12.130> just<00:02:12.310> like<00:02:12.460> it's<00:02:12.730> been

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
minnow that's just like it's been

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.210 
minnow that's just like it's been
already<00:02:13.090> been<00:02:13.180> hit<00:02:13.540> and<00:02:13.750> it's<00:02:14.470> now<00:02:14.620> dying<00:02:14.950> and

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
already been hit and it's now dying and

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.380 
already been hit and it's now dying and
it's<00:02:15.310> falling<00:02:15.730> to<00:02:15.850> the<00:02:15.970> ground

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
it's falling to the ground

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.240 
it's falling to the ground
now<00:02:16.900> here's<00:02:17.319> what<00:02:17.470> I<00:02:17.500> was<00:02:17.620> talking<00:02:17.950> about<00:02:18.010> the

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
now here's what I was talking about the

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:19.470 
now here's what I was talking about the
mistake<00:02:18.550> people<00:02:18.760> make<00:02:18.910> you<00:02:19.150> want<00:02:19.300> to<00:02:19.360> make

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
mistake people make you want to make

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.870 
mistake people make you want to make
sure<00:02:19.510> that<00:02:19.900> your<00:02:20.800> rod<00:02:21.040> is<00:02:21.220> about<00:02:21.490> at<00:02:21.700> this

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
sure that your rod is about at this

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.040 
sure that your rod is about at this
angle<00:02:22.150> when<00:02:22.480> you're<00:02:22.600> actually<00:02:22.750> touching

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
angle when you're actually touching

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.320 
angle when you're actually touching
bottom<00:02:23.590> you<00:02:24.069> don't<00:02:24.250> want<00:02:24.519> your<00:02:24.610> rod<00:02:24.849> to<00:02:25.030> be<00:02:25.150> up

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
bottom you don't want your rod to be up

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:26.789 
bottom you don't want your rod to be up
this<00:02:25.540> high<00:02:25.780> when<00:02:26.019> you're<00:02:26.140> touching<00:02:26.290> bottom

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:26.799 
this high when you're touching bottom

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:28.200 
this high when you're touching bottom
because<00:02:27.190> it<00:02:27.280> doesn't<00:02:27.549> give<00:02:27.640> you<00:02:27.730> enough

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.210 
because it doesn't give you enough

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.330 
because it doesn't give you enough
work<00:02:28.450> with<00:02:28.750> right<00:02:29.470> so<00:02:29.620> you<00:02:29.710> want<00:02:29.860> to<00:02:29.980> be<00:02:30.100> fairly

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
work with right so you want to be fairly

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.770 
work with right so you want to be fairly
loads<00:02:30.700> to<00:02:30.850> the<00:02:30.880> water<00:02:31.150> maybe<00:02:31.360> even<00:02:31.630> a<00:02:31.690> little

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
loads to the water maybe even a little

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.630 
loads to the water maybe even a little
lower<00:02:32.050> than<00:02:32.170> that<00:02:32.350> and<00:02:33.010> you<00:02:33.190> begin<00:02:33.490> your

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
lower than that and you begin your

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.790 
lower than that and you begin your
jigging<00:02:34.000> motion<00:02:34.390> and<00:02:35.110> this<00:02:35.230> is<00:02:35.380> how<00:02:35.500> this<00:02:35.650> is

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
jigging motion and this is how this is

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.320 
jigging motion and this is how this is
proper<00:02:36.250> jigging<00:02:36.580> motion<00:02:37.000> and<00:02:37.120> this<00:02:37.210> is

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
proper jigging motion and this is

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.370 
proper jigging motion and this is
probably<00:02:37.630> where<00:02:37.780> I'll<00:02:37.900> superimpose<00:02:38.590> the

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
probably where I'll superimpose the

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.430 
probably where I'll superimpose the
dropping<00:02:41.940> discus<00:02:42.940> slab<00:02:43.600> a<00:02:43.630> little<00:02:44.020> bit<00:02:44.200> for

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
dropping discus slab a little bit for

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.410 
dropping discus slab a little bit for
you<00:02:44.560> so<00:02:44.680> you<00:02:44.770> can<00:02:44.890> see<00:02:45.070> it<00:02:45.220> but<00:02:45.790> this<00:02:45.910> jigging

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
you so you can see it but this jigging

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.060 
you so you can see it but this jigging
most<00:02:46.570> it<00:02:46.720> is<00:02:46.840> exactly<00:02:47.350> what<00:02:47.440> to<00:02:47.650> do<00:02:47.770> now<00:02:47.950> I've

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
most it is exactly what to do now I've

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:49.230 
most it is exactly what to do now I've
been<00:02:48.190> in<00:02:48.310> the<00:02:48.400> boat<00:02:48.580> with<00:02:48.700> people

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240 
been in the boat with people

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.120 
been in the boat with people
my<00:02:49.570> buddy<00:02:49.780> Hal<00:02:50.050> has<00:02:50.260> them<00:02:50.470> out<00:02:50.590> to<00:02:50.740> paint<00:02:50.980> a

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
my buddy Hal has them out to paint a

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.770 
my buddy Hal has them out to paint a
fish<00:02:51.310> with<00:02:51.490> them<00:02:51.640> all<00:02:51.730> the<00:02:51.850> time<00:02:52.030> and<00:02:52.360> they're

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
fish with them all the time and they're

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.030 
fish with them all the time and they're
do<00:02:52.930> they<00:02:53.110> think<00:02:53.380> they're<00:02:53.530> doing<00:02:53.560> this<00:02:53.860> but

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
do they think they're doing this but

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.560 
do they think they're doing this but
what<00:02:54.160> they're<00:02:54.280> doing<00:02:54.310> is<00:02:54.610> this<00:02:57.240> you<00:02:58.240> say<00:02:58.420> well

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
what they're doing is this you say well
