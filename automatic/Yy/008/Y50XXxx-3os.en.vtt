00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.130
 before talking about addon third 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.870
 I think it's worth mentioning those 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.240
 changes that have occurred with the game 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.619
 starting from the moment of its release and ending 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.660
 reaper of souls 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.029
 And besides, I'm in the original d3s 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.220
 last played code 2 somewhere back 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.410
 In general, in the area a couple of months from the release 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.599
 and therefore it is difficult for me to understand a little 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.140
 what changed addon and what some 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.060
 patch 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.520
 because I saw before me 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:38.160
 completely different game although it is not 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.360
 too loudly said the backbone of the gameplay 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.520
 stayed the same 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.740
 all also need to beat the monsters to collect 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.920
 laugh loot again beat again collect and 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.900
 again and again and again the difference is only visible 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.430
 in some small things however big 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.230
 the amount of such trifles in the end 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.240
 leads to serious adjustments 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.190
 for example, there was an auction which 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.440
 allowed in the presence of gold normally so 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.160
 buy different things for more 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.710
 small le vele 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.049
 many people did nâ€™t like it 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.450
 game balance blizzard listened 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.430
 listened and decided once so let's 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.409
 there will also be a real currency inject game 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.509
 so for the dollar and ransom attack with mine 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.640
 however at some point schizophrenia 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:17.130
 retreated and this whole stall was covered 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.200
 completely natural for firewood in itself 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.049
 money for that period until everything worked 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.770
 in short now there is no auction at all 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.569
 in what form the loot came to him in return 20 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.700
 updated payment system 

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:31.499
 characteristics of drop-down items are now in 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.819
 mostly they will fit exactly 

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:35.399
 class for which you are at the moment 

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:37.140
 play so it became quite normal 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:39.179
 what for example a monk has all the clothes 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.409
 adds either agility or vitality 

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:42.719
 either this this 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.850
 so the difference in meaning between different 

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:46.799
 parameters of the hero can reach hundreds 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.659
 and thousands of items, which is also important 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.549
 what is now optional 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.049
 difficulty for especially stupid 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.670
 on which even with the battle with yabla 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.200
 die is not easy and you can immediately 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.810
 aim a little higher 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.299
 although maybe this change has already made an addon 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.090
 I do not know at all three main things of reper 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.889
 dressing is the fifth act of adventure mode and 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:10.330
 new character crusader 

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:14.930
 first the same Oct 5 story here 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:17.600
 the plot is well like you need to kill death itself 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.760
 here's the whole story I'm fucking story 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.650
 it was always unimportant and special 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.570
 the plot twists and edges was famous 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.190
 Well, if only those in which the angel 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.590
 lost it turned out to be a black man that was it 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.540
 suddenly yes therefore if you subtract the story 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.160
 then we are given new locations of new monsters 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.510
 and new bosses and all that 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.270
 lasting three and a half 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.550
 four hours but I have a claim 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:40.370
 at the end of the game you will not be shown 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:42.830
 cinematic well, that is, the video will be but it 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:46.160
 semi drawn or animated 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:48.200
 screensaver well, what's the matter I understand that this 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.630
 little problem take a look it's big 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.340
 The problem is not only that for a long time to tear off 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.840
 shtsy 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.700
 or clips because of what's super cool 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.440
 CJ appear pixels the size of 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.850
 fist so now still at the end of us 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.430
 left just that under 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:03.350
 the stump is usually done for lack 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.210
 budget but I even strongly doubt that 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.970
 Blizzard problems with him especially 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:10.310
 considering that sol rappers cost 40 euros 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.560
 but still it is not so small from 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.330
 donkey for a couple of hours after passing 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.400
 the main game all characters will be 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.020
 available adventure mode each of 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.780
 Acts appears on five additional 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:22.850
 tasks mostly of course in the style come 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.370
 kill but sometimes come across and more or less 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:28.730
 especially protect a person or interrupt 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.530
 ritual but yes it's still come and kill 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.680
 for the execution of these instructions you will be 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.480
 dump money experience and clothes and if 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.520
 You complete all five tasks in a separate 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:41.600
 taken act get pouch out 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:44.510
 which all the same clothes fall out 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.489
 what else did you expect from diablo but also 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.370
 on these tasks will not fall and pieces 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:51.770
 field portal and if you collect five 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.720
 such it is possible to open this very portal 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:55.760
 and move to a new separate 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.010
 level on which there will be a lot of monsters 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.690
 and one long strip counter which 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.120
 shows how many more enemies need to be killed 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:05.900
 to have a boss and when i said that 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:08.420
 Monsters a lot I meant a lot 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.519
 then you win the boss come back 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.860
 back to the poster and you can start all 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:15.050
 here again like a high-level one 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.299
 content of you and will entertain frames 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:19.609
 sauce letting dozens more 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:21.590
 hours to spend the world sanctuary at 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:22.270
 provided that you enjoy 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.610
 process 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:27.520
 shoes for him though if you play 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:30.250
 diablo means get good too 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.349
 new merchants 1 offers you old 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.479
 good gambling ie characteristics 

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:37.389
 Items will not be known until purchase. 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:39.250
 a sort of cat in a bag give you sunset 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:41.500
 special currency which is also 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:44.050
 falls in adventure mode and have 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:46.360
 a chance to get cool stuff or 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:49.060
 incredible shit but two options 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:51.550
 and the second trafficker this fortune teller who 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.259
 offers two types of services either u 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.970
 good clothes for a fee and some 

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:57.460
 resources change one of the not like 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:59.740
 you characteristics or change the external 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.449
 kind of not to walk like a clown because 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.210
 in this dress stats above 

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:05.740
 now every thing is customizable and you can 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.110
 even on early levels 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:10.840
 impressive and powerful well and finally 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.710
 the new class is the templar that is 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.900
 crusader 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:16.210
 another melee character who 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:18.520
 very good area, it has a 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:20.590
 explodes he jumps like a barbarian almost 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.509
 riding a horse and even boys 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:24.729
 Comrades can help themselves 

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:27.909
 but I somehow reminds him of a paladin 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:29.319
 d2 but this is very strange taxes given 

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:31.719
 I don't remember anything about him 

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:34.690
 therefore it can only by appearance 

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:37.270
 reminds if in the end the top blizzards 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:39.039
 spent a lot of work on the bugs to their 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.590
 at the time of the release of the original was pretty 

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:44.229
 many in general the same benchmarks souls very 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:46.840
 similar to the lords of destruction was also 

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:48.520
 given up with the fifth act in which we killed 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:50.680
 someone already after being overwhelmed 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:53.050
 Dyabla is a bit strange but yes don't care 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:55.599
 there were new locations too 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:58.479
 Monsters and two new classes of heroes and then 

00:05:55.599 --> 00:06:00.520
 one did not finish though okay there is a mode 

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:02.050
 adventures so it is considered but worth it 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:05.080
 whether it is 40 euros or in our case 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:06.639
 900 rubles you decide diablo was 

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:08.770
 more interesting with more 

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:11.050
 high-level content so if you 

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:13.090
 love games of a similar genre, I think 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:15.009
 try it is shorter than tolerable 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:18.270
 meritorious addon to meritorious game 

00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:18.270
 such a verdi
