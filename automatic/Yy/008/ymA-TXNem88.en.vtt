00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.710
 there are always a lot of discussions 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.029

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.130
 do not think much and have a reason 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.160
 I consider myself as having thought 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:32.130

 to have carpenters 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.349
 besides, you need a lot 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.549

 the very first and useless of all 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:17.519
 Dragon Flitton is the river dragon

 You can not do anything with her 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:20.639

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:34.829
 she is for absolutely nothing good and it 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.019
 just good for selling or 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:40.049
 pick it up in case you really had it 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:41.040
 Sometime to start kite flutes 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:43.380

 to call the kites on a trip like that 

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:53.400
 or so would meet 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:55.799
 it does not mean it is special 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.359
 Meaningful these led to use 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:59.220
 to call kites because you are against 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:00.959
 dragon he can call with her like that 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.000
 or sooner or later in the game 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:05.040
 The dragons will humming 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.780
 flutes are mainly used to 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.849
 to continue to extract 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.280
 he implores himself after this 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:13.139
 once from the unidentifiable 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.079
 you have unpacked dragon fourth 

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:17.729
 Unzip them again 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:19.169
 rare things to get out of 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:20.519
 seal crusher shopping more expensive 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:22.229
 the probability of sealing boards 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:25.280
 Shopping to get powder because it's one 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:27.650
 very valuable vain is very small 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.270
 but it's worth everything you do 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.460
 So have a dragon flutes in there 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.990

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.600
 Seal boards shed powder is 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:37.310

 Call her flat with the buzzing kites 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.340

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:43.610
 the so-called eco met for the green 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:46.190
 the 5 and can be used around rare 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:48.950
 Bosses to call or with quite quite 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:50.270
 good luck even legendary kites now 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:52.370
 we come to the something interesting 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.710
 we catch with the blue at the 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:56.270
 blue dragon fourth is good for rare 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:59.240
 to call the legendary dragon 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:00.740
 she is a bit like the green one 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.140
 Dragon fourth only that percentage 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:05.450
 to be called by legendary dragons 

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:07.310
 can be much higher than at the 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:09.500
 green here I should mention 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.990
 that the blue and the songs are counting 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.370
 flutes that follow next 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.110
 You can be sealed when you look at it 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:18.350
 the unknown dragon 14 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:20.540
 this always means extracted if you 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:23.960
 try a sealed blue or 

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:25.850
 to open songs after one 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.680
 Shed powder asked a seal 

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:29.870
 criminals are shopping powder like you 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.790
 just said, from the buzzing 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:33.350
 kites can get flirt as 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:35.780
 next are the leather flutes 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:37.460
 again a flute is with all on and 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:40.100
 actually flirt pretty much identically 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.910
 they actually resemble the blue flutes 

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:43.900
 complete 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:46.070
 the only thing she got from others 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:49.039
 it is different that they are you 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:50.360
 guarantee a kite with ten slots 

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:52.520
 bring forth 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.810
 that means the dragon you with the 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.180
 league will call a kite led 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:57.650
 is guaranteed to have ten slots for 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:00.950
 skills that means he has the full 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:02.840
 Bandwidth available the kites the 

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:04.970
 calls always automatically fit yours 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:06.470
 level to that means no matter which 

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:08.270
 the player, the kite will never 

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:10.789
 harder and never easier too 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:12.380
 defeat but notice you would be the 

00:06:10.789 --> 00:06:14.390

 drive as ordinary kites only so on 

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:18.680

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:28.210
 that was it with my again
