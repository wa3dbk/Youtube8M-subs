00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 sconce night dear viewers with you again 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.279
 hero and today I will tell you 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:09.110
 about how to light 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:13.559
 locks with all sorts of lamps there 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:15.000
 floodlights and other utensils 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.650
 so let me start today 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.980
 the story of the simplest things 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.090
 for starters you can craft yourself 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.369
 special torch which is called 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.630
 cake only 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.789
 which glows much brighter 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.699
 usually the torch trick is that the mod 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.410
 cuts the brightness of ordinary torches for 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.510
 to have extra motivation 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.300
 use lighting that is 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.090
 here okay is not very easy to hold and 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.590
 special coal which is intended 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.430
 especially for torches that shares with 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.879
 using mamaiki 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.559
 coal or charcoal indifferent 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:49.410
 ignited it is pretty tricky we set 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.210
 somewhere this torch is like this 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.530
 this is how we use ordinary 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:58.800
 lighter on them note there is 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:03.690
 even such as to say quite myself 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:07.590
 realistic sound of course looks like 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.960
 ordinary torch well yes and still here 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.970
 candelabra j 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.920
 chandeliers to do with the bottom of the torches that we 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.560
 just showed ordinary dal 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.520
 pieces of fences and iron by their 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.500
 screwed as I understand not 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.820
 somewhere to the ceiling let's try 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.680
 worms do n't you wanna become flour 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.509
 I go further into the creative mode and 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.189
 let's take a quick look now 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:34.549
 some kind of ceiling cling and 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:37.560
 again fire firing 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:39.210
 how atmospheric is actually lighting 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.520
 gives exactly the same amount as normal 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.110
 block aglou stone that is how he 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.240
 called in the Russian translation of the hour 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.630
 I will tell my 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:51.630
 Now let's glowing stone 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.119
 turn on the day temporarily and I'll tell you in 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.460
 the fact that there are barrels of the barrel is crafted 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.399
 made of wood and iron and designed 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.680
 exclusively for storing different oils 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.619
 which is used to work these 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.250
 how is it called fixtures so here 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:10.170
 for this you take with you a bottle of 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.620
 lantern and right click 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.540
 there 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.870
 he is full of us naturally because I 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.700
 I carry 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.519
 she's in creative mode let's 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:23.870
 come out of creativity and put an empty 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:25.790
 the barrel actually gets the oil in there 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.879
 that you need to 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.739
 your lamp worked 64 minutes before and 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:33.049
 troubles by default all any many 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:35.659
 lights are working here and 16 minutes 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:37.700
 these lamps are called 

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:39.109
 candelabra and mom is not really 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.470
 called lantirn 

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:44.209
 rarely usually they load charging 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.670
 as follows rather uncomfortable 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:49.849
 to say no to this I need yours here 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:52.700
 this option take a bottle of oil oil 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:54.620
 crafted from common giraffe 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.930
 turn is recorded in the bank here 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.879
 so use this recipe 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.579
 to the bubble and two pieces of fat the same is done 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:03.189
 raw beef raw pork erica 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:06.379
 rating without a difference 

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:08.599
 then kill him charge 25 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:11.000
 percent by 50 percent by 75 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:14.540
 percent and that's the way you call in 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.099
 completely if you use the lobe there 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.280
 just take an empty one 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:21.230
 flashlight and right-click 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.609
 and it will fill up right there 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:27.169
 as you can see 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:28.849
 the way some interesting sound on this and 

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:33.310
 spheres of course fashion designers 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:38.090
 tried nothing you say awesome 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.629
 Well, then everything is as usual for make 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.840
 somewhere 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:45.769
 this lamp on the floor and if 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:48.109
 turn it on with fire and just the same you 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:53.260
 turn on then you can take with you 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:56.150
 hand and something he doesn't want to climb a 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:59.180
 remembered everything he's really going 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:02.659
 much easier to light and clamp the button 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.639
 shift and right kick everything looks good 

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:07.699
 take a look 

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:10.459
 awesomely just crafting this flashlight 

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:12.590
 so no we need this one 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:15.560
 flashlight from two pieces of glass 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:18.590
 3 iron bars with gold and 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:20.239
 still here are two more pieces of iron stick and 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:25.360
 ordinary thread is very honest 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:25.360
 pretty cheap which is awesome 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:34.430
 awesome still in theory this lamp 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:37.220
 can be screwed to walls and ceilings 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:39.130
 but de facto guys it works only from 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:42.380
 wood for some unknown reason 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:44.389
 further he has but let's say more 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:47.750
 weak versions of it are some 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:50.180
 candle on a saucer crafting valuable of three 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:54.440
 pieces of iron give me a suitable 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:56.900
 I light a candle here here it means Kraft 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:59.810
 she is three pieces of iron like that 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:02.210
 a bit of fat and sticks 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:04.100
 nothing special work she was always you 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:06.800
 meets other lamps which 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:09.590
 work 16 minutes if they are completely 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:13.040
 16 minutes of real time are charged at 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:15.380
 it works it is activated just 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:17.630
 f button provided you have 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:19.840
 the inventory has a flint also its just 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:22.250
 you can put on the ground and click 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.590
 lighter whatever you see 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:26.960
 dynamic light i have no lags 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:28.910
 observed in this case that it is better not 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.470
 well because there used to be such a mod 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:33.440
 on dynamic lighting was he 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:36.050
 rather varnish than lighting is pretty 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:39.050
 weak in full swing but free and 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:41.870
 practically and cheap and still there 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:44.150
 quite yourself are real lanterns which 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:46.039
 charged oddly from battery to 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:48.410
 battery kravts and he use iron 

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:50.270
 common redstone repeaters and 

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:53.750
 ration torch oil how expensive 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:55.160
 lamp itself and paint and iron here 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:57.560
 this stick is this lever 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:59.180
 glass panel special light bulb 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.820
 which is not used at all 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.900
 like this is just an ingredient for 

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:04.760
 variety of recipes in this fashion 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:07.070
 which is done turn of three 

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:08.930
 pieces of glass to play hand and iron 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:10.850
 nothing fancy on it should be 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:13.070
 charge for this we put it so 

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:15.440
 way and put the bunting we get immediately 

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:17.630
 one hundred percent testament to 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.389
 activate click f let's 

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:26.510
 I 'll look at myself from the side 

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:30.650
 turn on the night and activate it in poppy 

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:32.240
 now oh my god it is a pleasure with 

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:33.729
 such a light bulb to walk in the dungeons 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:38.770
 who is there to kill 

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:41.529
 light well or just get scared just 

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:42.430
 Well, well , you can also have this lantern 

00:06:41.529 --> 00:06:44.680
 used in the manufacture 

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:46.240
 special miner 

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.009
 we walked mika who wears on 

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:50.110
 which is just charging 

00:06:48.009 --> 00:06:52.409
 batteries as far as we understand and accurately 

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:54.939
 also activated on bukaev 

00:06:52.409 --> 00:06:56.680
 let us empty-handed will include 

00:06:54.939 --> 00:06:58.389
 it works just like 

00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:00.879
 light only over longer 

00:06:58.389 --> 00:07:03.189
 distance and gives a little bit more precisely 

00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:05.499
 one and a half shirts about how to say protection 

00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:07.779
 that's all guys all so perhaps 

00:07:05.499 --> 00:07:09.729
 the most comfortable the coolest thing and 

00:07:07.779 --> 00:07:11.979
 which is in this u not in my 

00:07:09.729 --> 00:07:13.659
 fights for watching and this is all expensive 

00:07:11.979 --> 00:07:16.120
