00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:15.070
 this video of a boxing from audio 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:19.789
 installation of this set that is the people 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:21.890
 microsoft flight chat the x 3000 test 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:24.320
 audio is all the sound that you 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:27.140
 listen since this video is pre 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.690
 recorded and I'm using in these 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.740
 moments the headset and the microphone for 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:32.740
 record this video 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.949
 and continuing with the unboxing first thing 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.410
 What we have to do is take away the 

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:43.290
 three stamps that come in the part 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.180
 back of the box 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.990
 as we can see in the back 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.660
 comes what is the quick guide for 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:54.960
 remove the cover as we can see 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.420
 first instance are the bosses and 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.680
 we also have to remove the cover 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.680
 Where are these jets coming from? 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.950
 as we can see in the part 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.530
 left of the creset that is where it comes 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.210
 the microphone and has a part that 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.740
 microsoft 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.740
 just like the right side 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.230
 these people have the usb 2.0 entry 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.670
 and it also has a sound driver 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.130
 that has a button to upload or download 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.130
 volume and mute the microphone 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.640
 this package also has a guide 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.640
 fast and guarantee 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.259
 as we can see the aesthetics of this 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:56.189
 exercise is very good since to me 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:58.830
 Apparently they are very pretty good we 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.190
 finished the unboxing and we started with the 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.650
 driver installation 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:06.520
 good to install the drivers we have 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:09.030
 what to search in google microsoft live chat 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.670
 lx 3000 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.920
 and we open the second option that is not 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.110
 for that since it is the official page of 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.270
 Microsoft chooses in its operating system 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:22.030
 and download the driver 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:24.940
 and as we see here we are already installing 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.220
 what are the files and the 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.790
 driver of this network 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:33.180
 we wait behind fiscal 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:36.870
 once installed in the drivers we 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:40.319
 this window appears in this we have to 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:43.200
 connect the headset to the usb port of the 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:45.989
 computer and how you see on this page 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.359
 we get the button for calls from 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:52.109
 good voice in these new models this 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:54.299
 button no longer includes it good here I already 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:56.700
 I start to open the skype to do the 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:03:00.150
 test call and configure all the 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:02.250
 chrono and all that on the screen are 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.920
