larger chunks here and bring it down to

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.850 
larger chunks here and bring it down to
uniform<00:02:27.850> size<00:02:28.330> this<00:02:29.290> will<00:02:29.530> aid<00:02:29.680> in<00:02:29.709> the

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
uniform size this will aid in the

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.570 
uniform size this will aid in the
dehydrating<00:02:30.580> process<00:02:32.070> next<00:02:33.070> you<00:02:33.340> want<00:02:33.520> to

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
dehydrating process next you want to

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.550 
dehydrating process next you want to
sift<00:02:33.880> one<00:02:34.530> tablespoon<00:02:35.530> of<00:02:35.830> cornstarch<00:02:36.430> and

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.520 

this<00:02:47.970> is<00:02:48.120> gonna<00:02:48.300> help<00:02:48.540> thicken<00:02:48.930> our<00:02:49.290> sauce

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
this is gonna help thicken our sauce

00:02:49.530 --> 00:03:03.699 
this is gonna help thicken our sauce
making<00:02:50.010> a<00:02:50.220> gravy<00:02:51.680> salt<00:02:52.680> and<00:02:52.860> pepper<00:02:53.099> to<00:02:53.430> taste

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709

so<00:03:04.709> at<00:03:04.860> this<00:03:05.040> point<00:03:05.340> it<00:03:05.459> gets<00:03:05.640> thick<00:03:05.970> enough

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
so at this point it gets thick enough

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.520 
so at this point it gets thick enough
that<00:03:06.330> you<00:03:06.420> can<00:03:06.540> see<00:03:06.690> the<00:03:06.810> bottom<00:03:07.140> of<00:03:07.230> the<00:03:07.319> pan
