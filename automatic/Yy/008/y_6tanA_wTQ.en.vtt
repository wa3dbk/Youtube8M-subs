00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.740 
and I'm going to select edit in and then
choose<00:00:55.710> open<00:00:55.949> as<00:00:56.370> layers<00:00:56.550> in<00:00:56.879> Photoshop<00:00:57.390> and

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
choose open as layers in Photoshop and

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.049 
choose open as layers in Photoshop and
this<00:00:58.379> is<00:00:58.590> probably<00:00:59.039> going<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.250> take<00:00:59.520> a<00:00:59.550> second

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
this is probably going to take a second

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.240 
this is probably going to take a second
so<00:01:00.239> we'll<00:01:00.390> just<00:01:00.570> sit<00:01:01.199> here<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:01.500> be<00:01:01.559> patient<00:01:01.859> as

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
so we'll just sit here and be patient as

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.450 
so we'll just sit here and be patient as
it<00:01:02.399> opens<00:01:02.820> because<00:01:03.090> it<00:01:03.210> has<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.719> open<00:01:04.460> every

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
it opens because it has to open every

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.179 
it opens because it has to open every
single<00:01:05.790> I'm<00:01:06.479> just<00:01:06.750> okay<00:01:06.990> so<00:01:07.170> this<00:01:07.500> is<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.920> this

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
single I'm just okay so this is the this

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.620 
single I'm just okay so this is the this
version<00:01:08.400> of<00:01:08.549> Lightroom<00:01:08.700> may<00:01:09.060> require<00:01:09.450> the

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
version of Lightroom may require the

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.210 
version of Lightroom may require the
Photoshop<00:01:10.049> Camera<00:01:10.380> Raw<00:01:10.439> plugin<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.100> I

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
Photoshop Camera Raw plugin and I

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.410 
Photoshop Camera Raw plugin and I
haven't<00:01:11.460> had<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.610> problem<00:01:11.909> so<00:01:12.180> I'm<00:01:12.270> just

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
haven't had a problem so I'm just

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.410 
haven't had a problem so I'm just
clicking<00:01:12.659> open<00:01:13.080> anyway<00:01:16.939> so<00:01:17.939> it's<00:01:18.060> gonna<00:01:18.150> take

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
clicking open anyway so it's gonna take

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.600 
clicking open anyway so it's gonna take
a<00:01:18.479> while<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:18.810> open<00:01:19.049> in<00:01:19.590> Photoshop<00:01:20.189> because<00:01:20.490> it

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
a while to open in Photoshop because it

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.520 
a while to open in Photoshop because it
has<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:20.880> open<00:01:21.030> each<00:01:21.479> individual<00:01:22.729> photo<00:01:23.729> as<00:01:24.330> a

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
has to open each individual photo as a

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.030 
has to open each individual photo as a
layer<00:01:25.530> so<00:01:26.250> this<00:01:26.400> is<00:01:26.549> going<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:26.759> take<00:01:27.060> some<00:01:27.659> time

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 
layer so this is going to take some time

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.100 
layer so this is going to take some time
but<00:01:29.040> if<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:29.490> don't<00:01:29.790> have<00:01:30.060> Photoshop<00:01:30.450> or

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
but if you don't have Photoshop or

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.920 
but if you don't have Photoshop or
Lightroom<00:01:31.250> then<00:01:32.250> I<00:01:32.460> highly<00:01:32.970> recommend<00:01:33.000> your

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
Lightroom then I highly recommend your

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.550 
Lightroom then I highly recommend your
go<00:01:34.470> into<00:01:34.740> Adobe<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.610> you<00:01:36.390> can<00:01:36.630> download<00:01:36.900> a

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
go into Adobe and you can download a

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.880 
go into Adobe and you can download a
trial<00:01:37.979> version<00:01:38.100> for<00:01:38.610> 30<00:01:38.820> days<00:01:39.030> I<00:01:39.329> think<00:01:39.890> but

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
trial version for 30 days I think but

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.620 
trial version for 30 days I think but
they<00:01:41.130> do<00:01:41.189> I<00:01:41.310> think<00:01:41.610> it's<00:01:41.880> very<00:01:42.060> reasonable<00:01:42.390> I

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
they do I think it's very reasonable I

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.859 
they do I think it's very reasonable I
think<00:01:42.659> it's<00:01:42.899> like<00:01:42.990> $9.99<00:01:43.710> a<00:01:43.740> month<00:01:44.119> to<00:01:45.119> use<00:01:45.659> it

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
think it's like $9.99 a month to use it

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.020 
think it's like $9.99 a month to use it
and<00:01:46.200> it's<00:01:46.500> I<00:01:46.829> use<00:01:47.189> it<00:01:47.310> all<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.549> time<00:01:47.850> I

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
and it's I use it all the time I

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.700 
and it's I use it all the time I
couldn't<00:01:48.420> live<00:01:48.689> without<00:01:48.899> Lightroom<00:01:49.500> or

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
couldn't live without Lightroom or

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.880 
couldn't live without Lightroom or
Photoshop<00:01:50.780> so<00:01:51.780> if<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:52.680> don't<00:01:52.860> have<00:01:53.130> it<00:01:53.340> then

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
Photoshop so if you don't have it then

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.260 
Photoshop so if you don't have it then
go<00:01:55.890> at<00:01:56.070> least<00:01:56.219> download<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:56.670> trial<00:01:56.969> and<00:01:57.149> you'll

almost done so you can see it flashing

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.070 
almost done so you can see it flashing
over<00:02:10.020> to<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.229> right

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
and you can kind of see how many layers

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:25.010 
and you can kind of see how many layers
there<00:02:15.270> are<00:02:23.120> there<00:02:24.120> should<00:02:24.300> only<00:02:24.330> be<00:02:24.570> just<00:02:24.900> a

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
frame animation and it pulls in the

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.310 
frame animation and it pulls in the
first<00:03:25.730> frame<00:03:26.060> but<00:03:26.300> obviously<00:03:26.750> we<00:03:26.960> want<00:03:27.140> all

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.320

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.200 
the frames so I'm gonna say make choose
make<00:03:30.470> I'm<00:03:30.680> gonna<00:03:30.830> come<00:03:31.070> back<00:03:31.280> over<00:03:31.580> here<00:03:31.760> to

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:32.210 
make I'm gonna come back over here to

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:34.750 
make I'm gonna come back over here to
the<00:03:32.330> corner<00:03:32.630> and<00:03:32.930> choose<00:03:33.680> make<00:03:33.980> frames<00:03:34.400> from

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
the corner and choose make frames from

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.420 
the corner and choose make frames from
layers<00:03:34.900> and<00:03:35.900> then<00:03:36.170> that<00:03:36.350> will<00:03:36.500> add<00:03:36.620> in<00:03:36.830> all<00:03:37.040> of

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
layers and then that will add in all of

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.700 
layers and then that will add in all of
the<00:03:37.550> layers<00:03:37.760> but<00:03:38.630> then<00:03:38.750> we<00:03:38.870> have<00:03:38.960> a<00:03:38.990> problem

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:39.710 
the layers but then we have a problem

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:41.230 
the layers but then we have a problem
because<00:03:40.100> it's<00:03:40.280> gonna<00:03:40.370> get<00:03:40.580> if<00:03:40.700> we<00:03:40.820> make<00:03:41.030> our

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:41.240 
because it's gonna get if we make our

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:46.270 
because it's gonna get if we make our
jiff<00:03:42.470> from<00:03:42.860> this<00:03:43.630> set<00:03:44.630> up<00:03:44.810> our<00:03:45.290> frames<00:03:46.130> are

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
jiff from this set up our frames are

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.920 
jiff from this set up our frames are
going<00:03:46.310> to<00:03:46.460> be<00:03:46.550> backwards<00:03:47.120> which<00:03:47.510> we<00:03:47.750> do<00:03:47.900> not

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
going to be backwards which we do not

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.690 
going to be backwards which we do not
want<00:03:48.080> so<00:03:48.590> we're<00:03:48.680> going<00:03:48.830> to<00:03:48.890> come<00:03:49.070> in<00:03:49.190> here<00:03:49.520> and

want so we're going to come in here and
we're<00:03:50.390> going<00:03:50.600> to<00:03:50.780> reverse<00:03:51.230> frames<00:03:52.100> and<00:03:53.090> that

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:53.300 
we're going to reverse frames and that

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:54.850 
we're going to reverse frames and that
will<00:03:53.510> get<00:03:53.600> us<00:03:53.780> all<00:03:53.990> the<00:03:54.350> frames<00:03:54.590> in<00:03:54.800> the

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
will get us all the frames in the

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.610 
will get us all the frames in the
correct<00:03:55.100> order<00:03:55.310> so<00:03:56.240> now<00:03:56.270> I<00:03:56.600> want<00:03:57.320> to<00:03:57.380> select

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.600 
down here and set how long I want each
image<00:04:02.690> to<00:04:02.900> show<00:04:02.930> I<00:04:03.380> found<00:04:04.040> that<00:04:04.130> a<00:04:04.190> half<00:04:04.490> a
