last<00:00:00.659> year<00:00:00.870> was<00:00:01.020> such<00:00:01.620> a<00:00:01.650> success<00:00:02.129> we<00:00:02.340> were

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490 
last year was such a success we were

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.190 
last year was such a success we were
very<00:00:02.610> proud<00:00:02.879> of<00:00:03.060> that<00:00:03.179> we<00:00:03.389> knew<00:00:03.570> that<00:00:03.840> we'd

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
very proud of that we knew that we'd

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.690 
very proud of that we knew that we'd
sort<00:00:04.410> of<00:00:04.470> set<00:00:04.650> the<00:00:04.680> bar<00:00:04.950> at<00:00:05.069> a<00:00:05.130> new<00:00:05.279> level<00:00:05.460> of

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
sort of set the bar at a new level of

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.660 
sort of set the bar at a new level of
creating<00:00:06.089> such<00:00:06.899> an<00:00:07.080> iconic<00:00:07.770> identifiable

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
creating such an iconic identifiable

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.000 
creating such an iconic identifiable
product<00:00:09.090> it's<00:00:09.929> really<00:00:10.230> interesting<00:00:10.469> how

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
product it's really interesting how

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.400 
product it's really interesting how
we've<00:00:11.309> had<00:00:11.790> to<00:00:11.940> take<00:00:12.120> something<00:00:12.660> that<00:00:13.230> was

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
we've had to take something that was

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.709 
we've had to take something that was
actually<00:00:13.620> quite<00:00:14.099> good<00:00:14.429> and<00:00:14.639> think<00:00:15.210> about<00:00:15.480> how

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
actually quite good and think about how

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.730 
actually quite good and think about how
we<00:00:15.780> can<00:00:16.049> take<00:00:16.619> that<00:00:16.830> to<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:17.100> next<00:00:17.220> level<00:00:18.740> in

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
we can take that to the next level in

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.040 
we can take that to the next level in
seven<00:00:20.100> did<00:00:20.340> a<00:00:20.369> such<00:00:20.760> a<00:00:20.789> good<00:00:21.090> job<00:00:21.390> everybody

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
seven did a such a good job everybody

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.279 
seven did a such a good job everybody
says<00:00:22.500> a<00:00:22.650> faceful<00:00:23.010> in<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.580> war<00:00:23.820> so<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:24.869> m8<00:00:25.140> I

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
says a faceful in the war so the m8 I

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.470 
says a faceful in the war so the m8 I
think<00:00:25.500> is<00:00:25.619> kind<00:00:25.830> of<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:26.010> epitome<00:00:26.250> of<00:00:26.519> a<00:00:26.939> lot<00:00:27.449> of

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
think is kind of the epitome of a lot of

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.210 
think is kind of the epitome of a lot of
the<00:00:27.630> design<00:00:27.930> principles<00:00:28.170> that<00:00:28.710> we<00:00:28.890> have<00:00:29.070> been

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
the design principles that we have been

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.220 
the design principles that we have been
working<00:00:29.550> with<00:00:29.699> over<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:30.029> last<00:00:30.269> decade<00:00:30.900> from

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.500 
the beginning we starting follow-on this
material<00:00:34.320> is<00:00:34.559> I<00:00:34.770> concept<00:00:35.280> how<00:00:35.610> we<00:00:35.880> can<00:00:36.059> magma

in improv at next level we definitely

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.549 
in improv at next level we definitely
wanted<00:00:39.239> to<00:00:39.390> keep<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.750> same<00:00:39.930> spirit<00:00:40.440> of<00:00:40.500> the

team we come off a phrasing idea to them

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.859 
team we come off a phrasing idea to them
they<00:01:05.100> feel<00:01:05.250> what<00:01:05.790> are<00:01:06.000> you<00:01:06.090> guys<00:01:06.360> thinking

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
they feel what are you guys thinking

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.700 
they feel what are you guys thinking
it's<00:01:07.140> impossible<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.880> Skiba<00:01:09.180> try<00:01:09.560> but<00:01:10.560> it's

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
it's impossible the Skiba try but it's

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.800 
it's impossible the Skiba try but it's
that<00:01:10.860> sort<00:01:11.070> of<00:01:11.159> belief<00:01:11.490> in<00:01:11.909> doing<00:01:12.540> what<00:01:12.689> we

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
that sort of belief in doing what we

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.289 
that sort of belief in doing what we
think<00:01:12.960> is<00:01:13.110> right<00:01:13.290> that<00:01:13.710> drivers<00:01:14.340> we<00:01:14.909> were<00:01:15.030> able

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
think is right that drivers we were able

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.210 
think is right that drivers we were able
to<00:01:15.330> make<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:15.840> product<00:01:16.350> that's<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.650> bigger<00:01:16.830> screen

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
to make a product that's a bigger screen

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.890 
to make a product that's a bigger screen
but<00:01:17.610> that<00:01:17.640> doesn't<00:01:18.060> feel<00:01:18.210> substantially

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
but that doesn't feel substantially

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.719 
but that doesn't feel substantially

likes the way we have a curved back we

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.590 
likes the way we have a curved back we
took<00:01:23.009> that<00:01:23.220> metal<00:01:23.610> housing<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:24.270> we<00:01:24.390> were<00:01:24.479> able

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
took that metal housing and we were able

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.390 
took that metal housing and we were able
to<00:01:24.840> wrap<00:01:25.020> it<00:01:25.200> all<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.439> way<00:01:25.590> up<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.100> screen

just go the genuine authenticity of

what<00:01:39.330> seems<00:01:39.690> small<00:01:40.440> gains<00:01:40.770> is<00:01:41.220> actually<00:01:41.730> an

what seems small gains is actually an

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.720 
what seems small gains is actually an

extreme amount of work in the corners

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.090 
extreme amount of work in the corners
and<00:01:44.940> how<00:01:45.180> that<00:01:45.360> finishes<00:01:45.900> with<00:01:46.080> just<00:01:46.410> perfect
