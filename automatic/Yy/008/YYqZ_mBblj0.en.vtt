00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.470 

it's<00:00:47.559> okay<00:00:47.860> a<00:00:47.890> green<00:00:48.280> light<00:00:48.489> which<00:00:48.940> means<00:00:49.180> go

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:49.480 
it's okay a green light which means go

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.640 
it's okay a green light which means go
this<00:00:49.690> way<00:00:50.339> go<00:00:51.339> this<00:00:51.699> way<00:00:52.260> there's<00:00:53.260> a<00:00:53.350> flashing

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:53.650 
this way go this way there's a flashing

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.479 
this way go this way there's a flashing
line<00:00:54.040> car<00:00:54.370> I<00:00:55.379> can<00:00:56.379> push<00:00:56.589> physics<00:00:57.040> objects

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:57.489 
line car I can push physics objects

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:04.200 
line car I can push physics objects
through<00:00:57.729> the<00:00:57.760> world<00:00:59.280> it's<00:01:00.280> this<00:01:00.489> fun<00:01:03.210> go

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
through the world it's this fun go

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:13.070 
through the world it's this fun go
steady<00:01:06.570> you<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:10.630> you<00:01:10.870> good<00:01:11.860> bye

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
steady you and you good bye

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:24.360 
steady you and you good bye
it's<00:01:14.080> lighter<00:01:15.210> science

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:24.370 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.680 

so<00:01:25.370> you'd<00:01:25.490> have<00:01:25.520> to<00:01:25.760> get<00:01:25.910> in<00:01:25.970> and<00:01:26.300> pull<00:01:26.540> the

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:26.690 
so you'd have to get in and pull the

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:35.560 
so you'd have to get in and pull the
lever<00:01:27.370> lever<00:01:28.370> or<00:01:28.910> never<00:01:29.860> well<00:01:30.860> they<00:01:34.420> are<00:01:35.420> you

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
lever lever or never well they are you

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.080 
lever lever or never well they are you
there's<00:01:36.170> the<00:01:36.350> jump<00:01:36.560> sound<00:01:36.800> again<00:01:37.010> who'd<00:01:37.220> hey

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
there's the jump sound again who'd hey

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:44.710 
there's the jump sound again who'd hey
Daniel<00:01:38.630> Sonny<00:01:39.880> okay<00:01:41.560> point<00:01:42.560> save<00:01:43.570> that's<00:01:44.570> some

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
Daniel Sonny okay point save that's some

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.100 
Daniel Sonny okay point save that's some
gas<00:01:44.960> we<00:01:45.380> usually<00:01:45.680> keep<00:01:45.830> gas<00:01:46.070> in<00:01:46.250> the<00:01:46.340> mines

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
gas we usually keep gas in the mines

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:53.170 
gas we usually keep gas in the mines
it's<00:01:48.110> the<00:01:48.410> only<00:01:48.530> place<00:01:48.800> keep<00:01:49.580> it<00:01:51.850> no<00:01:52.850> there's<00:01:53.119> a

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
done with a few more jumps I was Jesus

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.810 
done with a few more jumps I was Jesus
Christ<00:02:43.960> a<00:02:44.350> cruel<00:02:44.890> blow<00:02:45.040> would<00:02:45.310> come<00:02:45.550> in<00:02:45.670> handy

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
ah broken mine you must be occurred

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:21.060 
ah broken mine you must be occurred
somewhere<00:03:17.880> we<00:03:18.880> go<00:03:19.620> where's<00:03:20.620> your<00:03:20.830> round

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
somewhere we go where's your round

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:27.020 
somewhere we go where's your round
where's<00:03:21.700> your<00:03:21.910> round<00:03:22.150> when<00:03:22.300> you<00:03:22.360> need<00:03:22.510> him

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:36.170 

oh<00:03:27.500> let's<00:03:28.500> push<00:03:28.710> it<00:03:28.740> this<00:03:28.950> way<00:03:32.300> okay<00:03:34.790> John<00:03:35.790> get

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
oh let's push it this way okay John get

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.030 
oh let's push it this way okay John get
in<00:03:36.330> that<00:03:36.570> I<00:03:36.780> need<00:03:37.260> to<00:03:37.320> climb<00:03:37.470> on<00:03:37.620> the<00:03:37.680> rock<00:03:38.690> okay

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
in that I need to climb on the rock okay

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.990 
in that I need to climb on the rock okay
that's<00:03:41.040> not<00:03:41.160> really<00:03:41.430> giving<00:03:41.610> me<00:03:41.640> much<00:03:41.850> of<00:03:41.880> a

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
that's not really giving me much of a

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.030 
that's not really giving me much of a
run<00:03:42.240> up<00:03:42.330> for<00:03:42.510> this<00:03:42.570> jump<00:03:42.780> here<00:03:42.930> we<00:03:43.170> go<00:03:43.260> let's

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
run up for this jump here we go let's

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.680 
run up for this jump here we go let's
see<00:03:44.250> if<00:03:44.370> it<00:03:44.459> works<00:03:44.700> I<00:03:45.060> have<00:03:45.209> a<00:03:45.270> feeling<00:03:45.570> it

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
see if it works I have a feeling it

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.820 
see if it works I have a feeling it
might<00:03:46.640> there<00:03:47.640> we<00:03:47.790> go

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
might there we go

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:53.480 
might there we go
it's<00:03:49.830> very<00:03:50.070> slow<00:03:51.260> slow<00:03:52.260> there's<00:03:53.070> no<00:03:53.310> way<00:03:53.459> I

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:53.490 
it's very slow slow there's no way I

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:58.190 
it's very slow slow there's no way I
made<00:03:53.700> that<00:03:53.820> jump<00:03:54.350> physics<00:03:55.350> denies<00:03:55.800> it<00:03:57.020> here<00:03:58.020> we

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
made that jump physics denies it here we

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.199 
made that jump physics denies it here we
go<00:03:58.410> it's<00:03:59.010> one<00:03:59.220> of<00:03:59.250> us<00:03:59.459> and<00:03:59.610> things<00:03:59.820> ooh<00:04:00.000> let<00:04:00.180> me
