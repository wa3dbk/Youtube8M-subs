going down to the shops it's still hard

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.500 
going down to the shops it's still hard
in<00:01:29.440> whatever<00:01:29.740> context<00:01:30.490> cuz<00:01:30.700> you<00:01:31.330> know<00:01:31.450> you

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:31.510 
in whatever context cuz you know you

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.390 
in whatever context cuz you know you
want<00:01:31.810> to<00:01:31.870> know<00:01:31.960> every<00:01:32.410> move<00:01:32.440> they<00:01:32.830> make<00:01:32.860> every

want to know every move they make every

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.970 
want to know every move they make every
thought<00:01:33.670> everything<00:01:34.150> really<00:01:34.660> so<00:01:35.170> when<00:01:35.830> you're

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:35.980 
thought everything really so when you're

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:37.590 
thought everything really so when you're
away<00:01:36.100> from<00:01:36.160> your<00:01:36.310> children<00:01:36.580> it's<00:01:37.060> really

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
away from your children it's really

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.360 
away from your children it's really
really<00:01:37.810> difficult<00:01:37.930> and<00:01:38.560> i<00:01:38.830> think<00:01:39.070> that

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:39.370 
really difficult and i think that

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.400 
really difficult and i think that
there's<00:01:40.090> there's<00:01:40.450> no<00:01:40.570> way<00:01:40.810> of<00:01:40.960> making<00:01:41.290> it

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:41.410 
there's there's no way of making it

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.020 
there's there's no way of making it
easier<00:01:41.740> but<00:01:42.010> i<00:01:42.130> don't<00:01:42.550> care<00:01:42.730> what<00:01:42.760> anybody

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
easier but i don't care what anybody

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.480 
easier but i don't care what anybody
else<00:01:43.240> says<00:01:43.420> it's<00:01:43.960> just<00:01:44.290> it's<00:01:44.680> very<00:01:44.950> very<00:01:45.220> hard

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
else says it's just it's very very hard

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.540 
else says it's just it's very very hard
i<00:01:45.820> think<00:01:46.540> the<00:01:46.960> only<00:01:46.990> thing<00:01:47.590> that<00:01:47.920> does<00:01:48.130> help<00:01:48.340> is

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.550 
i think the only thing that does help is

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:09.960 
good way I think it's actually just

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.680 
good way I think it's actually just
making<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.649> shopping<00:02:11.070> the<00:02:11.190> event<00:02:11.490> itself<00:02:11.700> so

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
making the shopping the event itself so

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.480 
making the shopping the event itself so
rather<00:02:12.870> than<00:02:13.080> you<00:02:13.230> looking<00:02:13.560> at<00:02:13.710> let's<00:02:14.280> get<00:02:14.430> the

rather than you looking at let's get the
shopping<00:02:14.700> out<00:02:14.880> the<00:02:15.000> way<00:02:15.090> then<00:02:15.300> we<00:02:15.330> can<00:02:15.420> get<00:02:15.660> to

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
shopping out the way then we can get to

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.410
