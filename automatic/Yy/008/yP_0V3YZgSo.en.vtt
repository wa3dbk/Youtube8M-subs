only I think we should expect a very

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.170 
only I think we should expect a very
close<00:00:46.020> game<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.379> these<00:00:47.250> sides<00:00:47.550> of<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:47.820> habit<00:00:48.059> of

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
close game and these sides of a habit of

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.479 
close game and these sides of a habit of
well<00:00:48.750> I<00:00:49.020> say<00:00:49.620> that<00:00:49.860> but<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.070> last<00:00:50.219> time<00:00:50.370> these

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489

two sides met it was a for Neil Walker
espanol<00:00:53.219> I<00:00:53.430> think<00:00:54.059> that<00:00:54.180> game<00:00:54.420> was<00:00:54.600> just<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:54.809> bit

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
espanol I think that game was just a bit

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.470 
espanol I think that game was just a bit
of<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:55.170> hiccup<00:00:56.039> in<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.640> normal<00:00:57.059> order<00:00:57.180> of

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
of a hiccup in the normal order of

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.779 
of a hiccup in the normal order of
things<00:00:57.690> two<00:00:58.469> games<00:00:58.710> for<00:00:58.800> that<00:00:59.100> both<00:00:59.399> ended

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
even okay so you say you're thinking a

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.679 
even okay so you say you're thinking a

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
3 or draw both times so it's not a very

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.890 
3 or draw both times so it's not a very
good<00:01:26.460> indicator<00:01:27.119> as<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.479> sort<00:01:27.659> of<00:01:27.689> how<00:01:27.840> many

goals we could expect in this and then I

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.690 
goals we could expect in this and then I
was<00:01:30.030> looking<00:01:30.329> at<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.960> odds<00:01:31.259> market<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.310> over

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
was looking at the odds market the over

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.340 
was looking at the odds market the over
two<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:32.970> a<00:01:33.060> half<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.869> under<00:01:34.079> two<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.229> a

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
two and a half and the under two and a

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.109 
two and a half and the under two and a
half<00:01:34.500> is<00:01:34.650> actually<00:01:35.040> both<00:01:35.159> price<00:01:35.400> at<00:01:35.640> one<00:01:35.880> point

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
half is actually both price at one point

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.270 
half is actually both price at one point
nine<00:01:36.299> so<00:01:37.200> you're<00:01:37.530> saying<00:01:37.560> you<00:01:37.890> go<00:01:38.009> for<00:01:38.250> the

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
nine so you're saying you go for the

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.520 
nine so you're saying you go for the
draw<00:01:38.610> but<00:01:39.180> you<00:01:39.329> know<00:01:39.450> what<00:01:40.049> kind<00:01:40.290> of<00:01:40.350> goals

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
draw but you know what kind of goals

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.140 
draw but you know what kind of goals
could<00:01:40.860> we<00:01:40.979> expect<00:01:41.100> here<00:01:41.640> or<00:01:41.729> is<00:01:41.790> this<00:01:41.880> a<00:01:41.939> bit

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
could we expect here or is this a bit

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.469 
could we expect here or is this a bit
maybe<00:01:42.299> you'd<00:01:42.810> give<00:01:43.049> a<00:01:43.079> miss<00:01:44.090> well<00:01:45.090> it's<00:01:45.210> a<00:01:45.299> very

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
maybe you'd give a miss well it's a very

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.060 
maybe you'd give a miss well it's a very
tricky<00:01:45.659> one<00:01:45.960> bettin<00:01:46.259> on<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.409> exact<00:01:46.710> number<00:01:47.009> of

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
tricky one bettin on the exact number of

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.800 
tricky one bettin on the exact number of
girls<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.700> it's<00:01:47.939> coming<00:01:48.119> even<00:01:48.540> number<00:01:48.780> of

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
girls and it's coming even number of

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.780 
girls and it's coming even number of
girls<00:01:49.049> unless<00:01:49.560> it's<00:01:49.710> gonna<00:01:49.860> be<00:01:49.920> nil<00:01:50.100> nil<00:01:50.280> but<00:01:50.700> I

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
girls unless it's gonna be nil nil but I

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:51.859 
girls unless it's gonna be nil nil but I
think<00:01:50.939> if<00:01:51.000> you're<00:01:51.119> looking<00:01:51.360> back<00:01:51.509> at<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.720> last

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
think if you're looking back at the last

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.899 
think if you're looking back at the last
five<00:01:52.170> games<00:01:52.470> between<00:01:52.829> these<00:01:53.159> two<00:01:53.310> sides<00:01:53.610> and

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
five games between these two sides and

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.670 
five games between these two sides and
there's<00:01:54.570> only<00:01:54.630> been<00:01:54.810> one<00:01:54.869> clean<00:01:55.409> sheet<00:01:55.619> in

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
there's only been one clean sheet in

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.560 
there's only been one clean sheet in
that<00:01:55.890> bunch<00:01:56.130> and<00:01:56.310> that<00:01:56.430> was<00:01:56.520> at<00:01:56.610> four<00:01:56.850> nil<00:01:57.060> I<00:01:57.240> I

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
that bunch and that was at four nil I I

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.420 
that bunch and that was at four nil I I
think<00:01:58.020> we<00:01:58.110> will<00:01:58.259> see<00:01:58.500> girls<00:01:58.829> I<00:01:59.070> think<00:01:59.100> it<00:01:59.340> will

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
think we will see girls I think it will

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.429 
think we will see girls I think it will
be<00:01:59.520> an<00:01:59.610> even<00:01:59.820> number<00:02:00.240> of<00:02:00.299> girls<00:02:00.570> I'd<00:02:01.079> stay<00:02:01.409> away

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
be an even number of girls I'd stay away

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.800 
be an even number of girls I'd stay away
from<00:02:01.649> 33<00:02:02.399> I've<00:02:02.579> done<00:02:02.759> either<00:02:03.060> side<00:02:03.420> of<00:02:03.450> course

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
from 33 I've done either side of course

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.200 
from 33 I've done either side of course
and<00:02:04.079> that<00:02:04.920> many<00:02:05.159> strikes<00:02:05.490> in<00:02:05.670> them<00:02:05.820> this<00:02:05.939> time

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
and that many strikes in them this time

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.229 
and that many strikes in them this time
even<00:02:07.170> though<00:02:07.320> 33<00:02:08.009> for<00:02:08.220> a<00:02:08.280> draw<00:02:08.489> is<00:02:08.759> that<00:02:08.879> a<00:02:08.970> mass

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
even though 33 for a draw is that a mass

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.570 
even though 33 for a draw is that a mass
of<00:02:09.270> M<00:02:09.660> goes<00:02:10.500> even<00:02:10.770> as<00:02:10.860> high<00:02:10.950> as<00:02:11.009> eighty<00:02:11.310> one

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
of M goes even as high as eighty one

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.700 
of M goes even as high as eighty one
with<00:02:12.700> Stan<00:02:13.270> James<00:02:13.570> of<00:02:13.780> that<00:02:13.930> it's<00:02:14.500> a<00:02:14.560> more

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:14.710 
with Stan James of that it's a more

with Stan James of that it's a more
sensible<00:02:15.040> 56<00:02:15.670> elsewhere<00:02:16.240> I<00:02:16.510> don't<00:02:17.020> even<00:02:17.110> see

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
sensible 56 elsewhere I don't even see

that<00:02:17.410> many<00:02:17.590> girls<00:02:17.770> I<00:02:17.950> think<00:02:17.980> 22<00:02:18.340> is<00:02:18.640> as

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
that many girls I think 22 is as

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.730 
that many girls I think 22 is as
ambitious<00:02:19.240> of<00:02:19.480> that<00:02:19.660> bet<00:02:19.870> I<00:02:20.110> think<00:02:20.560> it's<00:02:20.650> gonna

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
ambitious of that bet I think it's gonna

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.260 
ambitious of that bet I think it's gonna
be<00:02:20.830> a<00:02:20.890> little<00:02:21.040> bit<00:02:21.220> more<00:02:21.400> little<00:02:21.940> bit<00:02:22.060> less

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
be a little bit more little bit less

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.150 
be a little bit more little bit less
interesting<00:02:22.720> that<00:02:22.930> I<00:02:23.140> think<00:02:23.620> games<00:02:23.830> gonna<00:02:24.010> end
