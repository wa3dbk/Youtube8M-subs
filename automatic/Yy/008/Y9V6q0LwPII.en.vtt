drape and thickness of the fabric a lot
of<00:00:32.040> times<00:00:32.250> I<00:00:32.369> use<00:00:32.520> these<00:00:32.700> smaller<00:00:33.059> needles<00:00:33.390> for

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
of times I use these smaller needles for

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.299 
of times I use these smaller needles for
delicate<00:00:33.870> work<00:00:34.110> such<00:00:34.350> as<00:00:34.380> lace<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:35.100> two

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
bigger needles for bulky yarns than

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.420 
bigger needles for bulky yarns than
enough<00:00:37.110> quickly<00:00:37.440> maybe<00:00:37.649> even<00:00:37.950> a<00:00:38.040> blanket<00:00:38.370> or

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
enough quickly maybe even a blanket or

enough quickly maybe even a blanket or
an<00:00:38.520> Afghan<00:00:39.200> when<00:00:40.200> you're<00:00:40.290> choosing<00:00:40.590> your

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
an Afghan when you're choosing your

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.040 
an Afghan when you're choosing your
needle<00:00:40.920> um<00:00:41.160> one<00:00:42.090> of<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.239> biggest<00:00:42.540> choices<00:00:42.750> is

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
needle um one of the biggest choices is

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.889 
needle um one of the biggest choices is
material<00:00:43.559> of<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.860> needle<00:00:44.420> they<00:00:45.420> come<00:00:45.629> off<00:00:45.780> in

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
material of the needle they come off in

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.010 
material of the needle they come off in
Inwood<00:00:46.370> plastic<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:47.640> metal<00:00:47.940> plastic<00:00:48.750> and

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
Inwood plastic and metal plastic and

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.479 
Inwood plastic and metal plastic and
metal<00:00:49.170> being<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.620> cheaper<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.129> easier<00:00:50.280> to

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
metal being the cheaper and easier to

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:51.889 
metal being the cheaper and easier to
find<00:00:50.700> that<00:00:51.180> doesn't<00:00:51.449> mean<00:00:51.539> that<00:00:51.600> they're<00:00:51.750> any

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
find that doesn't mean that they're any

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.270 
find that doesn't mean that they're any
worse<00:00:52.050> though<00:00:52.320> um<00:00:52.590> that<00:00:52.829> just<00:00:52.980> means<00:00:53.160> that

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
worse though um that just means that

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.549 
worse though um that just means that
they<00:00:53.430> each<00:00:53.879> each<00:00:54.300> kind<00:00:54.480> has<00:00:54.600> its<00:00:54.840> benefits<00:00:55.410> and

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
they each each kind has its benefits and

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.250 
they each each kind has its benefits and
disadvantages<00:00:55.829> um<00:00:56.690> metal<00:00:57.690> ones<00:00:57.840> are<00:00:57.989> really

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
disadvantages um metal ones are really

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.479 
disadvantages um metal ones are really
durable<00:00:58.440> which<00:00:58.800> is<00:00:58.920> nice

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
durable which is nice

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.670 
durable which is nice
they're<00:00:59.910> they're<00:01:00.420> cold<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.140> touch<00:01:01.260> which

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
they're they're cold to the touch which

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.280 
they're they're cold to the touch which
some<00:01:01.829> people<00:01:01.949> don't<00:01:02.280> like<00:01:02.750> but<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:04.019> they<00:01:04.140> can

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
some people don't like but and they can

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.420 
some people don't like but and they can
be<00:01:04.379> they<00:01:04.559> can<00:01:04.589> be<00:01:04.799> heavy<00:01:04.949> although<00:01:05.250> these<00:01:05.369> are

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
be they can be heavy although these are

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.100 
be they can be heavy although these are
very<00:01:05.970> light<00:01:06.180> they're<00:01:06.360> on<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.750> aluminum

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
very light they're on and the aluminum

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.960 
very light they're on and the aluminum
ones<00:01:07.290> are<00:01:07.439> really<00:01:07.650> light<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.040> um<00:01:08.280> they're<00:01:08.939> the

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
ones are really light and um they're the

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.760 
ones are really light and um they're the
easiest<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.510> find<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:10.049> broadest<00:01:10.409> range<00:01:10.560> is

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
easiest to find the broadest range is

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.320 
easiest to find the broadest range is
gonna<00:01:10.890> come<00:01:11.130> in<00:01:11.250> metal<00:01:11.640> so<00:01:11.790> that's<00:01:11.970> one<00:01:12.150> thing

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
gonna come in metal so that's one thing

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.630 
gonna come in metal so that's one thing
to<00:01:12.450> consider<00:01:12.740> plastic<00:01:13.740> can<00:01:14.250> be<00:01:14.369> a<00:01:14.400> little

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
to consider plastic can be a little

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.429 
to consider plastic can be a little
cheaper<00:01:15.000> they're<00:01:15.240> lighter<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:15.840> they're<00:01:16.020> they

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
cheaper they're lighter and they're they

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:17.780 
cheaper they're lighter and they're they
warm<00:01:16.740> up<00:01:16.890> when<00:01:17.100> you<00:01:17.189> hold<00:01:17.369> them<00:01:17.549> which<00:01:17.670> you<00:01:17.759> a

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
warm up when you hold them which you a

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.160 
warm up when you hold them which you a
lot<00:01:17.939> of<00:01:18.030> people<00:01:18.240> really<00:01:18.390> like<00:01:18.570> especially<00:01:19.080> if

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
lot of people really like especially if

these there are teens that I showed you
come<00:01:30.060> in<00:01:30.450> plastic<00:01:30.810> most<00:01:31.290> often<00:01:31.680> which<00:01:31.829> is<00:01:31.860> nice

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
come in plastic most often which is nice

fragile<00:01:56.420> another<00:01:57.420> thing<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.689> consider<00:01:57.780> is

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
fragile another thing to consider is

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.649 
fragile another thing to consider is

that metal neither mules are slippery
slippery<00:02:01.079> here<00:02:01.380> so<00:02:01.770> they<00:02:01.890> can<00:02:02.100> knit<00:02:02.280> a<00:02:02.430> stair

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
slippery here so they can knit a stair

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.020 
slippery here so they can knit a stair
which<00:02:02.909> is<00:02:03.090> one<00:02:04.020> benefit<00:02:04.500> to<00:02:04.560> that<00:02:05.030> when

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
which is one benefit to that when
