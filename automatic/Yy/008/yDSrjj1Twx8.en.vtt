00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.490
 good morning dear subscribers and 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.370
 new visitors taking advantage of what 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.650
 a few days I published the book review 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.220
 this time I bring you one 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:20.430
 comparative between glass and the book 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.530
 so in this way you can know which 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.650
 are the main differences and which 

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:28.050
 are the main similarities between 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.789
 both smartphones as always in the 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.949
 description of this video you will find 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.039
 more information and additional content 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.050
 Inside video seen from the front both 

00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:38.879
 differentiate by nuances in both the 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.339
 Android buttons are in the 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.260
 bottom margin but in the book the side 

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:45.749
 upper and lower are slightly 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.850
 arched the two devices also 

00:00:45.749 --> 00:00:49.649
 they differ by the position of the 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.949
 front camera and by the size of the 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:56.309
 screen that in both cases that gs ips 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.589
 hd the bip your is 30 grams lighter 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.690
 in both the volume control is 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:02.579
 find on the left side the button 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.040
 The power off and on of the unit 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.560
 has placed on the right side the jack 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.930
 audio and the microusb port on the side 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.090
 top and the microphone is next to the 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.010
 to the right of the lower side if 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.620
 we analyze the posterior area apart from 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.810
 the evident the vigor brings a surface 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:21.000
 with a stylish relief which I prefer 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.430
 to the smooth finish of the beat pro that 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.990
 technically it's more premium in both 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.000
 terminals we will have a cover 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.550
 back strongly anchored to the 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.380
 structure behind which hides a 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:34.229
 different distribution of the elements 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.570
 both with dual sim system and space 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.310
 for microsd card in practice the 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.229
 energy autonomy is very similar in 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.899
 both terminals by much that in the 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.149
 micro the battery capacity is 600 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.040
 extra milliamps you also have to have 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.840
 consider the difference in size of 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.119
 screen and the benefits of 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.130
 processor that also differs in 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.040
 two phones in terms of capacity 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:59.130
 storage the pro fbi has a 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.500
 total internal memory of 16 gigabytes 8 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.300
 gigabytes more than I saw worse than it 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.759
 can do if more memory is needed 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:08.759
 will use a micro SD card up to 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.739
 64 gigabytes on the other hand the two 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.500
 Cell phones have bluetooth connectivity 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:15.390
 and wi-fi and technology to look cas 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.650
 duplicate the mobile screen in a 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.840
 large format television 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.970
 yes it is true that in both cases the 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.890
 wifi range coverage is not so 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.989
 powerful as in other brands mobile 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.720
 most known some difference 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:30.870
 important in connectivity if only 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.700
 the book is compatible with 4g networks in 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.189
 As for the operating system, both of them 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.349
 to receive update to android 5.0 

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:39.120
 On the other hand, although both have 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:40.799
 a fluid behavior in web pages 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.959
 and when it comes to moving through the interface 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:45.150
 The truth is that the book brings a 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:47.549
 processor and a gpu with performance 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.799
 improved as much as I can cheat the 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:52.200
 know that the virus brings a processor 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:54.150
 mediatek of 8 cores and the book a 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.670
 quad-core processor you have to 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:59.220
 keep in mind that in this last one it comes 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.560
 with 64- bit architecture at the time of 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.930
 play with real racing 3 I have observed 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.209
 some occasional luck in the vip and 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:11.370
 although nothing of importance in reality 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:14.670
 the gpu is an evil and 450 inferior to the 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:17.129
 benefits of the mali t 760 of the beat 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.470
 pro in my opinion for games if it is 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:21.419
 true that the micro not only by the 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.160
 processor qualities but also 

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:25.860
 by 0.5 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.840
 Extra screen will be better for the 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.940
 who want a terminal focused on 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.610
 games with quality graphics for another 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.890
 part it seems a good idea to activate 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:37.080
 the smart gesture functionality 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.180
 in the pro beat when the screen is 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.920
 at rest either to control the 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.990
 music playback access the 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.090
 photo camera tracing an ace 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:46.770
 unlock the terminal by drawing a 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.680
 Perpendicular line from top to bottom 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:51.900
 with shingles we can barely touch two 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.610
 times or from the screen to activate it in 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.470
 Video playback can be seen 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.570
 greater clarity in the images 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.220
 shown on the live screen 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:01.950
 taking into account that the resolutions 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.750
 hd the results will be better in a 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.670
 smaller screen but it's also 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.410
 true that the pro beat has 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.390
 technology looks vision to improve 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.080
 key aspects such as the perception of 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.970
 colors 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.800
 the latter is appreciated above all when 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.900
 look at both screens on the side of 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.720
 either way both products will yield 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:21.120
 very well with local files in mp4 or 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.340
 even divx if we have downloaded a 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.840
 application as vlc that such is the 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.150
 playback of youtube content 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.020
 as always it will depend on the quality of 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.580
 the fountain 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.440
 in sound quality when playing 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.080
 music in both cases you consider the 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.970
 same as much as in eb and pro there is a 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.129
 series of extra audio technologies that 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:40.229
 in my opinion it's not worth activating 

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:41.599
 what is important to enable are 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:44.280
 the equalizer options 

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:46.740
 recommending adjusting the 60 band 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:49.020
 hertz and the 14 k hertz in addition to 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.030
 boost the bass booster with them 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.550
 you gain a sound with more body and more 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:55.620
 my recommendation is to download 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.629
 the google play music app and 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.610
 replace it with the one that attracts the system 

00:04:57.629 --> 00:05:01.979
 operative the speakerphone is 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:04.259
 moderately powerful in the micro and in the 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:06.659
 but at least no worse distorts 

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:08.430
 maximum volume of sound even with 

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:10.919
 the headphones does not come to a 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.569
 demolishing power which contributes to 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:14.639
 guarantee a level of security for 

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:16.740
 our ears for one's activity 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:18.870
 to explore web pages does not matter if 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.789
 choose one or the other as the behavior 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:22.409
 it is equally excellent in both cases 

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:24.599
 fluidity in the displacement by the 

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:26.580
 content good response and control to 

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:28.289
 practice zoom and equal loading speed 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.599
 of the contents with a good signal 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:32.759
 wifi what difference both mobile phones is 

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:33.840
 Clearly, the 5.5 - inch screen 

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:35.850
 of a book 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:38.190
 will give more play than the 5-inch 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:40.560
 worst beat but maybe for some it 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:43.020
 more remarkable than the pro beat if it counts 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.850
 with 4g network compatibility for the 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:46.800
 operation of the two sim cards that 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:48.870
 take to the terminal in email 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.970
 social networks and instant messaging 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:53.190
 the two terminals of unefon have 

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:55.050
 responded normally nothing to 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:57.150
 reproach them you have a recommendation 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:58.979
 activates the prediction system and 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:00.690
 automatic word correction for 

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:03.180
 the google key and even you 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:05.580
 I would recommend downloading google keyboard 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:07.710
 that brings a spelling system types 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:09.540
 white with both the book and the 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:11.910
 beat for the rear camera is the same 

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:14.040
 with native resolution of 8 megapixels and 

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:16.530
 13 megapixels per interpol action and 

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:18.690
 opening of f 2.2 the camera interface 

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:20.669
 it will also be practically the same except 

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:22.530
 by the fact that in the micro by 

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:24.600
 example a series of 

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:26.340
 color effects as extra and that for 

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:28.710
 use the maximum resolution in video 

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:30.780
 you have to mark the good option in the 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:32.850
 video settings you want an application 

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:35.430
 more modern camera I would recommend 

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:37.800
 download from play store google camera 

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:39.900
 offers in the beat pro and the beat by the 

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:42.270
 same results in photography 

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:44.490
 strange that seems with the vigor 

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:46.979
 theoretically inferior in benefits I have 

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:49.410
 obtained better defined images and 

00:06:46.979 --> 00:06:51.750
 with the mipro in some shots I could 

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:54.090
 appreciate a more yellowish hue 

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:56.250
 of the normal this last is more than 

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:57.750
 likely to be due to the software that 

00:06:56.250 --> 00:07:00.840
 both terminals will be updated to 

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:02.370
 pure android version 5.0 and it is possible 

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:04.500
 that also has something to do with 

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:06.270
 processor that is not the same in both 

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:08.039
 mobile phones with regard to recording 

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:11.070
 video although the two arrive at a 

00:07:08.039 --> 00:07:12.960
 resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels and 

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:15.479
 store the results in 3gp format 

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:18.150
 the image quality seems to be more 

00:07:15.479 --> 00:07:21.860
 convincing in the víctor in terms of 

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:21.860
 definition and balance of colors
