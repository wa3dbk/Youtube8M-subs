00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 hello and welcome to value 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.120
 pack this time directly from the mwc in barcelona 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.890
 Focus on the mobile right straight 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.929
 from the stand of corning known for the 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.910
 well-known types of glass such as the gorilla glas 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.980
 and we look what is this new to 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.420
 Everyone sees it until today 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.020
 know it is extremely scratch resistant and 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.340
 stable 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.050
 the problem was it has become too 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.340
 extremely thick which of course is a problem 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.050
 then sometimes it wants to market 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.490
 is she figuring out how to do it 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.529
 as thin as possible and still receives the 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.529
 stable property of gorilla glas 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.060
 life managed to use the 0.4 mm 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.859
 make it and still stable and 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.910
 There's also a matching that what 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.100
 We have different types of glasses 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.250
 earlier the normal lime glass and about 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.440
 1.6 mm thick and more modern 0.8 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.300
 millimeter thick glasses from competitors 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.550
 and just the current founder glass 3 with 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.960
 0.4 millimeter thick we are showing now 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.430
 what differences there are when we 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.200
 to exert the same pressure about the same 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.309
 Scratch all over and then again 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.980
 press it correctly 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.699
 we start with the normal classes 1 6 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.440
 millimeters 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.270
 that's what the ammann cutters and 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.250
 let unknown force 1600 grams 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.840
 encourage and what kind of a pressure 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.160
 in a nest with the glass we see 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.390
 the cut clearly visible and 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.199
 pretty deep and you can do it too 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.580
 good fulfillment 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.100
 then it goes on with the 0.8 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.380
 millimeter thick glass in another 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.540
 provider and the whole looks quite 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.490
 otherwise it is also a lot of sense if 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.259
 I cut it in now then he is 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.850
 visible again and breaks at the same time 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.990
 the whole very easily by that 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.729
 it is clear that this means that andrÃ© 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.560
 glass in conclusion then have just yet 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.420
 the gorilla glass three here clearly 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.850
 thinner and still scratch resistant one 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.619
 hardly sees it and barely follows it 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.630
 again let 90 of pressure on it 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.979
 Nevertheless, there is no crack is already 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.479
 pretty impressive with this fat one 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.040
 What else can I do if now is one 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.689
 new advised antibacterial plain 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.070
 the reason behind it is simple because we 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.990
 spend to the smartphone as well 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.159
 time to eat and drink and when 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.299
 we are already on the very cleanliness 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.430
 should be careful here too 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.780
 already the problem is only that 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.009
 it has actually become a type 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.049
 or just a coating scratch 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.329
 that's why the eu only come 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.530
 directly into the glass if the whole works 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.520
 we are here and above all we see 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.390
 first time I like my smartphone 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.390
 actually is 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.540
 just water some and test the 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:47.950
 number of bacteria that are on it and 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.500
 to look how big this actually 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.440
 Effect of this anti the micro 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.879
 coating actually driving brussels 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.989
 the whole thing was rubbed in well 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:58.450
 that in so arises from another 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:00.159
 liquid done in front of his meter 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.940
 where will we see how trend is 

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:02.940
 actually my cellphone really 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.120
 to want to help one 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.960
 as we have seen is my cellphone 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.550
 still got along quite well with 230 the 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.960
 limit values are higher at 1000 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:25.160
 is really dangerous, especially for 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.900
 antibacterial coating already exists 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.370
 long with silver ions the problem is 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.110
 if we park this glass all over 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.880
 we do not want to be sad and less so 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.140
 the second option would be one 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.550
 coating from sandy pack but 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.650
 against it every scratch 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:38.420
 what has been done conti is this 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.560
 to pack silver ions into the glass without 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.600
 that the whole thing becomes cloudy 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.830
 that keeps the whole length of the 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.720
 Bacteria that actually optimal 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.010
 roughly summarized 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.600
 We of corning once again harder 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.190
 do not use it to glass our smartphones 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.570
 skip when they fall down and 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.310
 also something antimicrobial around it 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:53.830
 improve health not only at 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.640
 smartphones but also at bank machines 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.770
 ticket machines what he's what we 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.730
 Touch everything so live 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:00.730
 perfect for the future
