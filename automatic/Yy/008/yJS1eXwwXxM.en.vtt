00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:05.280
 hello good we all have here kim 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:09.760
 jong craig and we are going to bring you more changes 

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:11.330
 still because river is undecided 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.790
 Y 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:16.219
 they have touched evelyn again because no 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:20.210
 moment with enough and now white has 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:25.270
 touched the cost of mana to the cv and is that 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:28.189
 before it cost 14 18 22 26 or 30 weeks 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:34.309
 respectively to the range and now 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:36.500
 costs 16 22 28 34 and 40 mana 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:39.640
 It's worth according to the range 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:44.920
 and then we have a change of 3 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:46.720
 but it seems fair copy me 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.829
 It seems fair to the assholes that 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.719
 they did that 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:52.159
 or good if people were very 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:55.920
 coordinated could really do it 

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:59.309
 but it is very complicated to do it and it is that 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.810
 have made an enemy can not 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:06.570
 eat more than one wall 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:09.990
 of the last three of three 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.030
 because for example at level 6 if you 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.770
 they threw the ultimate and enemies economy 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.950
 two walls removed more than half 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.380
 life and it did not explode but it's that 7 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.369
 foreigners like to commit 22 walls 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.369
 I deserve to die 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.190
 the gays that are going 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:30.300
 and that in the tate they were found 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:33.520
 walls is also very difficult 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:35.920
 but hey these are the changes that have 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:39.400
 At the moment, there are few 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.710
 I feel but I do not know I like to tell everything 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.720
 day by day I hope you liked it 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.910
