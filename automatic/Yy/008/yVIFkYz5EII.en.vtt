tunnel but I don't want to risk things

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:40.710 
tunnel but I don't want to risk things
yet<00:02:30.710> because<00:02:32.020> all<00:02:33.020> right<00:02:33.320> phone<00:02:33.650> guard<00:02:38.860> earth

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
yet because all right phone guard earth

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:47.470 
yet because all right phone guard earth
bullet<00:02:41.720> Lara<00:02:44.110> so<00:02:45.110> what<00:02:45.440> I<00:02:45.470> achieved<00:02:46.420> opened<00:02:47.420> a

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
bullet Lara so what I achieved opened a

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:55.570 
bullet Lara so what I achieved opened a
hole<00:02:48.490> in<00:02:49.490> the<00:02:49.790> floor<00:02:52.630> you<00:02:53.630> can't<00:02:54.370> do<00:02:55.370> anything

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
hole in the floor you can't do anything

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.840 
hole in the floor you can't do anything
with<00:02:55.850> this<00:02:56.360> is<00:02:56.600> a<00:02:56.630> gap<00:02:57.530> I<00:02:57.890> think<00:02:58.550> that's<00:02:58.730> a

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
with this is a gap I think that's a

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.750 
with this is a gap I think that's a
fail-safe<00:02:59.120> thing<00:02:59.780> that<00:03:00.110> basically<00:03:00.470> says<00:03:00.800> if

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
fail-safe thing that basically says if

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.720 
fail-safe thing that basically says if
you<00:03:02.180> don't<00:03:02.720> have<00:03:03.110> the<00:03:03.830> items<00:03:04.220> that<00:03:04.340> you<00:03:04.520> need

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
you don't have the items that you need

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:10.120 
you don't have the items that you need
