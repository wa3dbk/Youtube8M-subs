with very clean air it's possible to do

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:17.610 
with very clean air it's possible to do
that<00:02:13.480> today<00:02:13.750> and<00:02:14.219> we<00:02:15.219> have<00:02:15.840> also<00:02:16.840> if<00:02:17.140> you<00:02:17.290> look

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
that today and we have also if you look

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.280 
that today and we have also if you look
at<00:02:17.829> the<00:02:18.010> the<00:02:18.489> lifetime<00:02:19.030> costs<00:02:19.569> of<00:02:19.719> a<00:02:19.810> house<00:02:19.959> and

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
at the the lifetime costs of a house and

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.890 
at the the lifetime costs of a house and
you<00:02:20.980> use<00:02:21.189> very<00:02:21.549> little<00:02:21.939> energy<00:02:22.120> energy

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
you use very little energy energy

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:29.490 
you use very little energy energy
because<00:02:23.829> the<00:02:23.980> passive<00:02:24.370> house<00:02:24.720> is<00:02:27.420> is<00:02:28.500> also

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
because the passive house is is also

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.369 
because the passive house is is also
saving<00:02:30.010> very<00:02:30.370> much<00:02:30.579> energy<00:02:31.090> in<00:02:31.150> comparison<00:02:31.569> to

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:32.379 
saving very much energy in comparison to

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:36.390 
saving very much energy in comparison to
normal<00:02:33.069> houses<00:02:33.870> you<00:02:34.870> use<00:02:35.349> very<00:02:35.769> little<00:02:36.220> energy

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
normal houses you use very little energy

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.000 
normal houses you use very little energy
I<00:02:36.730> mean<00:02:37.209> very<00:02:37.599> little<00:02:37.780> of<00:02:38.230> that<00:02:38.349> means<00:02:38.650> it

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
I mean very little of that means it

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.009 
I mean very little of that means it
means<00:02:39.250> perhaps<00:02:39.549> 10<00:02:39.969> percent<00:02:40.450> of<00:02:40.689> the<00:02:40.870> normal

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
means perhaps 10 percent of the normal

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:44.759 
means perhaps 10 percent of the normal
energy<00:02:41.379> used<00:02:41.950> in<00:02:42.159> the<00:02:42.250> you<00:02:42.400> house<00:02:43.319> you<00:02:44.319> you

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
energy used in the you house you you

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:47.339 
energy used in the you house you you
have<00:02:45.099> lifetime<00:02:45.430> costs<00:02:46.359> in<00:02:46.659> the<00:02:46.810> house<00:02:46.959> which

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:47.349 
have lifetime costs in the house which

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:51.809 
have lifetime costs in the house which
is<00:02:47.379> which<00:02:48.310> are<00:02:48.489> very<00:02:48.970> low<00:02:49.269> and<00:02:49.590> it's<00:02:50.590> a<00:02:51.250> really

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:51.819 
is which are very low and it's a really

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:54.420 
is which are very low and it's a really
good<00:02:52.419> business<00:02:52.780> for<00:02:53.349> a<00:02:53.379> family<00:02:53.919> to<00:02:54.099> live<00:02:54.280> in

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
good business for a family to live in
