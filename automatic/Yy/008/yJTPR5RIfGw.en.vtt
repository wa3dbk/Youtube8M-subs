things in life to worry about

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.109 
things in life to worry about
you<00:01:40.920> should<00:01:41.130> be<00:01:41.220> proud<00:01:41.460> that<00:01:41.700> you're<00:01:41.850> putting

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
you should be proud that you're putting

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.149 
you should be proud that you're putting
on<00:01:42.240> size<00:01:42.450> if<00:01:42.869> it's<00:01:43.350> fat<00:01:43.619> that<00:01:43.799> you're<00:01:43.920> gaining
