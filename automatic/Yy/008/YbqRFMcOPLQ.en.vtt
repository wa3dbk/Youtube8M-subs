board Johnny will cut it out for you
it's<00:01:13.660> just<00:01:13.899> the<00:01:14.080> this<00:01:14.380> is<00:01:14.560> the<00:01:14.590> JIRA<00:01:14.950> the

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:15.159 
it's just the this is the JIRA the

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:16.800 
it's just the this is the JIRA the
bigger<00:01:15.310> version<00:01:15.729> councilman<00:01:16.390> drop<00:01:16.600> through

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
bigger version councilman drop through

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.010 
bigger version councilman drop through
cutouts<00:01:17.140> in<00:01:17.260> it<00:01:17.320> so<00:01:18.100> on<00:01:18.460> the<00:01:19.030> left<00:01:19.210> is<00:01:19.450> a<00:01:19.479> custom

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
cutouts in it so on the left is a custom

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.590 
cutouts in it so on the left is a custom
drop<00:01:20.470> to<00:01:20.650> zero<00:01:21.369> then<00:01:22.000> you<00:01:22.150> have<00:01:22.270> the<00:01:22.390> mirror

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
drop to zero then you have the mirror

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.240 
drop to zero then you have the mirror
which<00:01:22.900> is<00:01:23.049> the<00:01:23.110> smallest<00:01:23.260> and<00:01:23.860> then<00:01:24.040> you<00:01:24.159> have

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
which is the smallest and then you have

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.380 
which is the smallest and then you have
taught<00:01:24.549> mound<00:01:24.790> here<00:01:25.380> what<00:01:26.380> do<00:01:26.439> you<00:01:26.500> have<00:01:26.619> to<00:01:26.710> do

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
taught mound here what do you have to do

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.249 
taught mound here what do you have to do
how<00:01:28.390> about<00:01:28.600> a<00:01:28.630> sweeper<00:01:30.360> now<00:01:31.360> put<00:01:31.570> this<00:01:31.720> do<00:01:32.200> you

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:32.259 
how about a sweeper now put this do you

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:33.870 
how about a sweeper now put this do you
know<00:01:32.320> how<00:01:32.439> big<00:01:32.590> the<00:01:32.619> board<00:01:32.890> is<00:01:33.009> like<00:01:33.759> the

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
know how big the board is like the

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.219 
know how big the board is like the
dimensions<00:01:34.299> yeah<00:01:35.640> ok<00:01:36.640> ok<00:01:37.540> so<00:01:37.600> how<00:01:37.840> long<00:01:38.049> is<00:01:38.080> it

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.229 
dimensions yeah ok ok so how long is it

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:43.260 
dimensions yeah ok ok so how long is it
since<00:01:38.799> a<00:01:39.040> is<00:01:39.310> 37<00:01:40.060> 37<00:01:40.630> inches<00:01:41.020> big<00:01:41.439> like<00:01:42.159> 27<00:01:43.119> inch

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
since a is 37 37 inches big like 27 inch

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:48.359 
since a is 37 37 inches big like 27 inch
wheelbase<00:01:43.479> probably<00:01:45.420> 28<00:01:46.420> inch<00:01:46.720> wheelbase<00:01:47.369> how

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:48.369 
wheelbase probably 28 inch wheelbase how

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:50.670 
wheelbase probably 28 inch wheelbase how
wide<00:01:48.579> is<00:01:48.610> it<00:01:48.759> it's<00:01:49.360> 10<00:01:49.689> inches<00:01:49.960> wide<00:01:50.200> in<00:01:50.470> the

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
wide is it it's 10 inches wide in the

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.830 
wide is it it's 10 inches wide in the
pockets<00:01:51.100> where<00:01:51.460> you<00:01:51.579> need<00:01:51.729> it<00:01:51.810> tapered<00:01:52.810> waist

this<00:02:30.020> board<00:02:30.560> is<00:02:30.770> my<00:02:31.070> favorite<00:02:31.460> because<00:02:31.490> of<00:02:31.880> the

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
this board is my favorite because of the

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.190 
this board is my favorite because of the
drops<00:02:33.490> then<00:02:34.490> just<00:02:34.880> deep<00:02:35.120> enough<00:02:35.270> that<00:02:35.690> your

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
drops then just deep enough that your

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.470 
drops then just deep enough that your
foot<00:02:36.470> fits<00:02:36.710> in<00:02:36.890> and<00:02:37.310> you're<00:02:37.940> completely

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
foot fits in and you're completely

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.910 
foot fits in and you're completely
locked<00:02:38.780> in<00:02:38.990> and<00:02:39.230> your<00:02:39.320> foots<00:02:39.530> not<00:02:39.680> going<00:02:39.860> to

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
locked in and your foots not going to

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:50.790 
locked in and your foots not going to
slide<00:02:40.130> forward<00:02:40.160> or<00:02:40.760> back<00:02:40.940> on<00:02:41.180> the<00:02:41.270> board<00:02:48.820> and

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
slide forward or back on the board and

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.580 
slide forward or back on the board and
but<00:02:51.800> it's<00:02:51.920> not<00:02:52.070> so<00:02:52.340> drop<00:02:52.640> that<00:02:52.880> it<00:02:53.570> feels<00:02:54.290> like

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
but it's not so drop that it feels like

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.770 
but it's not so drop that it feels like
you<00:02:55.250> can't<00:02:55.280> turn<00:02:55.760> it<00:02:56.030> as<00:02:56.180> quick<00:02:56.210> as<00:02:56.540> you<00:02:56.630> need

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
you can't turn it as quick as you need

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:09.430 
you can't turn it as quick as you need
to<00:02:56.810> or<00:03:07.270> the<00:03:08.270> basic<00:03:08.660> basically<00:03:09.050> it<00:03:09.140> feels<00:03:09.320> like

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
to or the basic basically it feels like

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.960 
to or the basic basically it feels like
a<00:03:09.560> top<00:03:09.770> mount<00:03:10.010> with<00:03:10.130> the<00:03:10.220> locking<00:03:10.580> feel<00:03:10.790> of<00:03:10.910> a

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
a top mount with the locking feel of a

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.580 
a top mount with the locking feel of a
drop<00:03:11.180> now<00:03:11.360> and<00:03:11.630> that's<00:03:11.810> what<00:03:11.930> I<00:03:11.990> like<00:03:12.140> about<00:03:12.170> it

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
drop now and that's what I like about it

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.430 
drop now and that's what I like about it
so<00:03:13.040> it's<00:03:13.340> got<00:03:13.550> like<00:03:13.730> seven<00:03:14.450> seven<00:03:15.290> or<00:03:15.350> eight

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
so it's got like seven seven or eight

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.310 
so it's got like seven seven or eight

its TIFF goes all the way down into the

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.280 
its TIFF goes all the way down into the
pockets<00:03:24.620> right<00:03:25.160> about<00:03:25.370> into<00:03:25.760> the<00:03:25.930> taper<00:03:26.930> and

then um some things like that both sides

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.340 
then um some things like that both sides
it<00:03:30.260> keeps<00:03:30.500> its<00:03:31.240> stiff<00:03:32.240> doesn't<00:03:32.750> like<00:03:32.900> deal<00:03:33.140> am
