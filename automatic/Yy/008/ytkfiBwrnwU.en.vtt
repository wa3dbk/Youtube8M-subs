00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.610
 good to all guys and girls and 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.560
 welcome to sanxenxo city sunset 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.920
 exclusive game overdrive so that the 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.510
 Uruguay and today I 'm going to bring you the traps 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.250
 what are the pitfalls to stop the 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.470
 waves that will help you stop 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.780
 we will not have them stop 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:40.239
 ourselves but good that the 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.340
 know of each one I do not know if I will have them 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:44.710
 all of course I have the pass of 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:48.700
 season and they will surely come out more in 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.900
 that sunset season pass and good 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.230
 I'm going to teach the ones that I have that are not 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:54.610
 few 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.610
 for this we go to menu 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:00.320
 we go to the skull this because we 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.080
 we go directly to traps 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.810
 here we will leave the tutorial we are going to 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.830
 change and tutorial does not come out there we have 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.750
 all the traps we have 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:13.040
 available right now 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:14.990
 that are 12 are not few and well we are going to 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.360
 give the tutorial that you see each one what 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.310
 what does it do but what does it have to do? 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:23.660
 consider what you spend from power 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:25.850
 you also see applauds at low bass 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:29.380
 left you see the power in this case 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.380
 they put 20 that is already 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.210
 and good after you see what they do 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:37.210
 to know what we spend the money that 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.810
 have equipped when the enemies are 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.810
 approximate 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.890
 the first pretty basic up to 20 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.110
 because 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.000
 to make enemies fly in 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.070
 different directions according to how 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.200
 Colombia 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:04.940
 you can count the children or other branches 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.940
 like the good 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.560
 a trapdoor 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:18.970
 bounces in this trap I know how to send to 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:21.570
 enemy and send it through the air 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.570
 love 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.630
 this the same as the fire but of 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.970
 ice like this 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.730
 freezer but if it bounced on it 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:40.290
 activates jets that freeze enemies 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.290
 much farther 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:53.750
 Lemaitre now a challenge of a lifetime 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.750
 Place the previous year 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:11.620
 cheat network power of this is 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.380
 rocket soda trap what's up 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:18.450
 that spend 30 years cuts 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.450
 bottled dial with a lot of style 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:30.210
 deep trap oven oven makes green 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:33.330
 provides on these rails to cook 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:37.100
 the enemies drones numbers for a 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.100
 baked more white 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.400
 and as you see you get on the fence at 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.130
 get on the fence because you're on top 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.709
 from it and flamethrowers are coming out 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.230
 sides is not bad it's cheap 5 each piece 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:53.560
 what happens that you have to do a good 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:56.020
 way to 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:59.460
 for what 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:59.460
 so it's worth it 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:08.030
 This is one of the best there is besides 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:09.620
 up to 15 but you'll see why it bounces 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.680
 this trap to shoot rays 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:15.940
 electric in all directions placed 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:20.109
 several leagues to increase its effectiveness 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.109
 effectively if you join several 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:27.080
 like he catches and does not spend much are 15 

00:04:24.219 --> 00:04:29.220
 take a pretty large attack radius 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.740
 considerably important 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:34.040
 I also really like this trap 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:38.030
 Pandora's box 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:40.820
 open the lid and surprise bounces on the 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:44.050
 trap to reveal a random surprise 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.050
 normally lethal 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.150
 I enjoy 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:59.879
 is the random everything stays and 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:04.280
 age if it is chance but the good thing comes out 

00:04:59.879 --> 00:05:04.280
 what comes out is quite powerful 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:10.440
 these are also very well does not happen that 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:12.870
 and 33 great men are like 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:15.810
 all is due at the beginning but with 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:19.160
 each low improves and involves more damage and 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:19.160
 get more hit points 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.930
 it's amazing because the doll goes 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:29.980
 evolving until the third phase and 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:33.100
 when the third one arrives it is devastating 

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:37.240
 and the last two traps 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:39.550
 the explosive wolf hopes that they have 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:42.150
 then available to cause the 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:42.150
 maximum damage 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:50.320
 well that is directly putting a 

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:53.740
 explosive with clown face that attracts 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:55.180
 a little bit the enemies and when you see 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:58.849
 that is close that is full of guys 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:06:02.179
 so you shoot the balloons and boom 

00:05:58.849 --> 00:06:05.110
 as his name says and the last trap to 

00:06:02.179 --> 00:06:07.639
 death by decibels 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:10.879
 up to 10 

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:14.389
 it is spent little up the volume man 

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:18.009
 this trap secure the enemies with 

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:18.009
 a sound wave 

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:25.240
 I do not see it too powerful but 

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:27.480
 He threw them good for all other 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.480
 enemies 

00:06:29.009 --> 00:06:34.080
 and nothing guys I hope you liked it 

00:06:30.779 --> 00:06:36.589
 these are the traps to stop the 

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:40.339
 waves to help you stop the waves 

00:06:36.589 --> 00:06:40.339
 there are some that are very interesting 

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:45.950
 and the only thing you have in mind is 

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:48.560
 the energy he spends in putting that trap 

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:53.420
 because we have limited energy 

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:55.190
 logically and if we calculate well and what 

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:57.650
 we put in the right area can do 

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:59.810
 havoc in the waves and you can 

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:01.010
 make the job much easier and nothing 

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:03.080
 I hope you liked that you have 

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:05.360
 known a little bit more the game its 

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:09.610
 arms their traps and see you in 

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:09.610
 following videos until after um
