00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:28.090 
finally going up uh halfway there on the

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:30.120 
finally going up uh halfway there on the
spire<00:06:28.479> and<00:06:28.810> i<00:06:29.020> think<00:06:29.349> he's<00:06:29.500> probably<00:06:29.710> saving

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:30.130 
spire and i think he's probably saving

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:32.700

up<00:06:30.400> because<00:06:30.610> he<00:06:30.699> hasn't<00:06:30.909> made<00:06:31.210> a<00:06:31.270> lot<00:06:31.569> i<00:06:31.930> think

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:32.710 
up because he hasn't made a lot i think

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:34.469 
up because he hasn't made a lot i think
he<00:06:32.800> probably<00:06:32.949> has<00:06:33.190> about<00:06:33.310> 10,000<00:06:34.150> minerals<00:06:34.389> in

00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:34.479
