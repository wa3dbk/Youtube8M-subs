 welcomed in the colosseum theater in essen 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:11.150
 the tüv nord and 200 guests to the forum 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.150
 energy efficiency and energy management 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.950
 holger hofmann head of the department 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.539
 the environment and climate protection of tüv nord was called 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:26.970
 the participants of the forum welcome 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.009
 my name is holger hofmann and i am 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.259
 responsible at tüv nord cert for 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:34.290
 the department of environment and climate protection 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:37.620
 and I guide you through this today 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:41.070
 forum is knowledge is a forum a place 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.120
 to exchange thoughts and in 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.460
 this sense 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.410
 he ask me all to think 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.559
 much and please also exchange a lot 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.260
 The morning started with lectures 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.960
 by dr andreas ciolek thomas denzer and 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.730
 france the theoretical ground 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.649
 for the topics energy efficiency and 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.809
 Construction and operation of energy 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.820
 management system as well as the out 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.649
 given occasion current energy policy 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.950
 the goal is actually there 

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:09.860
 save energy energy flows 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.880
 to make transparent and 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.530
 energy saving lead to one 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.869
 cost advantage or for 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.429
 increase the competitiveness ago 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.979
 i see everything in the instrumentarium 

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:21.990
 50001 has had a chance several times 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.759
 were addressed to one 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.229
 structured and transparent way and 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.299
 as the theme of energy apart 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.890
 to put 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:30.869
 Energy management is not new that 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.549
 have been operating companies for years 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.920
 only by having one now 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.409
 normalized system is there 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.000
 Responsibilities assignment me 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.420
 create a frame in which I am 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.250
 move 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.229
 the competitiveness of the industry 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.090
 depends on a cheap and hangs 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.500
 safe energy 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.570
 Energy costs are a cost factor 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.460
 is the political component 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.590
 the other variant is the theme 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.360
 energy energy resources a limited 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.070
 Resource is with us carefully 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.930
 So we have to deal with it 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.430
 to certify energy providers village 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.950
 The certifier must be independent 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.050
 the audi tor we can be the customer 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.900
 while we slide to record the data 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:09.090
 To conduct an IS analysis is all 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.640
 conditions for doing so and the 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.400
 continuing to make recertification 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:16.590
 certifier wii resort before the 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.880
 mittagspause spoke lars to kirchner 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.900
 the theoretical morning session 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.200
 complete 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.380
 about energy audits after iso 50001 and 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.460
 din en 16 24 7 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.290
 many participants took advantage of this 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.900
 subsequent lunch buffet and yourself 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.340
 to exchange or specific questions 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.800
 set up by tüv nord 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.380
 to clarify information stands as they 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.090
 I came here to ask the questions 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.070
 something for a company already 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.530
 emas certified is the introduction 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:45.960
 an energy management system is worthwhile and 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.730
 What advantages ensue 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.200
 These have been very much 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.030
 satisfactorily answered and we 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:55.170
 are still looking forward to the 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.700
 discussion on practical example the second 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.190
 be part of the event 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.500
 Attention to practical examples 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.120
 to whom gerald orlik guido solbach and dr 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.910
 sticking rhymes to the topics 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.310
 Preparations support at NMS and 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.860
 energy audits peak compensation at 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.380
 Canoes and extension existing 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.060
 Thus, dedicated to management systems 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.940
 now until july if we have the 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.430
 complete energy planning 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.820
 management review in autumn internes 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:25.460
 on-site audit accordingly 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:27.260
 november levels level 2 we have one 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:29.350
 partner who supports us in the process 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.660
 on the one hand does the diligence 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:34.100
 accept us what is in vote 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.250
 with us with our specialist department 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.750
 Energy teams and that starts off pretty well 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.440
 or we are in the middle of it if you are like that 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:44.970
 want to say 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:48.070
 we are still certified as din 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:50.860
 2001 an introduction of a 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:52.360
 energy management system after 50,000 1 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.730
 I have not planned this yet 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.170
 do not feel it's a pity that it's too 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.880
 little incentive then also with the 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:00.160
 emas certification is available 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.260
 numerous possibilities of energy 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.600
 management even without the direct 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:07.660
 Certification of a management system 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:09.490
 yes there was an information from out of that 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.160
 middle class where you also energy audits 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:13.180
 then performed 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.070
 energy management systems that actually 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.200
 again in the same order of magnitude 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:19.420
 you have to expect tax advantage 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.640
 easy again efficiency potential 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:23.410
 rausgeholt and several tens of thousands of euros 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.390
 and of course that's a good argument 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.830
 for the energy management systems because of it 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:29.230
 Often too often the tax advantages 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.820
 played but ultimately shows that 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:32.740
 so much in the technology and much in the 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.690
 management approach itself 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.370
 to get better and better in 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.290
 the duty to take the management the 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.670
 Duty is also available to someone 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.590
 to put resource on it 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:42.730
 To take care of 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.250
 the lecture series of 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:46.980
 dr overath and doctor jansen mundl the 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:48.850
 with the themes in return for 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:51.340
 compensation and peak compensation 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:53.110
 from the point of view of the industry associations and 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.270
 requirements for the verification of the 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.430
 lace compensation laid the foundation stone 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:59.200
 for the final panel discussion the still 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:01.710
 was used intensively at last 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.710
 to clarify questions 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:09.160
 it was obvious that participants 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:12.010
 and organizers were very satisfied 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.840
 and both sides ideas and suggestions 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:14.650
 for this highly informative day 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.570
 take 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:19.120
 as a speaker but also as a participant 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:20.860
 and interested listeners i have to give them 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.750
 say very nice nice ambience 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:24.850
 you can not say otherwise nice 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:27.040
 beautiful frame also with an Amazon 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:28.840
 technical touch still behind technology 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.970
 and management as always from tüv nord 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:33.010
 some perfect suddenly different heard 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:35.650
 have a very interesting here today 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:37.960
 forum experiences energy around the topic 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:39.940
 management system and energy efficiency 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.310
 we have many interesting speakers 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.810
 so had the advice of the over 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:45.990
 the political framework and into the 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:48.070
 current jurisdiction namely in the 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:50.200
 implementing regulation in ours 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:52.300
 given a template overview 

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:54.370
 have as the future here in the area 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:56.000
 Energy Management looks like I was 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:58.340
 surprised about 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.230
 yes also the understanding and the 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.940
 self-image of industry representatives 

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:03.740
 who have recognized for themselves 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:06.200
 potential in energy management 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:08.510
 Not just the short-term ones are in it 

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.370
 tax advantages but also long term 

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:12.380
 and sustainable competitiveness 

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:13.580
 and that was for me 

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:15.710
 a good experience and we have 

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:18.020
 certainly today his guests yes 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:21.490
 certainly a very extensive online 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:21.490
 a good program was born
