controller directly to the phone at the
time<00:01:11.250> of<00:01:11.400> recording<00:01:11.909> we<00:01:12.150> tried<00:01:12.450> it<00:01:12.479> with<00:01:12.810> one

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
time of recording we tried it with one

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.130 
time of recording we tried it with one
of<00:01:13.409> these<00:01:13.500> USB<00:01:14.030> hosting<00:01:15.030> cables<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:15.900> although

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
of these USB hosting cables and although

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.810 
of these USB hosting cables and although
it<00:01:16.229> recognized<00:01:16.740> something<00:01:17.009> was<00:01:17.280> connected<00:01:17.729> it

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
it recognized something was connected it

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.730 
it recognized something was connected it
said<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.150> power<00:01:18.390> consumption<00:01:18.930> was

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
said the power consumption was

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.590 
said the power consumption was
essentially<00:01:20.250> too<00:01:20.549> great<00:01:20.880> from<00:01:21.479> the

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
essentially too great from the

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.020 
essentially too great from the
controller<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:22.229> enable<00:01:22.560> us<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:22.680> do<00:01:23.009> it<00:01:23.189> now<00:01:23.880> one

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
controller to enable us to do it now one

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.090 
controller to enable us to do it now one
of<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.180> limitations<00:01:24.330> of<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.110> expiry<00:01:25.560> in

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
of the limitations of the expiry in

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.090 
of the limitations of the expiry in
comparison<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:26.820> devices<00:01:27.600> of<00:01:28.140> past<00:01:28.500> is<00:01:28.860> that

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
comparison to devices of past is that

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.370 
comparison to devices of past is that
there's<00:01:29.549> no<00:01:29.640> HDMI<00:01:30.420> connection<00:01:30.900> on<00:01:31.020> this<00:01:31.170> now

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
there's no HDMI connection on this now

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.109 
there's no HDMI connection on this now
so<00:01:31.619> previously<00:01:32.280> you<00:01:32.400> could<00:01:32.460> connect<00:01:32.909> up

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
so previously you could connect up

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.330 
so previously you could connect up
through<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.900> live<00:01:34.049> playstation<00:01:34.979> controller

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
through the live playstation controller

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.880 
through the live playstation controller
and<00:01:35.729> then<00:01:36.299> also<00:01:36.479> take<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:37.020> video<00:01:37.170> out<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.770> your

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
and then also take the video out to your

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.219 
and then also take the video out to your
HD<00:01:38.189> display<00:01:38.610> so<00:01:38.670> you<00:01:38.970> could<00:01:39.119> essentially<00:01:39.509> have

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
HD display so you could essentially have

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.730 
HD display so you could essentially have
console<00:01:41.100> ish<00:01:41.430> type<00:01:41.970> gaming<00:01:42.570> on<00:01:43.229> your<00:01:43.470> device

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
console ish type gaming on your device

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.450 
console ish type gaming on your device
but<00:01:44.070> connected<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.670> a<00:01:44.700> larger<00:01:45.149> HD<00:01:45.659> display<00:01:46.460> now

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
but connected to a larger HD display now

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.920 
but connected to a larger HD display now
because<00:01:47.880> you<00:01:47.970> ready<00:01:48.119> got<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.299> one<00:01:48.450> connection

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
because you ready got the one connection

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:49.760 
because you ready got the one connection
on<00:01:49.020> here<00:01:49.259> you're<00:01:49.380> going<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.560> have<00:01:49.649> to

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
on here you're going to have to

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.969 
on here you're going to have to
wirelessly<00:01:50.280> stream<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:51.180> content<00:01:51.659> from<00:01:51.990> your

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
wirelessly stream the content from your

wirelessly stream the content from your

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
mobile device to your television now

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.690 
mobile device to your television now
different<00:01:55.710> televisions<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:56.340> different

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
different televisions and different

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.200 
different televisions and different
setups<00:01:58.040> will<00:01:59.040> possibly<00:01:59.280> mean<00:01:59.670> that<00:01:59.700> you<00:01:59.909> can't

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
setups will possibly mean that you can't

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.719 
setups will possibly mean that you can't
actually<00:02:00.390> do<00:02:00.930> that<00:02:00.960> and<00:02:01.799> then<00:02:02.430> it's<00:02:02.549> also

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
actually do that and then it's also

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.219 
actually do that and then it's also
going<00:02:02.939> to<00:02:03.000> be<00:02:03.090> down<00:02:03.240> to<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.450> game<00:02:03.719> and<00:02:03.930> how<00:02:04.049> it

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
going to be down to the game and how it

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.959 
going to be down to the game and how it
