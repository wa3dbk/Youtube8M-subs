 Only minutes 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:54.280
 I think I want and you'll remembrance to Fu say that the so-called workshop 

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:58.579
 I have completely omitted difficult stories 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:00.480
 Anyone can participate in this workshop experience meeting 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:03.829

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:09.220
 You can say 100% first of all 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:09.220

 Please rest assured that you will be able to make crisp videos even for beginners at all 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:25.320
 Speaking of videos, these days I 'm a hobby or something 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:30.640
 Business degree marketing Then those who are said to be youtuber 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:36.909
 Though I think that whether or not there is heard, as referred to earn using the au tube 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:39.370
 It has become very widespread in the use of video and business in Kanaya 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:43.159
 Also still Kedomo 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:46.340
 Actually there are very few people who make it 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:47.060
 This group called iphone imob 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.470
 Thing 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:54.090
 Toka or not it difficult is how easily and regardless of 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.720
 I wonder if the equipment is expensive 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.730
 It went so 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:04.290
 It was an image, though this is an image 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:07.400
 There is such an image, but it is said that you can not easily touch the video 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:14.240
 There are a lot of people 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:16.420
 But please think about it and replace it with a business and talk about it 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:20.050
 It is in any business 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:24.130
 It is everybody that the one who went first wins 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:29.739
 Regard this video also Would not it have been explicitly 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:35.300
 Everyone right now is its timing as well but I mean that as a food Do not try to focus on the here 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:40.760
 We also had you come watch this I rover opportunity 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:44.960
 So I think it would be nice if you could get into the video world 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:51.590

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:54.750
