them on guided tours right the way

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:59.679 
them on guided tours right the way
around<00:01:57.350> this<00:01:57.530> what<00:01:57.829> is<00:01:57.920> an<00:01:58.039> enormous<00:01:58.340> site<00:01:58.850> the

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
around this what is an enormous site the

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:01.450 
around this what is an enormous site the
response<00:02:00.109> was<00:02:00.320> absolutely<00:02:00.469> fantastic<00:02:00.859> and

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
response was absolutely fantastic and

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.310 
response was absolutely fantastic and
considering<00:02:01.939> we've<00:02:02.090> got<00:02:02.240> 2,000<00:02:02.929> people

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
considering we've got 2,000 people

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.080 
considering we've got 2,000 people
coming<00:02:03.950> through<00:02:03.979> our<00:02:04.249> gates<00:02:04.490> over<00:02:04.820> the<00:02:04.909> next

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
coming through our gates over the next

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.539 
coming through our gates over the next
fortnight<00:02:05.420> it<00:02:05.990> really<00:02:06.289> does<00:02:06.439> promise<00:02:06.770> to<00:02:06.950> be<00:02:07.100> a

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:07.549 
fortnight it really does promise to be a

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:12.410 
fortnight it really does promise to be a
hugely<00:02:08.149> successful<00:02:08.440> opening<00:02:09.440> event

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.230 

I<00:02:12.620> think<00:02:13.620> it's<00:02:13.740> a<00:02:13.800> really<00:02:14.099> great<00:02:14.250> idea<00:02:14.370> we<00:02:15.060> take

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
I think it's a really great idea we take

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.400 
I think it's a really great idea we take
a<00:02:15.300> lot<00:02:15.480> of<00:02:15.569> things<00:02:15.720> for<00:02:15.840> granted<00:02:16.170> in<00:02:16.290> our

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
a lot of things for granted in our

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.830 
a lot of things for granted in our
society<00:02:16.980> and<00:02:17.239> you<00:02:18.239> know<00:02:18.360> where<00:02:18.540> our<00:02:18.569> water

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
society and you know where our water

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.690 
society and you know where our water
comes<00:02:19.050> from<00:02:19.500> what<00:02:19.860> happens<00:02:20.130> with<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.459> sewage

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
comes from what happens with the sewage

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.250 
comes from what happens with the sewage
and<00:02:20.849> the<00:02:20.940> wastewater<00:02:21.300> when<00:02:21.630> it<00:02:21.750> goes<00:02:21.870> down<00:02:22.050> the

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
and the wastewater when it goes down the

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.380 
and the wastewater when it goes down the
pipes<00:02:22.500> in<00:02:23.160> the<00:02:23.370> end<00:02:23.520> you<00:02:23.790> know<00:02:23.910> matters<00:02:24.180> to<00:02:24.300> all

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
pipes in the end you know matters to all

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.330 
pipes in the end you know matters to all
of<00:02:24.510> us<00:02:24.569> and<00:02:24.810> I<00:02:24.900> think<00:02:24.959> having<00:02:25.470> this<00:02:25.590> wonderful

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
of us and I think having this wonderful

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.339 
of us and I think having this wonderful
Visitor<00:02:26.940> Center<00:02:27.360> to<00:02:27.630> give<00:02:27.780> schoolchildren

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
Visitor Center to give schoolchildren

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:30.290 
Visitor Center to give schoolchildren
the<00:02:28.440> chance<00:02:28.680> to<00:02:28.890> learn<00:02:29.069> about<00:02:29.430> what<00:02:29.640> happens<00:02:30.060> I

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
the chance to learn about what happens I

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.030 
the chance to learn about what happens I
think<00:02:30.780> it's<00:02:31.050> a<00:02:31.080> great<00:02:31.170> initiative<00:02:31.680> and<00:02:31.800> I<00:02:31.920> wish

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
think it's a great initiative and I wish

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.430 
think it's a great initiative and I wish
you<00:02:32.100> every<00:02:32.130> success

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.460 

I<00:02:36.120> really<00:02:37.120> like<00:02:37.270> to<00:02:37.420> encourage<00:02:37.660> it<00:02:37.990> because

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
I really like to encourage it because

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.070 
I really like to encourage it because
the<00:02:38.620> more<00:02:38.800> we<00:02:38.830> understand<00:02:39.460> about<00:02:39.780> how<00:02:40.780> all<00:02:41.050> of

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
the more we understand about how all of

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.660 
the more we understand about how all of
the<00:02:41.260> things<00:02:41.440> that<00:02:41.560> we<00:02:41.650> do<00:02:41.770> as<00:02:41.890> a<00:02:41.920> society<00:02:42.400> fit

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
the things that we do as a society fit

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.240 
the things that we do as a society fit
together

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
together

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.010 
together
for<00:02:45.250> example<00:02:45.670> dealing<00:02:45.880> with<00:02:46.210> with<00:02:46.660> wastewater

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
for example dealing with with wastewater

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.500 
for example dealing with with wastewater
we<00:02:47.590> know<00:02:47.800> that<00:02:48.100> if<00:02:48.670> it<00:02:48.820> doesn't<00:02:49.090> go<00:02:49.180> away<00:02:49.210> and

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
we know that if it doesn't go away and

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:50.730 
we know that if it doesn't go away and
there's<00:02:49.630> a<00:02:49.660> lot<00:02:49.780> of<00:02:49.870> rain<00:02:50.050> falling<00:02:50.350> out<00:02:50.530> of<00:02:50.560> the

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:50.740 
there's a lot of rain falling out of the

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.920 
there's a lot of rain falling out of the
sky<00:02:50.950> then<00:02:50.980> we<00:02:51.220> can<00:02:51.370> get<00:02:51.460> flooding<00:02:51.880> and<00:02:52.030> it's

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
sky then we can get flooding and it's

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.120 
sky then we can get flooding and it's
another<00:02:53.110> example<00:02:53.590> of<00:02:53.650> things<00:02:53.800> that<00:02:53.920> we've

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
another example of things that we've

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:55.890 
another example of things that we've
tended<00:02:54.520> to<00:02:54.610> take<00:02:54.760> for<00:02:55.150> granted<00:02:55.330> in<00:02:55.570> the<00:02:55.690> past

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
tended to take for granted in the past

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.290 
tended to take for granted in the past
so<00:02:56.140> building<00:02:56.890> understanding<00:02:57.190> I<00:02:57.820> think<00:02:58.090> is<00:02:58.180> in

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
so building understanding I think is in

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.030 
so building understanding I think is in
everybody's<00:02:58.720> interests<00:02:59.200> and<00:02:59.380> I<00:02:59.830> greatly

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
everybody's interests and I greatly

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.590 
everybody's interests and I greatly

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.920 
well yeah I mean you're at the heart of
it<00:03:08.860> if<00:03:09.490> we<00:03:09.640> think<00:03:09.670> about<00:03:09.910> the<00:03:10.090> river<00:03:10.270> air<00:03:10.540> and

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
it if we think about the river air and

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.780 
it if we think about the river air and
the<00:03:11.470> fact<00:03:11.680> that<00:03:11.740> the<00:03:11.920> investment<00:03:12.430> that's<00:03:12.550> gone

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
the fact that the investment that's gone

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.370 
the fact that the investment that's gone
into<00:03:12.970> this<00:03:13.180> site<00:03:13.450> which<00:03:13.750> I'm<00:03:13.900> looking<00:03:14.020> forward

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
into this site which I'm looking forward

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.530 
into this site which I'm looking forward
to<00:03:14.500> seeing<00:03:14.680> this<00:03:14.860> morning<00:03:15.160> is<00:03:15.730> improving<00:03:16.300> the

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
to seeing this morning is improving the

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.660 
to seeing this morning is improving the
river<00:03:16.960> quality<00:03:17.410> and<00:03:17.620> we've<00:03:18.220> made<00:03:18.400> a<00:03:18.430> lot<00:03:18.610> of

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
river quality and we've made a lot of

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.790 
river quality and we've made a lot of
progress<00:03:18.940> you<00:03:19.840> think<00:03:20.050> of<00:03:20.140> the<00:03:20.230> fish<00:03:20.440> that<00:03:20.680> are

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 
progress you think of the fish that are

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.290 
progress you think of the fish that are
now<00:03:20.920> back<00:03:21.220> that<00:03:21.520> had<00:03:21.640> disappeared<00:03:21.940> in

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:22.300 
now back that had disappeared in

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.400 
now back that had disappeared in
entirely<00:03:22.780> and<00:03:23.110> it<00:03:23.590> helps<00:03:23.920> to<00:03:24.340> regenerate<00:03:24.700> our

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
entirely and it helps to regenerate our

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.870 
entirely and it helps to regenerate our
communities<00:03:26.410> and<00:03:26.530> our<00:03:26.620> city<00:03:26.860> centers<00:03:27.340> because

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
communities and our city centers because

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.730 
communities and our city centers because
when<00:03:28.060> the<00:03:28.210> rivers<00:03:28.720> were<00:03:28.900> foul-smelling<00:03:29.140> and

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:29.740 
when the rivers were foul-smelling and

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:31.320 
when the rivers were foul-smelling and
dirty<00:03:29.890> people<00:03:30.400> didn't<00:03:30.760> want<00:03:30.820> to<00:03:30.970> live<00:03:31.090> there

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
dirty people didn't want to live there

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.150 
dirty people didn't want to live there
and<00:03:31.480> we<00:03:32.080> turned<00:03:32.350> our<00:03:32.470> face<00:03:32.620> away<00:03:32.890> from<00:03:32.920> the

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
and we turned our face away from the

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.040 
and we turned our face away from the
rivers<00:03:33.520> in<00:03:33.790> out<00:03:34.030> some<00:03:34.240> of<00:03:34.330> our<00:03:34.450> great<00:03:34.660> cities

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
rivers in out some of our great cities

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:37.080 
rivers in out some of our great cities
and<00:03:35.230> the<00:03:35.770> last<00:03:35.980> 20<00:03:36.550> years<00:03:36.580> because<00:03:36.790> the

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
and the last 20 years because the

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:38.130
