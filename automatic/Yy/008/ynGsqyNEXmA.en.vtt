 Speaks personal beauty so today I am 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.080
 here with one more video is unfortunately 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.220
 I could not do a game play in this 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.619
 friday because I'm with 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.650
 problems with computer rendering 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:25.199
 and I get to 50 and 60% and computers 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.420
 because it is because it reaches 90 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.019
 degrees and a processor automatically 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.410
 turns on 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.090
 well you are seeing here my screen 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.610
 I'm making this video in a little bit. 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.890
 special to the people of the kingdom nerd but 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.450
 they are using an application in the 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.300
 internet that is making fame now 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.730

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.190
 the registration is good for those who do not know I could 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:54.930
 The point of it is basically one that is 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.309
 appearing now on the screen is where any 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.379
 one can be g 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.030
 I take a song from youtube the boot 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.010
 playing here for example is playing 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.760
 both those of the unique rosemary 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.409

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.060

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.220
 so today I'll explain some 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.310
 things is to make life easier. 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.840
 You here at the club, it's okay. 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.090

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.560
 the g1 club here I have to cool 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.630
 when I like a song when 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.630

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.450
 starts dancing the character here has a 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.369
 boring that basically when you do not 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.650

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.659
 side I have the waiting list for myself 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.329
 to touch and here I can see the 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:51.470
 waiting list is that the video chat and 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.470

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.399

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.420

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:06.189
 it is here and here that serves the points then 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.039
 the points serve to change your to 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:10.840

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:13.630
 It's the Rotary here for you to change. 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.580
 up to 15 thousand points 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.230
 so they will explain here what can 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:22.450
 make life easier for you here I could not 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:25.720
 good way first thing is useful high 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:29.650
 keane kehl always pushes me 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.910
 I confuse good to those who do not know and got 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.730
 A lot of people here at the club . 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:36.790
 mainly left over when the 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:39.880
 music and and will play and listen will stay 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.680
 listening to music is that is does not give it 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.900
 in all the music does not look good in all 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.690
 music then something came to 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:51.220
 To solve this the script is since the club 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:55.930
 of effect on top of the base of java is 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:58.630

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:08.560
 cool in all the songs that come by 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:11.019
 that's it, that's good 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:15.130
 precisely for who gives to the one who leaves the 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:17.709
 the open room and going to play is good and the loud 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.870
 hotel and that is basically a self join 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:21.970
