00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.330 
facebook and stuff but this package took
about<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.660> week<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:40.230> two<00:00:40.440> days<00:00:40.469> or<00:00:40.920> so<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.160> get

about a week and two days or so to get
to<00:00:41.399> me<00:00:41.579> because<00:00:42.239> we<00:00:42.510> had<00:00:42.660> july<00:00:42.960> 4th<00:00:43.260> in<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.590> US

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
to me because we had july 4th in the US

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.250 
to me because we had july 4th in the US
so<00:00:45.800> you<00:00:46.800> know<00:00:46.920> cause<00:00:47.399> a<00:00:47.430> little<00:00:47.730> bit<00:00:47.850> of<00:00:47.940> delay

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
so you know cause a little bit of delay

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.049 
so you know cause a little bit of delay
but<00:00:49.260> week<00:00:50.010> in<00:00:50.129> two<00:00:50.280> days<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:50.610> not<00:00:50.730> too<00:00:50.879> bad

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
but week in two days and not too bad

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.619 
but week in two days and not too bad
it's<00:00:51.600> actually<00:00:51.899> pretty<00:00:52.050> alright<00:00:52.289> so<00:00:52.860> I<00:00:53.629> got

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
it's actually pretty alright so I got

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.400 
it's actually pretty alright so I got
some<00:00:55.469> wall<00:00:55.829> by<00:00:56.010> cards<00:00:56.940> oh<00:00:57.120> oh<00:00:57.510> cool<00:00:58.020> that<00:00:58.260> is

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
some wall by cards oh oh cool that is

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.979 
some wall by cards oh oh cool that is
pretty<00:00:58.649> nice<00:00:58.829> actually<00:00:59.090> check<00:01:00.090> that<00:01:00.239> out<00:01:00.270> f200

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
pretty nice actually check that out f200

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:08.710 
pretty nice actually check that out f200
ll<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:02.010> PLL<00:01:05.390> that<00:01:06.390> is<00:01:06.570> pretty<00:01:06.750> cool<00:01:07.020> all<00:01:07.590> right

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
ll and PLL that is pretty cool all right

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.120 
ll and PLL that is pretty cool all right
nice<00:01:09.720> i'll<00:01:10.170> take<00:01:10.439> a<00:01:10.470> look<00:01:10.560> at<00:01:10.740> that<00:01:10.920> a<00:01:11.070> little

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
nice i'll take a look at that a little

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.310 
nice i'll take a look at that a little
bit<00:01:11.970> later<00:01:12.210> so<00:01:13.080> this<00:01:13.320> is<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:14.600> mole<00:01:15.600> you<00:01:15.810> weigh

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
bit later so this is the mole you weigh

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.539 
bit later so this is the mole you weigh
long<00:01:16.590> cube<00:01:18.229> all<00:01:19.229> right<00:01:19.560> i'm<00:01:19.860> actually<00:01:20.250> excited

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
long cube all right i'm actually excited

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.679 
long cube all right i'm actually excited
about<00:01:20.939> this<00:01:22.070> so<00:01:23.070> sticky<00:01:23.340> shades<00:01:23.640> are<00:01:23.970> lighter

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
about this so sticky shades are lighter

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.109 
about this so sticky shades are lighter
than<00:01:24.890> usual<00:01:26.060> cubes<00:01:27.060> that<00:01:27.119> you'd<00:01:27.330> get

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
than usual cubes that you'd get

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:32.300 
than usual cubes that you'd get
comparison<00:01:30.119> really<00:01:30.780> quickly<00:01:31.140> so<00:01:31.350> I'll<00:01:32.189> just

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
comparison really quickly so I'll just

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.170 
comparison really quickly so I'll just
slide<00:01:32.640> your<00:01:32.670> shades<00:01:33.030> as<00:01:33.450> you<00:01:34.020> can<00:01:34.229> see

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.180 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:38.880 

but<00:01:37.780> i'm<00:01:37.930> probably<00:01:38.140> gonna<00:01:38.380> be<00:01:38.470> changing<00:01:38.680> them

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
but i'm probably gonna be changing them

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.280 
but i'm probably gonna be changing them
because<00:01:39.190> this<00:01:39.460> orange<00:01:39.820> I<00:01:40.060> don't<00:01:40.240> really<00:01:40.420> not<00:01:41.260> a

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
because this orange I don't really not a

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:42.870 
because this orange I don't really not a
big<00:01:41.590> fan<00:01:41.890> of<00:01:41.950> it<00:01:42.160> but<00:01:42.340> it's<00:01:42.490> pretty<00:01:42.640> all<00:01:42.850> right

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
big fan of it but it's pretty all right

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.930 
big fan of it but it's pretty all right
you<00:01:43.210> know<00:01:43.330> all<00:01:44.080> right<00:01:44.170> first<00:01:44.350> turns<00:01:44.590> Oh<00:01:47.940> kind

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
you know all right first turns Oh kind

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.500 
you know all right first turns Oh kind
of<00:01:49.090> feels<00:01:49.330> dry<00:01:50.520> heat<00:01:51.520> is<00:01:51.640> not<00:01:51.820> bad<00:01:52.120> out<00:01:52.330> of<00:01:52.450> the

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.510 
of feels dry heat is not bad out of the

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:56.130 
of feels dry heat is not bad out of the
box<00:01:52.660> though<00:01:52.870> I'm<00:01:53.350> actually<00:01:53.650> nice<00:01:54.040> speed<00:01:55.140> got

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.580 
spy wiper okay nice okay well let me see
how<00:02:08.560> the<00:02:08.619> pieces<00:02:08.860> look<00:02:09.360> really<00:02:10.360> quickly<00:02:10.690> you

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
how the pieces look really quickly you

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.590 
how the pieces look really quickly you
know<00:02:11.680> I<00:02:11.890> actually<00:02:12.130> like<00:02:12.610> that<00:02:12.820> blue<00:02:13.000> core<00:02:13.330> it

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
know I actually like that blue core it

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.350 
know I actually like that blue core it
looks<00:02:13.890> it<00:02:14.890> looks<00:02:14.920> pretty<00:02:15.430> nice<00:02:15.730> it's<00:02:16.150> like<00:02:16.239> a

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
looks it looks pretty nice it's like a

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.570 
looks it looks pretty nice it's like a
pretty<00:02:16.750> blue<00:02:18.660> but<00:02:19.660> um<00:02:19.830> so<00:02:20.830> here's<00:02:21.040> a<00:02:21.190> corner

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
pretty blue but um so here's a corner

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:29.610 
pretty blue but um so here's a corner
piece<00:02:21.989> and<00:02:24.150> here's<00:02:25.150> an<00:02:25.360> edge<00:02:25.480> piece<00:02:27.780> and<00:02:28.780> the

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
piece and here's an edge piece and the

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.170 
piece and here's an edge piece and the
torpedoes<00:02:30.100> are<00:02:30.280> curved<00:02:30.550> this<00:02:30.760> time<00:02:31.000> instead

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
torpedoes are curved this time instead

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.740 
torpedoes are curved this time instead
of<00:02:31.390> being<00:02:31.720> on<00:02:32.280> just<00:02:33.280> straight<00:02:33.760> this<00:02:34.360> one's<00:02:34.630> the

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
of being on just straight this one's the

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.350 
of being on just straight this one's the
way<00:02:35.050> long<00:02:35.290> and<00:02:35.739> this<00:02:36.340> was<00:02:36.520> the<00:02:36.700> first<00:02:37.120> cube

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
way long and this was the first cube

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.840 
way long and this was the first cube
they<00:02:37.480> had<00:02:37.600> i'm<00:02:38.110> going<00:02:38.320> to<00:02:38.380> go<00:02:38.470> ahead<00:02:38.500> and<00:02:38.850> move

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
they had i'm going to go ahead and move

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.780 
they had i'm going to go ahead and move
this<00:02:39.970> up<00:02:40.180> and<00:02:40.390> tension<00:02:40.989> it<00:02:41.519> work<00:02:42.519> with<00:02:42.670> it<00:02:42.700> a

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
this up and tension it work with it a

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.370 
this up and tension it work with it a
bit<00:02:42.820> and<00:02:43.120> then<00:02:43.299> come<00:02:43.660> back<00:02:43.690> and<00:02:43.840> tell<00:02:44.049> you<00:02:44.290> guys

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
bit and then come back and tell you guys

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.820 
bit and then come back and tell you guys
my<00:02:44.620> impressions<00:02:45.489> but<00:02:46.180> as<00:02:46.480> of<00:02:46.690> now<00:02:46.750> it<00:02:47.170> is

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
my impressions but as of now it is

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
you know it just feels like it needs

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.039 
you know it just feels like it needs
some<00:02:53.670> lovin<00:02:54.670> you<00:02:54.910> know<00:02:55.060> leuven<00:02:55.420> intention<00:02:55.900> and

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
some lovin you know leuven intention and

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:59.120 
some lovin you know leuven intention and
corner<00:02:56.980> cutting<00:02:57.190> oh<00:02:57.400> wow<00:02:57.970> out<00:02:58.239> of<00:02:58.360> the<00:02:58.450> box

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
corner cutting oh wow out of the box

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.199 
corner cutting oh wow out of the box
let's<00:03:00.130> try<00:03:00.400> this<00:03:00.459> side<00:03:01.290> that<00:03:02.290> is<00:03:02.350> 45<00:03:03.010> degrees

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
let's try this side that is 45 degrees

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:08.970 
let's try this side that is 45 degrees
and<00:03:04.290> reverse<00:03:05.290> a<00:03:06.090> little<00:03:07.090> bit<00:03:07.650> alright<00:03:08.650> guys<00:03:08.799> so

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
and reverse a little bit alright guys so

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.250 
and reverse a little bit alright guys so
I'm<00:03:09.040> going<00:03:09.190> to<00:03:09.220> go<00:03:09.340> ahead<00:03:09.400> and<00:03:09.489> do<00:03:09.700> that<00:03:09.730> and

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
I'm going to go ahead and do that and

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.080 
I'm going to go ahead and do that and
come<00:03:11.260> back<00:03:11.410> so<00:03:11.890> I<00:03:11.920> got<00:03:11.980> a<00:03:12.130> chance<00:03:12.459> to<00:03:12.790> lubricate

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
come back so I got a chance to lubricate

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.320 
come back so I got a chance to lubricate
this<00:03:13.450> puzzle<00:03:13.810> and<00:03:14.019> tension<00:03:14.590> it<00:03:14.709> and<00:03:15.090> also<00:03:16.090> just

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
this puzzle and tension it and also just

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.220 
this puzzle and tension it and also just
do<00:03:16.780> just<00:03:17.530> a<00:03:17.620> bunch<00:03:17.860> of<00:03:18.070> solves<00:03:18.430> on<00:03:18.549> this

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
do just a bunch of solves on this

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.280 
do just a bunch of solves on this
namaste<00:03:20.230> it's<00:03:20.920> a<00:03:21.160> nice<00:03:21.400> fuggle<00:03:22.140> that's<00:03:23.140> the

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
namaste it's a nice fuggle that's the

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.729 
namaste it's a nice fuggle that's the
white<00:03:23.440> perm<00:03:23.709> then<00:03:24.549> I'll<00:03:24.730> also<00:03:25.170> do<00:03:26.170> it<00:03:26.290> cheaper

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
white perm then I'll also do it cheaper

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:29.550 
white perm then I'll also do it cheaper
so<00:03:27.519> G<00:03:27.670> permanent<00:03:28.180> I<00:03:28.329> also<00:03:28.510> do<00:03:28.780> another<00:03:29.049> g<00:03:29.320> /

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
so G permanent I also do another g /

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:35.009 
so G permanent I also do another g /
start<00:03:30.519> over<00:03:30.700> okay<00:03:32.790> just<00:03:33.790> just<00:03:33.910> flow<00:03:34.480> so<00:03:34.780> nicely

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
start over okay just just flow so nicely

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:37.920 
start over okay just just flow so nicely
i<00:03:35.200> really<00:03:35.650> like<00:03:35.799> it<00:03:36.010> the<00:03:36.790> corner<00:03:37.090> cut<00:03:37.269> in<00:03:37.390> my

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
i really like it the corner cut in my

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.920 
i really like it the corner cut in my
huggle<00:03:38.560> 445

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.880 

yeah<00:03:42.920> about<00:03:43.159> 45<00:03:43.609> and<00:03:43.909> then<00:03:43.939> a<00:03:44.480> verse<00:03:44.890> it's

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
yeah about 45 and then a verse it's

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:49.630 
yeah about 45 and then a verse it's
about<00:03:45.980> maybe<00:03:46.370> there<00:03:47.709> may<00:03:48.709> be<00:03:48.739> about<00:03:48.980> there<00:03:49.280> for

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
about maybe there may be about there for

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:55.300 
about maybe there may be about there for
a<00:03:50.739> really<00:03:51.739> nice<00:03:52.040> puzzle<00:03:53.590> so<00:03:54.590> when<00:03:55.069> I'm<00:03:55.189> playing

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
a really nice puzzle so when I'm playing

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.670 
a really nice puzzle so when I'm playing
with<00:03:55.519> this<00:03:55.640> puzzle<00:03:56.060> I<00:03:56.239> was<00:03:56.989> thinking<00:03:57.170> you<00:03:57.650> know

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
with this puzzle I was thinking you know

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.289 
with this puzzle I was thinking you know
maybe<00:03:57.890> feels<00:03:58.219> like<00:03:58.370> a<00:03:58.400> lot<00:03:58.700> how<00:03:58.849> I<00:03:58.879> kind<00:03:59.209> of

00:03:59.289 --> 00:03:59.299 
maybe feels like a lot how I kind of

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:01.449 
maybe feels like a lot how I kind of
similar<00:03:59.510> to<00:03:59.810> a<00:03:59.840> lan<00:04:00.079> how<00:04:00.200> I<00:04:00.230> feel<00:04:00.560> and<00:04:01.250> then<00:04:01.370> I

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
similar to a lan how I feel and then I

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:03.220 
similar to a lan how I feel and then I
was<00:04:01.579> thinking<00:04:01.909> it's<00:04:02.239> also<00:04:02.510> similar<00:04:03.019> to<00:04:03.200> a

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
was thinking it's also similar to a

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.770 
was thinking it's also similar to a
pants<00:04:03.590> you<00:04:03.769> feel<00:04:04.010> so<00:04:04.909> I<00:04:04.939> go<00:04:05.180> to<00:04:05.209> play<00:04:05.510> with<00:04:05.659> that

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
pants you feel so I go to play with that

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.839 
pants you feel so I go to play with that
lon<00:04:05.989> voi<00:04:06.200> the<00:04:07.099> dying<00:04:07.370> envoy<00:04:08.319> then<00:04:09.319> went<00:04:09.739> back

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:09.849 
lon voi the dying envoy then went back

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:13.599 
lon voi the dying envoy then went back
your<00:04:10.849> way<00:04:11.000> long<00:04:11.209> and<00:04:11.569> I<00:04:12.439> was<00:04:12.799> like<00:04:13.010> no<00:04:13.280> not

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:13.609 
your way long and I was like no not

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:15.909 
your way long and I was like no not
quite<00:04:14.060> like<00:04:14.389> a<00:04:14.450> lot<00:04:14.780> higher<00:04:14.989> but<00:04:15.230> just<00:04:15.439> a<00:04:15.530> tiny

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:15.919 
quite like a lot higher but just a tiny

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:18.969 
quite like a lot higher but just a tiny
tiny<00:04:16.099> bit<00:04:16.570> then<00:04:17.570> I<00:04:17.750> go<00:04:17.900> to<00:04:17.930> play<00:04:18.199> with<00:04:18.380> panchi

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:18.979 
tiny bit then I go to play with panchi

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:21.089 
tiny bit then I go to play with panchi
and<00:04:19.430> I'm<00:04:19.699> just<00:04:19.910> thinking<00:04:20.000> wow<00:04:20.479> this<00:04:20.750> thing<00:04:20.989> is

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:21.099 
and I'm just thinking wow this thing is

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:24.600 
and I'm just thinking wow this thing is
bumpy<00:04:22.099> then<00:04:22.880> I<00:04:23.000> go<00:04:23.150> back<00:04:23.300> to<00:04:23.539> the<00:04:23.660> way<00:04:23.870> long

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
bumpy then I go back to the way long

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.790 
bumpy then I go back to the way long
it's<00:04:25.610> not<00:04:26.030> as<00:04:26.570> bumpy<00:04:26.840> at<00:04:27.110> the<00:04:27.199> pansy<00:04:27.590> at<00:04:27.710> all

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
it's not as bumpy at the pansy at all

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.230 
it's not as bumpy at the pansy at all
but<00:04:28.580> it<00:04:28.729> feels<00:04:28.910> like<00:04:29.060> a<00:04:29.210> mix<00:04:29.919> it's<00:04:30.919> like<00:04:31.240> close

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
but it feels like a mix it's like close

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.260 
but it feels like a mix it's like close
to<00:04:32.389> like<00:04:32.509> a<00:04:32.539> perfect<00:04:33.050> mix<00:04:33.259> of<00:04:33.470> the<00:04:33.620> two<00:04:34.270> it's

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270 
to like a perfect mix of the two it's

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.560 
to like a perfect mix of the two it's
just<00:04:35.509> great<00:04:35.780> and<00:04:37.090> for<00:04:38.090> those<00:04:38.180> of<00:04:38.240> you<00:04:38.419> that

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
just great and for those of you that

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.469 
just great and for those of you that
don't<00:04:38.810> like<00:04:39.020> the<00:04:39.169> panchi<00:04:40.060> don't<00:04:41.060> worry<00:04:41.240> you

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:41.479 
don't like the panchi don't worry you

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:43.629 
don't like the panchi don't worry you
you<00:04:41.750> this<00:04:42.229> cube<00:04:42.500> is<00:04:42.620> not<00:04:43.009> like<00:04:43.220> that<00:04:43.400> it's<00:04:43.580> just

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:43.639 
you this cube is not like that it's just

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:46.089 
you this cube is not like that it's just
a<00:04:43.820> little<00:04:44.180> bit<00:04:44.300> similar<00:04:44.539> with<00:04:45.229> them<00:04:45.440> just<00:04:45.889> hurt

00:04:46.089 --> 00:04:46.099 
a little bit similar with them just hurt

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:50.050 
a little bit similar with them just hurt
that<00:04:46.130> sort<00:04:47.090> of<00:04:47.120> a<00:04:47.240> bumpy<00:04:47.690> feel<00:04:47.930> to<00:04:48.139> it<00:04:48.909> but<00:04:49.909> it's

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
that sort of a bumpy feel to it but it's

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:51.670 
that sort of a bumpy feel to it but it's
just<00:04:50.150> the<00:04:50.360> right<00:04:50.720> amount<00:04:50.780> of<00:04:51.080> bumpy<00:04:51.409> I<00:04:51.440> guess

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
just the right amount of bumpy I guess

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.120 
just the right amount of bumpy I guess
it's<00:04:52.460> just<00:04:52.550> really<00:04:53.060> nice<00:04:53.300> I<00:04:53.710> love<00:04:54.710> this<00:04:54.830> in

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.130 
it's just really nice I love this in

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:56.800 
it's just really nice I love this in
fact<00:04:55.430> I'm<00:04:55.639> thinking<00:04:55.669> that<00:04:56.270> it's<00:04:56.449> going<00:04:56.570> to<00:04:56.630> be

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
fact I'm thinking that it's going to be

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:59.409 
fact I'm thinking that it's going to be
my<00:04:57.650> main<00:04:57.860> one<00:04:58.159> of<00:04:58.280> my<00:04:58.400> main<00:04:58.580> puzzles<00:04:59.000> actually

00:04:59.409 --> 00:04:59.419 
my main one of my main puzzles actually

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:01.170 
my main one of my main puzzles actually
because<00:04:59.599> it's<00:04:59.750> like<00:04:59.990> really<00:05:00.289> nice<00:05:00.590> actually

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
because it's like really nice actually

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.430 
because it's like really nice actually
and<00:05:02.180> I<00:05:02.270> said<00:05:02.330> actually<00:05:02.750> like<00:05:02.960> a<00:05:02.990> thousand

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 
and I said actually like a thousand

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:09.250 
and I said actually like a thousand
times<00:05:06.669> this<00:05:07.669> puzzle<00:05:08.150> corner<00:05:08.690> twisted<00:05:09.050> on<00:05:09.139> me

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:09.260 
times this puzzle corner twisted on me

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.560 
times this puzzle corner twisted on me
twice<00:05:09.500> and<00:05:09.949> that's<00:05:10.669> because<00:05:10.849> I<00:05:11.090> was<00:05:11.120> sort<00:05:11.479> of

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:11.570 
twice and that's because I was sort of

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:13.930 
twice and that's because I was sort of
working<00:05:11.840> with<00:05:12.050> tensions<00:05:12.590> not<00:05:13.280> sure<00:05:13.550> what

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:13.940 
working with tensions not sure what

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.620 
working with tensions not sure what
tensions<00:05:14.449> I<00:05:14.570> wanted<00:05:15.669> but<00:05:16.669> for<00:05:17.030> twisting

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:17.630 
tensions I wanted but for twisting

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:19.089 
tensions I wanted but for twisting
shouldn't<00:05:18.229> really<00:05:18.320> be<00:05:18.409> a<00:05:18.530> problem<00:05:18.770> on<00:05:18.979> this

00:05:19.089 --> 00:05:19.099 
shouldn't really be a problem on this

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:23.700 
shouldn't really be a problem on this
puzzle<00:05:19.370> seems<00:05:20.270> to<00:05:20.770> be<00:05:21.770> just<00:05:22.039> great<00:05:22.310> just<00:05:22.370> fine

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710 
puzzle seems to be just great just fine

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:25.899 
puzzle seems to be just great just fine
locking<00:05:24.710> up<00:05:24.830> is<00:05:24.979> not<00:05:25.099> much<00:05:25.370> on<00:05:25.610> this<00:05:25.729> puzzle

00:05:25.899 --> 00:05:25.909 
locking up is not much on this puzzle

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:28.899 
locking up is not much on this puzzle
either<00:05:26.710> sometimes<00:05:27.710> I<00:05:27.830> do<00:05:27.889> overshoot<00:05:28.520> and<00:05:28.759> I

00:05:28.899 --> 00:05:28.909 
either sometimes I do overshoot and I

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:31.390 
either sometimes I do overshoot and I
try<00:05:29.120> to<00:05:29.150> maybe<00:05:29.810> do<00:05:29.960> a<00:05:29.990> turn<00:05:30.229> and<00:05:30.470> then<00:05:31.099> of

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:31.400 
try to maybe do a turn and then of

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.159 
try to maybe do a turn and then of
course<00:05:31.490> it's<00:05:31.820> going<00:05:31.880> to<00:05:32.030> lock<00:05:32.180> up<00:05:32.330> other<00:05:32.990> than

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:33.169 
course it's going to lock up other than

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:35.800 
course it's going to lock up other than
that<00:05:33.229> not<00:05:33.800> much<00:05:33.830> of<00:05:34.460> a<00:05:34.550> locking<00:05:34.940> puzzle<00:05:35.270> it

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:35.810 
that not much of a locking puzzle it

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:39.820 
that not much of a locking puzzle it
doesn't<00:05:36.169> pop<00:05:36.289> either<00:05:37.210> it's<00:05:38.210> just<00:05:38.830> over

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:39.830 
doesn't pop either it's just over

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:41.350 
doesn't pop either it's just over
overall<00:05:40.340> it's<00:05:40.490> a<00:05:40.550> really<00:05:40.580> nice<00:05:40.940> puzzle

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 
overall it's a really nice puzzle

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.510 
overall it's a really nice puzzle
actually<00:05:41.750> I've<00:05:42.500> only<00:05:42.710> had<00:05:42.889> it<00:05:42.949> for<00:05:43.099> less<00:05:43.400> than

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:43.520 
actually I've only had it for less than

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.790 
actually I've only had it for less than
a<00:05:43.639> day<00:05:43.669> so<00:05:44.449> I<00:05:44.539> can't<00:05:44.750> just<00:05:44.990> assume<00:05:45.500> that<00:05:45.680> this

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:45.800 
a day so I can't just assume that this

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.910 
a day so I can't just assume that this
puzzle<00:05:46.130> is<00:05:46.190> super<00:05:46.639> great

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:47.920 
puzzle is super great

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:52.440 
puzzle is super great
but<00:05:48.760> as<00:05:49.000> of<00:05:49.300> now<00:05:49.440> it's<00:05:50.440> super<00:05:50.950> great<00:05:51.270> I'm<00:05:52.270> going

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:52.450 
but as of now it's super great I'm going

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:55.050 
but as of now it's super great I'm going
to<00:05:52.510> go<00:05:52.660> ahead<00:05:52.690> and<00:05:52.870> do<00:05:53.440> a<00:05:53.470> self<00:05:53.890> just<00:05:54.850> so<00:05:54.970> you

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:55.060 
to go ahead and do a self just so you

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.270 
to go ahead and do a self just so you
can<00:05:55.180> see<00:05:55.360> how<00:05:55.390> the<00:05:55.600> puzzle<00:05:56.020> performs<00:05:56.500> while

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:57.280 
can see how the puzzle performs while

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:07.740 
can see how the puzzle performs while
it's<00:05:57.490> being<00:05:57.640> solved<00:06:02.640> all<00:06:03.640> right<00:06:03.940> oh<00:06:06.750> whoops

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:07.750 
it's being solved all right oh whoops

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:39.270 
it's being solved all right oh whoops
okay<00:06:08.820> time<00:06:09.820> is<00:06:10.000> set<00:06:10.180> to<00:06:10.390> zero<00:06:37.740> that's<00:06:38.740> okay<00:06:39.010> I

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:39.280 
okay time is set to zero that's okay I

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:46.080 
okay time is set to zero that's okay I
got<00:06:39.910> 18<00:06:41.490> seconds<00:06:42.490> I<00:06:42.760> made<00:06:43.510> a<00:06:43.540> widow<00:06:44.790> maybe<00:06:45.790> two

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:46.090 
got 18 seconds I made a widow maybe two

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:48.890 
got 18 seconds I made a widow maybe two
or<00:06:46.120> three<00:06:46.270> mistakes<00:06:46.780> during<00:06:47.170> to<00:06:47.350> solve<00:06:47.850> but

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:48.900 
or three mistakes during to solve but

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:51.030 
or three mistakes during to solve but
basically<00:06:49.900> this<00:06:50.230> puzzle<00:06:50.620> is<00:06:50.650> really<00:06:50.920> nice

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:01.830 
really want to use this overall my
puzzles<00:07:00.490> that<00:07:00.580> I<00:07:00.700> have<00:07:00.940> because<00:07:01.210> this<00:07:01.630> is<00:07:01.810> just

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:01.840 
puzzles that I have because this is just

I'll<00:07:05.800> get<00:07:05.920> a<00:07:05.950> puzzle<00:07:06.190> and<00:07:06.520> I'm<00:07:06.880> quite<00:07:07.570> not

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:07.840 
I'll get a puzzle and I'm quite not

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.920 
I'll get a puzzle and I'm quite not
satisfied<00:07:08.500> but<00:07:09.430> i<00:07:09.760> think<00:07:10.390> i<00:07:10.480> might<00:07:10.600> just<00:07:10.810> be

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:10.930

satisfied but i think i might just be
satisfied<00:07:11.380> of<00:07:11.500> this<00:07:11.620> actually<00:07:11.830> it's<00:07:12.580> pretty
