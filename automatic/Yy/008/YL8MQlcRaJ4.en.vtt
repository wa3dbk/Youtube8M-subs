00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.140 
perception out here would be that maybe
the<00:05:24.290> rest<00:05:24.500> of<00:05:24.680> the<00:05:24.860> kind<00:05:25.190> of<00:05:25.310> set<00:05:25.490> off

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.150 
the rest of the kind of set off

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:28.990 
the rest of the kind of set off
happens<00:05:26.750> is<00:05:27.680> that<00:05:27.710> not<00:05:28.070> the<00:05:28.100> case<00:05:28.370> for<00:05:28.790> your

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 
happens is that not the case for your

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.780 
happens is that not the case for your
grief<00:05:29.270> I<00:05:29.840> love<00:05:30.470> it<00:05:30.620> this<00:05:31.340> is<00:05:31.460> would<00:05:31.550> be<00:05:31.640> hard

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:31.790 
grief I love it this is would be hard

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:37.600 
grief I love it this is would be hard
enough<00:05:31.970> no<00:05:32.150> matter<00:05:32.300> who's<00:05:35.920> we<00:05:36.920> knew<00:05:37.160> you<00:05:37.490> know

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:37.610 
enough no matter who's we knew you know

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:39.700 
enough no matter who's we knew you know
yeah<00:05:37.910> you<00:05:37.970> know<00:05:38.150> you<00:05:38.300> can't<00:05:38.960> hide<00:05:39.320> it<00:05:39.530> there

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:39.710 
yeah you know you can't hide it there

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:41.650 
yeah you know you can't hide it there
they're<00:05:39.950> going<00:05:40.190> to<00:05:40.250> be<00:05:40.370> there<00:05:41.120> much<00:05:41.450> better

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:41.660 
they're going to be there much better

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:44.250 
they're going to be there much better
team<00:05:42.020> and<00:05:42.290> I<00:05:42.590> think<00:05:42.860> they<00:05:43.070> have<00:05:43.100> one<00:05:43.550> of<00:05:43.640> the

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:44.260 
team and I think they have one of the

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.960 
team and I think they have one of the
smartest<00:05:45.260> point<00:05:45.620> guards<00:05:45.980> ever<00:05:46.220> to<00:05:46.520> play<00:05:46.700> he

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:46.970 
smartest point guards ever to play he

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:49.780 
smartest point guards ever to play he
makes<00:05:47.210> passes<00:05:47.600> on<00:05:48.080> with<00:05:48.320> either<00:05:48.590> hand<00:05:48.710> and<00:05:49.220> in

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:49.790 
makes passes on with either hand and in

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:52.180 
makes passes on with either hand and in
between<00:05:50.030> many<00:05:50.510> defenders<00:05:51.080> and<00:05:51.410> he's<00:05:51.770> one<00:05:52.100> of

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:52.190 
between many defenders and he's one of

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:54.460 
between many defenders and he's one of
the<00:05:52.250> best<00:05:52.490> shooters<00:05:52.970> and<00:05:53.150> the<00:05:53.750> thing<00:05:54.020> that<00:05:54.050> I

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:54.470 
the best shooters and the thing that I

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:58.030 
the best shooters and the thing that I
like<00:05:54.770> about<00:05:55.180> Steve<00:05:56.180> Nash<00:05:56.480> that<00:05:56.780> he's<00:05:57.770> so

00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:58.040 
like about Steve Nash that he's so

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.400 
like about Steve Nash that he's so
unselfish<00:05:58.280> she<00:05:58.940> can<00:05:59.150> he<00:05:59.300> passes<00:05:59.870> up<00:06:00.050> so<00:06:00.290> many

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:00.410 
unselfish she can he passes up so many

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:02.800 
unselfish she can he passes up so many
open<00:06:00.770> shouts<00:06:01.010> that<00:06:01.280> he<00:06:01.940> probably<00:06:02.240> won't<00:06:02.570> pass

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:02.810 
open shouts that he probably won't pass
