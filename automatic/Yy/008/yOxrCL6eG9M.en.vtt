00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.130
 This time 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:16.049
 Let's take a look at 12bit slow lock method. 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:17.880
 Slow rock is also known as rock ballad, 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:24.439
 It's accompaniment. 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:29.099
 Normally , a copy of 2 people per night does not get a table with one color. 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:34.530
 It is a rhythm that plays four beats while playing 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:39.540
 The first and third notes of the first and third nights are generally jumbo 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.770
 If you play with the accent on the first and second notes in the second and fourth pillar 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.460
 It's possible 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:49.410
 Accent I'd also put the map movement is playing 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:52.710
 We have a lute in the accent , 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:58.260
 I'll try playing. 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:01:01.230
 Ah 2 3 4 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:05.760
 Let's play a little soon. 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:10.020
 Other 4 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:12.830
 Tendeyo once we see the repeated practice with a simple two codes 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:16.820
 2 9 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:21.720
 In a mode, when you finger your finger 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:26.930
 The repeated practice by al icon will try to once 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.930
 Let's try playing some basic with this code 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:49.270
 Let's play a little red . 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:49.270
 to to a tool 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:02.219
 This time , 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:10.569
 By putting a sixteenth note in the middle third beat 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:16.440
 Haha 2 3 4 Let's play with this kind of application 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:16.440
 Let's try playing slowly with the cord in hand. 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.170
 I'll try to do it a little sooner . 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.000
 Thank you. 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:42.150
 This time, give it to me. 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.129
