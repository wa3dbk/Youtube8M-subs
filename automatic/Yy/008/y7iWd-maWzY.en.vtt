clay cabochon that's right the technique

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.339 
clay cabochon that's right the technique
to<00:00:08.220> I'm<00:00:08.400> using<00:00:08.610> today<00:00:08.970> is<00:00:09.059> called<00:00:09.120> mokume<00:00:10.080> Gani

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
to I'm using today is called mokume Gani

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:11.390 
to I'm using today is called mokume Gani
okay

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
okay

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.950 
okay
it's<00:00:11.550> you<00:00:11.759> ancient<00:00:12.030> metal<00:00:12.570> smithing

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
it's you ancient metal smithing

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.079 
it's you ancient metal smithing
technique<00:00:13.469> with<00:00:13.830> the<00:00:14.009> samurai<00:00:14.340> swordsmen

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
technique with the samurai swordsmen

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.990 
technique with the samurai swordsmen
used<00:00:15.420> to<00:00:15.690> make<00:00:15.839> their<00:00:16.049> swords<00:00:16.440> stronger<00:00:17.310> so

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
used to make their swords stronger so

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.210 
used to make their swords stronger so
they<00:00:18.150> would<00:00:18.390> meld<00:00:19.170> pieces<00:00:19.590> of<00:00:19.740> metal<00:00:20.039> together

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
they would meld pieces of metal together

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.730 
they would meld pieces of metal together
and<00:00:21.090> then<00:00:21.300> because<00:00:21.869> of<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:22.080> pattern<00:00:22.350> that<00:00:22.590> was

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
and then because of the pattern that was

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.130 
and then because of the pattern that was
formed<00:00:23.070> by<00:00:23.189> doing<00:00:23.550> that<00:00:23.699> when<00:00:24.510> they<00:00:24.689> formed

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
formed by doing that when they formed

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.960 
formed by doing that when they formed
the<00:00:25.260> swords<00:00:25.650> it<00:00:25.830> gave<00:00:26.310> it<00:00:26.430> a<00:00:26.490> very<00:00:26.640> interesting

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
the swords it gave it a very interesting

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.089 
the swords it gave it a very interesting
pattern<00:00:27.390> and<00:00:28.080> it's<00:00:28.349> a<00:00:28.439> great<00:00:28.680> thing<00:00:28.890> to<00:00:28.980> do

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
pattern and it's a great thing to do

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.250 
pattern and it's a great thing to do
with<00:00:29.130> polymer<00:00:29.609> clay<00:00:29.730> okay<00:00:30.300> let's<00:00:30.630> get<00:00:30.779> started

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
with polymer clay okay let's get started

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.979 
with polymer clay okay let's get started
alright<00:00:31.560> so<00:00:31.949> I've<00:00:32.070> taken<00:00:32.309> orange<00:00:32.969> white<00:00:33.630> and

alright so I've taken orange white and

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.229 
alright so I've taken orange white and
magenta<00:00:34.440> clay<00:00:35.040> and<00:00:35.460> we're<00:00:35.550> gonna<00:00:35.670> stack<00:00:36.030> I'm

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
magenta clay and we're gonna stack I'm

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.630 
magenta clay and we're gonna stack I'm
just<00:00:36.510> like<00:00:36.630> they<00:00:36.780> did<00:00:36.840> with<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.230> metal<00:00:37.640> so

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
just like they did with the metal so

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.680 
just like they did with the metal so
we're<00:00:38.760> gonna<00:00:38.850> put<00:00:39.059> them<00:00:39.149> right<00:00:39.180> on<00:00:39.360> top<00:00:39.660> of

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
we're gonna put them right on top of

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.799 
we're gonna put them right on top of
each<00:00:39.899> other<00:00:40.020> these<00:00:40.350> are<00:00:40.410> very<00:00:40.860> thin<00:00:41.480> pieces<00:00:42.480> of

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
each other these are very thin pieces of

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.830 
each other these are very thin pieces of
clay<00:00:43.670> now<00:00:44.670> how<00:00:44.820> did<00:00:44.969> you<00:00:45.000> get<00:00:45.210> himself<00:00:45.360> in<00:00:45.690> did

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
you I use the pasta maker yeah I'm gonna

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.880 
you I use the pasta maker yeah I'm gonna
use<00:00:48.360> that<00:00:48.539> right<00:00:48.690> now<00:00:48.840> because<00:00:49.200> I<00:00:49.350> want<00:00:49.649> these

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
use that right now because I want these

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.610 
use that right now because I want these
to<00:00:50.219> be<00:00:50.340> even<00:00:50.670> thinner<00:00:51.000> so<00:00:51.870> by<00:00:52.079> running<00:00:52.320> them

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
to be even thinner so by running them

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.290 
to be even thinner so by running them
I've<00:00:52.890> got<00:00:52.949> them<00:00:53.309> stacked<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:54.000> by<00:00:54.120> running

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
I've got them stacked and by running

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.270 
I've got them stacked and by running
them<00:00:54.570> through<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.870> pasta<00:00:55.260> machine<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.770> you

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
them through the pasta machine and you

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.939 
them through the pasta machine and you
want<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.610> start<00:00:56.969> on<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.690> medium<00:00:58.289> setting<00:00:58.770> and

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
want to start on a medium setting and

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.619 
want to start on a medium setting and
get<00:00:59.160> thinner<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.699> thinner<00:00:59.760> and<00:01:00.120> thinner<00:01:00.180> so

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
get thinner and thinner and thinner so

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.299 
get thinner and thinner and thinner so
you'll<00:01:00.780> just<00:01:01.020> adjust<00:01:01.410> your<00:01:01.500> pasta<00:01:01.980> machine

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
you'll just adjust your pasta machine

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.549 
you'll just adjust your pasta machine
and<00:01:02.550> then<00:01:03.059> run<00:01:03.390> it<00:01:03.539> through<00:01:03.570> again<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.439> then

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
and then run it through again and then

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.350 
and then run it through again and then
adjust<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:04.949> pasta<00:01:05.309> machine<00:01:05.430> till<00:01:06.090> we<00:01:06.180> get<00:01:06.330> a

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
adjust the pasta machine till we get a

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.270 
adjust the pasta machine till we get a
nice<00:01:06.630> thin<00:01:06.960> layer<00:01:06.990> like<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.650> how<00:01:07.799> many<00:01:07.979> times

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
nice thin layer like and how many times

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.190 
nice thin layer like and how many times
approximately<00:01:08.640> it'll<00:01:09.510> go<00:01:09.630> through<00:01:09.810> four<00:01:10.049> more

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
approximately it'll go through four more

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.590 
approximately it'll go through four more
times<00:01:10.380> from<00:01:10.860> medium<00:01:11.850> setting<00:01:12.270> getting

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
times from medium setting getting

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.000 
times from medium setting getting
thinner<00:01:13.020> four<00:01:13.380> more<00:01:13.560> times

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
thinner four more times

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.740 
thinner four more times
okay<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:14.909> then<00:01:15.030> we're<00:01:15.119> gonna<00:01:15.240> cut<00:01:15.509> it<00:01:15.540> into

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
okay and then we're gonna cut it into

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.260 
okay and then we're gonna cut it into
thirds<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.560> then<00:01:17.369> we're<00:01:17.490> gonna<00:01:17.580> add<00:01:17.970> a<00:01:18.000> little

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
thirds and then we're gonna add a little

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.890 
thirds and then we're gonna add a little
metal<00:01:18.960> embellishment<00:01:19.740> by<00:01:20.180> adding<00:01:21.180> some<00:01:21.600> metal

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
metal embellishment by adding some metal

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.469 
metal embellishment by adding some metal
leaf<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.380> it<00:01:22.560> now<00:01:23.460> this<00:01:23.640> metal<00:01:23.939> leaf<00:01:24.090> flies

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
leaf to it now this metal leaf flies

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.109 
leaf to it now this metal leaf flies
around<00:01:24.780> all<00:01:25.140> over<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.439> place<00:01:25.470> so<00:01:25.740> I<00:01:25.799> cheated

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:33.499 

good<00:01:30.229> so<00:01:31.229> let's<00:01:31.439> move<00:01:31.650> that<00:01:31.979> one<00:01:32.189> over<00:01:32.340> okay<00:01:33.090> so

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
good so let's move that one over okay so

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.149 
good so let's move that one over okay so
you<00:01:33.570> just<00:01:33.600> place<00:01:33.960> it<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.409> square<00:01:34.710> root<00:01:34.829> on<00:01:34.920> top

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
you just place it the square root on top

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.789 
you just place it the square root on top
of<00:01:35.310> it<00:01:35.400> right<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.909> then<00:01:36.360> make<00:01:36.960> sure<00:01:37.200> you<00:01:37.530> rub

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
of it right and then make sure you rub

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.499 
of it right and then make sure you rub
it<00:01:37.950> in<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.310> get<00:01:38.430> all<00:01:38.579> those<00:01:38.759> air<00:01:38.939> pockets<00:01:38.970> out

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
it in to get all those air pockets out

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.649 
it in to get all those air pockets out
and<00:01:40.290> then<00:01:40.560> we're<00:01:40.799> gonna<00:01:40.920> stack<00:01:41.369> those<00:01:41.670> right

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
and then we're gonna stack those right

so<00:03:31.110> is<00:03:31.290> this<00:03:31.440> wax<00:03:31.709> paper<00:03:31.920> no<00:03:32.550> it's<00:03:32.790> you<00:03:33.209> could

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
so is this wax paper no it's you could

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:34.940 
so is this wax paper no it's you could
use<00:03:33.510> more<00:03:33.690> of<00:03:33.750> the<00:03:33.870> waxing<00:03:34.290> yes<00:03:34.530> there's<00:03:34.770> more

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
use more of the waxing yes there's more

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.710 
use more of the waxing yes there's more
plastic<00:03:35.370> right<00:03:35.520> like<00:03:35.880> a<00:03:35.910> saran<00:03:36.270> wrap<00:03:36.510> or

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
plastic right like a saran wrap or

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.000 
plastic right like a saran wrap or
something<00:03:36.840> like<00:03:37.140> that<00:03:37.320> okay<00:03:37.770> and<00:03:37.890> then<00:03:37.980> just

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
something like that okay and then just

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.670 
something like that okay and then just
using<00:03:38.520> your<00:03:38.610> cookie<00:03:38.970> cutter<00:03:39.000> if<00:03:39.660> you<00:03:40.200> press

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
using your cookie cutter if you press

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.120 
using your cookie cutter if you press
down<00:03:40.709> in<00:03:41.930> and<00:03:42.930> then<00:03:43.260> we're<00:03:43.380> gonna<00:03:43.500> take<00:03:43.890> that

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
down in and then we're gonna take that

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:48.650 
down in and then we're gonna take that
off<00:03:44.190> and<00:03:45.380> peel<00:03:46.380> all<00:03:46.650> this<00:03:46.830> away<00:03:47.480> you<00:03:48.480> have

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
off and peel all this away you have

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.229 
off and peel all this away you have
those<00:03:48.870> beautiful<00:03:49.260> beveled<00:03:49.980> edges<00:03:50.239> much

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
those beautiful beveled edges much

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:52.759 
those beautiful beveled edges much
better<00:03:51.540> than<00:03:51.720> just<00:03:51.930> doing<00:03:52.019> a<00:03:52.260> straight<00:03:52.530> cookie

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
better than just doing a straight cookie

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:53.870 
better than just doing a straight cookie
better<00:03:53.100> mm-hmm

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
better mm-hmm

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.000 
better mm-hmm
now<00:03:54.150> we're<00:03:54.570> gonna<00:03:54.690> use<00:03:54.959> the<00:03:55.140> hilltribe<00:03:55.470> silver

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
now we're gonna use the hilltribe silver

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.479 
now we're gonna use the hilltribe silver
it<00:03:56.880> has<00:03:57.120> these<00:03:57.300> beading<00:03:57.870> loops<00:03:58.140> in<00:03:58.470> it<00:03:58.500> polymer

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
it has these beading loops in it polymer

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:00.949 
it has these beading loops in it polymer
clay<00:03:59.640> artists<00:04:00.060> are<00:04:00.120> always<00:04:00.330> looking<00:04:00.720> for<00:04:00.930> a

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
clay artists are always looking for a

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.860 
clay artists are always looking for a
way<00:04:01.019> to<00:04:01.200> attach<00:04:01.800> things<00:04:02.280> without<00:04:03.180> using<00:04:03.780> an

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
way to attach things without using an

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.680 
way to attach things without using an
adhesive<00:04:04.019> yes<00:04:04.739> and<00:04:05.220> so<00:04:05.580> these<00:04:05.940> little<00:04:06.180> beading

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
adhesive yes and so these little beading

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.199 
adhesive yes and so these little beading
loops<00:04:06.930> are<00:04:07.170> perfect<00:04:07.800> for<00:04:08.010> that<00:04:08.190> because<00:04:08.550> you

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
loops are perfect for that because you

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:11.360 
loops are perfect for that because you
can<00:04:09.360> insert<00:04:09.780> just<00:04:10.110> little<00:04:10.410> scrap<00:04:10.739> pieces<00:04:11.010> of

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
can insert just little scrap pieces of

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.540 
can insert just little scrap pieces of
polymer<00:04:11.820> clay<00:04:12.000> like<00:04:12.870> I've<00:04:13.050> done<00:04:13.260> here<00:04:13.489> so<00:04:14.489> I'm

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.550 
polymer clay like I've done here so I'm

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:16.039 
polymer clay like I've done here so I'm
gonna<00:04:14.640> reach<00:04:14.850> around<00:04:15.150> here<00:04:15.420> and<00:04:15.660> that's

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
gonna reach around here and that's

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:17.810 
gonna reach around here and that's
what's<00:04:16.380> gonna<00:04:16.530> be<00:04:16.680> like<00:04:16.830> that's<00:04:17.400> what's<00:04:17.669> gonna

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
what's gonna be like that's what's gonna

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.880 
what's gonna be like that's what's gonna
hold<00:04:18.030> it<00:04:18.239> because<00:04:18.510> when<00:04:18.690> it's<00:04:18.840> baked<00:04:19.230> look<00:04:19.799> at

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:19.890 
hold it because when it's baked look at

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.159 
hold it because when it's baked look at
that<00:04:19.980> will<00:04:20.130> all<00:04:20.310> become<00:04:20.519> solid<00:04:21.209> so<00:04:21.419> this<00:04:21.930> will

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
that will all become solid so this will

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:23.150 
that will all become solid so this will
adhere<00:04:22.320> to<00:04:22.620> this

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
adhere to this

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.860 
adhere to this
I<00:04:23.190> don't<00:04:23.669> having<00:04:23.880> to<00:04:23.940> use<00:04:24.030> glue<00:04:24.300> that's<00:04:24.570> right

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
I don't having to use glue that's right

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.100 
I don't having to use glue that's right
oh<00:04:24.900> my<00:04:25.200> goodness<00:04:25.560> that's<00:04:25.740> right<00:04:25.979> yet

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
oh my goodness that's right yet

oh my goodness that's right yet
we're<00:04:29.110> just<00:04:29.320> gonna<00:04:29.440> place<00:04:29.740> our<00:04:29.920> cabochons

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
we're just gonna place our cabochons

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:31.920 
we're just gonna place our cabochons
right<00:04:30.790> on<00:04:30.940> top<00:04:31.210> of<00:04:31.240> there

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
right on top of there

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.950 
right on top of there
and<00:04:32.320> it's<00:04:33.160> basically<00:04:33.700> adhering<00:04:34.660> to<00:04:34.690> clay

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
and it's basically adhering to clay

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.900 
and it's basically adhering to clay
that's<00:04:35.230> right<00:04:35.590> and<00:04:35.890> so<00:04:36.130> that<00:04:36.400> will<00:04:36.550> keep<00:04:36.730> a

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
that's right and so that will keep a

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.000 
that's right and so that will keep a
firm<00:04:37.180> bond<00:04:37.540> and<00:04:37.930> then<00:04:38.320> I<00:04:38.350> just<00:04:38.590> use<00:04:38.770> a<00:04:38.800> regular

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.010 
firm bond and then I just use a regular

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:41.190 
firm bond and then I just use a regular
piece<00:04:39.460> of<00:04:39.490> typing<00:04:40.000> paper<00:04:40.060> and<00:04:40.690> I'll<00:04:40.810> flip<00:04:41.080> it

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:41.200 
piece of typing paper and I'll flip it

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.040 
piece of typing paper and I'll flip it
over<00:04:41.380> and<00:04:41.740> by<00:04:42.310> pressing<00:04:42.820> it<00:04:42.940> down<00:04:43.180> it<00:04:43.660> gives<00:04:43.810> us

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
over and by pressing it down it gives us

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.320 
over and by pressing it down it gives us
a<00:04:44.200> nice<00:04:44.350> top<00:04:44.710> with<00:04:44.950> no<00:04:45.100> fingerprints<00:04:45.880> because

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330

that<00:05:18.610> you<00:05:18.730> can<00:05:18.850> use<00:05:19.030> right<00:05:19.090> remember<00:05:19.840> earlier

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:20.350 
that you can use right remember earlier

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:22.170 
that you can use right remember earlier
when<00:05:20.530> we<00:05:20.590> did<00:05:20.830> the<00:05:21.010> polymer<00:05:21.490> clay<00:05:21.610> caning

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:22.180 
when we did the polymer clay caning

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.030 
when we did the polymer clay caning
mm-hmm<00:05:22.780> those<00:05:23.170> are<00:05:23.380> all<00:05:23.500> done<00:05:23.680> with<00:05:23.860> that

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:24.040 
mm-hmm those are all done with that

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.540 
mm-hmm those are all done with that
caning

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:24.550 
caning

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.120 
caning
so<00:05:25.180> you<00:05:25.300> can<00:05:25.480> use<00:05:25.660> that<00:05:25.840> forgo<00:05:26.260> any<00:05:26.650> polymer

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.130 
so you can use that forgo any polymer

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:28.830 
so you can use that forgo any polymer
clay<00:05:27.340> technique<00:05:27.820> will<00:05:27.970> work<00:05:28.000> with<00:05:28.330> this<00:05:28.510> those

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:28.840 
clay technique will work with this those

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.840 
clay technique will work with this those
are<00:05:29.200> fantastic

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:30.850 
are fantastic

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:33.300 
are fantastic
Judy<00:05:31.720> these<00:05:31.870> are<00:05:32.020> effective<00:05:32.590> hey<00:05:32.740> thank<00:05:33.220> you

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:35.620 
so much you know I this is makes polymer

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.130 
so much you know I this is makes polymer
clay<00:05:35.830> so<00:05:36.430> easy<00:05:36.760> to<00:05:37.120> me<00:05:37.270> good<00:05:37.570> I'm<00:05:37.780> glad

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:38.140 
clay so easy to me good I'm glad

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:40.740 
clay so easy to me good I'm glad
yeah<00:05:38.410> a<00:05:38.440> rubber<00:05:38.800> stamp<00:05:39.130> a<00:05:39.310> cookie<00:05:39.670> cutter<00:05:39.910> some
