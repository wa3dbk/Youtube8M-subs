00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
but sliding and vibrato got to a vibrato

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.730 
but sliding and vibrato got to a vibrato
in<00:00:03.870> a<00:00:03.959> minute<00:00:04.230> but<00:00:04.440> sliding<00:00:04.859> is<00:00:06.290> never<00:00:07.290> sounds

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
burrata now there are a few ways of

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.810 
burrata now there are a few ways of
playing<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.619> burrata<00:00:25.859> there's<00:00:26.220> kind<00:00:26.609> of<00:00:26.670> the

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
playing the burrata there's kind of the

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.609 
playing the burrata there's kind of the
standard<00:00:27.210> rock<00:00:27.840> vibrato<00:00:29.330> which<00:00:30.330> is<00:00:30.630> bending

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
standard rock vibrato which is bending

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.250 
standard rock vibrato which is bending
the<00:00:31.650> string<00:00:31.859> up<00:00:32.820> and<00:00:33.239> down<00:00:33.510> like<00:00:33.750> that

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
the string up and down like that

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.459 
the string up and down like that
you<00:00:35.160> can<00:00:35.309> see<00:00:35.489> a<00:00:35.520> little<00:00:35.640> bit<00:00:35.790> clearly<00:00:36.300> up<00:00:36.960> and

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
you can see a little bit clearly up and

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.770 
you can see a little bit clearly up and
down<00:00:37.649> I<00:00:38.149> thought<00:00:39.469> I'm<00:00:40.640> now<00:00:41.640> on<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:41.879> fret<00:00:42.210> base<00:00:42.480> on

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
down I thought I'm now on a fret base on

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:49.819 
down I thought I'm now on a fret base on
electric<00:00:43.320> guitar<00:00:48.320> sounds<00:00:49.320> alright<00:00:49.440> but<00:00:49.680> on<00:00:49.800> a

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
electric guitar sounds alright but on a

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.389 
electric guitar sounds alright but on a
fretless<00:00:50.250> you<00:00:51.120> seem<00:00:51.329> to<00:00:51.570> go<00:00:52.129> sometimes<00:00:53.129> that

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
fretless you seem to go sometimes that

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.279 
fretless you seem to go sometimes that
it<00:00:53.760> can<00:00:53.940> bend<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.360> pitch<00:00:54.510> too<00:00:54.780> much<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.199> then

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
it can bend the pitch too much and then

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.430 
it can bend the pitch too much and then
you<00:00:55.350> go<00:00:55.469> out<00:00:55.620> of<00:00:55.710> tune<00:00:56.329> now<00:00:57.329> there<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:58.109> other

you go out of tune now there the other
way<00:00:58.680> of<00:00:58.859> playing<00:00:59.100> vibrato<00:00:59.520> which<00:00:59.850> I

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
way of playing vibrato which I

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.479 
way of playing vibrato which I
instinctively<00:01:00.930> do<00:01:01.320> all<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.710> time<00:01:01.920> now<00:01:02.160> thanks

the<00:01:48.320> fingerboard<00:01:48.710> back<00:01:49.160> and<00:01:49.370> forth<00:01:49.610> so<00:01:50.300> it

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
the fingerboard back and forth so it

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:56.530 
the fingerboard back and forth so it
slightly<00:01:51.200> alters<00:01:51.620> the<00:01:51.770> pitch<00:01:55.180> see<00:01:56.180> if<00:01:56.240> I<00:01:56.300> do<00:01:56.360> it

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
slightly alters the pitch see if I do it

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.070 
slightly alters the pitch see if I do it
really<00:01:56.690> slowly<00:01:58.690> notice<00:01:59.690> how<00:01:59.810> it's<00:01:59.930> coming

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
really slowly notice how it's coming

really slowly notice how it's coming
sharp<00:02:00.440> and<00:02:00.650> flat<00:02:00.830> Java<00:02:02.979> and<00:02:03.979> you<00:02:04.010> speed<00:02:04.940> that

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
sharp and flat Java and you speed that

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.580 
sharp and flat Java and you speed that
up<00:02:05.920> into<00:02:06.920> one<00:02:07.400> motion<00:02:08.110> now<00:02:09.110> you<00:02:09.170> don't<00:02:09.500> even

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
up into one motion now you don't even

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:10.990 
up into one motion now you don't even
really<00:02:09.860> need<00:02:09.979> your<00:02:10.220> thumb<00:02:10.429> on<00:02:10.580> the<00:02:10.670> back<00:02:10.789> of

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
just go and of course you can change the

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.510 
just go and of course you can change the
speed<00:02:21.620> of<00:02:21.800> it<00:02:22.270> say<00:02:23.270> for<00:02:23.420> example<00:02:23.810> if<00:02:24.520> you've

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
speed of it say for example if you've

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:34.080 
speed of it say for example if you've
got<00:02:27.700> let's<00:02:28.700> say<00:02:28.850> we<00:02:29.090> do<00:02:29.420> here<00:02:29.959> on<00:02:30.080> the<00:02:30.170> g<00:02:30.350> string

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:39.130 

just<00:02:35.090> doing<00:02:35.360> rundown<00:02:35.750> I<00:02:36.260> just<00:02:36.470> go<00:02:37.900> you<00:02:38.900> can<00:02:39.050> do

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
just doing rundown I just go you can do

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.620 
just doing rundown I just go you can do
nice<00:02:39.290> slow<00:02:39.709> vibrato<00:02:40.040> now<00:02:43.390> say<00:02:44.390> if<00:02:44.510> you're

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
nice slow vibrato now say if you're

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.650 
nice slow vibrato now say if you're
doing<00:02:44.660> something<00:02:45.350> kind<00:02:45.530> of<00:02:45.650> funky<00:02:46.660> just

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
doing something kind of funky just

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:57.820 
doing something kind of funky just
making<00:02:47.930> it<00:02:48.050> kind<00:02:48.620> of<00:02:48.709> like<00:02:56.200> Roger<00:02:57.200> is<00:02:57.500> along

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
making it kind of like Roger is along

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.360 
making it kind of like Roger is along
quicker<00:02:58.190> a<00:02:58.820> lot<00:02:59.180> snappier<00:03:00.140> as<00:03:00.290> well<00:03:00.470> now<00:03:01.190> that

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
quicker a lot snappier as well now that

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.210 
quicker a lot snappier as well now that
again<00:03:01.790> that's<00:03:01.970> just<00:03:02.090> an<00:03:02.269> alteration<00:03:02.660> of<00:03:02.870> the

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
again that's just an alteration of the

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.250 
again that's just an alteration of the
speed<00:03:04.220> one<00:03:04.940> thing<00:03:05.150> we<00:03:05.209> remember<00:03:05.269> not<00:03:05.600> to<00:03:05.840> do<00:03:05.989> is

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
speed one thing we remember not to do is

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:04.160 
one thing I would advise you not to do
because<00:04:02.250> it's<00:04:02.670> not<00:04:02.760> really<00:04:03.299> very<00:04:03.329> possible<00:04:03.989> is

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
because it's not really very possible is

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:05.720
