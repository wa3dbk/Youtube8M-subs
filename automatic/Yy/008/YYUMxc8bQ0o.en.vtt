of lose their they lose their initial

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.319 
of lose their they lose their initial
value<00:00:29.699> of<00:00:29.849> just<00:00:30.150> being<00:00:30.390> like<00:00:30.630> amazing<00:00:31.260> units

00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:32.329

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
so once you're kind of late game I just

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.900 
so once you're kind of late game I just
say<00:00:36.960> keep<00:00:37.320> like<00:00:37.590> two<00:00:37.829> or<00:00:37.950> three<00:00:37.980> mortars<00:00:38.640> with

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
say keep like two or three mortars with

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.209 
say keep like two or three mortars with
you<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.390> once<00:00:39.690> those<00:00:39.899> mortars<00:00:40.379> die<00:00:40.620> you<00:00:41.040> can

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
you and once those mortars die you can

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.639 
you and once those mortars die you can
replace<00:00:41.640> them<00:00:42.030> but<00:00:42.600> don't<00:00:42.780> I<00:00:43.050> don't<00:00:43.350> think<00:00:43.530> you

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
replace them but don't I don't think you

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.110 
replace them but don't I don't think you
need<00:00:43.800> any<00:00:43.860> more<00:00:44.250> than<00:00:44.489> like<00:00:44.670> two<00:00:44.910> or<00:00:45.059> three

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
need any more than like two or three

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.650 
need any more than like two or three
mortars<00:00:45.690> total<00:00:46.670> so<00:00:47.670> just<00:00:47.910> keep<00:00:48.059> that<00:00:48.120> in<00:00:48.329> mind

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
mortars total so just keep that in mind

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.400 
mortars total so just keep that in mind
if<00:00:48.870> if<00:00:49.170> you<00:00:49.379> do<00:00:49.559> go<00:00:49.770> mortars<00:00:50.840> just<00:00:51.840> be<00:00:51.989> ready<00:00:52.170> to

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
if if you do go mortars just be ready to

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.430 
if if you do go mortars just be ready to
switch<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:52.949> gyros<00:00:53.399> at<00:00:53.579> any<00:00:53.730> point<00:00:54.000> I<00:00:54.270> think

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
switch to gyros at any point I think

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.000 
switch to gyros at any point I think
gyros<00:00:55.440> are<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.739> best<00:00:55.980> anti<00:00:56.460> air<00:00:56.670> in<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.969> game

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
gyros are the best anti air in the game

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.610 
gyros are the best anti air in the game
so<00:00:59.010> yeah<00:00:59.160> I<00:00:59.219> think<00:00:59.280> they're<00:00:59.670> they're<00:01:00.090> amazing

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
better than he showed in this game his

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.450 
better than he showed in this game his
stats<00:01:05.519> Mesa<00:01:05.990> but<00:01:06.990> like<00:01:07.170> i<00:01:07.320> said<00:01:07.350> earlier<00:01:07.860> just

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.679 
so if you keep that pressure up your
opponent<00:01:35.189> will<00:01:35.280> probably<00:01:35.729> will<00:01:36.299> probably

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
opponent will probably will probably

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.660

everyone so yeah I think northrend is a

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.350 
everyone so yeah I think northrend is a
lot<00:05:37.500> there<00:05:37.830> they're<00:05:38.190> more<00:05:38.400> motivated<00:05:39.090> to<00:05:39.120> win

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:24.180 
yeah that's a good thing to think about

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:27.200 
yeah that's a good thing to think about
and<00:07:24.960> also<00:07:25.740> vice<00:07:26.189> versa<00:07:26.580> you<00:07:26.789> should<00:07:27.060> always

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:27.210 
and also vice versa you should always

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:30.170

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:30.180 
look at the opponent's items because you

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:32.749

00:07:32.759 --> 00:07:34.850 
should learn the items too because I can
look<00:07:32.999> at<00:07:33.150> I<00:07:33.360> can<00:07:33.749> look<00:07:33.870> at<00:07:34.020> a<00:07:34.050> hero's<00:07:34.409> items

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:34.860 
look at I can look at a hero's items

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:37.010 
look at I can look at a hero's items
early<00:07:35.310> game<00:07:35.580> until<00:07:36.120> exactly<00:07:36.719> where<00:07:36.900> they're

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:37.020 
early game until exactly where they're

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:40.369 
early game until exactly where they're
crept<00:07:37.349> and<00:07:37.529> I<00:07:37.620> can<00:07:37.879> basically<00:07:38.960> just<00:07:39.960> see<00:07:40.199> the

00:07:40.369 --> 00:07:40.379 
crept and I can basically just see the

00:07:40.379 --> 00:07:42.619 
crept and I can basically just see the
mini-map<00:07:40.800> I<00:07:40.979> can<00:07:41.159> envision<00:07:41.360> exactly<00:07:42.360> where

00:07:42.619 --> 00:07:42.629 
mini-map I can envision exactly where

00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:44.990 
mini-map I can envision exactly where
everyone's<00:07:42.990> expose<00:07:43.529> and<00:07:43.800> stuff<00:07:44.069> just<00:07:44.310> from

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:45.000 
everyone's expose and stuff just from

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.929 
everyone's expose and stuff just from
the<00:07:45.180> items<00:07:45.539> I've<00:07:45.750> seen<00:07:46.020> on<00:07:46.169> the<00:07:46.199> heroes<00:07:46.939> not

00:07:47.929 --> 00:07:47.939 
the items I've seen on the heroes not

00:07:47.939 --> 00:07:49.969 
the items I've seen on the heroes not
all<00:07:48.120> creep<00:07:48.389> camps<00:07:48.750> give<00:07:48.899> levels<00:07:49.289> so<00:07:49.500> sometimes

00:07:49.969 --> 00:07:49.979 
all creep camps give levels so sometimes

00:07:49.979 --> 00:07:51.439 
all creep camps give levels so sometimes
you<00:07:50.129> will<00:07:50.219> just<00:07:50.339> have<00:07:50.460> a<00:07:50.580> level<00:07:50.819> one<00:07:51.149> force

00:07:51.439 --> 00:07:51.449 
you will just have a level one force

00:07:51.449 --> 00:07:54.350 
you will just have a level one force
here<00:07:51.750> but<00:07:52.229> you<00:07:52.349> have<00:07:52.500> an<00:07:52.649> expo<00:07:53.159> so<00:07:54.000> it's<00:07:54.120> kind

00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:54.360 
here but you have an expo so it's kind

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:56.869 
here but you have an expo so it's kind
of<00:07:54.449> like<00:07:54.680> if<00:07:55.680> they<00:07:55.979> don't<00:07:56.159> have<00:07:56.310> any<00:07:56.460> items

00:07:56.869 --> 00:07:56.879
