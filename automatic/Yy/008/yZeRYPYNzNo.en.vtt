here's the Motorola RAZR courtesy of
mobile<00:00:23.220> comm<00:00:23.640> and<00:00:24.500> I'll<00:00:25.500> let's<00:00:25.710> have<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.010> quick

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
mobile comm and I'll let's have a quick

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.230 
mobile comm and I'll let's have a quick
look<00:00:26.990> so<00:00:28.490> what<00:00:29.490> I'm<00:00:29.580> doing<00:00:29.609> well<00:00:29.970> my

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
look so what I'm doing well my

look so what I'm doing well my
Internet's<00:00:30.599> currently<00:00:30.900> down<00:00:31.050> so<00:00:31.320> I'm<00:00:31.590> using

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:32.840 
Internet's currently down so I'm using

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.410 
Internet's currently down so I'm using
I'm<00:00:33.840> using<00:00:33.899> my<00:00:34.230> Galaxy<00:00:34.649> Nexus<00:00:34.680> as<00:00:35.280> a<00:00:35.880> Wi-Fi

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
I'm using my Galaxy Nexus as a Wi-Fi

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.420 
I'm using my Galaxy Nexus as a Wi-Fi
point<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:37.110> run<00:00:37.290> this<00:00:37.469> so<00:00:37.969> should<00:00:38.969> work<00:00:40.250> so<00:00:41.250> here

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
point to run this so should work so here

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.190 
point to run this so should work so here
we<00:00:41.550> go<00:00:41.730> so<00:00:41.760> we'll<00:00:42.210> do<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.510> quadrant<00:00:43.020> because

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
we go so we'll do the quadrant because

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.350 
we go so we'll do the quadrant because
everybody<00:00:43.680> asks<00:00:43.950> for<00:00:44.070> quadrant<00:00:44.520> whether<00:00:45.120> it's

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
everybody asks for quadrant whether it's

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.420 
everybody asks for quadrant whether it's
good<00:00:45.570> whether<00:00:45.600> it's<00:00:45.870> bad<00:00:46.129> everybody<00:00:47.129> wants<00:00:47.370> to

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
good whether it's bad everybody wants to

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.160 
good whether it's bad everybody wants to
know<00:00:47.520> what<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.940> quadrants<00:00:48.390> cars<00:00:48.629> coming<00:00:49.020> out

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
know what the quadrants cars coming out

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.000 
know what the quadrants cars coming out
so<00:00:49.890> I'm<00:00:50.730> gonna<00:00:50.910> show<00:00:51.180> what<00:00:51.329> they<00:00:51.420> do<00:00:51.539> coming<00:00:51.780> up

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
so I'm gonna show what they do coming up

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.880 
so I'm gonna show what they do coming up
so<00:00:53.010> if<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.309> wants<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:54.020> light<00:00:55.020> up<00:00:55.140> here<00:00:55.320> so<00:00:55.739> here

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
so if it wants to light up here so here

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.990 
so if it wants to light up here so here
we<00:00:55.980> go<00:00:56.160> so<00:00:56.399> I<00:00:57.030> wore<00:00:57.239> on<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.390> fall<00:00:57.660> benchmark

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
we go so I wore on the fall benchmark

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
we go so I wore on the fall benchmark
enough<00:01:00.000> she<00:01:00.180> Gus<00:01:00.390> so<00:01:00.570> we'll<00:01:00.719> do<00:01:00.840> what<00:01:00.960> we

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
enough she Gus so we'll do what we

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.049 
enough she Gus so we'll do what we
normally<00:01:01.170> do<00:01:01.469> will<00:01:01.829> let<00:01:01.980> a<00:01:02.010> grenade<00:01:02.760> scarce

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
normally do will let a grenade scarce

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.060 
normally do will let a grenade scarce
and<00:01:03.390> come<00:01:03.899> back<00:01:04.080> in<00:01:04.409> just<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.799> couple<00:01:04.830> of

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
and come back in just a couple of

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
and come back in just a couple of
seconds

right so welcome back and we've got the
benchmarking<00:01:13.369> results<00:01:13.700> here<00:01:13.850> and<00:01:14.180> it<00:01:15.110> gets

00:01:16.139 --> 00:01:16.149 
benchmarking results here and it gets

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:25.899 
benchmarking results here and it gets
dun-dun-dun<00:01:19.720> an<00:01:20.720> impressive<00:01:24.610> 2795<00:01:25.610> couldn't

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
dun-dun-dun an impressive 2795 couldn't

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:28.210 
dun-dun-dun an impressive 2795 couldn't
you<00:01:25.970> get<00:01:26.210> there<00:01:26.539> we<00:01:26.659> go<00:01:26.840> as<00:01:27.830> you<00:01:27.860> can<00:01:27.950> see<00:01:28.130> you

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
just get a pretty impressive scar in

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.350 
just get a pretty impressive scar in
terms<00:01:30.799> of<00:01:30.950> the<00:01:31.039> specifications<00:01:31.939> if<00:01:32.030> we<00:01:32.210> have

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
terms of the specifications if we have

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.050 
terms of the specifications if we have
1.2<00:01:32.899> gigahertz<00:01:33.259> dual-core<00:01:33.710> processor<00:01:34.490> with

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
1.2 gigahertz dual-core processor with

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.260 
1.2 gigahertz dual-core processor with
one<00:01:35.299> gigabyte<00:01:35.659> of<00:01:35.810> ram<00:01:36.020> so<00:01:37.060> that's<00:01:38.060> the

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
one gigabyte of ram so that's the

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:39.429 
one gigabyte of ram so that's the
quadrant<00:01:38.720> benchmark

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:39.439 
quadrant benchmark

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:41.109 
quadrant benchmark
a<00:01:39.470> lot<00:01:39.920> of<00:01:39.950> people<00:01:40.220> I<00:01:40.310> keep<00:01:40.490> asking<00:01:40.670> for<00:01:40.909> that

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
a lot of people I keep asking for that

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:44.559 
a lot of people I keep asking for that
so<00:01:41.539> there<00:01:41.720> you<00:01:41.780> go<00:01:42.909> next<00:01:43.909> one<00:01:44.030> we<00:01:44.179> were<00:01:44.360> going

so there you go next one we were going

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:49.539 
so there you go next one we were going
to<00:01:44.630> do<00:01:44.750> is<00:01:45.459> the<00:01:46.459> antutu<00:01:47.030> benchmark<00:01:48.369> so<00:01:49.369> one

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 
to do is the antutu benchmark so one

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:52.270 
to do is the antutu benchmark so one
this<00:01:49.729> is<00:01:49.909> one<00:01:50.060> I've<00:01:50.569> been<00:01:50.750> doing<00:01:50.810> myself<00:01:51.280> as

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
this is one I've been doing myself as

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.350 
this is one I've been doing myself as
you<00:01:52.369> can<00:01:52.490> see<00:01:52.580> I've<00:01:52.670> done<00:01:52.700> a<00:01:52.850> test<00:01:53.119> in<00:01:53.270> your

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
you can see I've done a test in your

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.520 
you can see I've done a test in your
previous<00:01:53.539> but<00:01:53.780> I'm<00:01:53.840> gonna<00:01:53.959> do<00:01:54.020> another<00:01:54.200> test

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
previous but I'm gonna do another test

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.059 
previous but I'm gonna do another test
for<00:01:54.709> you<00:01:54.860> guys<00:01:55.039> just<00:01:55.280> now<00:01:55.509> so<00:01:56.649> let's<00:01:57.649> turn<00:01:57.890> the

00:01:58.059 --> 00:01:58.069 
for you guys just now so let's turn the

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:00.969 
for you guys just now so let's turn the
test<00:01:58.310> you<00:01:58.909> live<00:01:59.060> all<00:01:59.240> this<00:01:59.390> default<00:01:59.920> start<00:02:00.920> a

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
test you live all this default start a

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:03.010 
test you live all this default start a
test<00:02:01.250> I<00:02:01.580> reason<00:02:02.299> why<00:02:02.360> I<00:02:02.420> picked<00:02:02.600> this<00:02:02.750> one<00:02:02.929> is

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
test I reason why I picked this one is

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.990 
test I reason why I picked this one is
because<00:02:03.289> this<00:02:03.439> one<00:02:03.649> seems<00:02:03.920> to<00:02:04.039> be<00:02:04.250> a<00:02:04.520> lot<00:02:04.909> more

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
because this one seems to be a lot more

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.070 
because this one seems to be a lot more
accurate<00:02:05.240> and<00:02:05.509> a<00:02:05.630> lot<00:02:05.810> of<00:02:05.869> here<00:02:05.990> will

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
accurate and a lot of here will

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.410 
accurate and a lot of here will
benchmarking<00:02:06.560> applications<00:02:07.369> so<00:02:08.179> once<00:02:08.330> again

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
benchmarking applications so once again

benchmarking applications so once again
I'm<00:02:08.569> gonna<00:02:08.690> leave<00:02:08.929> it<00:02:09.110> here

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
I'm gonna leave it here

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.570 
I'm gonna leave it here
and<00:02:09.979> we<00:02:10.250> shall<00:02:10.399> cut<00:02:10.640> back<00:02:11.110> the<00:02:12.110> end<00:02:12.560> of<00:02:12.709> it<00:02:12.830> so

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
and we shall cut back the end of it so

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:37.199 
and we shall cut back the end of it so
stay<00:02:13.790> tuned<00:02:14.090> and<00:02:15.049> we<00:02:15.170> shall<00:02:16.269> be<00:02:17.269> right<00:02:17.420> back
