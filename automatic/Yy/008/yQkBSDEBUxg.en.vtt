Coast<00:00:15.309> today<00:00:16.309> what<00:00:16.520> I<00:00:16.580> want<00:00:16.730> to<00:00:16.760> talk<00:00:16.970> about

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:17.240 
Coast today what I want to talk about

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.269 
Coast today what I want to talk about
it's<00:00:17.390> blue<00:00:17.600> tails<00:00:17.900> again<00:00:18.080> and<00:00:18.470> we're<00:00:19.010> talking

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:19.279 
it's blue tails again and we're talking

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:20.980 
it's blue tails again and we're talking
about<00:00:19.369> ways<00:00:19.640> of<00:00:20.029> strengthening<00:00:20.300> blue<00:00:20.720> tails

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:20.990 
about ways of strengthening blue tails

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:22.990 
about ways of strengthening blue tails
and<00:00:21.200> getting<00:00:21.500> them<00:00:21.650> firing<00:00:21.980> one<00:00:22.790> of<00:00:22.910> the

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:23.000 
and getting them firing one of the

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.150 
and getting them firing one of the
things<00:00:23.300> that<00:00:23.570> people<00:00:23.750> often<00:00:24.170> forget<00:00:24.470> about<00:00:24.770> is

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:25.160 
things that people often forget about is

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.859 
things that people often forget about is
that<00:00:25.340> if<00:00:25.520> you<00:00:25.730> get<00:00:25.939> these<00:00:26.180> little<00:00:26.419> trigger

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:26.869 
that if you get these little trigger

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:29.170 
that if you get these little trigger
points<00:00:27.200> these<00:00:27.290> knots<00:00:27.680> in<00:00:28.009> your<00:00:28.189> muscles<00:00:28.579> then

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:29.180 
points these knots in your muscles then

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.510 
points these knots in your muscles then
very<00:00:29.630> commonly<00:00:30.020> that<00:00:30.200> will<00:00:30.410> inhibit<00:00:30.739> the

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:31.520 
very commonly that will inhibit the

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.520 
very commonly that will inhibit the
muscle<00:00:31.820> we<00:00:32.000> know<00:00:32.210> research-wise<00:00:32.870> the<00:00:33.290> fact

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
muscle we know research-wise the fact

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.590 
muscle we know research-wise the fact
that<00:00:33.620> that<00:00:33.860> happens<00:00:34.280> it'll<00:00:34.820> make<00:00:35.060> the<00:00:35.270> muscle

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 
that that happens it'll make the muscle

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.780 
that that happens it'll make the muscle
fatigue<00:00:35.720> quicker<00:00:36.440> and<00:00:36.680> and<00:00:37.220> it'll<00:00:37.489> make<00:00:37.640> it

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:37.790 
fatigue quicker and and it'll make it

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.850 
fatigue quicker and and it'll make it
weaker<00:00:38.180> as<00:00:38.329> well<00:00:38.570> so<00:00:39.110> you<00:00:39.170> want<00:00:39.440> to<00:00:39.590> start

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:39.860 
weaker as well so you want to start

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.860 
weaker as well so you want to start
understanding<00:00:40.100> your<00:00:41.030> trigger<00:00:41.300> points<00:00:41.660> in

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
understanding your trigger points in

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.750 
understanding your trigger points in
your<00:00:41.989> gluteus<00:00:42.500> because<00:00:43.070> most<00:00:43.340> people<00:00:43.640> in

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
your gluteus because most people in

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.849 
your gluteus because most people in
strength<00:00:44.030> and<00:00:44.180> strength<00:00:44.449> and<00:00:44.629> strengthen<00:00:45.050> and

00:00:45.849 --> 00:00:45.859 
strength and strength and strengthen and

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:48.160 
strength and strength and strengthen and
and<00:00:46.129> I<00:00:46.399> won't<00:00:46.760> I'll<00:00:47.030> think<00:00:47.269> all<00:00:47.449> if<00:00:47.840> I<00:00:47.989> can

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
and I won't I'll think all if I can

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.439 
and I won't I'll think all if I can
actually<00:00:48.289> release<00:00:48.710> that<00:00:48.949> muscle<00:00:49.429> then<00:00:49.879> you

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:50.449 
actually release that muscle then you

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:51.910 
actually release that muscle then you
can<00:00:50.629> actually<00:00:50.750> activate<00:00:51.199> it<00:00:51.500> better<00:00:51.649> and<00:00:51.859> you

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
can actually activate it better and you

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.220 
can actually activate it better and you
can<00:00:52.010> get<00:00:52.280> better<00:00:52.460> strength<00:00:52.789> that<00:00:53.090> way<00:00:53.300> as<00:00:53.570> well

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
can get better strength that way as well

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:55.810 
can get better strength that way as well
so<00:00:54.500> you<00:00:54.589> want<00:00:54.739> to<00:00:54.800> start<00:00:55.010> to<00:00:55.129> understand<00:00:55.609> the

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
so you want to start to understand the

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.270 
so you want to start to understand the
math<00:00:56.239> of<00:00:56.480> trigger<00:00:56.929> points<00:00:57.350> in<00:00:57.440> your<00:00:57.679> gluteals

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
math of trigger points in your gluteals

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.700 
math of trigger points in your gluteals
and<00:00:58.429> then<00:00:58.730> know<00:00:58.940> how<00:00:58.969> to<00:00:59.260> release<00:01:00.260> them<00:01:00.530> all

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
and then know how to release them all

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.529 
and then know how to release them all
and<00:01:01.039> basically<00:01:01.640> what<00:01:01.999> we're<00:01:02.089> going<00:01:02.179> to<00:01:02.269> be<00:01:02.390> is

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:02.539 
and basically what we're going to be is

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:04.390 
and basically what we're going to be is
is<00:01:02.719> it<00:01:02.870> is<00:01:03.019> a<00:01:03.050> little<00:01:03.320> trigger<00:01:03.530> ball<00:01:03.710> most

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
is it is a little trigger ball most

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.430 
is it is a little trigger ball most
people<00:01:04.850> will<00:01:04.970> use<00:01:05.000> to<00:01:05.420> sustained<00:01:05.930> it<00:01:06.140> ball

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:06.440 
people will use to sustained it ball

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.880 
people will use to sustained it ball
around<00:01:06.890> ball<00:01:07.210> in<00:01:08.210> over<00:01:08.750> 18<00:01:09.260> years<00:01:09.500> I've<00:01:09.710> found

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
around ball in over 18 years I've found

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.620 
around ball in over 18 years I've found
that<00:01:10.100> these<00:01:10.340> are<00:01:10.670> the<00:01:10.790> very<00:01:11.030> best<00:01:11.330> thing<00:01:11.600> that

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
that these are the very best thing that

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.390 
that these are the very best thing that
you<00:01:11.870> can<00:01:11.990> find<00:01:12.290> it's<00:01:12.440> a<00:01:12.470> little<00:01:12.560> reflex<00:01:13.130> ball

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
you can find it's a little reflex ball

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.180 
you can find it's a little reflex ball
so<00:01:13.970> now<00:01:14.840> sports<00:01:15.140> players<00:01:15.440> use<00:01:15.740> them<00:01:16.010> to

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 
so now sports players use them to

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:17.920 
so now sports players use them to
actually<00:01:16.310> that<00:01:16.790> they<00:01:16.940> bounce<00:01:17.270> and<00:01:17.540> they<00:01:17.630> they

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
actually that they bounce and they they

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:19.660 
actually that they bounce and they they
bounce<00:01:18.230> in<00:01:18.380> all<00:01:18.500> directions<00:01:18.650> they<00:01:19.520> are

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
bounce in all directions they are

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.610 
bounce in all directions they are
perfectly<00:01:20.330> designed<00:01:20.540> for<00:01:20.870> trigger<00:01:21.170> pointing

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:21.620 
perfectly designed for trigger pointing

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.530 
perfectly designed for trigger pointing
so<00:01:21.800> you<00:01:21.860> get<00:01:22.220> yourself<00:01:22.580> a<00:01:22.640> reflex<00:01:23.060> ball<00:01:23.300> boys

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
so you get yourself a reflex ball boys

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.600 
so you get yourself a reflex ball boys
they're<00:01:24.050> gonna<00:01:24.170> be<00:01:24.380> really<00:01:24.740> good<00:01:24.950> and<00:01:25.130> then

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
they're gonna be really good and then

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.010 
they're gonna be really good and then
what<00:01:25.790> we're<00:01:25.880> gonna<00:01:25.940> do<00:01:26.240> is<00:01:26.510> actually<00:01:26.690> go

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
what we're gonna do is actually go

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.020 
what we're gonna do is actually go
through<00:01:27.260> that<00:01:27.350> map<00:01:27.680> and<00:01:28.010> show<00:01:28.460> you<00:01:28.520> that<00:01:28.730> right

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
through that map and show you that right

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.200 
through that map and show you that right
now<00:01:30.490> okay<00:01:31.490> guys<00:01:31.670> so<00:01:31.850> when<00:01:32.000> you're<00:01:32.120> gonna

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
now okay guys so when you're gonna

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:33.820 
now okay guys so when you're gonna
trigger<00:01:32.570> point<00:01:32.840> they<00:01:32.990> hit<00:01:33.170> the<00:01:33.320> first<00:01:33.560> thing

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
trigger point they hit the first thing

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.280 
trigger point they hit the first thing
is<00:01:33.980> make<00:01:34.460> sure<00:01:34.490> that<00:01:35.090> you<00:01:35.810> don't<00:01:36.050> have<00:01:36.170> any

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
is make sure that you don't have any

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.440 
is make sure that you don't have any
injuries<00:01:36.740> you<00:01:37.100> have<00:01:37.160> any<00:01:37.370> back<00:01:37.580> troubles<00:01:38.060> or

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
injuries you have any back troubles or

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.240 
injuries you have any back troubles or
anything<00:01:38.690> like<00:01:38.930> that<00:01:38.990> then<00:01:39.500> always<00:01:39.800> to<00:01:40.070> check

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
anything like that then always to check

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.310 
anything like that then always to check
with<00:01:40.370> your<00:01:40.430> doctor<00:01:40.490> before<00:01:40.790> you<00:01:41.000> start<00:01:41.320> doing

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
with your doctor before you start doing

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.840 
with your doctor before you start doing
any<00:01:42.650> of<00:01:42.740> these<00:01:42.830> self-released<00:01:43.430> types<00:01:43.700> of

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
any of these self-released types of

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.210 
any of these self-released types of
strategies<00:01:44.030> but<00:01:44.870> from<00:01:45.290> his<00:01:45.470> perspective<00:01:45.860> of

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
strategies but from his perspective of

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.130 
strategies but from his perspective of
anatomy<00:01:46.520> what<00:01:47.000> we<00:01:47.120> want<00:01:47.300> to<00:01:47.390> do<00:01:47.570> is<00:01:47.750> we<00:01:47.900> want<00:01:48.050> to

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
anatomy what we want to do is we want to

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.740 
anatomy what we want to do is we want to
find<00:01:48.410> that<00:01:49.250> little<00:01:49.460> novel<00:01:50.060> of<00:01:50.180> bones<00:01:50.420> so<00:01:50.660> you

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
find that little novel of bones so you

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.930 
find that little novel of bones so you
think<00:01:50.930> about<00:01:51.140> you<00:01:51.830> you<00:01:52.400> know<00:01:52.460> people<00:01:52.730> with

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:52.940 
think about you you know people with

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.850 
think about you you know people with
board<00:01:53.240> shorts<00:01:53.570> on<00:01:53.750> and<00:01:54.020> you<00:01:54.320> see<00:01:54.470> that<00:01:54.620> little

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
board shorts on and you see that little

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.160 
board shorts on and you see that little
little<00:01:55.400> dimple<00:01:55.820> it's<00:01:56.240> called<00:01:56.480> your<00:01:56.600> psi<00:01:57.050> yeah

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
little dimple it's called your psi yeah

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:58.690 
little dimple it's called your psi yeah
so<00:01:57.380> you<00:01:57.470> want<00:01:57.620> to<00:01:57.680> actually<00:01:57.770> locate<00:01:58.130> that

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
so you want to actually locate that

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.410 
so you want to actually locate that
little<00:01:59.090> little<00:01:59.600> novel<00:02:00.140> and<00:02:00.340> then<00:02:01.340> the<00:02:01.970> trigger

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
little little novel and then the trigger

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.750 
little little novel and then the trigger
point<00:02:02.750> is<00:02:02.960> is<00:02:03.350> two<00:02:03.800> thumb<00:02:04.100> distances<00:02:04.580> down

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:04.760 
point is is two thumb distances down

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.390 
point is is two thumb distances down
from<00:02:05.090> that<00:02:05.270> so<00:02:05.450> it's<00:02:05.600> right<00:02:05.840> there<00:02:06.500> and<00:02:06.800> then

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400 
from that so it's right there and then

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.160 
from that so it's right there and then
there's<00:02:07.640> a<00:02:07.730> map<00:02:08.030> of<00:02:08.209> the<00:02:08.269> Moran<00:02:08.599> so<00:02:08.840> the<00:02:08.959> top<00:02:09.140> of

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
there's a map of the Moran so the top of

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.259 
there's a map of the Moran so the top of
gloop<00:02:09.440> made<00:02:09.679> a<00:02:09.950> glutamate<00:02:10.459> is<00:02:10.610> notorious<00:02:11.239> for

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:11.269 
gloop made a glutamate is notorious for

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:13.809 
gloop made a glutamate is notorious for
not<00:02:11.510> firing<00:02:12.500> and<00:02:12.860> and<00:02:13.129> you<00:02:13.459> get<00:02:13.670> your

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
not firing and and you get your

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:15.640 
not firing and and you get your
instability<00:02:14.360> when<00:02:14.540> you<00:02:14.690> run<00:02:14.930> so<00:02:15.260> you<00:02:15.379> end<00:02:15.530> up

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
instability when you run so you end up

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.520 
instability when you run so you end up
with<00:02:15.709> your<00:02:16.160> and<00:02:16.599> trochanteric<00:02:17.599> bursitis<00:02:17.629> is

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
with your and trochanteric bursitis is

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.950 
with your and trochanteric bursitis is
you<00:02:19.360> tell<00:02:20.360> a<00:02:20.390> femoral

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
you tell a femoral

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.080 
you tell a femoral
you<00:02:22.110> run<00:02:22.260> as<00:02:22.380> neat<00:02:22.530> topsis<00:02:22.890> in<00:02:23.070> syndromes<00:02:23.850> all

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
you run as neat topsis in syndromes all

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.480 
you run as neat topsis in syndromes all
of<00:02:24.210> those<00:02:24.300> types<00:02:24.540> of<00:02:24.660> things<00:02:24.980> but<00:02:25.980> if<00:02:26.160> we<00:02:26.340> can

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
of those types of things but if we can

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.550 
of those types of things but if we can
actually<00:02:26.580> find<00:02:26.760> trigger<00:02:27.330> point<00:02:27.540> one<00:02:27.750> and<00:02:28.050> then

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
actually find trigger point one and then

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.130 
actually find trigger point one and then
they<00:02:28.740> actually<00:02:28.860> map<00:02:29.220> outside<00:02:29.820> two<00:02:30.210> and<00:02:30.480> then

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
they actually map outside two and then

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.770 
they actually map outside two and then
three<00:02:31.380> it's<00:02:32.010> a<00:02:32.130> really<00:02:32.490> easy<00:02:32.790> to<00:02:33.030> find<00:02:33.240> a<00:02:33.540> way

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
three it's a really easy to find a way

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.120 
three it's a really easy to find a way
to<00:02:33.840> find<00:02:34.170> those<00:02:34.380> three<00:02:34.500> and<00:02:34.650> I'll<00:02:34.740> show<00:02:35.100> you

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
to find those three and I'll show you

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.130 
to find those three and I'll show you
exactly<00:02:35.400> how<00:02:35.820> and<00:02:36.180> I'll<00:02:36.660> just<00:02:36.780> give<00:02:36.930> you<00:02:37.020> the

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
exactly how and I'll just give you the

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.540 
exactly how and I'll just give you the
ball<00:02:39.410> so<00:02:40.410> she's<00:02:40.770> basically<00:02:40.920> going<00:02:41.310> to<00:02:41.400> get

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
ball so she's basically going to get

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.020 
ball so she's basically going to get
onto<00:02:41.910> glute<00:02:42.540> meat<00:02:42.750> so<00:02:43.020> she's<00:02:43.260> found<00:02:43.790> Pierce<00:02:44.790> is

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
onto glute meat so she's found Pierce is

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.940 
onto glute meat so she's found Pierce is
through<00:02:45.510> the<00:02:45.630> back<00:02:45.780> and<00:02:45.960> then<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.320> ball<00:02:46.590> is

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
through the back and then the ball is

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.640 
through the back and then the ball is
positioned<00:02:47.490> to<00:02:48.120> thumb<00:02:48.420> distances<00:02:48.960> below<00:02:49.320> that

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
positioned to thumb distances below that

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.430 
positioned to thumb distances below that
so<00:02:50.250> she's<00:02:50.580> we've<00:02:51.390> got<00:02:51.510> a<00:02:51.540> tree<00:02:51.810> here<00:02:52.110> so<00:02:52.350> you

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
so she's we've got a tree here so you

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.420 
so she's we've got a tree here so you
can<00:02:52.530> do<00:02:52.650> it<00:02:52.740> all<00:02:52.890> you<00:02:53.040> happen<00:02:53.220> to<00:02:53.250> be<00:02:53.370> out

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
can do it all you happen to be out

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.540 
can do it all you happen to be out
running<00:02:53.640> but<00:02:54.630> you<00:02:54.660> can<00:02:54.780> use<00:02:54.900> a<00:02:54.930> wall<00:02:55.200> at<00:02:55.410> home

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
running but you can use a wall at home

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.450 
running but you can use a wall at home
whatever<00:02:56.550> have<00:02:57.510> you<00:02:57.600> got<00:02:57.720> that<00:02:57.750> point<00:02:58.230> yeah<00:02:58.800> so

00:02:59.450 --> 00:02:59.460 
whatever have you got that point yeah so

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.070 
whatever have you got that point yeah so
she's<00:03:00.000> on<00:03:00.150> that<00:03:00.360> point<00:03:00.570> now<00:03:00.780> it's<00:03:00.930> like<00:03:01.050> a

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
she's on that point now it's like a

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.560 
she's on that point now it's like a
pleasure<00:03:01.380> pain<00:03:01.680> type<00:03:02.010> of<00:03:02.160> feeling<00:03:02.490> so<00:03:03.300> we<00:03:03.420> just

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
pleasure pain type of feeling so we just

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.450 
pleasure pain type of feeling so we just
have<00:03:03.720> a<00:03:03.750> look<00:03:03.930> at<00:03:04.020> her<00:03:04.110> position<00:03:04.620> in<00:03:04.770> see<00:03:05.310> how

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:05.460 
have a look at her position in see how

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:07.880 
have a look at her position in see how
she's<00:03:05.640> got<00:03:05.760> a<00:03:05.820> 45<00:03:06.360> degree<00:03:06.540> angle<00:03:06.720> to<00:03:07.350> that<00:03:07.500> that

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
she's got a 45 degree angle to that that

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.790 
she's got a 45 degree angle to that that
that<00:03:08.160> tree<00:03:08.610> and<00:03:09.600> she<00:03:09.930> can<00:03:10.110> use<00:03:10.320> her<00:03:10.350> knees<00:03:10.770> so

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
that tree and she can use her knees so

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.390 
that tree and she can use her knees so
if<00:03:11.100> you<00:03:11.280> step<00:03:11.550> out<00:03:11.730> inch<00:03:12.860> she<00:03:13.860> can<00:03:14.010> use<00:03:14.190> that

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
if you step out inch she can use that

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.670 
if you step out inch she can use that
that<00:03:14.670> need<00:03:15.210> to<00:03:15.450> really<00:03:15.690> get<00:03:15.780> pressure<00:03:16.110> on<00:03:16.350> as

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
that need to really get pressure on as

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.130 
that need to really get pressure on as
well<00:03:16.980> so<00:03:17.220> that's<00:03:18.030> that's<00:03:18.300> number<00:03:18.540> one<00:03:18.870> I

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
well so that's that's number one I

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.200 
well so that's that's number one I
always<00:03:19.710> think<00:03:20.100> of<00:03:20.130> the<00:03:20.220> body<00:03:20.430> in<00:03:20.670> a<00:03:20.760> trail<00:03:21.030> of

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:21.210 
always think of the body in a trail of

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.350 
always think of the body in a trail of
tightness<00:03:21.450> so<00:03:21.810> so<00:03:22.440> one<00:03:22.710> point<00:03:23.100> is<00:03:23.790> not<00:03:24.150> going

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
tightness so so one point is not going

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.090 
tightness so so one point is not going
to<00:03:24.450> change<00:03:24.690> your<00:03:24.870> world<00:03:25.050> you<00:03:25.620> want<00:03:25.830> to<00:03:25.920> then

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
to change your world you want to then

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.010 
to change your world you want to then
start<00:03:26.400> heading<00:03:27.180> out<00:03:27.420> through<00:03:27.690> here<00:03:27.840> and<00:03:27.930> the

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020 
start heading out through here and the

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.780 
start heading out through here and the
great<00:03:28.260> thing<00:03:28.440> about<00:03:28.500> these<00:03:28.860> reflex<00:03:29.310> balls<00:03:29.580> is

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
great thing about these reflex balls is

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.850 
great thing about these reflex balls is
that<00:03:30.000> they're<00:03:30.210> they're<00:03:30.630> intuitive<00:03:31.080> so<00:03:31.650> if<00:03:31.710> you

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
that they're they're intuitive so if you

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.250 
that they're they're intuitive so if you
just<00:03:32.040> go<00:03:32.220> clunk<00:03:32.750> can<00:03:33.750> you<00:03:33.840> feel<00:03:33.990> that<00:03:34.020> next

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
just go clunk can you feel that next

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260 
just go clunk can you feel that next
plane<00:03:34.410> so<00:03:35.010> she's<00:03:35.250> on<00:03:35.400> that<00:03:35.580> next<00:03:35.820> point<00:03:36.000> there

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 
plane so she's on that next point there

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.600 
plane so she's on that next point there
so<00:03:36.570> glute<00:03:36.810> meet<00:03:37.020> as<00:03:37.170> well<00:03:37.380> okay<00:03:37.920> so<00:03:38.130> she's

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
so glute meet as well okay so she's

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.670 
so glute meet as well okay so she's
gonna<00:03:38.730> sit<00:03:39.060> on<00:03:39.180> that<00:03:39.360> 20<00:03:39.840> seconds

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
gonna sit on that 20 seconds

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.790 
gonna sit on that 20 seconds
make<00:03:41.130> sure<00:03:41.340> it's<00:03:41.460> company<00:03:42.060> and<00:03:42.360> then<00:03:43.020> again<00:03:43.500> we

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
make sure it's company and then again we

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.380 
make sure it's company and then again we
got<00:03:43.950> our<00:03:44.100> third<00:03:44.370> point<00:03:44.640> guess<00:03:45.000> what<00:03:45.240> we're

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
got our third point guess what we're

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:51.080 
got our third point guess what we're
gonna<00:03:45.480> Clank<00:03:45.810> again<00:03:47.540> bang<00:03:48.540> got<00:03:49.410> in<00:03:49.530> it<00:03:49.650> cool<00:03:50.550> so

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
gonna Clank again bang got in it cool so

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.760 
gonna Clank again bang got in it cool so
she's<00:03:51.300> got<00:03:51.450> that<00:03:51.570> third<00:03:51.840> point<00:03:52.170> there

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:52.770 
she's got that third point there

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:55.910 
she's got that third point there
so<00:03:53.310> she's<00:03:53.550> again<00:03:53.910> sitting<00:03:54.390> on<00:03:54.570> that<00:03:54.920> 20

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
so she's again sitting on that 20

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.100 
so she's again sitting on that 20
seconds<00:03:56.640> gonna<00:03:56.910> release<00:03:57.180> soft<00:03:57.420> comfy<00:03:57.840> at<00:03:57.930> all

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
seconds gonna release soft comfy at all

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.620 
seconds gonna release soft comfy at all
time<00:03:58.440> guys<00:03:58.740> if<00:03:59.040> it's<00:03:59.250> not<00:03:59.490> comfy<00:03:59.940> then<00:04:00.240> then

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
time guys if it's not comfy then then

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:01.910 
time guys if it's not comfy then then

absolutely stop

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.310 
absolutely stop
so<00:04:02.220> that's<00:04:02.550> changing<00:04:03.360> things<00:04:03.600> around<00:04:03.750> a<00:04:04.170> bit

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
so that's changing things around a bit

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.990 
so that's changing things around a bit
that's<00:04:04.590> actually<00:04:04.950> switching<00:04:05.550> and<00:04:05.700> thinking

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
that's actually switching and thinking

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.820 
that's actually switching and thinking
if<00:04:06.180> I<00:04:06.360> can<00:04:06.600> release<00:04:06.900> the<00:04:07.050> muscle<00:04:07.380> I<00:04:07.530> can

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
if I can release the muscle I can

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.370 
if I can release the muscle I can
actually<00:04:08.250> activate<00:04:08.610> it<00:04:08.880> better<00:04:09.210> and<00:04:09.480> you<00:04:10.080> can

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
actually activate it better and you can

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:11.630 
actually activate it better and you can
use<00:04:10.620> it<00:04:10.650> from<00:04:10.860> an<00:04:10.980> injury<00:04:11.220> prevention

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
use it from an injury prevention

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.610 
use it from an injury prevention
perspective<00:04:12.420> and<00:04:12.570> then<00:04:12.960> the<00:04:13.080> next<00:04:13.500> level

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
perspective and then the next level

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.320 
perspective and then the next level
beyond<00:04:14.100> that<00:04:14.280> you<00:04:14.400> start<00:04:14.700> to<00:04:14.790> use<00:04:14.940> it<00:04:14.970> from<00:04:15.240> a

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
beyond that you start to use it from a

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.060 
beyond that you start to use it from a
performance<00:04:15.660> perspective<00:04:15.990> which<00:04:16.590> is<00:04:16.770> you

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
performance perspective which is you

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:17.500 
performance perspective which is you
underst

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
underst

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.470 
underst
in<00:04:17.570> your<00:04:17.900> body<00:04:18.170> and<00:04:18.440> linking<00:04:19.220> into<00:04:19.520> it<00:04:19.850> so<00:04:20.300> that

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:20.480 
in your body and linking into it so that

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.900 
in your body and linking into it so that
it<00:04:20.600> starts<00:04:21.230> to<00:04:21.290> fire<00:04:21.620> better<00:04:22.490> and<00:04:22.640> better<00:04:22.760> and

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
it starts to fire better and better and

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.240 
it starts to fire better and better and
better<00:04:23.030> so<00:04:23.450> get<00:04:23.990> going<00:04:24.170> with<00:04:24.290> that<00:04:24.410> 20<00:04:24.830> seconds

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
better so get going with that 20 seconds

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.640 
better so get going with that 20 seconds
each<00:04:25.400> point<00:04:25.760> always<00:04:26.000> do<00:04:26.330> left<00:04:26.510> and<00:04:26.720> right<00:04:26.900> you

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
each point always do left and right you

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.830 
each point always do left and right you
should<00:04:27.830> do<00:04:27.950> it<00:04:28.070> as<00:04:28.490> a<00:04:28.880> poster<00:04:29.390> on<00:04:29.450> top<00:04:29.720> of
