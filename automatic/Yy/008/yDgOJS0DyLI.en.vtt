00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
world honestly this is not like well it

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.169 
world honestly this is not like well it
is<00:02:06.810> like<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.319> other<00:02:07.470> ones<00:02:07.819> except<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:09.030> other

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
is like the other ones except the other

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.220 
is like the other ones except the other
ones<00:02:09.420> were<00:02:09.810> patch<00:02:10.140> so<00:02:10.860> I<00:02:11.160> don't<00:02:11.459> get<00:02:11.640> why<00:02:12.230> this

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
ones were patch so I don't get why this

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.170 
ones were patch so I don't get why this
one<00:02:13.500> works<00:02:13.769> if<00:02:14.190> the<00:02:14.250> other<00:02:14.730> ones<00:02:14.940> patch

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
one works if the other ones patch

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.820
