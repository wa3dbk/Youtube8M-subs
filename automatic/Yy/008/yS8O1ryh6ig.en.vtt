00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 the number of dips in 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.569
 Germany continues to rise 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.250
 however, the rate drops enlightenment all 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.050
 three minutes will be in a house or in 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.210
 a flat broken in personal 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.950
 Things are damaged and ransacked 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.179
 stolen valuables 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.029
 this is the average 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.949
 hurt at over 3,000 euros and that 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.210
 although it is relatively easy against 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.230
 to protect burglars 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.570
 for example, the installation 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.189
 a simple alarm system either 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.230
 visible for direct deterrence 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.820
 is attached or in the case of a 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.230
 Burglar try it acoustically alarm 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.690
 The probability decreases 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.600
 a successful slump already around 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.129
 whole 90 percent and just one 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.700
 I want you today 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.590
 imagine it's about the sa2 1700 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.050
 at home blaupunkt what she can do 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.789
 how reliable she works and much 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.000
 You will learn more after the intro 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.000
 fun 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:59.000
 we have the start package of the system here 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.080
 in front of us and look directly at us 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.850
 in delivery of 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.410
 when we open the box comes to us as 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.690
 first the detailed instruction 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.700
 contrary to that we will see already 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.520
 times the service part and the enclosed 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.350
 sensors the control panel is of high quality 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.330
 and comes with a wall mount therefore 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.050
 screws and dowels are also already 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.610
 there 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.230
 next to it is the power supply 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.420
 which not only to the actual 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:22.070
 power supply is used but in addition 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.080
 the integrated battery charges 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.420
 Thus, the alarm system works well 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.250
 in the event of power outages, continue smoothly 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.160
 it goes with a radio motion detector 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:34.010
 and next to it a door and window sensor 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.900
 velvet fixing material for easy 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.440
 focus respectively 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.300
 disable is a small one 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.550
 Remote control including replacement battery 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.320
 thanks to a protective cap one can also 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.210
 do not look at a button 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.770
 Last but not least, we will come 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.560
 also fixing material for the 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.600
 operated part as just mentioned and 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.729
 for the motion detector with in the box 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.920
 So these were the things you were in 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.479
 starter package gets straight home 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.759
 In addition, you can use the alarm system 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.860
 but of course according to your circumstances 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:03.289
 There is an extension for this in the blaupunkt 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.600
 shop and amazon addition 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:07.640
 to buy sensors like eg fire or 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.229
 water detector or even more 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.310
 movement or door and 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.560
 window sensors 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.840
 altogether it can be up to 30 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.310
 sensors per system use the links 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.080
 are below in the description 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.000
 the facility went fast and 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.620
 Easily use only the lifer 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.390
 sensors already included in the start package 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.920
 you do not have to do anything 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.420
 these are already preprogrammed 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.100
 Do you still need additional sensors? 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.260
 this of course on your service part 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.950
 but that is also very important 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.540
 easy 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.550
 every sensor can be named as you like 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.830
 so that you can see later where 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.720
 the alarm was triggered eg on 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.700
 cellar window or on the patio door 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.380
 the later operation is after a short time 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.090
 Try to understand quickly 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.350
 the menus are logically structured and you 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.510
 should be fine anyway 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:49.190
 can find their way to the first place 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.630
 times in the menu must come 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.520
 give her a pre-determined code 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.200
 Enter this code is also for 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.410
 focus and disable very much 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.069
 important the display has a 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.290
 backlight and is good 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:02.720
 readable both during the day and in the 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.700
 Something disturbing partially that partial 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.470
 the lighting is always on 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.580
 personally for the better 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.520
 if the light only at one 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.100
 keypress 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.540
 things is a loud acoustic alarm 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.760
 yes nice and good by the time 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.340
 Built-in gsm module is still available 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.870
 so some more possibilities for this 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.970
 will of course be a sim card with 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.860
 Number required is recommended 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.080
 a simple prepaid card with one 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.820
 mobile network your choice is important 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.740
 just that the receive as possible 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.550
 good is there you should definitely 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.290
 be careful 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.270
 but now to the benefits you 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.730
 thereby the alarm system can receive 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:37.890
 you or up to 6 phone numbers 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.840
 one after the other on the mobile phone call 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.730
 to inform you about an alarm 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.500
 also for example the telephone number 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.570
 the neighbor would definitely be here 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.730
 make sense because they react quickly 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:49.800
 could the police on the other hand should 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.870
 you better not use that gives up 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.580
 any case anger you can also the 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.640
 plant by sms focus or 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:58.020
 disable and over the pure function 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.380
 check what's in your house 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.450
 going 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.520
 for ios and android is a free 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.990
 app available to manage this 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.300
 and driving the system something 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:07.830
 simplifies the entire communication 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:10.560
 However, really only by sms 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:13.110
 or call start via bluetooth or even 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.940
 Wlan there are no possibilities 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.830
 reception or broadcasting power 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.049
 gsm mode gives you a bit more power 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:21.180
 be at least five of the maximum ten 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:22.830
 Points should be reached here and more 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.210
 Unfortunately I did not reach it 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.010
 Although I can with the example 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.990
 smartphone in the same mobile network always 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.730
 had almost full reception on the 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.050
 correct placement and sufficient 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.850
 you have to receive so necessarily 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.010
 otherwise the system in the 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.900
 emergency, of course, do not contact 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.190
 incredibly important in such a 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.640
 system of course the 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:43.530
 reliability and here was the sa2 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:45.690
 1700 certainly score during one 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:47.430
 period of about six weeks 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:49.170
 it did not paralyze a single mistake 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.210
 on the other side, the plant is stuck 

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:52.710
 always alarm when she should 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.840
 speak if a supposed burglary 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:57.480
 took place or one switched on 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.980
 plant carelessly the door or one of the 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.050
 with a sensor equipped window 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:02.790
 opened when one of the sensors 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:04.230
 alarm strikes it takes just under 30 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:05.550
 seconds until the service section 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:07.710
 loudly announces or the 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.390
 stored phone numbers 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:11.220
 so you have the possibility in the house 

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:12.210
 to go and the alarm system by hand 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:14.040
 deactivate 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.810
 if you have no remote or no 

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.850
 handy while you have the other way 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:19.530
 that works too after the 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:21.000
 you have sharp 30 by hand 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:23.550
 seconds until the plant 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.380
 is active thanks to sabotage protection is the 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.880
 Alarm also triggered directly if that 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:28.860
 unauthorized use of the 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.540
 wall bracket is taken down and 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.370
 Based on this example, I want you 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:34.890
 once the volume demonstrate that 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:50.730
 according to manufacturer is 96 decibels 

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:52.320
 So beware it will be loud 

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:54.180
 Volume should be for the most part 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:56.520
 flats and houses are enough around the 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:58.590
 alarm always true to take so, too 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:01.110
 in the sleep the radio range is enclosed 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:02.880
 about 300 meters with this indication 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:04.530
 refers to an open terrain and 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:06.840
 pretty much inside a house 

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:08.430
 is meaningless with the problems 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:10.740
 connection between the control unit and the 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:12.450
 But I did not have any sensors 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.169
 three floors everything worked 

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:15.780
 very well 

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:17.730
 that was so much information now 

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:18.480
 Therefore, we consider all again in Conclusion 

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:21.300
 together 

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:23.310
 the blaupunkt as a 2700 is one 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:24.780
 reliable alarm system with many 

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:26.250
 extension possibilities 

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:27.990
 the processing is good the 

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:29.790
 installation and setup easy 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:31.620
 perform and otherwise there is 

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:34.290
 various useful features like that 

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:35.970
 contact by mobile phone in case of alarm or 

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:38.520
 the built-in sabotage protection 

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:40.110
 As I said the GSM module could be something 

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:41.610
 be more powerful but otherwise 

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:42.660
 I have nothing on the system 

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:44.610
 exposing 

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:47.610
 Price is the start package currently 

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:49.470
 at 399 euros in the video description 

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:50.940
 is a corresponding amazon link there 

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:51.990
 you can always get the current price in 

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:53.970
 bring experience 

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:56.040
 the additional sensors could partially 

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:57.510
 be a little bit cheaper one 

00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:00.150
 window sensor costs for example 

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:02.700
 about 60 euros but if you have the 

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:04.620
 sensors are used intelligently and eg for 

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:06.330
 Some rooms use a motion detector 

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:08.400
 instead of four or more windows 

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:10.380
 sensors are the cost of such a 

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:13.260
 alarm system certainly in the frame 

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:15.090
 There are no follow-up costs with others 

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.919
 You sometimes have to do some models monthly 

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:19.350
 pay a fee that's up here 

00:07:16.919 --> 00:07:21.090
 no case so only the sim card 

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:23.340
 Of course, a certain credit has to be given 

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:25.650
 But should have a credit of 10 euros 

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:26.640
 one there already really long way off then come 

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:28.740
 we are already at the end again 

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:30.660
 this videos arrived and i hope 

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:32.610
 very much that you liked it though 

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:34.500
 the product into a slightly different one 

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:36.210
 if that's how it would be 

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:37.830
 I 'm so big on a thumb 

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:39.659
 Go up or leave a comment 

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:44.000
 and then we'll see each other next time 

00:07:39.659 --> 00:07:44.000
 good show until then
