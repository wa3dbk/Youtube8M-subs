00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.570
 voyager is a typical american without any 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.640
 compromises on monumentality and 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.300
 threatening and appearance of appearance can be seen

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:33.130
 But this model is already more than five years old. 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:36.300
 it's an office on wheels square cold

 the machine is literally stuffed

 Electronics seems clear now 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.960
 where does such a price come from 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.760
 getting behind the wheel is not a problem 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.829
 enough space for all

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:02.320

 Know yourself by pushing the buttons

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.890
 cleaned in the floor flush as it was not 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:28.810
 but it takes effort 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.780
 apply and most importantly every time 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:34.450
 push the front seats all the way forward 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.640
 uncomfortable sitting on second row chairs 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.979

 in the back row is also good but only 2 and 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.850
 3 here is clearly an extra trunk completely 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.070
 corresponds to the prefix grant in the title 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:00.280
 even in the seven-bed state of its volume 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.860
 makes 900 34 liters but there is one 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:11.230
 big minus in the minivan there is no spare 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:12.910

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.459
 rather positive value turned on

 Voyager courses are on the way 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:26.290

 minivan someone comes too tires 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:32.770
 but stable and predictable 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.290
 if the road is relatively flat it is mini 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.330
 veins are very comfortable small potholes and 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.959

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.230
 medium and large irregularities minivan 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.790

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.000
 not bad 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.150
 perfectly pulls and practically not

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:08.750
 even moving forward can 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:10.640
 relax and still on the track becomes 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.799
 not so frightening fuel consumption 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.819

 eventually selling chrysler grand voyager 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.030
 ruins by and large two things in common 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:25.370
 lack of interest of Russians to the minivan 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.470
 initially the highest price most expensive 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.690
 versions add gluttonous here 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:32.000
 engine power tax rates 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.709
 and trim does not match the price 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.379
 all this ultimately overlaps and 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:40.959
 American charm and comfort and the rest 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:40.959
