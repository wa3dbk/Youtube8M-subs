00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.070
 gamble so here the three departments they 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.470

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.710
 System requirement is the lamp jobs 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.990
 and head of 2013 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:43.590
 and so very normal requirements 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:46.380
 as because it 13 and all the extras yes 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.329
 It is expected to cost EUR 99 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:52.079
 you can already imagine it 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:53.159
 platform of course pc yes i think 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.840
 of course, pick 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.920
 I would irritate the area 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.960
 Get determined because it is simply the 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.840
 hammer is when the usa with it 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.340
 occurs and yes one could one the 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.310
 Write comments like you like that 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.550
 the usa 8 finds the add on edis the that 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:11.819
 titanium edition so that could change 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:14.370
 you write the comments and yes 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:16.650

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.599
 are game Farming Simulator 310 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.900
 including official change so that is 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:23.609
 Landscape 113 meters is said to have that 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.749
 already clarified yes there you can stop 

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:27.030
 in the comments we write that 

00:02:24.749 --> 00:02:28.079

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.689

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:36.120

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:38.219

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.719
