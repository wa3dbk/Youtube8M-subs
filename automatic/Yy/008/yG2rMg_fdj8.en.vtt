00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:14.460
 let's take a look at this are pinel 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:20.400
 number 8 the number derives from the dal 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:28.140
 blade length that you can 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:31.830
 see 8 cm in the total length of 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:36.239
 we are all around 10 centimeters e 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:44.579
 half hands can when the boxcutter e 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:47.070
 closed the handle and this beautiful wood 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.989
 knife has the peculiarity of this 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.940
 closing system called viro 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.989
 bloc 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:58.109
 let's see if you can see well 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:01:01.020
 this turns in this way practically 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:08.490
 the knife remains closed you cannot 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:09.710
 then open as you can see yes 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.630
 prevents it from opening 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:15.000
 accidentally in your pocket 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:24.659
 in contrast when the knife comes 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:29.630
 Open always operate this system 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.630
 at the bottom a knife becomes a fixed blade 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:39.500
 it is useful and life than for a Chilean 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:41.450
 accidentally bringing something 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.039
 the 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.130
 the blade closes on the fingers 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:48.079
 practically 15 cuts 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.390
 certainly it is not foolproof so it is necessary 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:52.579
 still pay attention to it a thousand and one 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:56.240
 just like a hand a blade knife 

00:01:52.579 --> 00:02:00.679
 fixed then making beat against 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:02.390
 something particularly hard but 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:05.409
 however this is a security in 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:14.599
 function effects because 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:20.299
 this is the stainless version you can 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:26.630
 see the pinelli brand is also there 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:29.260
 in carbon steel version in 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:34.650
 carbon steel is more easily e 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:39.090
 reliable loses a little bit 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:41.310
 the shine and takes on a patina that 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:47.640
 among so many piazza there are some do it 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:50.849
 really accentuate that in steel 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.970
 inox remains refined let's say a little more 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:52.970
 long 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:03:00.959
 not even one obviously suggests me 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:04.739
 I preferred this version on 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:08.970
 cost we are on under 10 euros at least 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:11.459
 I bought it from the decathlon I have it 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:14.879
 just paid spinning 10 euro tones 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:16.519
 and africa razor so very much italy 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:19.620
 very well 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:23.970
 I would say that to keep in your pocket for 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:28.500
 any one is any one trip 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:38.090
 anything not binding 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:38.090
 it's fine cutting can be seen 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:48.800
 this dry wood and then for 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:50.440
 the existing however you can see does the 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.560
 his duty 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:04:00.280
 great for classic cutting too 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:04:00.280
 opened than now here anyway 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:21.739
 small jobs small small necessities 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:25.370
 or in any case be a very useful part for 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:28.790
 eat the salami bread to say but 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:32.390
 how is he going to cut a rope for per 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:37.670
 cut a little to hope for 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:41.030
 something you can even play at 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:48.790
 to carve the wood by dying to make a 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:56.660
 picket for planting a tent or 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:05:02.170
 a shelter I would say that it does its job is 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:02.170
 a nice little uncomplicated 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:12.460
 a good purchase is fine 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.460
 recommended
