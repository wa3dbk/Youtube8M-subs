00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.940 
didn't do it very well that time though
what<00:02:29.360> if<00:02:29.450> we<00:02:29.540> were<00:02:29.600> to<00:02:29.660> go<00:02:29.960> way<00:02:30.440> down<00:02:30.590> from<00:02:30.860> the

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
what if we were to go way down from the

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.270 
what if we were to go way down from the
bottom<00:02:31.690> because<00:02:32.690> we<00:02:32.840> need<00:02:33.050> to<00:02:33.140> arch<00:02:33.320> it<00:02:33.440> yes<00:02:34.040> so

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
that one of them gets the TNT there we

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.710 
that one of them gets the TNT there we
go

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.670 
understand that I can do that but
technically<00:03:08.420> if<00:03:08.570> you<00:03:08.720> first<00:03:08.990> start<00:03:09.230> this<00:03:09.380> game

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
technically if you first start this game

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.250 
technically if you first start this game
you<00:03:10.430> don't<00:03:10.490> get<00:03:10.640> that<00:03:10.850> ability<00:03:11.090> till<00:03:11.570> a<00:03:11.930> little

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
you don't get that ability till a little

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.770 
you don't get that ability till a little
bit<00:03:12.410> farther<00:03:12.740> in<00:03:12.980> the<00:03:13.070> game<00:03:13.100> so<00:03:13.730> we're<00:03:13.940> I'm

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
bit farther in the game so we're I'm

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.370 
bit farther in the game so we're I'm
gonna<00:03:14.990> do<00:03:15.170> my<00:03:15.290> best<00:03:15.320> not<00:03:15.650> to<00:03:15.860> use<00:03:16.340> that
