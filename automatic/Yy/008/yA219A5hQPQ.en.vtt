00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 and how about tennessee we're still 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:09.599
 in the one box and the motherboard that is 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:12.360
 the m 5 97 this motherboard is fine to 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.860
 a good price I think he did not want it in 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.220
 I really wanted another but as there was no 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:21.130
 bad act that brings and when it comes to me 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:24.810
 whole that this motherboard does not have 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:28.810
 as it is said does not have pci express 3.0 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.550
 but pci express 2.0 good I got to 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.629
 investigate research is not really 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:37.300
 such a big difference between ps3 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:41.309
 2.0 and 3.0 since there is only one 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:43.839
 maybe 1% or 2% more power 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.960
 good with the graphics card that I'm leaving 

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:50.280
 to buy that is the 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:54.269
 the 79 70 well I already ordered it for ebay 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:57.300
 3 gigs really what put me 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:59.370
 investigate on the web and what there is is a 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.670
 2 percent difference in power and 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.990
 so I stayed with this motherboard 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.650
 is 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:10.590
 Let's motherboard and unpacking 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.950
 md and good and I think I had 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:17.700
 clear uncovered to see them but good 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:20.820
 let's see good as I do not know much about 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:24.360
 this motherboard and they can correct me 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.730
 in what I was wrong ok ok we're going to 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.200
 I hope I do not have to be every 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.990
 university in something here with that of 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:35.790
 load me the static that here with a 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:39.240
 metal we go to the unpacked 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:42.590
 you should put the camera up here that 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:46.200
 we are going to the unpacked as you see 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:49.590
 I'm in the engine so that there is the 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:53.850
 ethics for the bad guys and the circuits 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.800
 sorry ok let's see to know the 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.710
 first time you do this to us not what 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:02.160
 I had taken it since I compared it ok 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.610
 let's put here or better here in the 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:08.910
 floor on the floor as you want to call 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:12.730
 what are we going to see how you see 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:17.950
 they have four slots as always 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:20.500
 for memories ddr3 I do not know how much the 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:24.430
 supports but I bought 8 gigs others 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:27.099
 eight giga has this pci express 2.0 if 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:31.680
 I'm not wrong if I did not run 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:34.299
 I said I do not know much about motherboard and 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:38.019
 let me see the processor goes there 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:40.350
 it is known that the audio input of 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:46.410
 tangana 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:49.170
 usb 3.0 2.0 and how many more things 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.060
 you can see it from there good 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.950
 I think that's all they know not him 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.640
 I can give a totally explanation 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.590
 defined as 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:01.400
 of what is component of 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:03.110
 computer is from the motherboard and that 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.040
 it's all I hope you liked it 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:08.950
 give him a line 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:13.680
 and put it in favorite and see you later 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.680
