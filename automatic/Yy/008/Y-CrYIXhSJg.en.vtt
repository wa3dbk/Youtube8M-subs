00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:05.390

 5533 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:10.460

 I am connected to the clerk 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:22.520
 It seems that it is quite crowded now, but it does not connect well 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:23.869
 Is there a lot of people switching from Softbank to cheap sim with number portability? 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.800
 It might also 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:29.830
 Well, I don't care at all because my phone bill is free. 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.710
 Thanking you in advance 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:36.940
 That's right I'm still considering 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.940
 Well e Innovation 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:55.729
 I have been continued here 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:56.640
 So it is that sort of Are there or I eh there Ahhe' hero still the new 

00:00:55.729 --> 00:01:03.149
 iphone 4 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:08.290
 out that now rate plan hey there was're interested in seeing a softening discount in the transfer in x 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:11.770
 But Well than there is also a feeling you do not want to transfer I want to ride too 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:17.440
 It is'll Ha ha ha Now That's right 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:23.260
 Though it's so dig wherever you are asked if we are considering the transfer 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:24.040
 Ask me what kind of place do you feel attractive to the hero ? 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:28.280
 It was done 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:34.929
 Maybe now Oh, write the contract period and date so far 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:36.470
 I think that you are checking how many points you can get in the factor 

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:40.480
 Hyacher 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:44.230
 Another 10,000 ah 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:48.280
 It's 6 and it's 6 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:51.580
 Oh, I just said 1,160 yen. 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:54.300
 Oh, it's the split price for the main unit 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:58.260
 Over there is a model change hall 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:02.540
 It is the case of the transfer is was said that blue coral and North 550 yen 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:08.060
 Oh yes or if it is a model import, it is the place of 1,160 yen 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:11.550
 When you issue in that it has put to the trade I see it is that it becomes 100 yen 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:16.250
 In to say I would be in this 100 yen, for example, 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:21.860
 You can change the model to the Well one year later to also those of another 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:24.280
 If you switch to another company, the discount to 100 yen will be lost. 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.280
 Oh yes 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.770
 Door 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:36.110
 It is a concept 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:40.520
 Well there is a high end to continue this point in the end 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.720
 I can not get around 10000 or 15000 points at all this year as well 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:47.030
 Is it 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:51.950
 Does it mean that I can not get my business status for a while? 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:53.110
 Oh, I got 15,000 points last year . 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:03:00.130
 so 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:03:01.240
 After all, I did not change the model because I used it after the winter, but that may not be the case 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.750
 is not it 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:06.610
 Yes, I understand 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.610
 Thank you so much 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.569
 Yes excuse me 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:10.569
 Hmm 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:20.660
 Who 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:21.800
 Unfortunately so you can get a so-called beggar point 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.280
 Could not 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:28.860
 So what do you say and what are you saying now 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:31.350
 I don't like updating , it 's a contract renewal month. 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:37.530
 So not'm now 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:43.860
 It was strongly suggested that it would be a good idea to have an update like November. 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:49.500
 If you say why, if you move out now , it will be 10,260 yen as a venue fee first 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:51.370
 Then as fee 2,160 yen and 3240 yen in transference place 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:56.110
 It will take more minutes 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:04:03.430
 And there is one more charge left, but there is no discount for it 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:10.659
 It takes one minute plump of 2570 yen that it takes 18,230 yen in total 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:11.360
 It is 10,260 of cancellation fee when we moved out in November which this is update like 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:16.579
 It does not come from 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:17.600
 It is said that it will be much cheaper because it does not cost 2570 yen for the last remaining good one 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:22.130
 It was done 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:26.660
 We can not give points in, but if we can suggest to our customers 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:31.350
 It is said that you can get your iphone 5 to trade now directly below 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:32.940
 Out to trade the 64 giga of iphone 6 and change the model 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:39.000
 If you made a contract 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:42.740
 Although the installment fee after the monthly installment is usually 1,160 yen 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.920
 This means that it will be 100th, that is 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:51.140
 1060 yen over 24 minutes 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:55.270
 It means that it will be profitable, but if this has been changed to another model again a year 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:05:00.139
 Though I can not receive application so much 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:04.610
 I'm sorry I received 15,000 points last year 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:06.870
 It is a pity that this kind of system itself is completely gone 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:10.890
 I myself 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:12.630
 By chance I do not know whether it was not applicable for the point but I heard there 

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:16.560
 I didn't tell you 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:20.620
 The guy such as those taking a video with a phone call of this kind of inquiry 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:25.800
 That's the point something like that softbank 3 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:25.800
 I'm sorry I think it is an appropriate decision
