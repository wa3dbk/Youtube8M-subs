00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:07.040
 I passed we will hear with the 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.040
 noise 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:12.010
 the small generator bought at leroy 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.340
 poleaxe 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:14.660
 copy diama 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.070
 as there are hundreds and 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.600
 hundreds in every country in the world has 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:21.070
 not really and in all versions 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:23.080
 electric possible and imaginable 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.650
 so this one as we were like 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:30.300
 margaret in France yields 1,230 volts to 50 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:32.920
 hertz and it's well written here wholesale 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.270
 here to start it first 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:38.010
 time it was a bit of a struggle 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.640
 then I'll get a little more oil 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.930
 than expected because 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.340
 saint quentin which means 2% I 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.720
 preferred to put two enemies is better 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.670
 a little too much oil in a 2 time that 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.470
 parra is the smoke is not serious 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.780
 even if it does not please the ecologists 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.440
 have a tight engine that costs a lot 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.890
 more expensive 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.239
 here at the back the candle appears 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.530
 that she is not great and that she needs the 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:02.530
 replace for now it's going 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.280
 we see that when compared to what we 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:10.100
 see to the classical model 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.229
 we see here that there is a little bit of 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.159
 additional protections on the side of 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.960
 exhaust 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.939
 so a nice little thing also those who 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.569
 have they were masters a small vote 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:23.429
 m which allows especially to see that it's 

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:26.090
 fight not bad to regulate but good 

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:28.229
 runs relatively tight cool habib 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.999
 it's not a big deal because there is 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.999
 nobody behind and there 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.310
 a small coup de la charge binds her to 500 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:39.930
 watt 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:42.000
 with hand electric heaters 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.260
 it has 500 watts and so the bass to 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.409
 regulate already significantly better 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.210
 we see that we feel well 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.039
 even 140 bugs I do not know 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.930
 the flight quality but it was not 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:53.340
 extraordinary 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.980
 but good stick does not 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.510
 sensitive electronics when we are not 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:00.750
 of sensitive electronics behind but 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:01.920
 just consumers of the small kind 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.340
 power tool 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:08.270
 camping chauvette lighting I think 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.270
 that everything will be fine 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.150
 and my ski what's left to add is 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.630
 that as much as I fought the first time 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.560
 to light it as much now 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.690
 I put a game but the starter 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.819
 I draw a gently blow and pau 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.520
 second shot it starts like a charm 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:24.930
 every time so 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.880
 must not be slaughtered at the exit 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.290
 cardboard in fact it works very well the 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.210
 first time just a little stress 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.100
 it's like in other areas there are 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:35.750
 club comes back to foix which is kind 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.750
 that's good going to stop there for the moment
