00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
macbook pro laptops it's been a while

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.390 
macbook pro laptops it's been a while
since<00:00:09.599> we've<00:00:09.780> seen<00:00:09.870> a<00:00:10.019> macbook<00:00:10.590> pro<00:00:10.860> refresh

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
since we've seen a macbook pro refresh

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.589 
since we've seen a macbook pro refresh
although<00:00:11.700> at<00:00:11.820> first<00:00:11.849> glance<00:00:12.210> you<00:00:12.389> might<00:00:12.540> think

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
although at first glance you might think

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.360 
although at first glance you might think
these<00:00:12.900> look<00:00:12.929> pretty<00:00:13.320> much<00:00:13.740> the<00:00:13.799> same<00:00:13.920> as<00:00:14.219> the

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
these look pretty much the same as the

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.310 
these look pretty much the same as the
macbook<00:00:15.240> pros<00:00:15.450> you<00:00:15.570> already<00:00:15.900> know<00:00:16.020> and<00:00:16.199> that's

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
macbook pros you already know and that's

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.779 
macbook pros you already know and that's
because<00:00:16.440> on<00:00:16.710> the<00:00:16.830> outside<00:00:17.250> they<00:00:17.430> actually<00:00:17.670> are

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
because on the outside they actually are

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.970 
because on the outside they actually are
pretty<00:00:18.029> much<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.359> same<00:00:18.539> there<00:00:19.289> are<00:00:19.470> however<00:00:19.710> a

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
pretty much the same there are however a

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.609 
pretty much the same there are however a
lot<00:00:20.220> of<00:00:20.369> big<00:00:20.520> changes<00:00:20.730> on<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.359> inside<00:00:21.900> most

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
lot of big changes on the inside most

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.410 
lot of big changes on the inside most
importantly<00:00:23.130> these<00:00:23.369> guys<00:00:23.609> have<00:00:23.820> all<00:00:24.029> switched

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
importantly these guys have all switched

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
then on the 15-inch like this model and

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.959 
then on the 15-inch like this model and
the<00:00:51.629> 17<00:00:52.079> inch<00:00:52.260> there's<00:00:53.070> also<00:00:53.370> discrete

that's<00:01:00.960> kind<00:01:01.230> of<00:01:01.289> a<00:01:01.410> major<00:01:01.739> change<00:01:02.250> there<00:01:02.910> and

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
that's kind of a major change there and

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.690 
that's kind of a major change there and
