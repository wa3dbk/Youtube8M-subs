the<00:00:43.830> pillar<00:00:44.130> before<00:00:44.580> we<00:00:44.670> glue<00:00:44.850> it<00:00:44.880> I<00:00:45.210> use<00:00:45.630> a<00:00:45.660> hot

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
the pillar before we glue it I use a hot

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.720 
the pillar before we glue it I use a hot
glue<00:00:45.900> gun<00:00:46.140> with<00:00:46.530> some<00:00:46.680> hot<00:00:46.830> glue<00:00:47.010> make<00:00:47.550> sure

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
glue gun with some hot glue make sure

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.130 
glue gun with some hot glue make sure
they're<00:00:47.880> glued<00:00:48.090> down<00:00:48.210> real<00:00:48.540> good<00:00:48.750> before<00:00:48.930> I

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
they're glued down real good before I

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.350 
they're glued down real good before I
apply<00:00:49.440> that<00:00:49.590> filler<00:00:50.130> and<00:00:50.340> I<00:00:50.910> haven't<00:00:51.120> had<00:00:51.210> any

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
apply that filler and I haven't had any

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.410 
apply that filler and I haven't had any
problems<00:00:51.780> with<00:00:51.930> them<00:00:52.050> separating<00:00:52.590> from<00:00:52.710> there

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
problems with them separating from there

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.150 
problems with them separating from there
so<00:00:54.420> this<00:00:55.080> is<00:00:55.140> what<00:00:55.320> we're<00:00:55.410> gonna<00:00:55.470> use<00:00:55.590> then<00:00:55.980> in

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
so this is what we're gonna use then in

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.770 
so this is what we're gonna use then in
the<00:00:56.220> point<00:00:56.430> when<00:00:56.850> it<00:00:56.940> comes<00:00:57.150> to<00:00:57.390> actually

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
the point when it comes to actually

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.350 
the point when it comes to actually
