and picked up shipment I had at the bike

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:00.520 
and picked up shipment I had at the bike
shop<00:00:58.629> which<00:00:59.629> is<00:00:59.750> why<00:00:59.870> I<00:00:59.930> did<00:01:00.140> this<00:01:00.230> review

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
shop which is why I did this review

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.220 
shop which is why I did this review
today<00:01:00.710> the<00:01:00.829> back<00:01:00.980> is<00:01:01.100> really<00:01:01.399> cool<00:01:01.609> really

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.230 
today the back is really cool really

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.079 
today the back is really cool really
step<00:01:03.230> it<00:01:03.590> has<00:01:03.980> these<00:01:04.160> extenders<00:01:04.640> on<00:01:04.789> the<00:01:04.879> side

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
step it has these extenders on the side

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:07.029 
step it has these extenders on the side
so<00:01:05.420> whenever<00:01:05.720> you<00:01:05.930> don't<00:01:06.170> need<00:01:06.440> a<00:01:06.679> bunch<00:01:06.830> of

00:01:07.029 --> 00:01:07.039 
so whenever you don't need a bunch of

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:10.740 
so whenever you don't need a bunch of
stuff<00:01:07.250> in<00:01:07.369> it<00:01:07.490> you<00:01:07.610> can<00:01:07.640> make<00:01:07.789> it<00:01:07.940> smaller

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.990 

but<00:01:11.170> right<00:01:11.320> now<00:01:11.380> as<00:01:11.830> I<00:01:12.040> said<00:01:12.100> I<00:01:12.250> having<00:01:12.520> full<00:01:12.790> of

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
but right now as I said I having full of

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.580 
but right now as I said I having full of
stuff<00:01:13.270> so<00:01:13.510> I<00:01:13.690> have<00:01:13.810> them<00:01:13.930> stretched<00:01:14.230> out<00:01:14.470> on

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
stuff so I have them stretched out on

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.040 
stuff so I have them stretched out on
both<00:01:14.770> sides<00:01:15.040> all<00:01:15.280> the<00:01:15.400> way<00:01:15.520> I<00:01:15.730> guess<00:01:16.330> basically

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:17.050 
both sides all the way I guess basically

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:18.480
