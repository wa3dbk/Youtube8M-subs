first one as you'll notice right now is
the<00:00:26.539> spread<00:00:26.869> of<00:00:26.899> guns<00:00:27.380> now<00:00:28.039> this<00:00:28.160> weapon<00:00:28.489> is

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.550 
the spread of guns now this weapon is

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.279 
the spread of guns now this weapon is
the<00:00:28.699> upgraded<00:00:28.820> tar<00:00:29.359> and<00:00:29.720> you<00:00:29.809> can<00:00:29.930> clearly<00:00:30.109> see

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:30.289 
the upgraded tar and you can clearly see

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:31.599 
the upgraded tar and you can clearly see
that<00:00:30.470> the<00:00:30.680> weapon<00:00:31.039> spread<00:00:31.220> is<00:00:31.309> very<00:00:31.489> very

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:31.609 
that the weapon spread is very very

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:34.420 
that the weapon spread is very very
tight<00:00:31.910> very<00:00:31.939> very<00:00:32.449> close<00:00:33.260> together<00:00:33.470> but<00:00:34.220> then

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 
tight very very close together but then

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.280 
tight very very close together but then
we<00:00:34.790> go<00:00:35.120> to<00:00:35.150> a<00:00:35.329> clip<00:00:35.629> with<00:00:35.780> the<00:00:35.900> unbanked

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:36.290 
we go to a clip with the unbanked

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:37.630 
we go to a clip with the unbanked
version<00:00:36.800> and<00:00:36.890> you<00:00:36.949> can<00:00:37.070> see<00:00:37.159> the<00:00:37.190> bullets<00:00:37.519> are

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
version and you can see the bullets are

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.049 
version and you can see the bullets are
going<00:00:37.870> freaking<00:00:38.870> everywhere<00:00:39.320> and<00:00:39.620> in<00:00:40.550> the

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:41.059 
going freaking everywhere and in the

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:42.759 
going freaking everywhere and in the
long<00:00:41.239> term<00:00:41.629> and<00:00:41.690> what<00:00:42.350> this<00:00:42.440> actually<00:00:42.589> means

00:00:42.759 --> 00:00:42.769 
long term and what this actually means

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:45.819 
long term and what this actually means
is<00:00:43.250> that<00:00:43.870> if<00:00:44.870> you<00:00:45.050> don't<00:00:45.199> have<00:00:45.379> pack<00:00:45.589> punch

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:45.829 
is that if you don't have pack punch

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:47.860 
is that if you don't have pack punch
guns<00:00:46.129> then<00:00:46.519> you<00:00:46.909> waste<00:00:47.210> a<00:00:47.360> lot<00:00:47.449> of<00:00:47.510> em<00:00:47.720> up

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
guns then you waste a lot of em up

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:48.819 
guns then you waste a lot of em up
because<00:00:48.019> you're<00:00:48.140> missing<00:00:48.409> a<00:00:48.470> lot<00:00:48.559> of<00:00:48.680> zombies

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:48.829 
because you're missing a lot of zombies

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:50.950 
because you're missing a lot of zombies
and<00:00:49.280> so<00:00:49.460> it<00:00:50.030> seems<00:00:50.329> like<00:00:50.480> you're<00:00:50.629> doing<00:00:50.780> less

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
and so it seems like you're doing less

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.590 
and so it seems like you're doing less
damage<00:00:51.350> and<00:00:51.500> that<00:00:51.590> you're<00:00:51.710> not<00:00:52.329> killing<00:00:53.329> them

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
damage and that you're not killing them

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.689 
damage and that you're not killing them
very<00:00:53.960> very<00:00:54.079> well<00:00:54.170> at<00:00:54.410> all<00:00:54.559> so<00:00:55.190> it<00:00:55.550> basically

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:55.699 
very very well at all so it basically

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:57.729 
very very well at all so it basically
means<00:00:56.000> a<00:00:56.149> pack<00:00:56.300> a<00:00:56.329> punch<00:00:56.629> is<00:00:56.899> a<00:00:57.289> lot<00:00:57.590> more

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
means a pack a punch is a lot more

00:00:57.739 --> 00:00:59.049 
means a pack a punch is a lot more
essential<00:00:58.219> now<00:00:58.429> than<00:00:58.640> it<00:00:58.730> ever<00:00:58.789> was<00:00:59.000> before

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
essential now than it ever was before

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:01.990 
essential now than it ever was before
and<00:00:59.660> there's<00:01:00.379> a<00:01:00.440> second<00:01:00.739> thing<00:01:00.920> which<00:01:01.250> is<00:01:01.550> the

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
and there's a second thing which is the

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.880 
and there's a second thing which is the
double<00:01:02.329> pack<00:01:02.480> a<00:01:02.510> punch<00:01:02.750> it's<00:01:03.530> not<00:01:03.649> really<00:01:03.859> a

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
double pack a punch it's not really a

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.919 
double pack a punch it's not really a
double<00:01:04.160> pack<00:01:04.339> a<00:01:04.369> punch<00:01:04.640> but<00:01:04.940> it's<00:01:05.690> close

00:01:05.919 --> 00:01:05.929 
double pack a punch but it's close

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:07.870 
double pack a punch but it's close
enough<00:01:05.960> you<00:01:06.679> pack<00:01:06.860> lunch<00:01:07.009> once<00:01:07.280> for<00:01:07.700> five

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
enough you pack lunch once for five

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.270 
enough you pack lunch once for five
thousand<00:01:08.300> points<00:01:08.420> and<00:01:08.750> you<00:01:08.869> can<00:01:09.050> choose<00:01:09.410> to<00:01:09.440> go

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
thousand points and you can choose to go

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.950 
thousand points and you can choose to go
to<00:01:10.310> the<00:01:10.429> back<00:01:10.610> once<00:01:10.789> again<00:01:10.910> and<00:01:11.390> spend<00:01:11.660> two

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
to the back once again and spend two

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.630 
to the back once again and spend two
thousand<00:01:12.440> points<00:01:12.590> to<00:01:12.800> get<00:01:13.100> the<00:01:13.220> pack<00:01:13.369> a<00:01:13.399> punch

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
thousand points to get the pack a punch

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.419 
thousand points to get the pack a punch
twice<00:01:14.020> and<00:01:15.020> it's<00:01:15.619> not<00:01:15.800> actually<00:01:16.130> a<00:01:16.190> double

00:01:16.419 --> 00:01:16.429 
twice and it's not actually a double

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:17.770 
twice and it's not actually a double
pack<00:01:16.550> a<00:01:16.580> punch<00:01:16.789> what<00:01:16.940> it<00:01:17.060> is<00:01:17.149> is<00:01:17.390> a<00:01:17.420> new

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
attachment for the gun how this can be

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.449 
attachment for the gun how this can be
in<00:01:20.300> the<00:01:20.390> shape<00:01:20.569> of<00:01:20.810> a<00:01:21.170> site<00:01:21.440> or<00:01:21.679> can<00:01:22.069> be<00:01:22.160> in<00:01:22.280> the

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
a long barrel for the shotgun but you

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.089 
a long barrel for the shotgun but you
get<00:01:28.849> two<00:01:29.390> new<00:01:29.780> features<00:01:30.050> on<00:01:30.440> black<00:01:30.770> ops<00:01:30.920> 2

00:01:31.089 --> 00:01:31.099 
get two new features on black ops 2

00:01:31.099 --> 00:01:33.040 
get two new features on black ops 2
rather<00:01:31.369> than<00:01:31.550> the<00:01:31.670> original<00:01:32.090> which<00:01:32.239> you<00:01:32.869> just

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.050 
rather than the original which you just

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:34.660 
rather than the original which you just
got<00:01:33.200> more<00:01:33.349> damage<00:01:33.770> more<00:01:33.979> ammo<00:01:34.280> and<00:01:34.459> that<00:01:34.550> was

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
got more damage more ammo and that was

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.150 
got more damage more ammo and that was
it<00:01:34.819> but<00:01:34.970> now<00:01:35.179> bullet<00:01:36.080> spread<00:01:36.229> is<00:01:36.590> a<00:01:36.649> lot<00:01:36.979> lot

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:37.160 
it but now bullet spread is a lot lot

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.669 
it but now bullet spread is a lot lot
tighter<00:01:37.399> although<00:01:38.360> it<00:01:38.479> always<00:01:39.020> was<00:01:39.200> before

00:01:39.669 --> 00:01:39.679 
tighter although it always was before

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:40.960 
tighter although it always was before
because<00:01:39.800> in<00:01:40.009> the<00:01:40.099> previous<00:01:40.220> games<00:01:40.700> it<00:01:40.880> was

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
because in the previous games it was

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.260 
because in the previous games it was
always<00:01:41.179> an<00:01:42.050> exact<00:01:42.619> laser<00:01:42.920> beam<00:01:43.280> whereas<00:01:44.030> now

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
always an exact laser beam whereas now

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.900 
always an exact laser beam whereas now
it's<00:01:44.810> going<00:01:45.110> to<00:01:45.229> be<00:01:45.489> there's<00:01:46.489> a<00:01:46.580> little<00:01:46.729> bit<00:01:46.849> of

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:46.910 
it's going to be there's a little bit of

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:48.550 
it's going to be there's a little bit of
spread<00:01:47.179> until<00:01:47.450> you<00:01:47.720> pack<00:01:47.869> a<00:01:47.899> punch<00:01:48.170> in<00:01:48.379> which

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
spread until you pack a punch in which
