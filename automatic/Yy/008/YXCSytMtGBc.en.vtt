anyway<00:01:30.390> so<00:01:30.450> thoughts<00:01:30.899> on<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.140> game<00:01:31.259> so<00:01:31.530> far

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
anyway so thoughts on the game so far

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.539 
anyway so thoughts on the game so far
and<00:01:33.350> it's<00:01:34.350> pretty<00:01:34.679> fun<00:01:34.920> i'm<00:01:35.190> going<00:01:35.340> to<00:01:35.399> keep

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
and it's pretty fun i'm going to keep

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.669 
and it's pretty fun i'm going to keep
playing<00:01:35.819> it<00:01:36.470> but<00:01:38.569> the<00:01:39.569> movement<00:01:39.840> system<00:01:40.530> i

00:01:40.669 --> 00:01:40.679 
playing it but the movement system i

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:42.710 
playing it but the movement system i
think<00:01:40.920> is<00:01:41.039> a<00:01:41.069> little<00:01:41.369> bit<00:01:41.520> wonky<00:01:41.700> like<00:01:42.119> I<00:01:42.330> kind

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
think is a little bit wonky like I kind

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.080 
think is a little bit wonky like I kind
of<00:01:42.780> just<00:01:42.959> wish<00:01:43.170> it<00:01:43.200> had<00:01:43.350> full<00:01:43.740> on<00:01:43.920> FPS<00:01:44.490> movement

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
of just wish it had full on FPS movement

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.830 
of just wish it had full on FPS movement
because<00:01:46.729> switching<00:01:47.729> between<00:01:47.880> like<00:01:48.360> regular

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
because switching between like regular

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.529 
because switching between like regular
and<00:01:49.140> a<00:01:49.259> mode<00:01:49.619> is<00:01:49.979> a<00:01:50.009> little<00:01:50.369> bit<00:01:50.580> I<00:01:50.850> just<00:01:51.420> don't

00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:51.539 
and a mode is a little bit I just don't

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:54.109 
and a mode is a little bit I just don't
like<00:01:51.750> it<00:01:51.810> all<00:01:52.110> right<00:01:52.459> the<00:01:53.459> video<00:01:53.729> won't<00:01:53.909> be

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
like it all right the video won't be

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.850
