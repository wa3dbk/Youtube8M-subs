00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.640 
the very beginning but if I like killed
this<00:04:57.410> guy<00:04:58.690> killed<00:04:59.690> him<00:04:59.870> saved<00:05:00.169> at<00:05:00.320> the<00:05:00.410> flag

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
this guy killed him saved at the flag

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:15.550 
this guy killed him saved at the flag
right<00:05:00.889> there<00:05:01.130> and

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:15.560 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:19.189 

okay<00:05:16.560> so<00:05:16.620> like<00:05:17.130> I<00:05:17.310> died<00:05:17.840> starts<00:05:18.840> me<00:05:18.930> from<00:05:19.080> my

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:19.199 
okay so like I died starts me from my

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:23.120 
okay so like I died starts me from my
last<00:05:19.349> save<00:05:19.590> point<00:05:20.630> turbo<00:05:21.630> on<00:05:21.810> and<00:05:22.020> off<00:05:22.139> toggles

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.130 
last save point turbo on and off toggles

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:29.950 
last save point turbo on and off toggles
just<00:05:23.610> because<00:05:23.910> you<00:05:24.300> know<00:05:24.620> loop<00:05:25.620> to<00:05:25.889> do<00:05:27.470> block

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:29.960 
just because you know loop to do block

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.860 
just because you know loop to do block
not<00:05:30.960> very<00:05:31.289> useful<00:05:32.300> unless<00:05:33.300> you're<00:05:33.509> trying<00:05:33.690> to

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:33.870 
not very useful unless you're trying to

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:37.969 
not very useful unless you're trying to
die<00:05:35.150> but<00:05:36.150> eventually<00:05:36.810> like<00:05:37.080> if<00:05:37.319> you<00:05:37.650> level<00:05:37.830> up

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:37.979 
die but eventually like if you level up

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:39.770 
die but eventually like if you level up
enough<00:05:38.280> the<00:05:38.490> skills<00:05:38.819> will<00:05:39.030> increase<00:05:39.150> so<00:05:39.690> it

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:39.780 
enough the skills will increase so it

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.260 
enough the skills will increase so it
becomes<00:05:40.110> like<00:05:40.259> a<00:05:40.319> more<00:05:40.560> powerful<00:05:40.710> hero<00:05:41.370> power

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 
becomes like a more powerful hero power

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:45.290 
becomes like a more powerful hero power
hit<00:05:42.690> is<00:05:42.870> less<00:05:43.110> random<00:05:43.860> because<00:05:44.130> it<00:05:44.370> just<00:05:44.490> it's

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 
hit is less random because it just it's

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.659 
hit is less random because it just it's
very<00:05:45.630> a<00:05:45.750> random<00:05:46.259> hit<00:05:46.409> cuz<00:05:46.740> like<00:05:46.949> you<00:05:47.340> can<00:05:47.520> deal

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:47.669 
very a random hit cuz like you can deal

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:50.719 
very a random hit cuz like you can deal
like<00:05:47.940> one<00:05:48.750> damage<00:05:49.139> with<00:05:49.319> it<00:05:49.470> every<00:05:50.190> like<00:05:50.370> like

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:50.729 
like one damage with it every like like

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:53.360 
like one damage with it every like like
that<00:05:50.759> I<00:05:51.180> dealt<00:05:51.449> three<00:05:51.990> with<00:05:52.319> it<00:05:52.470> and<00:05:52.650> then<00:05:53.220> that

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:53.370 
that I dealt three with it and then that

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:56.330 
that I dealt three with it and then that
I<00:05:53.400> dealt<00:05:53.639> too<00:05:53.880> so<00:05:54.240> like<00:05:54.590> it<00:05:55.590> can<00:05:55.740> do<00:05:55.860> very<00:05:56.069> low

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:56.340 
I dealt too so like it can do very low

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:58.070 
I dealt too so like it can do very low
amounts<00:05:56.789> or<00:05:56.880> it<00:05:56.940> can<00:05:57.060> do<00:05:57.120> very<00:05:57.389> high<00:05:57.569> amounts

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 
amounts or it can do very high amounts

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:02.839 
amounts or it can do very high amounts
it's<00:05:58.349> kind<00:05:58.830> of<00:05:58.919> just<00:05:59.610> randomized<00:06:01.580> but<00:06:02.580> like<00:06:02.729> it

00:06:02.839 --> 00:06:02.849 
it's kind of just randomized but like it

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:04.520 
it's kind of just randomized but like it
becomes<00:06:03.060> less<00:06:03.240> random<00:06:03.659> and<00:06:03.780> more<00:06:03.930> powerful

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:04.530 
becomes less random and more powerful

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:07.159 
becomes less random and more powerful
attack<00:06:05.430> buffs<00:06:05.699> block<00:06:06.270> eventually<00:06:06.840> will<00:06:06.960> block

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:07.169 
attack buffs block eventually will block

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:09.770 
attack buffs block eventually will block
all<00:06:07.409> the<00:06:07.470> damage<00:06:08.130> for<00:06:08.310> that<00:06:08.430> turn<00:06:08.729> which<00:06:09.509> comes

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:09.780 
all the damage for that turn which comes

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:12.010 
all the damage for that turn which comes
more<00:06:10.050> useful<00:06:10.349> for<00:06:10.500> bosses<00:06:10.710> that'll<00:06:11.220> use<00:06:11.400> like

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:12.020 
more useful for bosses that'll use like

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:14.209 
more useful for bosses that'll use like
charge<00:06:13.020> up<00:06:13.229> attacks<00:06:13.530> or<00:06:13.710> whatever<00:06:13.949> because

00:06:14.209 --> 00:06:14.219 
charge up attacks or whatever because

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:16.129 
charge up attacks or whatever because
you<00:06:14.340> can<00:06:14.520> just<00:06:14.639> like<00:06:14.880> block<00:06:15.240> the<00:06:15.509> turn<00:06:15.750> of<00:06:16.020> the

00:06:16.129 --> 00:06:16.139 
you can just like block the turn of the

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:18.350 
you can just like block the turn of the
special<00:06:16.979> attack<00:06:17.280> or<00:06:17.430> whatever<00:06:17.610> and<00:06:18.000> then<00:06:18.150> just

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:18.360 
special attack or whatever and then just

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.870 
special attack or whatever and then just
hit<00:06:18.840> on<00:06:18.990> the<00:06:19.050> next<00:06:19.259> turn<00:06:19.400> power<00:06:20.400> attack<00:06:20.639> if<00:06:20.849> you

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:20.880 
hit on the next turn power attack if you

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.850 
hit on the next turn power attack if you
have<00:06:21.090> enough<00:06:21.270> MP<00:06:21.630> by<00:06:21.810> that<00:06:21.960> point<00:06:22.199> because<00:06:22.560> you

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:22.860 
have enough MP by that point because you

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:25.760 
have enough MP by that point because you
know<00:06:23.780> that<00:06:24.780> is<00:06:24.960> also<00:06:25.259> taking<00:06:25.530> into<00:06:25.710> account

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:25.770 
know that is also taking into account

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:27.499 
know that is also taking into account
like<00:06:26.130> I<00:06:26.250> can't<00:06:26.490> just<00:06:26.550> keep<00:06:26.849> pressing<00:06:27.150> power

00:06:27.499 --> 00:06:27.509 
like I can't just keep pressing power

00:06:27.509 --> 00:06:29.420 
like I can't just keep pressing power
attack<00:06:27.750> forever<00:06:28.110> I<00:06:28.229> run<00:06:28.469> out<00:06:28.620> of<00:06:28.650> MP<00:06:29.099> and<00:06:29.340> then

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:29.430 
attack forever I run out of MP and then

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:31.240 
attack forever I run out of MP and then
I<00:06:29.490> can't<00:06:29.699> use<00:06:29.729> it<00:06:29.849> anymore

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:31.250 
I can't use it anymore

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:38.839 
I can't use it anymore
pressing<00:06:32.250> P<00:06:32.690> P<00:06:33.690> P<00:06:33.719> P<00:06:33.870> P<00:06:34.080> P<00:06:34.289> champ<00:06:35.780> okay<00:06:36.780> so<00:06:37.849> there

00:06:38.839 --> 00:06:38.849 
pressing P P P P P P champ okay so there

00:06:38.849 --> 00:06:42.559 
pressing P P P P P P champ okay so there
is<00:06:40.130> just<00:06:41.130> goes<00:06:41.400> do<00:06:41.639> a<00:06:41.669> few<00:06:41.909> biomes<00:06:42.300> and
