00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.469 
if you're a sweaty hands type of player
and<00:02:02.100> you<00:02:02.579> don't<00:02:02.729> want<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:02.909> lose<00:02:03.000> grip<00:02:03.240> of<00:02:03.390> your

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
and you don't want to lose grip of your

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.510 
and you don't want to lose grip of your
controller<00:02:03.840> while<00:02:04.020> you're<00:02:04.110> playing<00:02:04.520> now

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
controller while you're playing now

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.350 
controller while you're playing now
going<00:02:05.790> up<00:02:05.880> here<00:02:05.969> to<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.210> top<00:02:06.710> the<00:02:07.710> r1<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.520> the

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
going up here to the top the r1 and the

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.830 
going up here to the top the r1 and the
l1<00:02:09.840> are<00:02:10.470> pretty<00:02:10.770> much<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.009> same<00:02:11.280> but<00:02:11.840> what

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
l1 are pretty much the same but what

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.820 
l1 are pretty much the same but what
changes<00:02:13.230> between

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
changes between

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.240 
changes between
this<00:02:14.520> controller<00:02:15.000> and<00:02:15.270> the<00:02:15.900> one<00:02:16.080> for<00:02:16.320> the<00:02:16.470> ps3

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
this controller and the one for the ps3

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.090 
this controller and the one for the ps3
the<00:02:18.000> original<00:02:18.390> ones<00:02:18.540> this<00:02:19.290> one<00:02:19.500> is<00:02:19.680> more<00:02:19.860> of<00:02:19.980> a

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
the original ones this one is more of a

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.120 
the original ones this one is more of a
concave<00:02:20.670> shape<00:02:21.110> when<00:02:22.110> this<00:02:22.200> one<00:02:22.380> is<00:02:22.410> convexed

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
concave shape when this one is convexed

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.420 
concave shape when this one is convexed
so<00:02:24.060> this<00:02:24.450> one<00:02:24.630> your<00:02:25.170> finger<00:02:25.620> fits<00:02:25.800> perfectly

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
so this one your finger fits perfectly

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:27.980 
so this one your finger fits perfectly
into<00:02:26.610> it<00:02:26.850> compared<00:02:27.300> to<00:02:27.450> this<00:02:27.600> one<00:02:27.660> over<00:02:27.960> here

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
into it compared to this one over here

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.650 
into it compared to this one over here
where<00:02:28.260> it<00:02:28.380> can<00:02:28.530> just<00:02:28.710> slide<00:02:28.920> off<00:02:28.950> and<00:02:29.510> this<00:02:30.510> is

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
where it can just slide off and this is

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.620 
where it can just slide off and this is
a<00:02:30.810> wannabe<00:02:31.260> trigger<00:02:31.560> it<00:02:32.340> has<00:02:32.640> the<00:02:32.880> spring<00:02:33.270> that

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
a wannabe trigger it has the spring that

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.470 
a wannabe trigger it has the spring that
has<00:02:33.840> inside<00:02:34.260> is<00:02:34.410> kind<00:02:35.070> of<00:02:35.160> soft<00:02:35.400> to<00:02:35.550> me<00:02:35.640> this

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
has inside is kind of soft to me this

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.680 
has inside is kind of soft to me this
one<00:02:36.690> is<00:02:36.810> really<00:02:36.990> hard<00:02:37.260> I<00:02:38.510> don't<00:02:39.510> know<00:02:39.570> if<00:02:39.630> you

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
one is really hard I don't know if you

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.830 
one is really hard I don't know if you
can<00:02:39.810> tell<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:39.990> difference<00:02:40.140> here<00:02:41.750> see<00:02:42.750> how

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
can tell the difference here see how

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.650 
can tell the difference here see how
long<00:02:43.080> it<00:02:43.200> takes<00:02:43.230> I<00:02:43.470> want<00:02:43.560> to<00:02:43.680> get<00:02:43.740> back<00:02:43.920> up<00:02:44.660> on

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
long it takes I want to get back up on

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.900 
long it takes I want to get back up on
this<00:02:45.870> one<00:02:48.170> so<00:02:49.170> these<00:02:49.800> triggers<00:02:50.280> are<00:02:50.490> really

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
this one so these triggers are really

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.060 
this one so these triggers are really
really<00:02:51.090> nice<00:02:51.300> but<00:02:52.170> the<00:02:52.380> main<00:02:52.560> feature<00:02:52.800> while

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
really nice but the main feature while

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.230 
really nice but the main feature while
people<00:02:53.400> are<00:02:53.430> going<00:02:53.610> to<00:02:53.700> want<00:02:53.790> to<00:02:53.880> be<00:02:54.000> buying

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
people are going to want to be buying

people are going to want to be buying
this<00:02:54.420> is<00:02:54.740> for<00:02:55.740> this<00:02:55.950> in<00:02:56.160> the<00:02:56.250> back<00:02:57.290> it<00:02:58.290> has<00:02:58.350> a

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
this is for this in the back it has a

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:02.449 
this is for this in the back it has a
what<00:03:00.209> do<00:03:00.270> they<00:03:00.390> call<00:03:00.600> it<00:03:00.630> on<00:03:00.840> this<00:03:01.220> see<00:03:02.220> here

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
what do they call it on this see here

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:08.240 
what do they call it on this see here
they<00:03:02.700> called<00:03:03.030> it<00:03:03.860> twin<00:03:04.860> combat<00:03:06.080> buttons<00:03:07.250> guess

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
they called it twin combat buttons guess

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.070 
they called it twin combat buttons guess
you<00:03:08.370> can't<00:03:08.550> read<00:03:08.670> that<00:03:08.700> twin<00:03:09.300> combat<00:03:09.720> buttons

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
you can't read that twin combat buttons

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.400 
you can't read that twin combat buttons
for<00:03:10.500> on-the-fly<00:03:10.950> custom<00:03:11.580> remapping<00:03:11.970> so<00:03:12.630> you

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
for on-the-fly custom remapping so you

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:14.960 
for on-the-fly custom remapping so you
can<00:03:13.560> remap<00:03:13.920> the<00:03:13.950> two<00:03:14.370> buttons<00:03:14.670> in<00:03:14.730> the<00:03:14.790> back

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
can remap the two buttons in the back

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.860 
can remap the two buttons in the back

lay<00:03:41.370> down<00:03:43.700> jump<00:03:44.700> or<00:03:45.019> the<00:03:46.019> stab<00:03:46.610> so<00:03:47.660> that's

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
lay down jump or the stab so that's

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.120 
lay down jump or the stab so that's
really<00:03:48.840> cool<00:03:49.110> for<00:03:49.230> these<00:03:49.380> are<00:03:49.650> for<00:03:50.010> these

really cool for these are for these
controllers<00:03:50.489> now<00:03:50.730> i<00:03:50.760> use<00:03:50.910> tactical<00:03:51.600> flipped

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
controllers now i use tactical flipped

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.199 
controllers now i use tactical flipped
