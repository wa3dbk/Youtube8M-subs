00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
pentium processor so to start off with

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:16.670 
pentium processor so to start off with
if<00:00:15.540> we<00:00:15.630> take<00:00:15.809> a<00:00:15.870> look<00:00:16.049> at<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.260> front<00:00:16.500> of<00:00:16.590> the

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
if we take a look at the front of the

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.310 
if we take a look at the front of the
box<00:00:16.920> as<00:00:17.190> you<00:00:17.279> can<00:00:17.310> see<00:00:17.720> Desktop<00:00:18.720> Intel<00:00:19.170> Pentium

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
box as you can see Desktop Intel Pentium

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.679 
box as you can see Desktop Intel Pentium
processor<00:00:19.619> on<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.910> bottom<00:00:21.150> right<00:00:21.330> hand<00:00:21.539> side

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
processor on the bottom right hand side

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.710 
processor on the bottom right hand side
you<00:00:22.289> get<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.800> CPU<00:00:23.760> model<00:00:24.090> which<00:00:24.240> is<00:00:24.420> of<00:00:24.600> course

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
you get the CPU model which is of course

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.970 
you get the CPU model which is of course
the<00:00:25.050> gfa<00:00:25.529> 220<00:00:26.220> and<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:27.359> socket<00:00:27.980> reference

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
the gfa 220 and the socket reference

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.150 
the gfa 220 and the socket reference
below<00:00:29.519> it<00:00:29.789> so<00:00:30.000> this<00:00:30.119> is<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.359> LGA<00:00:30.779> 1<00:00:31.109> 1<00:00:31.289> 5<00:00:31.560> 0<00:00:31.590> so

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
below it so this is the LGA 1 1 5 0 so

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.290 
below it so this is the LGA 1 1 5 0 so
this<00:00:32.309> is<00:00:32.430> your<00:00:32.579> motherboard<00:00:32.910> socket

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
this is your motherboard socket

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.170 
this is your motherboard socket
reference<00:00:33.870> this<00:00:34.860> of<00:00:35.040> course<00:00:35.250> is<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.700> free

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
reference this of course is the free

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.330 
reference this of course is the free
gigahertz<00:00:36.570> dual-core<00:00:37.230> model<00:00:37.800> so<00:00:38.010> if<00:00:38.100> we<00:00:38.219> look

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
gigahertz dual-core model so if we look

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.000 
gigahertz dual-core model so if we look
at<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.550> side<00:00:38.760> of<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:39.030> box<00:00:39.469> as<00:00:40.469> you<00:00:40.620> can<00:00:40.649> see<00:00:40.890> we

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
at the side of the box as you can see we

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.590 
at the side of the box as you can see we
get<00:00:41.129> to<00:00:41.309> cause<00:00:41.550> with<00:00:41.790> 2<00:00:41.940> threads<00:00:42.239> so<00:00:42.390> it's<00:00:42.510> only

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
get to cause with 2 threads so it's only

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.110 
get to cause with 2 threads so it's only
a<00:00:42.719> dual-core<00:00:43.140> processor<00:00:43.680> we<00:00:44.550> get<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.820> Intel

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
a dual-core processor we get the Intel

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.920 
a dual-core processor we get the Intel
HD<00:00:45.300> graphics<00:00:45.510> with<00:00:46.200> other<00:00:46.550> listed<00:00:47.930> Intel

the very top of the box that's where you

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.599 
the very top of the box that's where you
can<00:00:56.250> see<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.550> processor<00:00:57.120> itself<00:00:58.370> it's<00:00:59.370> a<00:00:59.460> bit

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
can see the processor itself it's a bit

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.729 
can see the processor itself it's a bit
clearer<00:00:59.910> now<00:01:00.090> out<00:01:00.300> of<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.480> sunlight<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:01.620> if

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
clearer now out of the sunlight and if

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.560 
clearer now out of the sunlight and if
we<00:01:01.859> look<00:01:01.980> on<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.129> back<00:01:02.219> you<00:01:02.640> just<00:01:02.879> get<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.090> brief

roll this out try not to make the same
mistake<00:02:05.189> I<00:02:05.219> made<00:02:05.460> last<00:02:05.490> time<00:02:05.850> this<00:02:06.509> is<00:02:06.689> your

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
mistake I made last time this is your

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.660 
mistake I made last time this is your
reference<00:02:08.149> Intel<00:02:09.149> cooling<00:02:09.929> fan<00:02:10.370> it<00:02:11.370> looks

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
reference Intel cooling fan it looks

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.640 
reference Intel cooling fan it looks
very<00:02:11.940> similar<00:02:12.360> to<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:12.690> ones<00:02:12.900> that<00:02:13.050> you<00:02:13.260> get

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
very similar to the ones that you get

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.430 
very similar to the ones that you get
on<00:02:13.709> the<00:02:14.010> top-end<00:02:14.459> models<00:02:14.879> such<00:02:15.120> as<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.440> 477

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
on the top-end models such as the 477

I<00:02:17.220> believe<00:02:17.790> they<00:02:18.000> sell<00:02:18.269> the<00:02:18.420> same<00:02:18.709> size<00:02:19.909> CPU

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:20.909 
I believe they sell the same size CPU

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:23.330 
I believe they sell the same size CPU
fan<00:02:21.319> so<00:02:22.319> that's<00:02:22.470> that<00:02:22.680> one<00:02:22.860> there<00:02:23.069> and<00:02:23.190> of

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
fan so that's that one there and of

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.589 
fan so that's that one there and of
course<00:02:23.370> as<00:02:23.670> you<00:02:23.760> can<00:02:23.849> see<00:02:24.000> pre-applied

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
course as you can see pre-applied

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:26.809 
course as you can see pre-applied
thermal<00:02:25.440> paste<00:02:25.620> at<00:02:25.860> the<00:02:25.950> bottom<00:02:26.280> so<00:02:26.519> your<00:02:26.700> are

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
thermal paste at the bottom so your are

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:28.250 
thermal paste at the bottom so your are
more<00:02:27.000> than<00:02:27.090> welcome<00:02:27.209> to<00:02:27.390> wipe<00:02:27.659> that<00:02:27.900> often<00:02:28.140> but

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
more than welcome to wipe that often but

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.110 
more than welcome to wipe that often but
your<00:02:28.409> own<00:02:28.530> brand<00:02:28.830> on<00:02:29.010> if<00:02:29.159> you've<00:02:29.700> already<00:02:29.879> got

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
your own brand on if you've already got

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.690 
your own brand on if you've already got
some<00:02:30.329> aftermarket<00:02:30.720> thermal<00:02:31.590> paste<00:02:31.769> so<00:02:32.670> that

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
some aftermarket thermal paste so that

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.860 
some aftermarket thermal paste so that
is<00:02:32.970> the<00:02:33.180> CPU<00:02:33.540> cooler<00:02:34.549> and<00:02:35.549> finally<00:02:36.209> hidden

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
is the CPU cooler and finally hidden

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.369 
is the CPU cooler and finally hidden
away<00:02:36.989> at<00:02:37.379> the<00:02:37.560> top<00:02:37.769> here<00:02:38.069> is<00:02:38.659> the<00:02:39.659> processor

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 
away at the top here is the processor

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:44.149 
away at the top here is the processor
itself<00:02:40.709> so<00:02:41.069> if<00:02:41.129> we<00:02:41.250> just<00:02:41.400> slide<00:02:41.670> this<00:02:41.819> out<00:02:43.159> does

00:02:44.149 --> 00:02:44.159 
itself so if we just slide this out does

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:45.319 
itself so if we just slide this out does
it<00:02:44.280> want<00:02:44.400> to<00:02:44.459> slide<00:02:44.670> out<00:02:44.849> there<00:02:45.030> must<00:02:45.209> be

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:45.329 
it want to slide out there must be

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:51.520 
it want to slide out there must be
another<00:02:45.690> way<00:02:45.870> to<00:02:45.930> get<00:02:46.079> this<00:02:46.200> up<00:02:46.319> then<00:02:46.500> come<00:02:46.709> on

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.080 

little<00:02:52.530> bit<00:02:52.620> of<00:02:52.680> trickery<00:02:52.920> nothing<00:02:53.760> cuz<00:02:53.910> in<00:02:54.030> a

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
little bit of trickery nothing cuz in a

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.619 
little bit of trickery nothing cuz in a
box<00:02:54.299> and<00:02:54.569> here<00:02:55.440> is<00:02:55.590> your<00:02:57.590> intel<00:02:58.590> pentium<00:02:58.769> g

00:02:59.619 --> 00:02:59.629 
box and here is your intel pentium g

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:02.869 
box and here is your intel pentium g
3220<00:03:00.629> so<00:03:01.349> again<00:03:01.590> this<00:03:01.859> processor<00:03:02.459> is<00:03:02.609> on<00:03:02.730> your

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:02.879 
3220 so again this processor is on your

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:05.680 
3220 so again this processor is on your
jaw<00:03:03.090> call<00:03:03.390> it<00:03:03.629> clocks<00:03:04.079> at<00:03:04.349> around<00:03:04.709> 3<00:03:05.280> gigahertz

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
jaw call it clocks at around 3 gigahertz

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.009 
jaw call it clocks at around 3 gigahertz
it<00:03:06.690> does<00:03:07.530> come<00:03:07.799> with<00:03:07.829> intel<00:03:08.489> HD<00:03:09.019> integrated

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
it does come with intel HD integrated

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:14.599 
it does come with intel HD integrated
graphics<00:03:11.390> but<00:03:12.390> this<00:03:12.659> is<00:03:12.900> the<00:03:13.440> Haswell<00:03:14.010> version

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:14.609 
graphics but this is the Haswell version

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:16.880 
graphics but this is the Haswell version
of<00:03:14.700> pentium<00:03:15.150> so<00:03:15.420> I<00:03:15.629> thoroughly<00:03:16.170> recommend<00:03:16.349> if
