00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
functional portal gun now this took a

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.139 
functional portal gun now this took a
while<00:00:40.010> because<00:00:41.010> I<00:00:41.280> had<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.520> like<00:00:41.670> learn<00:00:41.910> the

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
while because I had to like learn the

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.139 
while because I had to like learn the
code<00:00:42.390> and<00:00:42.600> stuff<00:00:42.840> but<00:00:43.500> I<00:00:43.860> finally<00:00:44.640> got<00:00:45.000> it

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
code and stuff but I finally got it

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.389 
code and stuff but I finally got it
working<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.989> only<00:00:46.500> thing<00:00:46.800> that<00:00:46.980> it<00:00:47.100> doesn't

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
working the only thing that it doesn't

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.400 
working the only thing that it doesn't
do<00:00:47.550> is<00:00:48.469> preserve<00:00:49.469> momentum<00:00:50.870> so<00:00:51.870> its<00:00:52.170> third

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
do is preserve momentum so its third

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.830 
do is preserve momentum so its third
person<00:00:52.920> because<00:00:53.399> i<00:00:53.430> felt<00:00:53.850> like<00:00:53.910> it<00:00:54.510> looks

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
person because i felt like it looks

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.099 
person because i felt like it looks
better<00:00:55.610> third<00:00:56.610> person<00:00:56.899> these<00:00:57.899> are<00:00:58.020> the

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
better third person these are the

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.700 
better third person these are the
portals<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:59.030> it<00:01:00.030> works<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:01.109> works<00:01:01.140> really

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
portals and it works it works really
