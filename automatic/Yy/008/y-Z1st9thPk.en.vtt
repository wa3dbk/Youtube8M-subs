all<00:00:02.790> the<00:00:02.939> signs<00:00:03.120> in<00:00:03.540> rapid<00:00:03.870> plan<00:00:04.110> are<00:00:04.500> actually

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
all the signs in rapid plan are actually

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.249 
all the signs in rapid plan are actually
created<00:00:05.400> using<00:00:05.670> rapid<00:00:06.000> plan<00:00:06.299> so<00:00:07.080> what<00:00:07.230> that

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
created using rapid plan so what that

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:08.810 
created using rapid plan so what that
means<00:00:07.560> is<00:00:07.710> you've<00:00:07.890> got<00:00:08.130> all<00:00:08.340> of<00:00:08.550> the<00:00:08.639> same

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
means is you've got all of the same

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.669 
means is you've got all of the same
capabilities<00:00:09.660> when<00:00:09.900> it<00:00:09.990> comes<00:00:10.170> to<00:00:10.349> creating

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
capabilities when it comes to creating

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.160 
capabilities when it comes to creating
signs<00:00:11.040> as<00:00:11.910> what<00:00:12.240> you<00:00:12.330> can<00:00:12.450> see<00:00:12.630> here<00:00:12.660> with<00:00:12.960> any

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
signs as what you can see here with any

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.680 
signs as what you can see here with any
of<00:00:13.290> the<00:00:13.380> existing<00:00:13.469> sites<00:00:14.299> if<00:00:15.299> you<00:00:15.420> ever<00:00:15.450> need

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
of the existing sites if you ever need

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.290 
of the existing sites if you ever need
to<00:00:15.780> create<00:00:16.020> your<00:00:16.320> own<00:00:16.440> custom<00:00:17.039> signs<00:00:17.300> usually

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
to create your own custom signs usually

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.510 
to create your own custom signs usually
the<00:00:18.630> easiest<00:00:18.660> way<00:00:19.199> to<00:00:19.260> do<00:00:19.529> so<00:00:19.770> is<00:00:20.010> to<00:00:20.100> start

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
the easiest way to do so is to start

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.029 
the easiest way to do so is to start
with<00:00:20.609> an<00:00:20.850> existing<00:00:21.090> side<00:00:21.529> so<00:00:22.529> just<00:00:22.830> as<00:00:22.920> an

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
with an existing side so just as an

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.730 
with an existing side so just as an
example<00:00:23.210> if<00:00:24.210> I<00:00:24.330> want<00:00:24.539> to<00:00:24.630> create<00:00:25.170> just<00:00:25.470> a<00:00:25.529> basic

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
example if I want to create just a basic

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.620 
example if I want to create just a basic
rectangular<00:00:26.519> sign<00:00:26.730> with<00:00:26.910> some<00:00:27.060> text<00:00:27.390> on<00:00:27.510> it

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
rectangular sign with some text on it

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.480 
rectangular sign with some text on it
similar<00:00:28.170> this<00:00:28.320> one<00:00:28.470> here<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.769> orange<00:00:29.070> one<00:00:29.279> I

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
similar this one here the orange one I

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.299 
similar this one here the orange one I
just<00:00:30.119> select<00:00:30.480> it<00:00:30.599> drop<00:00:31.349> that<00:00:31.470> on<00:00:31.619> my<00:00:31.740> plan<00:00:32.009> and

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
just select it drop that on my plan and

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:33.979 
just select it drop that on my plan and
then<00:00:33.120> there's<00:00:33.329> a<00:00:33.390> couple<00:00:33.630> of<00:00:33.719> different<00:00:33.960> ways

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
then there's a couple of different ways

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.750 
then there's a couple of different ways
you<00:00:34.110> can<00:00:34.290> edit<00:00:34.590> it<00:00:34.829> so<00:00:34.950> I'll<00:00:35.190> do<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.340> couple<00:00:35.700> of

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
you can edit it so I'll do a couple of

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.810 
you can edit it so I'll do a couple of
copies<00:00:35.940> just<00:00:36.270> to<00:00:36.329> show<00:00:36.950> if<00:00:37.950> I<00:00:38.219> double<00:00:38.550> click<00:00:38.579> on

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
copies just to show if I double click on

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.540 
copies just to show if I double click on
a<00:00:38.879> sign<00:00:39.149> it<00:00:39.690> brings<00:00:40.020> up<00:00:40.200> this<00:00:40.590> properties<00:00:41.340> box

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
a sign it brings up this properties box

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.880 
a sign it brings up this properties box
from<00:00:42.540> which<00:00:42.750> I<00:00:42.930> can<00:00:42.989> access<00:00:43.559> saw<00:00:43.829> the

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
from which I can access saw the

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.040 
from which I can access saw the
components<00:00:44.640> that<00:00:44.670> make<00:00:44.879> up<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.180> sign<00:00:45.390> so<00:00:45.780> just

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
components that make up to sign so just

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.260 
components that make up to sign so just
I<00:00:46.260> can<00:00:46.530> see<00:00:46.680> I<00:00:46.710> can<00:00:46.770> edit<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.370> rectangular<00:00:48.059> and

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
I can see I can edit the rectangular and

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.049 
I can see I can edit the rectangular and
out<00:00:48.390> of<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.570> text<00:00:48.960> and<00:00:49.140> then<00:00:50.039> any<00:00:50.399> changes

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
out of the text and then any changes

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.389 
out of the text and then any changes
that<00:00:51.210> I<00:00:51.239> make<00:00:51.539> in<00:00:51.719> here<00:00:52.140> I<00:00:52.320> just<00:00:52.949> change<00:00:53.250> the

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
that I make in here I just change the

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.630 
that I make in here I just change the
color<00:00:53.610> for<00:00:53.789> example<00:00:54.530> will<00:00:55.530> apply<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.340> sign

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
color for example will apply to the sign

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.180 
color for example will apply to the sign
without<00:00:56.969> me<00:00:57.629> sort<00:00:58.020> of<00:00:58.079> editing<00:00:58.410> or<00:00:58.590> ungrouping

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
without me sort of editing or ungrouping

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.510 
without me sort of editing or ungrouping
it<00:00:59.840> so<00:01:00.840> if<00:01:01.050> I<00:01:01.230> want<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.590> change<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:02.010> text<00:01:02.340> one

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
it so if I want to change the text one

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.920 
it so if I want to change the text one
way<00:01:02.640> that<00:01:02.820> I<00:01:02.850> could<00:01:03.030> do<00:01:03.180> it<00:01:03.270> is<00:01:03.359> just<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.629> go<00:01:03.870> to

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
way that I could do it is just to go to

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.310 
way that I could do it is just to go to
the<00:01:04.640> text<00:01:05.640> object<00:01:06.030> in<00:01:06.150> this<00:01:06.360> tree<00:01:06.840> here<00:01:07.110> and

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
the text object in this tree here and

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.429 
the text object in this tree here and
just<00:01:08.220> change<00:01:08.490> it<00:01:08.640> over<00:01:09.049> not<00:01:10.049> that<00:01:10.170> that's<00:01:10.290> a

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
just change it over not that that's a

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:11.630 
just change it over not that that's a
real<00:01:10.590> song<00:01:10.799> just<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.159> show<00:01:11.369> you<00:01:11.400> how<00:01:11.490> it<00:01:11.610> works

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
real song just to show you how it works

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.330 
real song just to show you how it works
and<00:01:12.030> then<00:01:12.930> hit<00:01:13.049> OK<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.409> you<00:01:13.590> can<00:01:13.710> see<00:01:13.920> it<00:01:14.040> it'll

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
and then hit OK and you can see it it'll

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.999 
and then hit OK and you can see it it'll
edit<00:01:15.180> it<00:01:15.350> another<00:01:16.350> way<00:01:16.530> that<00:01:16.710> you<00:01:16.740> can<00:01:16.799> edit

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
edit it another way that you can edit

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.230 
edit it another way that you can edit
assign<00:01:17.400> is<00:01:17.670> if<00:01:17.850> I<00:01:18.030> right<00:01:18.390> click<00:01:18.420> on<00:01:18.750> it<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:18.930> go

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
assign is if I right click on it and go

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.480 
assign is if I right click on it and go
to<00:01:21.240> this<00:01:21.330> ungroup<00:01:21.960> option<00:01:22.350> what<00:01:23.100> that<00:01:23.280> does<00:01:23.460> is

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
to this ungroup option what that does is

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.060 
to this ungroup option what that does is
it<00:01:23.640> breaks<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.240> sign<00:01:24.600> apart<00:01:24.990> into<00:01:25.259> its<00:01:25.560> sort

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
it breaks the sign apart into its sort

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.640 
it breaks the sign apart into its sort
of<00:01:26.159> components<00:01:26.780> so<00:01:27.780> then<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.049> text<00:01:28.409> i<00:01:28.470> could

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
of components so then the text i could

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.200 
of components so then the text i could
just<00:01:28.740> double<00:01:28.979> click<00:01:29.250> on<00:01:29.369> that<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:29.700> quick<00:01:29.939> edit

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
just double click on that to quick edit

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.149 
just double click on that to quick edit
it<00:01:30.890> make<00:01:31.890> a<00:01:31.920> change<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:33.650> then<00:01:34.650> just<00:01:34.890> put<00:01:35.130> that

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
it make a change and then just put that

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.340 
it make a change and then just put that
back<00:01:35.490> together<00:01:35.820> again<00:01:36.060> so<00:01:36.689> just<00:01:36.930> move<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:37.290> over

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
back together again so just move it over

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.330 
back together again so just move it over
the<00:01:37.560> top<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:38.299> then<00:01:39.299> select<00:01:40.020> it<00:01:40.170> all<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:40.530> then

the top and then select it all and then
right-click<00:01:41.729> and<00:01:42.240> select<00:01:42.630> group<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.439> it'll

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
right-click and select group and it'll

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.039 
right-click and select group and it'll
just<00:01:44.070> turn<00:01:44.220> it<00:01:44.430> back<00:01:44.549> into<00:01:44.759> a<00:01:44.970> single<00:01:45.930> object

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
just turn it back into a single object

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.429 
just turn it back into a single object
and<00:01:46.610> if<00:01:47.610> you<00:01:47.820> need<00:01:48.000> to<00:01:48.180> be<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.630> little<00:01:48.689> more<00:01:49.020> like

and if you need to be a little more like
if<00:01:49.560> you've<00:01:49.680> got<00:01:49.860> some<00:01:50.009> signs<00:01:50.250> that<00:01:50.369> you're

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
if you've got some signs that you're

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.740 
if you've got some signs that you're
going<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.700> be<00:01:50.759> using<00:01:50.850> frequently<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:51.630> you

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
going to be using frequently and you

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.060 
going to be using frequently and you
want<00:01:51.930> to<00:01:52.049> sort<00:01:52.380> of<00:01:52.439> have<00:01:52.619> all<00:01:52.770> of<00:01:52.950> the

want to sort of have all of the
capabilities<00:01:53.759> for<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.030> sign<00:01:54.240> if<00:01:55.229> you<00:01:55.320> click

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
capabilities for the sign if you click

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.590 
capabilities for the sign if you click
on<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.799> View<00:01:56.070> menu<00:01:56.100> here<00:01:56.700> you<00:01:57.180> can<00:01:57.360> enable

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
on the View menu here you can enable

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.200 
on the View menu here you can enable
this<00:01:57.899> sign<00:01:58.200> editor<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:58.920> it<00:01:59.759> just<00:01:59.909> gives<00:02:00.030> you<00:02:00.180> a

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
this sign editor and it just gives you a

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.600 
this sign editor and it just gives you a
little<00:02:00.390> more<00:02:00.479> control<00:02:00.930> over<00:02:01.049> things<00:02:01.979> like<00:02:02.189> the

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
little more control over things like the

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.630 
little more control over things like the
black<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:03.750> white<00:02:03.930> variations<00:02:04.710> or<00:02:05.040> any<00:02:05.310> sign

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
black and white variations or any sign

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.469 
black and white variations or any sign
codes<00:02:06.060> or<00:02:06.360> sign<00:02:06.540> sizes<00:02:07.079> that<00:02:07.229> you<00:02:07.320> want<00:02:07.500> to<00:02:07.590> add

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
codes or sign sizes that you want to add

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.330 
codes or sign sizes that you want to add
so<00:02:09.479> just<00:02:09.780> as<00:02:09.869> an<00:02:09.989> example<00:02:10.110> just<00:02:10.709> to<00:02:10.950> create<00:02:11.310> a

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
so just as an example just to create a

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.900 
so just as an example just to create a
sort<00:02:11.550> of<00:02:11.610> a<00:02:11.700> sign<00:02:11.910> from<00:02:12.150> from

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
sort of a sign from from

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.270 
sort of a sign from from
match<00:02:13.050> you<00:02:14.050> can<00:02:14.230> use<00:02:14.380> these<00:02:14.560> primitive<00:02:15.040> tools

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
match you can use these primitive tools

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.040 
match you can use these primitive tools
over<00:02:15.640> here<00:02:15.670> just<00:02:15.970> the<00:02:16.060> basic<00:02:16.390> rectangles<00:02:16.960> and

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
over here just the basic rectangles and

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.040 
over here just the basic rectangles and
so<00:02:17.260> on<00:02:17.410> to<00:02:17.560> create<00:02:17.800> simple<00:02:18.790> signs<00:02:19.000> so<00:02:19.480> if<00:02:19.930> I

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
so on to create simple signs so if I

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.880 
so on to create simple signs so if I
just<00:02:20.080> start<00:02:20.500> with<00:02:20.710> a<00:02:20.740> rounded<00:02:21.580> rectangle<00:02:22.180> and

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
just start with a rounded rectangle and

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.200 
just start with a rounded rectangle and
then<00:02:23.890> i<00:02:23.920> can<00:02:24.130> edit<00:02:24.310> that<00:02:24.460> so<00:02:24.790> that<00:02:25.060> i<00:02:25.090> can

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
then i can edit that so that i can

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.440 
then i can edit that so that i can
change<00:02:25.630> the<00:02:25.990> properties<00:02:26.230> to<00:02:27.030> whatever<00:02:28.030> I<00:02:28.120> need

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
change the properties to whatever I need

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.070 
change the properties to whatever I need
let's<00:02:29.200> say<00:02:29.380> I<00:02:29.440> want<00:02:29.650> to<00:02:29.710> make<00:02:29.830> it<00:02:29.950> a<00:02:30.040> red<00:02:30.370> sign

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
let's say I want to make it a red sign

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.720 
let's say I want to make it a red sign
not<00:02:32.080> going<00:02:32.230> to<00:02:32.290> make<00:02:32.380> a<00:02:32.410> real<00:02:33.010> sign<00:02:33.340> here<00:02:33.580> but

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
not going to make a real sign here but

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.070 
not going to make a real sign here but
just<00:02:33.910> to<00:02:33.970> show<00:02:34.030> you<00:02:34.210> how<00:02:34.330> it<00:02:34.480> all<00:02:34.570> works<00:02:34.780> and

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
just to show you how it all works and

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.530 
just to show you how it all works and
then<00:02:36.010> if<00:02:36.100> I<00:02:36.190> want<00:02:36.220> to<00:02:36.430> put<00:02:36.580> some<00:02:36.760> text<00:02:37.090> on<00:02:37.330> that

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
then if I want to put some text on that

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.600 
then if I want to put some text on that
I<00:02:37.720> just<00:02:37.990> go<00:02:38.140> back<00:02:38.350> to<00:02:38.380> my<00:02:38.620> primitive<00:02:38.920> objects

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
I just go back to my primitive objects

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.200 
I just go back to my primitive objects
grab<00:02:40.390> the<00:02:40.540> text<00:02:40.840> object<00:02:41.260> and<00:02:42.130> i'm<00:02:42.880> just<00:02:43.060> going

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.210 
grab the text object and i'm just going

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:51.060 
grab the text object and i'm just going
to<00:02:43.240> write<00:02:43.300> my<00:02:43.860> text<00:02:44.860> on<00:02:44.980> here<00:02:48.330> and<00:02:49.860> then<00:02:50.860> just

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
to write my text on here and then just

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.770 
to write my text on here and then just
change<00:02:51.280> my<00:02:51.430> sizes<00:02:52.000> so<00:02:52.150> that<00:02:52.180> i<00:02:52.360> have<00:02:52.390> it<00:02:52.630> how<00:02:52.720> I

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
change my sizes so that i have it how I

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.980 
change my sizes so that i have it how I
need<00:02:52.930> it<00:02:53.140> and<00:02:54.120> again<00:02:55.120> all<00:02:55.330> these<00:02:55.510> properties

need it and again all these properties

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:57.570 
need it and again all these properties

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
here into the sign editor to so that I

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.050 
here into the sign editor to so that I
can<00:03:33.900> configure<00:03:34.900> all<00:03:35.110> the<00:03:35.320> options<00:03:35.470> and<00:03:36.060> one

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
can configure all the options and one

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.580 
can configure all the options and one
thing<00:03:37.270> it<00:03:37.390> will<00:03:37.450> do<00:03:37.600> is<00:03:37.630> when<00:03:37.900> you<00:03:38.020> import<00:03:38.410> a

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
thing it will do is when you import a

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.670 
thing it will do is when you import a
very<00:03:38.800> assign<00:03:39.420> it<00:03:40.420> imports<00:03:41.110> just<00:03:41.350> the<00:03:41.440> color

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
very assign it imports just the color

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.380 
very assign it imports just the color
variation<00:03:42.310> or<00:03:42.400> whichever<00:03:42.640> variation<00:03:42.910> you

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
variation or whichever variation you

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.420 
variation or whichever variation you
select<00:03:43.780> and<00:03:43.989> then<00:03:44.020> it'll<00:03:44.709> take<00:03:44.950> a<00:03:44.980> best<00:03:45.310> guess

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
select and then it'll take a best guess

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.360 
select and then it'll take a best guess
at<00:03:45.910> a<00:03:45.989> at<00:03:46.989> the<00:03:47.230> facts<00:03:47.470> mode<00:03:47.709> which<00:03:47.950> is<00:03:48.130> the

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
at a at the facts mode which is the

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.760 
at a at the facts mode which is the
black<00:03:48.550> and<00:03:48.700> white<00:03:48.850> version<00:03:49.410> but<00:03:50.410> because<00:03:50.739> i

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:50.770 
black and white version but because i

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:52.410 
black and white version but because i
had<00:03:50.950> read<00:03:51.160> here<00:03:51.459> it's<00:03:51.580> just<00:03:51.640> converted<00:03:52.209> it<00:03:52.300> to

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
had read here it's just converted it to

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.960 
had read here it's just converted it to
grayscale<00:03:53.020> which<00:03:53.410> i<00:03:53.560> actually<00:03:53.709> want<00:03:54.160> it<00:03:54.550> to<00:03:54.790> be

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
grayscale which i actually want it to be

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.300 
grayscale which i actually want it to be
just<00:03:55.330> a<00:03:55.720> white<00:03:55.959> background<00:03:56.170> with<00:03:56.560> black<00:03:56.800> text

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
just a white background with black text

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.729 
just a white background with black text
so<00:03:58.239> if<00:03:58.360> i<00:03:58.480> click<00:03:58.540> on<00:03:58.870> the<00:03:58.989> edit<00:03:59.230> button<00:03:59.380> there

00:03:59.729 --> 00:03:59.739 
so if i click on the edit button there

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:02.490 
so if i click on the edit button there
it'll<00:04:00.580> bring<00:04:00.880> up<00:04:01.060> this<00:04:01.300> the<00:04:02.050> properties

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
it'll bring up this the properties

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.760 
it'll bring up this the properties
window<00:04:03.450> so<00:04:04.450> i<00:04:04.480> can<00:04:04.720> change<00:04:04.900> the<00:04:05.170> fill<00:04:05.410> i'm

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:05.770 
window so i can change the fill i'm

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.100 
window so i can change the fill i'm
going<00:04:05.920> to<00:04:05.980> make<00:04:06.130> that<00:04:06.310> two<00:04:06.520> white<00:04:06.790> and<00:04:07.110> the

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
going to make that two white and the

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:09.810 
going to make that two white and the
text<00:04:08.560> is<00:04:08.800> going<00:04:09.100> to<00:04:09.160> need<00:04:09.280> to<00:04:09.430> be<00:04:09.520> black

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:09.820 
text is going to need to be black

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.540 
text is going to need to be black
because<00:04:10.030> otherwise<00:04:10.330> I<00:04:10.510> can't<00:04:10.750> see<00:04:10.959> it<00:04:11.110> so<00:04:11.550> you

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:12.550 
because otherwise I can't see it so you

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:14.460 
because otherwise I can't see it so you
change<00:04:12.790> it<00:04:12.940> over<00:04:12.970> to<00:04:13.209> black<00:04:13.450> and<00:04:13.690> then<00:04:13.840> hit<00:04:14.020> ok

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
change it over to black and then hit ok

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.440 
change it over to black and then hit ok
so<00:04:15.459> then<00:04:15.580> you<00:04:15.670> can<00:04:15.790> see<00:04:15.940> it's<00:04:16.090> a<00:04:16.150> little<00:04:16.359> more

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450 
so then you can see it's a little more

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:20.010 
so then you can see it's a little more
appropriate<00:04:17.080> for<00:04:17.109> a<00:04:18.100> fax<00:04:18.880> mode<00:04:19.120> just<00:04:19.299> a<00:04:19.450> white

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:20.020 
appropriate for a fax mode just a white

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:22.130 
appropriate for a fax mode just a white
on<00:04:20.200> black<00:04:20.520> can<00:04:21.520> give<00:04:21.669> it<00:04:21.789> a<00:04:21.880> description

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
on black can give it a description

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.860 
on black can give it a description
anything<00:04:23.140> you<00:04:23.229> want

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.689 

and<00:04:25.960> if<00:04:26.080> you<00:04:26.199> need<00:04:26.380> to<00:04:26.590> add<00:04:26.740> sign<00:04:27.100> codes<00:04:27.460> or

00:04:27.689 --> 00:04:27.699 
and if you need to add sign codes or

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:29.700 
and if you need to add sign codes or
sign<00:04:27.910> designations<00:04:28.690> you<00:04:28.990> can<00:04:29.169> just<00:04:29.350> add<00:04:29.530> those

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
sign designations you can just add those

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.760 
sign designations you can just add those
in<00:04:29.979> here<00:04:30.310> and<00:04:30.870> then<00:04:31.870> the<00:04:31.960> same<00:04:32.169> goes<00:04:32.380> for<00:04:32.590> sign

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
in here and then the same goes for sign

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.620 
in here and then the same goes for sign
sizes<00:04:33.280> if<00:04:33.400> you<00:04:33.490> need<00:04:33.610> to<00:04:33.699> display<00:04:34.030> your<00:04:34.090> sizes

signs using the Sign editor you can also
open<00:04:56.919> those<00:04:57.570> but<00:04:58.570> so<00:04:58.720> what<00:04:58.870> I'm<00:04:58.960> going<00:04:59.050> to<00:04:59.110> do

00:04:59.189 --> 00:04:59.199 
open those but so what I'm going to do

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:00.480 
open those but so what I'm going to do
for<00:04:59.380> this<00:04:59.470> one<00:04:59.680> is<00:04:59.800> I'm<00:04:59.919> just<00:05:00.039> going<00:05:00.130> to<00:05:00.250> save

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
for this one is I'm just going to save

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.529 
for this one is I'm just going to save
it<00:05:00.600> just<00:05:01.600> anywhere<00:05:01.960> so<00:05:02.380> I<00:05:02.410> can<00:05:02.620> save<00:05:02.830> it<00:05:02.860> into<00:05:03.070> a

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:03.539 
it just anywhere so I can save it into a

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:06.620 
it just anywhere so I can save it into a
sign<00:05:04.539> folder<00:05:05.020> here<00:05:05.169> so<00:05:05.440> i<00:05:05.470> just<00:05:05.500> call<00:05:05.830> it<00:05:05.979> test

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.630 
sign folder here so i just call it test

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:10.080 
sign folder here so i just call it test
save<00:05:07.630> and<00:05:08.050> then<00:05:08.680> that<00:05:08.889> way<00:05:09.070> i<00:05:09.669> can<00:05:09.760> either

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
save and then that way i can either

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.310 
save and then that way i can either
import<00:05:10.630> it<00:05:10.810> using<00:05:11.110> this<00:05:11.199> import<00:05:11.710> sign<00:05:11.979> file<00:05:13.320> so

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.320 
import it using this import sign file so

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.080 
import it using this import sign file so
i<00:05:14.350> signed<00:05:14.680> tools<00:05:15.010> and<00:05:15.280> then<00:05:15.400> import<00:05:15.820> load<00:05:16.060> a

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090 
i signed tools and then import load a
