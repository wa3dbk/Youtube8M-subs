00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.080
 face to be taken by the video and 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.550
 you can see the other one that we recorded from 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.750
 attack we bring you today 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.430
 call if I were a book 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.289
 and what it's about is a few 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.330
 questions that if your life were a 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.920
 book how did you want that genre 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.040
 or if all that right now they will see how 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:38.370
 we do and we're going to start asking 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.590
 number one in what format would be a 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.010
 novel a collection of short stories 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.289
 or poems or a graphic novel that is 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.399
 like a comic book I am or not true because 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.399
 I do not read 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.070
 I would also be a novel 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:01:00.410
 and already generated serious 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.410
 and I would be terror because I like it 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.460
 and eat less 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:15.590
 fantasy because fantasy 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:18.270
 so much of the book of your life would be fiction 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.310
 nothing because I am the killer in life 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.990
 real 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:27.230
 if the video does not reach the raiza channel 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.230
 and he sees it in the police or something I did not go 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.210
 because as a book of my life I would like 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.650
 outside fantasy and in the world that I do not 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.340
 there is fantasy because I think I will have to 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.540
 add some fiction to be able to 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.160
 belongs to this genre but as in 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.080
 general my character and that would want 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.479
 was stuck to it I would not want to add anything 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.210
 the mass of the world around like what 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.430
 things so for example that is 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.570
 they had magic that would not 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:57.000
 you're saying that magic does not exist in 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:59.159
 your book would be a short moment or a 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.259
 long period of your life a period 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.619
 short because I do not intend to kill by 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:07.860
 life I want to get a job with the 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:10.140
 that I think they were created long 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.270
 my life or that there were several books 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.940
 that it was like everything was happening 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.620
 so what is happening to me during a 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.000
 long period 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.190
 me since a long period to Emilio 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.560
 opened a villain in your book and who 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.970
 would that it should not be named as 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.100
 I believe that I will be the villain so 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.750
 I do not know if I could have trujillo could not 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.790
 being an invented has to be someone 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.470
 in real life be my archrival 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.850
 supreme 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.850
 I already remembered the world 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:39.610
 some of the times I have 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:41.890
 nightmares dream of a character that 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:45.930
 called the thousand eyes I do not know why they do not have 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:48.939
 a thousand eyes but if they want to kill me 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.530
 would be my character or I do not like it 

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:52.090
 that in my books there was a villain and 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.040
 not necessarily the problem was a 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.900
 situation but it would have been like a 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.120
 evil in headquarters I think that I like that and 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.810
 it is added as something that I like 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.810
 see in the books 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:06.689
 then it says in what world you would live and that 

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:08.370
 it can be a world that already exists in 

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:10.230
 some book or it can be a world that you 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.209
 have you invented or can the world be 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.950
 real ok I think I would invent my 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.450
 own world where I was the only one 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.900
 killer to have more people than 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.900
 murdered 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.750
 I invite you 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:26.780
 no thanks me that I like to live in the 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:29.030
 current world but add to the world well 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.770
 that there is fantasy, that is, as 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.720
 example of books that are from 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:34.250
 urban fantasy that is in the city ​​and 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.890
 that's not necessarily in the magical world 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.720
 but that there have mixed things like that 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.720
 of fantasy and all that is I would like 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.440
 much 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.440
 I had heard 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:52.840
 what time would I live in the past in the 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.840
 present or in the future in the present 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.640
 yes I also think that they live in the 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.800
 present as well as I tell you of the world of 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.560
 right now but with all the extras how it would be 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:04.170
 your book or would be linear would be 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.460
 economically in reverse or like this 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.920
 settled the time I would 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:10.740
 chronologically upside down or city of 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:13.800
 end at the beginning so they could see how 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:15.270
 I would become but a monster and what 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.920
 They know the real reasons why 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:17.970
 Theme I think I would like that 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.549
 out linear 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.650
 I would like it to be like that in 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:24.810
 order of webs which would be the main 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.520
 turn in the plot would be at the end of the 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:30.090
 book when they discover why it does 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:33.930
 people but I do not tell you what the 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:36.570
 principal and what I normally do and then 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:40.060
 there is the world of fountain sky I put I do not 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:41.800
 it was so normal I had something secret hidden 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.780
 and this is a all questions what 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.810
 it's still there there are people and the stems 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.980

 believe but always good is not called
