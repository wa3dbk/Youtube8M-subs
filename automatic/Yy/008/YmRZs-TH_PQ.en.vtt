00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
got 50 seconds of walking time to split

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.420 
got 50 seconds of walking time to split
in<00:01:36.630> so<00:01:36.930> I<00:01:36.960> just<00:01:37.229> you<00:01:37.500> know<00:01:37.530> use<00:01:37.920> those<00:01:38.130> 50

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
in so I just you know use those 50

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.039 
in so I just you know use those 50
seconds<00:01:38.729> wisely<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.180> pre-split<00:01:39.600> so<00:01:39.810> that<00:01:39.960> my

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
seconds wisely and pre-split so that my

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.630 
seconds wisely and pre-split so that my
guys<00:01:40.229> walk<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.710> just<00:01:40.799> instantly<00:01:41.340> spread

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
guys walk and just instantly spread

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.429 
guys walk and just instantly spread
across<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:42.060> map<00:01:42.240> but<00:01:42.840> it's<00:01:43.020> terrible<00:01:43.320> if

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
across the map but it's terrible if

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:44.899 
across the map but it's terrible if
you're<00:01:43.530> already<00:01:43.680> there<00:01:43.920> because<00:01:44.220> it<00:01:44.460> takes<00:01:44.610> 15

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
you're already there because it takes 15

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.760 
you're already there because it takes 15
or<00:01:45.299> 20<00:01:45.570> seconds

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
or 20 seconds

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.270 
or 20 seconds
uh<00:01:47.359> next<00:01:48.359> one<00:01:48.479> is<00:01:48.770> polka<00:01:49.770> dots<00:01:49.979> you<00:01:50.130> move

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
uh next one is polka dots you move

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.440 
uh next one is polka dots you move
everyone<00:01:50.549> over<00:01:50.789> there<00:01:50.909> and<00:01:51.090> then<00:01:51.179> you<00:01:51.270> take

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
everyone over there and then you take

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.679 
everyone over there and then you take
little<00:01:51.719> groups<00:01:51.960> and<00:01:52.109> you<00:01:52.229> move<00:01:52.380> them<00:01:52.500> around

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:53.689 
little groups and you move them around

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:56.240 
little groups and you move them around
split<00:01:54.689> them<00:01:54.780> into<00:01:54.899> little<00:01:55.049> polka<00:01:55.380> dots<00:01:55.619> hey

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
split them into little polka dots hey

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:02.220 
split them into little polka dots hey
guys<00:01:56.520> let's<00:01:56.789> beat<00:01:56.969> polka<00:01:57.179> dots<00:01:59.270> oops

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:02.230 
guys let's beat polka dots oops

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:04.860 
guys let's beat polka dots oops
again<00:02:02.980> this<00:02:03.160> takes<00:02:03.340> about<00:02:03.550> 12<00:02:04.210> seconds<00:02:04.660> so

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:04.870 
again this takes about 12 seconds so

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.500 
again this takes about 12 seconds so
it's<00:02:05.050> not<00:02:05.470> crazy<00:02:05.830> good<00:02:06.160> and<00:02:06.520> until<00:02:07.120> it's<00:02:07.270> done

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:07.510 
it's not crazy good and until it's done

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.880 
it's not crazy good and until it's done
your<00:02:07.750> guys<00:02:07.870> are<00:02:08.080> really<00:02:08.290> tightly<00:02:08.620> packed<00:02:10.890> so

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
that's polka dots 12 15 seconds this is

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.590 
that's polka dots 12 15 seconds this is
what<00:02:15.010> I<00:02:15.040> call<00:02:15.400> patrol<00:02:16.120> splitting<00:02:16.480> you're

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
what I call patrol splitting you're

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.530 
what I call patrol splitting you're
going<00:02:16.720> to<00:02:16.780> want<00:02:16.930> to<00:02:16.990> rebind<00:02:17.500> patrol<00:02:18.160> to<00:02:19.030> a<00:02:19.060> key

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
going to want to rebind patrol to a key

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.450 
going to want to rebind patrol to a key
that<00:02:19.690> you<00:02:19.720> can<00:02:19.900> actually<00:02:20.020> reach<00:02:20.380> like<00:02:20.590> qrw<00:02:21.010> and

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:21.460 
that you can actually reach like qrw and

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.730 
that you can actually reach like qrw and
then<00:02:22.240> what<00:02:22.660> you<00:02:22.690> want<00:02:22.930> to<00:02:22.960> do<00:02:23.110> is<00:02:23.410> when<00:02:23.650> you

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
then what you want to do is when you

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.410 
then what you want to do is when you
patrol<00:02:24.070> things<00:02:24.340> it<00:02:24.550> makes<00:02:24.670> a<00:02:24.820> blue<00:02:25.030> line<00:02:25.240> you

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
patrol things it makes a blue line you

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.590 
patrol things it makes a blue line you
see<00:02:25.570> that<00:02:25.690> blue<00:02:25.840> line<00:02:26.020> you<00:02:26.740> want<00:02:27.130> to<00:02:27.190> imagine

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
see that blue line you want to imagine

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.300 
see that blue line you want to imagine
how<00:02:28.600> many<00:02:28.780> spokes<00:02:29.080> you<00:02:29.290> can<00:02:29.470> fit<00:02:29.710> in<00:02:29.860> this<00:02:29.980> area

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
how many spokes you can fit in this area

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.040 
how many spokes you can fit in this area
and<00:02:30.520> then<00:02:30.640> make<00:02:30.850> blue<00:02:31.150> lines<00:02:31.360> for<00:02:31.690> each<00:02:31.720> of<00:02:31.960> the

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
and then make blue lines for each of the

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.110 
and then make blue lines for each of the
spokes<00:02:32.350> so<00:02:32.650> everyone<00:02:33.070> stand<00:02:33.520> here<00:02:33.790> and<00:02:34.000> then

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
spokes so everyone stand here and then

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.730 
spokes so everyone stand here and then
we're<00:02:34.240> gonna<00:02:34.330> say<00:02:34.630> i<00:02:34.660> want<00:02:34.990> to<00:02:35.050> spoke<00:02:35.350> here

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
we're gonna say i want to spoke here

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.100 
we're gonna say i want to spoke here
spoke<00:02:36.130> here<00:02:36.520> spoke<00:02:36.910> here<00:02:37.210> spoke<00:02:37.600> here<00:02:37.810> so<00:02:37.990> that

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
spoke here spoke here spoke here so that

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.660 
spoke here spoke here spoke here so that
only<00:02:38.230> takes<00:02:38.410> three<00:02:38.740> seconds<00:02:39.130> and<00:02:39.310> suddenly

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
only takes three seconds and suddenly

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.160 
only takes three seconds and suddenly
your<00:02:39.820> whole<00:02:39.940> army<00:02:40.270> is<00:02:40.360> split<00:02:40.660> so<00:02:40.810> that's<00:02:40.960> by

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
your whole army is split so that's by

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:42.990 
your whole army is split so that's by
far<00:02:41.200> the<00:02:41.650> best<00:02:41.860> out<00:02:42.040> of<00:02:42.070> combat<00:02:42.340> way<00:02:42.640> to<00:02:42.700> split

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
far the best out of combat way to split

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.840 
far the best out of combat way to split
things<00:02:43.740> very<00:02:44.740> nice<00:02:44.950> and<00:02:45.340> if<00:02:45.490> you<00:02:45.610> look<00:02:45.760> at

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
everyone I've just got four spokes you

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:48.960 
everyone I've just got four spokes you
can<00:02:47.560> if<00:02:47.800> you<00:02:47.920> have<00:02:48.070> more<00:02:48.280> time<00:02:48.520> like<00:02:48.760> if<00:02:48.910> you

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
can if you have more time like if you

know you've got forever then you can
make<00:02:50.380> like<00:02:50.620> 200<00:02:50.890> million<00:02:51.370> spokes<00:02:51.820> so<00:02:52.510> we're

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
make like 200 million spokes so we're

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.240 
make like 200 million spokes so we're
going<00:02:52.750> to<00:02:52.840> start<00:02:53.110> up<00:02:53.320> here<00:02:53.350> on<00:02:53.620> this<00:02:53.710> clock<00:02:54.040> it

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
going to start up here on this clock it

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.950 
going to start up here on this clock it
says<00:02:54.490> six<00:02:55.090> seconds<00:02:55.540> so<00:02:55.630> we're<00:02:55.720> going<00:02:55.810> to<00:02:55.900> go

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
now we've got all these different spokes

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.340 
now we've got all these different spokes
ooh<00:03:03.910> we<00:03:04.060> can<00:03:04.180> even<00:03:04.330> afford<00:03:04.810> a<00:03:04.960> spoke<00:03:05.200> right

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
ooh we can even afford a spoke right

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.199 
ooh we can even afford a spoke right
there<00:03:05.620> and<00:03:06.310> we<00:03:06.370> can<00:03:06.490> even<00:03:06.610> afford<00:03:06.880> a<00:03:07.000> smoke

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.810 
it's kind of there's a little bit of
randomness<00:03:16.270> to<00:03:16.570> it<00:03:16.750> it's<00:03:17.739> I'd<00:03:18.160> say<00:03:18.520> it's<00:03:18.670> by

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
randomness to it it's I'd say it's by

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.180 
randomness to it it's I'd say it's by
far<00:03:19.000> the<00:03:19.060> best<00:03:19.360> method<00:03:19.720> of<00:03:19.810> splitting<00:03:20.190> when

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
far the best method of splitting when

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:22.470 
far the best method of splitting when
you're<00:03:21.310> out<00:03:21.430> of<00:03:21.459> combat<00:03:21.730> but<00:03:22.000> you<00:03:22.060> can't<00:03:22.270> do<00:03:22.390> it

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
you're out of combat but you can't do it

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:23.580 
you're out of combat but you can't do it
in<00:03:22.600> combat<00:03:22.930> because<00:03:23.020> once<00:03:23.260> you<00:03:23.350> guys<00:03:23.470> are

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
in combat because once you guys are

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.380 
in combat because once you guys are
already<00:03:23.739> shooting<00:03:24.010> if<00:03:24.310> you<00:03:24.400> give<00:03:24.580> to<00:03:24.760> a<00:03:24.790> Patrol

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
already shooting if you give to a Patrol

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:26.370 
already shooting if you give to a Patrol
Command<00:03:25.660> they're<00:03:25.750> not<00:03:25.870> going<00:03:25.959> to<00:03:26.020> do<00:03:26.140> anything

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
Command they're not going to do anything

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.979 
Command they're not going to do anything
so<00:03:26.680> that's<00:03:26.830> kind<00:03:27.070> of<00:03:27.100> silly<00:03:27.630> it<00:03:28.630> only<00:03:28.780> takes

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
so that's kind of silly it only takes

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:30.510 
so that's kind of silly it only takes
about<00:03:29.110> four<00:03:29.440> seconds<00:03:29.770> which<00:03:29.920> is<00:03:29.950> like<00:03:30.130> three

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:30.520 
about four seconds which is like three

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.920 
about four seconds which is like three
or<00:03:30.640> four<00:03:30.670> times<00:03:31.000> quicker<00:03:31.360> than<00:03:31.540> any<00:03:31.720> of<00:03:31.840> the

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
or four times quicker than any of the

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.010 
or four times quicker than any of the
other<00:03:32.250> methods<00:03:33.250> this<00:03:33.970> is<00:03:34.209> carpet<00:03:34.870> bomb

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:35.020 
other methods this is carpet bomb

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:36.930 
other methods this is carpet bomb

the balls or anything you can look at

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.990 
the balls or anything you can look at
the<00:03:50.260> clock<00:03:50.440> it<00:03:50.470> says<00:03:50.770> 20<00:03:51.100> seconds<00:03:51.700> and<00:03:51.880> then

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
the clock it says 20 seconds and then

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.510 
the clock it says 20 seconds and then
you<00:03:52.150> d<00:03:52.810> and<00:03:53.230> click<00:03:53.470> on<00:03:53.620> each<00:03:53.860> medevac

00:03:58.510 --> 00:03:58.520 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.670 

and<00:03:59.060> you<00:03:59.150> end<00:03:59.270> up<00:03:59.390> with<00:03:59.600> a<00:03:59.630> very<00:04:00.170> reasonable

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
and you end up with a very reasonable

and you end up with a very reasonable
split<00:04:03.130> it<00:04:04.130> takes<00:04:04.430> about<00:04:05.530> 8<00:04:06.530> to<00:04:06.710> 10<00:04:06.830> seconds<00:04:07.430> for

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:07.550 
split it takes about 8 to 10 seconds for

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:09.670 
split it takes about 8 to 10 seconds for
everyone<00:04:07.790> to<00:04:07.880> unload<00:04:08.180> but<00:04:08.840> actually<00:04:09.020> doing<00:04:09.530> it

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
everyone to unload but actually doing it

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.110 
everyone to unload but actually doing it
like<00:04:09.800> the<00:04:09.950> commands<00:04:10.280> you<00:04:10.460> have<00:04:10.580> to<00:04:10.700> issue<00:04:10.790> once

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
like the commands you have to issue once

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.180 
like the commands you have to issue once
you<00:04:11.240> click<00:04:11.540> d<00:04:11.780> and<00:04:12.290> told<00:04:12.590> your<00:04:12.710> medevacs<00:04:13.040> where

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
you click d and told your medevacs where

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:14.530 
you click d and told your medevacs where
to<00:04:13.250> go<00:04:13.370> you<00:04:13.520> can<00:04:13.640> stop<00:04:13.880> looking<00:04:14.000> at<00:04:14.270> after

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
to go you can stop looking at after

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.570 
to go you can stop looking at after
about<00:04:14.720> five<00:04:14.960> seconds<00:04:15.380> so<00:04:15.530> the<00:04:16.010> patrol<00:04:16.310> spread

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:16.580 
about five seconds so the patrol spread

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:18.340 
about five seconds so the patrol spread
is<00:04:16.730> like<00:04:16.880> four<00:04:17.120> seconds<00:04:17.570> the<00:04:17.750> carpet<00:04:18.230> bomb

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350 
is like four seconds the carpet bomb

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:19.780 
is like four seconds the carpet bomb
spread<00:04:18.620> is<00:04:18.739> like<00:04:18.860> five<00:04:19.040> seconds<00:04:19.340> carpet<00:04:19.670> bomb

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:19.790 
spread is like five seconds carpet bomb

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:21.670 
spread is like five seconds carpet bomb
gives<00:04:20.180> you<00:04:20.390> a<00:04:20.420> much<00:04:20.720> better<00:04:21.170> spread

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
gives you a much better spread

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.530 
gives you a much better spread
especially<00:04:22.400> if<00:04:22.550> you<00:04:22.640> have<00:04:22.670> ledges<00:04:23.270> you<00:04:23.390> can

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:23.540 
especially if you have ledges you can

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:24.970 
especially if you have ledges you can
split<00:04:23.870> them<00:04:23.960> across<00:04:24.200> ledges<00:04:24.740> and<00:04:24.830> now<00:04:24.920> the

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:24.980 
split them across ledges and now the

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:26.080 
split them across ledges and now the
main<00:04:25.160> things<00:04:25.340> have<00:04:25.490> to<00:04:25.550> come<00:04:25.580> here<00:04:25.850> and<00:04:25.970> then

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
main things have to come here and then

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.900 
main things have to come here and then
go<00:04:26.120> there<00:04:26.420> and<00:04:26.600> it's<00:04:26.750> much<00:04:27.140> better<00:04:27.550> but<00:04:28.550> carpet

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
go there and it's much better but carpet

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.520 
go there and it's much better but carpet
bomb<00:04:29.030> requires<00:04:29.420> medevac<00:04:29.750> swear<00:04:30.080> as<00:04:30.170> patrols

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.050 
bomb requires medevac swear as patrols
blade<00:04:30.800> doesn't<00:04:31.070> so<00:04:31.310> basically<00:04:31.640> learn<00:04:31.820> those

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
blade doesn't so basically learn those

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.790 
blade doesn't so basically learn those
two<00:04:32.300> out<00:04:32.450> of<00:04:32.480> combat<00:04:32.750> spreads<00:04:33.260> and<00:04:33.470> that's<00:04:33.590> all

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
two out of combat spreads and that's all

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.950 
two out of combat spreads and that's all
you'll<00:04:33.980> ever<00:04:34.070> need<00:04:34.220> to<00:04:34.460> know<00:04:34.610> in<00:04:35.570> combat

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
you'll ever need to know in combat

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.270 
you'll ever need to know in combat
spreading<00:04:36.350> is<00:04:36.470> a<00:04:36.500> pain<00:04:36.740> in<00:04:36.830> the<00:04:36.860> butt<00:04:37.010> totally

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
spreading is a pain in the butt totally

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.130 
spreading is a pain in the butt totally
doesn't<00:04:37.580> work<00:04:37.790> but<00:04:38.000> it's<00:04:38.120> worth<00:04:38.330> getting<00:04:38.720> at

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:39.140 
doesn't work but it's worth getting at

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:40.450 
doesn't work but it's worth getting at
least<00:04:39.200> reasonably<00:04:39.800> good<00:04:40.010> at<00:04:40.160> because<00:04:40.280> you're

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
least reasonably good at because you're

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.190 
least reasonably good at because you're
going<00:04:40.640> to<00:04:40.790> get<00:04:40.940> caught<00:04:41.240> in<00:04:41.390> combat<00:04:41.840> and<00:04:42.020> want

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:42.200 
going to get caught in combat and want

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.160 
going to get caught in combat and want
to<00:04:42.290> spread<00:04:42.560> and<00:04:42.770> lots<00:04:42.980> of<00:04:43.130> times<00:04:43.340> so<00:04:43.640> you<00:04:43.820> know

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:44.170 
to spread and lots of times so you know

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:46.750 
to spread and lots of times so you know
better<00:04:45.170> to<00:04:45.380> at<00:04:45.530> least<00:04:45.740> almost<00:04:46.100> know<00:04:46.490> how<00:04:46.580> to<00:04:46.670> do

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:46.760 
better to at least almost know how to do

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.650 
better to at least almost know how to do
it<00:04:46.880> right<00:04:47.710> oh<00:04:48.710> yeah<00:04:49.550> one<00:04:49.790> more<00:04:49.820> that<00:04:50.360> I<00:04:50.390> forgot

it right oh yeah one more that I forgot

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:52.600 
it right oh yeah one more that I forgot
to<00:04:50.750> mention<00:04:50.780> is<00:04:51.140> called<00:04:51.440> the<00:04:51.560> auto<00:04:51.710> spread<00:04:52.160> if

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
to mention is called the auto spread if

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:54.100 
to mention is called the auto spread if
you<00:04:52.790> right<00:04:53.000> click<00:04:53.030> on<00:04:53.390> something<00:04:53.690> be<00:04:53.930> it<00:04:53.990> an

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 
you right click on something be it an

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.640 
you right click on something be it an
ultralisk<00:04:54.650> or<00:04:54.950> a<00:04:55.480> hatchery<00:04:56.480> or<00:04:56.960> a<00:04:57.020> spawning

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.650 
ultralisk or a hatchery or a spawning

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:58.750 
ultralisk or a hatchery or a spawning
pool<00:04:57.920> or<00:04:58.040> whatever<00:04:58.280> your<00:04:58.430> guys<00:04:58.580> are

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:58.760 
pool or whatever your guys are

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.490 
pool or whatever your guys are
automatically<00:04:59.300> going<00:04:59.480> to<00:04:59.570> walk<00:04:59.780> the<00:04:59.960> exactly

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:00.500 
automatically going to walk the exactly

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.050 
automatically going to walk the exactly
five<00:05:00.740> range<00:05:01.010> away<00:05:01.250> from<00:05:01.400> that<00:05:01.520> thing<00:05:01.580> and<00:05:01.970> then

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
five range away from that thing and then

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.780 
five range away from that thing and then
end<00:05:02.630> up<00:05:02.750> just<00:05:03.080> stopping<00:05:03.590> there<00:05:03.740> and<00:05:03.950> that<00:05:04.460> ends

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:04.790 
end up just stopping there and that ends

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:06.390 
end up just stopping there and that ends
up<00:05:04.850> actually<00:05:05.240> being<00:05:05.360> a<00:05:05.540> pretty<00:05:05.810> reasonable

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400 
up actually being a pretty reasonable

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.760 
up actually being a pretty reasonable
anti<00:05:07.400> baneling<00:05:07.760> spread<00:05:08.050> it's<00:05:09.050> not<00:05:09.230> as<00:05:09.380> good<00:05:09.590> as

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:09.770 
anti baneling spread it's not as good as

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:11.620 
anti baneling spread it's not as good as
any<00:05:09.800> of<00:05:10.190> the<00:05:10.370> other<00:05:10.490> types<00:05:10.820> of<00:05:11.000> spreads<00:05:11.330> but

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 
any of the other types of spreads but

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.270 
any of the other types of spreads but
when<00:05:12.020> you're<00:05:12.170> on<00:05:12.290> the<00:05:12.320> move<00:05:12.470> it's<00:05:12.920> the<00:05:13.070> best

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:13.280 
when you're on the move it's the best

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:14.439 
when you're on the move it's the best
way<00:05:13.460> to<00:05:13.520> quickly<00:05:13.910> quick

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:14.449 
way to quickly quick

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:18.700 
way to quickly quick
quickly<00:05:14.900> spread<00:05:17.469> especially<00:05:18.469> if<00:05:18.529> there's<00:05:18.680> a

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
quickly spread especially if there's a

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.049 
quickly spread especially if there's a
hatchery<00:05:18.889> that<00:05:19.129> you<00:05:19.189> had<00:05:19.309> to<00:05:19.400> shoot<00:05:19.580> at<00:05:19.729> anyway

00:05:20.049 --> 00:05:20.059 
hatchery that you had to shoot at anyway

00:05:20.059 --> 00:05:21.610 
hatchery that you had to shoot at anyway
right<00:05:20.300> so<00:05:20.509> each<00:05:20.659> baneling<00:05:21.050> splash<00:05:21.289> is<00:05:21.439> going

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:21.620 
right so each baneling splash is going

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.110 
right so each baneling splash is going
to<00:05:21.710> usually<00:05:21.979> hit<00:05:22.099> about<00:05:22.279> four<00:05:22.520> guys<00:05:22.729> but<00:05:22.969> if<00:05:23.029> it

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 
to usually hit about four guys but if it

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.640 
to usually hit about four guys but if it
comes<00:05:23.270> right<00:05:23.719> in<00:05:23.839> the<00:05:23.930> middle<00:05:24.080> here<00:05:24.169> it<00:05:24.499> can

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:24.650 
comes right in the middle here it can

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:27.249 
comes right in the middle here it can
hit<00:05:24.770> like<00:05:25.009> five<00:05:25.400> or<00:05:25.639> six<00:05:25.909> guys<00:05:26.089> so<00:05:26.900> it's<00:05:27.050> not<00:05:27.199> a

00:05:27.249 --> 00:05:27.259 
hit like five or six guys so it's not a

00:05:27.259 --> 00:05:28.989 
hit like five or six guys so it's not a
great<00:05:27.469> spread<00:05:27.889> but<00:05:28.099> it's<00:05:28.249> easy<00:05:28.400> to<00:05:28.580> set<00:05:28.759> up<00:05:28.789> and

00:05:28.989 --> 00:05:28.999 
great spread but it's easy to set up and

00:05:28.999 --> 00:05:30.159 
great spread but it's easy to set up and
you<00:05:29.150> can<00:05:29.330> just<00:05:29.449> right<00:05:29.599> click<00:05:29.629> on<00:05:29.839> the<00:05:29.930> hatchery

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:30.169 
you can just right click on the hatchery

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:31.629 
you can just right click on the hatchery
and<00:05:30.229> then<00:05:30.379> go<00:05:30.559> back<00:05:30.680> to<00:05:30.740> your<00:05:30.979> base<00:05:31.069> in<00:05:31.279> macro

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:31.639 
and then go back to your base in macro

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:33.100 
and then go back to your base in macro
so<00:05:31.879> it's<00:05:32.059> something<00:05:32.330> you<00:05:32.419> can<00:05:32.569> do<00:05:32.689> in<00:05:32.839> like

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.110 
so it's something you can do in like

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:34.929 
so it's something you can do in like
zero<00:05:33.439> seconds<00:05:33.889> definitely<00:05:34.460> worth<00:05:34.580> knowing

00:05:34.929 --> 00:05:34.939 
zero seconds definitely worth knowing

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:40.210 
zero seconds definitely worth knowing
about<00:05:35.680> and<00:05:36.680> that<00:05:36.830> was<00:05:37.009> finally<00:05:37.669> last<00:05:37.909> one<00:05:38.089> by
