had bad experiences in the past I just
don't<00:05:01.630> think<00:05:01.840> that's<00:05:02.080> really<00:05:02.410> fair<00:05:02.590> maybe<00:05:03.100> the

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.220 
don't think that's really fair maybe the

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:04.520 
don't think that's really fair maybe the
least<00:05:03.370> you<00:05:03.550> guys<00:05:03.669> could<00:05:03.850> have<00:05:03.940> done<00:05:04.090> was

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:04.530 
least you guys could have done was

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:07.100 
least you guys could have done was
expediting<00:05:05.530> the<00:05:05.650> shipping<00:05:06.010> if<00:05:06.190> you<00:05:06.729> guys

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
expediting the shipping if you guys

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:09.780 
expediting the shipping if you guys
didn't<00:05:08.110> ship<00:05:08.290> it<00:05:08.410> out<00:05:08.530> until<00:05:08.889> after<00:05:09.190> you

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:09.790 
didn't ship it out until after you

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:11.790 
didn't ship it out until after you
promised<00:05:10.240> you<00:05:10.330> would<00:05:10.450> ship<00:05:10.630> it<00:05:10.750> out<00:05:10.870> the<00:05:11.590> least

you could do is send it through air like

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:16.290 
you could do is send it through air like
