00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.390 
one potential drawback is the game is so
highly<00:03:29.280> interactive<00:03:29.580> and<00:03:30.209> so<00:03:30.480> dependent<00:03:31.020> on

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
highly interactive and so dependent on

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.670 
highly interactive and so dependent on
bluffing<00:03:32.400> and<00:03:32.670> deception<00:03:33.510> that<00:03:33.720> it<00:03:34.440> can<00:03:34.590> be

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
bluffing and deception that it can be

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.590 
bluffing and deception that it can be
intimidating<00:03:34.950> for<00:03:35.340> players<00:03:35.790> who<00:03:36.180> aren't<00:03:36.510> very

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
intimidating for players who aren't very

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.900 
intimidating for players who aren't very
good<00:03:36.810> at<00:03:36.959> bluffing<00:03:37.350> or<00:03:37.620> who<00:03:37.920> don't<00:03:38.100> like<00:03:38.489> games

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
good at bluffing or who don't like games

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.880 
good at bluffing or who don't like games
that<00:03:39.300> have<00:03:39.510> that<00:03:39.720> much<00:03:39.900> direct<00:03:40.320> conflict

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
that have that much direct conflict

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.920 
that have that much direct conflict
because<00:03:41.489> there<00:03:41.670> really<00:03:41.700> isn't<00:03:42.090> anything<00:03:42.510> to

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
because there really isn't anything to

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.590 
because there really isn't anything to
the<00:03:43.110> game<00:03:43.230> beyond<00:03:43.620> Ted<00:03:43.950> so<00:03:44.670> another<00:03:45.000> con<00:03:45.330> for

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
the game beyond Ted so another con for

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.050 
the game beyond Ted so another con for
this<00:03:45.720> game<00:03:45.930> is<00:03:46.170> it<00:03:46.560> really<00:03:47.040> isn't<00:03:47.280> at<00:03:47.670> its<00:03:47.790> best

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
this game is it really isn't at its best

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.180 
this game is it really isn't at its best
with<00:03:48.420> two<00:03:48.600> players<00:03:48.900> you<00:03:49.709> should<00:03:49.920> really<00:03:50.100> have
