and<00:04:22.240> all<00:04:22.330> the<00:04:22.419> sudden<00:04:22.600> it's<00:04:22.840> all<00:04:22.960> healed<00:04:23.289> back

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
and all the sudden it's all healed back

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.830 
and all the sudden it's all healed back
up<00:04:23.710> because<00:04:23.949> those<00:04:24.639> hot<00:04:24.880> SAR<00:04:25.150> keep<00:04:25.360> going<00:04:25.690> up

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
up because those hot SAR keep going up

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.719 
up because those hot SAR keep going up

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:56.470 
flying all over the place and I think

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:02.070 
flying all over the place and I think
that's<00:05:56.590> pretty<00:05:56.770> cool<00:05:57.120> and<00:05:59.640> mmm<00:06:01.020> it's<00:06:02.020> pretty

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:02.080 
that's pretty cool and mmm it's pretty

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.460 
that's pretty cool and mmm it's pretty
much<00:06:02.260> all<00:06:02.440> i<00:06:02.470> gotta<00:06:02.680> say<00:06:02.740> it's<00:06:03.250> a<00:06:03.340> great<00:06:03.580> class

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:04.470 
much all i gotta say it's a great class

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:08.940 
much all i gotta say it's a great class
it<00:06:05.470> can<00:06:05.800> be<00:06:05.950> pretty<00:06:06.220> hard<00:06:06.880> asked<00:06:07.510> if<00:06:07.740> levels<00:06:08.740> 1

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:08.950 
it can be pretty hard asked if levels 1

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:11.100 
it can be pretty hard asked if levels 1
to<00:06:09.100> 10<00:06:09.310> before<00:06:09.460> you<00:06:09.700> get<00:06:09.910> the<00:06:10.240> bear<00:06:10.600> form<00:06:10.870> class

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:11.110 
to 10 before you get the bear form class

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:14.780 
to 10 before you get the bear form class
but<00:06:11.640> otherwise<00:06:12.750> leveling<00:06:13.750> is<00:06:13.870> pretty<00:06:14.080> nice

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:14.790 
but otherwise leveling is pretty nice

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:18.900

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:22.090 
of one of the classes I'd recommend to

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:24.900 
of one of the classes I'd recommend to
start<00:06:22.750> off<00:06:22.870> with<00:06:23.110> because<00:06:23.490> like<00:06:24.490> maybe<00:06:24.730> you

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:31.030 
classes like I don't maybe not as good
