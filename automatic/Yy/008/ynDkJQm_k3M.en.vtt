00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.420 
cup of warm water and with the yeast
starts<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.890> dissolving<00:01:02.550> process<00:01:04.189> it<00:01:05.189> should

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
starts the dissolving process it should

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.030 
starts the dissolving process it should
start<00:01:05.790> to<00:01:05.880> bubble<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.390> little<00:01:06.510> bit<00:01:06.860> you<00:01:07.860> don't

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
start to bubble a little bit you don't

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.700 
start to bubble a little bit you don't
want<00:01:08.220> your<00:01:08.340> water<00:01:08.580> to<00:01:09.150> hot<00:01:09.450> it<00:01:10.200> just<00:01:10.229> should<00:01:10.590> be

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
want your water to hot it just should be

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.490 
want your water to hot it just should be
nice<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.400> warm<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:12.270> touch<00:01:15.020> as<00:01:16.020> I<00:01:16.110> said<00:01:16.350> we've

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
nice and warm to touch as I said we've

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.640 
nice and warm to touch as I said we've
got<00:01:16.530> some<00:01:16.950> scalded<00:01:17.549> milk<00:01:17.820> over<00:01:18.180> here<00:01:18.650> and

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
got some scalded milk over here and

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.620 
got some scalded milk over here and
we're<00:01:19.799> going<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:20.100> combine<00:01:20.310> these<00:01:20.700> two<00:01:20.759> it's

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
we're going to combine these two it's

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.530 
we're going to combine these two it's
been<00:01:21.869> scalded<00:01:22.380> but<00:01:23.040> it's<00:01:23.189> cooled<00:01:23.970> off<00:01:24.150> so<00:01:24.420> it

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
been scalded but it's cooled off so it

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.469 
been scalded but it's cooled off so it
is<00:01:24.659> no<00:01:24.869> longer<00:01:24.950> hot<00:01:25.950> hot<00:01:26.159> hot<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.670> we<00:01:27.450> are

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
is no longer hot hot hot and we are

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:33.730 
is no longer hot hot hot and we are
going<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:28.310> incorporate<00:01:29.479> that<00:01:30.479> with<00:01:31.259> our<00:01:31.439> yeast

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.719 

this<00:01:34.740> is<00:01:34.950> what<00:01:35.340> we<00:01:35.460> call<00:01:35.700> making<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.329> sponge

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
this is what we call making the sponge

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:42.020 
this is what we call making the sponge
once<00:01:38.729> we<00:01:38.939> get<00:01:39.090> this<00:01:39.450> all<00:01:39.750> together<00:01:40.880> I'm<00:01:41.880> going

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
once we get this all together I'm going

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.670 
once we get this all together I'm going
to<00:01:42.119> put<00:01:42.270> it<00:01:42.390> aside<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:42.960> it's<00:01:43.049> going<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.350> rest

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
to put it aside and it's going to rest

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:50.359 
to put it aside and it's going to rest
for<00:01:44.490> some<00:01:44.759> time<00:01:45.020> so<00:01:46.020> we<00:01:46.200> add<00:01:46.380> our<00:01:47.360> salt<00:01:49.070> to<00:01:50.070> our

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
for some time so we add our salt to our

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:56.670 
for some time so we add our salt to our
flour<00:01:51.290> and<00:01:52.290> then<00:01:52.560> we<00:01:53.189> start<00:01:53.520> adding

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.290 

flower<00:01:57.340> to<00:01:57.820> the<00:01:57.850> yeast<00:01:58.270> mixture<00:01:59.820> let's<00:02:00.820> mix<00:02:01.120> it

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 
flower to the yeast mixture let's mix it

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.870 
flower to the yeast mixture let's mix it
up<00:02:01.710> just<00:02:02.710> a<00:02:02.890> little<00:02:02.920> bit<00:02:04.650> you<00:02:05.650> might<00:02:05.890> it<00:02:06.670> might

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
up just a little bit you might it might

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.770 
up just a little bit you might it might
be<00:02:07.060> a<00:02:07.090> cup<00:02:07.450> it<00:02:07.690> might<00:02:07.900> be<00:02:08.050> a<00:02:08.080> little<00:02:08.229> bit<00:02:08.470> more

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
be a cup it might be a little bit more

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.550 
be a cup it might be a little bit more
you're<00:02:10.780> just<00:02:10.810> trying<00:02:11.380> to<00:02:11.410> make<00:02:11.620> your<00:02:12.120> thick

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
you're just trying to make your thick

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.880 
you're just trying to make your thick
sponge<00:02:14.580> but<00:02:15.580> you<00:02:15.700> don't<00:02:15.850> want<00:02:16.000> it<00:02:16.060> too<00:02:16.330> thick

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
sponge but you don't want it too thick

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:26.280 
sponge but you don't want it too thick
is<00:02:17.890> then<00:02:18.070> it<00:02:18.190> won't<00:02:18.280> rise<00:02:25.080> actually<00:02:26.080> need<00:02:26.260> a

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
is then it won't rise actually need a

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.050 
is then it won't rise actually need a
little<00:02:26.560> bit<00:02:26.650> a<00:02:27.040> little<00:02:27.460> bit<00:02:27.580> more<00:02:27.850> flour<00:02:30.060> shake

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
little bit a little bit more flour shake

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:43.100 
little bit a little bit more flour shake
it<00:02:31.240> in

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:53.170 

I'm<00:02:43.770> starting<00:02:44.280> to<00:02:44.340> get<00:02:44.460> someone
