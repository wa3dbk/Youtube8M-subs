00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:03.270
 i 

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.450
 hello people how are you welcome to me 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:09.370
 Main channel Incoherent urbanization 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:12.639
 today we are with jacques since they are very 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:14.139
 near me and it makes me nervous that what 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:16.750
 happens that we are sitting here in the 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:18.490
 ladder and good when you're sitting on 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.920
 the staircase that is a very staircase 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:25.600
 small then you have to sit down 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:29.380
 it seems to be violating people I am what 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:32.140
 rather here I am happy one more week 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.420
 today is Tuesday I'm not smoked I'm not 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.030
 drugged by doubts because you learn from 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.040
 those people and reformed are not informed 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.230
 I'm fine, do not smoke marijuana 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.270
 let's talk about a very very subject 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:46.899
 important especially those people 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:49.450
 who likes to set aside people who 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:52.600
 they are not part of your group, that is , if they do not 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:55.690
 of the painting of such a painting 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:59.739
 team of such political party of such 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:02.140
 religion or such in group sub group what 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:04.210
 that is to exclude other people 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:07.090
 who think differently from us or who 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:09.630
 they have different beliefs it does not matter 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.759
 of what there are many people 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.189
 that is, if you do not like him 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:16.439
 person you are not going to be part of the group is 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:20.880
 like there seems to be groups in the 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:23.789
 which have bosses or directors that 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.460
 you have to fall well to them to form 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:29.909
 part of that whole group is how it is like 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.789
 It's like a sect is very interesting 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:35.130
 It has happened to me many times of people 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:37.890
 that have come to me because I know such 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:41.700
 person and want to be part of the group 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:44.729
 today and things like that happen a lot on the subject of 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:48.659
 youtube is also that if you are not part 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:51.000
 of that popular group I do not know is very very 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.860
 complicated the subject of speaking it but I 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.709
 I am a very open person that I give 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:59.030
 space to all people you can be 

00:01:55.709 --> 00:02:02.390
 the opposite of me can be completely 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:06.390
 thought of having different types of 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:08.849
 ideological positions or postures 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.039
 politics I love to debate I love 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:13.280
 see other points of view because the 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.950
 people think if you why 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.560
 part of that group or whatever 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:22.190
 I am a very open person and never 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:25.910
 I'm going to rate someone because of how you are 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:28.700
 we live in a very broad society very 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:31.459
 diverse of many groups and we can 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.959
 be moving away from each other 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:36.110
 because if we are not always in the 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:38.270
 and we are always good 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.459
 cheeses bad cheeses of that group that 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.800
 I am that group, it happens a lot too 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:45.590
 for example in my country in Uruguay there are 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.720
 two for two soccer teams very very 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.810
 known one is called national and the other 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:53.930
 it's called peñarol then for years and 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:57.470
 years and years and years 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.459
 these groups are thrown sticks one of 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.280
 we 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:03.500
 the Uruguayan mentality you will have 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.420
 it always matters if you're from the national of 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.370
 peñarol and these are simply also 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.650
 happens on the subject of politics a lot 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.440
 people think that I am from the left 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:16.069
 or right or you are capitalist or 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.380
 socialist or sos communist that is to say me 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:20.440
 it seems ridiculous 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:23.710
 that people put everyone in a bag 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:26.230
 in a high picture you are you and it is not like that 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:28.090
 you can not qualify and put all in the 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.670
 same bag mind for that but for the 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.580
 wave that you have yes yes heard be 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.920
 music or because you listen cumbia or because 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.690
 listen to the electronic music or because 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.750
 listen rock 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:42.820
 or whatever or rap can be any 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:46.960
 thing what you like but always 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:49.420
 we are pushing people away in groups and 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:52.210
 I think the ridiculous and the people are very 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:54.790
 closed so so tight that he thinks 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:57.520
 what that because if you do not have is lombao 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:00.310
 because you do not dress in such a way you do not go 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:02.380
 to be part of that group and last 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.320
 he is as ignorant as the others 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:07.420
 people I find ridiculous and that's what 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.800
 I love it when you see someone who does not 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.070
 has nothing to do with the other and 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:14.380
 they coexist and they are together and they share 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:18.340
 completely opposite ideas 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:20.410
 and they exchange and share something and that's what 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.370
 that I love society when we 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.400
 we mix 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:26.919
 how are we all together and not 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.229
 moving away because current person 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:31.600
 think in such a way or because you are or 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:33.520
 because you eat meat or because it started 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.340
 because you are vegan because you are 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:39.970
 vegetarian or because you are religious 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:43.199
 because you're an atheist, it seems ridiculous to me 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:46.750
 the people we are constantly 

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:49.560
 qualifying in groups I am a being 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.560
 human is to say 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:57.340
 I am a human being and here we are the 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:59.710
 two living together in a video please 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.419
 do not fix people because they think 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.789
 different or because they have tastes 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:06.340
 different you are the same is to say because 

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:08.990
 you are limiting you are limiting to 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:11.390
 have other things mix tea 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.190
 to show other people also because 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:15.650
 We all learn from all someone who does not 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:17.360
 have this possibility of knowing another 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.640
 kind of people then that's why I always 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:22.820
 it stays in that group but when mixing 

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:25.670
 and we open ourselves and being 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:28.340
 completely open cca to others 

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:30.050
 people and you're also opening the 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:32.030
 horizons to those people so that 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:32.810
 have the possibility to see other things 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:34.970
 different 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:37.280
 I consider youtuber because I make videos 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:40.430

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:48.100
