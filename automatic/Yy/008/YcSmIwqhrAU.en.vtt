00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
in real time you were out of the loop

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.090 
in real time you were out of the loop
the<00:03:28.299> next<00:03:28.570> day<00:03:28.780> at<00:03:28.930> work<00:03:28.959> you<00:03:29.500> couldn't<00:03:29.950> talk

the next day at work you couldn't talk

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.910 
the next day at work you couldn't talk
about<00:03:30.160> it<00:03:30.519> you<00:03:31.090> couldn't<00:03:31.390> talk<00:03:31.510> about<00:03:31.750> so<00:03:32.350> we

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
about it you couldn't talk about so we

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.729 
about it you couldn't talk about so we
were<00:03:33.100> bonded<00:03:33.700> in<00:03:33.880> what<00:03:34.329> we<00:03:34.510> adored<00:03:35.320> and<00:03:35.650> we

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
were bonded in what we adored and we

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:37.350 
were bonded in what we adored and we
were<00:03:35.860> very<00:03:36.070> knowledgeable<00:03:36.280> about<00:03:36.700> it<00:03:36.850> you<00:03:37.180> see

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
were very knowledgeable about it you see

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.720 
were very knowledgeable about it you see
so<00:03:37.660> it<00:03:38.560> would<00:03:38.769> seem<00:03:38.980> to<00:03:39.010> me<00:03:39.220> to<00:03:39.250> be<00:03:39.430> more

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
so it would seem to me to be more

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.180 
so it would seem to me to be more
intense<00:03:40.180> and<00:03:40.570> and<00:03:41.200> it<00:03:41.560> seemed<00:03:41.769> to<00:03:41.860> me<00:03:41.980> to<00:03:42.010> be<00:03:42.130> a

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
intense and and it seemed to me to be a

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.180
