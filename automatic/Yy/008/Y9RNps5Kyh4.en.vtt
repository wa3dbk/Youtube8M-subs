00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
have a decent sized telescope that I've

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.520 
have a decent sized telescope that I've
used<00:01:29.770> many<00:01:30.310> many<00:01:30.549> times<00:01:30.820> I<00:01:31.030> know<00:01:31.929> most<00:01:32.350> of<00:01:32.439> the

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
complexity of our universe and how our

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.190 
complexity of our universe and how our
planets<00:01:39.759> mate<00:01:40.000> and<00:01:40.210> that's<00:01:40.329> actually<00:01:40.539> where

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
planets mate and that's actually where

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.359
