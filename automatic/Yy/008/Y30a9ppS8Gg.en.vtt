00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
are studying it and it's very cut and

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.000 
are studying it and it's very cut and
dry<00:00:20.010> but<00:00:20.760> in<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.150> simulation<00:00:21.960> you<00:00:22.260> learn<00:00:22.830> how

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
dry but in the simulation you learn how

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.970 
dry but in the simulation you learn how
to<00:00:23.039> react<00:00:23.400> to<00:00:23.490> certain<00:00:23.699> situations<00:00:24.359> without

symptoms<00:01:13.229> of<00:01:13.530> morphine<00:01:13.890> overdose<00:01:14.400> so<00:01:15.060> we<00:01:15.210> had

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
symptoms of morphine overdose so we had

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.289 
symptoms of morphine overdose so we had
to<00:01:15.720> think<00:01:16.200> fast<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:16.710> on<00:01:16.830> our<00:01:16.950> feet<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.130> I<00:01:17.820> give

have a sim child a sim baby we have a
two<00:01:26.340> vital<00:01:27.270> sim<00:01:27.509> units<00:01:28.320> who<00:01:28.650> are<00:01:28.979> not<00:01:29.369> as

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
two vital sim units who are not as

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.719 
two vital sim units who are not as
high-tech<00:01:30.930> but<00:01:31.470> they<00:01:31.560> do<00:01:31.619> provide<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.130> basics

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
high-tech but they do provide the basics

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.789 
high-tech but they do provide the basics

sounds heart sounds they do speak so you
can<00:01:39.240> put<00:01:39.479> them<00:01:39.600> in<00:01:39.689> a<00:01:39.810> scenario<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:41.070> great

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
can put them in a scenario and the great

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.039 
can put them in a scenario and the great
thing<00:01:41.430> about<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.820> vital<00:01:42.210> some<00:01:42.390> units<00:01:42.750> are

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
thing about the vital some units are

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.990 
thing about the vital some units are
that<00:01:43.439> you<00:01:43.710> can<00:01:43.890> throw<00:01:44.040> them<00:01:44.189> in<00:01:44.340> stitch<00:01:44.549> you<00:01:44.729> so

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
that you can throw them in stitch you so

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.819 
that you can throw them in stitch you so
you<00:01:45.060> can<00:01:45.420> put<00:01:45.960> them<00:01:46.049> on<00:01:46.170> a<00:01:46.229> stretcher<00:01:46.680> and

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
the unique thing also with simulation is

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.800 
the unique thing also with simulation is
that<00:01:54.920> the<00:01:55.460> student<00:01:55.820> is<00:01:55.939> allowed<00:01:56.210> to<00:01:56.270> be

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
that the student is allowed to be

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.899 
that the student is allowed to be
brought<00:01:56.960> into<00:01:57.320> a<00:01:57.350> safe<00:01:57.770> learning<00:01:58.070> environment

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909 
brought into a safe learning environment

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:02.950 
brought into a safe learning environment
and<00:01:59.740> there<00:02:00.740> the<00:02:01.520> capacity<00:02:02.119> to<00:02:02.149> make<00:02:02.420> mistakes

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
and there the capacity to make mistakes

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.039 
and there the capacity to make mistakes
is<00:02:03.320> is<00:02:03.970> manageable<00:02:04.970> in<00:02:05.149> the<00:02:05.240> simulation<00:02:05.810> room

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 
is is manageable in the simulation room

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:08.740 
is is manageable in the simulation room
in<00:02:06.500> critical<00:02:07.220> care<00:02:07.399> I'll<00:02:08.149> be<00:02:08.330> had<00:02:08.450> a<00:02:08.479> sim

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
in critical care I'll be had a sim

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.330 
in critical care I'll be had a sim
patient<00:02:09.470> that<00:02:09.770> was<00:02:09.920> on<00:02:10.039> a<00:02:10.069> mechanical

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
patient that was on a mechanical

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.940 
patient that was on a mechanical
ventilator<00:02:10.610> and<00:02:11.239> his<00:02:11.420> vent<00:02:11.840> was<00:02:11.989> failing<00:02:12.200> so

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
ventilator and his vent was failing so

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.010 
ventilator and his vent was failing so
we<00:02:13.100> need<00:02:13.250> to<00:02:13.459> collaborate<00:02:14.030> with<00:02:14.060> the<00:02:14.630> nursing

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
we need to collaborate with the nursing

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.470 
we need to collaborate with the nursing
team<00:02:15.290> the<00:02:15.620> intensivist<00:02:16.280> and<00:02:16.550> the<00:02:17.180> family

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
team the intensivist and the family

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.660 
team the intensivist and the family
members<00:02:17.780> in<00:02:18.050> order<00:02:18.230> to<00:02:18.530> really<00:02:19.100> get<00:02:19.340> this

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
members in order to really get this

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.690 
members in order to really get this
patient<00:02:20.090> back<00:02:20.630> to<00:02:20.870> where<00:02:21.019> he<00:02:21.800> needed<00:02:22.069> to<00:02:22.190> be<00:02:22.310> to

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
patient back to where he needed to be to

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.550 
patient back to where he needed to be to
be<00:02:22.790> stable<00:02:23.150> so<00:02:23.750> I<00:02:23.780> learned<00:02:24.110> a<00:02:24.290> lot<00:02:24.500> about

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
be stable so I learned a lot about

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.680 
be stable so I learned a lot about
collaborating<00:02:25.370> as<00:02:25.519> a<00:02:25.550> nursing<00:02:26.030> team<00:02:26.300> and<00:02:26.569> not

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
collaborating as a nursing team and not

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:33.340 
collaborating as a nursing team and not
just<00:02:27.050> one<00:02:27.739> on<00:02:27.860> one<00:02:31.299> we<00:02:32.299> have<00:02:32.510> an<00:02:32.660> ICU<00:02:33.080> room

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
just one on one we have an ICU room

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.590 
just one on one we have an ICU room
where<00:02:33.769> we<00:02:33.890> have<00:02:34.130> a<00:02:34.160> simulation<00:02:34.940> baby

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
where we have a simulation baby

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.750 
where we have a simulation baby
so<00:02:36.140> we<00:02:36.260> simulate<00:02:36.650> the<00:02:36.739> NICU<00:02:36.950> the<00:02:37.430> neonatal

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
so we simulate the NICU the neonatal

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.059 
so we simulate the NICU the neonatal
intensive<00:02:38.000> care<00:02:38.330> unit<00:02:38.840> we<00:02:39.200> also<00:02:39.440> simulate<00:02:39.860> the

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
intensive care unit we also simulate the

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:43.210 
intensive care unit we also simulate the
adults<00:02:40.489> or<00:02:40.640> medical<00:02:41.450> ICU<00:02:42.010> throughout<00:02:43.010> every

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
simulation we had comfort and knowing

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.479 
simulation we had comfort and knowing
that<00:02:45.080> our<00:02:45.319> professors<00:02:45.799> were<00:02:45.980> in<00:02:46.069> the<00:02:46.130> control
