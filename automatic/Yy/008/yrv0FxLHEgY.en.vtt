00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
half-life 3 but valve has kind of been

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.399 
half-life 3 but valve has kind of been
quiet<00:01:50.250> over<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.850> last<00:01:51.090> year<00:01:51.420> or<00:01:51.450> two<00:01:51.750> I<00:01:52.020> mean

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
quiet over the last year or two I mean

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.350 
quiet over the last year or two I mean
they've<00:01:52.530> released<00:01:52.680> global<00:01:53.640> Offensive<00:01:54.180> and

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
they've released global Offensive and

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.789 
they've released global Offensive and
they've<00:01:54.509> been<00:01:54.630> working<00:01:54.810> on<00:01:55.020> dota<00:01:55.320> 2<00:01:55.590> but

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
they've been working on dota 2 but

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.649 
they've been working on dota 2 but
really<00:01:56.159> we<00:01:56.520> haven't<00:01:56.820> seen<00:01:57.030> anything<00:01:57.329> since

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.800 
really we haven't seen anything since
portal<00:01:58.290> 2<00:01:58.619> I<00:01:58.649> think<00:01:59.189> as<00:01:59.759> a<00:01:59.820> big<00:02:00.090> blockbuster

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
portal 2 I think as a big blockbuster

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:01.940 
portal 2 I think as a big blockbuster
game<00:02:00.990> I<00:02:01.140> don't<00:02:01.320> know<00:02:01.380> if<00:02:01.439> it's<00:02:01.560> been<00:02:01.710> that<00:02:01.920> long

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
game I don't know if it's been that long

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.219 
game I don't know if it's been that long
but<00:02:02.430> I<00:02:02.670> think<00:02:03.060> yeah<00:02:03.210> it's<00:02:03.420> been<00:02:03.540> portal<00:02:03.960> 2<00:02:04.079> and

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
but I think yeah it's been portal 2 and

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.350 
but I think yeah it's been portal 2 and
that<00:02:04.350> was<00:02:04.469> two<00:02:04.649> thousand<00:02:04.979> eleven<00:02:05.040> or<00:02:05.520> 2010<00:02:06.180> so

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
that was two thousand eleven or 2010 so

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.059 
that was two thousand eleven or 2010 so
that's<00:02:06.509> been<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.689> quite<00:02:07.259> a<00:02:07.290> while<00:02:07.530> so<00:02:07.740> hopefully

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
that's been a quite a while so hopefully

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.669 
that's been a quite a while so hopefully
they<00:02:08.190> get<00:02:08.369> a<00:02:08.580> new<00:02:08.789> game<00:02:09.030> release<00:02:09.479> soon<00:02:09.899> valve
