overshadows<00:03:13.580> Superman<00:03:14.209> here<00:03:14.630> in<00:03:14.780> this<00:03:14.900> movie

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
overshadows Superman here in this movie

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.759 
overshadows Superman here in this movie
I<00:03:15.470> think<00:03:15.980> it<00:03:16.220> looks<00:03:16.370> plausible<00:03:17.680> also<00:03:18.680> the

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
I think it looks plausible also the

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:20.140 
I think it looks plausible also the
other<00:03:18.890> thing<00:03:19.130> is<00:03:19.220> this<00:03:19.340> is<00:03:19.489> such<00:03:19.610> a<00:03:19.640> stark

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
other thing is this is such a stark

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.780 
other thing is this is such a stark
change<00:03:20.630> in<00:03:21.019> tone<00:03:21.410> for<00:03:22.100> the<00:03:22.220> film<00:03:22.430> for<00:03:22.700> the

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
change in tone for the film for the

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.539 
change in tone for the film for the
advertising<00:03:23.299> campaign<00:03:23.780> I<00:03:23.989> mean<00:03:24.320> obviously

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
advertising campaign I mean obviously

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:26.920 
advertising campaign I mean obviously
movies<00:03:25.549> always<00:03:25.760> release<00:03:26.150> lots<00:03:26.360> of<00:03:26.510> trailers

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
movies always release lots of trailers

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.479 
movies always release lots of trailers
up<00:03:27.170> until<00:03:27.470> you<00:03:27.799> know<00:03:27.890> the<00:03:28.010> film<00:03:28.190> comes<00:03:28.400> out

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
up until you know the film comes out

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:30.880 
up until you know the film comes out
especially<00:03:29.000> these<00:03:29.120> days<00:03:29.420> but<00:03:30.200> this<00:03:30.500> is<00:03:30.709> like<00:03:30.860> a

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
especially these days but this is like a

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.890 
especially these days but this is like a
big<00:03:31.190> change<00:03:31.610> it's<00:03:32.090> not<00:03:32.150> only<00:03:32.390> I've<00:03:32.600> seen<00:03:32.780> some

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
big change it's not only I've seen some

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.240 
big change it's not only I've seen some
of<00:03:32.989> you<00:03:33.080> saying<00:03:33.320> it's<00:03:33.470> showing<00:03:33.769> too<00:03:33.890> much<00:03:34.100> I

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
of you saying it's showing too much I

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:35.289 
of you saying it's showing too much I
mean<00:03:34.370> they're<00:03:34.489> showing<00:03:34.730> a<00:03:34.790> lot<00:03:34.910> more<00:03:34.940> of<00:03:35.209> the

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
mean they're showing a lot more of the

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:37.630 
mean they're showing a lot more of the
movie<00:03:35.680> you<00:03:36.680> just<00:03:36.830> seeing<00:03:36.920> all<00:03:37.040> these<00:03:37.130> posters

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
movie you just seeing all these posters

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.370 
movie you just seeing all these posters
come<00:03:37.880> out<00:03:38.060> and<00:03:38.299> so<00:03:38.810> I<00:03:38.840> think<00:03:38.989> they're<00:03:39.230> either

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
come out and so I think they're either

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:40.810 
come out and so I think they're either
tube<00:03:39.680> they're<00:03:39.890> two<00:03:40.070> reasons<00:03:40.489> well<00:03:40.640> there<00:03:40.760> are

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:40.820 
tube they're two reasons well there are

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.250 
tube they're two reasons well there are
three<00:03:41.030> reasons<00:03:41.390> for<00:03:41.510> this<00:03:41.630> one<00:03:41.900> this<00:03:42.080> was

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
three reasons for this one this was

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.250 
three reasons for this one this was
always<00:03:42.440> Warner<00:03:42.860> Brothers<00:03:43.130> plan<00:03:43.400> to<00:03:44.120> do<00:03:44.900> a<00:03:44.930> slow

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
always Warner Brothers plan to do a slow

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.409 
always Warner Brothers plan to do a slow
build<00:03:45.530> you<00:03:45.769> know<00:03:45.799> slow<00:03:46.130> burn<00:03:46.400> just<00:03:46.730> right<00:03:47.329> up

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:47.419 
build you know slow burn just right up

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:48.770 
build you know slow burn just right up
to<00:03:47.510> the<00:03:47.600> last<00:03:47.750> minute<00:03:47.989> be<00:03:48.230> like<00:03:48.380> okay

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
to the last minute be like okay

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.290 
to the last minute be like okay
have<00:03:48.870> to<00:03:49.020> see<00:03:49.170> this<00:03:49.319> the<00:03:50.220> second<00:03:50.550> one<00:03:50.700> might<00:03:51.270> be

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:51.300 
have to see this the second one might be

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.120 
have to see this the second one might be
because<00:03:51.750> maybe<00:03:52.020> it's<00:03:52.440> not<00:03:52.560> tracking<00:03:52.860> as<00:03:53.100> well

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
because maybe it's not tracking as well

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:54.830 
because maybe it's not tracking as well
as<00:03:53.400> they'd<00:03:53.550> like<00:03:53.819> you<00:03:54.180> know<00:03:54.270> playing<00:03:54.600> it<00:03:54.720> close

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
as they'd like you know playing it close

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.720 
as they'd like you know playing it close
to<00:03:55.080> the<00:03:55.170> best<00:03:55.380> hasn't<00:03:55.770> been<00:03:55.860> working<00:03:56.069> so

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
to the best hasn't been working so

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:57.890 
to the best hasn't been working so
they're<00:03:56.940> like<00:03:57.120> you<00:03:57.270> know<00:03:57.360> we<00:03:57.480> have<00:03:57.690> these

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
they're like you know we have these

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.809 
they're like you know we have these
shots<00:03:58.230> we<00:03:58.500> have<00:03:58.650> this<00:03:58.860> cool<00:03:59.069> action<00:03:59.280> stuff<00:03:59.640> I

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 
shots we have this cool action stuff I

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:01.490 
shots we have this cool action stuff I
think<00:04:00.060> we<00:04:00.330> need<00:04:00.480> to<00:04:00.569> show<00:04:00.750> it<00:04:00.900> to<00:04:00.990> people<00:04:01.319> or

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
think we need to show it to people or

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:02.300 
think we need to show it to people or
we're<00:04:01.620> not<00:04:01.680> going<00:04:01.830> to<00:04:01.890> get<00:04:02.040> them<00:04:02.160> in<00:04:02.250> the

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
we're not going to get them in the

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.550 
we're not going to get them in the
theaters<00:04:02.640> that<00:04:03.630> could<00:04:03.840> be<00:04:03.959> the<00:04:04.110> second<00:04:04.440> reason

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
theaters that could be the second reason

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.220 
theaters that could be the second reason
the<00:04:04.830> third<00:04:05.040> reason<00:04:05.430> is<00:04:05.900> based<00:04:06.900> on<00:04:07.140> what

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
the third reason is based on what

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:08.690 
the third reason is based on what
happens<00:04:07.500> JOHN<00:04:07.680> CARTER<00:04:07.709> it's<00:04:08.220> a<00:04:08.340> similar<00:04:08.640> thing
