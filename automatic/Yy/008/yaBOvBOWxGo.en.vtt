00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.819
 very good this is a protest video 

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:06.950
 of protest because I'm seeing quite 

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:08.299
 in the forums that the 101 c the day after 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.700
 that do not enter loss that is very bad 

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:12.830
 model first thing is that this is a 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.230
 beta the seconds that the flight model 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.900
 it's still not definitive and I'm still going to 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.460
 prove as if it stalls and 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.650
 also makes a bit and a bit 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.120
 flat you can recover all this now 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.460
 well before the loss does not stop 

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.570
 notify attention to the neighborhood that is going to 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.120
 start to fall I'm pulling to the 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.650
 lever back 10 centered just me 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.380
 takes to the left foot is not a vessel 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.960
 normal you see how is working the barium 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.810
 here 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.070
 but the plane does not stabilize because it is 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:44.980
 symmetrical has no lateral forces 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.980
 but if he mieux topear and threw him back 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:52.219
 this is already cut by the way 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.870
 this is a normal auger is going to 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:55.190
 stabilize the noses and lower a moment 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.140
 in when the horizon stabilizes 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.670
 will be a point on the center 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.250
 ailerons already left the foot tucked 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.199
 you see where the horizon portal is worth 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.580
 Well now I'm going to turn into a bit 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.060
 flat 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.690
 back and to not the contrary 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:15.020
 over you touch me 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.670
 the nose rises a little 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.259
 and now I'm in a flat spin 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.149
 completely to get the first 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:23.020
 neutral and the opposite 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:25.979
 CalderÃ³n in favor 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.979
 and 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:33.210
 could also cut the turtles we have 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:36.590
 reduced is a normal time spoiler 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.590
 neutral I keep the foot 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:41.570
 and in about 23 laps two and a half 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:46.090
 three doors are now red 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.090
 forward the center feet I come back from seaweed 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.270
 and it is already in the auger 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.830
 it was not that difficult just to try a 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.660
 little bit 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.620
 Well, it's man but keep things 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:59.480
 before saying it out there because people 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.370
 they take things seriously they start to 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:04.070
 get mad at what is wrong and came 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:06.470
 well testing question man will 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.840
 do another maneuver or go to the vertical 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.870
 it is very difficult to do it in a slip 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.770
 of corals that the tail back 

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:15.320
 then the first thing has to be the 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.120
 level planes and is that this vertical 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:20.570
 nothing from one wing more up or more 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:25.570
 down or more vertical than less to see if 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:25.570
 they leave me here and here it seems that yes 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.930
 it's also vibrating I'm falling 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.930
 backwards if now I touched pedal 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.450
 the age 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.420
 and it's gone and that's it 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.080
 and then another curiosity is that I 'm going to 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.620
 put in inverted 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.620
 one 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:59.650
 4 5 6 7 8 no 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:15.880
 11 12 13 14 15 attention to a power 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:21.670
 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 follow the i's 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:24.100
 negative 24 25 26 27 and the engine has 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:27.390
 off because he's kept it almost 30 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:31.360
 seconds with negative genes 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:33.010
 fast start and I take advantage now that 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.590
 you see that I am playing horizontally and 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:38.050
 the artificial horizon is not that 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.060
 this depends on a system called tar 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:42.100
 zinc that are a horizontal gyroscope and 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.380
 another vertical on which several depend 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.730
 instruments and are decentralized to do 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.890
 violent seniors like the ones I just 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:52.290
 but for that we have the option of 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:54.360
 free us to give you this little button 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.130
 and focuses 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.920
 the artificial horizon alone this is 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:01.740
 flame fast direction difficult day 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:04.650
 one more detail and I will not tire one more 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:07.110
 still in this fantastic skin of 25 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.750
 anniversary of the eagle patrol this 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:12.630
 pega has here the champions 2010 is 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.310
 the patrol gave it away in reality 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.990
 acrobatic Dutch because in that year 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.970
 precisely the Spanish national team 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:21.299
 football won the Dutch national team 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:23.190
 in the world championship of South Africa 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:24.870
 therefore it ends up like the Dutch 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.940
 it had the sticker made by itself 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.930
 They won and lost because they are the 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.850
 gave to the Spanish when 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:33.150
 they agreed with them very 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:35.580
 kindly another little detail more we go 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.500
 It is also not a matter of saying that they are 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:40.050
 books things that we think but 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.820
 it turns out that we are not sure before 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.110
 nothing as they assured man we look at the 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.480
 manual that there are many things that in the 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.610
 original manual of the plane it is good 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.870
 defined that the real plane is from 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.730
 a certain way that does not have 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.410
 what to be like other planes that we think 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:54.120
 we have tested it before each plane 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:55.800
 it's a point man because nothing man that 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.930
 enjoy it because the truth is that it is 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.539
 a big plane works almost everything 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:01.860
 even being a beta and when it is no longer 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:05.300
 beta 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.300
 imagine what we are going to have
