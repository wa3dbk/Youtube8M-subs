00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.769
 I wanted to tell the guys that for the 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.840

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.500
 Well, you can do something pretty 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.359
 entertaining pretty funny and very very 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.460
 crazy so good I wanted to tell you that 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.020
 that at night we have a video that is 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.000
 related to this we will like 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.829
 very much so good if you like the 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.079
 mod and those things you can give like for 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.300
 see what else we have and we go there good 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.129
 if we give efe 4 and at the end massa 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.239
 player we can wear the skin that we 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.129
 please, for example, we can get 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.170
 to maikel will also change us let's say in 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.899
 the house or we are now maiker but 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.289
 with a very rare thing bets already 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.059
 hands of doctors have a shirt 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.309
 normal and running a shirt by 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.920
 inside police with the belt and everything 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.300
 and then a good wrestling mask 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.580
 well, we have a lot of 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.920
 very long section 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:10.220
 animals I can be a cat for example 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.810
 we can be a crow we can be 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.890
 many things but to have 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.410
 very much careful because as you 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:19.220
 turn into an animal that suddenly 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:20.780
 you die so if you know what happened to you 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.560
 it becomes more so for example and we 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:26.000
 we put this is a being was still a fish 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.950
 it was a shark then you die 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.720
 we have a lot a very selection 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.940
 long for example someone we can be 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.650
 a clean with shoes and my mother 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.470
 this something that is very rare, well, what 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.270
 I say we have many types of 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.610
 everything absolutely everything we have here 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.170
 a very, very, very long selection we 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.750
 I'm putting at random to see the people 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:48.560
 that there is like being a piglet we can be 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.810
 a rat we can be a puppy 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.670
 be your mother I can be good at 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.920
 a mission we can write but here 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.140
 we can be forever or I do not know from 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.250
 that you run over a good car we're going to 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.170
 see what else has this we can 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.180
 strive to the place where you give us the 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.670
 win for example to the military base we go 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.460
 to see the easy one is that I am who I am 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.679
 a puppy that does not vote for me, mother of mine 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:13.010
 I think he has his days numbered 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:16.129
 or loans to those who can raise 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.079
 here on the military base my mother already 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:22.040
 I imagine the title and runs runs with 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:25.310
 the one who runs him runs his open run 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.920
 enter mother letter snow to the dog 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.829
 the dog being here you go astro 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:34.819
 I wanted to die guys remember me as a 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:37.159
 hero ignites this does not accelerate since 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:38.659
 has caught the dog we are seeing the 

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:40.239
 wings to the dog but you do not know my mother 

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:43.909
 you have to get out of here fast fast chop 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:46.120
 come down from here not good you've seen me 

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:49.159
 I can put any animal any 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.419
 skin I can be that it wants us not 

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:51.700
 that's nothing new to see what else 

00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:53.530
 we have around here we can also 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.239
 teleport as we have said 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.730
 this I do not know what is good for 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:00.769
 restore the skin and so it does not follow 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.389
 the police to get you up 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:04.669
 little stars of the police or directly 

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:07.189
 so that it does not persecute you there is always 

00:03:04.669 --> 00:03:09.049
 to be invincible I had now the 

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:12.829
 police skills you have them 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:15.050
 maximum and its super speed running or 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:17.630
 you will see how he runs now 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.730
 super jump has a lot of things very 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.440
 fun and you know that this 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.330
 well there's nothing new let's see what 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.600
 more has how to have all the weapons that 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.920
 we want for example the extinguisher that is 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.250
 one thing that I've always liked 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.900
 let's go we 're in losing too 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.880
 we can recharge that the souls have 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.250
 fire that explode we select a weapon 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.540
 is for example this one and we can 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.180
 shoot where we want and 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.430
 exploit absolutely all this for 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.990
 the missions is the cane said my mother 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.820
 now we are a superhero we can 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:48.710
 wait directly for the car you give us 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:50.360
 the win for example let's get the 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:51.800
 bump that is the golden car has 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.870
 disappeared who was there if in the 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.280
 half we can skid and make sad 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.740
 indirectly not look for the car but 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.390
 we already have it we can go skidding and 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:01.160
 do what absolutely the 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.600
 wins but only that but we can 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.330
 paint it the random car or be 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:07.070
 we can make a painting always 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.270
 striking but we can put the car 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:09.680
 that we want the color that gives us 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:11.990
 the win this is super cool has 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.640
 It's true that this is the first time I do this or 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:15.110
 be that I'm like I'm a hacker 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.239

 they will lower me well if they can 

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:07.969
 go down because I do not have a belt 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:10.519

00:05:10.519 --> 00:05:15.079
 the the lunar gravity without wanting 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:16.909

 guys so I like more to me more 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:53.029
 that nothing is super speed and a 

00:05:51.619 --> 00:05:55.249
 thing that I have not taught all of 

00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:56.990
 stop losing the law now it's worth guys 

00:05:55.249 --> 00:05:58.839
 Well, what I was reserving for 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:00.800
 the end is what I like the most 

00:05:58.839 --> 00:06:03.319
 this 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:06.279
 super missiles everywhere looks comes 

00:06:03.319 --> 00:06:06.279
 look at the less difficult missiles 

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:20.800
 but let's go well let's give it more cane 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:23.740
 so that it looks good we go and we can 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:26.260
 do we are going to try to shoot in the 

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:28.420
 I go to see if my mother I stay here 

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.950

 try to shoot but here you can 

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:33.780
 shoot and as you see this is the best 

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:36.009
 of all god 

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:37.900
 I do not even hear my own voice 

00:06:36.009 --> 00:06:40.110
 when I'm commenting on this 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:44.790
 look look look 

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:46.500
 and all good guys, this is what 

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:49.620
 is the new more menu let's say the first 

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:51.870
 menu that goes out for gta for pc and let's say 

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:53.760
 which is little compared to everything that 

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:56.760
 they're going to take everything they're going to put 

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:59.070
 with everything they are going to gut and go to 

00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:00.510
 add with the mobiles we can do what 

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:03.000
 that we want we can be 

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:04.710
 ironman flying through the heavens and 

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.960
 it's not like you can see it and be able to search 

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:08.280
 on youtube there are videos like that 

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:10.290
 you can do what you want there is no 

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:12.150
 people to 5 in gta 4 I say at the end you can 

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:13.860
 finish adding it and you can do 

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:15.780
 many things as I say we can 

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:18.750
 do what he gives us the real wins and 

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:20.850
 we can continue walking from home in 

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:22.920
 jumping house as you are seeing I know that 

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:26.040
 it is little I know that the menu is little but 

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:28.890
 good things will come better and say 

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:31.470
 that as I said for the night there 

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:34.200
 a very special video related to
