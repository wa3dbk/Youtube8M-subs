00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.310
 Come on 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.390
 hello and welcome derek 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.360
 youtube art today i want you guys 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.450
 show you how colors affect us 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.520
 just for us as a consideration and how 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:57.660
 he as an artist of course over 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.920
 can bring your meaningfulness so because 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.900
 every color has its own 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:05.880
 character own brightness and also 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:09.020
 different relationships to each other 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.670
 for example if your saturation is so 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.080
 In addition , three points have the 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.860
 important are the saturation of the 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:20.490
 color and, of course, the contrast 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:23.880
 for example when we take a color 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.130
 where the saturation is absent one and creates 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.320
 colorful color so speak white black 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.509
 or gray if you just yours now 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.229
 color from behaving like, for example, red 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:37.259
 So you have the highest saturation 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:40.740
 yes I want you different now 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.600
 Associations then express the 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.680
 different meanings and on the 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.820
 effect to the viewer so you can 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.330
 so aware 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:54.680
 your meaning of the picture or what 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:57.450
 expressing her far- consciously 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.420
 and maybe you should take picture on yours 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.970
 own meaning 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:05.729
 yes, here you see a table 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.650
 makes you the best also as a before 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.079
 he paints at the beginning 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.820
 although inter and always see and that 

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:13.760
 Then you also realize the meaning 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:17.340
 becomes 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.380
 First , I have the color red everyone 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.560
 knows, of course, the word for love is 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.840
 or for warmth both can do it too 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.549
 the opposite, therefore, are considered sick or 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.989
 blood if you like more 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:33.420
 then draw aggressive image 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:36.900
 you have to use in bright red with 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:39.570
 yes, the effect of the color is red 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.970
 is as already said during or 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:45.300
 Being aggressive can also be stimulating 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:48.360
 act the next 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:52.380
 orange, it is almost in a mixture of yellow 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:56.190
 and bread is also advertising 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:59.550
 It is a warm color you can have fun 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:03.000
 Happy expressions and also the picture 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:05.670
 make it lively yes that act here 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.610
 just living or building hours 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:14.460
 So yes, yes, the color is yellow 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:16.430
 stands for success or haifa if you go to 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:19.860
 For example, a sunflower has this 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:22.680
 bright yellow so that's enough you can 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.450
 Also a donkey bridge build so times 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.940
 The effect of money is, of course, supposed 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:31.770
 like friendly and also 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:33.840
 optimistic so the color green must 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:37.100
 Everybody knows how to hope 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:40.350
 both stand or relax 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:43.680
 she is very reassuringly refreshing 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:47.540
 just because of the atom because of it 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:50.130
 of course , nature knows a lot of green 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:53.690
 that just looks fresh in the moment 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:58.200
 summer when the trees are complete 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:04:04.320
 are green just gets very happy fresh 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:05.030
 and just relaxing in the color 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.920
 blue 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:10.410
 What can be so ensures in all cases only 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:13.620
 times cold it is always with water or 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:15.780
 It can be associated with ice 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:20.070
 Infinity stand and also for 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:23.460
 freshness so the effect of blue as grad 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:27.150
 already said cows cold but can also 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:29.820
 solve and relax the so act 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:33.030
 next woman would be violet that 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:36.120
 actually on strange mixture of red 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:41.790
 and blue violet is such an art 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:43.340
 more for the mystic for magic and that 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:46.340
 case box overseer magical and 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.340
 balanced 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:59.529
 then we just have those from the pink red 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:02.099
 and white mixed together quite simple 

00:04:59.529 --> 00:05:05.080
 Mixture therefore also stands for love 

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:07.229
 tenderness or delicacy and of course 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.499
 You will also find a lot in the trade 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:12.069
 could 

00:05:08.499 --> 00:05:14.289
 we need time there was also a lot 

00:05:12.069 --> 00:05:17.219
 Pink is also used in film 

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:20.650
 or generally on picture and very much 

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:22.839
 old-fashioned yet too and just that 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:26.529
 last bust or so in the usa tours 

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:33.069
 are very tender it was fresh and 

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:36.370
 just lovely then two more colorful 

00:05:33.069 --> 00:05:38.259
 colors as white speaks 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:43.060
 mainly for purity wisdom or 

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:46.029
 innocence and black next to it for mourning 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:48.039
 and hopelessness and that's how it works 

00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:51.240
 then of course a picture to the storm 

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:58.839
 then it is also very cloudy 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:06:00.909
 keep sad and depressed so if you 

00:05:58.839 --> 00:06:02.020
 you have made this table can 

00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:04.469
 you actually with the 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:07.300
 almost get started 

00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:09.339
 look for a motive consider yourself 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:12.370
 the motive in which we wanted to set the wheel 

00:06:09.339 --> 00:06:17.259
 For example, I once paper that 

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:21.159
 example with magister and once in 

00:06:17.259 --> 00:06:24.279
 Toni long you see her already 

00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:26.949
 it's going to be very low compared to down here 

00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:30.729
 I like it like another 

00:06:26.949 --> 00:06:35.009
 world would be and the blue works just like 

00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:40.360
 Nyse at after pretty cold the moon 

00:06:35.009 --> 00:06:42.550
 ascending and yes so that could be 

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:45.069
 do that as well 

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:46.210
 For example, a picture and try that one 

00:06:45.069 --> 00:06:46.950
 different colors then that 

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:52.440
 on each other 

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:54.740
 but then again here once 

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:57.600
 with red and one of the still in green 

00:06:54.740 --> 00:07:02.660
 So here he blogs the sunset 

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:02.660
 Save a lot on the way up 

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:08.700
 soothing as well as the green 

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:10.170
 and the greener is also more because 

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:14.420
 her shades of blue are also more in 

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:18.650
 this direction but also very 

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:22.230
 hopeful and calm 

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:24.780
 yes if such total makes us easy times 

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:25.680
 such a picture in four different 

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:27.690
 specializations 

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:30.330
 i think i just do the best exercise 

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:32.310
 look at times as I take the picture 

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:34.590
 myself was I drawn and have 

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:36.300
 showed equally expensive parents like the one 

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:38.370
 record and then examined as easy times 

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:41.010
 a picture and this then seeks that 

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:42.620
 somehow takes with the colors 

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:45.630
 show 

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:48.330
 if you have the two in question 

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:49.500
 or suggestions or me 

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:51.600
 maybe also send examples 

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:54.150
 then wanted to my now below 

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:55.620
 e-mail adresses under 

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:58.920
 problems and next time you 

00:07:55.620 --> 00:08:01.310
 again the theory was yesterday practice 

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:01.310
 is today
