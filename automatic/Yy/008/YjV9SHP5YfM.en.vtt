00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:21.929 
good it takes that VCR kind of imagery
out<00:02:18.310> because<00:02:19.310> VCRs<00:02:19.790> are<00:02:19.879> black<00:02:20.180> not<00:02:20.810> white<00:02:20.889> so

00:02:21.929 --> 00:02:21.939 
out because VCRs are black not white so

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:25.270 
out because VCRs are black not white so
you<00:02:22.939> getting<00:02:23.599> again<00:02:24.019> like<00:02:24.170> a<00:02:24.200> white<00:02:24.469> xbox<00:02:24.980> one
