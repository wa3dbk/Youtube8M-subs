00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:00.130 
fact that my car cost ten thousand

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:01.680 
fact that my car cost ten thousand
dollars<00:01:00.340> more<00:01:00.490> than<00:01:00.670> his<00:01:00.850> which<00:01:01.120> roughly<00:01:01.420> it

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:01.690 
dollars more than his which roughly it

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.049 
dollars more than his which roughly it
does<00:01:01.900> as<00:01:02.110> tested<00:01:02.650> but<00:01:03.010> here's<00:01:03.190> the<00:01:03.250> thing<00:01:03.400> mine

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
does as tested but here's the thing mine

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.680 
does as tested but here's the thing mine
puts<00:01:04.360> out<00:01:04.860> 412<00:01:05.860> horsepower<00:01:06.360> alright<00:01:07.360> so<00:01:07.510> mine

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:07.690 
puts out 412 horsepower alright so mine

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.080 
puts out 412 horsepower alright so mine
puts<00:01:07.900> out<00:01:08.020> 305<00:01:08.860> but<00:01:09.430> the<00:01:09.520> question<00:01:09.850> of<00:01:09.910> course

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
puts out 305 but the question of course

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.210 
puts out 305 but the question of course
is<00:01:10.360> is<00:01:10.600> it<00:01:11.110> worth<00:01:11.140> it<00:01:11.440> there's<00:01:11.680> only<00:01:11.770> one<00:01:12.070> way

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220 
is is it worth it there's only one way

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.770 
is is it worth it there's only one way
to<00:01:12.280> find<00:01:12.550> out<00:01:12.760> and<00:01:12.820> that's<00:01:13.030> to<00:01:13.180> mash<00:01:13.450> them<00:01:13.630> up

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
to find out and that's to mash them up

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.719 
to find out and that's to mash them up
we're<00:01:14.050> going<00:01:14.140> to<00:01:14.200> do<00:01:14.320> a<00:01:14.350> zero<00:01:14.710> to<00:01:14.890> 60<00:01:15.280> run<00:01:15.490> at

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729 
we're going to do a zero to 60 run at

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:17.520 
we're going to do a zero to 60 run at
high<00:01:16.030> altitude<00:01:16.570> in<00:01:16.750> real-world<00:01:16.960> conditions

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
high altitude in real-world conditions

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.760 
high altitude in real-world conditions
with<00:01:18.340> this<00:01:18.520> baby<00:01:18.760> and<00:01:19.690> with<00:01:19.900> this<00:01:20.020> baby<00:01:20.290> to

with this baby and with this baby to

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:30.640 
with this baby and with this baby to
find<00:01:21.040> out<00:01:21.250> what<00:01:21.610> 10k<00:01:22.060> gets<00:01:22.270> you<00:01:22.420> or<00:01:22.630> doesn't

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:32.980 

all<00:01:31.400> right<00:01:31.490> Nathan<00:01:31.670> obviously<00:01:32.540> the

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
all right Nathan obviously the

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.780 
all right Nathan obviously the
six-cylinder<00:01:33.740> is<00:01:33.920> going<00:01:34.220> to<00:01:34.280> be<00:01:34.340> slower<00:01:34.550> than

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
six-cylinder is going to be slower than

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.510 
six-cylinder is going to be slower than
your<00:01:35.060> GT<00:01:35.660> there's<00:01:36.050> no<00:01:36.200> doubt<00:01:36.380> yeah<00:01:37.100> but<00:01:37.400> you

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
your GT there's no doubt yeah but you

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:38.500 
your GT there's no doubt yeah but you
know<00:01:37.610> here's<00:01:37.850> the<00:01:37.940> interesting<00:01:38.180> thing<00:01:38.480> about

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:38.510 
know here's the interesting thing about

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.330 
know here's the interesting thing about
the<00:01:38.780> six-cylinder<00:01:39.410> guys<00:01:39.920> have<00:01:40.130> been<00:01:40.220> getting

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
the six-cylinder guys have been getting

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.980 
the six-cylinder guys have been getting
better<00:01:40.670> than<00:01:40.940> 0<00:01:41.120> to<00:01:41.210> 60<00:01:41.510> times<00:01:41.720> with<00:01:41.900> the

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
better than 0 to 60 times with the

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.170 
better than 0 to 60 times with the
automatic<00:01:42.170> which<00:01:42.590> this<00:01:42.740> one<00:01:42.920> has<00:01:43.160> versus<00:01:44.060> the

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
automatic which this one has versus the

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.620 
automatic which this one has versus the
manual<00:01:44.630> so<00:01:44.870> it<00:01:45.110> might<00:01:45.290> not<00:01:45.410> be<00:01:45.470> too<00:01:45.740> bad<00:01:46.630> my

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
manual so it might not be too bad my

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
manual so it might not be too bad my
question<00:01:48.230> is<00:01:48.970> how<00:01:49.970> much<00:01:50.180> per<00:01:50.750> second<00:01:51.290> are<00:01:51.500> you

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:51.650 
question is how much per second are you

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.610 
question is how much per second are you
paying<00:01:52.100> in<00:01:52.480> speed<00:01:53.480> in<00:01:53.750> other<00:01:53.930> words<00:01:54.140> if<00:01:54.410> this

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:54.620 
paying in speed in other words if this

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.980 
paying in speed in other words if this
car<00:01:54.860> is<00:01:55.040> two<00:01:55.370> seconds<00:01:55.940> slower<00:01:56.240> than<00:01:56.420> your<00:01:56.780> car

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
car is two seconds slower than your car

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.780 
car is two seconds slower than your car
that<00:01:57.290> means<00:01:57.470> you're<00:01:57.560> paying<00:01:57.830> five<00:01:58.190> thousand

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
that means you're paying five thousand

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.630 
that means you're paying five thousand
dollars<00:01:59.090> more<00:01:59.330> per<00:01:59.390> second<00:02:00.140> to<00:02:00.380> get<00:02:00.560> a<00:02:00.770> faster

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
dollars more per second to get a faster

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.850 
dollars more per second to get a faster
split<00:02:01.910> possibly<00:02:02.810> possibly<00:02:02.990> I<00:02:03.410> want<00:02:03.710> to<00:02:03.770> look

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
split possibly possibly I want to look

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:04.960 
split possibly possibly I want to look
at<00:02:03.950> it<00:02:04.040> or<00:02:04.190> the<00:02:04.280> other<00:02:04.400> way<00:02:04.520> to<00:02:04.580> look<00:02:04.729> at<00:02:04.820> it<00:02:04.880> is
