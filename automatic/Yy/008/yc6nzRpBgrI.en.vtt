hi<00:00:01.230> I'm<00:00:01.469> Nico<00:00:01.650> Rosberg<00:00:01.890> hi<00:00:02.610> I'm<00:00:02.909> Lewis

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
hi I'm Nico Rosberg hi I'm Lewis

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.210 
hi I'm Nico Rosberg hi I'm Lewis
Hamilton<00:00:03.600> it's<00:00:03.959> time<00:00:04.140> to<00:00:04.290> get<00:00:04.380> street<00:00:04.650> smart

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:07.220 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.009 

see<00:00:08.220> that<00:00:08.370> lambda<00:00:08.610> would<00:00:08.910> be<00:00:09.059> that<00:00:09.240> far<00:00:09.480> in

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
see that lambda would be that far in

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.299 
see that lambda would be that far in
front<00:00:10.170> yeah<00:00:10.679> it's<00:00:10.950> awesome

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
front yeah it's awesome

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.600 
front yeah it's awesome
oh<00:00:11.490> that's<00:00:12.210> the<00:00:12.360> case<00:00:12.540> yeah<00:00:13.219> good<00:00:14.219> chance<00:00:14.429> for

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
oh that's the case yeah good chance for

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.550 
oh that's the case yeah good chance for
tomorrow<00:00:14.790> yeah<00:00:15.509> definitely

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:18.560 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:28.509 

jeez<00:00:19.560> that<00:00:19.949> was<00:00:20.340> an<00:00:20.520> unsafe<00:00:21.029> release<00:00:21.330> there

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:28.519 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:31.310 

unsafe<00:00:29.519> release<00:00:29.730> that's<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:30.869> difficult

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
unsafe release that's a difficult

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.560 
unsafe release that's a difficult
question<00:00:31.439> in<00:00:31.769> that<00:00:31.890> situation<00:00:32.550> but<00:00:33.090> on<00:00:33.210> track

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
question in that situation but on track

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.690 
question in that situation but on track
there<00:00:33.930> were<00:00:34.020> far<00:00:34.290> more<00:00:34.320> clear<00:00:34.860> indicators<00:00:35.489> as

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
there were far more clear indicators as

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.459 
there were far more clear indicators as
to<00:00:35.850> whether<00:00:36.090> a<00:00:36.360> car<00:00:36.780> has<00:00:36.960> been<00:00:37.140> released

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
to whether a car has been released

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.760 
to whether a car has been released
unsafely<00:00:38.250> an<00:00:38.850> unsafe<00:00:39.329> release<00:00:39.540> is<00:00:39.930> when

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
unsafely an unsafe release is when

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.229 
unsafely an unsafe release is when
during<00:00:41.340> a<00:00:41.550> pit<00:00:41.730> stop

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
during a pit stop

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.200 
during a pit stop
we've<00:00:42.930> signaled<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.440> release<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.890> car<00:00:44.100> but<00:00:45.090> at

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
we've signaled to release the car but at

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.180 
we've signaled to release the car but at
that<00:00:45.329> time<00:00:45.390> unfortunately<00:00:45.809> a<00:00:46.350> wheel<00:00:46.710> perhaps

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
that time unfortunately a wheel perhaps

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.549 
that time unfortunately a wheel perhaps
isn't<00:00:47.399> fully<00:00:47.730> completed<00:00:48.270> and<00:00:48.480> therefore<00:00:49.200> the

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
isn't fully completed and therefore the

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.260 
isn't fully completed and therefore the
car<00:00:49.770> isn't<00:00:49.980> in<00:00:50.190> a<00:00:50.280> safe<00:00:50.520> position<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:51.180> be

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
car isn't in a safe position to be

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.270 
car isn't in a safe position to be
driving<00:00:51.660> out<00:00:51.780> on<00:00:51.809> track<00:00:52.199> an<00:00:52.649> unsafe<00:00:53.070> release

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
driving out on track an unsafe release

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.069 
driving out on track an unsafe release
might<00:00:53.910> also<00:00:54.090> be<00:00:54.329> that<00:00:54.539> we've<00:00:54.660> released<00:00:54.809> the

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
might also be that we've released the

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.610 
might also be that we've released the
car<00:00:55.350> into<00:00:55.949> a<00:00:55.980> traffic<00:00:56.370> in<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.149> fast<00:00:57.390> lane<00:00:57.620> the

what it does mean though is that in the

he'll<00:01:29.320> press<00:01:29.560> a<00:01:29.590> button<00:01:29.860> to<00:01:30.130> indicate<00:01:30.280> that

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:43.659 
doing the actual pit stop itself but

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:45.359 
doing the actual pit stop itself but
also<00:01:43.810> the<00:01:44.020> guy<00:01:44.140> in<00:01:44.259> front<00:01:44.409> who<00:01:44.679> is<00:01:45.009> the<00:01:45.250> one

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:45.369 
also the guy in front who is the one

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:46.740 
also the guy in front who is the one
that<00:01:45.460> releases<00:01:45.880> you<00:01:45.939> into<00:01:46.149> the<00:01:46.240> pit<00:01:46.390> lane

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
that releases you into the pit lane

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.510 
that releases you into the pit lane
well<00:01:47.229> the<00:01:47.320> pit<00:01:47.439> stop<00:01:47.619> release<00:01:47.890> is<00:01:48.070> one<00:01:48.280> of<00:01:48.399> the

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
well the pit stop release is one of the

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.160 
well the pit stop release is one of the
most<00:01:48.789> crucial<00:01:49.000> phases<00:01:49.509> in<00:01:49.630> the<00:01:49.720> race<00:01:49.869> it's

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
most crucial phases in the race it's

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:51.620 
most crucial phases in the race it's
really<00:01:50.409> often<00:01:50.560> a<00:01:50.860> split-second<00:01:51.549> decision

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
really often a split-second decision

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.940 
really often a split-second decision
because<00:01:52.630> if<00:01:52.750> there<00:01:52.899> is<00:01:52.990> a<00:01:53.020> car<00:01:53.289> coming<00:01:53.320> he's

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
because if there is a car coming he's

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.260 
because if there is a car coming he's
not<00:01:54.159> allowed<00:01:54.369> to<00:01:54.399> release<00:01:54.700> me<00:01:54.909> and<00:01:54.970> we<00:01:55.060> have<00:01:55.179> to

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
not allowed to release me and we have to

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.059 
not allowed to release me and we have to
wait<00:01:55.450> until<00:01:55.869> the<00:01:55.929> car<00:01:56.110> goes<00:01:56.289> by<00:01:56.470> and<00:01:56.799> then<00:01:56.979> you

00:01:57.059 --> 00:01:57.069 
wait until the car goes by and then you

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:58.649 
wait until the car goes by and then you
can<00:01:57.220> release<00:01:57.340> them<00:01:57.610> and<00:01:57.880> of<00:01:58.030> course<00:01:58.299> if<00:01:58.479> you

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:58.659 
can release them and of course if you

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:01.710 
can release them and of course if you
release<00:01:59.319> done<00:01:59.500> safely<00:02:00.390> which<00:02:01.390> they<00:02:01.479> call<00:02:01.659> an

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
release done safely which they call an

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.230 
release done safely which they call an
unsafe<00:02:02.049> release<00:02:02.259> then<00:02:03.039> you<00:02:03.399> can<00:02:03.520> easily<00:02:03.939> get<00:02:04.209> a

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
unsafe release then you can easily get a

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:14.440 
unsafe release then you can easily get a
penalty

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.390

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
going into a road that you understand

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:29.869 
going into a road that you understand
the<00:02:25.500> dangers<00:02:25.920> of<00:02:27.260> not<00:02:28.260> only<00:02:28.530> in<00:02:28.769> doing<00:02:28.980> no<00:02:29.670> no

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879 
the dangers of not only in doing no no

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:31.610 
the dangers of not only in doing no no
everyone<00:02:30.810> can<00:02:31.019> forget

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
everyone can forget

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.379 
everyone can forget
look<00:02:31.920> that<00:02:32.579> would<00:02:32.700> have<00:02:32.790> been<00:02:32.939> an<00:02:33.030> unsafe

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:33.389 
look that would have been an unsafe

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:35.959 
look that would have been an unsafe
release<00:02:33.599> there
