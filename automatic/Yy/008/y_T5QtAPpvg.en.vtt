 his debut on the playstation 4 console 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.610
 of which among other things is exclusive after having 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.620
 suffered several delays 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.330
 initially in fact it was planned as 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.690
 new console launch title

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.500
 multiplayer compartment 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:50.530
 therefore it will rotate completely around the 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.570
 user reason why evolution studios 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.549
 has decided to release the title in two 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.400
 one free version and the other 

00:00:54.549 --> 00:01:00.040

 other users 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:20.080
 but can only boast of one place 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.580

 five places 55 tracks 50 cars and 50 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.310
 tour events is strange to say but a 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.770
 fundamental element of this racing 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.690
 game is cooperation 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.940
 in fact the title is based on the so-called 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.860
 clubs that are real 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.470
 teams of up to 6 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.840
 players obviously the competition there 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.909
 will be but will be among the different teams that 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.950
 will have to compete and win the 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:53.140
 competitions to increase one's own 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.270
 fame the latter will allow us to 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.040
 level up and bring our own 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.140
 glory club 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.300
 the password then the work of 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.460
 team all the gaming experience will be 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.010
 furthermore enhanced by the functions 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.259
 social playstation 4 and even ad 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.119
 some applications created specifically for the 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.220
 title we could always stay 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.860
 connected to the game even when we are 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.690
 away from our console but drive 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.790
 it will not only be online 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.430
 despite this being its peculiarity 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.980
 all rossi 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.540
 it has in fact declared itself recently 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.069
 through his twitter account i 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.370
 players will face the 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:30.480
 campaign mode even offline 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.700
 allowing those who do not like 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.799
 especially the multiplayer of 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.299
 still face the adventure 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:38.219
 it also appears that the flash drive 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:40.430
 will manage to involve all types of 

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:42.959
 users both simulation lovers 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.609
 that less accustomed to the genre 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:47.310
 the strength of the title will be 

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:49.260
 in fact the immediate life system but 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.420
 with some features that will satisfy 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:55.290
 fully the real racing and yen 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:58.500
 thanks it will have a resolution of 1080p but 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.209
 the framerate will remain 30 this choice has 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.280
 resulted in several controversies 3 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.900
 gamers gamers 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.150
 these kinds of games know 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:09.569
 perfectly that fluidity is a 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.709
 fundamental element therefore 60 fps are 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:12.780
 practically a must 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.909
 the development team said of 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.500
 having opted for a framerate system 

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:18.090
 different from the usual 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.239
 to be able to create settings 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.909
 breathtaking and cars characterized by a 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:26.280
 disproportionate number of details together 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:28.280
 to a highly lighting system 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.930
 also the tracks will be wanted 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:33.150
 reproduced in detail and will have 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:36.090
 a size never seen before in 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.069
 a racing game indeed some of these 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.620
 they will be completed in five minutes 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:42.930
 even using the fastest cars and 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.760
 It has recently been confirmed that 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.769
 within trex it will be present from 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.479
 microtransaction system 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:50.909
 this will allow players to 

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:53.069
 spend real money to acquire 

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:56.489
 fast cars and other contents 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:58.949
 unlockable otherwise only by going up 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:01.169
 of level and fame to conclude 

00:03:58.949 --> 00:04:03.540
 drive has the positive aspects that 

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:05.099
 they seem to promise really well but there 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.409
 are some things they still leave 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:09.689
 space for doubts such as system 

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:11.849
 of microtransactions and the choice of 

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:13.919
 maintain 30 fps 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:15.840
 Finally, we remind you that the drive club will do 

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:18.500
