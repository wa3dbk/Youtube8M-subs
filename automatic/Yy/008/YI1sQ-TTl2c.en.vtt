00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:53.500 
few years the atmosphere is wonderful I

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.529 
few years the atmosphere is wonderful I
don't<00:04:54.340> know<00:04:54.400> how<00:04:54.520> quite<00:04:54.760> we<00:04:54.909> do<00:04:55.060> that<00:04:55.270> with

00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:55.539 
don't know how quite we do that with

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:58.379 
don't know how quite we do that with
folding<00:04:56.259> tables<00:04:56.650> and<00:04:56.889> cement<00:04:57.220> floors<00:04:57.520> and<00:04:57.880> but

00:04:58.379 --> 00:04:58.389 
folding tables and cement floors and but

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:00.060 
folding tables and cement floors and but
it<00:04:58.630> just<00:04:58.810> is<00:04:59.020> because<00:04:59.470> the<00:04:59.590> people<00:04:59.889> is<00:05:00.039> what

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.070 
it just is because the people is what

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:02.219 
it just is because the people is what
makes<00:05:00.669> that<00:05:00.909> the<00:05:01.180> message<00:05:01.539> that<00:05:01.750> we<00:05:01.870> want<00:05:01.900> to

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:02.229 
makes that the message that we want to

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:04.230 
makes that the message that we want to
get<00:05:02.320> out<00:05:02.470> to<00:05:02.740> the<00:05:02.770> broad<00:05:03.009> population<00:05:03.550> is<00:05:03.909> to

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 
get out to the broad population is to

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.629 
get out to the broad population is to
remember<00:05:04.830> you<00:05:05.830> know<00:05:05.919> that<00:05:06.159> the<00:05:06.250> food<00:05:06.430> bank

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:06.639 
remember you know that the food bank

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:09.420 
remember you know that the food bank
serves<00:05:06.940> such<00:05:07.210> a<00:05:07.240> such<00:05:08.050> a<00:05:08.080> variety<00:05:08.320> of<00:05:08.710> need<00:05:09.159> and

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430 
serves such a such a variety of need and

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.730 
serves such a such a variety of need and
and<00:05:10.270> then<00:05:10.449> perhaps<00:05:10.690> I<00:05:10.930> think<00:05:11.139> as<00:05:11.320> it<00:05:11.500> grows

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:11.740 
and then perhaps I think as it grows

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.909 
and then perhaps I think as it grows
