got<00:02:08.759> odor<00:02:09.090> control<00:02:09.330> too<00:02:09.780> so<00:02:10.050> it<00:02:10.170> really<00:02:10.560> really

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
got odor control too so it really really

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.460 
got odor control too so it really really
makes<00:02:11.129> a<00:02:11.310> huge<00:02:11.340> difference<00:02:11.670> there<00:02:12.510> as<00:02:12.599> well

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
makes a huge difference there as well

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.520 
makes a huge difference there as well
it's<00:02:13.680> got<00:02:14.460> three<00:02:14.820> membranes<00:02:15.750> so<00:02:16.140> to<00:02:16.200> speak

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
it's got three membranes so to speak

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.200 
it's got three membranes so to speak
than<00:02:16.710> that<00:02:16.920> as<00:02:17.100> I<00:02:17.370> say<00:02:17.550> that<00:02:17.700> first<00:02:17.910> ones

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
than that as I say that first ones

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.910 
than that as I say that first ones
fleecy<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.740> middle<00:02:20.160> one<00:02:21.020> offers<00:02:22.020> one

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
fleecy the middle one offers one

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.670 
fleecy the middle one offers one
protection<00:02:23.700> and<00:02:23.850> the<00:02:24.330> outer<00:02:24.600> layer<00:02:25.020> is<00:02:25.290> for

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
protection and the outer layer is for

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.060 
protection and the outer layer is for
water<00:02:25.950> and<00:02:26.300> protection<00:02:27.300> it<00:02:28.200> is<00:02:28.260> a<00:02:28.470> fantastic

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
water and protection it is a fantastic

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.110 
water and protection it is a fantastic
top<00:02:29.700> as<00:02:29.970> I<00:02:30.030> say<00:02:30.420> it's<00:02:30.960> one<00:02:31.290> proof<00:02:31.590> 100%<00:02:32.520> and

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
top as I say it's one proof 100% and

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.480 
top as I say it's one proof 100% and
there's<00:02:33.990> nothing<00:02:34.620> else<00:02:34.770> on<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.070> market

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
there's nothing else on the market

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.760 
there's nothing else on the market
that's<00:02:35.640> like<00:02:35.910> this<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:36.870> climate<00:02:37.320> control

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
that's like this the climate control

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.710 
that's like this the climate control
where<00:02:38.130> this<00:02:38.370> comes<00:02:38.700> into<00:02:38.910> it<00:02:39.120> this<00:02:39.240> is<00:02:39.390> a<00:02:39.420> long

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
where this comes into it this is a long

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.750 
where this comes into it this is a long
sleeve<00:02:40.080> that<00:02:40.320> I<00:02:40.350> wear<00:02:40.590> all<00:02:40.800> long<00:02:41.100> sleeve<00:02:41.430> tops

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
sleeve that I wear all long sleeve tops

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.430 
sleeve that I wear all long sleeve tops
to<00:02:41.970> keep<00:02:42.120> the<00:02:42.270> Sun<00:02:42.480> off<00:02:42.510> my<00:02:42.840> arms<00:02:43.170> and<00:02:43.320> things

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
to keep the Sun off my arms and things

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.699 
to keep the Sun off my arms and things
because<00:02:43.860> their<00:02:44.130> son<00:02:45.120> has<00:02:45.330> puts<00:02:46.050> us<00:02:46.230> at<00:02:46.440> such

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
because their son has puts us at such

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.920 
because their son has puts us at such
risk<00:02:46.950> of<00:02:47.250> skin<00:02:47.850> cancers<00:02:48.420> and<00:02:48.540> things<00:02:48.750> like

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
risk of skin cancers and things like

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.230 
risk of skin cancers and things like
that<00:02:49.140> so<00:02:49.590> the<00:02:49.800> charts<00:02:50.280> can<00:02:50.490> gear<00:02:50.730> particular

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
that so the charts can gear particular

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.970 
that so the charts can gear particular
against<00:02:51.480> that<00:02:51.690> as<00:02:51.870> well<00:02:52.080> but<00:02:52.590> the<00:02:52.740> climate

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
against that as well but the climate

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.270 
against that as well but the climate
control<00:02:53.900> vision<00:02:54.900> of<00:02:55.020> the<00:02:55.170> tops<00:02:55.410> hazards<00:02:56.130> up

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
control vision of the tops hazards up

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.190 
control vision of the tops hazards up
enough<00:02:56.520> and<00:02:56.790> what<00:02:57.000> that<00:02:57.180> allows<00:02:57.480> you<00:02:57.690> to<00:02:57.810> do<00:02:57.990> is

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
enough and what that allows you to do is

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.790 
enough and what that allows you to do is
it<00:02:58.380> allows<00:02:58.709> you<00:02:59.100> to<00:02:59.130> open<00:03:00.170> that<00:03:01.170> zip<00:03:01.530> and<00:03:01.709> let

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
it allows you to open that zip and let

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.320 
it allows you to open that zip and let
the<00:03:01.920> heat<00:03:02.130> out<00:03:03.320> fantastic<00:03:04.320> top<00:03:05.160> love<00:03:06.000> it<00:03:06.180> for

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
the heat out fantastic top love it for

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.030 
the heat out fantastic top love it for
winter<00:03:06.690> I've<00:03:06.959> worn<00:03:07.290> it<00:03:07.410> and<00:03:07.620> some<00:03:07.830> of<00:03:07.950> the

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
that it has the original sharkskin

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.699 
that it has the original sharkskin
material<00:03:37.769> but<00:03:38.340> the<00:03:38.489> material<00:03:39.120> is<00:03:39.360> only<00:03:39.720> on

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:54.440 
the shoulders and the arms we find
compression<00:03:52.709> material<00:03:53.549> which<00:03:53.760> actually

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
compression material which actually

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.780 
compression material which actually
helps<00:03:54.900> when<00:03:55.140> you<00:03:55.260> are<00:03:55.290> a<00:03:55.440> peddler<00:03:55.890> or<00:03:56.400> doing

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
helps when you are a peddler or doing

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.270 
helps when you are a peddler or doing
physical<00:03:57.360> work<00:03:57.560> what<00:03:58.560> the<00:03:58.709> compression

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
physical work what the compression

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.000 
physical work what the compression
material<00:03:59.820> does<00:04:00.090> is<00:04:00.450> it<00:04:00.780> actually<00:04:01.590> increases

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
material does is it actually increases

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.880 
material does is it actually increases
blood<00:04:02.340> flow<00:04:02.459> through<00:04:03.420> you<00:04:03.690> your<00:04:04.290> veins<00:04:04.590> and

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
blood flow through you your veins and

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.580 
blood flow through you your veins and
your<00:04:05.040> arteries<00:04:05.580> and<00:04:05.880> that<00:04:06.209> brings<00:04:06.780> oxygen<00:04:07.440> to

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
your arteries and that brings oxygen to

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.759 
your arteries and that brings oxygen to
the<00:04:07.709> muscles<00:04:08.130> a<00:04:08.250> lot<00:04:08.400> quicker<00:04:08.670> and<00:04:09.090> in<00:04:09.840> turn<00:04:10.200> it

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
the muscles a lot quicker and in turn it

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:12.830 
the muscles a lot quicker and in turn it
helps<00:04:11.250> you<00:04:11.370> perform<00:04:11.549> better<00:04:11.970> hence<00:04:12.450> the<00:04:12.690> name

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
helps you perform better hence the name

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.380 
helps you perform better hence the name
performance<00:04:13.500> top<00:04:13.769> it's<00:04:14.459> a<00:04:14.580> great<00:04:14.790> top<00:04:15.090> and
