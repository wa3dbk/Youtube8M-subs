00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
emergency like this you could still

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.730 
emergency like this you could still
drive<00:01:44.970> does<00:01:45.329> somebody<00:01:45.540> Dodge<00:01:46.259> lover<00:01:46.560> was

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
drive does somebody Dodge lover was

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.210 
drive does somebody Dodge lover was
saying<00:01:46.950> that<00:01:47.130> I<00:01:47.159> can't<00:01:47.610> drive<00:01:47.790> now<00:01:48.030> I<00:01:49.220> actually

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
saying that I can't drive now I actually

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.530 
saying that I can't drive now I actually
I<00:01:50.369> could<00:01:50.490> still<00:01:50.670> do<00:01:50.759> it<00:01:50.790> if<00:01:50.970> I<00:01:51.030> use<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.329> clutch

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
I could still do it if I use the clutch

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.109 
I could still do it if I use the clutch
but<00:01:51.780> it's<00:01:52.439> easier<00:01:52.950> I<00:01:53.009> mean<00:01:53.250> it<00:01:53.520> less<00:01:54.090> painful

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
but it's easier I mean it less painful

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.450 
but it's easier I mean it less painful
and<00:01:54.720> more<00:01:55.110> and<00:01:55.320> more<00:01:55.710> convenient<00:01:56.070> without

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
and more and more convenient without

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.639 
and more and more convenient without
having<00:01:56.790> to<00:01:56.850> use<00:01:56.969> it<00:01:57.119> just<00:01:57.210> match<00:01:57.780> those<00:01:58.020> rpms

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
having to use it just match those rpms

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.080 
having to use it just match those rpms
up<00:01:58.920> you<00:01:59.040> know<00:01:59.159> I'm<00:01:59.280> sure<00:01:59.310> yeah<00:01:59.610> you<00:01:59.850> know<00:01:59.939> what

let's go in the car real quick so if you
look<00:02:10.560> right<00:02:10.709> here<00:02:10.860> on<00:02:10.920> your<00:02:11.099> dashboard<00:02:11.310> you

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
look right here on your dashboard you

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.640 
look right here on your dashboard you
have<00:02:12.030> your<00:02:12.180> RPM<00:02:12.720> gauge<00:02:12.989> yeah

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
have your RPM gauge yeah

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.420 
have your RPM gauge yeah
says<00:02:13.829> rpm<00:02:14.780> okay<00:02:15.780> times<00:02:16.379> 1000<00:02:17.069> which<00:02:17.189> means

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
says rpm okay times 1000 which means

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.280 
says rpm okay times 1000 which means
every<00:02:17.730> one<00:02:17.849> of<00:02:17.879> these<00:02:18.000> that's<00:02:18.180> 1,000<00:02:18.840> 2,000

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
every one of these that's 1,000 2,000

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.009 
every one of these that's 1,000 2,000
3,000<00:02:19.709> 4,000<00:02:20.159> 5,000<00:02:20.670> 6,000<00:02:21.150> 7,000<00:02:21.510> 8,000<00:02:21.959> you

3,000 4,000 5,000 6,000 7,000 8,000 you
get<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.260> point<00:02:22.470> it's<00:02:22.860> not<00:02:22.980> 1<00:02:23.459> 2<00:02:23.640> 3<00:02:23.819> it's<00:02:24.030> it's

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:24.329 
get the point it's not 1 2 3 it's it's

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:25.910 
get the point it's not 1 2 3 it's it's
about<00:02:24.689> a<00:02:24.900> thousand<00:02:25.439> on<00:02:25.500> the<00:02:25.590> end<00:02:25.709> of<00:02:25.799> each<00:02:25.890> of

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
about a thousand on the end of each of

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.250 
about a thousand on the end of each of
these<00:02:26.099> ok<00:02:26.489> so<00:02:26.549> we<00:02:26.909> got<00:02:27.000> that<00:02:27.180> down<00:02:27.360> now<00:02:27.629> what

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
these ok so we got that down now what

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.170 
these ok so we got that down now what
you're<00:02:28.409> gonna<00:02:28.500> do<00:02:28.709> is<00:02:28.890> when<00:02:29.430> you<00:02:29.610> start<00:02:30.060> up

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
you're gonna do is when you start up

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.280 
you're gonna do is when you start up
your<00:02:30.269> car<00:02:30.450> I'm<00:02:30.569> not<00:02:30.599> gonna<00:02:30.810> actually<00:02:30.959> drive

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
your car I'm not gonna actually drive

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.539 
your car I'm not gonna actually drive
right<00:02:31.439> now<00:02:31.500> I'm<00:02:31.650> just<00:02:31.769> gonna<00:02:31.859> explain<00:02:32.280> it<00:02:32.340> so

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:32.549 
right now I'm just gonna explain it so

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:33.770 
right now I'm just gonna explain it so
in<00:02:32.670> theory<00:02:32.909> maybe<00:02:33.090> another<00:02:33.299> time<00:02:33.510> we'll<00:02:33.659> do<00:02:33.750> a

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
in theory maybe another time we'll do a

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.509 
in theory maybe another time we'll do a
full<00:02:33.959> one<00:02:34.140> on<00:02:34.230> this<00:02:34.319> ready<00:02:34.560> you're<00:02:35.250> gonna<00:02:35.310> be

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
full one on this ready you're gonna be

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:38.149 
full one on this ready you're gonna be
driving<00:02:35.970> and<00:02:36.209> generally<00:02:36.930> if<00:02:37.170> you're<00:02:37.829> driving

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:38.159 
driving and generally if you're driving

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:40.399 
driving and generally if you're driving
just<00:02:38.609> slow<00:02:39.090> you<00:02:39.420> know<00:02:39.450> it's<00:02:40.079> gonna<00:02:40.230> be

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:40.409 
just slow you know it's gonna be

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:41.929 
just slow you know it's gonna be
anywhere<00:02:40.709> from<00:02:40.769> well<00:02:41.220> when<00:02:41.370> you're<00:02:41.489> idling<00:02:41.819> it

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:41.939 
anywhere from well when you're idling it

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:43.160 
anywhere from well when you're idling it
should<00:02:42.090> be<00:02:42.150> around<00:02:42.329> a<00:02:42.420> thousand<00:02:42.959> maybe<00:02:43.109> a

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
should be around a thousand maybe a

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.479 
should be around a thousand maybe a
little<00:02:43.290> lower<00:02:43.500> maybe<00:02:43.739> a<00:02:43.799> little<00:02:44.010> higher<00:02:44.159> and

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
little lower maybe a little higher and

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.369 
little lower maybe a little higher and
it's<00:02:45.209> when<00:02:45.599> you're<00:02:45.720> driving<00:02:45.900> it<00:02:46.170> could<00:02:46.290> be

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:46.379 
it's when you're driving it could be

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:51.170 
it's when you're driving it could be
anywhere<00:02:46.709> from<00:02:46.940> 1,500<00:02:47.940> to<00:02:48.379> probably<00:02:49.879> 2500<00:02:50.879> you

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
anywhere from 1,500 to probably 2500 you

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.369 
anywhere from 1,500 to probably 2500 you
know<00:02:51.299> if<00:02:51.510> you're<00:02:51.659> not<00:02:51.780> actually<00:02:51.989> really

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:52.379 
know if you're not actually really

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:54.649 
know if you're not actually really
accelerating<00:02:52.980> so<00:02:53.519> when<00:02:54.000> you're<00:02:54.150> like<00:02:54.299> that<00:02:54.510> as

00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:54.659 
accelerating so when you're like that as

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:56.420 
accelerating so when you're like that as
you<00:02:54.780> accelerate<00:02:55.079> your<00:02:55.560> rpm<00:02:55.889> gauge<00:02:56.099> is<00:02:56.280> gonna

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
you accelerate your rpm gauge is gonna

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.190 
you accelerate your rpm gauge is gonna
go<00:02:56.579> up<00:02:56.760> until<00:02:57.030> you<00:02:57.269> shift<00:02:57.569> all<00:02:57.840> the<00:02:57.900> way<00:02:57.989> to<00:02:58.049> the

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
go up until you shift all the way to the

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.920 
go up until you shift all the way to the
left<00:02:58.379> and<00:02:58.500> up<00:02:58.650> is<00:02:58.799> one<00:02:59.040> down<00:02:59.730> and<00:03:00.120> to<00:03:00.810> the<00:03:00.840> left

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
left and up is one down and to the left

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.369 
left and up is one down and to the left
is<00:03:01.230> to<00:03:01.500> middle<00:03:02.459> and<00:03:02.639> up<00:03:02.760> is<00:03:02.939> three<00:03:03.269> bottom<00:03:04.170> and

00:03:04.369 --> 00:03:04.379 
is to middle and up is three bottom and

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
hard you're accelerating you're going to

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.330 
hard you're accelerating you're going to
need<00:03:24.359> to<00:03:24.540> shift<00:03:24.780> up<00:03:25.319> which<00:03:25.949> means<00:03:26.190> you're

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
need to shift up which means you're

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
do that it's gonna bring rpms down and

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:32.629 
do that it's gonna bring rpms down and
where<00:03:31.620> ever<00:03:31.769> it's<00:03:31.919> gonna<00:03:32.040> bring<00:03:32.280> them<00:03:32.400> down<00:03:32.609> to

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:32.639 
where ever it's gonna bring them down to

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:34.490 
where ever it's gonna bring them down to
is<00:03:33.150> where<00:03:33.419> your<00:03:33.510> rpm<00:03:33.930> you<00:03:34.079> need<00:03:34.199> to<00:03:34.260> let<00:03:34.409> your

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
is where your rpm you need to let your

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.369 
is where your rpm you need to let your
rpms<00:03:34.889> drop<00:03:35.190> to<00:03:35.459> and<00:03:35.730> then<00:03:35.970> you<00:03:36.329> just<00:03:36.599> slide

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:37.379 
rpms drop to and then you just slide

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:39.020 
rpms drop to and then you just slide
right<00:03:37.409> in<00:03:37.739> there<00:03:37.889> if<00:03:38.069> your<00:03:38.220> rpms<00:03:38.609> have<00:03:38.760> dropped

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:40.349 
there and your speed is continuing this

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:41.990 
there and your speed is continuing this
is<00:03:40.500> very<00:03:40.680> confusing<00:03:41.040> the<00:03:41.220> explain<00:03:41.579> here<00:03:41.790> if

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
is very confusing the explain here if

you're going to downshift generally

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:44.780 
you're going to downshift generally
you'll<00:03:43.829> just<00:03:43.979> throw<00:03:44.129> this<00:03:44.250> into<00:03:44.430> neutral

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
you'll just throw this into neutral

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.129 
you'll just throw this into neutral
you're<00:03:44.970> gonna<00:03:45.120> be<00:03:45.299> just<00:03:45.449> rolling<00:03:45.840> along<00:03:45.959> and

you know downshift you're gonna tap the

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:49.189 
you know downshift you're gonna tap the
gas<00:03:47.819> it's<00:03:48.180> gonna<00:03:48.299> Rev<00:03:48.569> this<00:03:48.750> up<00:03:48.930> you're<00:03:49.139> gonna

Rev<00:03:49.440> your<00:03:49.560> engine<00:03:49.799> you<00:03:49.889> just<00:03:49.919> have<00:03:50.220> to<00:03:50.310> guess

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
Rev your engine you just have to guess

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:51.589 
Rev your engine you just have to guess
when<00:03:50.609> it's<00:03:50.760> in<00:03:50.819> neutral<00:03:50.940> it's<00:03:51.150> gonna<00:03:51.269> Rev<00:03:51.419> this

up and when it hits the point of
wherever<00:03:54.510> you're<00:03:54.720> gonna<00:03:54.840> dodge<00:03:54.959> if<00:03:55.109> you're

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:55.199 
wherever you're gonna dodge if you're

gonna downshift into third gear you know

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.490 
gonna downshift into third gear you know
it<00:03:56.970> may<00:03:57.120> need<00:03:57.269> to<00:03:57.419> be<00:03:57.599> a<00:03:57.629> little<00:03:57.989> bit<00:03:58.109> lower<00:03:58.290> if

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
it may need to be a little bit lower if

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:59.569 
it may need to be a little bit lower if
you're<00:03:58.590> gonna<00:03:58.680> dodge<00:03:58.859> up<00:03:59.010> to<00:03:59.099> the<00:03:59.190> second<00:03:59.519> gear

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
you're gonna dodge up to the second gear

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:00.830 
you're gonna dodge up to the second gear
from<00:03:59.790> going<00:03:59.940> faster<00:04:00.239> it's<00:04:00.389> gonna<00:04:00.510> need<00:04:00.690> to<00:04:00.750> be

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
from going faster it's gonna need to be

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.289 
from going faster it's gonna need to be
higher<00:04:01.109> because<00:04:01.319> whenever<00:04:02.159> you<00:04:02.310> let<00:04:02.609> push<00:04:03.150> the

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
higher because whenever you let push the

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:05.270 
higher because whenever you let push the
clutch<00:04:03.479> and<00:04:03.690> let<00:04:03.900> it<00:04:04.019> go<00:04:04.229> it's<00:04:04.769> gonna<00:04:04.919> Rev<00:04:05.159> your

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
clutch and let it go it's gonna Rev your

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.589 
clutch and let it go it's gonna Rev your
rpms<00:04:05.639> up<00:04:05.790> your<00:04:05.909> rpms<00:04:06.209> we're<00:04:06.299> gonna<00:04:06.389> hit<00:04:06.540> a

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:06.599 
rpms up your rpms we're gonna hit a

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:09.800 
rpms up your rpms we're gonna hit a
point<00:04:06.930> that's<00:04:07.079> the<00:04:07.319> point<00:04:07.440> where<00:04:08.250> your<00:04:08.909> RPMs

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
point that's the point where your RPMs

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.379 
point that's the point where your RPMs
need<00:04:09.959> to<00:04:10.079> be<00:04:10.260> at<00:04:10.699> when<00:04:11.699> you're<00:04:11.970> shifting

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:12.389 
need to be at when you're shifting

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:13.969 
need to be at when you're shifting
without<00:04:12.690> the<00:04:12.840> clutch<00:04:13.079> because<00:04:13.379> that's<00:04:13.590> where

00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:13.979 
without the clutch because that's where

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:15.740 
without the clutch because that's where
it<00:04:14.190> matches<00:04:14.370> up<00:04:14.579> and<00:04:15.000> it's<00:04:15.120> gonna<00:04:15.239> slide<00:04:15.540> right

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
it matches up and it's gonna slide right

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.449 
it matches up and it's gonna slide right
in<00:04:15.870> I<00:04:16.079> don't<00:04:16.199> know<00:04:16.380> if<00:04:16.440> any<00:04:16.739> of<00:04:16.889> that<00:04:17.010> made<00:04:17.190> any
