00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
minutes now usually if a turkey is not

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.990 
minutes now usually if a turkey is not
brined<00:00:34.110> it<00:00:34.500> will<00:00:34.620> burn<00:00:35.010> much<00:00:35.280> quicker<00:00:35.550> okay

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
brined it will burn much quicker okay

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.670 
brined it will burn much quicker okay
but<00:00:36.600> it's<00:00:36.719> been<00:00:36.899> brined<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:37.350> it<00:00:37.469> took<00:00:37.559> a

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
but it's been brined and it took a

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:38.750 
but it's been brined and it took a
little<00:00:37.800> longer<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.160> get<00:00:38.340> crispy<00:00:38.730> and

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
little longer to get crispy and

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.850 
little longer to get crispy and
beautiful<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.390> that's<00:00:39.540> some<00:00:40.170> minute<00:00:40.440> also

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
beautiful and that's some minute also

the one side is pointy to the end and

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.960 
the one side is pointy to the end and
then<00:02:04.290> it's<00:02:04.410> bigger<00:02:04.680> in<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.010> back<00:02:05.160> and<00:02:05.730> that's

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
then it's bigger in the back and that's

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:07.550
