one<00:01:53.040> you're<00:01:53.280> on<00:01:53.310> last<00:01:53.990> you<00:01:54.990> can<00:01:55.140> cycle<00:01:55.470> through

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
one you're on last you can cycle through

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.899 
one you're on last you can cycle through
them<00:01:55.740> they<00:01:55.920> do<00:01:55.979> different<00:01:56.399> things<00:01:56.430> they

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
them they do different things they

them they do different things they
strove<00:01:57.210> up<00:01:58.369> the<00:01:59.369> anime<00:02:01.969> they<00:02:02.969> do<00:02:03.030> really<00:02:03.540> fast

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
strove up the anime they do really fast

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:11.020 
strove up the anime they do really fast
blinks<00:02:05.149> it's<00:02:06.149> a<00:02:06.270> dim<00:02:06.509> couple<00:02:06.930> dim<00:02:07.200> ones

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.430 

hard<00:02:12.030> to<00:02:12.180> see<00:02:12.300> with<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.510> lights<00:02:12.690> off<00:02:12.870> but<00:02:13.200> you

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
hard to see with the lights off but you

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.009 
hard to see with the lights off but you
can<00:02:13.590> see<00:02:13.739> them<00:02:13.890> better<00:02:14.010> in<00:02:14.250> my<00:02:14.569> other<00:02:15.569> videos

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
can see them better in my other videos

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:17.479 
can see them better in my other videos
with<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.290> lights<00:02:16.530> when<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.099> lights<00:02:17.280> in<00:02:17.459> the

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
with the lights when the lights in the

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:22.490 
with the lights when the lights in the
room<00:02:17.580> are<00:02:17.940> off<00:02:20.629> and<00:02:21.629> it<00:02:21.810> just<00:02:21.989> does<00:02:22.170> different

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
room are off and it just does different

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.350 
room are off and it just does different
blinks<00:02:22.769> and<00:02:22.890> stuff<00:02:23.129> plus<00:02:23.819> and<00:02:24.030> minus<00:02:24.269> just

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
blinks and stuff plus and minus just

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.789 
blinks and stuff plus and minus just
goes<00:02:24.569> forward<00:02:24.930> or<00:02:25.049> backwards<00:02:25.409> through<00:02:25.590> them

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799 
goes forward or backwards through them

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:28.100 
goes forward or backwards through them
now<00:02:26.060> any<00:02:27.060> of<00:02:27.239> these<00:02:27.330> modes<00:02:27.599> that<00:02:27.720> are<00:02:27.810> blinking

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
now any of these modes that are blinking

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.839 
now any of these modes that are blinking
you<00:02:28.530> can<00:02:28.680> also<00:02:28.799> control<00:02:29.250> the<00:02:29.310> speed<00:02:29.640> of<00:02:29.819> the

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
you can also control the speed of the

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:32.690 
you can also control the speed of the
blink<00:02:30.150> or<00:02:31.040> any<00:02:32.040> of<00:02:32.220> them<00:02:32.340> like<00:02:32.519> for<00:02:32.640> example

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
blink or any of them like for example

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.270 
blink or any of them like for example
this<00:02:33.060> one<00:02:33.120> you<00:02:34.110> can<00:02:34.140> hit<00:02:34.379> speed<00:02:34.680> minus<00:02:35.099> or

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
this one you can hit speed minus or

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.750 
this one you can hit speed minus or
speed<00:02:35.730> plus<00:02:36.000> so<00:02:36.450> I<00:02:36.480> want<00:02:36.780> to<00:02:36.870> slow<00:02:37.110> it<00:02:37.260> down

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
speed plus so I want to slow it down

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.680 
speed plus so I want to slow it down
because<00:02:38.760> I<00:02:38.879> like<00:02:39.060> the<00:02:39.180> way<00:02:39.269> it<00:02:39.329> looks<00:02:39.360> better

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
because I like the way it looks better

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.720 
because I like the way it looks better
this<00:02:39.870> way<00:02:40.110> I<00:02:40.349> can<00:02:40.920> have<00:02:41.069> it<00:02:41.190> running<00:02:41.340> that<00:02:41.549> way

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
this way I can have it running that way

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.150 
this way I can have it running that way
if<00:02:42.450> you<00:02:42.540> want<00:02:42.750> to<00:02:42.840> speed<00:02:42.930> back<00:02:43.260> up<00:02:43.290> I<00:02:43.739> hit<00:02:43.860> plus

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
if you want to speed back up I hit plus

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.720 
if you want to speed back up I hit plus
and<00:02:44.989> it<00:02:45.989> starts<00:02:46.200> going<00:02:46.260> really<00:02:46.500> fast<00:02:46.769> all<00:02:47.220> of

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
and it starts going really fast all of

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.059 
and it starts going really fast all of
them<00:02:47.849> are<00:02:48.060> this<00:02:48.690> applies<00:02:49.019> to<00:02:49.349> so<00:02:49.620> i<00:02:49.680> can<00:02:49.920> take

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
them are this applies to so i can take

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.190 
them are this applies to so i can take
this<00:02:50.099> one<00:02:50.459> and<00:02:50.640> slow<00:02:51.450> it<00:02:51.480> down<00:02:51.660> so<00:02:51.989> it's<00:02:52.140> a

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
this one and slow it down so it's a

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.050 
this one and slow it down so it's a
really<00:02:52.379> slow<00:02:52.980> fade<00:02:53.549> so<00:02:53.790> you<00:02:53.849> don't<00:02:54.000> even

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
really slow fade so you don't even

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.750 
really slow fade so you don't even
notice<00:02:54.299> colors<00:02:54.810> changing<00:02:55.349> and<00:02:55.590> stuff<00:02:55.730> or<00:02:56.730> i

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
notice colors changing and stuff or i

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.309 
notice colors changing and stuff or i
can<00:02:56.849> speed<00:02:57.150> it<00:02:57.180> back<00:02:57.299> up<00:02:57.450> and<00:02:57.750> have<00:02:57.930> it<00:02:58.049> go<00:02:58.079> real

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
can speed it back up and have it go real

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:01.699 
can speed it back up and have it go real
fast<00:02:58.560> whatever<00:02:59.220> you<00:02:59.340> like<00:03:00.260> the<00:03:01.260> last<00:03:01.440> button

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
fast whatever you like the last button

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.319 
fast whatever you like the last button
on<00:03:01.859> this<00:03:01.950> remote<00:03:02.160> is<00:03:02.430> this<00:03:02.549> green<00:03:02.760> demo<00:03:03.030> button

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
on this remote is this green demo button

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:05.539 
on this remote is this green demo button
in<00:03:03.480> the<00:03:03.569> middle<00:03:03.690> here<00:03:03.989> what<00:03:04.739> demo<00:03:05.010> does<00:03:05.190> we<00:03:05.400> hit

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
in the middle here what demo does we hit

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:07.759 
in the middle here what demo does we hit
demo<00:03:05.879> it<00:03:06.720> just<00:03:07.109> starts<00:03:07.319> going<00:03:07.379> through<00:03:07.709> the

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
demo it just starts going through the

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:13.550 
demo it just starts going through the
different<00:03:08.099> modes<00:03:10.400> so<00:03:11.400> for<00:03:11.730> example<00:03:12.349> I'll<00:03:13.349> put

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
different modes so for example I'll put

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.159 
different modes so for example I'll put
the<00:03:13.620> remote<00:03:13.859> down<00:03:14.099> it<00:03:14.639> does<00:03:15.450> one<00:03:15.630> pattern<00:03:15.900> for

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:16.169 
the remote down it does one pattern for

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:17.509 
the remote down it does one pattern for
a<00:03:16.230> little<00:03:16.319> while<00:03:16.530> and<00:03:16.829> then<00:03:16.889> switches<00:03:17.400> to<00:03:17.430> the

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
a little while and then switches to the

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:19.039 
a little while and then switches to the
next<00:03:17.790> pattern<00:03:18.000> does<00:03:18.359> that<00:03:18.540> for<00:03:18.690> a<00:03:18.750> little<00:03:18.870> bit

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
next pattern does that for a little bit

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:20.740 
next pattern does that for a little bit
and<00:03:19.290> then<00:03:19.680> switch<00:03:19.859> us<00:03:19.980> to<00:03:20.099> the<00:03:20.190> next<00:03:20.310> pattern

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
and then switch us to the next pattern

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.909 
and then switch us to the next pattern
so<00:03:21.750> if<00:03:21.870> you<00:03:21.989> want<00:03:22.169> to<00:03:22.230> really<00:03:22.349> put<00:03:22.620> on<00:03:22.709> a<00:03:22.739> good

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:22.919 
so if you want to really put on a good

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:24.890 
so if you want to really put on a good
light<00:03:23.130> show<00:03:23.370> and<00:03:23.609> you're<00:03:24.209> flying<00:03:24.480> this<00:03:24.630> around

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
light show and you're flying this around

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.440 
light show and you're flying this around
with<00:03:25.200> you<00:03:25.620> know<00:03:25.709> group<00:03:25.950> of<00:03:26.069> people<00:03:26.400> you<00:03:27.269> can

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
with you know group of people you can

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.569 
with you know group of people you can
almost<00:03:27.569> just<00:03:27.840> hit<00:03:27.989> demo<00:03:28.349> take<00:03:29.040> off<00:03:29.250> and<00:03:29.549> then

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
almost just hit demo take off and then

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:31.490 
almost just hit demo take off and then
is<00:03:30.209> your<00:03:30.359> drone<00:03:30.660> will<00:03:30.780> just<00:03:30.959> start<00:03:31.109> doing<00:03:31.290> all

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
is your drone will just start doing all

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.289 
is your drone will just start doing all
kinds<00:03:31.829> crazy<00:03:32.069> flashing<00:03:32.579> patterns<00:03:32.760> and<00:03:33.120> stuff

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
kinds crazy flashing patterns and stuff

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:34.699 
kinds crazy flashing patterns and stuff
so<00:03:34.139> you<00:03:34.200> don't<00:03:34.319> have<00:03:34.380> to<00:03:34.470> worry<00:03:34.620> about

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
so you don't have to worry about

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.379 
so you don't have to worry about
actively<00:03:35.400> changing<00:03:35.609> a<00:03:35.880> while<00:03:36.090> trying<00:03:36.299> to

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:36.389 
actively changing a while trying to

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:39.379 
actively changing a while trying to
pilot<00:03:36.750> it<00:03:36.810> as<00:03:36.959> well<00:03:37.880> the<00:03:38.880> other<00:03:39.000> option<00:03:39.329> is

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:39.389 
pilot it as well the other option is

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:40.610 
pilot it as well the other option is
giving<00:03:39.660> one<00:03:39.780> of<00:03:39.810> your<00:03:39.959> friends<00:03:40.200> that<00:03:40.380> the

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
giving one of your friends that the

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.259 
giving one of your friends that the
remote<00:03:41.130> to<00:03:41.280> change<00:03:41.459> the<00:03:41.579> colors<00:03:41.849> and<00:03:42.000> let<00:03:42.120> them
