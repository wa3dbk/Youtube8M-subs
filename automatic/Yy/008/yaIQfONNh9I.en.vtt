so<00:00:01.469> God<00:00:01.680> says<00:00:01.920> cookies<00:00:02.280> have<00:00:02.429> a<00:00:02.460> salon<00:00:02.700> with<00:00:02.879> a

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
so God says cookies have a salon with a

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:04.400 
so God says cookies have a salon with a
go<00:00:03.120> technique<00:00:03.540> review<00:00:03.810> and<00:00:03.899> today<00:00:04.110> I'm<00:00:04.200> going

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
go technique review and today I'm going

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.530 
go technique review and today I'm going
to<00:00:04.529> use<00:00:04.650> a<00:00:04.859> cream<00:00:05.250> off-roader<00:00:05.730> which<00:00:06.210> came<00:00:06.450> out

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
to use a cream off-roader which came out

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.290 
to use a cream off-roader which came out
in<00:00:06.600> 2001<00:00:07.140> and<00:00:07.470> here's<00:00:07.649> instruction<00:00:08.280> the<00:00:09.030> lego

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
in 2001 and here's instruction the lego

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.129 
in 2001 and here's instruction the lego
technic<00:00:09.750> 18<00:00:10.139> 465<00:00:10.920> extreme<00:00:11.700> off-road<00:00:11.910> up<00:00:12.300> and

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
technic 18 465 extreme off-road up and

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.509 
technic 18 465 extreme off-road up and
on<00:00:13.259> so<00:00:13.410> if<00:00:13.469> it<00:00:13.620> settles<00:00:13.920> instruction<00:00:14.400> you<00:00:14.460> can

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
on so if it settles instruction you can

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.250 
on so if it settles instruction you can
see<00:00:14.849> two<00:00:15.030> others<00:00:15.330> heads<00:00:15.570> I<00:00:15.690> don't<00:00:15.900> have<00:00:16.080> them

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
see two others heads I don't have them

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.859 
see two others heads I don't have them
but<00:00:16.379> I'm<00:00:16.560> trying<00:00:16.830> to<00:00:16.890> get<00:00:17.160> them<00:00:17.750> and<00:00:18.750> oh<00:00:20.869> this

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
but I'm trying to get them and oh this

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.310 
but I'm trying to get them and oh this
instruction<00:00:22.760> this<00:00:23.760> model<00:00:24.689> also<00:00:24.840> fits<00:00:25.140> this

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
instruction this model also fits this

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.950 
instruction this model also fits this
one<00:00:25.529> here<00:00:25.859> and<00:00:26.670> we<00:00:26.880> also<00:00:27.090> get<00:00:27.359> some<00:00:27.390> such

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
one here and we also get some such

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.359 
one here and we also get some such
things<00:00:28.470> here<00:00:29.510> which<00:00:30.510> you<00:00:30.689> can<00:00:30.929> do<00:00:31.710> listen<00:00:31.949> said

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
things here which you can do listen said

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.990 
things here which you can do listen said
it's<00:00:33.300> this<00:00:33.510> one<00:00:33.750> here<00:00:33.920> this<00:00:34.920> one<00:00:35.000> speed

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
it's this one here this one speed

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.160 
it's this one here this one speed
computers<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.750> technique<00:00:37.739> figures<00:00:38.540> and<00:00:39.540> this

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
computers the technique figures and this

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.010 
computers the technique figures and this
year<00:00:40.620> it's<00:00:41.190> tire<00:00:41.579> said<00:00:42.000> they<00:00:42.600> don't<00:00:42.840> have

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
year it's tire said they don't have

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.740 
year it's tire said they don't have
those<00:00:43.230> sets<00:00:43.500> but<00:00:43.680> I'm<00:00:43.860> trying<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.219> get<00:00:44.460> this

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
those sets but I'm trying to get this

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:51.380 
those sets but I'm trying to get this
and<00:00:45.750> I<00:00:45.870> think<00:00:46.140> it's<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.379> bad<00:00:46.620> bed<00:00:47.660> yeah<00:00:49.219> now<00:00:50.390> on

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
and I think it's a bad bed yeah now on

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.869 
and I think it's a bad bed yeah now on
to<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.600> instruction<00:00:52.199> was<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.410> swim<00:00:53.399> off<00:00:53.610> from

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
to the instruction was a swim off from

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:13.039 
to the instruction was a swim off from
now<00:00:54.920> Ches<00:00:58.309> Ches<00:01:03.170> this<00:01:06.500> 157<00:01:07.500> pages<00:01:08.810> and<00:01:12.049> here's

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
now Ches Ches this 157 pages and here's

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:25.149 
now Ches Ches this 157 pages and here's
the<00:01:13.320> instruction<00:01:16.189> was<00:01:21.740> well<00:01:22.740> ii<00:01:23.729> wanted

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 
the instruction was well ii wanted

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:32.630 
the instruction was well ii wanted
chairs<00:01:27.140> for<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.290> 84<00:01:29.040> pages<00:01:29.579> no<00:01:31.310> this<00:01:32.310> goes

I'm no mistakes in the instruction

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.090 
I'm no mistakes in the instruction
there's<00:02:22.780> no<00:02:22.960> missing<00:02:23.320> pieces<00:02:23.500> in<00:02:23.800> the<00:02:23.890> said

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
there's no missing pieces in the said

it's<00:02:36.700> a<00:02:37.080> weed<00:02:38.080> here<00:02:38.500> and<00:02:38.950> if<00:02:39.070> you<00:02:39.160> turn<00:02:39.370> this<00:02:39.550> on

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
it's a weed here and if you turn this on

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.700 
it's a weed here and if you turn this on
the<00:02:40.530> the<00:02:41.530> formed<00:02:42.370> tiles<00:02:43.240> here<00:02:43.420> are<00:02:44.080> going<00:02:44.410> to

the the formed tiles here are going to

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:48.590 
the the formed tiles here are going to
move<00:02:45.100> and<00:02:45.660> here's<00:02:46.660> a<00:02:46.720> seed<00:02:47.050> for<00:02:47.260> the<00:02:47.440> figure

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
move and here's a seed for the figure

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.940 
move and here's a seed for the figure
technically<00:02:49.600> notice<00:02:49.900> it'll<00:02:50.110> steer<00:02:50.620> until

supposed<00:03:19.060> to<00:03:19.150> be<00:03:19.269> a<00:03:19.300> swing<00:03:19.600> but<00:03:19.840> I<00:03:20.050> had<00:03:20.560> a

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
supposed to be a swing but I had a

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.550 
supposed to be a swing but I had a
problem<00:03:20.980> this<00:03:21.370> is<00:03:21.430> train<00:03:21.820> so<00:03:22.090> I'm<00:03:23.080> sure<00:03:23.380> those

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
problem this is train so I'm sure those
