00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.750 
that you want to keep them in a common
area<00:01:57.260> where<00:01:58.260> they<00:01:58.350> can<00:01:58.500> hear<00:01:58.800> you<00:01:59.010> during<00:01:59.640> the

00:01:59.750 --> 00:01:59.760 
area where they can hear you during the

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.460 
area where they can hear you during the
day<00:01:59.940> and<00:02:00.300> I<00:02:00.480> even<00:02:00.780> though<00:02:00.840> they<00:02:00.960> are<00:02:01.050> nocturnal

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
day and I even though they are nocturnal

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.980 
day and I even though they are nocturnal
they<00:02:01.710> do<00:02:01.920> groom<00:02:02.670> each<00:02:02.820> other<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.420> lounge

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
they do groom each other and lounge

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.660 
they do groom each other and lounge
around<00:02:04.200> inside<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.860> nesting<00:02:05.190> box<00:02:05.370> on<00:02:05.550> the

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
around inside the nesting box on the

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.310 
around inside the nesting box on the
pouch<00:02:05.850> during<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.360> day<00:02:06.540> and<00:02:06.780> they<00:02:06.870> can<00:02:07.020> hear

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
pouch during the day and they can hear

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.900 
pouch during the day and they can hear
what<00:02:07.470> you're<00:02:07.590> doing<00:02:07.979> and<00:02:08.280> I<00:02:08.610> think<00:02:08.759> it's<00:02:08.880> a

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
what you're doing and I think it's a

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.490 
what you're doing and I think it's a
comfort<00:02:09.300> for<00:02:09.420> them<00:02:09.540> to<00:02:09.690> hear<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.170> day<00:02:10.290> on<00:02:10.410> the

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
comfort for them to hear the day on the

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.290 
comfort for them to hear the day on the
activities<00:02:11.070> they<00:02:11.520> don't<00:02:11.670> like<00:02:11.790> really<00:02:12.030> loud

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
activities they don't like really loud

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.780 
activities they don't like really loud
sounds<00:02:12.959> so<00:02:13.290> you<00:02:14.010> don't<00:02:14.160> want<00:02:14.310> to<00:02:14.370> you<00:02:14.670> know

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
sounds so you don't want to you know

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.570 
sounds so you don't want to you know
last<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.450> stereo<00:02:15.840> really<00:02:16.200> loud<00:02:16.440> or<00:02:16.709> make<00:02:17.550> any

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
last the stereo really loud or make any

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.370 
last the stereo really loud or make any
really<00:02:17.970> loud<00:02:18.150> sounds<00:02:18.660> you<00:02:18.810> have<00:02:18.900> cover<00:02:19.140> them

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
really loud sounds you have cover them

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.770 
really loud sounds you have cover them
at<00:02:19.500> night<00:02:19.530> like<00:02:20.070> birds<00:02:20.370> well<00:02:21.180> I<00:02:21.209> think<00:02:21.510> if<00:02:21.630> you

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
at night like birds well I think if you

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.140 
at night like birds well I think if you
want<00:02:21.990> to<00:02:22.080> cover<00:02:22.380> the<00:02:23.010> partial<00:02:23.640> to<00:02:23.730> cover<00:02:24.000> the

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
want to cover the partial to cover the

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.670 
want to cover the partial to cover the
cage<00:02:24.360> especially<00:02:24.870> the<00:02:24.930> area<00:02:25.200> where<00:02:25.350> the<00:02:25.440> food

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
cage especially the area where the food

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.260 
cage especially the area where the food
is<00:02:25.830> because<00:02:26.040> they<00:02:26.160> like<00:02:26.340> to<00:02:26.459> fling<00:02:26.760> their<00:02:26.940> food

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
is because they like to fling their food

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.990 
is because they like to fling their food
so<00:02:28.170> covering<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:28.650> cage<00:02:28.830> is<00:02:28.980> a<00:02:29.040> good<00:02:29.160> idea<00:02:29.220> also

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
so covering the cage is a good idea also

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.540 
so covering the cage is a good idea also
helps<00:02:30.360> to<00:02:30.420> avoid<00:02:30.600> drafts<00:02:31.170> but<00:02:31.890> routine<00:02:32.310> when

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
helps to avoid drafts but routine when

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.010 
helps to avoid drafts but routine when
you<00:02:32.700> should<00:02:32.880> cover<00:02:33.060> the<00:02:33.180> cages<00:02:33.630> but<00:02:33.750> leave<00:02:33.930> the

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
you should cover the cages but leave the

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.690 
you should cover the cages but leave the
front<00:02:34.170> of<00:02:34.320> the<00:02:34.380> cage<00:02:34.560> open<00:02:34.860> so<00:02:35.220> they<00:02:35.340> can<00:02:35.370> see

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
front of the cage open so they can see

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.720 
front of the cage open so they can see
out<00:02:35.910> and<00:02:36.870> things<00:02:37.200> of<00:02:37.530> course<00:02:37.739> the<00:02:38.489> cage<00:02:38.700> is

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
out and things of course the cage is

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.850 
out and things of course the cage is
only<00:02:39.120> their<00:02:39.390> home<00:02:39.630> base<00:02:39.900> that's<00:02:40.440> where<00:02:40.680> you

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
only their home base that's where you

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.420 
only their home base that's where you
keep<00:02:41.010> them<00:02:41.250> so<00:02:41.520> they<00:02:41.670> can<00:02:41.850> be<00:02:41.970> safe<00:02:42.980> if<00:02:43.980> you<00:02:44.220> let

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
keep them so they can be safe if you let

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.920 
keep them so they can be safe if you let
them<00:02:44.550> out<00:02:44.700> of<00:02:44.760> the<00:02:44.940> cage<00:02:45.120> a<00:02:45.150> lot<00:02:45.480> and<00:02:45.660> give<00:02:45.810> them

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
them out of the cage a lot and give them

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.479 
them out of the cage a lot and give them
some<00:02:46.140> freedom<00:02:46.620> especially<00:02:46.800> don't<00:02:47.190> have<00:02:47.370> other

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
some freedom especially don't have other

as well gliders also liked how to
alternate<00:03:32.910> nesting<00:03:33.330> spot<00:03:33.690> so<00:03:34.110> it's<00:03:34.290> okay<00:03:34.530> to

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
alternate nesting spot so it's okay to

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.840 
alternate nesting spot so it's okay to
have<00:03:34.739> a<00:03:34.769> nesting<00:03:35.310> box<00:03:35.760> and<00:03:36.180> a<00:03:36.989> powder<00:03:37.260> too
