00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 I admire athletes enormously 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:09.300
 exactly then I know what it is 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.769
 sacrifice discipline and admire 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.200
 enormously to the athletes and I 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.509
 love that today they can release 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.330
 enjoy the sport and it's also a 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.270
 way to educate through we talked 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.859
 of that just from how to contain 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.869
 the teenagers and I raised whether the 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.820
 sport does not help the 32 envelopes and 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.289
 little are away from the drug away from the 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.880
 night left a lot of things because the 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.529
 that sportsman wants to sleep 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.719
 early wants to lead a healthier life 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.430
 because I commented the next day and apart it's 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.850
 a different social life helps a lot 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.350
 it helps a lot good this train 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.570
 talk about attraction with technology 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.430
 work we talk about that subject that says 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.039
 if not both the day and with the phone 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.379
 and it helps us so much that the boys 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.360
 have a goal then they have something 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.190
 Mayor has something to do but 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.719
 It is also something that they propose 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.750
 then and everyone has something good that 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.340
 achieve is the goal then 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.469
 ending is the cole and they are going to 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.750
 train and want to improve and want 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.180
 then that encourages them for and 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.950
 motivates 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.530
 to nothing to move on continue 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.150
 training that will go then the 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.270
 keeps a bit away from all the 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.740
 technology and it's also one I think that 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.630
 also that it's very much like 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.100
 you seduce me I never in my life had a 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.229
 play in my house for example wanted 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.140
 prohibit the unit but yes but 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:26.690
 naturally I am 0 0 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.720
 I hope well let's buy me from the play 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.100
 they know that at the beginning at the beginning 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:36.820
 bigger when they were guys kind 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.820
 they wanted to go play at the house of the is 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:44.899
 how to say that it is not difficult 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.399
 possibility to say that zara but good yo 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:48.890
 I'm convinced to say that it's not a 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:50.420
 way to show love and why I 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.470
 Interested I worry about you and because I 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:59.800
 interested I do not think 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:02:04.570
 and if I am very firm of the 21 that 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:07.320
 sign the boundaries of a place in the 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:11.110
 banking to me it costs me so much I ask 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:13.720
 if later this benefit for him and for 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.970
 it seems to me that when you put a 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.640
 frame is not the boy undertakes to move 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.680
 inside I say also after you know 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.690
 also that you already have your schedules you know 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:27.370
 when you can move you know that up 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:29.020
 that there is a limit you eat you bathe that 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.400
 can vary usually understood yes 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.660
 but that may vary but if we say 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.920
 us in half an hour all ready half 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.540
 everyone ready that is late does not know 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.260
 feel at the table because because all 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.260
 we have to wait 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:51.450
 is in everything to understand because later in the 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.780
 way in which you live the way in 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.780
 what you share is a way 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.780
 any 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.040
 4 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:14.820
 in the room all day because it has 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.210
 sent a macana locked in the 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.210
 quarter 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.780
 we are eating waiting for it 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.570
 Let's go, Let's go, Let's go, Let's go 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.230
 if the technology is a pretty struggle 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:40.020
 strong more with the kids and really in 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.340
 some time you have to put a fence of 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.590
 those who are far away if you move away from what 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:47.459
 that are close then if there are moments 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:51.680
 that is already here we look at each other we talk 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:51.680
 we were perfect
