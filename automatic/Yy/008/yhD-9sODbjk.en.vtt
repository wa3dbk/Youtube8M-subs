the crossovers are buried back the
pioneer<00:01:09.340> head<00:01:09.490> unit<00:01:09.520> was<00:01:09.850> a<00:01:09.880> little<00:01:10.150> bit

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
pioneer head unit was a little bit

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.690 
pioneer head unit was a little bit
tricky<00:01:10.509> because<00:01:11.259> it<00:01:11.500> comes<00:01:11.710> up<00:01:11.920> and<00:01:12.189> it<00:01:12.520> has<00:01:12.670> to

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
tricky because it comes up and it has to

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.820 
tricky because it comes up and it has to
angle<00:01:13.210> up<00:01:13.360> so<00:01:13.659> that<00:01:13.810> it<00:01:13.930> doesn't<00:01:14.110> hit<00:01:14.439> these

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:14.830 
angle up so that it doesn't hit these

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:16.770 
angle up so that it doesn't hit these
confirm<00:01:15.250> this<00:01:15.340> control<00:01:15.759> panel<00:01:15.790> and<00:01:16.330> you<00:01:16.659> can

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
confirm this control panel and you can

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.090 
confirm this control panel and you can
still<00:01:16.990> collapse<00:01:17.290> it<00:01:17.470> if<00:01:17.530> you<00:01:17.619> need<00:01:17.740> to<00:01:17.829> get<00:01:17.950> to

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
still collapse it if you need to get to

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.830 
still collapse it if you need to get to
the<00:01:18.130> climate<00:01:18.549> controls<00:01:18.880> and<00:01:19.479> you<00:01:19.600> can<00:01:19.720> also

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
the climate controls and you can also

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.410 
the climate controls and you can also
pre<00:01:20.259> set<00:01:20.500> the<00:01:20.619> angle<00:01:20.799> so<00:01:21.189> every<00:01:21.490> time<00:01:21.520> it<00:01:22.210> comes

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
pre set the angle so every time it comes

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.240 
pre set the angle so every time it comes
up<00:01:22.630> just<00:01:22.810> perfect<00:01:23.290> without<00:01:23.409> smacking<00:01:24.130> the

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
up just perfect without smacking the

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:32.410 
up just perfect without smacking the
controls<00:01:24.880> let's<00:01:25.329> turn<00:01:25.540> it<00:01:25.630> on

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.910 

and<00:01:33.420> there<00:01:33.690> you<00:01:33.810> go<00:01:33.840> it's<00:01:34.229> right<00:01:34.470> at<00:01:34.619> a<00:01:34.680> perfect

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
and there you go it's right at a perfect

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.950 
and there you go it's right at a perfect
angle<00:01:35.400> if<00:01:35.700> you<00:01:35.909> need<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.180> collapse<00:01:36.479> and<00:01:36.690> get<00:01:36.869> to

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
angle if you need to collapse and get to

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.249 
angle if you need to collapse and get to
those<00:01:37.080> controls<00:01:37.560> you<00:01:37.740> can<00:01:37.920> do<00:01:38.100> it<00:01:42.259> USB

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
those controls you can do it USB

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:55.890 
those controls you can do it USB
connectors<00:01:43.740> right<00:01:43.920> on<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.159> face<00:01:44.340> of<00:01:44.369> this<00:01:44.670> one

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
then let's go back over to the trunk and

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.690 
then let's go back over to the trunk and
see<00:02:14.810> how<00:02:14.900> the<00:02:14.959> amp<00:02:15.170> installation<00:02:18.550> let's<00:02:19.550> go

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
see how the amp installation let's go

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:29.740 
see how the amp installation let's go
have<00:02:19.850> a<00:02:19.910> look<00:02:19.940> at<00:02:20.180> the<00:02:20.270> truck
