special<00:01:05.309> but<00:01:05.760> this<00:01:05.909> in<00:01:06.060> my<00:01:06.180> opinion<00:01:06.390> is<00:01:06.689> more

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
special but this in my opinion is more

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.960 
special but this in my opinion is more
than<00:01:07.049> forgivable<00:01:07.590> as<00:01:07.799> a<00:01:07.830> more<00:01:08.400> advanced<00:01:08.700> table

than forgivable as a more advanced table
design<00:01:09.240> would<00:01:09.540> really<00:01:09.810> distract<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:10.530> make<00:01:10.979> it

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
design would really distract and make it

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.190 
design would really distract and make it
a<00:01:11.189> more<00:01:11.490> confusing<00:01:11.909> gaming<00:01:12.390> experience<00:01:12.930> and

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
a more confusing gaming experience and

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.149 
a more confusing gaming experience and
the<00:01:13.320> sound<00:01:13.530> is<00:01:13.710> spot-on

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
the sound is spot-on

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.520 
the sound is spot-on
it<00:01:14.460> makes<00:01:14.820> really<00:01:15.360> good<00:01:15.479> use<00:01:15.659> of<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.990> Atari

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530

it makes really good use of the Atari
2600<00:01:17.100> hardware<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:18.030> it<00:01:18.360> does<00:01:18.479> a<00:01:18.509> good<00:01:18.659> job<00:01:18.720> of

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
2600 hardware and it does a good job of

between<00:01:40.439> being<00:01:40.950> able<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.189> use<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.610> two

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
between being able to use the two

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.520 
between being able to use the two
paddles<00:01:42.150> but<00:01:42.479> in<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.689> really<00:01:42.960> hectic<00:01:43.110> situation

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
paddles but in a really hectic situation

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.590 
paddles but in a really hectic situation
this<00:01:44.040> is<00:01:44.220> more<00:01:44.549> than<00:01:44.700> enough<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:45.180> have<00:01:45.509> you

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
this is more than enough to have you

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.999 
this is more than enough to have you
lose<00:01:45.750> a<00:01:45.780> ball<00:01:46.020> I<00:01:46.259> would<00:01:46.409> personally<00:01:46.680> recommend

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
lose a ball I would personally recommend

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.819 
lose a ball I would personally recommend
emulating<00:01:47.850> this<00:01:48.450> game<00:01:48.689> and<00:01:49.350> then<00:01:49.500> assigning

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
emulating this game and then assigning

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.590 
emulating this game and then assigning
the<00:01:50.040> keys<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.610> left<00:01:50.909> and<00:01:51.090> right<00:01:51.240> side<00:01:51.479> of

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
the keys to the left and right side of

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.999 
the keys to the left and right side of
your<00:01:51.689> keyboard<00:01:51.840> so<00:01:52.380> you<00:01:52.470> can<00:01:52.590> use<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.860> two

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
your keyboard so you can use the two

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.889 
your keyboard so you can use the two
paddles<00:01:53.220> independently<00:01:53.970> at<00:01:54.210> a<00:01:54.240> distance<00:01:54.810> just

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
paddles independently at a distance just

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.719 
paddles independently at a distance just
like<00:01:55.229> on<00:01:55.380> a<00:01:55.409> real<00:01:55.500> pinball<00:01:55.890> machine<00:01:56.310> this<00:01:56.549> is

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
like on a real pinball machine this is

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.100 
like on a real pinball machine this is
obviously<00:01:57.000> not<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.360> way<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.600> game<00:01:57.630> was<00:01:57.899> meant

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
obviously not the way the game was meant

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.959 
obviously not the way the game was meant
to<00:01:58.200> be<00:01:58.320> played<00:01:58.590> but<00:01:58.979> I<00:01:59.159> find<00:01:59.430> it<00:01:59.549> a<00:01:59.610> much<00:01:59.790> better

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
to be played but I find it a much better

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.179 
to be played but I find it a much better
gaming<00:02:00.360> experience<00:02:00.540> this<00:02:01.079> way<00:02:01.290> as<00:02:01.920> far<00:02:02.100> as

pinball<00:03:10.480> and<00:03:10.780> retro<00:03:11.319> gaming<00:03:11.560> both<00:03:11.889> at<00:03:12.069> the

00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:12.159 
pinball and retro gaming both at the

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:14.069 
pinball and retro gaming both at the
same<00:03:12.340> time<00:03:12.370> and<00:03:12.909> I<00:03:13.000> think<00:03:13.209> any<00:03:13.389> pinball<00:03:13.840> games
