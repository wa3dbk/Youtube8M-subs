00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:34.239 
cannot get it apartment took in half so

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:35.940 
cannot get it apartment took in half so
the<00:00:34.390> whole<00:00:34.540> bunch<00:00:34.930> housing<00:00:35.320> that<00:00:35.410> big<00:00:35.680> thing

that<00:00:35.980> would<00:00:36.460> have<00:00:36.640> to<00:00:36.789> come<00:00:36.820> apart<00:00:37.360> so<00:00:37.660> I<00:00:38.140> just

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350 
that would have to come apart so I just

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.380 
that would have to come apart so I just
broke<00:00:38.740> the<00:00:38.980> drill<00:00:39.220> apart<00:00:39.579> since<00:00:39.970> you<00:00:40.150> run

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:21.790 
kind of flat spot so every drill bit was

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.430 
kind of flat spot so every drill bit was
this<00:01:21.940> size<00:01:22.210> where<00:01:22.510> I<00:01:22.540> went<00:01:22.690> to<00:01:22.840> chuck<00:01:23.080> you<00:01:23.350> had

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.440 
this size where I went to chuck you had

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.770 
tighten down a flat spot and there you
went<00:01:27.340> so<00:01:27.610> now<00:01:28.090> we're<00:01:28.270> going<00:01:28.360> to<00:01:28.450> be<00:01:28.540> able<00:01:28.659> to

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
went so now we're going to be able to

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.600 
went so now we're going to be able to
use<00:01:28.930> 3/8<00:01:29.440> and<00:01:29.650> smaller<00:01:29.860> bits<00:01:30.130> on<00:01:30.310> the<00:01:30.340> hand

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
use 3/8 and smaller bits on the hand

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.539 
use 3/8 and smaller bits on the hand
drill<00:01:30.820> because<00:01:31.420> this<00:01:31.600> still<00:01:31.869> works<00:01:32.310> it<00:01:33.310> will

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:33.549 
drill because this still works it will

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:36.810 
drill because this still works it will
slip<00:01:34.350> this<00:01:35.350> was<00:01:35.590> so<00:01:35.770> cheap<00:01:36.070> and<00:01:36.250> junky<00:01:36.640> that

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
slip this was so cheap and junky that

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.940 
slip this was so cheap and junky that
you<00:01:37.060> had<00:01:37.299> to<00:01:37.420> bit<00:01:37.630> with<00:01:37.810> the<00:01:37.930> three<00:01:38.170> flat<00:01:38.619> sides

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
you had to bit with the three flat sides

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.250 
you had to bit with the three flat sides
on<00:01:39.220> it<00:01:39.250> it<00:01:39.610> will<00:01:39.909> still<00:01:40.330> slip<00:01:40.659> in<00:01:40.810> there

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:41.260 
on it it will still slip in there

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.640 
on it it will still slip in there
I<00:01:41.290> finally<00:01:42.070> shucked<00:01:42.490> everything<00:01:42.909> out<00:01:43.650> making

I have seen these repurposed with a
motor<00:03:18.610> on<00:03:18.730> I<00:03:19.090> won't<00:03:19.269> do<00:03:19.480> that<00:03:19.510> to<00:03:19.689> this<00:03:19.989> I<00:03:20.349> don't

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
motor on I won't do that to this I don't

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.179 
motor on I won't do that to this I don't
want<00:03:21.040> to<00:03:21.129> wear<00:03:21.250> it<00:03:21.400> out<00:03:22.590> there<00:03:23.590> is<00:03:23.709> marks<00:03:24.069> in

00:03:24.179 --> 00:03:24.189 
want to wear it out there is marks in

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:27.000 
want to wear it out there is marks in
the<00:03:24.250> back<00:03:24.400> this<00:03:24.609> is<00:03:25.170> 1923<00:03:26.170> in<00:03:26.260> Roman<00:03:26.620> numerals

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
the back this is 1923 in Roman numerals

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:34.140 
the back this is 1923 in Roman numerals
but<00:03:30.870> there<00:03:31.870> you<00:03:31.989> go<00:03:32.459> it<00:03:33.459> doesn't<00:03:33.700> go<00:03:33.970> all<00:03:34.060> the

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
but there you go it doesn't go all the

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.069 
but there you go it doesn't go all the
way<00:03:34.239> up<00:03:34.390> in<00:03:34.599> there

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:35.079 
way up in there

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:37.020 
way up in there
so<00:03:35.530> the<00:03:35.680> way<00:03:35.799> to<00:03:35.829> do<00:03:35.980> that<00:03:36.129> is<00:03:36.340> I'm<00:03:36.609> not<00:03:36.849> going

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
so the way to do that is I'm not going

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.300 
so the way to do that is I'm not going
to<00:03:37.090> try<00:03:37.269> to<00:03:37.299> grind<00:03:37.599> it<00:03:37.810> down<00:03:37.989> it<00:03:38.829> have<00:03:39.069> to<00:03:39.220> be

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
to try to grind it down it have to be

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.699 
to try to grind it down it have to be
laid<00:03:39.579> down<00:03:39.689> polished<00:03:40.689> or<00:03:40.870> something<00:03:41.230> it's<00:03:41.470> a

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
laid down polished or something it's a

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:45.209 
laid down polished or something it's a
little<00:03:42.069> bit<00:03:42.430> bugger<00:03:42.700> right<00:03:42.849> in<00:03:43.239> here<00:03:44.159> what<00:03:45.159> it

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:45.219 
little bit bugger right in here what it

00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:47.300 
little bit bugger right in here what it
was<00:03:45.370> made<00:03:45.609> but<00:03:45.849> there<00:03:46.269> you<00:03:46.359> go

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
was made but there you go

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.920 
was made but there you go
now<00:03:48.310> if<00:03:48.459> you've<00:03:48.639> any<00:03:48.939> kind<00:03:49.209> of<00:03:49.299> bit<00:03:49.450> me<00:03:49.599> wanting

now if you've any kind of bit me wanting
up<00:03:56.849> take<00:03:57.849> it<00:03:58.000> out<00:03:58.120> said<00:03:58.900> you<00:03:59.019> flip<00:03:59.290> this<00:03:59.470> lever

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
up take it out said you flip this lever

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:06.720 
up take it out said you flip this lever
back<00:04:01.919> raise<00:04:02.919> your<00:04:03.159> bet

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.220 

see<00:04:07.730> that's<00:04:07.940> pulling<00:04:08.330> up<00:04:08.450> off<00:04:08.629> the<00:04:08.780> bit<00:04:08.959> there

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
see that's pulling up off the bit there

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.759 
see that's pulling up off the bit there
that's<00:04:09.860> how<00:04:10.010> that<00:04:10.069> works

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769 
that's how that works

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:15.300 
that's how that works
so<00:04:12.769> they<00:04:12.890> do<00:04:12.950> have<00:04:13.190> a<00:04:13.220> better<00:04:13.430> video<00:04:13.849> of<00:04:14.030> this

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
so they do have a better video of this

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:20.020 
so they do have a better video of this

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
let's look at my search box there we go

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.210 
let's look at my search box there we go
