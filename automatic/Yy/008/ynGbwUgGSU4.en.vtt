the case of this specific color scheme I

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.020 
the case of this specific color scheme I
think<00:02:40.800> it<00:02:40.890> all<00:02:41.010> comes<00:02:41.220> down<00:02:41.310> to<00:02:41.490> the<00:02:41.730> chest

dude<00:03:00.750> the<00:03:01.080> fit<00:03:01.260> of<00:03:01.350> the<00:03:01.410> pieces<00:03:01.620> was<00:03:01.890> more

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
dude the fit of the pieces was more

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.160 
dude the fit of the pieces was more
solid<00:03:02.459> than<00:03:02.550> I<00:03:02.670> anticipated<00:03:02.970> even<00:03:03.870> with<00:03:04.140> a

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
rigorous shake test I mean I could get

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.840 
rigorous shake test I mean I could get
more<00:03:09.000> rigorous<00:03:10.459> all<00:03:11.459> right<00:03:11.580> now<00:03:11.700> I'm<00:03:11.760> just

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
more rigorous all right now I'm just

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.610 
more rigorous all right now I'm just
getting<00:03:12.090> silly<00:03:15.050> anyway<00:03:16.050> this<00:03:16.320> has<00:03:16.470> been
