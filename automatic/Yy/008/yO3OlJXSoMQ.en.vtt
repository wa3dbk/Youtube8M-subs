this<00:00:07.620> top<00:00:08.240> thing<00:00:09.240> is<00:00:09.540> left<00:00:10.019> center<00:00:10.679> and<00:00:10.830> right

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
this top thing is left center and right

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.740 
this top thing is left center and right
and<00:00:11.460> you<00:00:12.240> move<00:00:12.509> it<00:00:12.870> by<00:00:13.620> moving<00:00:13.980> this<00:00:14.519> and<00:00:14.880> what

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
and you move it by moving this and what

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.080 
and you move it by moving this and what
that<00:00:15.929> is<00:00:16.109> is<00:00:16.379> the<00:00:16.560> needle<00:00:16.800> position<00:00:17.100> right

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
that is is the needle position right

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.810 
that is is the needle position right
here<00:00:18.119> so<00:00:18.750> if<00:00:19.020> it's<00:00:19.500> in<00:00:19.680> center<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.460> needles

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
here so if it's in center the needles

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.269 
here so if it's in center the needles
coming<00:00:21.240> straight<00:00:21.510> down<00:00:21.570> if<00:00:22.080> I<00:00:22.590> move<00:00:22.859> it<00:00:23.010> to<00:00:23.039> the

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
coming straight down if I move it to the

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.250 
coming straight down if I move it to the
left<00:00:24.529> see<00:00:25.529> it<00:00:25.619> shift<00:00:26.039> to<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.369> left<00:00:26.400> I<00:00:27.019> don't<00:00:28.019> I

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
left see it shift to the left I don't I

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.870 
left see it shift to the left I don't I
didn't<00:00:28.680> ever<00:00:28.800> hardly<00:00:29.189> ever<00:00:29.279> do<00:00:29.460> that<00:00:29.580> so<00:00:29.849> just

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
didn't ever hardly ever do that so just

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.260 
didn't ever hardly ever do that so just
make<00:00:30.539> sure<00:00:30.570> that<00:00:30.990> stays<00:00:31.289> on<00:00:31.439> Center<00:00:32.270> this

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
make sure that stays on Center this

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:40.270 
make sure that stays on Center this
bottom<00:00:34.670> thing<00:00:35.670> is<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.540> stitch<00:00:36.960> width<00:00:38.450> which

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
bottom thing is the stitch width which

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.970 
bottom thing is the stitch width which
makes<00:00:41.280> sense<00:00:41.670> when<00:00:41.910> you're<00:00:42.030> doing<00:00:42.300> zigzags

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
makes sense when you're doing zigzags

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.020 
makes sense when you're doing zigzags
but<00:00:43.980> when<00:00:44.219> you're<00:00:44.340> just<00:00:44.550> doing<00:00:44.760> straight

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
but when you're just doing straight

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.979 
but when you're just doing straight
stitching<00:00:45.690> it<00:00:46.050> stays<00:00:46.469> there<00:00:46.770> on<00:00:46.980> that<00:00:47.129> red<00:00:47.989> dot

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
stitching it stays there on that red dot

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:56.150 
stitching it stays there on that red dot
I<00:00:49.350> think<00:00:50.309> actually<00:00:51.590> we'll<00:00:52.590> see<00:00:54.350> this<00:00:55.350> is<00:00:55.829> your

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
I think actually we'll see this is your

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.439 
I think actually we'll see this is your
pattern<00:00:57.079> selector<00:00:58.489> so<00:00:59.489> if<00:00:59.969> you're<00:01:00.300> going<00:01:00.390> to

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
pattern selector so if you're going to

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.590 
pattern selector so if you're going to
do<00:01:00.600> straight<00:01:00.840> stitches<00:01:01.520> this<00:01:02.520> is<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:03.270> one<00:01:03.420> it

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
do straight stitches this is the one it

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.050 
do straight stitches this is the one it
is<00:01:03.840> between<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.739> red<00:01:04.890> lines<00:01:05.189> see<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.909> red

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
is between the red lines see the red

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.340 
is between the red lines see the red
lines<00:01:06.240> right<00:01:06.420> there<00:01:06.450> or<00:01:06.780> showing<00:01:07.020> you<00:01:07.200> that

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
lines right there or showing you that

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.140 
lines right there or showing you that
we're<00:01:07.500> doing<00:01:07.619> straight<00:01:07.950> stitching<00:01:08.369> if<00:01:08.520> you

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
we're doing straight stitching if you

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.260 
we're doing straight stitching if you
want<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.479> switch<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.990> zigzag<00:01:10.500> which<00:01:10.830> is<00:01:11.270> the

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
want to switch to zigzag which is the

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.320 
want to switch to zigzag which is the
one<00:01:12.450> over<00:01:12.750> you<00:01:12.930> have<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.229> push<00:01:13.500> it<00:01:13.680> in<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.330> move

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
one over you have to push it in and move

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.280 
one over you have to push it in and move
it<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:15.720> pull<00:01:15.900> it<00:01:15.930> back<00:01:16.200> out<00:01:16.430> or<00:01:17.990> if<00:01:18.990> you<00:01:19.049> want

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
it and pull it back out or if you want

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.160 
it and pull it back out or if you want
to<00:01:19.320> do<00:01:19.470> that's<00:01:19.680> like<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:20.220> ham<00:01:20.520> stitch<00:01:21.020> push<00:01:22.020> it

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
to do that's like a ham stitch push it

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.530 
to do that's like a ham stitch push it
in<00:01:22.320> move<00:01:22.920> it<00:01:23.040> over<00:01:23.310> pull<00:01:23.759> it<00:01:23.880> back<00:01:24.030> I<00:01:26.540> didn't

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
in move it over pull it back I didn't

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.240 
in move it over pull it back I didn't
ever<00:01:27.659> do<00:01:27.900> anything<00:01:28.110> other<00:01:28.409> than<00:01:28.710> those<00:01:28.920> three

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
ever do anything other than those three

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.960 
ever do anything other than those three
so<00:01:31.850> straight<00:01:32.850> is<00:01:33.030> mostly<00:01:33.450> what<00:01:33.659> you<00:01:33.750> want<00:01:34.970> down

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
so straight is mostly what you want down

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:42.230 
so straight is mostly what you want down
here<00:01:36.420> is<00:01:36.600> your<00:01:37.490> stitch<00:01:38.490> length<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:41.000> so<00:01:42.000> for

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
here is your stitch length and so for

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.510 
here is your stitch length and so for
just<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:42.570> normal<00:01:42.990> straight<00:01:43.290> stitch<00:01:43.680> you<00:01:44.340> want

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
just a normal straight stitch you want

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.679 
just a normal straight stitch you want
it<00:01:44.670> like<00:01:44.970> around<00:01:45.299> ten<00:01:46.700> that's<00:01:47.700> like<00:01:48.030> I<00:01:48.270> think

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
it like around ten that's like I think

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.460 
it like around ten that's like I think
it's<00:01:49.020> ten<00:01:49.530> stitches<00:01:49.979> per<00:01:50.399> inch<00:01:50.430> maybe<00:01:51.119> and

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
it's ten stitches per inch maybe and

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.410 
it's ten stitches per inch maybe and
then<00:01:52.470> if<00:01:52.590> you<00:01:52.710> want<00:01:52.979> really<00:01:53.340> teensy<00:01:54.149> tiny

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
then if you want really teensy tiny

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.679 
then if you want really teensy tiny
stitches<00:01:55.409> you<00:01:56.009> could<00:01:56.159> do<00:01:56.310> 20<00:01:56.820> stitches<00:01:57.180> but

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
stitches you could do 20 stitches but

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.950 
stitches you could do 20 stitches but
like<00:01:57.930> normal<00:01:58.590> sewing<00:01:58.920> is<00:01:59.430> about<00:01:59.820> ten<00:02:00.210> eleven

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
like normal sewing is about ten eleven

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.590 
like normal sewing is about ten eleven
twelve<00:02:01.110> somewhere<00:02:01.649> around<00:02:01.710> there<00:02:02.009> if<00:02:02.600> you're

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
twelve somewhere around there if you're

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.180 
twelve somewhere around there if you're
basting<00:02:04.409> which<00:02:05.100> is<00:02:05.310> you<00:02:06.000> know<00:02:06.350> just<00:02:07.350> trying<00:02:08.129> to

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
basting which is you know just trying to

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.380 
basting which is you know just trying to
get<00:02:08.340> something<00:02:08.580> put<00:02:08.879> together<00:02:08.970> really<00:02:09.270> fast

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
get something put together really fast

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.710 
get something put together really fast
you<00:02:09.929> know<00:02:10.050> don't<00:02:10.440> really<00:02:10.709> care<00:02:10.950> whether<00:02:11.220> it's

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
you know don't really care whether it's

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.140 
you know don't really care whether it's
stated<00:02:12.470> together<00:02:12.890> it's<00:02:13.220> not<00:02:13.340> meant<00:02:13.580> to<00:02:13.640> hold

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
stated together it's not meant to hold

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.050 
stated together it's not meant to hold
it<00:02:14.390> then<00:02:14.960> move<00:02:15.290> it<00:02:15.470> to<00:02:15.500> like<00:02:15.860> six<00:02:16.280> and<00:02:16.580> it<00:02:16.850> makes

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
it then move it to like six and it makes

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.240 
it then move it to like six and it makes
big<00:02:17.360> a<00:02:17.390> long<00:02:17.780> stitches<00:02:18.460> so<00:02:19.460> keep<00:02:20.030> it<00:02:20.180> on<00:02:21.250> ten

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
big a long stitches so keep it on ten

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.740 
big a long stitches so keep it on ten
eleven<00:02:22.940> twelve<00:02:23.030> somewhere<00:02:23.390> around<00:02:23.450> there

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
eleven twelve somewhere around there

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.300 
eleven twelve somewhere around there
this<00:02:24.440> button<00:02:25.010> is<00:02:26.080> reversed<00:02:27.080> so<00:02:27.440> when<00:02:27.590> you<00:02:27.740> hold

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
this button is reversed so when you hold

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.270 
this button is reversed so when you hold
this<00:02:28.610> button<00:02:28.940> down<00:02:29.470> your<00:02:30.470> stitching<00:02:31.010> is<00:02:31.130> going

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280
