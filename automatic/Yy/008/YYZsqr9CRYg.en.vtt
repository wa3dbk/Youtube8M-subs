00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.390 
that I wanted you could also use spray
paint<00:01:33.780> but<00:01:34.229> what<00:01:34.380> I<00:01:34.409> did<00:01:34.740> is<00:01:34.890> I<00:01:35.009> use<00:01:35.220> this

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
paint but what I did is I use this

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.550 
paint but what I did is I use this
little<00:01:35.579> makeup<00:01:36.030> sponge<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:36.689> I<00:01:37.049> just<00:01:37.320> dabbed

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
little makeup sponge and I just dabbed

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.859 
little makeup sponge and I just dabbed
it<00:01:37.740> on<00:01:37.799> you<00:01:38.430> could<00:01:38.579> also<00:01:38.850> use<00:01:39.299> a<00:01:39.329> paintbrush

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
it on you could also use a paintbrush

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.510 
it on you could also use a paintbrush
but<00:01:40.110> a<00:01:40.170> lot<00:01:40.380> of<00:01:40.409> times<00:01:40.650> I<00:01:40.770> don't<00:01:40.950> like<00:01:41.100> using

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
but a lot of times I don't like using

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.340 
but a lot of times I don't like using
paint<00:01:41.729> brushes<00:01:41.939> because<00:01:42.240> they<00:01:42.659> leave<00:01:42.899> brush

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
paint brushes because they leave brush

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.069 
paint brushes because they leave brush
marks<00:01:43.770> so<00:01:44.399> I<00:01:44.430> recommend<00:01:45.090> using<00:01:45.329> a<00:01:45.750> makeup

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
marks so I recommend using a makeup

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.929 
marks so I recommend using a makeup
sponge<00:01:46.200> or<00:01:46.530> you<00:01:46.590> can<00:01:46.740> also<00:01:46.890> use<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.700> little

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
sponge or you can also use the little

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.149 
sponge or you can also use the little
sponge<00:01:48.299> paint<00:01:49.049> brushes<00:01:49.320> that<00:01:49.590> are<00:01:49.740> made<00:01:49.920> for

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
sponge paint brushes that are made for

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.679 
sponge paint brushes that are made for
that<00:01:50.280> but<00:01:50.490> at<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.700> time<00:01:50.880> I<00:01:50.909> didn't<00:01:51.329> have<00:01:51.360> one

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
that but at the time I didn't have one

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.910 
that but at the time I didn't have one
so<00:01:51.960> this<00:01:52.530> ended<00:01:52.860> up<00:01:53.040> working<00:01:53.490> pretty<00:01:53.700> well

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
so this ended up working pretty well

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.340 
so this ended up working pretty well
