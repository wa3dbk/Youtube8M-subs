wanna do that you might be able to find
it<00:02:52.870> on<00:02:52.959> torrent<00:02:53.410> or<00:02:53.530> something<00:02:53.769> like<00:02:53.829> that<00:02:53.890> I

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
it on torrent or something like that I

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:55.979 
it on torrent or something like that I
don't<00:02:54.190> know<00:02:54.340> but<00:02:54.700> I<00:02:54.970> figured<00:02:55.600> it'd<00:02:55.660> be<00:02:55.750> safe<00:02:55.959> to

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
don't know but I figured it'd be safe to

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:57.780 
don't know but I figured it'd be safe to
just<00:02:56.140> buy<00:02:56.440> your<00:02:56.620> own<00:02:56.680> copy<00:02:56.739> of<00:02:57.070> this<00:02:57.250> it

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
just buy your own copy of this it

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.710 
just buy your own copy of this it
doesn't<00:02:57.940> cost<00:02:58.150> that<00:02:58.269> much<00:02:59.910> sadly<00:03:00.910> the<00:03:01.180> the

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
doesn't cost that much sadly the the

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.259 
doesn't cost that much sadly the the
tutorial<00:03:02.290> guys<00:03:02.470> are<00:03:02.859> not<00:03:03.040> translated<00:03:03.400> which

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269 
tutorial guys are not translated which

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:06.569 
tutorial guys are not translated which
is<00:03:04.420> kind<00:03:04.750> of<00:03:04.780> unfortunate<00:03:04.959> but<00:03:05.650> in<00:03:05.950> most<00:03:06.459> cases

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:06.579 
is kind of unfortunate but in most cases

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:08.099 
is kind of unfortunate but in most cases
if<00:03:07.120> you're<00:03:07.269> playing<00:03:07.480> this<00:03:07.630> game<00:03:07.840> you've

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:08.109 
if you're playing this game you've

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:09.539 
if you're playing this game you've
already<00:03:08.380> played<00:03:08.470> things<00:03:08.769> version<00:03:09.190> so<00:03:09.310> this

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:09.549 
already played things version so this

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:11.610 
already played things version so this
shouldn't<00:03:09.730> be<00:03:09.819> a<00:03:09.910> problem<00:03:10.200> as<00:03:11.200> for<00:03:11.440> the<00:03:11.500> new

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620

shouldn't be a problem as for the new
stuff<00:03:11.890> I'm<00:03:12.190> pretty<00:03:12.579> sure<00:03:12.760> that<00:03:13.000> there's<00:03:13.480> a

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:13.569 
stuff I'm pretty sure that there's a

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:16.259 
stuff I'm pretty sure that there's a
guide<00:03:13.810> on<00:03:14.049> gamefaqs<00:03:14.590> somewhere<00:03:15.489> that<00:03:16.120> would

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:55.120 
so so this shouldn't be this shouldn't
be<00:03:28.480> a<00:03:28.540> problem<00:03:28.810> really

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:24.480 

energy

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.250 

yeah<00:04:25.490> a<00:04:25.520> lot<00:04:25.880> of<00:04:25.940> people<00:04:26.090> don't<00:04:26.600> like<00:04:26.780> 10<00:04:27.050> to
