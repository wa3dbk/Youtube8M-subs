00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.300
If you listen,

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.240
You'll hear the magic rain fall

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.200
Now under the rainbow

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.120
We fly to the sun

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:43.720
Hear the whisper of wind beneath the blue sky

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:49.780
We live in miracles every minute of the day

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.660
Rising to become the one

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.640
That you are dreaming of

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.480
You'll be free to spread your wings

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.840
Your dream takes you anywhere

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.580
Rise and take deep breath

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.360
You're leaving the world behind

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.000
To the place you dreamed

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.600
Along the way you light the way

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.920
Everywhere you go

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.900
Let's dance in the wind

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.580
And the birds will be singing along

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.640
Sound of the breeze

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.700
And the sparkle of rain

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.700
How beautiful

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.880
If you believe the world

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.860
You can Fly

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:45.020
Out to the sky

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.140
If you listen,

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.120
You hear the stars whispering

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.020
If you remember

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.240
There's magic everywhere

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.000
Drop of rain become a sea

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.140
I'm swimming across the sea

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.700
Deep inside my heart I sank

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.940
My doubts and my fears

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.740
Take a deep breath again

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.360
And follow my heart

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.140
Still looking for

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.740
My story happy ever after

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:32.120
Everyday the sun will be lighting your way

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:38.400
And the flowers will bloom as you go

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.740
And in the night

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.580
You hear a lullaby

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.760
The stars shine bright

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.640
If your heart believes, you can fly

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.760
Out to the sky

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.720
Everywhere you go

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.620
Let's dance in the wind

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:36.240
And the birds will be singing along

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.380
Sound of the breeze

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.420
And the sparkle of rain

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.320
How beautiful

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.700
If you believe the world

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.500
You can Fly

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:57.470
Out to the sky
