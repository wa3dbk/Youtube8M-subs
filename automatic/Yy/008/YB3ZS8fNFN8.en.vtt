 video description 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.530
 actually the answer to your question is on 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.300
 this site go to phased 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.579
 explanation if you only need voices 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.820
 and do not need to change the interface do 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.570
 only stb-1 and actually everything if you 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.820
 need more 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.640
 English interface will need to be 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.530
 make two more personal degree of cunning 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.559
 if you find english just go through 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.500
 you can figure it out on the site 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.899
 the video with you was gemius end link and 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.270
 if you donâ€™t know English 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.320
 want to do so to American 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.080
 fighters yelled 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.229
 in the heat of battle in their own language 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.420
 Look here in the first place why such 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.460
 the situation arose just because 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.650
 when battle 3 came out Russian-speaking 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.790
 versions cost less and many 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.530
 online stores were selling 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.630
 Russian version and then offered 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.970
 Here are the options IMF in short to 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.070
 actually bathe them or save 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.740
 except it was quite big because 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.950
 the Russian version was cheaper so 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.110
 here 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:39.159
 what do you need to do if you want 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:41.289
 full defecation you have with me 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:43.149
 go through these three steps if this is for you 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:47.469
 it will not be enough just to download 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:49.720

 in any place there will be an archive 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:58.810
 definitely much more parts and remove 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:02.140
 his papus battlefield 3 date 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:05.200
 win32 localization all actually no 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.569
 tricks just extract in my opinion he 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.229
 asks only that one which the file 

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:10.959
 can replace 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.940
 replace nothing but nothing 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:16.299
 delete simply replace the files that 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:18.280
 he will ask everything in the game you will appear in 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:21.400
 The main menu sound settings you have 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.410
 It will be possible to choose which 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.650
 choose voices russian or english 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.000

 no tricks in it there if you 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.680
 want to completely block the interface 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:44.920

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:47.370
 this link when he cured you 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:52.500
 there will be several ways 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.500
 first way to manually change the register 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.890
 second way to download small 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.850
 program which actually does 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:03.260
 the same and the third way is 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.750
 download vip-file 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.700
 Well, he is actually here for this reference 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.490

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.320
 all the way here is a brief instruction how 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:14.260
 do it but of course easier to download 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.370
 the program that make you here 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.960
 Windows program is my own 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.360
 I remember so there are no underwater 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:22.490
 no stones she does not enter anything 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.980
 the worst will not be the only negative 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:27.380
 full interface gasification is that 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.660
 after each patch you have to 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:32.630

 screen when you try to enter the game 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:42.530
 Well, actually everything is probably on it 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:45.170

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:49.160
