alright<00:00:21.910> so<00:00:22.270> in<00:00:22.750> another<00:00:22.930> video<00:00:23.230> we<00:00:23.350> talked

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:23.560 
alright so in another video we talked

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:24.840 
alright so in another video we talked
about<00:00:23.619> the<00:00:23.830> mechanics<00:00:24.250> of<00:00:24.340> the<00:00:24.430> single<00:00:24.730> leg

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:24.850 
about the mechanics of the single leg

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:27.210 
about the mechanics of the single leg
squat<00:00:25.210> and<00:00:25.510> I<00:00:25.810> also<00:00:25.960> have<00:00:26.200> a<00:00:26.260> longer<00:00:26.529> like<00:00:26.800> 15

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:27.220 
squat and I also have a longer like 15

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:28.650 
squat and I also have a longer like 15
minute<00:00:27.490> video<00:00:27.730> that<00:00:27.820> has<00:00:28.210> all<00:00:28.420> this<00:00:28.599> stuff

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:28.660 
minute video that has all this stuff

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.839 
minute video that has all this stuff
packed<00:00:29.080> together<00:00:29.320> if<00:00:29.619> you<00:00:29.710> just<00:00:29.920> want<00:00:30.160> like<00:00:30.250> to

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:30.849 
packed together if you just want like to

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:33.930 
packed together if you just want like to
give<00:00:31.000> it<00:00:31.090> the<00:00:31.150> original<00:00:31.630> ramble<00:00:32.470> but<00:00:32.700> I<00:00:33.700> want

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:33.940 
give it the original ramble but I want

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.090 
give it the original ramble but I want
to<00:00:34.000> focus<00:00:34.090> in<00:00:34.390> on<00:00:34.660> developing<00:00:35.559> the<00:00:35.680> single<00:00:35.980> leg

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.100 
to focus in on developing the single leg

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.830 
to focus in on developing the single leg
squat<00:00:36.430> a<00:00:36.610> lot<00:00:36.760> of<00:00:36.850> people<00:00:37.120> think<00:00:37.300> this<00:00:37.390> is<00:00:37.449> cool

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:37.840 
squat a lot of people think this is cool

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.260 
squat a lot of people think this is cool
and<00:00:38.170> it's<00:00:38.500> fun<00:00:38.590> and<00:00:39.340> if<00:00:39.640> you<00:00:39.730> don't<00:00:39.879> have<00:00:40.059> any

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:40.270 
and it's fun and if you don't have any

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.210 
and it's fun and if you don't have any
knee<00:00:40.420> problems<00:00:41.050> you<00:00:41.230> don't<00:00:41.410> have<00:00:41.530> like<00:00:41.739> torn

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:42.220 
knee problems you don't have like torn

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:43.710 
knee problems you don't have like torn
meniscus<00:00:42.309> or<00:00:42.790> anything<00:00:42.970> like<00:00:43.269> that<00:00:43.300> no

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:43.720 
meniscus or anything like that no

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.780 
meniscus or anything like that no
mechanical<00:00:44.290> defects<00:00:44.710> and<00:00:45.250> the<00:00:45.400> physical

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:45.790 
mechanical defects and the physical

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:47.729 
mechanical defects and the physical
structure<00:00:46.150> of<00:00:46.180> the<00:00:46.269> knee<00:00:46.420> itself<00:00:46.780> then

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:47.739 
structure of the knee itself then

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:49.439 
structure of the knee itself then
there's<00:00:47.980> really<00:00:48.190> not<00:00:48.489> any<00:00:48.730> good<00:00:48.970> reason<00:00:49.300> why

00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:49.449 
there's really not any good reason why

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:51.900 
there's really not any good reason why
you<00:00:49.480> shouldn't<00:00:50.100> consider<00:00:51.100> training<00:00:51.580> for<00:00:51.790> this

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:51.910 
you shouldn't consider training for this

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.180 
you shouldn't consider training for this
if<00:00:52.180> you<00:00:52.300> think<00:00:52.510> it's<00:00:52.660> cool<00:00:52.899> I<00:00:53.739> would<00:00:54.040> caution

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
if you think it's cool I would caution

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.430 
if you think it's cool I would caution
people<00:00:54.460> with<00:00:54.700> torn<00:00:54.940> minutes<00:00:55.210> guys<00:00:55.450> that<00:00:55.870> is

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
people with torn minutes guys that is

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.180 
people with torn minutes guys that is
probably<00:00:56.739> not<00:00:57.010> the<00:00:57.130> best<00:00:57.160> idea<00:00:57.520> I<00:00:58.829> just<00:00:59.829> don't

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
probably not the best idea I just don't

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.560 
probably not the best idea I just don't
think<00:01:00.430> that<00:01:00.489> there's<00:01:00.730> much<00:01:01.059> for<00:01:01.270> you<00:01:01.360> to<00:01:01.450> gain

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.570 
think that there's much for you to gain

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.330 
think that there's much for you to gain
out<00:01:01.780> of<00:01:01.809> it<00:01:01.989> and<00:01:02.260> there's<00:01:02.440> a<00:01:02.500> lot<00:01:02.710> of<00:01:02.800> risk<00:01:03.010> you

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:03.340 
out of it and there's a lot of risk you

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.150 
out of it and there's a lot of risk you
you<00:01:03.550> have<00:01:03.760> and<00:01:04.530> inherently<00:01:05.530> less<00:01:05.710> stable

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:06.160 
you have and inherently less stable

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.859 
you have and inherently less stable
meaning<00:01:06.399> and<00:01:06.700> you're<00:01:06.850> asking<00:01:07.210> it<00:01:07.450> to<00:01:07.570> perform

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:07.869 
meaning and you're asking it to perform

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:10.800 
meaning and you're asking it to perform
an<00:01:08.200> inherently<00:01:08.619> unstable<00:01:09.060> exercise<00:01:10.060> that's

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
an inherently unstable exercise that's

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.080 
an inherently unstable exercise that's
usually<00:01:11.170> not<00:01:11.200> a<00:01:11.350> good<00:01:11.590> idea<00:01:11.729> especially<00:01:12.729> when

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
usually not a good idea especially when

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:14.460 
usually not a good idea especially when
you<00:01:13.240> can<00:01:13.360> get<00:01:13.420> all<00:01:13.570> the<00:01:13.690> same<00:01:13.869> strength<00:01:14.289> from

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
you can get all the same strength from

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.499 
you can get all the same strength from
split<00:01:14.770> squats<00:01:15.130> and<00:01:15.430> everything<00:01:16.119> else<00:01:16.270> but

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:16.509 
split squats and everything else but

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:18.870 
split squats and everything else but
these<00:01:16.630> look<00:01:16.810> cool<00:01:17.020> so<00:01:17.289> if<00:01:17.380> you<00:01:17.500> want<00:01:17.740> it<00:01:17.880> you

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
these look cool so if you want it you

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.850 
these look cool so if you want it you
know<00:01:19.000> just<00:01:19.030> understand<00:01:19.960> you<00:01:20.259> do<00:01:20.619> have<00:01:20.830> a

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
know just understand you do have a

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.630 
know just understand you do have a
greater<00:01:21.100> risk<00:01:21.280> of<00:01:21.490> injury<00:01:23.340> which<00:01:24.340> is<00:01:24.430> why<00:01:24.610> I

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
greater risk of injury which is why I

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.219 
greater risk of injury which is why I
mean<00:01:24.909> I<00:01:24.970> can<00:01:25.150> do<00:01:25.210> these<00:01:25.330> on<00:01:25.510> my<00:01:25.630> left<00:01:25.840> leg<00:01:26.049> I'll

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.229 
mean I can do these on my left leg I'll

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:27.810 
mean I can do these on my left leg I'll
never<00:01:26.409> do<00:01:26.590> them<00:01:26.710> again<00:01:26.950> on<00:01:27.070> my<00:01:27.159> right<00:01:27.369> I<00:01:27.610> have<00:01:27.790> a

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 
never do them again on my right I have a

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.760 
never do them again on my right I have a
damaged<00:01:28.270> lateral<00:01:28.780> meniscus<00:01:28.960> why<00:01:29.409> should<00:01:29.650> I<00:01:29.710> do

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
damaged lateral meniscus why should I do

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.980 
damaged lateral meniscus why should I do
that<00:01:29.860> to<00:01:30.100> myself<00:01:30.250> that's<00:01:30.580> stupid<00:01:31.000> okay<00:01:31.720> so<00:01:31.810> I

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
that to myself that's stupid okay so I

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.190 
that to myself that's stupid okay so I
don't<00:01:33.420> you<00:01:34.420> have<00:01:34.510> to<00:01:34.570> be<00:01:34.630> smart<00:01:34.930> about<00:01:35.020> your

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
don't you have to be smart about your

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.679 
don't you have to be smart about your
training<00:01:35.560> so<00:01:36.009> butter<00:01:36.820> it<00:01:36.939> up<00:01:36.970> here<00:01:37.270> is<00:01:37.450> very

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:37.689 
training so butter it up here is very

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:39.330 
training so butter it up here is very
simple<00:01:37.990> and<00:01:38.200> should<00:01:38.350> be<00:01:38.439> pretty<00:01:38.710> obvious<00:01:39.100> when

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
simple and should be pretty obvious when

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:40.950 
simple and should be pretty obvious when
you're<00:01:39.520> squatting<00:01:39.729> on<00:01:39.970> one<00:01:40.180> leg<00:01:40.420> your<00:01:40.720> one<00:01:40.840> leg

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
you're squatting on one leg your one leg

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.230 
you're squatting on one leg your one leg
is<00:01:41.110> holding<00:01:41.439> your<00:01:41.590> entire<00:01:42.070> body<00:01:42.430> with<00:01:43.119> the

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
is holding your entire body with the

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.580 
is holding your entire body with the
exception<00:01:43.689> of<00:01:43.750> the<00:01:43.869> weight<00:01:44.020> of<00:01:44.049> the<00:01:44.200> lower<00:01:44.380> leg

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
exception of the weight of the lower leg

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.179 
exception of the weight of the lower leg
and<00:01:44.740> foot<00:01:44.979> and<00:01:46.830> what<00:01:47.830> that<00:01:47.979> means

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:48.189 
and foot and what that means

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:50.550 
and foot and what that means
realistically<00:01:49.090> if<00:01:49.240> you<00:01:49.360> multiply<00:01:49.990> that<00:01:50.259> is

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
realistically if you multiply that is

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.109 
realistically if you multiply that is
that<00:01:50.799> you<00:01:50.890> need<00:01:51.040> to<00:01:51.130> be<00:01:51.220> able<00:01:51.310> to<00:01:51.430> squat<00:01:51.729> twice

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
that you need to be able to squat twice

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:55.140 
that you need to be able to squat twice
your<00:01:52.360> body<00:01:52.540> weight<00:01:53.100> minus<00:01:54.100> the<00:01:54.759> weight<00:01:54.909> of

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.150 
your body weight minus the weight of

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.740 
your body weight minus the weight of
both<00:01:55.270> lower<00:01:55.540> legs<00:01:55.840> in<00:01:56.280> order<00:01:57.280> to<00:01:57.640> have<00:01:58.270> this<00:01:58.479> we

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
both lower legs in order to have this we

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.109 
both lower legs in order to have this we
have<00:01:58.810> the<00:01:59.049> strength<00:01:59.549> that<00:02:00.549> you<00:02:00.610> need<00:02:00.729> on<00:02:01.090> one

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 
have the strength that you need on one

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:03.359 
have the strength that you need on one
leg<00:02:01.479> right<00:02:01.720> it's<00:02:02.020> just<00:02:02.170> a<00:02:02.259> double<00:02:02.470> E<00:02:02.649> right

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
leg right it's just a double E right

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:05.550 
leg right it's just a double E right
which<00:02:03.520> means<00:02:03.759> that<00:02:04.090> if<00:02:04.930> you<00:02:04.990> want<00:02:05.229> to<00:02:05.320> go<00:02:05.409> the

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
which means that if you want to go the

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.620 
which means that if you want to go the
raw<00:02:05.680> strength<00:02:06.159> it's<00:02:06.610> a<00:02:06.790> really<00:02:07.090> good<00:02:07.240> idea<00:02:07.360> to

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
raw strength it's a really good idea to

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.199 
raw strength it's a really good idea to
use<00:02:07.930> bilateral<00:02:08.769> squats<00:02:09.160> right<00:02:09.310> the<00:02:09.670> common

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
use bilateral squats right the common

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.370 
use bilateral squats right the common
squat<00:02:10.750> and<00:02:11.730> if<00:02:12.730> you<00:02:13.030> know<00:02:13.450> how<00:02:13.720> to<00:02:13.780> learn<00:02:13.989> it<00:02:14.230> an

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
squat and if you know how to learn it an

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.410 
squat and if you know how to learn it an
Olympic<00:02:14.769> lifting<00:02:15.010> squat<00:02:15.430> is<00:02:15.730> going<00:02:16.150> to<00:02:16.299> be

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
Olympic lifting squat is going to be

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.840 
Olympic lifting squat is going to be
better<00:02:16.630> than<00:02:17.140> a<00:02:17.470> powerlifting<00:02:18.070> squat<00:02:18.459> but<00:02:18.670> not

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
better than a powerlifting squat but not

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.930 
better than a powerlifting squat but not
by<00:02:19.000> that<00:02:19.180> much<00:02:19.239> it<00:02:19.980> will<00:02:20.980> be<00:02:21.220> better<00:02:21.430> make<00:02:21.730> no

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
by that much it will be better make no

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.940 
by that much it will be better make no
mistake<00:02:22.390> just<00:02:23.260> not<00:02:23.560> by<00:02:23.769> a<00:02:23.799> huge<00:02:24.160> amount

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
mistake just not by a huge amount

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.760 
mistake just not by a huge amount
okay<00:02:25.190> so<00:02:25.940> either<00:02:26.209> way<00:02:26.390> is<00:02:26.540> fine<00:02:26.590> just<00:02:27.590> make

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
okay so either way is fine just make

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:29.559 
okay so either way is fine just make
sure<00:02:28.010> that<00:02:28.160> you<00:02:28.310> learn<00:02:28.520> how<00:02:28.790> to<00:02:28.819> hit<00:02:29.000> parallel

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
all of those muscles pretty well and

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.170 
all of those muscles pretty well and

to progress in weight now you can just
do<00:03:45.470> this<00:03:45.620> directly<00:03:45.920> but<00:03:46.670> know<00:03:46.880> that<00:03:46.910> you<00:03:47.299> are

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
do this directly but know that you are

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.120 
do this directly but know that you are
basically<00:03:47.900> training<00:03:48.530> close<00:03:48.859> to<00:03:49.010> your

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
basically training close to your

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:50.680 
basically training close to your
strengths<00:03:49.489> threshold<00:03:50.030> in<00:03:50.180> an<00:03:50.269> unstable

strengths threshold in an unstable

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.050 
strengths threshold in an unstable
environment<00:03:50.959> I<00:03:51.590> just<00:03:52.579> want<00:03:52.700> you<00:03:52.760> to<00:03:52.850> think

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
environment I just want you to think

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.020 
environment I just want you to think
about<00:03:53.269> that<00:03:53.450> do<00:03:53.840> you<00:03:53.870> want<00:03:54.290> to<00:03:54.500> train<00:03:54.859> in<00:03:55.819> an

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
about that do you want to train in an

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.240 
about that do you want to train in an
unstable<00:03:56.420> environment<00:03:56.889> close<00:03:57.889> to<00:03:58.130> your

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
unstable environment close to your

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.129 
unstable environment close to your
strength<00:03:58.549> threshold<00:03:59.060> or<00:03:59.420> do<00:03:59.690> you<00:03:59.780> want<00:04:00.019> to

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:00.139 
strength threshold or do you want to

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:02.379 
strength threshold or do you want to
train<00:04:00.410> in<00:04:00.590> an<00:04:00.680> unstable<00:04:01.069> environment<00:04:01.370> with<00:04:02.359> a

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:02.389 
train in an unstable environment with a

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:05.080 
train in an unstable environment with a
strength<00:04:02.810> surplus<00:04:03.620> that<00:04:03.859> ensures<00:04:04.370> somewhat

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
strength surplus that ensures somewhat

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.170 
strength surplus that ensures somewhat
better<00:04:05.299> stability<00:04:06.519> if<00:04:07.519> you<00:04:07.639> can't<00:04:07.849> figure<00:04:08.030> out

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
better stability if you can't figure out

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.289 
better stability if you can't figure out
what<00:04:08.450> I<00:04:08.480> think<00:04:08.950> I'll<00:04:09.950> spoil<00:04:10.340> it<00:04:10.549> for<00:04:10.579> you<00:04:10.819> you

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:11.299 
what I think I'll spoil it for you you

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:13.030 
what I think I'll spoil it for you you
should<00:04:11.480> be<00:04:11.569> training<00:04:11.900> with<00:04:12.170> a<00:04:12.230> surplus<00:04:12.650> and

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
should be training with a surplus and

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.370 
should be training with a surplus and
that<00:04:13.489> is<00:04:13.579> why<00:04:13.819> this<00:04:13.880> is<00:04:14.090> a<00:04:14.180> very<00:04:14.480> good<00:04:14.630> idea

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 
that is why this is a very good idea

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.610 
that is why this is a very good idea
you<00:04:15.769> should<00:04:16.130> really<00:04:16.489> consider<00:04:17.470> building<00:04:18.470> up

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
you should really consider building up

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.480 
you should really consider building up
to<00:04:18.950> I<00:04:19.489> would<00:04:19.910> say<00:04:19.940> at<00:04:20.269> least<00:04:20.299> 5<00:04:20.810> reps<00:04:21.139> with<00:04:21.919> your

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
to I would say at least 5 reps with your

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.850 
to I would say at least 5 reps with your
body<00:04:22.700> weight<00:04:23.000> on<00:04:23.210> a<00:04:23.330> barbell<00:04:23.960> because<00:04:24.710> what

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
body weight on a barbell because what

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:25.810 
body weight on a barbell because what
that<00:04:24.889> does<00:04:25.010> there's<00:04:25.430> something<00:04:25.639> called<00:04:25.729> a

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
that does there's something called a

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.550 
that does there's something called a
bilateral<00:04:26.210> deficit<00:04:26.750> when<00:04:26.960> you<00:04:27.110> do<00:04:27.229> something

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
bilateral deficit when you do something

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.950 
bilateral deficit when you do something
with<00:04:27.650> just<00:04:27.860> one<00:04:28.100> leg<00:04:28.340> you<00:04:28.610> get<00:04:28.790> a<00:04:29.030> bowel<00:04:29.600> I

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
with just one leg you get a bowel I

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.330 
with just one leg you get a bowel I
believe<00:04:30.290> it's<00:04:30.410> something<00:04:30.680> like<00:04:30.800> ten<00:04:31.160> percent

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
believe it's something like ten percent

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.990 
believe it's something like ten percent
more<00:04:32.380> strength<00:04:33.380> out<00:04:33.560> of<00:04:33.590> that<00:04:33.830> leg<00:04:34.580> or<00:04:34.850> arm

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
more strength out of that leg or arm

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.820 
more strength out of that leg or arm
than<00:04:35.750> you<00:04:35.840> do<00:04:35.960> if<00:04:36.050> you're<00:04:36.169> using<00:04:36.200> both<00:04:36.560> at<00:04:36.740> the

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
than you do if you're using both at the

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.860 
than you do if you're using both at the
same<00:04:37.040> time<00:04:37.370> so<00:04:37.850> we<00:04:37.970> need<00:04:38.090> to<00:04:38.180> build<00:04:38.389> that<00:04:38.570> in

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
same time so we need to build that in

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.020 
same time so we need to build that in
and<00:04:39.139> so<00:04:39.650> magically<00:04:40.250> that<00:04:40.760> kind<00:04:41.000> of

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
and so magically that kind of

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.180 
and so magically that kind of
compensates<00:04:41.690> for<00:04:41.960> that<00:04:42.350> whole<00:04:42.590> lower<00:04:42.950> leg

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
compensates for that whole lower leg

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.310 
compensates for that whole lower leg
taking<00:04:43.520> away<00:04:43.730> from<00:04:43.790> the<00:04:44.600> doubling<00:04:44.960> business

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320 
taking away from the doubling business

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.860 
taking away from the doubling business
of<00:04:45.530> bodyweight<00:04:45.889> -<00:04:46.220> out<00:04:46.880> of<00:04:46.910> the<00:04:47.090> leg<00:04:47.270> something

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
of bodyweight - out of the leg something

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.440 
of bodyweight - out of the leg something
like<00:04:47.990> that<00:04:48.230> so<00:04:49.010> just<00:04:49.040> keep<00:04:49.370> it<00:04:49.490> simple<00:04:49.700> if<00:04:50.300> you

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:50.450 
like that so just keep it simple if you

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:52.720 
like that so just keep it simple if you
can<00:04:50.480> do<00:04:50.750> five<00:04:51.050> to<00:04:51.230> six<00:04:51.470> reps<00:04:51.770> of<00:04:52.190> your

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:52.730 
can do five to six reps of your

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:53.350 
can do five to six reps of your
bodyweight

okay<00:04:58.120> you<00:04:59.120> will<00:04:59.240> not<00:04:59.540> have<00:04:59.930> a<00:04:59.960> big<00:05:00.290> problem

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 
okay you will not have a big problem

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.070 
okay you will not have a big problem

now<00:05:03.830> body<00:05:04.130> construction<00:05:04.760> as<00:05:04.970> we<00:05:05.180> talked<00:05:05.389> about

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:05.479 
now body construction as we talked about

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:07.210 
now body construction as we talked about
and<00:05:05.870> the<00:05:06.110> other<00:05:06.139> video<00:05:06.560> that<00:05:06.710> focuses<00:05:06.889> on

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:07.220 
and the other video that focuses on

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.000 
and the other video that focuses on
pistols<00:05:07.669> will<00:05:08.330> make<00:05:08.540> a<00:05:08.570> difference<00:05:08.990> but<00:05:09.860> if

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.010 
pistols will make a difference but if

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:11.350 
pistols will make a difference but if
you're<00:05:10.190> unable<00:05:10.370> to<00:05:10.550> do<00:05:10.910> things<00:05:11.180> because

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:11.360 
you're unable to do things because

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:12.909 
you're unable to do things because
you've<00:05:11.600> got<00:05:11.720> a<00:05:11.780> construction<00:05:12.440> that<00:05:12.560> really

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:12.919 
you've got a construction that really

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:14.200 
you've got a construction that really
doesn't<00:05:13.190> favor<00:05:13.430> being<00:05:13.729> able<00:05:13.850> to<00:05:13.970> do<00:05:14.090> these

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.210 
doesn't favor being able to do these

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:15.909 
doesn't favor being able to do these
without<00:05:14.479> weight<00:05:14.720> just<00:05:15.139> hold<00:05:15.410> it<00:05:15.530> weight<00:05:15.740> in

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:15.919 
without weight just hold it weight in

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:17.560 
without weight just hold it weight in
front<00:05:16.100> of<00:05:16.250> you<00:05:16.430> people<00:05:17.030> think<00:05:17.330> that<00:05:17.419> doing

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:17.570 
front of you people think that doing

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:19.180 
front of you people think that doing
things<00:05:17.780> with<00:05:17.930> extra<00:05:18.200> weight<00:05:18.320> is<00:05:18.470> cool<00:05:18.740> anyways

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:19.190 
things with extra weight is cool anyways

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:23.100 
things with extra weight is cool anyways
and<00:05:19.490> it<00:05:19.669> is<00:05:19.820> so<00:05:20.620> why<00:05:21.620> not<00:05:21.830> make<00:05:22.160> the<00:05:22.310> exercise

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.110 
and it is so why not make the exercise

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:25.060 
and it is so why not make the exercise
functionally<00:05:24.110> more<00:05:24.290> difficult<00:05:24.710> for<00:05:24.950> the

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.070 
functionally more difficult for the

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:27.210 
functionally more difficult for the
muscles<00:05:25.430> by<00:05:25.850> adding<00:05:26.150> weight<00:05:26.330> while<00:05:26.750> also

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:27.220 
muscles by adding weight while also

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.800 
muscles by adding weight while also
changing<00:05:28.220> physics<00:05:28.790> to<00:05:28.940> where<00:05:29.120> instead<00:05:29.570> of

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:29.810 
changing physics to where instead of

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:32.680 
changing physics to where instead of
falling<00:05:30.650> over<00:05:31.130> on<00:05:31.160> your<00:05:31.490> back<00:05:31.940> you<00:05:32.419> stay<00:05:32.660> on

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:32.690 
falling over on your back you stay on

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:34.150 
falling over on your back you stay on
your<00:05:32.870> feet<00:05:33.169> and<00:05:33.440> actually<00:05:33.770> complete<00:05:34.039> the

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:34.160

exercise appropriately without being in
an<00:05:36.560> extreme<00:05:36.919> situation<00:05:37.550> that<00:05:37.700> produces<00:05:38.450> just

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:38.690 
an extreme situation that produces just

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:41.320 
an extreme situation that produces just
ridiculous<00:05:39.289> amounts<00:05:39.620> of<00:05:39.680> joint<00:05:39.919> stress<00:05:40.330> right

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:41.330 
ridiculous amounts of joint stress right

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.980 
ridiculous amounts of joint stress right
all<00:05:41.690> the<00:05:41.930> strength<00:05:42.260> much<00:05:43.160> less<00:05:43.400> risk<00:05:43.990> smarter

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:44.990 
all the strength much less risk smarter

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:46.960 
all the strength much less risk smarter

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:50.419 
all about here and I don't know that's

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:52.060 
all about here and I don't know that's

these okay so here I just want to give a
quick<00:06:08.360> recap<00:06:09.039> of<00:06:10.039> everything<00:06:11.030> we<00:06:11.389> said

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:12.400 
quick recap of everything we said

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.379 
quick recap of everything we said
remember<00:06:13.400> what<00:06:13.520> we<00:06:13.580> just<00:06:13.610> talked<00:06:13.940> about<00:06:14.060> with

00:06:14.379 --> 00:06:14.389 
remember what we just talked about with

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:16.360 
remember what we just talked about with
all<00:06:14.510> the<00:06:14.630> body<00:06:14.750> mechanics<00:06:14.960> the<00:06:15.740> fix<00:06:16.039> if<00:06:16.220> you

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:16.370 
all the body mechanics the fix if you

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:18.129 
all the body mechanics the fix if you
have<00:06:16.580> less<00:06:16.760> favorable<00:06:17.270> body<00:06:17.450> mechanics<00:06:17.660> is

00:06:18.129 --> 00:06:18.139 
have less favorable body mechanics is

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:19.870 
have less favorable body mechanics is
very<00:06:18.320> simple<00:06:18.770> hold<00:06:19.310> weight

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:19.880 
very simple hold weight

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.120 
very simple hold weight
it<00:06:20.300> will<00:06:20.510> move<00:06:20.690> your<00:06:20.840> center<00:06:21.110> of<00:06:21.139> mass<00:06:21.260> forward

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:22.130 
it will move your center of mass forward

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:24.460 
it will move your center of mass forward
and<00:06:22.250> slightly<00:06:22.460> up<00:06:22.639> which<00:06:23.210> basically<00:06:23.690> is<00:06:24.080> going

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:24.470 
and slightly up which basically is going

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:26.409 
and slightly up which basically is going
to<00:06:24.680> keep<00:06:25.039> the<00:06:25.430> center<00:06:25.639> of<00:06:25.760> mass<00:06:25.910> over<00:06:26.300> your

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:26.419 
to keep the center of mass over your

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:28.629 
to keep the center of mass over your
foot<00:06:26.600> give<00:06:27.200> you<00:06:27.320> a<00:06:27.410> good<00:06:27.680> base<00:06:27.889> instead<00:06:28.490> of

00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:28.639 
foot give you a good base instead of

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:30.879 
foot give you a good base instead of
leaving<00:06:29.210> you<00:06:29.450> with<00:06:29.630> no<00:06:29.840> effective<00:06:30.530> base<00:06:30.650> at

00:06:30.879 --> 00:06:30.889 
leaving you with no effective base at

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:32.800 
leaving you with no effective base at
all<00:06:30.979> and<00:06:31.450> that's<00:06:32.450> going<00:06:32.630> to<00:06:32.690> be<00:06:32.750> the

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:32.810 
all and that's going to be the

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:33.909 
all and that's going to be the
difference<00:06:33.110> between<00:06:33.260> you<00:06:33.530> having<00:06:33.830> an

00:06:33.909 --> 00:06:33.919 
difference between you having an

00:06:33.919 --> 00:06:35.589 
difference between you having an
effective<00:06:34.340> workout<00:06:34.700> and<00:06:34.940> staying<00:06:35.389> on<00:06:35.539> your

00:06:35.589 --> 00:06:35.599 
effective workout and staying on your

00:06:35.599 --> 00:06:38.290 
effective workout and staying on your
feet<00:06:35.870> or<00:06:36.140> just<00:06:36.260> falling<00:06:36.950> over<00:06:37.070> and<00:06:37.400> feeling

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:38.300 
feet or just falling over and feeling

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:39.159 
feet or just falling over and feeling
dumb<00:06:38.510> and<00:06:38.750> wondering

00:06:39.159 --> 00:06:39.169 
dumb and wondering

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:44.050 
dumb and wondering
you<00:06:39.319> can't<00:06:39.529> do<00:06:39.680> pistols<00:06:42.669> for<00:06:43.669> a<00:06:43.699> fair<00:06:43.909> number

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:44.060 
you can't do pistols for a fair number

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:46.719 
you can't do pistols for a fair number
of<00:06:44.210> people<00:06:44.590> adding<00:06:45.590> the<00:06:45.680> weight<00:06:45.830> can<00:06:46.430> be<00:06:46.490> an

00:06:46.719 --> 00:06:46.729 
of people adding the weight can be an

00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:50.379 
of people adding the weight can be an
excellent<00:06:47.210> bridge<00:06:47.889> into<00:06:49.060> eventually<00:06:50.060> not

00:06:50.379 --> 00:06:50.389 
excellent bridge into eventually not

00:06:50.389 --> 00:06:51.519 
excellent bridge into eventually not
needing<00:06:50.749> the<00:06:50.840> weight<00:06:50.990> and<00:06:51.110> what<00:06:51.229> you<00:06:51.319> would<00:06:51.439> do

00:06:51.519 --> 00:06:51.529 
needing the weight and what you would do

00:06:51.529 --> 00:06:53.320 
needing the weight and what you would do
is<00:06:51.650> start<00:06:51.800> by<00:06:52.009> holding<00:06:52.129> late<00:06:52.460> far<00:06:52.729> away<00:06:52.969> and

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:53.330 
is start by holding late far away and

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:55.209 
is start by holding late far away and
instead<00:06:53.539> of<00:06:53.629> increasing<00:06:54.139> the<00:06:54.229> weight<00:06:54.409> you

00:06:55.209 --> 00:06:55.219 
instead of increasing the weight you

00:06:55.219 --> 00:06:57.550 
instead of increasing the weight you
would<00:06:55.550> hold<00:06:56.419> it<00:06:56.599> closer<00:06:56.840> and<00:06:57.139> closer<00:06:57.349> and

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:57.560 
would hold it closer and closer and

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:00.550 
would hold it closer and closer and
closer<00:06:57.740> to<00:06:58.009> your<00:06:58.129> body<00:06:58.249> and<00:06:59.289> eventually<00:07:00.289> over

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:00.560 
closer to your body and eventually over

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:03.159 
closer to your body and eventually over
time<00:07:00.590> learn<00:07:01.219> to<00:07:01.340> have<00:07:01.520> the<00:07:01.699> weight<00:07:01.909> like<00:07:02.689> above

00:07:03.159 --> 00:07:03.169 
time learn to have the weight like above

00:07:03.169 --> 00:07:06.909 
time learn to have the weight like above
your<00:07:03.379> head<00:07:03.650> and<00:07:05.050> like<00:07:06.050> sitting<00:07:06.439> on<00:07:06.590> your<00:07:06.740> head

00:07:06.909 --> 00:07:06.919 
your head and like sitting on your head

00:07:06.919 --> 00:07:08.469 
your head and like sitting on your head
like<00:07:07.129> we're<00:07:07.340> talking<00:07:07.610> like<00:07:07.729> 10<00:07:07.999> pounds

00:07:08.469 --> 00:07:08.479 
like we're talking like 10 pounds

00:07:08.479 --> 00:07:11.769 
like we're talking like 10 pounds
nothing<00:07:08.810> crazy<00:07:09.080> and<00:07:10.330> eventually<00:07:11.330> you<00:07:11.659> would

00:07:11.769 --> 00:07:11.779 
nothing crazy and eventually you would

00:07:11.779 --> 00:07:13.329 
nothing crazy and eventually you would
then<00:07:11.930> reduce<00:07:12.050> that<00:07:12.379> to<00:07:12.589> 9<00:07:12.770> pounds<00:07:13.129> 8<00:07:13.219> pounds

00:07:13.329 --> 00:07:13.339 
then reduce that to 9 pounds 8 pounds

00:07:13.339 --> 00:07:15.489 
then reduce that to 9 pounds 8 pounds
whatever<00:07:13.909> and<00:07:14.300> over<00:07:14.749> time<00:07:14.960> you'd<00:07:15.199> be<00:07:15.289> able<00:07:15.439> to

00:07:15.489 --> 00:07:15.499 
whatever and over time you'd be able to

00:07:15.499 --> 00:07:16.869 
whatever and over time you'd be able to
work<00:07:15.620> yourself<00:07:15.979> down<00:07:16.159> before<00:07:16.370> you<00:07:16.580> don't<00:07:16.759> need

00:07:16.869 --> 00:07:16.879 
work yourself down before you don't need

00:07:16.879 --> 00:07:18.879 
work yourself down before you don't need
the<00:07:16.969> weight<00:07:17.120> at<00:07:17.270> all<00:07:17.419> and<00:07:17.659> some<00:07:18.529> people<00:07:18.770> will

00:07:18.879 --> 00:07:18.889 
the weight at all and some people will

00:07:18.889 --> 00:07:20.350 
the weight at all and some people will
be<00:07:18.919> able<00:07:19.099> to<00:07:19.219> do<00:07:19.310> that<00:07:19.490> some<00:07:19.819> won't<00:07:20.029> so<00:07:20.330> don't

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:20.360 
be able to do that some won't so don't

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.510 
be able to do that some won't so don't
freak<00:07:20.779> out<00:07:20.900> either<00:07:21.110> way<00:07:21.349> you're<00:07:22.069> not<00:07:22.219> cheating

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:22.520 
freak out either way you're not cheating

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:23.860 
freak out either way you're not cheating
you're<00:07:22.699> not<00:07:23.029> doing<00:07:23.300> anything<00:07:23.509> wrong

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:23.870 
you're not doing anything wrong

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:25.719 
you're not doing anything wrong
sometimes<00:07:24.499> you<00:07:24.710> just<00:07:24.740> not<00:07:25.249> built<00:07:25.490> to<00:07:25.550> do

00:07:25.719 --> 00:07:25.729 
sometimes you just not built to do

00:07:25.729 --> 00:07:28.269 
sometimes you just not built to do
certain<00:07:25.969> things<00:07:26.529> without<00:07:27.529> a<00:07:27.560> counterbalance

00:07:28.269 --> 00:07:28.279 
certain things without a counterbalance

00:07:28.279 --> 00:07:31.599 
certain things without a counterbalance
so<00:07:29.120> use<00:07:29.389> one
