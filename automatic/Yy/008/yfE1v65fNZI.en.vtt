00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:07.940
introducing the HydraMat fuel reservoir Holley's
patent pending design that solves the problems

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:13.950
associated with traditional fuel pickups in
stock fuel tanks as well as racing fuel cells

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:20.010
during hard cornering acceleration stopping
inclines and low fuel conditions fuel runs

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.730
away from the fuel pickup which introduces
air into the system resulting in poor engine

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:31.119
performance and even stalling surface tension
and fluid wicking are the secrets of the HydraMats

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:37.380
amazing ability to draw fuel from nearly any
area that has contact with fuel as an area

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.790
of the HydraMat is uncovered the tiny pores
of the media seal off through surface tension

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.830
forcing fuel to be contained in the reservoir
and drawn from other areas of the mat where

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:53.890
fuel continues to be available the combination
of the wicking and surface tension maintains

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:59.550
the reservoir even under low fuel or gravitational
forces that would normally move the fuel away

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:09.690
from the pickup the fuel pump draws from the
HydraMats internal reservoir to maintain flow

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:15.150
while there is fuel in contact with the mat
as the fuel supply becomes low the internal

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.430
reservoir will gradually collapse until all
the fuel is consumed or the draw of the pump

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.560
overcomes the surface tension of the fuel
in the media the shear size and coverage area

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.290
of the HydraMat allows it to pull fuel from
virtually any area in the tank or cell eliminating

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:37.800
the need for specialty reservoirs and pickup
pumps saving cost and greatly reducing complexity

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.640
this larger surface area also reduces the
fuel velocity through the mat which maintains

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.300
the necessary surface tension to resist air
intrusion into the fuel pump the HydraMat

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:54.840
will be available in various sizes to accommodate
different tank sizes and openings square rectangular

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.640
and X shaped mats will be available to provide
easy installation through various sending

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.580
unit access holes or fuel cell cover plates
retro fit devices will be available for stock

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:11.239
tank vehicles to ease installation of aftermarket
EFI retrofit kits like the Holley Terminator

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:26.680
EFI system 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.889
I'm Grayling Call director of competition
and race technology for ARCA Holley has come

00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:39.129
out with a fuel blanket that I have tested
on 33 degrees of banking with 1 gallon of

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:44.040
fuel in the fuel cell the way we started this
test was we drained all the fuel out of the

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:51.099
fuel cell run the car completely out of fuel
put 1 gallon in a 22 gallon fuel cell ran

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:59.060
the car 4 laps on a half mile track sat it
at the top of 33 degree banking for 5 minutes

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:05.879
the car never lost fuel pressure did 4 more
laps on the half mile track and brought the

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:12.980
car to pit road with no drop of fuel pressure
what so ever the new blanket from Holley has

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:18.659
really proven something to me that I did not
believe in when we started this project when

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:24.150
you folks at Holley first brought this to
my attention I got to be honest with ya I

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:29.230
was on the other end laughing because I'm
thinking there is no way that something like

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:39.359
this is gonna fix a situation that I lived
very close to for a very long period time

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:47.680
for about 14 years but for the last 5 or 6
years I watched the fuel injection situation

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:56.109
revolve and actually run into a lot of extra
effort and cost and work and all that where

00:03:56.109 --> 00:04:03.239
fuel injection started with fuel pickup and
delivery versus where it can get now with

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:19.259
the blanket is unbelievable I am very impressed
with the blanket it definitely is a good piece

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:25.419

and future availability on the a amazing HydraMat
