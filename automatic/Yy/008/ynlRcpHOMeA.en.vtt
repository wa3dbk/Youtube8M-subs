00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:10.830
 and that game is back when not 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:13.710
 there was still gt game that made mothers 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.389
 lost hair and players 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.400
 play hide and seek 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.250
 The game was banned in Brazil at the time. 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.080
 Carmageddon face where it's back and gone 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.699
 is available in steam 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.820
 they made this trailer all cute 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.550
 and all controversial to try to show that 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.470
 no we 're evil we 're more 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.620
 dangerous that man dta they will not 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.329
 to be more violent than gta 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.250
 but they made this trailer that 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.640
 scare is a totally trailer 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:45.450
 politically incorrect that the bus 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.309
 schoolboy full of blood run over guard 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.840
 transit and children without belt 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.160
 security stays on the street and even 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:56.010
 old ladies will see you soon 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.440
 Look at the face, I think it's me. 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.329
 surprises more than the pt still but the 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.180
 game itself is not all that he 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.860
 show him this game trying 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.409
 surprise people 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.570
 but I imagined a lot of people imagined it too 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.640
 that it would be a game that would try to be the 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.970
 Open world just like gta but will see 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.759
 which is a very simple style of play and 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.110
 maybe even made the pieces then this 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.490
 game is now available on steam 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:25.979
 wrote some of the gameplay now 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:28.470
 take a look at the style of the game maps 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:32.009
 they are small they have nothing more than 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.500
 car crash and triangulating guys 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.960
 there in the middle of the stage without much sense and 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.479
 You have to run over and everybody dude. 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.079
 very badly done that the cars 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:45.000
 are slipping legendar is the case of 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.040
 renation that this attempt to 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.570
 back to the golden season of the car helped 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.960
 but I think they will not get 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.960
 not
