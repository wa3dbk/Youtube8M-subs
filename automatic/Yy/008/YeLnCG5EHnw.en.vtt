but<00:02:10.259> if<00:02:10.380> you<00:02:10.500> actually<00:02:10.740> measured<00:02:11.280> it<00:02:11.400> there's

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
but if you actually measured it there's

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.430 
but if you actually measured it there's
never<00:02:11.850> a<00:02:12.000> flat<00:02:12.300> spot<00:02:12.630> so<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:13.020> board<00:02:13.260> works

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
never a flat spot so the board works

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.030 
never a flat spot so the board works
very<00:02:13.650> well<00:02:13.740> in<00:02:14.010> flames<00:02:14.430> of<00:02:14.730> any<00:02:14.910> size<00:02:15.240> that

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
very well in flames of any size that

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.480 
very well in flames of any size that
have<00:02:17.040> a<00:02:17.280> pocket<00:02:17.820> this<00:02:18.720> specific<00:02:19.410> one<00:02:19.560> is<00:02:19.740> 5<00:02:20.010> 11

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
have a pocket this specific one is 5 11

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.780 
have a pocket this specific one is 5 11
18<00:02:20.970> and<00:02:21.150> 1/8<00:02:21.450> -<00:02:21.810> and<00:02:21.959> 1/16<00:02:22.650> you're<00:02:23.490> supposed<00:02:23.760> to

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
18 and 1/8 - and 1/16 you're supposed to

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.640 
18 and 1/8 - and 1/16 you're supposed to
ride<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.120> proton<00:02:24.540> slightly<00:02:25.110> thinner<00:02:25.410> because

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
ride the proton slightly thinner because

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.949 
ride the proton slightly thinner because
it<00:02:25.860> is<00:02:25.950> a<00:02:25.980> very<00:02:26.160> flat<00:02:26.610> dome<00:02:26.970> deck<00:02:27.390> and<00:02:27.660> a<00:02:27.690> full

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
it is a very flat dome deck and a full

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:29.780 
it is a very flat dome deck and a full
rail<00:02:28.230> so<00:02:28.740> this<00:02:28.860> is<00:02:28.950> pretty<00:02:29.130> much<00:02:29.220> exactly<00:02:29.580> what

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
rail so this is pretty much exactly what

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.729 
rail so this is pretty much exactly what
our<00:02:29.910> drives<00:02:30.209> standard<00:02:31.080> with<00:02:31.230> a<00:02:31.260> pretty<00:02:31.440> tight

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
our drives standard with a pretty tight

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:33.410 
our drives standard with a pretty tight
squash<00:02:32.130> so<00:02:32.489> it<00:02:32.580> handles<00:02:32.880> really<00:02:32.910> provides

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
squash so it handles really provides

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.590 
squash so it handles really provides
variety<00:02:33.900> of<00:02:33.930> ways<00:02:35.000> Swach<00:02:36.000> Hill<00:02:36.239> that<00:02:36.420> gives

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
variety of ways Swach Hill that gives

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.290 
variety of ways Swach Hill that gives
you<00:02:36.780> that<00:02:37.350> free<00:02:37.860> movement<00:02:38.850> with<00:02:38.970> a<00:02:39.030> little<00:02:39.180> bit

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
you that free movement with a little bit

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.330 
you that free movement with a little bit
more<00:02:39.480> area<00:02:39.780> behind<00:02:39.959> your<00:02:40.230> back<00:02:40.410> foot<00:02:40.739> but<00:02:41.160> it's

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
more area behind your back foot but it's

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.949 
more area behind your back foot but it's
pulled<00:02:41.520> pretty<00:02:41.850> tight<00:02:42.209> so<00:02:42.450> it's<00:02:42.600> gonna<00:02:42.720> hold

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
pulled pretty tight so it's gonna hold

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.199 
pulled pretty tight so it's gonna hold
low<00:02:43.230> relatively<00:02:44.160> hard<00:02:44.489> edge<00:02:44.640> leading<00:02:44.940> up<00:02:45.180> the

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
low relatively hard edge leading up the

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.040 
low relatively hard edge leading up the
board<00:02:45.600> and<00:02:45.930> a<00:02:46.709> lot<00:02:46.770> of<00:02:47.100> concave<00:02:47.840> this<00:02:48.840> seams

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
board and a lot of concave this seams

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.660 
board and a lot of concave this seams
have<00:02:49.140> been<00:02:49.290> working<00:02:49.590> well<00:02:49.709> with<00:02:50.130> me<00:02:50.280> lately<00:02:50.310> a

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
have been working well with me lately a

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.000 
have been working well with me lately a
little<00:02:51.090> bit<00:02:51.180> heavier<00:02:51.480> on<00:02:51.570> the<00:02:51.690> feet<00:02:52.050> so<00:02:52.620> having

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
little bit heavier on the feet so having

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.740 
little bit heavier on the feet so having
a<00:02:53.220> central<00:02:53.640> contact<00:02:54.030> that's<00:02:54.239> pretty<00:02:54.450> deep

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
a central contact that's pretty deep

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.090 
a central contact that's pretty deep
throughout<00:02:55.500> the<00:02:55.650> board<00:02:57.320> two<00:02:58.320> great<00:02:58.650> boards

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
throughout the board two great boards

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.010 
throughout the board two great boards
and<00:02:59.640> we'll<00:02:59.730> be<00:02:59.820> back<00:02:59.970> tomorrow<00:03:00.209> to<00:03:00.600> talk<00:03:00.810> about

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
and we'll be back tomorrow to talk about

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.440 
and we'll be back tomorrow to talk about
two<00:03:01.200> more
