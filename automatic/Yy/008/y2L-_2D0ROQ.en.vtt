importance of sleep when it comes to the

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:19.950 
importance of sleep when it comes to the
importance<00:00:19.150> of<00:00:19.270> sleep<00:00:19.390> through<00:00:19.630> them<00:00:19.780> and<00:00:19.869> I

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:19.960 
importance of sleep through them and I

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.189 
importance of sleep through them and I
addressed<00:00:20.320> this<00:00:20.440> with<00:00:21.300> kind<00:00:22.300> of<00:00:22.390> well<00:00:23.170> a

only a few hours of solid sleep I was

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.299 
only a few hours of solid sleep I was
learning<00:00:41.530> if<00:00:41.829> you<00:00:41.920> could<00:00:42.039> address<00:00:42.129> the

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:42.309 
learning if you could address the

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:43.680

importance of sleep as well as any of
the<00:00:43.870> strategies<00:00:44.289> you<00:00:44.440> may<00:00:44.589> be<00:00:45.039> able<00:00:45.159> to<00:00:45.370> share

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:45.639 
the strategies you may be able to share

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:48.479 
the strategies you may be able to share
on<00:00:45.760> getting<00:00:46.059> better<00:00:46.210> sleep<00:00:46.539> okay<00:00:47.499> so<00:00:48.100> sleep<00:00:48.370> is

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:48.489 
on getting better sleep okay so sleep is

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:50.250 
on getting better sleep okay so sleep is
important<00:00:48.940> that's<00:00:49.059> where<00:00:49.329> our<00:00:49.359> bodies<00:00:49.960> grow

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.260 
important that's where our bodies grow

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.309 
important that's where our bodies grow
repair<00:00:50.799> degenerates<00:00:51.489> and<00:00:51.699> learn<00:00:51.969> right<00:00:52.359> or

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:53.319 
repair degenerates and learn right or

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:54.899 
repair degenerates and learn right or
consolidate<00:00:54.069> learning<00:00:54.429> so<00:00:54.670> for<00:00:54.879> instance

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:54.909 
consolidate learning so for instance

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:56.699 
consolidate learning so for instance
from<00:00:55.179> a<00:00:55.329> brain<00:00:55.600> perspective<00:00:56.199> when<00:00:56.350> you<00:00:56.469> read

from a brain perspective when you read

00:00:56.709 --> 00:00:57.989 
from a brain perspective when you read
things<00:00:57.010> and<00:00:57.219> learn<00:00:57.339> new<00:00:57.519> things<00:00:57.549> during<00:00:57.909> a

when you're your brain is starting to

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.300 
when you're your brain is starting to
consolidate<00:01:04.989> all<00:01:05.019> that<00:01:05.199> information<00:01:05.470> that's

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 
consolidate all that information that's

baby you'll notice that being a sip for
a<00:01:26.350> long<00:01:26.470> period<00:01:26.650> of<00:01:26.800> time<00:01:26.860> is<00:01:27.160> because<00:01:27.340> they're

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
a long period of time is because they're

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.900 
a long period of time is because they're
growing<00:01:28.150> and<00:01:28.950> you<00:01:29.950> know<00:01:30.040> repairing<00:01:30.580> and

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:30.910 
growing and you know repairing and

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.000 
growing and you know repairing and
building<00:01:31.600> new<00:01:31.690> things<00:01:31.990> master<00:01:32.260> all<00:01:32.620> happens

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.010 
building new things master all happens

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:34.950 
building new things master all happens
that's<00:01:33.160> what<00:01:33.250> all<00:01:33.370> happens<00:01:33.790> in<00:01:33.940> the<00:01:34.030> sleep<00:01:34.270> so

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
that's what all happens in the sleep so

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.280 
that's what all happens in the sleep so
by<00:01:35.680> getting<00:01:35.740> more<00:01:36.220> sleep<00:01:36.370> when<00:01:36.670> you're<00:01:36.790> young

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
by getting more sleep when you're young

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.810 
by getting more sleep when you're young
that's<00:01:38.290> when<00:01:38.590> all<00:01:38.620> that<00:01:38.860> growth<00:01:39.160> happens<00:01:39.610> when

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
that's when all that growth happens when

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.010 
that's when all that growth happens when
you're<00:01:39.940> older<00:01:40.330> you<00:01:40.540> know<00:01:40.630> and<00:01:40.750> you're<00:01:40.900> like

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
you're older you know and you're like

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.800 
you're older you know and you're like
you<00:01:41.320> know<00:01:41.350> 80s<00:01:41.950> and<00:01:42.100> 90s<00:01:42.600> generally<00:01:43.600> there's

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
you know 80s and 90s generally there's

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.570 
you know 80s and 90s generally there's
less<00:01:43.990> sleep<00:01:44.290> right<00:01:44.500> you're<00:01:44.680> sleeping<00:01:45.010> 56

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580 
less sleep right you're sleeping 56

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.260 
less sleep right you're sleeping 56
hours<00:01:45.700> maybe<00:01:47.700> because<00:01:48.700> there's<00:01:48.850> not<00:01:48.940> as<00:01:49.120> much

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
hours maybe because there's not as much

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.570 
hours maybe because there's not as much
repair<00:01:49.720> and<00:01:50.050> girls<00:01:50.320> that's<00:01:50.470> happening<00:01:51.010> so

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.580 
repair and girls that's happening so

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.040 
repair and girls that's happening so
let's<00:01:51.700> just<00:01:51.940> kind<00:01:52.060> of<00:01:52.150> like<00:01:52.330> the<00:01:52.450> life<00:01:52.600> cycle

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
let's just kind of like the life cycle

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:54.960 
let's just kind of like the life cycle
of<00:01:53.080> what<00:01:53.230> happens<00:01:53.590> but<00:01:54.100> if<00:01:54.250> you're<00:01:54.400> working<00:01:54.790> at

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
of what happens but if you're working at

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.340 
of what happens but if you're working at
your<00:01:55.240> time<00:01:55.630> work<00:01:55.810> from<00:01:55.900> a<00:01:56.050> workout

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
your time work from a workout

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.050 
your time work from a workout
perspective<00:01:56.590> here<00:01:56.980> when<00:01:57.490> you're<00:01:57.610> working<00:01:57.790> on

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
perspective here when you're working on

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.030 
perspective here when you're working on
is<00:01:58.180> really<00:01:58.570> important<00:01:59.020> to<00:01:59.080> rest<00:01:59.530> and<00:01:59.800> recover

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.040 
is really important to rest and recover

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.100 
is really important to rest and recover
and<00:02:00.670> I've<00:02:01.060> talked<00:02:01.240> about<00:02:01.420> this<00:02:01.510> a<00:02:01.570> lot<00:02:01.780> is<00:02:01.990> you

and I've talked about this a lot is you

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:02.969 
and I've talked about this a lot is you
know<00:02:02.200> you<00:02:02.260> don't<00:02:02.320> want<00:02:02.500> to<00:02:02.530> work<00:02:02.680> out<00:02:02.740> seven

know you don't want to work out seven

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:04.290 
know you don't want to work out seven
days<00:02:03.100> a<00:02:03.220> week<00:02:03.310> you're<00:02:03.729> going<00:02:03.850> to<00:02:03.909> break<00:02:04.000> down

body a good time to rebuild and repair

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.640 
body a good time to rebuild and repair
the<00:02:11.950> muscles<00:02:12.570> especially<00:02:13.570> in<00:02:14.020> that<00:02:14.110> stage<00:02:14.350> for

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
the muscles especially in that stage for

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.590 
the muscles especially in that stage for
deep<00:02:14.860> sleep<00:02:15.190> is<00:02:15.340> really<00:02:15.370> important<00:02:16.060> so<00:02:16.540> you

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
deep sleep is really important so you

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.060 
deep sleep is really important so you
want<00:02:16.840> to<00:02:16.900> do<00:02:17.200> things<00:02:17.440> that<00:02:17.530> are<00:02:17.620> going<00:02:17.740> to<00:02:17.800> help

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
want to do things that are going to help

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.360 
want to do things that are going to help
you<00:02:18.280> get<00:02:18.580> proper<00:02:19.090> sleep<00:02:20.100> finally<00:02:21.100> from<00:02:21.250> a

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
you get proper sleep finally from a

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:22.470 
you get proper sleep finally from a
weight<00:02:21.550> loss<00:02:21.700> perspective<00:02:22.330> this<00:02:22.420> is

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
weight loss perspective this is

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.740 
weight loss perspective this is
important<00:02:23.050> because<00:02:24.300> survivors<00:02:25.300> making<00:02:25.570> some

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
important because survivors making some

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.050 
important because survivors making some
oatmeal<00:02:25.870> so<00:02:26.320> there's<00:02:26.860> pretty<00:02:27.820> some<00:02:27.910> oatmeal

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
oatmeal so there's pretty some oatmeal

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.520 
oatmeal so there's pretty some oatmeal
kind<00:02:28.420> of<00:02:28.480> spilling<00:02:28.900> over<00:02:28.930> the<00:02:29.020> pot<00:02:29.290> hopefully

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
kind of spilling over the pot hopefully

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.620 
kind of spilling over the pot hopefully
this<00:02:29.770> will<00:02:29.860> crazy<00:02:30.190> and<00:02:31.030> it's<00:02:31.240> not<00:02:31.360> from<00:02:31.540> a

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
this will crazy and it's not from a

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.290 
this will crazy and it's not from a
weight<00:02:31.780> loss<00:02:31.930> perspective<00:02:33.240> there's<00:02:34.240> a

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
weight loss perspective there's a

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.660 
weight loss perspective there's a
hormone<00:02:34.720> called<00:02:34.750> ghrelin<00:02:35.200> right<00:02:35.920> thats<00:02:36.220> pissy

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
hormone called ghrelin right thats pissy

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.120 
hormone called ghrelin right thats pissy
tells<00:02:36.970> the<00:02:37.090> body<00:02:37.270> that<00:02:37.540> is<00:02:37.630> hungry<00:02:37.990> and

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
tells the body that is hungry and

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.170 
tells the body that is hungry and
studies<00:02:39.130> have<00:02:39.250> shown<00:02:39.280> that<00:02:39.490> when<00:02:39.970> you're

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
studies have shown that when you're

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.660 
studies have shown that when you're
sleep<00:02:40.510> deprived<00:02:40.930> you<00:02:41.710> know<00:02:41.800> can<00:02:42.040> just<00:02:42.070> be<00:02:42.370> one

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
sleep deprived you know can just be one

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.040 
sleep deprived you know can just be one
night<00:02:42.850> read<00:02:43.090> sleep<00:02:43.360> deprivation<00:02:43.510> or<00:02:43.960> not

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
night read sleep deprivation or not

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.040 
night read sleep deprivation or not
sleeping<00:02:44.470> well<00:02:45.330> ghrelin<00:02:46.330> levels<00:02:46.360> in<00:02:46.930> the

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
sleeping well ghrelin levels in the

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.140 
sleeping well ghrelin levels in the
blood<00:02:47.290> increase<00:02:47.680> which<00:02:48.010> basically<00:02:48.310> has<00:02:48.880> shown

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
blood increase which basically has shown

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.840 
blood increase which basically has shown
to<00:02:49.680> kind<00:02:50.680> of<00:02:50.710> tell<00:02:50.890> the<00:02:50.980> brain<00:02:51.220> I<00:02:51.400> have<00:02:51.640> found

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
to kind of tell the brain I have found

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.970 
to kind of tell the brain I have found
this<00:02:52.120> that<00:02:52.810> yes<00:02:53.260> you're<00:02:53.440> hungry<00:02:53.740> so<00:02:53.800> you

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
this that yes you're hungry so you

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.800 
this that yes you're hungry so you
increase<00:02:54.370> your<00:02:54.460> food<00:02:54.670> intake<00:02:54.820> so<00:02:55.570> a<00:02:55.600> lot<00:02:55.780> of

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
increase your food intake so a lot of

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.300 
increase your food intake so a lot of
studies<00:02:56.200> show<00:02:56.350> that<00:02:56.380> it<00:02:56.620> was<00:02:56.740> sleep<00:02:57.100> in

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
studies show that it was sleep in

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.880 
studies show that it was sleep in
adequate<00:02:57.550> sleep<00:02:57.790> or<00:02:58.120> sleep<00:02:58.780> deprivation<00:02:58.960> you

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
adequate sleep or sleep deprivation you

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.380 
adequate sleep or sleep deprivation you
get<00:03:00.010> higher<00:03:00.280> levels<00:03:00.580> of<00:03:00.640> ghrelin<00:03:00.910> the<00:03:01.060> blood

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
get higher levels of ghrelin the blood

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.260 
get higher levels of ghrelin the blood
which<00:03:01.990> can<00:03:02.170> lead<00:03:02.320> to<00:03:02.520> one<00:03:03.520> CT<00:03:03.850> you've<00:03:04.090> more

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
which can lead to one CT you've more

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:05.700 
which can lead to one CT you've more
often<00:03:04.570> which<00:03:04.750> is<00:03:04.900> also<00:03:05.080> correlate<00:03:05.590> is

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:05.710 
often which is also correlate is

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:07.140 
often which is also correlate is
obviously<00:03:06.040> to<00:03:06.190> gain<00:03:06.340> more<00:03:06.580> weight<00:03:06.640> or<00:03:06.790> obesity

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
obviously to gain more weight or obesity

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.330 
obviously to gain more weight or obesity
so<00:03:08.110> from<00:03:08.380> a<00:03:08.470> weight<00:03:08.620> loss<00:03:08.739> perspective

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
so from a weight loss perspective

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:10.949 
so from a weight loss perspective
getting<00:03:09.760> proper<00:03:10.090> sleep<00:03:10.120> is<00:03:10.480> really<00:03:10.510> really

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
getting proper sleep is really really

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:12.870 
getting proper sleep is really really
important<00:03:11.440> just<00:03:11.650> from<00:03:11.770> a<00:03:11.800> hormonal<00:03:12.280> balance

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
important just from a hormonal balance

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.880 
important just from a hormonal balance
perspective<00:03:13.320> now<00:03:14.320> well<00:03:14.470> some<00:03:14.620> of<00:03:14.680> the<00:03:14.770> things

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
perspective now well some of the things

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.000 
perspective now well some of the things
you<00:03:14.950> can<00:03:15.100> do<00:03:15.160> is<00:03:15.310> to<00:03:15.760> sleep<00:03:15.970> well<00:03:16.800> well<00:03:17.800> first

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
you can do is to sleep well well first

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.110 
you can do is to sleep well well first
of<00:03:18.100> all<00:03:18.130> you<00:03:18.250> want<00:03:18.370> to<00:03:18.489> show<00:03:18.610> you<00:03:18.670> your<00:03:18.820> room<00:03:19.000> is

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120
