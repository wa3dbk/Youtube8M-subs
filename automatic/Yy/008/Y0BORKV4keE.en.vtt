00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.009
 It was a day that I will always remember 

00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:09.599
 it was spring 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.339
 he tells us that I thought 

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:14.339
 one would like this to last forever 

00:00:15.579 --> 00:00:18.220
 I think the best of my memories was me 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.919
 about three days after the birth of our first daughter 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:24.919
 without speeches and I know what made them 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.739
 for me there was nothing like being with my friends 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:34.770
 we had unforgettable moments 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.280
 it really is not strange 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.570
 with his memory more Felix 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.050
 I try not to think about things like that 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.630
 after all 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.630
 there is no right to be adopted 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.540
 nobody ever made me feel better and more loved than my people 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.470
 it's a shame that some cruises 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.470
 they can not last forever 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.910
 the happiest moments of my life 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.910
 when there was more fellowship between 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:08.410
 min 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.040
 the tasks of the accident 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.900
 10 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.900
 it's not like before things by science is my future 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.270
 before this year all these years 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.270
 is where you think the happiest memories of life come from 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.610
 they do not come from home 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.130
 or family 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.710
 whether it's from the family that one grew up hello he's doing now 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.710
 beautiful, good, single of the family that one day has 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.980
 It is interesting to see what the evils of the world seem to want to destroy all 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.980
 the family the source of greatest happiness and love 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.090
 that is not prevented 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:53.910
 is that nobody plans 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.770
 How can he not destroy his family? 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.650
 sd 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.750
 bruce keeps filtering in life 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.060
 as in my case for example 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.090
 I lost the notion of my values 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.279
 what happened 

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:10.019
 very good 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:13.019
 I wanted to give my family the best 

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:17.549
 but little by little I was wanting to earn more and more money 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:20.289
 until he is obsessed with the idea 

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:23.769
 and it is obvious that to earn more money you have to work and the more you work 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:26.769
 one more is recognized and more successful feels 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:28.629
 the ice 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:32.099
 sometimes I came late prevents wife from looking at me with nothing 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:34.869
 suspiciously 

00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:37.869
 and of course I reacted and said something like 

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:40.999
 what is the reason why he worked so much is forti 

00:02:41.529 --> 00:02:44.489
 which was not so true 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.809
 I mean it was not just because they were mostly for me 

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:50.149
 of recognition and 

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:53.149
 That is what really affects 

00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:03.059
 two 

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:03.880
 as well 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.620
 consumers give march from the command nodes 

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:13.239
 two of the nine degrees of doubts 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:16.239
 must about per cycle 

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:23.419
 where he undressed her from the arrival 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:28.269
 As for the relationship with his family, 

00:03:29.029 --> 00:03:31.529
 so clear but 

00:03:31.529 --> 00:03:34.529
 the provision for the family is not limited only to the material 

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:39.039
 it requires love patience and time 

00:03:39.679 --> 00:03:42.119
 but when you work all the time 

00:03:42.119 --> 00:03:45.579
 When you get home at least you want to give love and patience 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:47.129
 and then the family 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:50.129
 begins to see the one as someone who is always in a bad mood 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:54.749
 and what one asks is why does not appreciate a statement 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:59.259
 the husband becomes impatient because one does not devote time to the family 

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:03.839
 that leads one to feel misunderstood 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:05.879
 and consider 

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:08.879
 than co-workers if you do not understand 

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:13.789
 Little by little, these colleagues are getting better and better in the family, getting worse and worse. 

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:16.409
 suddenly like 

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:19.129
 everything was lost 

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:22.129
 the minutes 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:25.639
 when someone the plan 

00:04:38.999 --> 00:04:41.499
 nadal has not arrived ie 

00:04:41.499 --> 00:04:44.499
 nothing 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:48.639
 and then how do you prevent this from happening 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:50.960
 good in my case 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.960
 I had to understand how important my family was to me 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:57.699
 I need a new perspective 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:00.699
 spiritual precisely 

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:04.709
 so I learned something more about the purpose of life 

00:05:05.559 --> 00:05:10.009
 the plan for camargo as well and the role of my family in my plans 

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:14.749
 our heavenly father knows where one can find true happiness 

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:19.229
 I can not assure you that it is not in material things 

00:05:19.839 --> 00:05:23.229
 those are things that give us a passing happiness 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.029
 pirulo that has tactile environment account of that 

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:30.029
 of the family achieve their greatest potential 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:34.270
 is to work together helping each other 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.680
 he gives the greatest importance to his family that we are all 

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:42.389
 and if the extenista sent his family 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:48.479
 then that tells me how I can setem and spy we want to prioritize 

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:51.479
 if you are not going to see 

00:05:55.009 --> 00:05:57.520
 Well, simple 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:58.789
 things 

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:00.020
 and in addition to Saturday
