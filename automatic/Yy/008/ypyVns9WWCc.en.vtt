00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:12.219
 Thank you Hello place 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:14.110
 This time, I would like to introduce the organization for c-year collection that can be reproduced on Town Hall level 6 to 8 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:19.599
 think 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:23.770
 The maximum number of army camps at town hall level 6 is 150 but it is a short report level 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:31.690
 The maximum number of army camps from 8 to 200 is 200 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:36.990
 It will introduce on the assumption Oh sea camp of capacity and 200 when to introduce this unit organization 

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:36.990
 So will the introduction of the immediately first unit organization 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:45.850
 The first unit formation is the formation of Barbarian and Archer 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:50.620
 It is an organization that I have already introduced to go 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:54.730
 At the time of Turn Fool Level 6 as the number of Barbarian and Archer formations 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:59.030
 When the capacity of the army cap is 150 , 70 barbarian 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:02.329
 It is good to set the archer to 80 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:06.580
 Since Archer of attack is the main, if anything, 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:06.580
 Let's put more archers than barbarian 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:16.800
 It's a town hall level , so when it's 8 it's a Barbary 90 displayed on the screen now 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:19.260
 The organization of A-chan 110 is fine, but even Barbarian and A-chan 100 corner Heisei 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:24.240
 No problem 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:28.050
 However , if there are more barbarians, there are times when the season can not be broken too much 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:34.070
 Let's refrain from increasing the barbarian 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:34.070
 Then it's really easy, but I'm attacking Goblin village 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:44.770
 When attacking with Barbarian and Archer, first Barbarian 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:47.799
 g Put out from all directions Let's put out chan from behind when you finish putting out the barbarian 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:52.149
 Gust one body when to attack in the Barbarian and Archer 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:55.530
 Tap the screen with oil using your finger as it is easy to do 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:02:01.050
 does let's start from various places 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:05.660
 The faster you put it out, the more successful your Barbarian Archer will earn. 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.660
 If you put all the units out, you only have to protect yourself 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:15.120
 That 's all for Barbarian and Archer, so let 's go to the next commentary 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:25.330
 The next organization is the organization of giants and goblins 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:30.880
 It is the organization that also put an all-breaker in your favorite 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:31.840
 As for the number of formations, at the time of the town hall level 6, there are 110 sitting 8 and 5 greens 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:36.480
 Or organization 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:42.090
 The Gian same 10 body Goblin is recommended organization of 100 bodies 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:47.040
 If it is 8 at the town hall level , shake 8 giants and organize 160 bodies 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:51.150
 It is recommended to organize about 50 Gian 10 goblins 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:53.940
 When putting a wallbreaker, you do not reduce the number of giants but the number of goblins 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:58.560
 Let's reduce 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:03:03.300
 The number of giants will change in the organization of 8 because it is probably a review and a town hall level 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:04.650
 Not as meaning giant so much the number is entered by hand in protecting the first time after only 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.430
 Because it is not 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:13.319
 Then it is easy to attack Goblin village 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:18.120
 Let's put a ballbreaker for a trial this time and play in the middle 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:19.560
 This time I will take a ball breaker so I will have a resource facility inside the wall. 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:24.420
 I chose 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:28.200
 So first of all at once as a way out of the city and unit revenue Giant variety 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:32.549
 Get out of the spot and attract trade from defense 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.340
 Ball Once the giant is firmly Ensure that you are attracted attacks from the Boy clause 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:36.940
 Breaker Rage 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:41.739
 Let's close the wall and destroy all resources while destroying the wall 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:46.900
 When we put out goblin, each station phone when we put pro full-text publication instead of taking out from family 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:49.560
 8 fear take away more and is no longer resources that are powered by the user's image Even though a single attack 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.560
 I can do it 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:04:03.210
 Finally, it is a combination of Barbarian and Archer Gargoyle. 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:08.610
 Gargoyle than a unit that can be used from the Town Hall level 7 or later 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:13.960
 It can not be used at the town hall level 6 It is appearing on the screen as the number of the organization 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:18.730
 Barbarrier 80 Archer 80 80 Boyle 20 Balance Best 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:21.850
 I think it's good because Gargoyle can be produced using precious Darquer cussers. 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:28.450
 It is a little number is better scrub 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:33.980
 Revenue method of organization using this three types of 3 types There you people one eye, such as anti-aircraft guns of the village outside 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:39.770
 If so , destroy the anti-aircraft gun first with Barbarian Lager 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:40.310
 You can then put out the gargoyles to destroy the mortars and collect resources more safely. 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.480
 I will 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:48.320
 Another case is when the mortar is also outside 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:53.969
 Completely, but if you are out in the external field can it destroyed in the bar by anchors Archer 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:59.670
 If there are other facilities around you will not be able to do that, in which case he speaks out earlier 

00:04:53.969 --> 00:05:05.400
 Destroys the mortar. Gargoyle is 10 units in the sky, so there is no attack by the mortar. 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:12.080
 So the white liquor that I had at Barbarian and Arthur can easily do it now. 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:12.080
 I think that I do not know much image, so let's actually attack Goblin village and check 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:25.210
 Here Laura is here Hakkei You are on the outside, but there is an open cannon in the center of the village. 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:28.050
 Since the waveform will come today first, one by one will not be attacked by the facility at which it speaks out 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:28.050
 confirm 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:34.920
 If it is confirmed that it will not be attacked, it will destroy everything by remembering in advance the theory that will not be attacked 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:39.240
 I will 

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:42.980
 Because it seems to be able to destroy other than the other mortar 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.980
 Take out the gargoyle and destroy it 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:54.480
 Since the facility is not to be that it is of the Barbarian and Archer natural enemies Once you destroy the stations how both 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:59.040
 Take out from the west 

00:05:54.480 --> 00:06:03.240
 Because the way of putting out Gerber is the first or the last, it is a barbarian and either 

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:07.880
 There is no difference from A-chan's tenure, so let's remember 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:07.880
 After When you put all of the units place only protect 

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:33.460
 It is possible to reproduce the item level 6 to 8 but it is more than editing both organization 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:37.180
 If even one of the organizations introduced this time is Buster 

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:42.820
 Resource collection up to the town hall class is easy 

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:43.820
 If you are in trouble if resources do not gather easily, earning many times by all means in Heisei introduced this time 

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:47.810
 Please give me 

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:51.550
 If you do so, you should be able to realize that support will accumulate more and more 

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:51.550
 It is also next time bye bye
