00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:09.610 
multipoint server 2011 that helped with

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:12.450 
multipoint server 2011 that helped with
the<00:00:09.700> management<00:00:10.030> of<00:00:10.299> the<00:00:10.509> classroom<00:00:10.990> so<00:00:11.980> if<00:00:12.400> we

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:15.700 
come in here I can easily see what the

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.300 
come in here I can easily see what the
students<00:00:16.120> are<00:00:16.209> currently<00:00:16.630> doing<00:00:16.930> and<00:00:17.320> looks

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:18.310 
students are currently doing and looks

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.009 
students are currently doing and looks
like<00:00:18.550> one<00:00:18.789> of<00:00:18.820> the<00:00:19.000> students<00:00:19.420> who<00:00:19.599> should<00:00:19.869> be

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:20.019 
like one of the students who should be

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:21.960 
like one of the students who should be
working<00:00:20.230> on<00:00:20.500> his<00:00:20.590> assignment<00:00:21.160> is<00:00:21.340> actually

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:21.970 
working on his assignment is actually

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.230 
working on his assignment is actually
doing<00:00:22.830> browsing<00:00:23.830> the<00:00:23.859> web<00:00:23.980> and<00:00:24.279> going<00:00:24.519> to<00:00:24.640> ESPN

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:25.240 
doing browsing the web and going to ESPN

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.120 
doing browsing the web and going to ESPN
let's<00:00:25.960> take<00:00:26.109> a<00:00:26.170> closer<00:00:26.529> look<00:00:26.710> by

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:27.130 
let's take a closer look by

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.029 
let's take a closer look by
double-clicking<00:00:27.460> on<00:00:27.910> the<00:00:28.179> thumbnails<00:00:28.660> and<00:00:29.039> it

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:30.039 
double-clicking on the thumbnails and it

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:31.200 
double-clicking on the thumbnails and it
definitely<00:00:30.220> looks<00:00:30.640> like<00:00:30.699> he's<00:00:30.939> somewhere

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:31.210 
definitely looks like he's somewhere

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:32.790 
definitely looks like he's somewhere
he's<00:00:31.420> not<00:00:31.599> supposed<00:00:31.990> to<00:00:32.140> go<00:00:32.349> for<00:00:32.710> this

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:32.800 
he's not supposed to go for this

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.280 
he's not supposed to go for this
assignment<00:00:33.180> so<00:00:34.180> in<00:00:34.270> this<00:00:34.480> case<00:00:34.719> what<00:00:35.170> i<00:00:35.200> could

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:35.290 
assignment so in this case what i could

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.369 
assignment so in this case what i could
do<00:00:35.620> is<00:00:35.829> prevent<00:00:36.309> him<00:00:36.520> from<00:00:36.550> going<00:00:36.910> to<00:00:37.210> ESPN<00:00:37.840> by

00:00:38.369 --> 00:00:38.379 
do is prevent him from going to ESPN by

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:40.920 
do is prevent him from going to ESPN by
limiting<00:00:38.829> which<00:00:39.640> websites<00:00:40.270> he's<00:00:40.510> allowed<00:00:40.750> to

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:40.930 
limiting which websites he's allowed to

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.229 
limiting which websites he's allowed to
go<00:00:41.079> to<00:00:41.110> so<00:00:41.950> in<00:00:42.039> this<00:00:42.100> case<00:00:42.280> on<00:00:42.550> the<00:00:42.700> right<00:00:42.969> side

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:43.239 
go to so in this case on the right side

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:45.330 
go to so in this case on the right side
of<00:00:43.510> the<00:00:43.539> multipoint<00:00:44.110> manager<00:00:44.590> there<00:00:44.770> is<00:00:45.010> a

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:45.340 
of the multipoint manager there is a

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.270 
of the multipoint manager there is a
limit<00:00:45.760> web<00:00:45.969> access<00:00:46.149> on<00:00:46.629> this<00:00:46.870> station<00:00:47.140> so<00:00:47.890> let

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 
limit web access on this station so let

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.029 
limit web access on this station so let
me<00:00:48.370> click<00:00:48.610> on<00:00:48.820> that<00:00:49.199> and<00:00:50.199> we'll<00:00:50.710> see<00:00:50.890> what

00:00:51.029 --> 00:00:51.039 
me click on that and we'll see what

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:55.240 
me click on that and we'll see what
happens

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.520 

so<00:00:55.820> as<00:00:55.910> you<00:00:56.030> can<00:00:56.150> see<00:00:56.420> in<00:00:56.570> this<00:00:56.720> case<00:00:57.020> the

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
so as you can see in this case the

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.710 
so as you can see in this case the
student<00:00:57.920> was<00:00:58.040> not<00:00:58.280> allowed<00:00:58.670> to<00:00:58.850> go<00:00:58.970> to<00:00:59.000> the<00:00:59.240> SVM

00:00:59.710 --> 00:00:59.720 
student was not allowed to go to the SVM

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.320 
student was not allowed to go to the SVM
screen<00:01:00.140> and<00:01:00.650> he<00:01:00.950> is<00:01:01.040> now<00:01:01.250> redirected<00:01:02.150> to

screen and he is now redirected to
cancel<00:01:02.980> but<00:01:03.980> instead<00:01:04.640> of<00:01:04.760> going<00:01:05.089> there

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
cancel but instead of going there

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:06.850

however so in this case the student

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:02.770 
however so in this case the student
decides<00:02:01.369> that<00:02:01.520> they're<00:02:01.789> actually<00:02:01.939> not

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
decides that they're actually not

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.389 
decides that they're actually not
interested<00:02:03.259> in<00:02:03.350> doing<00:02:03.590> something<00:02:03.799> just<00:02:04.219> right

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
interested in doing something just right

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:06.370 
interested in doing something just right
now<00:02:04.670> and<00:02:04.939> you<00:02:05.030> want<00:02:05.210> to<00:02:05.270> go<00:02:05.479> to<00:02:05.539> play<00:02:06.170> some

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
now and you want to go to play some

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:16.870 
now and you want to go to play some
games<00:02:07.780> on<00:02:08.780> NSD<00:02:09.200> on<00:02:09.649> msn<00:02:10.129> com

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.730 

so<00:02:17.880> as<00:02:18.240> the<00:02:18.420> teacher<00:02:18.660> I've<00:02:19.140> noticed<00:02:19.500> that

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
so as the teacher I've noticed that

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.110 
so as the teacher I've noticed that
that's<00:02:20.010> what<00:02:20.190> he's<00:02:20.310> doing<00:02:20.670> and<00:02:20.790> I<00:02:20.880> really

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
that's what he's doing and I really

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.180 
that's what he's doing and I really
don't<00:02:21.300> want<00:02:21.450> him<00:02:21.570> to<00:02:21.630> go<00:02:21.810> browsing<00:02:22.110> around<00:02:22.410> so

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
don't want him to go browsing around so

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.950 
don't want him to go browsing around so
another<00:02:23.520> method<00:02:24.000> that<00:02:24.360> they<00:02:24.420> could<00:02:24.780> do<00:02:24.930> and

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
another method that they could do and

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.840 
another method that they could do and
said<00:02:25.410> which<00:02:25.620> is<00:02:25.650> not<00:02:25.890> limited<00:02:26.100> to<00:02:26.430> just<00:02:26.580> web

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
said which is not limited to just web

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.370 
said which is not limited to just web
access<00:02:27.030> but<00:02:27.510> if<00:02:27.600> I<00:02:27.720> see<00:02:27.900> the<00:02:27.990> student<00:02:28.320> doing

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
access but if I see the student doing

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.410 
access but if I see the student doing
anything<00:02:28.710> they're<00:02:29.070> not<00:02:29.220> supposed<00:02:29.370> to<00:02:29.760> I<00:02:29.970> can

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
anything they're not supposed to I can

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.750 
anything they're not supposed to I can
easily<00:02:30.690> using<00:02:31.290> the<00:02:31.410> multi-point<00:02:31.920> manager<00:02:32.490> go

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
easily using the multi-point manager go

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.030 
easily using the multi-point manager go
and<00:02:33.000> close<00:02:33.330> applications<00:02:34.140> that<00:02:34.770> they're<00:02:34.890> not

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
and close applications that they're not

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.460 
and close applications that they're not
supposed<00:02:35.220> to<00:02:35.490> be<00:02:35.580> using<00:02:35.900> so<00:02:36.900> if<00:02:36.990> we<00:02:37.050> go<00:02:37.230> over<00:02:37.260> to

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
supposed to be using so if we go over to

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.730 
supposed to be using so if we go over to
the<00:02:37.650> multi-point<00:02:38.130> manager<00:02:38.760> and<00:02:39.420> we<00:02:40.200> look<00:02:40.440> here

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
the multi-point manager and we look here

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.710 
the multi-point manager and we look here
on<00:02:40.890> the<00:02:41.160> near<00:02:41.340> the<00:02:41.460> top<00:02:41.760> there<00:02:42.030> is<00:02:42.060> a<00:02:42.210> closed

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
on the near the top there is a closed

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.620 
on the near the top there is a closed
applications<00:02:43.590> on<00:02:43.980> this<00:02:44.280> station<00:02:44.550> so<00:02:45.480> by

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
applications on this station so by

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.570 
applications on this station so by
clicking<00:02:45.840> this<00:02:46.260> it<00:02:46.560> gives<00:02:46.710> me<00:02:46.920> an<00:02:47.070> easy<00:02:47.220> list

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
clicking this it gives me an easy list

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:48.950 
clicking this it gives me an easy list
of<00:02:47.790> all<00:02:48.060> the<00:02:48.180> applications<00:02:48.540> currently

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
of all the applications currently

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.220 
of all the applications currently
running<00:02:49.530> on<00:02:49.770> this<00:02:50.610> station<00:02:50.850> so<00:02:51.660> i<00:02:51.720> can<00:02:51.870> select

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
running on this station so i can select

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.860 
running on this station so i can select
the<00:02:52.530> one<00:02:52.680> I<00:02:52.710> want<00:02:53.040> and<00:02:53.310> if<00:02:53.400> we<00:02:53.670> back<00:02:54.600> up<00:02:54.630> a

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870

the one I want and if we back up a
little<00:02:55.050> bit<00:02:55.260> and<00:02:55.440> look<00:02:55.620> at<00:02:55.770> the<00:02:55.890> student

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
little bit and look at the student

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.890 
little bit and look at the student
station<00:02:57.620> once<00:02:58.620> i<00:02:58.770> click<00:02:58.830> close<00:02:59.250> application

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
station once i click close application

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.060 
station once i click close application
we<00:03:00.900> can<00:03:01.050> see<00:03:01.290> that<00:03:01.440> the<00:03:01.710> application

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
we can see that the application

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.140 
we can see that the application
automatically<00:03:02.820> closed<00:03:03.210> on<00:03:03.450> the<00:03:03.690> student<00:03:04.110> side

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
automatically closed on the student side

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.990 
automatically closed on the student side

I can do in this case I will force for

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.809 
I can do in this case I will force for
the<00:03:18.840> application<00:03:19.170> and<00:03:19.560> launch<00:03:19.980> it<00:03:20.220> directly

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819
