00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
manure on top of everything of course

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.480 
manure on top of everything of course
it's<00:02:30.870> all<00:02:31.020> washed<00:02:31.290> down<00:02:31.440> into<00:02:31.770> the<00:02:31.890> mulch<00:02:32.130> now

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
it's all washed down into the mulch now

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:37.160 
it's all washed down into the mulch now
but<00:02:33.770> that<00:02:34.770> black<00:02:35.130> cow<00:02:35.340> cow<00:02:35.670> manure<00:02:36.030> I<00:02:36.390> was

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
but that black cow cow manure I was

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.500 
but that black cow cow manure I was
about<00:02:37.350> I<00:02:37.410> put<00:02:37.740> about<00:02:37.890> an<00:02:38.040> inch<00:02:38.220> and<00:02:38.340> a<00:02:38.460> half<00:02:38.510> to

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
about I put about an inch and a half to

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.630 
about I put about an inch and a half to
one<00:02:39.720> inch<00:02:39.930> on<00:02:40.080> top<00:02:40.350> just<00:02:40.590> just<00:02:41.250> enough<00:02:41.520> to

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
one inch on top just just enough to

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.920 
one inch on top just just enough to
cover<00:02:41.880> the<00:02:42.090> top<00:02:42.530> and<00:02:43.530> then<00:02:43.650> I<00:02:43.770> let<00:02:43.950> that<00:02:44.130> go<00:02:44.400> and

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
cover the top and then I let that go and

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.350 
cover the top and then I let that go and
so<00:02:45.930> it's<00:02:46.110> you<00:02:46.260> can't<00:02:46.470> really<00:02:46.590> see<00:02:46.680> it<00:02:46.950> anymore

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
so it's you can't really see it anymore

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.060 
so it's you can't really see it anymore
now<00:02:48.360> I<00:02:48.390> haven't<00:02:48.750> put<00:02:48.900> any<00:02:49.050> pesticides<00:02:49.680> at<00:02:49.890> all

the soil this bottom one had lettuce on
top<00:04:39.620> of<00:04:39.770> it<00:04:39.860> as<00:04:40.010> well<00:04:40.280> but<00:04:40.310> the<00:04:40.700> chickens<00:04:41.090> could

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
top of it as well but the chickens could

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.720 
top of it as well but the chickens could
reach<00:04:41.510> that<00:04:41.810> one<00:04:42.020> so<00:04:42.320> they<00:04:42.950> picked<00:04:43.280> it<00:04:43.460> pretty

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:43.730

reach that one so they picked it pretty
clean<00:04:44.030> there's<00:04:44.300> just<00:04:44.540> as<00:04:44.660> much<00:04:44.810> lettuce<00:04:45.080> down

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:45.350 
clean there's just as much lettuce down

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:48.910 
clean there's just as much lettuce down
there<00:04:45.590> as<00:04:45.680> I<00:04:45.800> was<00:04:45.950> up<00:04:46.160> here<00:04:47.350> good<00:04:48.350> old<00:04:48.500> chicken
