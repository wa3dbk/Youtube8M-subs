00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:46.810 
had a miscommunication there in the pits
I<00:02:45.890> don't<00:02:46.040> know<00:02:46.100> why<00:02:46.220> we<00:02:46.340> had<00:02:46.459> too<00:02:46.550> many<00:02:46.730> guys

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
I don't know why we had too many guys

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.520 
I don't know why we had too many guys
over<00:02:47.120> a<00:02:47.150> law<00:02:47.300> that's<00:02:47.540> just<00:02:47.750> uncalled<00:02:47.930> for<00:02:48.200> it's

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
over a law that's just uncalled for it's

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.090 
over a law that's just uncalled for it's
unacceptable<00:02:48.920> and<00:02:50.380> we<00:02:51.380> figured<00:02:51.650> it<00:02:51.739> out<00:02:51.830> what

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
unacceptable and we figured it out what

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.040 
unacceptable and we figured it out what
to<00:02:52.190> do<00:02:52.280> after<00:02:52.610> that<00:02:52.640> I<00:02:53.090> think<00:02:53.480> we<00:02:53.720> were<00:02:53.810> even

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
to do after that I think we were even

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.680 
to do after that I think we were even
shot<00:02:54.260> one<00:02:54.470> guy<00:02:54.500> every<00:02:54.920> time<00:02:54.950> almost<00:02:55.519> so<00:02:55.790> just

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
shot one guy every time almost so just

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.080 
shot one guy every time almost so just
an<00:02:57.380> end<00:02:57.590> of<00:02:57.739> the<00:02:57.950> six<00:02:58.220> and<00:02:58.340> the<00:02:58.400> 16<00:02:58.850> I<00:02:58.880> was

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
an end of the six and the 16 I was

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.030 
an end of the six and the 16 I was
rolling<00:02:59.330> down<00:02:59.480> the<00:02:59.630> back<00:02:59.810> and<00:03:00.080> was<00:03:00.709> rolling

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
rolling down the back and was rolling

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.350 
rolling down the back and was rolling
out<00:03:01.160> of<00:03:01.190> the<00:03:01.310> throttle<00:03:01.790> and<00:03:01.880> the<00:03:01.970> thing<00:03:02.150> veered

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
out of the throttle and the thing veered

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.699 
out of the throttle and the thing veered
to<00:03:02.450> the<00:03:02.480> left<00:03:02.540> a<00:03:02.780> little<00:03:02.870> bit<00:03:03.019> I<00:03:03.140> was<00:03:03.260> my<00:03:03.440> fault

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
to the left a little bit I was my fault

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:06.370 
to the left a little bit I was my fault
so<00:03:03.910> you<00:03:04.910> know<00:03:05.030> just<00:03:05.269> an<00:03:05.480> error<00:03:05.630> on<00:03:05.750> my<00:03:05.930> part<00:03:05.959> is

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
so you know just an error on my part is

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:07.570

gonna<00:03:06.470> let<00:03:06.650> those<00:03:06.769> guys<00:03:06.950> battle<00:03:07.340> it<00:03:07.430> out<00:03:07.519> in

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
gonna let those guys battle it out in

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.910 
gonna let those guys battle it out in
the<00:03:07.760> turn<00:03:08.000> three<00:03:08.360> and<00:03:08.390> I<00:03:08.870> knew<00:03:09.380> he<00:03:09.530> had<00:03:09.650> to<00:03:09.739> pit

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
the turn three and I knew he had to pit

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.110 
the turn three and I knew he had to pit
in<00:03:10.010> a<00:03:10.040> few<00:03:10.190> laps<00:03:10.340> so<00:03:10.640> it<00:03:10.730> wasn't<00:03:10.940> gonna<00:03:11.030> be

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
in a few laps so it wasn't gonna be

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.580 
in a few laps so it wasn't gonna be
worth<00:03:11.329> my<00:03:11.510> while<00:03:11.660> to<00:03:11.870> take<00:03:11.989> the<00:03:12.110> lead<00:03:12.260> from<00:03:12.410> him

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
worth my while to take the lead from him

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:13.810 
worth my while to take the lead from him
he<00:03:12.799> was<00:03:12.950> gonna<00:03:13.070> have<00:03:13.250> to<00:03:13.310> come<00:03:13.459> to<00:03:13.549> pit<00:03:13.610> road

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
he was gonna have to come to pit road

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.280 
he was gonna have to come to pit road
for<00:03:13.850> fuel<00:03:14.150> so<00:03:14.420> I'm<00:03:15.410> fortunate<00:03:15.709> that<00:03:15.950> our<00:03:16.459> night

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
for fuel so I'm fortunate that our night

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.680 
for fuel so I'm fortunate that our night
really<00:03:18.310> stunk<00:03:19.310> that<00:03:19.549> bad<00:03:19.790> and<00:03:20.269> we<00:03:20.420> finished

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
really stunk that bad and we finished

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.560 
really stunk that bad and we finished
second<00:03:21.019> so<00:03:21.290> just<00:03:22.120> can't<00:03:23.120> keep<00:03:23.239> up<00:03:23.360> with<00:03:23.420> a

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
second so just can't keep up with a

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:24.699 
second so just can't keep up with a

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
thought motor dust hITRON was wide open

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:27.729 
thought motor dust hITRON was wide open
there<00:03:26.600> that<00:03:26.750> whole<00:03:26.870> time<00:03:27.049> I<00:03:27.079> can't<00:03:27.440> run<00:03:27.590> wide

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739
