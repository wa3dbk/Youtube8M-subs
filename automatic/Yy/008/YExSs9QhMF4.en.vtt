to<00:02:45.960> mix<00:02:46.110> it<00:02:46.260> pretty<00:02:46.500> evenly<00:02:46.800> now<00:02:47.640> I've<00:02:47.730> got<00:02:47.910> an

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
to mix it pretty evenly now I've got an

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.360 
to mix it pretty evenly now I've got an
open<00:02:49.080> package<00:02:49.380> already<00:02:49.560> because<00:02:49.920> I<00:02:50.010> just<00:02:50.220> use

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
open package already because I just use

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.310 
open package already because I just use
just<00:02:50.640> a<00:02:50.730> little<00:02:51.150> bit<00:02:51.360> you<00:02:51.570> know<00:02:51.600> this<00:02:52.140> does

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
just a little bit you know this does

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.710 
just a little bit you know this does
have<00:02:52.530> some<00:02:52.710> calories<00:02:53.160> in<00:02:53.340> it<00:02:53.430> it's<00:02:54.150> about<00:02:54.240> so<00:02:54.690> i

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
have some calories in it it's about so i

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.330 
have some calories in it it's about so i
think<00:02:54.810> they<00:02:54.990> said<00:02:55.020> 35<00:02:55.560> calories<00:02:55.800> per<00:02:56.130> serving

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
think they said 35 calories per serving

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.940 
think they said 35 calories per serving
which<00:02:56.820> is<00:02:57.780> about<00:02:57.900> a<00:02:57.960> quarter<00:02:58.290> of<00:02:58.470> a<00:02:58.560> package

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
which is about a quarter of a package

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.800 
which is about a quarter of a package
okay<00:02:59.070> so<00:02:59.250> that's<00:02:59.490> a<00:02:59.580> lot<00:02:59.730> so<00:02:59.940> i<00:02:59.970> only<00:03:00.300> use<00:03:00.630> about

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
okay so that's a lot so i only use about

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.270 
okay so that's a lot so i only use about
probably<00:03:01.530> a<00:03:02.390> fifth<00:03:03.390> of<00:03:03.600> the<00:03:03.750> package<00:03:04.170> a<00:03:04.410> 6a<00:03:05.220> as

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
probably a fifth of the package a 6a as

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.040 
probably a fifth of the package a 6a as
you<00:03:05.460> can<00:03:05.610> see<00:03:05.790> hopefully<00:03:06.270> you<00:03:06.480> can<00:03:06.600> see<00:03:06.810> that

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
you can see hopefully you can see that

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.720 
you can see hopefully you can see that
so<00:03:07.860> to<00:03:07.920> sprinkle<00:03:08.400> some<00:03:08.580> in<00:03:08.730> there<00:03:10.250> and<00:03:11.250> then

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
so to sprinkle some in there and then

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:17.240 
so to sprinkle some in there and then
just<00:03:12.660> mix<00:03:12.930> it<00:03:13.140> all<00:03:13.350> together<00:03:13.560> now<00:03:16.250> you're

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
just mix it all together now you're

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:18.710 
just mix it all together now you're
going<00:03:17.370> to<00:03:17.430> see<00:03:17.610> when<00:03:17.730> you<00:03:17.820> mix<00:03:18.000> it<00:03:18.209> up<00:03:18.330> it<00:03:18.570> kind

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720
