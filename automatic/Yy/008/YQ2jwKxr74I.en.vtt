00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.990
 they have been so for years that the bmw e34 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.640
 in him cc class each other's only 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.410
 competitors value but it comes there 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.029
 all of a sudden the audi a4 became bigger and bigger 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.070
 more important and bigger and more important 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.480
 and suddenly goodbye Mercedes what happens now 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.920
 what was at the expense of that for sure 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.360
 she wasn't so very upset 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.559
 the audio nothing with the a4 one of the 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.329
 main players became in it 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:39.710
 premium busy well it got me 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:41.659
 always the previous generation very customer 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.589
 much sportier to that 

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:44.269
 change 

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:45.649
 and if I have a very nice car but 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:48.140
 just not lost here yet 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:50.210
 so that violence between bmw wifi and audi 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.010
 a4 b6 mercedes now decided we are going it 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.449
 do differently again with our c-class we 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.920
 put it piece up and becomes more expensive 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:56.809
 he becomes more luxurious he becomes larger he 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.860
 becomes more spacious and you become comfortable 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:59.570
 so we then have you this year already 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.070
 now the station wagon has also been driven 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.360
 I was talking about AI but we will go straight away 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.790
 just check 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.990
 no stack in the back of the front seat 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.939
 myself 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.189
 and then I sit down then of course 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:13.220
 no skoda superb but feet can 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:14.390
 well include space just about him 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.710
 I think plan learning that far forward 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.030
 yet for stabbing welding of three 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.710
 see was how we really other than this 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.420
 a main course than a lot 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.380
 better in them than because the roof line you 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.940
 expires 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.440
 I just think it is very neat in meat 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.950
 with how the c-class from the past 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.570
 know and we vent behind 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.280
 I looked at the luggage room the applies 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.960
 also here of course that it is none 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.960
 e-class Ford Mondeo major villain 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.570
 but equally it is a lot of space 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.100
 and of course all different than it 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.330
 has been and that is clearly still the case 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.100
 always with that c-class she wants now 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.170
 cla a kind of small mini sedan underneath 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.580
 andy c is really up a lot 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.440
 thrown so that the distinction can 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.740
 compared to that vision and that audi 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.740
 a4 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.869
 first what stands out if this is your advisor 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.489
 the level finish materials the 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:11.560
 appearance however it is unparalleled 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:13.599
 for this segment that was of course already 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:17.140
 such a the she then but it comes to me now 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:18.640
 again and it's not just how it looks 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.560
 also see how it all feels you are going 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.760
 ride the silence on board at very high 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.459
 just speed 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.470
 220 rows still with normal on the 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.910
 lunar octo can still talk to each other 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.260
 getting that car is very stable with two 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.510
 Fingers Zoey handlebars and he does that 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.920
 does not bind and so it is then more 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.470
 cities sich das best oder nichts te 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.700
 chasing after brush and c load well there 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.560
 there is something to be said about it 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.790
 wrong cars but certainly not it 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.530
 dear and 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.030
 in this sure growth was what they wanted 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.470
 really make the best what's in this 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.450
 segment and that's just big news 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.890
 successful 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.530
 then it's a little goes wrong now 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.959
 ergonomics the command system we will 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.870
 multimedia system is extensive and 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:57.099
 options in an unprecedented amount of screen 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.209
 also bigger over it 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:59.590
 so nice and clear but the 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.599
 operation is still not very bad 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.340
 intuitive it is a bit of searching and in 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:04.599
 menu in the count and again if you are wrong 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.579
 a car buys with it of course 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:07.360
 but that is no excuse for not being simpler 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:09.280
 to do 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.109
 bmw and audi do it with eyed raven and 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.640
 way much better but for the kia cee'd 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:13.209
 then I go through multimedia more easily 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.069
 menu one 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:20.530
 then in these bands whatever this much more 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:23.290
 is just as well it falls on the drive 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.850
 myself than I already said in the intro but 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.769
 she really is a clear choice she makes 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.850
 go all the way for comfort 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:29.260
 with that row of three four cubic meters 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.959
 sportier than this dynamic than this 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.000
 but yes i can't name a weak point of 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:35.500
 This car is a choice of Mercedes 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.910
 and there come in it is not so with 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.290
 curvy road that is annoying 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.579
 word or that it will float wants it 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.480
 goes over and over there I just beautiful 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:45.100
 tight the road only yes it is that what 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.480
 wearers all respond so you have to 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.980
 send in a little earlier a little more time 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.859
 provides insight into the carriage and 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.970
 then you go very serenely so the curves 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:53.739
 and are fed up with people for whom you come 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.160
 is also very important then hard 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:56.160
 through the bend of 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.709
 the relative weakest point of the car 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:04.080
 remains thickest engines that injustice with 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:06.239
 250 bluetec previous routes with the 220 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.650
 blue characters same engine but then it is 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:09.750
 ie pinched so now I have more power 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.700
 204 hp 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.049
 Quite a few anyway and they sent it to it 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.000
 just enough i just go nicely serene 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:16.889
 I well ahead of him but certainly outside 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.780
 you notice it is not a rabo engine with 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:20.250
 you notice not a very refined walk inside 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.320
 that we have always insulated very well 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.810
 so then completeness can do that 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.370
 stayed and who has as automatic 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.690
 ok but also pretty wooden again 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.220
 does not respond as quickly as to that 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.710
 new on the back the vending machines you in almost 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.699
 every bmw finds in the sets and so and then 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.010
 also still just what 

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:36.389
 rear, and then may cover up to 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.639
 say oh it may and a bit quieter such 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:40.830
 c-class and the sound inside is good 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:42.180
 isolated but competition is emerging 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.800
 that plane just better if you are in one 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.830
 Audis tactically that fucking the farthest 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.930
 roll with an entry motor an int and a 2 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.760
 liters of diesel with 200 hp 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:53.220
 then you will be overwhelmed by power 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.780
 thereof and the flexibility and mention on one 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.160
 I don't have that now 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.449
 and then you kind of understand that we do 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.490
 always go forward with renault 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:02.160
 working together for the smaller engines 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:04.370
 because that plane yes it looks strong 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.370
 stop 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:18.670
 equally comprehensive package 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.380
 is this a car that you whole 

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:23.410
 satisfied of it he becomes bigger 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:24.550
 more spacious more comfortable is quite expensive 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:26.110
 have noticed if you glue this 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.580
 competition then 7 just has again 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.750
 unabashedly high put on the market in 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.370
 middle options it got worse 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:33.580
 piece with a-class and cla again 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:35.050
 done but it clearly where already 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.550
 the money is it is also all better 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:38.860
 And it all also feels like it's one 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:40.330
 Half a million kilometers it goes and 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:42.550
 is nevertheless a nice feeling when you are in such a 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:44.230
 car gets the could me i is so big 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:46.690
 also got space in the back crab 500 

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:48.250
 liter and so it turns out that my e-class 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:50.050
 to thesis i might be much bigger 

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:51.160
 overwhelmingly robbing many people and 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.550
 they then have a dcc 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.550
 more than enough
