and then you see these golf courts here
which<00:02:40.560> is<00:02:40.680> what<00:02:40.830> smaller<00:02:41.100> ones<00:02:41.370> go<00:02:41.550> in<00:02:41.700> their

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
which is what smaller ones go in their

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.740 
which is what smaller ones go in their
height<00:02:42.120> is<00:02:42.420> six<00:02:43.110> than<00:02:43.320> one<00:02:43.560> force<00:02:44.750> just

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
height is six than one force just

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.000 
height is six than one force just
they're<00:02:46.020> all<00:02:46.110> just<00:02:46.320> a<00:02:46.440> little<00:02:46.740> like<00:02:46.980> a

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
they're all just a little like a

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.550 
they're all just a little like a
fraction<00:02:47.550> of<00:02:47.730> a<00:02:47.790> difference<00:02:48.180> and<00:02:48.570> that<00:02:49.080> just

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
fraction of a difference and that just

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.050 
fraction of a difference and that just
makes<00:02:49.680> me<00:02:49.830> so<00:02:50.040> mad<00:02:50.070> that's<00:02:50.460> their<00:02:50.640> like<00:02:50.820> we<00:02:50.940> do

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
makes me so mad that's their like we do

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.620 
makes me so mad that's their like we do
that<00:02:51.240> but<00:02:51.890> because<00:02:52.890> that<00:02:53.070> means<00:02:53.630> either

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
that but because that means either

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.010 
that but because that means either

you're gonna have a big gap and one of
the<00:02:58.140> tubs<00:02:58.380> and<00:02:58.680> snake<00:02:59.340> might<00:02:59.490> be<00:02:59.550> able<00:02:59.640> to<00:02:59.730> get

the tubs and snake might be able to get

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.180 
the tubs and snake might be able to get
out<00:02:59.970> and<00:03:00.390> that<00:03:01.140> means<00:03:01.530> one<00:03:01.680> of<00:03:01.800> them<00:03:01.890> is<00:03:02.010> slight

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
so mad that there's that fraction of an

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.140 
so mad that there's that fraction of an
inch<00:03:39.750> they<00:03:40.739> do<00:03:40.950> that<00:03:41.130> so<00:03:41.610> I<00:03:41.640> can't<00:03:41.910> use<00:03:42.030> those

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
inch they do that so I can't use those

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.990 
inch they do that so I can't use those
tubs<00:03:42.450> so<00:03:43.070> basically<00:03:44.070> I<00:03:44.190> just<00:03:44.459> had<00:03:44.580> to<00:03:44.640> take<00:03:44.820> off

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
41 court in half so she can move up some

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.080

found<00:04:11.400> a<00:04:12.050> just<00:04:13.050> I<00:04:13.320> don't<00:04:13.680> know<00:04:14.269> it<00:04:15.269> means<00:04:15.480> that

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
found a just I don't know it means that

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.310 
found a just I don't know it means that
one<00:04:16.320> slide<00:04:16.650> harder<00:04:17.100> than<00:04:17.700> others<00:04:17.820> but<00:04:18.479> you<00:04:19.169> can

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
one slide harder than others but you can

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.190 
one slide harder than others but you can
see<00:04:19.590> on<00:04:19.799> these<00:04:20.370> on<00:04:20.760> the<00:04:21.090> 12<00:04:21.570> courts<00:04:21.870> that<00:04:22.049> there

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
see on these on the 12 courts that there

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.920 
see on these on the 12 courts that there
is<00:04:22.350> a<00:04:22.380> bit<00:04:22.590> of<00:04:22.710> a<00:04:22.770> gap<00:04:22.979> there<00:04:23.600> but<00:04:24.600> it's<00:04:24.750> not

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
is a bit of a gap there but it's not

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.000 
is a bit of a gap there but it's not
enough<00:04:25.260> or<00:04:25.500> anything<00:04:25.800> to<00:04:25.890> get<00:04:26.070> out<00:04:27.470> but<00:04:28.470> we

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
enough or anything to get out but we

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.159 
enough or anything to get out but we
made<00:04:29.190> it<00:04:29.310> just<00:04:29.340> enough<00:04:29.790> of<00:04:30.000> these<00:04:30.150> well<00:04:31.080> that

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:31.169 
made it just enough of these well that

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:33.810 
made it just enough of these well that
one's<00:04:31.320> slides<00:04:31.560> good<00:04:31.770> but<00:04:32.280> you<00:04:32.400> can<00:04:32.520> see<00:04:32.669> the

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
one's slides good but you can see the

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.560 
one's slides good but you can see the
slide<00:04:34.510> 41<00:04:34.900> points<00:04:35.350> I<00:04:36.210> would<00:04:37.210> have<00:04:37.330> really

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
slide 41 points I would have really

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:38.820 
slide 41 points I would have really
liked<00:04:37.720> to<00:04:37.870> make<00:04:37.990> this<00:04:38.110> a<00:04:38.200> little<00:04:38.350> higher<00:04:38.560> so

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
liked to make this a little higher so

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:40.020 
liked to make this a little higher so
the<00:04:38.920> slid<00:04:39.250> better<00:04:39.430> but<00:04:39.700> that<00:04:39.850> would<00:04:40.000> have

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
the slid better but that would have

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:41.640 
the slid better but that would have
meant<00:04:40.330> making<00:04:40.600> a<00:04:40.840> gap<00:04:41.050> big<00:04:41.290> enough<00:04:41.470> is

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
meant making a gap big enough is

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:42.720 
meant making a gap big enough is
something<00:04:41.920> could<00:04:42.040> you<00:04:42.100> possibly<00:04:42.370> get<00:04:42.520> out<00:04:42.610> of

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:42.730 
something could you possibly get out of

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:45.810 
something could you possibly get out of
there<00:04:42.930> yeah<00:04:43.930> that's<00:04:44.050> just<00:04:44.230> so<00:04:45.190> annoying<00:04:45.760> that

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
there yeah that's just so annoying that

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.300 
there yeah that's just so annoying that
they<00:04:46.030> would<00:04:46.180> do<00:04:46.300> that<00:04:46.480> just<00:04:47.010> make<00:04:48.010> their<00:04:48.160> tub

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
they would do that just make their tub

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:49.620 
they would do that just make their tub
the<00:04:48.460> fraction<00:04:48.820> of<00:04:48.910> an<00:04:49.000> inch<00:04:49.180> difference<00:04:49.330> in

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:49.630 
the fraction of an inch difference in

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:51.870 
the fraction of an inch difference in
height<00:04:49.780> I<00:04:50.110> think<00:04:50.890> they<00:04:51.160> just<00:04:51.190> do<00:04:51.520> it<00:04:51.550> to<00:04:51.730> make

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:51.880 
height I think they just do it to make

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.360 
height I think they just do it to make
people<00:04:51.910> mad<00:04:52.300> but<00:04:52.570> yeah<00:04:53.560> you<00:04:53.620> see<00:04:53.920> I<00:04:53.950> have<00:04:54.190> heat

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370
