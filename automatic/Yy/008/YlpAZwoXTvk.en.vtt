this game hit the mark well for starters
like<00:01:47.909> I<00:01:47.970> said<00:01:48.119> a<00:01:48.149> moment<00:01:48.270> ago<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.689> graphics

like I said a moment ago the graphics

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.480 
like I said a moment ago the graphics
are<00:01:49.110> actually<00:01:49.200> pretty<00:01:49.590> good<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:50.070> tracks<00:01:50.310> all

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
are actually pretty good the tracks all

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.920 
are actually pretty good the tracks all
look<00:01:50.640> fine<00:01:50.909> and<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.149> sprites<00:01:51.450> used<00:01:51.659> for<00:01:51.869> the

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
look fine and the sprites used for the

works very well to compensate for the

track I've never gotten to play this
game<00:02:51.510> with<00:02:51.569> others<00:02:51.900> so<00:02:52.019> I<00:02:52.049> can't<00:02:52.319> really<00:02:52.470> speak

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650

for<00:02:52.889> the<00:02:52.980> multiplayer<00:02:53.400> battle<00:02:53.879> mode<00:02:54.030> but<00:02:54.239> if

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
for the multiplayer battle mode but if

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:55.490

it's anything like other Mario Kart
games<00:02:55.680> I<00:02:55.829> can<00:02:55.980> imagine<00:02:56.310> it's<00:02:56.430> a<00:02:56.489> decent<00:02:56.790> amount

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:56.879

way to do it and if you can get around

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:14.030 
way to do it and if you can get around
the<00:03:12.720> slippery<00:03:13.049> controls<00:03:13.230> I'd<00:03:13.620> say<00:03:13.829> this<00:03:13.980> is

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
the slippery controls I'd say this is

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.129
