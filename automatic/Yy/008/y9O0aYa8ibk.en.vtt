00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.540
 the other night we will embark on a 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:09.750
 wonderful journey through life 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:13.049
 from birth to death with help 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.639
 the most advanced technology will be a 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.640
 journey counted from a 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:20.430
 perspective of the depths of the 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.490
 human body will not be the story of a 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.310
 life but that of all our lives 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.030
 [Music] 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:35.650
 [Applause] 

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:38.829
 [Music] 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.829
 [Applause] 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:51.070
 for 40 weeks after 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:57.790
 sperm fertilize an egg one 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:01:00.290
 new life was created but simple is lula 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:03.369
 gave birth to a baby completely shaped 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.369
 [Music] 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:10.560
 now the tranquility in the womb 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:10.560
 is to be broken 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.470
 we are on the verge of childbirth 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.789
 we all live this experience but it is 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:24.930
 It is impossible to remember what we 

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:24.930
 moment we are born 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.090
 What scientists Saturday is that our 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.460
 organism is discharged from the 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.149
 more intense adrenaline than a 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.149
 heart attack 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:46.020
 this adrenaline helps us survive the 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:50.759
 it forces our lungs to breathe 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:52.640
 for the first time since they were still full of 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.469
 amniotic fluid 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:59.159
 we run the risk of 

00:01:55.469 --> 00:02:01.770
 drowning the muscles that 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:05.789
 we need to contract to breathe 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:09.289
 suddenly our spasms 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:16.290
 lungs awaken to life and 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:18.660
 we breathe for the first time is the 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.620
 the most important breath of our 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.680
 lives 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:25.730
 the first of the 700 million that we will 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.730
 before the last 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:32.350
 [Music] 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:34.780
 To reach the trachea and travels 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:38.080
 bronchus dividing into broke the 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.440
 increasingly more children to children 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:43.780
 into the pulmonary alveoli 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:47.170
 small bag-shaped formations where 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:49.390
 oxygen is absorbed and carbon dioxide 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.380
 he minute the lungs 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:56.229
 there are 30 million alveoli 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.229
 [Music] 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:11.020
 now the umbilical cord that unites us 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:20.110
 maternal body is cut by the first 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:22.330
 time we are proposing to the organs themselves 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:25.690
 newborn needs to adapt to the 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:27.260
 external world is a challenging and 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:34.389
 full of risks 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:34.389
 [Music] 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:40.650
 our heart the size of a walnut already 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.060
 I was throbbing eight months ago but now I'm facing 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.199
 a complication 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.199
 [Music] 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:52.790
 it has two open holes in the garden 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.790
 and other internal walls 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.710
 [Music] 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.770
 of these holes comes from life 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:03.920
 intrauterine and served to divert the 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:05.960
 blood from our paralyzed lungs in the 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:12.010
 direction of placental vessels 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:15.010
 [Music] 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:19.010
 but now that the lungs Work 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:23.569
 two holes are closed forever 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:23.569
 [Music] 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:34.160
 with his heart beating 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:37.280
 blood is pumped for thousands of 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:40.390
 miles of blood vessels 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.390
 [Music] 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:50.509
 The liver performs more than 500 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.470
 elimination of toxins production 

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:54.599
 heat 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.599
 [Music] 

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:59.960
 lions seek to maintain balance between 

00:04:58.069 --> 00:05:02.479
 the volume of water required for 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:05.469
 cells and the amount that should be 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:05.469
 eliminated in the urine 

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:10.189
 [Music] 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:13.909
 the intestine is full of cells 

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:24.680
 and of amniotic fluid digested is 

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:25.789
 meconium meconium is a liquid 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.699
 corrosive 

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:31.460
 if the baby arrives aspired he may 

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:34.879
 attacking the public within the gut 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:37.449
 however it is harmless and will be eliminated 

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:37.449
 in hours
