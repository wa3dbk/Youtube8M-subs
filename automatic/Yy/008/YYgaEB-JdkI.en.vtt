was<00:00:07.740> able<00:00:07.890> to<00:00:08.099> reproduce<00:00:08.370> this<00:00:08.760> timing<00:00:09.300> it

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
was able to reproduce this timing it

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.959 
was able to reproduce this timing it
just<00:00:09.750> so<00:00:10.110> so<00:00:10.440> that<00:00:10.590> the<00:00:10.710> moment<00:00:10.980> vein<00:00:11.340> dies<00:00:11.610> to

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
just so so that the moment vein dies to

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
okay so after reproducing that bug with

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.420 
okay so after reproducing that bug with
vane<00:00:48.840> we<00:00:49.440> decided<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:49.890> attempt<00:00:50.190> it<00:00:50.280> with

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
vane we decided to attempt it with

those minions having been able to

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.280 
those minions having been able to
reproduce<00:01:19.680> that<00:01:20.040> bug<00:01:20.369> twice<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.720> on<00:01:21.900> two

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.330 
reproduce that bug twice and on two
separate<00:01:23.070> occasions<00:01:23.900> I'm<00:01:25.130> led<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.159> believe

that has the invisible buff over here it
doesn't<00:01:33.780> matter<00:01:34.110> if<00:01:34.380> you<00:01:34.590> can<00:01:34.770> see<00:01:35.100> them<00:01:35.280> or

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
doesn't matter if you can see them or

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.440 
doesn't matter if you can see them or
