00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
mixtures are ready over here with me

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.400 
mixtures are ready over here with me
this<00:00:50.399> is<00:00:50.579> with<00:00:50.879> kus<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:51.360> water<00:00:51.780> this<00:00:52.110> is<00:00:52.260> with

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
this is with kus and water this is with

Rose syrup and water this is with mango
juice<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.230> water<00:00:55.500> now<00:00:56.190> what<00:00:56.460> we<00:00:56.579> are<00:00:56.610> going<00:00:56.820> to

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
juice and water now what we are going to

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.130 
juice and water now what we are going to
do<00:00:57.030> is<00:00:57.180> we<00:00:57.750> would<00:00:57.899> take<00:00:57.930> normal<00:00:58.590> ice<00:00:58.890> trays

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
do is we would take normal ice trays

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.969 
do is we would take normal ice trays
like<00:01:01.140> this<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:02.180> pour<00:01:03.180> these<00:01:03.390> mixtures

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:03.979 
like this and pour these mixtures

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:15.770 
like this and pour these mixtures
individually<00:01:04.979> in<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.489> ice<00:01:05.670> trays

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.810 

so<00:01:16.380> now<00:01:16.530> these<00:01:16.740> mixtures<00:01:17.100> are<00:01:17.370> ready<00:01:17.550> to<00:01:17.700> be

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
so now these mixtures are ready to be

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.630 
so now these mixtures are ready to be
frozen<00:01:18.120> for<00:01:18.750> 24<00:01:19.230> hours<00:01:19.410> at<00:01:19.590> least<00:01:19.620> in<00:01:20.190> the

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
frozen for 24 hours at least in the

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.280 
frozen for 24 hours at least in the
refrigerator<00:01:21.240> in<00:01:21.510> the<00:01:21.900> freezer<00:01:22.170> compartment

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
refrigerator in the freezer compartment

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.680 
refrigerator in the freezer compartment
now<00:01:23.220> I<00:01:23.250> would<00:01:23.580> tell<00:01:23.730> you<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:23.970> most<00:01:24.150> important

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:24.690 
now I would tell you the most important

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.300 
now I would tell you the most important
thing<00:01:24.900> of<00:01:24.990> this<00:01:25.410> sort<00:01:25.680> base<00:01:25.830> which<00:01:26.040> I<00:01:26.130> have

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
thing of this sort base which I have

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.010 
thing of this sort base which I have
made<00:01:26.490> you<00:01:26.850> can<00:01:27.000> make<00:01:27.180> these<00:01:27.360> sorbets<00:01:27.810> and

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
made you can make these sorbets and

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.900 
made you can make these sorbets and
store<00:01:28.440> it<00:01:28.590> in<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.800> freezer<00:01:29.070> for<00:01:29.400> days

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:29.910 
store it in the freezer for days

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:31.550 
store it in the freezer for days
together<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.540> you<00:01:30.840> can<00:01:31.020> use<00:01:31.229> it<00:01:31.380> whenever

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
together and you can use it whenever

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.950 
together and you can use it whenever
required<00:01:31.860> as<00:01:32.280> you<00:01:32.670> can<00:01:32.820> see<00:01:33.000> after<00:01:33.180> freezing

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
required as you can see after freezing

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.950 
required as you can see after freezing
these<00:01:34.320> mixtures<00:01:34.710> for<00:01:35.130> around<00:01:35.520> 24<00:01:36.390> hours<00:01:36.570> we

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
these mixtures for around 24 hours we

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.430 
these mixtures for around 24 hours we
have<00:01:37.170> nice<00:01:37.560> ice<00:01:37.830> cubes<00:01:38.310> of<00:01:38.660> mango<00:01:39.660> this<00:01:40.229> is<00:01:40.350> the

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
have nice ice cubes of mango this is the

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.460 
have nice ice cubes of mango this is the
mango<00:01:40.770> juice<00:01:40.950> which<00:01:41.340> was<00:01:41.520> diluted<00:01:42.030> in<00:01:42.180> water

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
mango juice which was diluted in water

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.990 
mango juice which was diluted in water
similarly<00:01:43.470> this<00:01:44.010> is<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.190> Rose<00:01:44.460> syrup<00:01:44.670> and

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
similarly this is the Rose syrup and

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.969 
similarly this is the Rose syrup and
this<00:01:45.630> is<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.869> Cass<00:01:46.080> theorem<00:01:46.350> so<00:01:46.560> these<00:01:46.770> are

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
this is the Cass theorem so these are

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.280 
this is the Cass theorem so these are
odd<00:01:47.430> ways<00:01:47.640> which<00:01:47.970> are<00:01:48.090> ready<00:01:48.300> for<00:01:48.630> a<00:01:48.690> dessert<00:01:49.110> I

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
odd ways which are ready for a dessert I

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.139 
odd ways which are ready for a dessert I
have<00:01:49.320> taken<00:01:49.890> a<00:01:49.979> fancy<00:01:50.100> glass<00:01:50.430> like<00:01:50.759> this<00:01:50.970> and

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
have taken a fancy glass like this and

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.130 
have taken a fancy glass like this and
in<00:01:51.600> this<00:01:51.990> glass<00:01:52.290> I<00:01:52.560> would<00:01:53.100> place<00:01:53.910> around<00:01:54.840> two

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
in this glass I would place around two

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.859 
in this glass I would place around two
to<00:01:55.290> three<00:01:55.320> ice<00:01:55.649> cubes<00:01:55.979> each<00:01:56.340> of<00:01:56.670> mango<00:01:57.570> here

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
to three ice cubes each of mango here

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.450 
to three ice cubes each of mango here
goes<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.410> mango<00:01:58.860> sorbet<00:01:59.630> this<00:02:00.630> is<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:00.899> cash

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
goes the mango sorbet this is the cash

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.469 
goes the mango sorbet this is the cash
and<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:03.030> rose<00:02:03.590> so<00:02:04.590> here<00:02:05.070> it<00:02:05.220> is<00:02:05.369> this<00:02:05.940> forms

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
and the rose so here it is this forms

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.919 
and the rose so here it is this forms
