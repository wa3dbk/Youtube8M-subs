00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.060
 but the guys and girls that such good 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:35.890
 if you can explain to me what you have just 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.330
 see then I love life because 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.590
 I'm speechless in such 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.590
 frostbite show 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:47.070
 welcome to 2004 welcome to the train 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:48.720
 of golf this team with 870 are more 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.180
 that stylish American shotgun 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:54.739
 that we can well catalog as a 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.739
 a thousand truth is an old 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.870
 look that you want to plug and 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.220
 sexual warlike appetites aside today I 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.080
 would like to tell you about game modes 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.760
 why then because I miss 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.740
 master of grouper and miss 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.390
 scavenger and by an infantry player 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.369
 As is my case, it is the offer of 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.490
 battle 54 once after I get to 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.990
 be somewhat monotonous and what happens 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.490
 more fatal you have tired of playing your 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.810
 death ball by teams all the saint 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.880
 day playing team duel to death 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.410
 Well, not if I had tired of playing in 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.509
 mode games when based on kill 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.280
 I would have tired of pointing had I 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.170
 tired of shooting I had tired of 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.479
 play and I assure you that that has not 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.740
 happened in any game mode already 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.380
 either to activate or deactivate a pump 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.930
 to capture or defend a point a 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.490
 flag you have to kill the enemy the 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.229
 third team was death by teams 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.670
 it's like when you're with a girl and you 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.020
 skip the preambles let's leave 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.210
 of mariconadas of flag 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.369
 and hosts and we will beat us shots 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.719
 hell do not fool us that is what 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.700
 that we have come here is for what we 

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:55.590
 we bought the fucking game to paste 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.020
 shots not to see like a fucking shit 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.130
 red turns blue we have not 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.079
 bought game for that we have 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.390
 bought the fucking game to sew the 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.759
 satyrs so gentlemen let's sew 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.439
 our shots that's how I see more or 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.509
 less than death by teams but well 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.879
 True mola mola that has colored 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.010
 that there is variety and variety of ways 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:16.410
 of games specifically focused on 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.150
 infantry in battlefield 4 is reduced to 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.370
 two on the one hand with death by 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.410
 teams and on the other hand domination and 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.239
 amd and domination personally I do not 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.980
 ends convincing what does not take away 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.540
 so that every day religiously 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.799
 Well I made a few combinations 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.540
 for that there is variety for 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:32.190
 that there is color but from my 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.750
 point of view does not stop being of depth 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.980
 death by teams yes with the 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.079
 peculiarity that there are three objectives 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.519
 scattered around the map and how the 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:40.980
 people seem to pay us to kill and 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:42.840
 they charge us for dying in 90% of the 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.310
 cases used as a decoy so 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.230
 Well, to play that, I prefer 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.180
 playing before the cti is like more honest is 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.560
 more sincere hey I want to kill then I 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.540
 I go in a game mode where he wins 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.680
 the one that kills the most 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.599
 and now you do not know very well why 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.030
 Well, I thought I'd like to have a 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:59.219
 armorer pretty kills four 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:03.120
