00:00:01.339 --> 00:00:05.210
 and now follow up quickly 

00:00:09.749 --> 00:00:13.929
 how, by the way, all the stories that this is our national dish 

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:17.679
 Rome in countries outside of Austria would not have been 

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:20.909
 one hundred percent and are therefore not recognized 

00:00:21.409 --> 00:00:25.559
 In addition, Samas would have to be rich in debate 

00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:28.279
 Schnitzel to have discovered in Milan 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:32.430
 Inextricably linked to the Wiener Schnitzel or Viennese cuisine are the 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.230
 Leave slides 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.230
 we look up the tradition and are right 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.230
 Schmitz was still up to date in 1905 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.860
 and since it is decent here 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.100
 gets set 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.430
 that the CD Müller between Schanz and Palermo as it says so beautiful that 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.430
 best known example 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.480
 that's something special 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.560
 that with these 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:06.120
 Peat house in Wollzeile 5 has become synonymous with a whole host of varieties 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.510
 Sculpting the secret is probably the money-hungry Ruhr 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.250
 rising quality that we offer here in this house 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.250
 and so Anderl Molterer and just pushed us down 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.049
 Deuce is already too long and Philipp Baltus not at first with them 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:23.290
 Vienna is unthinkable so the finish is next 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:24.920
 Tradition he lives us 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.370
 from the stone 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.420
 has for us and I am supposed to go to Cairo 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.300
 child 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.590
 decompose exhausted 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.040
 which is then used in various forms 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.040
 from the different temperatures to the data 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.430
 Käßmann had it for the men 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.060
 the 1905 you committed Hans like the men 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:52.380
 November 1961 and the two other local opened that are 19 and 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.139
 the one in Bäckerstraße only a few meters from the Wollzeile 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.450
 in the 1860s partner is a well-preserved target the basement 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.870
 whose goal with the concorde- shaped a special flair 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:08.789
 exudes 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.259
 Traditions Materne history and runs a formative much like men in the 

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:14.359
 Bäckerstraße 

00:02:14.359 --> 00:02:18.479
 and that's not just talking about food playing wine in an orphanage 

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:22.359
 naturally a big role and they are home grown 

00:02:22.889 --> 00:02:25.889
 But then we have a long tradition 

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:31.149
 We had a winehouse fire where several wanted to hit 

00:02:31.149 --> 00:02:31.909
 left 

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:34.819
 before we even got with the restaurant 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:39.529
 After World War II, Tom established gastronomy there 

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:44.079
 that is, what can you dine for that is where we are today 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:45.439
 world famous that 

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:48.439
 Schmid's Russia and yet known to our country 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:51.719
 Meanwhile we try 

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:55.930
 Complete range of wines to cover that is white wines red wines from Rech 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.069
 Key is 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:01.689
 we produce everything ourselves we attach particular importance to the quality 

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:04.689
 our wines smoked well again 

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:12.979
 for that will bring 10 afterwards 

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:18.279
 that the idea is in the Grinzinger road 55 Bofinger among strangers 

00:03:18.279 --> 00:03:23.429
 and there arose a modern tavern yes they are right with sunny 

00:03:23.429 --> 00:03:26.289
 Beer garden in a pleasant quiet location 

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:31.929
 5 off on the clear varieties for sure that mixed a wheat beer a dark one in 

00:03:31.929 --> 00:03:36.239
 Austria's unique gusset or that is specifically capable of being resolved 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:39.619
 The last g bring even spoiled the league 3 persist 

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:44.790
 Kilian Wenger stands for three things without which one does not live in Austria 

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:49.709
 wants and can have a nice beer and a glass of good wine 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:50.919
 excellent remedy
