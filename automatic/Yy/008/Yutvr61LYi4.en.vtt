update<00:00:06.299> everybody's<00:00:07.259> been<00:00:07.379> talking<00:00:07.500> about

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
update everybody's been talking about

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:09.650 
update everybody's been talking about
how<00:00:07.950> difficult<00:00:08.460> hero<00:00:08.670> trials<00:00:09.059> is<00:00:09.240> arrow

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
how difficult hero trials is arrow

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.680 
how difficult hero trials is arrow
towers<00:00:09.990> really<00:00:10.349> aren't<00:00:10.679> doing<00:00:10.860> a<00:00:11.099> thing<00:00:11.340> so<00:00:12.269> we

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
towers really aren't doing a thing so we

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:13.730 
towers really aren't doing a thing so we
need<00:00:12.870> to<00:00:12.990> come<00:00:13.290> up<00:00:13.349> with<00:00:13.469> a<00:00:13.620> different

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
need to come up with a different

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.010 
need to come up with a different
strategy<00:00:14.099> and<00:00:14.610> it<00:00:15.269> seems<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:15.570> best<00:00:15.750> type<00:00:15.990> of

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
strategy and it seems the best type of

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.290 
strategy and it seems the best type of
strategy<00:00:16.350> is<00:00:16.770> to<00:00:16.800> use<00:00:17.160> magic<00:00:17.520> towers<00:00:18.000> for<00:00:18.180> the

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
strategy is to use magic towers for the

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.970 
strategy is to use magic towers for the
stuns<00:00:18.600> so<00:00:19.230> you'll<00:00:19.350> have<00:00:19.470> to<00:00:19.529> have<00:00:19.770> high

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
stuns so you'll have to have high

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.480 
stuns so you'll have to have high
Garrison's<00:00:20.609> for<00:00:20.910> it<00:00:21.060> but<00:00:21.750> it's<00:00:21.930> really<00:00:22.140> for<00:00:22.260> a

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:22.490 
Garrison's for it but it's really for a

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.730 
Garrison's for it but it's really for a
endgame<00:00:23.490> user<00:00:24.210> it's<00:00:24.900> not<00:00:25.080> for<00:00:25.320> one<00:00:25.500> of<00:00:25.590> the

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
endgame user it's not for one of the

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.529 
endgame user it's not for one of the
average<00:00:26.099> users<00:00:26.760> it's<00:00:27.029> for<00:00:27.210> somebody<00:00:27.510> that

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
average users it's for somebody that

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.830 
average users it's for somebody that
wants<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:28.640> complete<00:00:29.640> hero<00:00:29.880> trials<00:00:30.300> up<00:00:30.539> to<00:00:30.689> wave

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
wants to complete hero trials up to wave

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.770 
wants to complete hero trials up to wave
12<00:00:31.230> if<00:00:31.500> possible<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.279> I<00:00:33.180> think<00:00:33.239> I've<00:00:33.540> come<00:00:33.750> up

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
12 if possible and I think I've come up

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.090 
12 if possible and I think I've come up
with<00:00:33.899> a<00:00:34.020> base<00:00:34.260> design<00:00:34.620> that<00:00:34.800> might<00:00:34.950> be

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
with a base design that might be

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.490 
with a base design that might be
possible<00:00:35.719> you'll<00:00:36.719> see<00:00:36.899> here<00:00:37.079> I've<00:00:37.170> got<00:00:37.200> air

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
possible you'll see here I've got air

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.530 
possible you'll see here I've got air
o-tar's<00:00:37.800> but<00:00:38.070> that's<00:00:38.219> only<00:00:38.399> because<00:00:38.520> I<00:00:39.180> don't

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
o-tar's but that's only because I don't

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:40.940 
o-tar's but that's only because I don't
feel<00:00:39.780> like<00:00:39.930> spending<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.379> money<00:00:40.500> just<00:00:40.860> to

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
feel like spending the money just to

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.430 
feel like spending the money just to
switch<00:00:41.190> them<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.550> magic<00:00:42.030> towers<00:00:42.360> I'm<00:00:42.870> not

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
switch them to magic towers I'm not

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.080 
switch them to magic towers I'm not
using<00:00:43.620> this<00:00:43.800> account<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.280> test<00:00:44.520> it<00:00:44.730> I'm<00:00:44.910> only

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
using this account to test it I'm only

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.610 
using this account to test it I'm only
using<00:00:45.270> this<00:00:45.539> account<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:46.050> test<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.440> base

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
using this account to test the base

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.970 
using this account to test the base
design<00:00:47.070> so<00:00:48.030> you<00:00:48.090> see<00:00:48.270> Magic<00:00:48.660> towers<00:00:48.960> have<00:00:49.200> 20

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
design so you see Magic towers have 20

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.910 
design so you see Magic towers have 20
range<00:00:50.360> which<00:00:51.360> is<00:00:51.629> exactly<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.440> same<00:00:52.649> as<00:00:52.829> an

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
range which is exactly the same as an

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.520 
range which is exactly the same as an
arrow<00:00:53.100> tower<00:00:53.870> so<00:00:54.870> what<00:00:55.020> I'm<00:00:55.110> showing<00:00:55.140> you<00:00:55.440> here

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
arrow tower so what I'm showing you here

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.099 
arrow tower so what I'm showing you here
is<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:56.610> range<00:00:56.969> of<00:00:57.149> arrow<00:00:57.390> towers<00:00:57.780> would<00:00:57.960> be

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
is the range of arrow towers would be

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.930 
is the range of arrow towers would be
the<00:00:58.260> same<00:00:58.440> as<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.590> magic<00:00:58.980> tower<00:00:59.190> let's<00:00:59.550> just<00:00:59.789> a

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
the same as a magic tower let's just a

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.420 
the same as a magic tower let's just a
suit<00:01:00.239> let's<00:01:00.449> just<00:01:00.800> think<00:01:01.800> that<00:01:02.070> i've<00:01:02.190> got

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
suit let's just think that i've got

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.070 
suit let's just think that i've got
magic<00:01:02.579> towers<00:01:03.090> in<00:01:03.210> this<00:01:03.300> video<00:01:03.600> even<00:01:03.660> though<00:01:03.989> i

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
magic towers in this video even though i

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.789 
magic towers in this video even though i
don't<00:01:04.170> it<00:01:05.159> really<00:01:05.369> doesn't<00:01:05.700> matter<00:01:05.790> uh<00:01:06.799> but

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
don't it really doesn't matter uh but

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.560 
don't it really doesn't matter uh but
what<00:01:08.010> i'm<00:01:08.189> showing<00:01:08.430> you<00:01:08.580> is<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.939> range<00:01:09.210> of<00:01:09.450> the

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
what i'm showing you is the range of the

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.330 
what i'm showing you is the range of the
hero<00:01:09.810> bases<00:01:10.200> in<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.380> range<00:01:10.590> of<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.920> towers

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
hero bases in the range of the towers

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.580 
hero bases in the range of the towers
you'll<00:01:12.240> see<00:01:12.390> that<00:01:12.540> they've<00:01:12.750> cover<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.290> good

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
you'll see that they've cover a good

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.039 
you'll see that they've cover a good
span<00:01:14.040> of<00:01:14.509> where<00:01:15.509> enemies<00:01:15.810> will<00:01:16.619> walk<00:01:17.009> by<00:01:18.049> so

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
span of where enemies will walk by so

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.300 
span of where enemies will walk by so
chances<00:01:19.409> are<00:01:19.560> they're<00:01:19.710> going<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:19.890> be<00:01:19.979> stunned

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
chances are they're going to be stunned

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.679 
chances are they're going to be stunned
and<00:01:20.490> your<00:01:20.610> heroes<00:01:21.000> will<00:01:21.180> be<00:01:21.299> able<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.479> take

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
and your heroes will be able to take

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.800 
and your heroes will be able to take
them<00:01:21.810> out<00:01:21.960> I<00:01:22.610> use<00:01:23.610> this<00:01:23.790> space<00:01:24.090> because<00:01:24.420> it

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
them out I use this space because it

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.410 
them out I use this space because it
manipulates<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.530> pathing<00:01:26.040> for<00:01:26.790> Heroes<00:01:27.240> it

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
manipulates the pathing for Heroes it

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.760 
manipulates the pathing for Heroes it
makes<00:01:27.600> them<00:01:27.750> walk<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.229> furthest<00:01:28.590> distance

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
makes them walk the furthest distance

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.399 
makes them walk the furthest distance
without<00:01:29.130> having<00:01:29.579> clutter<00:01:29.850> in<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.090> way<00:01:30.409> it

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
without having clutter in the way it

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.319 
without having clutter in the way it
covers<00:01:31.740> all<00:01:31.950> areas<00:01:32.009> of<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.610> map<00:01:32.790> I'll<00:01:33.090> show

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
covers all areas of the map I'll show

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.480 
covers all areas of the map I'll show
you<00:01:33.390> later<00:01:33.479> on<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:34.170> couple<00:01:34.799> different<00:01:35.009> spawn

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
you later on a couple different spawn

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:42.399 
you later on a couple different spawn
points<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.210> what<00:01:36.780> will<00:01:36.930> happen<00:01:39.590> and<00:01:40.590> I<00:01:41.360> used

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
points and what will happen and I used

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:45.289 
points and what will happen and I used
five<00:01:43.409> heroes<00:01:43.890> for<00:01:44.100> this<00:01:44.220> but<00:01:44.460> I<00:01:44.490> would<00:01:44.759> prefer

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
five heroes for this but I would prefer

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.940 
five heroes for this but I would prefer
to<00:01:45.570> have<00:01:45.810> six<00:01:47.270> you<00:01:48.270> see<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.600> patch<00:01:49.439> of<00:01:49.680> flowers

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
to have six you see the patch of flowers

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.800 
to have six you see the patch of flowers
there<00:01:50.369> I've<00:01:50.549> got<00:01:50.579> next<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.000> thunder<00:01:51.360> god<00:01:51.540> I

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
there I've got next to thunder god I

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.690 
there I've got next to thunder god I
would<00:01:52.290> put<00:01:52.500> a<00:01:52.530> sixth<00:01:52.979> hero<00:01:53.220> base<00:01:53.399> right<00:01:53.640> there

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
would put a sixth hero base right there

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.580 
would put a sixth hero base right there
and<00:01:53.970> that<00:01:54.630> keeps<00:01:54.899> them<00:01:55.110> pretty<00:01:55.320> close

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
and that keeps them pretty close

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.840 
and that keeps them pretty close
together<00:01:55.799> I<00:01:57.259> also<00:01:58.259> had<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.829> heroes<00:01:59.100> outside

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
together I also had the heroes outside

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.389 
together I also had the heroes outside
the<00:02:00.360> bottom<00:02:01.110> two<00:02:01.290> heroes<00:02:01.740> where<00:02:02.009> druid

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
the bottom two heroes where druid

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.819 
the bottom two heroes where druid
inamorta<00:02:02.880> are<00:02:03.270> there<00:02:03.960> outside<00:02:04.229> of<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.649> walls

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
inamorta are there outside of the walls

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.319 
inamorta are there outside of the walls
but<00:02:05.070> it<00:02:05.189> didn't<00:02:05.399> really<00:02:05.490> work<00:02:05.579> too<00:02:05.939> well<00:02:05.969> so<00:02:06.299> I

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
but it didn't really work too well so I

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:07.969 
but it didn't really work too well so I
moved<00:02:06.570> them<00:02:06.689> in<00:02:06.780> there<00:02:06.960> and<00:02:07.110> I<00:02:07.229> think<00:02:07.799> that's

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
moved them in there and I think that's

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.859 
moved them in there and I think that's
better<00:02:08.220> it<00:02:09.060> weighs<00:02:09.209> I'll<00:02:09.360> show<00:02:09.479> you<00:02:09.569> a<00:02:09.660> quick

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
better it weighs I'll show you a quick

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.370 
better it weighs I'll show you a quick
clip<00:02:10.470> of<00:02:11.900> course<00:02:12.900> I<00:02:13.050> get

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
clip of course I get

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.020 
clip of course I get
can<00:02:13.620> do<00:02:13.830> so<00:02:14.370> they're<00:02:14.580> gonna<00:02:14.700> absolutely

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
can do so they're gonna absolutely

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.820 
can do so they're gonna absolutely
obliterate<00:02:15.780> my<00:02:15.930> base<00:02:16.760> it's<00:02:17.760> not<00:02:17.880> the<00:02:18.150> best<00:02:18.420> I

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
obliterate my base it's not the best I

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.740 
obliterate my base it's not the best I
wanted<00:02:19.830> melee<00:02:20.370> heroes<00:02:20.610> but<00:02:21.150> not<00:02:21.450> really<00:02:21.720> a

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
wanted melee heroes but not really a

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.270 
wanted melee heroes but not really a
pumpkin<00:02:22.140> do<00:02:22.260> because<00:02:22.470> they're<00:02:22.620> gonna<00:02:22.710> walk<00:02:22.950> so

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
pumpkin do because they're gonna walk so

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.540 
pumpkin do because they're gonna walk so
fast<00:02:23.720> will<00:02:24.720> you<00:02:24.810> see<00:02:25.020> if<00:02:25.050> assume<00:02:25.770> I<00:02:26.040> had<00:02:26.280> magic

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
fast will you see if assume I had magic

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.610 
fast will you see if assume I had magic
towers<00:02:27.030> and<00:02:27.270> they<00:02:27.330> got<00:02:27.480> stunned<00:02:27.840> on<00:02:28.020> the<00:02:28.500> way

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
towers and they got stunned on the way

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.500 
towers and they got stunned on the way
around<00:02:28.950> there<00:02:29.130> would<00:02:29.970> have<00:02:30.030> done<00:02:30.150> pretty<00:02:30.300> good

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
around there would have done pretty good

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.420 
around there would have done pretty good
but<00:02:30.810> of<00:02:31.020> course<00:02:31.350> these<00:02:31.590> pumpkin<00:02:32.040> Dukes<00:02:32.220> are

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
but of course these pumpkin Dukes are

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.860 
but of course these pumpkin Dukes are
insane<00:02:32.850> so<00:02:33.120> they<00:02:33.240> just<00:02:33.420> blow<00:02:33.630> right<00:02:33.660> through

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
insane so they just blow right through

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.090 
insane so they just blow right through
it<00:02:35.300> haha<00:02:36.300> I<00:02:36.900> think<00:02:37.170> Eric<00:02:37.320> or<00:02:37.590> I<00:02:37.620> think<00:02:37.920> magic

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
it haha I think Eric or I think magic

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.530 
it haha I think Eric or I think magic
tower<00:02:38.370> is<00:02:38.490> really<00:02:38.760> the<00:02:38.850> only<00:02:38.910> way<00:02:39.270> you<00:02:39.330> can

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
tower is really the only way you can

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.420 
tower is really the only way you can
combat<00:02:39.840> those<00:02:40.050> pumpkin<00:02:40.530> dukes<00:02:40.770> and<00:02:41.190> I<00:02:41.280> don't

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
combat those pumpkin dukes and I don't

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.200 
combat those pumpkin dukes and I don't
even<00:02:41.520> know<00:02:41.730> if<00:02:41.760> that<00:02:41.970> would<00:02:42.090> be<00:02:42.120> possible

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
even know if that would be possible

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:43.910 
even know if that would be possible
you'd<00:02:42.750> have<00:02:42.870> to<00:02:42.990> get<00:02:43.110> extremely<00:02:43.530> lucky

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
you'd have to get extremely lucky

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.820 
you'd have to get extremely lucky
because<00:02:44.540> those<00:02:45.540> magic<00:02:46.230> tires<00:02:46.380> think<00:02:46.650> every

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
because those magic tires think every

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.770 
because those magic tires think every
two<00:02:47.010> seconds<00:02:47.490> they<00:02:47.940> stun<00:02:48.500> so<00:02:50.630> chances<00:02:51.630> are

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
two seconds they stun so chances are

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.000 
two seconds they stun so chances are
those<00:02:52.020> pumpkin<00:02:52.440> Dukes<00:02:52.620> are<00:02:52.740> going<00:02:52.860> to<00:02:52.920> run

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
those pumpkin Dukes are going to run

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.340 
those pumpkin Dukes are going to run
through<00:02:53.880> your<00:02:54.030> base<00:02:54.240> faster<00:02:55.020> than<00:02:55.170> they<00:02:55.290> can

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
through your base faster than they can

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.390 
through your base faster than they can
get<00:02:55.590> stunned<00:02:56.180> there's<00:02:57.180> really<00:02:57.600> no<00:02:57.980> no<00:02:58.980> base<00:02:59.190> to

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
get stunned there's really no no base to

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.550 
get stunned there's really no no base to
sign<00:02:59.580> that<00:02:59.760> can<00:02:59.880> combat<00:03:00.090> those<00:03:00.530> but<00:03:01.530> really

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
sign that can combat those but really

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
bust through the wall segments but there

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.030 
bust through the wall segments but there
I<00:03:50.670> like<00:03:50.820> to<00:03:51.000> have<00:03:51.150> the<00:03:51.420> open<00:03:51.930> spot<00:03:52.350> for<00:03:52.650> druid

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
I like to have the open spot for druid

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.199 
I like to have the open spot for druid
because<00:03:54.140> druid<00:03:55.140> is<00:03:55.230> ranged<00:03:55.740> and<00:03:55.920> it<00:03:56.730> can<00:03:56.910> tuck

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
because druid is ranged and it can tuck

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:00.050 
because druid is ranged and it can tuck
inside<00:03:57.690> of<00:03:57.900> that<00:03:57.990> little<00:03:58.290> gap<00:03:58.830> there<00:03:59.130> and<00:03:59.370> stay

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
inside of that little gap there and stay

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.170 
inside of that little gap there and stay
safe<00:04:00.330> behind<00:04:01.200> the<00:04:01.320> walls<00:04:01.490> but<00:04:02.490> for<00:04:02.790> a<00:04:02.820> male<00:04:03.060> a

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
safe behind the walls but for a male a

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.390 
safe behind the walls but for a male a
hero<00:04:03.420> like<00:04:03.720> a<00:04:03.959> more<00:04:04.230> tap<00:04:04.410> I<00:04:04.560> like<00:04:04.709> it<00:04:04.890> I<00:04:05.040> like<00:04:05.130> it

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
hero like a more tap I like it I like it

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.910 
hero like a more tap I like it I like it
closed<00:04:05.880> so<00:04:06.660> he<00:04:06.840> can<00:04:07.020> jump<00:04:07.200> over<00:04:07.440> the<00:04:07.530> wall<00:04:07.709> and

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
closed so he can jump over the wall and

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.420 
closed so he can jump over the wall and
attack<00:04:08.370> other<00:04:08.610> heroes<00:04:09.000> um<00:04:09.709> but<00:04:10.709> honestly<00:04:11.100> I

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
attack other heroes um but honestly I

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.820 
attack other heroes um but honestly I
think<00:04:11.520> two<00:04:12.450> ranged<00:04:12.959> heroes<00:04:13.020> is<00:04:13.440> the<00:04:13.590> best

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830 
think two ranged heroes is the best

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:18.949 
think two ranged heroes is the best
option<00:04:14.130> for<00:04:14.570> that<00:04:15.570> bottom<00:04:16.220> and<00:04:17.600> then<00:04:18.600> have<00:04:18.780> the

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
option for that bottom and then have the

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.880 
option for that bottom and then have the
melee<00:04:19.320> heroes<00:04:19.560> in<00:04:19.859> the<00:04:20.010> top<00:04:21.770> sections<00:04:22.770> that

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
melee heroes in the top sections that

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:24.510 
melee heroes in the top sections that
I've<00:04:23.010> got<00:04:23.190> there<00:04:23.370> where<00:04:23.490> the<00:04:23.580> Ninja<00:04:23.880> is

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
I've got there where the Ninja is

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.029 
I've got there where the Ninja is
all<00:04:25.300> right<00:04:25.419> there<00:04:25.629> you<00:04:25.780> see<00:04:25.960> I'm<00:04:26.199> just<00:04:26.470> taking

00:04:27.029 --> 00:04:27.039 
all right there you see I'm just taking

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:28.800 
all right there you see I'm just taking
it<00:04:27.160> from<00:04:27.250> two<00:04:27.550> different<00:04:27.789> angles<00:04:28.090> from<00:04:28.660> the

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
it from two different angles from the

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.420 
it from two different angles from the
left<00:04:28.990> side<00:04:29.169> and<00:04:29.470> from<00:04:29.680> the<00:04:29.770> right<00:04:29.889> side<00:04:30.129> to

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
left side and from the right side to

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.869 
left side and from the right side to
show<00:04:30.610> you<00:04:30.669> that<00:04:30.759> both<00:04:31.660> pathing<00:04:32.229> works<00:04:32.879> they

00:04:33.869 --> 00:04:33.879 
show you that both pathing works they

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:35.219 
show you that both pathing works they
don't<00:04:34.090> try<00:04:34.300> to<00:04:34.360> bust<00:04:34.569> through<00:04:34.690> the<00:04:34.810> walls<00:04:34.990> on

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:35.229 
don't try to bust through the walls on

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:36.839 
don't try to bust through the walls on
the<00:04:35.289> left<00:04:35.470> side<00:04:35.650> or<00:04:35.710> the<00:04:35.949> right<00:04:36.099> side<00:04:36.250> of<00:04:36.669> that

00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:36.849 
the left side or the right side of that

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:41.270 
the left side or the right side of that
bottom<00:04:37.270> tower<00:04:38.610> I'll<00:04:39.610> show<00:04:39.879> you<00:04:39.940> the<00:04:40.150> other

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
bottom tower I'll show you the other

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.279 
bottom tower I'll show you the other
segments<00:04:42.280> also<00:04:42.699> the<00:04:43.360> right<00:04:43.690> tower<00:04:43.900> and<00:04:44.229> the

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:44.289 
segments also the right tower and the

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:48.830 
segments also the right tower and the
top<00:04:44.770> left<00:04:45.039> tower<00:04:45.720> they're<00:04:46.720> both<00:04:46.990> fine

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
top left tower they're both fine

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.230 
top left tower they're both fine
everything<00:04:49.840> that<00:04:49.990> I<00:04:50.020> tested<00:04:50.879> regular<00:04:51.879> melee

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
everything that I tested regular melee

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.719 
everything that I tested regular melee
heroes<00:04:52.590> do<00:04:53.590> not<00:04:53.620> bust<00:04:54.039> through<00:04:54.220> the<00:04:54.310> walls<00:04:54.490> I

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:54.729 
heroes do not bust through the walls I

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:58.320 
heroes do not bust through the walls I
don't<00:04:54.970> really<00:04:55.090> care<00:04:55.330> about<00:04:55.449> druid<00:04:55.930> um<00:04:57.330> yeah

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
don't really care about druid um yeah

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.450 
don't really care about druid um yeah
they'll<00:04:58.840> range<00:04:59.110> your<00:04:59.319> towers<00:04:59.680> so<00:05:00.190> that's<00:05:00.370> a

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
they'll range your towers so that's a

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:01.550 
they'll range your towers so that's a
way<00:05:00.580> that<00:05:00.819> you're<00:05:00.909> gonna<00:05:00.970> have<00:05:01.180> to<00:05:01.300> sacrifice

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
way that you're gonna have to sacrifice

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.960 
way that you're gonna have to sacrifice
where<00:05:02.560> the<00:05:02.889> typical<00:05:03.250> basic<00:05:03.520> probably<00:05:03.819> could

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
where the typical basic probably could

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.700 
where the typical basic probably could
handle<00:05:04.240> druid<00:05:04.599> since<00:05:05.289> it's<00:05:05.440> one<00:05:05.590> of<00:05:05.650> the

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
handle druid since it's one of the

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:07.649 
handle druid since it's one of the
easier<00:05:06.009> ones<00:05:06.069> but<00:05:06.460> this<00:05:06.669> one<00:05:06.880> is<00:05:07.000> designed<00:05:07.389> to

00:05:07.649 --> 00:05:07.659 
easier ones but this one is designed to

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:11.939 
easier ones but this one is designed to
have<00:05:07.750> have<00:05:08.229> the<00:05:08.380> most<00:05:08.759> ground<00:05:09.759> covered<00:05:10.949> so

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:11.949 
have have the most ground covered so

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:14.520 
have have the most ground covered so
this<00:05:12.159> is<00:05:12.310> probably<00:05:12.819> going<00:05:13.810> to<00:05:13.990> have<00:05:14.110> the<00:05:14.319> best

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.530 
this is probably going to have the best

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:17.730 
this is probably going to have the best
chances<00:05:15.099> to<00:05:15.340> get<00:05:15.520> you<00:05:15.639> far<00:05:15.969> and<00:05:16.380> this<00:05:17.380> is<00:05:17.560> for

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:17.740 
chances to get you far and this is for

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:21.240 
chances to get you far and this is for
Town<00:05:18.009> Hall<00:05:18.219> level<00:05:18.250> 16<00:05:19.139> so<00:05:20.139> I've<00:05:20.229> only<00:05:20.380> got<00:05:20.560> 160

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:21.250 
Town Hall level 16 so I've only got 160

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:22.950 
Town Hall level 16 so I've only got 160
walls<00:05:21.460> and<00:05:21.699> there's<00:05:21.819> one<00:05:22.120> wall<00:05:22.389> segment<00:05:22.810> left

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:22.960 
walls and there's one wall segment left

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.809 
walls and there's one wall segment left
over<00:05:23.259> you<00:05:23.289> can<00:05:23.379> see<00:05:23.500> that<00:05:24.190> segments<00:05:24.699> in

00:05:24.809 --> 00:05:24.819 
over you can see that segments in

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:28.529 
over you can see that segments in
between<00:05:25.150> druid<00:05:25.509> Andy<00:05:25.719> more<00:05:25.930> tap<00:05:26.110> there<00:05:27.539> so

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:28.539 
between druid Andy more tap there so

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:30.300 
between druid Andy more tap there so
here<00:05:28.659> you<00:05:28.719> see<00:05:28.780> they<00:05:29.110> walk<00:05:29.500> around<00:05:29.710> it<00:05:30.099> takes

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:30.310 
here you see they walk around it takes

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:32.189 
here you see they walk around it takes
quite<00:05:30.669> a<00:05:30.729> while<00:05:30.849> just<00:05:31.300> to<00:05:31.449> walk<00:05:31.659> around<00:05:31.840> that

00:05:32.189 --> 00:05:32.199 
quite a while just to walk around that

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:35.510 
quite a while just to walk around that
and<00:05:32.409> it<00:05:33.009> works<00:05:33.190> for<00:05:33.430> all<00:05:33.580> three<00:05:33.969> sections<00:05:34.479> I

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:35.520 
and it works for all three sections I

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:41.990 
and it works for all three sections I
prefer<00:05:36.520> this<00:05:36.789> over<00:05:36.969> the<00:05:37.180> death<00:05:37.360> box<00:05:37.919> because

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.000 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.809 

it's<00:05:43.000> best<00:05:43.539> for<00:05:44.159> waves<00:05:45.159> that<00:05:45.400> come<00:05:45.610> from

00:05:45.809 --> 00:05:45.819 
it's best for waves that come from

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:48.689 
it's best for waves that come from
scattered<00:05:46.389> directions<00:05:46.930> if<00:05:47.490> everyone<00:05:48.490> came

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:48.699 
scattered directions if everyone came

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:50.010 
scattered directions if everyone came
from<00:05:48.849> the<00:05:48.969> same<00:05:49.090> direction<00:05:49.300> like<00:05:49.690> here<00:05:49.900> be

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:50.020 
from the same direction like here be

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.279 
from the same direction like here be
monsters<00:05:50.169> then<00:05:50.830> the<00:05:50.919> death<00:05:51.099> box<00:05:51.310> works<00:05:51.520> great

00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:52.289 
monsters then the death box works great

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:55.980 
monsters then the death box works great
but<00:05:53.289> I<00:05:53.500> prefer<00:05:53.830> this<00:05:54.099> for<00:05:54.669> hero<00:05:55.539> trials

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:55.990 
but I prefer this for hero trials

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:58.559 
but I prefer this for hero trials
assuming<00:05:56.800> that<00:05:56.830> the<00:05:57.130> magic<00:05:57.430> towers<00:05:57.699> work<00:05:57.940> now

00:05:58.559 --> 00:05:58.569 
assuming that the magic towers work now

00:05:58.569 --> 00:05:59.760 
assuming that the magic towers work now
I<00:05:58.599> would<00:05:58.690> love<00:05:58.840> for<00:05:59.020> somebody<00:05:59.319> to<00:05:59.349> test<00:05:59.620> that

00:05:59.760 --> 00:05:59.770 
I would love for somebody to test that

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:03.439 
I would love for somebody to test that
out<00:05:59.830> you'll<00:06:00.310> see<00:06:00.490> here<00:06:00.819> I'm<00:06:01.000> trying<00:06:01.389> to<00:06:01.599> last<00:06:01.870> a

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:03.449 
out you'll see here I'm trying to last a

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:07.260 
out you'll see here I'm trying to last a
drop<00:06:04.449> zone<00:06:04.479> approach<00:06:05.229> and<00:06:05.940> this<00:06:06.940> tower<00:06:07.150> is

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:07.270 
drop zone approach and this tower is

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:10.649 
drop zone approach and this tower is
also<00:06:07.810> safe<00:06:08.639> they<00:06:09.639> do<00:06:09.699> not<00:06:09.880> decide<00:06:10.360> to<00:06:10.539> go

00:06:10.649 --> 00:06:10.659 
also safe they do not decide to go

00:06:10.659 --> 00:06:15.360 
also safe they do not decide to go
through<00:06:10.870> the<00:06:10.960> walls<00:06:12.569> so<00:06:14.009> you<00:06:15.009> know<00:06:15.099> I'd<00:06:15.190> like

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:15.370 
through the walls so you know I'd like

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:17.249 
through the walls so you know I'd like
your<00:06:15.580> feedback<00:06:16.000> I'd<00:06:16.210> like<00:06:16.360> somebody<00:06:16.719> to<00:06:16.900> test

00:06:17.249 --> 00:06:17.259 
your feedback I'd like somebody to test

00:06:17.259 --> 00:06:20.129 
your feedback I'd like somebody to test
this<00:06:17.409> out<00:06:17.590> I<00:06:18.240> have<00:06:19.240> a<00:06:19.270> good<00:06:19.599> feeling<00:06:19.840> this

00:06:20.129 --> 00:06:20.139 
this out I have a good feeling this

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:23.519 
this out I have a good feeling this
might<00:06:20.380> work<00:06:20.699> of<00:06:21.699> course<00:06:22.060> if<00:06:22.270> you<00:06:22.389> add<00:06:22.630> walls

00:06:23.519 --> 00:06:23.529 
might work of course if you add walls

00:06:23.529 --> 00:06:25.830 
might work of course if you add walls
and<00:06:23.949> add<00:06:24.490> another<00:06:24.789> tower<00:06:25.060> I<00:06:25.389> guess<00:06:25.599> the<00:06:25.810> other

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:25.840 
and add another tower I guess the other

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:27.510 
and add another tower I guess the other
tower<00:06:26.289> would<00:06:26.529> go<00:06:26.680> somewhere<00:06:27.069> in<00:06:27.159> the<00:06:27.279> middle

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:27.520 
tower would go somewhere in the middle

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.059 
tower would go somewhere in the middle
and<00:06:28.090> you'd<00:06:28.900> have<00:06:29.080> to<00:06:29.229> move<00:06:29.380> the<00:06:29.409> hero<00:06:29.710> bases

00:06:30.059 --> 00:06:30.069 
and you'd have to move the hero bases

00:06:30.069 --> 00:06:35.040 
and you'd have to move the hero bases
accordingly<00:06:31.620> but<00:06:32.620> overall<00:06:32.949> arm<00:06:34.020> you<00:06:35.020> know

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:35.050 
accordingly but overall arm you know

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:37.170 
accordingly but overall arm you know
just<00:06:35.259> extend<00:06:35.860> the<00:06:36.250> walls<00:06:36.490> out<00:06:36.699> a<00:06:36.729> little<00:06:37.029> bit

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:37.180 
just extend the walls out a little bit

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:37.839 
just extend the walls out a little bit
further

00:06:37.839 --> 00:06:37.849 
further

00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:40.719 
further
and<00:06:38.559> you<00:06:39.559> could<00:06:39.740> manipulate<00:06:40.039> the<00:06:40.399> pathing

00:06:40.719 --> 00:06:40.729 
and you could manipulate the pathing

00:06:40.729 --> 00:06:44.559 
and you could manipulate the pathing
even<00:06:40.999> more<00:06:41.209> than<00:06:41.539> before<00:06:42.699> so<00:06:43.699> it<00:06:44.089> might<00:06:44.330> it

00:06:44.559 --> 00:06:44.569 
even more than before so it might it

00:06:44.569 --> 00:06:47.409 
even more than before so it might it
might<00:06:44.629> be<00:06:45.050> a<00:06:45.080> nice<00:06:45.259> base<00:06:45.529> to<00:06:45.559> try<00:06:46.270> alright<00:06:47.270> guys

00:06:47.409 --> 00:06:47.419 
might be a nice base to try alright guys

00:06:47.419 --> 00:06:49.589 
might be a nice base to try alright guys
