hello my good friend Harry up in Canada

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:07.010 
hello my good friend Harry up in Canada
wants<00:00:05.370> to<00:00:05.460> know<00:00:05.640> how<00:00:06.509> they've<00:00:06.750> been<00:00:06.870> working

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
wants to know how they've been working

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.110 
wants to know how they've been working
on<00:00:07.350> this<00:00:07.560> bridge<00:00:07.890> and<00:00:08.040> what<00:00:08.160> do<00:00:08.220> I<00:00:08.309> do<00:00:08.370> to<00:00:08.730> it<00:00:08.849> so

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
on this bridge and what do I do to it so

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.810 
on this bridge and what do I do to it so
uh<00:00:09.469> anyways<00:00:10.469> this<00:00:10.710> is<00:00:10.830> the<00:00:11.010> bridge<00:00:11.250> it's<00:00:11.580> by

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
uh anyways this is the bridge it's by

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.079 
uh anyways this is the bridge it's by
micro<00:00:12.690> engineering<00:00:13.290> and<00:00:13.590> it's<00:00:14.070> a<00:00:14.280> tall<00:00:14.759> steel

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
micro engineering and it's a tall steel

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:16.970 
micro engineering and it's a tall steel
viaduct<00:00:15.750> and<00:00:15.990> we<00:00:16.080> got<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:16.410> longer<00:00:16.710> one<00:00:16.859> the

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
viaduct and we got the longer one the

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.810 
viaduct and we got the longer one the
210-foot<00:00:17.609> one<00:00:18.650> and<00:00:19.650> what<00:00:19.800> we're<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.430> problem

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
210-foot one and what we're the problem

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.450 
210-foot one and what we're the problem
with<00:00:21.029> we<00:00:21.930> have<00:00:22.050> such<00:00:22.260> a<00:00:22.289> long<00:00:22.560> span<00:00:23.070> and<00:00:23.340> it's

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
with we have such a long span and it's

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.550 
with we have such a long span and it's
plastic<00:00:23.760> is<00:00:24.240> that<00:00:24.539> as<00:00:24.630> you<00:00:24.779> run<00:00:25.019> three<00:00:25.289> or<00:00:25.320> four

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
plastic is that as you run three or four

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.439 
plastic is that as you run three or four
engines<00:00:25.920> over<00:00:26.220> it<00:00:26.369> we<00:00:26.849> want<00:00:27.060> a<00:00:27.090> little<00:00:27.210> more

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
engines over it we want a little more

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.900 
engines over it we want a little more
strength<00:00:27.810> a<00:00:27.960> little<00:00:28.109> more<00:00:28.230> rigidity<00:00:28.560> so<00:00:29.039> what

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
strength a little more rigidity so what

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.950 
strength a little more rigidity so what
I<00:00:29.939> did<00:00:30.060> was<00:00:30.510> take<00:00:30.800> some<00:00:31.800> aluminum<00:00:32.700> stock<00:00:33.059> and

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
I did was take some aluminum stock and

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.540 
I did was take some aluminum stock and
this<00:00:34.079> is<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.410> stuff<00:00:34.680> that<00:00:34.710> you<00:00:35.010> put<00:00:35.219> over<00:00:35.340> the

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
this is the stuff that you put over the

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.930 
this is the stuff that you put over the
end<00:00:35.700> of<00:00:35.880> a<00:00:36.000> 3/4<00:00:36.690> inch<00:00:36.719> plywood<00:00:37.140> so<00:00:37.860> it<00:00:38.640> looks

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
end of a 3/4 inch plywood so it looks

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.979 
end of a 3/4 inch plywood so it looks
like<00:00:39.649> just<00:00:40.649> a<00:00:40.860> u-shaped<00:00:41.700> there's<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.660> view<00:00:42.870> of

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
like just a u-shaped there's a view of

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.400 
like just a u-shaped there's a view of
it<00:00:43.110> there<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:44.360> again<00:00:45.360> it's<00:00:45.510> for<00:00:45.660> 3/4<00:00:46.230> inch

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
it there and again it's for 3/4 inch

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.639 
it there and again it's for 3/4 inch
plywood<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:47.670> what<00:00:47.879> I<00:00:47.910> did<00:00:48.210> was<00:00:49.079> drew<00:00:49.410> it<00:00:49.500> out

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
plywood and what I did was drew it out

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.889 
plywood and what I did was drew it out
on<00:00:49.950> this<00:00:50.940> board<00:00:51.649> which<00:00:52.649> is<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.100> same<00:00:53.899> radius

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
on this board which is the same radius

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.549 
on this board which is the same radius
34<00:00:55.770> inches<00:00:56.100> that<00:00:56.280> we<00:00:56.460> have<00:00:56.670> on<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.000> climb<00:00:57.570> the

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
34 inches that we have on the climb the

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.939 
34 inches that we have on the climb the
most<00:00:58.739> important<00:00:59.309> parts<00:00:59.640> are<00:00:59.730> where<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.090> two

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:00.949 
most important parts are where the two

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:05.509 
most important parts are where the two
supports<00:01:03.140> connect<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.439> bridge<00:01:04.739> so<00:01:05.339> those

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
supports connect to the bridge so those

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.070 
supports connect to the bridge so those
have<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:05.970> be<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.210> same<00:01:06.390> size<00:01:06.689> that's<00:01:06.869> where

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
have to be the same size that's where

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.590 
have to be the same size that's where
they're<00:01:07.260> in<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.439> dark<00:01:08.030> darker<00:01:09.030> black<00:01:09.270> and

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
they're in the dark darker black and

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.600 
they're in the dark darker black and
then<00:01:09.810> in<00:01:09.930> between<00:01:10.049> is<00:01:10.619> where<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:11.040> other<00:01:11.189> spans

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
then in between is where the other spans

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.929 
then in between is where the other spans
will<00:01:11.880> go<00:01:12.030> across<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:13.020> what<00:01:13.260> I<00:01:13.290> did<00:01:13.560> was<00:01:13.939> every

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
will go across and what I did was every

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.149 
will go across and what I did was every
curve<00:01:15.180> is<00:01:15.299> different<00:01:15.810> but<00:01:16.110> for<00:01:16.140> our<00:01:16.470> curve<00:01:16.799> I

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
curve is different but for our curve I

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.490 
curve is different but for our curve I
ended<00:01:17.670> up<00:01:17.790> taking<00:01:18.060> out<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:18.450> little<00:01:18.720> triangle<00:01:19.259> of

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
ended up taking out a little triangle of

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.039 
ended up taking out a little triangle of
the<00:01:19.619> piece<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.310> you<00:01:20.970> can<00:01:21.150> see<00:01:21.450> where<00:01:22.020> I

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
the piece and you can see where I

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.429 
the piece and you can see where I
spliced<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:23.100> there<00:01:23.430> I'm<00:01:24.390> actually<00:01:24.600> about<00:01:25.110> five

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
spliced it there I'm actually about five

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.149 
spliced it there I'm actually about five
places<00:01:27.049> and<00:01:28.049> then<00:01:28.200> what<00:01:28.290> I<00:01:28.320> did<00:01:28.439> is<00:01:28.619> after<00:01:29.130> I

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
places and then what I did is after I

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.830 
places and then what I did is after I
took<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.640> splice<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.210> triangle<00:01:30.750> out

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
took the splice the triangle out

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.929 
took the splice the triangle out
according<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:32.100> angles<00:01:32.460> that<00:01:32.610> I<00:01:32.640> needed

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
according to a the angles that I needed

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.530 
according to a the angles that I needed
I<00:01:33.270> drilled<00:01:34.140> holes<00:01:34.170> in<00:01:34.829> each<00:01:35.100> of<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.549> different

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
I drilled holes in each of the different

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.920 
I drilled holes in each of the different
parts<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:38.090> then<00:01:39.090> what<00:01:39.210> I<00:01:39.240> had<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:39.570> do<00:01:39.720> that<00:01:39.869> for

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
parts and then what I had to do that for

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.170 
parts and then what I had to do that for
was<00:01:40.590> so<00:01:40.740> I<00:01:40.770> could<00:01:41.040> attach<00:01:41.369> it<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.820> this<00:01:41.939> piece

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
was so I could attach it to this piece

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.010 
was so I could attach it to this piece
of<00:01:42.210> wood<00:01:43.189> and<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.280> reason<00:01:44.579> I<00:01:44.670> did<00:01:44.850> that<00:01:44.880> was<00:01:45.479> so

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
of wood and the reason I did that was so

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:53.740 
of wood and the reason I did that was so
that<00:01:46.409> I<00:01:46.470> could<00:01:47.899> turn<00:01:48.899> it<00:01:48.960> over<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.350> show<00:01:49.710> you

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.660 

you<00:01:54.750> can<00:01:54.930> see<00:01:55.110> that<00:01:55.229> I<00:01:55.290> had<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.590> put<00:01:55.799> bolts<00:01:56.070> and

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
you can see that I had to put bolts and

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.480 
you can see that I had to put bolts and
little<00:01:57.600> plates<00:01:57.990> on<00:01:58.829> each<00:01:59.460> one<00:01:59.729> of<00:01:59.880> the

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
little plates on each one of the

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.090 
little plates on each one of the
connections<00:02:02.750> and<00:02:03.750> I<00:02:04.049> put<00:02:04.229> lock<00:02:04.439> washers<00:02:04.950> in

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
connections and I put lock washers in

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.570 
connections and I put lock washers in
there<00:02:05.340> as<00:02:05.460> well<00:02:05.899> and<00:02:06.899> then<00:02:07.229> what<00:02:07.409> I<00:02:07.439> did<00:02:07.580> after

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
there as well and then what I did after

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.580 
there as well and then what I did after
I<00:02:08.879> got<00:02:09.060> that<00:02:09.300> all<00:02:09.509> residents<00:02:09.690> I<00:02:10.140> took<00:02:10.349> it<00:02:10.470> off

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
I got that all residents I took it off

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.550 
I got that all residents I took it off
the<00:02:10.619> board<00:02:11.099> and<00:02:11.459> they<00:02:12.360> used<00:02:12.629> epoxy

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
the board and they used epoxy

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.760 
the board and they used epoxy
glue<00:02:15.410> the<00:02:16.410> different<00:02:16.830> spans<00:02:17.780> and<00:02:18.780> also<00:02:19.140> some

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
glue the different spans and also some

glue the different spans and also some
of<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:20.010> underside<00:02:20.580> to<00:02:21.540> the<00:02:22.940> to<00:02:23.940> the<00:02:24.060> piece<00:02:24.270> of

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
of the underside to the to the piece of

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.140 
of the underside to the to the piece of
metal<00:02:24.840> and<00:02:25.110> now<00:02:26.010> we<00:02:26.069> have<00:02:26.400> a<00:02:26.430> span<00:02:26.819> that<00:02:27.030> you

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
see the metal in between and the track

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.900 
see the metal in between and the track
is<00:02:31.410> gonna<00:02:31.590> go<00:02:31.770> over<00:02:31.920> the<00:02:32.130> top<00:02:32.840> so<00:02:34.370> after<00:02:35.370> a<00:02:35.400> lot

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
is gonna go over the top so after a lot

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:36.620 
is gonna go over the top so after a lot
of<00:02:36.120> work

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
of work

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.400 
of work
we<00:02:37.470> finished<00:02:37.890> the<00:02:38.600> two<00:02:39.600> stands<00:02:39.989> and<00:02:40.319> they're

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
we finished the two stands and they're

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.680 
we finished the two stands and they're
just<00:02:40.590> barely<00:02:40.950> in<00:02:41.160> place<00:02:41.400> right<00:02:41.670> now<00:02:41.850> because

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
just barely in place right now because

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.780 
just barely in place right now because
we're<00:02:43.590> just<00:02:43.620> trying<00:02:44.010> to<00:02:44.069> figure<00:02:44.280> out<00:02:44.520> where<00:02:44.700> it

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
we're just trying to figure out where it

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.280 
we're just trying to figure out where it
is<00:02:44.880> and<00:02:45.120> I'm<00:02:45.450> trying<00:02:45.630> to<00:02:45.750> show<00:02:45.840> you<00:02:46.019> what's

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
is and I'm trying to show you what's

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.479 
is and I'm trying to show you what's
going<00:02:46.350> on<00:02:46.850> so<00:02:47.850> we<00:02:48.330> had<00:02:48.480> to<00:02:48.630> cut<00:02:48.840> two<00:02:49.110> grooves

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
going on so we had to cut two grooves

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:53.270 
going on so we had to cut two grooves
for<00:02:50.489> the<00:02:50.610> for<00:02:51.120> the<00:02:51.209> u-shape<00:02:51.660> and<00:02:51.900> at<00:02:52.890> the<00:02:53.070> end

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
for the for the u-shape and at the end

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.430 
for the for the u-shape and at the end
of<00:02:53.700> this<00:02:54.030> you<00:02:54.690> can<00:02:54.870> see<00:02:55.110> there's<00:02:55.290> another

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
of this you can see there's another

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.350 
of this you can see there's another
piece<00:02:55.890> of<00:02:55.950> metal<00:02:56.400> in<00:02:56.519> there<00:02:56.730> and<00:02:56.880> between<00:02:57.030> the

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
piece of metal in there and between the

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.020 
piece of metal in there and between the
two<00:02:57.540> of<00:02:57.720> them<00:02:57.870> they<00:02:58.650> equal<00:02:59.280> the<00:02:59.400> exact<00:02:59.790> height

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
two of them they equal the exact height

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.780 
two of them they equal the exact height
of<00:03:00.090> the<00:03:00.390> cork<00:03:00.750> and<00:03:01.280> so<00:03:02.280> if<00:03:02.400> you<00:03:02.489> give<00:03:02.640> me<00:03:02.760> a

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
of the cork and so if you give me a

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:09.880 
of the cork and so if you give me a
second

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.820 

it<00:03:10.890> slides<00:03:11.250> in<00:03:11.550> there<00:03:12.319> you<00:03:13.319> can<00:03:13.500> see<00:03:13.530> the

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
it slides in there you can see the

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.620 
it slides in there you can see the
connection<00:03:14.400> there<00:03:14.580> it's<00:03:14.760> exactly<00:03:15.239> the<00:03:15.450> same

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
connection there it's exactly the same

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.310 
connection there it's exactly the same
height<00:03:15.900> and<00:03:16.970> we're<00:03:17.970> gonna<00:03:18.060> screw<00:03:18.630> and<00:03:18.930> then

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
height and we're gonna screw and then

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.340 
height and we're gonna screw and then
epoxy<00:03:20.070> that<00:03:20.269> to<00:03:21.269> the<00:03:21.390> end<00:03:21.540> of<00:03:21.630> the<00:03:21.690> table<00:03:22.079> here

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
epoxy that to the end of the table here

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.970 
epoxy that to the end of the table here
and<00:03:22.680> then<00:03:23.640> to<00:03:23.820> keep<00:03:24.000> the<00:03:24.500> supports<00:03:25.500> level

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
and then to keep the supports level

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.710 
and then to keep the supports level
we're<00:03:26.790> gonna<00:03:26.910> just<00:03:27.269> shimmy<00:03:27.720> in<00:03:27.989> the<00:03:28.799> different

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
we're gonna just shimmy in the different

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.500 
we're gonna just shimmy in the different
sizes<00:03:30.720> we<00:03:31.049> need<00:03:31.079> to<00:03:31.410> attach<00:03:31.680> it<00:03:31.890> to<00:03:32.010> a<00:03:32.040> bridge

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
sizes we need to attach it to a bridge

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.180 
sizes we need to attach it to a bridge
and<00:03:33.510> after<00:03:33.840> we<00:03:33.930> get<00:03:34.049> the<00:03:34.230> right<00:03:34.410> height<00:03:34.709> on

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
and after we get the right height on

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.670 
and after we get the right height on
both<00:03:35.730> of<00:03:35.940> these<00:03:36.150> we're<00:03:36.750> take<00:03:37.019> it<00:03:37.140> all<00:03:37.260> off<00:03:37.470> and

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
both of these we're take it all off and

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.830 
both of these we're take it all off and
paint<00:03:38.579> the<00:03:38.790> whole<00:03:38.910> thing<00:03:38.970> once<00:03:39.450> it's<00:03:39.660> all

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
paint the whole thing once it's all

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.240 
paint the whole thing once it's all
glued<00:03:40.079> and<00:03:40.380> then<00:03:40.470> we<00:03:40.620> can<00:03:40.769> just<00:03:40.920> put<00:03:41.100> it<00:03:41.220> right

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
glued and then we can just put it right

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.430 
glued and then we can just put it right
back<00:03:41.370> in<00:03:41.730> place<00:03:41.910> so<00:03:42.900> that's<00:03:43.079> where<00:03:43.260> we<00:03:43.410> are

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
back in place so that's where we are

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.170 
back in place so that's where we are
right<00:03:43.739> now<00:03:43.799> so<00:03:44.400> what<00:03:44.459> the<00:03:44.609> bridge<00:03:44.790> kind<00:03:45.090> of

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
right now so what the bridge kind of

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.060 
right now so what the bridge kind of
looks<00:03:45.329> like<00:03:45.530> we're<00:03:46.530> thinking<00:03:46.829> it<00:03:46.920> looks

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
looks like we're thinking it looks

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:48.229 
looks like we're thinking it looks
pretty<00:03:47.370> good<00:03:47.519> so<00:03:47.760> far

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
pretty good so far

pretty good so far
