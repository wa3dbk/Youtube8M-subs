because<00:00:51.030> I'll<00:00:51.180> go<00:00:51.329> so<00:00:51.539> concerned<00:00:51.870> with

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
because I'll go so concerned with

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.290 
because I'll go so concerned with
setting<00:00:52.320> up<00:00:52.379> stealth<00:00:52.680> rocks<00:00:52.920> but<00:00:53.730> then<00:00:54.090> at<00:00:54.270> the

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
setting up stealth rocks but then at the

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.540 
setting up stealth rocks but then at the
same<00:00:54.390> time<00:00:54.840> I<00:00:54.899> do<00:00:55.079> have<00:00:55.410> my<00:00:55.590> defog<00:00:56.010> scissor<00:00:56.340> and

same time I do have my defog scissor and

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.760 
same time I do have my defog scissor and

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
at that point I figured it wasn't in my

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.500 
at that point I figured it wasn't in my
best<00:00:59.039> interest<00:00:59.550> to<00:00:59.609> set<00:00:59.879> up<00:00:59.969> stealth<00:01:00.239> rocks

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
best interest to set up stealth rocks

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.390 
best interest to set up stealth rocks
when<00:01:00.750> I<00:01:00.930> was<00:01:01.079> probably<00:01:01.710> going<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.489> end<00:01:02.520> up<00:01:04.400> when

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
I was probably going to end up

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.990 
I was probably going to end up
defaulting<00:01:07.710> them<00:01:08.070> away<00:01:08.280> anyway<00:01:08.670> so<00:01:08.729> he<00:01:08.909> goes

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
defaulting them away anyway so he goes

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.149 
defaulting them away anyway so he goes
for<00:01:09.210> an<00:01:09.270> earthquake<00:01:09.740> unfortunately<00:01:10.740> he<00:01:10.979> gets

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
for an earthquake unfortunately he gets

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.520 
for an earthquake unfortunately he gets
a<00:01:11.310> crit<00:01:11.580> on<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.909> first<00:01:12.180> turn<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:12.960> takes<00:01:13.380> out

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
stealth rocks so I had to do this

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.250 
stealth rocks so I had to do this
basically<00:02:54.709> it's<00:02:55.040> not<00:02:55.510> like<00:02:56.510> obviously<00:02:56.989> it

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
basically it's not like obviously it

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.720 
basically it's not like obviously it
wouldn't<00:02:57.500> really<00:02:57.650> make<00:02:57.920> sense<00:02:58.220> unless<00:02:58.459> I

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
wouldn't really make sense unless I

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.670 
wouldn't really make sense unless I
explained<00:02:59.150> it<00:02:59.330> but<00:02:59.480> I<00:02:59.540> felt<00:02:59.930> like<00:02:59.989> it<00:03:00.380> was

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
explained it but I felt like it was

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.309 
explained it but I felt like it was
worth<00:03:01.069> it<00:03:01.310> for<00:03:01.580> me<00:03:01.610> to<00:03:01.730> Sax's<00:03:02.420> or<00:03:02.630> to<00:03:02.930> a<00:03:02.959> burn

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:03.319 
worth it for me to Sax's or to a burn

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:06.309 
worth it for me to Sax's or to a burn
and<00:03:03.680> get<00:03:04.670> the<00:03:04.970> rocks<00:03:05.180> off<00:03:05.480> my<00:03:05.780> side<00:03:06.080> of<00:03:06.110> the

field and then keep scissor around
honestly<00:03:11.000> especially<00:03:11.420> because<00:03:11.630> I<00:03:11.720> do<00:03:11.780> have

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
other priority Pokemon if I really

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.810 
other priority Pokemon if I really

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019 
best way that I can so now I figured the

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:10.479 
best way that I can so now I figured the
best<00:04:09.200> thing<00:04:09.500> for<00:04:09.680> me<00:04:09.890> to<00:04:09.950> go<00:04:10.130> into<00:04:10.280> now<00:04:10.459> is

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.489 
best thing for me to go into now is

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:13.930 
best thing for me to go into now is
melodic<00:04:11.239> because<00:04:11.720> I'm<00:04:12.019> burned<00:04:12.859> there's<00:04:13.700> I

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
melodic because I'm burned there's I

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:15.729 
melodic because I'm burned there's I
don't<00:04:14.209> think<00:04:14.450> Sharpedo<00:04:14.900> can<00:04:15.170> set<00:04:15.410> up<00:04:15.530> other

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739 
don't think Sharpedo can set up other

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:17.770 
don't think Sharpedo can set up other
than<00:04:16.010> try<00:04:16.370> and<00:04:16.400> go<00:04:16.609> for<00:04:16.669> speedboost<00:04:17.239> so<00:04:17.479> he<00:04:17.630> can

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
than try and go for speedboost so he can

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.900 
than try and go for speedboost so he can
crunch<00:04:18.140> me<00:04:18.410> the<00:04:18.979> only<00:04:19.250> bad<00:04:19.370> thing<00:04:19.430> that<00:04:19.669> can

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
crunch me the only bad thing that can

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.390 
crunch me the only bad thing that can
happen<00:04:19.940> is<00:04:20.419> that<00:04:20.720> I<00:04:20.780> like<00:04:21.320> I<00:04:21.440> do<00:04:21.500> here<00:04:21.950> I<00:04:22.010> lose

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
happen is that I like I do here I lose

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.890 
happen is that I like I do here I lose
my

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
my

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.590 
my
ben's<00:04:23.320> and<00:04:23.650> i<00:04:24.550> just<00:04:24.759> decided<00:04:25.060> to<00:04:25.240> go<00:04:25.360> for<00:04:25.540> a

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
ben's and i just decided to go for a

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.930 
ben's and i just decided to go for a
scald<00:04:25.930> here<00:04:26.350> I'm<00:04:26.590> more<00:04:26.919> so<00:04:27.160> hoping<00:04:27.610> that<00:04:27.790> I<00:04:27.820> can

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
scald here I'm more so hoping that I can

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:29.640 
scald here I'm more so hoping that I can
just<00:04:28.120> get<00:04:28.270> damaged<00:04:28.660> off<00:04:28.810> on<00:04:28.990> him<00:04:29.199> rather<00:04:29.470> than

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
just get damaged off on him rather than

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.920 
just get damaged off on him rather than
burn<00:04:30.040> at<00:04:30.490> this<00:04:30.729> point<00:04:30.940> burn<00:04:31.240> would<00:04:31.479> be<00:04:31.630> nice

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
burn at this point burn would be nice

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.010 
burn at this point burn would be nice
but<00:04:31.960> I'm<00:04:32.350> not<00:04:32.620> banking<00:04:33.039> on<00:04:33.370> it<00:04:33.580> so<00:04:34.120> now<00:04:34.720> that<00:04:34.750> he

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
but I'm not banking on it so now that he

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:36.990 
but I'm not banking on it so now that he
did<00:04:35.289> get<00:04:35.530> the<00:04:35.710> defense<00:04:36.100> drop<00:04:36.400> I<00:04:36.550> figured<00:04:36.850> it's

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
did get the defense drop I figured it's

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.330 
did get the defense drop I figured it's
not<00:04:37.180> my<00:04:37.419> best<00:04:37.630> interest<00:04:38.320> to<00:04:38.440> keep<00:04:38.470> melodic<00:04:39.130> in

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
not my best interest to keep melodic in

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.249 
not my best interest to keep melodic in
so<00:04:39.580> I'm<00:04:39.669> going<00:04:39.820> to<00:04:39.850> go<00:04:40.030> into<00:04:40.150> scizor<00:04:40.660> as<00:04:40.870> fodder

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:41.259 
so I'm going to go into scizor as fodder

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:43.469 
so I'm going to go into scizor as fodder
and<00:04:41.410> hope<00:04:41.710> that<00:04:41.889> he<00:04:41.949> can<00:04:42.130> kill<00:04:42.370> it<00:04:42.520> off<00:04:42.669> with<00:04:43.449> a

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:43.479 
and hope that he can kill it off with a

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:45.689 
and hope that he can kill it off with a
crunch<00:04:43.930> because<00:04:44.169> steel<00:04:45.009> does<00:04:45.190> not<00:04:45.340> resist

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:45.699 
crunch because steel does not resist

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:48.060 
crunch because steel does not resist
dark<00:04:46.270> anymore<00:04:46.539> so<00:04:46.930> luckily<00:04:47.259> he<00:04:47.500> takes<00:04:47.770> scissor

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
dark anymore so luckily he takes scissor

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.340 
dark anymore so luckily he takes scissor
out<00:04:48.430> as<00:04:48.729> planned<00:04:49.449> because<00:04:49.720> it's<00:04:49.960> supposed<00:04:50.289> to

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.350 
out as planned because it's supposed to

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.200 
out as planned because it's supposed to
be<00:04:50.470> a<00:04:50.500> father<00:04:50.770> and<00:04:51.039> then<00:04:51.610> I<00:04:51.699> can<00:04:51.880> just<00:04:51.910> bring

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210 
be a father and then I can just bring

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.590 
be a father and then I can just bring
him<00:04:52.360> a<00:04:52.389> lot<00:04:52.600> again<00:04:52.900> again<00:04:53.199> and<00:04:54.240> Milotic<00:04:55.240> can

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.740 
him a lot again again and Milotic can
take<00:04:56.039> torpedoes<00:04:57.039> hits<00:04:57.400> for<00:04:57.729> days<00:04:57.880> I<00:04:58.210> figured

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.750 
take torpedoes hits for days I figured

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.210 
take torpedoes hits for days I figured
he<00:04:58.840> was<00:04:58.960> going<00:04:59.080> to<00:04:59.139> just<00:04:59.320> keep<00:04:59.500> crunching<00:04:59.860> me

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.220 
he was going to just keep crunching me

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:01.560 
he was going to just keep crunching me
because<00:05:00.520> i<00:05:00.610> knows<00:05:00.789> moveset<00:05:01.300> now<00:05:01.419> it's

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 
because i knows moveset now it's

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:04.230 
because i knows moveset now it's
probably<00:05:02.139> crunch<00:05:02.940> waterfall<00:05:03.940> and

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 
probably crunch waterfall and

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.659 
probably crunch waterfall and
earthquakes<00:05:04.840> so<00:05:05.110> he<00:05:05.289> has<00:05:05.380> nothing<00:05:05.770> to<00:05:06.100> set<00:05:06.460> up

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:06.669 
earthquakes so he has nothing to set up

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:08.790 
earthquakes so he has nothing to set up
with<00:05:07.330> so<00:05:07.810> i<00:05:07.840> don't<00:05:08.110> have<00:05:08.139> to<00:05:08.260> be<00:05:08.440> scared<00:05:08.500> about

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:08.800 
with so i don't have to be scared about

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.350 
with so i don't have to be scared about
that<00:05:08.949> so<00:05:09.430> what<00:05:09.610> i'm<00:05:09.699> going<00:05:09.789> to<00:05:09.850> end<00:05:09.910> up<00:05:10.090> doing

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
that so what i'm going to end up doing

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.330 
that so what i'm going to end up doing
is<00:05:10.449> I'm<00:05:10.570> going<00:05:10.660> to<00:05:10.750> end<00:05:10.900> up<00:05:11.020> recovering<00:05:11.620> with

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.340 
is I'm going to end up recovering with

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.379 
is I'm going to end up recovering with
the<00:05:12.669> burn<00:05:12.940> it<00:05:13.270> does<00:05:13.570> suck<00:05:14.050> but<00:05:14.400> he's<00:05:15.400> also<00:05:15.820> life

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:16.389 
the burn it does suck but he's also life

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:20.010 
the burn it does suck but he's also life
formed<00:05:16.810> and<00:05:17.020> he's<00:05:17.349> also<00:05:17.590> trying<00:05:18.160> to<00:05:18.870> kill<00:05:19.870> me

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:20.020 
formed and he's also trying to kill me

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:21.990 
formed and he's also trying to kill me
although<00:05:20.530> I<00:05:20.580> honestly<00:05:21.580> thought<00:05:21.789> at<00:05:21.970> some

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 
although I honestly thought at some

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.719 
although I honestly thought at some
point<00:05:22.389> he<00:05:22.479> might<00:05:22.720> switch<00:05:22.990> out<00:05:23.199> so<00:05:23.949> I<00:05:23.979> feel<00:05:24.520> like

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:24.729 
point he might switch out so I feel like

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:27.240 
point he might switch out so I feel like
me<00:05:25.509> keeping<00:05:25.960> on<00:05:26.080> going<00:05:26.110> for<00:05:26.470> covers<00:05:26.889> isn't

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250 
me keeping on going for covers isn't

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:28.680 
me keeping on going for covers isn't
also<00:05:27.370> the<00:05:27.610> best<00:05:27.789> thing<00:05:28.000> in<00:05:28.120> case<00:05:28.300> for<00:05:28.570> some

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:28.690 
also the best thing in case for some

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:32.339 
also the best thing in case for some
reason<00:05:29.020> his<00:05:29.139> eyes<00:05:29.349> to<00:05:29.620> switch<00:05:29.889> out<00:05:30.130> and<00:05:31.349> yes

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:32.349 
reason his eyes to switch out and yes

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:35.790 
reason his eyes to switch out and yes
and<00:05:32.680> what<00:05:33.280> do<00:05:33.340> you<00:05:33.400> call<00:05:33.520> it<00:05:33.580> go<00:05:33.849> for<00:05:34.710> some<00:05:35.710> kind

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:35.800 
and what do you call it go for some kind

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.310 
and what do you call it go for some kind
of<00:05:35.889> other<00:05:36.070> Pokemon<00:05:36.460> but<00:05:36.729> I<00:05:37.030> also<00:05:37.570> figured<00:05:37.900> that

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:38.320 
of other Pokemon but I also figured that

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:39.930 
of other Pokemon but I also figured that
I'm<00:05:38.650> just<00:05:38.889> gonna<00:05:38.979> go<00:05:39.070> force<00:05:39.400> called<00:05:39.639> here<00:05:39.909> i

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:39.940 
I'm just gonna go force called here i

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:41.730 
I'm just gonna go force called here i
mean<00:05:40.180> i<00:05:40.240> could<00:05:40.360> have<00:05:40.630> theoretically<00:05:41.380> just

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:41.740 
mean i could have theoretically just

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.469 
mean i could have theoretically just
kept<00:05:41.949> recovering<00:05:42.699> but<00:05:42.820> at<00:05:42.940> the<00:05:43.060> same<00:05:43.210> time<00:05:43.419> I

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:43.479 
kept recovering but at the same time I

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:45.089 
kept recovering but at the same time I
really<00:05:43.840> don't<00:05:44.020> want<00:05:44.199> to<00:05:44.289> be<00:05:44.380> that<00:05:44.409> douchebag

00:05:45.089 --> 00:05:45.099 
really don't want to be that douchebag

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:46.770 
really don't want to be that douchebag
you<00:05:45.340> know<00:05:45.460> with<00:05:45.729> melodic<00:05:46.090> just<00:05:46.630> keep

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:46.780 
you know with melodic just keep

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.710 
you know with melodic just keep
recovering<00:05:47.349> so<00:05:47.680> I'm<00:05:48.250> at<00:05:48.520> above<00:05:48.970> half<00:05:49.360> right

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:49.720 
recovering so I'm at above half right

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.930 
recovering so I'm at above half right
now<00:05:49.930> although<00:05:50.530> after<00:05:50.740> burn<00:05:51.099> I<00:05:51.130> think<00:05:51.460> I<00:05:51.550> get

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:51.940 
now although after burn I think I get

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:53.550 
now although after burn I think I get
taken<00:05:52.599> down<00:05:52.630> to<00:05:52.930> a<00:05:52.960> little<00:05:53.139> bit<00:05:53.349> less<00:05:53.530> than

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:53.560 
taken down to a little bit less than

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.219 
taken down to a little bit less than
half<00:05:53.919> so<00:05:54.280> now<00:05:54.909> he<00:05:54.970> goes<00:05:55.240> into<00:05:55.300> his<00:05:55.630> star<00:05:55.990> after

00:05:56.219 --> 00:05:56.229 
half so now he goes into his star after

00:05:56.229 --> 00:05:58.649 
half so now he goes into his star after
I<00:05:56.590> thought<00:05:57.430> that<00:05:57.610> honestly<00:05:58.060> with<00:05:58.300> the<00:05:58.419> burn

00:05:58.649 --> 00:05:58.659 
I thought that honestly with the burn

00:05:58.659 --> 00:06:00.779 
I thought that honestly with the burn
that<00:05:58.960> I<00:05:59.020> could<00:05:59.229> take<00:05:59.440> whatever<00:05:59.830> he<00:06:00.070> hasn't<00:06:00.699> I

00:06:00.779 --> 00:06:00.789 
that I could take whatever he hasn't I

00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:04.200 
that I could take whatever he hasn't I
live<00:06:01.210> with<00:06:01.539> one<00:06:02.020> I<00:06:02.380> literally<00:06:03.250> live<00:06:03.639> with<00:06:03.909> one
