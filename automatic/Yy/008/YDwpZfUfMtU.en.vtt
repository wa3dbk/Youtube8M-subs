really know what I wanted to be when I

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:53.380 
really know what I wanted to be when I
grew<00:01:51.619> up<00:01:51.649> but<00:01:52.040> I<00:01:52.220> always<00:01:52.520> kind<00:01:52.850> of<00:01:52.909> felt<00:01:53.149> like<00:01:53.240> I

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
grew up but I always kind of felt like I

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.090 
grew up but I always kind of felt like I
leaned<00:01:53.720> towards<00:01:54.049> a<00:01:54.259> job<00:01:54.740> that<00:01:54.979> had<00:01:55.070> a

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
leaned towards a job that had a

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.969 
leaned towards a job that had a
connection<00:01:55.369> with<00:01:55.580> you<00:01:56.119> know<00:01:56.180> the<00:01:56.330> outdoors

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
connection with you know the outdoors

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:59.020 
connection with you know the outdoors
learning<00:01:57.979> a<00:01:58.039> lot<00:01:58.130> about<00:01:58.190> myself<00:01:58.490> and<00:01:58.940> about

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
learning a lot about myself and about

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.270 
learning a lot about myself and about
what<00:01:59.330> I<00:01:59.360> want<00:01:59.570> to<00:01:59.630> do<00:01:59.720> with<00:01:59.840> my<00:01:59.990> life<00:02:00.170> I<00:02:00.440> really

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
what I want to do with my life I really

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.830 
what I want to do with my life I really
want<00:02:01.460> to<00:02:01.490> work<00:02:01.610> with<00:02:01.670> renewable<00:02:02.270> energies<00:02:02.630> and

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
want to work with renewable energies and

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.410 
want to work with renewable energies and
i<00:02:03.440> think<00:02:03.800> that<00:02:03.979> the<00:02:04.310> education<00:02:05.030> that<00:02:05.060> I<00:02:05.179> get<00:02:05.330> at

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
i think that the education that I get at
