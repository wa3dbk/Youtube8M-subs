silver<00:01:52.770> or<00:01:52.920> 0<00:01:53.220> trophies<00:01:53.939> or<00:01:54.180> maybe<00:01:54.450> just<00:01:54.540> stay

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
silver or 0 trophies or maybe just stay

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.319 
silver or 0 trophies or maybe just stay
up<00:01:54.840> here<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.320> then<00:01:56.040> race<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.430> see<00:01:56.909> if<00:01:57.060> you<00:01:57.180> get

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
up here and then race to see if you get

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.609 
up here and then race to see if you get
the<00:01:57.479> forest<00:01:58.820> so<00:01:59.820> I<00:02:00.210> guess<00:02:00.479> that's<00:02:00.899> it<00:02:01.049> for<00:02:01.110> the

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
the forest so I guess that's it for the

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:02.990 
the forest so I guess that's it for the
last<00:02:01.770> episode<00:02:02.070> because<00:02:02.610> there's<00:02:02.880> nothing

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
last episode because there's nothing

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.209 
last episode because there's nothing
really<00:02:03.299> to<00:02:03.509> do<00:02:03.750> it's<00:02:04.290> more<00:02:04.469> like<00:02:04.530> an<00:02:04.860> update

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
really to do it's more like an update

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.419 
really to do it's more like an update
video<00:02:05.369> but<00:02:05.790> I<00:02:06.060> guess<00:02:06.600> will<00:02:06.780> toggle<00:02:06.990> it

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:07.429 
video but I guess will toggle it

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:11.070 
video but I guess will toggle it
