before this is basically just a bigger
version<00:00:47.879> it<00:00:48.239> seems<00:00:48.570> like<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:49.250> it's<00:00:50.250> kind<00:00:50.640> of

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
version it seems like and it's kind of

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.360 
version it seems like and it's kind of
under<00:00:51.390> a<00:00:51.770> mountain<00:00:52.770> it<00:00:52.890> seems<00:00:53.100> like<00:00:53.219> it<00:00:53.340> just

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
under a mountain it seems like it just

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.450 
under a mountain it seems like it just
goes<00:00:53.640> into<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:54.120> little<00:00:54.420> mountain<00:00:54.870> here<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.649> you

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
goes into a little mountain here and you

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.099 
goes into a little mountain here and you
just<00:00:56.489> got<00:00:56.789> this<00:00:57.090> you<00:00:57.510> know<00:00:57.539> it's<00:00:57.780> kind<00:00:57.960> of<00:00:58.020> the

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
just got this you know it's kind of the

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.270 
just got this you know it's kind of the
same<00:00:58.379> thing

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
same thing

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.279 
same thing
if<00:01:00.030> this<00:01:00.180> goes<00:01:00.420> straight<00:01:00.719> down<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:00.989> little

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
if this goes straight down a little

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.349 
if this goes straight down a little
curves<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:02.039> little<00:01:02.250> bit<00:01:02.399> right<00:01:02.579> over<00:01:02.789> here

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
curves a little bit right over here

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.460 
curves a little bit right over here
and<00:01:04.290> that's<00:01:05.189> some<00:01:05.339> lava<00:01:05.580> some<00:01:06.030> water<00:01:06.299> a<00:01:06.780> crap

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
and that's some lava some water a crap

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.000 
and that's some lava some water a crap
ton<00:01:07.680> of<00:01:07.740> coal<00:01:08.100> there<00:01:09.030> is<00:01:09.450> some<00:01:10.320> caves<00:01:10.619> that<00:01:10.799> go

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
ton of coal there is some caves that go

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.310 
ton of coal there is some caves that go
out<00:01:11.250> there's<00:01:11.880> this<00:01:12.119> there's<00:01:12.600> this<00:01:12.750> one<00:01:13.110> over

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
out there's this there's this one over

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
really only two but if you go down deep

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.510 
really only two but if you go down deep
into<00:01:18.990> this<00:01:19.140> one<00:01:19.409> there<00:01:19.619> is<00:01:19.650> a<00:01:19.830> cave<00:01:20.280> system

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
into this one there is a cave system

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.240 
into this one there is a cave system
down<00:01:20.939> there<00:01:20.970> that<00:01:21.450> leaves<00:01:21.689> leads<00:01:22.259> to<00:01:22.530> ravines

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
down there that leaves leads to ravines

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.190 
down there that leaves leads to ravines
and<00:01:23.549> apparently<00:01:24.240> I<00:01:24.330> heard<00:01:24.720> that<00:01:24.960> there's

yeah I would definitely suggest checking
out<00:01:49.140> this<00:01:49.409> crater<00:01:49.860> it's<00:01:50.490> definitely<00:01:51.030> really

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
out this crater it's definitely really

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.800 
out this crater it's definitely really
really<00:01:51.659> cool<00:01:52.170> lots<00:01:52.950> of<00:01:53.189> fun
