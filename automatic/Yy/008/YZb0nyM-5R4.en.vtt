and there's a lot of debate on which

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.349 
and there's a lot of debate on which
month<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:01.440> do<00:01:01.590> I<00:01:01.800> personally<00:01:02.280> did<00:01:02.760> that<00:01:02.940> I'm<00:01:03.120> a

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
month to do I personally did that I'm a

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.299 
month to do I personally did that I'm a
very<00:01:03.539> long<00:01:03.809> time<00:01:04.019> ago<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.439> added<00:01:04.650> on<00:01:04.830> drydock

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
very long time ago and added on drydock

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.030 
very long time ago and added on drydock
that<00:01:06.060> worked<00:01:06.330> perfectly<00:01:06.810> well<00:01:07.020> for<00:01:07.049> me<00:01:07.380> so<00:01:07.590> if

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
that worked perfectly well for me so if

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.760 
that worked perfectly well for me so if
you<00:01:08.070> do<00:01:08.490> dry<00:01:08.700> dock<00:01:08.970> then<00:01:09.330> on<00:01:09.570> you<00:01:09.720> go<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:10.140> lot<00:01:10.680> of

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
you do dry dock then on you go a lot of

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.399 
you do dry dock then on you go a lot of
people<00:01:11.010> prefer<00:01:11.220> trenches<00:01:11.970> so<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.049> reason<00:01:13.350> I

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
people prefer trenches so the reason I

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.800 
people prefer trenches so the reason I
like<00:01:13.619> dry<00:01:13.860> dog<00:01:14.130> or<00:01:14.430> I<00:01:14.729> was<00:01:15.360> one<00:01:15.479> of<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.630> foster

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
like dry dog or I was one of the foster

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.570 
like dry dog or I was one of the foster
no<00:01:16.170> I<00:01:16.200> said<00:01:16.560> but<00:01:16.770> you<00:01:16.920> don't<00:01:17.130> actually<00:01:17.250> need<00:01:17.520> to

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
no I said but you don't actually need to

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.330 
no I said but you don't actually need to
destroy<00:01:18.030> any<00:01:18.330> cover<00:01:18.689> so<00:01:19.500> basically<00:01:19.950> see<00:01:20.159> if<00:01:20.250> we

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
destroy any cover so basically see if we

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.850 
destroy any cover so basically see if we
go<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.729> more<00:01:21.119> are<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.630> one<00:01:22.350> short<00:01:22.560> side

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
go to the more are and one short side

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.890 
go to the more are and one short side
you<00:01:23.369> can<00:01:23.549> always<00:01:23.729> jump<00:01:24.060> over<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.479> walls<00:01:24.689> to

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
you can always jump over the walls to

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.390 
you can always jump over the walls to
get<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.200> mud<00:01:25.350> with<00:01:25.530> them<00:01:25.619> up<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:26.040> then<00:01:26.310> you

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
get to the mud with them up and then you

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.580 
get to the mud with them up and then you
can<00:01:26.580> move<00:01:26.729> use<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.360> bridge<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.840> get<00:01:27.960> across<00:01:28.350> to

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
can move use the bridge to get across to

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.300 
can move use the bridge to get across to
the<00:01:28.680> other<00:01:28.770> side<00:01:29.070> of<00:01:29.130> them<00:01:29.400> up<00:01:29.520> as<00:01:29.790> well<00:01:30.720> so<00:01:31.310> you

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
the other side of them up as well so you

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.770 
the other side of them up as well so you
basically<00:01:32.490> don't<00:01:32.909> need<00:01:33.030> to<00:01:33.119> destroy<00:01:33.479> any

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
basically don't need to destroy any

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.530 
basically don't need to destroy any
walls<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.650> fortifications<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:36.060> stuff<00:01:36.270> and

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
walls and fortifications and stuff and

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.380 
walls and fortifications and stuff and
it's<00:01:36.869> really<00:01:37.049> easy<00:01:37.229> to<00:01:37.290> get<00:01:37.500> around<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.860> map

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
it's really easy to get around the map

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.850 
it's really easy to get around the map
so<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:39.780> basically<00:01:40.140> what<00:01:40.380> you're<00:01:40.500> going<00:01:40.619> to<00:01:40.680> do

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
so and basically what you're going to do

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.499 
so and basically what you're going to do
is<00:01:41.070> essentially<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.759> attacker<00:01:42.030> we're<00:01:42.360> going

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
is essentially the attacker we're going

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.600 
is essentially the attacker we're going

barriers and stuff like that so and a
bazooka<00:03:01.590> you<00:03:02.219> can<00:03:02.370> just<00:03:02.549> keep<00:03:02.699> the<00:03:02.879> knot<00:03:03.120> and

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:03.359 
bazooka you can just keep the knot and

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:06.199 
bazooka you can just keep the knot and
as<00:03:03.569> you<00:03:03.780> can<00:03:03.989> watch<00:03:04.260> the<00:03:04.500> the<00:03:05.280> enemies<00:03:05.609> you'll

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
as you can watch the the enemies you'll

as you can watch the the enemies you'll
get<00:03:06.389> money<00:03:06.629> so<00:03:06.930> if<00:03:07.049> your<00:03:07.319> bazooka<00:03:07.680> dies<00:03:08.010> you

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:08.219 
get money so if your bazooka dies you

00:03:08.219 --> 00:03:10.909 
get money so if your bazooka dies you
can<00:03:08.400> redo<00:03:08.730> that<00:03:08.879> so<00:03:09.150> it's<00:03:09.359> like<00:03:09.709> you'll<00:03:10.709> never

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:10.919 
can redo that so it's like you'll never

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:12.890 
can redo that so it's like you'll never
run<00:03:11.129> out<00:03:11.189> of<00:03:11.310> money<00:03:11.430> you'll<00:03:12.180> also<00:03:12.389> be<00:03:12.629> walking

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
run out of money you'll also be walking

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.250 
run out of money you'll also be walking
on<00:03:12.959> worthless<00:03:13.319> you<00:03:14.069> need<00:03:14.189> to<00:03:14.310> go<00:03:14.810> 1,100<00:03:15.810> humans

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
on worthless you need to go 1,100 humans

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.170 
on worthless you need to go 1,100 humans
and<00:03:16.500> then<00:03:16.859> again<00:03:17.159> the<00:03:17.340> bazooka<00:03:17.819> is<00:03:17.970> the

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
and then again the bazooka is the

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.939 
and then again the bazooka is the
fastest<00:03:18.720> and<00:03:18.930> most<00:03:18.959> effective<00:03:19.319> way<00:03:19.680> to<00:03:19.859> do
