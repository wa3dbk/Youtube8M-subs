00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
this is a really nice cover case

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.570 
this is a really nice cover case
combination<00:00:18.930> that<00:00:19.410> incorporates<00:00:19.949> d3o

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
combination that incorporates d3o

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.290 
combination that incorporates d3o
technology<00:00:21.390> now<00:00:22.140> d3o<00:00:22.710> technology<00:00:23.400> is<00:00:23.609> shown

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
technology now d3o technology is shown

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.150 
technology now d3o technology is shown
here<00:00:24.600> by<00:00:24.779> this<00:00:24.840> orange<00:00:25.439> material<00:00:25.830> that's

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
here by this orange material that's

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.700 
here by this orange material that's
embedded<00:00:26.730> into<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.269> case<00:00:27.510> and<00:00:27.810> it's<00:00:28.619> a

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
embedded into the case and it's a

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.130 
embedded into the case and it's a
material<00:00:29.130> that<00:00:29.279> remains<00:00:29.640> pliable<00:00:30.240> until<00:00:31.019> it

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
material that remains pliable until it

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.069 
material that remains pliable until it
meets<00:00:31.349> some<00:00:31.650> sort<00:00:31.890> impact<00:00:32.489> or<00:00:32.790> shock<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:33.450> when

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
meets some sort impact or shock and when

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.540 
meets some sort impact or shock and when
it<00:00:34.170> does<00:00:34.350> that<00:00:34.380> so<00:00:34.860> if<00:00:34.950> you<00:00:35.040> drop<00:00:35.309> your<00:00:35.520> phone

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
it does that so if you drop your phone

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.940 
it does that so if you drop your phone
in<00:00:35.880> it<00:00:35.969> lands<00:00:36.300> on<00:00:36.390> a<00:00:36.450> hard<00:00:36.750> surface<00:00:36.950> this

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
in it lands on a hard surface this

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.040 
in it lands on a hard surface this
becomes<00:00:38.460> more<00:00:38.700> rigid<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.270> gives<00:00:39.540> you<00:00:39.660> extra

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
becomes more rigid and gives you extra

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.080 
becomes more rigid and gives you extra
impact<00:00:40.620> protection<00:00:40.800> so<00:00:41.489> really<00:00:41.940> nice

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
impact protection so really nice

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.209 
impact protection so really nice
technology<00:00:42.719> to<00:00:42.960> incorporate<00:00:43.620> into<00:00:43.800> a<00:00:43.950> phone

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219
