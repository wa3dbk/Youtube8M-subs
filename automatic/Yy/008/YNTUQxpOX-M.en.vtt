00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:09.849
 you found me with your hands in the 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:12.519
 mass' I do not know who has the flour that 

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:14.730
 It makes me so good 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:17.410
 jose maria perez knows a lot about how 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.949
 organize how to put together that volcano that 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:23.650
 you say the masters in bakers and for 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:25.570
 that's going to start sharing your recipe with 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.570
 we good to start we're going to 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.010
 make a small volcano we stretch the 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:34.470
 flour 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:34.470
 then we throw an egg 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.000
 a little bit of yeast 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.820
 with a little salt 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.670
 made of olives 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:55.300
 White wine 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:58.750
 the white wine did not taste good are 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:01.329
 tricks and a little bit of water the water 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:04.960
 tempered very important explain us by 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:07.630
 what and why of the good wine that every 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.940
 one has his recipe and I always base 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.940
 well everyone does their own way and 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:15.950
 I do not like it 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:19.080
 the way you like very well let's 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.040
 how can we until everything little by little 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.380
 go catching 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.660
 while you go while you are taking 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:29.470
 I'm going to tell you how josemaría 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:31.840
 It takes 22 years in the white cross is 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.990
 Galician restaurants do not and that's why 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.370
 that accent that we have today 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.980
 on the white cross specifically of 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:42.040
 marqués de vadillo where he is 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:45.400
 making this great empanada that 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:48.040
 we will end up stuffing with cod and 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.830
 raisins let's see after 20 minutes 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:53.740
 see if josemaría is so kind to me and 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:56.229
 you show us how the mass has evolved 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.840
 once it has fermented we have it here 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.220
 we're going to stay like this after an average 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.710
 hour 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:06.130
 and then it extends to him to know 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.780
 throwing a little bit of sand and we started 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:11.220
 to knead 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.220
 as many times as it takes 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:18.050
 you will like finita you like going to 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.050
 make two or how is this pie going to be 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:26.910
 good is going to have two layers already 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.280
 I say that is that will be the one above and 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.140
 the other the bottom one, we leave to 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.959
 josemaría and let's meet Luis 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.670
 fernandez the also cook of the cross 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.670
 white to whom marqués de vadillo 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:43.250
 let's see how to prepare the filling 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.250
 louis if you're so kind we start 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.290
 this is what in Galicia is called smooth 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.290
 or the sofrito 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:55.610
 this one that we go and red pepper and onion 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:58.610
 the empanadas can house the 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.950
 the richest delicacies the most unusual 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:05.180
 the cheapest the easier the more 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:09.280
 simple in this case I think that this 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.280
 is typical of Galicia 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:20.200
 of cod and raisins what a rich contrast 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:22.900
 this sweet this salty we try it 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:26.230
 stirring and when it seems you throw the 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:29.109
 tomato please and I while telling 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.700
 That Luis Fernandez is that I have 

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:33.700
 counted this afternoon I find it very curious 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:36.340
 it's from cangas de narcea is between 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:39.579
 asturias galicia león and from where they have 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.590
 came out almost all the serene that there was 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:43.560
 in Madrid on your skin it is true that there 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.430
 many serene 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.430
 in the years 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:04:01.040
 so much 50 the funny thing is true truth that 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.780
 it's cangas de narcea good but it's already 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.110
 many years that is in Madrid truth 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.110
 louis 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.020
 we have added the tomato and we will see 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.670

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:16.390

 waiting urgently for you to take the 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:22.590
 cod to see the cod belongs to 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:26.870
 now it is detached or is chopped 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:28.940
 They were a great loins 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.940
 of a cod because we do not know if it is 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:34.970
