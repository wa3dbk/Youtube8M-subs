able<00:04:47.560> to<00:04:48.990> let's<00:04:49.990> see<00:04:52.620> trying<00:04:53.620> to<00:04:53.710> figure<00:04:53.979> out

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.010 
able to let's see trying to figure out

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:57.960 
able to let's see trying to figure out
exactly<00:04:55.260> where<00:04:56.260> you<00:04:56.530> can<00:04:56.680> stand<00:04:57.039> for<00:04:57.550> this<00:04:57.789> to

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:57.970 
exactly where you can stand for this to

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.420 
exactly where you can stand for this to
be<00:04:58.120> optimal<00:04:58.810> I<00:04:58.990> do<00:04:59.650> know<00:04:59.889> you<00:04:59.949> can<00:05:00.220> like

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
be optimal I do know you can like

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.129 
be optimal I do know you can like
there's<00:05:00.940> a<00:05:01.000> certain<00:05:01.270> spot<00:05:01.570> think<00:05:01.900> you<00:05:01.990> can

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:02.139 
there's a certain spot think you can

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:03.840 
there's a certain spot think you can
jump<00:05:02.380> up<00:05:02.470> on<00:05:02.650> top<00:05:02.860> of<00:05:02.919> that<00:05:03.220> and<00:05:03.430> you<00:05:03.520> can<00:05:03.669> keep

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:03.850 
jump up on top of that and you can keep

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:06.360 
jump up on top of that and you can keep
killing<00:05:04.240> the<00:05:04.360> guys<00:05:04.539> it<00:05:05.470> really<00:05:05.500> just<00:05:05.979> depends

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
killing the guys it really just depends

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.250 
killing the guys it really just depends
I<00:05:06.729> think<00:05:06.760> you<00:05:07.000> can<00:05:07.150> actually<00:05:07.419> stand<00:05:07.630> even<00:05:07.870> over

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.260 
I think you can actually stand even over

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.050 
I think you can actually stand even over
there<00:05:08.500> and<00:05:08.740> they'll<00:05:08.860> keep<00:05:09.070> spawning<00:05:09.340> I'm

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060 
there and they'll keep spawning I'm

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.570 
there and they'll keep spawning I'm
gonna<00:05:10.330> just<00:05:10.600> test<00:05:10.840> this<00:05:11.020> real<00:05:11.289> quick<00:05:11.580> let's

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
gonna just test this real quick let's

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.700
