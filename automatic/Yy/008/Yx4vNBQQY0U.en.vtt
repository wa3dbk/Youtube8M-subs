Bishop<00:01:39.640> before<00:01:40.120> a<00:01:40.150> move<00:01:40.450> like<00:01:40.690> III<00:01:41.409> which

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
Bishop before a move like III which

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.219 
Bishop before a move like III which
would<00:01:42.130> lock<00:01:42.370> it<00:01:42.610> and<00:01:42.760> to<00:01:43.450> threaten<00:01:43.900> the<00:01:44.020> knight

Castle kingside if we look at the

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.520 
Castle kingside if we look at the
position<00:03:38.579> now<00:03:39.120> we<00:03:39.420> see<00:03:39.690> that<00:03:39.840> white<00:03:40.140> has<00:03:40.500> a

position now we see that white has a
development<00:03:41.340> advantage<00:03:41.880> but<00:03:42.540> the<00:03:42.720> question

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
development advantage but the question

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.130 
development advantage but the question
might<00:03:43.500> arise<00:03:43.890> what<00:03:44.430> to<00:03:44.579> do<00:03:44.700> next<00:03:44.940> the<00:03:45.780> answer

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
might arise what to do next the answer

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.840 
might arise what to do next the answer
is<00:03:46.170> that<00:03:46.320> white<00:03:46.709> should<00:03:46.920> play<00:03:47.130> Bishop<00:03:47.400> to<00:03:47.670> d3

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
is that white should play Bishop to d3

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.150 
is that white should play Bishop to d3
