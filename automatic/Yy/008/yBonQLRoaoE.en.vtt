the hops were pretty good so it's pretty

beech trees growing locally they

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.780 
beech trees growing locally they
harvested<00:03:12.320> them<00:03:12.530> they<00:03:12.920> shaved<00:03:13.310> them<00:03:13.489> into

chips that were slightly curved they

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.460 
chips that were slightly curved they
boiled<00:03:16.610> them<00:03:16.730> at<00:03:16.880> that<00:03:17.030> time<00:03:17.300> in<00:03:17.450> caustic<00:03:18.110> not

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
boiled them at that time in caustic not

in contact with more of the yeast and

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.449 
in contact with more of the yeast and
finish<00:03:44.720> the<00:03:44.930> beer<00:03:45.200> so<00:03:45.680> that<00:03:45.830> was<00:03:45.980> number<00:03:46.160> two

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:50.269 
the Brewers at the time said what if our

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:52.479 
the Brewers at the time said what if our

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
is not as alive as it can be then what

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:57.009 
is not as alive as it can be then what
do<00:03:55.580> we<00:03:55.640> do<00:03:55.910> because<00:03:56.239> the<00:03:56.390> beach<00:03:56.570> wood<00:03:56.810> chips

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:57.019 
do we do because the beach wood chips

00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:59.170 
do we do because the beach wood chips

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.050 
we did this what if we brought over 75%

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:08.650 
we did this what if we brought over 75%
of<00:04:06.110> the<00:04:06.860> beer<00:04:07.190> of<00:04:07.220> the<00:04:07.400> tank<00:04:07.730> volumen<00:04:08.240> lagering

with the beach with chips on the bottom

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.550 
with the beach with chips on the bottom
bring<00:04:10.820> that<00:04:10.940> over<00:04:11.090> from<00:04:11.390> fermenting<00:04:11.870> and<00:04:12.050> then

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
bring that over from fermenting and then

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.190 
bring that over from fermenting and then
the<00:04:12.890> following<00:04:13.370> week<00:04:13.520> when<00:04:14.210> the<00:04:14.420> new<00:04:14.750> beer<00:04:15.080> is

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 
the following week when the new beer is

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.020 
the following week when the new beer is
just<00:04:15.230> starting<00:04:15.830> to<00:04:15.980> ferment<00:04:16.280> in<00:04:16.550> fermenting

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
just starting to ferment in fermenting

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:18.850 
just starting to ferment in fermenting
call<00:04:17.690> the<00:04:17.870> fermenting<00:04:18.290> cellar<00:04:18.530> and<00:04:18.709> say<00:04:18.830> I

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:18.860 
call the fermenting cellar and say I

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:20.530 
call the fermenting cellar and say I
need<00:04:18.980> some<00:04:19.430> some<00:04:19.850> beer<00:04:20.030> and<00:04:20.150> they<00:04:20.239> would<00:04:20.360> bring

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:20.540 
need some some beer and they would bring

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.870 
need some some beer and they would bring
over<00:04:20.720> freshly<00:04:21.500> yeasted<00:04:22.070> beer<00:04:22.370> that<00:04:22.520> was<00:04:22.640> just

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
over freshly yeasted beer that was just

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.640 
over freshly yeasted beer that was just
starting<00:04:23.180> to<00:04:23.270> ferment<00:04:23.570> and<00:04:23.810> they<00:04:24.260> would<00:04:24.410> top

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
starting to ferment and they would top

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.310 
starting to ferment and they would top
up<00:04:24.890> all<00:04:25.130> those<00:04:25.280> tanks<00:04:25.730> from<00:04:25.880> 75<00:04:26.510> to<00:04:26.720> 100<00:04:27.050> so<00:04:27.200> we

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
up all those tanks from 75 to 100 so we

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.770 
up all those tanks from 75 to 100 so we
added<00:04:27.440> fresh<00:04:27.890> yeast<00:04:28.190> a<00:04:28.640> little<00:04:29.390> bit<00:04:29.510> of<00:04:29.600> sugar

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
added fresh yeast a little bit of sugar

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.990 
added fresh yeast a little bit of sugar
they<00:04:30.530> closed<00:04:30.950> the<00:04:31.160> valves<00:04:31.520> on<00:04:31.640> the<00:04:31.760> tank

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
they closed the valves on the tank

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000 
they closed the valves on the tank
allowed<00:04:32.390> the<00:04:32.540> tank<00:04:32.780> to<00:04:32.930> pressurize<00:04:33.440> naturally

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
allowed the tank to pressurize naturally

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:39.460 
allowed the tank to pressurize naturally
carbonating<00:04:34.580> the<00:04:34.700> beer<00:04:37.300> then<00:04:38.300> we<00:04:38.750> pasteurized

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
carbonating the beer then we pasteurized

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.380 
carbonating the beer then we pasteurized
beer<00:04:39.740> for<00:04:39.950> the<00:04:40.010> first<00:04:40.280> time<00:04:40.520> in<00:04:40.670> this<00:04:40.730> country

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:41.390 
beer for the first time in this country

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:44.140 
beer for the first time in this country
Pasteur<00:04:42.260> had<00:04:42.500> just<00:04:42.740> done<00:04:42.890> his<00:04:43.040> work<00:04:43.310> so<00:04:43.940> now<00:04:44.090> we

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150 
Pasteur had just done his work so now we

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.650 
Pasteur had just done his work so now we
had<00:04:44.390> a<00:04:44.420> way<00:04:44.630> actually<00:04:45.010> stabilizing<00:04:46.010> the<00:04:46.100> beer

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:46.660 
had a way actually stabilizing the beer

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.060 
had a way actually stabilizing the beer
microorganism<00:04:47.660> wise<00:04:47.840> the<00:04:48.680> other<00:04:48.800> thing<00:04:49.010> we

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
microorganism wise the other thing we

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.280 
microorganism wise the other thing we
wanted<00:04:49.280> to<00:04:49.340> do<00:04:49.490> is<00:04:49.610> keep<00:04:49.760> the<00:04:49.940> beer<00:04:50.150> cold<00:04:50.390> so<00:04:51.140> we

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:51.290 
wanted to do is keep the beer cold so we

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:52.810 
wanted to do is keep the beer cold so we
built<00:04:51.500> ice<00:04:51.710> houses<00:04:52.190> along<00:04:52.430> the<00:04:52.490> railroad

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:52.820 
built ice houses along the railroad

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:54.940 
built ice houses along the railroad
lines<00:04:53.300> actually<00:04:54.020> built<00:04:54.680> our<00:04:54.890> own

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:54.950

refrigerated railroad car company to

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:59.620 
refrigerated railroad car company to
actually<00:04:57.890> take<00:04:58.190> the<00:04:58.400> beer<00:04:58.730> from<00:04:59.210> the<00:04:59.270> brewery

00:04:59.620 --> 00:04:59.630

revolutionary
and<00:07:19.690> I<00:07:20.020> think<00:07:20.289> that<00:07:20.469> story<00:07:20.889> along<00:07:21.759> with<00:07:21.880> the

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:22.000 
and I think that story along with the

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.670 
and I think that story along with the
fact<00:07:22.210> that<00:07:22.300> Budweiser<00:07:22.569> just<00:07:23.020> tastes<00:07:23.229> so<00:07:23.440> good

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:23.680 
fact that Budweiser just tastes so good

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:26.309 
fact that Budweiser just tastes so good
will<00:07:24.580> actually<00:07:25.029> drive<00:07:25.300> the<00:07:25.479> sales<00:07:25.690> forward<00:07:26.259> in
