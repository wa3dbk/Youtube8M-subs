00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
probably know last time I played it a

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.880 
probably know last time I played it a
bit<00:01:03.149> more<00:01:03.300> conservative<00:01:03.690> that's<00:01:04.559> because<00:01:04.799> I

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
bit more conservative that's because I

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.920 
bit more conservative that's because I
had<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.040> certain<00:01:05.280> goal<00:01:05.549> of<00:01:05.760> going<00:01:05.880> 949<00:01:06.630> and

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
hitting a 1,500 pound total which i did

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.050 
hitting a 1,500 pound total which i did
this<00:01:09.930> meat<00:01:10.229> I'd<00:01:10.590> like<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.189> set<00:01:11.369> some<00:01:11.549> PRS<00:01:11.970> and

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
this meat I'd like to set some PRS and

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.670 
this meat I'd like to set some PRS and
everything<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:12.570> really<00:01:12.780> push<00:01:12.990> my<00:01:13.200> total<00:01:13.530> as

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
everything and really push my total as

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.789 
everything and really push my total as
close<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.340> 1550<00:01:15.090> as<00:01:15.420> I<00:01:15.570> can<00:01:15.869> so<00:01:16.409> that<00:01:16.439> being<00:01:16.740> the

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
close to 1550 as I can so that being the

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.200 
close to 1550 as I can so that being the
case<00:01:17.009> I'm<00:01:17.250> going<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.640> have<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:17.759> be<00:01:17.970> a<00:01:18.000> lot<00:01:18.180> more

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
case I'm going to have to be a lot more

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.850 
case I'm going to have to be a lot more
aggressive<00:01:18.840> but<00:01:19.229> I'm<00:01:19.320> still<00:01:19.530> going<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.680> play

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
aggressive but I'm still going to play

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.800 
aggressive but I'm still going to play
it<00:01:19.890> smart<00:01:20.250> so<00:01:20.549> based<00:01:20.820> off<00:01:20.939> how<00:01:21.090> my<00:01:21.240> openers<00:01:21.630> go

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
it smart so based off how my openers go

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.719 
it smart so based off how my openers go
that'll<00:01:22.409> really<00:01:22.530> dictate<00:01:23.009> where<00:01:23.280> I<00:01:23.310> go<00:01:23.520> for<00:01:23.700> my

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
that'll really dictate where I go for my

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.190 
that'll really dictate where I go for my
second<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.330> third<00:01:24.390> attempt<00:01:24.990> I<00:01:25.080> have

second and third attempt I have

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.990 
second and third attempt I have
conservative<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:25.950> more<00:01:26.220> aggressive<00:01:26.310> numbers

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
conservative and more aggressive numbers

conservative and more aggressive numbers
for<00:01:27.600> bench<00:01:27.840> I'll<00:01:28.170> be<00:01:28.290> opening<00:01:28.619> at<00:01:28.799> 1<00:01:29.280> 45

out to five hundred eighty nine point

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.730 
out to five hundred eighty nine point
seven<00:01:48.240> pounds<00:01:48.780> so<00:01:48.869> let's<00:01:49.049> just<00:01:49.229> round<00:01:49.350> up<00:01:49.560> and

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
seven pounds so let's just round up and

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.969 
seven pounds so let's just round up and
say<00:01:49.890> 590<00:01:50.610> which<00:01:51.090> is<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.299> 15-pound<00:01:52.229> increase

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
say 590 which is a 15-pound increase

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.700 
say 590 which is a 15-pound increase
from<00:01:53.189> last<00:01:53.250> time<00:01:53.700> overall<00:01:54.689> my<00:01:54.720> total<00:01:55.470> just

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
from last time overall my total just

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.240 
from last time overall my total just
based<00:01:55.920> off<00:01:56.040> openers<00:01:56.520> would<00:01:56.790> be<00:01:57.979> 1427<00:01:58.979> and<00:01:59.219> a

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
based off openers would be 1427 and a

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.280 
based off openers would be 1427 and a
half<00:01:59.430> pounds<00:01:59.909> which<00:02:00.090> is<00:02:00.270> about<00:02:00.479> 43<00:02:01.110> pounds

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
half pounds which is about 43 pounds

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.380 
half pounds which is about 43 pounds
heavier<00:02:01.740> than<00:02:01.770> last<00:02:02.040> time<00:02:02.159> so<00:02:02.969> if<00:02:03.090> everything

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
heavier than last time so if everything

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.819 
heavier than last time so if everything
goes<00:02:03.540> right<00:02:03.689> and<00:02:04.020> I<00:02:04.110> make<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.409> same<00:02:04.560> kind<00:02:04.590> of

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
goes right and I make the same kind of

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.950 
goes right and I make the same kind of
jumps<00:02:05.159> as<00:02:05.280> I<00:02:05.340> did<00:02:05.729> my<00:02:05.880> last<00:02:06.060> meet<00:02:06.329> I<00:02:06.479> should<00:02:06.810> get

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
jumps as I did my last meet I should get

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.589 
jumps as I did my last meet I should get
close<00:02:07.229> to<00:02:07.380> that<00:02:07.409> 1550<00:02:08.369> total<00:02:08.729> but<00:02:08.879> we'll<00:02:09.390> find

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599
