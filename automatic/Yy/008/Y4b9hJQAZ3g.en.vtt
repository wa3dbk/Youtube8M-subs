00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
but as much as he's learned in just a

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.910 
but as much as he's learned in just a
few<00:02:54.970> years<00:02:55.209> Frank<00:02:55.959> decided<00:02:56.260> he<00:02:56.590> needed<00:02:56.770> a

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
few years Frank decided he needed a

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.910 
few years Frank decided he needed a
mentor<00:02:57.370> to<00:02:57.700> put<00:02:57.910> it<00:02:58.000> all<00:02:58.239> into<00:02:58.480> perspective

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
mentor to put it all into perspective

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.670 
mentor to put it all into perspective
his<00:02:59.920> passions<00:03:00.340> plants<00:03:00.910> and<00:03:01.209> he's<00:03:01.870> very<00:03:02.560> good

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
his passions plants and he's very good

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.380

at<00:03:03.040> bringing<00:03:03.400> in<00:03:03.550> different<00:03:03.700> plants<00:03:04.300> and

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
at bringing in different plants and

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.140 
at bringing in different plants and
adventurous<00:03:05.319> I<00:03:05.440> would<00:03:05.590> say<00:03:05.769> it<00:03:05.950> at<00:03:06.610> trying<00:03:06.970> new

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
adventurous I would say it at trying new

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.720 
adventurous I would say it at trying new
things<00:03:07.180> but<00:03:08.080> I<00:03:08.769> believe<00:03:09.040> he<00:03:09.190> needed<00:03:09.459> help<00:03:09.610> just

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
things but I believe he needed help just

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.059 
things but I believe he needed help just
in<00:03:10.090> and<00:03:10.390> bringing<00:03:10.750> it<00:03:10.840> all<00:03:10.900> together<00:03:11.140> so<00:03:11.680> that

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:12.069 
in and bringing it all together so that

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:15.600 
in and bringing it all together so that
his<00:03:12.970> yard<00:03:13.180> would<00:03:13.360> flow<00:03:14.190> that<00:03:15.190> there<00:03:15.430> would<00:03:15.580> be

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
his yard would flow that there would be

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:20.070 
his yard would flow that there would be
some<00:03:16.950> rhyme<00:03:17.950> and<00:03:18.100> reason<00:03:18.250> to<00:03:18.670> it<00:03:18.850> what<00:03:19.810> you<00:03:19.900> do

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
some rhyme and reason to it what you do

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.690 
some rhyme and reason to it what you do
is<00:03:20.260> you<00:03:20.380> just<00:03:20.410> extend<00:03:21.010> what<00:03:21.160> you<00:03:21.250> have<00:03:21.430> for

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
is you just extend what you have for

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.900 
is you just extend what you have for
example<00:03:21.790> he<00:03:22.209> had<00:03:22.420> a<00:03:22.720> small<00:03:23.290> patio<00:03:23.560> we<00:03:24.400> extended

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
example he had a small patio we extended

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.350 
example he had a small patio we extended
that<00:03:25.030> out<00:03:25.239> with<00:03:25.450> the<00:03:25.569> decomposed<00:03:25.989> granite<00:03:26.019> and

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
that out with the decomposed granite and

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.210 
that out with the decomposed granite and
extended<00:03:28.360> it<00:03:28.450> further<00:03:28.750> with<00:03:29.049> the<00:03:29.170> walkways<00:03:29.650> so

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
extended it further with the walkways so

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.250 
extended it further with the walkways so
it's<00:03:30.370> no<00:03:30.489> longer<00:03:30.519> choppy<00:03:31.090> you<00:03:31.390> have<00:03:31.569> this<00:03:31.780> this

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
it's no longer choppy you have this this

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.020 
it's no longer choppy you have this this
flow<00:03:32.500> coming<00:03:32.920> from<00:03:33.069> the<00:03:33.220> back<00:03:33.340> door<00:03:33.610> to<00:03:33.910> the
