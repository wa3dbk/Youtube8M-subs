00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
is related to the flash issue basically

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.109 
is related to the flash issue basically
they've<00:01:46.820> pulled<00:01:47.420> or<00:01:47.929> redone<00:01:48.710> these<00:01:48.979> sites<00:01:49.670> so

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
they've pulled or redone these sites so

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:52.480 
they've pulled or redone these sites so
they're<00:01:50.270> not<00:01:50.450> on<00:01:50.630> there<00:01:50.840> so<00:01:51.079> they<00:01:51.200> show<00:01:51.490> sighs

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.020 
they're not on there so they show sighs
for<00:01:52.939> example<00:01:53.710> they<00:01:54.710> were<00:01:54.770> showing<00:01:55.490> things

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
for example they were showing things

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.510 
for example they were showing things
like<00:01:56.450> the<00:01:56.750> New<00:01:56.929> York<00:01:57.200> Times<00:01:57.380> and<00:01:58.009> other<00:01:58.100> sites

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
like the New York Times and other sites

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.749 
like the New York Times and other sites
with<00:01:59.390> the<00:01:59.569> content<00:02:00.200> there<00:02:00.590> as<00:02:00.979> opposed<00:02:01.520> to

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 
with the content there as opposed to

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:04.029 
with the content there as opposed to
what<00:02:01.789> they<00:02:02.119> would<00:02:02.299> actually<00:02:03.110> look<00:02:03.409> like<00:02:03.469> on

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:04.039 
what they would actually look like on

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:12.480 
what they would actually look like on
the<00:02:04.219> device

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.200 

like<00:02:30.890> this<00:02:31.070> is<00:02:31.280> what<00:02:31.460> they're<00:02:31.640> showing<00:02:31.670> them

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.210 
like this is what they're showing them

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:34.810 
like this is what they're showing them
like<00:02:32.390> in<00:02:32.570> the<00:02:32.660> ads<00:02:33.070> over<00:02:34.070> here<00:02:34.340> is<00:02:34.490> what<00:02:34.700> the

like in the ads over here is what the

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.150 
like in the ads over here is what the
site's<00:02:35.090> actually<00:02:35.630> looked<00:02:35.870> like<00:02:36.110> and<00:02:36.380> as

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
site's actually looked like and as

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.980
