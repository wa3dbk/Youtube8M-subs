plank but this one I managed to cut it
fairly<00:01:03.220> round<00:01:03.400> and<00:01:03.730> it<00:01:03.820> was<00:01:03.970> fairly<00:01:04.210> easy<00:01:04.360> to

00:01:04.679 --> 00:01:04.689 
fairly round and it was fairly easy to

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:09.030 
fairly round and it was fairly easy to
do<00:01:05.110> it<00:01:06.390> making<00:01:07.390> sure<00:01:07.570> I<00:01:07.600> use<00:01:07.930> a<00:01:07.960> bowl<00:01:08.409> gouge<00:01:08.650> and

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
do it making sure I use a bowl gouge and

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.640 
do it making sure I use a bowl gouge and
not<00:01:09.189> a<00:01:09.220> spindle<00:01:09.700> gouge<00:01:09.810> always<00:01:10.810> for<00:01:11.290> this<00:01:11.409> sort

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:11.650 
not a spindle gouge always for this sort

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:19.060 
not a spindle gouge always for this sort
of<00:01:11.680> work<00:01:11.920> use<00:01:12.490> a<00:01:12.700> walkout

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.420 

just<00:01:19.550> a<00:01:19.790> little<00:01:20.090> bit<00:01:20.360> more<00:01:20.570> to<00:01:20.840> true<00:01:21.560> it<00:01:21.680> up<00:01:21.800> and

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
just a little bit more to true it up and

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.820 
just a little bit more to true it up and
then<00:01:23.150> start<00:01:23.420> shaping<00:01:23.930> the<00:01:23.960> outside<00:01:24.650> of<00:01:24.770> the

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
then start shaping the outside of the

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:30.490 
then start shaping the outside of the
room<00:01:26.920> wanted<00:01:27.920> to<00:01:28.040> maximize<00:01:28.670> what<00:01:29.030> I<00:01:29.290> got<00:01:30.290> out

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
room wanted to maximize what I got out

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.670 
room wanted to maximize what I got out
of<00:01:30.560> this<00:01:30.860> piece<00:01:31.160> of<00:01:31.190> wood<00:01:32.380> three<00:01:33.380> inches<00:01:33.619> thick

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
of this piece of wood three inches thick

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.100 
of this piece of wood three inches thick
could<00:01:34.369> not<00:01:34.550> make<00:01:34.760> it<00:01:34.880> any<00:01:35.000> thicker<00:01:35.360> so<00:01:36.080> I

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
could not make it any thicker so I

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.499 
could not make it any thicker so I
wanted<00:01:36.530> to<00:01:36.590> preserve<00:01:37.119> every<00:01:38.119> bit<00:01:38.360> of<00:01:38.390> that

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
wanted to preserve every bit of that

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:44.370 
wanted to preserve every bit of that
thickness<00:01:39.080> that<00:01:39.290> I<00:01:39.350> could<00:01:39.710> for<00:01:40.640> the<00:01:40.910> bowl<00:01:41.270> that

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.880 

I<00:01:45.550> wanted<00:01:46.550> to<00:01:46.610> get<00:01:46.820> a<00:01:47.330> nice<00:01:47.869> place<00:01:48.530> to<00:01:48.560> shape

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
I wanted to get a nice place to shape

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:54.160 
I wanted to get a nice place to shape
out<00:01:49.100> but<00:01:49.340> also<00:01:52.300> might<00:01:53.300> be<00:01:53.450> outside<00:01:53.600> just<00:01:54.050> a

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
out but also might be outside just a

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.440 
out but also might be outside just a
little<00:01:54.410> bit<00:01:54.530> more<00:01:54.710> at<00:01:54.830> this<00:01:54.950> point<00:01:55.210> all<00:01:56.210> this

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
little bit more at this point all this

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.600 
little bit more at this point all this
with<00:01:56.660> the<00:01:56.780> bowl<00:01:57.500> gouge<00:01:59.380> change<00:02:00.380> the<00:02:01.039> cuts<00:02:01.430> a

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
with the bowl gouge change the cuts a

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.050 
with the bowl gouge change the cuts a
couple<00:02:01.640> of<00:02:01.970> times<00:02:02.240> and<00:02:02.710> at<00:02:03.710> the<00:02:03.860> end<00:02:04.009> I<00:02:04.280> will<00:02:04.340> do

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
couple of times and at the end I will do

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.660 
couple of times and at the end I will do
some<00:02:05.300> shear<00:02:05.539> scraping<00:02:05.860> but<00:02:06.860> with<00:02:07.039> the<00:02:07.190> change

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
some shear scraping but with the change

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.820 
some shear scraping but with the change
up<00:02:07.910> between<00:02:08.360> the<00:02:08.630> heartwood<00:02:09.080> and<00:02:09.350> the<00:02:09.590> SAP

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
up between the heartwood and the SAP

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.570 
up between the heartwood and the SAP
wood<00:02:10.130> on<00:02:10.489> this<00:02:11.030> walnut<00:02:11.620> it<00:02:12.620> was<00:02:12.800> very<00:02:13.400> very

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
wood on this walnut it was very very

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:19.839 
wood on this walnut it was very very
hard<00:02:13.910> to<00:02:14.030> get<00:02:14.180> ace<00:02:14.360> and<00:02:14.870> smooth<00:02:15.320> cut

safe<00:02:20.569> dudes<00:02:21.109> I'm<00:02:21.260> sure<00:02:21.439> screaming<00:02:21.859> in<00:02:22.310> order

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
safe dudes I'm sure screaming in order

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:24.009 
safe dudes I'm sure screaming in order
to<00:02:22.609> maximize<00:02:23.090> the<00:02:23.239> depth<00:02:23.480> that<00:02:23.569> he<00:02:23.780> said<00:02:23.989> about

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:24.019 
to maximize the depth that he said about

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:28.720 
to maximize the depth that he said about
to<00:02:24.939> turn<00:02:25.939> it<00:02:26.120> tenon<00:02:26.780> on<00:02:26.959> the<00:02:27.109> bulb<00:02:27.530> itself<00:02:27.920> so<00:02:28.700> I

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
to turn it tenon on the bulb itself so I

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.629 
to turn it tenon on the bulb itself so I
glued<00:02:29.090> on<00:02:29.269> another<00:02:29.629> waste<00:02:30.200> block<00:02:30.499> so<00:02:31.430> that<00:02:31.549> I

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:31.639 
glued on another waste block so that I

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:34.030 
glued on another waste block so that I
could<00:02:31.819> maximize<00:02:32.329> the<00:02:32.749> actual<00:02:33.439> walnut<00:02:33.829> piece

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
could maximize the actual walnut piece

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.789 
could maximize the actual walnut piece
while<00:02:34.790> ice<00:02:34.939> added<00:02:35.269> I<00:02:35.389> treated<00:02:35.719> a<00:02:35.930> check<00:02:36.590> and

little<00:02:38.959> CA<00:02:39.170> to<00:02:39.609> stabilize<00:02:40.609> it<00:02:40.959> then<00:02:41.959> once<00:02:42.349> that

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
little CA to stabilize it then once that

dried<00:02:43.099> which<00:02:43.579> was<00:02:43.819> overnight<00:02:44.359> I<00:02:44.900> went<00:02:45.709> back

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
dried which was overnight I went back

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.780 
dried which was overnight I went back
and<00:02:46.790> trimmed<00:02:47.659> up<00:02:47.840> the<00:02:48.500> outside<00:02:49.010> just<00:02:49.219> a<00:02:49.370> little

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
and trimmed up the outside just a little

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.690 
and trimmed up the outside just a little
bit<00:02:49.939> more<00:02:50.150> to<00:02:50.989> get<00:02:51.139> the<00:02:51.379> shape<00:02:51.980> of<00:02:52.010> the<00:02:52.459> bowl

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
bit more to get the shape of the bowl

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:53.619 
bit more to get the shape of the bowl
that<00:02:52.730> I<00:02:53.090> was<00:02:53.239> after

00:02:53.619 --> 00:02:53.629 
that I was after

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:56.289 
that I was after
I'm<00:02:54.290> sure<00:02:54.530> scraping<00:02:54.980> so<00:02:55.250> time<00:02:55.819> to<00:02:55.969> flip<00:02:56.150> it

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:56.299 
I'm sure scraping so time to flip it

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:01.890 
I'm sure scraping so time to flip it
over<00:02:56.419> and<00:02:56.949> go<00:02:57.949> for<00:02:58.129> the<00:02:58.219> inside<00:02:59.829> using<00:03:00.829> my

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
over and go for the inside using my

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:07.010 
over and go for the inside using my
largest<00:03:02.900> bowl<00:03:03.169> gouge

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:11.920 

this<00:03:07.590> wood<00:03:07.920> was<00:03:08.100> actually<00:03:08.550> very<00:03:08.850> nice<00:03:09.210> to<00:03:09.630> turn

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
this wood was actually very nice to turn

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.750 
this wood was actually very nice to turn
gently<00:03:12.930> I'm<00:03:13.230> turning<00:03:13.620> Greenwood<00:03:14.160> and<00:03:14.370> you<00:03:14.490> see

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
gently I'm turning Greenwood and you see

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.940 
gently I'm turning Greenwood and you see
it<00:03:14.880> coming<00:03:15.420> off<00:03:15.540> very<00:03:15.780> easily<00:03:15.930> I<00:03:16.140> expected

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
it coming off very easily I expected

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.190 
it coming off very easily I expected
this<00:03:17.100> to<00:03:17.160> be<00:03:17.430> much<00:03:17.700> much<00:03:18.000> harder<00:03:18.210> and<00:03:18.510> indeed

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
this to be much much harder and indeed

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.910 
this to be much much harder and indeed
did<00:03:19.380> this<00:03:19.560> hard<00:03:19.830> but<00:03:20.040> I<00:03:20.100> did<00:03:20.340> make<00:03:20.490> sure<00:03:20.550> that<00:03:21.060> I

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
did this hard but I did make sure that I

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.950 
did this hard but I did make sure that I
had<00:03:22.920> sharpened<00:03:23.430> my<00:03:23.670> tools<00:03:23.970> and<00:03:25.010> behind<00:03:26.010> the

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:26.960 
had sharpened my tools and behind the

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.410 
had sharpened my tools and behind the
cuts<00:03:27.960> and<00:03:28.290> the<00:03:28.350> holding<00:03:29.190> process<00:03:29.700> and<00:03:30.000> to<00:03:30.150> keep

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
cuts and the holding process and to keep

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.920 
cuts and the holding process and to keep
my<00:03:30.630> weight<00:03:30.840> balanced<00:03:31.440> and<00:03:31.650> everything<00:03:32.930> that

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
my weight balanced and everything that

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.290 
my weight balanced and everything that
I've<00:03:34.080> learned<00:03:34.110> in<00:03:34.920> order<00:03:35.400> to<00:03:35.520> achieve<00:03:36.090> that

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
I've learned in order to achieve that

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.530 
I've learned in order to achieve that
proper<00:03:36.750> stance<00:03:37.050> and<00:03:37.820> I<00:03:38.820> think<00:03:39.060> it's<00:03:39.210> starting

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
proper stance and I think it's starting

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:45.100 
proper stance and I think it's starting
to<00:03:39.660> pay<00:03:39.810> off

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.160 

so<00:03:46.110> this<00:03:46.320> this<00:03:46.650> one<00:03:46.920> very<00:03:47.310> nicely<00:03:47.610> and<00:03:47.940> very

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
so this this one very nicely and very

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.740 
so this this one very nicely and very
well<00:03:49.170> did<00:03:49.920> stop<00:03:50.220> quite<00:03:50.580> often<00:03:50.790> to<00:03:51.150> check<00:03:51.450> to

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
well did stop quite often to check to

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.550 
well did stop quite often to check to
the<00:03:52.200> wall<00:03:52.830> thickness<00:03:53.600> didn't<00:03:54.600> one<00:03:54.750> to<00:03:55.230> thin

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
the wall thickness didn't one to thin

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.630 
the wall thickness didn't one to thin
didn't<00:03:56.070> want<00:03:56.250> to<00:03:56.490> thick<00:03:57.320> one<00:03:58.320> up<00:03:58.590> just<00:03:58.620> may<00:03:59.610> be

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
didn't want to thick one up just may be

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.180 
didn't want to thick one up just may be
a<00:03:59.760> decision<00:04:00.540> over<00:04:00.690> half<00:04:01.080> inch<00:04:01.290> thick<00:04:01.590> to<00:04:01.860> me<00:04:02.070> it

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
a decision over half inch thick to me it

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.150 
a decision over half inch thick to me it
was<00:04:02.310> a<00:04:02.340> very<00:04:02.490> good<00:04:02.880> weight<00:04:03.180> and<00:04:03.450> heft<00:04:03.690> I<00:04:04.290> know

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
was a very good weight and heft I know

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.130 
was a very good weight and heft I know
some<00:04:05.580> people<00:04:05.910> would<00:04:06.030> want<00:04:06.060> to<00:04:06.360> go<00:04:06.510> for<00:04:06.840> and

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
some people would want to go for and

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.410 
some people would want to go for and
hate<00:04:07.320> the<00:04:07.470> niche<00:04:07.740> but<00:04:08.580> this<00:04:09.060> isn't<00:04:09.240> as

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
hate the niche but this isn't as

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.590 
hate the niche but this isn't as
potentially<00:04:10.020> a<00:04:10.410> utility<00:04:11.160> bull<00:04:11.340> also<00:04:11.790> didn't

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
potentially a utility bull also didn't

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.000 
potentially a utility bull also didn't
want<00:04:12.780> to<00:04:13.200> thin

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
want to thin

want to thin
to<00:04:14.189> me<00:04:14.340> this<00:04:14.519> was<00:04:14.790> just<00:04:15.599> about<00:04:15.720> the<00:04:16.019> right<00:04:16.290> take

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
to me this was just about the right take

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.729 
to me this was just about the right take
the<00:04:17.040> center<00:04:17.370> the<00:04:17.850> right<00:04:18.060> feel<00:04:18.359> to<00:04:18.600> it<00:04:18.780> this

the center the right feel to it this

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:21.620 
the center the right feel to it this
point<00:04:20.010> just<00:04:20.220> looking<00:04:20.699> for<00:04:20.880> the<00:04:20.970> last<00:04:21.120> little

center of the bowl get that out and down
and<00:04:27.990> with<00:04:28.289> the<00:04:28.440> difference<00:04:28.889> in<00:04:29.070> the<00:04:29.250> cut<00:04:29.699> and

and with the difference in the cut and

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:31.670 
and with the difference in the cut and
decided<00:04:30.630> to<00:04:30.720> go<00:04:30.870> ahead<00:04:30.960> and<00:04:31.199> use<00:04:31.320> the<00:04:31.470> heavy

Bowl<00:04:31.979> scraper

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.129 

again<00:04:35.460> just<00:04:35.699> cutting<00:04:36.090> with<00:04:36.240> the<00:04:36.419> little<00:04:36.990> bit

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:37.139 
again just cutting with the little bit

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:38.960 
again just cutting with the little bit
of<00:04:37.199> a<00:04:37.410> burr<00:04:37.620> out<00:04:37.919> there<00:04:38.130> on<00:04:38.280> the<00:04:38.430> edge<00:04:38.550> of<00:04:38.759> that

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
of a burr out there on the edge of that

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:41.779 
of a burr out there on the edge of that
scraper<00:04:39.570> and<00:04:40.020> it's<00:04:40.650> heavy<00:04:40.860> enough<00:04:40.979> to<00:04:41.160> reach<00:04:41.490> a

00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:41.789 
scraper and it's heavy enough to reach a

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:45.879 
scraper and it's heavy enough to reach a
long<00:04:42.300> way<00:04:42.570> over<00:04:42.600> the<00:04:43.340> the<00:04:44.340> tool<00:04:44.759> rest<00:04:45.060> and

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:45.889 
long way over the the tool rest and

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:48.650 
long way over the the tool rest and
actually<00:04:46.889> cut<00:04:47.190> very<00:04:47.490> nicely<00:04:47.880> on<00:04:48.240> this<00:04:48.389> walnut

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660 
actually cut very nicely on this walnut

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:54.290 
actually cut very nicely on this walnut
and<00:04:49.560> it<00:04:49.770> did<00:04:49.949> make<00:04:50.130> a<00:04:50.310> very<00:04:50.490> nice<00:04:52.160> finish<00:04:53.300> just

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
and it did make a very nice finish just

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.730 
and it did make a very nice finish just
needed<00:04:54.720> just<00:04:54.930> a<00:04:55.080> little<00:04:55.590> bit<00:04:55.740> more<00:04:55.889> sanding<00:04:56.400> to

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740 
needed just a little bit more sanding to

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.040 
needed just a little bit more sanding to
finish<00:04:58.740> it<00:04:58.860> up<00:04:59.330> there's<00:05:00.330> the<00:05:00.419> last<00:05:00.599> little<00:05:00.870> bit

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050 
finish it up there's the last little bit

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.800 
finish it up there's the last little bit
I<00:05:01.199> started<00:05:01.620> sand<00:05:02.009> it<00:05:02.160> here<00:05:03.090> with<00:05:03.240> the<00:05:03.360> 80<00:05:03.539> grit

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
I started sand it here with the 80 grit

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
down on that desk so step back coated it

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:13.999 
down on that desk so step back coated it
with<00:05:12.060> my<00:05:12.449> mineral<00:05:12.990> oil<00:05:13.410> and<00:05:13.440> wax<00:05:13.770> mixture

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:18.889 
getting 75% mineral oil 25% beeswax and

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:21.800 
getting 75% mineral oil 25% beeswax and
that<00:05:19.889> significantly<00:05:20.639> cut<00:05:20.910> down<00:05:20.940> the<00:05:21.479> amount

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
that significantly cut down the amount
