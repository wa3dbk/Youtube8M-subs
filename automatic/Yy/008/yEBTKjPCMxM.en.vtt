00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.530
 sit back in the wild west 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.000
 as jack rock picks you have one 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.550
 invaded bank and now you have to 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.310
 flee and happen to be about credit 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:22.040
 and his band of law-abiding 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.570
 either escapes to the three o'clock 15 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.320
 express or about the Mexican 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.519
 border 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:32.989
 that's up to you 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:35.809
 so then I draw two cards and 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:38.210
 play a bounty hunter and aim one 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:39.790
 Another map view is quite good at 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.940
 me then you still managed to head 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:45.409
 and you have another card and because 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.879
 I do not limit but still plays 

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:47.420
 the head and pull one more 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:49.460
 map 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.550
 so to do that and now they are 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:55.610
 say I attack and shoot 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.199
 paint shooting before leaving so close 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.330
 not then must federal go only 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:00.680
 poor dog yes where is you know here 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:03.530
 go out so well that you if the soul 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:08.439
 hurts you are too, then I see two too 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.439
 cards and it continues on the bass and 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:19.100
 I play the 45 years she comes here 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.509
 the special layers are not and on 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.670
 I still I play the 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:24.650
 Midnight Mum discard a card 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.350
 and allowed for the Mexican border 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.730
 a little bit of freedom you get it now 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.770
 hang slowly 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:34.120
 in the two-player game revolver with one 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.860
 the role played by both players 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.110
 culcay the other gets into the role 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.950
 from matt mcgrath 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.690
 every player gets his 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:44.100
 get a stack of cards and jack gets 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:46.420
 support of 16 bandits the lines 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.190
 Here you can see the game setup 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.810
 The bandit's view is down here 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.900
 the 16 band members and here is the 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.370
 own stack if the band is ideal 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.740
 crazy as the very first of these rounds 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.780
 Brand a field forward on the list 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.700
 which we have in the middle and there 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.930
 you can see the progress from 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.190
 Jack caught in his band 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.840
 driving here is the bank she is 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.440
 rob and return in the course of the game 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.460
 this brand always close to the 315 express 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.180
 then jack want gold 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:14.590
 for when he has achieved he has won 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.000
 the other way we can win 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:20.920
 if he is over the mexican border 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:23.290
 doors artist for free net with rallye 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.340
 wins if he has all 16 bandits 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.030
 those down here are beyond 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.830
 has sent as I said at the beginning of the 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.700
 bandits zuges moved the marker 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.650
 second forward 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.390
 after that pulls the two cards from his 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.310
 stack and may play as many as 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.450
 he wants 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.070
 some cards have in the upper corner 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.510
 a poker table 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:43.780
 then you want a current one 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.330
 venue all others have created 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.340
 any special ability 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.810
 for example with this one can do that 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.650
 Speed ​​up game and not brand 1 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.570
 put forward 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.600
 This would reduce sheriff's time 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:57.720
 to tap into a lover 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.890
 then there is this symbol here 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.269
 that means the cashier has one 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.590
 has special ability and I still 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:04.600
 have to pay anything to play the 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.250
 if I like it for example two here 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.690
 blocks from the mexican border 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.150
 I want an extra 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.380
 discard card 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.300
 the train of the maitre of the player is running 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.890
 very similar from now moves the marker 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.800
 not next but instead has on 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.720
 the end of his bout was a fight in 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.160
 this fight phase will be the white 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.080
 smallpox jepsen the black poker chips 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.310
 compared to how you simply added and 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.920
 the two values ​​become one with each other 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.080
 compared as I said choose the evil 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.580
 page wins check conti then 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.430
 further the possibility of a block of 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.270
 to clear the border but only if the 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.800
 boss 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.980
 a train has shot a bandit 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.420
 for example, such a card is on the 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.450
 nothing else stands but kill you 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:45.790
 bandits an uncompromising games 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:48.270
 make the best if he has killed no 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:51.130
 comes as I said adwords conveyor 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:52.750
 win the good ones then one of must 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:55.810
 six mandates go over the wupper 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.370
 so to speak, and this one may be a 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.050
 choose the lowest number 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.720
 At the moment , for example, there would be 502 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:02.710
 selection dimitri honor cards have no 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.660
 special skills 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:07.240
 the higher the value the more unpleasant 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.730
 side effect, there are again blocks 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:11.050
 on the border one may have certain cards 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.150
 play more milk and so on and so on 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.380
 on 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.940
 according to this scheme f now also the rest 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.680
 From the game you play through the game 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.820
 whole scenes so long until one 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.590
 the player sees his conditions 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.150
 has fulfilled and wins 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.160
 a round revolver feels 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.430
 indeed after a furious 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.350
 chase on 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.120
 although the game has balanced 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.560
 you permanently disadvantaged the feeling 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.660
 to draw his wrong cards 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.680
 that and the short playing time of one 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.680
 revanche out formally
