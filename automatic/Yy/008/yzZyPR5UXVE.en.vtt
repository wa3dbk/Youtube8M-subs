I don't advocate at all it's the

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.670 
I don't advocate at all it's the

you'll hear about an interlocking grip

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.430 
you'll hear about an interlocking grip
the<00:00:57.149> reason<00:00:57.449> why<00:00:57.570> Jack<00:00:57.899> Nicklaus<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:58.350> Tiger

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
the reason why Jack Nicklaus and Tiger

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.139 
the reason why Jack Nicklaus and Tiger
Woods<00:00:58.829> use<00:00:59.070> it<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.489> only<00:00:59.699> difference<00:01:00.000> between

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
Woods use it the only difference between

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.549 
Woods use it the only difference between
the<00:01:00.510> Varden<00:01:00.809> grip<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.170> interlocking

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
the Varden grip and the interlocking

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.820 
the Varden grip and the interlocking
grip<00:01:01.680> is<00:01:01.920> these<00:01:02.370> two<00:01:02.579> fingers<00:01:02.969> now<00:01:03.149> interlock

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:03.830 
grip is these two fingers now interlock

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.080 
grip is these two fingers now interlock
so<00:01:04.830> irrespective<00:01:05.250> whether<00:01:05.460> you<00:01:05.700> use<00:01:05.880> the

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
so irrespective whether you use the

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.460 
so irrespective whether you use the
interlocking<00:01:06.630> grip<00:01:06.750> or<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.110> Varden<00:01:07.439> grip

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
interlocking grip or the Varden grip

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.530 
interlocking grip or the Varden grip
this<00:01:08.040> should<00:01:08.250> not<00:01:08.460> be<00:01:08.520> pressure<00:01:09.030> in<00:01:09.330> the

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
this should not be pressure in the

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.510 
this should not be pressure in the
middle<00:01:09.810> of<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.170> grip<00:01:10.380> if<00:01:10.590> you've<00:01:11.070> got<00:01:11.189> smaller

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
middle of the grip if you've got smaller

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.920 
middle of the grip if you've got smaller
hands<00:01:11.970> you<00:01:12.299> might<00:01:12.479> want<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.689> try<00:01:12.810> the

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
hands you might want to try the

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.200 
hands you might want to try the
interlocking<00:01:13.409> grip<00:01:13.530> bigger<00:01:14.040> hands<00:01:14.460> then<00:01:15.060> the

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
interlocking grip bigger hands then the

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.600 
interlocking grip bigger hands then the
Varden<00:01:15.570> grip<00:01:15.710> okay<00:01:16.710> now<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:16.979> reason<00:01:17.070> why<00:01:17.549> the

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
Varden grip okay now the reason why the

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.030 
Varden grip okay now the reason why the
grip<00:01:17.880> is<00:01:18.000> so<00:01:18.180> important<00:01:18.720> is<00:01:18.840> it<00:01:19.500> puts<00:01:19.860> the

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
grip is so important is it puts the

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.740 
grip is so important is it puts the
hands<00:01:20.460> in<00:01:20.580> a<00:01:20.670> position<00:01:20.939> where<00:01:21.570> they<00:01:21.689> can

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
hands in a position where they can

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.899 
hands in a position where they can
control<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.650> club<00:01:22.860> through<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.549> basis<00:01:23.880> of

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
control the club through the basis of

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.880 
control the club through the basis of
the<00:01:24.060> swing<00:01:24.330> now<00:01:24.930> a<00:01:24.960> strong<00:01:25.350> grip<00:01:25.530> is<00:01:25.680> going<00:01:25.830> to

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
the swing now a strong grip is going to

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.410 
the swing now a strong grip is going to
have<00:01:26.009> a<00:01:26.040> different<00:01:26.430> effect<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:26.939> weak<00:01:27.210> grip

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
have a different effect to a weak grip

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.780 
have a different effect to a weak grip
for<00:01:27.630> example<00:01:28.020> David<00:01:28.470> Duvall<00:01:28.920> he<00:01:29.310> was<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.490> strong

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
for example David Duvall he was a strong

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.700 
for example David Duvall he was a strong
gripper<00:01:30.210> his<00:01:30.540> game<00:01:30.810> is<00:01:31.020> built<00:01:31.259> around<00:01:31.500> his

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
gripper his game is built around his

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.069 
gripper his game is built around his
strong<00:01:31.979> grip<00:01:32.220> not<00:01:32.850> necessarily<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.750> best<00:01:33.869> for

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.830 
of town I can see all four knuckles now
if<00:01:44.520> I<00:01:44.610> was<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:44.880> mirror<00:01:45.090> that<00:01:45.149> with<00:01:45.420> my<00:01:45.570> right

if I was to mirror that with my right
hand<00:01:46.280> it<00:01:47.280> would<00:01:47.399> be<00:01:47.520> in<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.670> same<00:01:47.850> position

hand it would be in the same position

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.120

would point underneath my right shoulder

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.429 
would point underneath my right shoulder

I place my left hand in on the grip in
virtually<00:02:35.530> what<00:02:35.680> would<00:02:35.799> be<00:02:35.890> a<00:02:35.920> shake<00:02:36.220> hands

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
virtually what would be a shake hands

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:37.920 
virtually what would be a shake hands
position<00:02:36.970> if<00:02:37.060> I<00:02:37.150> stir<00:02:37.329> shake<00:02:37.510> hands<00:02:37.720> with<00:02:37.840> you

with<00:02:38.049> my<00:02:38.140> left<00:02:38.349> hand<00:02:38.560> it<00:02:38.950> would<00:02:39.069> look<00:02:39.190> like

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
with my left hand it would look like

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.660 
with my left hand it would look like
that

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
that

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
and at a very neutral left hand wants to

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.470 
and at a very neutral left hand wants to
shake<00:02:44.739> hands<00:02:44.950> with<00:02:45.099> my<00:02:45.280> right<00:02:45.519> hand<00:02:45.549> and<00:02:45.970> then

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
shake hands with my right hand and then

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.509 
shake hands with my right hand and then
simply<00:02:46.930> put<00:02:47.079> it<00:02:47.170> on<00:02:47.260> the<00:02:47.349> glove<00:02:47.530> I<00:02:47.739> now<00:02:48.280> have

00:02:59.339 --> 00:02:59.349 
left hand okay now that is a neutral

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:01.440 
left hand okay now that is a neutral
grip<00:02:59.530> now<00:03:00.220> I<00:03:00.250> can<00:03:00.639> advocate<00:03:01.000> you<00:03:01.120> can<00:03:01.209> go<00:03:01.269> maybe

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
grip now I can advocate you can go maybe

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.899 
grip now I can advocate you can go maybe
half<00:03:01.780> a<00:03:01.930> knuckle<00:03:02.230> more<00:03:02.440> or<00:03:02.680> a<00:03:02.739> fraction<00:03:03.549> weaker

00:03:03.899 --> 00:03:03.909 
half a knuckle more or a fraction weaker

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:05.610 
half a knuckle more or a fraction weaker
but<00:03:04.209> basically<00:03:04.780> stay<00:03:05.049> within<00:03:05.319> those

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
but basically stay within those

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.680 
but basically stay within those
boundaries<00:03:06.099> now<00:03:06.940> it's<00:03:07.060> fine<00:03:07.239> to<00:03:07.359> have<00:03:07.420> a<00:03:07.510> good

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
boundaries now it's fine to have a good

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.599 
boundaries now it's fine to have a good
grip<00:03:07.930> that<00:03:08.139> looks<00:03:08.349> good<00:03:08.590> but<00:03:08.799> if<00:03:09.190> it<00:03:09.280> doesn't

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:09.609 
grip that looks good but if it doesn't

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:11.220 
grip that looks good but if it doesn't
match<00:03:09.760> up<00:03:09.790> to<00:03:10.030> the<00:03:10.209> club<00:03:10.389> face<00:03:10.659> you're<00:03:11.200> in

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
match up to the club face you're in

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.500 
match up to the club face you're in
trouble<00:03:11.560> so<00:03:12.340> I<00:03:12.370> advocate<00:03:12.579> putting<00:03:13.090> the<00:03:13.299> grip

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
trouble so I advocate putting the grip

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.059 
trouble so I advocate putting the grip
down<00:03:13.659> very<00:03:13.989> very<00:03:14.049> Square<00:03:14.470> to<00:03:14.560> the<00:03:14.620> ground<00:03:14.889> when

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
down very very Square to the ground when

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:16.649 
down very very Square to the ground when
you're<00:03:15.159> practicing<00:03:15.760> with<00:03:15.879> your<00:03:16.209> grip<00:03:16.389> at<00:03:16.510> home

00:03:16.649 --> 00:03:16.659 
you're practicing with your grip at home

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:18.569 
you're practicing with your grip at home
because<00:03:17.290> the<00:03:17.440> tendency<00:03:17.889> when<00:03:18.010> you<00:03:18.129> strengthen

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:18.579 
because the tendency when you strengthen

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:20.520 
because the tendency when you strengthen
is<00:03:18.699> a<00:03:18.849> lot<00:03:19.030> of<00:03:19.120> people<00:03:19.389> start<00:03:19.660> to<00:03:19.900> rotate<00:03:20.410> the

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
is a lot of people start to rotate the

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.409 
is a lot of people start to rotate the
club<00:03:20.739> as<00:03:20.919> they<00:03:21.400> strengthen<00:03:21.879> their<00:03:22.000> grip<00:03:22.209> they

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:22.419 
club as they strengthen their grip they

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:23.939 
club as they strengthen their grip they
also<00:03:22.599> close<00:03:23.019> the<00:03:23.049> club<00:03:23.379> face<00:03:23.440> because<00:03:23.829> it

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:23.949 
also close the club face because it

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:26.580 
also close the club face because it
feels<00:03:24.160> better<00:03:24.430> for<00:03:24.549> them<00:03:24.790> two<00:03:25.690> wrongs<00:03:25.989> don't

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
feels better for them two wrongs don't

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:27.119 
feels better for them two wrongs don't
make<00:03:26.650> a<00:03:26.769> right

00:03:27.119 --> 00:03:27.129 
make a right

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:29.610 
make a right
so<00:03:27.819> a<00:03:28.030> neutral<00:03:28.569> grip<00:03:28.780> you<00:03:29.109> think<00:03:29.319> that's<00:03:29.500> all

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
so a neutral grip you think that's all

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.439 
so a neutral grip you think that's all
there<00:03:29.680> is<00:03:29.829> to<00:03:30.099> it<00:03:30.190> when<00:03:30.790> all<00:03:30.970> the<00:03:31.090> years<00:03:31.269> of

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:31.449 
there is to it when all the years of

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:32.970 
there is to it when all the years of
playing<00:03:31.660> and<00:03:31.989> playing<00:03:32.169> in<00:03:32.349> pro<00:03:32.530> Am's<00:03:32.769> and

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
playing and playing in pro Am's and

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.890 
playing and playing in pro Am's and
competing<00:03:33.430> i've<00:03:33.549> never<00:03:34.060> ever<00:03:34.329> played<00:03:34.690> with<00:03:34.840> a

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
competing i've never ever played with a

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.449 
competing i've never ever played with a
play<00:03:35.139> that<00:03:35.349> gripped<00:03:35.620> the<00:03:35.709> club<00:03:35.919> too<00:03:36.190> lightly

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
play that gripped the club too lightly

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:39.240 
play that gripped the club too lightly
so<00:03:37.239> the<00:03:37.359> tendency<00:03:37.629> is<00:03:38.019> to<00:03:38.440> grip<00:03:38.650> it<00:03:38.769> too<00:03:38.980> tight

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
so the tendency is to grip it too tight

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:40.890 
so the tendency is to grip it too tight
and<00:03:39.400> squeeze<00:03:39.579> the<00:03:40.060> living<00:03:40.359> heck<00:03:40.540> out<00:03:40.720> of<00:03:40.750> the

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
and squeeze the living heck out of the

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.050 
and squeeze the living heck out of the
golf<00:03:41.079> club<00:03:41.349> so<00:03:42.010> you<00:03:42.069> want<00:03:42.250> to<00:03:42.310> hold<00:03:42.430> it<00:03:42.579> really

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
golf club so you want to hold it really

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.180 
golf club so you want to hold it really
really<00:03:43.329> lightly<00:03:43.750> Sam<00:03:44.500> Snead<00:03:44.769> used<00:03:44.949> to<00:03:45.040> say

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
really lightly Sam Snead used to say

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:46.439 
really lightly Sam Snead used to say
like<00:03:45.400> you<00:03:45.519> were<00:03:45.579> going<00:03:45.699> to<00:03:45.790> caress<00:03:46.090> a<00:03:46.120> baby

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:46.449 
like you were going to caress a baby

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:49.199 
like you were going to caress a baby
bird<00:03:46.780> the<00:03:47.680> lighter<00:03:47.919> you<00:03:48.099> hold<00:03:48.310> it<00:03:48.459> the<00:03:49.030> odd

bird the lighter you hold it the odd

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:50.879 
bird the lighter you hold it the odd
thing<00:03:49.480> about<00:03:49.540> it<00:03:49.810> you<00:03:49.900> get<00:03:50.079> more<00:03:50.109> power<00:03:50.590> your

release the club because remember the
word<00:03:56.319> release<00:03:56.709> is<00:03:56.919> letting<00:03:57.549> go<00:03:57.579> you<00:03:58.120> can't<00:03:58.480> do

00:03:58.649 --> 00:03:58.659 
word release is letting go you can't do

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:00.990 
word release is letting go you can't do
that<00:03:58.840> with<00:03:59.049> an<00:03:59.169> over<00:03:59.500> tight<00:03:59.709> grip<00:03:59.980> so<00:04:00.730> you<00:04:00.790> know

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
that with an over tight grip so you know

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.689 
that with an over tight grip so you know
what<00:04:01.150> a<00:04:01.180> neutral<00:04:01.599> grip<00:04:01.750> is<00:04:01.930> now<00:04:02.430> you<00:04:03.430> know<00:04:03.549> what

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:03.699 
what a neutral grip is now you know what

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:05.970 
what a neutral grip is now you know what
the<00:04:03.819> right<00:04:03.940> grip<00:04:04.209> pressure<00:04:04.419> is<00:04:04.780> so<00:04:05.590> with<00:04:05.769> any

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
the right grip pressure is so with any

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.229 
the right grip pressure is so with any
pressure<00:04:06.250> at<00:04:06.400> all<00:04:06.489> the<00:04:06.609> hand<00:04:06.760> where<00:04:06.970> should<00:04:07.209> I

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 
pressure at all the hand where should I

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:08.640 
pressure at all the hand where should I
hold<00:04:07.449> it<00:04:07.659> because<00:04:07.930> otherwise<00:04:08.109> the<00:04:08.440> club's

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
pressure at all in the left hand should

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.949 
pressure at all in the left hand should
simply<00:04:11.979> be<00:04:12.129> the<00:04:12.250> last<00:04:12.459> three<00:04:12.639> fingers<00:04:13.120> but

these<00:04:31.270> two<00:04:31.510> fingers<00:04:31.900> which<00:04:32.080> I<00:04:32.230> see<00:04:32.380> a<00:04:32.410> lot<00:04:32.650> in

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
these two fingers which I see a lot in

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.280 
these two fingers which I see a lot in
programs<00:04:33.190> are<00:04:33.580> over<00:04:34.000> tight<00:04:34.240> and<00:04:34.540> the<00:04:34.990> reason

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:35.290 
programs are over tight and the reason

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:37.020 
programs are over tight and the reason
why<00:04:35.410> that<00:04:35.440> is<00:04:35.620> a<00:04:35.770> swing<00:04:36.100> record<00:04:36.520> so<00:04:36.670> to<00:04:36.730> speak

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
why that is a swing record so to speak

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.760 
why that is a swing record so to speak
will<00:04:37.180> swing<00:04:37.420> killer<00:04:37.660> because<00:04:38.380> that's<00:04:38.530> what<00:04:38.680> we

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
will swing killer because that's what we

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.530 
will swing killer because that's what we
do<00:04:38.920> every<00:04:39.160> day<00:04:39.190> when<00:04:39.520> we<00:04:39.610> write<00:04:39.820> with<00:04:40.000> a<00:04:40.030> pen<00:04:40.330> we

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:40.540 
do every day when we write with a pen we

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.480 
do every day when we write with a pen we
use<00:04:40.750> things<00:04:41.050> start<00:04:41.710> the<00:04:41.860> car<00:04:42.040> with<00:04:42.220> the<00:04:42.280> keys

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
use things start the car with the keys

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.520 
use things start the car with the keys
we<00:04:42.640> overuse<00:04:43.450> these<00:04:43.660> fingers<00:04:44.020> now<00:04:44.170> if<00:04:44.230> we<00:04:44.320> use

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 
we overuse these fingers now if we use

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.260 
we overuse these fingers now if we use
these<00:04:44.710> in<00:04:44.860> the<00:04:44.920> golf<00:04:45.130> club<00:04:45.400> it's<00:04:46.030> going<00:04:46.210> to

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
these in the golf club it's going to

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.090 
these in the golf club it's going to
create<00:04:46.570> casting<00:04:47.170> from<00:04:47.290> the<00:04:47.470> top<00:04:47.650> because<00:04:47.950> too

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:48.100 
create casting from the top because too

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.100 
create casting from the top because too
much<00:04:48.250> pressure<00:04:48.550> is<00:04:48.730> there<00:04:48.760> so<00:04:49.720> these<00:04:49.870> two

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
much pressure is there so these two

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:51.510 
much pressure is there so these two
really<00:04:50.410> have<00:04:50.530> to<00:04:50.620> be<00:04:50.710> glued<00:04:50.980> together<00:04:51.160> and

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
really have to be glued together and

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.820 
really have to be glued together and
they<00:04:51.940> sit<00:04:52.210> there<00:04:52.240> for<00:04:52.570> the<00:04:52.630> ride<00:04:52.870> they<00:04:53.530> tell<00:04:53.800> me

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
they sit there for the ride they tell me

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:54.990 
they sit there for the ride they tell me
that<00:04:54.040> the<00:04:54.160> club<00:04:54.340> is<00:04:54.370> in<00:04:54.580> the<00:04:54.670> right<00:04:54.820> position
