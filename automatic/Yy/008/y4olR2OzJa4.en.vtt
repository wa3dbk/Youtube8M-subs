00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:17.000 
here at press camp in Park City we've

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.759 
here at press camp in Park City we've
just<00:00:17.029> brought<00:00:17.359> out<00:00:17.420> the<00:00:17.660> blind<00:00:17.900> of<00:00:18.109> fours<00:00:18.380> and

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:18.769 
just brought out the blind of fours and

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:21.070 
just brought out the blind of fours and
the<00:00:19.460> key<00:00:19.760> concept<00:00:20.210> behind<00:00:20.300> these<00:00:20.599> lights<00:00:20.869> is

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:21.080 
the key concept behind these lights is

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.099 
the key concept behind these lights is
that<00:00:21.289> they're<00:00:21.470> solid<00:00:21.830> you're<00:00:22.310> constructed<00:00:22.910> a

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:23.109 
that they're solid you're constructed a

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:26.710 
that they're solid you're constructed a
USB<00:00:24.109> rechargeable<00:00:24.320> so<00:00:25.279> the<00:00:25.369> blinder<00:00:25.760> for<00:00:26.420> has

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:26.720 
USB rechargeable so the blinder for has

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.839

ride and they come in a range of

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.220 
ride and they come in a range of
different<00:01:06.620> designs<00:01:07.270> so<00:01:08.270> the<00:01:08.690> blinder<00:01:09.020> for

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:09.230 
different designs so the blinder for

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:13.540 
different designs so the blinder for
we've<00:01:09.530> got<00:01:09.770> a<00:01:09.800> circle<00:01:10.580> arrow<00:01:11.620> original<00:01:12.620> and<00:01:12.890> GT

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:13.550 
we've got a circle arrow original and GT

stripe hold the button down for two

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.520 
stripe hold the button down for two
seconds<00:01:16.970> to<00:01:17.420> turn<00:01:17.570> the<00:01:17.720> monster<00:01:17.900> that<00:01:18.140> in<00:01:18.290> turn

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
seconds to turn the monster that in turn

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.350 
seconds to turn the monster that in turn
don't<00:01:19.250> turn<00:01:19.430> on<00:01:19.520> accidentally<00:01:20.030> in<00:01:20.090> your<00:01:20.120> bag

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
don't turn on accidentally in your bag

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.760 
don't turn on accidentally in your bag
and<00:01:22.420> I've<00:01:23.420> got<00:01:23.600> a<00:01:23.630> really<00:01:24.020> simple<00:01:24.440> strapping

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
and I've got a really simple strapping

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.250 
and I've got a really simple strapping
system<00:01:25.130> so<00:01:25.430> we<00:01:25.610> developed<00:01:26.330> the<00:01:26.660> whole<00:01:26.810> silicon

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:27.260 
system so we developed the whole silicon

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.920 
system so we developed the whole silicon
strap<00:01:27.440> setup<00:01:27.800> we've<00:01:28.430> designed<00:01:28.670> a<00:01:29.030> cam<00:01:29.480> system

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
strap setup we've designed a cam system

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.960 
strap setup we've designed a cam system
here<00:01:30.290> it's<00:01:30.890> basically<00:01:31.190> what<00:01:31.370> it<00:01:31.400> allows<00:01:31.700> it

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
here it's basically what it allows it

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.570 
here it's basically what it allows it
allows<00:01:32.150> a<00:01:32.180> good<00:01:32.510> serve<00:01:33.470> I<00:01:33.620> suppose<00:01:33.890> grip<00:01:34.280> on<00:01:34.520> a

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:34.580 
allows a good serve I suppose grip on a

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.970 
allows a good serve I suppose grip on a
thin<00:01:34.880> bar<00:01:35.090> and<00:01:35.390> you<00:01:36.290> can<00:01:36.470> get<00:01:36.620> a<00:01:36.650> really<00:01:36.950> good

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:36.980 
thin bar and you can get a really good

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.850 
thin bar and you can get a really good
grip<00:01:37.370> of<00:01:37.670> a<00:01:38.000> really<00:01:38.390> fat<00:01:38.780> bar<00:01:38.990> as<00:01:39.140> well<00:01:39.200> so

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
grip of a really fat bar as well so

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.070 
grip of a really fat bar as well so
around<00:01:40.370> 22<00:01:40.970> through<00:01:41.360> to<00:01:41.480> about<00:01:41.570> 38

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
around 22 through to about 38

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.940 
around 22 through to about 38
millimeters<00:01:43.150> diamond<00:01:44.150> bar<00:01:44.650> so<00:01:45.650> that's<00:01:45.800> the

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
millimeters diamond bar so that's the

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.740 
millimeters diamond bar so that's the
blinders<00:01:46.400> blinder<00:01:46.880> for<00:01:47.120> blinder<00:01:47.720> one<00:01:47.900> on

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
blinders blinder for blinder one on

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.240 
blinders blinder for blinder one on
