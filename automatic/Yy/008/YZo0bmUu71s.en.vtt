00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:05.629
 very good girls very good guys I am 

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:09.049
 me and we are in a new news the 

00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:10.820
 project and such the electric car of 

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:12.259
 apple I know it 's news of 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.389
 videogames to use but the truth is that 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:17.300
 I wanted to share it with all of you already 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:20.120
 that today I have seen this news that according to 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.100
 reports the wall street journal through 

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.110
 sources close to apple the signature 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.660
 Californian would have started a new 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:29.030
 project this time away from the gadget 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.490
 typical of the apple brand no longer 

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:33.980
 you know I would be developing your own 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:36.590
 electric car known as project and 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:39.110
 is in line with the current tests 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:42.020
 lab so he would still be in his 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.520
 first phases of development with what 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.890
 you would have to wait a few years to see the 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.930
 result but apparently apple would have 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.460
 contacted with several companies of 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:53.270
 supply of automotive components 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.020
 among them the austrian australia brand 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.630
 magna 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.690
 Tim Cook would have given the green light to 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:01.610
 project a few years ago but recruiting 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.489
 to several professionals of the sector for 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:07.460
 project and make it a success not 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.960
 apple would use that project to 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.210
 keep growing like a giant 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.549
 technological and apply its innovations 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:17.569
 the traditional products in said 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:19.850
 automobile and the truth is that it seems 

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:22.549
 be that if they will take you to get this to 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:25.219
 a good apple port could 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:26.810
 surprise us with your own car 

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:29.689
 electrical and it's something that has 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:32.810
 left fascinated as there was but as 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:34.369
 brand has always fascinated me has 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.770
 liked that he has never had products of 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:39.259
 apple because it's something that I always 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.950
 I would have liked to have although it is 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:42.529
 non-viable 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:45.200
 today economically they are products 

00:01:42.529 --> 00:01:48.529
 they are very expensive out of my reach 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.849
 purchasing power and good then that but 

00:01:48.529 --> 00:01:50.990
 I wanted to share this news with 

00:01:49.849 --> 00:01:52.490
 you who think it's pretty 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.469
 important even if it's not in the world of 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.349
 the video games but yes you have to 

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:59.389
 see with all this technology and I 

00:01:57.349 --> 00:02:00.740
 and I wanted to share it more than on the channel 

00:01:59.389 --> 00:02:03.289
 secondary with all of you in this 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.749
