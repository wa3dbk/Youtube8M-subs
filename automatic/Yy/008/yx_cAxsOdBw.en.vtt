the track looks wide it's really one

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.260 
the track looks wide it's really one
line<00:01:35.820> out<00:01:36.149> there

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.719 

I<00:01:39.359> missed<00:01:40.140> that<00:01:40.439> little<00:01:40.920> bit<00:01:41.070> bumped<00:01:41.460> him<00:01:41.579> and

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
I missed that little bit bumped him and

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.669 
I missed that little bit bumped him and
moved<00:01:41.939> him<00:01:42.060> out<00:01:42.179> of<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.299> way<00:01:42.450> but<00:01:42.780> we've<00:01:43.469> got<00:01:43.649> a

00:01:43.669 --> 00:01:43.679 
moved him out of the way but we've got a

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:45.080 
moved him out of the way but we've got a
rule<00:01:43.979> that<00:01:44.219> if<00:01:44.340> you're<00:01:44.490> involved<00:01:44.909> in<00:01:45.000> a

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
rule that if you're involved in a

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.760 
rule that if you're involved in a
caution<00:01:45.539> or<00:01:45.659> if<00:01:45.750> you<00:01:45.840> cause<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.049> caution<00:01:46.560> you<00:01:46.619> go

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
caution or if you cause a caution you go

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.950 
caution or if you cause a caution you go
the<00:01:46.920> tails<00:01:47.159> so<00:01:47.490> I<00:01:47.729> did<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.390> right<00:01:48.420> thing<00:01:48.780> and

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
the tails so I did the right thing and

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.719 
the tails so I did the right thing and
went<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.229> back<00:01:49.409> we<00:01:49.829> are<00:01:49.860> competitive<00:01:50.520> on

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
went to the back we are competitive on

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.429 
went to the back we are competitive on
the<00:01:50.880> track<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.539> I<00:01:51.719> like<00:01:51.899> to<00:01:52.020> think<00:01:52.049> we<00:01:52.289> give

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
the track and I like to think we give

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.219 
the track and I like to think we give
each<00:01:52.560> other<00:01:52.710> room<00:01:53.100> but<00:01:54.030> sometimes<00:01:54.899> we<00:01:55.079> get<00:01:55.170> a

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
each other room but sometimes we get a

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.779 
each other room but sometimes we get a
