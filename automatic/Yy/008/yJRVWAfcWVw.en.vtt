00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:07.580 

hi<00:00:05.610> there<00:00:05.850> now<00:00:06.420> in<00:00:06.600> this<00:00:06.690> video<00:00:06.900> what<00:00:07.319> I<00:00:07.350> want

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:07.590 
hi there now in this video what I want

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:09.789 
hi there now in this video what I want
to<00:00:07.740> do<00:00:07.980> is<00:00:08.370> show<00:00:08.969> you<00:00:09.000> how<00:00:09.120> we<00:00:09.389> go<00:00:09.630> about

00:00:09.789 --> 00:00:09.799 
to do is show you how we go about

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:13.789 
to do is show you how we go about
dividing<00:00:10.799> two<00:00:11.430> complex<00:00:12.000> numbers<00:00:12.530> I've<00:00:13.530> got<00:00:13.740> an

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
dividing two complex numbers I've got an

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.039 
dividing two complex numbers I've got an
example<00:00:14.129> here<00:00:14.309> where<00:00:14.670> we've<00:00:14.879> got<00:00:14.910> 5<00:00:15.389> plus<00:00:15.719> 2<00:00:16.020> I

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
example here where we've got 5 plus 2 I

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.720 
example here where we've got 5 plus 2 I
divided<00:00:16.770> by<00:00:17.039> 3<00:00:17.460> minus<00:00:17.490> 4i<00:00:18.330> and<00:00:19.310> to<00:00:20.310> do<00:00:20.490> this

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
divided by 3 minus 4i and to do this

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.609 
divided by 3 minus 4i and to do this
what<00:00:21.359> we<00:00:21.509> do<00:00:21.779> is<00:00:22.220> we<00:00:23.220> take<00:00:23.609> our<00:00:23.670> fraction<00:00:24.619> this

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
what we do is we take our fraction this

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.909 
what we do is we take our fraction this
case<00:00:25.859> 5<00:00:26.250> plus<00:00:26.550> 2i<00:00:27.000> then<00:00:27.449> divided<00:00:28.439> by<00:00:28.470> 3<00:00:28.890> minus

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:28.919 
case 5 plus 2i then divided by 3 minus

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:35.480 
case 5 plus 2i then divided by 3 minus
4i<00:00:29.669> and<00:00:30.589> we<00:00:31.589> multiply<00:00:33.079> top<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:34.140> bottom<00:00:34.680> of<00:00:35.340> the

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:35.490 
4i and we multiply top and bottom of the

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.420 
4i and we multiply top and bottom of the
fraction<00:00:35.730> by<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.690> complex<00:00:37.410> conjugate<00:00:38.100> of<00:00:38.250> the

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
fraction by the complex conjugate of the

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.150 
fraction by the complex conjugate of the
denominator<00:00:38.870> in<00:00:39.870> other<00:00:40.020> words<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.740> complex

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
denominator in other words the complex

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.340 
denominator in other words the complex
conjugate<00:00:41.730> of<00:00:41.820> 3<00:00:42.000> minus<00:00:42.570> 4i<00:00:42.870> is<00:00:43.760> 3<00:00:44.760> plus<00:00:45.330> 4i<00:00:45.660> so

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
conjugate of 3 minus 4i is 3 plus 4i so

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.370 
conjugate of 3 minus 4i is 3 plus 4i so
you<00:00:46.410> multiply<00:00:46.650> top<00:00:47.580> and<00:00:47.640> bottom<00:00:47.850> then<00:00:48.330> by<00:00:49.020> 3

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:49.380 
you multiply top and bottom then by 3

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:54.200 
you multiply top and bottom then by 3
plus<00:00:49.650> 4i<00:00:50.240> obviously<00:00:51.240> this<00:00:52.170> is<00:00:52.470> 1<00:00:53.280> so<00:00:53.880> we're<00:00:54.060> not

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
plus 4i obviously this is 1 so we're not

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.120 
plus 4i obviously this is 1 so we're not
changing<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.810> value<00:00:54.960> of<00:00:55.470> the<00:00:55.620> fraction<00:00:55.740> just

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:56.130 
changing the value of the fraction just

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.230 
changing the value of the fraction just
changing<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.180> appearance<00:00:58.280> so<00:00:59.280> what<00:01:00.060> does

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:00.240 
changing the appearance so what does

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.470 
changing the appearance so what does
this<00:01:00.420> give<00:01:00.900> us<00:01:00.930> well<00:01:01.650> if<00:01:02.310> we<00:01:02.940> were<00:01:03.060> to<00:01:03.090> look<00:01:03.420> at

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
this give us well if we were to look at

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.260 
this give us well if we were to look at
the<00:01:04.110> denominator<00:01:04.799> here<00:01:05.280> just<00:01:05.610> expand<00:01:06.150> that

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
the denominator here just expand that

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.970 
the denominator here just expand that
out<00:01:06.570> first<00:01:07.020> of<00:01:07.259> all<00:01:08.120> then<00:01:09.120> we've<00:01:10.080> got<00:01:10.350> 3<00:01:10.680> times

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:10.980 
out first of all then we've got 3 times

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.850 
out first of all then we've got 3 times
3<00:01:11.460> which<00:01:11.670> is<00:01:11.880> 9<00:01:12.120> and<00:01:12.930> then<00:01:13.350> we're<00:01:13.500> going<00:01:13.620> to<00:01:13.710> get

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
3 which is 9 and then we're going to get

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.640 
3 which is 9 and then we're going to get
3<00:01:14.310> times<00:01:14.700> 4<00:01:15.150> I<00:01:15.180> which<00:01:15.750> is<00:01:15.780> 12<00:01:16.290> I<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:16.770> then<00:01:17.490> minus

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 
3 times 4 I which is 12 I and then minus

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.420 
3 times 4 I which is 12 I and then minus
12i<00:01:19.650> when<00:01:20.159> we<00:01:20.310> do<00:01:20.550> minus<00:01:21.150> y<00:01:21.360> times<00:01:21.750> 3<00:01:22.170> so<00:01:22.560> the

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
12i when we do minus y times 3 so the

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.710 
12i when we do minus y times 3 so the
imaginary<00:01:23.670> parts<00:01:24.270> are<00:01:24.390> going<00:01:24.510> to<00:01:24.570> get

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
imaginary parts are going to get

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.940 
imaginary parts are going to get
cancelled<00:01:25.350> out

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
cancelled out

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.660 
cancelled out
then<00:01:26.940> we've<00:01:27.120> got<00:01:27.330> minus<00:01:27.900> 4i<00:01:28.340> multiplied<00:01:29.340> with

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
then we've got minus 4i multiplied with

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.380 
then we've got minus 4i multiplied with
plus<00:01:30.300> 4i<00:01:30.630> so<00:01:30.810> it's<00:01:31.200> going<00:01:31.380> to<00:01:31.530> be<00:01:31.680> minus<00:01:32.580> 16<00:01:33.150> I

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
plus 4i so it's going to be minus 16 I

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.290 
plus 4i so it's going to be minus 16 I
squared<00:01:33.930> but<00:01:34.260> I<00:01:34.290> squared<00:01:34.830> is<00:01:35.010> minus<00:01:35.040> 1<00:01:35.670> so<00:01:35.880> you

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.300 
squared but I squared is minus 1 so you

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.530 
squared but I squared is minus 1 so you
end<00:01:36.540> up<00:01:36.720> with<00:01:36.960> plus<00:01:37.260> 16<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.880> what<00:01:39.060> we<00:01:39.180> get<00:01:39.390> in

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
end up with plus 16 and what we get in

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.219 
end up with plus 16 and what we get in
the<00:01:39.690> denominator<00:01:40.350> here<00:01:40.830> is<00:01:41.010> a<00:01:41.400> real<00:01:41.790> number<00:01:42.229> 25

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
the denominator here is a real number 25

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.300 
the denominator here is a real number 25
and<00:01:44.360> what<00:01:45.360> that<00:01:45.630> does<00:01:45.900> then<00:01:45.930> by<00:01:46.650> multiplying

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
and what that does then by multiplying

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.390 
and what that does then by multiplying
by<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.729> complex<00:01:48.390> conjugate<00:01:48.570> here<00:01:49.409> means<00:01:50.159> that

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:50.400 
by the complex conjugate here means that

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.590 
by the complex conjugate here means that
we<00:01:50.549> remove<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.840> imaginary<00:01:52.440> part<00:01:53.120> as<00:01:54.120> for<00:01:54.510> the

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
we remove the imaginary part as for the

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.469 
we remove the imaginary part as for the
top<00:01:54.870> if<00:01:55.140> we<00:01:55.170> multiply<00:01:55.770> out<00:01:55.950> 5<00:01:56.340> plus<00:01:56.580> 2i<00:01:56.820> with<00:01:57.210> 3

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
top if we multiply out 5 plus 2i with 3

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.609 
top if we multiply out 5 plus 2i with 3
plus<00:01:57.720> 5i<00:01:58.020> we<00:01:58.320> get<00:01:58.530> 5<00:01:58.830> times<00:01:59.100> 3<00:01:59.549> which<00:01:59.760> is<00:01:59.790> 15

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
plus 5i we get 5 times 3 which is 15

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:05.120 
plus 5i we get 5 times 3 which is 15
then<00:02:01.619> we've<00:02:01.830> got<00:02:02.070> 5<00:02:02.520> times<00:02:02.940> 4<00:02:03.420> which<00:02:04.020> is<00:02:04.049> 20<00:02:04.650> I

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
then we've got 5 times 4 which is 20 I

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.430 
then we've got 5 times 4 which is 20 I
and<00:02:05.960> then<00:02:06.960> 2i<00:02:07.440> times<00:02:08.039> 3<00:02:08.519> which<00:02:08.879> is<00:02:08.909> plus<00:02:09.599> 6i<00:02:10.200> and

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
and then 2i times 3 which is plus 6i and

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.910 
and then 2i times 3 which is plus 6i and
then<00:02:11.250> you've<00:02:11.430> got<00:02:11.640> 2<00:02:11.999> I<00:02:12.029> times<00:02:12.569> 4<00:02:13.079> I<00:02:13.109> which<00:02:13.769> will

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
then you've got 2 I times 4 I which will

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.470 
then you've got 2 I times 4 I which will
be<00:02:14.069> 8i<00:02:14.340> squared<00:02:15.120> I<00:02:15.389> squared<00:02:15.510> is<00:02:16.170> my

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
be 8i squared I squared is my

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.300 
be 8i squared I squared is my
this<00:02:16.599> one<00:02:16.840> so<00:02:17.140> you're<00:02:17.260> gonna<00:02:17.349> get<00:02:17.560> minus<00:02:18.099> eight

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
this one so you're gonna get minus eight

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.039 
this one so you're gonna get minus eight
there<00:02:18.930> and<00:02:19.930> if<00:02:20.050> we<00:02:20.260> simplify<00:02:21.040> this<00:02:21.310> further<00:02:22.049> we

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:23.049 
there and if we simplify this further we

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:26.430 
there and if we simplify this further we
end<00:02:23.260> up<00:02:23.560> with<00:02:23.950> 15<00:02:24.489> minus<00:02:25.120> 8<00:02:25.299> which<00:02:25.629> is<00:02:25.659> 7<00:02:26.260> and

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
end up with 15 minus 8 which is 7 and

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.770 
end up with 15 minus 8 which is 7 and
then<00:02:27.069> the<00:02:27.099> 20<00:02:27.760> I<00:02:28.060> plus<00:02:28.599> 6i<00:02:29.080> is<00:02:29.379> 26<00:02:30.220> I<00:02:30.459> and<00:02:31.060> that's

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
then the 20 I plus 6i is 26 I and that's

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:37.650 
then the 20 I plus 6i is 26 I and that's
all<00:02:32.140> divided<00:02:32.769> by<00:02:32.799> the<00:02:33.220> real<00:02:33.940> number<00:02:34.620> 25<00:02:36.660> now

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
all divided by the real number 25 now

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.100 
all divided by the real number 25 now
it's<00:02:37.870> not<00:02:38.019> good<00:02:38.319> to<00:02:38.530> leave<00:02:38.650> this<00:02:38.950> like<00:02:39.280> this<00:02:40.110> we

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
it's not good to leave this like this we

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.410 
it's not good to leave this like this we
normally<00:02:41.319> split<00:02:42.069> this<00:02:42.220> up<00:02:42.280> into<00:02:42.610> a<00:02:42.819> real<00:02:43.060> part

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
normally split this up into a real part

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.500 
normally split this up into a real part
and<00:02:43.599> an<00:02:43.780> imaginary<00:02:43.900> part<00:02:44.379> so<00:02:45.099> this<00:02:45.849> would<00:02:46.329> be

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
and an imaginary part so this would be

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.809 
and an imaginary part so this would be
better<00:02:46.780> as<00:02:47.250> seven<00:02:48.250> twenty-fifths<00:02:49.769> plus

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
better as seven twenty-fifths plus

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:56.910 
better as seven twenty-fifths plus
twenty<00:02:51.819> six<00:02:52.150> twenty<00:02:52.900> fifths<00:02:53.230> I<00:02:55.650> now<00:02:56.650> I've<00:02:56.769> got

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
twenty six twenty fifths I now I've got

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.180 
twenty six twenty fifths I now I've got
another<00:02:57.129> example<00:02:57.370> here<00:02:58.329> and<00:02:58.650> in<00:02:59.650> the<00:02:59.799> second

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
another example here and in the second

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.770 
another example here and in the second
one<00:03:00.340> would<00:03:00.790> just<00:03:00.819> do<00:03:01.180> three<00:03:01.599> minus<00:03:02.109> 5i<00:03:02.910> /<00:03:03.910> and

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
one would just do three minus 5i / and

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.630 
one would just do three minus 5i / and
we'll<00:03:05.680> just<00:03:05.829> take<00:03:06.129> an<00:03:06.370> imaginary<00:03:07.709> part<00:03:08.709> to<00:03:09.459> our

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
we'll just take an imaginary part to our

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.770 
we'll just take an imaginary part to our
complex<00:03:10.180> number<00:03:10.359> just<00:03:11.290> to<00:03:11.379> I<00:03:12.450> so<00:03:13.450> how<00:03:13.599> would<00:03:13.660> I

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
complex number just to I so how would I

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.920 
complex number just to I so how would I
handle<00:03:14.230> something<00:03:14.500> like<00:03:14.950> this<00:03:15.250> then<00:03:15.930> well

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
handle something like this then well

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.930 
handle something like this then well
that's<00:03:17.590> the<00:03:17.769> same<00:03:17.980> way<00:03:18.010> as<00:03:18.280> what<00:03:18.459> we<00:03:18.579> did<00:03:18.730> up

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
that's the same way as what we did up

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.020 
that's the same way as what we did up
here<00:03:19.239> and<00:03:19.480> that<00:03:19.930> is<00:03:20.200> we<00:03:20.530> take<00:03:20.739> our<00:03:20.950> fraction<00:03:21.579> 3

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
here and that is we take our fraction 3

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:28.080 
here and that is we take our fraction 3
minus<00:03:22.720> 5i<00:03:23.519> /<00:03:24.750> -<00:03:25.750> I<00:03:25.780> but<00:03:26.620> we<00:03:26.799> multiply<00:03:27.400> top<00:03:28.030> and

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
minus 5i / - I but we multiply top and

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.289 
minus 5i / - I but we multiply top and
bottom<00:03:28.299> by<00:03:28.660> the<00:03:28.840> complex<00:03:29.250> conjugate<00:03:30.250> of<00:03:30.299> 2i

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:31.299 
bottom by the complex conjugate of 2i

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:34.860 
bottom by the complex conjugate of 2i
which<00:03:32.079> is<00:03:32.260> going<00:03:32.380> to<00:03:32.440> be<00:03:32.620> minus<00:03:33.489> 2i<00:03:33.870> so

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
which is going to be minus 2i so

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.390 
which is going to be minus 2i so
multiplying<00:03:35.799> top<00:03:36.370> and<00:03:36.430> bottom<00:03:36.609> by<00:03:36.970> minus<00:03:37.569> 2i

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
multiplying top and bottom by minus 2i

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.809 
multiplying top and bottom by minus 2i
gives<00:03:39.400> us<00:03:39.930> well<00:03:40.930> in<00:03:41.349> the<00:03:41.560> denominator<00:03:42.280> what

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:42.819 
gives us well in the denominator what

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:45.539 
gives us well in the denominator what
we're<00:03:43.090> going<00:03:43.329> to<00:03:43.450> have<00:03:43.930> is<00:03:44.380> just<00:03:44.650> going<00:03:45.190> to<00:03:45.370> be

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:45.549 
we're going to have is just going to be

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:48.509 
we're going to have is just going to be
2<00:03:46.269> I<00:03:46.299> times<00:03:46.720> minus<00:03:46.959> 2i<00:03:47.590> which<00:03:47.919> is<00:03:48.099> going<00:03:48.310> to<00:03:48.400> be

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 
2 I times minus 2i which is going to be

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:52.559 
2 I times minus 2i which is going to be
minus<00:03:49.030> 4i<00:03:49.720> squared<00:03:50.410> I<00:03:50.709> squared<00:03:51.370> is<00:03:51.940> minus<00:03:51.970> 1<00:03:52.540> so

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:52.569 
minus 4i squared I squared is minus 1 so

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:56.300 
minus 4i squared I squared is minus 1 so
you're<00:03:52.930> going<00:03:53.139> to<00:03:53.319> end<00:03:53.560> up<00:03:53.829> with<00:03:54.220> just<00:03:54.940> 4

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
you're going to end up with just 4

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.369 
you're going to end up with just 4
multiplied<00:03:57.310> at<00:03:57.430> the<00:03:57.519> top<00:03:57.760> out<00:03:58.000> though<00:03:58.389> 3<00:03:59.109> times

multiplied at the top out though 3 times

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:02.360 
multiplied at the top out though 3 times
minus<00:03:59.919> 2i<00:04:00.160> is<00:04:00.340> going<00:04:00.669> to<00:04:00.730> be<00:04:00.849> minus<00:04:01.299> 6i<00:04:01.810> minus

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
minus 2i is going to be minus 6i minus

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.089 
minus 2i is going to be minus 6i minus
5i<00:04:03.370> times<00:04:04.000> minus<00:04:04.540> 2i<00:04:04.810> that's<00:04:05.410> going<00:04:05.859> to<00:04:05.980> be

00:04:06.089 --> 00:04:06.099 
5i times minus 2i that's going to be

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:09.330 
5i times minus 2i that's going to be
plus<00:04:06.430> 10i<00:04:07.030> squared<00:04:07.060> I<00:04:07.810> squared<00:04:08.169> is<00:04:08.680> minus<00:04:09.099> 1<00:04:09.310> so

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
plus 10i squared I squared is minus 1 so

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.250 
plus 10i squared I squared is minus 1 so
you're<00:04:09.730> going<00:04:09.849> to<00:04:09.879> end<00:04:10.060> up<00:04:10.209> with<00:04:10.359> minus<00:04:10.810> 10<00:04:11.109> and

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
you're going to end up with minus 10 and

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.960 
you're going to end up with minus 10 and
rearranging<00:04:14.260> this<00:04:14.440> writing<00:04:14.919> the<00:04:15.280> real<00:04:15.549> part

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
rearranging this writing the real part

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.210 
rearranging this writing the real part
first<00:04:16.299> that's<00:04:16.570> going<00:04:16.660> to<00:04:16.810> be<00:04:16.900> minus<00:04:17.349> 10<00:04:17.590> over<00:04:17.799> 4

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
first that's going to be minus 10 over 4

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.650 
first that's going to be minus 10 over 4
which<00:04:18.549> reduces<00:04:19.180> to<00:04:19.389> minus<00:04:19.419> 5<00:04:20.199> over<00:04:20.229> 2<00:04:20.859> and<00:04:21.660> then

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 
which reduces to minus 5 over 2 and then

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.350 
which reduces to minus 5 over 2 and then
you've<00:04:22.840> got<00:04:23.020> minus<00:04:23.470> 6i<00:04:23.979> over<00:04:24.520> 4<00:04:24.760> which<00:04:25.330> is

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
you've got minus 6i over 4 which is

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.400 
you've got minus 6i over 4 which is
minus<00:04:26.460> 3<00:04:27.460> over<00:04:28.060> 2

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
minus 3 over 2

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.940 
minus 3 over 2
I<00:04:29.510> so<00:04:30.510> we<00:04:30.750> got<00:04:30.900> it<00:04:31.020> in<00:04:31.110> the<00:04:31.200> form<00:04:31.380> of<00:04:31.620> a<00:04:31.740> real

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:31.950 
I so we got it in the form of a real

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:36.580 
I so we got it in the form of a real
part<00:04:32.310> and<00:04:32.640> then<00:04:33.300> the<00:04:33.450> imaginary<00:04:33.690> part<00:04:35.360> well

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
part and then the imaginary part well

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:40.160 
part and then the imaginary part well
what<00:04:37.590> I've<00:04:37.710> got<00:04:38.010> here<00:04:38.370> next<00:04:38.730> is<00:04:39.150> an<00:04:39.750> example

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:40.170 
what I've got here next is an example

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:43.760 
what I've got here next is an example
you<00:04:40.560> might<00:04:40.740> like<00:04:41.010> to<00:04:41.040> try<00:04:42.230> for<00:04:43.230> number<00:04:43.500> three

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
you might like to try for number three

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.450 
you might like to try for number three
then<00:04:44.070> if<00:04:44.670> set<00:04:45.000> one<00:04:45.240> is<00:04:45.450> 6<00:04:45.750> minus<00:04:46.200> 3i<00:04:46.500> and<00:04:46.890> said<00:04:47.190> 2

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
then if set one is 6 minus 3i and said 2

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.170 
then if set one is 6 minus 3i and said 2
is<00:04:47.730> equal<00:04:48.210> to<00:04:48.240> minus<00:04:48.360> 5<00:04:49.020> minus<00:04:49.470> 3i<00:04:50.180> express

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
is equal to minus 5 minus 3i express

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.140 
is equal to minus 5 minus 3i express
said<00:04:51.450> 1<00:04:51.660> divided<00:04:52.650> by<00:04:52.680> said<00:04:53.040> two<00:04:53.250> in<00:04:53.520> the<00:04:53.640> form<00:04:53.880> a

said 1 divided by said two in the form a
plus<00:04:54.750> bi<00:04:56.270> so<00:04:57.270> if<00:04:57.810> you'd<00:04:57.930> like<00:04:58.050> to<00:04:58.200> try<00:04:58.320> that

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.740 
plus bi so if you'd like to try that
just<00:04:59.430> give<00:04:59.670> you<00:04:59.760> a<00:04:59.820> moment<00:05:00.000> to<00:05:00.300> pause<00:05:00.480> the

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
just give you a moment to pause the

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:05.840 
just give you a moment to pause the
video<00:05:02.630> okay<00:05:03.630> let's<00:05:03.990> start<00:05:04.230> off<00:05:04.440> then<00:05:04.770> with<00:05:05.070> Z<00:05:05.520> 1

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:05.850 
video okay let's start off then with Z 1

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:09.980 
video okay let's start off then with Z 1
divided<00:05:06.720> by<00:05:06.870> Z<00:05:07.320> 2<00:05:07.650> as<00:05:07.950> our<00:05:08.190> intro<00:05:08.910> and<00:05:09.450> this<00:05:09.840> is

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
divided by Z 2 as our intro and this is

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:14.260 
divided by Z 2 as our intro and this is
going<00:05:10.290> to<00:05:10.440> be<00:05:10.560> then<00:05:10.830> 6<00:05:11.340> minus<00:05:12.000> 3i<00:05:12.920> divided<00:05:13.920> by

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270 
going to be then 6 minus 3i divided by

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:21.590 
going to be then 6 minus 3i divided by
minus<00:05:15.270> 5<00:05:15.860> minus<00:05:16.860> 3i<00:05:17.370> and<00:05:19.220> for<00:05:20.220> this<00:05:20.340> what<00:05:21.240> I<00:05:21.270> can

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:21.600 
minus 5 minus 3i and for this what I can

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.470 
minus 5 minus 3i and for this what I can
do<00:05:21.780> is<00:05:22.050> times<00:05:22.740> top<00:05:23.310> and<00:05:23.490> bottom<00:05:23.790> then<00:05:23.970> by<00:05:24.420> the

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:24.480 
do is times top and bottom then by the

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:28.250 
do is times top and bottom then by the
complex<00:05:25.110> conjugate<00:05:25.740> of<00:05:25.770> -5<00:05:26.520> minus<00:05:27.180> 3i<00:05:27.420> so

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:28.260 
complex conjugate of -5 minus 3i so

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:33.400 
complex conjugate of -5 minus 3i so
that's<00:05:28.710> going<00:05:28.980> to<00:05:29.100> be<00:05:29.220> minus<00:05:29.880> 5<00:05:30.120> plus<00:05:31.080> 3i<00:05:32.360> over

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:33.410 
that's going to be minus 5 plus 3i over

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:41.740 
that's going to be minus 5 plus 3i over
minus<00:05:34.410> 5<00:05:34.790> plus<00:05:35.790> 3i<00:05:37.280> so<00:05:38.280> if<00:05:39.060> we<00:05:39.420> expand<00:05:39.870> the<00:05:40.170> top

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:41.750 
minus 5 plus 3i so if we expand the top

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:45.730 
minus 5 plus 3i so if we expand the top
we've<00:05:42.750> got<00:05:42.780> 6<00:05:43.380> times<00:05:43.500> minus<00:05:44.220> 5<00:05:44.490> s<00:05:44.790> minus<00:05:45.240> 30

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:45.740 
we've got 6 times minus 5 s minus 30

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:51.070 
we've got 6 times minus 5 s minus 30
then<00:05:46.740> we<00:05:46.920> got<00:05:47.070> six<00:05:47.400> times<00:05:47.730> plus<00:05:48.180> 3i<00:05:48.510> is<00:05:48.930> 18<00:05:49.650> i

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.080 
then we got six times plus 3i is 18 i

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.440 
then we got six times plus 3i is 18 i
minus<00:05:52.080> 3i<00:05:52.350> times<00:05:52.800> minus<00:05:53.340> 5<00:05:53.580> that's<00:05:54.030> going<00:05:54.120> to

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:54.450 
minus 3i times minus 5 that's going to

00:05:54.450 --> 00:06:01.250 
minus 3i times minus 5 that's going to
be<00:05:54.600> plus<00:05:55.190> 15i<00:05:56.190> and<00:05:58.550> finally<00:05:59.550> minus<00:06:00.090> 3i<00:06:00.360> x<00:06:00.840> plus

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:01.260 
be plus 15i and finally minus 3i x plus

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.800 
be plus 15i and finally minus 3i x plus
3i<00:06:01.530> that's<00:06:02.190> going<00:06:02.460> to<00:06:02.520> be<00:06:02.640> minus<00:06:03.210> 9i<00:06:03.510> squared

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:03.810 
3i that's going to be minus 9i squared

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:07.760 
3i that's going to be minus 9i squared
which<00:06:04.650> will<00:06:04.860> be<00:06:05.040> then<00:06:05.370> plus<00:06:06.000> 9<00:06:06.530> and<00:06:07.530> then

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:07.770 
which will be then plus 9 and then

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:10.520 
which will be then plus 9 and then
you've<00:06:07.920> got<00:06:08.100> minus<00:06:08.520> 5<00:06:08.760> times<00:06:09.510> minus<00:06:09.990> 5<00:06:10.170> in<00:06:10.410> the

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:10.530 
you've got minus 5 times minus 5 in the

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:14.060 
you've got minus 5 times minus 5 in the
denominator<00:06:10.560> which<00:06:11.370> is<00:06:11.520> 25<00:06:12.590> the<00:06:13.590> imaginary

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:14.070 
denominator which is 25 the imaginary

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:15.650 
denominator which is 25 the imaginary
parts<00:06:14.400> now<00:06:14.610> are<00:06:14.730> going<00:06:14.880> to<00:06:14.940> cancel<00:06:15.210> one

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:15.660 
parts now are going to cancel one

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:17.390 
parts now are going to cancel one
another<00:06:15.690> out<00:06:16.080> because<00:06:16.620> you've<00:06:16.800> got<00:06:16.920> minus

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:17.400 
another out because you've got minus

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:21.410 
another out because you've got minus

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:21.420 
five times 3i which is going to be minus

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:24.440 
five times 3i which is going to be minus
15<00:06:21.570> I<00:06:22.080> and<00:06:22.350> then<00:06:23.040> you've<00:06:23.190> got<00:06:23.220> minus<00:06:23.790> 3i<00:06:24.030> times

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:24.450 
15 I and then you've got minus 3i times

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:28.610 
15 I and then you've got minus 3i times
minus<00:06:24.990> 5<00:06:25.170> which<00:06:25.500> is<00:06:25.530> plus<00:06:25.980> 15<00:06:26.220> I<00:06:26.930> so<00:06:27.930> they<00:06:28.410> get

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:28.620 
minus 5 which is plus 15 I so they get

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:29.390 
minus 5 which is plus 15 I so they get
cancelled

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:29.400 
cancelled

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.270

you're<00:06:29.580> left<00:06:29.790> now<00:06:30.000> with<00:06:30.060> minus<00:06:30.660> 3i<00:06:30.930> x<00:06:31.470> plus<00:06:31.890> 3i

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:32.280 
you're left now with minus 3i x plus 3i

which will be plus 9

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:43.550 
which will be plus 9
and<00:06:39.150> then<00:06:40.080> grouping<00:06:40.920> up<00:06:41.100> the<00:06:41.580> real<00:06:42.510> parts<00:06:43.140> here

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:43.560 
and then grouping up the real parts here

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:46.370 
and then grouping up the real parts here
you've<00:06:44.190> got<00:06:44.400> minus<00:06:44.820> 30<00:06:45.090> plus<00:06:45.270> 9<00:06:45.930> which<00:06:46.170> is

you've got minus 30 plus 9 which is
minus<00:06:46.830> 21<00:06:47.460> and<00:06:48.170> then<00:06:49.170> the<00:06:49.350> imaginary<00:06:49.530> parts<00:06:50.480> 89

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:51.480 
minus 21 and then the imaginary parts 89

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:54.980 
minus 21 and then the imaginary parts 89
plus<00:06:51.780> 15i<00:06:52.440> that's<00:06:52.830> going<00:06:53.130> to<00:06:53.250> be<00:06:53.400> plus<00:06:53.700> 30<00:06:54.270> 3i

and<00:06:55.800> all<00:06:56.430> of<00:06:56.580> that<00:06:56.610> is<00:06:57.150> divided<00:06:58.110> by<00:06:58.460> 25<00:06:59.460> plus<00:06:59.760> 9

00:06:59.840 --> 00:06:59.850 
and all of that is divided by 25 plus 9

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:03.920 
and all of that is divided by 25 plus 9
which<00:07:00.330> is<00:07:00.510> 34<00:07:01.700> don't<00:07:02.700> leave<00:07:02.940> it<00:07:03.150> like<00:07:03.330> this<00:07:03.630> we

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:03.930 
which is 34 don't leave it like this we

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:07.100 
which is 34 don't leave it like this we
need<00:07:04.080> it<00:07:04.260> in<00:07:04.380> this<00:07:04.590> form<00:07:04.980> a<00:07:05.190> plus<00:07:05.670> bi<00:07:05.910> so<00:07:06.750> we

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:07.110 
need it in this form a plus bi so we

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:11.060 
need it in this form a plus bi so we
would<00:07:07.260> split<00:07:07.590> that<00:07:07.770> 2<00:07:08.130> minus<00:07:08.310> 21<00:07:09.210> over<00:07:09.710> 34<00:07:10.710> and

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:11.070 
would split that 2 minus 21 over 34 and

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:18.520 
would split that 2 minus 21 over 34 and
then<00:07:12.030> plus<00:07:12.950> 33<00:07:13.950> over<00:07:14.940> 34<00:07:15.660> I<00:07:16.790> okay

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:18.530 
then plus 33 over 34 I okay

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:22.220 
then plus 33 over 34 I okay
it's<00:07:19.530> also<00:07:19.710> worth<00:07:20.100> noting<00:07:20.400> that<00:07:20.760> a<00:07:21.180> and<00:07:21.750> B<00:07:21.990> are

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:22.230 
it's also worth noting that a and B are

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:27.320 
it's also worth noting that a and B are
real<00:07:23.010> numbers<00:07:23.330> bi<00:07:24.330> is<00:07:24.900> the<00:07:24.960> imaginary<00:07:25.470> part<00:07:26.430> so

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:27.330 
real numbers bi is the imaginary part so

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:29.120 
real numbers bi is the imaginary part so
if<00:07:27.660> you're<00:07:28.020> asked<00:07:28.350> to<00:07:28.380> state<00:07:28.680> the<00:07:28.950> real

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:29.130 
if you're asked to state the real

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:32.720 
if you're asked to state the real
numbers<00:07:29.640> a<00:07:29.670> and<00:07:29.910> B<00:07:30.330> then<00:07:31.020> a<00:07:31.200> would<00:07:31.500> be<00:07:31.530> minus<00:07:32.160> 21

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:32.730 
numbers a and B then a would be minus 21

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:38.210 
numbers a and B then a would be minus 21
over<00:07:32.760> 34<00:07:33.690> and<00:07:33.930> B<00:07:34.200> would<00:07:34.440> be<00:07:34.580> 33<00:07:35.580> over<00:07:36.140> 34<00:07:37.220> okay
