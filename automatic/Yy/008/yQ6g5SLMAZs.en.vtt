00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
lot one's a signal and then there's a

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.060 
lot one's a signal and then there's a
third<00:00:59.150> one<00:00:59.330> that's<00:00:59.479> ground<00:00:59.839> our<00:01:00.530> auditor<00:01:00.979> is

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
the frame that holds the snap ties so

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.359 
the frame that holds the snap ties so
that's<00:01:11.600> why<00:01:11.750> I<00:01:11.780> did<00:01:12.020> and<00:01:12.260> I'm<00:01:12.920> not<00:01:13.130> on<00:01:13.250> the

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
that's why I did and I'm not on the

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:14.740 
that's why I did and I'm not on the
bottom<00:01:13.670> of<00:01:13.759> the<00:01:13.850> frame<00:01:14.030> not<00:01:14.299> down<00:01:14.479> where<00:01:14.659> it

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
bottom of the frame not down where it

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.630 
bottom of the frame not down where it
would<00:01:14.869> drag<00:01:15.049> but<00:01:15.259> on<00:01:15.590> this<00:01:15.830> upper<00:01:16.159> part<00:01:16.400> here

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
would drag but on this upper part here
