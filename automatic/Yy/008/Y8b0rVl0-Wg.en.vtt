00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:21.800 
him and you know to look at him he

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.139 
him and you know to look at him he
doesn't<00:01:21.950> necessarily<00:01:22.399> pass<00:01:22.550> the<00:01:22.759> look<00:01:22.940> test

00:01:23.139 --> 00:01:23.149

but<00:01:23.420> he's<00:01:24.140> very<00:01:24.979> very<00:01:25.100> athletic<00:01:25.789> gets<00:01:26.450> into

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
but he's very very athletic gets into

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.359 
but he's very very athletic gets into
the<00:01:26.840> paint<00:01:27.050> creates<00:01:27.470> easy<00:01:27.649> scores<00:01:28.069> for<00:01:28.280> his

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
the paint creates easy scores for his

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:30.520 
the paint creates easy scores for his
teammates<00:01:28.819> pretty<00:01:29.630> good<00:01:29.810> shooter<00:01:30.170> and<00:01:30.409> then

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
teammates pretty good shooter and then

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.559 
teammates pretty good shooter and then
he's<00:01:30.679> tenacious<00:01:31.250> on<00:01:31.610> the<00:01:31.759> ball<00:01:31.909> defender<00:01:32.360> so

00:01:32.559 --> 00:01:32.569 
he's tenacious on the ball defender so

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:34.359 
he's tenacious on the ball defender so
those<00:01:33.080> two<00:01:33.259> guys<00:01:33.409> have<00:01:33.679> probably<00:01:33.830> stood<00:01:34.250> out

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.369 
those two guys have probably stood out

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:36.669 
those two guys have probably stood out
the<00:01:34.490> most<00:01:34.520> for<00:01:34.909> me<00:01:35.000> but<00:01:35.179> everybody<00:01:36.110> in<00:01:36.530> their

00:01:36.669 --> 00:01:36.679 
the most for me but everybody in their

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:38.559 
the most for me but everybody in their
own<00:01:36.799> rights<00:01:37.009> made<00:01:37.220> an<00:01:37.340> impression<00:01:37.640> so<00:01:38.030> it's

00:01:38.559 --> 00:01:38.569 
own rights made an impression so it's

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:39.760 
own rights made an impression so it's
kind<00:01:38.720> of<00:01:38.750> hard<00:01:38.810> to<00:01:39.020> compare<00:01:39.319> them<00:01:39.500> but<00:01:39.649> those

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
kind of hard to compare them but those

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.800 
kind of hard to compare them but those
two<00:01:39.920> guys<00:01:40.069> right<00:01:40.310> now<00:01:40.369> I<00:01:41.209> think<00:01:41.690> it<00:01:41.780> really

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
two guys right now I think it really

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.100 
two guys right now I think it really
stood<00:01:42.080> out

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.410 

and<00:01:45.740> it's<00:01:45.950> it's<00:01:46.220> very<00:01:46.460> difficult<00:01:46.670> to<00:01:46.970> compare

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
and it's it's very difficult to compare

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.400 
and it's it's very difficult to compare
because<00:01:47.780> every<00:01:48.560> team<00:01:48.800> is<00:01:49.040> story<00:01:49.610> by<00:01:49.850> itself

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:50.410 
because every team is story by itself

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.740 
because every team is story by itself
it's<00:01:51.410> a<00:01:51.500> completely<00:01:51.860> different<00:01:52.070> thing<00:01:52.370> and

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
it's a completely different thing and

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.150 
it's a completely different thing and
you<00:01:53.750> know<00:01:53.810> we<00:01:54.230> were<00:01:54.350> talking<00:01:54.530> about<00:01:54.800> that<00:01:55.130> in

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.160 
you know we were talking about that in

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.900 
you know we were talking about that in
the<00:01:55.700> past<00:01:55.940> several<00:01:56.600> days<00:01:56.870> we<00:01:57.500> try<00:01:57.740> in<00:01:57.920> fact<00:01:58.160> to

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:58.910 
the past several days we try in fact to

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.600 
the past several days we try in fact to
find<00:01:59.180> what's<00:01:59.480> the<00:01:59.600> best<00:01:59.780> but<00:02:00.050> I<00:02:00.080> think

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
find what's the best but I think

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.580 
find what's the best but I think
comparing<00:02:01.610> with<00:02:01.790> the<00:02:02.000> other<00:02:02.390> ones<00:02:02.690> the

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
comparing with the other ones the

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.290 
comparing with the other ones the
chemistry<00:02:03.979> is<00:02:04.250> the<00:02:04.520> most<00:02:04.700> important<00:02:05.150> thing

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.300 
chemistry is the most important thing

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.290 
chemistry is the most important thing
and<00:02:05.740> to<00:02:06.740> build<00:02:06.890> the<00:02:07.040> relations<00:02:07.550> and<00:02:07.850> among

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
and to build the relations and among

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.100 
and to build the relations and among
each<00:02:08.479> other<00:02:08.860> going<00:02:09.860> back<00:02:10.130> in<00:02:10.729> the<00:02:10.940> past<00:02:11.180> we<00:02:12.080> can

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
each other going back in the past we can

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.360 
each other going back in the past we can
talk<00:02:12.530> that<00:02:13.400> we<00:02:13.670> were<00:02:14.540> like<00:02:14.930> let's<00:02:15.260> say<00:02:15.380> fifty

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
talk that we were like let's say fifty

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.430 
talk that we were like let's say fifty
percent<00:02:16.700> winning<00:02:17.270> in<00:02:17.450> last<00:02:17.660> four<00:02:17.900> games<00:02:18.080> and

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
percent winning in last four games and

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.580 
percent winning in last four games and
each<00:02:19.130> time<00:02:19.360> somebody<00:02:20.360> explode<00:02:20.959> in<00:02:21.320> the<00:02:21.350> most

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
each time somebody explode in the most

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.380 
each time somebody explode in the most
important<00:02:22.070> moment<00:02:22.400> I<00:02:22.520> think<00:02:22.610> that<00:02:23.000> that's<00:02:23.209> a

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
important moment I think that that's a

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.780 
important moment I think that that's a
quality<00:02:23.630> the<00:02:24.530> style<00:02:24.920> which<00:02:25.280> we<00:02:25.489> try<00:02:25.730> to

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
quality the style which we try to

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.720 
quality the style which we try to
represent<00:02:26.060> must<00:02:26.810> be<00:02:26.989> and<00:02:27.290> it<00:02:27.530> is<00:02:27.730> completely

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
represent must be and it is completely

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.370 
represent must be and it is completely
different<00:02:28.970> than<00:02:29.300> the<00:02:29.540> style<00:02:29.840> the<00:02:30.050> US

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
different than the style the US

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.460 
different than the style the US
basketball<00:02:30.590> is<00:02:31.040> so<00:02:31.900> there's<00:02:32.900> the<00:02:33.020> way<00:02:33.140> how<00:02:33.410> the

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
basketball is so there's the way how the

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.650 
basketball is so there's the way how the
rest<00:02:33.739> of<00:02:33.890> the<00:02:34.040> world<00:02:34.280> play<00:02:34.850> and<00:02:35.150> we<00:02:35.330> want<00:02:35.540> to

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
rest of the world play and we want to

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.980 
rest of the world play and we want to
represent<00:02:35.840> that<00:02:36.260> on<00:02:36.470> the<00:02:36.560> best<00:02:36.739> way

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.260 

you<00:02:40.500> know<00:02:40.590> I<00:02:40.620> mean<00:02:40.890> his<00:02:41.340> skill<00:02:41.580> set<00:02:41.610> continues

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
you know I mean his skill set continues

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:43.760 
you know I mean his skill set continues
to<00:02:42.420> improve<00:02:42.750> though<00:02:43.320> I<00:02:43.380> didn't<00:02:43.620> shoot<00:02:43.650> the

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
to improve though I didn't shoot the

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.680 
to improve though I didn't shoot the
ball<00:02:43.860> well<00:02:44.010> today<00:02:44.430> in<00:02:44.550> practice<00:02:44.730> you<00:02:45.480> know<00:02:45.570> his

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
ball well today in practice you know his

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.840 
ball well today in practice you know his
jump<00:02:45.930> shots<00:02:46.110> really<00:02:46.470> improved<00:02:46.860> his<00:02:47.160> ability

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
jump shots really improved his ability

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.360 
jump shots really improved his ability
to<00:02:47.910> finish<00:02:48.210> and<00:02:48.390> traffic's<00:02:48.870> improved<00:02:49.370> you

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
to finish and traffic's improved you

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.130 
to finish and traffic's improved you
know<00:02:50.460> he's<00:02:50.730> gotten<00:02:51.060> better<00:02:51.180> in<00:02:51.510> almost<00:02:51.780> every

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
know he's gotten better in almost every

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.570 
know he's gotten better in almost every
facet<00:02:52.410> of<00:02:52.650> the<00:02:52.800> game<00:02:52.830> and<00:02:53.220> that's<00:02:53.370> scary

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
facet of the game and that's scary

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.400 
facet of the game and that's scary
because<00:02:53.910> his<00:02:54.030> natural<00:02:54.420> talent<00:02:54.780> is<00:02:54.870> you<00:02:55.320> know

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
because his natural talent is you know

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.260 
because his natural talent is you know
that<00:02:55.590> that<00:02:55.770> freakish<00:02:56.430> athleticism<00:02:56.850> that<00:02:57.120> he

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
that that freakish athleticism that he

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.930 
that that freakish athleticism that he
have<00:02:57.390> is<00:02:57.510> still<00:02:58.080> there<00:02:58.350> so<00:02:59.130> you<00:02:59.520> know<00:02:59.610> I<00:02:59.640> I

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
have is still there so you know I I

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.430 
have is still there so you know I I
think<00:03:00.330> you<00:03:00.720> know<00:03:00.780> the<00:03:00.930> beautiful<00:03:01.140> thing<00:03:01.290> about

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
think you know the beautiful thing about

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.840 
think you know the beautiful thing about
Andrew<00:03:01.890> and<00:03:01.980> I<00:03:02.010> said<00:03:02.190> this<00:03:02.280> earlier<00:03:02.430> to

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
Andrew and I said this earlier to

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.700 
Andrew and I said this earlier to
someone<00:03:03.150> was<00:03:03.330> he's<00:03:03.780> such<00:03:03.930> a<00:03:03.960> selfless<00:03:04.350> star

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:04.710 
someone was he's such a selfless star

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:06.620 
someone was he's such a selfless star
and<00:03:04.950> I<00:03:05.160> think<00:03:05.640> today's<00:03:05.880> practice<00:03:06.150> said<00:03:06.540> it

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
and I think today's practice said it

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.390 
and I think today's practice said it
best<00:03:06.810> you<00:03:06.930> know<00:03:07.050> we<00:03:07.170> turn<00:03:07.680> over<00:03:07.710> with<00:03:08.100> a<00:03:08.130> chance

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
best you know we turn over with a chance

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.680 
best you know we turn over with a chance
to<00:03:08.460> win<00:03:08.580> it<00:03:08.700> down<00:03:08.820> the<00:03:08.940> stretch<00:03:09.270> instead<00:03:09.600> of

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
to win it down the stretch instead of

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:10.940 
to win it down the stretch instead of
making<00:03:09.930> the<00:03:10.020> play<00:03:10.170> himself<00:03:10.320> he<00:03:10.620> gives<00:03:10.800> it<00:03:10.920> to

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
making the play himself he gives it to

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.830 
making the play himself he gives it to
his<00:03:11.100> teammate<00:03:11.430> for<00:03:11.940> a<00:03:11.970> layup<00:03:12.150> to<00:03:12.330> win<00:03:12.360> the<00:03:12.630> to

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
his teammate for a layup to win the to

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.840 
his teammate for a layup to win the to
win<00:03:12.990> that<00:03:13.110> particular<00:03:13.740> scrimmage<00:03:14.130> and<00:03:14.490> that's

win that particular scrimmage and that's

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.400 
win that particular scrimmage and that's
Andrew<00:03:15.180> he<00:03:15.300> lets<00:03:15.480> the<00:03:15.570> game<00:03:15.720> come<00:03:15.930> to<00:03:15.960> himself

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
Andrew he lets the game come to himself

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.650 
Andrew he lets the game come to himself
you<00:03:17.130> know<00:03:17.160> he's<00:03:17.520> not<00:03:17.700> arrogant<00:03:18.030> he<00:03:18.390> doesn't

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
have this you know he doesn't need to be

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.310 
have this you know he doesn't need to be
the<00:03:20.550> man<00:03:20.760> but<00:03:20.820> when<00:03:21.150> the<00:03:21.240> time<00:03:21.450> arises<00:03:21.810> he<00:03:22.170> can

well<00:03:26.130> we<00:03:26.340> certainly<00:03:26.550> hope<00:03:26.790> so<00:03:26.970> that's<00:03:27.180> the

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
well we certainly hope so that's the

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:28.460 
well we certainly hope so that's the
goal<00:03:27.450> that's<00:03:27.690> why<00:03:27.810> we<00:03:27.960> come<00:03:28.080> here<00:03:28.230> and<00:03:28.320> do<00:03:28.440> it

goal that's why we come here and do it

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:29.870 
goal that's why we come here and do it
every<00:03:28.740> year<00:03:28.770> we're<00:03:29.070> not<00:03:29.220> here<00:03:29.370> to<00:03:29.400> lose<00:03:29.640> that's

every year we're not here to lose that's

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.180 
every year we're not here to lose that's
