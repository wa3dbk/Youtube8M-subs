00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.340
 by heart and world okay I 'm going 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:18.630
 very very good as we go we go 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.220
 everything and announces me builders food is 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.510
 a chrono plagron brahms with tomato 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.560
 onion today let's talk about 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.789
 wood and you'll see that it's not so 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.210
 pulled by the roots that's what 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.680
 good joke 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.939
 surprisingly i'm going to talk about erection 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.529
 why, because there is a 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.869
 month to bandage and drink is called the 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.920
 bandaged wood as if funny we use 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.149
 its bark that comes from an art 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.079
 mainly located in the Caribbean 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.940
 and south america 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.040
 scientifically it's called enriching ya 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.450
 grown this bark once macerated 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.579
 in brandy according to practice 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.980
 Martinique releases properties 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.239
 vasodilator and exciting so by 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.399
 extension it causes a beautiful 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.050
 erection he would even be active with 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.030
 women and provided intense outbreaks 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.980
 of desire however the consumption of the 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.989
 bandaged wood should be practiced with 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.510
 moderation to avoid problems 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.039
 such as priapism and frankly I 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.620
 advise against discovering what 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.850
 it is that priapism lahoud was said 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.710
 the largest tree is born from a seed 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.100
 menu let's talk now about the big 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.689
 trees 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.280
 the one I'm going to talk to you about is great 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.740
 very big he reaches more exactly 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.760
 a height of 115 meters high and stands 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.350
 located in California 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.000
 to give an idea it's about 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.840
 the height of the ground up to the second 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.759
 floor of the eiffel tower 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.220
 also talk about trees and rainy 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.780
 between 4000 and over 5000 years old we 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.280
 justify this gap of milan with 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.270
 Baptist because of the difficulty that 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.350
 we had to find the tree the 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.090
 older in our research 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.450
 however, whether to give a figure 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.490
 exact we would wish 4600 years alone 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.860
 score validated by an official body 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.240
 such as guinness book 'record' know 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.890
 that there are other trees more 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.750
 old but whose location is kept 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.880
 secret so protected from vandalism 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.049
 human then I would like to talk to you about 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.820
 wooden construction 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.409
 as incredible as it can 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.329
 to appear the wood is still enormously 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.159
 used in frame construction 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.020
 of houses in the united states this 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.369
 so-called American technique is 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.710
 appeared in the 19th century 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.719
 it's a healthy building fast and 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.340
 economic against in case of fire is worth 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.500
 better to provide a fire extinguisher or 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.770
 must know how to run very fast very very 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.360
 quick 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.700
 now let's take a little trip in 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.229
 the past 407 million years not 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.580
 less than that as far as these 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.229
 dates may appear researchers have 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.750
 yet found traces of wood in 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.580
 stems of fossilized plants 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.170
 it was a first since 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.210
 scientists were convinced that 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.740
 first traces of wood appeared 10 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.720
 millions of years later it's 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.550
 just huge 10 million it's ten 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.440
 times a million years or even 100 x 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.060
 100 thousand years worse it's a thousand times ten 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.860
 thousand years I would say even ten thousand times 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.090
 thousand years or 100 thousand times 100 years or 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.680
 a million times ten years which 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.930
 corresponds to 10 million is a year my 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.000
 guy kind ah no longer a year plus a year 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:40.250
 one year plus one more that either 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.480
 you are more and more numerous 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.620
 we watch you are more and more 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.450
 many to make us comments 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.310
 and especially especially you are more and 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.810
 more numerous to share with us and the 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.040
 sharing is what makes discover the 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.140
 chain to other people because 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.670
 we published after we read the 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.140
 comments are answered and then after 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.430
 you share yourself and suddenly there is 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.959
 new people who come and that 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.560
 it's so cool and it makes us very 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:58.820
 very pleasure 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.709
 we also do lots of little videos 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.450
 friendly on facebook we made 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.770
 holiday videos you see more like this 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.450
 so do not hesitate to like our page 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.940
 facebook on one of the logos that evoked 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.040
 then we will put with tracks and 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.360
 then from there to the next and 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.290
 especially do not forget green thumb at 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.220
 green thumb to you to do your 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.790
 comments
