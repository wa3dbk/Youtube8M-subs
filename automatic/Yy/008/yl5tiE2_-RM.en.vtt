00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:07.450
 Sun and sea 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:11.439
 two fantastic elements that are part of the postcard of Naples 

00:00:11.439 --> 00:00:15.329
 and no bad political or criminal management will be able to remove but this 

00:00:15.329 --> 00:00:18.689
 fantastic city loan items would almost be wanted 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:20.200
 throw themselves into the sea to vote 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.659
 but there is work to be done to understand how it works 

00:00:23.659 --> 00:00:25.510
 object this fantastic 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:31.619
 object created by honda dm 0 1 hernia perhaps stand for drive n ew between then 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.370
 we will try to understand during service where these initials come from de ver 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.330
 taal because there is the possibility of finishing this bike let's call it that 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.680
 infordat and then with a very simple gesture like this 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.150
 you insert drive and you go 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.020
 with the motorcycle scooter call it what you want 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.809
 that abdi has something to say to give strong emotions 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:55.979
 let's see how you are built first 

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:58.979
 this motorcycle and then we'll try it 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.420
 I have a bar defines the dm 0 1 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.820
 a takeaway cruiser equipped with an automatic gearshift indeed the bike to 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.350
 firmly resembles a future the future enriched by a frontal 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.350
 aggressive low and profiled front fairing after leaving single arm wax 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.670
 discovered the circle from the firmware design 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.550
 circle who makes a 19050 tire just as hot as the ones 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:43.810
 most extreme sports 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.759
 the saddle is very comfortable school immediately at the bottom and the footrests 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:48.760
 rather it advances 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.000
 at the front there are also phonic wheels and other typical piston calipers 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.100
 of the cbs adsl kezzmovie plant fitted as standard 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.730
 the twin cylinder hey engine dates 180 cubic centimeters 4 injection valves 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.520
 electronics given on hate villas and recently also adapted on the

 have lunch 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.080
 the power therefore does not differ much from the eagle of the villas 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.090
 transalp we speak of 60 horses absent 1,750 rpm 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.230
 villa power kilogram meter 5500 rpm 

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:22.940
 on the dm of 1 the engine is a little brighter 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.990
 even if the red zone is placed before that of the divine 7800 gt instead of 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.990
 8500 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:46.540
 h ft this is the acronym who went blinded found 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:47.840
 and its change 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.159
 the automatic transmission jack then 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:52.680
 allows us to use the dl 0 1 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.600
 humble automatic traffic mode 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:55.820
 in the big cities 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.370
 and then why not also choose the sequential mode because they are there 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.279
 6 reports well 

00:03:01.279 --> 00:03:05.309
 this change, however, does not have much to do with the automatic ones, so far from 

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:09.759
 other companies there are no pure jets but you are belts it is a change 

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:13.269
 volumetric hydraulic that ensures great performance especially in 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:14.239

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:19.230
 designed and built in the 1950s by an Italian Giovanni Ballarini used 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.279
 at the time on some American cars 

00:03:21.279 --> 00:03:25.159
 it has been picked up since he has been working on it for many years already

 we are the fool with the button 

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:46.979
 insert the march exibart 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.859
 getting on the tree and 0 1 is a bit like getting on a population fortune teller e 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:23.090
 very similar 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:27.370
 in fact for those who come from very different times they show they want us for ho 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.760
 a few hundred meters to understand how broken handlebar works and the whole 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.760
 rest 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:49.030
 full instrumentation there are all the data you need to control speed 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:50.900
 the digital glass bill 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.139
 mileage tachometer fuel senator hour what is missing is 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:58.979
 there was an alarm clock for the mattia temperature level 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:01.360
 if you need show doing mail 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.530
 the center of gravity and very low this really allows to hold the bike 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:10.220
 glued to the ground edipo terror exploit all the qualities of the frame as 

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:14.810
 this circumstance or this beautiful fold to the right really seems very reactive 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:18.659
 everything works perfectly well even mirko dub cycling 

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:23.409
 suspension the front fork is active the rear that works well 

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:26.409
 especially when it comes out of the cups 

00:05:37.809 --> 00:05:42.219
 therefore continues this new vein this new way of riding a motorcycle 

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:43.670
 automatic mode 

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:44.660
 consequential 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:47.240
 we hope to have some and well explained details

 elounda eddie vedder ukulele 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:52.090
 we stop not before having thanked the video of Naples that I have 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:52.719
 text 

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:55.689
 the bike under test area 101 and colors 

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:57.460
 which you will find we made real 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:00.990
 expedia caravaggio corner via manzoni I'll wait for the next tests
