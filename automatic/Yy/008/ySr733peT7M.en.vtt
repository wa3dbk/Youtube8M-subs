00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.270 
years and went through a draft process I
think<00:03:41.019> it's<00:03:41.170> also<00:03:41.290> about<00:03:41.530> where<00:03:41.920> you<00:03:42.100> get

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
think it's also about where you get

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.330 
think it's also about where you get
drafted<00:03:42.549> and<00:03:43.350> obviously<00:03:44.350> the<00:03:44.590> Celtics<00:03:45.100> are

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
drafted and obviously the Celtics are

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.030 
drafted and obviously the Celtics are
very<00:03:45.790> respectful<00:03:46.660> organization<00:03:47.500> and<00:03:47.829> now

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
very respectful organization and now

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.729 
very respectful organization and now
with<00:03:48.220> Brad's<00:03:48.489> leadership<00:03:49.230> to<00:03:50.230> have<00:03:50.380> any<00:03:50.590> of
