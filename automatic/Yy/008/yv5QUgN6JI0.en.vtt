 I have a story to tell. 

00:00:04.737 --> 00:00:08.808 line:0%
 I lived a long time in Porto Alegre, right? 

00:00:08.841 --> 00:00:13.846 line:0%
 In Bairro Menino Deus, at Rua Gonçalves Dias ... 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:16.315 line:0%
 At Marcílio Dias Street, which was the side street, 

00:00:16.348 --> 00:00:18.885  line:0%
 had a dog. 

00:00:18.918 --> 00:00:21.254  line:0%
 But it was not a dog. 

00:00:21.287 --> 00:00:23.956 size:84% position:42% line:0%
 It was a fucking mammoth. 

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:26.626 size:84% position:42% line:0%
 The bastard was gigantic. 

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:28.661  line:0%
 It was too big. 

00:00:28.694 --> 00:00:30.763 line:0%
 And it's not because I was a child at the time I thought 

00:00:30.796 --> 00:00:33.266 line:0%
 that he was great, he lost ... he had no reference. 

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:36.736 line:0%
 No, no, I was an adult now, and he was very big. 

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:38.237 line:0%
 He looked like a bear, you know? 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.474 line:0%
 It was ... It had a thick bark. 

00:00:41.507 --> 00:00:44.477 line:0%
 He did not bark, he basically played the whorehouse 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.045 line:0%
 in the neighborhood, you know? 

00:00:46.078 --> 00:00:49.348 line:0%
 It was a ... [Laughing] It was a ... [Laughing] 

00:00:49.381 --> 00:00:53.052 line:0%
 It looked like an obese cough, you know? 

00:00:53.085 --> 00:00:54.487  line:0%
 [Laughing] 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.925 line:0%
 Latia and the children woke up ... 

00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:02.428 line:0%
 The other neighborhood was afraid of the dog, it was a disgrace. 

00:01:02.461 --> 00:01:04.464 line:0%
 It was the point of reference. 

00:01:04.497 --> 00:01:05.765 size:81% position:41% line:0%
 People looked like this: 

00:01:05.798 --> 00:01:08.000 line:0%
 "We'll be right there near the dog motherfucker." 

00:01:08.033 --> 00:01:11.337  line:0%
 It was more or less. 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.041 line:0%
 One day my mother was passing in front of the house 

00:01:15.074 --> 00:01:19.412 line:0%
 the bastard, the dog bastard, 

00:01:19.445 --> 00:01:22.281  line:0%
 the gate was open. 

00:01:22.314 --> 00:01:24.617  line:0%
 The dog fired, man. 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.753  line:0%
 He went to my mother. 

00:01:27.786 --> 00:01:31.724 line:0%
 It was after my mother, my careless mother, 

00:01:31.757 --> 00:01:34.694  line:0%
 the dog! "he bit out. 

00:01:34.727 --> 00:01:36.829  line:0%
 My mother's heel. 

00:01:36.862 --> 00:01:39.499 line:0%
 If you're dumb, I'll explain: 

00:01:39.532 --> 00:01:45.271 line:0%
 the heel is this here. That part of the foot, okay? 

00:01:45.304 --> 00:01:47.673 line:0%
 He almost ripped off my mother's heel. 

00:01:47.706 --> 00:01:48.908 line:0%
 My mother, poor thing, even said: 

00:01:48.941 --> 00:01:51.244 line:0%
 "I'll be forced to walk in high heels for the rest of my life." 

00:01:51.277 --> 00:01:53.079  line:0%
 Almost started, man. 

00:01:53.112 --> 00:01:54.480  line:0%
 He stabbed his teeth. 

00:01:54.513 --> 00:01:58.117 line:0%
 After infecting, my mother had to scrape the skin. 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.019 size:78% position:39% line:0%
 It was a disgrace, man. 

00:02:00.052 --> 00:02:03.556 line:0%
 I remember days, days, and days, people with my mother 

00:02:03.589 --> 00:02:06.092 line:0%
 with the leg there with a band 

00:02:06.125 --> 00:02:08.227 line:0%
 and we thought my mother was going to lose her foot, you know? 

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:15.535 line:0%
 For months ... months I do not say, but almost a month, like this. 

00:02:15.568 --> 00:02:21.474 line:0%
 One day I went ... I was passing by the Marcílio Dias Street, 

00:02:21.507 --> 00:02:22.775  line:0%
 the gate was open. 

00:02:22.808 --> 00:02:25.411 line:0%
 About fifteen days after the deal happened. 

00:02:25.444 --> 00:02:26.445  line:0%
 Fifteen days. 

00:02:26.478 --> 00:02:27.947 line:0%
 My mother was still recovering. 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.282  line:0%
 Open gate. 

00:02:29.315 --> 00:02:32.885 line:0%
 Then I got pissed, man. Puto! 

00:02:32.918 --> 00:02:37.790 line:0%
 But fuckin 'like I could chew steel, you know? 

00:02:37.823 --> 00:02:41.127 size:88% position:44% line:0%
 Eat iron so fucking I was. 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.664 line:0%
 The guys had left the fucking open gate again. 

00:02:44.697 --> 00:02:49.468 line:0%
 And the couple, such as a couple who owned the house, were in the front. 

00:02:49.501 --> 00:02:53.539 line:0%
 In front of the house ... But I cursed them, man. 

00:02:53.572 --> 00:03:00.513 line:0%
 I cursed with swearing I did not even know existed. 

00:03:00.546 --> 00:03:02.648 line:0%
 I said curse words from that moment on 

00:03:02.681 --> 00:03:06.385 line:0%
 entered the dictionary, because I got pissed, but fucking! 

00:03:06.418 --> 00:03:08.020  line:0%
 I cursed the guys: 

00:03:08.053 --> 00:03:10.556 line:0%
 "You're a bunch of motherfucker, 

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:12.892 line:0%
 that's what you are, you bastards! 

00:03:12.925 --> 00:03:15.394 line:0%
 Leave the shit out of this open gate. 

00:03:15.427 --> 00:03:17.563 size:81% position:41% line:0%
 to ruin everyone's life? 

00:03:17.596 --> 00:03:19.165 line:0%
 Are you crazy, by any chance? 

00:03:19.198 --> 00:03:21.167 line:0%
 Do not you know the problem with that shit? 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.636 line:0%
 Already gave problem, fucked with the life of my mother 

00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:26.372 line:0%
 This fucking open gate! You guys are idiots, is that it? 

00:03:26.405 --> 00:03:28.174 line:0%
 You guys are idiots, is that it? 

00:03:28.207 --> 00:03:30.643 line:0%
 The next time I see this gate open, 

00:03:30.676 --> 00:03:33.913 line:0%
 I'm going inside this house, I'm going to beat you both, 

00:03:33.946 --> 00:03:36.515 line:0%
 and if I have a son, I will beat your sons ... 

00:03:36.548 --> 00:03:39.952 line:0%
 I do not even want to know. " 

00:03:39.985 --> 00:03:43.623 line:0%
 Then I turned my back, I got mad, you know that thing? 

00:03:43.656 --> 00:03:47.260 line:0%
 Jugular jumping out of anger. 

00:03:47.293 --> 00:03:50.229 line:0%
 I walked another ten yards, still breathing, 

00:03:50.262 --> 00:03:53.466 line:0%
 I still had a guy on the bench I knew. 

00:03:53.499 --> 00:03:55.434 line:0%
 The bank guy said, "Is everything okay, Mr. Rafael?" 

00:03:55.467 --> 00:03:57.470  line:0%
 I say, "Alright." 

00:03:57.503 --> 00:03:58.671  line:0%
 "So, did you know? 

00:03:58.704 --> 00:04:02.241 line:0%
 The people there of the dog that bit your mother moved. " 

00:04:09.048 --> 00:04:12.418  line:0%
 I do not... 

00:04:12.451 --> 00:04:14.754 line:0%
 When I cursed, I did not talk about dogs, 

00:04:14.787 --> 00:04:19.792 line:0%
 and the staff was very scared, and ... 

00:04:19.825 --> 00:04:24.563 line:0%
 Well, moral of the story ... 

00:04:27.499 --> 00:04:30.970 line:0%
 I have already said this morality once, but I will repeat: 

00:04:31.003 --> 00:04:33.773 line:0%
 "Do not call people stupid, 

00:04:33.806 --> 00:04:35.741  line:0%
 because, in the end, 

00:04:35.774 --> 00:04:38.477 size:78% position:39% line:0%
 the idiot can be you ".
