00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 the best product line in the world of 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.430
 cars and motorsport is 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.430
 meeting in one place 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.240
 www.autopistafernao.com.br 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.830
 technology has been changing the 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.110
 our cars and more and more we have 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.240
 electronic controls assuming those 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:30.340
 commands that were traditionally 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.990
 driver exclusivity 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.350
 on the other hand we started to experiment 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:37.270
 also those situations that previously only 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.180
 were unimaginable in those movies 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:42.820
 futurists if you still doubt it 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.800
 pay attention on this car here volvo 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.230
 see 40 that is coming to Brazil in this 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.129
 month and that is a good example that 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.500
 I'm speaking 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:53.049
 volvo ver 40 is the most important 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.449
 launch of the Swedish brand of the last 

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:57.909
 times and has already brought important 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:59.290
 from its presentation at the beginning 

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:02.409
 2012 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.390
 ov 40 as stated by the executives is 

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:07.360
 considered a watershed in the 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.159
 brand history and for many reasons 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.619
 see that his drawing has the 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:14.200
 characteristics of volvo models more 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:16.360
 here is everything more provocative the side 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:20.080
 for example brings inspiration to the 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:22.270
 classic of the brand volvo p1800 all 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.700
 aligned with the condition here for whom 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.530
 directs you to take another 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:38.260
 positive of this car 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:40.720
 the mechanical assembly in Brazil sees 40 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:43.960
 arrives with a single engine version is the 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:47.140
 2.0 d 4d Dynamic is a five cylinder 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:50.409
 with turbo and turns 180 horsepower 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.360
 power and 30.6 pounds of torque 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:53.380
 the transmission is automatic for six 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.020
 speeds 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.540
 the result are responses close to one 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.300
 race car but do not think that by 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:03.990
 that the v 40 an uncomfortable car to 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.990
 a walk 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.390
 But when the conversation turns to 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:17.030
 technology the v 40 list is great and the 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.240
 highlight is safety here 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.490
 the main innovation is the air bag for 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.440
 pedestrians per hour an exclusivity of the 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:27.140
 brand it works like this 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.870
 sensors identify pedestrians ahead 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.690
 in case of collision, the bonnet cover and 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.210
 slightly open and the airbag opens 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:38.770
 on the engine to reduce the impact of 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.770
 pedestrian against the car 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.940
 but still in depth on the issue of 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.920
 security system has an ac system that 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.709
 people in that situation where the car 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.989
 almost does it all alone is the city ​​I know 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:57.209
 it is mainly used for traffic 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:58.920
 heavy slow of a big city 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.480
 I can by means of buttons here 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.310
 determine the speed I want 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.569
 walking and the distance I want to keep 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.190
 in the front vehicle 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:07.080
 Our team car is here at 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.989
 front and I determined a speed 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:12.420
 maximum of 60 km per hour and at a distance 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.519
 the front of the car then see that 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.950
 it maintains the speed according to the 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:20.580
 speeding up and braking if the car 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:24.870
 the front for him to also 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:27.450
 the driver does nothing and has more 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.940
 the road site information is the system that 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.430
 it the speed cards and that other 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.470
 very interesting comes into play when 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:37.020
 the driver becomes distracted from the 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:45.570
 trajectory the steering wheel hardens a bit and 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:47.910
 trepidation forcing correction equipment 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:50.760
 and are all available 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.770
 to see 40 sold in brazil that will 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.470
 to dispute space with the new mercedes 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:59.960
 class that also with a bmw series 1 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.960
 to name a few direct competitors 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:11.610
 volvo see 40 as we saw there does not have to 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:14.490
 discuss a car with a lot of intelligence 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:16.380
 very well served by technology and 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:17.310
 especially of resources focused on the 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.500
 safety 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.299
 It is certain that the price of it still leaves 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.670
 away from the largest share of consumers 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:25.770
 here in Brazil but it is a positive point 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:27.990
 you know that a car as advanced as 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:31.790
 this is already present in our streets and 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.790
 not just in those futuristic films 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:39.270
 the best product line in the world of 

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:42.380
 cars and motorsport is 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.380
 meeting in one place 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.190
