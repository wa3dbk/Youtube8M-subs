00:01:25.889 --> 00:01:25.899 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:28.950 

we<00:01:26.530> now<00:01:26.799> have<00:01:27.070> to<00:01:27.189> introduce<00:01:27.670> this<00:01:27.850> idea<00:01:28.329> that

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
we now have to introduce this idea that

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.620 
we now have to introduce this idea that
the<00:01:29.170> thumb<00:01:29.469> is<00:01:29.740> doing<00:01:30.250> one<00:01:30.579> thing<00:01:30.969> while<00:01:31.509> the

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
the thumb is doing one thing while the

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.510 
the thumb is doing one thing while the
fingers<00:01:31.960> are<00:01:32.170> doing<00:01:32.259> another<00:01:32.619> best<00:01:33.159> way<00:01:33.280> to<00:01:33.310> do

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
fingers are doing another best way to do

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.039 
fingers are doing another best way to do
that<00:01:33.729> let's<00:01:34.030> forget<00:01:34.299> about<00:01:34.359> the<00:01:34.569> fingers<00:01:34.899> for

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:35.049 
that let's forget about the fingers for

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:37.889 
that let's forget about the fingers for
a<00:01:35.109> moment<00:01:35.409> thumb<00:01:35.920> you're<00:01:36.460> on<00:01:36.670> and<00:01:37.060> what<00:01:37.090> you're

a moment thumb you're on and what you're

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:40.200 
a moment thumb you're on and what you're
gonna<00:01:38.020> be<00:01:38.229> doing<00:01:38.590> with<00:01:39.009> this<00:01:39.250> Ecore<00:01:39.789> which<00:01:40.060> my

not touching and it's also and the

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:03.630 
not touching and it's also and the
fingers<00:02:01.509> are<00:02:01.720> not<00:02:02.250> actually<00:02:03.250> touching<00:02:03.399> the

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
fingers are not actually touching the

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:04.080 
fingers are not actually touching the
pickguard

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
pickguard

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.789 
pickguard
they<00:02:04.329> can<00:02:04.630> there's<00:02:05.079> a<00:02:05.140> lot<00:02:05.349> of<00:02:05.439> people<00:02:05.709> who

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:05.799 
they can there's a lot of people who

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:09.029 
they can there's a lot of people who
play<00:02:06.009> that<00:02:06.310> way<00:02:06.549> and<00:02:07.530> eventually<00:02:08.530> we're<00:02:08.920> going

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
play that way and eventually we're going

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:10.350 
play that way and eventually we're going
to<00:02:09.099> be<00:02:09.160> doing<00:02:09.399> something<00:02:09.700> fairly<00:02:10.000> different

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
to be doing something fairly different

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.470 
to be doing something fairly different
with<00:02:11.110> the<00:02:11.230> heel<00:02:11.590> of<00:02:12.160> our<00:02:12.430> hand<00:02:12.730> I'll<00:02:13.239> just

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
with the heel of our hand I'll just

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.330 
with the heel of our hand I'll just
introduce<00:02:13.629> the<00:02:14.049> idea<00:02:14.319> right<00:02:14.560> now<00:02:14.590> briefly<00:02:15.069> but

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
introduce the idea right now briefly but

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.819 
introduce the idea right now briefly but
we're<00:02:15.489> gonna<00:02:15.579> see<00:02:15.849> it<00:02:15.940> more<00:02:16.269> in<00:02:16.390> a<00:02:16.450> minute

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:16.829 
we're gonna see it more in a minute

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:20.369 
we're gonna see it more in a minute
eventually<00:02:17.829> if<00:02:17.950> we<00:02:18.010> want<00:02:18.340> the<00:02:18.489> muting<00:02:19.379> that

00:02:20.369 --> 00:02:20.379 
eventually if we want the muting that

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:22.319 
eventually if we want the muting that
really<00:02:20.709> accompanies<00:02:21.310> Travis<00:02:21.819> pic<00:02:22.030> style

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:22.329 
really accompanies Travis pic style

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:24.780 
really accompanies Travis pic style
eventually<00:02:23.170> our<00:02:23.590> whole<00:02:23.860> hand<00:02:24.250> shape<00:02:24.519> is<00:02:24.670> going

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
eventually our whole hand shape is going

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.369 
eventually our whole hand shape is going
to<00:02:24.849> have<00:02:25.030> to<00:02:25.150> be<00:02:25.269> different<00:02:25.690> in<00:02:26.019> order<00:02:26.140> to

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:26.379 
to have to be different in order to

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:29.190 
to have to be different in order to
accommodate<00:02:26.650> this<00:02:27.069> muting<00:02:27.519> the<00:02:28.019> fact<00:02:29.019> of<00:02:29.140> the

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
accommodate this muting the fact of the

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.050 
accommodate this muting the fact of the
matter<00:02:29.230> is<00:02:29.440> that<00:02:29.739> feels<00:02:30.160> very<00:02:30.250> awkward<00:02:30.730> at

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
matter is that feels very awkward at

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.759 
matter is that feels very awkward at
first<00:02:31.090> and<00:02:31.600> I<00:02:31.660> don't<00:02:31.870> suggest<00:02:32.049> we<00:02:32.410> start<00:02:32.680> with

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
first and I don't suggest we start with

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:34.470 
first and I don't suggest we start with
that<00:02:33.040> but<00:02:33.489> that's<00:02:33.700> where<00:02:33.880> we<00:02:34.030> would<00:02:34.150> like<00:02:34.329> to

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
that but that's where we would like to

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.270 
that but that's where we would like to
head<00:02:34.660> eventually<00:02:36.569> so<00:02:37.569> the<00:02:38.440> thumb<00:02:38.709> goes<00:02:38.920> six

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
head eventually so the thumb goes six

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.170 
head eventually so the thumb goes six
four<00:02:39.639> five<00:02:40.420> four<00:02:41.160> of<00:02:42.160> course<00:02:42.340> that's<00:02:42.579> only<00:02:42.790> for

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
four five four of course that's only for

four five four of course that's only for
the<00:02:43.239> eight<00:02:43.389> that<00:02:43.660> ecord<00:02:44.170> for<00:02:44.739> the<00:02:44.799> a<00:02:44.829> seventh

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
the eight that ecord for the a seventh

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:46.830 
the eight that ecord for the a seventh
there's<00:02:45.880> a<00:02:45.970> slightly<00:02:46.239> different<00:02:46.480> pattern

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
there's a slightly different pattern

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.530 
there's a slightly different pattern

may seem the same the difference of

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
if you wonder why helps remember that

this is an a note we're in turn a
seventh<00:03:00.700> chord<00:03:00.880> a<00:03:01.150> minute<00:03:01.720> ago<00:03:01.930> we<00:03:02.620> started<00:03:02.950> on

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:03.099 
seventh chord a minute ago we started on

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:06.089 
seventh chord a minute ago we started on
the<00:03:03.190> e<00:03:03.220> note<00:03:03.609> we<00:03:04.389> were<00:03:04.510> in<00:03:04.720> an<00:03:04.840> E<00:03:05.079> chord<00:03:05.349> in

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:06.099 
the e note we were in an E chord in

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:07.110 
the e note we were in an E chord in
other<00:03:06.280> words<00:03:06.459> we're<00:03:06.549> gonna<00:03:06.639> start<00:03:06.940> on<00:03:07.030> the

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
other words we're gonna start on the

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.599 
other words we're gonna start on the
root<00:03:07.359> every<00:03:07.810> time<00:03:08.049> and<00:03:08.349> that's<00:03:08.980> a<00:03:09.220> pretty<00:03:09.489> good

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:09.609 
root every time and that's a pretty good

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:13.319 
root every time and that's a pretty good
rule<00:03:10.120> of<00:03:10.450> thumb<00:03:10.720> haha<00:03:11.440> good<00:03:11.739> pun<00:03:12.040> for<00:03:12.940> all<00:03:13.150> of

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:13.329 
rule of thumb haha good pun for all of

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:16.379 
rule of thumb haha good pun for all of
these<00:03:13.450> chords<00:03:14.220> so<00:03:15.220> thumb<00:03:15.669> you've<00:03:15.849> got<00:03:16.000> two<00:03:16.209> out

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:16.389 
these chords so thumb you've got two out

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:17.729 
these chords so thumb you've got two out
of<00:03:16.419> the<00:03:16.569> three<00:03:16.599> little<00:03:17.019> assignments<00:03:17.620> you<00:03:17.709> need

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
of the three little assignments you need

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:23.540 
of the three little assignments you need
but<00:03:18.639> B<00:03:18.880> seventh<00:03:19.359> is<00:03:19.540> the<00:03:19.989> third

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.870 

it's<00:03:24.550> going<00:03:24.960> 5/4<00:03:25.960> 6/4<00:03:26.890> so<00:03:27.160> in<00:03:27.280> this<00:03:27.370> sense<00:03:27.670> it's

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
it's going 5/4 6/4 so in this sense it's

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.300 
it's going 5/4 6/4 so in this sense it's
just<00:03:28.360> like<00:03:28.510> what<00:03:28.690> we<00:03:28.780> did<00:03:28.810> with<00:03:29.170> the<00:03:29.350> a<00:03:29.530> as<00:03:30.100> far

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
just like what we did with the a as far

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.160 
just like what we did with the a as far
as<00:03:30.520> far<00:03:30.790> as<00:03:30.910> the<00:03:31.060> right<00:03:31.360> hand<00:03:31.600> and<00:03:31.750> thumb<00:03:31.990> is

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
as far as the right hand and thumb is

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:33.870 
as far as the right hand and thumb is
concerned<00:03:32.530> it's<00:03:32.920> exactly<00:03:33.340> the<00:03:33.490> same<00:03:33.610> as<00:03:33.730> what

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
concerned it's exactly the same as what

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.820 
concerned it's exactly the same as what
we<00:03:33.970> did<00:03:34.000> the<00:03:34.270> 1/7<00:03:34.810> a<00:03:34.960> difference<00:03:35.470> of<00:03:35.590> course<00:03:35.710> is

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
we did the 1/7 a difference of course is

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.240 
we did the 1/7 a difference of course is
if<00:03:36.070> you<00:03:36.160> remember<00:03:36.660> our<00:03:37.660> left<00:03:38.050> hand<00:03:38.350> was

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
if you remember our left hand was

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.840 
if you remember our left hand was
alternating<00:03:40.180> that<00:03:40.330> base<00:03:41.310> so<00:03:42.310> the<00:03:42.460> left<00:03:42.640> hand

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
alternating that base so the left hand

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.960 
alternating that base so the left hand
is<00:03:43.000> actually<00:03:43.300> part<00:03:43.600> of<00:03:43.720> this<00:03:43.840> thing<00:03:44.110> to<00:03:44.970> any

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
is actually part of this thing to any

00:03:45.970 --> 00:04:05.640 
is actually part of this thing to any
rate<00:03:46.240> here

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.380 

their<00:04:06.650> thumb<00:04:07.130> is<00:04:07.400> your<00:04:07.760> job

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
their thumb is your job

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.070 
their thumb is your job
it<00:04:08.930> basically<00:04:09.140> is<00:04:10.030> no<00:04:11.030> more<00:04:11.300> complicated<00:04:11.990> than

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.080 
it basically is no more complicated than

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.310 
it basically is no more complicated than
that

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:12.320 
that

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.490 
that
and<00:04:12.530> that<00:04:13.490> can<00:04:13.760> be<00:04:13.880> done<00:04:14.030> fairly<00:04:14.330> easily<00:04:14.500> in

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
and that can be done fairly easily in

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:16.990 
and that can be done fairly easily in
fact<00:04:15.800> this<00:04:15.950> whole<00:04:16.130> thing<00:04:16.340> would<00:04:16.489> be<00:04:16.610> easy<00:04:16.760> if

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
fact this whole thing would be easy if

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.210 
fact this whole thing would be easy if
there<00:04:17.299> was<00:04:17.450> no<00:04:17.600> fingers<00:04:18.019> involved<00:04:18.620> but<00:04:19.070> there

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
there was no fingers involved but there

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:32.080 
there was no fingers involved but there
are<00:04:19.370> so<00:04:22.000> while<00:04:23.000> that's<00:04:23.300> going<00:04:23.720> on<00:04:30.940> you<00:04:31.940> may

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
are so while that's going on you may

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:37.210 
are so while that's going on you may
notice<00:04:32.510> that<00:04:34.390> this<00:04:35.390> first<00:04:35.780> note<00:04:36.620> that<00:04:36.890> we<00:04:36.980> hit

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
notice that this first note that we hit

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.790 
notice that this first note that we hit
as<00:04:37.340> a<00:04:37.370> melody<00:04:37.880> note<00:04:38.060> is<00:04:38.300> timed<00:04:38.960> right<00:04:39.410> along

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
as a melody note is timed right along

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.080 
as a melody note is timed right along
with<00:04:39.950> the<00:04:40.040> thumb<00:04:40.310> another<00:04:40.700> way<00:04:40.850> of<00:04:40.940> saying

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
with the thumb another way of saying

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.150 
with the thumb another way of saying
that<00:04:41.300> is<00:04:41.420> it's<00:04:41.690> an<00:04:41.870> on<00:04:42.020> beat<00:04:42.320> it's<00:04:42.710> literally

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
that is it's an on beat it's literally

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:48.310 
that is it's an on beat it's literally
the<00:04:43.220> to<00:04:43.460> beat<00:04:43.700> one<00:04:44.180> two<00:04:45.700> one<00:04:46.700> two<00:04:47.120> three<00:04:47.690> four

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 
the to beat one two one two three four

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.650 
the to beat one two one two three four
so<00:04:49.040> you<00:04:49.100> really<00:04:49.370> can<00:04:49.580> locally<00:04:50.240> you<00:04:50.300> can<00:04:50.450> say

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:50.660 
so you really can locally you can say

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.240 
so you really can locally you can say
that<00:04:50.840> there<00:04:50.990> are<00:04:51.080> four<00:04:51.290> beats

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
that there are four beats

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:56.150 
that there are four beats
per<00:04:53.880> measure<00:04:54.090> that<00:04:54.750> the<00:04:54.960> thumbs<00:04:55.200> doing<00:04:55.620> and<00:04:55.770> we

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
per measure that the thumbs doing and we

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.670 
per measure that the thumbs doing and we
can<00:04:56.310> then<00:04:56.460> number<00:04:56.850> them<00:04:57.030> 1<00:04:57.240> 2<00:04:57.630> 3<00:04:57.960> 4<00:04:58.410> and<00:04:58.650> then

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
can then number them 1 2 3 4 and then

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:04.990 
can then number them 1 2 3 4 and then
say<00:04:59.130> you<00:05:00.060> are<00:05:00.390> hitting<00:05:00.810> with<00:05:00.960> the<00:05:01.110> second<00:05:01.500> beat

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.510 

that's<00:05:06.000> half<00:05:06.330> of<00:05:06.510> the<00:05:06.660> pattern<00:05:07.050> right<00:05:07.230> there

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 
that's half of the pattern right there

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.750 
that's half of the pattern right there
the<00:05:08.520> other<00:05:08.700> half<00:05:08.970> is<00:05:09.210> working<00:05:09.630> in<00:05:10.310> the<00:05:11.310> second

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:11.760 
the other half is working in the second

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:16.090 
the other half is working in the second
string

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:16.100 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:17.980 

now<00:05:16.700> I'm<00:05:16.790> gonna<00:05:16.910> interrupt<00:05:17.210> myself<00:05:17.540> for<00:05:17.960> a

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.990 
now I'm gonna interrupt myself for a

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:21.160 
now I'm gonna interrupt myself for a
second<00:05:18.410> to<00:05:18.830> talk<00:05:19.040> about<00:05:19.280> to<00:05:20.150> raise<00:05:20.510> a<00:05:20.540> question

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:21.170 
second to talk about to raise a question

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:23.500 
second to talk about to raise a question
what<00:05:21.710> finger<00:05:21.920> you're<00:05:22.190> supposed<00:05:22.460> to<00:05:22.550> use<00:05:22.820> there

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:23.510 
what finger you're supposed to use there

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:25.470 
what finger you're supposed to use there
really<00:05:23.720> is<00:05:23.960> no<00:05:24.200> right<00:05:24.530> answer<00:05:24.770> for<00:05:24.950> that<00:05:25.160> and

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:25.480 
really is no right answer for that and

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.430 
really is no right answer for that and
therefore<00:05:26.480> I'm<00:05:26.660> not<00:05:26.690> going<00:05:26.810> to<00:05:26.960> dwell<00:05:27.050> too

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 
therefore I'm not going to dwell too

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.150 
therefore I'm not going to dwell too
much<00:05:27.470> on<00:05:27.730> what<00:05:29.290> this<00:05:30.290> person<00:05:30.710> does<00:05:30.890> what<00:05:31.130> that

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:31.160 
much on what this person does what that

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.880 
much on what this person does what that
person<00:05:31.730> does<00:05:31.910> there<00:05:32.510> are<00:05:32.720> tons<00:05:33.200> of<00:05:33.470> ways<00:05:33.650> of

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:33.890 
person does there are tons of ways of

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:36.220 
person does there are tons of ways of
doing<00:05:34.010> that<00:05:34.280> and<00:05:34.340> as<00:05:34.820> you<00:05:34.970> can<00:05:35.150> see<00:05:35.450> there's<00:05:36.110> no

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:36.230 
doing that and as you can see there's no

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:38.020 
doing that and as you can see there's no
reason<00:05:36.560> why<00:05:36.650> you<00:05:36.710> can't<00:05:37.040> use<00:05:37.130> one<00:05:37.490> finger<00:05:37.730> for

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:38.030 
reason why you can't use one finger for

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:42.340 
reason why you can't use one finger for
everything<00:05:40.540> that's<00:05:41.540> perfectly<00:05:42.170> acceptable

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:42.350 
everything that's perfectly acceptable

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:44.620 
everything that's perfectly acceptable
and<00:05:43.100> in<00:05:43.190> fact<00:05:43.430> Reverend<00:05:43.850> Gary<00:05:44.000> Davis<00:05:44.120> plays

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:44.630 
and in fact Reverend Gary Davis plays

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:46.990 
and in fact Reverend Gary Davis plays
that<00:05:44.930> way<00:05:45.110> there's<00:05:46.100> really<00:05:46.280> no<00:05:46.550> reason<00:05:46.700> why

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.000 
that way there's really no reason why

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.790 
that way there's really no reason why
you<00:05:47.060> need<00:05:47.420> any<00:05:47.660> more<00:05:47.930> than<00:05:48.110> one<00:05:48.260> finger<00:05:48.590> for

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:48.800 
you need any more than one finger for

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.520 
you need any more than one finger for
this<00:05:48.950> but<00:05:49.450> it<00:05:50.450> would<00:05:50.570> be<00:05:50.660> very<00:05:50.930> very<00:05:51.140> nice<00:05:51.350> to

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:51.530 
this but it would be very very nice to

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:53.170 
this but it would be very very nice to
have<00:05:51.650> more<00:05:51.860> than<00:05:51.950> one<00:05:52.100> finger<00:05:52.340> eventually<00:05:53.000> and

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:53.180 
have more than one finger eventually and

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:56.620 
have more than one finger eventually and
in<00:05:53.870> fact<00:05:54.220> cutting<00:05:55.220> to<00:05:55.340> the<00:05:55.370> chase<00:05:55.460> I<00:05:55.940> play<00:05:56.480> with

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:56.630 
in fact cutting to the chase I play with

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:59.530 
in fact cutting to the chase I play with
three<00:05:56.900> fingers<00:05:57.320> I<00:05:57.530> play<00:05:58.130> somewhat<00:05:59.090> similar<00:05:59.480> to

00:05:59.530 --> 00:05:59.540 
three fingers I play somewhat similar to

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:01.480 
three fingers I play somewhat similar to
what<00:05:59.690> a<00:05:59.810> classical<00:06:00.290> trained<00:06:01.010> player<00:06:01.280> although

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:01.490 
what a classical trained player although

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:04.510 
what a classical trained player although
that's<00:06:01.790> hardly<00:06:02.060> me<00:06:02.300> might<00:06:03.200> do<00:06:03.470> I<00:06:03.710> assign<00:06:04.220> my

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:04.520 
that's hardly me might do I assign my

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.120 
that's hardly me might do I assign my
index<00:06:05.120> finger<00:06:05.480> often<00:06:06.140> not<00:06:06.350> always<00:06:06.590> but<00:06:06.770> often

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:07.130 
index finger often not always but often

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:10.390 
index finger often not always but often
to<00:06:07.640> the<00:06:07.730> third<00:06:07.940> string<00:06:08.240> I<00:06:08.570> assign<00:06:09.530> my<00:06:09.770> middle

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:10.400 
to the third string I assign my middle

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.990 
to the third string I assign my middle
finger<00:06:10.730> to<00:06:11.300> the<00:06:11.330> second<00:06:11.780> string<00:06:12.050> and<00:06:12.490> my<00:06:13.490> ring

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:14.000 
finger to the second string and my ring

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.210 
finger to the second string and my ring
finger<00:06:14.330> to<00:06:14.360> the<00:06:14.510> first<00:06:14.750> string<00:06:15.020> so<00:06:15.560> this

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:16.220 
finger to the first string so this

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:17.800 
finger to the first string so this
pattern<00:06:16.640> doesn't<00:06:16.940> use<00:06:17.030> any<00:06:17.210> third<00:06:17.450> string<00:06:17.720> at

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:17.810 
pattern doesn't use any third string at

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:19.450 
pattern doesn't use any third string at
all<00:06:17.960> and<00:06:18.200> so<00:06:18.470> index<00:06:18.860> you're<00:06:19.160> kind<00:06:19.400> of

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:19.460 
all and so index you're kind of

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.900 
all and so index you're kind of
unemployed<00:06:20.000> for<00:06:20.240> the<00:06:20.300> moment<00:06:21.640> that's<00:06:22.640> how<00:06:22.880> I

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:22.910 
unemployed for the moment that's how I

unemployed for the moment that's how I
finger<00:06:23.510> it<00:06:23.630> you<00:06:23.960> can<00:06:24.110> see<00:06:24.350> that<00:06:24.380> it's<00:06:24.680> ring

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:25.720 
finger it you can see that it's ring

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:30.370 
finger it you can see that it's ring
middle<00:06:26.890> ring<00:06:27.890> middle<00:06:29.020> here's<00:06:30.020> the<00:06:30.170> good<00:06:30.320> news

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:30.380 
middle ring middle here's the good news

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:33.010 
middle ring middle here's the good news
fingers<00:06:31.220> you've<00:06:31.670> basically<00:06:31.940> learned<00:06:32.510> what

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:33.020 
fingers you've basically learned what

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:35.200 
fingers you've basically learned what
you<00:06:33.050> need<00:06:33.350> to<00:06:33.500> do<00:06:33.680> for<00:06:34.280> all<00:06:34.400> of<00:06:34.580> the<00:06:34.670> other<00:06:34.820> two

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:35.210 
you need to do for all of the other two

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:40.810 
you need to do for all of the other two
for<00:06:35.660> the<00:06:35.720> other<00:06:35.840> two<00:06:36.050> chords

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:40.820 

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:43.270 

fingers<00:06:41.480> are<00:06:41.630> doing<00:06:41.900> exactly<00:06:42.170> the<00:06:42.740> same<00:06:42.980> thing

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:43.280 
fingers are doing exactly the same thing

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.130 
fingers are doing exactly the same thing
as<00:06:43.460> they<00:06:43.610> were<00:06:43.670> doing<00:06:44.120> a<00:06:44.210> second<00:06:44.540> ago<00:06:44.750> so

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:45.140 
as they were doing a second ago so

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:46.780 
as they were doing a second ago so
what's<00:06:45.290> different<00:06:45.470> well<00:06:45.830> of<00:06:45.950> course<00:06:45.980> I<00:06:46.370> change

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:46.790 
what's different well of course I change

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:49.030 
what's different well of course I change
to<00:06:46.940> a<00:06:46.970> seventh<00:06:47.420> with<00:06:47.570> my<00:06:47.690> left<00:06:47.930> hand<00:06:48.020> but<00:06:48.410> also

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:49.040 
to a seventh with my left hand but also

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:49.960 
to a seventh with my left hand but also
the<00:06:49.340> thumb

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:49.970 
the thumb

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:52.780 
the thumb
you<00:06:50.390> may<00:06:50.540> remember<00:06:50.870> has<00:06:51.800> this<00:06:52.040> different

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:52.790 
you may remember has this different

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:56.260 
you may remember has this different
pattern<00:06:53.740> it<00:06:54.740> would<00:06:54.890> seem<00:06:55.190> logically<00:06:55.790> like<00:06:56.120> I

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:56.270 
pattern it would seem logically like I

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:58.150 
pattern it would seem logically like I
just<00:06:56.330> tell<00:06:56.660> my<00:06:56.810> thumb<00:06:57.080> to<00:06:57.230> do<00:06:57.350> that<00:06:57.590> different

00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:58.160 
just tell my thumb to do that different

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.460 
just tell my thumb to do that different
and<00:06:58.340> then<00:06:58.490> do<00:06:58.640> the<00:06:58.760> same<00:06:58.940> fingers<00:06:59.930> what's<00:07:00.350> the

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:00.470 
and then do the same fingers what's the

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:01.060 
and then do the same fingers what's the
big<00:07:00.650> whoop

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:01.070 
big whoop

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:04.390 
big whoop
it's<00:07:01.520> really<00:07:02.000> quite<00:07:02.240> difficult<00:07:02.530> at<00:07:03.530> first<00:07:03.680> to

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:04.400 
it's really quite difficult at first to

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.270 
it's really quite difficult at first to
tell<00:07:05.150> your<00:07:05.300> fingers<00:07:05.660> to<00:07:05.960> do<00:07:06.110> one<00:07:06.290> thing<00:07:06.590> the
