00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:04.299
 it could have been a massacre and this morning the first light of dawn a 

00:00:04.299 --> 00:00:07.809
 truck driver driving an articulated lorry owned by the company 

00:00:07.809 --> 00:00:12.420
 of transport of the place for which it works in to take the state road 7 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.080
 ofantina vista has been overturned by overturning the road too 

00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:19.730
 significant amount of sand transported 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.990
 the fifty year old driver coming from the old appia that connects montemarano av 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:25.820
 Volturara 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.120
 after having traveled a stretch of road in the slight descent was about to 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.210
 take the Faenza when a joint on the mission ramp 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.570
 has lost control of the large articulated vehicle that drives because it is 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.000
 overturned 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.170
 the middle carried over 300 quintals of sand, which was overturned 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:50.590
 on the road occupying the and blocking the junction fortunately only because the 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:55.319
 left occurred in the early hours of dawn when traffic is scarce 

00:00:55.319 --> 00:00:58.170
 there were no further consequences 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.360
 the carabinieri of the local station those of the mobile rate of 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.219
 montella 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:08.370
 immediately arrived at the scene they made 118 staff intervene 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.770
 he transported the truck driver to the emergency room 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.810
 of the moscati di avellino hospital and to secure the stretch of road 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:22.350
 to avoid further accidents diverted all those who had to take it 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.250
 Faentina on the plates now she is so-called bad to take 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.460
 on the Faenza parolise allowing them to reach the capital of Irpinia 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.190
 all technical surveys were carried out and all profits were collected 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.030
 information that will allow us to reconstruct the exact dynamics 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.400
 of what happened from the first investigations carried out to the intervening carabinieri is 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.730
 appeared almost certain that the accident was caused mainly by the 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:55.380
 speed of the articulated vehicle certainly not commensurate with the stretch of road e 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.320
 from excessive load to even if we are still looking for more earth elements 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.800
 unquestionably contesting them against the driver and the employer 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.540
 vehicle owner 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.440
 investigations will also be carried out to verify any damage 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.380
 to the articulated car that may have caused the loss emeritus than on the 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.000
 digital tachograph that recorded both the departure time and 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.269
 the speed held at the time of the accident 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:29.829
 investigations are still under way to verify the position 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:35.110
 work of the transporter and the methods and the quantity of the 

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:40.500
 sand load carried out in the meantime the truck driver as said transported 

00:02:40.499 --> 00:02:44.699
 urgently at the hospital of avellino for the serious injuries reported some 

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:50.239
 ribs of the fractured left arm bruises and various contused lacerated wounds 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:52.119
 All over the body 

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:57.519
