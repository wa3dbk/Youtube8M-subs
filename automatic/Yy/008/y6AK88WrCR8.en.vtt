00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
with it and they just hire the sides and

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:22.820 
with it and they just hire the sides and
they<00:01:21.479> came<00:01:21.689> together<00:01:21.900> and<00:01:22.350> I<00:01:22.439> think<00:01:22.650> it<00:01:22.710> was

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
they came together and I think it was

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.530 
they came together and I think it was
only<00:01:22.950> like<00:01:23.100> ten<00:01:23.400> pounds<00:01:23.850> or<00:01:23.970> something<00:01:24.150> no

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
only like ten pounds or something no

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.330 
only like ten pounds or something no
like<00:01:25.170> six<00:01:25.470> pounds<00:01:25.619> i<00:01:25.890> think<00:01:25.920> it<00:01:26.280> was

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
like six pounds i think it was

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.370 
like six pounds i think it was
definitely<00:01:26.610> less<00:01:26.939> than<00:01:27.090> 10<00:01:27.240> I<00:01:27.450> thought<00:01:28.080> that

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
definitely less than 10 I thought that

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.749 
definitely less than 10 I thought that
was<00:01:28.470> a<00:01:28.530> really<00:01:28.619> good<00:01:28.920> deal<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.400> so<00:01:29.549> if<00:01:29.640> you're

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
was a really good deal and so if you're

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.219 
was a really good deal and so if you're
still<00:01:29.909> going<00:01:30.210> somewhere<00:01:30.509> primary<00:01:30.900> still<00:01:31.079> have

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
still going somewhere primary still have

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.530 
still going somewhere primary still have

10 different pairs and I tried on three
smalls<00:05:33.440> all<00:05:33.919> like<00:05:34.250> this<00:05:34.400> style<00:05:34.760> like<00:05:35.120> three<00:05:35.450> of

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:38.030 
this dialect small and they were all

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:39.580 
this dialect small and they were all
different<00:05:38.270> like<00:05:38.600> and<00:05:38.750> the<00:05:38.900> other<00:05:39.050> two<00:05:39.290> I<00:05:39.320> tired

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:39.590 
different like and the other two I tired

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:41.590 
different like and the other two I tired
or<00:05:39.740> too<00:05:39.770> big<00:05:40.160> so<00:05:40.820> it<00:05:40.850> was<00:05:41.120> just<00:05:41.300> really<00:05:41.419> weird

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:41.600 
or too big so it was just really weird

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.330 
or too big so it was just really weird
and<00:05:41.720> then<00:05:41.900> the<00:05:42.020> extra<00:05:42.410> small<00:05:42.650> was<00:05:42.890> like<00:05:43.070> two

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:43.340 
and then the extra small was like two

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.700 
and then the extra small was like two
big<00:05:43.520> as<00:05:43.729> well<00:05:43.910> so<00:05:44.210> then<00:05:44.419> this<00:05:44.570> small<00:05:44.750> fit<00:05:45.200> it

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:45.710 
big as well so then this small fit it

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:47.290 
big as well so then this small fit it
was<00:05:45.860> just<00:05:45.979> really<00:05:46.190> weird<00:05:46.430> how<00:05:46.669> the<00:05:46.729> sizing

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:47.300 
was just really weird how the sizing

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.570 
was just really weird how the sizing
works<00:05:47.330> because<00:05:47.960> I<00:05:48.200> mean<00:05:48.560> obviously<00:05:48.770> they<00:05:49.340> make

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:49.580 
works because I mean obviously they make

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:52.390 
works because I mean obviously they make
them<00:05:49.790> from<00:05:49.970> the<00:05:50.060> jeans<00:05:50.300> so<00:05:50.780> each<00:05:51.710> size<00:05:52.010> was<00:05:52.370> a

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:52.400 
them from the jeans so each size was a

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.340 
them from the jeans so each size was a
bit<00:05:52.640> different<00:05:53.090> around<00:05:53.240> like<00:05:53.570> the<00:05:53.870> legs<00:05:54.110> and

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:54.350 
bit different around like the legs and

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:56.020 
bit different around like the legs and
stuff<00:05:54.620> so<00:05:54.860> definitely<00:05:55.220> try<00:05:55.430> it<00:05:55.490> on<00:05:55.729> and<00:05:55.910> don't

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:56.030 
stuff so definitely try it on and don't

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:58.030 
stuff so definitely try it on and don't
worry<00:05:56.300> if<00:05:56.390> it<00:05:56.600> doesn't<00:05:56.900> fit<00:05:57.020> at<00:05:57.080> first<00:05:57.440> light<00:05:57.800> I

00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:58.040 
worry if it doesn't fit at first light I

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.400
