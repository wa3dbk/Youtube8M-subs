00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.460
 We will introduce one handmade a day 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:14.600
 Today is this 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:19.900
 It is spring like using a race of such a small motif 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:19.900
 If you want to make accessories, please 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:30.220
 I hope to do it soon 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:31.800
 First of all, it's a race of 10 cm long 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:35.449
 And 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:40.670
 Prepare round cans as usual 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:42.700
 Firmly and tightly if he has a 3:00 o'clock and 9 if I have you on the break in 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:46.740
 But the other side is holding 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:49.420
 And here is the end of this race 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:52.110
 Bustling in this marca 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:56.820
 Stab 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:59.170
 Once allowed to leave to close the 1 here round cans 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:03.510
 The traditional version is the same 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.510
 Round cans will be immersed eh 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.550
 eh 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.880
 Shook 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:18.759
 So I'll surely close this 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:21.200
 If you do , the round can not be attached to both sides 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:25.670
 And it is good to prepare 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:29.270
 Because it is a short chain of 32 cm of this chain 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:36.710
 Just in the middle of this 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:41.220
 Makushita in such a feeling I'd go in the rough rule of thumb I time to explore the place of Kano middle and line 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:44.510
 If you point to something like tpp and say 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:48.100
 In that you will see at the middle Yes 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.100
 I bought it here 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.970
 Putsu 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.630
 Now this in Japan of chain Once expired 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:00.640
 Hmm 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:07.170
 The necklace I just put on here in this Japanese chain 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:07.170
 Here is through the chain to open such is I again part of Marka 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.470
 Akun 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:18.390
 Enter the end of the chain inside this marca 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.750
 Press and 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.750
 stone 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:28.310
 If you try this too, it looks like this 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:32.870
 Beneath it can necklace 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:36.330
 And this is fine, but when I think it's a bit lonely 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:44.000
 Now let's take out the bond as usual 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:45.530
 This is a new appearance, but once I put out the bond in the plate 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.910
 About this 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:53.870
 It looks like this amount of yeah 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.810
 Prepare this pearl 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:03:01.380
 By 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:02.280
 The hole is open, but the hole is next to the hole part The part that the hole is holding with tweezers is called the hole 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.680
 It feels like 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:11.319
 I feel a little bit attached bond 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.319
 In there and Petatsu in this area 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:23.180
 The reason why with a portion of this hole with a pair of tweezers 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:25.600
 Is it a bit smarter to turn the sideways so that you can not see the hole when facing the front ? 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:30.860
 Nah 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:35.550
 Yes if I put on pearls like this 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:38.640
 It is here that Nick was completed Yes, this kind of feeling 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:46.090
 Yes and subsequently continued 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:49.629
 8 I think Let's make a pierced little in the same kind of form in accordance with this 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:56.560
 Next time I will prepare 9 pins 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:57.400
 9 of that pin is little the place of round cans of here. Yes it is fitting of such a feeling 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.730
 pit 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:06.010

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:07.220
 open it and hook the race here as well 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.950
 Good place 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.920
 And this 9 pin 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.040
 I will surely close 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.639

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:22.150
 A little while pearl 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:22.150
 It is whether the perl Toka beads little bit and try to soaring 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:30.270
 I'd say natural stone Toka also why Pearl Toka Beatz Toka Why 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:39.740
 It looks like this 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:39.740
 It is part of Hajikko firm ride round and round all round round cans here will make a part 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:54.440
 Oh 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:05:00.560
 With this feeling, the two parts of the instep are now complete 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:05:06.560
 It is a metal fitting of this piercing, so let's go over the powder part of this piercing a little 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:11.020
 In in and be open to shifting here this 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:12.190

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:37.310

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.760

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:56.660
 It seems like spring like this 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:06:01.720
