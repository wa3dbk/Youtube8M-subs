complicated<00:00:51.720> I<00:00:52.559> guess<00:00:53.040> a<00:00:53.070> little<00:00:53.430> as<00:00:53.580> violence

00:00:54.759 --> 00:00:54.769 
complicated I guess a little as violence

00:00:54.769 --> 00:01:00.170 
complicated I guess a little as violence
the<00:00:55.769> icon<00:00:56.280> is<00:00:56.610> this<00:00:58.100> very<00:00:59.100> neat<00:00:59.369> icon<00:00:59.790> I<00:00:59.820> think

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
the icon is this very neat icon I think

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.810 
the icon is this very neat icon I think
there<00:01:01.019> is<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.229> lite<00:01:01.559> version<00:01:01.589> for<00:01:02.460> this<00:01:02.580> I<00:01:02.759> think

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
there is a lite version for this I think

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.840

it is free I'm not sure I think it is
free<00:01:07.549> but<00:01:08.549> I<00:01:08.580> definitely<00:01:08.880> recommend<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.630> full

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840

step<00:02:53.860> on<00:02:54.010> this<00:02:54.280> pedal<00:02:54.730> to<00:02:55.299> go<00:02:55.480> and<00:02:55.920> then<00:02:56.920> you

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:57.069 
step on this pedal to go and then you

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:58.949 
step on this pedal to go and then you
will<00:02:57.790> I'm<00:02:58.000> on<00:02:58.150> the<00:02:58.269> joystick<00:02:58.480> right<00:02:58.840> now

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
will I'm on the joystick right now

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:06.899 
will I'm on the joystick right now
because<00:02:59.140> I<00:02:59.230> find<00:02:59.470> that's<00:02:59.680> the<00:02:59.860> easiest

00:03:06.899 --> 00:03:06.909 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:14.830 

just<00:03:12.129> rushing<00:03:13.129> to<00:03:13.159> pause<00:03:13.430> so<00:03:14.180> as<00:03:14.209> you<00:03:14.480> can<00:03:14.629> see

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
just rushing to pause so as you can see

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.869 
just rushing to pause so as you can see
I<00:03:14.870> guess<00:03:15.200> my<00:03:15.409> damage<00:03:15.829> meter<00:03:16.040> is<00:03:16.219> going<00:03:16.249> up<00:03:16.700> if

00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:16.879 
I guess my damage meter is going up if

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:18.670 
I guess my damage meter is going up if
you<00:03:17.269> let<00:03:17.420> it<00:03:17.450> go<00:03:17.599> up<00:03:17.659> all<00:03:17.810> the<00:03:17.840> way<00:03:17.989> you're

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
you let it go up all the way you're

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.179 
you let it go up all the way you're
pretty<00:03:19.430> wide<00:03:19.639> rule<00:03:19.849> dues<00:03:20.060> so<00:03:20.719> me<00:03:21.620> go<00:03:21.950> back<00:03:22.099> to

00:03:22.179 --> 00:03:22.189 
pretty wide rule dues so me go back to

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:26.530 
pretty wide rule dues so me go back to
the<00:03:22.280> main<00:03:22.400> menu<00:03:25.150> not<00:03:26.150> great<00:03:26.329> for<00:03:26.420> your

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
the main menu not great for your

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:27.610 
the main menu not great for your
missions<00:03:26.780> cuz<00:03:26.959> it's<00:03:27.109> just<00:03:27.260> pretty<00:03:27.409> much<00:03:27.500> the

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
missions cuz it's just pretty much the

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.709 
missions cuz it's just pretty much the
same<00:03:27.739> thing<00:03:27.980> there<00:03:28.519> is<00:03:28.670> one<00:03:29.060> thing<00:03:29.269> that<00:03:29.299> I

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:29.719 
same thing there is one thing that I

00:03:29.719 --> 00:03:32.229 
same thing there is one thing that I
guess<00:03:30.530> is<00:03:30.739> really<00:03:31.129> cool<00:03:31.280> about<00:03:31.400> this<00:03:31.549> game<00:03:31.639> if

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 
guess is really cool about this game if

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:34.089 
guess is really cool about this game if
you're<00:03:32.599> caught<00:03:32.840> by<00:03:33.109> police<00:03:33.500> let's<00:03:33.950> start

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
No Limits like I said graphics are

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.030 
No Limits like I said graphics are
amazing<00:04:44.450> and<00:04:44.960> so<00:04:45.110> is<00:04:45.260> the<00:04:45.410> physics<00:04:45.800> of<00:04:45.890> the

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:46.040 
amazing and so is the physics of the

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.820 
amazing and so is the physics of the
actual<00:04:46.460> gameplay<00:04:46.670> itself<00:04:47.410> so<00:04:48.410> I<00:04:48.440> guess<00:04:48.680> the

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
actual gameplay itself so I guess the

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.470 
actual gameplay itself so I guess the
training<00:04:49.100> is<00:04:49.190> pretty<00:04:49.310> cool<00:04:49.580> I<00:04:49.880> guess<00:04:50.180> you

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:50.480 
training is pretty cool I guess you

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.700 
training is pretty cool I guess you
could<00:04:50.600> train<00:04:50.830> to<00:04:51.830> use<00:04:52.040> your<00:04:52.190> controls<00:04:52.550> right

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
could train to use your controls right

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.550 
could train to use your controls right

profiles

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:30.130 
profiles
I<00:05:27.919> guess<00:05:28.820> I've<00:05:29.000> created<00:05:29.300> one<00:05:29.480> profile<00:05:29.840> already

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:30.140 
I guess I've created one profile already

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:35.020 
I guess I've created one profile already
and<00:05:30.410> cheats<00:05:31.070> we<00:05:31.880> need<00:05:32.390> to<00:05:32.660> police<00:05:33.080> I<00:05:33.590> guess<00:05:34.430> you

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:35.030 
and cheats we need to police I guess you

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:36.640 
and cheats we need to police I guess you
have<00:05:35.120> to<00:05:35.150> unlock<00:05:35.540> the<00:05:35.690> cheats<00:05:35.930> for<00:05:36.350> these<00:05:36.470> I

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:36.650 
have to unlock the cheats for these I

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:41.290 
have to unlock the cheats for these I
obviously<00:05:37.100> can't<00:05:37.550> change<00:05:37.760> any<00:05:37.940> of<00:05:38.060> this<00:05:39.850> so<00:05:40.850> I

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:41.300 
obviously can't change any of this so I

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:42.880 
obviously can't change any of this so I
guess<00:05:41.960> that's<00:05:42.140> pretty<00:05:42.440> much<00:05:42.500> to<00:05:42.620> talk<00:05:42.740> to

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:42.890 
guess that's pretty much to talk to

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:44.230 
guess that's pretty much to talk to
Mecca<00:05:43.130> actually<00:05:43.550> go<00:05:43.700> into<00:05:43.850> everything

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.240 
Mecca actually go into everything

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:48.850 
Mecca actually go into everything
because<00:05:44.570> it's<00:05:44.780> so<00:05:45.050> in-depth<00:05:46.840> but<00:05:47.840> I<00:05:48.230> guess<00:05:48.680> I

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:48.860 
because it's so in-depth but I guess I

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:50.290 
because it's so in-depth but I guess I
couldn't<00:05:49.130> show<00:05:49.280> you<00:05:49.310> the<00:05:49.430> missions<00:05:49.790> you<00:05:49.940> pick

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:50.300 
couldn't show you the missions you pick

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.870 
couldn't show you the missions you pick
so<00:05:50.750> I've<00:05:50.990> already<00:05:51.200> held<00:05:51.560> mission<00:05:51.919> nine<00:05:52.100> so

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:52.880 
so I've already held mission nine so

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.940 
so I've already held mission nine so
it's<00:05:52.910> going<00:05:53.150> to<00:05:53.210> load<00:05:53.450> like<00:05:54.260> I<00:05:54.380> said<00:05:54.440> loadings

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:54.950 
it's going to load like I said loadings

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:56.320 
it's going to load like I said loadings
a<00:05:55.040> little<00:05:55.250> bit<00:05:55.340> slow<00:05:55.580> I<00:05:55.610> guess<00:05:55.850> that's<00:05:56.180> one

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:56.330 
a little bit slow I guess that's one

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:03.820 
a little bit slow I guess that's one
thing<00:05:56.510> they<00:05:56.630> could<00:05:56.780> fix<00:05:56.990> oh<00:06:02.020> I<00:06:03.020> changed<00:06:03.440> my

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:03.830 
thing they could fix oh I changed my

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:08.249 
thing they could fix oh I changed my
thing<00:06:04.190> so<00:06:04.370> now<00:06:04.520> it's<00:06:04.669> on<00:06:04.850> a<00:06:05.590> accelerometer

00:06:08.249 --> 00:06:08.259 
thing so now it's on a accelerometer

00:06:08.259 --> 00:06:13.240 
thing so now it's on a accelerometer
okay<00:06:09.259> so<00:06:09.729> so<00:06:10.729> now<00:06:10.880> that<00:06:11.350> we're<00:06:12.350> actually<00:06:12.410> the

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:13.250 
okay so so now that we're actually the

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:15.790 
okay so so now that we're actually the
police<00:06:13.460> are<00:06:13.610> chasing<00:06:13.639> us<00:06:14.199> you'll<00:06:15.199> see<00:06:15.440> that

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:15.800 
police are chasing us you'll see that

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.890 
police are chasing us you'll see that
the<00:06:16.190> map<00:06:16.400> flashing<00:06:17.030> and<00:06:17.240> the<00:06:17.449> police<00:06:17.690> are

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:17.900 
the map flashing and the police are

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:19.240 
the map flashing and the police are
behind<00:06:18.080> us<00:06:18.380> they're<00:06:18.560> like<00:06:18.680> family<00:06:18.949> nice

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:19.250 
behind us they're like family nice

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:20.439 
behind us they're like family nice
they'll<00:06:19.460> actually<00:06:19.669> get<00:06:19.910> out<00:06:20.030> of<00:06:20.090> a<00:06:20.150> crime<00:06:20.300> do

00:06:20.439 --> 00:06:20.449 
they'll actually get out of a crime do

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:22.420 
they'll actually get out of a crime do
anything<00:06:20.720> they<00:06:21.229> actually<00:06:21.560> try<00:06:21.800> to<00:06:21.830> damage<00:06:22.250> the

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:22.430 
anything they actually try to damage the

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:25.719 
anything they actually try to damage the
car<00:06:22.639> so<00:06:23.120> the<00:06:23.630> mission<00:06:23.780> is<00:06:23.930> over<00:06:24.729> submissions

00:06:25.719 --> 00:06:25.729 
car so the mission is over submissions

00:06:25.729 --> 00:06:29.499 
car so the mission is over submissions
are<00:06:25.880> times<00:06:26.150> as<00:06:26.539> you<00:06:26.720> can<00:06:26.750> see<00:06:27.460> up<00:06:28.460> there<00:06:28.520> and

00:06:29.499 --> 00:06:29.509 
are times as you can see up there and

00:06:29.509 --> 00:06:31.930 
are times as you can see up there and
then<00:06:29.720> some<00:06:29.930> are<00:06:30.050> not<00:06:30.199> someone<00:06:30.860> just<00:06:31.039> however

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:31.940 
then some are not someone just however

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:34.570 
then some are not someone just however
long<00:06:32.090> you<00:06:32.180> can<00:06:32.330> do<00:06:32.479> it<00:06:32.569> in<00:06:32.660> the<00:06:33.410> controls<00:06:33.830> is<00:06:34.160> I

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:34.580 
long you can do it in the controls is I

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:35.980 
long you can do it in the controls is I
haven't<00:06:35.090> really<00:06:35.270> figured<00:06:35.419> out<00:06:35.630> all<00:06:35.840> the

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:35.990 
haven't really figured out all the

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:37.300 
haven't really figured out all the
controls<00:06:36.349> yeah<00:06:36.560> I<00:06:36.710> know<00:06:36.770> there's<00:06:37.009> a<00:06:37.039> break

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:37.310 
controls yeah I know there's a break

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:39.040 
controls yeah I know there's a break
back<00:06:37.849> up<00:06:38.180> go

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:39.050 
back up go

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:40.450 
back up go
I<00:06:39.080> haven't<00:06:39.560> actually<00:06:39.710> really<00:06:40.099> figured<00:06:40.400> out

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:40.460 
I haven't actually really figured out

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:43.930 
I haven't actually really figured out
this<00:06:40.729> yet<00:06:41.889> so<00:06:42.889> I<00:06:42.919> think<00:06:43.310> it's<00:06:43.430> a<00:06:43.520> pretty<00:06:43.729> neat

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:43.940 
this yet so I think it's a pretty neat

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:46.960 
this yet so I think it's a pretty neat
