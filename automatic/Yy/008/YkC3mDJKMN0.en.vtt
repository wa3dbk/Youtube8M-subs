00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.350 
things that really make a difference
with<00:01:35.610> this<00:01:35.759> bike<00:01:36.000> when<00:01:36.210> you<00:01:36.299> change<00:01:36.570> them

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
with this bike when you change them

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.149 
with this bike when you change them
suspension<00:01:39.360> is<00:01:39.450> a<00:01:39.479> big<00:01:39.570> deal<00:01:40.040> suspension<00:01:41.040> is

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
suspension is a big deal suspension is

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.550 
suspension is a big deal suspension is
definitely<00:01:41.729> a<00:01:41.759> pretty<00:01:42.720> significant<00:01:43.320> on<00:01:43.380> these

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
definitely a pretty significant on these

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.520 
definitely a pretty significant on these
things<00:01:43.829> and<00:01:44.270> you<00:01:45.270> know<00:01:45.390> if<00:01:45.479> you<00:01:45.570> make<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:46.110> change

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
things and you know if you make a change

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.219 
things and you know if you make a change
in<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.159> wrong<00:01:47.369> direction<00:01:47.579> then<00:01:47.939> it<00:01:48.450> can<00:01:48.780> have

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
in the wrong direction then it can have

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.139 
in the wrong direction then it can have
a<00:01:49.259> pretty<00:01:49.530> profound<00:01:49.740> effect<00:01:50.280> on<00:01:50.460> how<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.759> bike

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
a pretty profound effect on how the bike

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.030 
a pretty profound effect on how the bike
performs<00:01:51.630> one<00:01:52.409> of<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.560> things<00:01:52.680> that's<00:01:52.890> unique

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
performs one of the things that's unique

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.560 
performs one of the things that's unique
is<00:01:53.430> you<00:01:53.460> hear<00:01:53.729> a<00:01:53.790> lot<00:01:53.939> of<00:01:54.060> these<00:01:54.119> guys<00:01:54.270> talk

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
is you hear a lot of these guys talk

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.940 
is you hear a lot of these guys talk
about<00:01:54.689> gearing<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:55.320> different<00:01:55.649> things<00:01:55.680> like

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
about gearing and different things like

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.039 
about gearing and different things like
that<00:01:56.250> not<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.729> lot<00:01:56.820> of<00:01:57.000> options<00:01:57.509> on<00:01:57.689> these<00:01:57.869> there

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
that not a lot of options on these there

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.319 
that not a lot of options on these there
there<00:01:58.200> a<00:01:58.229> belt-drive<00:01:58.710> bike<00:01:58.979> right<00:01:59.790> it's<00:02:00.149> a

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
there a belt-drive bike right it's a

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.050 
there a belt-drive bike right it's a
belt-drive<00:02:00.719> bike<00:02:01.049> and<00:02:01.409> also<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.430> gearing<00:02:02.729> is

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
belt-drive bike and also the gearing is

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.080 
belt-drive bike and also the gearing is
spec<00:02:03.689> so<00:02:04.049> AMA<00:02:04.649> actually<00:02:05.219> approves<00:02:05.610> most<00:02:05.880> of

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
spec so AMA actually approves most of

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.219 
spec so AMA actually approves most of
the<00:02:06.149> gearing<00:02:06.390> and<00:02:06.540> most<00:02:06.780> of<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:06.930> components

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
the gearing and most of the components

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.229 
the gearing and most of the components
on<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.649> motorcycle<00:02:08.250> so<00:02:08.369> there's<00:02:08.550> not<00:02:08.729> a<00:02:09.000> lot

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
on the motorcycle so there's not a lot

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:09.999 
on the motorcycle so there's not a lot
that<00:02:09.509> we

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
that we
