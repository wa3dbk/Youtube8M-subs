out on a limb with Halo to design each

out on a limb with Halo to design each

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:42.910 
one of our multiplayer maps so they fit

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.240 
one of our multiplayer maps so they fit

within the single player settings so you

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:46.530 
within the single player settings so you

could look at any of our maps and you

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:56.200 
could look at any of our maps and you
could<00:00:46.690> say<00:00:46.900> wait<00:00:47.680> I<00:00:47.829> know<00:00:48.190> that<00:00:48.430> location

flag or on almost every halo one map we

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.039 
flag or on almost every halo one map we
had<00:01:01.890> two<00:01:02.430> bases<00:01:02.940> that<00:01:03.210> were<00:01:03.360> pretty<00:01:03.600> identical

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
had two bases that were pretty identical

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.219 
had two bases that were pretty identical
and<00:01:04.860> at<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.610> beginning<00:01:05.940> of<00:01:06.150> Halo<00:01:06.420> 2<00:01:06.570> we<00:01:07.140> were

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
and at the beginning of Halo 2 we were

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.570 
and at the beginning of Halo 2 we were
trying<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.530> think<00:01:07.710> of<00:01:07.799> different<00:01:07.830> ways<00:01:08.100> or<00:01:08.490> we

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
trying to think of different ways or we

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:09.890 
trying to think of different ways or we
can<00:01:08.700> make<00:01:08.820> her<00:01:08.970> match<00:01:09.150> more<00:01:09.450> asymmetrical

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
can make her match more asymmetrical

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.889 
can make her match more asymmetrical
it's<00:01:10.830> fun<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.670> play<00:01:11.880> as<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.330> attacker<00:01:12.630> and

00:01:12.889 --> 00:01:12.899 
it's fun to play as the attacker and

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:14.480 
it's fun to play as the attacker and
then<00:01:13.020> it's<00:01:13.140> fun<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.440> play<00:01:13.619> as<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.950> defender

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
then it's fun to play as the defender

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.609 
then it's fun to play as the defender
you<00:01:14.790> can<00:01:14.970> never<00:01:15.119> completely<00:01:15.780> defend<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.470> base

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
you can never completely defend the base

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.410 
you can never completely defend the base
maybe<00:01:17.159> there's<00:01:17.430> two<00:01:17.580> guys<00:01:17.729> defending<00:01:18.270> but

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
maybe there's two guys defending but

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.090 
maybe there's two guys defending but
there's<00:01:18.600> three<00:01:18.840> ways<00:01:19.020> in<00:01:19.049> you<00:01:19.770> always<00:01:19.890> having

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
there's three ways in you always having

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.570 
there's three ways in you always having
to<00:01:20.220> make<00:01:20.310> these<00:01:20.460> choices<00:01:21.890> so<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.009> attackers

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
to make these choices so the attackers

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.020 
to make these choices so the attackers
start<00:01:23.909> on<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.270> beach<00:01:25.100> and<00:01:26.100> we<00:01:26.759> give<00:01:26.909> the

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
start on the beach and we give the

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.279 
start on the beach and we give the
attack<00:01:27.330> or<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.630> warthog<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.470> two<00:01:29.039> ghosts<00:01:30.289> and

00:01:31.279 --> 00:01:31.289 
attack or a warthog and two ghosts and

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:32.630 
attack or a warthog and two ghosts and
we<00:01:31.409> don't<00:01:31.530> give<00:01:31.649> the<00:01:31.770> defender<00:01:32.190> anything

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
we don't give the defender anything

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.090 
we don't give the defender anything
except<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.179> rocket<00:01:33.569> launcher

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.280 

and<00:01:36.310> the<00:01:36.520> beach<00:01:36.730> is<00:01:36.940> separated<00:01:37.510> from<00:01:37.750> the<00:01:38.200> main

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.290 
and the beach is separated from the main

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.130 
and the beach is separated from the main
complex<00:01:39.010> by<00:01:39.280> the<00:01:39.340> seawall<00:01:40.060> so<00:01:40.780> it<00:01:40.840> gives<00:01:41.020> the

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
complex by the seawall so it gives the

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.050 
complex by the seawall so it gives the
attackers<00:01:41.650> a<00:01:41.680> home<00:01:41.950> and<00:01:42.310> then<00:01:42.430> the<00:01:42.610> defenders

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
attackers a home and then the defenders

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.850 
attackers a home and then the defenders
also<00:01:43.390> have<00:01:43.540> their<00:01:43.780> base<00:01:43.990> which<00:01:44.260> is<00:01:44.440> their<00:01:44.620> home

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 
also have their base which is their home

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.390 
also have their base which is their home
and<00:01:46.140> then<00:01:47.140> the<00:01:47.260> vehicles<00:01:47.740> have<00:01:47.979> to<00:01:48.130> come<00:01:48.280> in

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:48.400 
and then the vehicles have to come in

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.359 
and then the vehicles have to come in
through<00:01:48.610> this<00:01:48.670> one<00:01:48.940> gate<00:01:50.250> launcher<00:01:51.250> guy

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
through this one gate launcher guy

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:53.480 
through this one gate launcher guy
usually<00:01:51.970> likes<00:01:52.240> to<00:01:52.360> get<00:01:52.570> into<00:01:52.780> position<00:01:52.900> to

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
usually likes to get into position to

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.810 
usually likes to get into position to
attack<00:01:54.490> that<00:01:54.700> day

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.060 

what<00:01:59.820> is<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.240> heads-up<00:02:00.630> display<00:02:00.890> let's<00:02:01.890> say

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
what is the heads-up display let's say

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.440 
what is the heads-up display let's say
I'm<00:02:02.220> in<00:02:02.369> a<00:02:02.399> firefight<00:02:02.700> and<00:02:02.939> I'm<00:02:03.119> firing<00:02:03.329> my
