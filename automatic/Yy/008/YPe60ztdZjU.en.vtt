be<00:00:11.790> showing<00:00:12.030> you<00:00:12.269> this<00:00:12.870> trapdoor<00:00:13.590> of<00:00:13.889> mine

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
be showing you this trapdoor of mine

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.900 
be showing you this trapdoor of mine
it's<00:00:14.610> a<00:00:14.849> new<00:00:15.150> design<00:00:15.299> that<00:00:15.719> I<00:00:15.839> made<00:00:16.049> it<00:00:16.500> is<00:00:17.310> a<00:00:17.699> 2

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
it's a new design that I made it is a 2

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.870 
it's a new design that I made it is a 2
by<00:00:17.940> 2<00:00:18.090> floor<00:00:18.630> trapdoor<00:00:19.430> completely<00:00:20.430> flushed

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
by 2 floor trapdoor completely flushed

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.650 
by 2 floor trapdoor completely flushed
with<00:00:21.600> floor<00:00:21.930> level<00:00:22.460> now<00:00:23.460> you<00:00:23.519> might<00:00:24.000> not<00:00:24.150> know

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
with floor level now you might not know

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.230 
with floor level now you might not know
what<00:00:24.960> that<00:00:24.990> means<00:00:25.430> but<00:00:26.430> basically<00:00:26.849> what<00:00:27.210> that

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
what that means but basically what that

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.490 
what that means but basically what that
means<00:00:27.390> is<00:00:27.930> that<00:00:30.140> when<00:00:31.140> you<00:00:31.230> close<00:00:31.500> it<00:00:32.450> it's

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.500 
means is that when you close it it's

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.580 
means is that when you close it it's
well<00:00:34.730> you<00:00:35.730> can't<00:00:35.969> see<00:00:36.270> it<00:00:36.300> you<00:00:37.170> can't<00:00:37.410> really

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
well you can't see it you can't really

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.130 
well you can't see it you can't really
see<00:00:37.800> it's<00:00:37.980> not<00:00:38.129> obvious<00:00:38.670> because<00:00:39.120> it's<00:00:39.480> at<00:00:40.110> the

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
see it's not obvious because it's at the

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.930 
see it's not obvious because it's at the
floor<00:00:40.410> level<00:00:40.590> also<00:00:41.399> its<00:00:42.120> ultra<00:00:42.870> compact<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:43.940> I

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
floor level also its ultra compact and I

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.779 
floor level also its ultra compact and I
really<00:00:45.600> don't<00:00:45.719> think<00:00:45.870> anyone<00:00:46.460> you<00:00:47.460> can<00:00:47.640> get

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
really don't think anyone you can get

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.380 
really don't think anyone you can get
this<00:00:48.030> any<00:00:48.480> more<00:00:48.950> compact<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.610> this<00:00:51.239> is

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
this any more compact and this is

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.119 
this any more compact and this is
completely<00:00:51.989> survival<00:00:52.800> friendly<00:00:53.600> and<00:00:55.129> I

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
completely survival friendly and I

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.500 
completely survival friendly and I
usually<00:00:56.340> don't<00:00:56.640> do<00:00:57.000> those<00:00:57.510> kind<00:00:57.870> of<00:00:57.960> creations

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
usually don't do those kind of creations

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:06.080 
usually don't do those kind of creations
anyways<00:01:02.030> let's<00:01:03.030> start<00:01:03.510> with<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.199> tutorial<00:01:05.090> to

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
anyways let's start with the tutorial to

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.320 
anyways let's start with the tutorial to
build<00:01:06.270> this<00:01:06.450> you<00:01:06.510> will<00:01:06.960> need<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.409> 6<00:01:08.220> by<00:01:08.400> 6<00:01:08.430> area

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
build this you will need a 6 by 6 area

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.600 
build this you will need a 6 by 6 area
and<00:01:10.369> it<00:01:11.369> needs<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.640> be<00:01:11.729> you<00:01:12.420> know<00:01:12.450> four<00:01:12.990> high<00:01:13.610> so

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
and it needs to be you know four high so

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.789 
and it needs to be you know four high so
first<00:01:15.000> of<00:01:15.299> all<00:01:15.420> we're<00:01:15.720> gonna<00:01:15.869> placing<00:01:16.650> down

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
first of all we're gonna placing down

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:23.810 
first of all we're gonna placing down
our<00:01:17.100> support<00:01:17.580> blocks<00:01:17.820> like<00:01:18.750> so<00:01:20.840> and<00:01:22.820> then

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
our support blocks like so and then

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.929 
our support blocks like so and then
we're<00:01:24.119> gonna<00:01:24.299> place<00:01:24.869> piston<00:01:25.500> here<00:01:25.939> the

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
we're gonna place piston here the

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.560 
we're gonna place piston here the
business<00:01:27.360> here<00:01:28.189> pistons<00:01:29.189> facing<00:01:29.369> upwards<00:01:29.970> on

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
business here pistons facing upwards on

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.710 
business here pistons facing upwards on
both<00:01:30.780> sides<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.979> our<00:01:32.579> floor<00:01:33.060> block<00:01:33.240> or<00:01:33.450> floor

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
both sides and our floor block or floor

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.429 
both sides and our floor block or floor
blocks<00:01:34.470> right<00:01:34.829> there<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.610> right<00:01:35.939> here<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:37.200> we

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
blocks right there and right here and we

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.640 
blocks right there and right here and we
got<00:01:37.590> build<00:01:37.950> up<00:01:38.130> three<00:01:38.729> blocks<00:01:38.850> on<00:01:39.329> each<00:01:39.930> side

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
got build up three blocks on each side

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.980 
got build up three blocks on each side
so<00:01:41.630> and<00:01:42.630> add<00:01:43.530> two<00:01:43.770> blocks<00:01:44.009> there<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:44.990> that's

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
so and add two blocks there and that's

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.520 
so and add two blocks there and that's
your<00:01:46.500> basic<00:01:47.720> chapter<00:01:48.720> then<00:01:49.079> we<00:01:49.259> can<00:01:49.380> just

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
your basic chapter then we can just

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.460 
your basic chapter then we can just
knock<00:01:49.770> out<00:01:49.979> these<00:01:50.250> support<00:01:50.670> blocks<00:01:51.140> now<00:01:52.140> we're

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
knock out these support blocks now we're

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.100 
knock out these support blocks now we're
gonna<00:01:52.590> go<00:01:52.799> ahead<00:01:52.829> and<00:01:53.070> do<00:01:53.340> is<00:01:53.600> we<00:01:54.600> are<00:01:54.750> going<00:01:54.960> to

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
gonna go ahead and do is we are going to

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.330 
gonna go ahead and do is we are going to
place<00:01:55.380> a<00:01:55.680> block<00:01:56.130> there<00:01:56.880> block<00:01:57.719> there<00:01:58.100> put<00:01:59.100> a

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
place a block there block there put a

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.209 
place a block there block there put a
repeater<00:01:59.670> on<00:01:59.820> two<00:02:00.180> tix<00:02:00.390> there<00:02:00.979> put<00:02:01.979> a<00:02:02.009> block

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
repeater on two tix there put a block

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.940 
repeater on two tix there put a block
there<00:02:02.460> redstone<00:02:03.030> dust<00:02:03.149> on<00:02:03.270> top<00:02:03.329> of<00:02:03.600> that<00:02:03.950> and

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
there redstone dust on top of that and

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.570 
there redstone dust on top of that and
then<00:02:05.520> another<00:02:06.360> blocks<00:02:06.810> there<00:02:07.399> redstone<00:02:08.399> on

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
then another blocks there redstone on

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.749 
then another blocks there redstone on
top<00:02:08.819> of<00:02:08.940> that<00:02:09.060> block

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
top of that block

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.140 
top of that block
on<00:02:11.569> top<00:02:11.810> of<00:02:11.840> the<00:02:12.019> redstone<00:02:12.470> no<00:02:13.459> it's<00:02:13.940> blocked

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
on top of the redstone no it's blocked

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.360 
on top of the redstone no it's blocked
their<00:02:14.450> block<00:02:14.930> their<00:02:15.200> redstone<00:02:15.799> dust<00:02:15.980> and

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
their block their redstone dust and

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.289 
their block their redstone dust and
repeater<00:02:17.269> on<00:02:17.330> two<00:02:17.540> ticks<00:02:18.250> now<00:02:19.250> that's<00:02:19.940> your

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:20.299 
repeater on two ticks now that's your

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:24.070 
repeater on two ticks now that's your
basic<00:02:20.690> thing<00:02:21.610> then<00:02:22.610> we're<00:02:22.819> gonna<00:02:22.909> place<00:02:23.810> two

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
basic thing then we're gonna place two

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.440 
basic thing then we're gonna place two
blocks<00:02:24.230> there<00:02:24.849> that's<00:02:25.849> doing<00:02:26.180> repeater

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
blocks there that's doing repeater

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.970 
blocks there that's doing repeater
running<00:02:26.840> into<00:02:27.049> that<00:02:27.200> and<00:02:27.860> then<00:02:28.519> dust<00:02:29.269> and<00:02:29.980> we

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
running into that and then dust and we

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:36.100 
running into that and then dust and we
can<00:02:31.129> just<00:02:32.950> yeah<00:02:34.010> can't<00:02:34.580> place<00:02:34.760> and<00:02:35.450> then<00:02:36.019> we're

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
can just yeah can't place and then we're

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.979 
can just yeah can't place and then we're
gonna<00:02:36.230> run<00:02:36.500> this<00:02:36.769> redstone<00:02:37.459> wire<00:02:37.940> all<00:02:38.629> along

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
gonna run this redstone wire all along

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:43.440 
gonna run this redstone wire all along
like<00:02:39.200> that<00:02:39.819> two<00:02:40.819> blocks<00:02:41.030> in<00:02:42.040> redstone<00:02:43.040> dust

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
like that two blocks in redstone dust

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.589 
like that two blocks in redstone dust
and<00:02:44.450> now<00:02:45.319> we<00:02:45.379> just<00:02:45.910> well<00:02:46.910> we<00:02:47.090> basically<00:02:47.239> just

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:47.599 
and now we just well we basically just

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:50.589 
and now we just well we basically just
mirror<00:02:48.140> the<00:02:48.530> other<00:02:48.560> side<00:02:49.239> figure<00:02:50.239> on<00:02:50.420> two

00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:50.599

now<00:03:05.079> one<00:03:06.079> thing<00:03:06.260> I<00:03:06.379> do<00:03:06.440> recommend<00:03:06.739> is<00:03:07.720> if

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
now one thing I do recommend is if

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.580 
now one thing I do recommend is if
you're<00:03:09.290> gonna<00:03:09.410> have<00:03:09.709> the<00:03:09.950> input<00:03:10.400> like<00:03:10.849> this

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
you're gonna have the input like this

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.740 
you're gonna have the input like this
then<00:03:12.590> I<00:03:12.950> recommend<00:03:13.250> building<00:03:13.970> one<00:03:14.299> block<00:03:14.540> up

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
then I recommend building one block up

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.849 
then I recommend building one block up
like<00:03:14.959> that<00:03:15.220> but<00:03:16.220> we<00:03:16.340> don't<00:03:16.519> need<00:03:16.639> it<00:03:16.819> so<00:03:17.859> your

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:18.859 
like that but we don't need it so your

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:24.580 
like that but we don't need it so your
input<00:03:19.040> is<00:03:19.459> going<00:03:19.760> to<00:03:19.910> be<00:03:20.239> anywhere<00:03:21.230> on<00:03:22.720> on<00:03:23.720> this

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
input is going to be anywhere on on this

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:29.500 
input is going to be anywhere on on this
wire<00:03:25.340> thing<00:03:26.590> so<00:03:27.590> where<00:03:28.130> I<00:03:28.160> have<00:03:28.430> placed<00:03:28.730> blue

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
wire thing so where I have placed blue

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.039 
wire thing so where I have placed blue
blocks<00:03:30.400> anywhere<00:03:31.400> on<00:03:31.579> those<00:03:31.790> blocks<00:03:32.450> you<00:03:32.870> can

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.049 
blocks anywhere on those blocks you can

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:36.759 
blocks anywhere on those blocks you can
place<00:03:33.290> an<00:03:33.620> input<00:03:34.609> except<00:03:35.540> for<00:03:35.750> those<00:03:35.900> two<00:03:35.959> of

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 
place an input except for those two of

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:40.509 
place an input except for those two of
course<00:03:37.069> and<00:03:38.500> so<00:03:39.500> if<00:03:39.620> we<00:03:39.709> give<00:03:39.889> this<00:03:40.099> a<00:03:40.340> quick

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519
