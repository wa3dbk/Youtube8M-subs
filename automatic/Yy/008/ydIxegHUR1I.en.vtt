00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
see here the red epic dragon want to

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.340 
see here the red epic dragon want to
make<00:00:23.519> sure<00:00:23.550> we<00:00:23.789> got<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.090> right<00:00:24.119> model<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:25.140> red

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
make sure we got the right model the red

make sure we got the right model the red
epic<00:00:25.710> dragon<00:00:26.369> has<00:00:26.550> beat<00:00:26.910> that<00:00:27.119> by<00:00:27.300> a<00:00:27.330> full<00:00:27.810> six

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
epic dragon has beat that by a full six

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.530 
epic dragon has beat that by a full six
points<00:00:28.920> its<00:00:29.580> hit<00:00:29.849> 101<00:00:31.130> so<00:00:32.130> this<00:00:33.090> is<00:00:33.239> pretty

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
points its hit 101 so this is pretty

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.920 
points its hit 101 so this is pretty
revolutionary<00:00:35.030> first<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.210> foremost<00:00:36.450> because

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
revolutionary first and foremost because

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.220 
revolutionary first and foremost because
red<00:00:37.320> epic<00:00:37.590> dragon<00:00:38.100> is<00:00:38.280> a<00:00:38.730> crop<00:00:39.149> sensor<00:00:39.600> body

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
red epic dragon is a crop sensor body

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.180 
red epic dragon is a crop sensor body
it's<00:00:40.620> not<00:00:40.950> full<00:00:41.460> frame<00:00:41.879> like<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.360> DI<00:00:42.570> 800<00:00:43.230> so

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
it's not full frame like the DI 800 so

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.950 
it's not full frame like the DI 800 so
you<00:00:44.250> would<00:00:44.430> think<00:00:44.670> camera<00:00:45.180> like<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.420> d800

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
you would think camera like the d800

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.930 
you would think camera like the d800
full<00:00:46.140> frame<00:00:46.410> wouldn't<00:00:47.190> be<00:00:47.280> able<00:00:47.340> to<00:00:47.489> be<00:00:47.670> beat

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
full frame wouldn't be able to be beat

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.260 
full frame wouldn't be able to be beat
by<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.539> crop<00:00:48.870> sensor<00:00:49.170> body<00:00:49.590> but<00:00:50.129> it<00:00:50.250> has<00:00:50.489> by<00:00:51.239> a

by a crop sensor body but it has by a
full<00:00:51.570> six<00:00:51.899> points<00:00:52.350> too<00:00:52.590> so<00:00:52.949> pretty

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
full six points too so pretty

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.560 
full six points too so pretty
significant<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.899> big<00:00:55.199> thing<00:00:55.590> is<00:00:56.210> low<00:00:57.210> read

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
the d800 it's got record-breaking scores

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.980 
the d800 it's got record-breaking scores
for<00:01:07.590> two<00:01:08.280> main<00:01:08.790> things<00:01:09.119> two<00:01:09.479> big<00:01:09.659> things<00:01:09.810> and

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
that's what's allowed it to push so far

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.469 
that's what's allowed it to push so far
ahead<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:17.009> these<00:01:17.369> are<00:01:17.490> a<00:01:17.520> result<00:01:17.850> of<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.330> low

read<00:01:18.750> noise<00:01:18.960> why<00:01:19.200> we<00:01:19.380> were<00:01:19.439> able<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.650> get<00:01:19.890> such

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
read noise why we were able to get such

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.670 
read noise why we were able to get such
great<00:01:20.869> results<00:01:23.210> so<00:01:24.210> we're<00:01:24.600> six<00:01:24.990> points<00:01:25.530> ahead

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
great results so we're six points ahead

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.480 
great results so we're six points ahead
of<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.729> d800<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:27.829> this<00:01:28.829> is<00:01:28.979> this<00:01:29.159> is<00:01:29.280> pretty

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
of the d800 and this is this is pretty

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.390 
of the d800 and this is this is pretty
revolutionary<00:01:29.850> because<00:01:30.420> as<00:01:30.659> I<00:01:30.810> said<00:01:31.130> the<00:01:32.130> red

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
revolutionary because as I said the red

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.870 
revolutionary because as I said the red
epic<00:01:32.670> dragon<00:01:33.150> is<00:01:33.299> a<00:01:33.360> crop<00:01:33.869> sensor<00:01:34.369> in<00:01:35.369> the

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
epic dragon is a crop sensor in the

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.560 
epic dragon is a crop sensor in the
camera<00:01:36.240> so<00:01:36.720> it's<00:01:36.840> not<00:01:37.049> full<00:01:37.470> frame<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:38.570> what

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
camera so it's not full frame and what

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.530 
camera so it's not full frame and what
this<00:01:39.689> means<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.079> to<00:01:40.890> us<00:01:41.130> to<00:01:41.909> those<00:01:42.240> of<00:01:42.390> us<00:01:42.509> that

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
this means to to us to those of us that

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.050 
this means to to us to those of us that
are<00:01:42.720> using<00:01:43.250> DSLRs<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:44.399> even<00:01:44.610> Micro<00:01:44.880> Four

are using DSLRs and even Micro Four
Thirds<00:01:45.119> is<00:01:45.509> that<00:01:46.350> we<00:01:47.220> now<00:01:47.549> got<00:01:48.000> a<00:01:48.329> less<00:01:48.780> than

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
Thirds is that we now got a less than

and<00:02:10.760> you<00:02:11.760> know<00:02:11.879> this<00:02:12.480> will<00:02:12.720> also<00:02:12.870> allow<00:02:13.140> us<00:02:13.410> to

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
and you know this will also allow us to

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.760 
and you know this will also allow us to
take

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
take

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.910 
take
the<00:02:13.830> megapixels<00:02:14.520> continually<00:02:15.000> up<00:02:15.240> without

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
the megapixels continually up without

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.500 
the megapixels continually up without
negative<00:02:16.920> effects<00:02:17.280> as<00:02:17.460> the<00:02:17.790> technology<00:02:18.000> gets

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
negative effects as the technology gets

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.630 
negative effects as the technology gets
better<00:02:18.630> so<00:02:19.410> not<00:02:19.590> only<00:02:19.710> will<00:02:19.890> we<00:02:19.950> see<00:02:20.190> better

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
better so not only will we see better

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.470 
better so not only will we see better
megapixels<00:02:21.620> counts<00:02:22.790> and<00:02:23.790> some<00:02:24.030> people<00:02:24.300> don't

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
megapixels counts and some people don't

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.360 
megapixels counts and some people don't
like<00:02:24.540> that<00:02:24.840> but<00:02:25.260> we<00:02:25.410> will<00:02:25.590> I'm<00:02:25.830> sure<00:02:25.860> we<00:02:26.190> will

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
like that but we will I'm sure we will

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.590 
like that but we will I'm sure we will
we've<00:02:26.580> been<00:02:26.700> seeing<00:02:26.970> it<00:02:27.150> and<00:02:27.270> it'll<00:02:27.390> keep

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
we've been seeing it and it'll keep

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.050 
we've been seeing it and it'll keep
going<00:02:27.960> on<00:02:28.250> but<00:02:29.250> we're<00:02:29.340> going<00:02:29.460> to<00:02:29.520> see<00:02:29.730> better

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
going on but we're going to see better

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.270 
going on but we're going to see better
characteristics<00:02:31.050> better<00:02:31.560> noise

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
characteristics better noise

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.970 
characteristics better noise
characteristics<00:02:32.850> better<00:02:33.750> color<00:02:34.080> depth<00:02:34.410> but<00:02:34.950> a

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
characteristics better color depth but a

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.180 
characteristics better color depth but a
dynamic<00:02:35.550> range<00:02:35.850> out<00:02:36.450> of<00:02:36.900> crop<00:02:37.290> sensors<00:02:37.710> so<00:02:38.010> for

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
dynamic range out of crop sensors so for

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.860 
dynamic range out of crop sensors so for
those<00:02:38.280> of<00:02:38.340> us<00:02:38.580> that<00:02:38.790> are<00:02:39.150> using<00:02:39.480> crop<00:02:39.690> sensor

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
those of us that are using crop sensor

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.290 
those of us that are using crop sensor
bodies<00:02:40.410> and<00:02:40.640> even<00:02:41.640> full-frame<00:02:41.970> bodies

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
bodies and even full-frame bodies

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.270 
bodies and even full-frame bodies
because<00:02:42.510> this<00:02:42.630> will<00:02:42.780> obviously<00:02:43.160> translate<00:02:44.160> to

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
because this will obviously translate to

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.540 
because this will obviously translate to
that<00:02:44.400> as<00:02:44.580> well<00:02:45.590> but<00:02:46.590> you'll<00:02:47.190> be<00:02:47.250> able<00:02:47.340> to<00:02:47.430> get

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
that as well but you'll be able to get

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.200 
that as well but you'll be able to get
better<00:02:47.820> and<00:02:48.120> better<00:02:49.340> results<00:02:50.340> out<00:02:50.430> of<00:02:50.820> the

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210 
better and better results out of the

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:52.940 
better and better results out of the
lower<00:02:51.420> price<00:02:51.750> bodies<00:02:52.170> i<00:02:52.200> mean<00:02:52.350> i'm<00:02:52.620> shooting

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
lower price bodies i mean i'm shooting

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
5300 is one of the best bodies out there

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.230 
5300 is one of the best bodies out there
for<00:02:59.160> a<00:02:59.190> DSLR<00:02:59.700> to<00:03:00.270> shoot<00:03:01.370> video<00:03:02.370> just<00:03:02.880> go<00:03:03.030> have<00:03:03.150> a

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 
for a DSLR to shoot video just go have a

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.150 
for a DSLR to shoot video just go have a
look<00:03:03.390> at<00:03:03.510> the<00:03:03.630> EOS<00:03:04.020> HD<00:03:04.440> ratings<00:03:04.830> you'd<00:03:05.040> be

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
look at the EOS HD ratings you'd be

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.790 
look at the EOS HD ratings you'd be
surprised<00:03:05.670> how<00:03:06.000> high<00:03:06.330> it<00:03:06.390> rates<00:03:06.750> better<00:03:07.560> than

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
surprised how high it rates better than

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.560 
surprised how high it rates better than
a<00:03:07.830> lot<00:03:08.070> of<00:03:08.190> other<00:03:08.310> cameras<00:03:08.760> you<00:03:08.880> thought<00:03:09.180> would

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
a lot of other cameras you thought would

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.410 
a lot of other cameras you thought would
have<00:03:09.690> beat<00:03:09.810> it<00:03:10.100> and<00:03:11.100> now<00:03:11.400> we<00:03:12.210> have<00:03:12.330> the

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
have beat it and now we have the

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.110 
have beat it and now we have the
potential<00:03:12.720> for<00:03:12.930> them<00:03:13.110> to<00:03:13.230> get<00:03:13.350> even<00:03:13.620> better<00:03:14.130> so

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
potential for them to get even better so

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.150 
potential for them to get even better so
what<00:03:15.480> do<00:03:15.570> you<00:03:15.630> think<00:03:15.780> folks<00:03:16.020> is<00:03:16.590> this<00:03:16.710> exciting

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
what do you think folks is this exciting

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.750 
what do you think folks is this exciting
for<00:03:17.340> you<00:03:18.020> it<00:03:19.020> should<00:03:19.260> be<00:03:19.290> I<00:03:19.620> think<00:03:20.040> because<00:03:20.610> you

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
for you it should be I think because you

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.930 
for you it should be I think because you
know<00:03:20.790> the<00:03:21.030> promise<00:03:21.450> of<00:03:21.600> better<00:03:21.810> and<00:03:22.080> better<00:03:22.260> at

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
know the promise of better and better at

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.240 
know the promise of better and better at
lower<00:03:23.940> prices<00:03:24.270> in<00:03:24.660> our<00:03:24.810> lower<00:03:24.990> end<00:03:25.200> cameras<00:03:25.620> so

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
lower prices in our lower end cameras so

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.890 
lower prices in our lower end cameras so
let<00:03:26.970> me<00:03:27.030> know<00:03:27.120> what<00:03:27.209> you<00:03:27.270> think<00:03:27.420> these<00:03:27.690> some
