00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.509
Is designed with great attention to the balance, like the one that combines the elegant design

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:33.570
to the comfort. Aboard the Subaru Forester we immediately notice the attention

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.110
to details, and the high visibility, ensured by a raised position, makes the

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:45.100
driving experience easier and safer. So the feeling is to have everything under control.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.649
The engine is a 2.0 diesel 4-cylinder turbocharged

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:55.000
that delivers 147 HP and ensures an uncommon stability for a SUV.

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:10.909
Together with Porsche, Subaru is the brand famous for its boxer engine technology, characterized by the horizontally

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:16.460
opposed cylinders. With the engine flat and positioned lower on the frame, the car is more

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.689
balanced and less sensitive to external stresses than other models.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.500
Is designed to offer ample space but especially to go anywhere.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.580
Although, unlike the

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:35.040
petrol version, does not have the low range, off the road gets along very well thanks

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.000
to the valid all wheel drive and to the good ground clearance.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.100
In short, it is an SUV that

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.000
is inspired by the true off-road, not only in the aesthetics.
