00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.380
 plus 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:12.590

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:14.269
 I am hat 65 and so from some 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:17.570
 video tutorial how to change then of 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:20.210
 color the internet windows good of 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.760
 any window on your computer that 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.010
 change it to the color you want by having 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.880
 windows starter 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:31.010
 be something like this is born how it is pronounced 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.410
 but good the air that they were going to be able 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:35.840
 change the color of your taskbar and 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.520
 of their websites first 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.530
 what we are going to have to do is go to 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.530
 the page this internet page that I 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.060
 to explain it 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:58.610
 and here they will have to wait 10 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.610
 seconds for propaganda to pass 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.130
 to 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.549
 and will send us mediafire download the 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:14.130
 file weighs nothing more 308 kilobytes not 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.710
 it's a lot but what we have to do 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.899
 to not feel envy those who have 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.399
 No 2 professional or 8 we are 

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:23.100
 unfortunate those of us who have 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:25.200
 windows starter but it does not matter we have 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.450
 computers that's what's important 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.450
 ok I do not download because I already have it 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.640
 they will keep what will appear 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.400
 where you downloaded it 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:42.830
 good panel customization something like this 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:46.100
 the idea is that they are going to extract it and 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:49.180
 a password will appear 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.180
 which is 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.939
 and full juanero have to write what 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:59.790
 I counted a capital letter at the beginning if not 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:02.020
 the password will work 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.530
 he came to extract it 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.750
 and an icon will appear like 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:11.230
 then customize a screen will 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:15.760
 double click on that or they can give you 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:18.519
 in open with winrar file and they give 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:22.000
 double click here and enter the password and 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:24.010
 they are installed automatically ok a 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.319
 Once we have that on the desk 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.269
 let's give it right click and go to 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:31.330
 it seems they are going to see that a 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:33.950
 new icon that says customized 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.020
 let's click there 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:39.490
 and they will see 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.490
 this have to 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:45.010
 and well if the first one does not work 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.530
 to be able to see this icon 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:50.050
 must have the windows good the theme 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:53.140
 it's from windows aero should be of 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:55.020
 put what already comes with starter and then 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.930
 good will disappear this 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:01.530
 they click on it and if this does not appear 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:05.670
 is in this panel, they have to 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:07.500
 restart your computer and at the time of 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:12.030
 that they give in personalization 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:14.580
 will appear and then choose the color that 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:17.490
 more like it, I did not put it in black 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.450
 how I put it in black in hide mixtures 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:20.610
 of colors 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.700
 Well, I'm going to show you the color 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:25.830
 that they want and the shine they lower it to everything 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:28.780
 intensity of color equal to everything and 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:33.280
 can enable transparency 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:37.150
