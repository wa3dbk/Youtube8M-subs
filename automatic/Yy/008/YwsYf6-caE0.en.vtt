00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:11.660 
was able to find these because

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.120 
was able to find these because
wonderswan<00:05:12.660> games<00:05:13.020> are<00:05:13.200> not<00:05:13.320> very<00:05:13.680> easy<00:05:13.950> to

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.130 
wonderswan games are not very easy to

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.490 
wonderswan games are not very easy to
find<00:05:14.280> a<00:05:14.790> lot<00:05:15.480> of<00:05:15.570> places<00:05:15.750> don't<00:05:16.050> sell<00:05:16.350> them

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
find a lot of places don't sell them

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.770 
find a lot of places don't sell them
anymore<00:05:16.710> they're<00:05:17.640> kind<00:05:17.880> of<00:05:18.000> just<00:05:18.060> written<00:05:18.540> off

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780 
anymore they're kind of just written off

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.830 
anymore they're kind of just written off
they're<00:05:19.140> no<00:05:20.130> longer<00:05:20.280> on<00:05:20.460> the<00:05:20.640> market<00:05:21.030> you<00:05:21.720> can

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 
they're no longer on the market you can

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.240 
they're no longer on the market you can
probably<00:05:22.080> find<00:05:22.290> him<00:05:22.440> in<00:05:22.530> some<00:05:22.680> auctions<00:05:23.100> and

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
probably find him in some auctions and

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.850 
probably find him in some auctions and
stuff<00:05:23.490> but<00:05:23.790> still<00:05:24.480> I<00:05:24.750> was<00:05:25.110> able<00:05:25.380> to<00:05:25.410> run<00:05:25.560> across

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 
stuff but still I was able to run across

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.130 
stuff but still I was able to run across
these<00:05:26.130> here<00:05:26.550> and<00:05:26.730> I<00:05:27.180> decided<00:05:27.570> to<00:05:27.690> pick<00:05:27.840> them<00:05:27.990> up

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:28.140 
these here and I decided to pick them up

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:30.230 
these here and I decided to pick them up
so<00:05:28.290> I<00:05:28.860> thought<00:05:29.430> those<00:05:29.610> might<00:05:29.760> be<00:05:29.940> kind<00:05:30.120> of<00:05:30.180> cool

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
so I thought those might be kind of cool

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.930 
so I thought those might be kind of cool
to<00:05:30.360> add<00:05:30.600> to<00:05:30.780> the<00:05:30.870> old<00:05:31.020> collection<00:05:31.470> but<00:05:32.160> figured

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 
to add to the old collection but figured

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:34.730 
to add to the old collection but figured
that<00:05:33.120> I<00:05:33.360> put<00:05:33.540> up<00:05:33.630> a<00:05:33.720> lot<00:05:33.870> of<00:05:34.020> cultural<00:05:34.380> videos

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
that I put up a lot of cultural videos

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.110 
that I put up a lot of cultural videos
