00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
so we'll let it slide for now so at this

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:09.250 
so we'll let it slide for now so at this
point<00:03:06.230> I<00:03:06.500> mean<00:03:06.920> there's<00:03:07.820> not<00:03:07.940> too<00:03:08.269> much<00:03:08.450> too

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
much there to differentiate between the

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.380 
much there to differentiate between the
two<00:03:12.109> all<00:03:12.799> right<00:03:12.950> i<00:03:12.980> use<00:03:13.280> the<00:03:13.430> RPG<00:03:13.880> more<00:03:14.090> he's

lets then go to some of the metals right

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:23.890 
lets then go to some of the metals right
i<00:03:22.069> mean<00:03:22.190> i<00:03:22.730> went<00:03:23.000> over<00:03:23.090> you<00:03:23.540> know<00:03:23.630> how<00:03:23.750> many

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
i mean i went over you know how many

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.590 
i mean i went over you know how many
models<00:03:24.170> /<00:03:24.350> match<00:03:24.470> we<00:03:24.680> get<00:03:25.239> let's<00:03:26.239> look<00:03:26.329> at<00:03:26.480> some

models / match we get let's look at some

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.259 
models / match we get let's look at some
of<00:03:26.660> the<00:03:26.780> tougher<00:03:27.079> metals<00:03:27.350> to<00:03:27.440> get

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269 
of the tougher metals to get

of the tougher metals to get
specifically<00:03:29.269> the<00:03:29.569> rampant<00:03:30.109> rage<00:03:30.680> and<00:03:30.980> fury

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
specifically the rampant rage and fury

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:36.610 
specifically the rampant rage and fury
metals<00:03:31.790> now<00:03:32.359> we<00:03:32.420> both<00:03:32.769> got<00:03:33.769> some<00:03:34.359> so<00:03:35.359> as<00:03:35.690> far<00:03:36.560> as

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
metals now we both got some so as far as

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.490 
metals now we both got some so as far as
the<00:03:37.130> metals<00:03:37.459> go<00:03:37.750> king<00:03:38.750> is<00:03:38.900> coming<00:03:39.109> through

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
the metals go king is coming through

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.930 
the metals go king is coming through
with<00:03:40.100> a<00:03:40.340> rampant<00:03:41.000> at<00:03:41.209> nine<00:03:42.190> thousandth<00:03:43.190> of<00:03:43.310> a

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
with a rampant at nine thousandth of a

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.569 
with a rampant at nine thousandth of a
percentage<00:03:44.480> in<00:03:44.720> his<00:03:45.260> matches<00:03:45.799> so<00:03:46.340> that's<00:03:46.519> the

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:46.579 
percentage in his matches so that's the

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:49.479 
percentage in his matches so that's the
chances<00:03:47.000> at<00:03:47.120> this<00:03:47.269> time<00:03:48.340> there<00:03:49.340> is<00:03:49.370> a

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489 
chances at this time there is a

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:50.920 
chances at this time there is a
one-percent<00:03:50.090> chance<00:03:50.150> he's<00:03:50.600> going<00:03:50.720> to<00:03:50.780> get<00:03:50.870> a

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
one-percent chance he's going to get a

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.020 
one-percent chance he's going to get a
rage<00:03:51.200> that<00:03:51.889> seven<00:03:52.250> percent<00:03:52.609> chance<00:03:52.819> he's

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
rage that seven percent chance he's

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.390 
rage that seven percent chance he's
going<00:03:53.120> to<00:03:53.180> get<00:03:53.299> a<00:03:53.359> fury<00:03:53.660> and<00:03:54.470> that's<00:03:55.040> based<00:03:55.250> on

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
going to get a fury and that's based on

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.949 
going to get a fury and that's based on
how<00:03:55.579> many<00:03:55.639> he's<00:03:55.880> gotten<00:03:56.239> within<00:03:56.480> the<00:03:56.660> matches

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
how many he's gotten within the matches

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:02.129 
how many he's gotten within the matches
he's<00:03:57.109> played<00:03:57.319> so<00:03:57.530> far<00:03:58.930> currently<00:03:59.930> there<00:04:00.290> is<00:04:00.319> a

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:02.139 
he's played so far currently there is a

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:05.770 
he's played so far currently there is a
0.03<00:04:03.139> percent<00:04:03.170> I'll<00:04:03.650> get<00:04:03.799> a<00:04:03.829> rampant<00:04:04.780> two

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
0.03 percent I'll get a rampant two

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.090 
0.03 percent I'll get a rampant two
percent<00:04:06.109> chance<00:04:06.290> i'll<00:04:06.500> get<00:04:06.620> a<00:04:06.650> rage<00:04:06.859> in<00:04:07.010> a

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.100 
percent chance i'll get a rage in a

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.559 
percent chance i'll get a rage in a
13-percent<00:04:07.819> again<00:04:08.060> get<00:04:08.239> a<00:04:08.269> fury

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:10.569 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:14.550 

so<00:04:11.469> based<00:04:11.890> on<00:04:12.040> that<00:04:12.870> chances<00:04:13.870> are<00:04:14.049> i'm<00:04:14.290> going

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
so based on that chances are i'm going

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.780 
so based on that chances are i'm going
to<00:04:14.620> be<00:04:14.680> going<00:04:14.769> on<00:04:15.010> in<00:04:15.129> more<00:04:15.310> streaks<00:04:15.579> on<00:04:15.760> a

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
to be going on in more streaks on a

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.729
