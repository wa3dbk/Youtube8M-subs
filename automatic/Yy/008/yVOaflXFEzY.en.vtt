12<00:02:08.989> items<00:02:09.470> now<00:02:09.979> so<00:02:10.940> you<00:02:11.780> could<00:02:11.900> just<00:02:11.959> keep<00:02:12.230> on

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
12 items now so you could just keep on

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.110 
12 items now so you could just keep on
doing<00:02:12.709> it<00:02:12.800> as<00:02:12.920> many<00:02:13.100> times<00:02:13.190> as<00:02:13.520> you<00:02:13.670> want

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.250 
doing it as many times as you want
yeah<00:02:14.720> my<00:02:15.500> advice<00:02:15.890> would<00:02:16.459> be<00:02:16.520> not<00:02:17.270> to<00:02:17.660> get<00:02:17.989> items

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
yeah my advice would be not to get items

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.490 
yeah my advice would be not to get items
over<00:02:19.209> 99<00:02:20.209> because<00:02:20.569> the<00:02:20.810> way<00:02:20.930> they<00:02:21.050> program<00:02:21.380> the

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
over 99 because the way they program the

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.500 
over 99 because the way they program the
game<00:02:21.650> it's<00:02:21.920> as<00:02:22.010> much<00:02:22.220> as<00:02:22.340> you<00:02:22.430> can<00:02:22.550> have<00:02:22.760> and

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
game it's as much as you can have and

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.949 
game it's as much as you can have and
you<00:02:23.840> might<00:02:24.110> ruin<00:02:24.350> your<00:02:24.530> save<00:02:24.739> file<00:02:25.040> yeah

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959
