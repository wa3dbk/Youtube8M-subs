00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
on it though look at that first thing I

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.620 
on it though look at that first thing I
probably<00:01:08.580> do<00:01:08.760> is<00:01:08.850> go<00:01:08.970> ahead<00:01:09.030> and<00:01:09.180> exchange<00:01:09.300> out

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
probably do is go ahead and exchange out

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.540 
probably do is go ahead and exchange out
the<00:01:09.780> exhaust<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:10.830> make<00:01:10.950> a<00:01:10.980> little<00:01:11.190> bit<00:01:11.400> deeper

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:11.550
