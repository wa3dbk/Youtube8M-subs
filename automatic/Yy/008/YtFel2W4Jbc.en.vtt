one to one scale so yeah the parts are

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.459 
one to one scale so yeah the parts are
scattered<00:02:00.210> throughout<00:02:00.719> this<00:02:00.960> little<00:02:01.229> box

people to gain one two three ardan Oh

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.270 
people to gain one two three ardan Oh
tons<00:03:04.140> of<00:03:04.380> them<00:03:04.500> enough<00:03:04.739> to<00:03:04.830> make<00:03:04.950> a<00:03:04.980> small

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280

excellent

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
excellent

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.190 
excellent
so<00:03:42.450> this<00:03:42.600> set<00:03:42.840> of<00:03:42.870> candy<00:03:43.590> toys<00:03:43.829> retailed<00:03:44.579> for

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
so this set of candy toys retailed for

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.720 
so this set of candy toys retailed for
something<00:03:46.200> like<00:03:46.760> 2200<00:03:47.760> yen<00:03:49.250> which<00:03:50.250> isn't<00:03:50.459> too

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
something like 2200 yen which isn't too

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.039 
something like 2200 yen which isn't too
bad<00:03:51.769> the<00:03:52.769> eyes<00:03:53.069> are<00:03:53.730> painted<00:03:54.060> a<00:03:54.389> gold<00:03:54.720> color

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
bad the eyes are painted a gold color

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:58.550 
bad the eyes are painted a gold color
rather<00:03:55.290> than<00:03:55.590> yellow<00:03:55.980> and<00:03:56.900> I<00:03:57.900> didn't<00:03:58.230> see<00:03:58.380> any

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
rather than yellow and I didn't see any

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.569 
rather than yellow and I didn't see any
other<00:03:58.859> paint<00:03:59.459> spills<00:04:00.120> or<00:04:00.720> anything<00:04:00.900> like<00:04:01.170> that

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:01.579 
other paint spills or anything like that

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:06.620 
other paint spills or anything like that
so<00:04:02.579> the<00:04:02.730> quality<00:04:02.940> is<00:04:04.100> overall<00:04:05.100> very<00:04:05.400> good<00:04:05.630> you

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
so the quality is overall very good you

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.539 
so the quality is overall very good you
see<00:04:06.780> the<00:04:06.900> different<00:04:07.200> shades<00:04:07.410> of<00:04:07.530> grey<00:04:07.980> or<00:04:08.010> kind

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:08.549 
see the different shades of grey or kind

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:11.569 
see the different shades of grey or kind
of<00:04:08.609> cream<00:04:09.090> and<00:04:09.480> tan<00:04:09.900> as<00:04:10.290> well<00:04:10.579> which

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:11.579 
of cream and tan as well which

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:13.460 
of cream and tan as well which
replicates<00:04:11.880> the<00:04:12.540> different<00:04:12.900> shades<00:04:13.230> we<00:04:13.440> have

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
replicates the different shades we have

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.090 
replicates the different shades we have
on<00:04:13.709> the<00:04:13.799> real<00:04:14.010> grade<00:04:15.169> when<00:04:16.169> I<00:04:16.260> say<00:04:16.410> real<00:04:16.680> grader

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
on the real grade when I say real grader

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.319 
on the real grade when I say real grader
that's<00:04:17.459> what<00:04:17.609> they<00:04:17.729> referred<00:04:18.060> to<00:04:18.090> the

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.329 
that's what they referred to the

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:20.870 
that's what they referred to the
one-to-one<00:04:18.750> scale<00:04:18.959> as<00:04:19.290> well

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
one-to-one scale as well

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:26.370 
one-to-one scale as well
so<00:04:21.880> paint<00:04:22.090> apps<00:04:22.620> very<00:04:23.620> good<00:04:24.010> and<00:04:24.990> the<00:04:25.990> building

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
so paint apps very good and the building

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:27.900 
so paint apps very good and the building
experience<00:04:26.950> is<00:04:27.070> a<00:04:27.100> lot<00:04:27.250> of<00:04:27.400> fun<00:04:27.580> as<00:04:27.700> well<00:04:27.730> as

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
experience is a lot of fun as well as

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.290 
experience is a lot of fun as well as
pretty<00:04:28.810> much<00:04:29.020> like<00:04:29.200> assembling<00:04:29.710> a<00:04:29.860> Gunpla<00:04:30.550> but

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
pretty much like assembling a Gunpla but

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.340 
pretty much like assembling a Gunpla but
with<00:04:31.540> all<00:04:31.660> the<00:04:31.810> parts<00:04:32.110> pre<00:04:32.590> painted<00:04:32.860> and

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
with all the parts pre painted and

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:38.700 
with all the parts pre painted and
already<00:04:35.350> separated<00:04:35.860> from<00:04:36.280> the<00:04:36.460> sprue<00:04:37.590> all<00:04:38.590> you

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
already separated from the sprue all you

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.820 
already separated from the sprue all you
need<00:04:38.890> a<00:04:38.920> fingers<00:04:40.560> there's<00:04:41.560> no<00:04:41.680> real

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
need a fingers there's no real

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.500 
need a fingers there's no real
articulation<00:04:42.610> and<00:04:42.730> this<00:04:42.940> but<00:04:43.120> this<00:04:43.240> is<00:04:43.360> the

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:43.510 
articulation and this but this is the

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.300 
articulation and this but this is the
perfect<00:04:43.780> pose<00:04:44.290> that<00:04:44.620> you<00:04:44.680> should<00:04:44.860> have<00:04:45.010> him<00:04:45.160> in

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.310 
perfect pose that you should have him in

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:51.660 
perfect pose that you should have him in
anyway<00:04:45.670> so<00:04:46.860> no<00:04:47.860> complaints<00:04:48.280> there<00:04:50.670> slice

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:51.670 
anyway so no complaints there slice

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:57.570 
anyway so no complaints there slice

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:28.630 
makes a very nice desk ornament one that

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:31.530 
makes a very nice desk ornament one that
you<00:05:28.720> build<00:05:29.020> yourself<00:05:29.820> much<00:05:30.820> in<00:05:31.000> the<00:05:31.090> same<00:05:31.330> way

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:31.540 
you build yourself much in the same way

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:35.550 
you build yourself much in the same way
as<00:05:31.840> they<00:05:32.260> built<00:05:32.560> the<00:05:33.310> one-to-one<00:05:33.640> scale<00:05:34.560> it's

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:35.560 
as they built the one-to-one scale it's

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.640 
as they built the one-to-one scale it's
a<00:05:35.620> nice<00:05:35.800> concept<00:05:36.100> and<00:05:37.090> if<00:05:37.300> they'll<00:05:37.540> have<00:05:38.470> one

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:38.650 
a nice concept and if they'll have one

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:40.440 
a nice concept and if they'll have one
for<00:05:38.890> the<00:05:38.980> ODE<00:05:39.100> diver<00:05:39.400> site<00:05:39.850> as<00:05:40.060> well<00:05:40.240> it

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:40.450 
for the ODE diver site as well it

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:41.520 
for the ODE diver site as well it
doesn't<00:05:40.720> seem<00:05:40.840> to<00:05:40.930> have<00:05:40.990> the<00:05:41.050> pick<00:05:41.320> being

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:41.530 
doesn't seem to have the pick being

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:44.960 
doesn't seem to have the pick being
safer<00:05:42.070> which<00:05:42.220> is<00:05:42.370> a<00:05:42.400> shame

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:44.970 

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:51.330 

so<00:05:45.970> that's<00:05:46.180> your<00:05:46.330> lot<00:05:47.280> until<00:05:48.280> next<00:05:48.850> time
