00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:03.129 
you in a few hours just want to let you

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:05.670 
you in a few hours just want to let you
know<00:01:03.280> my<00:01:03.520> own<00:01:03.699> expectation<00:01:04.660> my<00:01:04.869> prediction<00:01:05.560> I

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
know my own expectation my prediction I

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.109 
know my own expectation my prediction I
think<00:01:06.190> the<00:01:06.250> ulema<00:01:06.460> crime<00:01:06.670> is<00:01:06.790> gonna<00:01:06.970> last

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:07.119 
think the ulema crime is gonna last

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:09.090 
think the ulema crime is gonna last
longer<00:01:07.390> because<00:01:07.630> it<00:01:08.020> is<00:01:08.110> obviously<00:01:08.680> meant<00:01:08.950> to

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
longer because it is obviously meant to

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.580 
longer because it is obviously meant to
us<00:01:09.250> a<00:01:09.490> long<00:01:09.670> time<00:01:09.940> it<00:01:10.210> is<00:01:10.540> a<00:01:10.570> liquid<00:01:10.899> lipstick

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
us a long time it is a liquid lipstick

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.219 
us a long time it is a liquid lipstick
that<00:01:11.860> I<00:01:12.100> almost<00:01:12.369> feel<00:01:12.759> like<00:01:12.820> I<00:01:13.210> don't<00:01:13.930> want<00:01:14.170> to

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:14.229 
that I almost feel like I don't want to

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:15.749 
that I almost feel like I don't want to
say<00:01:14.380> paint<00:01:14.740> but<00:01:15.009> it's<00:01:15.190> pretty<00:01:15.369> much<00:01:15.550> where<00:01:15.729> it

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:15.759 
say paint but it's pretty much where it

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:18.210 
say paint but it's pretty much where it
is<00:01:15.910> because<00:01:16.060> it<00:01:16.450> because<00:01:16.660> it<00:01:17.320> is<00:01:17.440> so<00:01:17.680> liquidy

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 
is because it because it is so liquidy

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.880 
is because it because it is so liquidy
so<00:01:19.030> yeah<00:01:19.600> basically<00:01:19.899> I<00:01:20.140> think<00:01:20.440> this<00:01:20.590> one<00:01:20.770> will

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
so yeah basically I think this one will

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.889 
so yeah basically I think this one will
last<00:01:21.070> longer<00:01:21.340> because<00:01:21.700> D<00:01:22.000> NYX<00:01:22.540> soft<00:01:22.690> matte<00:01:22.810> lip

00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:22.899 
last longer because D NYX soft matte lip

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:24.960 
last longer because D NYX soft matte lip
cream<00:01:23.080> it's<00:01:23.530> kind<00:01:23.710> of<00:01:23.740> more<00:01:24.190> of<00:01:24.340> a<00:01:24.430> creamy

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 
cream it's kind of more of a creamy

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.779 
cream it's kind of more of a creamy
moosie<00:01:25.720> formula<00:01:26.440> so<00:01:26.619> it's<00:01:26.770> more<00:01:26.920> moisturizing

00:01:27.779 --> 00:01:27.789 
moosie formula so it's more moisturizing

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:30.330 
moosie formula so it's more moisturizing
they're<00:01:28.390> both<00:01:28.570> dry<00:01:28.869> now<00:01:29.110> and<00:01:29.380> you<00:01:30.039> can<00:01:30.190> see

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
they're both dry now and you can see

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.910 
they're both dry now and you can see
this<00:01:30.430> one's<00:01:30.640> a<00:01:30.700> little<00:01:30.759> bit<00:01:30.940> orange<00:01:31.750> here<00:01:32.110> but

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
this one's a little bit orange here but

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.070 
this one's a little bit orange here but
I<00:01:33.430> don't<00:01:33.640> know<00:01:33.700> we'll<00:01:34.060> see<00:01:34.270> how<00:01:34.300> it<00:01:34.630> goes<00:01:34.810> maybe

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
I don't know we'll see how it goes maybe

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.930 
I don't know we'll see how it goes maybe
I<00:01:35.259> will<00:01:35.500> be<00:01:35.619> surprised<00:01:36.009> maybe<00:01:36.310> my<00:01:36.610> lips<00:01:36.789> are

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:36.940 
I will be surprised maybe my lips are

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.609 
I will be surprised maybe my lips are
going<00:01:37.060> to<00:01:37.149> be<00:01:37.240> less<00:01:37.509> dry<00:01:37.720> on<00:01:37.869> this<00:01:38.050> side<00:01:38.289> so

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:38.619 
going to be less dry on this side so

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:40.469 
going to be less dry on this side so
we'll<00:01:39.369> see<00:01:39.550> in<00:01:39.610> a<00:01:39.640> few<00:01:39.670> hours<00:01:40.119> and<00:01:40.270> I<00:01:40.360> will

the drier side would be the one with the

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.339 
the drier side would be the one with the
NYX<00:01:56.500> soft<00:01:57.310> matte<00:01:57.429> lip<00:01:57.550> cream<00:01:57.759> you<00:01:58.720> can<00:01:58.929> kind<00:01:59.289> of

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:27.849 
virtually anything so it is pretty much

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:30.570 
virtually anything so it is pretty much
kissy<00:02:28.390> proof<00:02:28.660> but<00:02:29.319> if<00:02:29.620> you<00:02:29.890> swatch<00:02:30.190> it<00:02:30.340> on<00:02:30.430> your

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
kissy proof but if you swatch it on your

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.720 
kissy proof but if you swatch it on your
ends<00:02:31.000> and<00:02:31.180> use<00:02:32.050> eat<00:02:32.319> dry<00:02:32.709> baby<00:02:32.920> why<00:02:33.099> so<00:02:33.280> on<00:02:33.459> top

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
ends and use eat dry baby why so on top

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.880 
ends and use eat dry baby why so on top
there<00:02:33.970> see<00:02:34.209> lime<00:02:34.420> creme<00:02:34.660> 1<00:02:34.870> and<00:02:35.140> on<00:02:35.410> the<00:02:35.470> bottom

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
there see lime creme 1 and on the bottom

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.460 
there see lime creme 1 and on the bottom
it<00:02:36.099> is<00:02:36.160> deep<00:02:36.550> mix<00:02:36.910> of<00:02:37.209> my<00:02:37.330> lip<00:02:37.540> cream<00:02:37.810> so<00:02:38.080> I<00:02:38.260> will

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
it is deep mix of my lip cream so I will

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.440 
it is deep mix of my lip cream so I will
just<00:02:38.680> try<00:02:39.370> and<00:02:39.520> remove<00:02:39.790> them<00:02:40.000> it<00:02:40.239> is<00:02:40.390> dry<00:02:40.630> so<00:02:42.450> so

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
just try and remove them it is dry so so

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.320 
just try and remove them it is dry so so
I<00:02:43.810> think<00:02:44.110> you<00:02:44.170> can<00:02:44.319> see<00:02:44.680> the<00:02:45.549> soft

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
I think you can see the soft

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.810 
I think you can see the soft
pretty<00:02:47.170> much<00:02:47.320> completely<00:02:47.770> disappeared<00:02:48.610> and

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
pretty much completely disappeared and

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.900 
pretty much completely disappeared and
if<00:02:49.750> I<00:02:49.900> tried<00:02:50.200> a<00:02:50.230> lime<00:02:50.560> crime<00:02:50.890> it<00:02:51.880> stays<00:02:52.810> like

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
if I tried a lime crime it stays like

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.670 
if I tried a lime crime it stays like
I'm<00:02:54.910> robbing<00:02:55.420> really<00:02:55.870> really<00:02:56.140> hard<00:02:56.410> and

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
I'm robbing really really hard and

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.940 
I'm robbing really really hard and
there's<00:02:57.220> just<00:02:57.460> barely<00:02:57.760> something<00:02:58.510> going<00:02:59.320> away

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
there's just barely something going away

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.030 
there's just barely something going away
so<00:03:00.420> we<00:03:01.420> have<00:03:01.510> our<00:03:01.630> answer<00:03:01.660> for<00:03:02.200> that<00:03:02.230> so<00:03:02.740> now

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
so we have our answer for that so now

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.550 
so we have our answer for that so now
I'm<00:03:03.220> up<00:03:03.370> to<00:03:03.430> eating<00:03:04.090> and<00:03:04.420> you<00:03:04.960> will<00:03:05.110> see<00:03:05.350> after

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
I'm up to eating and you will see after

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.590 
I'm up to eating and you will see after
if<00:03:05.980> it<00:03:06.130> stays<00:03:06.430> on<00:03:06.460> my<00:03:06.670> lips<00:03:06.850> or<00:03:07.090> not<00:03:07.270> so<00:03:07.450> it's

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
if it stays on my lips or not so it's

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.810 
if it stays on my lips or not so it's
been<00:03:07.750> an<00:03:07.870> hour<00:03:08.020> and<00:03:08.380> I<00:03:08.740> just<00:03:08.980> had<00:03:09.160> some<00:03:09.400> food<00:03:09.640> I

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
been an hour and I just had some food I

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.700 
been an hour and I just had some food I
just<00:03:09.850> had<00:03:10.120> some<00:03:10.300> spaghetti<00:03:10.720> so<00:03:11.020> I<00:03:11.050> thought<00:03:11.410> you

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:11.710 
just had some spaghetti so I thought you

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:14.640 
just had some spaghetti so I thought you
know<00:03:11.740> it<00:03:12.070> would<00:03:12.190> really<00:03:12.220> test<00:03:12.790> a<00:03:13.060> lipstick<00:03:13.650> so

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
know it would really test a lipstick so

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.860 
know it would really test a lipstick so
as<00:03:15.070> you<00:03:15.340> can<00:03:15.490> see<00:03:15.550> well<00:03:16.360> I<00:03:16.390> don't<00:03:16.660> know<00:03:16.720> if<00:03:16.780> you

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
as you can see well I don't know if you

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.420 
as you can see well I don't know if you
can<00:03:17.050> see<00:03:17.230> but<00:03:18.390> the<00:03:19.390> boat<00:03:19.920> got<00:03:20.920> affected

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
can see but the boat got affected

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.670 
can see but the boat got affected
obviously<00:03:22.060> a<00:03:22.270> little<00:03:22.690> bit<00:03:22.900> more<00:03:23.170> on<00:03:23.350> D<00:03:23.470> next

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
obviously a little bit more on D next

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.800 
obviously a little bit more on D next
side<00:03:23.950> like<00:03:24.280> there's<00:03:24.490> a<00:03:24.580> lot<00:03:24.820> less<00:03:25.120> on<00:03:25.390> the

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
side like there's a lot less on the

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.940 
side like there's a lot less on the
inner<00:03:26.590> lip<00:03:27.959> but<00:03:28.959> it's<00:03:29.170> not<00:03:29.410> as<00:03:29.530> bad<00:03:29.740> as<00:03:29.890> I

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
inner lip but it's not as bad as I

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.350 
inner lip but it's not as bad as I
thought<00:03:29.980> it<00:03:30.220> would<00:03:30.310> be<00:03:30.520> but<00:03:30.760> you<00:03:31.209> would

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
thought it would be but you would

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.449 
thought it would be but you would
obviously<00:03:31.600> need<00:03:32.290> to<00:03:32.490> touch<00:03:33.490> up<00:03:33.700> for<00:03:33.970> both<00:03:34.120> side

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
obviously need to touch up for both side

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:38.220 
obviously need to touch up for both side
you<00:03:36.459> probably<00:03:36.730> could<00:03:37.030> get<00:03:37.209> away<00:03:37.330> with<00:03:37.630> it<00:03:37.840> the

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
you probably could get away with it the

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.520 
you probably could get away with it the
line<00:03:38.830> creme<00:03:39.040> side<00:03:39.310> but<00:03:39.720> not<00:03:40.720> the<00:03:40.900> neck<00:03:41.050> side<00:03:41.320> I

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
line creme side but not the neck side I

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.100 
line creme side but not the neck side I
would<00:03:41.950> have<00:03:42.070> to<00:03:42.250> retouch<00:03:42.550> so<00:03:43.420> basically<00:03:43.900> they

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.110 
would have to retouch so basically they

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:46.140 
would have to retouch so basically they
would<00:03:44.260> vote<00:03:44.620> last<00:03:44.920> a<00:03:45.130> few<00:03:45.340> hours<00:03:45.459> on<00:03:45.790> your<00:03:45.910> lips

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
would vote last a few hours on your lips

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.390 
would vote last a few hours on your lips

until you eat which is kind of normal

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.729 
until you eat which is kind of normal
you<00:03:49.000> could<00:03:49.150> get<00:03:49.360> it<00:03:49.480> away<00:03:49.660> with<00:03:49.959> it<00:03:50.140> D<00:03:50.530> Lime

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
you could get it away with it D Lime

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:52.770 
you could get it away with it D Lime
Crime<00:03:51.010> if<00:03:51.220> you<00:03:51.340> eat<00:03:51.550> like<00:03:51.790> lightly<00:03:52.150> but
