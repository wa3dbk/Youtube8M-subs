00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.970
 channel sponsor thermaltake 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:07.950
 thermaltake play is even easier than kitchen 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.160
 thank store frozen hell dot ru 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:15.059
 for providing a review cooler with 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:18.359
 you again kitchen video is all you need 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:21.000
 for the upcoming season despite being 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.070
 that this model is not new and 2012 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.420
 when she came out we had a review given 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.760
 instance is still in service 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.039
 technical process decreases the number of processors 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.920
 growing but in general, the heat emission of new 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.059
 cards does not set records of previous years 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.680
 mounting holes standard 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.120
 so good old colorcoder 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.710
 supports hot in live and 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.010
 figuratively new market 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:46.020
 for example this is radeon r9 290 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:47.309
 r9 290x geforce gtx 280 770 780 and 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.370
 imagine titan 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.379
 but we have no titans so we will collect on 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.410
 the fact that there is gtx260 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:58.079
 extremely hot 55 nanometers and 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.270
 180 watt heat dissipation process 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.670
 much more than the central top 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.680
 CPU overclocking so even with two 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.320
 fans model is noisy here 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.659
 look 44 decibels at 80 one 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.350
 degrees Celsius let's put a cooler 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.630
 from gerrit 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.040
 By the way, there are radiators for 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.930
 memory which can be set 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.330
 but you can and do not care anyway 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.280
 fans gelid blows chips but 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.060
 radiator for logic card system just 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.979
 need to wear 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.070
 it is bundled and attached with 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.840
 Clip assembly simple in the kit 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.970
 branded syringe with a very high quality 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.549
 pasta and stock which is enough for 45 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.860
 lubrication one feature despite 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.170
 exactly the same video card power plug 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.140
 does not control the cooler from the gel from everything 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.880
 2000 rpm time which is noisy fortunately 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.920
 Included is an adapter for 3 pin 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.020
 so you can power the system through 2 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.049
 oboes we reduced noise to 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:52.799
 comfortable and so 18 minutes four march 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.220
 52 degrees at 35 decibels is big 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.950
 progress 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.110
 we reduced the temperature by 29 degrees a 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.350
 noise level at 9 decibels while 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.189
 memory temperature is only 44 degrees 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.930
 the only drawback is that 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.810
 video card with a cooler takes not two 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.450
 three slots for cooler cards 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.879
 then judging by extraneous dough with gtx680 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.140
 cooler from gel it at approximately equal 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:14.760
 noise level is having 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.860
 better than a coin from gigabytes with 3 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.790
 fans at maximum he 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.310
 sets records 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.230
 price cooler order chatted 2000 rubles 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.300
 and we recommend it when 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.120
 buy noisy and hot but cheap 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.080
 reference is for example the old powerful 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.800
 on a fur coat card 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.090
 upgrade horn and it makes sense to take a cooler 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:37.790
 such was our review of the cooler for video cards 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.790
 and separate offline was arina all bye
