two hair brushes that rotate and the

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.170 
two hair brushes that rotate and the
wool<00:00:23.260> starts<00:00:24.100> out<00:00:24.190> as<00:00:24.310> raw<00:00:24.490> wool<00:00:24.760> straight<00:00:25.030> off

the<00:00:25.210> Sheep<00:00:25.600> so<00:00:26.140> you<00:00:26.199> run<00:00:26.500> it<00:00:26.619> through<00:00:26.860> these

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:27.070 
the Sheep so you run it through these

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.189 
the Sheep so you run it through these
two<00:00:27.310> drums<00:00:27.880> that<00:00:28.150> took<00:00:28.330> them<00:00:28.480> to<00:00:28.570> a<00:00:28.600> bicycle

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:29.199 
two drums that took them to a bicycle

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:30.779 
two drums that took them to a bicycle
the<00:00:29.560> drums<00:00:29.800> are<00:00:29.920> spinning<00:00:30.310> in<00:00:30.400> opposite

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:30.789 
the drums are spinning in opposite

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:32.429 
the drums are spinning in opposite
directions<00:00:30.910> and<00:00:31.539> the<00:00:31.750> rule<00:00:31.930> gets<00:00:32.080> pulled

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:32.439 
directions and the rule gets pulled

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:34.500 
directions and the rule gets pulled
under<00:00:32.770> them<00:00:32.949> and<00:00:33.129> as<00:00:33.760> is<00:00:33.940> transferred<00:00:34.480> from

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:34.510 
under them and as is transferred from

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.270 
under them and as is transferred from
one<00:00:34.690> drum<00:00:35.050> to<00:00:35.140> the<00:00:35.230> next<00:00:35.470> it<00:00:35.559> gets<00:00:35.710> brushed<00:00:35.980> out

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280 
one drum to the next it gets brushed out

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.580 
one drum to the next it gets brushed out
so<00:00:37.059> it<00:00:37.210> aligns<00:00:37.510> the<00:00:37.720> fibers<00:00:38.140> and<00:00:38.350> you<00:00:38.440> get<00:00:38.559> a

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:38.590 
so it aligns the fibers and you get a

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.979 
so it aligns the fibers and you get a
nice<00:00:38.800> smooth<00:00:39.220> even<00:00:39.550> layer<00:00:39.880> and<00:00:40.239> from<00:00:40.840> there

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:40.989 
nice smooth even layer and from there

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:42.330 
nice smooth even layer and from there
it's<00:00:41.140> a<00:00:41.200> lot<00:00:41.350> easier<00:00:41.380> to<00:00:41.710> work<00:00:41.920> with<00:00:41.980> if<00:00:42.220> you're

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:42.340 
it's a lot easier to work with if you're

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.160 
it's a lot easier to work with if you're
going<00:00:42.460> to<00:00:42.520> be<00:00:42.640> spinning<00:00:43.090> or<00:00:43.329> making<00:00:43.540> felt<00:00:43.930> from

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.170 
going to be spinning or making felt from

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:49.350 
going to be spinning or making felt from
it<00:00:44.320> I<00:00:47.250> came<00:00:48.250> to<00:00:48.399> the<00:00:48.489> point<00:00:48.700> in<00:00:48.850> my<00:00:48.880> life<00:00:48.969> where

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:49.360 
it I came to the point in my life where

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.310 
it I came to the point in my life where
it<00:00:49.450> seemed<00:00:49.719> obvious<00:00:49.960> I've<00:00:50.520> build<00:00:51.520> bicycle<00:00:52.320> I

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.320 
it seemed obvious I've build bicycle I

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.260 
it seemed obvious I've build bicycle I
use<00:00:53.829> a<00:00:53.860> smaller<00:00:54.309> version<00:00:54.579> that's<00:00:54.940> a<00:00:55.000> hand

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:55.270 
use a smaller version that's a hand

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.920 
use a smaller version that's a hand

gin<00:00:59.140> is<00:00:59.410> the<00:00:59.950> first<00:01:00.399> of<00:01:00.670> this<00:01:00.940> family<00:01:01.539> of

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.570 
gin is the first of this family of

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.760 
gin is the first of this family of
machines<00:01:02.730> just<00:01:03.730> made<00:01:04.119> sense<00:01:04.539> to<00:01:04.869> bring<00:01:05.590> the

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
machines just made sense to bring the

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.279 
machines just made sense to bring the
two<00:01:05.800> contraptions<00:01:06.700> together<00:01:07.060> and<00:01:07.360> it's<00:01:08.050> so

00:01:08.279 --> 00:01:08.289 
two contraptions together and it's so

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:11.309 
two contraptions together and it's so
easy<00:01:09.390> biomechanically<00:01:10.390> our<00:01:10.539> legs<00:01:10.990> are<00:01:11.170> so

00:01:11.309 --> 00:01:11.319 
easy biomechanically our legs are so

00:01:11.319 --> 00:01:13.199 
easy biomechanically our legs are so
strong<00:01:11.649> and<00:01:12.009> to<00:01:12.340> have<00:01:12.490> that<00:01:12.640> symmetrical

00:01:13.199 --> 00:01:13.209 
strong and to have that symmetrical

00:01:13.209 --> 00:01:18.900 
strong and to have that symmetrical
motion<00:01:13.569> it's<00:01:13.690> incredibly<00:01:14.170> efficient<00:01:17.009> I<00:01:18.009> just

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:18.910 
motion it's incredibly efficient I just

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:20.880 
motion it's incredibly efficient I just
always<00:01:19.060> like<00:01:19.390> to<00:01:19.810> make<00:01:19.959> things<00:01:20.229> like<00:01:20.440> many<00:01:20.770> of
