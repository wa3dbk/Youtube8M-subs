 available inventor so in the meantime 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.230
 we are on the one of benteke of which you 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.519
 can see that I stuck them in a 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.990
 team of barclays premier league so 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.410
 with singing him a form and others 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.060
 players 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.529
 so there you have statins games that 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.730
 are scrolling I invite you 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.840
 to pause or put back 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.989
 back to observe them well 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.300
 so christian benteke inform i'm going 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.730
 not lie to you I was a little disappointed 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.770
 I was a little disappointed so I'm part 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.140
 rare people who can not 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.789
 play with him the regular already I had 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.680
 a lot of difficulties 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.410
 play with it's true and it's 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.449
 confirmed with the with to the version 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.610
 a form so I will start with the 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.829
 negatives so in the points 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.210
 negatives the price over 150000 credit 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.030
 as I speak to you I find it 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.589
 really too expensive certainly it's from the 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.720
 start so that means this weekend 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.490
 it will be much cheaper but I 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.869
 find that I find it a little expensive in 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.880
 do I find it finally I find it 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.979
 more expensive I find it too expensive in the 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.840
 meaning where the player is and the player is 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.750
 good but that's it remains a player without 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.179
 more after one has agility he is 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.009
 really you really feel it's a 

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:24.959
 beefy player you feel he's beefy 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.619
 but agility it's really not that 

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:27.119
 balanced 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.160
 so even if he has a very very big 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.780
 head in strength he gets moved when 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.910
 even and sometimes they fall and sometimes 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.920
 they fall and that's pretty amazing 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.539
 I was surprised by that 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.239
 when I saw that equilibrium staton that has 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:41.700
 over who has less than 70 I believe I have 

00:01:39.239 --> 00:01:43.800
 understood after we have everything that is 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.319
 technical although he dribbled 1.77 I 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.489
 been pretty disappointed that this side there that I have 

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:48.450
 been pretty disappointed on that side 

00:01:47.489 --> 00:01:50.039
 technically I found that it was 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.950
 made three stars technical gestures 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:55.020
 so that's for the negatives 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.250
 after we will go to the positive point so 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.319
 at the level of the positive points which has 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.179
 obviously his jump and I head 

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:01.979
 then there is absolutely no purpose of 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:03.780
 the head in this review of benteke I 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.599
 made sure and even for the on the sam 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.220
 suddenly penalized but I have not tried 

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:11.530
 to converse by what the benteke 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.060
 basic in the game when we see it on 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.470
 takes a lot of center-head and 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.940
 I did not feel like stereotypes and the 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.800
 player I wanted to show something else 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.210
 that head centers and so I decided 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.500
 not to make a center-head besides 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.820
 you'll see at the stats level at the 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.710
 maybe it was felt 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.210
 this side there but I help you good 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.710
 it remains a benteke so really 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:29.230
 very very heavy in the game of head 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:30.460
 so his head game after finishing gt 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.420
 but in the most I hesitated because 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.760
 that he still missed me 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.430
 monstrous besides benteke yesterday has 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.570
 did a fail a huge fail last night 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.520
 against the Ivory Coast if you do not 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.750
 not seen going to see so it's a little 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.830
 realistic screw a big step in 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.270
 finish it is still good in front 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.959
 the cages even though he missed some stuff from 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:48.640
 crazy after we have so longhot finish 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.360
 hitting power it really hits 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.970
 very very strong 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.500
 his strength he 1 96 children are moving 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.820
 a lot of people even though as I said 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.190
 it can be done in a team twice 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.260
 to pose problem after one has the penaltys 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.430
 So the penalties not kicking 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.320
 stopped but the penates he has a very 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.520
 good statins at age 91 penalty so 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.890
 here you can shoot them with without 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.209
 too many problems in terms of quality 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.380
 toise then I put the pass quality 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:09.700
 in the more because it's true that 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.370
 down like giroux actually it's really 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.930
 very very good player in pivot and even he 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.610
 made me he surprised me by 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.870
 really very very beautiful because 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.060
 either lobed passes or passes 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.380
 deep for some for ramirez 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.090
 had any effects on the so there you have to 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.650
 the moment here is a decisive pass for 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.880
 on the movie did a lot of small 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.680
 openings like that and I was pretty 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.370
 surprised on that side so a very good 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.380
 pivotal player 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.450
 although it's true that I preferred 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.769
 giroux by the way last week 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.450
 I did pretty much the same style of 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:37.180
 review ie a scorer and a guy to 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.190
 right so sturridge and 7 estoril 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.860
 giroud a form there it's benteke is 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.900
 on a form so bah advantage to the girou 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.880
 you will see for the show all at 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.890
 time what I thought but here 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.120
 I was a little disappointed with the Benteke so 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.200
 after four stars bad foot I 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.610
 forgot to talk about it but he has both 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.799
 feet that's really a positive point 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.850
 still the fact that he has both 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:56.230
 feet even though it's true that his foot 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.670
 left still still enough times 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.980
 limited so that was the last clip 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.840
 with christopher becker a shape so 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.780
 at the level of the positive points groan 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:07.420
 the forces thus finishing the finish there 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.920
 still 93 in finish even though it's 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.930
 true that ben voila I found that 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.079
 it was enough 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.189
 I thought it was pretty 

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:15.659
 irregular even though the tree and that's 

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:16.889
 realistic somewhere because even in 

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:18.690
 true it is able to tow 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:19.859
 stuff you do not know how he does them 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.209
 bullet controls it really does 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:22.560
 very good ball control so for 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.070
 all that will be in people who 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.110
 you etc 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.820
 it's really interesting longshot there 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.289
 will really do very strong aggression and 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.250
 I forgot to talk about it but here it is 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:31.110
 it's a pit bull 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.940
 it's a pitbull he's gonna he's really going 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.900
 embarrassed the defenders in the revive everything 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.130
 the time all the time it's going to be in 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.710
 this is interesting 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:39.060
 still his head game 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.860
 positioning positioning because 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.120
 down he's really making good calls and 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.090
 as I said in people in pivot 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:47.070
 it's a killing speed speed 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:49.139
 I do not talk about it too much during 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.669
 review but its speed gear box 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:53.310
 frankly and poses absolutely no 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:55.259
 problem that side 4 stars bad 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:56.940
 foot quality passes typing power 

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:58.800
 and so in the east - I put the price 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.539
 because I find that 150000 credit 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.580
 keep it still expensive now 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:03.389
 if it's true he'll go down 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.009
 now I put the price in the 

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:06.210
 less excess to more than 50 miles credit 

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:07.139
 that's how it's not the players 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.270
 accessible to everyone 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:10.470
 then agility it's true that the player 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.539
 of football are still quite heavy and 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:14.070
 that there are some things you have the impression 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:16.020
 he can not do like to turn back in 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:17.490
 the little hook there to turn around 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:19.919
 that I like to do with him 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:22.050
 pretty long enough to come out dribble 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:23.570
 technically despite out of 77 on the map 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:26.460
 I thought it was pretty weak 

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:29.010
 balance because he's struggling to hold 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:32.250
 on his legs despite his 96 in strength 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:33.659
 subject forgot their strengths in 96 50 and 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:35.310
 the three-star technical gesture or to 

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:36.630
 the bomb is ok with the dream and me 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:38.669
 I still wanted to clarify 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:40.470
 at the balance sheet level with a see ten 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:42.780
 matches 6 goals 5 assists so 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:45.360
 a positive assessment in terms of bad action 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:47.460
 of goal but he could have had a plus 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:50.460
 big picture if he had not missed 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:52.650
 stuff pretty abused in front of the cages 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:54.030
 so I'm going to rate it 13 out of 20 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:56.490
 remains a positive note a note 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:56.909
 correct but I preferred a giroud a 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:58.320
 form 

00:05:56.909 --> 00:06:00.270
 if you have the credits I you 

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:02.190
 advises the girou a shape even if 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:03.750
 here is the benteke I think I would have 

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:05.880
 could put a lot more starts in 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:07.229
 Abusing headaches is also the 

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:08.970
 benteke a shape when we will fall 

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:10.259
 above on the live at risk of rage and 

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:11.669
