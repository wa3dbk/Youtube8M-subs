your<00:01:58.829> towns<00:01:59.189> and<00:01:59.700> everything<00:02:00.600> will<00:02:00.719> be<00:02:00.810> fine

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.740 

the<00:02:03.870> world<00:02:04.050> will<00:02:04.260> be<00:02:04.350> saved<00:02:04.620> just<00:02:05.630> there<00:02:06.630> won't

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
the world will be saved just there won't

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.500 
the world will be saved just there won't
be<00:02:06.840> any<00:02:07.020> nations<00:02:07.770> or<00:02:07.950> towns<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.670> you<00:02:09.270> can<00:02:09.360> get

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:09.510 
be any nations or towns and you can get

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:12.980 
be any nations or towns and you can get
raided<00:02:09.750> and<00:02:10.430> I<00:02:11.430> would<00:02:12.120> have<00:02:12.240> to<00:02:12.390> work<00:02:12.750> on<00:02:12.900> the

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
raided and I would have to work on the

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.710 
raided and I would have to work on the
Senate<00:02:13.350> any<00:02:13.470> it<00:02:13.590> stop<00:02:13.740> clicking<00:02:13.950> this<00:02:14.190> pen<00:02:14.720> but

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
Senate any it stop clicking this pen but

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:16.940 
Senate any it stop clicking this pen but
that's<00:02:16.260> one<00:02:16.470> option

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
that's one option

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.540 
that's one option
change<00:02:17.370> it<00:02:17.490> to<00:02:17.520> factions<00:02:18.030> second<00:02:18.900> option<00:02:19.320> is

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
change it to factions second option is

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.330 
change it to factions second option is
to<00:02:20.550> delete<00:02:21.000> the<00:02:21.150> world<00:02:21.440> and<00:02:22.440> delete<00:02:23.160> all<00:02:23.220> the

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
to delete the world and delete all the

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.490 
to delete the world and delete all the
towns<00:02:23.580> and<00:02:23.940> completely<00:02:24.390> start<00:02:24.690> fresh<00:02:24.900> start

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
towns and completely start fresh start

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.470 
towns and completely start fresh start
new<00:02:25.710> and<00:02:26.360> start<00:02:27.360> over<00:02:27.480> basically<00:02:28.140> but<00:02:29.480> your

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
new and start over basically but your

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.730 
new and start over basically but your
towns<00:02:30.720> will<00:02:31.020> also<00:02:31.260> get<00:02:31.440> reset<00:02:31.890> anyways<00:02:32.580> and

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
towns will also get reset anyways and

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.740 
towns will also get reset anyways and
that's<00:02:34.740> that<00:02:35.070> does<00:02:35.550> that's<00:02:36.030> pretty<00:02:36.300> simple

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
that's that does that's pretty simple

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.650 
that's that does that's pretty simple
option<00:02:37.230> we<00:02:37.350> can<00:02:37.500> reset<00:02:37.800> all<00:02:37.950> of<00:02:38.190> the<00:02:38.880> all<00:02:39.450> the

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
option we can reset all of the all the

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.450 
option we can reset all of the all the
towns<00:02:39.900> reset<00:02:40.710> the<00:02:40.830> world<00:02:41.010> you'll<00:02:41.310> lose

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
towns reset the world you'll lose

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.550 
towns reset the world you'll lose
everything<00:02:41.760> but<00:02:42.690> you'll<00:02:42.870> get<00:02:42.960> a<00:02:43.020> fresh<00:02:43.200> start

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
everything but you'll get a fresh start

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.040 
everything but you'll get a fresh start
so<00:02:43.800> it's<00:02:43.980> okay<00:02:44.360> that's<00:02:45.360> the<00:02:45.540> second<00:02:45.780> option

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
so it's okay that's the second option

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.180 
so it's okay that's the second option
the<00:02:46.080> third<00:02:46.320> and<00:02:46.620> final<00:02:47.010> option<00:02:47.670> is<00:02:47.880> to<00:02:49.190> wait

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
the third and final option is to wait

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.690 
the third and final option is to wait
because<00:02:50.810> Tommy<00:02:51.810> is<00:02:52.020> 1.5<00:02:52.710> right<00:02:52.980> now<00:02:53.130> and

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
because Tommy is 1.5 right now and

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:54.950 
because Tommy is 1.5 right now and
that's<00:02:53.880> the<00:02:54.060> main<00:02:54.240> problem<00:02:54.450> I<00:02:54.690> think<00:02:54.840> it's

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 
that's the main problem I think it's

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.920 
that's the main problem I think it's
breaking<00:02:55.320> so<00:02:56.040> we<00:02:56.340> can<00:02:56.490> just<00:02:56.640> wait<00:02:56.790> for<00:02:57.030> a<00:02:57.270> 1.6

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
breaking so we can just wait for a 1.6

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.320 
breaking so we can just wait for a 1.6
version<00:02:58.410> of<00:02:58.620> Tony<00:02:59.010> to<00:02:59.130> come<00:02:59.160> out<00:02:59.370> and<00:02:59.700> when

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
version of Tony to come out and when

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.780 
version of Tony to come out and when
that<00:03:00.450> comes<00:03:00.780> out<00:03:01.100> we<00:03:02.100> can<00:03:02.280> just<00:03:02.310> update<00:03:02.550> the

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
that comes out we can just update the

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.430 
that comes out we can just update the
plug-in<00:03:03.000> and<00:03:03.210> see<00:03:03.300> what<00:03:03.420> happens<00:03:03.660> but<00:03:04.170> that

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
plug-in and see what happens but that

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.920 
plug-in and see what happens but that
could<00:03:04.980> be<00:03:05.010> a<00:03:05.190> week<00:03:05.550> or<00:03:05.850> even<00:03:05.970> two<00:03:06.180> weeks<00:03:06.300> and

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
could be a week or even two weeks and

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.530 
could be a week or even two weeks and
the<00:03:07.050> server<00:03:07.290> will<00:03:08.190> stay<00:03:08.489> down<00:03:08.670> for<00:03:09.180> that<00:03:09.360> whole

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
the server will stay down for that whole

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.280 
the server will stay down for that whole
period<00:03:09.810> of<00:03:10.050> time<00:03:10.290> but<00:03:11.280> no<00:03:12.120> I<00:03:12.420> haven't<00:03:13.020> actually

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
period of time but no I haven't actually

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.890 
period of time but no I haven't actually
checked<00:03:13.680> last<00:03:14.370> time<00:03:14.670> Tony<00:03:14.970> was<00:03:15.180> updated<00:03:15.600> might

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
checked last time Tony was updated might

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.240 
checked last time Tony was updated might
have<00:03:16.050> already<00:03:16.260> been<00:03:16.380> updated<00:03:16.800> but<00:03:16.950> I<00:03:17.100> don't

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
have already been updated but I don't

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.090 
have already been updated but I don't
think<00:03:17.430> it<00:03:17.489> happened<00:03:17.850> so<00:03:18.510> Tony<00:03:18.989> we<00:03:19.830> could<00:03:19.980> just

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
think it happened so Tony we could just

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.810 
think it happened so Tony we could just
wait<00:03:20.220> for<00:03:20.370> Tony<00:03:20.610> to<00:03:20.730> get<00:03:20.940> updated<00:03:21.270> to<00:03:21.709> 1.6.2

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
wait for Tony to get updated to 1.6.2

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.340 
wait for Tony to get updated to 1.6.2
but<00:03:23.820> those<00:03:24.030> are<00:03:24.300> three<00:03:24.450> options<00:03:24.600> so<00:03:25.050> why<00:03:25.170> did

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
but those are three options so why did

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:26.930
