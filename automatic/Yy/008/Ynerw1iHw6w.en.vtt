is really amazing fine now the problem

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:32.700 
is really amazing fine now the problem
with<00:01:31.720> this<00:01:31.900> is<00:01:32.080> that<00:01:32.110> the<00:01:32.290> sleeves<00:01:32.530> are<00:01:32.650> too

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
with this is that the sleeves are too

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.320 
with this is that the sleeves are too
long<00:01:33.040> so<00:01:33.400> I<00:01:33.430> would<00:01:33.760> have<00:01:33.850> done<00:01:34.000> is<00:01:34.180> has

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330 
long so I would have done is has

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:35.910 
long so I would have done is has
gathered<00:01:34.780> up<00:01:34.870> the<00:01:35.020> fabric<00:01:35.380> and<00:01:35.530> pinned<00:01:35.800> it

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
gathered up the fabric and pinned it

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.640

here<00:01:35.950> to<00:01:36.370> the<00:01:36.910> shoulder<00:01:37.480> and<00:01:37.660> it<00:01:38.080> worked<00:01:38.260> okay

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:38.650

if you have more sewing skills I

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.760

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770
