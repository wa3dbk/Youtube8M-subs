00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.790
Welcome to the World of Warcraft Patch 5.4 preview.

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:15.000
Today we’ll be taking a look at several
of the biggest new features

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:17.850
coming in Patch 5.4: Siege of Orgrimmar.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.620
First up, the Timeless Isle;

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.420
a place of great cultural
significance to the Pandaren,

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.750
the Timeless Isle exists
outside of the normal passage of time.

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:30.040
Every so often it reappears,

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:34.280
and in Patch 5.4 it’s reappearing
just off the coast of the Jade Forest.

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.680
Content on the Timeless Isle
is based entirely on exploration.

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.640
As you make your way
around the island,

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.270
you’ll discover rare creatures,

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:43.920
hidden treasure chests,

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.310
special events,
puzzles,

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.990
and all sorts of other surprises.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.900
And you’ll be rewarded
for your efforts

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.300
with gear
up to item level 535,

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:53.910
account-bound tokens

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:55.490
that you can use
to gear up your alts,

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:56.470
battle pets,

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:57.870
Lesser Charms of Good Fortune,

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.040
and a variety of other fun items.

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.570
Of course, one of the biggest
new features in 5.4

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:06.380
is the Siege of Orgrimmar raid.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.820
The forces of the Alliance fleet
and the Horde rebellion

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.390
are bearing down on Orgrimmar
with one goal:

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.570
remove Garrosh Hellscream from power.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.360
This is a huge instance
with 14 total bosses,

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.670
starting in the now destroyed
Vale of Eternal Blossoms,

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.830
leading to an assault
on the gates of Orgrimmar itself,

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.590
and finally to a massive
underground base

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.690
located beneath Ragefire Chasm.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:32.890
Along with the new raid

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.020
comes a brand new difficulty mode.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.230
Flexible mode fits in between Raid Finder
and Normal in terms of difficulty,

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.350
and is targeted at
the friends and family group

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.260
that just wants to have
some fun together,

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.900
without the stress
and extra pressure

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.920
that Normal or Heroic raiding provides.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.640
In Flexible mode, you can bring
any number of players you like
from 10 to 25

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.860
and the instance will scale itself
accordingly to match your group.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.000
Look to our preview
on the World of Warcraft website

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.000
for more details
on this exciting new feature.

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.850
If you’re not quite ready
to step up into group content,

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.260
or you’d like to try out
another spec or role,

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.510
or even if you’d just like
to get some practice in,

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.590
then you might want
to check out Proving Grounds.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.160
These are solo instances
specifically designed

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.030
to test your abilities
as a tank, healer, or damage dealer.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.630
They’re a great way
to get some experience under your belt

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.840
without having to worry
about the stress of letting your group down.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.180
Once you’ve worked your way

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.770
through Bronze, Silver, and Gold ratings,

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.090
you may even want
to give Endless mode a try.

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.720
See how long you can last.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.440
Patch 5.4 also features

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.980
the conclusion of Mists of Pandaria’s
legendary quest chain.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.340
Players who have completed
the previous steps of the chain

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.220
will be sent to meet
with Wrathion on the Timeless Isle,

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.670
where he’ll send you
on a series of short tasks,

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.260
including defeating
the four Celestials in combat

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.720
before upgrading your previous
epic cloak to legendary status.

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.770
Completing this quest
will also give you access to Ordos,

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.100
a challenging world boss
located on the Timeless Isle.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.390
Of course, these are just a few
of the new changes and features

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.220
coming in Patch 5.4.

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.460
Be sure to check out
our official patch preview

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.500

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.820
Thanks for watching,
and we’ll see you in Orgrimmar.
