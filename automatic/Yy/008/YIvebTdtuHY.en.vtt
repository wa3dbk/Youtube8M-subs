00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
the period number just in case the

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.839 
the period number just in case the
worksheet<00:00:26.010> so<00:00:26.130> I<00:00:26.220> know<00:00:26.340> what<00:00:26.460> you<00:00:26.519> find<00:00:26.699> ur<00:00:26.789> it

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
worksheet so I know what you find ur it

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.050 
worksheet so I know what you find ur it
goes<00:00:27.000> in<00:00:27.150> and<00:00:27.300> which<00:00:27.449> of<00:00:27.480> us<00:00:28.220> um<00:00:29.220> also<00:00:29.609> when

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
goes in and which of us um also when

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.730 
goes in and which of us um also when
taking<00:00:30.359> notes<00:00:30.390> I<00:00:30.750> think<00:00:30.960> it's<00:00:31.050> so<00:00:31.320> important

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
taking notes I think it's so important

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.229 
taking notes I think it's so important
to<00:00:31.769> highlight<00:00:32.160> everything<00:00:32.369> just<00:00:32.880> so<00:00:32.969> you<00:00:33.030> know

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
to highlight everything just so you know

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.420 
to highlight everything just so you know
you<00:00:33.989> know<00:00:34.110> what<00:00:34.350> we're<00:00:34.559> studying<00:00:34.950> maybe<00:00:35.219> what

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
you know what we're studying maybe what

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.910 
you know what we're studying maybe what
works<00:00:35.610> these<00:00:35.850> definitions<00:00:36.270> for<00:00:36.719> you<00:00:37.500> know<00:00:37.620> for

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
works these definitions for you know for

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.200 
works these definitions for you know for
taking<00:00:38.190> tests<00:00:38.430> or<00:00:38.520> anything<00:00:38.640> like<00:00:38.820> that<00:00:38.879> and<00:00:39.149> I

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
taking tests or anything like that and I

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.790 
taking tests or anything like that and I
think<00:00:39.390> it<00:00:39.480> really<00:00:39.809> really<00:00:39.989> helps<00:00:40.290> so<00:00:42.590> the<00:00:43.590> next

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
think it really really helps so the next

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.560 
think it really really helps so the next
thing<00:00:43.920> is<00:00:44.070> making<00:00:44.489> split<00:00:44.969> notes<00:00:45.149> you<00:00:45.329> know<00:00:45.420> if

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
thing is making split notes you know if

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.450 
thing is making split notes you know if
a<00:00:45.870> lot<00:00:46.230> of<00:00:46.260> teachers<00:00:46.500> make<00:00:46.770> outlines<00:00:47.100> like

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
a lot of teachers make outlines like

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.400 
a lot of teachers make outlines like
this<00:00:47.640> like<00:00:47.850> you<00:00:47.969> know<00:00:48.000> split<00:00:48.239> no<00:00:48.420> outline<00:00:48.750> but

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
this like you know split no outline but

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.049 
this like you know split no outline but
if<00:00:49.829> your<00:00:49.980> teacher<00:00:50.160> doesn't<00:00:50.430> it's<00:00:50.670> really<00:00:50.879> easy

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
if your teacher doesn't it's really easy

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.910 
if your teacher doesn't it's really easy
you<00:00:51.239> just<00:00:51.300> kind<00:00:51.660> of<00:00:51.750> separate<00:00:52.170> it<00:00:52.199> by<00:00:52.410> topic

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
you just kind of separate it by topic

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.040 
you just kind of separate it by topic
and<00:00:53.100> things<00:00:53.670> about<00:00:54.000> that<00:00:54.239> certain<00:00:54.539> topic<00:00:54.930> and

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
and things about that certain topic and

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.020 
and things about that certain topic and
so<00:00:55.949> yeah<00:00:56.309> I<00:00:56.340> think<00:00:56.460> they're<00:00:56.699> really<00:00:56.850> really

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
so yeah I think they're really really

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:03.470 
so yeah I think they're really really
helpful<00:01:01.609> next<00:01:02.609> I<00:01:02.699> would<00:01:02.789> recommend<00:01:03.210> kind<00:01:03.420> of
