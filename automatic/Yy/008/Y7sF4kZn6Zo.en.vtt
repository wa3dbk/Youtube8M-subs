design<00:02:54.830> we<00:02:55.010> have<00:02:55.040> modifications<00:02:55.760> as<00:02:55.880> well<00:02:56.170> so

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
design we have modifications as well so

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:58.870 
design we have modifications as well so
we<00:02:57.320> improved<00:02:57.650> the<00:02:57.739> downforce<00:02:58.280> on<00:02:58.430> the<00:02:58.610> front

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
we improved the downforce on the front

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.270 
we improved the downforce on the front
and<00:02:59.030> rear<00:02:59.299> axles<00:02:59.920> increasing<00:03:00.920> the<00:03:01.010> griffon

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
and rear axles increasing the griffon

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.680 
and rear axles increasing the griffon

Cena's<00:03:09.910> in<00:03:10.030> race<00:03:10.210> cars<00:03:10.510> which<00:03:11.170> increase<00:03:11.530> the

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
Cena's in race cars which increase the

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.890 
Cena's in race cars which increase the
down<00:03:11.860> forests<00:03:12.340> to<00:03:12.430> the<00:03:12.520> front<00:03:12.760> axle<00:03:12.940> the<00:03:13.660> car

down forests to the front axle the car

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.220 
down forests to the front axle the car
is<00:03:14.140> almost<00:03:14.400> 190<00:03:15.400> 195<00:03:16.000> kilos<00:03:16.570> it<00:03:16.750> down<00:03:16.930> for<00:03:17.200> us

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
is almost 190 195 kilos it down for us

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.230 
is almost 190 195 kilos it down for us
now<00:03:17.440> at<00:03:17.650> top<00:03:17.860> speed<00:03:18.130> which<00:03:18.730> is<00:03:18.880> very

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:19.240 
now at top speed which is very

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:46.220 
now at top speed which is very
remarkable<00:03:19.810> for<00:03:20.050> a<00:03:20.080> street-legal<00:03:20.500> car

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.649 

so<00:03:46.980> on<00:03:47.129> the<00:03:47.220> result<00:03:47.610> of<00:03:47.730> all<00:03:47.909> this<00:03:48.090> development

00:03:48.649 --> 00:03:48.659 
so on the result of all this development

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:51.830 
so on the result of all this development
is<00:03:48.870> a<00:03:49.110> car<00:03:49.470> it<00:03:50.129> is<00:03:50.280> really<00:03:50.580> very<00:03:50.610> unique<00:03:51.299> RS

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
is a car it is really very unique RS

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.110 
is a car it is really very unique RS
four-point-oh<00:03:52.530> is<00:03:53.099> really<00:03:53.459> a<00:03:53.489> car<00:03:53.730> that's<00:03:53.970> a

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
four-point-oh is really a car that's a

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.030 
four-point-oh is really a car that's a
lot<00:03:54.299> of<00:03:54.420> fun<00:03:54.599> the<00:03:54.840> performance<00:03:55.379> is<00:03:55.530> like<00:03:55.799> it

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
lot of fun the performance is like it

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.550 
lot of fun the performance is like it
never<00:03:56.250> has<00:03:56.519> been<00:03:56.700> before<00:03:56.760> and<00:03:57.299> I<00:03:58.170> think<00:03:58.470> it's

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
never has been before and I think it's

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.110 
never has been before and I think it's
going<00:03:58.680> to<00:03:58.769> be<00:03:58.890> an<00:03:58.950> all-time<00:03:59.370> classic<00:03:59.400> we're

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
going to be an all-time classic we're

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.300 
going to be an all-time classic we're
making<00:04:00.390> only<00:04:00.510> 600<00:04:01.140> of<00:04:01.230> these<00:04:01.379> cars<00:04:01.709> limited

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
making only 600 of these cars limited

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.630 
making only 600 of these cars limited
from<00:04:02.670> 0<00:04:03.030> 0<00:04:03.299> 1<00:04:03.480> 2<00:04:03.720> 600<00:04:04.260> I<00:04:04.410> think<00:04:04.920> this<00:04:05.340> might<00:04:05.400> be

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
from 0 0 1 2 600 I think this might be

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.290 
from 0 0 1 2 600 I think this might be
the<00:04:05.879> best<00:04:06.060> RSV<00:04:06.959> ever<00:04:07.140> made
