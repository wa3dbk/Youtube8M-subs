00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:16.000
 They say that you raised four 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:18.849
 generations of our football players here could 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.770
 you can now not be the best 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:23.439
 Here which would you choose which you 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:26.680
 closer I can even this is not accepted 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:27.309
 Alexander answered the question with a question 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.349
 Lviv 

00:00:27.309 --> 00:00:33.820
 because well you may not remember 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:36.430
 I played some from 4 players 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.350
 I you angry on one flank its 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.150
 time left flank all time pavement 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:44.170
 played 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:47.820
 then he played the cymbalar Alenichev and Tikhonov 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:51.460
 from which of them choose whom to any 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.500
 how to count who gets out worse here 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.290
 who chooses the best taste and color 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.480
 so I cannot name the composition I can 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.880
 also to any position three four 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.190
 players to name and who is better this thing 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.649
 taste and how did you determine which players 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:10.810
 need your team by what criteria 

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:13.090
 You Conder but the criterion I personally had 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:16.150
 one if player 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:18.400
 getting the ball starts looking for a move it's 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.540
 destroyer is a player at best 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.850
 average player 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.190
 if the player gets the ball already sees 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.110
 further this creator and such 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.479
 the player I immediately grabbed and tried to him 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.940
 work and most often guessed not 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:36.400
 sensations that legionnaires Spartak ahah here 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:39.190
 comes look bright then all this to 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.130
 Unfortunately, again , not only in Spartak 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:45.020
 it happens in all the teams why 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:47.000
 I do not know with the legionnaires I was lucky 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.070
 I had them a little in the first to the second 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.579
 just golden guys 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.649
 Robson brand but the truth is Moscow 

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:57.799
 Spartak is now like a lot of legionnaires 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:02:00.079
 you are to them as a treat, or do you still 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:01.250
 believe that it would be better instead of them 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:04.340
 our russian players 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:07.130
 considered counting I will counting up 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:11.180
 focus let there be legionaries backup path 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:14.959
 Our time is 2-3 good and really 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:17.540
 sincerely loving football but our emphasis 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:19.640
 agent, our coach, children's trainers 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.049
 breeder need to do on 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.810
 Russian football players 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:26.959
 until their long yes yes to train someone 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:30.049
 long someone quickly but they will and 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:32.900
 Russian team play and represent our 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:35.060
 the club is sincere and we will know that our 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.750
 football player he can play our whole life 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:42.319
 football as your time raul how much 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:45.620
 he played for real and everyone knew that raoul 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:47.840
 will play until he says 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.209
 I have enough legionnaire any moment 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.769
 can and break contracts she has 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:53.150
 where to retreat to our players 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:55.489
 nowhere to retreat 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.100
 homeland they live here these 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:01.130
 relatives friends here their country 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:03.079
 therefore, it is easier to work with them with our 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:06.230
 I think the players are part of 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:08.930
 Spartak 90s beginning of 2000 almost was not 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.519
 legionary and if they were the stars though 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.329
 they would know Russian scale already 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:12.920
 Spartak 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:15.050
 remembers our you 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.970
 level and yet the teams played with 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.310
 not just that there is a gender championship 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.349
 but also to adequately act now 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.630
 ports and norman acquire players 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:24.650
 Brazilian national team so what was the secret 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:28.239
 selection 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:30.110
 your Spartacus but we are not so much 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:33.050
 engaged in breeding 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:36.319
 in the west, how many were engaged in breeding 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:38.600
 inside Russia, I do not believe that somewhere in 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:40.850
 Russia is not Streltsov I do not believe that 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:43.700
 somewhere in Russia there is no Yashin they are somewhere 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:48.260
 there is but easier to take ready 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:50.840
 than on currency but it is someone else's money we 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:54.739
 we will not consider what to work this immediately 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:57.650
 won't play i can simple examples 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:58.519
 lead sasha pavement growth with me with 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.850
 second league 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:03.530
 Vasya bags from the second league Andrew quietly 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:06.650
 our physical education teams 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:08.720
 but did not become stars on what now Kana 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:11.680
 newton european soccer coaches 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:15.019
 stars going to us i think on 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:18.109
 good money and the ability to make a name 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:20.709
 we have a lot of teams playing in europe 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:23.630
 so let's say in brazil 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:25.660
 European Cup can not win 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:30.229
 playing on the middle team in england 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:32.800
 Germany and Spain Italy too chances in 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:36.289
 Europe they do not participate in 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:38.210
 European tournaments and Russian clubs 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:39.370
 Well, how many have 5 to participate 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.169
 initially 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:44.180
 and in this top five they go good 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:46.010
 normal football players who thinks 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:49.039
 looking yourself to shine in 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:52.260
 Europe then go to a good club like them 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:56.790
 count ass what's wrong with speech 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:59.670
 very beginning even i remember thats and 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:01.680
 principle discovered when sychev was leaving there 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:05.160
 how again did agents have a big 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:07.770
 value he himself did not really want to look for 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.700
 that really did not want to leave but there dad 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.980
 he intervened 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:13.470
 I immediately said it was not yours here, well, not 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:15.510
 your marseille know well marseilles we 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:17.640
 they played it and know the situation in it 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:21.360
 Marseilles is not your club 

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:23.520
 well he decided to go and in my opinion 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:26.010
 after marseille with heed became quite 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.990
 another has stopped growing that level 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:31.190
 whom he reached the Games of the same 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.190
 my less became worse
