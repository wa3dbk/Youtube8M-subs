00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:13.519
 They asked that it's like playing minecraft 

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:15.950
 multiplayer with version 0.7 point 2 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:20.929
 here we have the htc on our left 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:24.109
 evo 4g and on our right the tablet is 

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:26.329
 the iconia a100 good the first thing that 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:28.939
 we have to keep in mind is that one 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:31.009
 of the two devices has to have 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:35.770
 children for the first thing we do 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:35.770
 we look for sports we activate it 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.780
 we put the name you want 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.940
 minecraft your personal name as you 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.970
 want ok 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.760
 after it is active we go to the other 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:53.530
 device and we connect it as if 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:57.680
 outside a wifi network 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:01:00.949
 we look for wifi settings no longer appears 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.430
 our network in this case is called lewis 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:04.260
 Minecraft 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.120
 but you can put it as 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.070
 you want ok once you're 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.970
 connected 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:14.900
 what we do is 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.850
 and we look for the game we look for the game 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.860
 they can open it first in the one that has 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.000
 eyes pop in that I do not like you 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.370
 want 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.970
 as it is more comfortable here we open 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:28.860
 first pop then we look for it in the 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.540
 table 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:36.200
 we look for the game minecraft ok 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:38.420
 After they are open, we look for clear 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.660
 obviously the one that have host or open 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:44.270
 the game either a map recorded a 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:47.960
 new map whatever it is after it's 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:50.900
 active we go to the other device and 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:54.250
 the other network does not appear at a time 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:56.910
 do more nothing we give 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.910

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.060
 we hope they charge 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.690
 it's a bit slow I do not know why it's 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:12.130
 Extreme to her but it does not matter ok 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:14.920
 after it's loaded we look at this 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:17.560
 Minecraft 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.080
