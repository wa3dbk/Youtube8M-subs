00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:07.670 
got done rewiring it pretty much just

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.570 
got done rewiring it pretty much just
did<00:00:08.670> it<00:00:08.820> the<00:00:08.940> way<00:00:08.970> it<00:00:09.150> was<00:00:09.179> before<00:00:09.300> but<00:00:10.490> he<00:00:11.490> and

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
did it the way it was before but he and

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.669 
did it the way it was before but he and
i<00:00:11.639> know<00:00:11.759> maybe<00:00:11.940> something<00:00:12.269> was<00:00:12.330> bad<00:00:12.679> anyways

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
i know maybe something was bad anyways

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.259 
i know maybe something was bad anyways
here's<00:00:13.950> what<00:00:14.099> it<00:00:14.190> did<00:00:14.309> i<00:00:14.340> started<00:00:14.790> off<00:00:14.910> on<00:00:15.240> the

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
here's what it did i started off on the

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.930 
here's what it did i started off on the
back<00:00:15.480> here<00:00:16.070> right<00:00:17.070> in<00:00:17.100> there<00:00:17.369> that's<00:00:17.670> my

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
back here right in there that's my

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.560 
back here right in there that's my
ground<00:00:19.460> that<00:00:20.460> i<00:00:20.640> actually<00:00:20.820> got<00:00:21.150> a<00:00:21.180> pretty<00:00:21.420> good

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
ground that i actually got a pretty good

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.400 
ground that i actually got a pretty good
solder<00:00:21.869> and<00:00:22.170> there<00:00:22.289> you<00:00:22.410> can't<00:00:22.619> see<00:00:22.830> it<00:00:22.949> it's

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:24.410 
solder and there you can't see it it's

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.000 
solder and there you can't see it it's
kind<00:00:25.410> of<00:00:25.470> fuzzy<00:00:25.680> but<00:00:26.359> ground<00:00:27.359> comes<00:00:27.660> up<00:00:28.010> and

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
kind of fuzzy but ground comes up and

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.269 
kind of fuzzy but ground comes up and
you<00:00:29.070> started<00:00:29.550> in<00:00:29.730> there<00:00:30.710> also<00:00:31.710> have<00:00:31.859> my<00:00:32.009> ground

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
you started in there also have my ground

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.610 
you started in there also have my ground
kind<00:00:32.610> of<00:00:32.669> rio<00:00:32.910> book<00:00:33.180> jack<00:00:33.450> in<00:00:33.690> there<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:34.500> then

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
kind of rio book jack in there and then

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.690 
kind of rio book jack in there and then
also<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:35.760> ground<00:00:36.000> from<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.300> humbucker<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.700> I

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
also the ground from the humbucker and I

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.209 
also the ground from the humbucker and I
drew<00:00:38.969> up<00:00:39.180> a<00:00:41.420> schematic<00:00:42.420> this<00:00:43.100> is<00:00:44.100> the

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
drew up a schematic this is the

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.040 
drew up a schematic this is the
schematic<00:00:44.430> Gibson<00:00:45.300> 49<00:00:45.750> TT<00:00:46.610> humbucker<00:00:48.050> right

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
schematic Gibson 49 TT humbucker right

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.189 
schematic Gibson 49 TT humbucker right
there<00:00:49.610> that's<00:00:50.610> kind<00:00:50.820> of<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.270> crude<00:00:51.629> drawing<00:00:52.020> of

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
there that's kind of a crude drawing of

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.160 
there that's kind of a crude drawing of
a<00:00:52.289> humbucker<00:00:52.820> this<00:00:53.820> is<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.210> wires<00:00:54.390> here<00:00:54.870> right

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
a humbucker this is the wires here right

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.569 
a humbucker this is the wires here right
here<00:00:55.379> right<00:00:55.649> here<00:00:57.739> black<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:58.980> shield<00:00:59.280> to

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
here right here black and shield to

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:05.149 
here right here black and shield to
ground<00:00:59.879> I<00:01:00.649> did<00:01:01.649> that<00:01:02.090> trust<00:01:03.090> me<00:01:03.890> then<00:01:04.890> here<00:01:05.129> we

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
ground I did that trust me then here we

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.210 
ground I did that trust me then here we
got<00:01:05.369> green<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:06.150> white<00:01:06.830> solder<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.040> tie

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
got green and white solder and tie

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.359 
got green and white solder and tie
together<00:01:08.369> I<00:01:08.700> did<00:01:08.939> that<00:01:09.470> and<00:01:10.470> then<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.710> red<00:01:10.920> is

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
together I did that and then the red is

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.420 
together I did that and then the red is
to<00:01:11.640> controls<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.420> don't<00:01:12.600> have<00:01:12.780> any<00:01:12.900> controls<00:01:13.430> so

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
to controls I don't have any controls so

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.800 
to controls I don't have any controls so
I<00:01:14.490> actually<00:01:14.790> soldered<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.479> red<00:01:15.780> in<00:01:16.610> here<00:01:17.810> on

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
I actually soldered the red in here on

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.710 
I actually soldered the red in here on
the<00:01:19.140> left<00:01:19.590> nugget<00:01:20.220> as<00:01:20.369> we're<00:01:20.759> looking<00:01:21.030> that's

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
the left nugget as we're looking that's

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.270 
the left nugget as we're looking that's
the<00:01:21.930> one<00:01:22.049> we're<00:01:22.259> usually<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.770> 5-way<00:01:23.250> switch

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
the one we're usually the 5-way switch

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.140 
the one we're usually the 5-way switch
is<00:01:23.700> connected<00:01:24.020> so<00:01:25.020> it's<00:01:25.770> like<00:01:26.040> it's<00:01:26.460> always<00:01:26.670> on

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
is connected so it's like it's always on

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:34.850 
is connected so it's like it's always on
the<00:01:27.570> humbucker<00:01:28.970> so<00:01:30.950> yep<00:01:31.950> pretty<00:01:32.850> much<00:01:33.860> that's

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
the humbucker so yep pretty much that's

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.539 
the humbucker so yep pretty much that's
what<00:01:35.040> I<00:01:35.070> got<00:01:35.509> and<00:01:36.509> like<00:01:36.750> I<00:01:36.840> said<00:01:37.340> I'm<00:01:38.340> gonna

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
what I got and like I said I'm gonna

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.490 
what I got and like I said I'm gonna
fire<00:01:39.119> it<00:01:39.210> up<00:01:39.299> now<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:39.990> we'll<00:01:40.200> see<00:01:40.380> how<00:01:40.560> it<00:01:40.590> goes

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
fire it up now and we'll see how it goes

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.850 
fire it up now and we'll see how it goes
maybe<00:01:43.500> I<00:01:43.890> just<00:01:44.220> headed<00:01:44.610> saturd<00:01:45.470> poorly<00:01:46.470> before

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
maybe I just headed saturd poorly before

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.020 
maybe I just headed saturd poorly before
