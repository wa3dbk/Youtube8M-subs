00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
know what I mean we've all probably been

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.370 
know what I mean we've all probably been
there<00:01:20.189> where<00:01:21.150> you're<00:01:21.600> trying<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:21.869> build<00:01:22.110> and

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
there where you're trying to build and

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.570 
there where you're trying to build and
something<00:01:22.770> gets<00:01:22.920> in<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.070> way<00:01:23.189> new<00:01:23.369> track

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
something gets in the way new track

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.039 
something gets in the way new track
killed<00:01:23.820> but<00:01:24.090> then<00:01:24.270> you<00:01:24.390> mess<00:01:24.540> up<00:01:24.600> your<00:01:24.869> build

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
killed but then you mess up your build

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.310 
killed but then you mess up your build
so<00:01:25.770> another<00:01:26.610> bug<00:01:26.850> fix<00:01:27.090> is<00:01:27.330> that<00:01:27.600> wolves<00:01:28.080> when

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
so another bug fix is that wolves when

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.749 
so another bug fix is that wolves when
tamed<00:01:28.619> would<00:01:28.890> usually<00:01:29.040> have<00:01:29.220> like<00:01:29.490> a<00:01:29.549> low

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
tamed would usually have like a low

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.060 
tamed would usually have like a low
amount<00:01:30.030> of<00:01:30.270> health<00:01:30.540> but<00:01:31.229> that<00:01:31.590> will<00:01:31.770> be<00:01:31.799> fixed

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
amount of health but that will be fixed

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.100 
amount of health but that will be fixed
in<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.400> pre-release<00:01:32.759> one<00:01:33.600> of<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.750> developers

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
in the pre-release one of the developers

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.899
