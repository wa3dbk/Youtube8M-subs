00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:07.190
 hello very good to all I am the gentleman 

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:10.010
 snake and we are in americans army 4 

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:11.720
 pro bring ground beta ie a new 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.090
 quotation marks free to play diego quotes 

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:16.460
 because in this there will be no pete d amico 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.800
 transactions nor will there be milk this is 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.749
 simply and has been in all 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.089
 its versions a propaganda for 

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:25.069
 enlist the American rectum evidently 

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:26.599
 clear for the Americans or for the 

00:00:25.069 --> 00:00:28.310
 people that you want germany to make a 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:30.470
 small test and bla bla bla bla bla bla to 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.239
 get the green card file a great 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.460
 process in which of the Europeans 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:36.519
 normal something that you want to go by 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:41.090
 vocation you can never complete 

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:43.789
 equally american sharm and will offer you 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.070
 a few hours of fun that's good 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:47.839
 to do a first some stockpiling of 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.660
 history the first america's army was 

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:55.160
 quite controversial given that propaganda 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:57.019
 Brazen to give me which I had besides 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.850
 as a simulator it was not reaching the 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:00.949
 levels that by then had 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.839
 of operation place point but I had a few 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:05.180
 good team war graphics that was 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:07.149
 quite entertaining and it was very deep 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.450
 as for accepted 

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:13.820
 and a lot of things that made that 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.110
 very entertaining game then it happened to a 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.539
 correct second part of which 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.119
 we improve when they come to us there is already something 

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:22.250
 rather more polished although the version 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.829
 until almost two last patches there are 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.479
 now it was impepinables to the first 

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:27.979
 versions were horrible gasped with 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:30.740
 really interests a few graphics of 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:33.770
 shit were improving pretty much up 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:36.530
 give a pretty polished product like now 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.810
 I say quite very complete very internal and 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.240
 with many features to be able 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.580
 Enjoy it especially in the team play 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.409
 sad america's army browning ground 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.170
 what it gives us is an experience something 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:50.149
 more frantic that is, it would be like that 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.580
 say it as a call of duty but without 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:55.310
 call of duty that is the fast system 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.229
 movements of such but with the 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.270
 obligatory that if we want 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:02.810
 to do it well we will have to use the temple and 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:06.709
 the only one here will not be garbage exists in 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:09.019
 this beta about four weapons of 13 4 12 

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:11.120
 miles and I adhere the m 14 br that 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:14.480
 you are seeing here with two miles 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.909
 I took a rector the machine gun of the 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.590
 49 with two measures of increase and that of 

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:20.269
 iron and a shotgun that is not worth 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.890
 absolutely for nothing 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:23.540
 There will also be several types of 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.280
 grenade among them to which also to 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.739
 your mold partner evidently very 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.209
 despicable and how skills will be 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:32.180
 the crawls are running and 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:33.890
 to duck down the take down that 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.129
 what you have seen before in the video is 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.129
 tell 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.160
 bless art that will be essential if we want 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.110
 recover life and if we do not want to die 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.090
 bled and also revived our 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:47.060
 companions to these we can not revive you 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.530
 obviously when they have fallen 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.980
 exercise or when we have 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:55.280
 fallen and it's a very fun experience 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.950
 given that marx in team play is 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.900
 required 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.430
 I have played the counterparts where yes 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.410
 there was some organization between guiris 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.330
 the truth that I have not played with Spaniards 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.030
 we did not have a pleasure but it gave a 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.910
 Very very didactic and very beautiful feeling 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:12.099
 there are two types of game among six 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:15.970
 players per team and twelve per team 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:19.630
 that is 16 and 24 forgiveness for 12 and 24 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:21.610
 players of villains to add and in which 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.380
 there will be different modes although the 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.209
 main will be or catch a flag in 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.549
 map medium and take it to your base as 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:30.040
 a tug we loosen the scarf 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:31.299
 all the life that in Spain or there will be another 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.190
 in which you have to carry your flag 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:34.959
 this fact respawn to yours 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.640
 brawn from your answers to yours and 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:38.500
 there's even one that could try a couple 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.329
 of times I get more I like that 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.720
 be that a team attacks and really 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:45.220
 deactivate as a kind of 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.450
 nuclear mechanisms maps 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.890
 mainly almost all are 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.480
 set in a thriller that is in 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.610
 a training camp will look like this 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.920
 as simulated cardboard vehicles but 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:56.890
 there are also indications for the map that 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.690
 you think that they will not also be of help 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:01.630
 example knowing in which morillos we can 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:04.450
 jump that our character 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:07.530
 and do it also taking advantage of other 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.530
 characteristics that have 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:13.900
 use it to cover what will be 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:17.410
 heights of me tall 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:19.270
 it's quite complex it will not be a size 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.130
 a cloth tarnishes endless expression 

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:23.050
 the machine guns obviously 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.670
 they consider support and roser with them will be 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.830
 quite difficult is something that we have 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:30.020
 800.000 of pace and we will measure the mouse 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:32.120
 down having a table of 2 km 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.560
 we can also use the selectors of 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.990
 shot in the branches that is available 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.610
 how can be the m 4 and as I tell you 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.110
 we also have in high school the 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:42.349
 which will get us out of some trouble 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.580
 occasionally when shooting an enemy he 

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:46.009
 we can do a sector ie 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.960
 approach him and tie him up so he does not 

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:50.270
 I can run away so that it can not be 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.550
 be revived everything go back tacos like almost 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:55.220
 so good because the desire can be 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:57.289
 bring something indispensable to my taste in 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:58.819
 shooters perhaps the only thing I miss 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:02.509
 less of this American 

00:04:58.819 --> 00:05:04.490
 in front of other more tactical cuts 

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:06.770
 is that there are no links, that is, 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:10.370
 inclinations or being in a wall 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:12.110
 and assume it makes up for it being very 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.630
 fun with a graphic finish like 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:18.229
 you can see a sound on fire 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:19.849
 obviously very real and free is that 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:21.650
 you can not ask for much more because it is 

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:24.740
 free you know that nobody is going to have 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:26.840
 better because you are not going to have any 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:29.150
 pit wing and you will be able to enjoy some 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.710
 very nice servers you will enjoy 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.509
 also from a pretty good community 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:34.830
 when it leaves the first few days usually 

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:36.330
 pretty pretty 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:38.490
 although this type of 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:41.040
 games then it gets a little more 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:43.500
 but when a bit of time passes 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:46.800
 a month has already passed and it will be a simple me 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:48.840
 or a little more used to this 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.340
 also good world knowing this 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.770
 game if you do not know it you will also have 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:56.880
 in sting like this the american be 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:58.110
 23 which is very entertaining if more 

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.970
 little more could you say some 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:02.160
 sensations connects correct sounds 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:03.900
 very nice graphics to be a game 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:07.140
 of this nature the control of weapons 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:08.970
 that is to say a wide very very nice and a 

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:11.310
 combat investment that are pretty 

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:13.440
 tense especially since it's free 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:15.300
 You can play it as a friend and not 

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:17.370
 asks a lot of machine in the description is 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:19.200
 leave the matchmaker where is it can 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:21.420
 go down and where you can review the 

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:23.390
 requirements without dismissing the lord 

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:25.440
 snake like and favorites if you liked 

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:26.490
 subscribed for more 

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:29.880
 I make you of those who have the 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:32.650
 comments to say your asked and 

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:35.280
 we see each other every day shingles 

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:35.280
 goodbye
