so<00:03:32.570> the<00:03:33.440> second<00:03:33.980> attachment<00:03:34.930> comes<00:03:36.370> with<00:03:37.370> this

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:37.550 
so the second attachment comes with this

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:44.610 
so the second attachment comes with this
this<00:03:38.150> is<00:03:38.330> small<00:03:38.810> grinding<00:03:39.850> barrel<00:03:40.850> and<00:03:42.640> this

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
this is small grinding barrel and this

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:50.500 
this is small grinding barrel and this
it's<00:03:45.670> small<00:03:46.670> shape<00:03:47.120> makes<00:03:47.840> it<00:03:48.080> like<00:03:49.120> easy<00:03:50.120> to

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
it's small shape makes it like easy to

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.920 
it's small shape makes it like easy to
reach<00:03:50.780> in<00:03:51.140> difficult<00:03:51.770> areas<00:03:52.340> and<00:03:52.640> it<00:03:53.180> carves

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
reach in difficult areas and it carves

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.380 
reach in difficult areas and it carves
