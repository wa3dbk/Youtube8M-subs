00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.910 

I<00:02:22.580> was<00:02:23.360> just<00:02:23.570> using<00:02:23.810> this<00:02:24.050> to<00:02:24.260> whittle<00:02:24.530> outside

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
I was just using this to whittle outside

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.970 
I was just using this to whittle outside
and<00:02:25.550> for<00:02:26.270> such<00:02:26.420> a<00:02:26.450> thin<00:02:26.840> knife<00:02:27.110> it's

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
and for such a thin knife it's

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.000 
and for such a thin knife it's
surprisingly<00:02:28.550> comfortable

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.030 

I<00:02:33.069> took<00:02:33.610> a<00:02:33.760> strop<00:02:34.150> this<00:02:34.510> I<00:02:34.659> got<00:02:34.840> a<00:02:34.870> razor<00:02:35.590> sharp

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
I took a strop this I got a razor sharp

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.850 
I took a strop this I got a razor sharp
but<00:02:36.689> now<00:02:37.689> it's<00:02:37.870> down<00:02:38.019> to<00:02:38.079> just<00:02:38.230> really<00:02:38.680> of<00:02:38.799> a

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
but now it's down to just really of a

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:48.590 
but now it's down to just really of a
working<00:02:39.280> edge

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.240
