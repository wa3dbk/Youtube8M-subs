00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
flavor I've never had curry before so I

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.110 
flavor I've never had curry before so I
don't<00:02:07.610> know<00:02:07.970> what<00:02:08.720> it<00:02:08.810> tastes<00:02:09.289> like<00:02:09.340> but<00:02:10.340> i'm

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
don't know what it tastes like but i'm

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.509 
don't know what it tastes like but i'm
just<00:02:11.269> guessing<00:02:11.989> that<00:02:12.410> it<00:02:12.530> tastes<00:02:13.010> kind<00:02:13.400> of

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:13.519 
just guessing that it tastes kind of

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:18.699 
just guessing that it tastes kind of
like<00:02:13.580> the<00:02:13.880> actual<00:02:14.269> thing<00:02:15.400> so<00:02:16.400> the<00:02:17.300> other<00:02:18.230> part

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
like the actual thing so the other part

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.360 
like the actual thing so the other part
of<00:02:18.920> it<00:02:19.070> visit<00:02:19.489> rice<00:02:19.730> I<00:02:20.030> don't<00:02:20.209> know<00:02:20.360> oh<00:02:21.370> just

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
of it visit rice I don't know oh just

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:28.410 
of it visit rice I don't know oh just
want<00:02:22.550> to<00:02:22.640> get<00:02:22.700> a<00:02:22.760> tiny<00:02:23.000> bit<00:02:23.209> oh<00:02:23.769> yeah

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.910 

I'm<00:02:28.900> guessing<00:02:29.319> that's<00:02:29.410> right<00:02:29.620> because<00:02:29.740> it

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
I'm guessing that's right because it

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.630 
I'm guessing that's right because it
tastes<00:02:30.069> like<00:02:30.130> rice<00:02:30.400> and<00:02:30.760> together<00:02:31.330> they<00:02:31.750> taste

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
tastes like rice and together they taste

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.380 
tastes like rice and together they taste
it's<00:02:33.640> actually<00:02:33.760> pretty<00:02:34.000> good<00:02:34.270> together

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
it's actually pretty good together

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.030 
it's actually pretty good together
