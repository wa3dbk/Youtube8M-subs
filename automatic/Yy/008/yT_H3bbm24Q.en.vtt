00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.260
 today we are in madrid is the last 

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:29.039
 song of our tour the rhythm of 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.529
 2013 is a casting 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:35.219
 and also interesting about both girls 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.140
 as well wide guys at the same time but it 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.309
 note a lot of potential there is a lot of potential 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.309
 in this case 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:58.550
 this final 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.550
 it has been like 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.250
 A) Yes 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:23.340
 I consider myself an open friendly person 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.430
 with ease to meet and meet people 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.610
 new because I really like to stay with 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.290
 the people and I have a lot of friends that 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.680
 they support me in everything and I love them very much 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:37.920
 I love to dance to party 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:42.840
 with my friends spend free time 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.900
 well or drawing on the computer and that 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.740
 is 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:50.830
 basic for the casting of barcelona not 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:53.320
 I prepared myself earlier because I knew it with very 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:56.560
 little too little time in advance so 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:59.820
 that it was all very fast and equally 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:02.470
 although I would have known with a few months 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.480
 before then I do not think that I do not 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.570
 I would have prepared nothing because I am 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:11.590
 as I am and if they like it well and if not 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:15.150
 you can what he said in each person is 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:19.080
 how it is and if it's going to come out and you introduce yourself 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:23.200
 in front of an audience and a jury and 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:27.370
 like yourself because you're going to like them more 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:31.480
 not if you do a diet or you 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:33.880
 prepare to walk have good as a 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.180
 a model or something because I believe I think 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.219
 what is necessary 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.700
 play if you're going to make a fool of yourself 

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:40.700
 it takes 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.410
 and special that I have to say is a 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.710
 brother who has passed the first 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:53.520
 Barcelona is casting a lot since 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:55.080
 has not done anything yet fashionable or write 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.880
 they are the dance 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.230
 now it 's in reus in the center of the 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.600
 reading 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.570
 and 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:05.640
 in my free time too 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:08.730
 I go out with my friends to walk along rivers 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:12.000
 in the center and I am a responsible girl 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.460
 when I arrive home after 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.340
 dine 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:17.170
 Then, with homework, they are already 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.900
 acts 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:23.540
 then I study and if I have time what 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:27.020
 that the exam already I know it because I go out with 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:29.120
 the friends I told them about the casting in 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:33.100
 my friends also got excited 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.100
 much more than me 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:39.580
 now that the semi-final is approaching 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.580
 madrid I'm more nervous 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.520
 for me it is one of the best castings 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:49.590
 of the tour both by science and by 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.300
 level of the candidates we take the 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.420
 decision among all because it was the 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:56.460
 our director the photographer javier and 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:00.900
 anthony of 3 get between all 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:03.420
 we made the decision but if it's a little 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:06.240
 distributed my name is albero silveira and 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:08.940
 I come from vigo I am 16 years old and I went to 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.650
 semifinal which at the beginning nervous 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.080
 logically been nervous because not 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.930
 you know the environment and such but good 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.310
 then you're a little relaxed and the 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.830
 balls when when they tell you that 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:22.620
 you passed you are already euphoric again Paula 

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:25.550
 with the chinchilla I come from vigo I've been 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:28.140
 selected for the semifinal of madrid 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:30.090
 and I know that the coruña casting was held 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.630
 but I could not go and I found out what was done 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.430
 Madrid 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.140
 I said good I'm going to take advantage and 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.450
 Welcome here to try 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.680
 my name is sofía gusto villota I have 16 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:39.479
 years 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.780
 Well they caught me for 13 months for 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:46.250
 the hair and I have to come here already 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.250
 see if it is to try your luck 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:03.590
 now comes what is the semifinal is 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:05.960
 to say is where we are going to take us all 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:07.430
 the finalists of the 5 castings and 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:11.150
 it's really where we're going to do the 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:14.390
 most serious screening is worth it because of this 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:17.180
 semifinal where we equal together like 50 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:20.210
 60 or even 80 candidates we have to 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.980
 get a final photo of about 20 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.780
 candidates that will be the ones that are going to 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:26.050
 dispute the final of barcelona in the month 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.050

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:40.490
 to everyone in the semifinal that will be 20 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:43.990
 June here in madrid I think it's going to 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:43.990
 be a great day for candidate texts
