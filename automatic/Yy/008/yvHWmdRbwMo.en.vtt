00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
which i really like i think is really

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.540 
which i really like i think is really
cool<00:00:48.360> having<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:48.870> patrolling<00:00:49.410> NPCs<00:00:49.829> help<00:00:50.160> you<00:00:50.340> I

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
cool having a patrolling NPCs help you I

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.990 
cool having a patrolling NPCs help you I
think<00:00:51.239> it<00:00:51.390> it<00:00:51.750> makes<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.379> lot<00:00:52.500> more<00:00:52.559> lifelike<00:00:53.550> in

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
think it it makes a lot more lifelike in

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.240 
think it it makes a lot more lifelike in
the<00:00:54.120> sense<00:00:54.360> that<00:00:54.480> you<00:00:54.719> know<00:00:55.039> not<00:00:56.039> all<00:00:56.100> the

was<00:01:31.259> going<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.470> be<00:01:31.880> because<00:01:32.880> it<00:01:33.119> was<00:01:33.240> another

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
saving the animals quest I was thinking

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.330 
saving the animals quest I was thinking
it<00:01:36.000> was<00:01:36.090> gonna<00:01:36.150> be<00:01:36.270> something<00:01:36.450> similar<00:01:36.990> to

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
it was gonna be something similar to

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.920 
it was gonna be something similar to
saving<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.369> rabbits<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:38.939> stuff<00:01:39.210> from<00:01:39.600> the

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
fire elementals and the fire and the

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.330 
fire elementals and the fire and the
burning<00:01:41.880> trees<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:42.990> stuff<00:01:43.140> and<00:01:43.920> it's<00:01:44.070> kind<00:01:44.310> of

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
burning trees and stuff and it's kind of

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.649 
burning trees and stuff and it's kind of
similar<00:01:44.520> flat<00:01:44.759> in<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:44.939> sense<00:01:45.149> that<00:01:45.270> you<00:01:45.630> are

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
similar flat in the sense that you are
