 pick up 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:09.399
 all the module you see now lit up 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.290
 green all active to push took 

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:15.750
 you now need to enter the access code let 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:18.250
 let's let's take 234 followed 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.479

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:23.229
 confirmed and now the lines of the peaks 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.960
 load on keys for load 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:27.970
 just click I carry push all 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.429

 Now managed by this aid worked dota 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:57.630
 turned over means the module itself 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:02:02.740
 directly here it is j7 it is 7 900 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:06.369
