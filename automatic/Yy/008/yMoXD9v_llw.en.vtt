because we want to train this one to be
doing<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.309> flying<00:00:38.550> displays<00:00:38.969> it's<00:00:39.239> going<00:00:39.390> to

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
doing the flying displays it's going to

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.280 
doing the flying displays it's going to
be<00:00:39.540> a<00:00:39.570> big<00:00:39.829> eagle<00:00:40.829> ow<00:00:41.480> if<00:00:42.480> it's<00:00:42.660> female<00:00:42.840> she

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
be a big eagle ow if it's female she

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
could have around a 6-foot wingspan and

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.700 
could have around a 6-foot wingspan and
weigh<00:00:45.120> about<00:00:45.239> 10<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.690> 12<00:00:45.899> pounds<00:00:46.230> in<00:00:46.320> weight<00:00:46.500> so

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
weigh about 10 to 12 pounds in weight so

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:47.959 
weigh about 10 to 12 pounds in weight so
she's<00:00:46.860> giving<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.100> nice<00:00:47.219> big<00:00:47.430> one<00:00:47.579> we<00:00:47.700> could<00:00:47.850> use

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
she's giving a nice big one we could use

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.000 
she's giving a nice big one we could use
for<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.210> flying<00:00:48.480> display<00:00:48.899> if<00:00:49.230> it's<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.500> male<00:00:49.710> we

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
for the flying display if it's a male we

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.830 
for the flying display if it's a male we
don't<00:00:50.219> know<00:00:50.460> just<00:00:50.730> yet<00:00:50.910> they're<00:00:51.600> going<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.750> be

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
don't know just yet they're going to be

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.830 
don't know just yet they're going to be
slightly<00:00:52.110> smaller<00:00:52.379> then<00:00:53.250> we<00:00:53.399> can<00:00:53.670> go<00:00:53.840> haha

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
slightly smaller then we can go haha

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.229 
slightly smaller then we can go haha
this<00:00:55.170> is<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.379> tricky<00:00:55.620> bit<00:00:55.910> generally<00:00:56.910> like<00:00:57.059> so

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
this is the tricky bit generally like so

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.670 
this is the tricky bit generally like so
when<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.449> fully<00:00:57.660> grown<00:00:57.750> we<00:00:58.109> can<00:00:58.230> go<00:00:58.379> my

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
when the fully grown we can go my

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.000 
when the fully grown we can go my
females<00:00:59.280> are<00:00:59.430> bigger<00:00:59.550> than<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.879> males<00:01:01.010> and

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
females are bigger than the males and

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.410 
females are bigger than the males and
the<00:01:02.340> bigger<00:01:02.520> they<00:01:02.670> get<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.940> bigger<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.239> size

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
the bigger they get the bigger the size

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.570 
the bigger they get the bigger the size
difference<00:01:03.930> so<00:01:04.140> once<00:01:04.320> it's<00:01:04.559> kind<00:01:04.860> of<00:01:04.979> around

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
difference so once it's kind of around

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.640 
difference so once it's kind of around
six<00:01:06.030> seven<00:01:06.420> months<00:01:06.540> we<00:01:06.780> may<00:01:06.930> be<00:01:06.990> able<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.260> go<00:01:07.439> on

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
six seven months we may be able to go on

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.310 
six seven months we may be able to go on
the<00:01:08.430> weight<00:01:08.640> of<00:01:08.850> it<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.240> speak<00:01:09.780> size<00:01:10.080> the

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
the weight of it and the speak size the

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.020 
the weight of it and the speak size the
the<00:01:10.350> females<00:01:11.010> have<00:01:11.159> a<00:01:11.220> lot<00:01:11.369> bigger<00:01:11.549> feet<00:01:11.850> in

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
the females have a lot bigger feet in

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.210 
the females have a lot bigger feet in
the<00:01:12.150> males<00:01:12.360> we've<00:01:12.750> got<00:01:12.930> quite<00:01:13.830> big<00:01:14.040> ones

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
the males we've got quite big ones

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.160 
the males we've got quite big ones
already<00:01:14.369> having<00:01:15.150> it<00:01:15.530> and<00:01:16.610> good<00:01:17.610> thank<00:01:17.909> you<00:01:18.170> do

already having it and good thank you do

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.390 
already having it and good thank you do
any<00:01:19.320> other<00:01:19.380> way<00:01:19.650> really<00:01:19.950> because<00:01:20.100> they've<00:01:20.250> got

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
any other way really because they've got

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.859 
any other way really because they've got
something<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.850> same<00:01:21.030> plumage<00:01:21.450> it's<00:01:21.659> quite

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
something the same plumage it's quite

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.039 
something the same plumage it's quite
tricky<00:01:22.110> it's<00:01:22.439> actually<00:01:22.770> DNA<00:01:23.159> testing<00:01:23.700> okay<00:01:24.509> to

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
tricky it's actually DNA testing okay to

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.270 
tricky it's actually DNA testing okay to
be<00:01:25.140> honest<00:01:25.409> we're<00:01:25.530> not<00:01:25.560> going<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:25.890> breed<00:01:26.100> from

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
be honest we're not going to breed from

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.710 
be honest we're not going to breed from
him<00:01:26.490> because<00:01:26.759> he's<00:01:27.060> going<00:01:27.180> to<00:01:27.270> be<00:01:27.330> trained<00:01:27.570> for

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
him because he's going to be trained for

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.870 
him because he's going to be trained for
flying<00:01:27.930> displays<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.619> things<00:01:28.799> like<00:01:28.979> that<00:01:29.040> he

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
flying displays and things like that he

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.609 
flying displays and things like that he
won't<00:01:30.000> be<00:01:30.150> thread<00:01:30.479> so<00:01:30.900> we<00:01:31.049> probably<00:01:31.200> won't

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
won't be thread so we probably won't

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.350 
won't be thread so we probably won't
bother<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:31.979> DNA<00:01:32.520> test<00:01:32.820> it's<00:01:33.000> just<00:01:33.060> another

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
bother to DNA test it's just another

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.600 
bother to DNA test it's just another
expense<00:01:33.780> we'd<00:01:33.960> have<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.170> fork<00:01:34.380> out<00:01:34.500> so<00:01:35.460> we're

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
expense we'd have to fork out so we're

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.130 
expense we'd have to fork out so we're
probably<00:01:35.700> just<00:01:35.880> waiting<00:01:36.210> till<00:01:36.479> it's<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:36.990> bit

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
probably just waiting till it's a bit

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.499 
probably just waiting till it's a bit
bigger<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:37.829> go<00:01:38.430> by<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.640> feet<00:01:38.909> size<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.450> the
