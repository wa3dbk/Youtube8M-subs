00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.969 
back two and then back three I would do
this<00:01:55.579> for<00:01:55.789> about<00:01:55.939> five<00:01:56.210> sets<00:01:56.590> minute<00:01:57.590> rest<00:01:57.770> in

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
this for about five sets minute rest in

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:00.130 
this for about five sets minute rest in
between<00:01:58.069> the<00:01:58.399> sets<00:01:58.670> if<00:01:59.270> you<00:01:59.420> find<00:01:59.689> a<00:01:59.780> minute

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
between the sets if you find a minute

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.419 
between the sets if you find a minute
rest<00:02:00.259> is<00:02:00.500> not<00:02:00.679> long<00:02:00.979> enough

00:02:01.419 --> 00:02:01.429 
rest is not long enough

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:03.760 
rest is not long enough
this<00:02:01.789> exercise<00:02:02.229> probably<00:02:03.229> not<00:02:03.469> for<00:02:03.709> you
