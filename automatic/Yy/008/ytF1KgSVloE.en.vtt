00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.910
 but I relay these facts with great figures like other entities 

00:00:10.189 --> 00:00:11.369
 I love him and sir 

00:00:11.369 --> 00:00:14.369
 sure of himself since 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.369
 from one moment to another 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:20.749
 another name but now contraband 

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:22.880
 today I was facing repair houses 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.789
 simply with 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:27.960
 and I'm very happy 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.069
 good thing you're clarifying this a lot of people 

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:33.700
 the aesthetic taste molotov acne 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.200
 I had sociology pro person that you say 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.200
 canvas traveled not yes but I believe that people 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.560
 at the same time, he is the one who commands and because he has 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.050
 I think he makes more efficient since between four years 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.120
 I think he makes sense that I think he's more than proven 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.930
 and I believe that the world sends us help to haiti party 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.410
 give everything the maximum figures of the dogs of evil 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.510
 the watery dog 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.910
 but abas in future dates to the lagoon to face them and triple to 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:05.790
 as it happened 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.790
 equally since in July of this year which 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.790
 with the Argentine he found arguments that will face the file behind 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.970
 of the world 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:17.030
 equally large 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.330
 duel of fighters 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.520
 with great surprises we will never see 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.520
 it's because in the lagoon where he reiterated 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.130
 comparisons about his bad situation of his father who join the 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.270
 flight project 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.350
 it is a legend 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.720
 you how do you feel with the comparisons that are made 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.720
 finally before the comparisons I think there was a comparison 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:39.600
 and here 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.230
 in them it is lowered 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.410
 and I believe that the client and mediates critical comparisons 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.770
 this congratulations 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.810
 at the same time the salary of the welcome fish and the own 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.430
 and as I tell you, a year ago people 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.860
 At the same time, the young people started to resort and that's why 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.210
 suddenly 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.630
 people what places the star places think you have to go step 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.400
 Not very successful in the face of these criticisms 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.069
 I say as I have been I think that in this very happy for this case 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.069
 I think 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:11.979
 although they are welcome at the same time can help me a lot 

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:14.159
 but I think that 

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:15.099
 it is a process 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:18.339
 since this is something that there is no credit 

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:20.329
 cubillo by time 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:23.329
 if I'm missing a lot of canvas network programs 

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:25.139

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:31.579

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:32.410
 a father father 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.539
 I think that you also company 

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:36.799
 it will not help at all 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:38.709
 in fact you do not know 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:40.269

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:42.429

00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:53.819

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.169
 gilbride as around reality 

00:02:56.169 --> 00:02:57.949
 the contract pointed 

00:02:57.949 --> 00:03:00.249
 so I congratulate women in the fight 

00:03:00.249 --> 00:03:03.249
 we understand and savior building roundabout 

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:05.559
 the bichi vicente manuel fraga 

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:08.909
 even a work that he himself saw made with her that they bring nothing my 

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:10.049
 place 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:12.279

 He reminded me that he should help me to tell me the good and the bad about him 

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:29.639
 during the night off 

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:32.589
 pickering and calm that time to time and it depleted both
