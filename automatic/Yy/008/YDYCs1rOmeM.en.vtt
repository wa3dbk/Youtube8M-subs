 a chain that just celebrated his 10 years at home, but do not panic 

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:22.019

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.149

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.010
 to assist them 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.620
 I was expecting 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.530
 big names the accordion as paschal said a while ago adoption 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.170
 especially help it was of course I'm planning the first one that marked his 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.630
 first 45 laps I know that the pace because the first one speaks is because it is 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.700
 rengorge primature like a lot of people 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.840
 this is the second it was my Oscar how they did 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.740
 those who gave us as long empty two played more than one team 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.740
 tuning seven instruments this is the big ones like 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.210
 muzzle viewer at ahvaz is free that would of course be 06 plastic I 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:26.380
 do not forget of course but 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.820
 what I really loved most of all was of course I 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.939
 prepared I'm really glad that that pascale and eddy this rescue because 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.649
 that I love because at my first mission is already successful as 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:39.500
 I was inflated the TV set with perseverance the first fusion 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.110
 was it him when he will have to thank him in my game is the first 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.670
 miss hand the first time when I was ever present 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.780
 and I understand them now it's been ten years since we made a hundred 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.760
 resignation studies I had the happiness of rubbing on paschal stage 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.630
 sevran for a few months and 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.580
 I mean, if I'm here it's 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.380
 at 120% in its wake 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.360
 because that's so good defender of French song no room for 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.659
 a passionate defender and a world of accordion 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:04.619
 the French song that hugs it is very important for us for the 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.140
 French song heritage but also a great defender 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.220
 from the other side cord is someone who has a cost for the accordion and 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.420
 it makes them feel good in its shows because it gives a lot to 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.950
 young people like me to express themselves, it gives the public the chance to 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.999
 bigger audience to listen to accordion city it's great 

00:02:19.999 --> 00:02:23.189
 so for you television come on television because we do not see this 

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:25.319
 that it takes someone of great notoriety 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.399
 % and public service 

00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:30.769
 of internet tv often you have time between galas between 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:34.179
 the recordings in his studio because you have your own studio there too 

00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:35.020
 with three years 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.470
 like the young musician who says I'm a Catholic no practitioners 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.900
 paris fc rejoiced in this very pretty jade form in the TV i'm 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:42.130
 a 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.700
 I eat TV and I take too much watching I go very often to 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.780
 cinema i want i arrange myself for a fault at the cinema a week and the 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.250
 just novel support it also keeps me busy all day because guys there 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.510
 are of course every weekend in fact a lot of kilometers is pretty much 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.900
 near 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.279
 70 90 km equal this year 

00:02:56.279 --> 00:02:57.630
 so that's why 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.120
 over there next week three days of quote and fickle them 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.660
 will occupy studio record for me we will also be able to friends or 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.629
 people from my region ordered pizzas is also confirmed 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:09.679
 reserved as for the accordion this studio then to 

00:03:09.679 --> 00:03:13.379
 to the song to that good I'm also specialized people know 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:15.240
 for you to accompany him what I am so 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:16.669
 yet what it is 

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:19.799
 what I know of de2 of the chorus accordion of the experience that I 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:23.109
 begins to see that obvious jacky in the studio if I want to give five 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:26.319
 young friend's other turns that also arrive and I want to give them in 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:26.760
 Party 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.620
 I would say arrangements the musical knowledge except in 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.869
 106 points loop reserved 

00:03:31.869 --> 00:03:35.599
 this game is not only to the chords list but I was 90% that the 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:36.349
 canteen 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:38.669
 so we are nearing the end of this interview program 

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:42.419
 and yes already his vita is talking to them like your projects despite all that 

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:43.579
 you realized 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:46.950
 in his last 23 years as his project today when the 

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:49.939
 project today I think it's to continue just like that because 

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:51.020
 that often everything then from 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.860
 to make thousands of people dance to join a piece that turns to me 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:55.290
 who have just for this fabulous 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.630
 with an orchestra of their box whose nine on stage musician the big 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:03:59.860
 it's a big show these 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.279
 it was something teams that have a lot of heart and percent 

00:04:03.279 --> 00:04:03.989
 I would say that 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:07.299
 hurry to turn his doors to the studio side and then to climb as 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:09.480
 said at the beginning of the show the sleeves to become coach 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.540
 even better known and then two of two I would say to make known 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:13.230
 also 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.419
 at the accordion to the game of the young clientele that is happening now because 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:16.720

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.120
 cimpor time to make our lack of the rope otherwise than broken by jazz 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.340
 by the classic and 7 hours 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.210

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.419
