00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:19.210
 you hold a joint there is for 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:21.690
 this is this kinda my first 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:24.580
 product impression 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:27.190

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.260
 tester foundation from l''oreal 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:32.290
 Paris and the manufacturer assures that our 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:34.180
 all our skin will be filled with light 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.460
 imperfections of the skin will be 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.910
 hidden durability foundation for 12 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:43.089
 hours and 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.769
 our skin will be just perfect too 

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:47.409
 perfect tone without flaws 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:50.760
 now I do not quite skin will 

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:53.650
 put along with you got me 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.290
 shade a natural beige number 4 i 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:01:00.089
 I do not know maybe it will be unreal dark 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.089
 but I think it's worth a try 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:10.299
 so look creamy flavor usual as 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:13.299
 all Welsh sky sky channels are very 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:14.890
 hard kidney tonometer what let's 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:17.430
 try to wear as you see with me 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.329
 there is redness on the face 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.270
 imperfection some kind of their own 

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:27.299
 I will put such nasty things here 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:29.680
 brush this we have sigma flat kabuki 80 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:34.930
 carpenters specifically for applying 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:37.289
 tonal basis I type on the brush very 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.719
 a light foundation is applied easily 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:43.119
 thin layer 

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:47.939
 although the color is slightly dark but how can I 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:51.549
 seems less more or less came 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.380
 well put out even a lot put on 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:57.060
 that is, my hand will be Tetris 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:59.230
 this is too much i think now 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.270
 will be enough 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:06.700
 try to hide bruises under the eyes 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:09.300
 I will be drunk with my finger 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.300
 seems to be nice 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.909
 and start by spitting on your flaws 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.790
 so I put a tonal foundation on my face 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.500
 in principle, that's so much the amount of this 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.840
 foundation is enough to 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:32.830
 put on face 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:34.510
 that's why we delete it all in order 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.360
 so that it could be on the north 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:40.150
 go outside i think i am now 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.550
 combing my eyebrows and applying a lip gloss 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.319
 and so principle makeup for every day 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.370
 ready if you have problem skin 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:48.160
 need to say some imperfections 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.510
 I think this tonalnik right now 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.540
 at the moment it's beautiful 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:55.300
 I managed to try a little 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.100
 You can hide some of your little keys 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.080
 flaws on the face including for here 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:03.550
 I'm here vascular bruise star 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:05.680
 under the eyes good fast easy 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.540
 applied well 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.380
 color seems to me no different no 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:14.050
 look at the fact that these are white here 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:16.420
 the medicine is not bad and I will not powder 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:18.069
 so it will be more interesting to learn how are you 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.780
 foundation cream because I know what 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:21.780
 many do not like the top when you pull 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:29.680
 this again i'm brownie kuzya 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:31.630
 in general i am back she is now evening i 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:36.310
 was in extreme conditions I was on 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:39.010
 dancing and what can i say that principle 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.410
 tonal framework normally held 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.450
 Well kept on face only 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.940
 here it is a little cattle 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:48.710
 lotions and of course my salvation was 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.990
 matting napkins because 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:52.580
 tonal framework was in extreme 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:55.490
 conditions as told was on dancing 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:59.540
 so you need to matting 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:01.400
 napkins and so is my final verdict 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.830
 what a good tonal basis 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.530
 Look I liked every 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:08.630
