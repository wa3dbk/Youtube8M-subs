00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.240
 um hi dear friends with you i tap u 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.610
 us another issue heading cranes on 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.590
 this time we are from 6 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:32.770
 I forgot to remind you to subscribe to my 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:35.079
 VKontakte group yes link in description 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:38.829
 all interesting and this map line 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:41.399
 Siegfried of 6 that he can not say 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:45.280
 we have enough experienced player 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:47.620
 see him at the bottom left and plays 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.480
 he is solely on goldie but how are we 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.289
 we know that most players skills 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.679
 use 

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:56.319
 is a 6 is not to farm loans and 

00:00:53.679 --> 00:01:01.479
 it is for dima to anal type 

00:00:56.319 --> 00:01:03.609
 and this is due to the fact or that flash drives 

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:05.970
 fairly weak penetrability in the area 

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:09.670
 one hundred and seventy with podkaliberov 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:12.100
 217 and thanks to his mad dpm 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.049
 there is a loss per minute of 6 myself very 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.380
 Feels comfortable on subcaliber 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:19.240
 shells and since it is exactly 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.210
 premium technique he does not leave it 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.950
 in minus loans and sometimes even in 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.050
 plus but the truth was the moment when 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.810
 ponerfili precisely profitability not 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.100
 yield or rather oil Rome 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.350
 cost and sub-caliber shells and 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.920
 now he is of course less likely to farm than before 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:38.050
 here before course it was possible without difficulty 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:41.260
 farm on this tank and our hero see 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:45.310
 that competently just like in tournament battles 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:48.570
 there are top teams tanking that is with us 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:52.080
 Of course, not pike nose, but he is also 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.280
 tell me straight and overboard tank 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.470
 complicated i.e. a diamond 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.150
 because you turn your cheek under 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.700
 straight slopes will pierce you and 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:03.970
 what he does he exactly tank ass 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.830
 the mind becomes backwards and well you saw before 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.880
 this and start to move a little and 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.250
 then all fall 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.099
 either of the bulwark or aboard 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.500
 which leads to rebound and here it is 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:15.970
 leaves to 40 four and like real 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.800
 Soviet tank with the guard in the shchi 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.819
 and we remind you that recharge with 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:24.100
 all wes 6 buns are less than 10 seconds 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:26.600
 while with all of the gold and 217 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.910
 penetration and 390 single 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.560
 Rona accuracy of course we limp 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.690
 so I tanks me personally 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.670
 don't like him riding me he doesn't 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.410
 like precisely because of its accuracy but 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.260
 most skill players on it 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:42.110
 bend have just some not that 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:45.890
 high is not that great performance 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:47.450
 damage but just phenomenal without 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.820
 exaggerations of some players 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.400
 really just three and a half 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:55.850
 thousands of damage on it considering it's 8 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:59.390
 grace level is such a second 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:01.220
 minute we tell the masturbate damash considering 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.050
 the fact that not all players even on the tenth 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.120
 levels so much damage there and here you can 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:07.790
 on the eighth benefits so have therefore 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:11.210
 many many players exactly love it 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:13.490
 tank with his gold shells he 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:16.580
 good enough dynamics for both 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:19.420
 strand has a good gun excellent DPM 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:23.600
 good armor low silhouette 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:25.520
 well and everyone he likes blood me i don't 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.410
 I know why my farts can not stand 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:30.050
 this gun because the gun is so 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:32.090
 Cass repulsed that when you shoot not 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:35.090
 sometimes you just want to scream 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:37.880
 and delete this game but if everything is correct 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:40.180
 come down competently shoot if you have 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.020
 pumped crew is natural 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.570
 premium tank and 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:46.850
 with any soviet soviet you can here 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:48.800
 without fines transplant crew hey just 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:51.500
 swing the crew while bending down there 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.960
 farm experience and much more and while i'm 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.170
 here the score began to chat 8-12 our hero 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:58.040
 spin on the zigfrid line here 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:00.350
 he heals by the way very well and 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:03.830
 competently all enemy tanks especially 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:05.120
 at15 when you had to the right on the cheek and you 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:06.620
 training he didnâ€™t shoot exactly on the cheek 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.390
 because there is breaking through most likely in 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.670
 This gun was not enough and bummed it 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:13.670
 top bar and it is very competent I 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:16.070
 I'll tell you, well, the player is almost purple 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:18.710
 so let's say not here are four foursome something 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.870
 drove ass unfortunately got no damage 

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:22.520
 drove somewhere shoots 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.740
 not clear but she still stock 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.930
 Of course, she's from the 6 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.970
 break through and sadness lies friends 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.250
 Now that mxm 4 note is natural 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:33.140
 punches there gun we have the worst he 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.390
 gets exactly to the side see over 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:37.610
 screen screens we get this one 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:38.520
 Part A above is of course a lot to punch 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.550
 easier 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:44.490
 from all from all sides of our our 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:46.949
 soviet heavy tank surround 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:49.919
 allies naturally all merge mxm 

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:54.060
 445 already just do not know what that panic 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:57.419
 running away and by the way yes a small minus 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:05:00.300
 his tank is that his ass is very 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:02.669
 long and big and just doesn't give it 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.530
 lower the guns look he just 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:06.900
 some kind of panic somewhere taranets but apparently 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:08.819
 kretov layer there engine him crit nuri he 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:11.520
 can not turn around to lower this gun 

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:12.810
 and it is natural that in pate go somewhere 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:16.830
 seventh of you that we should not be sitting 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:19.830
 vyselivat bottom or hatch this one 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:22.229
 mechvoda as it is also called birdhouses 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.800
 or there it is different in general behind 

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:24.360
 prototype 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.310
 And prototype is of course even more 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:28.830
 dangerous shit his recharge 8 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:30.690
 seconds and 400 damage with 250 punctures 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:33.389
 punch it will be absolutely everywhere but 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:36.270
 here was lucky and famous for rebounding 

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:37.590
 by tp it certainly wins us and 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.990
 our hero understands this and tries 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:41.969
 trying to somehow somehow drive off and 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:45.050
 hide behind work but unfortunately he has 

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:49.259
 it doesn't quite work out and right here 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:51.060
 Naturally and everything is clear that the prototype 

00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:52.669
 cover yes that's another seconds to 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:55.830
 shoot but 

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:57.719
 lucky lucky punches his cheeks all right 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:59.520
 I aim I would try somewhere of course 

00:05:57.719 --> 00:06:01.380
 vytselivat machine gunner there is also no armor 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.690
 especially a lot but our hero 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:07.409
 pulling cheeks punches and just once 

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:09.360
 wears the whole house wounds just in pieces to 3 

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:12.180
 Well , of course we would not have come out 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:15.449
 what type basically does here 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:18.419
 It would seem to get the type from him by the way. 

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:22.349
 recharge and naturally faster by 250 

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:24.719
 damage and he kills kills gold but on 

00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:27.090
 sadness is that two landmine unlikely 

00:06:24.719 --> 00:06:29.490
 full dive visor from one landmine yet 

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:31.860
 I had to pick up the card later to win 

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:34.110
 but the allies have all merged 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:36.030
 and as always the old good old 

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:38.370
 This problem Koran comrade 

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:40.169
 extra blasts friends no more than one 

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:42.060
 carry it here he has another pasha 

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:44.280
 one landmine let's say taypu bond scored 

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:46.469
 Butterfly Arthur was already able to blow mines therefore 

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:48.180
 it is not even insulting that the swamp here I got but 

00:06:46.469 --> 00:06:51.599
 while with all friends defeat and 

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:54.180
 3000 about it well yes it is natural 

00:06:51.599 --> 00:06:56.729
 further as for victory even for victory 300 

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:59.099
 friends friends 3 worth the team anyway 

00:06:56.729 --> 00:07:01.289
 fuses eight and a half thousand damage 

00:06:59.099 --> 00:07:03.449
 it's just sadness I would be in its place 

00:07:01.289 --> 00:07:06.479
 just crying all the efforts down the drain 

00:07:03.449 --> 00:07:09.180
 roughly speaking, at least either experience as 

00:07:06.479 --> 00:07:13.520
 relies hope you friends 

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:13.520
 I liked an interesting battle mad tank 

00:07:14.389 --> 00:07:21.120
 9 frags per platoon 85 thousand damage 300 

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:22.500
 experience and still they will merge 

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:24.449
 subscribe to the channel put likes 

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:26.069
 Good luck in the randomness, I hope you donâ€™t 

00:07:24.449 --> 00:07:28.289
 will come across such good ones 

00:07:26.069 --> 00:07:30.270
 quotes allies with you was I tap it 

00:07:28.289 --> 00:07:32.479
 there was another issue of heading cranes for now 

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:32.479
 until
