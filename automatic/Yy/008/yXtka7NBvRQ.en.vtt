00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
hair slip I did it in sections I

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.539 
hair slip I did it in sections I
actually<00:01:49.079> deep<00:01:49.470> condition<00:01:50.009> with<00:01:50.250> it<00:01:50.399> in

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
actually deep condition with it in

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.460 
actually deep condition with it in
sections<00:01:50.909> and<00:01:51.240> big<00:01:51.420> twist<00:01:51.720> all<00:01:51.899> of<00:01:52.020> my<00:01:52.140> hand<00:01:52.350> I

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
sections and big twist all of my hand I

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.069 
sections and big twist all of my hand I
did<00:01:52.680> it<00:01:52.799> with<00:01:52.890> heat<00:01:53.189> for<00:01:53.820> like<00:01:54.000> 30<00:01:54.570> minutes<00:01:54.659> I

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
did it with heat for like 30 minutes I

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.410 
did it with heat for like 30 minutes I
think<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.350> direction<00:01:55.649> says<00:01:56.009> 20<00:01:56.549> but<00:01:57.090> I<00:01:57.119> did<00:01:57.329> it

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
think the direction says 20 but I did it

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.719 
think the direction says 20 but I did it
for<00:01:57.479> about<00:01:57.600> 30<00:01:57.869> minutes<00:01:58.140> I<00:01:58.439> let<00:01:59.070> don't<00:01:59.460> even

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
for about 30 minutes I let don't even

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.539 
for about 30 minutes I let don't even
longer<00:01:59.969> I<00:02:00.869> did<00:02:01.590> it<00:02:01.680> with<00:02:01.770> heat<00:02:02.009> for<00:02:02.159> 30<00:02:02.250> minutes

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
longer I did it with heat for 30 minutes

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.100 
longer I did it with heat for 30 minutes
but<00:02:02.729> I<00:02:02.790> actually<00:02:02.969> left<00:02:03.270> it<00:02:03.450> on<00:02:03.540> longer<00:02:03.930> because

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
but I actually left it on longer because
