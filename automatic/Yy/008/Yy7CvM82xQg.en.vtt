00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
sure well a tremor is is not altogether

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.590

uncommon<00:00:40.680> people<00:00:41.550> sometimes<00:00:42.149> drink<00:00:42.360> too<00:00:42.510> much

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
coffee and see some tremor but this is

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.760 
coffee and see some tremor but this is
really<00:00:44.309> different<00:00:44.820> when<00:00:45.539> tremor<00:00:46.050> is<00:00:46.230> present

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
really different when tremor is present

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.860 
really different when tremor is present
most<00:00:47.610> of<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.850> time<00:00:48.059> but<00:00:48.329> particularly<00:00:48.570> during

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
most of the time but particularly during

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.720 
most of the time but particularly during
the<00:00:48.930> day<00:00:49.110> when<00:00:49.289> people<00:00:49.559> are<00:00:49.680> awake<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.280> when

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
the day when people are awake and when

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.189 
the day when people are awake and when
they're<00:00:50.879> using<00:00:51.180> their<00:00:51.300> hands<00:00:51.600> doing<00:00:51.899> things

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
they're using their hands doing things

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.490 
they're using their hands doing things
like<00:00:52.289> eating<00:00:52.860> drinking<00:00:53.870> we<00:00:54.870> were<00:00:54.989> doing<00:00:55.289> the

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
like eating drinking we were doing the

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.990 
like eating drinking we were doing the
things<00:00:55.860> that<00:00:55.920> work<00:00:56.129> with<00:00:56.340> tools<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:56.910> their

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
things that work with tools and their

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.520 
things that work with tools and their
hands<00:00:57.210> begin<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.690> shake<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:57.989> it's<00:00:58.410> a

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
hands begin to shake and it's a

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.619 
hands begin to shake and it's a
persistent<00:00:59.100> problem<00:00:59.129> then<00:01:00.059> that<00:01:00.239> most<00:01:00.480> likely

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
persistent problem then that most likely

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.330 
persistent problem then that most likely
is<00:01:00.870> caused<00:01:01.199> by<00:01:01.469> something<00:01:01.739> called<00:01:01.890> essential

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
is caused by something called essential

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.520 
is caused by something called essential
tremor<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:03.229> really<00:01:04.229> it's<00:01:04.350> been

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
tremor and really it's been

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.679 
tremor and really it's been
underappreciated<00:01:05.220> for<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:05.519> long<00:01:05.700> time<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.390> for

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
underappreciated for a long time and for

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.630 
underappreciated for a long time and for
many<00:01:06.869> years<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:07.890> years<00:01:08.070> it<00:01:08.220> was<00:01:08.340> called

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
many years and years it was called

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.219 
many years and years it was called
benign<00:01:08.970> essential<00:01:09.540> tremor<00:01:09.750> meaning<00:01:10.110> that

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
benign essential tremor meaning that

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.620 
benign essential tremor meaning that
there<00:01:11.070> really<00:01:11.189> wasn't<00:01:11.580> any<00:01:11.820> association<00:01:12.479> with

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
there really wasn't any association with

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.660 
there really wasn't any association with
other<00:01:12.750> problems<00:01:13.380> like<00:01:13.470> Parkinson's<00:01:14.250> disease

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
other problems like Parkinson's disease

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.940 
other problems like Parkinson's disease
but<00:01:15.000> what<00:01:15.600> we<00:01:15.720> found<00:01:15.930> is<00:01:16.229> that's<00:01:16.439> not<00:01:16.590> run<00:01:16.799> not

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
but what we found is that's not run not

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.700 
but what we found is that's not run not
really<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.369> case<00:01:17.750> that<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:19.140> tremor<00:01:19.380> can<00:01:19.590> it

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
really the case that the tremor can it

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.390 
really the case that the tremor can it
be<00:01:19.920> actually<00:01:20.310> very<00:01:21.920> disabling<00:01:22.920> sometimes

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
be actually very disabling sometimes

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.649 
be actually very disabling sometimes
even<00:01:23.670> though<00:01:23.729> it's<00:01:23.880> not<00:01:24.000> associated<00:01:24.509> with

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
even though it's not associated with

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.899 
even though it's not associated with
Parkinson's<00:01:24.990> disease<00:01:25.439> just<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.549> fact<00:01:26.759> of

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
Parkinson's disease just the fact of

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.340 
Parkinson's disease just the fact of
having<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.270> tremor<00:01:27.540> that<00:01:27.630> can<00:01:27.930> become<00:01:28.080> very

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
having a tremor that can become very

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.440 
having a tremor that can become very
severe<00:01:29.130> can<00:01:29.340> really<00:01:29.579> keep<00:01:29.790> people<00:01:29.820> from<00:01:30.299> doing

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
severe can really keep people from doing

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.660 
severe can really keep people from doing
things<00:01:30.810> that<00:01:30.900> they<00:01:31.049> need<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.320> do<00:01:31.500> at<00:01:32.130> work<00:01:32.400> and

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
things that they need to do at work and

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.460 
things that they need to do at work and
also<00:01:32.820> from<00:01:33.119> interfering<00:01:33.689> with<00:01:33.840> just<00:01:34.229> doing

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
also from interfering with just doing

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.630 
also from interfering with just doing
basic<00:01:34.590> things<00:01:35.009> throughout<00:01:35.310> their<00:01:35.460> day<00:01:35.579> today

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
and why do these happen well it's still

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.649 
and why do these happen well it's still
not<00:01:40.439> really<00:01:40.710> clear<00:01:41.220> there's<00:01:41.490> definitely<00:01:42.479> some

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
not really clear there's definitely some

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.510 
not really clear there's definitely some
type<00:01:42.840> of<00:01:42.869> hereditary<00:01:43.590> component<00:01:43.890> there<00:01:44.399> that

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
type of hereditary component there that

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.429 
type of hereditary component there that
runs<00:01:44.700> in<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.000> family<00:01:45.180> and<00:01:45.420> maybe<00:01:46.110> half<00:01:46.409> the

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
runs in the family and maybe half the

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.100 
runs in the family and maybe half the
cases<00:01:46.979> or<00:01:47.130> more<00:01:47.340> you'll<00:01:47.579> see<00:01:47.820> that<00:01:48.110> parents

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
cases or more you'll see that parents

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.630 
cases or more you'll see that parents
have<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:49.530> tremor<00:01:49.860> one<00:01:50.100> parent<00:01:50.399> will<00:01:50.490> have<00:01:50.520> a

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
have a tremor one parent will have a

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.580 
have a tremor one parent will have a
tremor<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.180> then<00:01:51.420> maybe<00:01:52.110> half<00:01:52.380> of<00:01:52.530> the

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
tremor and then maybe half of the

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.380 
tremor and then maybe half of the
children<00:01:53.009> will<00:01:53.159> have<00:01:53.220> a<00:01:53.310> tremor<00:01:53.610> but<00:01:54.090> in<00:01:54.210> some

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
children will have a tremor but in some

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.749 
children will have a tremor but in some
cases<00:01:54.600> that's<00:01:54.960> not<00:01:55.079> actually<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:56.009> case<00:01:56.159> so<00:01:56.490> it

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
cases that's not actually the case so it

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.149 
cases that's not actually the case so it
we're<00:01:57.329> not<00:01:57.450> really<00:01:57.659> sure<00:01:57.750> but<00:01:58.649> there<00:01:58.799> is<00:01:58.890> some

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
we're not really sure but there is some

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.209 
we're not really sure but there is some
type<00:01:59.399> of<00:01:59.570> genetic<00:02:00.570> link<00:02:00.810> it<00:02:00.960> seems<00:02:01.200> so<00:02:01.920> how<00:02:02.159> do

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
type of genetic link it seems so how do

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.560 
type of genetic link it seems so how do
you<00:02:02.369> know<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.579> difference<00:02:02.939> between<00:02:03.060> an

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
you know the difference between an

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.539 
you know the difference between an
essential<00:02:04.110> tremor<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:04.649> maybe<00:02:04.890> an<00:02:05.040> early<00:02:05.189> sign

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
essential tremor and maybe an early sign

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.300 
essential tremor and maybe an early sign
of<00:02:05.610> Parkinson's<00:02:06.420> disease

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
of Parkinson's disease

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.919 
of Parkinson's disease
that's<00:02:08.310> a<00:02:08.429> great<00:02:08.610> question<00:02:08.789> well<00:02:09.149> in<00:02:09.509> in

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
that's a great question well in in

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.660 
that's a great question well in in
Parkinson's<00:02:10.560> disease<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:10.920> tremor<00:02:11.280> doesn't

Parkinson's disease the tremor doesn't

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.480 
Parkinson's disease the tremor doesn't
always<00:02:11.790> appear<00:02:12.540> when<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:12.810> hands<00:02:13.170> are

the<00:02:20.240> tremor<00:02:20.450> is<00:02:20.540> usually<00:02:20.990> much<00:02:21.110> worse<00:02:21.470> when

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
the tremor is usually much worse when

the tremor is usually much worse when
someone's<00:02:22.670> using<00:02:22.880> the<00:02:23.150> hands<00:02:23.600> or<00:02:24.020> even<00:02:24.290> in<00:02:24.620> the

the phone and call your doc well I would

the phone and call your doc well I would
