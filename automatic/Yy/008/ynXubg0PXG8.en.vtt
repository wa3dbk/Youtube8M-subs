00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
actually does to the practice and for

00:00:52.440 --> 00:01:04.530 
actually does to the practice and for
this<00:00:52.559> i<00:00:52.770> cannot<00:00:53.129> use<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.789> current<00:00:54.780> ah

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.390 

we<00:01:05.540> have<00:01:05.780> to<00:01:05.960> go<00:01:06.110> with<00:01:06.350> a<00:01:06.380> fist<00:01:06.770> of<00:01:06.920> thunder<00:01:07.190> and

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
we have to go with a fist of thunder and

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.090 
we have to go with a fist of thunder and
we'll<00:01:08.270> go<00:01:08.480> with<00:01:08.750> that<00:01:09.080> one<00:01:09.620> because<00:01:09.890> it

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
we'll go with that one because it

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.050 
we'll go with that one because it
doesn't<00:01:10.370> do<00:01:10.430> any<00:01:10.580> extra<00:01:12.550> okay<00:01:13.550> let's<00:01:13.790> see<00:01:13.940> how

much the set bonus actually does it's

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.930 
much the set bonus actually does it's
hard<00:01:24.530> to<00:01:24.650> see<00:01:24.770> anything<00:01:25.070> right<00:01:25.340> now<00:01:27.640> well<00:01:28.640> it

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:28.940 
hard to see anything right now well it

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:41.300 
register that's kind of well I'm not so

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:52.200 
register that's kind of well I'm not so
fun<00:01:44.410> okay<00:01:45.410> let's<00:01:45.650> kill<00:01:45.860> these<00:01:49.780> see<00:01:50.780> if<00:01:50.900> we<00:01:51.020> can

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
fun okay let's kill these see if we can

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.520 
fun okay let's kill these see if we can
anyways<00:01:53.210> see<00:01:53.420> how<00:01:53.540> much<00:01:53.690> it<00:01:53.840> does<00:01:54.020> let's<00:01:54.380> see

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
anyways see how much it does let's see

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.380 
anyways see how much it does let's see
if<00:01:54.590> we<00:01:54.680> can<00:01:54.800> find<00:01:54.979> a<00:01:55.160> pack<00:01:55.400> of<00:01:55.580> small<00:01:55.880> mobs<00:01:56.119> and

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
if we can find a pack of small mobs and

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.890 
if we can find a pack of small mobs and
perhaps<00:01:57.200> we<00:01:57.530> were<00:01:57.650> able<00:01:57.800> to<00:01:58.100> see<00:01:58.690> what<00:01:59.690> it<00:01:59.780> hits

00:01:59.890 --> 00:01:59.900 
perhaps we were able to see what it hits

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:12.040 
perhaps we were able to see what it hits
for<00:02:07.570> okay<00:02:08.570> these<00:02:08.750> guys<00:02:08.810> has<00:02:09.289> what<00:02:10.070> about<00:02:11.050> 2

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
for okay these guys has what about 2

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.210 
for okay these guys has what about 2
million<00:02:12.260> life<00:02:12.560> and<00:02:14.050> I've<00:02:15.050> hit<00:02:15.320> some<00:02:15.980> of<00:02:16.010> them

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
million life and I've hit some of them

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.860 
million life and I've hit some of them
only<00:02:16.430> once<00:02:16.730> and<00:02:17.170> we<00:02:18.170> have<00:02:19.420> from<00:02:20.420> four<00:02:20.660> million

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
only once and we have from four million

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.260 
only once and we have from four million
to<00:02:21.170> two<00:02:21.319> million<00:02:21.530> so<00:02:21.950> it's<00:02:22.130> approximately<00:02:22.270> two

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
to two million so it's approximately two

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:28.150 
to two million so it's approximately two
million<00:02:24.069> and<00:02:25.569> it<00:02:26.569> can<00:02:26.900> apparently<00:02:27.350> not<00:02:27.800> crit

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
million and it can apparently not crit

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.210 
million and it can apparently not crit
I'm<00:02:29.140> running<00:02:30.140> a<00:02:30.200> little<00:02:30.350> bit<00:02:30.470> lower<00:02:30.710> now<00:02:30.830> of

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
I'm running a little bit lower now of

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:32.590 
I'm running a little bit lower now of
course<00:02:31.400> i'm<00:02:31.640> only<00:02:31.790> running<00:02:32.000> forty-seven

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
course i'm only running forty-seven

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:38.160 
course i'm only running forty-seven
percent<00:02:35.200> but<00:02:36.200> that<00:02:36.620> it<00:02:36.740> doesn't<00:02:36.980> even<00:02:37.040> show<00:02:37.190> as

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
percent but that it doesn't even show as

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.870 
percent but that it doesn't even show as
kind<00:02:39.170> of<00:02:39.230> sad<00:02:39.470> it's<00:02:39.980> hard<00:02:40.220> to<00:02:40.340> really<00:02:40.490> test<00:02:40.760> out

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
kind of sad it's hard to really test out

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.120 
kind of sad it's hard to really test out
what<00:02:41.090> it<00:02:41.210> actually<00:02:41.360> does<00:02:41.650> but<00:02:42.650> for<00:02:42.890> a<00:02:42.920> six

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
what it actually does but for a six

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.490 
what it actually does but for a six
piece<00:02:43.310> bonus<00:02:43.580> i<00:02:43.940> think<00:02:44.510> this<00:02:44.660> is<00:02:44.720> kind<00:02:45.380> of<00:02:45.500> weak

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
piece bonus i think this is kind of weak

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.780 
piece bonus i think this is kind of weak
especially<00:02:48.500> if<00:02:48.830> you<00:02:48.920> compare<00:02:49.250> it<00:02:49.280> to<00:02:49.520> let's

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
especially if you compare it to let's

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.250 
especially if you compare it to let's
say<00:02:49.910> modal<00:02:50.270> kings<00:02:50.510> where<00:02:50.750> they<00:02:50.870> get<00:02:50.990> three

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
say modal kings where they get three

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:52.750 
say modal kings where they get three
guardians<00:02:51.650> fighting<00:02:51.980> for<00:02:52.160> them<00:02:52.310> all<00:02:52.459> the<00:02:52.580> time

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
guardians fighting for them all the time

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.400 
guardians fighting for them all the time
until<00:02:53.060> the<00:02:53.330> die<00:02:55.060> the<00:02:56.060> zune<00:02:56.270> is<00:02:56.420> it<00:02:56.630> or<00:02:56.810> yeah<00:02:57.260> the

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
until the die the zune is it or yeah the

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.290 
until the die the zune is it or yeah the
