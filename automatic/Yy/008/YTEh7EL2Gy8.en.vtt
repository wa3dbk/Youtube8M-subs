00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.830
 you too 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:10.370
 I hate having to put it in but I'm glad to see you things have changed a lot since 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.299
 that this witness disappeared from the facts 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:18.099
 well maybe not so much that we disappeared persecuted and it will be that mutation in sea 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:20.829
 open but just copied garage 

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:24.979
 We believe that we have been transported in time keeping in mind that you do not see 

00:00:24.979 --> 00:00:29.119
 aged since the last time I saw them I would say that it is impossible to 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:33.480
 energy in states and day 8 after bed but in the 

00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:36.479
 Roman calendar we are at 2022 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.010
 luck 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.090
 a task that must be on Saturday in the Aztec is reality 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.230
 decreases 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.090
 well we still have some technical failures 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:54.270
 green 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.270
 where is it cooked 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.430
 one 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.140
 musimundo that is a good tribute died like a hero thanks to him millions of 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.820
 people were able to escape during 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.820
 the second siege but not even the point with our cameras 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.300
 and I had 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.590
 the last time I heard about her she was going with her husband to new 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.900
 zelanda the street and minus three more if you could overcome that 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.729
 this is the signal unfortunately these days our work is defensive 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:39.030
 there should be precisely genetically create mutations 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.960
 we do not try to adopt circulatory systems is with acid base 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.150
 impenetrable sulfuric exoskeletons 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.150
 the powers once 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.650
 we started working when Latinos made clear most of the planet 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.110
 animal sent these images before it disappeared in action but its 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.000
 legacy remains 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.290
 loves 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.240
 either that said 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.259
 in this previous stage but if you can not face past or early morning in irun 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:09.639
 agreement 

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:11.889
 montezuma we are left 

00:02:11.889 --> 00:02:17.310
 a few hundred in new york a few hundred in the other states a hidden 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.169
 others fight everyone can search 

00:02:20.169 --> 00:02:24.539
 Jaenada about algae moved page positions 

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:28.429
 that is to say marine world exhibitions it is nice to have the 

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:29.239
 writes 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:31.459
 echegaray league 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:34.459
 I do not speak like that 

00:03:04.169 --> 00:03:06.389
 radial first five 

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:09.389
 just when it seemed that it was beginning to temperley 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:18.969
 I wanted to do 

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:21.969
 the image of mr 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:30.819
 the results careful 

00:03:48.249 --> 00:03:50.249
 all the gold returns to the dr 

00:03:50.249 --> 00:03:53.629
 I am impressed crime unfortunately I have many thanks 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:09.499
 a very tough 160 situation in this direction this is going to be crazy 

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:12.499
 what's new 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:17.019
 May 6 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:19.739
 nothing industrial is changed 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:21.129
 he is okay 

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:24.849
 I'm not bad we've all lost something in this race only my loss 

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:27.849
 somewhat more sober result 

00:04:37.749 --> 00:04:41.489
 they have to have some weak point yet we have not found the suits 

00:04:41.489 --> 00:04:44.770
 more are genetically engineered to be perfect killing machines 

00:04:44.769 --> 00:04:48.809
 designed sports by Dr. Jonathan Min 5 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.139
 I do not know him 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:54.620
 if that and if he built them we will finish them 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:59.690
 We insisted he saw for when we saw his whereabouts it was already late and he would see all 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:03.400
 mutations on the island of monsters but it did not work 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.780
 the programs adapt too fast the time is not of our 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.490
 part but it could be 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.949
 this explains that time could get us out of here 

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:14.389
 if it could be transported more in time we could fix things 

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:17.389
 and we would finish those in the areas before they started 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:28.919
 our battle is our party in the past 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:31.919
 no doubt country and we want to save our country 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:55.580
 the state seized 

00:05:57.949 --> 00:06:01.860
 of these teachers I think it will be more useful in the past than it is in the 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:02.539
 I presented 

00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:05.539
 make sure you do not shoot with it by agora 

00:06:07.339 --> 00:06:10.339
 good luck god 

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:17.479
 why do not you come home with us 

00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:19.809
 now I belong here 

00:06:19.809 --> 00:06:22.400
 we'll see each other in the barracks 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.680
 in tepito 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.680
 I had been waiting for 23 years 

00:06:40.659 --> 00:06:43.129
 I never thought that I was going from Zacatepec that bad weather
