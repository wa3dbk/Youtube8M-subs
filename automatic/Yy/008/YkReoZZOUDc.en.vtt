00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:19.540 
particular menu I think that you have a
really<00:02:17.840> good<00:02:18.080> chance<00:02:18.140> just<00:02:18.650> as<00:02:19.190> you<00:02:19.340> did<00:02:19.490> last

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
really good chance just as you did last

a<00:02:33.290> mackerel<00:02:33.620> family<00:02:33.890> fishing<00:02:34.069> so<00:02:34.550> it's<00:02:34.670> me<00:02:34.790> a

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
a mackerel family fishing so it's me a

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:36.610 
a mackerel family fishing so it's me a
little<00:02:34.940> fattier<00:02:35.300> okay<00:02:35.690> yeah<00:02:35.870> this<00:02:36.440> is<00:02:36.590> a

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
little fattier okay yeah this is a

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.730 
little fattier okay yeah this is a
little<00:02:36.890> bit<00:02:36.980> leaner<00:02:37.130> than<00:02:37.190> that<00:02:37.459> but<00:02:38.709> well<00:02:39.709> I

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:39.740
