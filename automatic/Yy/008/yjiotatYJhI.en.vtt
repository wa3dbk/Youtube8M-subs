00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 hi guys come back to do a review 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.799
 opening this box is the new collection 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:11.190
 of the kardashian will be called chrome and the 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.259
 I bought in ulta I think this new one that 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.500
 the page of chroma beauty not even 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:19.619
 is active I bought this set that contains 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:24.000
 a palette a eyeliner brush and 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:27.449
 false eyelashes and this cost 14 99 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.269
 I also bought two palettes of 8 shades 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:35.250
 and 3 flushes I think are two rumors and 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:36.750
 an illuminator and this cost 1299 let me 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.910
 see what we have here 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.300
 this is the shadow duo with tabs 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:45.560
 false and is called laser kleenex room 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:49.820
 and this costs 999 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:53.600
 and from there I have this is the natural nor a 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:55.820
 set for lips costs 14 99 I'll 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.820
 start with the kit first by looking at the kit 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:01.370
 in person reminds me of cosmetics the 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:04.790
 why plastic packaging and 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:07.970
 sponge brush tip and not very 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.970
 useful to be honest and then we'll see 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.210
 how is it I do not know 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:16.260
 here is the sponge tip comes with 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.260
 a black eyeliner 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:23.380
 and I'll leave you in a few minutes and we'll see 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.510
 when I ran my fingers and it runs so 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.870
 the eyelashes come with an adhesive 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:30.940
 also the eyelashes do not look bad I think 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:33.480
 that the ornament is a bit thick, let's see 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.480
 the palette 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:41.200
 I think the colors are beautiful you see 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:44.229
 like a wet shadow but this without 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.720
 moisten or mix glycerin water I think 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.759
 that the four colors of 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.189
 the corner show beautiful I think that 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:53.289
 they apply very well but the two colors 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:56.079
 that are in light colors are 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:57.930
 you see a little Paul winds and you do not 

00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:00.360
 they show well 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.580
 but I personally love these 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.570
 colors these are something that I would use to 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:09.590
 I already had the eyeliner for a while 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.590
 so let's see 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:16.310
 it's not against stains I think you can 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.370
 use more when you make an eye smoke and 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.379
 now let's see these mini palettes that are 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.200
 very nice because I think it would be great 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:28.599
 in your bag 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:32.490
 when you come out and a4 shiny and four 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:35.610
 mates did not expect that 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:40.320
 and then it has a bit of there are places 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:43.170
 here as I take them out there are two blushes 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:46.260
 and an illuminator 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.660
 here are the samples the shadows 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.270
 you can see them these two colors are very 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.940
 similar and these samples are 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:56.520
 understand so I'm going to pass my fingers 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.760
 to see if he runs if they stay in his 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.760
 place 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:06.060
 you can see that matesi colors and 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.380
 Metals moved all over the place 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:12.990
 continue with the palette of khloÃ© 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:15.400
 kardashian again 4 matt and 4 metallic 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:17.830
 I personally love these colors 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.170
 here are the samples of the palette of 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:23.140
 chlorine and I'm very disappointed because 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:26.140
 You can barely see the samples here 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:30.130
 I think the only color that is visible 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:33.070
 is this and then the metallic ones you can see 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:35.380
 the first two colors here but the 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:37.320
 I applied I was very dusty and 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:41.560
 also the blushes that are like that 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:43.690
 as it is again the last color of the 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.210
 right it looks pretty pink but it 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.550
 it applies very soft actually the only 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:52.060
 two colors that have pigmentation are 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:54.820
 these two colors here so no 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:57.760
 I feel I do not feel it's worth the 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:04:01.630
 buy let's open the tabs these 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.840
 are the eyelash and shadow duo and the 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.810
 packaging is 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.430
 very low budget you're supposed to 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.010
 to keep it in this package 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.410
 plastic and does not even bring a lid 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.300
 for the shadow it's funny that the 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:16.880
 glue brings the figures of the three 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:20.359
 Sisters and lashes look like 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:22.130
 any other tab you know the quality 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:25.850
 of this shadow feels very soft 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:27.680
 compared to the shadows of the palette 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:31.400
 and here are the samples of the two 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:33.380
 colors and if very close to the color ok the 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.890
 last product that I'm going to talk about is 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:38.480
 the natural nude lipset and I'm very 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:41.030
 excited about this because the 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:43.550
 kardashian are known for their lips 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.530
 juicy color nude so I'm very 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:49.520
 interested in knowing if this is something that 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:51.620
 Kim would use this set costs 14 99 and he looks 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.270
 who invested a lot of time and effort 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:57.110
 in this set because this feels 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:59.360
 even expensive it feels like that the 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:03.050
 glass containers 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:06.180
 This is double- ended one with the lipstick 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:08.789
 and the other with the eyeliner 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:13.850
 I'm going to try it on my lips right now 

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:13.850
 is the eyeliner looks very clear 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:22.900
 wow broke 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:27.820
 it's very no I do not know if I like that 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:30.750
 the lipstick smells like it does not smell 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:30.750
 be sweet 

00:05:31.249 --> 00:05:38.539
 It is the same color as the eyeliner or 

00:05:35.149 --> 00:05:42.709
 my god is so clear I was not 

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:46.069
 kidding when they called this a knot and 

00:05:42.709 --> 00:05:49.119
 let's put the gloss on it's a 

00:05:46.069 --> 00:05:49.119
 normal brush 

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:57.500
 it smells different 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:06:00.980
 I can not explain the aroma 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:04.360
 I do not know it smells funny if you remind me who 

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:09.980
 kardashian with pink peach color 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:13.550
 however, it's not me, I need some 

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:17.000
 kind of dark eyeliner but that's a 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:19.340
 very king keith plane nothing wrong just do not 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.600
 like the aroma of the gloss of all my 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:26.120
 favorite product I think it's the palette 

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:28.510
 I 'm not impressed when you think of 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:32.090
 the charges jones think of clamorous 

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:34.970
 amazing makeup beautiful but in 

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:39.080
 serious I do not think that they would use their 

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:42.020
 own makeup that in real life does not 

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:45.680
 I think I buy more chroma products because 

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:48.380
 the quality is not good this is my 

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:50.930
 personal opinion some people are going to 

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:53.810
 say or think that these are the best 

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:57.169
 products but they definitely are not 

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:59.360
 my favorites this was my review 

00:06:57.169 --> 00:07:01.849
 hope this is helpful to 

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:04.339
