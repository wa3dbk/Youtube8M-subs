Vermont<00:02:14.350> and<00:02:14.530> circus<00:02:14.860> it's<00:02:15.040> it's<00:02:15.430> a<00:02:15.520> great

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
Vermont and circus it's it's a great

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.370 
Vermont and circus it's it's a great
match<00:02:15.940> we<00:02:16.570> grew<00:02:16.870> up<00:02:16.930> without<00:02:17.110> a<00:02:17.260> television

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
match we grew up without a television

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.280 
match we grew up without a television
and<00:02:18.250> so<00:02:19.090> we<00:02:19.210> didn't<00:02:19.420> have<00:02:19.480> that<00:02:19.600> popular

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
and so we didn't have that popular

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.110 
and so we didn't have that popular
culture<00:02:20.770> and<00:02:20.980> having<00:02:21.340> never<00:02:21.459> seen<00:02:21.580> a<00:02:21.850> circus

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
culture and having never seen a circus

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.390 
culture and having never seen a circus
we<00:02:22.780> didn't<00:02:23.470> even<00:02:23.590> know<00:02:23.830> what<00:02:24.040> we<00:02:24.160> were<00:02:24.280> getting

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
we didn't even know what we were getting

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.120 
we didn't even know what we were getting
into<00:02:24.760> I'm<00:02:25.270> aware<00:02:25.540> of<00:02:25.600> farm<00:02:25.930> kids<00:02:26.200> growing<00:02:27.070> up

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
into I'm aware of farm kids growing up

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.340 
into I'm aware of farm kids growing up
in<00:02:27.280> western<00:02:27.760> Massachusetts<00:02:28.390> no<00:02:28.750> gymnastics

background<00:02:29.500> no<00:02:29.890> dance<00:02:30.100> background<00:02:30.580> we<00:02:30.850> were

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
background no dance background we were

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.060 
background no dance background we were
nerds<00:02:31.270> I<00:02:31.720> guess<00:02:32.020> in<00:02:32.200> high<00:02:32.410> school<00:02:32.680> definitely

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
nerds I guess in high school definitely

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.640 
nerds I guess in high school definitely
it<00:02:33.490> was<00:02:33.550> easier<00:02:33.970> with<00:02:34.330> my<00:02:34.510> identical<00:02:34.930> twin<00:02:35.110> to

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
it was easier with my identical twin to

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.290 
it was easier with my identical twin to
get<00:02:35.860> that<00:02:36.010> trust<00:02:36.310> and<00:02:36.580> stuff<00:02:36.760> like<00:02:36.880> that

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
get that trust and stuff like that

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.020 
get that trust and stuff like that
I<00:02:37.330> think<00:02:37.810> twins<00:02:38.290> sort<00:02:38.709> of<00:02:38.830> have<00:02:39.820> an<00:02:39.940> advantage

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
I think twins sort of have an advantage

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.699 
I think twins sort of have an advantage
when<00:02:40.540> they're<00:02:40.630> working<00:02:40.780> together<00:02:41.050> because<00:02:41.440> we

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
when they're working together because we

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:43.740 
when they're working together because we
move<00:02:42.040> similarly<00:02:42.760> well<00:02:43.030> when<00:02:43.180> I<00:02:43.209> get<00:02:43.420> up<00:02:43.510> on<00:02:43.630> the

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
move similarly well when I get up on the

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.960 
move similarly well when I get up on the
trapeze<00:02:43.930> with<00:02:44.290> my<00:02:44.440> sister

trapeze with my sister

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.860

that's our forte and our act that really

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.910 
that's our forte and our act that really
