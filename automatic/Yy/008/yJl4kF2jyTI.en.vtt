00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:55.019 
what modern intimacy has often wanted us
to<00:05:53.469> believe<00:05:53.650> it's<00:05:54.159> that<00:05:54.430> it's<00:05:54.580> one<00:05:54.789> and<00:05:54.940> the

00:05:55.019 --> 00:05:55.029 
to believe it's that it's one and the

00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:55.589 
to believe it's that it's one and the
same

00:05:55.589 --> 00:05:55.599 
same

00:05:55.599 --> 00:05:57.480 
same
all<00:05:55.810> right<00:05:56.020> so<00:05:56.199> how<00:05:56.319> does<00:05:56.379> a<00:05:56.500> couple<00:05:56.919> kickstart

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:57.490 
all right so how does a couple kickstart

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.300 
all right so how does a couple kickstart
their<00:05:57.699> sex<00:05:58.000> lives<00:05:58.240> if<00:05:58.659> they've<00:05:59.080> fallen<00:05:59.979> into

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:00.310 
their sex lives if they've fallen into

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:03.029 
their sex lives if they've fallen into
the<00:06:00.639> dull<00:06:01.089> routine<00:06:01.360> or<00:06:01.960> indeed<00:06:02.529> as<00:06:02.800> many

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:03.039 
the dull routine or indeed as many

00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:05.869 
the dull routine or indeed as many
people<00:06:03.370> are<00:06:03.550> involved<00:06:04.120> in<00:06:04.210> sexless<00:06:04.750> marriage

00:06:05.869 --> 00:06:05.879 
people are involved in sexless marriage

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:09.029 
people are involved in sexless marriage
you<00:06:06.879> know<00:06:07.000> I<00:06:07.240> think<00:06:07.629> that<00:06:07.810> the<00:06:08.110> couples<00:06:08.919> who

00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:09.039 
you know I think that the couples who

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:11.579 
you know I think that the couples who
have<00:06:09.250> a<00:06:09.279> spark<00:06:09.819> are<00:06:10.089> couples<00:06:10.689> who<00:06:10.870> are<00:06:10.900> willful

00:06:11.579 --> 00:06:11.589 
have a spark are couples who are willful

00:06:11.589 --> 00:06:13.890 
have a spark are couples who are willful
and<00:06:11.770> intentional<00:06:11.949> about<00:06:12.729> it<00:06:13.000> there<00:06:13.870> are

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:13.900 
and intentional about it there are

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:16.320 
and intentional about it there are
couples<00:06:14.439> that<00:06:14.680> have<00:06:14.919> since<00:06:15.339> long<00:06:15.669> abandoned

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:16.330 
couples that have since long abandoned

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.540 
couples that have since long abandoned
the<00:06:16.419> big<00:06:16.629> bang<00:06:16.900> theory<00:06:17.229> of<00:06:17.469> spontaneous<00:06:17.800> sex

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:18.550 
the big bang theory of spontaneous sex

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:21.059 
the big bang theory of spontaneous sex
because<00:06:19.479> whatever<00:06:19.870> is<00:06:20.080> going<00:06:20.289> to<00:06:20.469> just<00:06:20.800> happen

00:06:21.059 --> 00:06:21.069 
because whatever is going to just happen

00:06:21.069 --> 00:06:23.459 
because whatever is going to just happen
in<00:06:21.430> a<00:06:21.550> long-term<00:06:21.789> relationship<00:06:22.169> already<00:06:23.169> long
