crosswind cast through timecard and I
briefly<00:00:18.310> mentioned<00:00:18.520> a<00:00:19.150> card<00:00:19.449> called<00:00:19.720> the

briefly mentioned a card called the
panopticon

panopticon

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.990 
panopticon
with<00:00:22.180> a<00:00:22.450> possible<00:00:23.110> combo<00:00:23.500> of<00:00:23.759> well<00:00:24.759> basically

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:25.000 
with a possible combo of well basically

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.470 
with a possible combo of well basically
coming<00:00:25.930> up<00:00:26.289> with<00:00:26.500> a<00:00:26.860> time<00:00:27.099> warp<00:00:27.340> and<00:00:28.180> it<00:00:28.300> gives

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:28.480 
coming up with a time warp and it gives

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.210 
coming up with a time warp and it gives
you<00:00:28.570> infinite<00:00:28.869> turns<00:00:29.230> I<00:00:29.650> just<00:00:29.949> wanted<00:00:30.130> to

what<00:00:43.210> it<00:00:43.329> basically<00:00:43.420> does<00:00:43.719> is<00:00:44.489> every<00:00:45.489> turn

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
what it basically does is every turn

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.829 
what it basically does is every turn
panopticon<00:00:47.050> gives<00:00:47.620> me<00:00:47.710> the<00:00:47.829> option<00:00:48.129> of<00:00:48.219> using

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:48.839 
panopticon gives me the option of using

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:53.220 
panopticon gives me the option of using
time<00:00:49.839> warp<00:00:50.079> so<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:52.390> every<00:00:52.629> time<00:00:52.749> I<00:00:52.780> use<00:00:52.989> time

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:53.230 
time warp so and every time I use time

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.229 
time warp so and every time I use time
warp<00:00:53.699> my<00:00:54.699> wand

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:55.239 
warp my wand

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:59.639 
warp my wand
does<00:00:55.629> damage<00:00:57.210> so<00:00:58.210> when<00:00:58.749> my<00:00:58.870> one<00:00:59.019> does<00:00:59.289> damage

00:00:59.639 --> 00:00:59.649 
does damage so when my one does damage

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:03.180 
does damage so when my one does damage
because<00:01:00.309> of<00:01:00.339> tyrunt<00:01:01.679> sorry<00:01:02.679> because<00:01:02.890> of<00:01:02.949> time

because of tyrunt sorry because of time

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.480 
because of tyrunt sorry because of time
warp<00:01:03.399> untile<00:01:03.760> run<00:01:03.969> they<00:01:04.120> get<00:01:04.269> another<00:01:04.510> drake

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:05.490 
warp untile run they get another drake

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:07.710 
warp untile run they get another drake
it<00:01:06.490> doesn't<00:01:06.790> matter<00:01:06.909> what<00:01:07.090> I<00:01:07.120> do<00:01:07.210> the<00:01:07.540> guy's

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
never gonna see another turn so it's

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.880 
never gonna see another turn so it's
pretty<00:01:10.210> amazing<00:01:10.479> I<00:01:10.810> can<00:01:11.229> even<00:01:11.380> play<00:01:11.500> cards<00:01:11.800> on

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
pretty amazing I can even play cards on

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:20.580 
pretty amazing I can even play cards on
top<00:01:12.070> of<00:01:12.130> my<00:01:12.220> deck

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.150 

here<00:01:21.590> we<00:01:21.650> go<00:01:21.770> again

this online I guarantee people would

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.540 
this online I guarantee people would
just<00:01:26.450> quit<00:01:27.070> and<00:01:28.070> I<00:01:28.130> think<00:01:28.340> they're<00:01:28.430> gonna

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:28.550 
just quit and I think they're gonna

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:29.800 
just quit and I think they're gonna
stand<00:01:28.850> by<00:01:29.030> and<00:01:29.060> watch<00:01:29.240> you<00:01:29.300> playing<00:01:29.600> around

stand by and watch you playing around
with<00:01:29.960> this<00:01:32.470> is<00:01:33.470> it<00:01:33.650> broken

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
with this is it broken

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.320 
with this is it broken
I<00:01:34.190> don't<00:01:34.460> know<00:01:34.610> because<00:01:34.790> it's<00:01:34.940> quite<00:01:35.090> hard<00:01:35.120> to

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 
I don't know because it's quite hard to

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.560 
I don't know because it's quite hard to
set<00:01:35.600> up<00:01:36.640> you<00:01:37.640> know<00:01:37.760> it<00:01:37.880> doesn't<00:01:38.030> happen<00:01:38.240> every

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
set up you know it doesn't happen every

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.830 
set up you know it doesn't happen every
game<00:01:38.750> to<00:01:38.960> be<00:01:39.050> fair<00:01:39.290> so<00:01:40.300> to<00:01:41.300> say<00:01:41.480> whether<00:01:41.630> it's

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
game to be fair so to say whether it's

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.960 
game to be fair so to say whether it's
broken<00:01:42.050> or<00:01:42.230> not<00:01:42.260> I<00:01:42.380> don't<00:01:42.500> know<00:01:44.920> and<00:01:45.920> I<00:01:46.910> don't

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
broken or not I don't know and I don't

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.200 
broken or not I don't know and I don't
know<00:01:47.300> if<00:01:47.390> there's<00:01:47.570> a<00:01:47.630> way<00:01:47.750> around<00:01:47.780> it<00:01:48.140> either

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
know if there's a way around it either

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:54.900 
know if there's a way around it either
maybe<00:01:50.210> if<00:01:50.390> the<00:01:50.540> opponent<00:01:51.080> had<00:01:51.979> mana<00:01:52.250> up<00:01:52.550> and

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:54.910 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:58.420 

perhaps<00:01:55.910> if<00:01:56.210> they<00:01:56.330> could<00:01:56.510> counter<00:01:57.220> your<00:01:58.220> time

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
perhaps if they could counter your time

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:59.410 
perhaps if they could counter your time
warp<00:01:58.670> I<00:01:58.790> don't<00:01:58.970> know<00:01:59.090> if<00:01:59.180> that's<00:01:59.330> a

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
warp I don't know if that's a

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.760 
warp I don't know if that's a
possibility<00:01:59.780> maybe<00:02:00.170> you<00:02:00.260> guys<00:02:00.380> could<00:02:00.560> let<00:02:00.680> me

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
possibility maybe you guys could let me

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
attention that you could keep doubling

attention that you could keep doubling
the<00:02:22.880> Hydra<00:02:23.239> over<00:02:23.540> in<00:02:23.720> infinitely<00:02:24.410> or

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
the Hydra over in infinitely or

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.740 
the Hydra over in infinitely or
something<00:02:24.800> like<00:02:24.860> that<00:02:25.070> so<00:02:25.340> I<00:02:25.580> guess<00:02:26.480> it's<00:02:26.630> kind

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
something like that so I guess it's kind

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.090 
something like that so I guess it's kind
of<00:02:26.900> pointless<00:02:27.110> to<00:02:27.230> worry<00:02:27.560> about<00:02:27.709> the<00:02:27.890> biggest

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
of pointless to worry about the biggest

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.259 
of pointless to worry about the biggest
hit<00:02:28.280> when<00:02:28.400> you<00:02:28.459> can<00:02:28.580> just<00:02:28.730> have<00:02:28.820> an<00:02:28.910> infinite

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269 
hit when you can just have an infinite

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:35.949 
hit when you can just have an infinite
card<00:02:33.850> this<00:02:34.850> is<00:02:34.910> getting<00:02:35.239> pretty<00:02:35.360> big<00:02:35.630> now<00:02:35.660> this

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
card this is getting pretty big now this

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:39.540 
card this is getting pretty big now this
damage<00:02:36.290> for<00:02:37.660> increases<00:02:38.660> by<00:02:38.780> one<00:02:39.019> every<00:02:39.230> time

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
damage for increases by one every time

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.710 
damage for increases by one every time
so

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:03:00.309 

I<00:02:46.670> love<00:02:47.670> the<00:02:47.790> stack<00:02:48.000> it's<00:02:48.180> done<00:02:48.390> my<00:02:48.510> favorite

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:02.259 

so<00:03:00.950> yeah<00:03:01.069> this<00:03:01.219> is<00:03:01.280> probably<00:03:01.519> the<00:03:01.790> best<00:03:01.909> combo

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
so yeah this is probably the best combo

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:04.119 
so yeah this is probably the best combo
in<00:03:02.360> the<00:03:02.390> game<00:03:02.599> in<00:03:02.719> my<00:03:02.840> opinion<00:03:03.140> an<00:03:03.829> optic

00:03:04.119 --> 00:03:04.129 
in the game in my opinion an optic

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:07.479 
in the game in my opinion an optic
mirror<00:03:04.370> with<00:03:05.120> time<00:03:05.659> warp<00:03:05.930> tile<00:03:06.439> around<00:03:06.560> under

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
mirror with time warp tile around under

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:11.259 
mirror with time warp tile around under
one<00:03:08.060> and<00:03:08.390> uh<00:03:09.549> what's<00:03:10.549> that<00:03:10.730> called<00:03:10.909> future

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:11.269 
one and uh what's that called future

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:16.509 
one and uh what's that called future
site<00:03:12.939> so<00:03:14.469> yeah<00:03:15.469> guys<00:03:15.620> that's<00:03:15.980> pretty<00:03:16.099> much<00:03:16.340> it

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 
site so yeah guys that's pretty much it

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:19.449 
site so yeah guys that's pretty much it
I<00:03:16.849> guess<00:03:17.689> I<00:03:17.840> can<00:03:18.019> uh<00:03:18.049> I<00:03:18.439> can<00:03:18.920> leave<00:03:19.189> it<00:03:19.310> there

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
I guess I can uh I can leave it there

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:20.710 
I guess I can uh I can leave it there
and<00:03:19.609> hopefully<00:03:19.970> I'll<00:03:20.209> see<00:03:20.299> you<00:03:20.390> in<00:03:20.480> the<00:03:20.540> next
