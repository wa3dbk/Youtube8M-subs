00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:30.220
 hello youtube friends in this video les 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:33.640
 I'm going to do a review of living 4.1.2 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:35.590
 for the optimal and l5 which is the same 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.840
 room that is in the ram videos and 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:40.449
 droid that I will leave in the description 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.820
 of this video and the link will be in the 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:45.129
 good description let's start with the 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.770
 review the first thing we see for 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:50.620
 unlock the screen is that we can 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:53.790
 unlock anywhere no longer 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:56.640
 as the cyanogenmod this is lost 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:01:00.270
 and well this is the appearance that brings 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.220
 already here I am using nova launcher and 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.340
 Well the first thing we're going to see is that 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:08.190
 the transitions are pretty fluid 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:10.530
 more than extinction which with 3d effect 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:14.670
 already 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:17.610
 good another notable difference to dady 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:21.619
 in sandwich write the camera we have 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.619
 the function is to take pictures with the voice 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:32.130
 without pressing a button or ski 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:35.490
 and take the picture and good otherwise 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:38.970
 I'm going to talk to you is the 3g the 3g is not 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:42.539
 lose, look, I'm going to have there, I have 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:45.810
 three that already and what is happening 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:47.460
 they say they lose it I also thought 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.250
 the same but this must be investigated 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.350
 on the subject and it turns out that you just have to 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.079
 set up in the small by your company 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.619
 and his country and this could not look in 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:01.860
 google how to configure the pn in you say 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:04.580
 your company and your country and you should leave 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.580
 already 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:12.980
 and where the pn is configured let's go to more 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:17.440
 we download mobile networks 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:20.140
 here we go to names of access points 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.270
 and here you will go blank 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:25.300
 I get clear chile because I already 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:27.040
 I set up and has good you know 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.180
 that configure your apn so that you 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.830
 3g appears another notable difference 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.500
 I do not know if it will be the update 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:38.650
 of the game or it will be update 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:41.290
 'living already but bernal but in dead 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.290
 trigger the game is no longer seen 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:47.170
 the referees parentheses nor can you see the hand 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:50.170
 transparent that will be a mistake I had 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.930
 and suddenly some sometimes a 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:58.900
 ship and some zombies because they were almost 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:03:02.739
 invisible and that problem was solved 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:05.950
