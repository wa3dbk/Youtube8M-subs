prompt<00:02:07.469> here<00:02:07.590> and<00:02:07.710> you<00:02:07.770> can<00:02:07.890> see<00:02:08.069> it<00:02:08.250> has<00:02:08.429> every

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
prompt here and you can see it has every

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.050 
prompt here and you can see it has every
rom<00:02:09.239> a<00:02:09.539> through<00:02:10.259> z<00:02:10.289> but<00:02:10.979> of<00:02:11.190> course<00:02:11.220> separate

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
rom a through z but of course separate

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.550 
rom a through z but of course separate
into<00:02:12.330> packages<00:02:12.780> i'm<00:02:12.959> just<00:02:13.110> going<00:02:13.290> to

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
into packages i'm just going to

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.229 
into packages i'm just going to
through<00:02:13.890> jee<00:02:14.099> for<00:02:14.340> demonstration<00:02:14.910> purpose

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
through jee for demonstration purpose

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.120 
through jee for demonstration purpose
but<00:02:15.390> you<00:02:16.020> guys<00:02:16.170> can<00:02:16.410> just<00:02:16.560> choose<00:02:16.800> whichever

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
but you guys can just choose whichever

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.130 
but you guys can just choose whichever
one<00:02:17.400> you<00:02:17.489> want<00:02:17.640> so<00:02:17.940> again<00:02:18.239> top<00:02:18.540> right<00:02:18.780> install

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
one you want so again top right install

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.760 
one you want so again top right install
top<00:02:19.380> right<00:02:19.590> confirm<00:02:19.950> now<00:02:21.140> this<00:02:22.140> is<00:02:22.200> just<00:02:22.349> one

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
top right confirm now this is just one

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.600 
top right confirm now this is just one
way<00:02:22.800> of<00:02:23.250> getting<00:02:23.360> roms<00:02:24.360> on<00:02:24.890> the<00:02:25.890> NES<00:02:26.340> but<00:02:26.580> i

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
way of getting roms on the NES but i

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.050 
way of getting roms on the NES but i
find<00:02:26.880> this<00:02:27.030> the<00:02:27.209> most<00:02:27.330> effective<00:02:27.930> way<00:02:28.140> because

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
find this the most effective way because

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.170 
find this the most effective way because
usually<00:02:30.060> runs<00:02:30.569> from<00:02:30.780> Cydia<00:02:31.170> are<00:02:31.700> less<00:02:32.700> buggy

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
usually runs from Cydia are less buggy

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.850 
usually runs from Cydia are less buggy
for<00:02:33.480> lack<00:02:33.690> of<00:02:33.720> a<00:02:33.900> better<00:02:33.930> word<00:02:34.170> like<00:02:34.709> they

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
for lack of a better word like they

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.770 
for lack of a better word like they
don't<00:02:34.890> crash<00:02:35.310> as<00:02:35.519> much<00:02:35.700> compared<00:02:36.239> to<00:02:36.360> roms<00:02:36.630> you

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
don't crash as much compared to roms you

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.800 
don't crash as much compared to roms you
get<00:02:36.930> on<00:02:37.050> the<00:02:37.170> internet<00:02:37.500> and<00:02:37.849> I<00:02:38.849> with<00:02:39.690> the

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
get on the internet and I with the

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.449 
get on the internet and I with the
insanely<00:02:40.140> I<00:02:40.290> stores<00:02:40.620> we<00:02:40.830> basically<00:02:41.190> have

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
insanely I stores we basically have

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.490 
insanely I stores we basically have
every<00:02:41.819> rom<00:02:42.030> a<00:02:42.269> through<00:02:42.569> z<00:02:42.599> I'm<00:02:43.019> not<00:02:43.230> saying

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
every rom a through z I'm not saying

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.580 
every rom a through z I'm not saying
that<00:02:43.560> has<00:02:43.800> every<00:02:44.220> single<00:02:44.580> run<00:02:44.900> it<00:02:45.900> has<00:02:46.080> almost

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
that has every single run it has almost

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.309 
that has every single run it has almost
all<00:02:46.860> of<00:02:47.280> them<00:02:47.430> a<00:02:47.640> through<00:02:48.269> z<00:02:48.299> if<00:02:48.660> you're

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
all of them a through z if you're

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:51.440 
all of them a through z if you're
looking<00:02:49.590> for<00:02:49.620> a<00:02:49.830> single<00:02:50.250> rom<00:02:50.430> you<00:02:50.940> can<00:02:51.150> get<00:02:51.330> it

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
looking for a single rom you can get it

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.150 
looking for a single rom you can get it
off<00:02:51.540> the<00:02:51.750> internet<00:02:51.780> but<00:02:52.380> um<00:02:52.530> i<00:02:52.769> really<00:02:52.890> don't

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
off the internet but um i really don't

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.970 
off the internet but um i really don't
recommend<00:02:53.549> that<00:02:53.819> just<00:02:54.150> get<00:02:55.049> the<00:02:55.319> package

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
recommend that just get the package

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.610 
recommend that just get the package
where<00:02:56.280> your<00:02:56.489> single<00:02:57.420> run<00:02:57.600> is<00:02:57.810> located<00:02:58.380> it's

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
where your single run is located it's

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.620 
where your single run is located it's
not<00:02:58.799> a<00:02:58.860> big<00:02:59.099> package<00:02:59.370> it<00:03:00.150> doesn't<00:03:00.420> take<00:03:00.599> that

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
not a big package it doesn't take that

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.080 
not a big package it doesn't take that
long<00:03:00.840> a<00:03:01.080> good<00:03:01.470> 30<00:03:01.830> second<00:03:02.280> way<00:03:02.370> and<00:03:02.610> you'll

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
long a good 30 second way and you'll

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.570 
long a good 30 second way and you'll
have<00:03:03.299> your<00:03:04.019> rod<00:03:04.319> and<00:03:04.530> your<00:03:04.620> em<00:03:05.130> later<00:03:05.370> and

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
have your rod and your em later and

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.520 
have your rod and your em later and
you'll<00:03:05.700> be<00:03:05.849> ready<00:03:06.120> to<00:03:06.209> play<00:03:06.390> so<00:03:06.930> this<00:03:07.200> is<00:03:07.319> just

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
you'll be ready to play so this is just

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.039 
you'll be ready to play so this is just
about<00:03:07.769> done<00:03:08.010> and<00:03:08.280> we<00:03:08.730> can<00:03:08.760> continue<00:03:09.390> on<00:03:09.840> with

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
about done and we can continue on with

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:15.620 
about done and we can continue on with
the<00:03:10.170> video<00:03:12.140> okay<00:03:13.140> so<00:03:14.180> once<00:03:15.180> it<00:03:15.390> finishes

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
the video okay so once it finishes

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.560 
the video okay so once it finishes
loading<00:03:16.190> it'll<00:03:17.190> just<00:03:17.220> throw<00:03:18.000> everything<00:03:18.090> down

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
loading it'll just throw everything down

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:22.759 
loading it'll just throw everything down
and<00:03:18.950> it'll<00:03:19.950> say<00:03:20.250> reloading<00:03:20.880> data<00:03:21.560> and<00:03:22.560> i'll

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
and it'll say reloading data and i'll

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.390 
and it'll say reloading data and i'll
say<00:03:22.920> loading<00:03:23.370> data<00:03:23.549> and<00:03:24.320> then<00:03:25.320> it'll<00:03:25.890> tell<00:03:26.220> you

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
say loading data and then it'll tell you

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.960 
say loading data and then it'll tell you
to<00:03:26.700> return<00:03:27.600> to<00:03:27.660> cydia<00:03:28.019> so<00:03:29.010> we<00:03:29.250> are<00:03:29.430> going<00:03:29.790> to

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
to return to cydia so we are going to

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.180 
to return to cydia so we are going to
return<00:03:30.299> to<00:03:30.540> cydia<00:03:30.720> and<00:03:31.079> now<00:03:31.859> we're<00:03:32.040> going<00:03:32.130> to

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
return to cydia and now we're going to

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.240 
return to cydia and now we're going to
go<00:03:32.280> home<00:03:32.730> so<00:03:33.420> that<00:03:33.450> we<00:03:33.810> can<00:03:33.959> see<00:03:34.200> our<00:03:34.470> new

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
go home so that we can see our new

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:40.789 
go home so that we can see our new
emulator<00:03:38.900> okay<00:03:39.900> now<00:03:40.109> that<00:03:40.140> we're<00:03:40.440> home<00:03:40.620> we're

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
emulator okay now that we're home we're

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:42.229 
emulator okay now that we're home we're
going<00:03:40.950> to<00:03:41.069> look<00:03:41.220> for<00:03:41.280> the<00:03:41.549> icon<00:03:41.970> on<00:03:42.180> our

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
going to look for the icon on our

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:45.920 
going to look for the icon on our
springboard<00:03:42.989> and<00:03:43.489> there<00:03:44.489> it<00:03:44.609> is<00:03:44.700> so<00:03:45.389> if<00:03:45.720> you

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
springboard and there it is so if you

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.690 
springboard and there it is so if you
look<00:03:46.049> a<00:03:46.170> little<00:03:46.290> bit<00:03:46.530> something<00:03:46.769> like<00:03:47.430> this

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
look a little bit something like this

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.539 
look a little bit something like this
that<00:03:48.600> is<00:03:48.900> the<00:03:49.410> emulator<00:03:49.829> that<00:03:49.920> we<00:03:50.280> shall<00:03:50.519> be

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
that is the emulator that we shall be

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:54.500 
that is the emulator that we shall be
using<00:03:50.870> to<00:03:51.870> play<00:03:52.109> nes<00:03:52.680> as<00:03:53.160> you<00:03:53.970> can<00:03:54.120> see<00:03:54.239> under

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
using to play nes as you can see under

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.229 
using to play nes as you can see under
it<00:03:54.569> says<00:03:54.720> nes<00:03:55.230> 80-plus<00:03:56.069> so<00:03:56.880> we're<00:03:57.000> going<00:03:57.090> to<00:03:57.180> go

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
it says nes 80-plus so we're going to go

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:59.479
