00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.330 
and that ensured me the first blood
that's<00:02:04.720> a<00:02:04.870> really<00:02:05.170> good<00:02:05.320> combo<00:02:05.770> with<00:02:05.950> twist

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
that's a really good combo with twist

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.960 
that's a really good combo with twist
with<00:02:06.670> an<00:02:06.910> e<00:02:06.940> in<00:02:07.180> the<00:02:07.270> early<00:02:07.600> game

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
with an e in the early game

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.749 
with an e in the early game
that<00:02:08.360> is<00:02:08.780> there's<00:02:09.080> so<00:02:09.320> much<00:02:09.530> damage<00:02:10.040> and<00:02:10.340> here

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
that is there's so much damage and here

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:12.730 
that is there's so much damage and here
I'm<00:02:10.940> demonstrating<00:02:11.120> that<00:02:11.660> again<00:02:12.020> but<00:02:12.260> this

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
I'm demonstrating that again but this

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.790 
I'm demonstrating that again but this
time<00:02:12.800> with<00:02:13.040> ignite<00:02:13.450> you<00:02:14.450> can<00:02:14.570> also<00:02:14.750> ignite<00:02:15.080> and

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
time with ignite you can also ignite and

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.640 
time with ignite you can also ignite and
that<00:02:16.280> will<00:02:16.550> also<00:02:17.300> put<00:02:17.780> lots<00:02:18.200> of<00:02:18.320> damage

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
that will also put lots of damage

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.290 
that will also put lots of damage
towards<00:02:18.980> your<00:02:19.070> opponent<00:02:19.520> and<00:02:19.750> they<00:02:20.750> die<00:02:22.210> so<00:02:23.210> as

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
towards your opponent and they die so as

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.540 
towards your opponent and they die so as
you<00:02:23.480> can<00:02:23.570> see<00:02:23.840> there<00:02:24.080> I<00:02:24.110> did<00:02:24.350> a<00:02:24.380> random<00:02:24.800> w<00:02:25.220> spell

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
you can see there I did a random w spell

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.460 
you can see there I did a random w spell
and<00:02:26.270> what<00:02:26.390> that<00:02:26.540> does<00:02:26.720> is<00:02:26.870> that<00:02:26.900> it<00:02:27.260> as<00:02:27.440> a

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
and what that does is that it as a

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.040 
and what that does is that it as a
counter<00:02:28.100> towards<00:02:28.490> you<00:02:28.670> or<00:02:28.790> your<00:02:29.150> stun<00:02:29.390> um

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
counter towards you or your stun um

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.350 
counter towards you or your stun um
usually<00:02:30.350> I<00:02:30.530> always<00:02:30.650> start<00:02:31.190> my<00:02:31.250> fights<00:02:31.850> with<00:02:32.150> my

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
usually I always start my fights with my

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.810 
usually I always start my fights with my
slim<00:02:32.630> already<00:02:32.900> up<00:02:33.110> but<00:02:33.710> you<00:02:34.130> know<00:02:34.280> sometimes

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.140 
slim already up but you know sometimes
you<00:02:35.450> don't<00:02:35.630> have<00:02:35.840> that<00:02:36.170> luxury<00:02:36.530> so<00:02:37.070> you<00:02:37.610> see<00:02:37.970> me

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.790 
the map I'm trying to get my spun up
during<00:02:43.940> teamfights<00:02:44.360> I<00:02:44.930> always<00:02:45.290> use<00:02:45.560> my

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
during teamfights I always use my

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.760 
during teamfights I always use my
tippers<00:02:46.310> first<00:02:46.550> if<00:02:46.730> I<00:02:46.820> have<00:02:46.970> my<00:02:47.120> stun<00:02:47.450> up<00:02:47.770> what

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
tippers first if I have my stun up what

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:50.710 
tippers first if I have my stun up what
that<00:02:48.800> does<00:02:49.070> that<00:02:49.100> it<00:02:49.610> stuns<00:02:50.000> the<00:02:50.270> whole<00:02:50.420> team

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
that does that it stuns the whole team

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.860 
that does that it stuns the whole team
it<00:02:51.560> puts<00:02:51.860> them<00:02:51.950> out<00:02:52.040> of<00:02:52.160> handicap<00:02:52.700> your<00:02:53.390> cubers

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
it puts them out of handicap your cubers

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.460 
it puts them out of handicap your cubers
also<00:02:54.410> those<00:02:54.590> great<00:02:54.890> AoE<00:02:55.250> damage<00:02:55.630> so<00:02:56.630> they're

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
also those great AoE damage so they're

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.260

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
they're crippled already and you do

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.710 
they're crippled already and you do
their<00:02:59.450> qw<00:03:00.670> shield<00:03:01.670> combo<00:03:01.940> what<00:03:02.330> that<00:03:02.450> does<00:03:02.600> is

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
their qw shield combo what that does is

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.230 
their qw shield combo what that does is

thats for stun counters and all you have
to<00:03:05.270> do<00:03:05.450> is<00:03:05.540> just<00:03:05.690> wait<00:03:05.870> for<00:03:06.200> your<00:03:06.320> cue<00:03:07.010> cooldown

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
to do is just wait for your cue cooldown

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.230

W spell gets off cooldown and that

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.840 
W spell gets off cooldown and that
really<00:03:15.140> helps<00:03:15.500> your<00:03:15.650> team<00:03:15.680> against<00:03:16.280> T<00:03:16.580> fights
