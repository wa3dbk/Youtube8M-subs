00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:20.460
 the expectation in reality that the person 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:23.220
 Wait when she goes to work in the world. 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.750
 of fashion and what she actually has there today 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.750
 in day is a little scary that I think 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:31.320
 what people expect so in Abobo and 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:34.559
 do not expect to win everything and win fast 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.300
 in a year to 60 stagnant dance is already 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.719
 want a body not only that but 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.609
 I like nothing is and so people are 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.530
 so I think really the speed 

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:45.780
 of the internet brought an expectation to 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.699
 people of achievement achievements of the 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.749
 fifa of life that is very dangerous 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:50.640
 we really hope that things 

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:51.300
 happen promotions increases 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.909
 salary 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.920
 the travels of glamor and it's not like that right 

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:57.829
 so it's important for you to find 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.940
 human you do not burn steps 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:01.710
 because otherwise you will be left with a 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.290
 hole there inside you but you go 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.170
 grow you do not have the base then who 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.360
 need to carry bags need to meet 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.340
 Phone needs to serve coffee. 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.040
 I do this I think the person waits 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.840
 really living in a world of glamor 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.490
 and then when he comes here realizes that zeca 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.800
 It's the weekend you're going to have to put 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.030
 silva was also a photo that will have 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.130
 what to do weekend cover people 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.440
 will put the paint on the week the sight gets 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.050
 frustrated and talking about defending my life 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.430
 personnel is committed that the person 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.530
 go away then if the person 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.110
 It really is not compromised that I 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.180
 I always say but it's not like that you do not 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.890
 can be compromised only with work to 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.150
 people do this no longer exists in 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.730
 career no committed scientist 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.130
 with the project of life if also of a 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:46.290
 project something bigger than a job 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.380
 who will pay their bills because 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.910
 ah ah ah the barriers will come a lot 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.160
 our easy life will have to 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.210
 swallowing a lot of people's frog 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.280
 It is upon who is under 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.560
 fifth equal then so you want 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.570
 much so it really needs to be 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.580
 a career that you see that you 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.170
 Take pleasure in your day to day life and you 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.180
 really take it as an investment 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.710
 What am I doing in you to reap? 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.200
 fruits in the future 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.420
 now for those who want to work with fashion 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.020
 Let's put it there, I'll tell you, Monica. 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.440
 Pleasure I'd really like to 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:19.450
 work on the glamor I should have 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.800
 to work with fashion 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.920
 Look I think it has to be Gotta have it 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.680
 a theoretical basis so solid then 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.450
 so look I said I did not college 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.550
 fashion taxation journalism but we 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.920
 have to look for resources in courses that 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.600
 that complement their training and 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.670
 I think there has to be a lot of magazine. 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.370
 who knows a lot that everyone knows what 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.780
 each magazine makes the face of capital 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.580
 the world's top 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.260
 both national photographers and 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.330
 So who does what ? 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.220
 any trademark of everyone who 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:51.250
 the person arrives with this 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.090
 with such a theoretical package already helps 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.040
 enough 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.620
 You have a very similar profession. 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.960
 with the devil's miranda wears prada 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.000
 you see yourself as she sees you 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:04.300
 it looks more peaceful 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.930
 Oh, people will be I do not know is a very vision 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:09.610
 so romanticized is not of the thing 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.160
 so much so that I have also worked in the 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:15.010
 mouth and I know that in practice it's nothing 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:18.400
 of that for my new one in Brazil but I 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:21.280
 I think there's something I understand. 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:24.250
 a little saved from discussions but that 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.650
 you acquire a hardness for you to 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.209
 deal with all the pressure that this time 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.730
 of the responsibility that you have 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:33.370
 acquires shielding so then 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.140
 sometimes you can sound very hard 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.870
 when in fact you just want to solve 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.400
 that very fast objectively 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.110
 and sometimes you have that the collection has 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.680
 to be demanding in their collection that 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:49.410
 happens the super demanding but I give 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.410
 example you see yourself as ten years from now 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.130
 I once again doing magazine or 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.810
 doing the content is so I do not think 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.940
 that the journals a thorough is not enough that 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.590
 they will end soon I see myself doing the 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:03.240
 I want the globe to be the 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:05.830
 magazine number 1 in terms of circulation 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:09.160
 and in terms of advertising revenue in 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:11.330
 branded terms is that you can also 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:14.450
 take a picture with the phone 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:16.790
