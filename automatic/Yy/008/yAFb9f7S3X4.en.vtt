00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.070

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.640
 greening event already of super smash 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.170
 bros is worth wii guys the 3ds 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.580
 Yes in Japan because you know they are very 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.540
 given to do this type of events and 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.129
 this kind of thing 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.190
 rancik have done a greening event 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:48.530
 already from the smash is at level 36 and that's 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.970
 what little let's say I can tell you about 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.350
 moment so nothing good guys let's go 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.760
 to direct us a pokemon center for 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.500
 receive it and so if you can 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.239
 specify a little more information 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.250
 the truth, guys, if you're interested 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:00.140
 let's say we have this great and if 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.520
 we got 500 likes if you put it on 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.320
 the comment box 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.390
 I will surely consider making a 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.800
 deal is worth a pokÃ©mon so good 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.869
 as it is being is in the line that 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.640
 I also imagine that it is interchangeable 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:12.860
 because it's a totally normal medium what 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.649
 what happens, well, what do you say or japan is 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.149
 somewhat specific and such but good 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:18.740
 good morning I had to be alfredo I'm 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:20.479
 playing my son on his own but his 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.369
 personal voucher was a mysterious gift 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:23.750
 for you and here you have not, now you play 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:24.260
 it's full go by god good I'm 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.240
 playing on me 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.460
 in my game as I said good not the 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.830
 that I recorded but another valera of my ruby 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.360
 rubin so nothing that can consider 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.130
 degree by the way so I'm going to leave the 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.870
 atheists who is not part of the team that 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.330
 I only have today for as you see for two 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.950
 of minimums between the atios and line a lo 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.720
 they cover everything and well then I tell them with 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:45.680
 surf and you're going to see let's talk about 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:47.990
 a girl yes yes it would be alfredo and for 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.310
 please give me ninja is worth thanks 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.260
 no need to put we do not leave the 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.400
 rebound unfortunately until the next 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.650
 it's worth nothing we're going to see the team 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.420
 pokemon and to see good as has been said 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.010
 it's a mini at level 36 I do not know if it's 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.020
 stuck in a special pole when yes 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:02.450
 look at the water event ballot 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.700
 sinister imagine it will be more or something 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.500
 so by the way is a fine girl type 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.360
 so the skill, as I say, is 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.760
 pretty good and I rent a lot to have a 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.140
 greening already of this type or let's say 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:13.730
 There would be a fine for those who do not know 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.840
 what is because I wonder more during 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.209
 in the comments you want fine 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.100
 type voucher changes your type of movement 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:20.630
 that ended the movement that I 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.950
 they like, imagine, take a 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.510
 suv shuriken of water then I re 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.420
 ninja instead of being sinister water 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.459
 will happen to be just water type instead if 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.620
 you change shadow vile vou me re ninja 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:32.510
 will become a ghost 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.640
 your substitute migrates child will become 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.379
 normal type ie it depends on the type 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.239
 of the attack that we use which is 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:39.950
 very good because we always hit having 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:41.269
 staff is pretty good this big line 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.709
 2 especially if you want to get a 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:44.810
 line with fine type so nothing that's 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:47.390
 It is very exciting to share this 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.190
 type then nothing or a raffle on twitter 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.510
 they just put in the box 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.790
 comments surely do it in plan 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.769
 draw since good for now in hours 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.629
 I can not clone so it does deals 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:58.250
 mother a bit more expensive and are left 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:00.079
 guys it is to taste rich leave a like 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.870
 and a favorite the goal for study 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:05.090
 There are 500 likes as I said earlier 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.410
 and nothing good then you have a rabbit that 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.810
 I think you can not learn from all 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.980
 forms so I'm not sure if I 'm going to 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.540
 learn still shadow and but hey it's 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.849
 well as always is first and such 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.200
 I do not know that I learned that very well 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:17.659
 the truth because they have fucked me quite 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.940
 in never see when he plays see x and over 

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:21.260
 everything competitive the little ones that I play 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.489
 more he fucked that attack because 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.980
 company to have preference over 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:26.750
 damn double and not the evolution that does not 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.280
 with him as it is called finally in any 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.780
