land without teleporting back or
anything<00:00:17.430> just<00:00:17.760> seeing<00:00:18.210> how<00:00:18.330> long<00:00:18.359> i<00:00:18.570> can<00:00:18.690> get

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:19.100 
anything just seeing how long i can get

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.939 
anything just seeing how long i can get
I<00:00:20.539> was<00:00:21.539> not<00:00:21.689> going<00:00:21.869> for<00:00:22.080> kills<00:00:22.289> and<00:00:22.619> I<00:00:22.680> know<00:00:22.740> the

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
I was not going for kills and I know the

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.650 
I was not going for kills and I know the
leaderboards<00:00:23.519> are<00:00:23.609> based<00:00:23.820> on<00:00:24.029> that<00:00:24.210> so<00:00:24.539> I'm

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
leaderboards are based on that so I'm

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.150 
leaderboards are based on that so I'm
not<00:00:24.689> higher<00:00:24.990> than<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.289> other<00:00:25.439> boards<00:00:25.680> but<00:00:25.920> I

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
not higher than the other boards but I

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.660 
not higher than the other boards but I
think<00:00:27.000> I've<00:00:27.150> probably<00:00:27.720> broken<00:00:28.140> up<00:00:28.500> my<00:00:29.369> hope

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
think I've probably broken up my hope

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.780 
think I've probably broken up my hope
I've<00:00:29.910> broken<00:00:30.300> a<00:00:30.390> record<00:00:30.599> if<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:32.250> longest<00:00:32.730> time

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
I've broken a record if the longest time

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.930 
I've broken a record if the longest time
survives<00:00:33.239> I<00:00:33.480> end<00:00:33.630> up<00:00:33.809> surviving<00:00:34.250> one<00:00:35.250> hour<00:00:35.460> one

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940
