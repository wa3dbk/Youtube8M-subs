00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.809
 I wanted far away 2014 between europe is close 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.030
 very special mobile honor that you give 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.130
 a little features this 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.050
 aircraft to a st ms10 glider motor 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.480
 you throw motor gliders with manufacturing 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.730
 German is built Belgian strauss 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.430
 near berlin is characterized by one 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.859
 high wingspan of 23 meters has the 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.449
 possibility to fold up even the wings of 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.010
 close it up to a wingspan of 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.590
 11 meters and a half 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:38.129
 installs a turbo 9 14 rotax engine from 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.780
 115 horses and 50 of efficiency 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.120
 this means that for every thousand 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.879
 meters of loss of the motor glider share 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.570
 can travel horizontally for 50 km 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:52.500
 he has a ratio of 1 to 50 without a motor 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.659
 exactly the propeller we don't see it now goes 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.199
 we will set in motion see her erika 

00:00:54.659 --> 00:01:01.170
 because it is practically enclosed in 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.960
 nose in the moment in which it is put 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.880
 in motion by centrifugal action the 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.280
 shovels and begins to do its job 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.340
 of helix is â€‹â€‹a motor glider or light note 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.320
 this is a motor glider and as such 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.710
 registered as an aviation aircraft 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.840
 general is a motorized glider because 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.760
 the very high efficiency that limited partnership 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.390
 and 51 as we have just barely 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:26.340
 specified makes it much more flexible 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.140
 like the old ones like powered airplanes 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.140
 we can also be a mascot on board 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:37.140
 practically one of the well-known dogs 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.360
 airport is not the first flight or him 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.900
 it will have 3 400 flight hours already in fact it is 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.430
 the name of the dog eight von frisch 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:47.000
 complicate good trip at all is a 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.000
 fruit 8
