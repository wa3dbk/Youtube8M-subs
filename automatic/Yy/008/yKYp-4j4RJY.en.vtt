company<00:00:03.000> originally<00:00:03.990> this<00:00:04.290> was<00:00:04.350> some<00:00:04.950> sort<00:00:05.250> of

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
company originally this was some sort of

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.480 
company originally this was some sort of
entertainment<00:00:06.379> amplifiers<00:00:07.379> it<00:00:08.069> had<00:00:08.220> some

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
entertainment amplifiers it had some

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.549 
entertainment amplifiers it had some
sort<00:00:08.700> of<00:00:08.730> weird<00:00:08.970> switching<00:00:09.510> and<00:00:09.719> inputs<00:00:10.139> for

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
sort of weird switching and inputs for

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.310 
sort of weird switching and inputs for
various<00:00:11.150> ancillary<00:00:12.150> equipment<00:00:12.719> where

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
various ancillary equipment where

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.310 
various ancillary equipment where
there's<00:00:13.500> tuners<00:00:14.099> or<00:00:14.549> photos<00:00:15.059> or<00:00:15.240> whatever<00:00:15.330> so

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
there's tuners or photos or whatever so

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.980 
there's tuners or photos or whatever so
instead<00:00:16.890> of<00:00:16.949> you<00:00:17.640> know<00:00:17.699> utilizing<00:00:18.449> everything

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
instead of you know utilizing everything

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.599 
instead of you know utilizing everything
that<00:00:19.170> was<00:00:19.320> there<00:00:19.529> I<00:00:19.560> just<00:00:19.859> stripped<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.400> thing

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
that was there I just stripped the thing

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.519 
that was there I just stripped the thing
of<00:00:20.820> all<00:00:21.029> the<00:00:21.270> original<00:00:21.630> components<00:00:22.199> Reed<00:00:22.350> and

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
of all the original components Reed and

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.120 
of all the original components Reed and
built<00:00:22.800> up<00:00:22.949> everything<00:00:23.519> point-to-point<00:00:25.130> the

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
built up everything point-to-point the

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.710 
built up everything point-to-point the
amps<00:00:26.490> that<00:00:26.640> have<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:27.000> least<00:00:27.240> amount<00:00:27.449> of

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
amps that have the least amount of

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.750 
amps that have the least amount of
componentry<00:00:28.380> in<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.710> signal<00:00:29.099> path<00:00:29.130> always

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
componentry in the signal path always

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.880 
componentry in the signal path always
seem<00:00:29.970> to<00:00:30.000> sound<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.510> best<00:00:30.720> with<00:00:30.990> me<00:00:31.140> it's

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
seem to sound the best with me it's

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.160 
seem to sound the best with me it's
about<00:00:32.130> a<00:00:32.340> simple<00:00:32.910> circuit<00:00:33.630> that<00:00:33.780> you<00:00:33.989> can

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
about a simple circuit that you can

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.010 
about a simple circuit that you can
possibly<00:00:34.410> come<00:00:34.920> up<00:00:35.100> with<00:00:35.239> very<00:00:36.239> few<00:00:36.480> parts<00:00:36.870> in

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020

I<00:01:16.100> added<00:01:17.100> an<00:01:17.340> on/off<00:01:17.790> switch<00:01:17.820> which<00:01:18.540> it<00:01:18.780> did

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
I added an on/off switch which it did

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.789 
I added an on/off switch which it did
not<00:01:19.110> have<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:20.580> fuse<00:01:20.880> holder<00:01:21.500> which<00:01:22.500> it<00:01:22.650> did

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
not have and a fuse holder which it did

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.460 
not have and a fuse holder which it did
not<00:01:22.920> have<00:01:23.159> add<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:23.909> fancy<00:01:24.270> little<00:01:24.570> old<00:01:24.840> vintage

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
not have add a fancy little old vintage

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.679 
not have add a fancy little old vintage
bakelite<00:01:26.280> knob<00:01:26.549> on<00:01:26.790> there<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.180> adjustable

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
bakelite knob on there the adjustable

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.330 
bakelite knob on there the adjustable
hum<00:01:27.930> balance<00:01:28.350> believe<00:01:28.650> it<00:01:28.740> or<00:01:28.860> not<00:01:28.950> still

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
hum balance believe it or not still

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.760 
hum balance believe it or not still
works<00:01:29.670> so<00:01:30.420> that's<00:01:30.869> still<00:01:31.110> in<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.380> circuit

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
works so that's still in the circuit

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.940 
works so that's still in the circuit
doesn't<00:01:32.009> basically<00:01:33.170> built<00:01:34.170> it<00:01:34.320> up<00:01:34.439> is<00:01:34.590> just

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
doesn't basically built it up is just

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.310 
doesn't basically built it up is just
like<00:01:35.100> a<00:01:35.130> queen<00:01:35.490> champ<00:01:35.820> for<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.780> most<00:01:36.960> part

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
like a queen champ for the most part

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.740 
like a queen champ for the most part
otherwise<00:01:38.009> it's<00:01:38.340> not<00:01:39.210> really<00:01:39.450> much<00:01:39.600> has

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
otherwise it's not really much has

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:40.670 
otherwise it's not really much has
changed<00:01:39.810> about<00:01:40.320> it

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
changed about it

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.320 
changed about it
we'll<00:01:40.860> see<00:01:41.009> how<00:01:41.130> it<00:01:41.159> sounds

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:03:05.880 

watch<00:01:44.990> the<00:01:45.230> film<00:01:45.560> in<00:01:45.770> slow

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.210 

well<00:03:06.890> this<00:03:07.370> is<00:03:07.520> the<00:03:07.640> final<00:03:07.970> product<00:03:08.210> and<00:03:09.220> with

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
well this is the final product and with

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.030 
well this is the final product and with
about<00:03:10.490> maybe<00:03:10.910> three<00:03:11.540> to<00:03:11.660> four<00:03:11.870> hours<00:03:12.260> of<00:03:12.680> labor

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
about maybe three to four hours of labor

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.010 
about maybe three to four hours of labor
and<00:03:13.540> maybe<00:03:14.540> around<00:03:14.690> $20<00:03:15.440> for<00:03:15.590> the<00:03:15.680> parts<00:03:17.020> we

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.020 
and maybe around $20 for the parts we

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.860 
and maybe around $20 for the parts we
got<00:03:18.050> a<00:03:18.200> secure<00:03:18.560> little<00:03:18.920> lamp<00:03:19.300> the<00:03:20.300> original

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
got a secure little lamp the original

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.380 
got a secure little lamp the original
target<00:03:21.170> was<00:03:21.560> to<00:03:21.770> keep<00:03:21.980> this<00:03:22.430> project<00:03:22.820> under

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
target was to keep this project under

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.230 
target was to keep this project under
$200<00:03:24.260> and<00:03:24.470> I<00:03:25.040> think<00:03:25.280> we<00:03:25.400> did<00:03:25.610> pretty<00:03:25.640> good<00:03:25.910> on

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:26.240 
$200 and I think we did pretty good on

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:43.220 
$200 and I think we did pretty good on
that

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:59.680
