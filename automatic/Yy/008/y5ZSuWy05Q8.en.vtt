theory he telling his life tank had been
wrong<00:04:59.040> toys<00:04:59.310> and<00:04:59.669> therefore<00:05:00.120> less<00:05:00.270> likely<00:05:00.870> to

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
wrong toys and therefore less likely to

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:02.780 
wrong toys and therefore less likely to
be<00:05:01.110> right<00:05:01.290> then<00:05:01.860> the<00:05:01.979> professor<00:05:02.430> had<00:05:02.610> only

be right then the professor had only

be right then the professor had only
ever<00:05:02.910> been<00:05:03.240> wrong<00:05:03.390> once<00:05:03.600> and<00:05:03.990> hence<00:05:04.590> the<00:05:04.770> man

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:04.979 
ever been wrong once and hence the man

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:06.830 
ever been wrong once and hence the man
most<00:05:05.250> likely<00:05:05.400> to<00:05:05.910> be<00:05:06.030> right<00:05:06.240> and<00:05:06.450> therefore

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
most likely to be right and therefore

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.279 
most likely to be right and therefore
most<00:05:07.320> probably<00:05:07.830> right
