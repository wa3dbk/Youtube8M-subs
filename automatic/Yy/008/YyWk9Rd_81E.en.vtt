 no what during what do you and me 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.470
 I'm pretty sure we had to meet some delays 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.720
 on the road 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.759
 in any country 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:24.569
 driving your car 

00:00:24.569 --> 00:00:27.659

 I like the adventurous and I rolled my hump four corners of the world 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.400
 I crossed the borders 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.450
 eat them miles of dust 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.740
 of snow 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:43.980
 that time 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.760
 I was doing the line on the California highway 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.090

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:51.780
 right antonetti 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.730
 she had been driving for too long 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.980
 fatigue begins to be felt 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.690
 when I was awake the boyfriend who was sleeping in the bunk 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.690
 to keep me company would be leaning radiotelephone from fortis 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.480
 the mobile phones how the call to the usa 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.300
 it is a device that can allow 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.110
 another group i 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.090
 keep him in touch 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.910
 twelve help each other in four hits 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.320
 kevin really sliced ​​the channel 27 so stone 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.550
 what are the usual consequences 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:21.620
 because I heard 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.850
 across africa days are short 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.290
 a little distant voice that speak 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.290
 a little bit of children that welcomes 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.830
 for the road 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.250
 it was the idea 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.430
 heard everything 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.300
 answer me 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.370
 because it's the inverted insured mission 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.370
 questionnaires 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.260
 must she telly 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.260
 a polygamist answered a little closer 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.560
 I call truckers 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.910
 yet attempted dictatorship 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.120
 I'm all alone 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.440
 I am bored 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.150
 and I would like to talk to him a little 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.390
 I call you a few steps from my dad's phone 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.529
 this summer we had a very serious accident 

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:12.719
 I am still in my bed 

00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:15.139
 the doctor says I'll be able to walk again one day 

00:02:15.139 --> 00:02:17.939
 it will surely be very good 

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:20.279
 I live in a house near the highway 

00:02:20.279 --> 00:02:22.159
 I am often alone in the evening 

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:25.589

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:28.519

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:29.879
 bed 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:32.409
 so from time to time for small errands 

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:35.459
 now we never read again so quiet here 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.129
 big danger is to hang on 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:40.239
 with a radio-phone that fits to talk to you a little too much 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:43.199
 when we go on the highway 

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:45.009
 I am not a girl 

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:47.949
 poutine suddenly seems like my eyes are blurred 

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:50.369
 moreover I paid my debt 

00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:53.309
 because was the engine at the forefront branch coming 

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:55.699
 I take out the card 

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:56.909
 and I who said 

00:02:56.909 --> 00:02:59.159
 usually it's so 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:01.779
 a little more if you have the house 

00:03:01.779 --> 00:03:03.999
 I had an advance on the schedule 

00:03:03.999 --> 00:03:05.859
 this restarting 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:08.549
 they come off the highways 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:10.859
 although I went down to get home 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:13.119
 I was not the first good sense 

00:03:13.119 --> 00:03:15.209
 cissed norm dads-u was expecting me 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.149

00:03:19.149 --> 00:03:21.329
 others were still coming 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:24.079
 to wake up my teammate who did not believe his eyes 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:25.699
 we all entered 

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:27.289
 for the exit of his country 

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:28.969
 and it was really worth it 

00:03:28.969 --> 00:03:32.209
 everyone wanted to wear placing behind his steering wheel 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:35.209
 the cajoler 

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:39.179
 we gave him three things we had in the closet 

00:03:39.179 --> 00:03:42.439
 and then you had to think about his followers 

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:43.839
 hello friends in bed 

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:46.549
 after kissing one last time 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:48.449
 the grapple on my seat 

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:50.599
 I pulled the starter 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:53.599
 I have seen more than one turkey diverts his head 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:56.049
 for the first time each time we pass on the highway 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:59.049
 we horn honks in a certain way so that they hear us 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:02.379
 when he was a child 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:04.389
 I did not do 3 km 

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:06.399
 google phone who was living again 

00:04:06.399 --> 00:04:08.579

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:11.579
 an emotional voice of women 

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:14.009
 the road 

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:15.849

 I listened to the radio phone 

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:29.819

00:04:29.819 --> 00:04:31.979
