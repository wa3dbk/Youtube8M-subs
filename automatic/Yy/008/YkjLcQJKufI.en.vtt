this<00:01:27.240> is<00:01:27.299> actually<00:01:27.540> very<00:01:27.780> very<00:01:28.229> important<00:01:28.680> in

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
this is actually very very important in

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.260 
this is actually very very important in
my<00:01:28.890> opinion<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.520> I<00:01:29.610> cannot<00:01:29.820> stress<00:01:30.060> this

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
my opinion and I cannot stress this

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.730 
my opinion and I cannot stress this
enough<00:01:30.329> that<00:01:30.750> you<00:01:30.840> must<00:01:30.990> take<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.229> backup<00:01:31.530> of

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
enough that you must take a backup of

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.620 
enough that you must take a backup of
your<00:01:31.799> system<00:01:32.220> before<00:01:32.369> flashing<00:01:32.970> any<00:01:33.270> kind<00:01:33.509> of

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
your system before flashing any kind of

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.690 
your system before flashing any kind of
new<00:01:33.750> rom<00:01:33.990> now<00:01:34.770> this<00:01:34.950> is<00:01:35.130> very<00:01:35.310> important

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
new rom now this is very important

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.280 
new rom now this is very important
because<00:01:35.759> if<00:01:36.060> anything<00:01:36.240> goes<00:01:36.509> wrong<00:01:36.630> you<00:01:37.110> can

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
because if anything goes wrong you can
