00:01:39.169 --> 00:01:39.179 
regular HTC wall wart and then this of

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:41.239 
regular HTC wall wart and then this of
course<00:01:39.389> is<00:01:39.719> where<00:01:39.960> you<00:01:40.590> connect<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.219> two

00:01:41.239 --> 00:01:41.249 
course is where you connect the two

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:44.239 
course is where you connect the two
together<00:01:41.939> which<00:01:42.929> of<00:01:43.079> course<00:01:43.319> doing<00:01:43.560> on<00:01:43.799> camera

00:01:44.239 --> 00:01:44.249 
together which of course doing on camera

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:46.249 
together which of course doing on camera
is<00:01:44.399> not<00:01:44.969> as<00:01:45.179> easy<00:01:45.479> as<00:01:45.659> you'd<00:01:45.840> think

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
is not as easy as you'd think

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.609 
is not as easy as you'd think
so<00:01:46.649> if<00:01:46.920> I<00:01:47.039> were<00:01:47.689> non-us<00:01:48.689> that<00:01:49.109> would<00:01:49.289> be<00:01:49.409> what<00:01:49.590> I

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
so if I were non-us that would be what I

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.559 
so if I were non-us that would be what I
need<00:01:49.859> to<00:01:49.950> plug<00:01:50.130> into<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.520> wall<00:01:50.549> now<00:01:50.939> it's

00:01:51.559 --> 00:01:51.569 
need to plug into the wall now it's

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:53.840 
need to plug into the wall now it's
unfortunate<00:01:52.229> that<00:01:52.439> there<00:01:52.740> isn't<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:53.219> u.s.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
unfortunate that there isn't a u.s.

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.449 
unfortunate that there isn't a u.s.
prong<00:01:54.719> on<00:01:54.929> it<00:01:55.170> so<00:01:55.590> I'd<00:01:55.889> have<00:01:56.009> to<00:01:56.130> get<00:01:56.249> another

00:01:56.449 --> 00:01:56.459 
prong on it so I'd have to get another

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:57.859 
prong on it so I'd have to get another
one<00:01:56.639> of<00:01:56.670> these<00:01:56.819> wall<00:01:57.090> plates<00:01:57.359> to<00:01:57.479> do<00:01:57.539> it<00:01:57.689> but

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
one of these wall plates to do it but

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.289 
one of these wall plates to do it but
it's<00:01:58.380> USB<00:01:58.740> so<00:01:59.310> I<00:01:59.340> don't<00:01:59.729> really<00:01:59.939> need<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.179> worry

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
it's USB so I don't really need to worry

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.330 
it's USB so I don't really need to worry
about<00:02:00.600> that<00:02:00.779> let's<00:02:01.619> go<00:02:01.740> ahead<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:02.009> see<00:02:02.130> what

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
about that let's go ahead and see what

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.899 
about that let's go ahead and see what
else<00:02:02.490> is<00:02:02.670> in<00:02:02.819> here<00:02:02.850> of<00:02:03.779> course<00:02:05.119> you've<00:02:06.119> got<00:02:06.149> the

side you've got your volume up down

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.700 
side you've got your volume up down
rocker<00:04:18.359> it<00:04:18.690> looks<00:04:18.959> like<00:04:19.169> but<00:04:21.229> wow<00:04:22.229> that's

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
rocker it looks like but wow that's

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.430 
rocker it looks like but wow that's
funky<00:04:23.279> okay<00:04:23.849> so<00:04:24.240> this<00:04:24.389> isn't<00:04:24.630> a<00:04:24.930> rocker<00:04:25.260> up

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
funky okay so this isn't a rocker up

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.379 
funky okay so this isn't a rocker up
here<00:04:26.219> it's<00:04:26.430> this

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
here it's this

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:29.390 
here it's this
button<00:04:27.900> right<00:04:28.349> there<00:04:28.379> and<00:04:28.620> then<00:04:29.009> down<00:04:29.219> there

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
button right there and then down there

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.980 
button right there and then down there
so<00:04:29.550> it's<00:04:29.669> not<00:04:29.789> really<00:04:30.060> a<00:04:30.090> rocker<00:04:30.419> it's<00:04:30.659> more<00:04:30.870> of

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
so it's not really a rocker it's more of

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.520 
so it's not really a rocker it's more of
a<00:04:31.110> soft<00:04:32.389> area<00:04:33.389> of<00:04:33.659> the<00:04:33.810> phone<00:04:34.020> that<00:04:34.259> you<00:04:34.349> can

a soft area of the phone that you can
push<00:04:34.830> in<00:04:35.039> to<00:04:35.509> get<00:04:36.509> it<00:04:36.599> going<00:04:36.779> up<00:04:37.050> and<00:04:37.229> down<00:04:37.349> so

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
push in to get it going up and down so

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.379
