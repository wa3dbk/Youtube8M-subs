fact<00:03:29.020> that<00:03:29.230> originated<00:03:29.950> when<00:03:30.130> we<00:03:30.220> first

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
fact that originated when we first

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:32.850

made<00:03:33.100> China<00:03:33.400> cups<00:03:33.730> no<00:03:34.120> good<00:03:34.330> with<00:03:34.450> heat<00:03:34.920> so<00:03:36.060> if

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
made China cups no good with heat so if

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.110 
made China cups no good with heat so if
you<00:03:37.300> poured<00:03:37.660> the<00:03:37.860> boiling<00:03:38.860> tea<00:03:39.460> or<00:03:39.670> hot<00:03:39.910> tea

about the temperature that you brew that
