hey this day the Shepherd school and

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:04.940 
hey this day the Shepherd school and
today<00:00:02.669> we're<00:00:02.909> going<00:00:03.179> to<00:00:03.419> make<00:00:03.570> us<00:00:03.780> holy<00:00:04.350> infant

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
today we're going to make us holy infant

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:06.769 
today we're going to make us holy infant
cereal<00:00:05.400> and<00:00:05.670> there's<00:00:06.029> a<00:00:06.120> couple<00:00:06.450> different

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
cereal and there's a couple different

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.160 
cereal and there's a couple different
ways<00:00:06.810> of<00:00:07.140> doing<00:00:07.290> it<00:00:07.529> one<00:00:07.919> method<00:00:08.849> is<00:00:09.090> to<00:00:09.170> go

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
ways of doing it one method is to go

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.930 
ways of doing it one method is to go
ahead<00:00:10.290> and<00:00:10.650> grind<00:00:10.830> your<00:00:11.130> cereal<00:00:11.610> and<00:00:11.730> then

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
ahead and grind your cereal and then

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.120 
ahead and grind your cereal and then
cook<00:00:12.179> it<00:00:12.210> and<00:00:12.570> it<00:00:12.660> takes<00:00:12.929> less<00:00:13.200> time<00:00:13.349> then

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
cook it and it takes less time then

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.070 
cook it and it takes less time then
probably<00:00:14.580> it's<00:00:14.700> the<00:00:14.790> better<00:00:15.089> way<00:00:15.389> but<00:00:15.929> today

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
probably it's the better way but today

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.840 
probably it's the better way but today
we're<00:00:16.500> going<00:00:16.650> to<00:00:16.740> do<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:17.070> one<00:00:17.220> that<00:00:17.369> uses<00:00:17.670> less

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
we're going to do the one that uses less

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.050 
we're going to do the one that uses less
equipment<00:00:18.390> we're<00:00:18.510> going<00:00:18.539> to<00:00:19.080> just<00:00:19.740> cook<00:00:20.070> some

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
equipment we're going to just cook some

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.140 
equipment we're going to just cook some
brown<00:00:21.330> rice<00:00:21.359> and<00:00:22.080> then<00:00:22.740> puree<00:00:23.039> it<00:00:23.220> and<00:00:23.430> add<00:00:23.970> in

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
brown rice and then puree it and add in

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.570 
brown rice and then puree it and add in
enough<00:00:24.480> breast<00:00:25.320> milk<00:00:25.439> or<00:00:25.800> infant<00:00:25.890> formula<00:00:26.430> to

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
enough breast milk or infant formula to

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.730 
enough breast milk or infant formula to
get<00:00:26.699> to<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.029> consistency<00:00:27.810> that<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.529> baby

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
get to the consistency that the baby

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.450 
get to the consistency that the baby
wants<00:00:29.160> this<00:00:29.640> way<00:00:30.119> is<00:00:30.359> a<00:00:31.230> little<00:00:31.679> simpler<00:00:32.250> but

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
wants this way is a little simpler but

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.639 
wants this way is a little simpler but
it<00:00:32.550> takes<00:00:32.730> longer<00:00:32.969> to<00:00:33.239> cook<00:00:33.270> and<00:00:33.750> sometimes

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
it takes longer to cook and sometimes

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.620 
it takes longer to cook and sometimes
where<00:00:34.980> I<00:00:35.010> see<00:00:35.130> can<00:00:35.430> become<00:00:35.730> a<00:00:35.790> little<00:00:36.090> pasty

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
where I see can become a little pasty

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.290 
where I see can become a little pasty
I'm<00:00:37.140> doing<00:00:37.530> this<00:00:37.620> man<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:38.309> that<00:00:38.730> before<00:00:39.210> we

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300

okay so just like regular cooking rice

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.980 
okay so just like regular cooking rice
we're<00:01:26.280> going<00:01:26.400> to<00:01:26.460> get<00:01:26.580> this<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:26.939> bowl<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:27.390> then

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
we're going to get this to bowl and then

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.359 
we're going to get this to bowl and then
we're<00:01:28.259> going<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.650> add<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.759> rice<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.180> cook<00:01:30.299> it

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
it in a little blender jar and now we're

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.160 
it in a little blender jar and now we're
going<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.070> blend<00:01:38.280> it<00:01:38.430> up<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:38.820> mix<00:01:39.600> it<00:01:39.869> with

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.190 
going to blend it up and mix it with
enough<00:01:41.159> formula<00:01:41.759> or<00:01:41.909> breast<00:01:42.210> milk<00:01:42.420> depending

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
enough formula or breast milk depending

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.410 
enough formula or breast milk depending
to<00:01:43.829> get<00:01:44.040> it<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.369> consistency<00:01:44.729> that<00:01:45.180> we

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
to get it to the consistency that we

00:01:45.420 --> 00:02:02.800 
to get it to the consistency that we
want<00:01:45.689> for<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.619> kid

so<00:02:03.810> we<00:02:03.960> added<00:02:04.110> some<00:02:04.380> formula<00:02:04.830> to<00:02:04.980> it<00:02:05.130> and<00:02:05.340> have

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
so we added some formula to it and have

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.249 
so we added some formula to it and have
pureed<00:02:06.780> it<00:02:07.429> and<00:02:08.429> got<00:02:08.789> it<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.360> consistency

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
about as long as the formula does I

about as long as the formula does I
wouldn't<00:03:39.780> try<00:03:40.290> to<00:03:40.350> keep<00:03:40.680> this<00:03:40.890> long-term<00:03:41.480> but

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
wouldn't try to keep this long-term but

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.330 
wouldn't try to keep this long-term but
about<00:03:42.810> as<00:03:42.989> much<00:03:43.200> as<00:03:43.410> you<00:03:43.560> would<00:03:43.739> say<00:03:44.010> for<00:03:44.040> a

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
about as much as you would say for a

when<00:03:50.700> it's<00:03:50.910> time<00:03:51.090> for<00:03:51.120> you<00:03:51.450> to<00:03:51.570> use<00:03:51.600> it<00:03:52.079> you<00:03:52.950> can

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
when it's time for you to use it you can

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:59.180 
when it's time for you to use it you can
just<00:03:53.640> pull<00:03:55.040> put<00:03:56.040> a<00:03:56.070> frozen<00:03:56.989> block<00:03:57.989> in<00:03:58.920> your

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
bottle and then put your formulary or

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.680 
bottle and then put your formulary or
your<00:04:02.489> breast<00:04:02.700> milk<00:04:02.760> in<00:04:03.090> there<00:04:03.329> and<00:04:05.389> heat<00:04:06.389> it<00:04:06.540> up

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
your breast milk in there and heat it up

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.080 
your breast milk in there and heat it up
and<00:04:06.930> it'll<00:04:07.109> mountain<00:04:07.440> it'll<00:04:07.590> mint

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
and it'll mountain it'll mint

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:09.820 
and it'll mountain it'll mint
and<00:04:08.269> that<00:04:08.480> kind<00:04:08.750> of<00:04:08.870> keeps<00:04:09.080> it<00:04:09.230> from<00:04:09.410> gumming

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:09.830 
and that kind of keeps it from gumming

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:16.900 
and that kind of keeps it from gumming
up<00:04:10.120> inside<00:04:11.120> your<00:04:11.420> body<00:04:11.660> okay<00:04:14.410> so<00:04:15.910> probably

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
up inside your body okay so probably

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:34.750 

but<00:04:34.100> there<00:04:34.280> you<00:04:34.400> go

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:34.760 
but there you go

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:35.740 
but there you go
and<00:04:34.910> we'll<00:04:35.060> just<00:04:35.090> stick<00:04:35.389> that<00:04:35.419> in<00:04:35.570> the<00:04:35.720> freezer
