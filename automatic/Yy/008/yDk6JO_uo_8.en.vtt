00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:17.100

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.560
 constantly time they pass very much at home 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:28.640

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:31.220
 like training yes and honestly it 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.460
 but only in 30 years I am the first time 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:38.030
 went to some kind of martial arts here and 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:41.170
 sorry you started doing it earlier because 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.170
 which really gives a lot of energy 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:44.480
 better feeling better feel my 

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:46.879
 body 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.559
 well and in all like positive shifts 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:50.690
 although literally three months have passed and even 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:54.159
 not clear during all the material that is 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:56.269
 the most that it gives it is for that is 

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:57.769
 workouts are very accessible very 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:01:00.199
 there is no such variety here 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:02.869
 something there is the same as every 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:04.250
 since I want to run away, that is, it is not 

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:06.439
 just some kind of advertising to make it 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.880
 really i mean you wonder yes me 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:09.920
 interesting i'm passionate 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.070
 I repeat once again that I used to do 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.590
 in the gym for quite some time 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:18.049
 Well, it would not compare here 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.850
 is engaged in a man specifically training 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:22.340
 are individual 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:24.259
 here and accordingly result and giving 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.210
 result by the way here is such a visible 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:27.259
 the result here you are now 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.799
 felt myself 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:32.659
 what have you changed but first 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:35.090
 moving lifestyle as if the first thing 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:38.810
 noticed it didn't get much easier i 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:41.200
 threw 34 kilograms so I thought to 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.539
 go to the gym and now on these 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.069
 workout actually 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:47.659
 after them already in the gym even well 

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:49.399
 I do not want to rest because not 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:50.600
 house intensive respectively 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:52.860
 the result is also on the body 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.600
 feel confident 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.430
 learned to move if you remember there 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.800
 as this is only the first time I write nulevik 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:02.910
 that is, I never fight there no 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:04.890
 arms and legs for yourself 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:06.750
 like some beat combinations there 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.310
 when girls yes it turns on 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.380
 there is confidence 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.720
 Well, you and you noticed that you have 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.050
 stretching pretty good 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:19.020
 when did you come here and you were raised 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:21.270
 Well, let's say it is a problem no, no 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.590
 it was never but i'm nothing to 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.840
 stretched we were not engaged in school 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.420
 understand everything physical education this 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.720
 the only true thing is stretching here 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.010
 so there is literally 30 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.200
 it's got to come try eat three 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.239
 month and you almost sat on the splits 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.980
 yes yes that is, I have one transverse not 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:40.400
 could beech any completely again 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.400
 you are welcome 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:51.239
 three months handsome thanks 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:53.909
 that is, you foot in the head calm 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.409
 top level fight up well 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:58.709
 of course you need to work more on 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:03:00.959
 technique is clear and you do 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:04.349
 how much inside a month or a little 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:06.900
 less than a little less than 3 class but what 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:09.349
 regards the strength of the strike combination 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.730
 everything is clear that something has changed not 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:12.900
 at first it was certainly like this 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.989
 memorize but how would 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.609
 when these workouts are constantly typing 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:19.739
 stents soaring this is all set aside in 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:21.930
 such an instinctive level and you're already like 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:25.340
 wouldn't you even think hard at first 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:29.069
 o put and then just need 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.480
 say and here began to engage in but 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:31.319
 first one on one with a water coach 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.969
 moved to a couple 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:37.409
 and you started sparring 

00:03:35.969 --> 00:03:39.689
 did you feel prepared for 

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:41.989
 sparring all people whether you are understood in 

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:45.750
 got one gate like she was 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:47.340
 no matter how the first and but several times 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.159
 there was a desire to start sparring but how would 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:53.400
 it was postponed then my letters somewhere 

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:54.900
 week missed ride here then 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.790
 still came because he wants 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.949
 how to be an opponent more equal 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.769
 because all the same with the coach is one thing 

00:03:58.949 --> 00:04:02.250
 and when with an equal opponent it is others 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:04.169
 sensations 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:07.889
 because of such back more turns 

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:09.419
 you did it, yes, I thought 

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:12.269
 will be much worse now and teach him 

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:13.319
 Thing I think is so small in these months 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:15.780
 just really not all 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:17.909
 ok that is what was up 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.949
 training there yes she was not on no 

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:21.690
 for nothing that is she no no this of course 

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:23.190
 i.e. this is the first strike 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.139
 queue protection that is the main thing was 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.310
 learn how not to be afraid of these blows 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:29.220
 i.e 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:31.710
 learn to defend learn to respond 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.780
 in response, as if in time, that is, and not 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.850
 forget house seventeenth closed be well 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:40.350
 that is, without it, I would not go 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:43.200
 because well , after all, not hunting, I 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:45.810
 getting need to be tormented first 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.250
 defend ourselves here we are competent approach 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.830
 that is, this is not something that came to you 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:52.050
 put with someone who knocked on the head 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.630
 here everything is very competent 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.600
 few words to those people who are watching 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.919
 voevozov about Egorievich 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.690
 coaches now on I didn't even expect that 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:03.720
 however, there will be such an approach 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:05.520
 mutual understanding that is, we found a common 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:10.050
 language as it were in sport in principle we 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:12.840
 communicate and not only in training here 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:14.940
 that is, I did not even expect that 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:18.930
 will be very pleased and very happy that 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:22.080
 I chose this place and it coincided 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:25.400
 what do this coach do and how would 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.400
 In general, everything is super thanks
