the 5.1 inch little smaller display of
the<00:00:24.900> galaxy<00:00:25.320> s5<00:00:25.560> so<00:00:26.189> both<00:00:26.400> have<00:00:26.609> 1080p<00:00:27.000> HD

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
the galaxy s5 so both have 1080p HD

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.140 
the galaxy s5 so both have 1080p HD
resolution<00:00:27.869> both<00:00:28.080> have<00:00:28.349> extremely<00:00:28.920> good<00:00:29.150> PPI

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.670 
resolution both have extremely good PPI
above<00:00:31.050> 400<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:31.920> then<00:00:32.759> also<00:00:33.110> the<00:00:34.110> technology

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
above 400 and then also the technology

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.680 
above 400 and then also the technology
is<00:00:34.739> a<00:00:34.829> bit<00:00:34.980> different<00:00:35.190> so<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.880> LG<00:00:36.210> G<00:00:36.329> flex<00:00:36.360> 2

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
is a bit different so the LG G flex 2

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.549 
is a bit different so the LG G flex 2
has<00:00:37.020> P<00:00:37.320> or<00:00:37.739> LED<00:00:38.219> display<00:00:38.610> whereas<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.960> galaxy

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
has P or LED display whereas the galaxy

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.610 
has P or LED display whereas the galaxy
s5<00:00:40.739> comes<00:00:41.100> with<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.399> Super<00:00:41.879> AMOLED<00:00:42.270> display<00:00:42.690> now

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
s5 comes with a Super AMOLED display now

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.000 
s5 comes with a Super AMOLED display now
we<00:00:44.309> haven't<00:00:44.640> seen<00:00:44.850> DP<00:00:45.180> led<00:00:45.600> LED<00:00:46.320> display<00:00:46.710> in

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
we haven't seen DP led LED display in

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.029 
we haven't seen DP led LED display in
our<00:00:47.309> hand<00:00:47.730> so<00:00:48.059> we<00:00:48.300> can't<00:00:48.510> really<00:00:48.629> say<00:00:49.289> what's

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
our hand so we can't really say what's

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.470 
our hand so we can't really say what's
the<00:00:50.219> difference<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.760> what<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.000> improvement

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
the difference and what the improvement

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.360 
the difference and what the improvement
over<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.780> Super<00:00:52.050> AMOLED<00:00:52.320> but<00:00:52.590> of<00:00:53.100> course

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
over the Super AMOLED but of course

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.770 
over the Super AMOLED but of course
we'll<00:00:53.579> see<00:00:53.820> when<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.030> device<00:00:54.270> were<00:00:54.449> going<00:00:54.660> to

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
we'll see when the device were going to

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.889 
we'll see when the device were going to
hit<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.920> markers<00:00:56.340> so<00:00:56.670> also<00:00:57.390> if<00:00:57.660> we<00:00:57.719> talk<00:00:57.870> about

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
hit the markers so also if we talk about

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.529 
hit the markers so also if we talk about
the<00:00:58.170> weight<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.800> LG<00:00:59.219> G<00:00:59.340> flex<00:00:59.370> 2<00:00:59.760> is<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.149> little

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
the weight the LG G flex 2 is a little

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.740 
the weight the LG G flex 2 is a little
bit<00:01:00.660> heavier<00:01:01.050> 150<00:01:01.949> to<00:01:02.039> Chrome<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.640> versus<00:01:03.239> 145

flex 2 is not a water and dust resistant
if<00:01:11.880> we<00:01:12.270> talk<00:01:12.479> about<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:13.130> thickness<00:01:14.130> or

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
if we talk about the thickness or

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.640 
if we talk about the thickness or
thinness<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.030> device<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.570> G<00:01:15.720> flex<00:01:15.930> 2<00:01:16.080> is<00:01:16.380> a

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
thinness of the device the G flex 2 is a

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
2 is of course you know that that it is

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.800 
2 is of course you know that that it is
a<00:02:03.509> curved<00:02:04.469> device<00:02:04.890> it<00:02:05.280> is<00:02:05.369> a<00:02:05.399> bent<00:02:05.850> device<00:02:06.240> it

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
a curved device it is a bent device it

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.490 
a curved device it is a bent device it
has<00:02:06.990> that<00:02:07.439> healing<00:02:07.950> ability<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:08.550> all<00:02:08.640> that<00:02:08.910> so

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
has that healing ability and all that so

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.180 
has that healing ability and all that so
but<00:02:10.500> of<00:02:11.340> course<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.879> s5<00:02:12.239> is<00:02:12.540> on<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:12.930> other

but of course the s5 is on the other

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.460 
but of course the s5 is on the other
just<00:02:13.520> a<00:02:13.580> normal<00:02:13.910> phone<00:02:14.120> but<00:02:14.600> the<00:02:14.690> s5<00:02:14.960> has<00:02:14.990> good

RAM is to divide on both devices but the

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.830 
RAM is to divide on both devices but the
