00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.650 
version and then it disappeared and I
didn't<00:00:24.840> see<00:00:24.990> it<00:00:25.080> again<00:00:25.170> for<00:00:25.439> years<00:00:26.570> so<00:00:27.570> this

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
didn't see it again for years so this

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.099 
didn't see it again for years so this
was<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:27.960> first<00:00:28.170> of<00:00:28.380> many<00:00:28.710> intros<00:00:29.279> I<00:00:29.929> made<00:00:30.929> this

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
was the first of many intros I made this

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.200 
was the first of many intros I made this
one<00:00:31.320> first<00:00:31.619> and<00:00:32.009> I<00:00:32.369> liked<00:00:32.669> it<00:00:32.850> but<00:00:32.940> I<00:00:33.000> thought

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
one first and I liked it but I thought

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.700 
one first and I liked it but I thought
it<00:00:33.300> was<00:00:33.390> a<00:00:33.420> bit<00:00:33.600> long<00:00:33.840> so<00:00:34.230> then<00:00:34.440> I<00:00:34.469> made<00:00:34.680> another

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
it was a bit long so then I made another

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.639 
it was a bit long so then I made another
one<00:00:35.090> and<00:00:36.090> another<00:00:36.420> one<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:36.840> another<00:00:37.230> one<00:00:37.500> and

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
one and another one and another one and

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.150 
one and another one and another one and
I<00:00:38.370> liked<00:00:38.610> him<00:00:38.730> all<00:00:38.850> ok<00:00:39.469> but<00:00:40.469> I<00:00:40.710> didn't<00:00:41.129> think

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
I liked him all ok but I didn't think

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.920 
I liked him all ok but I didn't think
that<00:00:41.399> any<00:00:41.550> of<00:00:41.610> them<00:00:41.760> would<00:00:41.820> quite<00:00:42.300> hold<00:00:42.600> up<00:00:42.809> to

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
that any of them would quite hold up to

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.060 
that any of them would quite hold up to
being<00:00:43.050> played<00:00:43.379> 26<00:00:44.190> times<00:00:44.780> so<00:00:45.780> uh<00:00:45.809> I<00:00:46.410> decided

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
being played 26 times so uh I decided

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:55.069 
being played 26 times so uh I decided
what<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.850> hell<00:00:47.969> I'll<00:00:48.300> use<00:00:48.480> all<00:00:53.840> people<00:00:54.840> did

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
what the hell I'll use all people did

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.299 
what the hell I'll use all people did
not<00:00:55.110> like<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.829> what<00:00:56.010> now<00:00:56.219> thing<00:00:58.309> so

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
not like the what now thing so

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.819 
not like the what now thing so
fortunately<00:00:59.789> that<00:00:59.969> didn't<00:01:00.270> really<00:01:00.690> come<00:01:01.140> up

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
fortunately that didn't really come up

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.490 
fortunately that didn't really come up
much<00:01:02.160> past<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.550> first<00:01:02.760> episode<00:01:03.290> which<00:01:04.290> makes

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
much past the first episode which makes

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.929 
much past the first episode which makes
sense<00:01:04.680> because<00:01:04.860> this<00:01:05.159> is<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.880> UH<00:01:07.580> know<00:01:08.580> early

sense because this is the UH know early

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.420 
sense because this is the UH know early
on<00:01:08.970> when<00:01:09.360> he<00:01:09.750> told<00:01:09.990> me<00:01:10.080> he's<00:01:10.170> still<00:01:10.770> a<00:01:10.799> fish<00:01:11.280> out

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
of water yeah I had this idea with

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.230

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
I just pretty much made everything up as

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.920 
I just pretty much made everything up as
I<00:01:26.250> went<00:01:26.280> along<00:01:26.460> with<00:01:27.240> Ganz<00:01:27.450> I<00:01:27.600> couldn't<00:01:27.869> do

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
I went along with Ganz I couldn't do

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.390 
I went along with Ganz I couldn't do
that<00:01:27.990> because<00:01:28.229> I<00:01:28.439> was<00:01:28.560> working<00:01:28.829> with<00:01:28.920> kassius

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
that because I was working with kassius

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.120 
that because I was working with kassius
and<00:01:29.520> I<00:01:29.549> needed<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:29.820> give<00:01:29.939> her<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.090> script<00:01:30.540> and

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
and I needed to give her a script and

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.700 
and I needed to give her a script and
what<00:01:32.130> I<00:01:32.159> found<00:01:32.430> was<00:01:32.610> that<00:01:32.759> if<00:01:33.509> I<00:01:33.810> during<00:01:34.619> the

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
what I found was that if I during the

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.410 
what I found was that if I during the
editing<00:01:34.829> phase<00:01:35.250> if<00:01:35.460> I'd<00:01:35.579> come<00:01:35.759> up<00:01:35.939> with<00:01:36.090> a<00:01:36.119> joke

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
editing phase if I'd come up with a joke

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.380 
editing phase if I'd come up with a joke
that<00:01:36.780> hadn't<00:01:37.020> been<00:01:37.110> in<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.350> script<00:01:38.329> I'd<00:01:39.329> uh

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
that hadn't been in the script I'd uh

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.450 
that hadn't been in the script I'd uh
I'd<00:01:39.900> always<00:01:40.200> wind<00:01:40.500> up<00:01:40.619> giving<00:01:40.799> that<00:01:41.070> line<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:41.430> a

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
I'd always wind up giving that line to a

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.340 
I'd always wind up giving that line to a
male<00:01:41.700> character<00:01:41.909> instead<00:01:42.540> of<00:01:42.720> a<00:01:42.780> female<00:01:42.990> one

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
male character instead of a female one

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.990 
male character instead of a female one
so<00:01:43.829> that<00:01:43.920> I<00:01:43.979> could<00:01:44.100> just<00:01:44.310> you<00:01:44.430> know<00:01:44.460> record<00:01:44.880> the

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
so that I could just you know record the

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.240 
so that I could just you know record the
line<00:01:45.180> right<00:01:45.540> there<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.079> then<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:46.470> not<00:01:47.009> have

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
line right there and then and not have

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.679 
line right there and then and not have
to<00:01:47.930> ask<00:01:48.930> cassie<00:01:49.560> is<00:01:49.590> for<00:01:49.799> last-minute<00:01:50.100> lines

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:50.689 
to ask cassie is for last-minute lines

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:53.389

with with escalona I knew that that

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.899 
with with escalona I knew that that
wouldn't<00:01:53.759> work<00:01:54.500> because<00:01:55.500> I<00:01:55.740> had<00:01:55.979> so<00:01:56.640> many

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
wouldn't work because I had so many

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.969 
wouldn't work because I had so many
different<00:01:57.780> voice<00:01:58.049> actors<00:01:58.439> I<00:01:58.530> was<00:01:58.649> working

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
with I couldn't count on being able to

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.870 
with I couldn't count on being able to
give<00:02:01.079> every<00:02:01.409> extra<00:02:01.740> little<00:02:01.950> editing<00:02:02.310> line<00:02:02.549> to

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
give every extra little editing line to

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.969 
give every extra little editing line to
one<00:02:03.240> of<00:02:03.329> my<00:02:03.479> characters<00:02:03.540> so<00:02:04.439> I<00:02:04.469> had<00:02:04.680> this<00:02:04.770> idea

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
one of my characters so I had this idea

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.219 
one of my characters so I had this idea
that<00:02:05.430> instead<00:02:06.090> of<00:02:06.210> writing<00:02:06.479> a<00:02:06.630> script<00:02:06.930> what<00:02:07.200> I

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
that instead of writing a script what I

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.779 
that instead of writing a script what I
would<00:02:07.409> do<00:02:07.560> is<00:02:07.710> I<00:02:07.740> go<00:02:07.860> through<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.369> I'd<00:02:08.489> edit

yes have worked I really had to plan
things<00:02:41.430> ahead<00:02:41.850> a<00:02:42.090> lot<00:02:42.570> more<00:02:42.930> than<00:02:43.200> any<00:02:43.350> of<00:02:43.680> my

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
things ahead a lot more than any of my

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.140 
things ahead a lot more than any of my
other<00:02:43.860> stuff<00:02:44.100> to<00:02:44.459> make<00:02:44.580> sure<00:02:44.640> that<00:02:45.000> it<00:02:45.090> would

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
other stuff to make sure that it would

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.449 
other stuff to make sure that it would
make<00:02:45.360> no<00:02:45.390> sense<00:02:45.660> n<00:02:46.140> ginormous<00:02:46.830> packs<00:02:47.190> to<00:02:47.430> the

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.420 
make no sense n ginormous packs to the
ladies<00:02:47.970> so<00:02:48.810> this<00:02:48.989> obviously<00:02:49.530> is<00:02:50.010> the<00:02:50.130> second

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430

the second episode that that's easily my

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.780 
the second episode that that's easily my
favorite<00:03:02.070> part<00:03:02.250> of<00:03:02.310> his<00:03:02.430> first<00:03:02.670> episode<00:03:04.790> but

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
favorite part of his first episode but

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.330 
favorite part of his first episode but
you<00:03:05.940> know<00:03:06.030> I<00:03:06.270> give<00:03:06.630> them<00:03:06.750> crap<00:03:07.050> and<00:03:07.410> Lord<00:03:08.250> knows

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
you know I give them crap and Lord knows

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.479 
you know I give them crap and Lord knows
that<00:03:08.730> their<00:03:08.880> version<00:03:09.180> of<00:03:09.239> escaflowne<00:03:09.720> was<00:03:10.050> the

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
that their version of escaflowne was the

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:13.100 
that their version of escaflowne was the
one<00:03:11.489> of<00:03:11.580> the<00:03:11.670> most<00:03:11.850> notorious<00:03:12.000> hack<00:03:12.660> dubs<00:03:12.959> of

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
one of the most notorious hack dubs of

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:14.780 
one of the most notorious hack dubs of
all<00:03:13.200> time<00:03:13.410> but<00:03:13.830> I<00:03:13.860> do<00:03:13.950> understand<00:03:14.489> skipping

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
all time but I do understand skipping

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.850 
all time but I do understand skipping
the<00:03:14.880> first<00:03:15.060> death<00:03:15.350> because<00:03:16.350> the<00:03:16.530> second

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
the first death because the second

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.890 
the first death because the second
episode<00:03:16.920> is<00:03:17.250> a<00:03:17.340> much<00:03:17.730> better<00:03:17.760> introduction<00:03:20.900> so

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
episode is a much better introduction so

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.240 
episode is a much better introduction so
