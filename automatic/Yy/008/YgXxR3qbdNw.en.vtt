00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:11.500 
I've got this little thing that they sit
in<00:05:10.250> and<00:05:10.460> you<00:05:10.580> can<00:05:10.730> just<00:05:10.760> pull<00:05:11.030> it<00:05:11.060> up<00:05:11.240> with<00:05:11.390> the

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:11.510 
in and you can just pull it up with the

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:14.380 
in and you can just pull it up with the
two<00:05:11.690> handles<00:05:12.170> but<00:05:12.950> if<00:05:13.700> you<00:05:13.850> don't<00:05:14.000> have<00:05:14.180> that

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:14.390 
two handles but if you don't have that

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:15.670 
two handles but if you don't have that
and<00:05:14.570> it's<00:05:14.690> you<00:05:15.020> just<00:05:15.170> have<00:05:15.380> the<00:05:15.470> little<00:05:15.650> thing

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 
and it's you just have the little thing

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.160 
and it's you just have the little thing
that<00:05:15.800> goes<00:05:16.070> on<00:05:16.100> the<00:05:16.340> bottom<00:05:16.610> that's<00:05:16.760> fine<00:05:17.030> too

out<00:05:20.930> of<00:05:21.110> the<00:05:21.170> heat<00:05:21.380> after<00:05:21.920> a<00:05:21.950> few<00:05:22.190> seconds

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:22.700 
out of the heat after a few seconds

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.000 
out of the heat after a few seconds
sometimes<00:05:23.030> it<00:05:23.330> takes<00:05:23.510> a<00:05:23.630> few<00:05:23.660> minutes<00:05:24.010> you'll

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:28.260 
sometimes it takes a few minutes you'll
start<00:05:26.000> to<00:05:26.150> hear<00:05:26.330> the<00:05:26.660> lids<00:05:27.080> pop<00:05:27.260> as<00:05:27.650> it<00:05:27.800> cools
