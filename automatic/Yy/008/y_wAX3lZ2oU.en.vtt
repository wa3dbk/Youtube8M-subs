 transform windows seven to mac osx lion 

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:11.070
 remember that this is only a skin 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.920
 does not mean it really is the mac 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.179
 osx lion as you will see we have many 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.750
 differences 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.970
 one of them we will have the icons here 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:24.300
 another of them we will open and it will be the typical 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.460
 windows menu but well so sight 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.439
 the first thing we have to do is fine 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.060
 do in loading the file that I'm going 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.540

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.670

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.430
 with these files inside what you have 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.579
 what to do here is to select the two 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:48.030
 files and to give you extract in and what 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:50.160
 we extract in a folder excuse 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.539
 and we bring them in a separate folder that 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.539
 we make 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:02.290
