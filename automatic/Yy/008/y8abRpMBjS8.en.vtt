00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:14.440 
video on the Petco SRM 2201 I thought

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.200 
video on the Petco SRM 2201 I thought
I'd<00:00:14.530> do<00:00:14.620> this<00:00:14.799> video<00:00:16.230> running<00:00:17.230> the<00:00:17.710> echo<00:00:18.280> SRM

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:19.210 
I'd do this video running the echo SRM

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:24.720 
I'd do this video running the echo SRM
2400<00:00:20.140> SB<00:00:20.470> and<00:00:20.980> the<00:00:21.369> echo<00:00:21.939> SRM<00:00:22.750> 225<00:00:23.529> at<00:00:24.340> the<00:00:24.550> same

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:24.730 
2400 SB and the echo SRM 225 at the same

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.919 
2400 SB and the echo SRM 225 at the same
time<00:00:24.789> let's<00:00:25.269> see<00:00:25.420> how<00:00:25.570> they<00:00:26.230> both<00:00:26.410> sound<00:00:26.710> like

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:27.929 
time let's see how they both sound like

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:32.310 
time let's see how they both sound like
okay

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:32.320 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.090 

here's<00:00:33.320> the<00:00:33.559> echo<00:00:34.660> SRM<00:00:35.660> 2400<00:00:36.649> a<00:00:36.710> sweet<00:00:36.920> let's

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
here's the echo SRM 2400 a sweet let's

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.680 
here's the echo SRM 2400 a sweet let's
see<00:00:37.160> if<00:00:37.219> I<00:00:37.280> can<00:00:37.430> pull<00:00:37.640> it<00:00:37.850> while<00:00:38.329> holding<00:00:38.570> the

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
see if I can pull it while holding the

00:00:38.690 --> 00:01:01.120 
see if I can pull it while holding the
camera<00:00:38.989> if<00:00:39.500> I<00:00:39.620> can

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:01.130 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:33.220 

why<00:01:01.670> they<00:01:01.850> sure<00:01:02.030> sound<00:01:02.270> good<00:01:02.510> together

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:33.230 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:37.150 

as<00:01:34.070> you<00:01:34.280> can<00:01:34.400> hear<00:01:34.990> this<00:01:35.990> one<00:01:36.290> revs<00:01:36.920> at<00:01:37.130> a

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:37.160 
as you can hear this one revs at a

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.320 
as you can hear this one revs at a
higher<00:01:37.400> rpm<00:01:38.000> because<00:01:38.390> it<00:01:38.720> has<00:01:39.020> a<00:01:39.910> 23.6<00:01:40.910> cc

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
higher rpm because it has a 23.6 cc

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.310 
higher rpm because it has a 23.6 cc
engine<00:01:41.890> that<00:01:42.890> one<00:01:43.130> has<00:01:43.370> a<00:01:43.630> 21-point<00:01:44.630> 2<00:01:44.810> cc

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
engine that one has a 21-point 2 cc

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.210 
engine that one has a 21-point 2 cc
engine

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.060 

actually<00:01:49.030> both<00:01:49.150> sounds<00:01:49.540> pretty<00:01:49.720> good

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
actually both sounds pretty good

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.950 
actually both sounds pretty good
together<00:01:51.070> this<00:01:51.730> one<00:01:51.910> obviously<00:01:52.210> is<00:01:52.540> a<00:01:52.780> bit

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
together this one obviously is a bit

00:01:52.960 --> 00:02:00.780 
together this one obviously is a bit
louder<00:01:53.320> than<00:01:54.100> that<00:01:54.340> one

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.920 

I'm<00:02:01.790> going<00:02:02.120> to<00:02:02.240> read<00:02:02.900> the<00:02:03.080> boat<00:02:03.290> at<00:02:03.500> same<00:02:03.800> time

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
I'm going to read the boat at same time

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:18.280 
I'm going to read the boat at same time
