00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.870 
one of this but I'll show you what it
looks<00:01:28.409> like<00:01:28.680> it<00:01:28.890> doesn't<00:01:29.040> really<00:01:29.310> look<00:01:29.579> any

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
looks like it doesn't really look any

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.609 
looks like it doesn't really look any
different<00:01:30.210> than<00:01:30.479> like<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:30.689> lotion<00:01:31.020> so<00:01:31.500> I<00:01:31.560> guess

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619

that's what it smells like to me I've

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:33.249 
that's what it smells like to me I've
never<00:05:31.699> used<00:05:32.000> one<00:05:32.180> of<00:05:32.360> their<00:05:32.479> massage<00:05:32.779> bars<00:05:33.080> and

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:33.259 
never used one of their massage bars and

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:35.740 
never used one of their massage bars and
obviously<00:05:33.620> they<00:05:33.800> can<00:05:33.949> be<00:05:34.099> used<00:05:34.669> for<00:05:35.000> what<00:05:35.599> the

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:35.750 
obviously they can be used for what the

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:37.330 
obviously they can be used for what the
name<00:05:35.930> is<00:05:36.080> for<00:05:36.289> for<00:05:36.560> massages<00:05:37.039> because<00:05:37.159> they

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:37.340 
name is for for massages because they

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.339 
name is for for massages because they
melt<00:05:37.550> into<00:05:37.729> the<00:05:37.849> skin<00:05:37.940> really<00:05:38.330> easily<00:05:38.779> but

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:39.349 
melt into the skin really easily but

00:05:39.349 --> 00:05:41.709 
melt into the skin really easily but
also<00:05:39.560> I<00:05:39.800> think<00:05:40.069> it's<00:05:40.460> supposed<00:05:40.610> to<00:05:40.909> be<00:05:41.120> like

00:05:41.709 --> 00:05:41.719 
also I think it's supposed to be like

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:43.899 
also I think it's supposed to be like
really<00:05:42.199> moisturizing<00:05:42.949> for<00:05:43.129> the<00:05:43.219> skin<00:05:43.490> even<00:05:43.669> to

00:05:43.899 --> 00:05:43.909 
really moisturizing for the skin even to

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:45.909 
really moisturizing for the skin even to
just<00:05:43.940> kind<00:05:44.330> of<00:05:44.389> like<00:05:44.599> rub<00:05:44.960> into<00:05:45.229> your<00:05:45.440> skin<00:05:45.740> as
