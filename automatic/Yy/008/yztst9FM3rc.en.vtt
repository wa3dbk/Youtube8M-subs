00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.500
 skip this part 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.659
 mortal kombat versus the universe of the 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.759
 story of this game is based between the 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.189
 Facts of Deadly Kombat 2 and Deadly 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.650
 kombat 3 where after beating xiao 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.810
 can ride in it was to look after 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.329
 a conversation raiden throws a 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.460
 download xiao kan by launching it to the portal 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.590
 causing a kind of fusion then 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.680
 soucan disappears with the portal 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.600
 at the same time superman was fighting 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.909
 with dark side and he throws it with a whore 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.979
 with his laser beam to a similar portal 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.350
 to shao kahn causing the merger of 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.869
 the two worlds 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.090
 after a series of fight events 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:04.549
 between the DC and deadly 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.350
 Kombat finally reach the final place 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:08.119
 of the game all the characters and 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.280
 begins a war with each other 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.959
 nevertheless raiden and superman recover 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.060
 sanity and they're going to look for dark and 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:14.600
 after they were forced to fight 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.760
 each 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.880
 raiden and superman face dark 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.980
 and finally defeating him at the end 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.900
 when everything returns to normal dark 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.900
 side appears in the universe of mortal 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.030
 kombat where he is punished by raiden and 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.130
 at the same time ya or kan appears in the 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.330
 world of edf and superman encloses it in 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.330
 a kind of crystal 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:42.100
 very well floor block 0040 continue you 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.230
 in agreement lives a christ hehehehe is 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.720
 curious that after working with me 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.870
 in a video help you now to make one 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:53.680
 yours very well we continue with our 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:58.030
 analysis the characters in this game 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:02.500
 are you can scorpion sub-zero ride in 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:05.740
 kano baraka samsung jacks sonia remove 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:09.100
 superman batman woman wonder flash 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:13.350
 green lantern captain marvel lex luthor 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:15.010
 catch her dead stroke that the bosses are 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:18.190
 dark side 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:20.410
 shao kahn dark and before you had 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.810
 planned that what if it were downloaded 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.840
 to play with him but they decided 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:29.800
 that better not good now let's analyze the 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:32.290
 game history because history to 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.180
 I thought it was a bit silly at first 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.400
 it was very unlikely that I would raid him 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.709
 will launch shao kahn to a portal with a 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.810
 download while superman was throwing to 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:44.239
 dark side to a portal with its laser beam 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.520
 but if we leave aside that the 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:48.560
 story is good and entertaining as 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:51.050
 the stories of both universes is 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.880
 interlaced which means that we will see 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:56.090
 that to a character while 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:58.880
 other characters did their things the 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:01.099
 final was somewhat cliche but it was acceptable 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.080
 and I thought it was funny when he got 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:08.150
 asia superman or crystal channel in the 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:10.370
 space graphics good graphics 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:13.010
 they are really great and that is the 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:17.510
 first game of mortal kombat on ps3 and 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:20.450
 the xbox 360 are really great 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:22.820
 fresh and very realistic since now 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:26.240
 measure you hit the enemy your clothes will 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:29.419
 tears and shock are very well 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:31.520
 soundtrack because the soundtrack is 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:33.950
 well to my personal opinion every place 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.620
 It has its soundtrack and the truth is 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:39.040
 very good the best ones in my opinion are 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:41.110
 those of the superheroes 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:44.680
 fatalities and brutalities 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:47.110
 heroic good the fatalities is what 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.810
 it surprised more people because in 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:52.270
 this game the fatalities are simple and 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:54.700
 not much blood comes out that displeased 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:56.980
 many people since a game of 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:59.230
 mortal kombat is not a deadly kombat without 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:01.720
 good fatalities but I do not 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:04.060
 it bothered a lot more like in this game 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:06.400
 deadly kombat came out superheroes 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:08.470
 they could not kill them because it would be something 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.780
 traumatic for young children who 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.790
 have played the game because I do not 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.890
 lie I know that you have played 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:18.340
 mortal kombat not yet having the age 

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:20.950
 required anyway are acceptable 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:23.260
 to my opinion now about the 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:25.180
 heroic brutalities for they are so 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:27.490
 violent as the brutalities of 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:29.920
 mortal kombat 3 but without the fact 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:32.050
 explode the enemy not successes but 

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:34.150
 some if I saw them more as fatality than 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:36.430
 as brutality for example the 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:38.980
 brutalities of green lantern is something 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:41.410
 painful for my opinion 

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:45.580
 very good gonzalo what in there or 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:48.820
 continue your thanks were the 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:51.010
 scenarios for the truth the scenarios 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:52.900
 They are active and interactive since 

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:55.540
 while we play we will move some 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:57.520
 things around him and sometimes we can 

00:05:55.540 --> 00:06:01.870
 interact with him to be able to do more 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:04.090
 damage to the combat style opponent 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:06.940
 in this game we can see that there are several 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:09.010
 styles the classic style of fight one 

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:11.380
 that is called closed combat and one that 

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:14.860
 it's called free fall combat and some 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:16.590
 more all these are pretty good for 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:19.740
 my opinion 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:21.780
 gameplay for my opinion is 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:24.390
 better than that of mortal kombat armageddon 

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:26.670
 At first it took me a bit to adapt 

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:29.280
 but then it was very easy to be able to 

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:33.510
 handle the characters well and use 

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:36.090
 several of his powers live a christ I 

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:39.000
 you allow me and I already block block of 20 

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:41.490
 40 summarize this game of course 

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:45.030

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:47.360

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:55.560
 soundtrack a small variety of 

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:58.590
 characters an acceptable online mode 

00:06:55.560 --> 00:07:01.380
 a good story a good gameplay 

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:04.800
 good fighting styles fatalities and 

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:08.810
 good brutalities this game takes 

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:08.810
 a deserved 9.3 out of 10 

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:14.699
 very well now what many expect the 

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:17.069
 asks what will be the two characters 

00:07:14.699 --> 00:07:20.009
 that they would be downloadable for mortal 

00:07:17.069 --> 00:07:22.110
 kombat vs. dc universe good 

00:07:20.009 --> 00:07:23.699
 friends I hope you liked this 

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:25.949
 video until next time 

00:07:23.699 --> 00:07:27.870
 today I hope that in 2 040 I found a 

00:07:25.949 --> 00:07:31.169
 device that turns you into a little pony 

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:33.980
 look I'll show you how it works away that 

00:07:31.169 --> 00:07:36.500

 grabbed horse kicks is fine 

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:48.140
 but I will stay like it puts a while 

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:50.690
 all this transformation alone 

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:53.210
 It lasts 30 minutes so you just have to 

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:55.280
 wait a while is fine while 

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:58.730
 I hope you got kicked by 

00:07:55.280 --> 00:08:00.260
 transform without my permission or get away 

00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:02.500
 from my 

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.500
 make
