to come back every hour and take a video

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.250 
to come back every hour and take a video
but<00:02:31.500> I've<00:02:32.100> been<00:02:32.250> doing<00:02:32.490> pitches<00:02:32.959> but<00:02:33.959> that

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
but I've been doing pitches but that

but I've been doing pitches but that
would<00:02:34.410> be<00:02:34.560> a<00:02:34.590> pain<00:02:34.800> in<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.070> butt<00:02:35.280> once<00:02:35.910> I<00:02:36.030> start

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
would be a pain in the butt once I start

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.760 
would be a pain in the butt once I start
getting<00:02:36.450> involved<00:02:36.810> with<00:02:37.050> something<00:02:37.440> I<00:02:37.560> lose

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
parts and these buckets you know I got

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.580 
parts and these buckets you know I got
the<00:02:52.220> valve<00:02:53.220> covers<00:02:53.670> off<00:02:53.850> the<00:02:54.690> fuel<00:02:54.989> injectors

I got the air intake the throttle body
off<00:02:59.390> you<00:03:00.390> can<00:03:00.540> see<00:03:00.750> the<00:03:00.900> cams<00:03:01.200> this<00:03:02.160> motor<00:03:02.459> is

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
off you can see the cams this motor is

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.800 
off you can see the cams this motor is
like<00:03:03.170> extremely<00:03:04.170> clean<00:03:05.090> it's<00:03:06.090> always<00:03:06.330> got<00:03:06.510> oil

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
changes I don't know why the timing

changes I don't know why the timing
chain<00:03:10.400> guides<00:03:11.400> broke<00:03:11.850> but<00:03:12.180> is<00:03:12.480> a<00:03:12.540> timing<00:03:12.870> chain

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
chain guides broke but is a timing chain

chain guides broke but is a timing chain
I<00:03:14.510> don't<00:03:15.510> know<00:03:15.600> if<00:03:15.690> you<00:03:15.780> can<00:03:15.989> see<00:03:16.200> that<00:03:16.880> but<00:03:17.880> it

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
I don't know if you can see that but it

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.300 
I don't know if you can see that but it
almost<00:03:18.810> comes<00:03:19.110> right<00:03:19.380> off<00:03:19.410> the<00:03:19.739> cam<00:03:20.010> which

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
almost comes right off the cam which

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.340 
almost comes right off the cam which
didn't<00:03:21.090> do<00:03:21.150> any<00:03:21.329> serious<00:03:21.510> damage<00:03:21.870> to<00:03:22.260> the

the guide I broke free the exhaust for
now<00:03:32.880> I<00:03:33.620> probably<00:03:34.620> can't<00:03:34.950> see<00:03:35.160> in<00:03:35.310> there

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
now I probably can't see in there

starting to get dark out the tensioner

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.560 
starting to get dark out the tensioner
that<00:03:40.920> I<00:03:40.950> replaced<00:03:41.549> I'll<00:03:41.790> be<00:03:41.910> taking<00:03:42.209> that<00:03:42.239> back

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
that I replaced I'll be taking that back

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.930 
that I replaced I'll be taking that back
out<00:03:42.810> because<00:03:43.049> it's<00:03:43.230> new<00:03:43.470> and<00:03:43.739> if<00:03:44.700> you<00:03:44.790> look

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
out because it's new and if you look

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.750 
out because it's new and if you look
over<00:03:45.090> here<00:03:45.720> I<00:03:45.900> love<00:03:46.650> forward<00:03:47.070> to<00:03:47.160> death<00:03:47.400> but

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
over here I love forward to death but

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.620 
over here I love forward to death but
for<00:03:47.970> the<00:03:48.690> timing<00:03:49.140> chain<00:03:49.170> of<00:03:49.530> the<00:03:49.620> front<00:03:49.890> -<00:03:50.630> just

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
for the timing chain of the front - just

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.110 
for the timing chain of the front - just
like<00:03:51.780> the<00:03:51.900> one<00:03:51.930> in<00:03:52.200> the<00:03:52.290> back<00:03:52.500> and<00:03:52.799> that's<00:03:53.790> why

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
like the one in the back and that's why

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.509 
like the one in the back and that's why
it's<00:03:54.750> a<00:03:54.870> motor<00:03:55.110> job<00:03:55.410> just<00:03:55.739> to<00:03:55.829> get<00:03:55.980> that<00:03:56.130> timing

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
it's a motor job just to get that timing

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:58.370 
it's a motor job just to get that timing
chain<00:03:56.700> out<00:03:56.880> the<00:03:57.000> back<00:03:57.209> why<00:03:57.510> it<00:03:57.570> broke<00:03:57.930> I<00:03:58.200> don't

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
chain out the back why it broke I don't

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.319 
chain out the back why it broke I don't
know<00:03:58.560> it's<00:03:59.280> only<00:03:59.400> got<00:03:59.579> a<00:03:59.610> hundred<00:03:59.760> thousand

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:00.329 
know it's only got a hundred thousand

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:01.210 
know it's only got a hundred thousand
miles

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
miles

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.699 
miles
there's<00:04:02.220> the<00:04:02.430> tensioner<00:04:03.230> it<00:04:04.230> puts<00:04:04.500> pressure

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
there's the tensioner it puts pressure

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:07.670 
there's the tensioner it puts pressure
on<00:04:05.070> these<00:04:05.220> plastic<00:04:05.790> nylon<00:04:06.150> guides<00:04:06.690> put<00:04:07.590> in

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
on these plastic nylon guides put in

on these plastic nylon guides put in
tension<00:04:08.130> on<00:04:08.280> the<00:04:08.720> diamond<00:04:09.720> chain<00:04:09.930> this<00:04:10.230> one's

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
tension on the diamond chain this one's

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.080 
tension on the diamond chain this one's
not<00:04:10.620> broken<00:04:11.780> but<00:04:12.950> to<00:04:13.950> repair<00:04:14.340> the<00:04:14.519> rear<00:04:14.790> one

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
not broken but to repair the rear one

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.909 
not broken but to repair the rear one
like<00:04:15.480> the<00:04:15.660> shop<00:04:15.900> wanted<00:04:16.320> to<00:04:16.380> do<00:04:16.530> for<00:04:16.769> three

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
like the shop wanted to do for three

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:20.509 
like the shop wanted to do for three
grand<00:04:17.340> and<00:04:18.049> not<00:04:19.049> to<00:04:19.229> do<00:04:19.410> these<00:04:19.680> was<00:04:20.130> kind<00:04:20.400> of

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
grand and not to do these was kind of

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:21.729 
grand and not to do these was kind of
stupid<00:04:21.000> because

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
stupid because

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.400 
stupid because
those<00:04:22.070> will<00:04:22.280> break<00:04:22.580> next<00:04:23.060> you<00:04:23.960> know<00:04:24.080> might

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.410 
those will break next you know might

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.730 
those will break next you know might
might<00:04:24.740> as<00:04:24.860> well<00:04:24.979> do<00:04:25.220> the<00:04:25.370> whole<00:04:25.520> thing<00:04:25.720> I<00:04:26.740> don't

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
might as well do the whole thing I don't

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.350 
might as well do the whole thing I don't
think<00:04:28.009> I'm<00:04:28.160> going<00:04:28.310> to<00:04:28.400> do<00:04:28.490> the<00:04:28.610> chains<00:04:28.910> yet<00:04:29.240> I'm

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
think I'm going to do the chains yet I'm

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.779 
think I'm going to do the chains yet I'm
still<00:04:29.479> thinking<00:04:29.930> about<00:04:29.990> it<00:04:30.199> I<00:04:30.560> broke<00:04:31.310> free<00:04:31.520> the

00:04:31.779 --> 00:04:31.789 
still thinking about it I broke free the

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:35.560 
still thinking about it I broke free the
exhaust<00:04:32.180> on<00:04:32.479> this<00:04:32.600> side<00:04:33.610> I<00:04:34.610> still<00:04:35.270> have<00:04:35.419> some

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:35.570 
exhaust on this side I still have some

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.990 
exhaust on this side I still have some
components<00:04:36.169> in<00:04:36.199> the<00:04:36.320> front<00:04:36.620> this<00:04:37.550> thing<00:04:37.789> has

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
components in the front this thing has

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.170 
components in the front this thing has
three<00:04:38.330> radiators<00:04:39.220> one<00:04:40.220> for<00:04:40.430> antifreeze<00:04:40.699> one

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
three radiators one for antifreeze one

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.520 
three radiators one for antifreeze one
for<00:04:41.389> tranny<00:04:41.630> fluid<00:04:41.840> one<00:04:42.199> for<00:04:42.440> air

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:42.530 
for tranny fluid one for air

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:44.800 
for tranny fluid one for air
conditioning<00:04:43.130> so<00:04:43.850> I<00:04:43.880> got<00:04:44.210> to<00:04:44.300> try<00:04:44.449> to<00:04:44.479> split

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
conditioning so I got to try to split

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.150 
conditioning so I got to try to split
them<00:04:44.960> apart<00:04:45.020> I<00:04:45.410> don't<00:04:45.560> want<00:04:45.680> to<00:04:45.740> break<00:04:45.949> up<00:04:45.979> the

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 
them apart I don't want to break up the

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.810 
them apart I don't want to break up the
a/c<00:04:47.590> the<00:04:48.590> tranny<00:04:48.889> fluid<00:04:49.100> I'm<00:04:49.400> not<00:04:49.550> worried

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 
a/c the tranny fluid I'm not worried

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.620 
a/c the tranny fluid I'm not worried
about<00:04:49.940> and<00:04:50.509> the<00:04:50.930> antifreeze<00:04:51.380> is<00:04:51.530> all<00:04:51.680> drained

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:52.630 
about and the antifreeze is all drained

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.159 
about and the antifreeze is all drained

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:00.380 
that's the power steering pump so I got

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.700 
that's the power steering pump so I got
to<00:05:00.470> get<00:05:00.560> to<00:05:00.620> that<00:05:01.330> but<00:05:02.330> this<00:05:02.870> was<00:05:03.110> one<00:05:03.320> day's

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:03.710 
to get to that but this was one day's

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.120 
to get to that but this was one day's

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:19.490 
there's a total of 16 just on that

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.219 
there's a total of 16 just on that
Highness<00:05:19.940> and<00:05:20.150> I<00:05:20.240> still<00:05:20.479> have<00:05:20.599> to<00:05:20.720> get<00:05:20.810> behind

00:05:21.219 --> 00:05:21.229 
Highness and I still have to get behind

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:22.450 
Highness and I still have to get behind
the<00:05:21.320> motor<00:05:21.560> and<00:05:21.770> do<00:05:21.889> the<00:05:22.009> ones<00:05:22.190> for<00:05:22.400> the

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:22.460 
the motor and do the ones for the

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:25.960 
the motor and do the ones for the
transmission<00:05:22.970> but<00:05:24.340> so<00:05:25.340> I<00:05:25.370> still<00:05:25.669> got<00:05:25.849> the

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:25.970 
transmission but so I still got the

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:28.210 
transmission but so I still got the
motor<00:05:26.150> mounts<00:05:26.539> to<00:05:26.659> do<00:05:27.039> I'm<00:05:28.039> going<00:05:28.159> to

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:28.220 
motor mounts to do I'm going to

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:29.950 
motor mounts to do I'm going to
disconnect<00:05:28.639> the<00:05:28.789> manifolds<00:05:29.360> completely<00:05:29.780> from

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:29.960 
disconnect the manifolds completely from

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.439 
disconnect the manifolds completely from
the<00:05:30.080> exhaust<00:05:30.550> those<00:05:31.550> might<00:05:31.849> be<00:05:31.880> going<00:05:32.270> on

00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:32.449 
the exhaust those might be going on

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:34.870 
the exhaust those might be going on
before<00:05:33.409> the<00:05:33.590> motor<00:05:33.860> goes<00:05:34.070> back<00:05:34.310> in<00:05:34.580> and<00:05:34.820> it

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:34.880 
before the motor goes back in and it

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.149 
before the motor goes back in and it
might<00:05:35.030> do<00:05:35.150> the<00:05:35.180> throttle<00:05:35.690> body<00:05:35.810> a<00:05:36.110> few<00:05:36.889> things

00:05:37.149 --> 00:05:37.159 
might do the throttle body a few things

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:40.480 
might do the throttle body a few things
I'm<00:05:37.340> taking<00:05:37.699> off<00:05:37.849> just<00:05:37.880> to<00:05:38.740> keep<00:05:39.740> up<00:05:39.949> time<00:05:40.220> here

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:40.490 
I'm taking off just to keep up time here

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:41.800 
I'm taking off just to keep up time here
because<00:05:40.669> I<00:05:40.789> got<00:05:40.909> to<00:05:41.030> put<00:05:41.150> it<00:05:41.240> on<00:05:41.300> a<00:05:41.360> new<00:05:41.599> motor

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:41.810 
because I got to put it on a new motor

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:43.689 
because I got to put it on a new motor
from<00:05:42.139> a<00:05:42.229> dual<00:05:42.440> motor<00:05:42.710> they<00:05:43.099> have<00:05:43.250> to<00:05:43.400> come<00:05:43.550> off

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:43.699 
from a dual motor they have to come off

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:46.750 
from a dual motor they have to come off
anyways<00:05:44.650> the<00:05:45.650> reason<00:05:45.919> for<00:05:46.039> the<00:05:46.130> rear<00:05:46.310> timing

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:46.760 
anyways the reason for the rear timing

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.610 
anyways the reason for the rear timing
chain<00:05:47.000> is<00:05:47.240> there's<00:05:47.479> two<00:05:47.659> bolts<00:05:47.870> underneath

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:48.620 
chain is there's two bolts underneath

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:50.710 
chain is there's two bolts underneath
the<00:05:48.740> transmission<00:05:48.979> they<00:05:49.880> have<00:05:50.150> to<00:05:50.300> take<00:05:50.509> out

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:50.720 
the transmission they have to take out

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.149 
the transmission they have to take out
one<00:05:50.990> of<00:05:51.020> them<00:05:51.229> is<00:05:51.320> where<00:05:51.470> the<00:05:51.590> guide<00:05:51.770> broke

00:05:52.149 --> 00:05:52.159 
one of them is where the guide broke

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:53.589 
one of them is where the guide broke
right<00:05:53.090> there

00:05:53.589 --> 00:05:53.599 
right there

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:57.070 
right there
that<00:05:54.199> one's<00:05:54.409> easy<00:05:54.620> but<00:05:54.919> this<00:05:55.009> to<00:05:55.220> others<00:05:55.550> so<00:05:56.080> to

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:57.080 
that one's easy but this to others so to

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.659 
that one's easy but this to others so to
split<00:05:57.380> the<00:05:57.500> motor<00:05:57.680> apart<00:05:58.039> none<00:05:58.310> plus<00:05:58.520> you're

00:05:58.659 --> 00:05:58.669 
split the motor apart none plus you're

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:02.200 
split the motor apart none plus you're
going<00:05:58.759> to<00:05:58.849> take<00:05:59.000> that<00:05:59.150> head<00:05:59.389> off<00:06:00.849> you<00:06:01.849> know<00:06:01.970> so

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:02.210 
going to take that head off you know so

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:03.790 
going to take that head off you know so
now<00:06:02.330> you're<00:06:02.509> into<00:06:02.690> a<00:06:02.750> head<00:06:02.990> gasket<00:06:03.199> and

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:03.800 
now you're into a head gasket and

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.820 
now you're into a head gasket and
everything<00:06:04.250> you<00:06:04.370> got<00:06:04.460> to<00:06:04.580> take<00:06:04.729> this<00:06:04.909> head<00:06:05.150> off

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:05.830 
everything you got to take this head off

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:09.219 
everything you got to take this head off
to<00:06:06.830> pull<00:06:07.310> the<00:06:07.460> timing<00:06:07.880> chain<00:06:07.909> out<00:06:08.330> on<00:06:08.810> the<00:06:09.020> back

00:06:09.219 --> 00:06:09.229 
to pull the timing chain out on the back

00:06:09.229 --> 00:06:11.409 
to pull the timing chain out on the back
so<00:06:09.530> you're<00:06:10.400> pretty<00:06:10.580> much<00:06:10.789> rebuilding<00:06:11.360> the

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:11.419 
so you're pretty much rebuilding the

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:13.810 
so you're pretty much rebuilding the
whole<00:06:11.509> motor
