then I took the bar off the back and my
own<00:01:25.930> just<00:01:26.140> a<00:01:26.230> piece<00:01:26.380> of<00:01:26.530> wood<00:01:26.650> to<00:01:26.710> it<00:01:26.950> so<00:01:27.070> I<00:01:27.100> can

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
own just a piece of wood to it so I can

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.280 
own just a piece of wood to it so I can
clamp<00:01:27.520> it<00:01:27.640> down<00:01:27.700> it's<00:01:28.510> got<00:01:28.630> a<00:01:28.660> little<00:01:28.840> simple

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290 
clamp it down it's got a little simple

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.230 
clamp it down it's got a little simple
seat<00:01:29.470> clamp<00:01:29.740> there<00:01:30.070> that<00:01:30.610> holds<00:01:30.850> it<00:01:30.940> in<00:01:31.030> place

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
seat clamp there that holds it in place

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.830 
seat clamp there that holds it in place
and<00:01:31.630> then<00:01:32.320> the<00:01:32.470> other<00:01:32.590> two<00:01:32.830> front<00:01:33.100> legs<00:01:33.310> have

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
and then the other two front legs have

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.720 
and then the other two front legs have
rubber<00:01:34.840> stoppers<00:01:35.350> that<00:01:35.380> hold<00:01:36.010> it<00:01:36.130> in<00:01:36.220> place<00:01:36.370> so

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:36.730 
rubber stoppers that hold it in place so

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:38.430 
rubber stoppers that hold it in place so
basically<00:01:37.600> I<00:01:37.720> can<00:01:37.750> get<00:01:37.960> on<00:01:38.050> there<00:01:38.200> and<00:01:38.230> I<00:01:38.350> can

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 
basically I can get on there and I can

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.200 
basically I can get on there and I can
pedal<00:01:38.680> for<00:01:38.830> 15-20<00:01:39.490> minutes<00:01:39.790> 25<00:01:40.180> minutes

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
just like on a regular bicycle I focus

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.100 
just like on a regular bicycle I focus
on<00:02:04.480> the<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:06.130> forward<00:02:06.640> and<00:02:06.940> down<00:02:07.270> motion<00:02:07.900> I

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
on the the forward and down motion I

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.200 
on the the forward and down motion I
can't<00:02:08.979> pull<00:02:09.220> back<00:02:09.429> because<00:02:09.610> my<00:02:09.820> hands<00:02:10.030> don't

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.210 
can't pull back because my hands don't

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:12.180 
can't pull back because my hands don't
work<00:02:10.450> so<00:02:10.690> you<00:02:10.750> can't<00:02:11.050> pull<00:02:11.260> back<00:02:11.290> so<00:02:12.040> then

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
work so you can't pull back so then

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.890 
work so you can't pull back so then
you're<00:02:12.340> pushing<00:02:12.760> forward<00:02:13.120> and<00:02:13.390> down<00:02:13.570> with<00:02:13.810> the

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
you're pushing forward and down with the

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.500 
you're pushing forward and down with the
right<00:02:14.080> hand<00:02:14.320> and<00:02:15.250> then<00:02:15.490> you<00:02:15.610> push<00:02:15.880> forward<00:02:16.270> and

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
right hand and then you push forward and

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.110 
right hand and then you push forward and
down<00:02:16.690> with<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:16.960> left<00:02:17.170> hand<00:02:17.760> and<00:02:18.760> when<00:02:18.880> you<00:02:18.970> do

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
down with the left hand and when you do
