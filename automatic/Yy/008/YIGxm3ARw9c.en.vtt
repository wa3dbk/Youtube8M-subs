just going to be slightly smaller

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.439 
just going to be slightly smaller
because<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.489> angle<00:00:56.610> you're<00:00:56.910> looking<00:00:57.180> at<00:00:57.300> in

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:15.480 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.850 

okay<00:01:16.480> when<00:01:16.660> we<00:01:16.720> start<00:01:17.020> with<00:01:17.140> the<00:01:17.170> face<00:01:17.380> detail

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
okay when we start with the face detail

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.590 
okay when we start with the face detail
we'll<00:01:18.250> start<00:01:18.700> with<00:01:18.820> the<00:01:18.940> eyes<00:01:19.060> I<00:01:19.240> need<00:01:19.390> to<00:01:19.480> be

we'll start with the eyes I need to be

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.280 
we'll start with the eyes I need to be
drawn<00:01:19.810> about<00:01:20.050> here<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:21.700> sort<00:01:22.000> of<00:01:22.290> oblong

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
drawn about here to sort of oblong

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.500 
drawn about here to sort of oblong
bulges<00:01:26.040> one<00:01:27.040> them<00:01:27.220> sticks<00:01:27.580> out<00:01:27.820> the<00:01:28.300> head

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:28.510 
bulges one them sticks out the head

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.640 
bulges one them sticks out the head
slightly<00:01:28.810> to<00:01:29.170> create<00:01:29.710> the<00:01:29.830> 3d<00:01:30.280> effect<00:01:31.650> and

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:32.650 
slightly to create the 3d effect and

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:44.310 
slightly to create the 3d effect and
then<00:01:33.640> his<00:01:33.880> mouth

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:50.169 

into<00:01:45.320> his<00:01:45.439> body<00:01:47.649> so<00:01:48.649> sketching<00:01:49.579> the<00:01:49.670> tongue<00:01:49.909> as

00:01:50.169 --> 00:01:50.179 
into his body so sketching the tongue as

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:53.240 
into his body so sketching the tongue as
well

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.880 

so<00:01:53.880> these<00:01:53.970> are<00:01:54.030> as<00:01:54.210> pupils<00:01:56.870> it's<00:01:57.870> got<00:01:58.080> to<00:01:58.470> quite

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
so these are as pupils it's got to quite

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.880 
so these are as pupils it's got to quite
thick<00:01:59.760> eyebrows

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.630 

we<00:02:05.280> draw<00:02:05.520> his<00:02:05.790> shorts<00:02:06.270> in<00:02:06.479> shorts<00:02:07.140> off<00:02:07.640> over

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
we draw his shorts in shorts off over

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:15.220 
we draw his shorts in shorts off over
half<00:02:08.759> way<00:02:09.030> down<00:02:09.240> the<00:02:09.319> belly<00:02:13.040> light<00:02:14.040> at<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.250> end

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
half way down the belly light at the end

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.990 
half way down the belly light at the end
so<00:02:16.230> in<00:02:16.380> just<00:02:16.530> a<00:02:16.680> second<00:02:17.100> line<00:02:17.280> here<00:02:17.580> this

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
so in just a second line here this

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.190 
so in just a second line here this
represents<00:02:18.260> the<00:02:19.260> band<00:02:19.530> of<00:02:19.740> his<00:02:19.860> shorts<00:02:24.200> shorts

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
represents the band of his shorts shorts

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:31.440 
represents the band of his shorts shorts
stick<00:02:25.709> up<00:02:25.890> for<00:02:26.100> his<00:02:26.220> legs

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.170 

this<00:02:32.050> line<00:02:32.290> goes<00:02:32.530> all<00:02:32.560> the<00:02:32.739> way<00:02:32.950> around

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
this line goes all the way around

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.580 
this line goes all the way around
because<00:02:34.180> this<00:02:34.330> leg<00:02:34.540> is<00:02:34.569> tucked<00:02:34.930> behind<00:02:35.110> it

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
because this leg is tucked behind it

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:44.430 
because this leg is tucked behind it
goes<00:02:35.769> so<00:02:36.250> underneath<00:02:36.610> this<00:02:36.910> line<00:02:43.440> when

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
goes so underneath this line when

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.740 
goes so underneath this line when
there's<00:02:44.590> just<00:02:44.739> a<00:02:44.830> little<00:02:45.160> bit<00:02:45.310> bigger<00:02:48.750> then

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
there's just a little bit bigger then

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.330 
there's just a little bit bigger then
there's<00:02:50.050> a<00:02:50.170> belly<00:02:50.410> button<00:02:50.590> and<00:02:50.890> then

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
there's a belly button and then

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.100 
there's a belly button and then
basically<00:02:51.550> we<00:02:52.090> just<00:02:52.120> go<00:02:52.420> over<00:02:52.569> the<00:02:52.780> lines<00:02:52.870> a

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
basically we just go over the lines a

00:02:53.110 --> 00:03:06.990 
basically we just go over the lines a
little<00:02:53.140> bit<00:02:53.380> harder

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.369 

he's<00:03:08.000> actually<00:03:08.180> got<00:03:08.450> slight<00:03:08.720> patterns<00:03:09.140> on<00:03:09.260> his

00:03:09.369 --> 00:03:09.379 
he's actually got slight patterns on his

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:11.710 
he's actually got slight patterns on his
shorts<00:03:09.769> as<00:03:09.890> well<00:03:10.069> so<00:03:11.030> you<00:03:11.120> can<00:03:11.269> kind<00:03:11.480> of<00:03:11.569> draw

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
shorts as well so you can kind of draw

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.899 
shorts as well so you can kind of draw
that<00:03:11.900> in<00:03:12.080> lightly<00:03:12.769> I<00:03:12.950> think<00:03:13.220> they're<00:03:13.400> coral

00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:13.909 
that in lightly I think they're coral

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:19.210 
that in lightly I think they're coral
reefs<00:03:14.150> or<00:03:14.450> something<00:03:17.650> but<00:03:18.650> it<00:03:18.739> adds<00:03:18.890> to<00:03:19.129> the

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
reefs or something but it adds to the

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.000 
reefs or something but it adds to the
effect

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.610 

so<00:03:23.010> all<00:03:23.610> the<00:03:23.760> black<00:03:23.970> bits<00:03:24.180> you<00:03:24.480> color<00:03:24.959> in<00:03:25.170> which

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
so all the black bits you color in which

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.729 
so all the black bits you color in which
this<00:03:26.010> case<00:03:26.310> will<00:03:26.489> be<00:03:27.230> the<00:03:28.230> inside<00:03:28.560> of<00:03:28.590> his

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
this case will be the inside of his

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:39.210 
this case will be the inside of his
mouth

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.700 

and<00:03:39.490> the<00:03:40.150> patterns<00:03:40.690> on<00:03:40.810> his<00:03:40.930> shorts<00:03:41.320> too<00:03:41.470> dark

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:41.710 
and the patterns on his shorts too dark

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:52.230 
and the patterns on his shorts too dark
enough<00:03:41.950> to<00:03:42.160> cover<00:03:42.340> in<00:03:42.550> lightly<00:03:42.790> as<00:03:43.030> well<00:03:51.210> so<00:03:52.210> I

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:52.240 
enough to cover in lightly as well so I
