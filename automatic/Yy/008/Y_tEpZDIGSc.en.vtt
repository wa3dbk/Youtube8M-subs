00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.380
 I bet for you 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.069
 on this night of mourning will be put by 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.570
 you 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.070
 to present to a friend that you 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.860
 they knew any that had a 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.900
 quickness and a dexterity with his hands was 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.930
 so much that he was able to put together three cubes 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.440
 rubik's in less than a minute in less 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.730
 one minute all this under water 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.730
 underwater 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:32.240
 extremely complex concept 

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.240
 seven seconds gentlemen gentlemen 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.810
 and that made him deserving to earn a 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:51.030
 million four hundred thousand pesos this 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:51.030
 night we present francisco lm 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.530
 it is not damn 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.570
 today here and over the four million what 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.160
 I have 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.190
 budgeted to see the South American 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:08.720
 2013 I have to tell you that tonight 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.720
 francisco you have a challenger 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.900
 a man who said he came to this 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:17.840
 study and I was able to put together 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.840
 same three cubes in less than a minute 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:23.330
 and we are going to present here is the great 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.330
 francisco garrido 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:35.219
 i bet francisco 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.539
 by francisco francisco 

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:40.810
 I would like you to tell the jury 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:42.789
 to broth especially what is the challenge 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.579
 what are you going to do tonight to beat him 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:48.220
 to classes with him the thing is that there comes a 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:50.260
 program and william mad 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.080
 and I said an opportunity to associate it and 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.480
 I propose that we assemble three cubes in the 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.760
 shorter possible time 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.620
 racicot accepts this challenge but the 100 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.010
 first accept it very well I liked it 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.010
 this 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:10.410
 the idea is certainly that those of us 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.300
 have seen they can raise their hands and 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.819
 say I do more than him and this gives him 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.340
 a truth that we want 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:20.160
 establish as it is logical through the 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.840
 television then competition with 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.900
 the winner that we consider the 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:28.050
 opportunity of the day that has made a 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.670
 fantastic test has a challenger and 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.160
 for this purpose we have 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:35.940
 established that they must compete in 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:38.099
 simultaneously and fulfill its objective in the 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:41.610
 As little time as possible, do it first 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:43.650
 In short you will be the winner in this 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.290
 occasion that first ends the three 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:49.489
 cubes takes a million tonight 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.489
 Four hundred thousand pesos 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.360
 they are ready boys perfect 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:57.940
 boys, I invite you to take a position 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.860
 I want to tell you there they embrace 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.510
 opponents I want to tell you something 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.790
 while you take positions 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.820
 I personally take care of 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:09.880
 mess up these cubes so ladies and 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:12.790
 gentlemen the participants are already in 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:15.550
 their corresponding locations both 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.630
 francisco lemes as francisco garrido 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:24.430
 boys are ready 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:24.430
 ok then in 321 I bet 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:31.480
 and there they start 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:33.820
 effectively put together the cubes 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:37.060
 francisco lemes as francisco garrido 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:39.400
 the two go in the first cube in the 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:42.960
 first juice we see that garrido is 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.960
 using more fingers boys 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:48.090
 determines first tube 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.409
 reads me ends first there were boys not 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.599
 they can come to the surface to take 

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:53.819
 air to remember that you can not go out to 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:56.069
 surface reads through the first cube 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:56.940
 it ends now francisco garrido and there 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:01.650
 is the m 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:03.460

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.500
 finished second as it ends second 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.350
 as francisco lemes while garrido 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.840

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:16.950

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:50.969
 of not taking 5 million pesos 

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:54.180
