00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:30.290 
a character gaunt 2009 that ships with

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:33.130 
a character gaunt 2009 that ships with
the<00:00:30.320> software<00:00:30.829> and<00:00:31.450> we're<00:00:32.450> just<00:00:32.570> looking<00:00:32.960> at

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.140 
the software and we're just looking at

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.889 
the software and we're just looking at
his<00:00:33.530> basic<00:00:34.160> geometry<00:00:34.880> and<00:00:35.090> his<00:00:35.329> skeleton

00:00:35.889 --> 00:00:35.899 
his basic geometry and his skeleton

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:38.260 
his basic geometry and his skeleton
structure<00:00:36.140> that<00:00:36.440> has<00:00:36.620> come<00:00:36.860> in<00:00:37.040> from<00:00:37.270> a

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:38.270 
structure that has come in from a

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.930 
structure that has come in from a
third-party<00:00:38.780> application<00:00:39.130> and<00:00:40.130> I<00:00:40.760> just

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
third-party application and I just

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.700 
third-party application and I just
wanted<00:00:41.120> to<00:00:41.270> do<00:00:41.480> a<00:00:41.510> quick<00:00:41.750> little<00:00:41.990> rotation<00:00:42.590> to

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
wanted to do a quick little rotation to

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.950 
wanted to do a quick little rotation to
say<00:00:42.890> yes<00:00:43.160> he<00:00:43.580> is<00:00:43.730> a<00:00:43.760> skinned<00:00:44.270> character<00:00:44.750> that

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
say yes he is a skinned character that

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.750 
say yes he is a skinned character that
skinning<00:00:45.500> information<00:00:46.130> has<00:00:46.340> come<00:00:46.400> through

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
skinning information has come through

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:47.950 
skinning information has come through
let's<00:00:47.090> just<00:00:47.270> undo<00:00:47.690> that

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
let's just undo that

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.380 
let's just undo that
turn<00:00:48.260> off<00:00:48.410> the<00:00:48.560> manipulator<00:00:49.120> let's<00:00:50.120> look<00:00:50.300> at

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
turn off the manipulator let's look at

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.240 
turn off the manipulator let's look at
this<00:00:50.540> in<00:00:50.750> a<00:00:50.990> schematic<00:00:51.530> view<00:00:51.770> and<00:00:51.980> we'll<00:00:52.070> see

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
this in a schematic view and we'll see

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:53.920 
this in a schematic view and we'll see
that<00:00:52.280> we<00:00:52.490> have<00:00:52.670> a<00:00:52.700> basic<00:00:53.060> skeleton<00:00:53.720> hierarchy

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
that we have a basic skeleton hierarchy

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.650 
that we have a basic skeleton hierarchy
as<00:00:54.440> well<00:00:54.770> as<00:00:54.920> some<00:00:55.160> geometry<00:00:55.460> now<00:00:56.329> it's<00:00:56.480> back

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 
as well as some geometry now it's back

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.560 
as well as some geometry now it's back
here<00:00:56.989> to<00:00:57.320> the<00:00:57.829> viewer<00:00:58.130> window<00:00:58.340> and<00:00:58.730> we're

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
here to the viewer window and we're

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.150 
here to the viewer window and we're
gonna<00:00:59.660> start<00:00:59.989> to<00:01:00.140> look<00:01:00.290> at<00:01:00.530> the<00:01:00.890> motion

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
gonna start to look at the motion

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.460 
gonna start to look at the motion
builder<00:01:01.550> character<00:01:02.510> so<00:01:02.870> I'm<00:01:03.079> gonna<00:01:03.200> take<00:01:03.410> a

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
builder character so I'm gonna take a

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.649 
builder character so I'm gonna take a
character<00:01:03.950> from<00:01:04.040> our<00:01:04.250> templates<00:01:04.670> folder<00:01:05.149> drag

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
character from our templates folder drag

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:07.899 
character from our templates folder drag
and<00:01:05.810> drop<00:01:05.960> it<00:01:06.110> onto<00:01:06.259> the<00:01:06.409> hips<00:01:06.710> joint<00:01:07.009> and<00:01:07.310> I'm

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
and drop it onto the hips joint and I'm

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:10.300 
and drop it onto the hips joint and I'm
going<00:01:08.030> to<00:01:08.090> perform<00:01:08.240> a<00:01:08.570> characterization<00:01:09.310> it

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
going to perform a characterization it

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:11.469 
going to perform a characterization it
asked<00:01:10.490> me<00:01:10.610> if<00:01:10.670> I<00:01:10.729> wanted<00:01:10.970> by<00:01:11.150> pin<00:01:11.390> or

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
asked me if I wanted by pin or

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:13.510 
asked me if I wanted by pin or
quadrupeds<00:01:12.020> in<00:01:12.170> our<00:01:12.290> case<00:01:12.500> we<00:01:12.680> want<00:01:12.830> a<00:01:13.040> biped

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
quadrupeds in our case we want a biped

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.370 
quadrupeds in our case we want a biped
and<00:01:13.670> once<00:01:14.479> I've<00:01:14.720> dragged<00:01:15.140> on<00:01:15.380> to<00:01:16.070> our<00:01:17.380> gaunt

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
and once I've dragged on to our gaunt

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.590 
and once I've dragged on to our gaunt
character<00:01:18.979> we<00:01:19.550> have<00:01:19.760> something<00:01:20.420> called

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
character we have something called

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.899 
character we have something called
character<00:01:21.110> in<00:01:21.200> the<00:01:21.290> scene<00:01:21.500> then<00:01:21.760> we<00:01:22.760> can

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
character in the scene then we can

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:24.399 
character in the scene then we can
rename<00:01:23.150> that<00:01:23.360> character<00:01:23.750> let's<00:01:23.990> call<00:01:24.170> him

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
rename that character let's call him

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:28.060 
rename that character let's call him
gaunt<00:01:24.680> and<00:01:26.170> we'll<00:01:27.170> show<00:01:27.409> off<00:01:27.590> the<00:01:27.770> character

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
gaunt and we'll show off the character

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.620 
gaunt and we'll show off the character
definition<00:01:28.700> I'm<00:01:28.850> just<00:01:28.970> gonna<00:01:29.060> expand<00:01:29.510> this

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
definition I'm just gonna expand this

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:30.820 
definition I'm just gonna expand this
window<00:01:29.840> out<00:01:29.990> a<00:01:30.170> little<00:01:30.440> bit

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:30.830 
window out a little bit

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.800 
window out a little bit
turn<00:01:31.580> off<00:01:31.729> characterization<00:01:32.450> so<00:01:32.570> you<00:01:32.659> can

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
turn off characterization so you can

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.960 
turn off characterization so you can
read<00:01:32.990> it<00:01:33.110> a<00:01:33.229> little<00:01:33.380> better<00:01:33.620> this<00:01:34.250> is<00:01:34.640> the

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
read it a little better this is the

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.270 
read it a little better this is the
mapping<00:01:35.810> table<00:01:36.170> to<00:01:36.530> say<00:01:36.770> that<00:01:37.010> the

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
mapping table to say that the

mapping table to say that the
MotionBuilder<00:01:37.940> character<00:01:38.330> on<00:01:38.450> this<00:01:38.659> side

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
MotionBuilder character on this side

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.140 
MotionBuilder character on this side
needs<00:01:39.590> to<00:01:39.890> map<00:01:40.070> two<00:01:40.340> objects<00:01:40.970> that<00:01:41.060> you

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 
needs to map two objects that you

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.300 
needs to map two objects that you
brought<00:01:41.299> into<00:01:41.630> your<00:01:41.780> scene<00:01:42.320> in<00:01:42.530> gaunt

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
brought into your scene in gaunt

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.010 
brought into your scene in gaunt
we<00:01:43.580> showed<00:01:43.790> off<00:01:43.940> with<00:01:44.150> his<00:01:44.330> hierarchy<00:01:44.540> we<00:01:44.990> have

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
we showed off with his hierarchy we have

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.649 
we showed off with his hierarchy we have
the<00:01:45.710> same<00:01:46.010> names<00:01:46.280> in<00:01:46.610> our<00:01:46.729> skeleton<00:01:47.210> as<00:01:47.390> was

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
the same names in our skeleton as was

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:49.630 
the same names in our skeleton as was
expected<00:01:48.290> in<00:01:48.500> the<00:01:48.710> motion<00:01:49.010> builder<00:01:49.130> character

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
expected in the motion builder character

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.730

biped<00:02:07.340> let's<00:02:07.549> just<00:02:07.700> refresh<00:02:08.000> our<00:02:08.299> windows<00:02:08.629> and

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
biped let's just refresh our windows and

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.949 
biped let's just refresh our windows and
bounce<00:02:10.580> over<00:02:10.759> to<00:02:10.879> the<00:02:11.060> character<00:02:11.420> settings<00:02:11.780> at

bounce over to the character settings at
this<00:02:12.110> point<00:02:12.409> we'll<00:02:13.129> activate<00:02:13.459> him<00:02:13.849> in<00:02:13.969> his

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
this point we'll activate him in his

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.119 
this point we'll activate him in his
stance<00:02:14.419> input<00:02:14.840> scene<00:02:15.230> nothing<00:02:15.560> has<00:02:15.709> changed

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:16.129 
stance input scene nothing has changed

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:18.580 
stance input scene nothing has changed
at<00:02:16.249> this<00:02:16.370> point<00:02:16.730> and<00:02:17.060> we're<00:02:17.840> gonna<00:02:17.930> change<00:02:18.319> the

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
at this point and we're gonna change the

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:19.780 
at this point and we're gonna change the
input<00:02:19.069> instead<00:02:19.609> of

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
input instead of

input instead of
stands<00:02:20.329> to<00:02:20.599> be<00:02:20.750> a<00:02:20.780> control<00:02:21.349> rig<00:02:21.640> since<00:02:22.640> there's

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
stands to be a control rig since there's

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:24.970 
stands to be a control rig since there's
no<00:02:22.959> control<00:02:23.959> recurrently<00:02:24.500> in<00:02:24.650> the<00:02:24.769> scene

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
no control recurrently in the scene

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.470 
no control recurrently in the scene
we're<00:02:25.189> gonna<00:02:25.280> create<00:02:25.640> one<00:02:25.700> it<00:02:25.939> asks<00:02:26.239> you<00:02:26.359> if

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
we're gonna create one it asks you if

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.630 
we're gonna create one it asks you if
you<00:02:26.510> want<00:02:26.750> an<00:02:26.840> FK<00:02:27.140> IQ<00:02:27.500> or<00:02:27.650> an<00:02:27.709> AI<00:02:27.799> K<00:02:27.859> only<00:02:28.219> let's

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
you want an FK IQ or an AI K only let's

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.970 
you want an FK IQ or an AI K only let's
select<00:02:28.849> F<00:02:29.090> ki<00:02:29.329> k<00:02:29.540> and<00:02:29.989> elaborate<00:02:30.409> a<00:02:30.439> bit<00:02:30.500> on<00:02:30.650> it

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
select F ki k and elaborate a bit on it

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.369 
select F ki k and elaborate a bit on it
so<00:02:31.579> you<00:02:31.670> see<00:02:31.849> that<00:02:32.000> now<00:02:32.060> we<00:02:32.269> have<00:02:32.719> multiple

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:33.379 
so you see that now we have multiple

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:35.890 
so you see that now we have multiple
colored<00:02:33.890> skeletons<00:02:34.430> within<00:02:34.760> the<00:02:34.939> scene<00:02:35.180> let's

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
colored skeletons within the scene let's

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.020 
colored skeletons within the scene let's
go<00:02:35.989> back<00:02:36.200> to<00:02:36.470> our<00:02:36.739> schematic<00:02:37.189> view<00:02:37.609> we'll<00:02:37.849> just

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
go back to our schematic view we'll just

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:39.640 
go back to our schematic view we'll just
arrange<00:02:38.329> all<00:02:38.569> of<00:02:38.689> that<00:02:38.810> information<00:02:39.109> and<00:02:39.439> see

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
arrange all of that information and see

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.589 
arrange all of that information and see
that<00:02:39.799> we<00:02:39.890> have<00:02:40.099> what<00:02:40.489> we've<00:02:40.640> seen<00:02:40.879> before<00:02:41.030> from

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:41.599 
that we have what we've seen before from

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:44.349 
that we have what we've seen before from

would<00:03:08.959> expect<00:03:09.319> to<00:03:09.439> move<00:03:09.620> but<00:03:09.950> let's<00:03:10.129> just<00:03:10.280> move

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
would expect to move but let's just move

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:14.649 
would expect to move but let's just move
it<00:03:10.609> a<00:03:10.730> little<00:03:10.760> bit<00:03:11.120> past<00:03:12.010> the<00:03:13.359> limit<00:03:14.359> of<00:03:14.480> that

00:03:14.649 --> 00:03:14.659 
it a little bit past the limit of that

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:17.319 
it a little bit past the limit of that
arm<00:03:14.900> and<00:03:15.019> you'll<00:03:15.169> see<00:03:15.379> that<00:03:15.590> by<00:03:16.340> default<00:03:16.760> the

are full-body so that if you pick an

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.259 
are full-body so that if you pick an
effector<00:03:22.939> and<00:03:22.970> and<00:03:23.859> pull<00:03:24.859> it<00:03:25.010> past<00:03:25.280> the<00:03:25.909> limits

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
effector and and pull it past the limits

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:28.180 
effector and and pull it past the limits
of<00:03:26.510> the<00:03:26.750> arm<00:03:26.989> it<00:03:27.290> will<00:03:27.440> then<00:03:27.620> start<00:03:27.949> to<00:03:28.010> affect

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
of the arm it will then start to affect

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:29.979 
of the arm it will then start to affect
the<00:03:28.549> rest<00:03:28.729> of<00:03:28.879> the<00:03:28.970> body<00:03:29.180> based<00:03:29.510> on<00:03:29.750> the

configured for each character depending
on<00:03:36.169> your<00:03:36.349> requirements<00:03:37.150> so<00:03:38.199> that's<00:03:39.199> all

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
on your requirements so that's all

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:42.189 
on your requirements so that's all
pretty<00:03:40.340> straightforward<00:03:40.699> let's<00:03:41.569> look<00:03:42.079> at

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:42.199 
pretty straightforward let's look at

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:43.240 
pretty straightforward let's look at
something<00:03:42.379> else<00:03:42.620> that's<00:03:42.829> pretty<00:03:42.889> powerful

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
something else that's pretty powerful

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.759 
something else that's pretty powerful
about<00:03:43.760> characters<00:03:44.299> so<00:03:44.510> we<00:03:44.629> have<00:03:44.810> by<00:03:45.109> default<00:03:45.169> a

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
about characters so we have by default a

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:47.619 
about characters so we have by default a
wrist<00:03:46.040> more<00:03:46.459> or<00:03:46.579> less<00:03:46.729> created<00:03:47.150> in<00:03:47.269> the<00:03:47.419> wrist

00:03:47.619 --> 00:03:47.629 
wrist more or less created in the wrist

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:50.710 
wrist more or less created in the wrist
position<00:03:48.560> but<00:03:49.310> to<00:03:49.459> say<00:03:49.609> we<00:03:49.760> had<00:03:49.909> some<00:03:50.090> props<00:03:50.359> or

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
position but to say we had some props or

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.390 
position but to say we had some props or
some<00:03:51.019> object<00:03:51.470> interaction<00:03:51.650> that<00:03:52.010> we<00:03:52.129> had<00:03:52.310> to

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
some object interaction that we had to

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.069 
some object interaction that we had to
deal<00:03:52.549> with<00:03:52.609> in<00:03:52.879> the<00:03:52.970> scene<00:03:53.180> it's<00:03:53.479> as<00:03:53.599> simple<00:03:53.959> as

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:54.079 
deal with in the scene it's as simple as

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:57.939 
deal with in the scene it's as simple as
adding<00:03:54.319> an<00:03:54.650> additional<00:03:55.579> effector<00:03:56.060> into<00:03:56.949> the

00:03:57.939 --> 00:03:57.949 
adding an additional effector into the

00:03:57.949 --> 00:04:00.789 
adding an additional effector into the
scene<00:03:58.430> let's<00:03:58.729> say<00:03:58.970> create<00:03:59.840> auxilary<00:04:00.290> effector

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:00.799 
scene let's say create auxilary effector

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:03.659 
scene let's say create auxilary effector
on<00:04:01.060> left<00:04:02.060> wrist<00:04:02.329> and<00:04:02.659> now<00:04:02.989> let's<00:04:03.169> go<00:04:03.319> into

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:03.669 
on left wrist and now let's go into

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:06.490 
on left wrist and now let's go into
pivot<00:04:04.669> mode<00:04:04.849> and<00:04:05.359> let's<00:04:05.629> offset<00:04:06.019> that<00:04:06.229> to

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
pivot mode and let's offset that to

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.140 
pivot mode and let's offset that to
somewhere<00:04:06.829> say<00:04:07.069> in<00:04:07.220> the<00:04:07.340> middle<00:04:07.609> of<00:04:07.790> the<00:04:07.939> palm

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
somewhere say in the middle of the palm

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.089 
somewhere say in the middle of the palm
so<00:04:09.049> now<00:04:09.260> when<00:04:10.069> we<00:04:10.489> go<00:04:10.639> back<00:04:10.819> into<00:04:11.150> translation

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:12.099 
so now when we go back into translation

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:14.920 
so now when we go back into translation
transformation<00:04:13.099> mode<00:04:13.310> we<00:04:14.120> can<00:04:14.150> now<00:04:14.449> control

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
transformation mode we can now control

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:16.749 
transformation mode we can now control
it<00:04:14.959> from<00:04:15.260> the<00:04:15.590> middle<00:04:15.889> of<00:04:15.949> the<00:04:16.099> palm<00:04:16.310> instead

00:04:16.749 --> 00:04:16.759 
it from the middle of the palm instead

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:18.009 
it from the middle of the palm instead
of<00:04:16.880> at<00:04:16.970> the<00:04:17.120> wrist<00:04:17.299> which<00:04:17.479> is<00:04:17.659> quick<00:04:17.870> and

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 
of at the wrist which is quick and

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:19.930 
of at the wrist which is quick and
powerful<00:04:18.199> you<00:04:18.620> see<00:04:18.829> that<00:04:19.009> we<00:04:19.099> have<00:04:19.250> an<00:04:19.370> X<00:04:19.579> icon

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
powerful you see that we have an X icon

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.029 
powerful you see that we have an X icon
on<00:04:20.449> our<00:04:20.479> character<00:04:21.019> here<00:04:21.409> and<00:04:21.590> then<00:04:21.799> we<00:04:21.889> can

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:22.039 
on our character here and then we can

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:24.999 
on our character here and then we can
toggle<00:04:22.250> between<00:04:22.550> the<00:04:22.909> two<00:04:23.080> that<00:04:24.080> gives<00:04:24.800> you

00:04:24.999 --> 00:04:25.009 
toggle between the two that gives you

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:27.310 
toggle between the two that gives you
extreme<00:04:25.460> flexibility<00:04:26.060> and<00:04:26.300> power<00:04:26.539> utilizing

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
extreme flexibility and power utilizing

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.019 
extreme flexibility and power utilizing
the<00:04:27.409> character<00:04:27.830> tool<00:04:28.039> so<00:04:28.520> that's<00:04:28.639> between<00:04:28.849> the

00:04:29.019 --> 00:04:29.029 
the character tool so that's between the

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:30.640 
the character tool so that's between the
eye<00:04:29.060> catching<00:04:29.779> let's<00:04:30.020> examine<00:04:30.320> something

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
eye catching let's examine something

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.870 
eye catching let's examine something
else<00:04:30.919> let's<00:04:31.250> look<00:04:31.430> at<00:04:31.550> the<00:04:31.639> ankle<00:04:32.090> where

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
else let's look at the ankle where

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.520 
else let's look at the ankle where
you<00:04:33.120> would<00:04:33.240> want<00:04:33.390> to<00:04:33.540> have<00:04:33.750> some<00:04:33.990> kind<00:04:34.440> of

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
you would want to have some kind of

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.890 
you would want to have some kind of
additional<00:04:34.830> pivot<00:04:35.460> information<00:04:36.180> on<00:04:36.390> occasion

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
additional pivot information on occasion

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.100 
additional pivot information on occasion
so<00:04:37.230> by<00:04:37.860> default<00:04:38.250> the<00:04:38.640> pivot<00:04:38.970> is<00:04:39.240> set<00:04:39.720> at<00:04:39.960> the

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
so by default the pivot is set at the

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:41.690 
so by default the pivot is set at the
ankle<00:04:40.500> as<00:04:40.650> you<00:04:40.770> can<00:04:40.920> see<00:04:41.100> it<00:04:41.220> rotates<00:04:41.520> around

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 
ankle as you can see it rotates around

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.880 
ankle as you can see it rotates around
the<00:04:41.940> ankle<00:04:42.270> but<00:04:42.480> just<00:04:42.780> as<00:04:42.900> we<00:04:43.020> did<00:04:43.230> with<00:04:43.680> the

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:43.890 
the ankle but just as we did with the

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:45.980 
the ankle but just as we did with the
wrists<00:04:44.370> let's<00:04:44.730> go<00:04:44.880> in<00:04:45.090> and<00:04:45.360> let's<00:04:45.570> create<00:04:45.750> an

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
wrists let's go in and let's create an

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.380 
wrists let's go in and let's create an
auxilary<00:04:46.350> pivot<00:04:46.800> in<00:04:47.010> this<00:04:47.160> case<00:04:47.430> so<00:04:48.240> you'll

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:48.390 
auxilary pivot in this case so you'll

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:50.360 
auxilary pivot in this case so you'll
see<00:04:48.600> that<00:04:48.810> it<00:04:49.260> creates<00:04:49.620> an<00:04:49.770> additional<00:04:49.950> pivot

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
see that it creates an additional pivot

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.100 
see that it creates an additional pivot
a<00:04:50.460> little<00:04:50.490> bit<00:04:50.790> offset<00:04:50.970> so<00:04:51.540> let's<00:04:51.720> just<00:04:51.870> go<00:04:51.960> in

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
a little bit offset so let's just go in

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.020 
a little bit offset so let's just go in
to<00:04:52.320> pivot<00:04:52.620> mode<00:04:52.740> again<00:04:53.100> let's<00:04:53.430> frame<00:04:53.670> in<00:04:53.910> on

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
to pivot mode again let's frame in on

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.450 
to pivot mode again let's frame in on
that<00:04:54.240> and<00:04:54.510> just<00:04:54.710> position<00:04:55.710> it<00:04:55.860> as<00:04:56.070> we<00:04:56.370> would

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
that and just position it as we would

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.570 
that and just position it as we would
like<00:04:56.700> just<00:04:57.570> kind<00:04:57.810> of<00:04:57.840> at<00:04:58.020> the<00:04:58.170> heel<00:04:58.680> for

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
like just kind of at the heel for

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.640 
like just kind of at the heel for
example<00:05:00.240> there<00:05:01.020> are<00:05:01.140> times<00:05:01.380> when<00:05:01.530> you're

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
example there are times when you're

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.940 
example there are times when you're
gonna<00:05:01.740> want<00:05:02.010> to<00:05:02.160> roll<00:05:02.370> around<00:05:02.640> heel<00:05:03.240> and<00:05:04.110> not

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:04.950 
gonna want to roll around heel and not

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:07.280 
gonna want to roll around heel and not
the<00:05:05.430> actual<00:05:05.610> ankle<00:05:06.270> so<00:05:06.720> that's<00:05:07.050> kind<00:05:07.260> of

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:07.290 
the actual ankle so that's kind of

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:12.410 
the actual ankle so that's kind of
bounced<00:05:07.680> out<00:05:07.800> of<00:05:07.950> there<00:05:08.270> and<00:05:09.770> in<00:05:11.090> in<00:05:12.090> right

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:12.420 
bounced out of there and in in right

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.840 
bounced out of there and in in right
around<00:05:12.540> the<00:05:12.810> heel<00:05:13.080> and<00:05:13.490> exactly<00:05:14.490> like<00:05:14.640> we've

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:14.850 
around the heel and exactly like we've

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:17.360 
around the heel and exactly like we've
done<00:05:15.090> as<00:05:15.510> soon<00:05:15.750> as<00:05:15.870> we<00:05:15.930> go<00:05:16.050> back<00:05:16.200> into<00:05:16.470> model

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
done as soon as we go back into model

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:18.890 
done as soon as we go back into model
transformation<00:05:17.790> mode<00:05:18.240> and<00:05:18.480> we're<00:05:18.570> into

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 
transformation mode and we're into

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.890 
transformation mode and we're into
rotation<00:05:19.440> instead<00:05:20.190> of<00:05:20.640> rotating<00:05:21.450> at<00:05:21.810> the

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
rotation instead of rotating at the

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.710 
rotation instead of rotating at the
ankle<00:05:22.290> we're<00:05:22.440> able<00:05:22.740> to<00:05:22.890> manipulate<00:05:23.280> that<00:05:24.240> foot

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 
ankle we're able to manipulate that foot

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.500 
ankle we're able to manipulate that foot
around<00:05:24.960> its<00:05:25.440> auxilary<00:05:26.040> pivot<00:05:26.550> here<00:05:26.850> and<00:05:27.060> again

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:27.510 
around its auxilary pivot here and again
