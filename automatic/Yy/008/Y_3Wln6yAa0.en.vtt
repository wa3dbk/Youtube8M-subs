get a little bit of a cakey look to it
but<00:03:02.100> anyway<00:03:02.400> I<00:03:02.430> I<00:03:03.000> do<00:03:03.180> like<00:03:03.540> this<00:03:03.690> product<00:03:04.170> it's

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
but anyway I I do like this product it's

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.650 
but anyway I I do like this product it's
not<00:03:04.830> my<00:03:05.790> favorite<00:03:06.180> thing<00:03:06.240> that<00:03:06.420> I've<00:03:06.630> ever

not my favorite thing that I've ever

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.390 
not my favorite thing that I've ever
used<00:03:07.170> in<00:03:08.160> terms<00:03:08.430> of<00:03:08.790> pore<00:03:09.660> refining<00:03:10.400> primer

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
I like it but I just think it's kind of

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.640
