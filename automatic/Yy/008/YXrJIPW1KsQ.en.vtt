you can understand cause better oh

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:07.340 
you can understand cause better oh
you're<00:00:04.980> probably<00:00:05.160> more<00:00:05.370> used<00:00:05.640> to<00:00:05.759> chords<00:00:06.750> when

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
you're probably more used to chords when

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:13.360 
you're probably more used to chords when
you're<00:00:07.440> first<00:00:07.589> learn<00:00:07.859> to<00:00:07.890> play<00:00:08.099> guitar<00:00:11.840> or

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:16.849 
you're first learn to play guitar or
whatever<00:00:14.370> because<00:00:14.790> I<00:00:15.120> there<00:00:15.560> if<00:00:16.560> you<00:00:16.710> don't

whatever because I there if you don't
already<00:00:16.980> know<00:00:17.130> that<00:00:17.640> these<00:00:18.090> chords<00:00:18.630> are

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
already know that these chords are

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.370 
already know that these chords are
called<00:00:19.650> triads<00:00:20.340> that's<00:00:21.119> because<00:00:21.539> they've<00:00:22.170> got

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
called triads that's because they've got

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.769 
called triads that's because they've got
three<00:00:22.619> notes<00:00:22.859> in<00:00:23.100> them<00:00:23.250> as<00:00:23.460> in<00:00:23.760> try<00:00:24.000> nothing<00:00:24.689> to

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
three notes in them as in try nothing to

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.359 
three notes in them as in try nothing to
do<00:00:24.930> with<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.080> Chinese<00:00:25.470> nathia<00:00:25.890> or<00:00:26.039> anything

do with the Chinese nathia or anything
like<00:00:26.400> that<00:00:26.550> but<00:00:27.199> basically<00:00:28.519> they've<00:00:29.519> all<00:00:29.640> got

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
like that but basically they've all got

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.990 
like that but basically they've all got
three<00:00:30.060> notes<00:00:30.269> to<00:00:30.510> make<00:00:30.660> them<00:00:30.869> up<00:00:31.489> another<00:00:32.489> sort

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
three notes to make them up another sort

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.370 
three notes to make them up another sort
of<00:00:33.030> chords<00:00:33.390> that<00:00:33.540> you're<00:00:33.690> more<00:00:33.930> aware

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
of chords that you're more aware

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.090 
of chords that you're more aware
probably<00:00:34.920> is<00:00:35.040> a<00:00:35.070> barre<00:00:35.340> chord<00:00:35.630> example

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
probably is a barre chord example

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:44.770 
probably is a barre chord example

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
called triads wanting to talk to you now

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.359 
called triads wanting to talk to you now
about<00:01:42.420> is<00:01:42.869> somehow<00:01:43.229> you<00:01:43.470> can<00:01:43.710> prove<00:01:43.890> a<00:01:44.130> cause

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
about is somehow you can prove a cause

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.370 
about is somehow you can prove a cause
you<00:01:44.579> probably<00:01:44.820> already<00:01:45.060> know<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.810> power<00:01:46.049> cord

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
you probably already know the power cord

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.429 
you probably already know the power cord
a<00:01:47.090> power<00:01:48.090> cord<00:01:48.360> is<00:01:48.450> made<00:01:48.630> up<00:01:48.810> of<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.229> roots

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
a power cord is made up of the roots

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.670 
a power cord is made up of the roots
notes<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:50.180> the<00:01:51.180> fifth<00:01:51.450> that's<00:01:52.259> why<00:01:52.500> it's

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
notes and the fifth that's why it's

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.789 
notes and the fifth that's why it's
probably<00:01:53.250> in<00:01:53.340> boats<00:01:53.520> down<00:01:54.090> as<00:01:54.390> maybe<00:01:55.229> be<00:01:55.530> five

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
probably in boats down as maybe be five

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.219 
probably in boats down as maybe be five
or<00:01:56.070> a<00:01:56.130> five<00:01:56.549> visits<00:01:57.240> just<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.630> Rue<00:01:57.780> note<00:01:57.990> and

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
or a five visits just the Rue note and

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.719 
or a five visits just the Rue note and
the<00:01:58.350> fifth<00:01:58.560> there's<00:01:58.770> only<00:01:58.890> two<00:01:59.159> notes<00:01:59.369> in<00:01:59.610> it

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
the fifth there's only two notes in it

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.380 
the fifth there's only two notes in it
and<00:02:00.180> so<00:02:00.930> for<00:02:01.619> example<00:02:01.680> if<00:02:02.399> I<00:02:02.579> played<00:02:02.820> a<00:02:02.850> be

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
and so for example if I played a be

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.310 
and so for example if I played a be
power<00:02:03.630> cord<00:02:03.990> made<00:02:04.590> up<00:02:04.770> of

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
power cord made up of

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.919 
power cord made up of
that<00:02:05.800> sure<00:02:06.040> you<00:02:06.820> get<00:02:06.970> this

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
that sure you get this

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.039 
that sure you get this
you<00:02:09.920> can<00:02:10.099> make<00:02:10.219> it<00:02:10.250> sound<00:02:10.729> some<00:02:11.299> thicker<00:02:11.629> by

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:12.049 
you can make it sound some thicker by

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:14.380 
you can make it sound some thicker by
adding<00:02:12.500> the<00:02:12.530> be<00:02:12.799> in<00:02:13.069> the<00:02:13.159> octave<00:02:13.519> so<00:02:13.969> you<00:02:14.030> get

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
adding the be in the octave so you get

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.800 
adding the be in the octave so you get
this<00:02:14.599> kind<00:02:14.870> of<00:02:14.989> effect

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.930 

or<00:02:18.530> you<00:02:18.830> can<00:02:18.980> add<00:02:19.099> the<00:02:19.220> fifth<00:02:19.489> in<00:02:19.640> the<00:02:19.760> base

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
or you can add the fifth in the base

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.699 
or you can add the fifth in the base
which<00:02:20.300> is<00:02:20.450> probably<00:02:20.599> the<00:02:20.720> heaviest<00:02:20.930> foolish

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
which is probably the heaviest foolish

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:27.539 
which is probably the heaviest foolish
kind<00:02:22.040> of<00:02:22.190> power<00:02:22.489> cord

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:27.549 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:29.800 

okay<00:02:28.549> now<00:02:28.790> normally<00:02:29.239> talk<00:02:29.420> to<00:02:29.540> you<00:02:29.629> how<00:02:29.780> you

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
okay now normally talk to you how you

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.140 
okay now normally talk to you how you
can<00:02:30.109> improve<00:02:30.709> these<00:02:31.219> power<00:02:31.489> chords<00:02:31.760> by<00:02:31.879> adding

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
can improve these power chords by adding

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.819 
can improve these power chords by adding
