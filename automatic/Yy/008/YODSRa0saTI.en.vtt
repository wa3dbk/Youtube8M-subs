00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:59.440 

next<00:00:53.730> we'll<00:00:54.000> need<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.270> shut<00:00:54.510> down<00:00:54.540> the<00:00:54.720> tractor

00:00:59.440 --> 00:00:59.450 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.700 

so<00:01:00.450> now<00:01:00.600> we<00:01:00.690> just<00:01:00.989> need<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.290> connect<00:01:01.590> the

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
so now we just need to connect the

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.830 
so now we just need to connect the
hydraulic<00:01:01.860> hoses<00:01:02.460> starting<00:01:03.329> with<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.600> top

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:31.540 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.850 

then<00:01:32.540> we<00:01:32.690> need<00:01:32.810> to<00:01:32.900> start<00:01:33.140> the<00:01:33.260> tractor<00:01:33.560> back

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
then we need to start the tractor back

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.040 
then we need to start the tractor back
up<00:01:34.130> and<00:01:34.340> just<00:01:34.370> loader<00:01:34.850> the<00:01:35.090> stabilizer<00:01:35.600> arms

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.050

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:37.990 
up and just loader the stabilizer arms
on<00:01:36.140> the<00:01:36.230> backhoe<00:01:36.620> so<00:01:37.040> we're<00:01:37.310> ready<00:01:37.460> to<00:01:37.700> get<00:01:37.880> to

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
on the backhoe so we're ready to get to

00:01:38.000 --> 00:02:20.260 
on the backhoe so we're ready to get to
work

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
disconnect the back coast simply we're

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.840 
disconnect the back coast simply we're
going<00:02:24.560> to<00:02:24.650> repeat<00:02:24.920> these<00:02:25.100> steps<00:02:25.280> in<00:02:25.640> Reverse

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
going to repeat these steps in Reverse

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.580 
going to repeat these steps in Reverse
first<00:02:28.850> we<00:02:29.180> need<00:02:29.330> to<00:02:29.420> raise<00:02:29.600> to<00:02:29.870> stabilize<00:02:30.380> your

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590
