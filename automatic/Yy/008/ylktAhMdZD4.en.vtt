00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.940 
some fairly heavy sandpaper so it kind
of<00:04:37.300> has<00:04:37.450> like<00:04:37.570> a<00:04:37.720> brushed<00:04:38.050> aluminum<00:04:38.229> look<00:04:38.740> now

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:38.950 
of has like a brushed aluminum look now

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:41.159 
of has like a brushed aluminum look now
because<00:04:39.190> I<00:04:39.729> sanded<00:04:40.300> away<00:04:40.479> all<00:04:40.630> the<00:04:40.750> corrosion

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:41.169 
because I sanded away all the corrosion

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:44.100 
because I sanded away all the corrosion
then<00:04:41.320> I<00:04:41.349> just<00:04:41.620> went<00:04:41.770> back<00:04:42.070> and<00:04:42.250> forth<00:04:42.900> the<00:04:43.900> long

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
then I just went back and forth the long

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.040 
then I just went back and forth the long
way<00:04:44.380> so<00:04:45.010> all<00:04:45.400> the<00:04:45.700> like<00:04:46.150> scrapes<00:04:46.630> are<00:04:46.810> going<00:04:46.990> in

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
way so all the like scrapes are going in

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:48.120 
way so all the like scrapes are going in
the<00:04:47.110> same<00:04:47.139> direction<00:04:47.289> it<00:04:47.620> looks<00:04:47.770> pretty<00:04:47.950> cool

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 
the same direction it looks pretty cool

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:52.140
