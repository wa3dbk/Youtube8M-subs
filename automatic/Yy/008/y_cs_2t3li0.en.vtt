think that's gonna be a big part of them
as<00:01:44.820> well<00:01:45.000> because<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:45.990> end<00:01:46.079> of<00:01:46.200> last<00:01:46.290> season

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
as well because the end of last season

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.999 
as well because the end of last season
he<00:01:46.979> was<00:01:47.250> doing<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.490> business<00:01:47.640> for<00:01:48.030> them<00:01:48.149> and
