I<00:02:50.680> was<00:02:51.099> kind<00:02:51.340> of<00:02:51.370> shocked<00:02:51.640> they<00:02:51.790> had<00:02:51.970> the<00:02:52.060> match

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
I was kind of shocked they had the match

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:54.539 
I was kind of shocked they had the match
the<00:02:52.540> title<00:02:52.810> match<00:02:52.930> on<00:02:53.110> this<00:02:53.230> show<00:02:53.440> I<00:02:53.709> was

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:54.549 
the title match on this show I was

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:55.860 
the title match on this show I was
figuring<00:02:55.180> they<00:02:55.269> were<00:02:55.299> going<00:02:55.510> to<00:02:55.540> hold<00:02:55.720> off

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
figuring they were going to hold off

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.470 
figuring they were going to hold off
until<00:02:56.079> take<00:02:56.410> over<00:02:56.739> anyway<00:02:57.099> and<00:02:57.400> so<00:02:58.090> they<00:02:58.269> did

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
until take over anyway and so they did

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.509 
until take over anyway and so they did
it<00:02:58.599> for<00:02:58.840> the<00:02:58.870> reason<00:02:59.319> I<00:02:59.470> assume<00:02:59.890> of<00:03:00.099> setting<00:03:00.430> up

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
it for the reason I assume of setting up

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:02.370 
it for the reason I assume of setting up
the<00:03:00.700> four-way<00:03:01.150> I'm<00:03:01.420> just<00:03:01.720> assuming<00:03:01.989> here<00:03:02.349> that

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
the four-way I'm just assuming here that

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.259 
the four-way I'm just assuming here that
that's<00:03:02.709> the<00:03:03.099> the<00:03:03.489> match<00:03:03.640> that<00:03:03.849> we<00:03:04.000> end<00:03:04.120> up

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269 
that's the the match that we end up

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:06.750 
that's the the match that we end up
getting<00:03:04.860> but<00:03:05.860> this<00:03:05.950> was<00:03:06.160> really<00:03:06.340> good<00:03:06.640> you
