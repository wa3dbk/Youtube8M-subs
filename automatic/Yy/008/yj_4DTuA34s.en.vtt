the<00:00:36.960> play<00:00:37.260> we<00:00:37.440> like<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:37.800> use<00:00:38.070> for<00:00:38.340> our<00:00:38.460> base<00:00:38.760> run

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
the play we like to use for our base run

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.350 
the play we like to use for our base run
defense<00:00:39.630> is<00:00:40.530> actually<00:00:40.710> our<00:00:40.950> base<00:00:41.130> play<00:00:41.400> it's

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
defense is actually our base play it's

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.299 
defense is actually our base play it's
actually<00:00:42.480> going<00:00:42.720> to<00:00:42.810> be<00:00:42.840> from<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.680> storm<00:00:44.039> read

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
actually going to be from the storm read

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.700 
actually going to be from the storm read
and<00:00:45.180> so<00:00:45.570> that's<00:00:45.719> very<00:00:45.809> simple<00:00:46.289> very<00:00:46.320> simple

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
and so that's very simple very simple

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.380 
and so that's very simple very simple
because<00:00:46.920> we<00:00:47.070> already<00:00:47.160> have<00:00:47.430> it<00:00:47.609> so<00:00:48.300> we're

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
because we already have it so we're

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.180 
because we already have it so we're
going<00:00:48.449> to<00:00:48.570> use<00:00:48.600> a<00:00:48.750> different<00:00:48.960> setup<00:00:49.649> than<00:00:49.800> what

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
going to use a different setup than what

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.040 
going to use a different setup than what
we<00:00:50.280> listed<00:00:50.550> as<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.699> base<00:00:50.910> setup<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.449> this<00:00:51.960> is

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
we listed as a base setup and this is

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.290 
we listed as a base setup and this is
going<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.230> be<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.350> run<00:00:52.620> defense<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.100> them<00:00:53.300> what

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
going to be a run defense to them what

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.029 
going to be a run defense to them what
we<00:00:54.390> like<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:54.570> do<00:00:54.750> when<00:00:55.260> utilizing<00:00:55.649> revenues

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
we like to do when utilizing revenues

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.169 
we like to do when utilizing revenues
like<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.309> baseline<00:00:56.789> if<00:00:57.000> we're<00:00:57.120> playing

00:00:57.169 --> 00:00:57.179 
like the baseline if we're playing

00:00:57.179 --> 00:00:58.729 
like the baseline if we're playing
strong<00:00:57.629> close<00:00:57.929> we<00:00:58.140> don't<00:00:58.170> have<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:58.559> base<00:00:58.710> a

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
strong close we don't have to base a

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.540 
strong close we don't have to base a
line<00:00:59.690> then<00:01:00.690> refer<00:01:00.989> a<00:01:01.230> situation<00:01:01.949> we<00:01:02.010> face<00:01:02.160> a

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
line then refer a situation we face a

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.939 
line then refer a situation we face a
compressed<00:01:03.420> set<00:01:03.660> I<00:01:03.899> like<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.290> call<00:01:04.470> Preston

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
compressed set I like to call Preston

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.520 
compressed set I like to call Preston
press<00:01:05.280> coverage<00:01:05.700> okay<00:01:06.630> now<00:01:07.020> all<00:01:07.290> we're<00:01:07.440> going

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
press coverage okay now all we're going

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:08.870 
press coverage okay now all we're going
to<00:01:07.590> do<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:07.860> set<00:01:08.010> up<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.190> run<00:01:08.340> defense<00:01:08.520> for<00:01:08.790> this

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
to do to set up the run defense for this

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.190 
to do to set up the run defense for this
is<00:01:09.000> pretty<00:01:09.210> simple<00:01:09.450> we're<00:01:09.930> just<00:01:10.050> going<00:01:10.170> to

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
is pretty simple we're just going to

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.390 
is pretty simple we're just going to
crash<00:01:10.380> our<00:01:10.590> defensive<00:01:10.950> line<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.160> the<00:01:11.250> left

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
crash our defensive line to the left

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.180 
crash our defensive line to the left
we're<00:01:12.210> going<00:01:12.300> to<00:01:12.390> put<00:01:12.480> Roche<00:01:12.750> here<00:01:13.140> in<00:01:13.350> a<00:01:13.590> hook

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:14.190 
we're going to put Roche here in a hook

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.130

zone<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:14.670> we're<00:01:14.760> going<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:14.910> user<00:01:15.120> him<00:01:15.420> over

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
zone and we're going to user him over

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.660 
zone and we're going to user him over
the<00:01:16.229> egg<00:01:16.350> up<00:01:16.500> so<00:01:16.650> it<00:01:16.740> is<00:01:16.829> the<00:01:16.860> base<00:01:17.189> set<00:01:17.460> up<00:01:17.579> but

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
the egg up so it is the base set up but

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.460 
the egg up so it is the base set up but
we're<00:01:17.820> not<00:01:17.939> going<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.150> pass<00:01:18.360> commit<00:01:18.780> on<00:01:19.320> all

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
we're not going to pass commit on all

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.870 
we're not going to pass commit on all
the<00:01:19.560> other<00:01:19.650> setups<00:01:20.040> from<00:01:20.159> cast<00:01:20.400> me<00:01:20.610> we're<00:01:20.759> just

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
the other setups from cast me we're just

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.700 
the other setups from cast me we're just
going<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.060> sit<00:01:21.240> this<00:01:21.360> a<00:01:21.540> gap<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:22.229> once<00:01:22.409> we<00:01:22.530> see

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
going to sit this a gap and once we see

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.050 
going to sit this a gap and once we see
the<00:01:22.829> ball<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.310> they're<00:01:23.490> running<00:01:23.759> blowers

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
the ball that they're running blowers

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.880 
the ball that they're running blowers
going<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.299> come<00:01:24.420> right<00:01:24.540> through<00:01:24.720> it<00:01:24.869> so<00:01:25.740> here

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
going to come right through it so here

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:26.929 
going to come right through it so here
we<00:01:25.920> just<00:01:26.070> come<00:01:26.250> right<00:01:26.340> through<00:01:26.520> we<00:01:26.670> see<00:01:26.820> the

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
we just come right through we see the

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.999 
we just come right through we see the
run<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.329> the<00:01:27.540> idea<00:01:27.869> is<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:28.079> safety<00:01:28.560> over<00:01:28.920> the

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
run and the idea is a safety over the

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.370 
run and the idea is a safety over the
top<00:01:29.220> is<00:01:29.430> going<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.240> play<00:01:30.479> it<00:01:30.509> very<00:01:30.810> effectively

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
top is going to play it very effectively

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.800 
they're running the ball then grab onto
woodson<00:01:37.920> here<00:01:38.159> just<00:01:38.970> call<00:01:39.149> the<00:01:39.240> place<00:01:39.450> stock

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
woodson here just call the place stock

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.530 
woodson here just call the place stock
grab<00:01:40.590> Woodson<00:01:41.040> and<00:01:41.130> then<00:01:41.640> just<00:01:41.790> user<00:01:42.030> him<00:01:42.299> and

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
grab Woodson and then just user him and

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.969 
grab Woodson and then just user him and
you're<00:01:43.049> just<00:01:43.079> kind<00:01:43.229> of<00:01:43.350> going<00:01:43.469> to<00:01:43.560> lurk<00:01:43.799> the

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
you're just kind of going to lurk the

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.679 
you're just kind of going to lurk the
gap<00:01:44.159> so<00:01:44.369> that<00:01:44.399> was<00:01:44.670> poor<00:01:44.939> example<00:01:45.390> because<00:01:45.540> i'm

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
gap so that was poor example because i'm

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.249 
gap so that was poor example because i'm
using<00:01:45.719> two<00:01:46.049> controllers<00:01:46.939> but<00:01:47.939> basically<00:01:48.420> your

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
using two controllers but basically your

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.139 
using two controllers but basically your
job<00:01:49.530> with<00:01:49.710> Woodson<00:01:50.040> is<00:01:50.100> to<00:01:50.280> cover<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.729> room<00:01:50.850> so

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
job with Woodson is to cover the room so

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.060 
job with Woodson is to cover the room so
here<00:01:51.630> so<00:01:52.110> we'll<00:01:52.200> just<00:01:52.380> cover<00:01:52.500> right<00:01:52.799> into<00:01:52.979> the

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
here so we'll just cover right into the

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.560 
here so we'll just cover right into the
gap<00:01:53.250> here<00:01:53.579> and<00:01:53.759> I'm<00:01:53.880> just<00:01:54.030> trying<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.360> show<00:01:54.509> you

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
gap here and I'm just trying to show you

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.660 
gap here and I'm just trying to show you
the<00:01:54.719> concept<00:01:55.259> once<00:01:55.770> you're<00:01:55.950> in<00:01:56.070> game<00:01:56.340> it's<00:01:56.610> a

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
the concept once you're in game it's a

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:57.889 
the concept once you're in game it's a
lot<00:01:56.820> you<00:01:56.909> can<00:01:57.030> be<00:01:57.149> a<00:01:57.180> lot<00:01:57.299> more<00:01:57.360> aggressive

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
lot you can be a lot more aggressive

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.510 
lot you can be a lot more aggressive
because<00:01:58.049> all<00:01:58.350> you<00:01:58.409> have<00:01:58.530> to<00:01:58.590> do<00:01:58.710> is<00:01:58.890> tackle<00:01:59.310> the

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
because all you have to do is tackle the

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.539 
because all you have to do is tackle the
guy<00:01:59.670> but<00:02:00.329> here<00:02:00.630> again<00:02:00.890> you<00:02:01.890> see<00:02:02.100> right<00:02:02.280> here<00:02:02.460> at

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
guy but here again you see right here at

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.130 
guy but here again you see right here at
this<00:02:02.700> point<00:02:03.090> you<00:02:03.270> haven't<00:02:03.630> stopped<00:02:03.869> you<00:02:04.020> just

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
this point you haven't stopped you just

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.149 
this point you haven't stopped you just
gotta<00:02:04.289> get<00:02:04.439> up<00:02:04.530> there<00:02:04.680> and<00:02:04.710> make<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:04.950> tackle

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
gotta get up there and make the tackle

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.490 
gotta get up there and make the tackle
but<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.000> cool<00:02:06.149> part<00:02:06.390> about<00:02:06.420> this<00:02:06.810> is<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:07.229> zone

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
but the cool part about this is the zone

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.770 
but the cool part about this is the zone
run<00:02:07.829> is<00:02:08.160> really<00:02:08.850> ineffective<00:02:09.210> against<00:02:09.630> this

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
run is really ineffective against this

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.710 
run is really ineffective against this
play<00:02:10.050> again<00:02:10.770> zone<00:02:11.430> run<00:02:11.610> right<00:02:11.880> just<00:02:12.390> set<00:02:12.570> the

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
play again zone run right just set the

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.510 
play again zone run right just set the
edge<00:02:12.840> with<00:02:13.020> Woodson<00:02:13.440> and<00:02:13.560> you<00:02:14.010> have<00:02:14.190> you<00:02:14.430> know

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
edge with Woodson and you have you know

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.760 
edge with Woodson and you have you know
big<00:02:15.180> big<00:02:15.690> bodies<00:02:16.050> down<00:02:16.200> in<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:16.350> middle<00:02:16.530> they

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
big big bodies down in the middle they

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.950 
big big bodies down in the middle they
have<00:02:16.950> to<00:02:17.100> be<00:02:17.220> big<00:02:17.430> for<00:02:17.610> your<00:02:17.730> force<00:02:18.060> but<00:02:18.720> again

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
have to be big for your force but again

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.460 
have to be big for your force but again
it's<00:02:19.110> just<00:02:19.200> part<00:02:19.500> of<00:02:19.650> it

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
it's just part of it

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.790 
it's just part of it
so<00:02:21.370> here<00:02:21.550> again<00:02:21.580> zone<00:02:22.120> run<00:02:22.360> left<00:02:23.290> and<00:02:23.590> again

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
so here again zone run left and again

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.350 
so here again zone run left and again
just<00:02:24.010> I<00:02:24.250> have<00:02:24.490> to<00:02:24.550> be<00:02:24.850> able<00:02:24.970> to<00:02:25.150> tackle

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
just I have to be able to tackle

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.110 
just I have to be able to tackle

like the baseline if it's not a

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.560 
like the baseline if it's not a
compressed<00:02:50.770> set<00:02:50.950> as<00:02:51.100> well<00:02:51.310> but<00:02:52.090> again<00:02:52.300> here

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570
