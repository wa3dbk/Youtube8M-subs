 Hello and welcome to music before my name is Thomas AR

 he heard he had Stuhr installed 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.550
 First of all, the slums are coming out, and it's going to be a lot for us

 Sameshima Bern Worms 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.740
 the whole thing is to bring in a plan 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.210
 that is, we are dealing with Sander here 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:48.930
 how to call 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.700
 And in June we can have a concert here instead of one today 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.070
 Keywords are 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.070
 with whom we can control the whole thing 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.090

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.830

 and one from DW 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.890

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.410
 the whole 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.040
 is prepared very expensive 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.920
 one has to enter into dialogue is in the two stanzas study spaces 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.950
 recorded this went were recorded in a slightly smaller space 3 bit 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.950
 the monument sounds even better 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.350

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:45.390
 he is used
