the<00:02:08.099> jet<00:02:08.340> was<00:02:08.520> 150<00:02:09.560> so<00:02:10.560> we<00:02:10.649> need<00:02:10.770> to<00:02:10.830> go<00:02:10.920> from

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
the jet was 150 so we need to go from

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.730 
the jet was 150 so we need to go from
the<00:02:11.160> fourth<00:02:11.400> level<00:02:11.550> down<00:02:11.730> to<00:02:11.790> one

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
the fourth level down to one

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.820 
the fourth level down to one
2<00:02:13.120> 3<00:02:14.120> 4<00:02:15.130> 4th<00:02:16.130> level<00:02:16.280> down<00:02:16.550> from<00:02:16.790> the<00:02:16.880> top

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
2 3 4 4th level down from the top

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.010 
2 3 4 4th level down from the top
because<00:02:18.830> when<00:02:19.340> you<00:02:19.460> measure<00:02:19.640> these<00:02:20.030> the<00:02:20.780> top

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
because when you measure these the top

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.340 
because when you measure these the top
notch<00:02:21.230> is<00:02:21.500> always<00:02:21.770> one<00:02:22.040> here<00:02:23.080> it's<00:02:24.080> hard<00:02:24.230> to

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
notch is always one here it's hard to

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.920 
notch is always one here it's hard to
get<00:02:24.440> it<00:02:24.530> real<00:02:24.680> close<00:02:24.710> to<00:02:25.160> camera<00:02:25.660> app<00:02:26.660> top

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
get it real close to camera app top

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.190 
get it real close to camera app top
notch<00:02:27.410> right<00:02:27.680> there<00:02:28.390> that's<00:02:29.390> one<00:02:29.720> right<00:02:29.990> there

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
notch right there that's one right there

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.510 
notch right there that's one right there
there<00:02:30.560> you<00:02:30.650> go<00:02:30.770> not<00:02:31.070> focused<00:02:32.500> so<00:02:33.500> there<00:02:34.430> you<00:02:34.490> go

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
there you go not focused so there you go

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.260 
there you go not focused so there you go
just<00:02:35.330> push<00:02:35.540> that<00:02:35.750> in<00:02:35.980> sometimes<00:02:36.980> you<00:02:37.220> may<00:02:37.370> need
