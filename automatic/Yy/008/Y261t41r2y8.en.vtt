00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 hi people thanks for turning on 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.820
 We want to have a look at the complete camera 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.860
 View app on the sony xperia z3 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.219
 the seeker goes over the complete picture 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.139
 bottom left find like three dots with it 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.080
 we call up the settings 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.430
 divided into photo video and normal 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.410
 Settings, we can do something like that here 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.930
 adjust as the aspect ratio 16 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.840
 to 9 eg we can use the self-timer 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.550
 set the smile shutter we can 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.529
 watch if we have the preview so one 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.719
 want to have a preview and so on 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.860
 the same game is similar in that case 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.870
 again with the video 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.420
 You can also listen to the microphone, for example 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.860
 and off and on the far right there are 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.050
 then even more options for 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.420
 for example , a geologist 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.950
 Add that to the position 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.050
 Of course we can too 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.670
 Switch front camera and to main camera 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.640
 back and then we still have that 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.920
 shortcut for the flash red reduction 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.800
 So we do not want to have red eyes 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.930
 okay flashlight on or off and such 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.359
 lower right there had been going 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.549
 all the modes we have on it 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.110
 you can download more 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.490
 we do not all want each other 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.590
 then see through this video 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.090
 But that's how long it gets 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.220
 most important here for example is the 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.409
 forcam reality of course we can 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.020
 take videos in advance a test video 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.330
 I have already uploaded too 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.729
 if that's not enough we can 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.100
 of course download more on the 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.720
 red point we solve a video from us 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.970
 can press on pause and later 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.829
 continue film in the same video or us 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.909
 just stop completely with it 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:40.189
 the square yes that was the construction of many 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.189
 thanks for your time it's good
