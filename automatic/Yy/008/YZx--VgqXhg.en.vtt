00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 hello how good now let's see a 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.319
 little the purpose of cleaning powers 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.599
 each other as to chain and be able 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.450
 go adding the powers the purpose 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.009
 Well, obviously, it's better to connect 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.049
 number of speakers we can know all 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.870
 a theoretical line but let's see how 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.060
 we execute it in practice 

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:22.470
 here we have two good powers that are 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.730
 link that you speak link that you speak 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.850
 means that we have the 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.670
 connectors like to be able to do it 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:32.099
 all the powers offer it here 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.280
 we have the tickets 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:40.250
 we have females and males a bit like 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:43.410
 to guide us good here we have the 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:47.070
 entry from where we're going to come with the 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:50.010
 equalizer or the compactera are the 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.530
 tickets the best way to guide us in 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.860
 the canon is that when we see the points 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.510
 as in the cable is we have to 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.559
 make the signal is good no longer 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.589
 we have to make the idea that the 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.989
 signal comes when we see the 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:05.909
 points and when we have the female that the 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.820
 signal should enter say that this 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:12.420
 it would be an entrance that we do then 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:17.159
 with two wireless powers we put in 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:21.480
 the same input an output connector and 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:24.700
 we connect it to the input of the other 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:27.790
 power we are on channel 2 and we 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:32.560
 we go to channel 2 in the same way 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:34.360
 then we go to the other exit that does not 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.940
 it's an exit but if it's not a link 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.400
 compare another power and connect it 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:41.280
 here we have connected the two 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.680
 powers 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.790
 we have to do the talking output 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:50.310
 both this above and the one below 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:52.049
 do not expect the powers add up is 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.140
 say we are adding the two powers 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:58.500
 but do not wait for this power of 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.270
 above send the summation cables 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.580
 the power below and get out of the 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.490
 speakers of the below with the powers 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.440
 added is to say yes if we have 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.600
 example thousand watts up and millwall 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.970
 down we will not have in the output of 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.250
 speakers two thousand watts down here not 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.870
 we will have a thousand here below and a thousand here 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.950
 up is to say that we have to leave 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.120
 with the speakers here for 811 four 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.560
 we are depending on the amount of 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.900
 speakers that we want to put the 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.400
 number of speakers and we left here 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.159
 also with a thousand watts 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.830
 with 4 or 8 months depending on what 

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:34.050
 we want to put 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.690
 we are working with two thousand watts 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.880
 but we have four speaker outputs 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.720
 no 2 is to say that if we want to drive 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.720
 a 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:46.270
 a charge of two thousand watts as to 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.820
 put in a single exit or in only in 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:51.130
 two exits we will not have a thousand here and 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:54.100
 thousand here the advantage of cleaning 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:57.070
 powers and add them is that if we have 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:03:00.370
 potencies pairs that is to say of greater or 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:03.190
 We can work with less power 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:06.790
 balancedly that is to say if we 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:10.600
 we want to put eight baffles ie 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:12.430
 four left and four the right and 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.250
 let's make the example that we have 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:18.970
 powers of different intensities is 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:22.950
 say we have 1,500 watts down here 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:26.950
 and we have half 750 websites here 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:31.060
 in total we will have two thousand 250 in 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:33.700
 total but let's get out of the 750's 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.220
 we take a load according to what we say 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.760
 we can put 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:42.660
 one baffle on each side of 500 watts or 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:44.700
 400 large in 811 watts and below the 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.800
 we already work with a higher load than 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.510
 we can put if we have the same 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.760
 baffles we can put two per side is 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.730
 say we're going to charge it with 1000 watts 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:56.190
 for the viola we work in 4 or more of that 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.950
 way we have 2 thousand 250 in total and 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:01.620
 let's have 6 speakers let's have one 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:03.570
 from the left side of here up and 2 of 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.480
 the power down the same side say 3 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:08.850
 on the side and this side we have a baffle of 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:11.430
 the power from above and 2 baffles the 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:13.640
 power down 3 per side and the 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:16.739
 difference that will not be working 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.180
 overloaded is not very light this 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.830
 they will work at the ideal temperature 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.870
 the two and we give you volume control 

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:24.120
 according to what we want each one 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.970
 the two above that we are going to have as 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.710
 a lower power because we are at 750 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:32.100
 well we can use it in some 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:34.650
 places where we need a dispersion 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:37.080
 and the strongest cited of good work what 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.390
 we locate in places like stronger 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.810
 we have the summation of the powers 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:42.850
 but always remember 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.010
 the output of speakers is only for the 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:49.440
 two now after we're going to see it in a 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:49.440
 theoretical example let's see
