the<00:00:03.920> other<00:00:04.040> day<00:00:04.310> I<00:00:04.340> was

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:08.889 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:20.850 

open<00:00:09.549> which

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:20.860 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:22.950 

good<00:00:21.010> question<00:00:21.640> because

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:22.960 
good question because

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:40.540 
good question because
push<00:00:23.439> air

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:54.040 

right<00:00:41.060> now<00:00:41.270> we're<00:00:41.510> looking<00:00:41.660> down

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.470 

how<00:00:54.380> I<00:00:54.410> do<00:00:54.680> it

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:58.480 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:04.010 

what<00:00:58.870> I<00:00:58.899> have<00:00:59.230> is<00:00:59.440> this<00:00:59.620> separate<00:01:00.160> below

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:04.020 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:10.030 

provide<00:01:04.470> block

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:29.520 

I'm<00:01:10.280> up<00:01:10.490> computer

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:39.350 

coming<00:01:29.830> up<00:01:29.979> near<00:01:30.310> the<00:01:30.490> beat

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.760 

what<00:01:39.510> I'm<00:01:39.660> doing<00:01:39.690> when<00:01:40.470> I

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
what I'm doing when I

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.639 
what I'm doing when I
I<00:01:41.399> don't<00:01:41.759> know<00:01:41.850> if<00:01:41.969> I<00:01:42.060> can<00:01:42.119> show<00:01:42.990> this<00:01:43.320> and

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
I don't know if I can show this and

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.969 
I don't know if I can show this and
shoot<00:01:44.100> it<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:44.490> everything<00:01:44.909> but<00:01:45.829> basically<00:01:46.829> I

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
shoot it and everything but basically I

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.770 
shoot it and everything but basically I
put<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.369> piece<00:01:47.609> of<00:01:47.670> tape<00:01:47.850> across

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.010 

and<00:01:51.780> if<00:01:51.960> I<00:01:52.110> block<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.950> air

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.620 

on<00:01:56.290> the<00:01:56.710> fire<00:01:56.950> respond<00:01:57.549> now<00:01:57.850> of<00:01:57.970> course<00:01:58.180> I

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
on the fire respond now of course I

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.870 
on the fire respond now of course I
don't<00:01:59.320> know<00:01:59.590> if<00:01:59.680> you<00:01:59.799> can<00:01:59.950> see<00:02:00.220> the<00:02:00.399> sparks

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
don't know if you can see the sparks

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.590 
don't know if you can see the sparks
coming<00:02:01.299> up<00:02:01.570> the<00:02:01.750> feet

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
coming up the feet

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.360 
coming up the feet
that's<00:02:04.600> exactly<00:02:05.260> what<00:02:05.440> you<00:02:05.560> don't<00:02:05.830> want<00:02:06.250> to

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:06.370 
that's exactly what you don't want to

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.139 
that's exactly what you don't want to
have<00:02:06.580> happen

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.949 

this<00:02:10.890> arrangement<00:02:11.890> is

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
this arrangement is

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.020 
this arrangement is
for<00:02:14.439> that<00:02:14.590> reason<00:02:14.620> kind<00:02:15.250> of<00:02:15.340> dangerous<00:02:15.730> he

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
for that reason kind of dangerous he

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:21.270 
for that reason kind of dangerous he
blow<00:02:16.239> sparks<00:02:16.780> up<00:02:16.989> into<00:02:17.439> the<00:02:17.590> feet

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.070 

fire<00:02:21.760> in<00:02:22.030> your<00:02:22.210> chip<00:02:22.420> would<00:02:22.690> get<00:02:22.900> them

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
fire in your chip would get them

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:31.380 
fire in your chip would get them
ultimately<00:02:26.080> the<00:02:29.100> system<00:02:30.100> will<00:02:30.550> change<00:02:30.970> and

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
ultimately the system will change and

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.190 
ultimately the system will change and
I'll<00:02:31.480> use<00:02:31.690> negative<00:02:31.990> pressure<00:02:32.590> inside<00:02:33.190> and

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
I'll use negative pressure inside and

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.980 
I'll use negative pressure inside and
what<00:02:35.200> I'll<00:02:35.350> do<00:02:35.590> is<00:02:35.910> over<00:02:36.910> the<00:02:37.090> top<00:02:37.360> of<00:02:37.690> the

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 
what I'll do is over the top of the

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.220 
what I'll do is over the top of the
barrel

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
barrel

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:47.340 
barrel
I'll<00:02:41.230> put<00:02:41.800> an<00:02:43.230> upper<00:02:44.230> section<00:02:45.780> so<00:02:46.780> that<00:02:46.810> it's

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
I'll put an upper section so that it's

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.920 
I'll put an upper section so that it's
pulling<00:02:47.950> air<00:02:48.160> out<00:02:48.430> of<00:02:48.489> the<00:02:49.090> top<00:02:49.300> of<00:02:49.360> the<00:02:49.720> heat

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
pulling air out of the top of the heat

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.010 
pulling air out of the top of the heat
exchanger<00:02:50.770> and<00:02:51.010> then<00:02:51.970> that<00:02:52.150> will<00:02:52.330> suck<00:02:52.720> air

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 
exchanger and then that will suck air

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.060 
exchanger and then that will suck air
into<00:02:53.860> the<00:02:54.520> burner<00:02:54.790> and<00:02:55.390> then<00:02:56.319> once<00:02:56.530> I'm<00:02:56.739> doing

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
into the burner and then once I'm doing

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:01.830 
into the burner and then once I'm doing
that<00:02:57.310> I<00:02:57.340> won't<00:02:57.730> need<00:02:59.459> the<00:03:00.459> main<00:03:00.730> blower<00:03:01.120> which

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
that I won't need the main blower which

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:08.009 
that I won't need the main blower which
is<00:03:02.019> down<00:03:02.260> there<00:03:03.570> blowing<00:03:04.570> air<00:03:04.780> in<00:03:05.590> to<00:03:06.870> see<00:03:07.870> if<00:03:07.930> I

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
is down there blowing air in to see if I

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:11.960 
is down there blowing air in to see if I
can<00:03:08.200> see<00:03:08.410> it

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.120 

you<00:03:12.510> know<00:03:12.600> there's<00:03:12.960> the<00:03:13.380> bottom<00:03:13.830> of<00:03:14.010> the

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
you know there's the bottom of the

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.320 
you know there's the bottom of the
burner<00:03:14.370> barrel<00:03:14.910> and<00:03:15.210> the<00:03:16.140> air<00:03:16.350> inlet<00:03:16.980> to<00:03:17.430> is<00:03:18.240> a

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
burner barrel and the air inlet to is a

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:23.720 
burner barrel and the air inlet to is a
little<00:03:19.670> small<00:03:20.670> computer<00:03:22.010> muffin<00:03:23.010> fan<00:03:23.340> but

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
little small computer muffin fan but

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.470 
little small computer muffin fan but
then<00:03:23.880> there's<00:03:24.150> this<00:03:24.450> big<00:03:24.510> blower<00:03:26.120> with<00:03:27.120> a<00:03:27.150> gap

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
then there's this big blower with a gap

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.450 
then there's this big blower with a gap
between<00:03:27.780> the<00:03:28.200> two<00:03:28.230> and<00:03:28.770> I<00:03:28.830> just<00:03:29.070> kind<00:03:29.340> of

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:29.460 
between the two and I just kind of

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:32.120 
between the two and I just kind of
adjust<00:03:29.880> the<00:03:30.150> gap<00:03:30.390> until<00:03:30.900> I<00:03:30.930> get<00:03:31.260> the<00:03:31.740> pressure

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
adjust the gap until I get the pressure

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.750 
adjust the gap until I get the pressure
that<00:03:32.490> I<00:03:32.550> want<00:03:32.910> inside<00:03:34.280> so<00:03:35.280> that's<00:03:35.490> the

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
that I want inside so that's the

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.490 
that I want inside so that's the
positive<00:03:35.970> pressure<00:03:36.660> and<00:03:37.050> then<00:03:37.170> I<00:03:37.200> need<00:03:37.470> to

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
positive pressure and then I need to

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.460 
positive pressure and then I need to
balance<00:03:37.860> that<00:03:38.850> with<00:03:39.300> the<00:03:39.450> second<00:03:40.020> blower<00:03:40.200> up

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
balance that with the second blower up

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.300 
balance that with the second blower up
here<00:03:41.180> flowing<00:03:42.180> in<00:03:42.300> the<00:03:42.420> feed<00:03:42.630> tube<00:03:43.100> so<00:03:44.100> what<00:03:44.280> I

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
here flowing in the feed tube so what I

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.910 
here flowing in the feed tube so what I
did<00:03:44.459> is<00:03:45.090> basically<00:03:45.840> what<00:03:46.140> I<00:03:46.170> was<00:03:46.350> doing<00:03:46.770> with

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
did is basically what I was doing with

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:53.020 
did is basically what I was doing with
my<00:03:46.950> hand<00:03:47.490> of<00:03:49.400> partially<00:03:50.400> covering

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
my hand of partially covering

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.290 
my hand of partially covering
this<00:03:53.690> but<00:03:54.140> doing<00:03:54.500> it<00:03:54.620> with<00:03:54.680> a<00:03:54.800> piece<00:03:55.100> of<00:03:55.300> tape

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:56.300 
this but doing it with a piece of tape

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:00.670 
this but doing it with a piece of tape
and<00:03:57.220> then<00:03:58.220> when<00:03:58.400> I<00:03:58.430> got<00:03:58.730> the<00:03:58.970> air<00:03:59.150> to<00:03:59.569> where<00:03:59.780> it

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
and then when I got the air to where it

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:13.780 
and then when I got the air to where it
was<00:04:00.890> all<00:04:01.580> the<00:04:02.030> blowing

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.560 

and<00:04:14.209> yet<00:04:14.540> not<00:04:14.959> not<00:04:15.860> too<00:04:16.250> much<00:04:16.459> so<00:04:16.790> another

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
and yet not not too much so another

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.060 
and yet not not too much so another
No

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
No
