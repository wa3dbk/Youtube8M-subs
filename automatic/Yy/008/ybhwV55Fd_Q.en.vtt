the small wing area because you know I
went<00:01:13.290> in<00:01:13.409> scale<00:01:13.680> cause<00:01:13.979> I<00:01:14.010> like<00:01:14.310> my<00:01:14.340> aircraft

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
went in scale cause I like my aircraft

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.840 
went in scale cause I like my aircraft
skill<00:01:15.150> I<00:01:15.360> don't<00:01:15.990> like<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.380> rub<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:16.740> power<00:01:17.009> to

I had to keep the scale not used to make
you<00:01:23.970> know<00:01:24.090> any<00:01:24.270> plane<00:01:24.570> appeal<00:01:25.340> yes<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.640> it<00:01:26.790> is

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
you know any plane appeal yes the it is

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.030 
you know any plane appeal yes the it is
a<00:01:26.970> little<00:01:27.150> hard<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.540> fly<00:01:27.720> because<00:01:28.229> again<00:01:28.860> it's

a little hard to fly because again it's
a<00:01:29.130> scale<00:01:29.400> but<00:01:30.180> I'm<00:01:30.390> kind<00:01:30.600> of<00:01:30.689> used<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.049> it<00:01:31.140> so<00:01:31.530> I

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
a scale but I'm kind of used to it so I

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.560 
a scale but I'm kind of used to it so I
fight<00:01:32.520> it<00:01:32.729> like<00:01:32.759> I'll<00:01:33.000> fly<00:01:33.210> any<00:01:33.360> other

enough to have him on this plane because

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.539 
enough to have him on this plane because
on<00:02:39.450> you<00:02:39.629> know<00:02:39.750> on<00:02:39.900> this<00:02:40.140> aircraft<00:02:40.709> with<00:02:41.250> only

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:41.549 
on you know on this aircraft with only

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:45.199 
on you know on this aircraft with only
two<00:02:41.879> control<00:02:42.209> surfaces<00:02:43.010> if<00:02:44.010> I<00:02:44.220> lose<00:02:44.489> one<00:02:44.519> you

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
two control surfaces if I lose one you

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.600 
two control surfaces if I lose one you
know<00:02:45.360> it's<00:02:45.900> not<00:02:46.110> turning<00:02:46.799> back<00:02:46.950> you<00:02:47.250> know<00:02:47.370> from

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
know it's not turning back you know from

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.460 
know it's not turning back you know from
it<00:02:47.730> so<00:02:48.209> that's<00:02:48.569> what<00:02:48.750> I<00:02:48.780> went<00:02:48.989> with<00:02:49.140> something

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
it so that's what I went with something

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.729 
it so that's what I went with something
that<00:02:49.590> I<00:02:49.620> trust<00:02:49.950> that<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:51.329> linkage<00:02:52.079> you<00:02:52.380> know

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
that I trust that the linkage you know

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.940 
that I trust that the linkage you know
between<00:02:52.890> the<00:02:53.040> servo<00:02:53.930> and<00:02:54.930> the<00:02:55.620> control

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
between the servo and the control

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.740 
between the servo and the control
surfaces<00:02:56.400> but<00:02:56.670> about<00:02:57.000> an<00:02:57.150> inch<00:02:57.299> on<00:02:57.540> it<00:02:57.660> so

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
surfaces but about an inch on it so

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.869 
surfaces but about an inch on it so
there<00:02:57.900> is<00:02:57.959> no<00:02:58.019> no<00:02:58.799> slack<00:02:59.160> on<00:02:59.400> as<00:02:59.519> you<00:02:59.610> can<00:02:59.730> see

00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 
there is no no slack on as you can see

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:01.309 
there is no no slack on as you can see
right<00:03:00.000> there<00:03:00.030> I<00:03:00.360> mean<00:03:00.599> you<00:03:00.750> move<00:03:01.049> the<00:03:01.170> whole

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
right there I mean you move the whole

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:02.960 
right there I mean you move the whole
table<00:03:01.560> when<00:03:01.769> you<00:03:01.860> touch<00:03:02.069> it<00:03:02.099> there<00:03:02.730> is<00:03:02.819> no

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
table when you touch it there is no

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.390 
table when you touch it there is no
slack<00:03:03.180> on<00:03:03.420> it

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
slack on it

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.280 
slack on it
so<00:03:05.400> let's<00:03:05.579> pretty<00:03:05.760> much<00:03:05.910> of<00:03:06.060> all<00:03:06.269> you<00:03:07.140> know<00:03:07.260> all
