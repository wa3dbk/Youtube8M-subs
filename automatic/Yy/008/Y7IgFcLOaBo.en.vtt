not<00:03:57.520> the<00:03:57.580> first<00:03:57.820> time<00:03:57.970> but<00:03:58.090> each<00:03:58.360> time<00:03:58.390> it's<00:03:58.810> a

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
not the first time but each time it's a

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.650 
not the first time but each time it's a
little<00:03:59.470> bit<00:03:59.560> like<00:03:59.800> the<00:04:00.010> first<00:04:00.190> time<00:04:00.460> all<00:04:00.790> right

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660
