00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:29.470
 your experiences 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:32.050
 I am a trainee at lidl 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.660

 working foundation in logistics department 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:53.530
 I also found it very good in 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.540
 to start the branch because that is 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.409
 the cordis it is important that 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:02.519
 Get to know the seller first 

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:04.930
 thunders branch manager and then as 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:08.260
 sales manager then the sales manager 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:12.400
 on average 54 years, 120 employees like that 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:14.650
 Something they are responsible for when they are 25 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.479
 Years are so that's incredible 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.280
 then take care of two more 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:20.680
 had to get to know departments there 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.320
 a thorough training was then 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.570
 also a month in Belgium abroad 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.640

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.650
 second three-month stays abroad 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.090
 Netherlands belgium was one for me 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.350
 great experience for my 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.820
 foreign stays have netherlands 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.469
 I have a special problem-sets consisting of 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.479
 I can find it in my department 

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:39.759
 a great thing that I mean so early 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:40.929
 own projects and was allowed in the 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:43.270
 framework of the project my 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:45.100
 Determine the procedure yourself because you 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.109
 just at the end also very proud of yourself 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.329
 if you can go to the store 

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:52.329
 Goes and sees me like that 

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:54.460
 A customer reports best 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:56.100
 came to me and asked before 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.409
 where are the choice of gloves unis 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.270
 Okay, so sell now 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:02.530
 no question of gloves straight through 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.640
 the experiences I have in the store 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.920
 could collect 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.510
 like the work you do yourself 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.500
 the end of a branch arrives the 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.500
 required by 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:20.560
 why are the books so the market 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.740
 seriously, it is also fast 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.770
 change and that's why we have very flexible 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:29.200
 Employees as a trainee do not learn 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:31.180
 only different areas know but 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.680
 Also, many people like a tear phase 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.810
 I was able to make many contacts 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.239
 I'll look at everyone in five years 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.040
 case in a managerial position though 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:40.959
 a really interesting one for me 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.850
 experience i have learned a lot i can 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:45.370
 works in poland but i think so too 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.830
 Other countries work is still 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.390
 a project area with several 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.880
 growing responsibility for me 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.459
 personally, that means many 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.290
 I will be able to set up opportunities 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:57.760

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.659
