00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:15.539
 134 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.900
 to give you the exact point you are 23 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.900
 seconds 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.099
 the sample I know how to turn 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.280
 without fear without fear 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:44.430
 around and around like you were 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.640
 s 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:52.520

 account for how many a single 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.050
 let's put him 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.290

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.940
 wrong 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.940
 but as the path of the heart says 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:24.680
 until the grenade that what up 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:29.110
 that the band moving against 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.110
 the output of 2 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.630
 after 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.070
 He said 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.409
 that's called farewell
