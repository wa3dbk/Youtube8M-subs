00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:13.700
 March 20, then six-thirty. 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:15.530
 six themes the moon enters the new phase and 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.470
 shortly thereafter after ten minutes 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:20.540
 we are going to have a total solar eclipse 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:22.490
 it must be said that it will not be visible in the 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:25.070
 Brazil, but we have resources 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.230
 technology to be able to watch 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:31.070
 also on that same day March 20 , 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.960
 1944 begins the autumnal equinox in the 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.160
 Southern Hemisphere and that our 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.500
 North hemisphere 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.500
 and this area is dark red 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:42.050
 is the area where the total eclipse will be 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.820
 so you see that very few people 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.980
 No one can see full eclipse. 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:49.370
 not if you 're in the middle of the ocean game 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:52.129
 our room but it really is is well to the north 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:55.550
 some regions for example in the north 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:58.039
 europe the staff can already see part 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.170
 of northern Russia, you can also see 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:01.850
 is there a staff that is not located 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.630
 in the center of europe that will see more or 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:08.930
 least 40% of the solar disk covered by 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:11.330
 moon that will see a little piece of the north 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.250
 Africa will also have this 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.819
 It's cool because all these regions are 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.709
 is and has some observatory 

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:22.310
 get out in the middle of people who usually 

00:01:18.709 --> 00:01:25.310
 broadcast live is events in case the 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:29.149
 90% parent eclipse is very tiny 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:32.509
 which is not a very small track but 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:34.490
 in this range of up to 90% here it is getting 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:36.619
 quite of europe, right? 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.050
 so I really want to live 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:42.800
 but as you can see the white part 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:44.959
 is where the eclipse will not be visible there 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:48.289
 people can clearly see that the 

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:51.530
 most of the planet in fife the eclipse 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:56.179
 tarpon the schedule. the Brazilian for whom 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:58.310
 want to keep up with ceesay c 46 this that 

00:01:56.179 --> 00:02:00.229
 I already convert that time to Brazil. 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.690
 since it is the maximum moment of the eclipse 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:05.030
 when are you can have that 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.500
 more beautiful moment than in the case of total 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:10.190
 when the moon completely enters the 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.959
 front of the sun and proportional is when the 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.180
 as much as possible 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:16.850
 covered by the moon person can give a 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:20.450
 week and write down the addresses 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.739
 that will broadcast live 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.810
 the research that the staff is 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:25.580
 organizing they usually put a 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.430
 shim down is a countdown 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:31.099
 on the Copa side nine days so many hours in 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.810
 minutes to start broadcasting then 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:35.720
 there are some who start the transmission 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:38.150
 before, because of the longitude 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.620
 this is an event that happens before 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.840
 certain place to later happen 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.030
 in another and some like you said them 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.670
 make a lot of comments they make 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.620
 round area professionals talking 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.319
 about eclipse is very interesting 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.959
 watch what else I believe it will 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:56.360
 thus having the largest share of the in covered 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:59.049
 from the sun is the last address because it is in the 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.049
 UK
