Donna from Etobicoke rights how come
when<00:00:11.460> i<00:00:11.490> turn<00:00:11.820> my<00:00:12.000> camera<00:00:12.330> lens<00:00:12.599> to<00:00:12.840> let<00:00:12.990> in

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
when i turn my camera lens to let in

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.350 
when i turn my camera lens to let in
less<00:00:13.349> light<00:00:13.679> the<00:00:14.280> f-number<00:00:14.700> gets<00:00:15.059> bigger

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
less light the f-number gets bigger

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.210 
less light the f-number gets bigger
shouldn't<00:00:16.139> the<00:00:16.199> number<00:00:16.440> get<00:00:16.590> smaller<00:00:16.949> for

shouldn't the number get smaller for
less<00:00:17.400> it's<00:00:18.270> just<00:00:18.390> stupid<00:00:18.660> or<00:00:19.050> what<00:00:19.340> well<00:00:20.340> Donna

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
less it's just stupid or what well Donna

tissue paper and that's the same

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.410 
tissue paper and that's the same
situation<00:00:59.309> where<00:00:59.430> every<00:00:59.879> point<00:01:00.120> on<00:01:00.270> that
