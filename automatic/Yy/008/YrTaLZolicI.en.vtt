 canal of paolo brava a channel with gods 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.889
 DIY videos in the field 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:16.740
 electronic computerized mechanical e 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.690
 culinary this is a great channel 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.750
 because you can't even imagine that 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.699
 what can be done and remedied and spit 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.890
 old computers and equipment 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.220
 various electronics or equipment 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.220
 electrical 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.300
 good morning to all the movie of today vi 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:48.300
 let's see how to remove the door 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.750
 of the oven to this model of oven that 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.570
 a smart ice oven will send as 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.150
 you can see on this type of hinges 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.760
 there is no easel to be able 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:02.040
 use to facilitate the operation 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.840
 given we sign the precedents we have 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.860
 always talked about these easels that 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:11.420
 they could be opened but there is help 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:16.320
 this hole present in this point 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:18.619
 so with the help of two pieces of 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.410
 wire 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:30.140
 in fact in this way inserting them in the 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:35.149
 hole and squeezing them together 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.149
 both parts of the hinge 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.160
 you have to tighten them 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:50.960
 but this operation must be done either a 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.960
 left than right 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.099
 here's how you have one 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.920
 fixed in these two iron films 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:22.300
 must be a door engaging in 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:25.220
 this way and pulling upwards 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:28.730
 in every year a bit of strength because 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:31.870
 springs are are quite hard 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:34.870
 this movement becomes slaves but le 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.870
 22 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:39.230
 the two women 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.940
 here once we removed the 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.650
 then brings it right to do all the 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.290
 operations that also the operations of 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.569
 cleaning that inside or police glass 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.660
 replacement of papal hinges is 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:52.700
 if these were defective us 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.819
 let's see how to refit the door 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:03:02.239
 of the oven leaving the iron wires that 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:04.220
 they put at the beginning we approach and 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:06.560
 we begin to insert the parts first 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:11.510
 longer than the hinge those hook 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:20.630
 in the upper slot after part one 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:22.940
 lord of the spring once he warns the 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.220
 spring we can like to see iron wires 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:28.609
 they are no longer the intention we can 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:33.609
 remove and so were known in 

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:33.609
 use the oven as before 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:19.630
 so now the door is free ha 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:21.640
 worked with me on the bench for today 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.160
 thank you for your attention and see you at 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:26.820
 next video and don't forget mixed 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.820
