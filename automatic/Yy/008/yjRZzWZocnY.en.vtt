00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:04.930
 good I am I am brands to explain you 

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:07.450
 another side although it is what touches the 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:09.190
 Thursday before explaining that where to 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:11.349
 everyone will remind you that I am going to 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.120
 leave a label for here to the video of 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:15.639
 holding 1500 sushi of the 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.230
 2,000 users of the forum of constan that 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:21.820
 is a forum dedicated exclusively to 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:23.410
 pc games and the forum that the wii the 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:27.660
 side that I'm going to explain today is going to be the 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:29.910
 gladiator cs a that is one where pvp 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.040
 and the only thing he does is a very 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.460
 simple but that for me is pretty 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.710
 useful is he sings us the cults he uses 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.910
 the other one was shot by train that 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:45.390
 accept linke and everything says anne or pulls 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.489
 from rangel says of terrance to there is 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.530
 put the link that you are told of 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.989
 terrance down 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.600
 one I call betty to the voice in what 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.610
 and never at times it is very very heavy to me 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.580
 it does not bother me there are many people who have 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.399
 said that sometimes it bothers a lot that 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:06.180
 well I'm going to put a couple of examples 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:09.300
 now and then I put you I explain how 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:12.050
 configure it to work as you 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.050
 like you 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.140
 supporting 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.140
 we go 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.200
 Well, to configure it, it's very 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.910
 simple or the traditional technique of going 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.360
 to the configuration of an add-on that 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:03.870
 escape interface 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.870
 to 2 and here's the kick back be the 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.759
 first time or ask that the load be no 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.440
 none of this will neither more nor nothing shall 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:14.700
 the little button will appear in red click 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:16.710
 and you get this good, here goes the 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.050
 General which is what concerns us 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:22.020
 all to a very important thing week 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:25.080
 tell you if you do not like English 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:27.570
 translations there are in Russian German 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.760
 and French as we are more interested in 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.620
 German French and Russian I never play in 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:35.540
 English even if the skills something the 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:38.340
 most but in Russian and German in French 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.320
 good here in general the first thing that there 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.730
 is this I'm going to remove it because you've 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.560
 said that in videos sometimes you 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.320
 listen more to this than to me bye bye 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.220
 old age here is the volume itself 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.220
 wants to get off what 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:52.500
 the voice 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:01.890
 he has sung speedlite 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:06.349
 far away from there this is so that 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:09.000
 do not activate do not say do not speak when 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:11.909
 In a short time he will say many things 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.340
 with an option that is pretty good 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:17.730
 then here in abilities in the menu 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:20.550
 British here you can start now 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.080
 set everything up if there are drawings that 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:25.890
 we want to tell , for example, 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:30.660
 Earth shield is a bit silly that what 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:32.550
 say then take off just like me I know 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.380
 the edge storm this east looks 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:37.240
 exaggerated that is when several gets to 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:39.550
 spin around that looks silly 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:42.010
 it seems only when I do not know it well 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:45.130
 we go with more times nothing here you can 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:48.190
 well that you say only the target 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:52.270
 of the focus that warns when they drink in 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:54.460
 sands in the bufos that throw everything 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:57.340
 Here you can remove and put everything 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:04:01.870
 you want then a custom and nothing this is 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:05.650
 to put on your sound if you want and that 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:07.390
 that this does not come to me or to me 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.880
 I with the sounds he has already 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.770
 it seems pretty good and profile be what 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.770
 typical of the configuration a character 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:16.840
 and why do you put the name here 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:20.320
 you want to accept that it is a 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.970
 you keep it with everything you have 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.390
 here and then you can upload it to the 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:27.160
 other characters that you put copy of 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:30.490
 you choose which one you want and it's typical 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:32.380
 to the configuration does not have much but 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:35.040
 it's quite because the donate is not 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:38.010
 that is exaggerated the options that it has 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:41.850
 a very useful add-on especially in sands 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:43.680
 when you are you do not see one of these or 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:48.450
 who gets to drink that make me black 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:51.070
 I get to drink a 500 sand have 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:55.150
 rate if I go to look for it although I 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:58.060
 and nothing is that nothing with this finished the 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:00.100
 Today's video just remind you to look 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.990
 the video of the celebration tomorrow 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:06.610

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:10.150

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:12.100
