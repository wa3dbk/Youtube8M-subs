tacular but all with technical fabrics

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.380 
tacular but all with technical fabrics
with<00:00:39.309> a<00:00:39.370> lot<00:00:39.520> of<00:00:40.350> functional<00:00:41.350> details<00:00:42.360> so<00:00:43.360> I

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:43.390 
with a lot of functional details so I

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:44.970 
with a lot of functional details so I
asked<00:00:43.840> him<00:00:43.960> to<00:00:44.140> meet<00:00:44.290> the<00:00:44.350> guy<00:00:44.650> who<00:00:44.680> designed

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:44.980 
asked him to meet the guy who designed

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.330 
asked him to meet the guy who designed
that<00:00:45.250> and<00:00:45.550> and<00:00:46.449> by<00:00:47.050> the<00:00:47.080> way<00:00:47.320> I<00:00:47.680> discovered

work<00:00:51.250> so<00:00:51.820> we<00:00:51.970> start<00:00:52.210> immediately<00:00:52.750> working

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:53.020 
work so we start immediately working

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.270 
work so we start immediately working
