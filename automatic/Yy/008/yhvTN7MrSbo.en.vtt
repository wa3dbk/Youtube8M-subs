in<00:00:22.030> my<00:00:22.150> mind<00:00:22.810> of<00:00:23.470> 110<00:00:24.070> inches<00:00:24.340> is<00:00:24.490> the<00:00:24.580> same

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:24.790 
in my mind of 110 inches is the same

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:27.540 
in my mind of 110 inches is the same
wheelbase<00:00:25.000> as<00:00:25.390> my<00:00:25.540> LJ<00:00:26.020> which<00:00:26.650> I've<00:00:27.040> grown<00:00:27.340> to

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:27.550 
wheelbase as my LJ which I've grown to

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.880 
wheelbase as my LJ which I've grown to
love<00:00:27.700> it's<00:00:28.030> long<00:00:29.020> enough<00:00:29.260> to<00:00:29.380> make<00:00:29.500> the<00:00:29.650> climb

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:29.890 
love it's long enough to make the climb

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.680 
love it's long enough to make the climb
declines<00:00:30.490> not<00:00:30.850> too<00:00:31.030> long<00:00:31.210> to<00:00:31.420> make<00:00:31.539> the

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:31.690 
declines not too long to make the

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:33.600 
declines not too long to make the
corners<00:00:32.110> and<00:00:32.349> not<00:00:32.559> too<00:00:32.739> long<00:00:32.950> to<00:00:33.190> kill<00:00:33.460> you<00:00:33.579> on
