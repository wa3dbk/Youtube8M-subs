00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
might we'll find out but touchings get a

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.960 
might we'll find out but touchings get a
little<00:01:43.079> bit<00:01:43.170> of<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.259> kick<00:01:43.470> out<00:01:43.680> of<00:01:43.710> this<00:01:43.970> because

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
little bit of a kick out of this because

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.969 
little bit of a kick out of this because
it<00:01:45.090> had<00:01:45.210> a<00:01:45.240> no<00:01:45.420> leak<00:01:45.720> I<00:01:45.930> mean<00:01:46.140> it<00:01:46.439> had<00:01:46.649> enough

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
it had a no leak I mean it had enough

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.359 
it had a no leak I mean it had enough
silicone<00:01:47.610> here<00:01:48.170> that<00:01:49.170> it<00:01:49.290> had<00:01:49.439> it<00:01:49.560> sealed<00:01:49.829> it

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
silicone here that it had it sealed it

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.359 
silicone here that it had it sealed it
had<00:01:50.549> enough<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:51.000> almost<00:01:51.930> have<00:01:52.229> it<00:01:52.259> sealed<00:01:52.590> but

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
had enough to almost have it sealed but

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.249 
had enough to almost have it sealed but
it<00:01:53.399> was<00:01:53.520> still<00:01:53.700> leaking<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.270> way<00:01:54.810> this<00:01:54.990> is<00:01:55.110> in

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
it was still leaking and way this is in

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.539 
it was still leaking and way this is in
here<00:01:55.439> looks<00:01:55.560> like<00:01:55.590> some<00:01:55.920> of<00:01:55.979> this<00:01:56.040> was<00:01:56.219> added

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
here looks like some of this was added

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.120 
here looks like some of this was added
after<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:56.969> fact<00:01:57.060> which<00:01:57.600> I'm<00:01:57.750> sure<00:01:57.930> it<00:01:58.049> was<00:01:58.200> try

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
after the fact which I'm sure it was try

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.030 
after the fact which I'm sure it was try
to<00:01:59.189> stop<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.579> Tim<00:01:59.820> leak<00:02:00.060> but<00:02:01.049> I<00:02:01.350> don't<00:02:01.950> know

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
to stop the Tim leak but I don't know

at least one thing about it well if it's

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.139 
at least one thing about it well if it's
silicone<00:02:07.100> I<00:02:07.430> don't<00:02:07.549> know<00:02:07.610> what<00:02:07.790> the<00:02:07.880> hell<00:02:08.030> is

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
silicone I don't know what the hell is

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.419 
silicone I don't know what the hell is
Chitti<00:02:08.390> is<00:02:08.509> but<00:02:09.349> all<00:02:09.709> I'm<00:02:09.830> saying<00:02:10.099> is<00:02:10.280> it's

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
Chitti is but all I'm saying is it's

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:12.790 
Chitti is but all I'm saying is it's
coming<00:02:11.120> off<00:02:11.239> pretty<00:02:11.569> slick<00:02:12.080> and<00:02:12.290> I<00:02:12.349> like<00:02:12.590> it

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
coming off pretty slick and I like it

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.260 
coming off pretty slick and I like it
it's<00:02:12.920> coming<00:02:13.250> off<00:02:13.400> that's<00:02:13.730> unusual<00:02:14.239> for

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
it's coming off that's unusual for

it's coming off that's unusual for
silicon<00:02:14.810> but<00:02:15.080> we'll<00:02:15.770> find<00:02:15.950> out<00:02:16.190> some<00:02:16.370> more<00:02:16.489> see

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
silicon but we'll find out some more see

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.270 
silicon but we'll find out some more see
if<00:02:17.510> we<00:02:17.569> get<00:02:17.690> the<00:02:17.780> oil<00:02:17.810> pan<00:02:18.080> off<00:02:18.110> of<00:02:18.380> it<00:02:18.500> it's

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
if we get the oil pan off of it it's

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.250 
if we get the oil pan off of it it's
been<00:02:19.489> off<00:02:19.640> before<00:02:20.030> -<00:02:20.360> this<00:02:20.690> is<00:02:20.840> actually<00:02:21.230> a

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
been off before - this is actually a

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.870 
been off before - this is actually a
reman<00:02:21.620> engine<00:02:21.950> I<00:02:22.040> figured<00:02:22.310> this<00:02:22.430> out<00:02:22.610> this<00:02:22.819> is

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
reman engine I figured this out this is

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.440 
reman engine I figured this out this is
a<00:02:23.150> good<00:02:23.360> wrench<00:02:23.630> motor<00:02:23.900> so<00:02:24.260> I<00:02:25.269> don't<00:02:26.269> know<00:02:26.330> who

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
a good wrench motor so I don't know who

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.860 
a good wrench motor so I don't know who
helped<00:02:26.690> put<00:02:26.870> it<00:02:26.900> in<00:02:27.760> I'm<00:02:28.760> assuming<00:02:29.269> the<00:02:29.660> dealer

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
helped put it in I'm assuming the dealer

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.650 
helped put it in I'm assuming the dealer
didn't<00:02:30.290> by<00:02:30.530> the<00:02:30.590> looks<00:02:30.800> of<00:02:30.890> this

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
didn't by the looks of this

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.559 
didn't by the looks of this
anyway<00:02:32.660> let's<00:02:32.959> people<00:02:33.140> get<00:02:33.230> the<00:02:33.319> oil<00:02:33.440> pan<00:02:33.620> off

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
anyway let's people get the oil pan off

just a little bit of moisture you can

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.470 
just a little bit of moisture you can
see<00:03:22.190> it<00:03:22.280> right<00:03:22.430> there<00:03:22.459> but<00:03:22.790> I<00:03:22.850> pressure<00:03:23.150> works

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
see it right there but I pressure works

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
I found something up the top into he

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.170 
I found something up the top into he
just<00:03:31.190> got<00:03:31.340> in<00:03:31.489> and<00:03:31.579> run<00:03:31.730> down<00:03:31.880> just<00:03:32.120> a<00:03:32.150> few

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
just got in and run down just a few

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.610 
just got in and run down just a few
drips<00:03:32.600> as<00:03:32.900> you<00:03:32.989> can<00:03:33.109> see<00:03:33.230> you're<00:03:33.350> out<00:03:33.380> there

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
drips as you can see you're out there

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.990 
drips as you can see you're out there
nothing<00:03:34.040> major<00:03:34.269> but<00:03:35.269> the<00:03:35.389> inside<00:03:35.660> is<00:03:35.690> old<00:03:35.959> pan
