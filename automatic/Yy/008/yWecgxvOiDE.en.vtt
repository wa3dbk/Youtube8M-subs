 Ukrainians Kazakhs and Belarusians but 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.350

 for Russian billiards 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:45.700
 but here already managed to break into one 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:46.780
 the sixteenth I only once before 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.130
 played Russian billiards 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.080
 This was the first time in Latvia after 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.150

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.040
 after a little drunk but me 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.750
 persuaded to try and I liked it 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.010
 despite the fact that it is very difficult 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.520
 game requiring tremendous effort 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.780
 concentration is a very difficult sport 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:04.030
 surprised skill players of countries 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.459
 former USSR and Serbian representative 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:08.860

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:21.970
 just billions of points on plays what 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.670
 guys 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:27.240
 brewed the pool table it's just 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:31.740
 a low bow 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:34.319
 I have to practice and I want to achieve 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.030
 such results as they are if foreigners 

00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:38.009
 may be willing to give interviews even 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.319
 Before the start of the game, the main favorites 

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:42.750
 on championship players team Russia 

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:44.669

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:48.780
 billiards this first turn game 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:51.660
 concentration and what I refused there 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:55.020
 interview before the meeting it's just not 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:57.509
 some star delusions of grandeur yes then 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.639
 that for you there may be some ordinary 

00:04:57.509 --> 00:05:03.990
 question for us will this be some kind of 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:06.449
 knock out of the saddle and therefore try well 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:08.130
 how would our coaches our psychologists in 

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:10.380
 which we do always say that 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:12.240
 first do business and then say 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:14.099
 The title of new world champion will be 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.229

 if not for winning the west it accurately and 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.569
