and very general statements nothing

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.080

specific<00:01:25.259> Barack<00:01:25.830> Obama<00:01:26.189> actually<00:01:26.430> made<00:01:26.880> the

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
specific Barack Obama actually made the

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.539 
specific Barack Obama actually made the
specific<00:01:27.630> promise<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:28.259> it<00:01:28.619> completely<00:01:29.159> just

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
specific promise and it completely just

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.090

did<00:01:29.820> not<00:01:30.030> work<00:01:30.329> strategically<00:01:31.170> was<00:01:31.890> it<00:01:32.040> a

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
did not work strategically was it a

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.819 
did not work strategically was it a
mistake<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.610> be<00:01:33.119> so<00:01:33.390> specific<00:01:33.450> I<00:01:34.170> guess<00:01:34.590> maybe

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
mistake to be so specific I guess maybe

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.350 
mistake to be so specific I guess maybe
it<00:01:35.070> was<00:01:35.220> that's<00:01:35.610> a<00:01:35.700> good<00:01:35.820> question<00:01:35.970> do<00:01:36.299> you

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
it was that's a good question do you

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.030 
it was that's a good question do you
think<00:01:36.689> that<00:01:36.840> this<00:01:36.990> is<00:01:37.049> a<00:01:37.200> case<00:01:37.439> of<00:01:37.500> making

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
think that this is a case of making

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.800 
think that this is a case of making
promises<00:01:38.250> that<00:01:38.610> you<00:01:38.850> can't<00:01:39.000> keep<00:01:39.420> because<00:01:39.720> you

bigger broader political system maybe
what<00:03:13.020> is<00:03:13.140> the<00:03:13.230> solution<00:03:13.700> it's<00:03:14.700> what's<00:03:15.180> clear

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
what is the solution it's what's clear

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.510 
what is the solution it's what's clear
is<00:03:15.600> that<00:03:15.720> the<00:03:15.989> status<00:03:16.410> quo<00:03:16.620> is<00:03:16.830> not<00:03:16.860> working

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520 
is that the status quo is not working

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.750 
is that the status quo is not working
and<00:03:17.700> as<00:03:18.209> Jesse<00:03:18.930> Ventura<00:03:19.110> said<00:03:19.620> it<00:03:19.800> before<00:03:20.160> in

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
and as Jesse Ventura said it before in

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.460 
and as Jesse Ventura said it before in

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
very very similar and we can pick

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.199 
very very similar and we can pick
individual<00:03:29.310> politicians<00:03:30.000> that<00:03:30.150> are

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
different and we can pick individual

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.740 
different and we can pick individual
issues<00:03:32.489> on<00:03:32.700> which<00:03:32.730> there<00:03:33.120> is<00:03:33.239> a<00:03:33.270> difference

we have want to change it it wouldn't
make<00:04:24.110> any<00:04:24.169> sense<00:04:24.560> right<00:04:24.889> so<00:04:25.669> you<00:04:25.729> think<00:04:26.090> this

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
make any sense right so you think this

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:27.610 
make any sense right so you think this
all<00:04:26.270> boils<00:04:26.449> down<00:04:26.690> to<00:04:27.080> essentially

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
all boils down to essentially

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:28.930 
all boils down to essentially

corporations running the country it

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.210 
corporations running the country it
sounds<00:04:29.120> like<00:04:29.259> what<00:04:30.259> doesn't<00:04:30.710> boil<00:04:30.889> down<00:04:31.160> to

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
sounds like what doesn't boil down to

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.490 
sounds like what doesn't boil down to
money<00:04:31.580> in<00:04:31.759> politics<00:04:32.180> at<00:04:32.389> this<00:04:32.509> point<00:04:32.780> I<00:04:32.900> can't

money in politics at this point I can't

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.379 
money in politics at this point I can't
