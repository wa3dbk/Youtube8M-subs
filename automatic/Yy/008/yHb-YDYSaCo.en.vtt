00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
Stratton and I have a little trick for

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.349 
Stratton and I have a little trick for
the<00:00:16.560> handle<00:00:16.980> here<00:00:17.160> rather<00:00:17.340> than<00:00:17.490> doing<00:00:17.850> it<00:00:18.119> a

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
the handle here rather than doing it a

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.660 
the handle here rather than doing it a
days<00:00:18.869> firm<00:00:19.289> way<00:00:19.590> where<00:00:19.859> you<00:00:19.949> take<00:00:20.220> a<00:00:20.250> pair<00:00:20.640> of

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
days firm way where you take a pair of

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.950 
days firm way where you take a pair of
vise<00:00:20.939> grips<00:00:21.359> and<00:00:22.010> stick<00:00:23.010> it<00:00:23.130> on<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.960> handle

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
vise grips and stick it on the handle

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:32.900 
vise grips and stick it on the handle
here<00:00:25.320> I<00:00:26.090> use<00:00:27.090> an<00:00:27.570> old<00:00:27.779> sock<00:00:31.340> and<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.489> reason

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
here I use an old sock and the reason

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.360 
here I use an old sock and the reason
being<00:00:33.180> is<00:00:33.570> is<00:00:34.399> cuz<00:00:35.399> a<00:00:35.430> sock<00:00:36.620> will<00:00:37.620> not<00:00:37.829> scratch

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
being is is cuz a sock will not scratch

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.360 
being is is cuz a sock will not scratch
and<00:00:39.000> make<00:00:39.750> a<00:00:39.780> sharp<00:00:40.170> edge<00:00:40.530> on<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.309> handle<00:00:41.640> bar

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
and make a sharp edge on the handle bar

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.920 
and make a sharp edge on the handle bar
okay<00:00:44.370> now<00:00:44.579> that<00:00:44.760> I<00:00:44.879> got<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.180> sock<00:00:45.450> in<00:00:45.660> place

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
okay now that I got the sock in place

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.660 
okay now that I got the sock in place
it's<00:00:46.440> kind<00:00:46.680> of<00:00:46.710> hard<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:46.950> do<00:00:47.129> that<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.370> hold

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
it's kind of hard to do that and hold

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.330 
it's kind of hard to do that and hold
the<00:00:47.789> video<00:00:48.000> camera<00:00:48.620> let's<00:00:49.620> see<00:00:49.800> what<00:00:49.920> happens

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
the video camera let's see what happens

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.540 
the video camera let's see what happens
I<00:00:50.870> framed<00:00:51.870> it<00:00:52.050> six<00:00:52.410> times<00:00:52.800> because<00:00:53.160> it's<00:00:53.430> a

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
I framed it six times because it's a

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.330 
I framed it six times because it's a
cold<00:00:53.789> day<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:55.379> fuel<00:00:55.649> system<00:00:55.949> was

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
cold day and the fuel system was

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.760 
cold day and the fuel system was
bone-dry<00:00:56.579> so<00:00:57.360> it's<00:00:57.539> all<00:00:57.719> got<00:00:57.960> fresh<00:00:58.199> fuel<00:00:58.440> in

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
bone-dry so it's all got fresh fuel in

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.700 
bone-dry so it's all got fresh fuel in
it<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.600> let's<00:01:00.600> see<00:01:00.780> if<00:01:00.870> we<00:01:00.989> get<00:01:01.140> a<00:01:01.170> one<00:01:01.410> pull

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
it and let's see if we get a one pull

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:16.670 
it and let's see if we get a one pull
start<00:01:02.070> out<00:01:02.309> of<00:01:02.340> it

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:28.620 

little<00:01:17.010> oil

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.569 

equipment<00:01:29.079> dried<00:01:29.439> before<00:01:30.040> I<00:01:30.070> put<00:01:30.399> it<00:01:30.490> away

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:30.579 
equipment dried before I put it away

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:32.910 
equipment dried before I put it away
because<00:01:31.030> it<00:01:31.360> always<00:01:31.570> served<00:01:32.079> right<00:01:32.500> up<00:01:32.710> with

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
because it always served right up with

00:01:32.920 --> 00:02:25.520 
because it always served right up with
no<00:01:33.250> problem
