now<00:00:40.180> check<00:00:40.540> his<00:00:41.020> energy<00:00:42.570> we<00:00:43.570> fly<00:00:43.810> around<00:00:44.020> and

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:44.860 
now check his energy we fly around and

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.110 
now check his energy we fly around and
she<00:00:45.310> reduces<00:00:45.850> and<00:00:46.090> now<00:00:46.270> we<00:00:46.840> fly<00:00:47.700> above<00:00:48.700> our

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
she reduces and now we fly above our

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.330 
she reduces and now we fly above our
Nexus<00:00:49.660> the<00:00:49.840> Nexus<00:00:49.870> of<00:00:50.200> your<00:00:50.500> team<00:00:50.710> and<00:00:50.920> the

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:55.840 
energy is reset to 75 can see that again

energy is reset to 75 can see that again
energy<00:00:56.560> reduces<00:00:57.280> goes<00:00:57.880> down<00:00:58.120> one<00:00:58.450> by<00:00:58.600> one<00:00:58.780> and

00:00:58.980 --> 00:00:58.990 
energy reduces goes down one by one and

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:03.600 
energy reduces goes down one by one and
above<00:00:59.620> the<00:00:59.800> Nexus<00:01:00.510> stays<00:01:01.510> at<00:01:01.900> 75<00:01:02.890> so<00:01:03.280> you<00:01:03.340> can

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:03.610 
above the Nexus stays at 75 so you can

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.580 
above the Nexus stays at 75 so you can
just<00:01:03.850> data<00:01:04.150> and<00:01:04.509> you<00:01:04.869> will<00:01:05.019> never<00:01:05.170> run<00:01:05.379> out<00:01:05.530> of

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
just data and you will never run out of

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.140 
just data and you will never run out of
energy

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:15.870 
quite cool to take down cloak rates you

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:17.690 
quite cool to take down cloak rates you
can<00:01:15.900> see<00:01:16.170> that<00:01:16.320> here<00:01:16.530> you<00:01:17.040> have<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.310> observer

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
can see that here you have the observer

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.590 
can see that here you have the observer
and<00:01:19.100> yeah<00:01:20.100> you<00:01:20.220> can<00:01:20.400> get<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.580> lot<00:01:20.880> of<00:01:20.970> points<00:01:21.390> so

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
and yeah you can get a lot of points so

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.470 
and yeah you can get a lot of points so
tom<00:01:22.020> is<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:22.230> hunter<00:01:22.710> no<00:01:23.070> fighter<00:01:23.370> only<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.180> hunter

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:31.410 
we can see that here during a push if

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.620 
we can see that here during a push if
air<00:01:31.650> units<00:01:31.980> and<00:01:32.250> then<00:01:32.580> it's<00:01:32.820> cool<00:01:33.090> if<00:01:33.270> you<00:01:33.450> have

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
air units and then it's cool if you have

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.350 
air units and then it's cool if you have
an<00:01:33.840> additional<00:01:34.350> Tom<00:01:34.620> because<00:01:35.340> he<00:01:35.490> can<00:01:35.670> get<00:01:36.150> rid

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360

an additional Tom because he can get rid
of<00:01:36.510> the<00:01:36.660> air<00:01:36.810> units<00:01:37.170> just<00:01:37.440> like<00:01:37.530> Guardian<00:01:38.130> are

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
of the air units just like Guardian are

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.800 
of the air units just like Guardian are
a<00:01:38.370> lot<00:01:38.580> of<00:01:38.700> points<00:01:39.060> for<00:01:39.240> you<00:01:41.000> when<00:01:42.000> you're<00:01:42.420> done

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
a lot of points for you when you're done

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.020 
a lot of points for you when you're done

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
with that you always have to retreat

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.930

because<00:01:45.450> you<00:01:45.690> never<00:01:45.870> know<00:01:46.170> when<00:01:46.940> opponents

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:47.940 
because you never know when opponents

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.670 
because you never know when opponents
will<00:01:48.150> spawn<00:01:48.600> with<00:01:48.780> an<00:01:48.900> observer<00:01:49.260> or

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.440 

it's<00:01:53.680> very<00:01:53.920> common<00:01:54.310> to<00:01:54.340> select<00:01:54.759> cloak<00:01:55.119> rates

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
it's very common to select cloak rates

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.630 
it's very common to select cloak rates
and<00:01:55.780> and<00:01:56.380> observe<00:01:56.710> and<00:01:56.979> try<00:01:57.130> to<00:01:57.189> kill<00:01:57.490> the

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
and and observe and try to kill the

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.359 
and and observe and try to kill the
enemy<00:01:57.969> Tom<00:01:58.240> if<00:01:58.630> they<00:01:59.409> do<00:01:59.590> so<00:01:59.799> you<00:01:59.860> can<00:02:00.130> try<00:02:00.310> to

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
enemy Tom if they do so you can try to

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:02.370 
enemy Tom if they do so you can try to
snipe<00:02:00.789> the<00:02:01.030> observer<00:02:01.420> you<00:02:01.659> can<00:02:01.810> see<00:02:01.990> that<00:02:02.170> here

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
snipe the observer you can see that here

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.649 
snipe the observer you can see that here
the<00:02:02.590> observers<00:02:03.100> gun<00:02:03.340> and<00:02:03.579> as<00:02:04.060> soon<00:02:04.240> as<00:02:04.479> it's

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659 
the observers gun and as soon as it's

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:07.050 
the observers gun and as soon as it's
done<00:02:04.810> you<00:02:05.200> can<00:02:05.439> get<00:02:05.799> some<00:02:06.009> points<00:02:06.429> stable<00:02:06.880> of

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
done you can get some points stable of

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:12.270 
done you can get some points stable of
course<00:02:07.299> usually<00:02:07.780> fly<00:02:08.050> away<00:02:08.289> and<00:02:08.530> suicide<00:02:11.280> when

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
course usually fly away and suicide when

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.670 
course usually fly away and suicide when
your<00:02:12.459> tom<00:02:12.940> is<00:02:13.150> damaged<00:02:13.630> you<00:02:14.230> can<00:02:14.260> see<00:02:14.530> that

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
your tom is damaged you can see that

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.110 
your tom is damaged you can see that
here<00:02:14.860> it's<00:02:15.099> almost<00:02:15.610> down<00:02:16.540> you<00:02:17.200> can<00:02:17.470> again

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
here it's almost down you can again

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.820 
here it's almost down you can again
select<00:02:19.120> the<00:02:19.360> observer<00:02:19.780> and<00:02:20.050> you<00:02:20.470> get<00:02:20.650> some

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
select the observer and you get some

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.520 
select the observer and you get some
recipes<00:02:21.280> with<00:02:21.519> it<00:02:21.640> and<00:02:21.880> you<00:02:22.720> just<00:02:23.170> repair<00:02:23.470> it

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
recipes with it and you just repair it

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:30.380 
recipes with it and you just repair it
so<00:02:23.980> it<00:02:24.640> will<00:02:24.910> survive<00:02:25.440> much<00:02:26.440> longer

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.810 

as<00:02:30.840> I<00:02:31.080> said<00:02:31.290> before<00:02:31.320> you<00:02:31.770> shouldn't<00:02:32.130> like<00:02:32.400> camp

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
as I said before you shouldn't like camp
