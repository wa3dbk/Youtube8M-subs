guess<00:02:30.870> I<00:02:31.200> will<00:02:31.530> have<00:02:31.560> to<00:02:31.830> stop<00:02:32.340> it<00:02:33.890> i<00:02:35.090> spend

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
guess I will have to stop it i spend

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.410 
guess I will have to stop it i spend
about<00:02:36.269> six<00:02:36.870> seven<00:02:37.319> hours<00:02:37.470> yesterday<00:02:38.420> so

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
about six seven hours yesterday so
