stealth role and him and jazz missions
in<00:02:17.050> the<00:02:17.260> campaign<00:02:17.800> seemed<00:02:18.340> to<00:02:18.520> be<00:02:18.610> interwoven

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
in the campaign seemed to be interwoven

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.180 
in the campaign seemed to be interwoven
as<00:02:19.630> they<00:02:19.810> are<00:02:19.900> both<00:02:20.110> on<00:02:20.410> a<00:02:20.470> hunt<00:02:20.860> to<00:02:21.160> find

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
Grimlock so his role is very important

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.250 
Grimlock so his role is very important
in<00:02:23.980> transformers<00:02:24.550> fall<00:02:24.790> Cybertron<00:02:25.420> as<00:02:25.600> he<00:02:26.080> has

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
in transformers fall Cybertron as he has

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.110 
in transformers fall Cybertron as he has
to<00:02:26.410> find<00:02:26.620> the<00:02:26.950> great<00:02:27.280> Autobot<00:02:27.700> warrior

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
to find the great Autobot warrior

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.120 
to find the great Autobot warrior
Grimlock<00:02:28.630> and<00:02:28.930> it<00:02:29.260> should<00:02:29.410> be<00:02:29.530> interesting<00:02:30.010> to

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
Grimlock and it should be interesting to

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.309 
Grimlock and it should be interesting to
see<00:02:30.310> how<00:02:30.459> his<00:02:30.670> stealth<00:02:31.090> works<00:02:31.480> compared<00:02:32.200> to

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
see how his stealth works compared to

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.770 
see how his stealth works compared to
that<00:02:32.470> of<00:02:32.650> the<00:02:32.800> Scouts<00:02:33.130> currently<00:02:33.819> I<00:02:34.060> would

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
that of the Scouts currently I would

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.520 
that of the Scouts currently I would
imagine<00:02:35.770> that<00:02:36.220> he<00:02:36.640> has<00:02:36.850> some<00:02:37.239> huge<00:02:37.810> gun<00:02:38.110> to<00:02:38.380> use

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
imagine that he has some huge gun to use

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.830 
imagine that he has some huge gun to use
as<00:02:38.800> well<00:02:39.040> as<00:02:39.340> he<00:02:39.610> is<00:02:39.640> famous<00:02:40.150> for<00:02:40.330> pulling<00:02:40.750> out

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
as well as he is famous for pulling out

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.620 
as well as he is famous for pulling out
big<00:02:41.200> guns<00:02:41.470> out<00:02:41.800> of<00:02:41.830> nowhere<00:02:42.250> in<00:02:42.700> the<00:02:43.180> cartoons

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
big guns out of nowhere in the cartoons

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.170 
big guns out of nowhere in the cartoons
so<00:02:44.110> I<00:02:44.140> would<00:02:44.319> guess<00:02:44.530> he<00:02:44.709> has<00:02:44.920> some<00:02:45.489> huge<00:02:45.850> guns

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
so I would guess he has some huge guns

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.530 
so I would guess he has some huge guns
to<00:02:46.420> use<00:02:46.660> for<00:02:47.230> our<00:02:47.400> entertainment<00:02:48.400> as<00:02:48.550> well<00:02:48.580> and

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
to use for our entertainment as well and

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.270 
to use for our entertainment as well and
once<00:02:49.959> again<00:02:50.080> this<00:02:50.319> is<00:02:50.500> just<00:02:50.620> a<00:02:50.769> brief<00:02:51.010> summary
