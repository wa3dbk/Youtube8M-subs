these

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.940 
these
so<00:00:47.060> I<00:00:47.090> figured<00:00:47.780> out<00:00:47.930> how<00:00:48.170> to<00:00:48.200> work<00:00:48.710> around

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:48.950 
so I figured out how to work around

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.240 
so I figured out how to work around
those<00:00:49.370> problems<00:00:49.670> and<00:00:50.620> one<00:00:51.620> of<00:00:51.710> the<00:00:51.800> problems

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
those problems and one of the problems

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.210 
those problems and one of the problems
is<00:00:52.840> notice<00:00:53.840> how<00:00:53.960> this<00:00:54.110> is<00:00:54.290> flat<00:00:54.590> well<00:00:54.890> they<00:00:55.160> do

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:55.220 
is notice how this is flat well they do

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.070 
is notice how this is flat well they do
that<00:00:55.370> probably<00:00:55.910> for<00:00:56.420> keeping<00:00:56.840> things

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:57.080 
that probably for keeping things

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.620 
that probably for keeping things
condensed<00:00:57.650> and<00:00:57.800> everything<00:00:58.190> else<00:00:58.450> any<00:00:59.450> of<00:00:59.540> you

00:00:59.620 --> 00:00:59.630 
condensed and everything else any of you

guys<00:00:59.840> that<00:01:00.110> have<00:01:00.170> used<00:01:00.530> these<00:01:00.800> and<00:01:01.070> you<00:01:01.160> hang

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:01.400 
guys that have used these and you hang

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.250 
guys that have used these and you hang
them<00:01:01.580> over<00:01:01.700> the<00:01:01.910> fire<00:01:02.150> or<00:01:02.450> even<00:01:02.720> set<00:01:02.960> them<00:01:03.110> over

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260

them over the fire or even set them over
the<00:01:03.350> fire<00:01:03.560> you'll<00:01:04.369> notice<00:01:04.820> if<00:01:05.330> you<00:01:05.539> go<00:01:05.570> putting

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:06.049 
the fire you'll notice if you go putting

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:07.510 
the fire you'll notice if you go putting
your<00:01:06.140> fingers<00:01:06.469> on<00:01:06.619> this<00:01:06.770> to<00:01:06.950> take<00:01:07.130> this<00:01:07.280> lid

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520

off you're gonna get burnt stainless
heats<00:01:09.200> up<00:01:09.380> all<00:01:09.590> the<00:01:09.740> way<00:01:09.859> when<00:01:10.070> this<00:01:10.159> water's

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:10.549 
heats up all the way when this water's

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:14.289 
heats up all the way when this water's
blowing<00:01:10.939> the<00:01:11.060> whole<00:01:11.179> thing<00:01:11.240> is<00:01:11.630> hot<00:01:12.070> so<00:01:13.299> this

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:14.299 
blowing the whole thing is hot so this

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:15.819 
blowing the whole thing is hot so this
is<00:01:14.450> kind<00:01:14.659> of<00:01:14.719> tough<00:01:14.899> to<00:01:15.049> get<00:01:15.170> the<00:01:15.320> lid<00:01:15.469> out<00:01:15.679> and

00:01:15.819 --> 00:01:15.829 
is kind of tough to get the lid out and

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:17.349 
is kind of tough to get the lid out and
I've<00:01:15.890> seen<00:01:16.130> guys<00:01:16.340> and<00:01:16.640> even<00:01:16.820> I've<00:01:16.939> done<00:01:17.210> it

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
trying to balance that out and then

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:22.630 
trying to balance that out and then
it'll<00:01:20.780> fall<00:01:21.020> down<00:01:21.079> in<00:01:21.560> the<00:01:21.679> ground<00:01:22.009> get<00:01:22.369> dirty

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640

and everything else same thing with this
they<00:01:25.579> designed<00:01:25.969> these<00:01:26.149> things<00:01:26.479> up<00:01:26.719> which<00:01:26.960> I

00:01:27.099 --> 00:01:27.109 
they designed these things up which I

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:28.840 
they designed these things up which I
love<00:01:27.439> the<00:01:27.649> locking<00:01:28.100> handle<00:01:28.429> in<00:01:28.549> here<00:01:28.759> I'm

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
love the locking handle in here I'm

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.130 
love the locking handle in here I'm
trying<00:01:28.969> to<00:01:29.119> figure<00:01:29.299> out<00:01:29.450> a<00:01:29.509> way<00:01:29.689> to<00:01:29.749> make<00:01:29.929> these

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
trying to figure out a way to make these

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.459 
trying to figure out a way to make these
lock<00:01:30.499> so<00:01:30.799> that<00:01:30.890> they<00:01:31.009> don't<00:01:31.130> lift<00:01:31.520> over<00:01:31.670> on<00:01:31.969> you

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:32.469 
lock so that they don't lift over on you

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:34.899 
lock so that they don't lift over on you
the<00:01:33.469> locking<00:01:33.920> handle<00:01:34.280> and<00:01:34.399> here's<00:01:34.549> an<00:01:34.700> awesome

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
the locking handle and here's an awesome

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:37.510 
the locking handle and here's an awesome
idea<00:01:35.240> they<00:01:36.020> bent<00:01:36.289> these<00:01:36.499> tabs<00:01:36.829> in<00:01:37.130> to<00:01:37.340> keep

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
idea they bent these tabs in to keep

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.160 
idea they bent these tabs in to keep
everything<00:01:37.819> condensed<00:01:38.569> so<00:01:38.719> that<00:01:38.869> the<00:01:38.990> link

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
everything condensed so that the link

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.660 
everything condensed so that the link
don't<00:01:39.439> get<00:01:39.590> too<00:01:39.740> big<00:01:39.979> the<00:01:40.159> problem<00:01:40.310> with<00:01:40.549> that

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
don't get too big the problem with that

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.249 
don't get too big the problem with that
is<00:01:40.909> again<00:01:41.299> if<00:01:41.450> you<00:01:41.539> touch<00:01:41.780> this<00:01:42.020> you'll

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
is again if you touch this you'll

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:44.139 
is again if you touch this you'll
probably<00:01:42.439> get<00:01:42.649> marks<00:01:43.039> but<00:01:43.520> notice<00:01:43.819> how<00:01:43.969> your

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149 
probably get marks but notice how your

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:46.539 
probably get marks but notice how your
lids<00:01:44.389> touching<00:01:44.840> that<00:01:44.929> right<00:01:45.170> there<00:01:45.549> just

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:46.549 
lids touching that right there just

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:48.010 
lids touching that right there just
stick<00:01:46.729> a<00:01:46.759> knife<00:01:46.969> in<00:01:47.240> there<00:01:47.389> and<00:01:47.509> try<00:01:47.630> to<00:01:47.659> pry<00:01:47.960> it

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
stick a knife in there and try to pry it

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.209 
stick a knife in there and try to pry it
up<00:01:48.200> out<00:01:48.409> of<00:01:48.530> there<00:01:48.649> you're<00:01:48.740> doing<00:01:48.920> something

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:49.219 
up out of there you're doing something

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:51.099 
up out of there you're doing something
goofy<00:01:49.549> you're<00:01:49.999> not<00:01:50.119> it<00:01:50.240> slipped<00:01:50.539> out<00:01:50.719> falls

00:01:51.099 --> 00:01:51.109 
goofy you're not it slipped out falls

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:54.429 
goofy you're not it slipped out falls
out<00:01:51.350> it's<00:01:52.249> just<00:01:52.670> it's<00:01:52.999> it's<00:01:53.509> a<00:01:53.719> if<00:01:53.990> I<00:01:54.139> wouldn't

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:54.439 
out it's just it's it's a if I wouldn't

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:56.050 
out it's just it's it's a if I wouldn't
call<00:01:54.590> it<00:01:54.619> a<00:01:54.740> design<00:01:55.130> flaw<00:01:55.490> I<00:01:55.729> could<00:01:55.909> probably

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
call it a design flaw I could probably

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.510 
call it a design flaw I could probably
spread<00:01:56.569> these<00:01:56.719> out<00:01:56.990> and<00:01:57.170> pinch<00:01:57.439> this<00:01:57.619> out<00:01:57.889> but

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
spread these out and pinch this out but

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.639 
spread these out and pinch this out but
but<00:01:58.939> these<00:01:59.060> these<00:01:59.539> hangers<00:01:59.990> would<00:02:00.200> grow<00:02:00.469> out

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
but these these hangers would grow out

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:03.699 
but these these hangers would grow out
past<00:02:01.069> the<00:02:01.369> pot<00:02:01.609> which<00:02:01.909> I<00:02:02.060> don't<00:02:02.209> like<00:02:02.619> let<00:02:03.619> me

00:02:03.699 --> 00:02:03.709 
past the pot which I don't like let me

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:04.809 
past the pot which I don't like let me
show<00:02:03.829> you<00:02:03.950> what<00:02:04.100> I<00:02:04.130> figured<00:02:04.429> out

00:02:04.809 --> 00:02:04.819 
show you what I figured out

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:06.520 
show you what I figured out
and<00:02:05.060> we'll<00:02:05.209> set<00:02:05.389> this<00:02:05.539> one<00:02:05.689> aside<00:02:05.780> you<00:02:06.289> can<00:02:06.409> see

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
and we'll set this one aside you can see

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.050 
and we'll set this one aside you can see
I<00:02:06.560> got<00:02:06.709> me<00:02:06.889> a<00:02:06.920> little<00:02:07.069> marker<00:02:07.459> right<00:02:07.639> here<00:02:07.670> I'm

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
I got me a little marker right here I'm

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.279 
I got me a little marker right here I'm
gonna<00:02:08.240> set<00:02:08.390> this<00:02:08.539> one<00:02:08.660> right<00:02:08.869> here

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
gonna set this one right here

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.140 
gonna set this one right here
for<00:02:09.829> one<00:02:09.979> when<00:02:10.129> you<00:02:10.219> guys<00:02:10.369> hang<00:02:10.670> these<00:02:10.849> on<00:02:11.060> the

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
for one when you guys hang these on the

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.360 
for one when you guys hang these on the
fires<00:02:11.360> always<00:02:11.989> make<00:02:12.230> sure<00:02:12.500> that<00:02:12.799> your<00:02:13.040> your

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
fires always make sure that your your

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.209 
fires always make sure that your your
tea<00:02:13.640> rings<00:02:13.939> are<00:02:14.239> in<00:02:15.200> line<00:02:15.469> with<00:02:15.500> your<00:02:15.799> handle

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:16.219 
tea rings are in line with your handle

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:18.399 
tea rings are in line with your handle
that<00:02:16.670> makes<00:02:16.879> it<00:02:17.090> easier<00:02:17.569> to<00:02:17.689> get<00:02:18.019> your<00:02:18.170> lid<00:02:18.379> on

00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:18.409 
that makes it easier to get your lid on

that makes it easier to get your lid on
and<00:02:18.739> off<00:02:18.890> while<00:02:19.700> it's<00:02:19.819> hanging<00:02:20.030> on<00:02:20.180> the<00:02:20.299> fire

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:20.859 
and off while it's hanging on the fire

00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:23.619 
and off while it's hanging on the fire
when<00:02:21.859> I<00:02:21.890> come<00:02:22.099> up<00:02:22.219> with<00:02:22.250> is<00:02:22.670> looking<00:02:23.540> around

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:23.629 
when I come up with is looking around

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:25.149 
when I come up with is looking around
and<00:02:23.930> trying<00:02:23.989> to<00:02:24.170> figure<00:02:24.349> out<00:02:24.560> how<00:02:24.739> to<00:02:24.799> get<00:02:24.980> that

00:02:25.149 --> 00:02:25.159 
and trying to figure out how to get that

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:26.710 
and trying to figure out how to get that
dad<00:02:25.370> going<00:02:25.609> lid<00:02:25.790> off<00:02:25.970> of<00:02:26.120> there<00:02:26.209> easy<00:02:26.450> without

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
dad going lid off of there easy without

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.740 
dad going lid off of there easy without
a<00:02:26.840> phone<00:02:27.140> in<00:02:27.349> a<00:02:27.439> dirt<00:02:27.650> every<00:02:27.920> time<00:02:28.720> come<00:02:29.720> up

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
a phone in a dirt every time come up

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.009 
a phone in a dirt every time come up
with<00:02:29.989> this<00:02:30.079> right<00:02:30.319> here<00:02:31.359> it's<00:02:32.359> a<00:02:32.480> simple<00:02:32.840> notch

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
with this right here it's a simple notch

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:36.280 
with this right here it's a simple notch
that's<00:02:33.980> dick<00:02:34.329> you<00:02:35.329> got<00:02:35.480> a<00:02:35.510> beveled<00:02:35.930> edge<00:02:36.019> right

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
that's dick you got a beveled edge right

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.589 
that's dick you got a beveled edge right
there<00:02:36.590> I<00:02:36.799> realized<00:02:37.639> one<00:02:38.000> of<00:02:38.030> the<00:02:38.150> problems

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:38.599 
there I realized one of the problems

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:40.059 
there I realized one of the problems
with<00:02:38.689> getting<00:02:38.930> this<00:02:39.019> lid<00:02:39.260> off<00:02:39.439> is<00:02:39.680> you<00:02:39.799> can't

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
with getting this lid off is you can't

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:41.619 
with getting this lid off is you can't
pick<00:02:40.310> it<00:02:40.430> straight<00:02:40.579> up<00:02:40.849> and<00:02:41.180> get<00:02:41.359> it<00:02:41.480> out

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:41.629 
pick it straight up and get it out

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:43.210 
pick it straight up and get it out
because<00:02:41.989> of<00:02:42.170> the<00:02:42.230> way<00:02:42.349> the<00:02:42.530> it<00:02:42.799> hits<00:02:43.040> these

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
because of the way the it hits these

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.520 
because of the way the it hits these
corners<00:02:43.670> you've<00:02:44.329> got<00:02:44.540> a<00:02:44.569> tilt<00:02:44.900> the<00:02:45.049> lid<00:02:45.230> and

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
corners you've got a tilt the lid and

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.920 
corners you've got a tilt the lid and
bring<00:02:45.709> it<00:02:45.859> out<00:02:45.980> so<00:02:46.790> by<00:02:47.000> putting<00:02:47.209> this<00:02:47.450> notch<00:02:47.689> in

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
bring it out so by putting this notch in

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.159 
bring it out so by putting this notch in
here<00:02:48.230> and<00:02:48.439> a<00:02:48.590> notch<00:02:49.400> on<00:02:49.639> me<00:02:49.790> in<00:02:49.879> like<00:02:50.150> that<00:02:50.450> you

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:51.169 
here and a notch on me in like that you

00:02:51.169 --> 00:02:53.940 
here and a notch on me in like that you
can<00:02:51.379> actually<00:02:51.530> go<00:02:51.859> right<00:02:52.099> in<00:02:52.340> you<00:02:53.150> can<00:02:53.329> hook<00:02:53.569> it

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
can actually go right in you can hook it

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.580 
can actually go right in you can hook it
you<00:02:54.950> can<00:02:55.129> pick<00:02:55.310> it<00:02:55.340> up<00:02:55.579> pull<00:02:56.180> it<00:02:56.209> right<00:02:56.419> out

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
you can pick it up pull it right out

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.369 
you can pick it up pull it right out
lickety-split<00:02:58.569> it's<00:02:59.569> actually<00:03:00.079> you<00:03:00.200> can

00:03:00.369 --> 00:03:00.379 
lickety-split it's actually you can

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:02.110 
lickety-split it's actually you can
probably<00:03:00.620> even<00:03:00.980> do<00:03:01.189> it<00:03:01.250> it's<00:03:01.459> so<00:03:01.669> easy<00:03:01.909> it

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
probably even do it it's so easy it

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.179 
probably even do it it's so easy it
works<00:03:02.269> so<00:03:02.569> well<00:03:02.599> you<00:03:03.019> know<00:03:03.409> I'm<00:03:03.620> doing<00:03:03.919> some

00:03:04.179 --> 00:03:04.189 
works so well you know I'm doing some

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:07.449 
works so well you know I'm doing some
both<00:03:04.370> sides<00:03:05.230> and<00:03:06.230> you<00:03:06.409> got<00:03:06.590> to<00:03:06.739> love<00:03:06.889> something

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:10.379 
both sides and you got to love something
that<00:03:07.549> worked<00:03:07.760> just<00:03:07.939> like<00:03:08.239> that<00:03:08.540> right<00:03:08.750> there

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:10.389 
that worked just like that right there

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:12.520 
that worked just like that right there
there's<00:03:11.389> something<00:03:11.659> quick<00:03:11.959> and<00:03:11.989> easy<00:03:12.290> to

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530
