00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
minutes just isn't long enough for me

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.009 
minutes just isn't long enough for me
and<00:02:19.340> novice<00:02:19.670> to<00:02:19.910> make<00:02:20.060> sure<00:02:20.330> this<00:02:20.630> mixture

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:21.019 
and novice to make sure this mixture

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:23.740 
and novice to make sure this mixture
gets<00:02:21.290> on<00:02:21.500> every<00:02:21.890> crevice<00:02:22.280> and<00:02:22.580> coil<00:02:22.910> of<00:02:23.209> my

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
gets on every crevice and coil of my

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.380 
gets on every crevice and coil of my
natural<00:02:24.200> hair<00:02:24.380> texture<00:02:24.769> our<00:02:25.100> hair<00:02:25.700> isn't<00:02:25.910> flat

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
natural hair texture our hair isn't flat

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.820 
natural hair texture our hair isn't flat
so<00:02:26.959> to<00:02:27.500> put<00:02:27.920> this<00:02:28.100> mixture<00:02:28.580> on<00:02:29.140> properly<00:02:30.140> my

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
so to put this mixture on properly my

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.650 
so to put this mixture on properly my
opinion<00:02:31.160> takes<00:02:31.310> way<00:02:31.640> longer<00:02:31.850> than<00:02:32.060> 30<00:02:32.420> minutes

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
opinion takes way longer than 30 minutes

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.590 
opinion takes way longer than 30 minutes
so<00:02:33.530> overall<00:02:34.010> it<00:02:34.310> would<00:02:34.489> recommend<00:02:34.970> the<00:02:35.420> shea

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
so overall it would recommend the shea

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.630 
so overall it would recommend the shea
moisture<00:02:35.660> hair<00:02:36.350> color<00:02:36.560> system<00:02:37.010> just<00:02:37.310> because

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
moisture hair color system just because

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.640 
moisture hair color system just because
it<00:02:38.000> doesn't<00:02:38.540> leave<00:02:38.750> your<00:02:38.959> hair<00:02:39.140> feeling<00:02:39.170> like

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
it doesn't leave your hair feeling like

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.220 
it doesn't leave your hair feeling like
