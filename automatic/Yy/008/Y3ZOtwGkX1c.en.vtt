head into a clean bowl then we are going

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.440 
head into a clean bowl then we are going

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
to take the zap cow and pour it right

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.209 
to take the zap cow and pour it right
over<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:31.200> power<00:01:32.009> head<00:01:32.340> now<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:33.329> zap<00:01:33.570> cow<00:01:33.810> is

00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:34.219 
over the power head now the zap cow is

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:37.639 
over the power head now the zap cow is
always<00:01:35.219> working<00:01:35.520> as<00:01:35.880> long<00:01:36.420> as<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:37.110> can<00:01:37.320> still

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:37.649 
always working as long as you can still

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:40.490 
always working as long as you can still
see<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:37.979> foaming<00:01:38.610> so<00:01:39.479> I<00:01:39.509> thought<00:01:39.869> about<00:01:40.079> it<00:01:40.229> and

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
see it foaming so I thought about it and

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.990 
see it foaming so I thought about it and
it<00:01:40.619> probably<00:01:40.950> would<00:01:41.250> be<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.399> little<00:01:41.490> bit<00:01:41.850> better

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
it probably would be a little bit better

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.330 
it probably would be a little bit better
if<00:01:42.420> I<00:01:42.840> took<00:01:42.899> a<00:01:43.110> container<00:01:43.680> that<00:01:43.829> was<00:01:44.159> a<00:01:44.189> little

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
if I took a container that was a little

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.670 
if I took a container that was a little
bit<00:01:44.520> more<00:01:44.700> narrow<00:01:45.000> so<00:01:45.810> that<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.200> powerhead

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
bit more narrow so that the powerhead

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.060 
bit more narrow so that the powerhead
can<00:01:46.950> fully<00:01:47.340> submerse<00:01:47.909> in<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.869> zap<00:01:49.110> cow<00:01:49.350> so<00:01:49.890> the

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
can fully submerse in the zap cow so the

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.190 
can fully submerse in the zap cow so the
power<00:01:50.280> head<00:01:50.579> has<00:01:50.759> now<00:01:51.030> been<00:01:51.329> sitting<00:01:51.719> in<00:01:51.810> the

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
power head has now been sitting in the

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.910 
power head has now been sitting in the
zap<00:01:52.409> cow<00:01:52.619> for<00:01:53.009> about<00:01:53.250> 60<00:01:53.759> seconds<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:54.420> I<00:01:55.289> can

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
zap cow for about 60 seconds and I can

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.249 
zap cow for about 60 seconds and I can
already<00:01:56.189> see<00:01:56.850> a<00:01:57.149> lot<00:01:57.509> of<00:01:57.539> that<00:01:57.780> coralline

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
already see a lot of that coralline

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.529 
already see a lot of that coralline
algae<00:01:58.289> starting<00:01:59.280> to<00:01:59.369> fall<00:01:59.670> right<00:01:59.909> off<00:01:59.969> without

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:00.539 
algae starting to fall right off without

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:04.340
