00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
so the question today should I buy a car

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.010 
so the question today should I buy a car
of<00:00:03.750> higher<00:00:03.959> mileage<00:00:05.420> my<00:00:06.420> answer<00:00:06.690> to<00:00:06.750> that<00:00:06.870> is

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
of higher mileage my answer to that is

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.330 
of higher mileage my answer to that is
it<00:00:07.170> depends<00:00:07.529> um<00:00:09.679> see<00:00:10.679> it's<00:00:10.800> not<00:00:10.920> so<00:00:11.040> much<00:00:11.190> about

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
it depends um see it's not so much about

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.180 
it depends um see it's not so much about
the<00:00:11.639> mileage<00:00:11.940> of<00:00:12.269> the<00:00:12.450> vehicle<00:00:12.990> it's<00:00:13.590> more<00:00:13.889> so

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
the mileage of the vehicle it's more so

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.000 
the mileage of the vehicle it's more so
about<00:00:14.719> the<00:00:15.719> maintenance<00:00:16.289> of<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:16.500> vehicle<00:00:16.830> you

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
about the maintenance of the vehicle you

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.920 
about the maintenance of the vehicle you
see<00:00:17.160> if<00:00:17.369> a<00:00:17.460> car's<00:00:17.670> got<00:00:17.850> 50,000<00:00:18.600> miles<00:00:18.750> with<00:00:18.900> no

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
see if a car's got 50,000 miles with no

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.320 
see if a car's got 50,000 miles with no
service<00:00:19.439> history<00:00:19.590> that<00:00:20.460> could<00:00:20.550> be<00:00:20.670> 50,000

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
service history that could be 50,000

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.540 
service history that could be 50,000
miles<00:00:21.480> or<00:00:21.720> really<00:00:22.020> hot<00:00:22.170> really<00:00:22.350> driving<00:00:22.710> you

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
miles or really hot really driving you

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.960 
miles or really hot really driving you
know<00:00:23.670> so<00:00:24.529> you<00:00:25.529> can't<00:00:25.830> really<00:00:26.039> I<00:00:26.430> mean<00:00:26.640> miles

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
know so you can't really I mean miles

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.179 
know so you can't really I mean miles
are<00:00:27.180> a<00:00:27.210> good<00:00:27.570> indicator<00:00:28.109> but<00:00:28.590> you<00:00:28.769> did<00:00:28.980> they're

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
are a good indicator but you did they're

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.690 
are a good indicator but you did they're
not<00:00:29.220> it's<00:00:30.150> not<00:00:30.300> 100%<00:00:30.660> final<00:00:31.289> you<00:00:31.410> know<00:00:31.439> so<00:00:31.949> the

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
not it's not 100% final you know so the

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.860 
not it's not 100% final you know so the
most<00:00:32.850> important<00:00:33.360> thing<00:00:33.510> whether<00:00:33.690> you're

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
most important thing whether you're

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.240 
most important thing whether you're
buying<00:00:33.960> a<00:00:34.110> high<00:00:34.290> mileage<00:00:34.500> car<00:00:34.800> or<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.040> low

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
buying a high mileage car or a low

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.270 
buying a high mileage car or a low
mileage<00:00:35.670> car<00:00:35.940> is<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.989> maintenance<00:00:37.500> how<00:00:37.950> well

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
mileage car is the maintenance how well

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.340 
mileage car is the maintenance how well
maintained<00:00:38.850> has<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.059> carbon<00:00:39.629> because<00:00:40.200> if<00:00:40.290> a

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
maintained has a carbon because if a

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.869 
maintained has a carbon because if a
car's<00:00:40.559> been<00:00:40.739> well<00:00:40.890> maintained<00:00:41.340> or<00:00:41.550> lost

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
car's been well maintained or lost

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.270 
car's been well maintained or lost
forever<00:00:42.120> that's<00:00:42.570> basically<00:00:42.989> as<00:00:43.379> simple<00:00:44.100> as<00:00:44.160> it

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
forever that's basically as simple as it

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.760 
forever that's basically as simple as it
is<00:00:44.309> but<00:00:45.090> if<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.450> car<00:00:45.690> being<00:00:45.899> poorly<00:00:46.260> maintained

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
is but if a car being poorly maintained

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.600 
is but if a car being poorly maintained
it's<00:00:46.950> all<00:00:47.570> 95%<00:00:48.570> poor<00:00:49.079> maintenance<00:00:49.649> is<00:00:50.280> what

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
it's all 95% poor maintenance is what

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.560 
it's all 95% poor maintenance is what
causes<00:00:51.440> your<00:00:52.440> car<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.800> break<00:00:52.949> down<00:00:53.129> 95<00:00:53.940> percent

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
causes your car to break down 95 percent

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.479 
causes your car to break down 95 percent
maybe<00:00:54.809> even<00:00:55.230> more<00:00:55.440> but<00:00:56.039> if<00:00:56.129> your<00:00:56.250> car's

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
maybe even more but if your car's

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.490 
maybe even more but if your car's
maintained<00:00:57.030> regularly<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:57.870> everything's

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
maintained regularly and everything's

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.950 
maintained regularly and everything's
replaced<00:00:59.039> when<00:00:59.219> it's<00:00:59.340> supposed<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.760> be<00:00:59.960> your

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
replaced when it's supposed to be your

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.349 
replaced when it's supposed to be your
car's<00:01:01.170> gonna<00:01:01.379> last<00:01:01.620> forever<00:01:01.770> so<00:01:02.239> mileage<00:01:03.239> is

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
car's gonna last forever so mileage is

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.719 
car's gonna last forever so mileage is
not<00:01:03.600> mileage<00:01:04.199> isn't<00:01:04.350> is<00:01:04.860> an<00:01:05.040> indicator<00:01:05.489> it

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
not mileage isn't is an indicator it

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.020 
not mileage isn't is an indicator it
will<00:01:05.850> help<00:01:06.090> but<00:01:06.950> it's<00:01:07.950> no<00:01:08.100> guarantee<00:01:08.310> you

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
will help but it's no guarantee you

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.010 
will help but it's no guarantee you
really<00:01:09.360> need<00:01:09.540> to<00:01:10.189> check<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.640> service<00:01:12.060> history

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
really need to check the service history

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.410 
really need to check the service history
the<00:01:13.140> service<00:01:13.590> intervals<00:01:14.159> how<00:01:14.420> regularly

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
the service intervals how regularly

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.160 
the service intervals how regularly
serviced<00:01:15.810> has<00:01:15.990> it<00:01:16.140> been<00:01:17.840> it<00:01:18.840> doesn't<00:01:19.080> always

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
serviced has it been it doesn't always

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.899 
serviced has it been it doesn't always
have<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.439> be<00:01:19.530> mainly<00:01:19.830> like<00:01:20.130> I<00:01:20.280> mean<00:01:20.460> someone

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
have to be mainly like I mean someone

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.670 
have to be mainly like I mean someone
like<00:01:20.939> myself<00:01:21.180> could<00:01:21.509> maintain<00:01:21.689> a<00:01:21.960> car<00:01:22.259> just<00:01:22.530> as

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
like myself could maintain a car just as

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:23.990 
like myself could maintain a car just as
well<00:01:22.830> as<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.009> main<00:01:23.189> deed<00:01:23.369> as<00:01:23.490> you've<00:01:23.700> seen<00:01:23.850> in

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
well as the main deed as you've seen in

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.380 
well as the main deed as you've seen in
my<00:01:24.060> videos<00:01:24.330> so<00:01:24.920> you<00:01:25.920> know<00:01:26.070> it's<00:01:26.909> about<00:01:27.090> looking

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
my videos so you know it's about looking

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.660 
my videos so you know it's about looking
for<00:01:27.720> bills<00:01:28.020> that<00:01:28.350> back<00:01:28.590> up<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:29.159> maintenance

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
for bills that back up the maintenance

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.330 
for bills that back up the maintenance
and<00:01:29.880> stuff<00:01:30.060> like<00:01:30.240> that<00:01:30.450> so<00:01:30.750> I<00:01:31.020> would<00:01:31.950> say<00:01:32.220> the

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
and stuff like that so I would say the

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.640 
and stuff like that so I would say the
key<00:01:32.520> thing<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:32.790> look<00:01:33.000> out<00:01:33.180> for<00:01:33.479> is<00:01:33.900> the

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
key thing to look out for is the

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.190 
key thing to look out for is the
maintenance<00:01:35.159> how<00:01:35.970> well<00:01:36.299> maintained<00:01:36.900> is<00:01:37.020> that

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
maintenance how well maintained is that

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.130 
maintenance how well maintained is that
carbon<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:37.920> if<00:01:38.490> that<00:01:38.700> owner<00:01:39.180> can<00:01:39.540> prove<00:01:39.810> it<00:01:39.960> to

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
carbon and if that owner can prove it to

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.639 
carbon and if that owner can prove it to
you<00:01:40.259> and<00:01:40.560> if<00:01:40.770> it<00:01:40.920> stacks<00:01:41.250> up<00:01:41.750> then<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:43.110> me<00:01:43.290> by<00:01:43.530> if

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
you and if it stacks up then to me by if

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.350 
you and if it stacks up then to me by if
that's<00:01:43.920> by<00:01:44.130> far<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.610> most<00:01:44.759> important<00:01:45.329> thing

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
that's by far the most important thing

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.920 
that's by far the most important thing
to<00:01:45.630> look<00:01:45.750> out<00:01:45.930> for<00:01:46.140> so<00:01:47.060> yes<00:01:48.060> by<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.390> high<00:01:48.630> mileage

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
to look out for so yes by a high mileage

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.480 
to look out for so yes by a high mileage
car<00:01:50.630> provided<00:01:51.710> it's<00:01:52.710> got<00:01:52.860> good<00:01:53.070> service

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
car provided it's got good service

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.630 
car provided it's got good service
history<00:01:53.640> or<00:01:54.090> some<00:01:54.390> sort<00:01:55.159> history<00:01:56.159> references

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
history or some sort history references

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.170 
history or some sort history references
so<00:01:57.210> that<00:01:57.240> I'm<00:01:57.540> just<00:01:57.750> getting<00:01:58.170> my<00:01:58.320> car<00:01:58.560> wash<00:01:59.180> so
