let's go ahead and have a look at what

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.560 
let's go ahead and have a look at what
we<00:00:40.890> want<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.160> accomplish<00:00:41.219> in<00:00:41.760> this<00:00:41.879> example<00:00:42.300> in

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
we want to accomplish in this example in

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.510 
we want to accomplish in this example in
this<00:00:42.719> example<00:00:43.079> I've<00:00:43.530> already<00:00:43.739> prepared<00:00:43.980> a

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
this example I've already prepared a

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.319 
this example I've already prepared a
small<00:00:45.300> demo<00:00:46.190> as<00:00:47.190> you<00:00:47.430> can<00:00:47.550> see<00:00:47.789> I've<00:00:47.940> got<00:00:47.969> bunny

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
small demo as you can see I've got bunny

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.479 
small demo as you can see I've got bunny
here<00:00:48.719> which<00:00:49.289> is<00:00:49.440> rotate<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.160> other<00:00:50.280> ones

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
here which is rotate and the other ones

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:51.979 
here which is rotate and the other ones
at<00:00:50.640> target<00:00:50.820> we<00:00:51.210> don't<00:00:51.360> care<00:00:51.629> about<00:00:51.660> this

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
at target we don't care about this

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.439 
at target we don't care about this
target<00:00:52.379> doesn't<00:00:52.410> do<00:00:52.739> anything<00:00:53.010> but<00:00:53.670> as<00:00:53.910> you

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
target doesn't do anything but as you

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.650 
target doesn't do anything but as you
tap<00:00:55.260> on<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.500> rotate<00:00:56.010> button<00:00:56.039> here<00:00:56.610> you<00:00:57.480> can

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
tap on the rotate button here you can

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.529 
tap on the rotate button here you can
see<00:00:57.809> that<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.050> target<00:00:58.440> starts<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:59.070> rotate<00:00:59.539> 90

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
see that the target starts to rotate 90

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.840 
see that the target starts to rotate 90
degrees<00:01:00.570> so<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:02.090> this<00:01:03.090> keeps<00:01:03.390> going<00:01:03.629> so<00:01:04.850> we're

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
degrees so and this keeps going so we're

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:06.830 
degrees so and this keeps going so we're
going<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.060> learn<00:01:06.119> how<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.360> do<00:01:06.510> this<00:01:06.600> I<00:01:06.720> mean

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
going to learn how to do this I mean

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.190 
going to learn how to do this I mean
this<00:01:06.900> is<00:01:07.380> just<00:01:07.409> a<00:01:07.770> simple<00:01:08.400> example<00:01:08.970> but<00:01:09.200> the

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
this is just a simple example but the

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.010 
this is just a simple example but the
idea<00:01:10.740> here<00:01:11.280> is<00:01:11.340> for<00:01:11.939> you<00:01:12.000> to<00:01:12.030> learn<00:01:12.390> how<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.780> use

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
idea here is for you to learn how to use

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.530 
idea here is for you to learn how to use
the<00:01:13.200> block<00:01:13.409> based<00:01:13.850> animations<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.060> I<00:01:15.119> are<00:01:15.270> so

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
the block based animations and I are so

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.960 
the block based animations and I are so
let's<00:01:15.750> get<00:01:15.869> started<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.680> clear<00:01:16.979> the

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
let's get started and clear the

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.920 
let's get started and clear the
simulator<00:01:18.450> here<00:01:18.840> I<00:01:19.130> go<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.189> Xcode<00:01:20.640> a<00:01:20.939> create<00:01:21.900> a

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
simulator here I go to Xcode a create a

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.090 
simulator here I go to Xcode a create a
new<00:01:22.140> project<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:23.150> view<00:01:24.150> based<00:01:24.390> application

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
new project a view based application

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.660 
new project a view based application
call<00:01:26.100> it<00:01:26.250> graphics<00:01:26.820> one<00:01:27.470> for<00:01:28.470> iphone<00:01:28.920> as<00:01:29.250> you

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
call it graphics one for iphone as you

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.030 
call it graphics one for iphone as you
can<00:01:29.790> see<00:01:29.939> here<00:01:30.150> is<00:01:30.210> just<00:01:30.390> for<00:01:30.509> iphone<00:01:30.810> so<00:01:31.740> next

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040

go through these in the other videos but
for<00:03:58.340> now<00:03:58.459> we're<00:03:58.670> going<00:03:58.790> to<00:03:58.850> use<00:03:59.030> a<00:03:59.060> simplest

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 
for now we're going to use a simplest

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:00.940 
for now we're going to use a simplest
one<00:03:59.810> which<00:03:59.989> is<00:04:00.109> called<00:04:00.290> animate<00:04:00.769> with

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
one which is called animate with

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.690 
one which is called animate with
duration<00:04:01.340> and<00:04:02.049> simply<00:04:03.049> you<00:04:03.890> will<00:04:04.069> provide<00:04:04.519> the

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
duration and simply you will provide the

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.900 
duration and simply you will provide the
duration<00:04:05.329> in<00:04:05.480> seconds<00:04:05.930> and<00:04:06.609> then<00:04:07.609> you<00:04:07.760> will

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
duration in seconds and then you will

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.270 
duration in seconds and then you will
tell<00:04:08.209> you<00:04:08.750> will<00:04:08.780> provide<00:04:09.079> a<00:04:09.260> block<00:04:09.560> object<00:04:10.040> and

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
tell you will provide a block object and

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.740 
tell you will provide a block object and
in<00:04:10.370> that<00:04:10.519> block<00:04:10.760> object<00:04:11.180> you<00:04:11.299> will<00:04:11.420> do<00:04:11.569> all

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
in that block object you will do all

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.259 
in that block object you will do all
your<00:04:11.959> animations<00:04:12.470> so<00:04:12.739> say<00:04:13.519> we<00:04:13.700> want<00:04:13.880> to<00:04:13.970> rotate

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:14.269 
your animations so say we want to rotate

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:17.529 
your animations so say we want to rotate
the<00:04:14.630> target<00:04:14.989> button<00:04:15.260> clockwise<00:04:16.130> 90<00:04:17.060> degrees

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:17.539 
the target button clockwise 90 degrees

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:20.879 
the target button clockwise 90 degrees
every<00:04:17.840> time<00:04:17.989> we<00:04:18.760> press<00:04:19.760> the<00:04:20.060> button

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:20.889 
every time we press the button

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:25.050 
every time we press the button
so<00:04:21.669> I<00:04:21.699> say<00:04:22.389> okay<00:04:22.419> I<00:04:22.659> want<00:04:22.900> this<00:04:22.960> and<00:04:23.289> I<00:04:23.379> want<00:04:24.060> the

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
so I say okay I want this and I want the

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.589 
so I say okay I want this and I want the
animation<00:04:25.389> to<00:04:25.569> take<00:04:25.870> one<00:04:26.139> second<00:04:27.240> i'll<00:04:28.240> jump

00:04:28.589 --> 00:04:28.599 
animation to take one second i'll jump

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:32.189 
animation to take one second i'll jump
here<00:04:29.129> i'll<00:04:30.129> press<00:04:30.460> enter<00:04:30.849> if<00:04:31.090> it<00:04:31.539> completes<00:04:32.050> a

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:32.199 
here i'll press enter if it completes a

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:37.200 
here i'll press enter if it completes a
block<00:04:32.379> for<00:04:32.650> me<00:04:33.180> get<00:04:34.180> rid<00:04:34.300> of<00:04:34.389> the<00:04:34.479> code<00:04:36.210> perfect

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
block for me get rid of the code perfect

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:38.640 
block for me get rid of the code perfect
like<00:04:37.300> a<00:04:37.330> so<00:04:37.479> whatever<00:04:37.779> you<00:04:37.930> right<00:04:38.139> here<00:04:38.499> is

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
like a so whatever you right here is

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.559 
like a so whatever you right here is
going<00:04:38.800> to<00:04:38.860> be<00:04:39.009> animated<00:04:39.699> it's<00:04:39.879> just<00:04:40.180> really

00:04:40.559 --> 00:04:40.569 
going to be animated it's just really

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:45.450 
going to be animated it's just really
really<00:04:40.719> really<00:04:41.259> magic<00:04:42.150> so<00:04:43.150> I<00:04:43.569> will<00:04:44.219> first<00:04:45.219> have

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
really really magic so I will first have

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:52.339 
really really magic so I will first have
to<00:04:45.990> get<00:04:46.990> the<00:04:47.169> previous<00:04:47.529> and<00:04:48.840> transformation<00:04:49.840> I

00:04:52.339 --> 00:04:52.349 

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:56.519 

will<00:04:53.349> say<00:04:53.529> previous<00:04:54.300> transformation<00:04:55.529> I'll

00:04:56.519 --> 00:04:56.529 
will say previous transformation I'll

00:04:56.529 --> 00:05:00.929 
will say previous transformation I'll
say<00:04:56.860> button<00:04:57.370> targets<00:04:57.849> transform<00:04:59.759> all<00:05:00.759> right

00:05:00.929 --> 00:05:00.939 
say button targets transform all right

00:05:00.939 --> 00:05:03.480 
say button targets transform all right
and<00:05:01.810> all<00:05:01.960> these<00:05:02.110> are<00:05:02.379> really<00:05:02.830> explained<00:05:03.370> in

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
and all these are really explained in

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.760 
and all these are really explained in
the<00:05:03.610> graphics<00:05:04.029> and<00:05:04.180> animation<00:05:04.689> in<00:05:04.930> iOS<00:05:05.469> book

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
the graphics and animation in iOS book

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.149 
the graphics and animation in iOS book
so<00:05:06.250> I<00:05:06.279> won't<00:05:06.580> go<00:05:06.939> in<00:05:07.150> too<00:05:07.599> much<00:05:07.779> details<00:05:08.289> the

00:05:09.149 --> 00:05:09.159 
so I won't go in too much details the

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:11.010 
so I won't go in too much details the
whole<00:05:09.370> point<00:05:09.909> as<00:05:10.090> I<00:05:10.210> said<00:05:10.449> it's<00:05:10.569> just<00:05:10.629> learn

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 
whole point as I said it's just learn

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.159 
whole point as I said it's just learn
about<00:05:11.259> the<00:05:11.409> new<00:05:11.529> block<00:05:11.800> object<00:05:12.310> animations

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:13.169 
about the new block object animations

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:17.700 
about the new block object animations
then<00:05:14.169> I<00:05:14.199> will<00:05:14.469> create<00:05:14.740> a<00:05:14.830> new<00:05:15.270> rotation<00:05:16.710> new

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 
then I will create a new rotation new

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:24.779 
then I will create a new rotation new
rotation<00:05:18.370> transformation<00:05:19.740> I'll<00:05:20.740> do<00:05:21.639> a<00:05:23.789> 90

00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:24.789 
rotation transformation I'll do a 90

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:31.200 
rotation transformation I'll do a 90
degrees<00:05:25.710> rotation<00:05:27.990> and<00:05:29.460> I<00:05:30.460> will<00:05:30.610> concatenate

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:31.210 
degrees rotation and I will concatenate

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:33.179 
degrees rotation and I will concatenate
these<00:05:31.719> two<00:05:32.020> to<00:05:32.289> create<00:05:32.589> a<00:05:32.620> new<00:05:32.710> affine

00:05:33.179 --> 00:05:33.189 
these two to create a new affine

00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:44.690 
these two to create a new affine
transformation

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:44.700 

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.370 

previous<00:05:45.870> transformation<00:05:46.870> can<00:05:47.050> catenate

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:47.380 
previous transformation can catenate

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:50.120 
previous transformation can catenate
with<00:05:47.770> the<00:05:47.890> new<00:05:48.100> rotation<00:05:48.550> transformation<00:05:48.970> and

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:50.130 
with the new rotation transformation and

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:53.420 
with the new rotation transformation and
I'll<00:05:51.130> assign<00:05:51.610> it<00:05:51.760> to<00:05:51.790> the<00:05:51.940> button<00:05:52.180> so<00:05:52.990> easy

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:53.430 
I'll assign it to the button so easy

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:56.700 
I'll assign it to the button so easy
I'll<00:05:54.430> say<00:05:54.760> new<00:05:55.180> transformation<00:05:55.810> that's

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:56.710 
I'll say new transformation that's

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:57.960 
I'll say new transformation that's
that's<00:05:57.040> that's<00:05:57.190> really<00:05:57.310> all<00:05:57.610> I'm<00:05:57.790> going<00:05:57.880> to

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:57.970 
that's that's really all I'm going to

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:00.870 
that's that's really all I'm going to
compile<00:05:58.300> the<00:05:58.420> application<00:05:59.520> we've<00:06:00.520> got<00:06:00.640> one

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:00.880 
compile the application we've got one

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:07.080 
compile the application we've got one
issue<00:06:01.120> here<00:06:02.490> okay<00:06:04.020> multiply<00:06:05.310> great<00:06:06.310> will

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:07.090 
issue here okay multiply great will

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:08.670 
issue here okay multiply great will
succeed<00:06:07.510> it<00:06:07.660> I'm<00:06:07.810> going<00:06:07.990> to<00:06:08.080> run<00:06:08.200> it<00:06:08.320> now<00:06:08.440> and

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:08.680 
succeed it I'm going to run it now and

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:13.140 
succeed it I'm going to run it now and
see<00:06:08.830> what<00:06:08.920> happens<00:06:10.920> here<00:06:11.920> it<00:06:12.010> is<00:06:12.100> the<00:06:12.490> exact

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:13.150 
see what happens here it is the exact

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:15.180 
see what happens here it is the exact
same<00:06:13.410> effect<00:06:14.410> that<00:06:14.560> I<00:06:14.590> showed<00:06:14.860> you<00:06:14.890> in<00:06:15.160> the

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:15.190 
same effect that I showed you in the

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:17.490 
same effect that I showed you in the
beginning<00:06:15.310> of<00:06:15.670> this<00:06:15.790> video<00:06:16.050> so<00:06:17.050> just<00:06:17.350> go<00:06:17.470> ahead

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:17.500 
beginning of this video so just go ahead

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:20.520 
beginning of this video so just go ahead
and<00:06:17.820> play<00:06:18.820> with<00:06:19.030> this<00:06:19.210> it's<00:06:19.780> really<00:06:20.230> really

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:20.530 
and play with this it's really really

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:22.830 
and play with this it's really really
cool<00:06:20.740> and<00:06:21.040> you<00:06:21.970> can<00:06:22.120> do<00:06:22.210> a<00:06:22.240> lot<00:06:22.330> of<00:06:22.390> things<00:06:22.510> in

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:22.840 
cool and you can do a lot of things in

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.510 
cool and you can do a lot of things in
here<00:06:22.870> I<00:06:23.110> don't<00:06:23.170> know<00:06:23.350> just<00:06:23.560> for<00:06:24.010> example<00:06:24.100> if

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:24.520 
here I don't know just for example if

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:33.390 
here I don't know just for example if
the<00:06:26.340> if<00:06:27.340> the<00:06:27.580> buttons<00:06:28.180> alpha<00:06:29.110> is<00:06:29.350> 1<00:06:32.130> then<00:06:33.130> you

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:33.400 
the if the buttons alpha is 1 then you

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:43.790 
the if the buttons alpha is 1 then you
can<00:06:33.610> turn<00:06:33.880> it<00:06:35.340> to<00:06:36.340> 0<00:06:37.770> elves<00:06:42.090> so<00:06:43.090> you<00:06:43.210> can<00:06:43.420> just

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:43.800 
can turn it to 0 elves so you can just

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.890 
can turn it to 0 elves so you can just
fade<00:06:44.800> it<00:06:45.010> in<00:06:45.220> and<00:06:45.430> fade<00:06:45.640> it<00:06:45.760> up<00:06:45.910> so<00:06:46.480> as<00:06:46.660> you<00:06:46.780> can

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:46.900 
fade it in and fade it up so as you can

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:52.920 
fade it in and fade it up so as you can
see<00:06:47.110> here<00:06:48.570> see<00:06:49.570> what<00:06:49.720> happens<00:06:50.760> all<00:06:51.840> sorts<00:06:52.840> of

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:52.930 
see here see what happens all sorts of

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:54.600 
see here see what happens all sorts of
animation<00:06:53.380> is<00:06:53.470> you<00:06:53.560> can<00:06:53.680> do<00:06:53.800> here<00:06:54.100> just<00:06:54.340> feel

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:54.610 
animation is you can do here just feel

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:59.250 
animation is you can do here just feel
free<00:06:54.910> and<00:06:55.500> use<00:06:56.500> your<00:06:56.650> imagination<00:06:57.310> and<00:06:58.140> in<00:06:59.140> the

00:06:59.250 --> 00:06:59.260 
free and use your imagination and in the
