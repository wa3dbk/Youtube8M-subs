00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:15.719 
angle so that I can get lift and the

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:19.969 
angle so that I can get lift and the
idea<00:01:15.990> is<00:01:17.420> kind<00:01:18.420> of<00:01:18.539> like<00:01:18.710> grabbing<00:01:19.710> a

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:15.129 
rotate faster and it also prevents you

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:16.619 
rotate faster and it also prevents you
from<00:02:15.159> slamming<00:02:15.760> your<00:02:15.879> face<00:02:16.060> onto<00:02:16.390> your<00:02:16.510> knees

00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:16.629 
from slamming your face onto your knees

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:20.309 
from slamming your face onto your knees
so<00:02:17.379> a<00:02:17.849> lot<00:02:18.849> safer<00:02:19.030> do<00:02:19.299> a<00:02:19.329> cowboy<00:02:19.629> position<00:02:20.019> and

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
so a lot safer do a cowboy position and

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:22.589 
so a lot safer do a cowboy position and
there's<00:02:20.469> gonna<00:02:20.620> be<00:02:20.909> no<00:02:21.909> landing<00:02:22.269> on<00:02:22.390> it<00:02:22.480> at

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 
there's gonna be no landing on it at

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:30.690 
there's gonna be no landing on it at
first<00:02:22.780> so<00:02:23.109> just<00:02:23.469> watch<00:02:28.290> the<00:02:29.290> idea<00:02:29.590> is<00:02:29.799> I<00:02:30.189> need

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
first so just watch the idea is I need

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.610 
first so just watch the idea is I need
to<00:02:30.819> get<00:02:30.969> comfortable<00:02:31.389> tucking<00:02:32.260> at<00:02:32.379> the<00:02:32.469> right

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
to get comfortable tucking at the right

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.500 
to get comfortable tucking at the right
time<00:02:32.799> so<00:02:33.219> it's<00:02:33.549> gonna<00:02:33.670> vary

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
time so it's gonna vary

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.319 
time so it's gonna vary
nobody's<00:02:35.109> front<00:02:35.379> flips<00:02:35.590> are<00:02:35.859> consistent<00:02:36.819> they

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:37.329 
nobody's front flips are consistent they

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:39.149 
nobody's front flips are consistent they
can<00:02:37.510> get<00:02:37.659> up<00:02:37.780> to<00:02:37.900> a<00:02:37.930> certain<00:02:38.019> range<00:02:38.590> but

00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:39.159 
can get up to a certain range but

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:40.740 
can get up to a certain range but
they're<00:02:39.310> not<00:02:39.400> gonna<00:02:39.519> get<00:02:39.700> the<00:02:39.819> same<00:02:40.120> lift

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
they're not gonna get the same lift

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.339 
they're not gonna get the same lift
every<00:02:41.349> single<00:02:41.739> time<00:02:41.980> so<00:02:43.109> we've<00:02:44.109> done<00:02:44.319> our

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:44.349 
every single time so we've done our

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:46.589 
every single time so we've done our
punching<00:02:45.159> our<00:02:45.549> setting<00:02:45.939> and<00:02:46.060> spotting<00:02:46.419> our

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:46.599 
punching our setting and spotting our

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:49.470 
punching our setting and spotting our
tuck<00:02:47.290> now<00:02:48.010> the<00:02:48.069> last<00:02:48.310> thing<00:02:48.430> is<00:02:48.579> landing<00:02:49.090> now

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
tuck now the last thing is landing now

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.940 
tuck now the last thing is landing now
landing<00:02:49.959> a<00:02:50.019> front<00:02:50.260> flip<00:02:50.349> sounds<00:02:50.769> like<00:02:50.859> it

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
landing a front flip sounds like it

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.649 
landing a front flip sounds like it
would<00:02:51.040> be<00:02:51.069> rather<00:02:51.340> easy<00:02:51.579> but<00:02:52.090> it's<00:02:52.239> not<00:02:52.389> just

00:02:52.649 --> 00:02:52.659 
would be rather easy but it's not just

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:55.170 
would be rather easy but it's not just
landing<00:02:53.200> you<00:02:53.620> also<00:02:53.859> have<00:02:54.189> to<00:02:54.310> figure<00:02:54.459> out<00:02:54.669> what

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
landing you also have to figure out what

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.940 
landing you also have to figure out what
you're<00:02:55.329> doing<00:02:55.359> out<00:02:55.780> of<00:02:55.810> it<00:02:56.019> or<00:02:56.200> what<00:02:56.500> you

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
you're doing out of it or what you

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.360 
you're doing out of it or what you
expect<00:02:57.430> to<00:02:57.459> connect<00:02:58.079> ok<00:02:59.079> so<00:02:59.530> the<00:03:00.010> first<00:03:00.189> thing

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
expect to connect ok so the first thing

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:01.860 
expect to connect ok so the first thing
we're<00:03:00.609> gonna<00:03:00.669> do<00:03:00.909> is<00:03:01.090> we're<00:03:01.299> just<00:03:01.329> gonna<00:03:01.480> pull

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
we're gonna do is we're just gonna pull

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:13.289 
we're gonna do is we're just gonna pull
and<00:03:02.139> just<00:03:02.799> land<00:03:03.010> a<00:03:03.219> regular<00:03:03.879> front<00:03:04.090> flip<00:03:12.269> okay

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299 
and just land a regular front flip okay

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:15.420 
and just land a regular front flip okay
nothing<00:03:14.079> to<00:03:14.199> it<00:03:14.319> didn't<00:03:14.560> have<00:03:14.709> any<00:03:14.949> proper

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
nothing to it didn't have any proper

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.069 
nothing to it didn't have any proper
body<00:03:15.790> position<00:03:15.879> at<00:03:16.359> the<00:03:16.449> end<00:03:16.599> I<00:03:16.750> just<00:03:16.780> kind<00:03:17.049> of

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:17.079 
body position at the end I just kind of

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:19.800 
body position at the end I just kind of
landed<00:03:17.260> hands<00:03:17.620> down<00:03:17.919> facing<00:03:18.819> forward<00:03:19.239> look

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
landed hands down facing forward look

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.020 
landed hands down facing forward look
pretty<00:03:20.019> simple<00:03:20.409> my<00:03:20.739> energy<00:03:21.310> traveled<00:03:21.699> up<00:03:21.849> and

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
pretty simple my energy traveled up and

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.809 
pretty simple my energy traveled up and
down<00:03:22.150> and<00:03:22.510> as<00:03:23.319> soon<00:03:23.409> as<00:03:23.620> I<00:03:23.709> landed<00:03:23.949> all<00:03:24.220> energy

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:24.819 
down and as soon as I landed all energy

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:28.500 
down and as soon as I landed all energy
was<00:03:25.180> killed<00:03:25.449> it<00:03:25.930> was<00:03:26.049> done<00:03:26.319> try<00:03:27.220> to<00:03:27.280> land<00:03:27.549> have

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
was killed it was done try to land have

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.140 
was killed it was done try to land have
your<00:03:28.689> arms<00:03:28.959> up<00:03:29.109> ready<00:03:29.620> to<00:03:29.709> go<00:03:29.949> back<00:03:30.189> into<00:03:30.609> the

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
your arms up ready to go back into the

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.210 
your arms up ready to go back into the
next<00:03:31.389> go<00:03:31.540> so<00:03:32.019> you<00:03:32.109> have<00:03:32.260> to<00:03:32.439> land<00:03:32.739> in<00:03:33.069> the<00:03:33.189> same

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
next go so you have to land in the same

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.069 
next go so you have to land in the same
position<00:03:34.060> that<00:03:34.090> you<00:03:34.269> took<00:03:34.510> off<00:03:34.750> so<00:03:35.019> that

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:35.079 
position that you took off so that

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:36.599 
position that you took off so that
you're<00:03:35.290> able<00:03:35.379> to<00:03:35.530> get<00:03:35.709> that<00:03:35.769> same<00:03:36.189> amount<00:03:36.340> of

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:36.609 
you're able to get that same amount of

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:38.490 
you're able to get that same amount of
power<00:03:36.790> and<00:03:37.030> the<00:03:37.120> same<00:03:37.329> amount<00:03:37.540> of<00:03:37.629> control<00:03:37.930> so

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
power and the same amount of control so

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.110 
power and the same amount of control so
we're<00:03:38.590> gonna<00:03:38.680> go<00:03:38.859> ahead<00:03:38.949> and<00:03:39.069> do<00:03:39.280> a<00:03:39.310> front<00:03:40.030> flip

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
we're gonna go ahead and do a front flip

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:47.729 
we're gonna go ahead and do a front flip
into<00:03:40.859> just<00:03:41.859> a<00:03:42.040> regular<00:03:42.430> rebound<00:03:46.739> the

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
into just a regular rebound the

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:49.499 
into just a regular rebound the
direction<00:03:48.250> that<00:03:48.370> your<00:03:48.549> rebound<00:03:48.970> is<00:03:49.239> the

00:03:49.499 --> 00:03:49.509 
direction that your rebound is the

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:50.759 
direction that your rebound is the
direction<00:03:49.870> that<00:03:49.959> you're<00:03:50.079> gonna<00:03:50.169> go<00:03:50.349> so<00:03:50.590> if<00:03:50.680> I

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769 
direction that you're gonna go so if I

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:52.229 
direction that you're gonna go so if I
rebound<00:03:51.069> up<00:03:51.220> I'm<00:03:51.370> going<00:03:51.639> up<00:03:51.759> if<00:03:51.879> I<00:03:51.970> move<00:03:52.120> on

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 
rebound up I'm going up if I move on

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:53.909 
rebound up I'm going up if I move on
back<00:03:52.419> I'm<00:03:52.659> going<00:03:52.810> back<00:03:53.049> ever<00:03:53.379> going<00:03:53.530> forward

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:53.919 
back I'm going back ever going forward

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:55.170 
back I'm going back ever going forward
I'm<00:03:54.069> going<00:03:54.250> forward<00:03:54.459> if<00:03:54.699> I<00:03:54.759> read<00:03:54.909> out<00:03:54.970> to<00:03:55.120> the

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
I'm going forward if I read out to the

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.550 
I'm going forward if I read out to the
side<00:03:55.389> I'm<00:03:55.599> probably<00:03:55.780> false<00:03:56.139> the<00:03:56.259> trampoline

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
side I'm probably false the trampoline

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.740 
side I'm probably false the trampoline
so<00:03:57.459> make<00:03:57.729> sure<00:03:57.939> you<00:03:58.120> know<00:03:58.329> which<00:03:58.509> direction

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
so make sure you know which direction

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.659 
so make sure you know which direction
you<00:03:59.199> want<00:03:59.409> to<00:03:59.470> go<00:03:59.620> make<00:04:00.250> sure<00:04:00.370> you<00:04:00.459> practice

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:00.669 
you want to go make sure you practice

00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:02.819 
you want to go make sure you practice
keeping<00:04:01.389> those<00:04:01.479> arms<00:04:01.750> up<00:04:01.870> then<00:04:02.560> when<00:04:02.709> you're

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:02.829 
keeping those arms up then when you're

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:04.649 
keeping those arms up then when you're
comfortable<00:04:03.040> go<00:04:03.639> punch<00:04:04.060> front<00:04:04.269> two<00:04:04.479> punch

00:04:04.649 --> 00:04:04.659 
comfortable go punch front two punch

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:14.339 
comfortable go punch front two punch
right<00:04:12.030> let's<00:04:13.030> move<00:04:13.180> on<00:04:13.329> to<00:04:13.359> front<00:04:13.659> pikes<00:04:13.840> front

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:14.349 
right let's move on to front pikes front

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:16.469 
right let's move on to front pikes front
pikes<00:04:14.560> actually<00:04:15.310> are<00:04:15.519> a<00:04:15.549> little<00:04:16.060> bit<00:04:16.299> more

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:16.479 
pikes actually are a little bit more

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:18.300 
pikes actually are a little bit more
dangerous<00:04:16.659> than<00:04:17.169> a<00:04:17.259> front<00:04:17.500> tuck<00:04:17.650> and<00:04:18.070> the

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
dangerous than a front tuck and the

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.310 
dangerous than a front tuck and the
reason<00:04:18.639> is<00:04:18.789> when<00:04:19.269> you<00:04:19.359> open<00:04:19.810> a<00:04:19.870> front<00:04:20.049> Pike

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
reason is when you open a front Pike

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.120 
reason is when you open a front Pike
it's<00:04:20.620> kind<00:04:20.859> of<00:04:20.919> like<00:04:21.039> a<00:04:21.070> spring

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
it's kind of like a spring

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:23.890 
it's kind of like a spring
you're<00:04:22.700> straightened<00:04:23.210> out<00:04:23.330> as<00:04:23.510> far<00:04:23.690> as<00:04:23.720> you

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
you're straightened out as far as you

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.110 
you're straightened out as far as you
can<00:04:24.050> be<00:04:24.230> you<00:04:24.500> pull<00:04:24.740> into<00:04:24.950> the<00:04:25.160> pike<00:04:25.370> and<00:04:25.640> then

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
can be you pull into the pike and then

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.090 
can be you pull into the pike and then
as<00:04:26.270> soon<00:04:26.420> as<00:04:26.540> you<00:04:26.690> open<00:04:26.720> it<00:04:27.140> over<00:04:27.470> rotates<00:04:27.920> you

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100 
as soon as you open it over rotates you

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.160 
as soon as you open it over rotates you
you<00:04:28.580> throws<00:04:28.970> you<00:04:29.150> over<00:04:29.480> like<00:04:29.690> if<00:04:29.870> there<00:04:30.020> was<00:04:30.140> a

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:30.170 
you throws you over like if there was a

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:32.200 
you throws you over like if there was a
spring<00:04:30.530> between<00:04:30.710> your<00:04:31.100> chest<00:04:31.400> and<00:04:31.670> your<00:04:32.000> knees

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
spring between your chest and your knees

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.090 
spring between your chest and your knees
and<00:04:32.510> it<00:04:32.600> just<00:04:32.750> shoots<00:04:32.990> you<00:04:33.170> out<00:04:33.320> so<00:04:33.770> a<00:04:33.800> lot<00:04:34.010> of

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 
and it just shoots you out so a lot of

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.310 
and it just shoots you out so a lot of
people<00:04:34.370> sometimes<00:04:34.640> over<00:04:35.420> rotate<00:04:35.870> and<00:04:36.050> land<00:04:36.200> on

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
people sometimes over rotate and land on

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.110 
people sometimes over rotate and land on
their<00:04:36.440> face<00:04:36.650> and<00:04:37.010> not<00:04:37.730> the<00:04:37.850> most<00:04:37.940> comfortable

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
their face and not the most comfortable

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.180 
their face and not the most comfortable
thing<00:04:38.420> so<00:04:38.660> when<00:04:38.780> you<00:04:38.870> think<00:04:39.020> of<00:04:39.200> a<00:04:39.320> front<00:04:39.890> pike

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
thing so when you think of a front pike

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.520 
thing so when you think of a front pike
think<00:04:40.970> about<00:04:41.180> opening<00:04:41.600> slightly<00:04:42.110> earlier

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:42.530 
think about opening slightly earlier

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:49.420 
think about opening slightly earlier
than<00:04:42.590> you<00:04:43.130> would<00:04:43.310> a<00:04:43.340> regular<00:04:43.490> tuck<00:04:48.430> holding

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
than you would a regular tuck holding

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.120 
than you would a regular tuck holding
the<00:04:49.700> pike<00:04:50.270> and<00:04:50.620> controlling<00:04:51.620> the<00:04:51.740> front<00:04:51.950> pike

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.130 
the pike and controlling the front pike

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:55.060 
the pike and controlling the front pike
is<00:04:52.810> very<00:04:53.810> complicated<00:04:54.350> you<00:04:54.530> got<00:04:54.680> to<00:04:54.770> make<00:04:54.860> sure

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
is very complicated you got to make sure

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:57.460 
is very complicated you got to make sure
that<00:04:55.340> your<00:04:55.820> pike<00:04:56.120> position<00:04:56.390> sitting<00:04:57.230> in<00:04:57.410> a

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
that your pike position sitting in a

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:58.750 
that your pike position sitting in a
pike<00:04:57.680> and<00:04:57.830> stretching<00:04:58.160> down<00:04:58.250> for<00:04:58.460> your<00:04:58.550> toes

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:58.760 
pike and stretching down for your toes

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.040 
pike and stretching down for your toes
that<00:04:59.330> you're<00:04:59.450> comfortable<00:04:59.900> with<00:04:59.990> that

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
that you're comfortable with that

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:01.780 
that you're comfortable with that
because<00:05:00.860> you<00:05:00.980> can<00:05:01.250> pull<00:05:01.520> something

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:01.790 
because you can pull something

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:02.920 
because you can pull something
especially<00:05:02.240> if<00:05:02.270> you<00:05:02.390> haven't<00:05:02.540> warmed<00:05:02.780> up

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
especially if you haven't warmed up

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.110 
especially if you haven't warmed up
properly<00:05:02.990> so<00:05:03.530> if<00:05:04.250> you<00:05:04.460> want<00:05:04.670> to<00:05:04.760> get<00:05:04.850> a<00:05:04.880> front

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 
properly so if you want to get a front

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.050 
properly so if you want to get a front
pike<00:05:05.240> all<00:05:05.510> it<00:05:05.660> is<00:05:05.810> is<00:05:06.550> locking<00:05:07.550> out<00:05:07.670> your<00:05:07.700> legs

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.060 
pike all it is is locking out your legs

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:09.610 
pike all it is is locking out your legs
and<00:05:08.300> instead<00:05:08.600> of<00:05:08.720> reaching<00:05:08.930> for<00:05:09.170> your<00:05:09.470> knees

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:09.620

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.440 
and instead of reaching for your knees

the only thing you got to worry about

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:37.660

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:39.770 
over-rotating it's hyperextension

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.130 
over-rotating it's hyperextension
sometimes<00:05:40.550> people<00:05:40.850> don't<00:05:41.090> know<00:05:41.240> when<00:05:41.810> to<00:05:41.930> land

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:42.140

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000 
and if you land heels and your legs are

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:44.680 
and if you land heels and your legs are
locked<00:05:44.240> out

locked out

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:46.270 
locked out
you<00:05:44.930> can<00:05:45.110> definitely<00:05:45.350> hyper<00:05:45.800> extend<00:05:46.190> your

you practice them a lot before actually

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:50.890 
you practice them a lot before actually
cranking<00:05:50.030> them<00:05:50.120> onto<00:05:50.360> something
