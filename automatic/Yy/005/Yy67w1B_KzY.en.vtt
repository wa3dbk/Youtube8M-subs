is<00:00:15.570> a<00:00:15.599> bonanza<00:00:16.199> and<00:00:16.910> it's<00:00:17.910> up<00:00:18.390> on<00:00:18.570> jacks<00:00:18.930> which

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
is a bonanza and it's up on jacks which

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.290 
is a bonanza and it's up on jacks which
is<00:00:19.439> typically<00:00:19.890> what<00:00:20.010> we<00:00:20.400> do<00:00:20.580> in<00:00:20.850> service

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300

the<00:00:25.199> airplane<00:00:25.619> put<00:00:26.130> it<00:00:26.220> on<00:00:26.340> jacks<00:00:26.810> then

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
the airplane put it on jacks then

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.870 
the airplane put it on jacks then
release<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.529> pressure<00:00:28.769> in<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.220> struts<00:00:29.580> and

release the pressure in the struts and

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.510 
release the pressure in the struts and
then<00:00:30.570> he<00:00:30.840> would<00:00:30.990> have<00:00:31.199> to<00:00:31.439> attach<00:00:31.769> a<00:00:31.949> hose<00:00:32.130> to

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
then he would have to attach a hose to

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.069 
then he would have to attach a hose to

physically by lifting the wheel up off
the<00:00:39.120> ground<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:39.719> then<00:00:40.410> we<00:00:40.620> use<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:41.100> strut

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
the ground and then we use the strut

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.510 
the ground and then we use the strut
like<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.059> big<00:00:42.360> syringe<00:00:42.780> to<00:00:43.350> pull<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:44.100> fluid

the<00:02:09.869> valve<00:02:10.080> and<00:02:10.970> then<00:02:11.970> simply<00:02:12.890> pump<00:02:13.890> the<00:02:14.070> pump

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
the valve and then simply pump the pump

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.410 
the valve and then simply pump the pump
to<00:02:14.970> force<00:02:15.780> fluid<00:02:16.230> into<00:02:16.770> the<00:02:16.800> strut<00:02:17.420> extending

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
to force fluid into the strut extending

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.780 
to force fluid into the strut extending
the<00:02:18.540> strut<00:02:18.840> when<00:02:19.530> we<00:02:19.650> know<00:02:19.800> the<00:02:20.040> strut<00:02:20.370> is<00:02:20.550> is

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
the strut when we know the strut is is

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.230 
the strut when we know the strut is is
full<00:02:21.270> we'll<00:02:22.110> release<00:02:22.470> the<00:02:22.530> excess<00:02:23.040> fluid<00:02:23.370> it's

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
full we'll release the excess fluid it's

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.330 
full we'll release the excess fluid it's
as<00:02:24.420> simple<00:02:24.570> as<00:02:24.870> that<00:02:24.930> we<00:02:25.800> don't<00:02:25.980> need<00:02:26.100> any

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
as simple as that we don't need any

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.050 
as simple as that we don't need any
jacks<00:02:26.840> it's<00:02:27.840> very<00:02:28.260> straightforward<00:02:28.590> so<00:02:29.250> now

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
jacks it's very straightforward so now

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.940 
jacks it's very straightforward so now
let's<00:02:30.300> go<00:02:30.480> try<00:02:30.930> it<00:02:30.960> on<00:02:31.110> an<00:02:31.230> aircraft<00:02:31.380> and<00:02:31.830> see

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
let's go try it on an aircraft and see

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.570 
let's go try it on an aircraft and see
how<00:02:32.040> it<00:02:32.100> works<00:02:32.310> yeah<00:02:33.440> okay<00:02:34.440> we're<00:02:35.310> under<00:02:35.550> a

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
how it works yeah okay we're under a

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.660 
how it works yeah okay we're under a
piper<00:02:36.000> Lance<00:02:36.390> right<00:02:36.810> now<00:02:36.990> and<00:02:37.380> I'm<00:02:38.340> going<00:02:38.610> to

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
piper Lance right now and I'm going to

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.660 
piper Lance right now and I'm going to
connect<00:02:39.290> the<00:02:40.290> stretch<00:02:40.590> fitting<00:02:41.010> to<00:02:41.400> the

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
connect the stretch fitting to the

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.080 
connect the stretch fitting to the
Schrader<00:02:41.970> valve<00:02:43.100> now<00:02:44.100> we've<00:02:44.310> we've<00:02:44.730> connected

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
Schrader valve now we've we've connected

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.840 
Schrader valve now we've we've connected
our<00:02:45.540> Schrader<00:02:46.170> our<00:02:46.470> fitting<00:02:47.280> to<00:02:47.490> the<00:02:47.580> Schrader

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
our Schrader our fitting to the Schrader

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.920 
our Schrader our fitting to the Schrader
valve<00:02:47.940> and<00:02:48.540> I'm<00:02:49.350> just<00:02:49.560> going<00:02:49.770> to<00:02:49.800> screw<00:02:50.220> in<00:02:50.930> our

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
valve and I'm just going to screw in our

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.449 
valve and I'm just going to screw in our
fitting<00:02:52.470> that<00:02:52.620> releases<00:02:53.340> the<00:02:53.760> valve<00:02:54.600> core

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
fitting that releases the valve core

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:00.800 
fitting that releases the valve core
depresses<00:02:56.459> the<00:02:56.489> valve<00:02:56.790> core<00:02:58.010> will<00:02:59.540> allow<00:03:00.540> us

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
depresses the valve core will allow us

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.800 
depresses the valve core will allow us
to<00:03:01.080> release<00:03:01.260> the<00:03:01.770> strut<00:03:02.070> pressure<00:03:02.570> now<00:03:03.570> we'll

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
to release the strut pressure now we'll

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.470 
to release the strut pressure now we'll
go<00:03:03.959> back<00:03:04.260> to<00:03:04.560> the<00:03:04.890> service<00:03:05.160> unit<00:03:05.459> open<00:03:06.239> the

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
go back to the service unit open the

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.740 
go back to the service unit open the
valve<00:03:06.870> there<00:03:07.320> and<00:03:07.590> then<00:03:08.310> that<00:03:08.580> will<00:03:08.820> allow<00:03:08.850> any

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
valve there and then that will allow any

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.199 
valve there and then that will allow any
pressure<00:03:10.170> buildup<00:03:10.650> in<00:03:10.830> the<00:03:10.980> strut<00:03:11.310> and<00:03:11.580> excess

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
pressure buildup in the strut and excess

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:18.080 
pressure buildup in the strut and excess
oil<00:03:12.570> to<00:03:13.440> go<00:03:14.040> back<00:03:14.280> to<00:03:14.640> the<00:03:15.090> waste<00:03:15.870> tank<00:03:16.260> on<00:03:17.090> the

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
oil to go back to the waste tank on the

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.060 
oil to go back to the waste tank on the
stripped<00:03:18.420> service<00:03:18.840> mode<00:03:19.110> we're<00:03:19.739> going<00:03:19.800> to

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
stripped service mode we're going to

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.170 
stripped service mode we're going to
open<00:03:20.250> the<00:03:20.720> relief<00:03:21.720> release<00:03:22.500> valve<00:03:23.150> and<00:03:24.150> you

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
open the relief release valve and you

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.690 
open the relief release valve and you
can<00:03:24.450> watch<00:03:24.630> this<00:03:24.959> the<00:03:25.260> strut<00:03:25.560> collapse<00:03:25.950> as<00:03:26.400> the

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
can watch this the strut collapse as the

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:32.020 
can watch this the strut collapse as the
strut<00:03:27.120> fluid<00:03:28.010> moves<00:03:29.010> back<00:03:29.250> to<00:03:29.700> the<00:03:29.730> pump<00:03:30.120> and

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
strut fluid moves back to the pump and

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.570 
strut fluid moves back to the pump and
you<00:03:32.300> see<00:03:32.660> a<00:03:32.690> little<00:03:32.990> bit<00:03:33.290> of<00:03:33.500> waste<00:03:33.770> oil<00:03:34.190> and

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
you see a little bit of waste oil and

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.920 
you see a little bit of waste oil and
the<00:03:35.390> other<00:03:35.510> side<00:03:35.810> of<00:03:35.840> the<00:03:36.590> waste<00:03:36.800> container

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
the other side of the waste container

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:49.949 
the other side of the waste container
all<00:03:38.930> we<00:03:39.080> have<00:03:39.200> to<00:03:39.319> do<00:03:40.330> is<00:03:41.330> close<00:03:41.720> the<00:03:41.900> valve

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:04:03.100 

there<00:03:50.959> goes<00:03:51.350> the<00:03:51.650> stretch<00:03:52.390> extending<00:04:02.110> okay

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.110 
there goes the stretch extending okay

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:04.990 
there goes the stretch extending okay
that<00:04:03.350> should<00:04:03.530> be<00:04:03.590> enough

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
that should be enough

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.940 
that should be enough
we<00:04:05.330> know<00:04:05.480> that<00:04:05.690> the<00:04:05.840> strut<00:04:06.110> has<00:04:06.290> plenty<00:04:06.650> of<00:04:06.739> oil

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
we know that the strut has plenty of oil

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.270 
we know that the strut has plenty of oil
in<00:04:07.190> it<00:04:07.400> at<00:04:07.610> this<00:04:07.850> point<00:04:08.180> so<00:04:09.080> all<00:04:09.530> we<00:04:09.800> have<00:04:09.950> to<00:04:10.130> do

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
in it at this point so all we have to do

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.850 
in it at this point so all we have to do
is<00:04:10.730> release<00:04:11.510> the<00:04:11.810> pressure<00:04:12.140> and<00:04:12.380> the<00:04:12.620> strut

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:12.860 
is release the pressure and the strut

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:18.460 
is release the pressure and the strut
again<00:04:14.860> all<00:04:15.860> the<00:04:16.130> excess<00:04:16.579> oil<00:04:16.790> moves<00:04:17.780> back<00:04:18.079> to

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
again all the excess oil moves back to

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:23.380 
again all the excess oil moves back to
the<00:04:19.359> reclaimed<00:04:20.359> tank<00:04:20.989> on<00:04:21.680> the<00:04:21.919> unit<00:04:22.250> and<00:04:22.400> we're

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:23.390 
the reclaimed tank on the unit and we're

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:27.719 
the reclaimed tank on the unit and we're
ready<00:04:23.600> to<00:04:23.990> remove<00:04:24.830> the<00:04:25.010> hose<00:04:25.430> and<00:04:25.880> add<00:04:26.440> the

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:27.729 
ready to remove the hose and add the

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:30.640 
ready to remove the hose and add the
nitrogen<00:04:28.729> pressure<00:04:29.000> to<00:04:29.419> pump<00:04:29.930> the<00:04:30.080> spread<00:04:30.350> up

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
nitrogen pressure to pump the spread up

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.520 
nitrogen pressure to pump the spread up
so<00:04:31.550> we<00:04:31.729> basically<00:04:32.270> accomplished<00:04:33.200> everything

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
so we basically accomplished everything

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.700 
so we basically accomplished everything
that<00:04:33.950> was<00:04:34.550> done<00:04:34.820> using<00:04:35.120> the<00:04:35.389> old<00:04:35.540> system<00:04:35.840> using

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
that was done using the old system using

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.520 
that was done using the old system using
the<00:04:36.800> jacks<00:04:37.190> and<00:04:37.550> crawling<00:04:38.000> under<00:04:38.180> there

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
the jacks and crawling under there

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.650 
the jacks and crawling under there
physically<00:04:39.530> manhandle<00:04:40.220> the<00:04:40.310> gear<00:04:40.669> but<00:04:41.630> we

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
physically manhandle the gear but we

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.230 
physically manhandle the gear but we
haven't<00:04:42.140> had<00:04:42.290> to<00:04:42.470> do<00:04:42.620> any<00:04:42.830> of<00:04:42.919> that<00:04:43.040> we've<00:04:43.729> done

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
haven't had to do any of that we've done

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.560 
haven't had to do any of that we've done
it<00:04:44.419> very<00:04:44.450> cleanly<00:04:44.990> neatly<00:04:45.470> and<00:04:45.860> safely<00:04:46.250> and

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 
it very cleanly neatly and safely and

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.590 
it very cleanly neatly and safely and
very<00:04:47.570> fast<00:04:47.900> okay<00:04:48.890> so<00:04:49.310> we've<00:04:49.910> attached<00:04:50.330> our

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:50.600 
very fast okay so we've attached our

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.810 
very fast okay so we've attached our
high-pressure<00:04:51.110> nitrogen<00:04:51.410> hose<00:04:51.979> to<00:04:52.400> the<00:04:52.520> strut

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:52.820 
high-pressure nitrogen hose to the strut

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:53.879 
high-pressure nitrogen hose to the strut
valve

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:53.889 
valve

00:04:53.889 --> 00:05:11.300 
valve
