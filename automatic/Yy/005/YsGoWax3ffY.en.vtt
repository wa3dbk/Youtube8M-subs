didn't really have anything except a

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.950 
didn't really have anything except a
couple<00:04:57.590> of<00:04:57.860> ingots<00:04:58.340> which<00:04:59.000> I<00:04:59.180> used<00:04:59.450> to<00:04:59.630> make<00:04:59.780> an

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
couple of ingots which I used to make an

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.050 
couple of ingots which I used to make an
iron<00:05:00.200> pickaxe<00:05:00.650> so<00:05:01.160> I<00:05:01.190> pretty<00:05:01.520> much<00:05:01.640> have

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
iron pickaxe so I pretty much have

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:03.820 
iron pickaxe so I pretty much have

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:03.830 
everything I could possibly want in the

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.610 
everything I could possibly want in the
iron<00:05:04.070> department<00:05:04.760> so<00:05:05.090> now<00:05:05.360> i<00:05:05.390> am<00:05:05.690> in<00:05:05.840> the<00:05:06.290> top

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:06.620 
iron department so now i am in the top

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.310 
iron department so now i am in the top
three<00:05:07.040> in<00:05:07.310> this<00:05:07.760> game<00:05:08.180> and<00:05:08.600> i<00:05:08.690> am<00:05:08.780> finding<00:05:09.110> out

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 
three in this game and i am finding out

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.170 
three in this game and i am finding out
pretty<00:05:09.560> quickly<00:05:09.860> that<00:05:10.160> i<00:05:10.400> am<00:05:10.610> dealing<00:05:10.910> with

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.180 
pretty quickly that i am dealing with

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.600 
pretty quickly that i am dealing with
two<00:05:11.480> chameleons<00:05:12.470> i'm<00:05:12.860> pretty<00:05:13.100> sure<00:05:13.340> they<00:05:13.520> are

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.610 
two chameleons i'm pretty sure they are

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.060 
two chameleons i'm pretty sure they are
on<00:05:13.640> a<00:05:13.820> team<00:05:14.180> so<00:05:15.170> it's<00:05:15.320> hard<00:05:15.560> to<00:05:15.620> get<00:05:15.770> these<00:05:15.890> guys

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:16.070 
on a team so it's hard to get these guys

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:18.520 
on a team so it's hard to get these guys
on<00:05:16.400> my<00:05:16.790> compass<00:05:17.330> but<00:05:17.870> all<00:05:17.990> you<00:05:18.170> have<00:05:18.260> to<00:05:18.380> really

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:18.530 
on my compass but all you have to really

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:20.680 
on my compass but all you have to really
do<00:05:18.770> is<00:05:18.920> just<00:05:19.130> hold<00:05:19.400> down<00:05:19.550> your<00:05:19.700> compass<00:05:20.390> and<00:05:20.540> it

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:20.690 
do is just hold down your compass and it

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:22.990 
do is just hold down your compass and it
will<00:05:20.840> attract<00:05:21.170> them<00:05:21.410> constantly<00:05:22.010> as<00:05:22.310> you<00:05:22.880> can

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 
will attract them constantly as you can

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.100 
will attract them constantly as you can
see<00:05:23.240> i<00:05:23.270> thought<00:05:23.390> they<00:05:23.810> might<00:05:23.960> have<00:05:24.080> been

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
see i thought they might have been

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:25.870 
see i thought they might have been
underground<00:05:24.650> over<00:05:25.070> there<00:05:25.250> so<00:05:25.490> that's<00:05:25.610> why<00:05:25.850> I

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:25.880 
underground over there so that's why I

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.550 
underground over there so that's why I
was<00:05:26.120> sort<00:05:26.330> of<00:05:26.390> breaking<00:05:26.690> random<00:05:27.170> blacks<00:05:27.410> with

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:27.560 
was sort of breaking random blacks with

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.770 
was sort of breaking random blacks with
my<00:05:27.680> sword<00:05:27.950> but<00:05:28.490> I<00:05:28.550> decided<00:05:28.940> not<00:05:29.180> to<00:05:29.390> waste<00:05:29.570> my

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:29.780 
my sword but I decided not to waste my

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:31.480 
my sword but I decided not to waste my
time<00:05:30.080> because<00:05:30.350> I<00:05:30.530> want<00:05:30.740> to<00:05:30.830> make<00:05:31.010> sure<00:05:31.040> I<00:05:31.220> can

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:31.490 
time because I want to make sure I can

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:33.490 
time because I want to make sure I can
get<00:05:31.610> the<00:05:31.790> fee<00:05:32.090> side<00:05:32.360> I<00:05:32.390> want<00:05:32.660> them<00:05:32.900> to<00:05:33.140> run<00:05:33.320> in

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:45.920 
and as you can see right there i was

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.310 
and as you can see right there i was

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:50.390 
so I have the general idea of where they

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:52.600 
so I have the general idea of where they
are<00:05:50.420> but<00:05:51.350> the<00:05:51.470> fees<00:05:51.650> is<00:05:51.830> about<00:05:52.010> to<00:05:52.160> start<00:05:52.370> so<00:05:52.460> I

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:52.610 
are but the fees is about to start so I

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:54.790 
are but the fees is about to start so I
q<00:05:52.970> some<00:05:53.180> soups<00:05:53.480> out<00:05:53.720> of<00:05:53.840> my<00:05:53.930> inventory<00:05:54.290> and<00:05:54.740> I

q some soups out of my inventory and I
go<00:05:55.040> in<00:05:55.250> and<00:05:55.460> raid<00:05:55.760> I<00:05:56.060> get<00:05:56.570> the<00:05:56.750> steak<00:05:57.050> the<00:05:57.080> TNT

00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:58.040 
go in and raid I get the steak the TNT

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.730 
go in and raid I get the steak the TNT
the<00:05:58.280> arrows<00:05:58.790> blah<00:05:59.210> blah<00:05:59.510> blah<00:05:59.540> I'm<00:06:00.320> able<00:06:00.590> to

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:00.740 
the arrows blah blah blah I'm able to

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:02.830 
the arrows blah blah blah I'm able to
get<00:06:00.920> full<00:06:01.280> diamond<00:06:01.610> minus<00:06:02.150> the<00:06:02.300> boots<00:06:02.510> and<00:06:02.750> a

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:04.970 
smite one sword so I guess that's pretty

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:07.990

good<00:06:05.180> I<00:06:05.450> blow<00:06:06.020> up<00:06:06.350> the<00:06:06.530> TNT<00:06:07.070> and<00:06:07.340> I<00:06:07.610> keep

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:08.000 
good I blow up the TNT and I keep

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.340 
good I blow up the TNT and I keep
following<00:06:08.480> my<00:06:08.600> compass<00:06:09.020> from<00:06:09.110> where<00:06:09.320> I

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:09.350 
following my compass from where I

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:11.800 
following my compass from where I
tracked<00:06:09.710> before<00:06:09.890> and<00:06:10.460> it<00:06:10.970> leads<00:06:11.240> right<00:06:11.420> to<00:06:11.630> a

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:11.810 
tracked before and it leads right to a

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:13.840 
tracked before and it leads right to a
suspicious<00:06:12.290> crafting<00:06:13.040> table<00:06:13.460> and<00:06:13.610> you<00:06:13.700> can

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:13.850 
suspicious crafting table and you can

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:16.420 
suspicious crafting table and you can
see<00:06:14.120> they<00:06:14.300> are<00:06:14.330> digging<00:06:14.750> down<00:06:15.110> right<00:06:15.680> there<00:06:16.010> so

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:16.430 
see they are digging down right there so

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:19.030 
see they are digging down right there so
I<00:06:16.460> pearl<00:06:16.880> down<00:06:17.180> immediately<00:06:17.690> and<00:06:18.200> I<00:06:18.530> get<00:06:18.890> to

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:19.040 
I pearl down immediately and I get to
