he won the tournament so couldn't happen
to<00:03:42.769> a<00:03:42.890> nicer<00:03:42.980> guy<00:03:43.340> though

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.100 

well<00:03:55.540> Lake<00:03:55.900> Lewisville<00:03:56.260> is<00:03:56.680> a<00:03:56.709> watershed<00:03:57.190> for

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
well Lake Lewisville is a watershed for

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:02.190 
well Lake Lewisville is a watershed for
the<00:03:59.110> Dallas<00:03:59.530> area<00:03:59.819> and<00:04:00.819> the<00:04:01.420> water<00:04:01.780> does<00:04:02.170> not

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
the Dallas area and the water does not

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.360 
the Dallas area and the water does not
fluctuate<00:04:02.830> very<00:04:03.550> much<00:04:03.880> there<00:04:04.239> at<00:04:04.420> all<00:04:05.370> the

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
fluctuate very much there at all the

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.990 
fluctuate very much there at all the
Arkansas<00:04:06.940> River<00:04:07.330> though<00:04:07.780> however<00:04:08.290> it<00:04:08.620> is<00:04:08.830> a

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
Arkansas River though however it is a

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.800 
Arkansas River though however it is a
navigational<00:04:11.610> body<00:04:12.610> of<00:04:12.819> water<00:04:13.150> and<00:04:13.510> so<00:04:13.690> the

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
navigational body of water and so the

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.960 
navigational body of water and so the
water<00:04:14.050> does<00:04:14.410> fluctuate<00:04:14.800> there<00:04:15.459> quite<00:04:15.819> a<00:04:15.850> bit

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
water does fluctuate there quite a bit

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.050 
water does fluctuate there quite a bit
it<00:04:16.840> also<00:04:17.109> fluctuates<00:04:18.010> when<00:04:18.340> they<00:04:18.489> open<00:04:18.880> and

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
it also fluctuates when they open and

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.210 
it also fluctuates when they open and
close<00:04:19.150> the<00:04:19.630> lock<00:04:19.840> so<00:04:20.260> you<00:04:20.320> do<00:04:20.590> have<00:04:20.799> a<00:04:20.859> lot<00:04:21.160> of

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
close the lock so you do have a lot of

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.270 
close the lock so you do have a lot of
current<00:04:21.760> in<00:04:21.910> different<00:04:22.480> areas<00:04:22.900> the<00:04:23.710> problem

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
current in different areas the problem

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.770 
current in different areas the problem
that<00:04:24.310> i<00:04:24.490> found<00:04:24.970> is<00:04:25.330> a<00:04:25.389> lot<00:04:25.810> of<00:04:25.990> the<00:04:26.110> fish<00:04:27.720> that<00:04:28.720> i

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
that i found is a lot of the fish that i

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.379 
that i found is a lot of the fish that i
found<00:04:29.169> it<00:04:29.440> was<00:04:29.590> taking<00:04:30.070> a<00:04:30.190> long<00:04:30.220> time<00:04:30.880> to<00:04:30.940> get

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:31.389 
found it was taking a long time to get

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:33.900 
found it was taking a long time to get
you<00:04:31.720> know<00:04:31.840> five<00:04:32.320> quality<00:04:33.040> bites<00:04:33.280> and<00:04:33.580> i<00:04:33.669> knew

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
you know five quality bites and i knew

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:37.790 
you know five quality bites and i knew
that<00:04:33.940> by<00:04:34.540> the<00:04:34.600> time<00:04:34.900> i<00:04:34.960> ran<00:04:35.500> 45<00:04:36.070> minutes<00:04:36.729> north

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
that by the time i ran 45 minutes north

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.400 
that by the time i ran 45 minutes north
locked<00:04:38.800> for<00:04:39.310> 45<00:04:39.850> minutes<00:04:40.210> and<00:04:40.690> then<00:04:41.229> i'd<00:04:41.380> have

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 
locked for 45 minutes and then i'd have

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.680 
locked for 45 minutes and then i'd have
to<00:04:41.590> do<00:04:41.830> the<00:04:41.979> same<00:04:42.220> thing<00:04:42.580> coming<00:04:43.060> back<00:04:43.270> i<00:04:43.510> would

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
to do the same thing coming back i would

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.659 
to do the same thing coming back i would
be<00:04:43.810> losing<00:04:44.380> three<00:04:44.770> and<00:04:44.800> a<00:04:44.950> half<00:04:44.979> to<00:04:45.370> at<00:04:45.490> least

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:45.669 
be losing three and a half to at least

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:47.760 
be losing three and a half to at least
four<00:04:46.090> and<00:04:46.210> a<00:04:46.240> half<00:04:46.300> hours<00:04:46.780> worth<00:04:47.050> of<00:04:47.229> fish<00:04:47.470> time

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
four and a half hours worth of fish time

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.830 
four and a half hours worth of fish time
and<00:04:48.040> so<00:04:48.580> I<00:04:48.610> knew<00:04:48.940> that<00:04:48.970> I<00:04:49.210> had<00:04:49.479> to<00:04:49.510> find

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
and so I knew that I had to find

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.570 
and so I knew that I had to find
something<00:04:50.260> different<00:04:53.010> so<00:04:54.010> that<00:04:54.220> I<00:04:54.250> could<00:04:54.310> have

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
something different so that I could have

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.520 
something different so that I could have
a<00:04:54.610> successful<00:04:55.060> in<00:04:55.600> strong<00:04:55.900> finish<00:04:56.350> in<00:04:56.500> the

finished 10th but I do believe that that
was<00:06:13.710> the<00:06:13.830> right<00:06:13.860> decision<00:06:14.010> for<00:06:14.460> me<00:06:14.729> they're

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:15.270 
was the right decision for me they're

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:18.720 
fun they get a little squirrely when you

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:22.730 
fun they get a little squirrely when you
when<00:06:19.050> you<00:06:19.080> get<00:06:19.470> a<00:06:19.530> lot<00:06:20.490> of<00:06:21.050> water<00:06:22.050> in<00:06:22.229> the<00:06:22.500> live

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:22.740

when you get a lot of water in the live
well<00:06:23.100> and<00:06:23.370> redistribute<00:06:24.150> all<00:06:24.300> the<00:06:24.479> way<00:06:24.690> it's<00:06:25.560> a

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:25.650 
well and redistribute all the way it's a

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:27.379 
well and redistribute all the way it's a
little<00:06:25.800> interesting<00:06:26.280> because<00:06:27.000> you<00:06:27.210> do<00:06:27.360> have

00:06:27.379 --> 00:06:27.389 
little interesting because you do have

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:29.450

to<00:06:27.720> think<00:06:27.930> about<00:06:28.080> it<00:06:28.260> not<00:06:28.919> like<00:06:29.070> you<00:06:29.250> can<00:06:29.400> just

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:29.460 
to think about it not like you can just

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:31.790
