guitarists<00:00:23.320> but<00:00:24.029> if<00:00:25.029> we<00:00:25.150> did<00:00:25.390> look<00:00:25.599> at<00:00:25.720> the

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:25.840 
guitarists but if we did look at the

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.029 
guitarists but if we did look at the
notes<00:00:26.050> we<00:00:26.380> have<00:00:26.410> E<00:00:26.970> F<00:00:27.970> F<00:00:28.599> sharp<00:00:28.980> whole<00:00:29.980> step

if<00:00:51.160> you<00:00:51.640> want<00:00:51.970> to<00:00:52.060> make<00:00:52.240> a<00:00:52.540> basic<00:00:53.470> major<00:00:53.980> chord

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:54.490 
if you want to make a basic major chord

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.260 
if you want to make a basic major chord
it's<00:00:55.120> built<00:00:55.450> on<00:00:55.600> three<00:00:56.020> of<00:00:56.050> those<00:00:56.320> notes<00:00:56.650> and

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
it's built on three of those notes and

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.060 
it's built on three of those notes and
those<00:00:58.270> three<00:00:58.600> notes<00:00:58.840> called<00:00:59.200> a<00:00:59.290> triad<00:00:59.740> because

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
those three notes called a triad because

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.040 
those three notes called a triad because
they're<00:01:00.250> three<00:01:00.520> notes<00:01:00.760> is<00:01:01.150> basically<00:01:01.810> the

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.050 
they're three notes is basically the

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.850 
they're three notes is basically the
first<00:01:02.320> third<00:01:03.250> and<00:01:03.520> fifth<00:01:03.640> note<00:01:04.240> of<00:01:04.270> the<00:01:04.510> scale

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
first third and fifth note of the scale

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.160 
first third and fifth note of the scale
now<00:01:05.860> if<00:01:06.190> you're<00:01:06.490> playing<00:01:06.760> a<00:01:07.000> C<00:01:07.360> for<00:01:07.390> instance

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
now if you're playing a C for instance

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.880 
now if you're playing a C for instance
C<00:01:08.620> chord

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.139 

within<00:01:13.890> this<00:01:14.070> this<00:01:14.399> should<00:01:14.549> be<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.850> first

00:01:15.139 --> 00:01:15.149 
within this this should be the first

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:17.960 
within this this should be the first
third<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:15.750> fifth<00:01:15.840> so<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.560> first<00:01:16.829> or<00:01:17.610> route

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
third and fifth so the first or route

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.480 
third and fifth so the first or route
also<00:01:18.600> called<00:01:19.079> a<00:01:19.140> route<00:01:19.320> is<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:20.750> ca1<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:22.430> if<00:01:23.430> you

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
also called a route is a ca1 and if you

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.899 
also called a route is a ca1 and if you
go<00:01:23.610> up<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.850> scale<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.360> three<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:25.079> third

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
go up the scale to three the third

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:30.880 
go up the scale to three the third
that's<00:01:26.909> an<00:01:27.149> E<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:28.399> if<00:01:29.399> you<00:01:29.520> go<00:01:29.670> up<00:01:29.789> one<00:01:30.000> more

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
that's an E and if you go up one more

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.999 
that's an E and if you go up one more
it's<00:01:31.890> a<00:01:32.039> G<00:01:33.080> now<00:01:34.080> I<00:01:34.110> should<00:01:34.380> mention<00:01:34.560> another

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
it's a G now I should mention another

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.230 
it's a G now I should mention another
use<00:01:35.340> for<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.820> seventh<00:01:36.659> chord<00:01:37.970> there<00:01:38.970> are<00:01:39.090> many

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
use for the seventh chord there are many

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.010 
use for the seventh chord there are many
uses<00:01:39.479> for<00:01:39.869> it<00:01:39.990> but<00:01:40.200> if<00:01:40.470> you're<00:01:41.030> on<00:01:42.030> a<00:01:42.090> one<00:01:42.630> chord

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
uses for it but if you're on a one chord

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.090 
uses for it but if you're on a one chord
let's<00:01:43.439> say<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.619> d

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.550 

you<00:01:46.700> can<00:01:46.880> still<00:01:47.180> use<00:01:47.510> the<00:01:47.750> seventh<00:01:48.140> to<00:01:48.350> go<00:01:48.500> to

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
you can still use the seventh to go to

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.550 
you can still use the seventh to go to
the<00:01:49.070> chord<00:01:49.340> four<00:01:49.729> steps<00:01:50.659> away<00:01:50.869> from<00:01:51.020> it<00:01:51.350> but

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
the chord four steps away from it but

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.590 
the chord four steps away from it but
now<00:01:51.740> instead<00:01:51.920> of<00:01:52.189> it<00:01:52.280> being<00:01:52.310> a<00:01:52.640> five<00:01:52.939> to<00:01:53.270> a<00:01:53.299> one

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
now instead of it being a five to a one

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.930 
now instead of it being a five to a one
you<00:01:54.259> can<00:01:54.470> go<00:01:54.590> from<00:01:54.770> a<00:01:54.890> 1<00:01:55.159> to<00:01:55.909> a<00:01:55.940> 1<00:01:56.030> 7<00:01:57.549> to<00:01:58.549> a<00:01:58.580> 4

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
you can go from a 1 to a 1 7 to a 4

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.139 
you can go from a 1 to a 1 7 to a 4
chord<00:01:59.440> it<00:02:00.440> still<00:02:00.740> leads<00:02:00.950> your<00:02:01.100> ear<00:02:01.310> 4<00:02:01.790> chords

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:02.149 
chord it still leads your ear 4 chords

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:09.309 
chord it still leads your ear 4 chords
away<00:02:06.280> but<00:02:07.280> now<00:02:07.549> it's<00:02:07.820> the<00:02:08.450> function<00:02:09.140> within

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
away but now it's the function within

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:10.990 
away but now it's the function within
the<00:02:09.800> key<00:02:10.009> is<00:02:10.160> different<00:02:10.520> because<00:02:10.640> let's<00:02:10.940> say

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
the key is different because let's say

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.559 
the key is different because let's say
you're<00:02:11.180> playing<00:02:11.300> a<00:02:11.510> song<00:02:11.720> in<00:02:11.930> the<00:02:12.020> key<00:02:12.140> of<00:02:12.170> D

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
you're playing a song in the key of D

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.870 
you're playing a song in the key of D
you<00:02:14.569> go<00:02:14.690> to<00:02:14.750> a<00:02:14.840> D<00:02:15.110> 7th<00:02:15.620> now<00:02:15.860> and<00:02:16.190> you<00:02:16.459> can<00:02:16.640> hear

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
you go to a D 7th now and you can hear

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.550 
you go to a D 7th now and you can hear
that<00:02:17.030> you<00:02:17.180> want<00:02:17.390> to<00:02:17.450> go<00:02:17.569> somewhere<00:02:17.840> else<00:02:18.110> and
