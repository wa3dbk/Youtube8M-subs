00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:07.820
 Yes it is that everyone I this is my everyone like good 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:10.360
 I think that the product to introduce is already visible 

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:15.039
 This is this this 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:19.330
 Kedomo which it is says something and is what like a yo and ogc 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:20.619
 It is odc of every chance of market edition ot 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.840
 It is called special zone 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:27.380
 Well Kedomo is what I audio de In a nutshell 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:30.470
 iphone ipod touch ipod touch or its ipod series 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:34.010
 Let me make it here, and the basic amount 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.970
 It becomes a speaker that can hear Natsukamoto 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:42.180
 This is 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:45.680
 Many things I first one First is you and really it is also little by little the great thing is to support the 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:49.220
 I say that by amplifier 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:54.260
 Do you why not me two of Tteyuu by Yes in the 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:55.430
 There are two amps and I wonder why there are two for that low temperature 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:01.190
 Amplifier 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:05.700
 After Well I'm It has withered ones say amplifiers for the mid-high range the game only 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:10.680
 Is that the issue is amplified by only do hard in hardness in me was is amplified by K 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:15.509
 Fine qualifying by being able to put that sound and to You're very cost without its head 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.510
 Other expensive products such as monitor speakers are often bi-amp products 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:21.120
 Ne 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:27.190
 But it first one is is another is in the Da-um 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:30.610
 I 'm currently connected and listening now I can do the main thing with this drape 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:34.420
 Another one is not sound quality 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:37.660
 Well you might think that everyone is good, but I am a little more corn or bass 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:42.200
 For those who want to emphasize the bass a little more 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:43.810
 There is an application for wireless It is when using this application 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:50.079
 The Horyu volume person holds 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:54.189
 It is easy in you can adjust it is the 3 balls to adjust Datte does that turn a used 

00:01:50.079 --> 00:02:00.549
 Person is a little more bass I'd say if you choose to say Toka I think that it is not solved even heavy 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:02:02.710
 Some low and high frequencies are also available in the form that you want to adjust the treble separately. 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:03.830
 Then you are not enough for me at all 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:09.319
 Custom 29 is 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:14.450
 I don't know if I can see it, but I can draw this line 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:16.760
 If you want to raise only the bass, it is not common to look like this Custom curves 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:22.130
 I 'm going to be able to make it more myself 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:26.050
 I feel like my own You can adjust finely 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:29.590
 Other It Is This It is only the audio cattle 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:33.820
 Because there is an input terminal for that external new floor Miyaji 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:38.600
 For example, what is a PC, of â€‹â€‹course other ipods 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:40.060
 Also it can also be issued from does not matter which of the gift box in the audio player 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:44.050
 After all 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.560
 Well you have it is connected iphone usb cable Gatsui because this 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:49.450
 Is it 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.790
 You can connect to a PC or map, and you can synchronize. 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:55.709
 Hmmm 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:03:00.060
 Comes with a handy remote control when using away it is you are after 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:02.150
 It is a little parenthesis good feeling Kakoii Merori also goods 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.390
 Even though it is defeated Tan 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:12.379
 I do not know that the bi-amp works but 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:17.930
 The proposal is regular It sounds its bass and its separation feeling of middle and high sound is very loud It raised its volume 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:20.700
 The above advantage of not moko Moso is is bass is we are up to the feel good I is I when 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:24.930
 It seems that everyone is also 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:29.910
 There is no bass and the head of the knowledge, but it sounds clear even if it is an arson or above 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:34.410
 It is Nomo say difficult man Toka so you can pick up very clear so the volume 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:39.319
 When you raise it, that summer festival is nice-its bass is a little 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:39.319
 Is not there are things Tteyuu failure to come point 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:45.880
 Somehow 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:50.980
 Even if you raise the volume considerably in Tokyo, you can ask without much failure 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:54.790
 Isnt this masu speaker It Is After in there is jelly or discard what is not attached to the side 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:58.210
 You may think that I do not have a problem so far when I am in front of that 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:00.680
 Its also the can you Ya also be decent to hear at the inn 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:05.810
 Somewhat far away from me and my pet 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:11.430
 4 Even if I slept on the sofa, I could spread the sound throughout the room 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:13.459
 The position of the speaker is Henteko, but I thought that the spread was quite good 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.790
 There is a lot of this 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:20.440
 Language 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.989
 It is quite expensive, but it is the price, so I think that there are quite a lot of things that can be obtained by paying 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.009
 so 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:28.190
 Please check it by all means I want this 

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:32.930
 And honestly what is this 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:38.440
 The speaker which protected the speaker so that it can be right and left and the monitor speaker 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:43.810
 Eating can the spot and angle adjustment put here to adjust yourself 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:45.220
 It's a person who wants to be the sound of 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:49.240
 Even though I did not 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:51.370
 Standing in this government will be quite want 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.300
 Afternoon time 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:56.270
 The 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:59.540
 The was also the time of Takahashi phone was the 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:01.750
 You can hear it from here, so let's try a little 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.750
 Positive 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:09.050
 So you're going to do so from the water 's god of paradise audio source bluetooth 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:15.790
 A screen for selecting this speaker will pop up 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:18.500
 There is asked to say that yes was described Takahashi Fanny's wildebeest 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:22.760
 I was up during the fortune 2 lost 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:23.810
 I wonder if me coming in but I want to say I think this kind of feeling that 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:28.250

 Such I feel that speakerphone hands-free of forearm and this say 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:42.349
 You can also use a speaker 

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:45.830
