00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
going back and forth between bronzong

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.760 
going back and forth between bronzong
and<00:00:40.620> settlements<00:00:41.600> be<00:00:42.600> cutting<00:00:43.260> his<00:00:43.410> attack

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
and settlements be cutting his attack

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.830 
and settlements be cutting his attack
and<00:00:44.100> if<00:00:44.700> he<00:00:45.090> decides<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:46.160> attack<00:00:47.539> I'll<00:00:48.539> just

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
and if he decides to attack I'll just

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.959 
and if he decides to attack I'll just
gyroball<00:00:49.200> him<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:49.950> with<00:00:50.190> so<00:00:50.219> many<00:00:50.520> speed

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
gyroball him and with so many speed

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.959 
gyroball him and with so many speed
boosts<00:00:51.390> ah<00:00:51.829> Jar<00:00:52.829> wall<00:00:53.070> do<00:00:53.250> a<00:00:53.280> lot<00:00:53.550> even<00:00:53.820> though

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
boosts ah Jar wall do a lot even though

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.459 
boosts ah Jar wall do a lot even though
it's<00:00:54.149> not<00:00:54.329> very<00:00:54.480> effective<00:00:54.719> so<00:00:55.170> he<00:00:55.289> finally

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
it's not very effective so he finally

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.310 
it's not very effective so he finally
attacks<00:00:55.980> me<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:56.579> I<00:00:57.329> don't<00:00:57.840> know<00:00:57.989> if<00:00:58.109> he<00:00:58.230> has

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
attacks me and I don't know if he has

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.250 
attacks me and I don't know if he has
ice<00:00:58.559> thing<00:00:58.890> so<00:00:59.129> I<00:00:59.190> go<00:00:59.370> back<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.609> bronzong<00:01:00.260> and

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
ice thing so I go back to bronzong and

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.529 
ice thing so I go back to bronzong and
he<00:01:01.680> does<00:01:01.949> waterfall<00:01:02.670> again<00:01:02.730> so<00:01:03.180> he<00:01:03.300> probably

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
he does waterfall again so he probably

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.300 
he does waterfall again so he probably
doesn't<00:01:03.989> have<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:05.210> he<00:01:06.210> withdraws<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:07.310> I

mattered<00:03:24.140> cuz<00:03:24.530> infer<00:03:24.920> name<00:03:25.070> is<00:03:25.220> obviously

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
mattered cuz infer name is obviously

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.420 
mattered cuz infer name is obviously
faster<00:03:26.239> and<00:03:26.420> if<00:03:27.110> a<00:03:27.230> Crip<00:03:27.500> took<00:03:27.709> it<00:03:27.860> out<00:03:28.040> then

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
faster and if a Crip took it out then

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.009 
faster and if a Crip took it out then
the<00:03:28.580> next<00:03:28.730> one<00:03:29.000> was<00:03:29.330> gonna<00:03:29.480> take<00:03:29.750> it<00:03:29.900> out

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
the next one was gonna take it out

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:34.060 
the next one was gonna take it out
anyways<00:03:30.880> so<00:03:31.880> he<00:03:32.330> brings<00:03:32.510> him<00:03:32.720> back<00:03:32.750> yanmega<00:03:33.470> I
