00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
for a long time and I've had a tool on

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.470 
for a long time and I've had a tool on
my<00:00:16.529> workbench<00:00:16.800> that<00:00:17.430> I've<00:00:17.550> relied<00:00:17.970> on<00:00:18.000> for<00:00:18.449> a

long time and I found out today that a
modification<00:00:23.369> has<00:00:23.789> been<00:00:23.910> made<00:00:24.060> to<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.269> tool

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
modification has been made to the tool

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.810 
modification has been made to the tool
and<00:00:24.869> I'll<00:00:25.380> show<00:00:25.650> you<00:00:25.680> where<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.160> mistake<00:00:26.550> came

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
and it's cost me to have to change a lot

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.710 
and it's cost me to have to change a lot
of<00:00:29.099> a<00:00:29.310> lot<00:00:29.820> of<00:00:29.849> couplers<00:00:30.269> on<00:00:30.390> a<00:00:30.420> lot<00:00:30.599> of

quit<00:00:40.910> ok<00:00:41.910> guys<00:00:42.149> what<00:00:42.420> we<00:00:42.540> have<00:00:42.719> here<00:00:43.020> is<00:00:43.170> the

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
quit ok guys what we have here is the

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.130 
quit ok guys what we have here is the
tools<00:00:43.559> that<00:00:43.680> Gavin<00:00:44.129> mentioned<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:44.960> this<00:00:45.960> is

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
tools that Gavin mentioned and this is

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.260 
tools that Gavin mentioned and this is
as<00:00:46.410> one<00:00:46.770> comes<00:00:47.039> from<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.250> factory<00:00:47.789> and<00:00:47.879> if<00:00:48.180> I

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
as one comes from the factory and if I

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.000 
as one comes from the factory and if I
tilt<00:00:48.600> it<00:00:48.750> up<00:00:48.840> like<00:00:49.020> this<00:00:49.200> you<00:00:49.410> can<00:00:49.559> see<00:00:49.770> that

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
tilt it up like this you can see that

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.939 
tilt it up like this you can see that
the<00:00:50.250> coupler<00:00:51.120> is<00:00:51.680> mounted<00:00:52.680> in<00:00:52.770> there

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
the coupler is mounted in there

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.220 
the coupler is mounted in there
relatively<00:00:53.550> flat<00:00:53.789> or<00:00:54.090> perfectly<00:00:54.719> flat<00:00:54.930> with

relatively flat or perfectly flat with
the<00:00:55.350> top<00:00:55.530> of<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.770> tool<00:00:56.399> itself<00:00:57.800> unfortunately

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
the top of the tool itself unfortunately

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.310 
the top of the tool itself unfortunately
this<00:00:59.670> is<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.239> tool<00:01:00.420> that<00:01:00.480> I've<00:01:00.780> been<00:01:00.809> using<00:01:00.960> to

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
this is the tool that I've been using to

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.399 
this is the tool that I've been using to
adjust<00:01:01.710> all<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.039> couplers<00:01:02.870> for<00:01:03.870> our<00:01:03.989> our

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
adjust all the couplers for our our

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.510 
adjust all the couplers for our our
stuff<00:01:04.890> that's<00:01:05.489> been<00:01:05.670> on<00:01:05.760> my<00:01:05.790> workbench<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:07.520> I

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
stuff that's been on my workbench and I

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.640 
stuff that's been on my workbench and I
never<00:01:08.760> realized<00:01:09.330> it<00:01:09.540> before<00:01:09.600> but<00:01:10.170> somebody

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
never realized it before but somebody

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.630 
never realized it before but somebody
had<00:01:11.100> changed<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:12.260> coupler<00:01:13.260> in<00:01:13.439> it<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:13.860> ten

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
had changed the coupler in it to a ten

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.670 
had changed the coupler in it to a ten
fifteen<00:01:15.150> I<00:01:15.450> don't<00:01:15.960> know<00:01:16.049> what<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.380> coupler

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
fifteen I don't know what the coupler

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.310 
fifteen I don't know what the coupler
that<00:01:16.830> comes<00:01:17.040> with<00:01:17.250> it<00:01:17.400> is<00:01:17.580> but<00:01:18.479> this<00:01:18.630> 10<00:01:18.900> 15

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
that comes with it is but this 10 15

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.899 
that comes with it is but this 10 15
meted<00:01:19.619> on<00:01:19.710> here<00:01:19.979> if<00:01:20.100> I<00:01:20.220> hold<00:01:20.430> this<00:01:20.610> back<00:01:20.880> a

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
meted on here if I hold this back a

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.730 
meted on here if I hold this back a
little<00:01:21.090> bit<00:01:21.479> you<00:01:21.810> can<00:01:21.990> see<00:01:22.259> that<00:01:22.590> it's

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
little bit you can see that it's

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.120 
little bit you can see that it's
substantially<00:01:23.689> the<00:01:24.689> box<00:01:24.930> is<00:01:25.170> substantially

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
substantially the box is substantially

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.880 
substantially the box is substantially
higher<00:01:26.400> than<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:27.229> actual<00:01:29.329> original<00:01:30.329> one<00:01:30.509> and

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
higher than the actual original one and

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.910 
higher than the actual original one and
let<00:01:31.890> me<00:01:31.979> show<00:01:32.159> you<00:01:32.250> what<00:01:32.490> that<00:01:32.640> leads<00:01:32.939> to<00:01:33.240> here

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
let me show you what that leads to here

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.980 
let me show you what that leads to here
okay<00:01:34.920> guys<00:01:35.130> as<00:01:35.430> you<00:01:35.670> can<00:01:35.880> see<00:01:36.090> here<00:01:36.420> the

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
okay guys as you can see here the

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.749 
okay guys as you can see here the
defective<00:01:37.500> one<00:01:37.740> are<00:01:37.890> not<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.159> defective<00:01:38.579> one

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
defective one are not the defective one

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.280 
defective one are not the defective one
but<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.000> one<00:01:39.119> that<00:01:39.270> had<00:01:39.450> been<00:01:39.479> modified<00:01:39.840> with

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
but the one that had been modified with

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.350 
but the one that had been modified with
a<00:01:40.320> ten<00:01:40.560> fifteen<00:01:40.979> coupler<00:01:41.340> on<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.549> right<00:01:42.119> hand

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
a ten fifteen coupler on the right hand

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.410 
a ten fifteen coupler on the right hand
side<00:01:42.630> is<00:01:43.159> about<00:01:44.159> half<00:01:44.520> a<00:01:44.640> coupler<00:01:45.060> with

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
side is about half a coupler with

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.260 
side is about half a coupler with
too-tall<00:01:46.189> than<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.310> original<00:01:47.880> one<00:01:48.030> on<00:01:48.060> the

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
too-tall than the original one on the

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.830 
too-tall than the original one on the
left<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:49.320> one<00:01:49.829> that's<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.310> correct<00:01:50.909> coupler

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
left the one that's the correct coupler

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.950 
left the one that's the correct coupler
in<00:01:51.990> there<00:01:52.170> I<00:01:52.380> never<00:01:53.040> knew<00:01:53.490> this<00:01:53.759> and<00:01:54.060> I've

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
in there I never knew this and I've

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.709 
in there I never knew this and I've
adjusted<00:01:55.170> a<00:01:55.710> myriad<00:01:56.369> of<00:01:56.520> cars<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:57.509> the

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
adjusted a myriad of cars to the

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.459 
adjusted a myriad of cars to the
incorrect<00:01:58.530> gauge<00:01:59.130> on<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.579> right<00:01:59.880> hand<00:02:00.119> side

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:00.469 
incorrect gauge on the right hand side

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:02.810 
incorrect gauge on the right hand side
which<00:02:01.469> has<00:02:01.649> caused<00:02:01.890> us<00:02:02.159> a<00:02:02.219> pretty<00:02:02.700> good

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
which has caused us a pretty good

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.389 
which has caused us a pretty good
problem<00:02:03.299> I<00:02:03.799> Gavin<00:02:04.799> had<00:02:04.950> a<00:02:04.979> couple<00:02:05.250> of

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
problem I Gavin had a couple of

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.069 
problem I Gavin had a couple of
locomotives<00:02:05.969> today<00:02:06.210> that<00:02:06.390> were<00:02:06.479> uncoupling

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
locomotives today that were uncoupling

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.719 
locomotives today that were uncoupling
on<00:02:07.259> my<00:02:07.530> layout<00:02:07.829> and<00:02:07.950> I<00:02:07.979> could<00:02:08.190> not<00:02:08.340> figure<00:02:08.580> out

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
on my layout and I could not figure out

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.240 
on my layout and I could not figure out
why<00:02:09.119> and<00:02:09.479> it<00:02:09.569> was<00:02:09.599> because<00:02:09.860> the<00:02:10.860> gauge<00:02:11.039> on<00:02:11.220> the

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
why and it was because the gauge on the

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.920 
why and it was because the gauge on the
right<00:02:11.520> told<00:02:11.819> me<00:02:11.970> that<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.360> locum

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
right told me that the locum

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.979 
right told me that the locum
took<00:02:13.230> a<00:02:13.760> 2004<00:02:14.760> when<00:02:15.000> in<00:02:15.090> reality<00:02:15.239> it<00:02:15.689> took<00:02:15.840> a

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
took a 2004 when in reality it took a

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:22.309 
took a 2004 when in reality it took a
10-15<00:02:19.370> actually<00:02:20.370> you<00:02:20.459> can<00:02:20.640> see<00:02:20.879> here<00:02:21.299> that<00:02:22.049> the

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
10-15 actually you can see here that the

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.190 
10-15 actually you can see here that the
10:15<00:02:22.980> coupler<00:02:23.480> doesn't<00:02:24.480> even<00:02:24.629> really<00:02:24.959> fit

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
10:15 coupler doesn't even really fit

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:32.149 
10:15 coupler doesn't even really fit
the<00:02:25.670> the<00:02:26.670> cutout<00:02:27.060> in<00:02:27.239> the<00:02:27.659> tool<00:02:27.870> itself<00:02:31.159> so

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:32.159 
the the cutout in the tool itself so

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:34.270 
the the cutout in the tool itself so
anyway<00:02:32.579> using<00:02:33.000> a<00:02:33.239> tool<00:02:33.420> with<00:02:33.629> the<00:02:33.780> incorrect

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
anyway using a tool with the incorrect

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.039 
anyway using a tool with the incorrect
coupler<00:02:35.280> mounted<00:02:35.760> in<00:02:35.849> it<00:02:36.030> it<00:02:36.840> would<00:02:36.959> be

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.049 
coupler mounted in it it would be

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:38.899 
coupler mounted in it it would be
something<00:02:37.260> to<00:02:37.409> check<00:02:37.680> for<00:02:37.889> if<00:02:38.069> you<00:02:38.189> get<00:02:38.370> like<00:02:38.879> I

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:38.909 
something to check for if you get like I

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:41.690 
something to check for if you get like I
did<00:02:39.239> get<00:02:39.870> some<00:02:40.139> equipment<00:02:40.349> that<00:02:40.799> the<00:02:41.519> head

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
did get some equipment that the head

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.479 
did get some equipment that the head
belonged<00:02:42.090> to<00:02:42.299> someone<00:02:42.510> else<00:02:42.750> and<00:02:43.219> you<00:02:44.219> didn't

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
belonged to someone else and you didn't

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:49.729 
belonged to someone else and you didn't
know<00:02:44.639> which<00:02:45.319> that<00:02:46.319> it<00:02:46.409> was<00:02:46.530> incorrect<00:02:47.060> so<00:02:48.739> what

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
know which that it was incorrect so what

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.580 
know which that it was incorrect so what
I<00:02:49.769> would<00:02:49.859> always<00:02:50.099> recommend<00:02:50.370> is<00:02:50.909> if<00:02:51.060> you<00:02:51.180> get<00:02:51.389> a

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
I would always recommend is if you get a

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.190 
I would always recommend is if you get a
used<00:02:52.590> one<00:02:53.430> of<00:02:53.489> these<00:02:53.669> tools<00:02:54.030> that<00:02:54.389> you<00:02:54.959> check

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
used one of these tools that you check

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.920 
used one of these tools that you check
it<00:02:55.379> with<00:02:55.650> a<00:02:55.680> micro<00:02:56.250> trends<00:02:56.639> truck<00:02:56.970> off<00:02:57.569> of<00:02:57.840> a

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
it with a micro trends truck off of a

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.259 
it with a micro trends truck off of a
car<00:02:58.139> or<00:02:58.169> a<00:02:58.409> micro<00:02:58.709> trains<00:02:58.950> car<00:02:59.280> to<00:03:00.090> make<00:03:00.209> sure

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
car or a micro trains car to make sure

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:03.909 
car or a micro trains car to make sure
that<00:03:00.780> the<00:03:01.159> the<00:03:02.159> height<00:03:02.340> of<00:03:02.579> the<00:03:02.700> gauge<00:03:02.939> is<00:03:03.389> is

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:03.919 
that the the height of the gauge is is

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:06.110 
that the the height of the gauge is is
proper<00:03:04.919> or<00:03:05.129> make<00:03:05.370> sure<00:03:05.400> it<00:03:05.730> has<00:03:05.879> the<00:03:05.909> proper

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
proper or make sure it has the proper

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.089 
proper or make sure it has the proper
coupler<00:03:06.870> in<00:03:07.049> the<00:03:07.200> pocket<00:03:07.620> and<00:03:07.709> like<00:03:07.829> I<00:03:07.919> say<00:03:08.069> I

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099 
coupler in the pocket and like I say I

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:09.470 
coupler in the pocket and like I say I
don't<00:03:08.219> know<00:03:08.310> what<00:03:08.489> the<00:03:08.579> original<00:03:09.000> original

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
don't know what the original original

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.690 
don't know what the original original
coupler<00:03:10.019> is<00:03:10.260> but<00:03:10.620> I'm<00:03:11.159> sure<00:03:11.219> you<00:03:11.459> can<00:03:11.579> figure

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
coupler is but I'm sure you can figure

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:19.930 
coupler is but I'm sure you can figure
it<00:03:11.819> out<00:03:12.000> figure<00:03:12.209> it<00:03:12.510> out

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.000 

as<00:03:20.940> you<00:03:21.210> can<00:03:21.360> see<00:03:21.630> this<00:03:21.900> is<00:03:22.110> caused<00:03:22.410> a<00:03:22.590> lot<00:03:22.920> of

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
as you can see this is caused a lot of

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.750 
as you can see this is caused a lot of
aggravation<00:03:23.520> order<00:03:23.940> and<00:03:24.180> sell<00:03:24.390> equipment

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
aggravation order and sell equipment

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.400 
aggravation order and sell equipment
this<00:03:26.760> made<00:03:27.120> us<00:03:27.270> have<00:03:27.450> to<00:03:27.630> go<00:03:27.780> back<00:03:27.960> and<00:03:28.200> check

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
this made us have to go back and check

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.160 
this made us have to go back and check
all<00:03:28.590> of<00:03:28.620> our<00:03:28.830> n<00:03:29.040> skill<00:03:29.340> equipment<00:03:29.960> this<00:03:30.960> is
