00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.910 
now this has to be on the hop on medium
to<00:02:03.400> low<00:02:03.610> heat<00:02:04.000> for<00:02:04.210> about<00:02:04.930> an<00:02:05.140> hour<00:02:05.200> and<00:02:05.860> then

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
to low heat for about an hour and then

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.010 
to low heat for about an hour and then
we'll<00:02:06.580> add<00:02:06.850> the<00:02:06.910> sugar<00:02:07.510> in

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.770

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
so this rice puddings had an hour now so

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.220 
so this rice puddings had an hour now so
yes<00:02:15.140> turned<00:02:15.620> to<00:02:16.280> this<00:02:16.580> consistency<00:02:17.360> it's

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230

yes turned to this consistency it's
cooked<00:02:18.650> down<00:02:18.770> but<00:02:19.430> when<00:02:19.610> you<00:02:19.730> taste<00:02:20.030> it<00:02:20.270> you
