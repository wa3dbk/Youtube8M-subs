00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.439 
zipper makes it almost to the foot box
this<00:00:55.590> improves<00:00:56.100> thermal<00:00:56.399> efficiency<00:00:57.149> but<00:00:57.270> not

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
this improves thermal efficiency but not

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.930 
this improves thermal efficiency but not
by<00:00:57.570> not<00:00:57.840> having<00:00:58.379> any<00:00:58.890> point<00:00:59.399> at<00:00:59.520> which<00:00:59.609> cold

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
weight savings as well is it two two-way

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.500 
weight savings as well is it two two-way
zipper<00:01:04.979> so<00:01:05.820> it<00:01:05.909> does<00:01:06.090> give<00:01:06.270> you<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.420> ability
