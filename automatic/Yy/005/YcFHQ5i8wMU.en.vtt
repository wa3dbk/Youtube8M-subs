00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:27.370 

I've<00:01:17.830> been<00:01:18.010> watching<00:01:18.610> you<00:01:18.820> for<00:01:19.180> a<00:01:19.210> while<00:01:19.270> now

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.460 

now<00:01:27.950> don't<00:01:28.280> let<00:01:28.430> anyone<00:01:28.790> tell<00:01:29.270> you<00:01:29.320> that<00:01:30.320> you

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.169 

second<00:01:34.740> chances<00:01:35.369> don't<00:01:35.640> come<00:01:35.939> around

second chances don't come around

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:40.279 
second chances don't come around
although<00:01:36.630> often<00:01:37.350> I<00:01:37.729> suggest<00:01:38.729> a<00:01:39.030> really<00:01:39.929> close

00:01:40.279 --> 00:01:40.289 
although often I suggest a really close

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:47.030 
although often I suggest a really close
look<00:01:40.500> at

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:02:07.839 

this<00:01:47.550> is<00:01:47.760> your<00:01:47.970> chance

00:02:07.839 --> 00:02:07.849 

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:52.280 

it's<00:02:08.849> about<00:02:09.179> saving<00:02:09.569> dears

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.540 

now<00:02:53.290> I<00:02:53.320> have<00:02:53.590> a<00:02:53.620> small<00:02:53.770> perception<00:02:54.310> of<00:02:54.400> what

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
now I have a small perception of what

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:55.710 
now I have a small perception of what
the<00:02:54.670> movies<00:02:54.910> about<00:02:54.940> the<00:02:55.450> teaser<00:02:55.690> trailer

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
the movies about the teaser trailer

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.140 
the movies about the teaser trailer
didn't<00:02:56.170> show<00:02:56.440> much<00:02:56.950> which<00:02:57.280> is<00:02:57.310> obviously<00:02:57.850> a

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
didn't show much which is obviously a

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.620 
didn't show much which is obviously a
good<00:02:58.330> job<00:02:58.690> for<00:02:58.810> a<00:02:58.900> teaser<00:02:59.140> trailer<00:02:59.290> um<00:03:00.630> it's

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
good job for a teaser trailer um it's

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.300 
good job for a teaser trailer um it's
quite<00:03:01.750> funny<00:03:02.080> him<00:03:02.380> just<00:03:02.620> shrinking<00:03:03.010> down<00:03:03.130> to

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
quite funny him just shrinking down to

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.190 
quite funny him just shrinking down to
size<00:03:03.520> rather<00:03:03.790> than<00:03:04.090> becoming<00:03:04.420> like<00:03:04.630> I<00:03:04.870> don't

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
size rather than becoming like I don't

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.540 
size rather than becoming like I don't
know<00:03:05.380> like<00:03:05.410> massive<00:03:05.920> like<00:03:06.040> The<00:03:06.160> Hulk<00:03:06.340> or

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
know like massive like The Hulk or

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:07.590 
know like massive like The Hulk or
whatever<00:03:06.790> but<00:03:06.970> I<00:03:07.030> guess<00:03:07.210> he's<00:03:07.360> a<00:03:07.390> different

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
whatever but I guess he's a different

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.260 
whatever but I guess he's a different
type<00:03:07.720> of<00:03:07.990> hero<00:03:08.230> as<00:03:08.530> Hank<00:03:09.250> Pym<00:03:09.550> said<00:03:09.940> in<00:03:10.150> the

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:10.270 
type of hero as Hank Pym said in the

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.090 
type of hero as Hank Pym said in the
trailer<00:03:10.720> he's<00:03:11.020> different<00:03:11.290> and<00:03:11.620> he<00:03:11.800> needs<00:03:11.980> to

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
trailer he's different and he needs to

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.890 
trailer he's different and he needs to
save<00:03:12.280> the<00:03:12.459> world<00:03:12.670> but<00:03:13.209> I<00:03:13.270> just<00:03:13.510> think<00:03:13.690> it's

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
save the world but I just think it's

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.110 
save the world but I just think it's
really<00:03:14.050> funny<00:03:14.440> how<00:03:14.709> it<00:03:14.890> shrinks<00:03:15.280> down<00:03:15.490> and<00:03:15.910> I

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
really funny how it shrinks down and I

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.940 
really funny how it shrinks down and I
don't<00:03:16.390> know<00:03:16.600> how<00:03:16.720> that<00:03:16.900> can<00:03:17.020> be<00:03:17.170> much<00:03:17.290> help<00:03:17.620> but

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
don't know how that can be much help but

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.250 
don't know how that can be much help but
yeah<00:03:18.220> hopefully<00:03:18.820> this<00:03:19.120> movie<00:03:19.450> will<00:03:19.660> be<00:03:19.810> good<00:03:20.020> I

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
yeah hopefully this movie will be good I

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:21.270

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
don't know how to feel about this

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.410 
don't know how to feel about this
trailer<00:03:21.550> because<00:03:21.760> there<00:03:22.060> was<00:03:22.180> a<00:03:22.209> lot<00:03:22.360> of

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
trailer because there was a lot of

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.449 
trailer because there was a lot of
combat<00:03:22.780> and<00:03:22.930> fighting<00:03:23.380> in<00:03:23.680> that<00:03:24.010> trailer
