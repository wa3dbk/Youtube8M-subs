00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
aspects of the game such as the jumping

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.290 
aspects of the game such as the jumping
even<00:03:27.170> the<00:03:28.170> killstreaks<00:03:28.980> the<00:03:29.370> different<00:03:30.060> perks

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
even the killstreaks the different perks

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.470 
even the killstreaks the different perks
all<00:03:30.960> that<00:03:31.260> kind<00:03:31.500> of<00:03:31.560> stuff<00:03:31.620> and<00:03:32.360> teach<00:03:33.360> you

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
guys different ways because it's really

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
you have to hold the jump button to

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.310 
you have to hold the jump button to
actually<00:03:41.370> get<00:03:41.640> up<00:03:41.820> higher<00:03:42.270> and<00:03:42.570> climb<00:03:43.290> up

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320
