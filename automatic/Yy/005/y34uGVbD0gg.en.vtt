root canal and you and your tooth needs

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.100 
root canal and you and your tooth needs
to<00:01:43.470> be<00:01:43.590> extracted<00:01:44.310> then<00:01:45.000> because<00:01:45.689> you<00:01:45.810> don't

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
to be extracted then because you don't

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.200 
to be extracted then because you don't
want<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:46.860> keep<00:01:47.100> a<00:01:47.280> dead<00:01:47.610> tooth<00:01:47.759> in<00:01:47.939> your<00:01:48.030> body

want to keep a dead tooth in your body
there's<00:01:48.420> no<00:01:48.479> other<00:01:49.020> organ<00:01:49.799> in<00:01:49.829> your<00:01:49.890> body<00:01:50.040> that

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
there's no other organ in your body that

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.370 
there's no other organ in your body that
any<00:01:50.670> health<00:01:51.540> professional<00:01:52.079> would<00:01:52.170> ever

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
any health professional would ever

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.730 
any health professional would ever
recommend<00:01:52.920> keeping<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.369> dead<00:01:53.780> dead<00:01:54.780> organ<00:01:55.619> it

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
recommend keeping a dead dead organ it

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.340 
recommend keeping a dead dead organ it
so<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.310> tooth<00:01:56.460> it<00:01:56.610> would<00:01:56.790> be<00:01:56.939> is<00:01:57.299> dead<00:01:57.719> and<00:01:58.020> you

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
so the tooth it would be is dead and you

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.570 
so the tooth it would be is dead and you
know<00:01:58.380> it's<00:01:58.619> left<00:01:58.829> in<00:01:58.950> this<00:01:59.100> way

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
know it's left in this way

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:00.620 
know it's left in this way
potentially<00:02:00.000> causes<00:02:00.330> some<00:02:00.450> of<00:02:00.480> these

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
potentially causes some of these

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.260 
potentially causes some of these
problems<00:02:00.870> so<00:02:01.620> the<00:02:02.100> practical<00:02:02.820> alternative

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
problems so the practical alternative

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.760 
problems so the practical alternative
that<00:02:03.360> is<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:03.630> simply<00:02:03.960> extract<00:02:04.410> it<00:02:04.560> now<00:02:04.650> if<00:02:04.710> you

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
that is to simply extract it now if you

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.250 
that is to simply extract it now if you
extract<00:02:05.130> it<00:02:05.280> you're<00:02:05.430> left<00:02:05.610> with<00:02:05.790> three

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 
extract it you're left with three

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:11.960 
extract it you're left with three
options<00:02:07.260> one<00:02:07.980> is<00:02:08.220> to<00:02:09.030> put<00:02:09.840> a<00:02:10.580> partial<00:02:11.580> in<00:02:11.700> there

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
options one is to put a partial in there

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.700 
options one is to put a partial in there
or<00:02:12.210> a<00:02:12.270> full<00:02:13.110> denture<00:02:13.650> or<00:02:14.360> lower<00:02:15.360> now<00:02:16.080> that<00:02:16.590> is

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
or a full denture or lower now that is

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:17.930 
or a full denture or lower now that is
probably<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.070> least<00:02:17.220> expensive<00:02:17.370> and<00:02:17.820> the

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
probably the least expensive and the

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.910 
probably the least expensive and the
easiest<00:02:18.330> and<00:02:18.570> the<00:02:18.600> simplest<00:02:19.200> to<00:02:19.470> implement

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
easiest and the simplest to implement

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.610 
easiest and the simplest to implement
however<00:02:20.190> it's<00:02:20.430> not<00:02:20.610> that<00:02:20.910> the<00:02:21.900> most

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
however it's not that the most

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.470 
however it's not that the most
convenient<00:02:23.010> because<00:02:23.520> you're<00:02:24.060> left<00:02:24.300> with<00:02:24.450> a

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
convenient because you're left with a

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.300 
convenient because you're left with a
partial<00:02:25.020> either<00:02:25.560> on<00:02:25.680> the<00:02:25.770> upper<00:02:26.070> or<00:02:26.190> the<00:02:26.220> lower

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
partial either on the upper or the lower

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.960 
partial either on the upper or the lower
loop<00:02:26.730> and<00:02:26.910> it<00:02:27.630> can<00:02:27.780> be<00:02:27.950> inconvenient<00:02:28.950> and<00:02:29.820> I

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
loop and it can be inconvenient and I

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.450 
loop and it can be inconvenient and I
actually<00:02:30.120> had<00:02:30.450> a<00:02:30.780> partial<00:02:31.650> for<00:02:32.070> the<00:02:32.160> first

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
actually had a partial for the first

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.820 
actually had a partial for the first
tooth<00:02:32.760> that<00:02:32.940> I<00:02:33.000> had<00:02:33.180> removed<00:02:33.570> but<00:02:34.320> then<00:02:34.590> I

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
tooth that I had removed but then I

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.970 
tooth that I had removed but then I
think<00:02:35.040> the<00:02:35.190> more<00:02:35.840> well<00:02:36.840> the<00:02:37.080> the<00:02:37.500> conventional

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
think the more well the the conventional

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.560 
think the more well the the conventional
approach<00:02:38.250> that<00:02:38.520> you<00:02:38.640> want<00:02:38.820> that<00:02:38.970> Mendez<00:02:39.390> will

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
approach that you want that Mendez will

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.360 
approach that you want that Mendez will
recommend<00:02:39.930> would<00:02:40.050> be<00:02:40.140> like<00:02:40.590> an<00:02:40.770> implant<00:02:41.250> or

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
recommend would be like an implant or

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.520 
recommend would be like an implant or
titanium<00:02:41.790> implant<00:02:42.330> I<00:02:42.510> do<00:02:42.930> not<00:02:43.050> recommend<00:02:43.350> that

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
titanium implant I do not recommend that

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.500 
titanium implant I do not recommend that
because<00:02:43.800> that<00:02:44.190> is<00:02:44.220> a<00:02:44.370> piece<00:02:44.790> of<00:02:44.970> metal<00:02:45.209> that's

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
because that is a piece of metal that's

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:46.940 
because that is a piece of metal that's
inserted<00:02:45.900> in<00:02:45.959> your<00:02:46.050> body<00:02:46.260> that<00:02:46.380> can<00:02:46.680> create

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
recommend that either so the best and

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.540 
recommend that either so the best and
most<00:02:58.440> elegant<00:02:58.890> solution<00:02:58.950> however<00:02:59.280> it's

most elegant solution however it's

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.670 
most elegant solution however it's

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
clearly the most expensive and can be up

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.620 
clearly the most expensive and can be up
to<00:03:01.950> several<00:03:02.370> thousand<00:03:02.910> dollars<00:03:03.000> would<00:03:03.450> be<00:03:03.600> a

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
to several thousand dollars would be a

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.240 
to several thousand dollars would be a

bridge and a bridge is simply where they
we<00:03:06.239> have<00:03:06.420> a<00:03:06.450> hole<00:03:06.750> in<00:03:06.780> the<00:03:06.989> middle<00:03:07.140> and<00:03:07.459> then<00:03:08.459> he

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
we have a hole in the middle and then he

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.360 
we have a hole in the middle and then he
actually<00:03:09.450> remove<00:03:09.810> portion<00:03:10.470> of<00:03:10.590> the<00:03:11.100> adjacent

actually remove portion of the adjacent
teeth<00:03:11.700> and

teeth and

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.220 
teeth and
cap<00:03:13.010> on<00:03:13.280> those<00:03:13.489> and<00:03:13.730> then<00:03:13.819> there's<00:03:14.000> a<00:03:14.230> fake

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
cap on those and then there's a fake

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.170 
cap on those and then there's a fake
tooth<00:03:15.500> essentially<00:03:16.069> in<00:03:16.220> the<00:03:16.310> middle<00:03:16.700> that

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
tooth essentially in the middle that

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:18.819 
tooth essentially in the middle that
covers<00:03:17.720> that<00:03:17.870> space<00:03:18.200> and<00:03:18.409> preserves<00:03:18.709> it

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:18.829 
covers that space and preserves it

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:19.990 
covers that space and preserves it
because<00:03:19.069> the<00:03:19.280> last<00:03:19.400> thing<00:03:19.489> you<00:03:19.579> want<00:03:19.760> to<00:03:19.790> do<00:03:19.909> is

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
because the last thing you want to do is

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.220 
because the last thing you want to do is
leave<00:03:20.180> an<00:03:20.329> open<00:03:20.599> space<00:03:20.780> in<00:03:20.930> your<00:03:21.019> teeth

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
leave an open space in your teeth

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.380 
leave an open space in your teeth
because<00:03:21.379> eventually<00:03:21.829> that<00:03:22.099> the<00:03:22.819> other<00:03:23.090> teeth

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
because eventually that the other teeth

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.000 
because eventually that the other teeth
will<00:03:23.629> shift<00:03:24.140> and<00:03:24.439> that<00:03:24.590> will<00:03:24.769> cause<00:03:24.920> the

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
will shift and that will cause the

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.350 
will shift and that will cause the
dysfunction<00:03:25.459> of<00:03:25.549> vitamin<00:03:25.909> C<00:03:26.030> which<00:03:26.239> is

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
dysfunction of vitamin C which is

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.940 
dysfunction of vitamin C which is
associated<00:03:26.659> with<00:03:26.870> lots<00:03:27.290> of<00:03:27.439> difficult

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
associated with lots of difficult

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.179 
associated with lots of difficult
different<00:03:28.489> problems<00:03:29.030> so<00:03:29.890> this<00:03:30.890> is<00:03:31.069> an

00:03:31.179 --> 00:03:31.189 
different problems so this is an

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:32.949 
different problems so this is an
important<00:03:31.549> issue<00:03:31.700> and<00:03:32.000> clearly<00:03:32.720> most

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
important issue and clearly most

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:36.809 
important issue and clearly most
dentists<00:03:33.799> do<00:03:34.459> are<00:03:35.359> not<00:03:35.599> aligned<00:03:35.930> with<00:03:35.959> this

dentists do are not aligned with this

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:40.289 
dentists do are not aligned with this

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:40.299 
cavitation theory of root canal so the

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:43.449 
cavitation theory of root canal so the

best alternative dentist in the area and

best alternative dentist in the area and

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:04.819 
then I would actually do that for

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:07.960 
then I would actually do that for
several<00:04:05.239> stores<00:04:05.540> and<00:04:05.950> find<00:04:06.950> a<00:04:07.069> consensus<00:04:07.760> as

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
that I've used many times for many of

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:15.789 
that I've used many times for many of
our<00:04:14.900> patients<00:04:15.049> who<00:04:15.260> come<00:04:15.379> in<00:04:15.530> from<00:04:15.650> out<00:04:15.769> of

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:15.799 
our patients who come in from out of

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:17.110 
our patients who come in from out of
town<00:04:15.920> and<00:04:16.190> I<00:04:16.250> don't<00:04:16.310> know<00:04:16.639> the<00:04:16.820> local

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 
town and I don't know the local

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.029 
town and I don't know the local
practitioners<00:04:17.690> there<00:04:17.930> so<00:04:18.650> this<00:04:18.859> is<00:04:19.010> a

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:19.039 
practitioners there so this is a

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:21.789 
practitioners there so this is a
hopefully<00:04:19.940> a<00:04:19.970> practical<00:04:20.630> tool<00:04:20.780> for<00:04:21.260> a

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
hopefully a practical tool for a

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:24.100 
hopefully a practical tool for a
challenge<00:04:22.729> that<00:04:22.910> many<00:04:23.120> of<00:04:23.330> us<00:04:23.389> are<00:04:23.539> exposed<00:04:23.900> to

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
challenge that many of us are exposed to

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.219 
challenge that many of us are exposed to
