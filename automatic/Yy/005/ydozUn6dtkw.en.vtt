game<00:03:29.640> I<00:03:29.970> have<00:03:30.900> to<00:03:31.019> say<00:03:31.310> maybe<00:03:32.310> it<00:03:32.459> was<00:03:32.519> because

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.270 
game I have to say maybe it was because
it<00:03:33.090> was<00:03:33.120> the<00:03:33.360> first<00:03:33.390> time<00:03:34.230> I<00:03:34.470> experienced<00:03:35.130> the

game like that or whatever but it was

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:39.440 
game like that or whatever but it was
the<00:03:37.230> best<00:03:37.380> to<00:03:37.769> me<00:03:37.950> maybe<00:03:38.880> it's<00:03:39.090> constant

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
the best to me maybe it's constant

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.090
