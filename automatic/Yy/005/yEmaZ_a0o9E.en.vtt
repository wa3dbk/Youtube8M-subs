you can change the text in a UI label

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.480 
you can change the text in a UI label
programmatically<00:00:19.020> and<00:00:19.350> it<00:00:19.740> is<00:00:19.859> really<00:00:20.310> really

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
programmatically and it is really really

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:21.140 
programmatically and it is really really
easy

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
easy

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.120

so<00:00:22.050> we're<00:00:22.170> going<00:00:22.260> to<00:00:22.320> start<00:00:22.529> a<00:00:22.590> single<00:00:22.980> view

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
so we're going to start a single view

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.590 
so we're going to start a single view
application<00:00:23.189> and<00:00:23.850> I'm<00:00:23.939> going<00:00:24.150> to<00:00:24.210> call<00:00:24.390> this

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
application and I'm going to call this

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:40.340 
application and I'm going to call this
label<00:00:25.580> save<00:00:26.580> it<00:00:26.789> on<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.090> desktop<00:00:37.190> and<00:00:39.350> open

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
label save it on the desktop and open

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.340 
label save it on the desktop and open
this<00:00:40.469> up<00:00:40.680> alright<00:00:41.219> okay<00:00:42.059> so<00:00:42.809> first<00:00:43.050> thing<00:00:43.230> what

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
this up alright okay so first thing what

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.540 
this up alright okay so first thing what
we're<00:00:43.469> going<00:00:43.590> to<00:00:43.620> do<00:00:43.739> is<00:00:43.980> we're<00:00:44.250> going<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.399> go

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
we're going to do is we're going to go

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.430 
we're going to do is we're going to go
into<00:00:44.789> our<00:00:44.879> view<00:00:45.120> controller<00:00:45.510> dot<00:00:45.600> xib<00:00:46.079> file

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
into our view controller dot xib file

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.910 
into our view controller dot xib file
this<00:00:47.010> is<00:00:47.250> our<00:00:47.520> interface<00:00:48.059> file<00:00:48.450> so<00:00:49.440> open<00:00:49.770> that

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
this is our interface file so open that

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.600 
this is our interface file so open that
up<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:51.410> we're<00:00:52.410> going<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.559> drag<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:52.980> drop<00:00:53.160> a<00:00:53.340> UI

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
up and we're going to drag and drop a UI

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.990 
up and we're going to drag and drop a UI
label<00:00:53.840> into<00:00:54.840> our<00:00:54.989> view<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.789> then<00:00:56.789> you<00:00:56.850> can

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
label into our view and then you can

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.400 
label into our view and then you can
make<00:00:57.120> this<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.270> bit<00:00:57.390> bigger<00:00:57.449> you<00:00:57.899> can<00:00:58.079> edit<00:00:58.199> the

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
make this a bit bigger you can edit the

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:07.690 
make this a bit bigger you can edit the
font<00:00:58.590> and<00:00:58.859> so<00:00:59.070> on<00:01:00.199> so<00:01:01.199> we<00:01:01.320> can<00:01:01.440> just<00:01:01.620> do<00:01:01.770> that

place it in the middle save that so now
we're<00:01:19.619> going<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.799> come<00:01:19.950> into<00:01:20.100> our<00:01:20.220> view

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
we're going to come into our view

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.020 
we're going to come into our view
controller<00:01:20.850> dot<00:01:21.119> H<00:01:21.360> file<00:01:21.689> and<00:01:21.960> start<00:01:22.530> coding

so it's really is very simple so let's

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:23.770 
so it's really is very simple so let's
just<00:03:22.340> start<00:03:22.579> from<00:03:22.879> our<00:03:23.060> view<00:03:23.299> control<00:03:23.629> that

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
just start from our view control that

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.490 
just start from our view control that
each<00:03:23.959> file<00:03:24.199> so<00:03:24.769> we've<00:03:25.000> added<00:03:26.000> an<00:03:26.449> a<00:03:26.870> label<00:03:27.379> or

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
each file so we've added an a label or

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.530 
each file so we've added an a label or
we've<00:03:27.829> defined<00:03:28.400> a<00:03:28.579> label<00:03:28.909> and<00:03:29.060> we've<00:03:29.299> called

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
we've defined a label and we've called

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.689 
we've defined a label and we've called
it<00:03:29.659> label<00:03:29.930> one<00:03:30.109> we've<00:03:30.769> added<00:03:30.919> a<00:03:31.099> button<00:03:31.310> called

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:31.699 
it label one we've added a button called

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:34.659 
it label one we've added a button called
change<00:03:32.060> text<00:03:32.540> and<00:03:32.799> when<00:03:33.799> the<00:03:33.949> button<00:03:34.280> change

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:34.669 
change text and when the button change

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:37.809 
change text and when the button change
text<00:03:35.180> is<00:03:35.359> pressed<00:03:35.750> it<00:03:36.440> changes<00:03:36.919> our<00:03:37.069> label<00:03:37.549> 1

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:37.819 
text is pressed it changes our label 1

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:40.319 
text is pressed it changes our label 1
from<00:03:38.720> whatever<00:03:38.959> text<00:03:39.349> it's<00:03:39.590> currently<00:03:39.859> saying

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:40.329 
from whatever text it's currently saying

simple

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:47.469 
simple
so<00:03:45.229> we've<00:03:45.379> connected<00:03:45.590> our<00:03:45.829> code<00:03:46.129> we've<00:03:46.819> coded

00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:47.479 
so we've connected our code we've coded

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:50.229 
so we've connected our code we've coded
up<00:03:47.629> for<00:03:47.900> program<00:03:48.349> so<00:03:48.560> that's<00:03:48.680> run<00:03:49.669> this<00:03:50.000> app

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239 
up for program so that's run this app

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:52.439 
up for program so that's run this app
and<00:03:50.540> it<00:03:50.840> should<00:03:51.049> all<00:03:51.169> work<00:03:51.199> perfectly<00:03:51.889> fine

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:52.449 
and it should all work perfectly fine

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:56.589 
and it should all work perfectly fine
which<00:03:53.449> it<00:03:53.810> does<00:03:54.139> no<00:03:54.470> errors<00:03:54.799> whatsoever<00:03:55.599> there

00:03:56.589 --> 00:03:56.599 
which it does no errors whatsoever there

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:59.469 
which it does no errors whatsoever there
we<00:03:56.690> go<00:03:56.840> build<00:03:57.079> succeeded<00:03:57.849> just<00:03:58.849> wait<00:03:59.090> for<00:03:59.269> the

00:03:59.469 --> 00:03:59.479 
we go build succeeded just wait for the

00:03:59.479 --> 00:04:05.559 
we go build succeeded just wait for the
iOS<00:03:59.930> simulator<00:04:00.349> to<00:04:00.829> open<00:04:01.280> up<00:04:03.940> now<00:04:04.940> this<00:04:05.150> code

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:05.569 
iOS simulator to open up now this code

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:08.080 
iOS simulator to open up now this code
can<00:04:05.780> also<00:04:05.930> be<00:04:06.139> used<00:04:06.379> for<00:04:06.530> a<00:04:06.769> UI<00:04:07.190> text<00:04:07.639> view<00:04:07.970> as

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
can also be used for a UI text view as

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.839 
can also be used for a UI text view as
well<00:04:08.269> it's<00:04:08.479> not<00:04:08.510> just<00:04:08.659> label<00:04:09.290> so<00:04:10.159> a<00:04:10.190> UI<00:04:10.489> text

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:10.849 
well it's not just label so a UI text

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:13.390 
well it's not just label so a UI text
view<00:04:11.180> is<00:04:11.299> basically<00:04:11.659> a<00:04:11.810> small<00:04:12.650> chunk<00:04:12.979> a

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
view is basically a small chunk a

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.520 
view is basically a small chunk a
smaller<00:04:13.940> sort<00:04:14.329> of<00:04:14.389> box<00:04:14.629> and<00:04:14.930> it's<00:04:15.409> a

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
smaller sort of box and it's a

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.710 
smaller sort of box and it's a
scrollable<00:04:16.099> view<00:04:16.519> so<00:04:16.789> you<00:04:16.820> can<00:04:17.150> put<00:04:17.389> a<00:04:17.419> whole

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
scrollable view so you can put a whole

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.050 
scrollable view so you can put a whole
paragraph<00:04:17.959> a<00:04:18.380> text<00:04:18.799> in<00:04:18.919> in<00:04:19.070> a<00:04:19.190> small<00:04:19.459> space<00:04:19.760> and

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
paragraph a text in in a small space and

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.230 
paragraph a text in in a small space and
use<00:04:20.630> it<00:04:20.779> and<00:04:20.930> scroll<00:04:21.229> through<00:04:21.289> that<00:04:22.240> through

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
use it and scroll through that through

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.730 
use it and scroll through that through
that<00:04:23.389> little<00:04:23.539> space<00:04:23.870> and<00:04:24.169> view<00:04:24.440> all<00:04:24.560> in<00:04:24.680> the

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
that little space and view all in the

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.830 
that little space and view all in the
text<00:04:25.159> so<00:04:25.340> this<00:04:26.270> code<00:04:26.570> work

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
text so this code work

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.960 
text so this code work
perfectly<00:04:27.350> with<00:04:27.560> that<00:04:27.590> as<00:04:27.800> well<00:04:28.160> it<00:04:28.669> works
