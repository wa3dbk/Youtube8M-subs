hey<00:00:10.980> everybody<00:00:11.429> Skyler<00:00:12.030> here<00:00:12.300> today<00:00:12.630> we're

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
hey everybody Skyler here today we're

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.690 
hey everybody Skyler here today we're
going<00:00:12.870> to<00:00:12.990> be<00:00:13.080> looking<00:00:13.410> at<00:00:13.650> probably<00:00:14.429> the

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
going to be looking at probably the

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.129 
going to be looking at probably the
first<00:00:14.940> lock<00:00:15.179> that<00:00:15.360> really<00:00:15.599> ignited<00:00:15.900> my

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
first lock that really ignited my

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.010 
first lock that really ignited my
interest<00:00:16.619> in<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:17.520> mechanical<00:00:18.180> security<00:00:18.750> side

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
interest in the mechanical security side

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.010 
interest in the mechanical security side
of<00:00:19.470> lock-picking<00:00:20.039> I<00:00:20.480> enjoyed<00:00:21.480> picking<00:00:21.660> locks

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
of lock-picking I enjoyed picking locks

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.840 
of lock-picking I enjoyed picking locks
I<00:00:22.289> did<00:00:22.769> pretty<00:00:22.890> well<00:00:23.010> at<00:00:23.369> it<00:00:23.519> and<00:00:23.640> I<00:00:23.699> learned

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
I did pretty well at it and I learned

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.370 
I did pretty well at it and I learned
about<00:00:24.119> a<00:00:24.180> few<00:00:24.390> different<00:00:24.660> locks<00:00:24.810> but<00:00:25.080> nothing

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
about a few different locks but nothing

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.570 
about a few different locks but nothing
really<00:00:25.769> took<00:00:25.890> my<00:00:26.070> breath<00:00:26.099> away

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
really took my breath away

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.880 
really took my breath away
like<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.480> M<00:00:27.660> Hart<00:00:27.990> interlocking<00:00:28.680> pin

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
like the M Hart interlocking pin

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.389

cylinder now early on I managed to get
my<00:00:32.579> hands<00:00:32.880> on<00:00:33.270> a<00:00:33.300> fairly<00:00:34.050> straightforward

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:34.579 
my hands on a fairly straightforward

my hands on a fairly straightforward
closed<00:00:35.579> bodied<00:00:36.090> job<00:00:36.719> but<00:00:37.290> what<00:00:37.440> I<00:00:37.469> want<00:00:37.680> to

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
closed bodied job but what I want to

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.250 
closed bodied job but what I want to
show<00:00:37.860> you<00:00:37.950> today<00:00:38.129> is<00:00:39.030> my<00:00:39.980> cutaway<00:00:41.390> so<00:00:42.390> this

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
show you today is my cutaway so this

lock both lifts and rotates it spins

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.920 
lock both lifts and rotates it spins
similar<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:45.690> Medeco<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:47.149> the<00:00:48.149> pins<00:00:48.450> rather

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
similar to a Medeco and the pins rather

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.660 
similar to a Medeco and the pins rather
than<00:00:49.110> working<00:00:49.260> with<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.530> side<00:00:49.860> bar<00:00:50.160> are

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
than working with a side bar are

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.880 
than working with a side bar are
actually<00:00:51.000> coupled<00:00:51.539> into<00:00:51.899> one<00:00:52.230> another<00:00:52.530> locked

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
actually coupled into one another locked

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.040 
actually coupled into one another locked
into<00:00:53.129> one<00:00:53.370> another<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:53.789> when<00:00:54.449> they're<00:00:54.600> lifted

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
into one another and when they're lifted

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.020 
into one another and when they're lifted
and<00:00:55.170> rotated<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.710> right<00:00:55.800> position<00:00:56.030> they

and rotated to the right position they

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.439 
and rotated to the right position they
can<00:00:57.090> decouple<00:00:58.370> so<00:00:59.370> let's<00:01:00.000> have<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.210> quick<00:01:00.420> look

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
can decouple so let's have a quick look

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.490 
can decouple so let's have a quick look
at<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:01.170> actual<00:01:01.469> operation<00:01:02.039> of<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.280> lock<00:01:03.500> the

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
at the actual operation of the lock the

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.440 
at the actual operation of the lock the
amount<00:01:04.769> key<00:01:04.920> on<00:01:05.070> closer<00:01:05.309> inspection<00:01:05.489> it's<00:01:06.299> not

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
amount key on closer inspection it's not

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.570 
amount key on closer inspection it's not
only<00:01:06.630> cut<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:06.990> slight<00:01:07.229> angles<00:01:07.619> but<00:01:08.400> it<00:01:08.460> also

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
only cut to slight angles but it also

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.179 
only cut to slight angles but it also
has<00:01:08.820> these<00:01:09.030> big<00:01:09.930> notches<00:01:10.650> cut<00:01:10.860> out<00:01:11.010> of<00:01:11.130> the

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
has these big notches cut out of the

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:11.840 
has these big notches cut out of the
bottom<00:01:11.490> of<00:01:11.549> it

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
bottom of it

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.940 
bottom of it
now<00:01:12.570> these<00:01:12.869> notches<00:01:13.140> have<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.619> be<00:01:13.710> in<00:01:13.799> place

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
now these notches have to be in place

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.740 
now these notches have to be in place
because<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.549> cylinder<00:01:14.970> itself<00:01:15.330> is<00:01:15.509> notched

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
because the cylinder itself is notched

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.940 
because the cylinder itself is notched
and<00:01:16.280> we'll<00:01:17.280> show<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:17.549> why<00:01:17.909> in<00:01:18.570> just<00:01:18.659> a<00:01:18.960> minute

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.090 

so<00:01:22.950> clearly<00:01:23.700> take<00:01:23.970> keyway<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:25.590> action<00:01:26.040> of

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
so clearly take keyway and the action of

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.770 
so clearly take keyway and the action of
it<00:01:26.220> is<00:01:26.310> always<00:01:26.520> very<00:01:26.580> strong<00:01:26.850> on<00:01:27.420> them<00:01:27.540> hurts

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
it is always very strong on them hurts

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.600 
it is always very strong on them hurts
I've<00:01:28.049> never<00:01:28.259> had<00:01:28.470> an<00:01:28.590> M<00:01:28.710> heart<00:01:28.950> where<00:01:29.189> I<00:01:29.220> felt

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
I've never had an M heart where I felt

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.289 
I've never had an M heart where I felt
like<00:01:29.780> it<00:01:30.780> was<00:01:30.930> going<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.290> give<00:01:31.470> way<00:01:31.650> easily<00:01:32.299> so

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
like it was going to give way easily so

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.690 
like it was going to give way easily so
we're<00:01:33.509> just<00:01:33.540> have<00:01:33.840> a<00:01:33.900> look<00:01:34.079> at<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.470> third<00:01:34.860> pin

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
we're just have a look at the third pin

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.140 
we're just have a look at the third pin
chamber<00:01:36.119> with<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.750> key<00:01:37.020> partially<00:01:37.850> out<00:01:38.850> of

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
chamber with the key partially out of

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.210 
chamber with the key partially out of
the<00:01:39.329> lock<00:01:39.540> you're<00:01:40.530> going<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.799> see<00:01:40.950> that<00:01:41.100> there

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
the lock you're going to see that there

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.800 
the lock you're going to see that there
are<00:01:41.280> two<00:01:41.460> pins<00:01:41.790> interlocked<00:01:42.509> with<00:01:42.600> one

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
are two pins interlocked with one

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.210 
are two pins interlocked with one
another<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:43.290> then<00:01:43.380> when<00:01:43.500> we<00:01:43.590> push<00:01:43.799> in<00:01:44.060> fully

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
another and then when we push in fully

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.350 
another and then when we push in fully
there<00:01:47.220> now<00:01:47.369> all<00:01:47.520> at<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.790> right<00:01:47.820> height<00:01:48.149> and

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
there now all at the right height and

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.929 
there now all at the right height and
the<00:01:48.689> right<00:01:48.810> rotation<00:01:49.100> to<00:01:50.100> D<00:01:50.280> couple<00:01:50.670> from<00:01:50.820> one

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
the right rotation to D couple from one

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:57.410 
the right rotation to D couple from one
another<00:01:51.180> so<00:01:52.369> little<00:01:53.369> tracks<00:01:53.759> in<00:01:54.320> the<00:01:56.240> plug<00:01:57.240> of

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
another so little tracks in the plug of

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.859 
another so little tracks in the plug of
the<00:01:57.479> lock<00:01:57.950> allow<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.009> tips<00:01:59.430> of<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.939> driver

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
the lock allow the tips of the driver

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.899 
the lock allow the tips of the driver
pins<00:02:01.200> to<00:02:01.469> stay<00:02:01.649> in<00:02:01.770> place<00:02:02.070> so<00:02:02.340> they<00:02:02.460> can<00:02:02.490> wreak

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
pins to stay in place so they can wreak

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.789 
pins to stay in place so they can wreak
Uppal<00:02:03.299> with<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.110> key<00:02:04.259> pins<00:02:04.469> and<00:02:04.619> they<00:02:04.680> come

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
Uppal with the key pins and they come

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.950 
Uppal with the key pins and they come
around<00:02:04.920> now<00:02:05.790> here<00:02:06.000> is<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.240> bottom<00:02:06.600> of<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.810> key

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
around now here is the bottom of the key

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.749 
around now here is the bottom of the key
coming<00:02:07.200> around<00:02:07.439> with<00:02:07.590> its<00:02:07.770> gaps<00:02:08.069> cut<00:02:08.369> out<00:02:08.520> for

alright<00:03:21.510> I<00:03:21.720> almost<00:03:22.560> dread<00:03:23.400> doing<00:03:23.850> this<00:03:24.030> and

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
alright I almost dread doing this and

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.449 
alright I almost dread doing this and
we're<00:03:24.780> not<00:03:24.810> going<00:03:25.050> to<00:03:25.440> do<00:03:25.650> it<00:03:25.680> to<00:03:25.860> the<00:03:25.980> cutaway

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459

we're not going to do it to the cutaway
we'll<00:03:26.760> set<00:03:26.970> this<00:03:27.090> aside<00:03:27.739> but<00:03:28.739> let's<00:03:29.330> open<00:03:30.330> up

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
we'll set this aside but let's open up

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:37.310 
we'll set this aside but let's open up
my<00:03:32.459> full<00:03:33.180> body<00:03:33.380> okay<00:03:34.700> so<00:03:35.700> as<00:03:35.940> I<00:03:36.239> was<00:03:36.480> starting

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
my full body okay so as I was starting

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.020 
my full body okay so as I was starting
to<00:03:37.500> pull<00:03:37.709> apart<00:03:38.010> the<00:03:38.070> full<00:03:38.280> body<00:03:38.519> block<00:03:38.790> I

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
to pull apart the full body block I

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.900 
to pull apart the full body block I
forgot<00:03:39.989> that<00:03:40.380> you<00:03:40.590> can't<00:03:40.860> actually<00:03:41.130> pull<00:03:41.610> an

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
most other locks now I don't want to

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.460 
most other locks now I don't want to
deal<00:03:47.910> with<00:03:48.060> ripping<00:03:48.390> this<00:03:48.510> piece<00:03:48.690> of<00:03:48.870> brass<00:03:49.140> up

of<00:03:54.360> the<00:03:54.480> driver<00:03:54.810> pins<00:03:55.200> will<00:03:55.530> hold<00:03:55.800> the<00:03:56.010> plug<00:03:56.220> in

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
of the driver pins will hold the plug in

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.090 
of the driver pins will hold the plug in

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
what I'm going to do is deal with my

what I'm going to do is deal with my

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.100 
because doing it like this I should

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.240 
because doing it like this I should
hopefully<00:04:11.370> be<00:04:12.000> able<00:04:12.090> to<00:04:12.209> just<00:04:12.560> push<00:04:13.560> my<00:04:13.799> way<00:04:13.980> in

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
hopefully be able to just push my way in

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.050 
hopefully be able to just push my way in
here<00:04:14.280> and<00:04:15.410> pull<00:04:16.410> those<00:04:17.010> driver<00:04:17.370> pins<00:04:17.640> up<00:04:17.850> a

here and pull those driver pins up a

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.710 
here and pull those driver pins up a
little<00:04:18.419> bit<00:04:18.660> more<00:04:19.280> now<00:04:20.280> let<00:04:20.370> me<00:04:20.459> tell<00:04:20.609> you<00:04:20.669> if<00:04:21.570> I

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
little bit more now let me tell you if I

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.779 
little bit more now let me tell you if I

was at home watching this video I would

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:26.290 
was at home watching this video I would
be<00:04:24.440> flipping<00:04:25.440> out

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
be flipping out

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.300 
be flipping out
whoever<00:04:26.569> was<00:04:26.780> being<00:04:27.080> this<00:04:28.039> big<00:04:28.490> of<00:04:28.729> a<00:04:28.940> goon<00:04:29.330> and

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
whoever was being this big of a goon and

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.200 
whoever was being this big of a goon and
touching<00:04:31.310> all<00:04:31.430> of<00:04:31.490> this<00:04:31.729> stuff<00:04:32.000> with<00:04:32.180> a

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
touching all of this stuff with a

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.980 
touching all of this stuff with a
screwdriver<00:04:33.909> and<00:04:34.909> what<00:04:35.030> I<00:04:35.060> am<00:04:35.300> probably<00:04:35.750> going

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
screwdriver and what I am probably going

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.409 
screwdriver and what I am probably going
to<00:04:36.110> do<00:04:36.289> is<00:04:36.530> actually<00:04:36.740> very<00:04:37.400> carefully<00:04:37.970> rekey

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:38.419 
to do is actually very carefully rekey

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:40.689 
to do is actually very carefully rekey
this<00:04:38.659> later<00:04:38.930> so<00:04:39.139> that<00:04:39.259> I<00:04:39.319> can<00:04:39.470> have<00:04:39.680> the<00:04:40.490> most

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:40.699 
this later so that I can have the most

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:44.350 
this later so that I can have the most
pristine<00:04:40.970> pins<00:04:41.509> possible<00:04:42.110> in<00:04:42.229> my<00:04:42.349> cutaway<00:04:43.360> so

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
pristine pins possible in my cutaway so

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.960 
pristine pins possible in my cutaway so
my<00:04:44.479> strategy<00:04:44.720> here<00:04:45.289> has<00:04:45.409> been<00:04:45.590> to<00:04:45.860> lift<00:04:46.610> and

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
my strategy here has been to lift and

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:51.189 
my strategy here has been to lift and
miss<00:04:47.960> align<00:04:48.879> the<00:04:49.879> driver<00:04:50.150> pins<00:04:50.479> so<00:04:50.780> they<00:04:50.810> don't

00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:51.199 
miss align the driver pins so they don't

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:53.290 
miss align the driver pins so they don't
recover<00:04:51.860> because<00:04:52.490> they're<00:04:52.729> pretty<00:04:52.909> strong<00:04:53.120> so

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
recover because they're pretty strong so

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.210 
recover because they're pretty strong so
there<00:04:53.479> we<00:04:53.599> go<00:04:53.629> so<00:04:53.930> it's<00:04:54.440> able<00:04:54.530> to<00:04:54.650> lift<00:04:54.860> it<00:04:55.009> and

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
there we go so it's able to lift it and

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:58.689 
there we go so it's able to lift it and
turn<00:04:55.460> it<00:04:55.490> slightly<00:04:55.759> off<00:04:56.150> line<00:04:57.069> these<00:04:58.069> are<00:04:58.129> very

00:04:58.689 --> 00:04:58.699 
turn it slightly off line these are very

00:04:58.699 --> 00:04:59.890 
turn it slightly off line these are very
heavy<00:04:59.150> Springs

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900 
heavy Springs

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.249 
heavy Springs
and<00:05:00.080> after<00:05:00.409> the<00:05:00.590> debacle<00:05:01.340> that<00:05:01.690> was<00:05:02.690> our

00:05:03.249 --> 00:05:03.259 
and after the debacle that was our

00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:05.230 
and after the debacle that was our
attempt<00:05:04.099> to<00:05:04.219> disassemble<00:05:04.909> and<00:05:05.150> reassemble

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 
attempt to disassemble and reassemble

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.100 
attempt to disassemble and reassemble
that<00:05:06.050> LSL<00:05:06.830> lock<00:05:07.069> last<00:05:07.490> time<00:05:07.729> around<00:05:07.879> I'm<00:05:08.780> going

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.110 
that LSL lock last time around I'm going

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:14.920 
that LSL lock last time around I'm going
to<00:05:09.199> be<00:05:09.319> very<00:05:09.710> conservative<00:05:10.219> and<00:05:11.349> just<00:05:13.659> drop<00:05:14.659> a

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930 
to be very conservative and just drop a

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:20.350 
to be very conservative and just drop a
single<00:05:15.620> set<00:05:16.009> of<00:05:16.039> pins<00:05:17.860> all<00:05:18.860> right<00:05:19.069> so<00:05:19.879> we<00:05:20.330> have

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:20.360 
single set of pins all right so we have

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.589 
single set of pins all right so we have
one<00:05:21.289> key<00:05:21.560> pin<00:05:21.830> and<00:05:22.099> one<00:05:22.370> driver<00:05:22.729> pin<00:05:23.060> and<00:05:23.330> one

one key pin and one driver pin and one

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:26.020 
one key pin and one driver pin and one
spring<00:05:24.080> and<00:05:24.710> we're<00:05:25.069> gonna<00:05:25.159> go<00:05:25.340> close<00:05:25.610> up<00:05:25.849> here

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.030

I hope to see why I fell in love with
the<00:05:57.139> EM<00:05:57.229> heart<00:05:58.150> and<00:05:59.150> unfortunately<00:05:59.750> they're

00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:00.139 
the EM heart and unfortunately they're

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:02.080 
the EM heart and unfortunately they're
much<00:06:00.440> harder<00:06:00.650> to<00:06:00.770> come<00:06:00.919> by<00:06:01.039> now<00:06:01.219> remember<00:06:01.969> when

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:02.090 
much harder to come by now remember when

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:03.550 
much harder to come by now remember when
I<00:06:02.120> said<00:06:02.360> that<00:06:02.389> they<00:06:02.569> lift<00:06:02.930> and<00:06:03.080> rotate<00:06:03.199> like<00:06:03.529> a

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:03.560 
I said that they lift and rotate like a

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:04.930 
I said that they lift and rotate like a
Medeco<00:06:03.949> well<00:06:04.279> that<00:06:04.400> will<00:06:04.490> end<00:06:04.639> up<00:06:04.729> getting

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:04.940 
Medeco well that will end up getting

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:06.670 
Medeco well that will end up getting
them<00:06:05.060> into<00:06:05.240> some<00:06:05.389> legal<00:06:05.569> trouble<00:06:05.750> I<00:06:06.080> don't

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:06.680 
them into some legal trouble I don't

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.980 
them into some legal trouble I don't
have<00:06:06.770> the<00:06:06.860> actual<00:06:07.009> court<00:06:07.340> documents<00:06:07.849> I<00:06:08.090> should

have the actual court documents I should
