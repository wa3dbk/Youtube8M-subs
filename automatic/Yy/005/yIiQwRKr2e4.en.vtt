00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:32.620 
want to do that go ahead but I've read
through<00:01:31.340> some<00:01:31.460> issues<00:01:31.790> and<00:01:32.090> has<00:01:32.180> experienced

through some issues and has experienced
a<00:01:32.690> couple<00:01:32.930> issues<00:01:32.990> myself<00:01:33.350> make<00:01:34.190> sure<00:01:34.220> you

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
a couple issues myself make sure you

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.010 
a couple issues myself make sure you
back<00:01:34.730> up<00:01:34.760> your<00:01:35.060> current<00:01:35.510> ROM<00:01:35.690> in<00:01:35.840> case

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
back up your current ROM in case

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.110 
back up your current ROM in case
anything<00:01:36.350> goes<00:01:36.590> wrong<00:01:36.710> on<00:01:37.190> a<00:01:37.430> kernel<00:01:37.880> will<00:01:38.000> not

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:38.120 
anything goes wrong on a kernel will not

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.000 
anything goes wrong on a kernel will not
break<00:01:38.300> your<00:01:38.360> device<00:01:38.690> it<00:01:39.260> will<00:01:39.590> just<00:01:39.800> make<00:01:39.980> it

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.010 
break your device it will just make it

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:41.830 
break your device it will just make it
on<00:01:40.250> a<00:01:40.280> boot<00:01:40.490> loop<00:01:40.610> and<00:01:40.880> will<00:01:41.210> they<00:01:41.300> back<00:01:41.600> up

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
on a boot loop and will they back up

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.200 
on a boot loop and will they back up
obviously<00:01:42.650> you<00:01:42.740> need<00:01:42.890> to<00:01:42.980> be<00:01:43.100> you<00:01:43.820> need<00:01:43.850> to<00:01:44.090> be

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
obviously you need to be you need to be

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.050 
obviously you need to be you need to be
rooted<00:01:44.570> um<00:01:44.740> but<00:01:45.740> if<00:01:45.920> you<00:01:46.040> want<00:01:46.430> to<00:01:46.520> backup<00:01:46.700> your

rooted um but if you want to backup your

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.149 
rooted um but if you want to backup your
current<00:01:47.570> ROM<00:01:47.750> and<00:01:48.050> you<00:01:48.320> can<00:01:48.440> just<00:01:49.000> rerun<00:01:50.000> the

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.159 
current ROM and you can just rerun the

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:53.290 
current ROM and you can just rerun the
nandroid<00:01:52.159> backup<00:01:52.730> and<00:01:52.909> you<00:01:53.000> should<00:01:53.180> be<00:01:53.210> good

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.659 
it's just a matter of finding it so as
you<00:04:27.050> can<00:04:27.289> see<00:04:27.500> it<00:04:27.710> is<00:04:27.830> the<00:04:27.949> second<00:04:28.310> one<00:04:28.400> to<00:04:28.550> the

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:28.669 
you can see it is the second one to the

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:30.300 
you can see it is the second one to the
bottom<00:04:28.970> we're<00:04:29.240> just<00:04:29.300> going<00:04:29.479> to<00:04:29.570> select<00:04:29.810> it<00:04:30.050> and

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.749 
bottom we're just going to select it and
we're<00:04:31.310> going<00:04:31.490> to<00:04:31.520> hit<00:04:31.729> yes<00:04:32.030> so<00:04:32.389> it<00:04:32.539> is<00:04:32.570> the

00:04:33.749 --> 00:04:33.759 
we're going to hit yes so it is the

we're going to hit ditch optical

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:44.499 
we're going to hit ditch optical
trackpad<00:04:40.070> and<00:04:42.610> it<00:04:43.610> is<00:04:43.759> done<00:04:43.970> we<00:04:44.240> are<00:04:44.300> now<00:04:44.419> I'm

00:04:44.499 --> 00:04:44.509 
trackpad and it is done we are now I'm

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:45.939

going<00:04:44.630> to<00:04:44.690> hit<00:04:44.840> the<00:04:44.870> power<00:04:45.380> button<00:04:45.470> to<00:04:45.800> go<00:04:45.919> back

00:04:45.939 --> 00:04:45.949 
going to hit the power button to go back

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:48.580 
going to hit the power button to go back
once<00:04:46.370> and<00:04:46.639> we<00:04:47.479> are<00:04:47.570> going<00:04:47.690> to<00:04:47.750> reboot<00:04:48.229> system

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
once and we are going to reboot system

00:04:48.590 --> 00:05:17.110 
once and we are going to reboot system
now<00:04:52.900> so<00:04:53.900> our<00:04:54.139> device<00:04:54.410> is<00:04:54.590> now<00:04:54.740> rebooting

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:30.839 

Oh

00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:30.849 

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:32.999 

and<00:05:31.330> the<00:05:31.809> initial<00:05:31.990> might<00:05:32.529> take<00:05:32.740> a<00:05:32.770> while

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:33.009 
and the initial might take a while

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:35.070 
and the initial might take a while
because<00:05:33.279> you<00:05:33.639> are<00:05:33.789> you<00:05:34.360> just<00:05:34.569> flashing<00:05:34.990> a

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:35.080 
because you are you just flashing a

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.589 
because you are you just flashing a
custom<00:05:35.529> kernel<00:05:35.770> but<00:05:36.189> it<00:05:36.429> should<00:05:37.089> boot

00:05:37.589 --> 00:05:37.599 
custom kernel but it should boot

00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:41.429 
custom kernel but it should boot
eventually<00:05:38.349> i<00:05:38.499> guess<00:05:38.740> i<00:05:38.979> should<00:05:39.189> say<00:05:40.289> but<00:05:41.289> I'm

00:05:41.429 --> 00:05:41.439 
eventually i guess i should say but I'm

00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:43.079 
eventually i guess i should say but I'm
going<00:05:41.649> to<00:05:41.740> pause<00:05:42.039> the<00:05:42.279> video<00:05:42.399> is<00:05:42.699> or<00:05:42.969> don't

00:05:43.079 --> 00:05:43.089 
going to pause the video is or don't

00:05:43.089 --> 00:05:44.760 
going to pause the video is or don't
have<00:05:43.209> to<00:05:43.419> wait<00:05:43.599> through<00:05:43.929> the<00:05:44.080> boot<00:05:44.229> because<00:05:44.409> it

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:44.770 
have to wait through the boot because it

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:47.159 
have to wait through the boot because it
might<00:05:44.889> take<00:05:45.069> a<00:05:45.099> while<00:05:45.189> and<00:05:45.639> as<00:05:46.419> you<00:05:46.599> can<00:05:46.749> see<00:05:46.779> we

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:47.169 
might take a while and as you can see we

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:49.739 
might take a while and as you can see we
now<00:05:47.319> have<00:05:47.619> cyanogenmod<00:05:48.309> of<00:05:48.550> seven<00:05:48.969> back<00:05:49.509> up

00:05:49.739 --> 00:05:49.749 
now have cyanogenmod of seven back up

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:52.019 
now have cyanogenmod of seven back up
the<00:05:49.990> boot<00:05:50.199> screen<00:05:50.469> so<00:05:50.800> the<00:05:51.249> initial<00:05:51.459> boot<00:05:51.789> took

00:05:52.019 --> 00:05:52.029 
the boot screen so the initial boot took

00:05:52.029 --> 00:05:55.169 
the boot screen so the initial boot took
about<00:05:52.800> probably<00:05:53.800> 15<00:05:54.009> to<00:05:54.369> 20<00:05:54.610> seconds<00:05:54.939> longer

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:55.179 
about probably 15 to 20 seconds longer

00:05:55.179 --> 00:05:56.909 
about probably 15 to 20 seconds longer
than<00:05:55.360> it<00:05:55.569> normally<00:05:55.719> does<00:05:56.139> but<00:05:56.589> you<00:05:56.800> know

00:05:56.909 --> 00:05:56.919 
than it normally does but you know

00:05:56.919 --> 00:06:03.209 
than it normally does but you know
that's<00:05:57.219> it<00:05:57.429> will<00:05:57.550> be<00:05:57.669> expected<00:06:00.719> and<00:06:02.069> I<00:06:03.069> mean

00:06:03.209 --> 00:06:03.219 
that's it will be expected and I mean

00:06:03.219 --> 00:06:04.469 
that's it will be expected and I mean
I'm<00:06:03.339> not<00:06:03.519> going<00:06:03.729> to<00:06:03.789> be<00:06:03.879> able<00:06:03.909> to<00:06:04.179> show<00:06:04.419> you

00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:04.479 
I'm not going to be able to show you

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:06.600 
I'm not going to be able to show you
right<00:06:04.839> away<00:06:05.050> what<00:06:05.379> differences<00:06:05.979> is<00:06:06.219> the

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:06.610 
right away what differences is the

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:09.629 
right away what differences is the
differences<00:06:07.089> are<00:06:07.300> but<00:06:08.289> um<00:06:08.559> we<00:06:09.279> can<00:06:09.459> go<00:06:09.550> to

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:09.639 
differences are but um we can go to

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:11.549 
differences are but um we can go to
overclocking<00:06:10.330> so<00:06:10.629> we'll<00:06:10.749> go<00:06:10.839> into<00:06:10.929> my<00:06:11.050> setcpu

00:06:11.549 --> 00:06:11.559 
overclocking so we'll go into my setcpu

00:06:11.559 --> 00:06:15.449 
overclocking so we'll go into my setcpu
app<00:06:12.479> will<00:06:13.479> load<00:06:13.719> that<00:06:14.019> and<00:06:14.289> it's<00:06:14.979> said<00:06:15.309> to<00:06:15.339> be

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:15.459 
app will load that and it's said to be

00:06:15.459 --> 00:06:17.669 
app will load that and it's said to be
more<00:06:15.789> stable<00:06:16.059> on<00:06:16.389> the<00:06:16.569> overclock<00:06:17.080> so<00:06:17.349> we<00:06:17.499> can

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:17.679 
more stable on the overclock so we can

00:06:17.679 --> 00:06:20.759 
more stable on the overclock so we can
drag<00:06:17.949> it<00:06:17.979> up<00:06:18.219> to<00:06:18.999> 1.1<00:06:19.599> 5<00:06:19.990> gigahertz<00:06:20.349> and

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:20.769 
drag it up to 1.1 5 gigahertz and

00:06:20.769 --> 00:06:23.999 
drag it up to 1.1 5 gigahertz and
supposedly<00:06:21.610> it<00:06:21.999> is<00:06:22.629> more<00:06:22.929> stable<00:06:23.259> I<00:06:23.589> also

00:06:23.999 --> 00:06:24.009 
supposedly it is more stable I also

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:25.739 
supposedly it is more stable I also
heard<00:06:24.249> as<00:06:24.429> better<00:06:24.669> battery<00:06:24.999> life<00:06:25.029> like<00:06:25.389> I<00:06:25.509> said

00:06:25.739 --> 00:06:25.749 
heard as better battery life like I said

00:06:25.749 --> 00:06:26.909 
heard as better battery life like I said
it's<00:06:25.899> going<00:06:26.050> to<00:06:26.110> be<00:06:26.229> difficult<00:06:26.379> to<00:06:26.679> show<00:06:26.860> you

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:26.919 
it's going to be difficult to show you

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:31.350 
it's going to be difficult to show you
that<00:06:27.159> until<00:06:28.059> um<00:06:29.189> until<00:06:30.189> my<00:06:30.550> I<00:06:30.819> can<00:06:31.089> do<00:06:31.209> a<00:06:31.240> full

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:31.360 
that until um until my I can do a full

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.109 
that until um until my I can do a full
analysis<00:06:32.080> of<00:06:32.229> this<00:06:32.349> colonel<00:06:32.769> but<00:06:33.429> i<00:06:33.459> will<00:06:33.969> do

00:06:34.109 --> 00:06:34.119 
analysis of this colonel but i will do

00:06:34.119 --> 00:06:35.909 
analysis of this colonel but i will do
that<00:06:34.269> but<00:06:34.749> just<00:06:34.959> for<00:06:35.019> the<00:06:35.289> sake<00:06:35.499> of<00:06:35.559> this<00:06:35.740> video

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:39.459 
be more stable if you have it you've
