in<00:00:03.810> this<00:00:04.050> video<00:00:04.319> we're<00:00:04.590> going<00:00:04.800> to<00:00:04.950> find

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:05.340 
in this video we're going to find

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.949 
in this video we're going to find
different<00:00:06.299> or<00:00:07.250> equivalent<00:00:08.600> rational<00:00:09.600> numbers

00:00:09.949 --> 00:00:09.959 
different or equivalent rational numbers

00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:12.379 
different or equivalent rational numbers
with<00:00:10.200> different<00:00:10.710> denominators<00:00:11.090> and<00:00:12.090> just<00:00:12.300> a

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
with different denominators and just a

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.150 
with different denominators and just a
quick<00:00:12.660> idea<00:00:12.840> or<00:00:13.230> remind<00:00:13.620> what<00:00:13.799> rational

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
quick idea or remind what rational

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.100 
quick idea or remind what rational
numbers<00:00:14.670> were<00:00:14.820> then<00:00:15.599> we<00:00:15.719> start<00:00:15.990> with<00:00:16.080> our

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:16.110 
numbers were then we start with our

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.019 
numbers were then we start with our
natural<00:00:16.380> numbers<00:00:16.920> went<00:00:17.730> through<00:00:17.880> our<00:00:18.000> whole

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
natural numbers went through our whole

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.060 
natural numbers went through our whole
numbers<00:00:18.540> then<00:00:19.500> we<00:00:19.770> went<00:00:19.919> to<00:00:20.070> set<00:00:20.939> of<00:00:21.060> integers

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:22.070 
numbers then we went to set of integers

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.200 
numbers then we went to set of integers
next<00:00:23.070> thing<00:00:23.160> we<00:00:23.250> need<00:00:23.399> to<00:00:23.430> consider<00:00:23.579> is<00:00:24.000> what

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
next thing we need to consider is what

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.749 
next thing we need to consider is what
are<00:00:24.300> called<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:24.599> rational<00:00:24.930> numbers<00:00:25.649> now<00:00:26.579> we're

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:26.759 
are called a rational numbers now we're

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:30.940 
are called a rational numbers now we're
going<00:00:26.880> to<00:00:26.939> allow<00:00:27.210> for<00:00:27.239> things<00:00:27.750> like<00:00:28.079> a<00:00:29.450> over<00:00:30.450> B

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:30.950 
going to allow for things like a over B

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:35.450 
going to allow for things like a over B
so<00:00:31.950> a<00:00:31.980> rational<00:00:32.520> number<00:00:33.510> is<00:00:33.780> any<00:00:34.170> number<00:00:34.950> that

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
so a rational number is any number that

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.930 
so a rational number is any number that
can<00:00:35.790> that<00:00:36.300> can<00:00:36.360> be<00:00:37.080> expressed<00:00:37.560> as<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:38.610> over<00:00:39.090> B

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
can that can be expressed as a over B

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.900 
can that can be expressed as a over B
this<00:00:41.940> allows<00:00:42.390> us<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.660> have<00:00:42.950> 6<00:00:43.950> be<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.310> rational

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
this allows us to have 6 be a rational

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.370 
this allows us to have 6 be a rational
number<00:00:44.970> because<00:00:45.180> 6<00:00:45.870> is<00:00:46.700> 6<00:00:47.700> over<00:00:47.910> 1<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:48.990> and

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:49.380 
number because 6 is 6 over 1 the a and

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.300 
number because 6 is 6 over 1 the a and
the<00:00:49.470> B<00:00:49.500> must<00:00:50.460> be<00:00:50.730> integers<00:00:51.590> so<00:00:52.590> 6<00:00:53.040> is<00:00:53.280> a

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:53.310 
the B must be integers so 6 is a

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:58.760 
the B must be integers so 6 is a
rational<00:00:53.790> number<00:00:54.440> even<00:00:56.329> 0.333<00:00:57.590> would<00:00:58.590> be

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
rational number even 0.333 would be

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.319 
rational number even 0.333 would be
considered<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.280> rational<00:00:59.760> number<00:00:59.790> because<00:01:00.210> I

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
considered a rational number because I

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.950 
considered a rational number because I
can<00:01:00.690> make<00:01:00.899> that<00:01:00.960> B<00:01:01.560> 1<00:01:02.489> integer<00:01:02.880> over<00:01:03.870> other

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
can make that B 1 integer over other

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.730 
can make that B 1 integer over other
this<00:01:04.530> is<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.829> fraction<00:01:05.840> one-third<00:01:06.840> so

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
this is the fraction one-third so

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.790 
this is the fraction one-third so
rational<00:01:08.340> numbers<00:01:08.880> need<00:01:09.120> to<00:01:09.150> be<00:01:09.650> included<00:01:10.650> in

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:10.800 
rational numbers need to be included in

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.670 
rational numbers need to be included in
our<00:01:10.920> number<00:01:11.490> system<00:01:11.909> in<00:01:12.900> order<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.320> get<00:01:13.470> some

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
our number system in order to get some

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.890 
our number system in order to get some
more<00:01:13.860> things<00:01:13.920> to<00:01:14.340> happen<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:14.909> you'll<00:01:15.600> find

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
more things to happen and you'll find

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.480 
more things to happen and you'll find
that<00:01:16.020> rational<00:01:16.650> numbers<00:01:16.890> are<00:01:16.920> not<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.190> end<00:01:17.370> of

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
that rational numbers are not the end of

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.640 
that rational numbers are not the end of
our<00:01:17.580> system<00:01:17.970> but<00:01:18.810> if<00:01:18.930> I<00:01:19.020> have<00:01:19.200> a<00:01:19.229> fraction

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
our system but if I have a fraction

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.010 
our system but if I have a fraction
let's<00:01:20.100> say<00:01:20.370> a<00:01:20.580> rational<00:01:21.210> number<00:01:21.470> that<00:01:22.470> is<00:01:24.020> 3/5

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
let's say a rational number that is 3/5

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.700 
let's say a rational number that is 3/5
and<00:01:25.250> I'd<00:01:26.250> like<00:01:26.520> to<00:01:26.670> have<00:01:26.790> a<00:01:26.820> different

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
and I'd like to have a different

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.550 
and I'd like to have a different
rational<00:01:28.710> number<00:01:28.890> with<00:01:29.040> a<00:01:29.070> denominator<00:01:29.850> of<00:01:30.560> 20

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
rational number with a denominator of 20

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.420 
rational number with a denominator of 20
how<00:01:32.280> do<00:01:32.340> I<00:01:32.490> find<00:01:33.060> it<00:01:33.240> well<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.409> only<00:01:34.920> that<00:01:35.280> can
