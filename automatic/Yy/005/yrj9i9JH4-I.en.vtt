please<00:00:53.239> for<00:00:54.239> instance<00:00:54.629> we<00:00:54.870> know<00:00:55.050> that<00:00:55.079> dogs

say they evolved from wolves but a new

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.189 
say they evolved from wolves but a new
study<00:01:02.010> suggests<00:01:02.340> that<00:01:02.730> dogs<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.510> grey<00:01:03.809> wolves

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199
