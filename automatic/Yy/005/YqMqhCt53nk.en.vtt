our skinny where we're going to be
taking<00:00:10.200> a<00:00:10.290> detailed<00:00:10.710> look<00:00:10.920> at<00:00:11.040> the<00:00:11.190> backward

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
taking a detailed look at the backward

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.820 
taking a detailed look at the backward
crossovers<00:00:12.240> and<00:00:12.270> all<00:00:12.600> of<00:00:12.720> its<00:00:12.900> techniques<00:00:13.470> and

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
crossovers and all of its techniques and

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.580 
crossovers and all of its techniques and
the<00:00:14.820> first<00:00:15.210> thing<00:00:15.420> you<00:00:15.540> want<00:00:15.720> to<00:00:15.780> show<00:00:15.990> you<00:00:16.049> is

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
the first thing you want to show you is

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.010 
the first thing you want to show you is
balance<00:00:17.369> when<00:00:18.000> you're<00:00:18.090> doing<00:00:18.480> backward

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
balance when you're doing backward

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.140 
balance when you're doing backward
crossovers<00:00:19.740> it's<00:00:20.039> really<00:00:20.520> important<00:00:21.000> that

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
crossovers it's really important that

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.180 
crossovers it's really important that
you<00:00:21.270> have<00:00:21.539> your<00:00:21.750> shoulders<00:00:22.260> level<00:00:22.650> to<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.039> ice

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:23.190 
you have your shoulders level to the ice

you have your shoulders level to the ice
what<00:00:23.820> we're<00:00:24.060> doing<00:00:24.300> is<00:00:24.449> we're<00:00:24.600> drawing<00:00:24.780> a

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
what we're doing is we're drawing a

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.560 
what we're doing is we're drawing a
horizontal<00:00:25.650> line<00:00:26.160> right<00:00:26.460> here<00:00:26.730> showing<00:00:27.480> you

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
horizontal line right here showing you

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.420 
horizontal line right here showing you
that<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.199> shoulders<00:00:28.590> are<00:00:28.740> flat<00:00:28.980> they're

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:29.430 
that the the shoulders are flat they're

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.640 
that the the shoulders are flat they're
their<00:00:29.730> level<00:00:30.119> with<00:00:30.270> the<00:00:30.390> ice<00:00:30.510> there's<00:00:31.230> no

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
their level with the ice there's no

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.490 
their level with the ice there's no
leaning<00:00:32.369> at<00:00:32.579> all<00:00:32.879> and<00:00:33.180> you<00:00:33.989> want<00:00:34.260> to<00:00:34.350> make<00:00:34.469> sure

leaning another thing is is when you do
the<00:00:39.030> pushes<00:00:39.539> you<00:00:40.050> can<00:00:40.229> draw<00:00:40.469> a<00:00:40.499> straight<00:00:40.920> line

00:00:40.939 --> 00:00:40.949 
the pushes you can draw a straight line

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:42.680 
the pushes you can draw a straight line
this<00:00:41.460> is<00:00:41.609> showing<00:00:41.879> that<00:00:41.999> the<00:00:42.329> skate<00:00:42.659> is

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
this is showing that the skate is

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.349 
this is showing that the skate is
underneath<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.559> body<00:00:43.769> basically<00:00:44.460> showing

lines showing you the skate is under the

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.430 
lines showing you the skate is under the
body<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:56.359> now<00:00:57.359> when<00:00:57.659> we<00:00:57.780> do<00:00:57.989> backward

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
body and now when we do backward

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.770 
body and now when we do backward
crossovers<00:00:59.010> there<00:00:59.219> are<00:00:59.429> two<00:00:59.729> pushes<00:01:00.030> the

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
crossovers there are two pushes the

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.410 
crossovers there are two pushes the
first<00:01:01.109> pushes<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.739> c-cut<00:01:02.339> and<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.059> second

designed to help people remember to get
that<00:01:46.500> C<00:01:46.740> cut<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.100> all<00:01:47.250> you're<00:01:47.460> doing<00:01:47.760> is

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
that C cut and all you're doing is

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.240 
that C cut and all you're doing is
pushing<00:01:48.180> with<00:01:48.510> the<00:01:48.570> outside<00:01:49.020> leg<00:01:49.320> all<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.590> way

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
pushing with the outside leg all the way

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.250 
pushing with the outside leg all the way
around<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.640> circle<00:01:51.030> so<00:01:51.210> how<00:01:51.630> you<00:01:51.690> do<00:01:51.900> this<00:01:52.050> is

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:52.260 
around the circle so how you do this is

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.260 
around the circle so how you do this is
you<00:01:52.380> start<00:01:52.740> with<00:01:52.920> your<00:01:53.010> feet<00:01:53.190> together<00:01:53.370> you

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
you start with your feet together you

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.300 
you start with your feet together you
push<00:01:54.630> until<00:01:54.870> your<00:01:55.170> leg<00:01:55.350> is<00:01:55.530> locked<00:01:55.860> out<00:01:56.100> at

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
push until your leg is locked out at

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.010 
push until your leg is locked out at
full<00:01:56.520> extension<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:59.510> then<00:02:00.510> you<00:02:00.659> bring<00:02:00.960> your

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
full extension and then you bring your

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.899 
full extension and then you bring your
feet<00:02:01.320> all<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.560> way<00:02:01.800> back<00:02:02.070> together<00:02:02.310> until

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
feet all the way back together until

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:09.649 
feet all the way back together until
they're<00:02:03.870> under<00:02:04.320> your<00:02:04.350> body<00:02:05.990> the<00:02:06.990> return<00:02:08.659> okay

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:09.659 
they're under your body the return okay

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:11.869 
they're under your body the return okay
and<00:02:09.869> showing<00:02:10.530> you<00:02:10.619> this<00:02:10.769> again<00:02:11.069> all<00:02:11.310> you're

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
and showing you this again all you're

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.459 
and showing you this again all you're
doing<00:02:12.090> is<00:02:12.209> pushing<00:02:12.450> with<00:02:12.689> that<00:02:12.810> outside<00:02:13.230> leg

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:13.469 
doing is pushing with that outside leg

00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:15.830 
doing is pushing with that outside leg
you<00:02:13.680> want<00:02:13.769> to<00:02:13.920> master<00:02:14.400> that<00:02:14.430> C<00:02:14.879> cut<00:02:15.150> and<00:02:15.359> then

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
you want to master that C cut and then

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:16.820 
you want to master that C cut and then
once<00:02:16.109> you<00:02:16.230> get<00:02:16.349> the<00:02:16.409> seek

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
once you get the seek

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.590 
once you get the seek
down<00:02:17.040> then<00:02:17.400> go<00:02:17.640> into<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:17.970> full<00:02:18.180> backward

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
down then go into the full backward

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.520 
down then go into the full backward
crossovers<00:02:19.290> and<00:02:19.610> get<00:02:20.610> the<00:02:21.000> the<00:02:21.320> rest<00:02:22.320> of<00:02:22.440> the

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
backward crossovers again you showing

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.720 
backward crossovers again you showing
the<00:02:29.790> c-cut<00:02:30.300> and<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:31.050> second<00:02:31.440> push<00:02:31.710> is<00:02:31.950> the<00:02:32.340> ex

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
the c-cut and the second push is the ex

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.160 
the c-cut and the second push is the ex
push<00:02:33.090> and<00:02:33.270> that's<00:02:33.390> a<00:02:33.510> push<00:02:33.690> we're<00:02:33.870> gonna<00:02:33.960> look

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
push and that's a push we're gonna look

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.860 
push and that's a push we're gonna look
at<00:02:34.350> right<00:02:34.590> now<00:02:35.660> okay

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
at right now okay

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.910 
at right now okay
the<00:02:37.530> X<00:02:37.710> push<00:02:38.040> is<00:02:38.930> driven<00:02:39.930> all<00:02:40.260> the<00:02:40.530> way<00:02:40.650> to<00:02:40.710> the

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
the X push is driven all the way to the

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.340 
the X push is driven all the way to the
outside<00:02:41.520> you<00:02:42.150> really<00:02:42.570> gotta<00:02:42.720> cross<00:02:43.050> those

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
outside you really gotta cross those

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.410 
outside you really gotta cross those
legs<00:02:43.650> over<00:02:43.980> bend<00:02:44.340> your<00:02:44.490> knees<00:02:44.670> and<00:02:44.880> extend

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
legs over bend your knees and extend

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.120 
legs over bend your knees and extend
that<00:02:45.540> push<00:02:45.870> out<00:02:46.110> you<00:02:46.350> can<00:02:46.500> see<00:02:46.650> why<00:02:46.770> we<00:02:46.920> call<00:02:47.070> it

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
that push out you can see why we call it

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.280 
that push out you can see why we call it
the<00:02:47.280> X<00:02:47.430> push<00:02:47.670> by<00:02:47.850> the<00:02:47.910> way<00:02:48.150> both<00:02:48.450> legs<00:02:48.750> crossing

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
the X push by the way both legs crossing

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.800 
the X push by the way both legs crossing
over<00:02:49.410> it<00:02:49.620> draws<00:02:49.830> an<00:02:49.980> X<00:02:50.190> and<00:02:50.480> again<00:02:51.480> the<00:02:51.630> blue

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
over it draws an X and again the blue

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.570 
over it draws an X and again the blue
line<00:02:51.990> is<00:02:52.170> showing<00:02:52.200> you<00:02:52.680> that<00:02:52.860> you<00:02:52.920> are<00:02:53.160> really

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
line is showing you that you are really

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.330 
line is showing you that you are really
stretching<00:02:54.210> that<00:02:54.360> leg<00:02:54.660> out<00:02:54.870> and<00:02:55.280> something<00:02:56.280> a

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
stretching that leg out and something a

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.940 
stretching that leg out and something a
little<00:02:56.580> bit<00:02:56.700> more<00:02:57.030> on<00:02:57.209> the<00:02:57.330> X<00:02:57.510> bush<00:02:57.840> is<00:02:58.020> there's

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
little bit more on the X bush is there's

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.560 
little bit more on the X bush is there's
a<00:02:59.010> little<00:02:59.310> bit<00:02:59.430> more<00:02:59.459> technique<00:03:00.120> we<00:03:00.300> want<00:03:00.480> to

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
a little bit more technique we want to

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.390 
a little bit more technique we want to
show<00:03:00.750> you<00:03:00.810> when<00:03:01.110> you<00:03:01.200> do<00:03:01.350> it<00:03:01.440> at<00:03:01.560> full<00:03:01.890> speed<00:03:02.220> so

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
show you when you do it at full speed so

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.710 
show you when you do it at full speed so
we're<00:03:02.520> going<00:03:02.610> to<00:03:02.700> take<00:03:02.910> a<00:03:02.940> look<00:03:03.209> at<00:03:03.360> the

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
we're going to take a look at the

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.770 
we're going to take a look at the
crossovers<00:03:04.350> now<00:03:04.530> done<00:03:05.310> at<00:03:05.459> full<00:03:05.760> speed<00:03:06.120> and

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
crossovers now done at full speed and

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.840 
crossovers now done at full speed and
what<00:03:06.930> we<00:03:07.050> want<00:03:07.260> to<00:03:07.320> focus<00:03:07.560> on<00:03:07.980> is<00:03:08.250> what<00:03:08.610> the

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
what we want to focus on is what the

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.270 
what we want to focus on is what the
inside<00:03:09.450> leg<00:03:09.750> is<00:03:09.900> doing<00:03:10.320> during<00:03:10.740> these

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
inside leg is doing during these

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.199 
inside leg is doing during these
crossovers

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
crossovers

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.810 
crossovers
notice<00:03:13.080> how<00:03:13.170> the<00:03:13.230> inside<00:03:13.800> leg<00:03:14.040> is<00:03:14.190> reaching

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
notice how the inside leg is reaching

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.730 
notice how the inside leg is reaching
into<00:03:15.150> the<00:03:15.270> circle<00:03:15.720> this<00:03:15.810> is<00:03:15.990> a<00:03:16.020> little<00:03:16.530> bit<00:03:16.650> of

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:16.740 
into the circle this is a little bit of

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:18.440 
into the circle this is a little bit of
an<00:03:16.860> advanced<00:03:17.310> technique<00:03:17.340> it's<00:03:18.060> gonna<00:03:18.240> help

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
an advanced technique it's gonna help

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.290 
an advanced technique it's gonna help
you<00:03:18.600> get<00:03:18.720> a<00:03:18.780> bit<00:03:19.170> more<00:03:19.320> power<00:03:19.970> again<00:03:20.970> here<00:03:21.180> you

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 
you get a bit more power again here you

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:22.940 
you get a bit more power again here you
can<00:03:21.420> see<00:03:21.630> both<00:03:21.780> of<00:03:21.930> the<00:03:22.170> blue<00:03:22.350> lines<00:03:22.590> meaning

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
can see both of the blue lines meaning

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.740 
can see both of the blue lines meaning
both<00:03:23.220> legs<00:03:23.610> are<00:03:23.790> extended<00:03:24.030> you're<00:03:24.390> actually

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
both legs are extended you're actually

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.330 
both legs are extended you're actually
reaching<00:03:25.019> into<00:03:25.440> the<00:03:25.530> circle<00:03:25.890> as<00:03:25.950> far<00:03:26.220> as

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
reaching into the circle as far as

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.880 
reaching into the circle as far as
possible<00:03:26.550> and<00:03:27.060> the<00:03:27.540> red<00:03:27.720> lines<00:03:27.989> indicating

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
possible and the red lines indicating

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.610 
possible and the red lines indicating
the<00:03:29.459> the<00:03:29.850> pushes<00:03:30.300> what<00:03:30.930> you<00:03:31.050> do<00:03:31.200> is<00:03:31.350> when<00:03:31.500> you

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
the the pushes what you do is when you

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.380 
the the pushes what you do is when you
do<00:03:31.830> this<00:03:32.070> you<00:03:32.340> actually<00:03:32.519> get<00:03:32.910> sort<00:03:33.209> of<00:03:33.269> a

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
do this you actually get sort of a

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.430 
do this you actually get sort of a
scissor<00:03:33.780> push<00:03:34.590> you<00:03:35.190> get<00:03:35.340> up<00:03:35.550> both<00:03:35.970> legs

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
scissor push you get up both legs

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.810 
scissor push you get up both legs
pushing<00:03:37.440> like<00:03:37.590> one<00:03:37.860> leg<00:03:38.040> pushing<00:03:38.459> one<00:03:38.640> leg

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
pushing like one leg pushing one leg

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.610 
pushing like one leg pushing one leg
pulling<00:03:39.150> so<00:03:39.450> you<00:03:39.540> get<00:03:39.690> a<00:03:39.720> little<00:03:40.140> bit<00:03:40.230> of<00:03:40.350> extra

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
pulling so you get a little bit of extra

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.000 
pulling so you get a little bit of extra
power<00:03:40.890> that<00:03:41.220> way<00:03:41.430> and<00:03:42.140> both<00:03:43.140> legs<00:03:43.500> end<00:03:43.830> up

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
power that way and both legs end up

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.979 
power that way and both legs end up
working<00:03:44.220> on<00:03:44.489> the<00:03:44.550> push<00:03:44.850> an<00:03:45.390> important<00:03:45.870> thing

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
working on the push an important thing

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:48.440 
working on the push an important thing
to<00:03:46.170> note<00:03:46.410> here<00:03:46.680> is<00:03:46.739> as<00:03:47.220> you<00:03:47.640> do<00:03:47.790> this<00:03:48.000> push<00:03:48.269> you

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
to note here is as you do this push you

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.120 
to note here is as you do this push you
have<00:03:48.690> to<00:03:48.840> keep<00:03:49.019> your<00:03:49.170> skate<00:03:49.500> load<00:03:49.739> of<00:03:49.890> the<00:03:49.980> ice

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
have to keep your skate load of the ice

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:51.640 
have to keep your skate load of the ice
you<00:03:50.370> want<00:03:50.550> to<00:03:50.610> be<00:03:50.730> as<00:03:50.820> efficient<00:03:51.390> as<00:03:51.510> possible

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
you want to be as efficient as possible

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.350 
you want to be as efficient as possible
keep<00:03:52.650> that<00:03:52.830> skate<00:03:53.160> load<00:03:53.430> the<00:03:53.640> ice<00:03:53.730> as<00:03:53.970> you're

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
keep that skate load the ice as you're

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.360 
keep that skate load the ice as you're
reaching<00:03:54.600> in<00:03:54.930> and<00:03:55.110> again<00:03:55.290> you<00:03:55.440> can<00:03:55.590> see<00:03:55.860> the

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
reaching in and again you can see the

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.790 
reaching in and again you can see the
full<00:03:56.700> extension<00:03:57.420> region<00:03:58.019> right<00:03:58.260> here<00:03:58.290> and

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
full extension region right here and

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.190 
full extension region right here and
then<00:03:59.610> after<00:04:00.239> you<00:04:00.330> reach<00:04:00.540> and<00:04:00.750> you<00:04:00.840> go<00:04:00.959> to<00:04:01.019> do

then after you reach and you go to do
that<00:04:01.350> X<00:04:01.530> push<00:04:01.800> the<00:04:02.340> X<00:04:02.489> push<00:04:02.760> again<00:04:03.269> is<00:04:03.450> the<00:04:03.900> same

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
that X push the X push again is the same

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.979 
that X push the X push again is the same
push<00:04:04.739> alright<00:04:05.610> it<00:04:05.790> looks<00:04:05.820> exactly<00:04:06.150> the<00:04:06.750> same

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
push alright it looks exactly the same

push alright it looks exactly the same
here<00:04:07.260> done<00:04:07.470> at<00:04:07.590> full<00:04:07.860> speed<00:04:08.160> as<00:04:08.400> it<00:04:08.610> does<00:04:08.870> at

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
here done at full speed as it does at

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.930 
here done at full speed as it does at
slower<00:04:10.290> speeds<00:04:10.430> so<00:04:11.430> we're<00:04:11.550> gonna<00:04:11.640> play

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
slower speeds so we're gonna play

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.060 
slower speeds so we're gonna play
through<00:04:12.180> this<00:04:12.360> again<00:04:12.690> one<00:04:12.989> more<00:04:13.170> time<00:04:13.230> at<00:04:13.799> full

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070 
through this again one more time at full

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:16.099 
through this again one more time at full
speed<00:04:14.370> just<00:04:14.730> to<00:04:14.940> show<00:04:15.150> you<00:04:15.209> how<00:04:15.510> much<00:04:15.690> speed

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
speed just to show you how much speed

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:17.870 
speed just to show you how much speed
this<00:04:16.320> generates<00:04:16.950> with<00:04:17.190> all<00:04:17.370> the<00:04:17.489> technique

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
this generates with all the technique

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.489 
this generates with all the technique
involved<00:04:18.979> thank<00:04:19.979> you<00:04:20.130> and<00:04:20.310> from
