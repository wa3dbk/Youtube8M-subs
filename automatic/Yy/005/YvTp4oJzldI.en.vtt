00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:07.420
 how to increase hard disk space for 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:10.300
 There is one convenient account for another disk. 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.839
 the program is called acronis disk 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.820
 director 

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:14.769
 on my desk tion it allows 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.960
 increase hard disk space 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:18.880
 without losing data, but as we know 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.400
 the windows built-in functions of this are not 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.769
 allows and so let's consider everything 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.960
 on a real example before zooming 

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:28.449
 the volume of one hard disk need this 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.939
 I suggest to take away the volume of someone 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:32.770
 take a place from the disk click on it 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:35.440
 right-click and select the item to change 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:38.460
 volume size comprising dimensions I suggest 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.930
 leave him well, let's say 60 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.110
 choose how much should stay and click 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:47.040
 ok we have a button to apply 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:50.140
 waiting for surgery we need to press it and 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:53.580
 confirm by clicking continue waiting 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.960
 some time while fixing 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:58.240
 fine here I got unallocated 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.370
 space that is this place i can 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.900
 add absolutely to any pussy i 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.000
 I want to expand disk d 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:07.570
 select item by right-click 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.229
 I managed to change the size of the atom 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.909
 add unallocated space to that and 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.439
 expanding to the end 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.829
 so all unallocated space 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:21.719
 will be added to this disc 

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:23.890
 click ok to apply pending operations and 

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:26.259
 here, unfortunately, you need to restart 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.270
 computer so i put the record 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:30.659
 a lesson to pause after reboot and 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.659
 will be back 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.159
 and so my computer rebooted and 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.540
 let's look at the result go in 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:43.530
 section of the computer and look yes drive d 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:45.630
 increased 730 food 770 means everything 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.850
 worked recommend this program for 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.150
 changes in hard disk size due to 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.220
 Other I hope you get the general scheme 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.930
 that is, we take away the first from the other 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.300
 disk some gigabytes 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.090
 second we get unallocated 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.460
 space and third we add it 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.070
 unallocated space sees say 10 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.530
 20 or 30 megabytes in another moody's in 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.269
 in my case I added disk d if you 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.100
 use some other ways for 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:12.269
 increase the hard drive then ask 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:16.130
 write in comments 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:16.130
 on this i have all thanks for watching
