00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.080
 in women and tube wanted that commenting 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.879
 me if a battlefield 4 gameplay is a 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.319
 commented employment is not a like 6 that the 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.730
 Sundays or his kind of games and 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.070
 good is the one that came out the most voted in the 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.690
 survey the last one I did since this 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.730
 it's not a whole game I've 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.650
 cut into a couple of pieces 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.570
 basically the first part of the 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.160
 gameplay and I left the final part 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.260
 of the play is still a game 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.519
 Well, you see about seven and a half 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.250
 minutillos the truth that is quite 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.300
 cool and word is not going uncle I am 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.009
 seeing the level and everything that I already have 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.150
 you will see later then I think that at level 3 or 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:32.640
 well or level 2 the truth is pretty 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.290
 new tillo because I'm defending little 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.320
 I'm playing in Play 4 and I 'm 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.670
 I'm asking and this is good as 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.230
 I say little by little I'm catching level 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.880
 weapons also just unlocked the 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.920
 scale hy I think I think the 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.930
 eca this is what some assignment and such 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.980
 that makes it go a little bit better but 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.300
 You already know that I am a newbie in topics 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.320
 innovation accessories theme mules 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.730
 toilet row so good I'm going 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.830
 defending with what I have little by little 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.970
 go playing and such although good I do not have 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.110
 much loss of it by the battle 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.250
 fine game and occasionally to throw 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.380
 some game and well, it did not work 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.030
 this game the guard and it comes to me 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.980
 hair to prove what he is saying 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.790
 title also that is the new quality 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.769
 what's on youtube 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.450
 these two last three days are 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.119
 trying a new quality that is 7 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.500
 ep 60 frames per second that does 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.450
 that the videos were much more fluid 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.130
 but it is not the maximum resolution that 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.479
 You can put this on YouTube if it's the 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:20.280
 maximum resolution of 80 thousand 80 60 p and 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.570
 this is good because of what he told me 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.340
 someone on twitter exactly this 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.539
 good this games on pc four times 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.720
 I'm sweating I have not told you before 

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:29.100
 then in pc 4 and not always c4 the 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.689
 battlefield reaches 1080 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.000
 exactly resolution but good 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.939
 it is clear that more than 720 yes so 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.229
 good what it is was to record in the maximum 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.360
 reduction that the captor of the 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.830
 cat 60 frames 1080 and this is the 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.789
 result here you have kids the truth 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.049
 that looks very good 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:44.729
 you are noticing that apart from the 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.950
 resolution itself of how well it is 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.270
 you see super fluid does not and that's because 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.369
 to the frames before youtube you 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.770
 limited videos to 30 frames per 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.179
 second although you raise it to 60 to 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.829
 youtube gives you just put Toriba 30 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:58.159
 then right now if you rendering 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.030
 the video at 60 youtube allows you 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:02.099
 play it at 60 frames per second 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.390
 with which basically the video is 

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:05.369
 see the double fluid not the turns of 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.679
 camera are much softer when it comes to 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.000
 aim is not much smoother the 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:11.790
 Unique movements are also much more 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.050
 soft of everything much more defined and then 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.910
 many of you thank you 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.940
 good this video evidently to be 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.410
 1080 60 fps and although it is short weighs 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.180
 very much the truth to raise this 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.830
 every day so good as you 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.760
 I said in warfare, my idea is to continue 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:29.090
 doing it in 720 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.530
 to a 720 solution and 60 frames per 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.019
 second, it's hard for me to render 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.959
 a little more I have a good computer but I 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:38.659
 you can watch the videos per day in 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:41.150
 the two uefa that is my goal not so 

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:42.680
 I can if we can keep it then what 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.970
 that many of you will be thinking and what I 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.500
 you will be asking the comments 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.000
 or that please 10 what's the direct 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.220
 tomorrow you have not said anything about him 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.780
 Please, I 'm good because tomorrow was coming 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.720
 a direct addition warfare is supposed to 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.489
 starting tomorrow at 9 am 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.319
 Spanish schedule evidently so 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:58.549
 can upload videos and stream 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:00.650
 charge pieces warfare so me tomorrow 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:02.299
 in the morning I have an exam with which 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.459
 Well, when the house comes , it's 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:05.659
 playing a little bit and such and then I'll be 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:08.180
 prepared everything for the streaming that 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:09.950
 will begin at 4 pm again 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.900
 repeat Spanish ossuary then those that 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.840
 I am from Latin America and you are that of 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.340
 venezuela from ecuador from colombia as 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.590
 you have different time slots 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.239
 I really do not know exactly what fringe 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.829
 you are with which I am going to leave you one 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:23.269
 Internet page in the description that 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:24.530
 it comes exactly all the schedules with 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:26.120
 the slots for you to do the 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.109
 calculation you or what are you 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.549
 doing is simply the page 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:31.220
 open and when in Spain mark the 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:32.520
 four in the afternoon at 4 p.m. 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.020
 to the channel and there I will be 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.000
 then the direct one will be in 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.350
 beginning of about 6 7 hours I will be 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.060
 playing until ten o'clock at night eleven 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.710
 at night I know there are many of you who have 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.970
 classes but well that's no proof 

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:43.770
 because it has them and it's going to be summarized 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.090
 say you do not have to see it whole if 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:47.670
 you're not going to be a bad ups 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:50.730
 would miss less but good would be missing more 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:52.020
 better said but you can see it summarized 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.940
 I will also do it in several pieces 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.500
 because youtube I think it has some 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.600
 problem that sounds to me and I'm going to 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.520
 do so just in case with streaming 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.750
 that are more than 34 hours have some 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.550
 problem so what I'm going to do for 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.710
 have a little margin when the 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.030
 two hours of direct I'll cut and go back to 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:08.370
 do another direct is to say it divides it into 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.620
 three four parts the direct one and then 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.360
 You will have about 34 videos of about two 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.910
 Good hours of two hours or more better 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.920
 said for good if just playing 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.120
 the jce with my friends 2.0 is also going to 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.320
 be the direct with what time to see me 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.239
 I take my time with the camera with the 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.920
 warfare house and I recommend you 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.330
 that not that if you can see what you are 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.640
 a ratillo that according to assured is 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.410
 playing of while and such and good then 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.060
 the direct one I do not know if how can be done 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.410
 60 frames or not I will be looking 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.889
 now in the afternoon a little action some 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.259
 test 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:36.430
 in principle it will be to 7 20 30 

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:39.249
 frames per second I do not expect it to be 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:40.539
 the best possible and so then relationship 

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:42.159
 of this with the quality you have 

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:44.590
 some of you have computers 

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:46.330
 that are a bit bad or connections that 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:48.279
 they give us too good and you tell me 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.960
 the videos of 20 60 frames is fine 

00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:51.219
 a little bit do it two then good at 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.740
 first the requirement to see the 

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:56.080
 videos to this resolution is that you have 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.999
 google chrome or safari browser 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.379
 in and you're worth those two the only 

00:04:57.999 --> 00:05:00.879
 browsers that we do you can see 

00:04:59.379 --> 00:05:03.430
 this resolution in the application of 

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:05.560
 youtube both from iphone and from as of 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.840
 android samsung and such really not 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.939
 I have no idea if it is possible 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.009
 do not pay much attention to me, but what 

00:05:09.939 --> 00:05:13.569
 sure is that in chrome and in and in 

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:15.610
 firefox in firefox that do not forgive 

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:17.409
 chrome and on a safari yes you can 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:19.300
 many doctors is firefox and you can not 

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:21.069
 see well we're going to pull those stickers by 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.900
 our pc but well I already said it or 

00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:25.930
 be I am going to do what the majority 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:27.370
 it does not come better, and it really is a 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:29.050
 video people to frames per second already 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:30.789
 720 which is how it is best to be seen and how 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:32.289
 more you will enjoy it if you can not 

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:34.330
 whatever you have more qualities 3 the 

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:36.460
 480 so it does not look as good as a 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:39.210
 720 but hey you can see the video without 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:41.190
 problems because it's a quality 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:42.300
 is going to put a buffer to start 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:43.740
 load the video all the time and it's not going to 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.630
 dream almost to be able to see it so 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:49.349
 good you have the qualities to choose 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:51.270
 the director to the same will put 720 480 and 360 

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:53.009
 although I do not know if he left me 1080 though 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:55.199
 that will suck me more on the line 

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:56.639
 so surely you do the 720 and 

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:58.830
 good all those kids repeated the 

00:05:56.639 --> 00:06:00.599
 direct will be tomorrow at four o'clock 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:03.180
 the afternoon at 4 pm noria spain 

00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:04.500
 until 10 11 at night it was all 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:06.090
 the playing time divides it into several 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.620
 parts you can see summarized each 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:10.710
 of the parties without problem 

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:12.240
 do not worry and well then that 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:13.470
 also comment anxiety that is 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.970
 finishing the gameplay this series of 

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:17.490
 Sundays surely as well as done 

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:19.289
 with others the square at least 23 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:21.270
 weeks because as a base it will come out of 

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:22.380
 the most beautiful and it will be the novelty 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:23.699
 obviously you should give much more 

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:25.289
 activity to warfare that to this series 

00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:26.880
 on Sundays and that on Sundays in 

00:06:25.289 --> 00:06:28.349
 principle at least this month you're going to 

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.580
 have also more fourth calories worth 

00:06:28.349 --> 00:06:31.500
 you are going to have only in the expiration channel 

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:34.680
 you go warfare and I will try that always 

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:36.240
 are going to be two videos a day 7 20 60 

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:37.500
 frames for it to be a very quality 

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.270
 good and that you can be with the videos 

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:40.470
 so all these kids I hope that 

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:42.479
 you liked the background video and that 

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:44.400
 Enjoy the new quality and I tell you 

00:06:42.479 --> 00:06:45.620
 that I do not think I'll raise it almost never 

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:50.440
 but good 

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:50.440
 I like favorites and separated goodbye
