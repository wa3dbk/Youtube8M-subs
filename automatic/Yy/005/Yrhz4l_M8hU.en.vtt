want to do before I die and I should

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.459 
want to do before I die and I should
only<00:01:00.449> do<00:01:00.570> this<00:01:00.690> before<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.079> end<00:01:01.109> of<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.350> air

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
only do this before the end of the air

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.880 
only do this before the end of the air
screw<00:01:01.739> that's<00:01:01.949> as<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.730> ghost<00:01:02.940> skydiving<00:01:03.629> and

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.429 
screw that's as a ghost skydiving and
for<00:01:04.890> me<00:01:05.010> skydiving<00:01:05.700> isn't<00:01:06.030> that<00:01:06.119> scary<00:01:06.630> as<00:01:07.350> it

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
for me skydiving isn't that scary as it

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.160 
for me skydiving isn't that scary as it
seems<00:01:08.040> cuz<00:01:08.490> there<00:01:09.360> is<00:01:09.390> a<00:01:09.510> big<00:01:09.720> difference<00:01:09.869> in

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
seems cuz there is a big difference in

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.539 
seems cuz there is a big difference in
my<00:01:10.290> mind<00:01:10.560> between<00:01:10.770> jumping<00:01:11.280> out<00:01:11.340> of<00:01:11.400> an

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
my mind between jumping out of an

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.789 
my mind between jumping out of an

airplane which is supposed to happen you

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.080 
airplane which is supposed to happen you
have<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.010> parachute<00:01:14.460> which<00:01:14.610> is<00:01:14.729> supposed<00:01:15.060> to

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
have the parachute which is supposed to

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.570 
have the parachute which is supposed to
protect<00:01:15.299> you<00:01:15.540> as<00:01:15.780> opposed<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:16.710> just<00:01:17.130> leaning

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
protect you as opposed to just leaning

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.730 
protect you as opposed to just leaning
over<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:18.000> balcony<00:01:18.240> rail<00:01:18.659> 15<00:01:19.170> stories<00:01:19.530> in<00:01:19.650> the

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
over a balcony rail 15 stories in the

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.490 
over a balcony rail 15 stories in the

I know that's technically not the
definition<00:02:15.239> of<00:02:15.599> parkour<00:02:15.930> because<00:02:16.140> that's

definition of parkour because that's

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.949

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
things and climb on top of things and

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.830 
things and climb on top of things and
that<00:02:20.340> height<00:02:20.550> doesn't<00:02:20.700> scare<00:02:21.000> me<00:02:21.060> either<00:02:21.180> high

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840

minutes of swallowing saliva I had to

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:36.890 
minutes of swallowing saliva I had to
throw<00:05:35.610> up<00:05:35.850> that<00:05:36.000> saliva<00:05:36.300> because<00:05:36.630> it<00:05:36.720> just

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:36.900 
throw up that saliva because it just

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.160 
throw up that saliva because it just
kept<00:05:37.080> building<00:05:37.200> up<00:05:37.530> and<00:05:37.800> it<00:05:38.700> got<00:05:38.880> to<00:05:39.030> the<00:05:39.170> top

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:40.170 
kept building up and it got to the top

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:41.600 
kept building up and it got to the top
of<00:05:40.290> my<00:05:40.410> mouth<00:05:40.590> again<00:05:40.770> and<00:05:40.890> I<00:05:41.010> to<00:05:41.130> throw<00:05:41.340> that<00:05:41.490> up

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:41.610 
of my mouth again and I to throw that up

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.630 
of my mouth again and I to throw that up

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:44.640 
and after 24 hours I think it eventually

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.300 
and after 24 hours I think it eventually
just<00:05:44.880> like<00:05:45.090> went<00:05:45.390> down<00:05:45.510> my<00:05:45.660> throat<00:05:45.690> but<00:05:46.350> the

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:43.930 
and they do have some methods where I

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:46.650 
and they do have some methods where I
think<00:06:44.800> if<00:06:45.130> if<00:06:45.669> you<00:06:45.789> can't<00:06:46.030> get<00:06:46.180> it<00:06:46.300> out<00:06:46.389> of<00:06:46.419> the

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:46.660 
think if if you can't get it out of the

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:48.180 
think if if you can't get it out of the
throat<00:06:47.050> or<00:06:47.229> whatever<00:06:47.470> then<00:06:47.710> you<00:06:47.770> can<00:06:47.919> take<00:06:48.130> a

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:48.190 
throat or whatever then you can take a

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:51.360 
throat or whatever then you can take a
knife<00:06:48.520> and<00:06:48.759> shove<00:06:49.210> it<00:06:49.300> into<00:06:49.479> their<00:06:50.039> neck<00:06:51.039> or

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:51.370 
knife and shove it into their neck or

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:53.159 
knife and shove it into their neck or
the<00:06:51.669> breathing<00:06:52.330> cord<00:06:52.630> or<00:06:52.750> whatever<00:06:52.960> and

00:06:53.159 --> 00:06:53.169 
the breathing cord or whatever and

00:06:53.169 --> 00:06:54.749 
the breathing cord or whatever and
obviously<00:06:53.560> I<00:06:53.650> would<00:06:53.800> kill<00:06:53.949> myself<00:06:54.280> if<00:06:54.639> I<00:06:54.729> tried
