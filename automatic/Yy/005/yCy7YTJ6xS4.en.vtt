significant<00:00:19.340> in<00:00:19.460> terms<00:00:19.490> of<00:00:19.760> news<00:00:20.060> right<00:00:20.329> now

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:20.509 
significant in terms of news right now

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:22.330 
significant in terms of news right now
in<00:00:20.630> the<00:00:20.720> market<00:00:21.140> so<00:00:21.380> is<00:00:21.500> that<00:00:21.529> going<00:00:21.800> to<00:00:22.009> be<00:00:22.160> the

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:22.340 
in the market so is that going to be the

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.159 
in the market so is that going to be the
catalyst<00:00:22.880> I<00:00:23.000> think<00:00:23.180> the<00:00:23.270> catalyst<00:00:23.720> is<00:00:23.900> still

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:24.169 
catalyst I think the catalyst is still

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:26.859 
catalyst I think the catalyst is still
right<00:00:24.439> now<00:00:24.470> the<00:00:25.220> Greek<00:00:25.759> debt<00:00:26.060> situation<00:00:26.390> I

right now the Greek debt situation I

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:29.080 
right now the Greek debt situation I
mean<00:00:26.989> already<00:00:27.290> it<00:00:27.470> seems<00:00:27.710> like<00:00:27.980> some<00:00:28.970> of<00:00:29.000> that

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.090 
mean already it seems like some of that

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:30.760 
mean already it seems like some of that
information<00:00:29.300> may<00:00:29.930> be<00:00:29.989> getting<00:00:30.200> priced<00:00:30.529> into

way<00:00:37.790> for<00:00:37.870> my<00:00:38.870> further<00:00:39.110> bailout<00:00:39.620> which<00:00:40.190> would

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430 
way for my further bailout which would

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.790 
way for my further bailout which would
be<00:00:40.610> your<00:00:41.000> positive<00:00:41.480> for<00:00:42.110> the<00:00:42.140> euro<00:00:42.500> as

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
be your positive for the euro as

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.010 
be your positive for the euro as
positive<00:00:43.250> for<00:00:43.400> gold<00:00:43.580> as<00:00:43.700> well<00:00:43.850> how<00:00:44.570> long<00:00:44.750> are

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.020 
positive for gold as well how long are

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.600 
positive for gold as well how long are
we<00:00:45.050> still<00:00:45.350> expecting<00:00:45.800> that<00:00:45.890> correlation<00:00:46.490> with

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:46.610 
we still expecting that correlation with

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.190 
we still expecting that correlation with
the<00:00:46.730> arrow<00:00:46.880> to<00:00:46.970> really<00:00:47.360> last<00:00:47.660> because<00:00:48.050> you

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:48.200 
the arrow to really last because you

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.590 
the arrow to really last because you
could<00:00:48.350> argue<00:00:48.440> that<00:00:48.620> longer<00:00:49.370> term<00:00:49.400> the<00:00:50.240> second

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
could argue that longer term the second

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.970 
could argue that longer term the second
bailout<00:00:50.780> isn't<00:00:51.260> going<00:00:51.440> to<00:00:51.530> solve<00:00:51.680> all<00:00:51.890> the

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
bailout isn't going to solve all the

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:53.980 
bailout isn't going to solve all the
problems<00:00:52.400> in<00:00:52.520> Greece<00:00:52.850> I<00:00:53.120> think<00:00:53.900> that's

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:53.990 
problems in Greece I think that's

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:55.330 
problems in Greece I think that's
exactly<00:00:54.170> Ryan<00:00:54.680> is<00:00:54.920> it's<00:00:55.070> a<00:00:55.130> very<00:00:55.310> good

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
exactly Ryan is it's a very good

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.760 
exactly Ryan is it's a very good
question<00:00:55.640> no<00:00:56.420> we've<00:00:56.600> seen<00:00:56.840> that<00:00:56.960> correlations

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:57.770 
question no we've seen that correlations

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.069 
question no we've seen that correlations
oscillate<00:00:58.610> over<00:00:58.910> the<00:00:59.000> last<00:00:59.210> couple<00:00:59.810> of<00:01:00.020> years

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 
oscillate over the last couple of years

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:02.620 
oscillate over the last couple of years
and<00:01:00.560> there<00:01:01.280> are<00:01:01.370> times<00:01:01.640> when<00:01:01.970> it<00:01:02.060> breaks<00:01:02.270> down

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:02.630 
and there are times when it breaks down

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:04.899 
and there are times when it breaks down
and<00:01:02.870> gold<00:01:03.110> trades<00:01:03.530> you<00:01:04.189> know<00:01:04.250> with<00:01:04.519> the<00:01:04.549> risk

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:04.909 
and gold trades you know with the risk

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:06.580 
and gold trades you know with the risk
assets<00:01:05.390> I<00:01:05.509> with<00:01:05.840> the<00:01:05.990> euro<00:01:06.229> and<00:01:06.380> there<00:01:06.500> are

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
assets I with the euro and there are

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.859 
assets I with the euro and there are
times<00:01:06.799> when<00:01:06.979> it<00:01:07.070> doesn't<00:01:07.310> I<00:01:07.670> think<00:01:08.539> the<00:01:08.630> longer

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
times when it doesn't I think the longer

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:13.029 
times when it doesn't I think the longer
term<00:01:09.170> story<00:01:10.100> is<00:01:10.340> that<00:01:10.579> gold<00:01:10.850> will<00:01:11.740> return<00:01:12.740> to

00:01:13.029 --> 00:01:13.039 
term story is that gold will return to

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:15.190 
term story is that gold will return to
its<00:01:13.069> sort<00:01:13.340> of<00:01:13.399> natural<00:01:13.819> state<00:01:14.090> which<00:01:14.390> is<00:01:14.630> to<00:01:15.170> be

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
its sort of natural state which is to be

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.580 
its sort of natural state which is to be
more<00:01:16.159> of<00:01:16.189> a<00:01:16.460> hedge<00:01:17.090> against<00:01:17.630> dollar<00:01:18.049> movement

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
more of a hedge against dollar movement

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.950 
more of a hedge against dollar movement
rather<00:01:18.799> than<00:01:18.979> anything<00:01:19.369> else<00:01:19.549> and<00:01:19.960> we'll

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
rather than anything else and we'll

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.260 
rather than anything else and we'll
trade<00:01:21.259> more<00:01:21.619> as<00:01:21.799> a<00:01:21.829> currency<00:01:22.219> rather<00:01:22.759> than<00:01:23.030> a

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
trade more as a currency rather than a

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.510 
trade more as a currency rather than a
risk<00:01:23.719> asset<00:01:24.170> what's<00:01:24.590> going<00:01:24.799> to<00:01:24.889> change<00:01:24.950> to<00:01:25.369> get

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
risk asset what's going to change to get

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.389 
risk asset what's going to change to get
us<00:01:25.639> there<00:01:25.819> I<00:01:26.060> think<00:01:26.869> that<00:01:27.100> some<00:01:28.100> kind<00:01:28.340> of

00:01:28.389 --> 00:01:28.399 
us there I think that some kind of

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:30.779 
us there I think that some kind of
resolution<00:01:28.579> over<00:01:29.179> the<00:01:29.270> European<00:01:29.780> situation

00:01:30.779 --> 00:01:30.789 
resolution over the European situation

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:34.480 
resolution over the European situation
also<00:01:31.789> i<00:01:32.119> think<00:01:32.240> the<00:01:33.009> negative<00:01:34.009> real<00:01:34.459> interest

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
also i think the negative real interest

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.550 
also i think the negative real interest
rate<00:01:34.909> policies<00:01:35.450> that<00:01:35.630> we've<00:01:35.780> seen<00:01:36.049> you<00:01:36.469> know

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
rate policies that we've seen you know

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.050

is<00:02:17.980> we've<00:02:18.640> actually<00:02:18.849> seen<00:02:19.180> the<00:02:19.330> majority<00:02:19.840> of

inflows this year going into what we

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
would turn the white metal so

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.589 
would turn the white metal so
particularly<00:02:23.890> platinum<00:02:24.370> and<00:02:24.489> palladium<00:02:24.599> the

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900

where that was an environment where the
metal<00:02:30.610> prices<00:02:31.060> did<00:02:31.420> particularly<00:02:31.810> well<00:02:32.040> it

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
metal prices did particularly well it

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.850 
metal prices did particularly well it
was<00:02:33.220> largely<00:02:33.700> on<00:02:33.819> a<00:02:33.849> rebound<00:02:34.090> of<00:02:34.600> course<00:02:34.870> and

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
was largely on a rebound of course and

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.979 
was largely on a rebound of course and
people<00:02:36.670> were<00:02:36.760> a<00:02:36.790> bit<00:02:37.030> more<00:02:37.180> optimistic<00:02:37.360> about

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
people were a bit more optimistic about

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:40.740 
people were a bit more optimistic about
the<00:02:38.410> quick<00:02:39.100> recovery<00:02:39.520> v-shaped<00:02:40.180> recovery<00:02:40.239> if

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
the quick recovery v-shaped recovery if

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.410 
the quick recovery v-shaped recovery if
you<00:02:40.870> will<00:02:41.020> from<00:02:41.260> 2008<00:02:42.190> using<00:02:42.790> at<00:02:42.880> best<00:02:43.030> pricing

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
you will from 2008 using at best pricing

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.270 
you will from 2008 using at best pricing
and<00:02:43.569> then<00:02:43.660> some<00:02:43.840> kind<00:02:44.019> of<00:02:44.050> qe3<00:02:44.470> from<00:02:44.950> the<00:02:45.069> Fed

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
and then some kind of qe3 from the Fed

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.970 
and then some kind of qe3 from the Fed
or<00:02:45.580> is<00:02:45.730> it<00:02:45.850> really<00:02:46.000> now<00:02:46.120> trading<00:02:46.510> on<00:02:46.600> better

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
or is it really now trading on better

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.710 
or is it really now trading on better
economic<00:02:47.980> data<00:02:48.160> in<00:02:48.340> the<00:02:48.430> u.s.<00:02:48.730> I<00:02:48.970> think<00:02:49.450> this

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
economic data in the u.s. I think this

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.199 
economic data in the u.s. I think this
maps<00:02:50.140> a<00:02:50.290> little<00:02:50.650> bit<00:02:50.800> of<00:02:51.010> the<00:02:51.190> the<00:02:51.430> QE<00:02:51.670> 3<00:02:51.700> but

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
maps a little bit of the the QE 3 but

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.020 
maps a little bit of the the QE 3 but
fundamentally<00:02:53.019> it's<00:02:53.019> just<00:02:53.410> the<00:02:54.030> interest

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
fundamentally it's just the interest

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.880 
fundamentally it's just the interest
rate<00:02:55.269> policy<00:02:55.450> particularly<00:02:56.019> right<00:02:56.620> now<00:02:56.830> the

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
negative real interest rates that we're

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:00.809 
negative real interest rates that we're

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
effectively saying that we're going to

underpins the hard asset story because

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:10.410 
underpins the hard asset story because
it<00:03:08.590> encourages<00:03:09.010> people<00:03:09.430> to<00:03:09.670> get<00:03:09.880> out<00:03:09.910> of<00:03:10.120> cash

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
it encourages people to get out of cash

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.309 
it encourages people to get out of cash
