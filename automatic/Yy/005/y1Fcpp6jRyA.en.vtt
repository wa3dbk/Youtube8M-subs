00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.259
 so welcome all your subscribers 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:09.059
 Now consider the adjustment procedure 

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:11.570
 alternator belt ie tension or 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:15.839
 weakening by example 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:22.109
 8 valve engines on such machines 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:25.230
 you have 110 0 to 21:15 on your knees there 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:29.910
 slightly different tensioner circuit is different 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.260
 well, in principle, everything is similar 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.520
 viburnum and grants can then do 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:38.700
 separate video somehow while on 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:40.530
 a specific example dozens show so 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:45.000
 in order to proceed 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:48.539
 belt tension adjustments necessary 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.850
 unscrew well just loosen two bolts 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:54.210
 Mounting bottom bolt and upper well 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:59.760
 more precisely nuts loosen here it is our top 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:02.219
 top nut and bottom but I thought 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:13.320
 skip will not be reachable took off 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:19.409
 protection loosen these two nuts lower 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:22.470
 i'm already relaxed and now if you 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:26.390
 must be tensioned belt that is 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.610
 pull up a little with the help you need 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.799
 adjusting bolt 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.990
 spoiler inside fool important bolt on 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:37.350
 clockwise then do a few 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:43.560
 rpm here he bolt think now well 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:44.159
 visible hat it here for 10 so in 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.299
 principle 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:52.649
 gone with a rattle 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.649
 so we throw all these ships 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:05.090
 and make several turns so one 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:09.119
 Minute not very comfortable weights 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.830
 head if he pull it clockwise 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.410
 arrow do a couple of turns 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.550
 depending on how much 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:20.820
 loosened belt made a suspender 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:25.100
 checked the tension well of course the hand is not 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.100
 everyone can check how much 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:34.709
 how much is enough tension well 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:38.160
 just made a couple of turns and then 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:40.170
 dragging everything into place that is the top 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:45.300
 tighten the nut and the bottom nut and 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:48.030
 check if there is a whistling belt so 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:50.610
 concerns loosening everything is done exactly 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.620
 also loosened upper lower nut 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.840
 generator mounting and adjusting 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.850
 the bolt must not be tightened clockwise 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.920
 the arrow, and vice versa unscrew against 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:03.299
 clockwise that is also slightly 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:07.940
 loosened and checked the tension so 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:07.940
 concerns the tension check 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:13.720
 Generally if you combine the instructions there 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:18.450
 official repair and maintenance 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:21.570
 if I'm not mistaken with the effort of 100 newtons 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:26.640
 the belt must sag between the pulleys 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:26.640
 about one or one and a half centimeters 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:35.170
 you can check it with the bottom well with the bottom 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:37.810
 side over here we have a prop 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:42.960
 engine is not very convenient to do it all 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:46.540
 and the bottom can be checked but again as 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:50.730
 find out how much effort you offered 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:54.280
 100 newton or 50 not everyone is capable of it 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:57.340
 guess I personally do as follows 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.890
 that is, replaced the belt by approximately 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.930
 eye it all to the touch 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.940
 made the adjustment that is mean 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:07.720
 belt tension 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:09.670
 then sit down salon turn on the stove let 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.260
 there on the second for the third speed heating 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.390
 glass 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:15.340
 high beam in general to the maximum 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:18.489
 including electrical appliances and you start 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:21.670
 start the engine usually if the belt 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:22.810
 tight enough when so strong 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:26.110
 generator load 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:29.350
 the belt will immediately start whistling that is it 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:33.040
 has been seen dozens of times at all 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:34.990
 my cars if this happens 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:38.290
 it means a little tighten the belt and 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:40.770
 check again but not worth it right away 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:43.030
 make five ten turns 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:45.960
 adjusting bolt so that it is not strong 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:49.150
 to pull that is pulled up two turns 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:52.540
 two to three turns and also checked 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:55.210
 achieve this result so that 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:58.320
 there was no whistle but at the same time there was no 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:01.240
 hum from generator bearing 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:06.250
 how will he i think everyone will hear if 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:10.180
 The belt will be tightened 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:11.640
 all I wanted to show in this video and 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:14.880
 to tell 

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.880
 again by example 

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:23.339
 constructions with a different type of tensioner 

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:28.349
 where there is a tension roller on his knees 

00:05:23.339 --> 00:05:30.689
 on a grant for 8 valve priors rather 

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:33.029
 just do not know exactly did not see but I think 

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:36.599
 same design we like something 

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:37.979
 I'll show you later then see you in 

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:41.689
 these videos put huskies 

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:41.689
 subscribe to the channel bye
