00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.890
 in the series traces of ajax 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:11.139
 write menno looking pot 

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:13.980
 places in amsterdam ajax history 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:13.980
 has written 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:23.990
 we are in a special place here 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.000
 the Amsterdam football history 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:29.000
 and why the low here used to be 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.680
 three soccer fields together in one 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.460
 very small triangle where ajax played 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.920
 has 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.940
 and I want to point out the first one 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.880
 is easy to see the olympic 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:41.360
 stadium that history is known though 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:43.190
 if i turn around then lay exactly here 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.590
 opposite the olympic stadium 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.969
 the stadium of the architect harry elte 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.640
 that was actually the olympic stadium 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:51.560
 before the olympic stadium the was the 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.930
 fallback base where ajax went 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:58.340
 for big competitions and then we have 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:59.630
 also behind the buildings there 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.829
 used to be the area where the 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:03.500
 Amsterdam football club 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:05.810
 AFC played and there also has Ajax 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.750
 I played Barbies because that's where I get it 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:11.000
 about want to have city barbies used to be 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.310
 Amsterdam is also a city with more 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.649
 then a football club on the highest 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.159
 level like rotterdam that now and still 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:21.140
 is always or at least at the professional level 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:22.280
 once you had in Amsterdam but ajax 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.670
 also blue white 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:28.370
 afc the volewijckers and ds5 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.020
 illustrious club anyway in a city one 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:33.260
 number of that Amsterdam club are then 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:36.229
 I am talking in particular about AFC DWS and the 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:38.630
 volewijckers who also had elsewhere in the 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.970
 city their own smaller areas and also 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.710
 ajax has official competitions on that 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.080
 played the highest level 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.909
 then let's take a look and start 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.010
 at afc 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:51.020
 we are a stone's throw away 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.330
 the olympic stadium in the stadium of 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.880
 elte is behind me here 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:58.250
 courthouse on the parnassusweg 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.880
 and here actually right through this building 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.619
 out 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.110
 behind this lay at the height of the current one 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:05.270
 frederik roeskestraat the afc terrain 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.689
 on the southern hiking trail 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.220
 fc played there between 1920 and 1962 and 

00:02:08.689 --> 00:02:13.099
 in all those years there is with some 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.349
 competition played regularly against ajax 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:17.120
 sometimes but also to the tournament every 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:19.519
 arno cup that was actually a kind 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.170
 Amsterdam tournament waste la lettre in 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:24.590
 it in Amsterdam before the war 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:27.440
 and shortly thereafter in 1954 ajax hit 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.370
 and fc each other here for the last time 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.110
 and in the years that follow Venus is involved 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.989
 us by the way still in 1960 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.959
 briefly been a trainer from afc op 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:42.390
 you see this terrain that has now disappeared 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:45.030
 nothing back at all we are 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.950
 from olympic south the olympic 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.430
 stadium we are to the west 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.870
 We drove to the port area 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.060
 are pretty much aware of this 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.190
 the railway lines towards the ditch dike 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.150
 and behind me lies the beautiful 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.950
 little church 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.110
 saint barbara with accompanying 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:05.459
 cemetery and on very beautiful old ones 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:07.290
 You can see photos of the terrain there 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.940
 made of stainless steel 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.829
 right in front of the church Sint-barbara 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:15.060
 it was the sports ground on the 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:17.220
 spaarndammerdijk from dts dts-es from 1907 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.109
 but in 1931 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.150
 they started playing football here and in 38 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:23.549
 They first came to Ajax in the 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.640
 competition from that moment were here 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:27.720
 there bis played between DBS and ajax and 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.349
 that soon became 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:33.329
 very tough sturdy spicy city there 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:35.489
 beastie clubs that really have a deep one 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:37.470
 rivalry developed that had to do 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:39.150
 with the fact that DBS is actually one 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.560
 bit was the feyenoord of amsterdam 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.319
 a workers club 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.220
 was a tough men's club and ajax 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:45.209
 of course a bit of the 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.730
 middle class 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:49.739
 what richer club and that butter the 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.859
 not so bad it was also west 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:54.599
 against east and in addition they did 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:55.500
 not very common during different periods 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:57.269
 each other 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.849
 Ajax and DBS have champion matches 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:02.400
 played against each other here which 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:04.169
 lost ajax with some regularity from 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.629
 the introduction of professional football 

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:07.949
 1954 dws them most 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:09.359
 home games in olympic 

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:11.010
 stadium 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:14.190
 and in that time is also a time dvs 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:16.709
 been national champion in 64 and 65 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:19.590
 almost again then an incident occurred 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:21.870
 for between goalkeeper jan jongblood from 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:24.870
 dws and the ajacied bennie muller there 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:28.320
 are what are called discriminatory 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.520
 ajax has played that high young blood 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.229
 was suspended 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.120
 after which the replacement of young blood and 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:34.710
 young inexperienced keeper in the deciding 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.750
 made some mistakes this week 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.340
 dvds cost the second national title in a row 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.710
 that never quite worked out 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.460
 between those two clubs deep deep 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.860
 rivalry here at the spaarndam 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.880
 i dbs and ajax we are now going to Amsterdam 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.190
 north 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.500
 we conclude our tour through the city 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:52.900
 amsterdam north here on the moss field 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:55.569
 nowadays there is market this used to be 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.789
 square the home of the illustrious 

00:04:55.569 --> 00:05:00.099
 club de volewijckers the green and whites 

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:03.580
 from Amsterdam Noord you played here 

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:04.720
 1927 to 1963 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.520
 the football fields of the volewijckers 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.919
 low more or less in the length of that 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.780
 three fields behind each other and it 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:13.300
 the middle one was the main field with 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:15.400
 grandstands around it and extra grandstands 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.599
 were of course the windows of the house 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.979
 on this square 

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:19.870
 the people who live here who could 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:22.449
 look at the field from their homes 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:24.099
 and seeing the volewijckers play there 

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:25.330
 a strong club the volewijckers in the 

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:28.360
 war years 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:30.610
 in 1944 they became Dutch champions after the 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.020
 meet war ajax in the volewijckers 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.849
 each other for the first time in real life 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.440
 competition during the war 

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:38.949
 they were friendly to them 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:41.289
 played each other and in 1945 it was then 

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:43.030
 competition in the sixties is here 

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:45.039
 even played football league 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:46.810
 professional football in the premier league 

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:49.570
 when the volewijckers returned to 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:51.580
 the highest level and in May 62 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:54.550
 Ajax also has one here at the Losfeld 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:56.440
 last ill-fated defeat suffered until 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:58.719
 great joy from the neighborhood 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.460
 it exploded around here 

00:05:58.719 --> 00:06:02.889
 after that with the volewijckers it is very fast 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.509
 went wrong the trainer daan de jong 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:06.580
 just got a cardiac arrest in the 

00:06:04.509 --> 00:06:07.750
 player bus on the way back from one 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:09.639
 away game 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:12.159
 shortly afterwards club had to relocate to 

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:14.050
 the belly closed bananas further north 

00:06:12.159 --> 00:06:16.449
 and there it went further and further downhill 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:18.159
 has the prof roof of the volewijckers 

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:19.690
 still tried it in the fusion club fc 

00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:21.009
 Amsterdam who held the last decade 

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:23.409
 then also disappeared 

00:06:21.009 --> 00:06:25.330
 and the amateur club the van neighborhood she is now 

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:26.020
 even disappeared since and since one 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:28.180
 while 

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:30.580
 merged that's a bit of the story 

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:32.349
 of all those amsterdam rivals of ajax 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:35.500
 from the good old days 

00:06:32.349 --> 00:06:35.979
 dbs and blue and white are also absorbed in fc 

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:38.169
 Amsterdam 

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:40.120
 that club did not make it and if 

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:41.650
 amateur club they do n't do it like that now 

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.520
 well if they would like we will 

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:45.400
 say 

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:46.780
 only afc that is at the moment 

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.880
 the warrior from Amsterdam 

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:51.159
 amateur level do it in the top class 

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:53.960
 very good but otherwise amsterdam 

00:06:51.159 --> 00:06:56.419
 urban derby is a thing of the past 

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:58.130
 the volewijckers they no longer exist 

00:06:56.419 --> 00:07:02.110
 but it's nice to see it here 

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:02.110
 moss that they have not yet been given
