00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:20.539 
so here is a look at the bb10 theme

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:23.509 
so here is a look at the bb10 theme
through<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:21.779> go<00:00:22.170> launcher<00:00:22.769> running<00:00:23.369> on<00:00:23.460> the

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
through the go launcher running on the

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.320 
through the go launcher running on the
blackberry<00:00:23.960> z10<00:00:25.789> launched<00:00:26.789> up<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.180> go

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
blackberry z10 launched up the go

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.410 
blackberry z10 launched up the go
launcher<00:00:27.840> here<00:00:28.699> it'll<00:00:29.699> be<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.970> jelly<00:00:30.210> bean

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
launcher here it'll be the jelly bean

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.010 
launcher here it'll be the jelly bean
runtime<00:00:30.900> or<00:00:32.180> the<00:00:33.180> go<00:00:33.329> launcher<00:00:33.719> which

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
runtime or the go launcher which

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.229 
runtime or the go launcher which
probably<00:00:34.320> runs<00:00:34.590> through<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.850> underlying

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
probably runs through the underlying

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.520 
probably runs through the underlying
jelly<00:00:36.630> bean<00:00:36.809> on<00:00:36.960> time<00:00:37.140> that<00:00:37.260> is<00:00:37.380> already

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
jelly bean on time that is already

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.959 
jelly bean on time that is already
established<00:00:37.739> but<00:00:38.399> here's<00:00:38.579> what<00:00:38.700> it<00:00:38.790> looks

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
established but here's what it looks

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.959

see here I only have one screen setup

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.419 
see here I only have one screen setup
but<00:01:30.630> you<00:01:30.840> could<00:01:31.020> add<00:01:31.140> more<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.649> easily<00:01:32.250> go

00:01:32.419 --> 00:01:32.429 
but you could add more and easily go

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:37.730 
but you could add more and easily go
between<00:01:32.759> them<00:01:34.159> so<00:01:35.159> now<00:01:35.280> these<00:01:35.399> guys<00:01:36.590> see<00:01:37.590> the

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
between them so now these guys see the

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.010 
between them so now these guys see the
back-and-forth<00:01:37.920> there<00:01:38.780> it's<00:01:39.780> pretty

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
back-and-forth there it's pretty

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.660 
back-and-forth there it's pretty
interesting<00:01:40.590> you<00:01:40.770> can<00:01:40.979> hit<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.220> contacts

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
interesting you can hit the contacts

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.059 
interesting you can hit the contacts
it'll<00:01:41.940> bring<00:01:42.119> up<00:01:42.299> pretty<00:01:43.110> much<00:01:43.200> a<00:01:43.350> generic

00:01:44.059 --> 00:01:44.069 
it'll bring up pretty much a generic

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:46.279 
it'll bring up pretty much a generic
contact<00:01:45.000> I<00:01:45.149> think<00:01:45.360> it<00:01:45.420> just<00:01:45.630> pulls<00:01:45.869> off<00:01:46.080> of

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:46.289 
contact I think it just pulls off of

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:48.830 
contact I think it just pulls off of
what's<00:01:46.560> already<00:01:46.709> on<00:01:47.039> the<00:01:47.159> device<00:01:47.630> you<00:01:48.630> can<00:01:48.780> hit

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
what's already on the device you can hit

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.410 
what's already on the device you can hit
the<00:01:48.929> browser<00:01:49.350> icon<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:50.159> it<00:01:50.250> will<00:01:50.399> launch<00:01:51.149> the

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
the browser icon and it will launch the

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.899 
the browser icon and it will launch the
Android<00:01:51.840> browser<00:01:52.110> for<00:01:52.590> you<00:01:52.789> but<00:01:53.789> what's

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
Android browser for you but what's

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.190 
Android browser for you but what's
really<00:01:54.149> really<00:01:54.569> neat<00:01:54.750> that<00:01:54.869> they've<00:01:55.020> actually

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
really really neat that they've actually

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.230 
really really neat that they've actually
built<00:01:55.560> into<00:01:55.740> it<00:01:56.399> really<00:01:56.640> kind<00:01:56.819> of<00:01:56.850> shows<00:01:57.030> you

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
built into it really kind of shows you

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.630 
built into it really kind of shows you
some<00:01:57.690> of<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.840> potential<00:01:58.170> of<00:01:58.440> this<00:01:58.590> uh<00:01:58.740> Android

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
some of the potential of this uh Android

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.050 
some of the potential of this uh Android
runtime

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
runtime

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.050

screen just like this card comes in for
composing<00:02:11.370> text<00:02:11.609> messages<00:02:12.410> here<00:02:13.410> I<00:02:13.590> have<00:02:13.799> the

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
composing text messages here I have the

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.830 
composing text messages here I have the
same<00:02:14.160> thing<00:02:14.489> within<00:02:15.329> the<00:02:15.390> Android<00:02:15.810> runtime

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
same thing within the Android runtime

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.940 
same thing within the Android runtime
that<00:02:16.739> I<00:02:16.799> was<00:02:16.920> able<00:02:17.040> to<00:02:17.160> launch<00:02:17.420> so<00:02:18.420> again<00:02:18.950> no

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
that I was able to launch so again no

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.030 
that I was able to launch so again no
real<00:02:20.160> difference<00:02:20.370> between<00:02:20.640> that<00:02:21.209> and<00:02:21.239> this<00:02:22.040> so

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
real difference between that and this so

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.580 
real difference between that and this so
that's<00:02:23.190> pretty<00:02:23.430> neat<00:02:24.049> pretty<00:02:25.049> cool<00:02:25.260> here<00:02:25.560> is

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
that's pretty neat pretty cool here is

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.699 
that's pretty neat pretty cool here is
you<00:02:26.280> can<00:02:26.400> actually<00:02:26.519> just<00:02:26.910> peek<00:02:27.180> back<00:02:27.500> and<00:02:28.500> see

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
you can actually just peek back and see

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.670 
you can actually just peek back and see
that<00:02:28.859> the<00:02:28.980> launcher<00:02:29.310> is<00:02:29.430> indeed<00:02:29.730> underneath
