00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
unlike many people who think that

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.730

Bellatrix<00:01:53.430> and<00:01:53.790> like<00:01:53.909> a<00:01:53.970> freaked<00:01:54.899> out<00:01:55.110> I<00:01:55.350> love

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
Bellatrix and like a freaked out I love

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.160 
Bellatrix and like a freaked out I love
you<00:01:55.860> way<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:56.790> I<00:01:57.119> think<00:01:57.180> Cedric<00:01:57.750> can<00:01:57.840> fall<00:01:58.049> in

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
you way and I think Cedric can fall in

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.709 
you way and I think Cedric can fall in
the<00:01:58.290> same<00:01:58.500> spell<00:01:59.189> mine<00:01:59.579> is<00:01:59.729> actually<00:01:59.880> Luna<00:02:00.540> and

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
the same spell mine is actually Luna and

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.350 
the same spell mine is actually Luna and
Seamus<00:02:01.290> because<00:02:01.799> they're<00:02:02.369> both<00:02:02.490> Irish<00:02:02.729> and<00:02:03.149> I

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
Seamus because they're both Irish and I

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.340

man<00:03:36.630> but<00:03:36.900> obviously<00:03:37.020> Voldemort's<00:03:37.740> just<00:03:37.920> not

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
man but obviously Voldemort's just not

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.550 
man but obviously Voldemort's just not
interested<00:03:38.610> is<00:03:38.760> just<00:03:39.060> into<00:03:39.570> taking<00:03:40.200> over<00:03:40.410> the

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
interested is just into taking over the

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.740 
interested is just into taking over the
world<00:03:40.770> but<00:03:41.220> I<00:03:41.460> think<00:03:41.850> that<00:03:42.060> if<00:03:42.210> he<00:03:42.240> had<00:03:42.450> let

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
world but I think that if he had let

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.960 
world but I think that if he had let
Bellatrix<00:03:43.440> in<00:03:43.680> maybe<00:03:44.280> you<00:03:44.460> would<00:03:44.610> have<00:03:44.640> ended

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
Bellatrix in maybe you would have ended

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.850 
Bellatrix in maybe you would have ended
up<00:03:45.060> a<00:03:45.180> nicer<00:03:45.540> guy<00:03:45.720> everyone<00:03:46.410> could<00:03:46.590> have<00:03:46.650> just

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
up a nicer guy everyone could have just

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.740 
up a nicer guy everyone could have just
gotten<00:03:47.100> along<00:03:47.490> and<00:03:47.550> did<00:03:48.150> their<00:03:48.300> Wizarding

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
gotten along and did their Wizarding

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.330 
gotten along and did their Wizarding
thing<00:03:49.050> I<00:03:49.260> think<00:03:49.470> if<00:03:49.620> there<00:03:49.800> was<00:03:49.830> a<00:03:49.980> bit<00:03:50.160> of<00:03:50.280> a

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
thing I think if there was a bit of a

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.250 
thing I think if there was a bit of a
hook<00:03:50.520> up<00:03:50.700> he'd<00:03:50.910> be<00:03:51.000> less<00:03:51.180> sexually<00:03:51.390> frustrated

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
hook up he'd be less sexually frustrated
