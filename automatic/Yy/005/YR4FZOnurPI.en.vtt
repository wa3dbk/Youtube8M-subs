00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
is a pretty good zoom as most cameras

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.190 
is a pretty good zoom as most cameras
actually<00:01:05.760> used<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.180> only<00:01:06.299> have<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:06.479> four<00:01:06.780> time

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
actually used to only have a four time

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.780 
actually used to only have a four time
to<00:01:07.350> zoom<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:07.680> that<00:01:07.950> was<00:01:08.070> pretty<00:01:08.220> good<00:01:08.490> so<00:01:08.700> I'm

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
to zoom and that was pretty good so I'm

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.270 
to zoom and that was pretty good so I'm
going<00:01:08.939> to<00:01:09.000> say<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.270> five-time<00:01:09.659> zoom<00:01:09.960> is<00:01:10.110> a

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
going to say the five-time zoom is a

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.820 
going to say the five-time zoom is a
really<00:01:11.280> decent<00:01:11.780> 25<00:01:12.780> millimeter<00:01:13.260> wide<00:01:13.439> angle

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
really decent 25 millimeter wide angle

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.920 
really decent 25 millimeter wide angle
lens<00:01:14.100> that's<00:01:14.700> so<00:01:14.880> you<00:01:14.970> can<00:01:15.119> get<00:01:15.240> more<00:01:15.509> into

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
lens that's so you can get more into

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.260 
lens that's so you can get more into

for<00:06:14.810> me<00:06:14.930> this<00:06:15.110> camera<00:06:15.319> would<00:06:15.590> be<00:06:15.710> a<00:06:15.740> little<00:06:15.919> bit

00:06:16.089 --> 00:06:16.099 
for me this camera would be a little bit

00:06:16.099 --> 00:06:20.080 
for me this camera would be a little bit
too<00:06:16.280> small<00:06:16.460> but<00:06:17.449> it<00:06:18.380> is<00:06:18.740> a<00:06:18.770> decent<00:06:19.250> size<00:06:19.490> for<00:06:20.060> a

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:20.090 
too small but it is a decent size for a

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:24.219 
too small but it is a decent size for a
point-and-shoot<00:06:20.530> now<00:06:22.150> in<00:06:23.150> saying<00:06:23.750> that<00:06:23.930> they
