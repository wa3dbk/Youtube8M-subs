00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.330 

so<00:00:00.359> this<00:00:00.539> masseter<00:00:00.989> muscle<00:00:01.380> it's<00:00:02.010> attached<00:00:02.310> to

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340 
so this masseter muscle it's attached to

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.910 
so this masseter muscle it's attached to
the<00:00:02.580> zygomatic<00:00:03.240> bone<00:00:04.020> and<00:00:04.350> then<00:00:04.589> to<00:00:04.799> the

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
the zygomatic bone and then to the

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.509 
the zygomatic bone and then to the
mandible<00:00:05.420> this<00:00:06.420> muscle<00:00:06.810> is<00:00:06.930> known<00:00:07.109> as<00:00:07.290> an

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:07.519 
mandible this muscle is known as an

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:10.250 
mandible this muscle is known as an
elevator<00:00:08.519> muscle<00:00:08.970> it<00:00:09.179> elevates<00:00:09.780> the<00:00:10.050> mouth

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
elevator muscle it elevates the mouth

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.190 
elevator muscle it elevates the mouth
where<00:00:10.559> it<00:00:10.620> pulls<00:00:10.889> it<00:00:11.130> up<00:00:11.309> while<00:00:11.580> chewing<00:00:12.200> so

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
where it pulls it up while chewing so

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.369 
where it pulls it up while chewing so
it's<00:00:13.469> fairly<00:00:13.799> strong<00:00:14.179> and<00:00:15.179> when<00:00:15.870> you<00:00:15.960> combine

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
it's fairly strong and when you combine

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.950 
it's fairly strong and when you combine
this<00:00:16.740> muscle<00:00:17.250> with<00:00:17.400> your<00:00:17.609> temporalis<00:00:18.359> you

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
this muscle with your temporalis you

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.560 
this muscle with your temporalis you
could<00:00:19.199> potentially<00:00:20.000> bite<00:00:21.000> off<00:00:21.180> your<00:00:21.210> own

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
could potentially bite off your own

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:22.660 
could potentially bite off your own
finger

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:22.670 
finger

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.730 
finger
so<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:23.850> temporalis<00:00:24.150> as<00:00:24.570> I<00:00:24.660> just<00:00:24.810> mentioned<00:00:25.289> is

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
so the temporalis as I just mentioned is

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.609 
so the temporalis as I just mentioned is
also<00:00:25.800> an<00:00:26.250> elevator<00:00:26.699> muscle<00:00:27.230> it's<00:00:28.230> a<00:00:28.439> pretty

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
also an elevator muscle it's a pretty

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.230 
also an elevator muscle it's a pretty
big<00:00:28.830> muscle<00:00:29.130> as<00:00:29.189> you<00:00:29.340> can<00:00:29.490> see<00:00:29.699> it<00:00:29.849> covers

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
big muscle as you can see it covers

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.299 
big muscle as you can see it covers
quite<00:00:30.510> a<00:00:30.810> bit<00:00:31.080> of<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.320> side<00:00:31.529> of<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.800> head

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
quite a bit of the side of the head

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.120 
quite a bit of the side of the head
covering<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.620> covering<00:00:34.620> your<00:00:34.739> temporary

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
covering the covering your temporary

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.750 
covering the covering your temporary
temporal<00:00:36.000> area<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:36.630> part<00:00:37.200> of<00:00:37.290> your<00:00:37.410> parietal

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
temporal area and part of your parietal

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.360 
temporal area and part of your parietal
this<00:00:38.760> muscle<00:00:39.090> is<00:00:39.210> big<00:00:39.450> but<00:00:39.719> fairly<00:00:39.989> thin<00:00:40.410> if

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
this muscle is big but fairly thin if

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.950 
this muscle is big but fairly thin if
you<00:00:41.460> compare<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.910> temporalis<00:00:42.239> muscle<00:00:42.840> with

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
you compare the temporalis muscle with

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.650 
you compare the temporalis muscle with
let's<00:00:43.170> say<00:00:43.290> a<00:00:43.320> lion<00:00:44.120> alliance<00:00:45.120> temporalis

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
let's say a lion alliance temporalis

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.779 
let's say a lion alliance temporalis
muscle<00:00:46.079> is<00:00:46.289> not<00:00:46.469> going<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:46.680> be<00:00:46.800> quite<00:00:47.250> as<00:00:47.430> as

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
muscle is not going to be quite as as

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.790 
muscle is not going to be quite as as
big<00:00:48.149> won't<00:00:48.480> cover<00:00:48.660> as<00:00:48.809> much<00:00:48.930> surface<00:00:49.350> area<00:00:49.500> as

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
big won't cover as much surface area as

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.830 
big won't cover as much surface area as
a<00:00:49.829> human<00:00:50.250> temporalis<00:00:50.850> but<00:00:51.449> it's<00:00:51.570> going<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:51.719> be

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
a human temporalis but it's going to be

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.170 
a human temporalis but it's going to be
a<00:00:51.870> lot<00:00:52.199> thicker<00:00:52.559> okay<00:00:53.489> it<00:00:53.670> can<00:00:53.789> be<00:00:53.820> anywhere

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
a lot thicker okay it can be anywhere

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.060 
a lot thicker okay it can be anywhere
from<00:00:54.239> an<00:00:54.600> inch<00:00:54.809> or<00:00:55.079> more<00:00:55.350> thicker<00:00:55.710> than<00:00:55.860> a

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
from an inch or more thicker than a

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.740 
from an inch or more thicker than a
human<00:00:56.149> so<00:00:57.149> being<00:00:57.870> that<00:00:58.170> as<00:00:58.469> it<00:00:58.620> may<00:00:58.800> you<00:00:58.859> uh<00:00:59.750> you

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
human so being that as it may you uh you

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.160 
human so being that as it may you uh you
can<00:01:00.930> imagine<00:01:01.410> how<00:01:01.559> much<00:01:01.890> stronger<00:01:02.809> or<00:01:03.809> at

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
can imagine how much stronger or at

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.990 
can imagine how much stronger or at
least<00:01:04.320> you<00:01:04.379> can<00:01:04.500> understand<00:01:04.890> as<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.070> why<00:01:05.640> and

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
least you can understand as to why and

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.640 
least you can understand as to why and
lions<00:01:07.070> jaw<00:01:08.600> its<00:01:09.600> bite<00:01:09.900> is<00:01:10.080> going<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.320> be<00:01:10.380> a<00:01:10.409> lot

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
lions jaw its bite is going to be a lot

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.620 
lions jaw its bite is going to be a lot
stronger<00:01:10.950> than<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.250> human<00:01:11.580> but<00:01:12.299> then<00:01:12.420> you<00:01:12.510> can

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
stronger than a human but then you can

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.210 
stronger than a human but then you can
also<00:01:12.780> consider<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.350> fact<00:01:13.590> that<00:01:13.680> a<00:01:13.770> lion<00:01:14.040> is

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
also consider the fact that a lion is

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.580 
also consider the fact that a lion is
eating<00:01:14.610> you<00:01:14.970> know<00:01:15.000> chewing<00:01:15.720> through<00:01:15.960> bone<00:01:16.290> and

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
eating you know chewing through bone and

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.789 
eating you know chewing through bone and
raw<00:01:16.770> muscle<00:01:17.210> so<00:01:18.210> in<00:01:19.020> any<00:01:19.140> case<00:01:19.229> so<00:01:19.590> when<00:01:19.740> you

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
raw muscle so in any case so when you

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.800 
raw muscle so in any case so when you
combine<00:01:20.130> your<00:01:20.159> temporalis<00:01:21.000> and<00:01:21.299> your

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
combine your temporalis and your

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.770 
combine your temporalis and your
masseter<00:01:22.650> muscle<00:01:23.070> those<00:01:23.820> two<00:01:24.060> are<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.420> main

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
masseter muscle those two are the main

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.660 
masseter muscle those two are the main
muscles<00:01:25.200> in<00:01:25.500> dealing<00:01:25.799> with<00:01:25.920> elevating<00:01:26.549> the

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
muscles in dealing with elevating the

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.870 
muscles in dealing with elevating the
mouth<00:01:26.909> closing<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:28.140> mouth<00:01:28.380> or<00:01:28.680> biting<00:01:29.460> down

mouth closing the mouth or biting down

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.719 
mouth closing the mouth or biting down
or<00:01:30.350> but<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.439> technical<00:01:31.920> more<00:01:32.159> correct<00:01:32.549> term

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
or but the technical more correct term

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.120 
or but the technical more correct term
to<00:01:33.000> use<00:01:33.240> is<00:01:33.509> it's<00:01:33.960> elevating<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.619> jaw<00:01:34.860> or

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
to use is it's elevating the jaw or

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.270 
to use is it's elevating the jaw or
lifting<00:01:35.759> it<00:01:35.880> up<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.360> close<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.780> mouth<00:01:37.280> so

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
lifting it up to close the mouth so

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.719 
lifting it up to close the mouth so
while<00:01:39.030> you're<00:01:39.180> chewing<00:01:39.420> your<00:01:39.600> food<00:01:40.729> your

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
while you're chewing your food your

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.670 
while you're chewing your food your
tongue<00:01:42.000> as<00:01:42.180> you<00:01:42.329> know<00:01:42.479> is<00:01:42.659> in<00:01:42.689> motion<00:01:42.990> keeping

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
tongue as you know is in motion keeping

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.490 
tongue as you know is in motion keeping
the<00:01:44.159> food<00:01:44.430> in<00:01:45.180> your<00:01:45.240> mouth<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:45.899> sometimes

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
the food in your mouth and sometimes

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.069 
the food in your mouth and sometimes
that<00:01:46.680> food<00:01:46.920> can<00:01:47.100> also<00:01:47.189> move<00:01:47.640> outside<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:48.450> the

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
that food can also move outside to the

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.710 
that food can also move outside to the
outside<00:01:49.470> of<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.710> mouth<00:01:49.920> so<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.939> muscle<00:01:51.360> that

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
keeps food in the chewing area is abuse

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.090 
keeps food in the chewing area is abuse
inator<00:01:55.890> okay<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:56.909> buccinator<00:01:57.560> it<00:01:58.560> keeps<00:01:58.860> food

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
inator okay the buccinator it keeps food

inator okay the buccinator it keeps food
in<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.280> chewing<00:01:59.640> area<00:02:00.000> it's<00:02:00.570> a<00:02:00.689> muscle<00:02:01.049> of

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
in the chewing area it's a muscle of

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.130 
in the chewing area it's a muscle of
mastication<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:02.189> if<00:02:03.090> ever<00:02:03.420> you've<00:02:03.840> bitten

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
mastication and if ever you've bitten

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.350 
mastication and if ever you've bitten
your<00:02:04.469> cheek<00:02:04.829> before<00:02:05.040> it's<00:02:05.579> usually<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:06.119> fault

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
your cheek before it's usually the fault

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.180 
your cheek before it's usually the fault
of<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.780> peu<00:02:06.960> Canadian<00:02:07.290> muscle<00:02:07.649> because<00:02:07.979> like

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
of the peu Canadian muscle because like

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.320 
of the peu Canadian muscle because like
I<00:02:08.310> said<00:02:08.539> this<00:02:09.539> muscle<00:02:10.140> pushes<00:02:11.099> food<00:02:11.370> back<00:02:11.819> into

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
I said this muscle pushes food back into

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.550 
I said this muscle pushes food back into
the<00:02:12.450> mouth

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
the mouth

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.920 
the mouth
and<00:02:13.680> sometimes<00:02:14.220> if<00:02:14.400> you're<00:02:14.550> chewing<00:02:14.930> fast

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
and sometimes if you're chewing fast

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.229 
and sometimes if you're chewing fast
enough<00:02:16.319> and<00:02:16.500> maybe<00:02:16.709> not<00:02:16.950> very<00:02:16.980> careful<00:02:17.700> you

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
enough and maybe not very careful you

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:19.820 
enough and maybe not very careful you
can<00:02:18.420> actually<00:02:18.599> bite<00:02:19.080> down<00:02:19.290> on<00:02:19.349> that<00:02:19.620> muscle

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
can actually bite down on that muscle

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.280 
can actually bite down on that muscle
and<00:02:20.190> of<00:02:20.910> course<00:02:21.120> as<00:02:21.300> you<00:02:21.420> know<00:02:21.569> once<00:02:21.870> you<00:02:21.959> bike

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
and of course as you know once you bike

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.710 
and of course as you know once you bike
bend<00:02:22.739> down<00:02:22.920> on<00:02:23.040> it<00:02:23.160> once<00:02:23.400> it<00:02:23.730> swells<00:02:24.209> and<00:02:24.569> it

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
bend down on it once it swells and it

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.330 
bend down on it once it swells and it
makes<00:02:24.870> it<00:02:25.020> a<00:02:25.080> lot<00:02:25.230> easier<00:02:25.530> to<00:02:25.620> bite<00:02:25.830> down<00:02:25.860> on<00:02:26.130> it

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
makes it a lot easier to bite down on it

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.890 
makes it a lot easier to bite down on it
again

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
again

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.420 
again
so<00:02:28.970> that's<00:02:29.970> your<00:02:30.120> brief<00:02:30.300> snare<00:02:30.540> muscle<00:02:31.019> now

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
so that's your brief snare muscle now

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.850 
so that's your brief snare muscle now
the<00:02:32.430> last<00:02:32.610> muscles<00:02:33.030> that<00:02:33.120> I<00:02:33.180> want<00:02:33.360> to<00:02:33.860> delve

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
the last muscles that I want to delve

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.100 
the last muscles that I want to delve
into<00:02:34.980> our<00:02:35.670> muscles<00:02:36.000> that<00:02:36.060> aren't<00:02:36.300> in<00:02:36.510> the<00:02:36.540> text

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
into our muscles that aren't in the text

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.410 
into our muscles that aren't in the text
but<00:02:37.380> are<00:02:37.560> very<00:02:37.920> important<00:02:38.519> when<00:02:38.819> it<00:02:38.849> comes<00:02:39.180> to

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
but are very important when it comes to

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.350 
but are very important when it comes to
mastication<00:02:40.140> and<00:02:40.530> that<00:02:41.310> is<00:02:41.430> your<00:02:41.580> medial<00:02:42.090> and

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
mastication and that is your medial and

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.199 
mastication and that is your medial and
your<00:02:42.690> lateral<00:02:43.410> pterygoid<00:02:43.769> muscles<00:02:44.580> okay<00:02:45.090> so

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
your lateral pterygoid muscles okay so

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:46.610 
your lateral pterygoid muscles okay so
at<00:02:45.360> pterygoid<00:02:45.720> the<00:02:46.080> lateral<00:02:46.470> pterygoid

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
at pterygoid the lateral pterygoid

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.800 
at pterygoid the lateral pterygoid
actually<00:02:47.130> has<00:02:47.310> a<00:02:47.549> superior<00:02:47.970> head<00:02:48.390> and<00:02:48.690> an

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
actually has a superior head and an

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.030 
actually has a superior head and an
inferior<00:02:49.170> head<00:02:49.590> and<00:02:49.830> then<00:02:50.670> you<00:02:50.760> have<00:02:50.940> the<00:02:51.150> the

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
inferior head and then you have the the

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.100 
inferior head and then you have the the
medial<00:02:53.040> pterygoid<00:02:53.430> muscles<00:02:53.970> these<00:02:54.510> muscles

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
medial pterygoid muscles these muscles

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.289 
medial pterygoid muscles these muscles
if<00:02:55.200> you<00:02:55.230> look<00:02:55.530> carefully<00:02:56.120> okay

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299 
if you look carefully okay

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:00.380 
if you look carefully okay
this<00:02:57.600> muscle<00:02:58.019> is<00:02:58.110> attached<00:02:58.560> to<00:02:59.209> to<00:03:00.209> the

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
this muscle is attached to to the

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:06.070 
this muscle is attached to to the
mandible<00:03:01.140> as<00:03:01.290> well<00:03:01.560> now<00:03:02.099> this<00:03:02.700> this<00:03:03.239> muscle

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.080 

again<00:03:07.080> it<00:03:07.200> elevates<00:03:07.650> the<00:03:07.739> mandible<00:03:08.280> but<00:03:08.880> it

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
again it elevates the mandible but it

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.220 
again it elevates the mandible but it
also<00:03:09.500> pulls<00:03:10.500> the<00:03:11.250> mandible<00:03:11.910> forward<00:03:12.239> okay

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
also pulls the mandible forward okay

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.589 
also pulls the mandible forward okay
this<00:03:14.040> is<00:03:14.130> called<00:03:14.400> protraction<00:03:15.060> of<00:03:15.420> the

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:15.599 
this is called protraction of the

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:18.490 
this is called protraction of the
mandible<00:03:16.110> so<00:03:16.319> it<00:03:16.410> moves<00:03:16.709> it<00:03:16.980> it<00:03:17.670> moves<00:03:18.030> it<00:03:18.209> up

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
mandible so it moves it it moves it up

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.770 
mandible so it moves it it moves it up
so<00:03:19.500> you<00:03:19.590> you<00:03:20.430> might<00:03:20.609> have<00:03:20.910> heard<00:03:21.570> of<00:03:21.630> an

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
so you you might have heard of an

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.660 
so you you might have heard of an
underbite<00:03:22.230> now<00:03:22.530> an<00:03:22.769> underbite<00:03:23.130> is<00:03:23.280> actually<00:03:23.579> a

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
underbite now an underbite is actually a

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.550 
underbite now an underbite is actually a
little<00:03:23.820> bit<00:03:23.940> more<00:03:24.269> than<00:03:24.510> more<00:03:25.079> involved<00:03:25.470> in

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
little bit more than more involved in

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.849 
little bit more than more involved in
just<00:03:25.799> pterygoid<00:03:26.640> muscle<00:03:27.140> you<00:03:28.140> have<00:03:28.200> ligaments

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:28.859 
just pterygoid muscle you have ligaments

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:31.699 
just pterygoid muscle you have ligaments
and<00:03:29.069> bone<00:03:29.340> structure<00:03:29.700> that's<00:03:30.380> that's<00:03:31.380> applied

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
and bone structure that's that's applied

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:36.170 
and bone structure that's that's applied
to<00:03:31.739> that<00:03:32.040> but<00:03:32.370> you<00:03:32.880> can<00:03:33.239> pool<00:03:33.750> or<00:03:34.700> you<00:03:35.700> can<00:03:35.850> pull

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
to that but you can pool or you can pull

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
to that but you can pool or you can pull
your<00:03:36.720> push<00:03:37.319> your<00:03:37.709> jaw<00:03:38.459> forward<00:03:38.880> using<00:03:39.200> these

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
your push your jaw forward using these

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.890 
your push your jaw forward using these
internal<00:03:40.799> skeletal<00:03:41.519> muscles<00:03:41.910> here<00:03:42.420> the

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
internal skeletal muscles here the

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.270 
internal skeletal muscles here the
medial<00:03:43.350> pterygoid<00:03:43.769> and<00:03:44.250> the<00:03:44.420> lateral<00:03:45.420> turn

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
medial pterygoid and the lateral turn

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.819 
medial pterygoid and the lateral turn
okay<00:03:47.280> so<00:03:47.880> that<00:03:48.660> does<00:03:48.870> it<00:03:48.989> for<00:03:49.019> these<00:03:49.410> muscles

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
okay so that does it for these muscles

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:51.650 
okay so that does it for these muscles
of<00:03:49.920> mastication<00:03:50.069> in<00:03:50.819> the<00:03:50.940> skull<00:03:51.239> I<00:03:51.420> hope

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
of mastication in the skull I hope

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.039 
of mastication in the skull I hope
