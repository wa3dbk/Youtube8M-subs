00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:18.519
 the easiest and fastest way to get 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:20.710
 before paris the plane is most likely in this 

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:22.089
 If you arrive at the airport Charles de 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.829
 nol which is in the top ten 

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:26.199
 world's largest airports 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:28.480
 8 terminals serve more than 100 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:30.069
 airlines that commit about 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.800
 1500 flights where 

00:00:30.069 --> 00:00:35.109
 about 150 daily passenger traffic 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.449
 thousand people but despite the size 

00:00:35.109 --> 00:00:40.269
 huge size to navigate there is not 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:42.579
 complicated thanks to the frequent pointer between 

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:47.340
 terminals run convenient internal 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:47.340
 shuttles automatic metro and buses 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:04.720
 so there are several ways to get there 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:06.460
 to the center of paris each of them are led by those 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.370
 same pointers located throughout 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:12.130
 the airport is enough just to raise your head 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:14.770
 explore the recommended route 1 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:17.110
 most comfort is of course a taxi but 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.460
 at the same time the most expensive in paris 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.780
 no fixed tariffs 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.600
 therefore payment will be made 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.680
 according to the amount on the counter, make sure that 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.260
 he was enabled 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.479
 cheating static so silices are rare but 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.040
 Still, better not be shy to be alert 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:31.540
 ask questions if you for example 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.790
 confuses selected route 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.010
 the longer it is the more you pay 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.979
 average get to the center is obtained 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:40.900
 for 50 60 euros unless of course lucky 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:43.479
 go around a few kilometers of traffic jams 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.700
 because of any regular strikes 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:48.310
 one of those beautiful days crazy on 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.860
 the counter I somehow exceeded 120 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.110
 euro and it was not the most pleasant surprise 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:57.869
 it is undoubtedly convenient to use a taxi 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.869
 if you are traveling company and divide the total amount 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:05.299
 the second way is the bus and big and 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.159
 quite comfortable shuttle his sidious 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:08.569
 just waiting to take you to 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:10.610
 the heart of paris 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.860
 get to the opera gorenje worth in 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.600
 around 10 euros there are separate 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.069
 french shuttles that run on 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.370
 alternative route 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:21.890
 but it costs already 16 euro buses is good 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.569
 but not always convenient because then often 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.030
 you still have to go down the subway 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:28.819
 or take a taxi to get to 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.739
 the hotel itself has smaller shuttles which 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:33.700
 bring almost to the door but cost 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:33.700
 they are already more expensive 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.159
 perhaps the most popular way to budget 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.420
 get from the airport to the center of paris 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:48.390
 these are trains 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.579
 rn especially if you are not loaded I'll show 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.590
 follow the signs that lead you 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:55.170
 to the railway terminal from where 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.239
 the actual train and go there 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.000
 trains that go with all the stops and 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:02.310
 then driven to the center in about 40 minutes and there are 50 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.930
 express and half an hour and you're in paris on 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.060
 north train station gare du nord 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.819
 or else center I'm in the ultra area 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.920
 the fare is almost 10 euro ticket 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:13.170
 includes a follow-up transfer to the subway 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.879
 buy it if necessary 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.920
 advance at the box office or special 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:19.470
 vending machines following the instructions on the display 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.389
 You can immediately buy a ticket alert tour then 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.819
 eat back there i usually don't do that 

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:25.739
 because who knows how many bags 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:29.099
 you take away from the world capital of shopping 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:31.620
 can and not do a taxi train 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:33.989
 there are different comfortable and not very clean 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.709
 not really but some inconvenience can and 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:37.049
 to endure 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:39.030
 and on the saved 40 50 euros better 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:41.040
 once again eat or drink 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.540
 by the way, you can wait 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.970
 the train that you more 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.139
 like the frequency of their follow from five 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.910
 up to fifteen minutes 

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:49.560
 follow the schedule on display 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.419
 which informs about when will 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.889
 the next train and which one 

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:54.889
 ordinary or express 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.430
 choose to eat everything depends on 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.920
 planned budget and requirements 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.510
 comfort is important remember that it is not important 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:15.159
 lose a good mood 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.159

 No time to eat at all Paris as the most 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.240
 tourist city is an exception 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.460
 here you can probably eat at any 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.700
