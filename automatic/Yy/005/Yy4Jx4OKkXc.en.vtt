00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.279
 heeled this time a wikipedia page 

00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:11.279
 pages can be 

00:00:12.079 --> 00:00:14.599
 down to be a single trust 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:17.960
 against palace navigation in the car both with the fingers 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.519
 this particular version of internet explorer 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.889
 with people down these this suite above that allows you to 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:34.319
 sum a page forward back view full screen 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.460
 James 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.650
 not a moment 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.650
 our sites 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.740
 here's how you discover a ball 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.610
 let's try a moment now 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.510
 the virtual keyboard sees that you can enlarge zoom move away 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:18.800
 saying 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.370
 which allows 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:26.160
 write without using the parent keyboard using the silent screen 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.450
 even so wanting 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:30.920
 ok close 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.260
 another thing that makes him see 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.550
 they are the memos and therefore the sensitivity of the and the touchscreen 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.430
 those are variously committed to post-its and that can be then 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.250
 left on the dekstop 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.390
 -d academy computer students who are just right to remind us 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.410
 maybe an appointment 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.970
 I often make myself come 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.620
 the list of response times 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.620
 of the screen 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.040
 they can change color as already seen 

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:13.309
 I can't send it to a friend 

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:15.069
 by email 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:16.299
 at this point here 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:18.299
 where to insert the 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:23.650
 mail address months with area bus. create an account on me and 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.509
 mail 

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:27.149
 submit it 

00:02:27.149 --> 00:02:29.049
 what I can't do you 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:32.650
 sent to the dekstop so that propoint step appears to me 

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:35.269
 another 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:38.469
 no. 1 

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:41.759
 a note that reminds me of clicking on the eye here that disappears 

00:02:42.419 --> 00:02:45.419
 as a last thing I show 

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:48.819
 how they are displayed 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:51.819
 I don't know now I open a moment who fixed 

00:02:55.679 --> 00:02:58.679
 here is the office screen 

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:03.589
 these cultures 

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:13.199
 also access x from 

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:23.699
 the fuck the screen appears, here it is 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:27.429
 still a photo creation 

00:03:27.429 --> 00:03:30.449
 follow me on so a 

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:33.449
 add one 

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:37.479
 clipart 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:47.099
 at a stroke 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:51.199
 willing temp of the screen are good 

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:54.339
 you already said they improve a lot 

00:03:54.339 --> 00:03:57.239
 if you use the lond nib and not your fingers 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:00.499
 however pens at hand because it fits here in one 

00:04:01.029 --> 00:04:03.269
 tosca slit 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:05.949
 this inter interface can be set up 

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:07.489
 calibration 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:10.489
 or. go head-first 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:17.650
 I'm not particularly good with 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.799
 at least 3 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:25.270
 I would say no, I believe that I can still do a minimum of using a 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.270
 minimum as a graphics tablet 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:30.860
 ok for now i have it all
