00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:50.590 

yeah<00:03:45.830> in<00:03:46.340> two<00:03:46.490> weeks<00:03:48.700> that's<00:03:49.700> a<00:03:49.820> dirty<00:03:50.060> one

here<00:04:08.590> we've<00:04:09.590> got<00:04:09.620> one<00:04:09.770> Union<00:04:10.310> and<00:04:10.670> a<00:04:11.270> dud

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
here we've got one Union and a dud

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:17.170 
here we've got one Union and a dud
the<00:04:13.250> humanism<00:04:14.080> that's<00:04:15.080> a<00:04:15.200> dud<00:04:16.090> whether<00:04:17.090> you

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
the humanism that's a dud whether you

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:22.180 
the humanism that's a dud whether you
can<00:04:17.269> make<00:04:17.330> how<00:04:17.720> is<00:04:19.239> darker<00:04:20.239> so<00:04:20.709> the<00:04:21.709> contents

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
can make how is darker so the contents

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.700 
can make how is darker so the contents
are<00:04:22.280> no<00:04:22.400> good<00:04:22.900> so<00:04:23.900> let's<00:04:24.080> see<00:04:24.200> what<00:04:24.320> size<00:04:24.560> this

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
are no good so let's see what size this

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.100 
are no good so let's see what size this
youngin<00:04:25.040> is<00:04:25.190> I<00:04:25.450> might<00:04:26.450> be<00:04:26.570> able<00:04:26.630> to<00:04:26.720> float<00:04:26.960> this

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
youngin is I might be able to float this

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:32.530 
youngin is I might be able to float this
pigeon<00:04:27.350> on<00:04:27.560> beneath<00:04:28.720> see<00:04:29.720> some<00:04:29.930> bigan<00:04:31.540> quite

pigeon is gone so what's wrong get him
almost<00:04:42.080> if<00:04:42.290> we<00:04:42.380> can<00:04:42.530> float<00:04:42.740> some<00:04:42.920> underneath

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
almost if we can float some underneath

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.800 
almost if we can float some underneath
that<00:04:43.400> hood<00:04:43.610> you<00:04:44.140> okay<00:04:45.140> let's<00:04:45.920> go<00:04:46.720> trying<00:04:47.720> to

the wall we can Lee it's a really simple
thing<00:05:41.050> to<00:05:41.350> do<00:05:41.760> they<00:05:42.760> tend<00:05:43.090> to<00:05:43.150> take<00:05:43.390> to

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:43.540 
thing to do they tend to take to

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:47.630 
thing to do they tend to take to
anything<00:05:43.870> you<00:05:43.990> ponder<00:05:44.290> needs<00:05:44.470> them<00:05:44.680> so<00:05:45.570> let's

sit<00:05:57.490> in<00:05:57.580> that<00:05:57.610> Eilen<00:05:58.560> let's<00:05:59.560> try<00:05:59.770> and<00:05:59.890> get<00:05:59.980> him

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:00.130 
sit in that Eilen let's try and get him

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:11.730 
sit in that Eilen let's try and get him
in<00:06:05.700> you'll<00:06:06.700> take<00:06:06.940> that<00:06:07.180> really<00:06:07.570> easily<00:06:07.930> just<00:06:10.740> a

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:11.740 
in you'll take that really easily just a

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:15.900 
in you'll take that really easily just a
better<00:06:11.890> look<00:06:14.040> they're<00:06:15.040> not<00:06:15.160> so<00:06:15.400> different<00:06:15.430> in

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:15.910 
better look they're not so different in

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:22.850 
better look they're not so different in
size<00:06:18.180> maybe<00:06:19.180> got<00:06:19.450> a<00:06:19.480> chance<00:06:20.790> somebody<00:06:21.790> else<00:06:21.880> to

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:22.860 
size maybe got a chance somebody else to

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:25.620 
size maybe got a chance somebody else to
film<00:06:23.860> a<00:06:23.950> bit<00:06:24.070> later<00:06:24.310> let's<00:06:25.030> hope<00:06:25.180> it's<00:06:25.360> a<00:06:25.420> happy

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:25.630 
film a bit later let's hope it's a happy

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:31.140 
film a bit later let's hope it's a happy
ended<00:06:26.370> okay<00:06:27.370> I<00:06:28.410> pop<00:06:29.410> the<00:06:29.530> front<00:06:29.740> back<00:06:29.950> on<00:06:30.160> but<00:06:31.120> I
