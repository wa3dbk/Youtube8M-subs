00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.230
 teach how to solve the problem of 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.850
 it does not start the playoff legends 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.810
 Well I'll show you the problem 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:24.380
 main thing that happens when you start it 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.450
 everything is started 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:31.100
 sale league of legends 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:33.660
 and at the moment a box appears and says 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:36.270
 that does not respond 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.130
 they were closing 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.880
 good what one has to do to 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.440
 be able to solve this problem 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.840
 go to 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:50.790
 to the icon 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:52.870
 direct access give left click on 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.719
 properties 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:58.540
 to compatibility and run this 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:01.500
 program for compatibility 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.500
 windows vista 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:09.690
 and then execute it as administrator 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:14.210
 they give in applying accept 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.210
 and now let's run the program 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.820
 and there it is beginning 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.820
 I have to wait 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.980
 we wait 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.829
 As we can see, the problem of 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.420
 to close and all that now has to be 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.960
 wait for the internal connection that is a 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.960
 little slow 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:10.479
 have patience already seems better 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.709
 let's hope there are few data 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.730
 to wait for it to start 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.620
 from here to the beginning 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.500
 will last a 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.500
 an eternity building 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.600
 As we can see, the game appeared and has 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.600
 operated 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.880
 correctly 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:01.670
