00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
is it's pretty much the same thing as

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.500 
is it's pretty much the same thing as
dry<00:00:25.769> brushing<00:00:26.340> only<00:00:26.730> you're<00:00:26.880> leaving<00:00:27.240> more

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
dry brushing only you're leaving more

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.609 
dry brushing only you're leaving more

only<00:00:49.230> into<00:00:49.440> my<00:00:49.559> brush<00:00:49.860> here<00:00:50.250> now<00:00:51.120> we're<00:00:51.180> going

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
only into my brush here now we're going

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.350 
only into my brush here now we're going
to<00:00:51.539> just<00:00:52.289> go<00:00:52.770> against<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.460> lines<00:00:53.730> here<00:00:54.180> which

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
to just go against the lines here which

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.229 
to just go against the lines here which
you<00:00:54.510> see<00:00:54.829> pretty<00:00:55.829> much<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.280> muscular<00:00:56.940> lines

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
you see pretty much the muscular lines

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:03.590 
you see pretty much the muscular lines
are<00:00:57.690> in<00:00:57.870> a<00:01:00.289> line<00:01:01.940> horizontal<00:01:02.940> there<00:01:03.149> so<00:01:03.480> I'm

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
are in a line horizontal there so I'm

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:20.460 
are in a line horizontal there so I'm
going<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:03.840> get<00:01:04.049> down<00:01:04.350> against<00:01:05.100> them<00:01:05.280> and

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.900 

and<00:01:20.880> pretty<00:01:21.880> much<00:01:21.970> you<00:01:22.390> see<00:01:23.250> just<00:01:24.250> with<00:01:24.490> a<00:01:24.550> few

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:24.910 
and pretty much you see just with a few

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:29.490 
and pretty much you see just with a few
strokes<00:01:25.710> you've<00:01:26.710> got<00:01:27.990> you<00:01:28.990> know<00:01:29.020> pretty<00:01:29.410> much

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
strokes you've got you know pretty much

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.010 
strokes you've got you know pretty much
what<00:01:29.710> you<00:01:30.220> need<00:01:30.460> now<00:01:31.120> of<00:01:31.300> course<00:01:31.480> that<00:01:31.750> needs<00:01:31.930> a

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
what you need now of course that needs a

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.720 
what you need now of course that needs a
little<00:01:32.140> bit<00:01:32.350> needs<00:01:32.560> a<00:01:32.650> few<00:01:32.860> more<00:01:32.890> strokes<00:01:33.280> on

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:33.730 
little bit needs a few more strokes on

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.580 
little bit needs a few more strokes on
it<00:01:33.880> but<00:01:34.630> with<00:01:34.990> the<00:01:35.230> next<00:01:35.620> layers<00:01:35.890> that<00:01:36.370> you<00:01:36.430> do

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
it but with the next layers that you do

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.260 
it but with the next layers that you do
you're<00:01:38.590> going<00:01:38.710> to<00:01:38.800> find<00:01:39.070> that<00:01:39.220> most<00:01:39.910> of<00:01:40.120> that

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
you're going to find that most of that

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.690 
you're going to find that most of that
is<00:01:40.480> taken<00:01:40.870> up<00:01:40.990> and<00:01:41.320> like<00:01:41.560> on<00:01:41.710> the<00:01:41.860> ceiling

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
is taken up and like on the ceiling

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.720 
is taken up and like on the ceiling
hands<00:01:43.180> here<00:01:43.500> usually<00:01:44.500> pretty<00:01:44.740> since<00:01:45.190> you<00:01:45.340> not

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:45.730 
hands here usually pretty since you not

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.600 
hands here usually pretty since you not
got<00:01:45.970> a<00:01:46.000> lot<00:01:46.360> of<00:01:46.390> paint<00:01:47.050> on<00:01:47.320> there<00:01:47.650> you<00:01:48.250> notice

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
got a lot of paint on there you notice

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.219 
got a lot of paint on there you notice
how<00:01:49.380> now<00:01:51.450> you<00:01:52.450> know<00:01:52.540> when<00:01:52.690> you<00:01:52.810> go<00:01:52.960> back<00:01:53.170> in

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
how now you know when you go back in

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:55.469 
how now you know when you go back in
with<00:01:53.500> those<00:01:53.830> highlights<00:01:54.460> or<00:01:54.910> actually<00:01:55.330> your

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
with those highlights or actually your

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:57.150 
with those highlights or actually your
lighter<00:01:55.720> colors<00:01:56.170> i<00:01:56.350> should<00:01:56.560> say<00:01:56.830> it's<00:01:57.070> a

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:57.160 
lighter colors i should say it's a

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.140 
lighter colors i should say it's a
correct<00:01:57.460> term<00:01:57.729> but<00:01:59.640> it's<00:02:00.640> going<00:02:00.760> to<00:02:00.850> bring<00:02:01.000> it

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:01.150 
correct term but it's going to bring it

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.000 
correct term but it's going to bring it
right<00:02:01.300> out<00:02:01.360> but<00:02:01.810> you<00:02:01.869> see<00:02:02.080> how<00:02:02.260> easily<00:02:02.500> you've

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.010 
right out but you see how easily you've

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.130 
right out but you see how easily you've
got<00:02:03.250> a<00:02:03.280> high<00:02:03.550> contrast<00:02:04.030> look<00:02:04.540> there<00:02:04.930> and

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
got a high contrast look there and

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.249 
got a high contrast look there and
that's<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:07.030> technique<00:02:07.479> called<00:02:07.780> over

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
that's the technique called over

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:14.100 
that's the technique called over
brushing<00:02:12.090> okay<00:02:13.090> so<00:02:13.150> after<00:02:13.540> that's<00:02:13.840> had<00:02:14.080> a

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
brushing okay so after that's had a

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.490 
brushing okay so after that's had a
chance<00:02:14.410> to<00:02:14.650> dry<00:02:14.950> there<00:02:15.959> that's<00:02:16.959> what<00:02:17.140> it<00:02:17.260> looks

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
chance to dry there that's what it looks

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.520 
chance to dry there that's what it looks
like<00:02:17.860> pretty<00:02:18.160> much<00:02:18.450> but<00:02:19.450> I<00:02:19.630> mean<00:02:19.959> you<00:02:20.140> see<00:02:20.320> with

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
like pretty much but I mean you see with

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.120 
like pretty much but I mean you see with
just<00:02:20.800> a<00:02:20.890> few<00:02:21.130> strokes<00:02:21.550> I<00:02:21.880> mean<00:02:22.390> and<00:02:22.860> using<00:02:23.860> very

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
just a few strokes I mean and using very

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.910 
just a few strokes I mean and using very
little<00:02:24.250> pain<00:02:24.850> and<00:02:25.180> I<00:02:26.110> oughta<00:02:26.350> maximum

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
little pain and I oughta maximum

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.130 
little pain and I oughta maximum
probably<00:02:27.640> for<00:02:27.970> beginning<00:02:28.420> painters<00:02:28.840> that<00:02:28.989> is

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
probably for beginning painters that is

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.660 
probably for beginning painters that is
one<00:02:29.380> thing<00:02:29.709> that<00:02:29.739> I<00:02:30.250> notice<00:02:31.140> a<00:02:32.280> mistake<00:02:33.280> most

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
one thing that I notice a mistake most

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.220 
one thing that I notice a mistake most
people<00:02:33.820> make<00:02:34.120> when<00:02:34.390> they<00:02:34.450> start<00:02:34.810> out<00:02:34.959> as<00:02:35.110> they

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
people make when they start out as they

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.040 
people make when they start out as they
use<00:02:35.470> way<00:02:35.890> too<00:02:35.920> much<00:02:36.370> pain<00:02:36.700> if<00:02:37.000> you've<00:02:37.300> watched

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
use way too much pain if you've watched

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.470 
use way too much pain if you've watched
the<00:02:38.410> video<00:02:38.709> of<00:02:38.769> skis<00:02:39.280> or<00:02:39.519> works<00:02:39.730> and<00:02:40.120> you<00:02:40.239> see
