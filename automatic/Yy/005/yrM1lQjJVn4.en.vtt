00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
the meter in you just take your 12

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.479 
the meter in you just take your 12
thousandths<00:03:10.050> and<00:03:10.200> you<00:03:10.650> open<00:03:11.010> up<00:03:11.100> the<00:03:11.310> throttle

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
thousandths and you open up the throttle

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.810 
thousandths and you open up the throttle
position<00:03:11.760> sensor<00:03:12.980> and<00:03:13.980> you<00:03:14.010> stick<00:03:14.400> the<00:03:14.550> 12

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
position sensor and you stick the 12

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.320 
position sensor and you stick the 12
thousandths<00:03:15.390> in<00:03:15.510> between<00:03:16.730> the<00:03:17.730> adjustment

up let me zoom out a little hope you can

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:29.630 
up let me zoom out a little hope you can
get<00:03:28.200> a<00:03:28.230> shot<00:03:28.320> of<00:03:28.650> that<00:03:28.680> so<00:03:29.130> you<00:03:29.250> understand

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
get a shot of that so you understand

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.550 
get a shot of that so you understand
what<00:03:29.760> I'm<00:03:29.850> talking<00:03:30.150> about<00:03:30.410> something<00:03:31.410> you

what I'm talking about something you
look<00:03:31.709> at<00:03:31.860> your<00:03:32.010> meter<00:03:32.160> it<00:03:32.400> should<00:03:32.580> still<00:03:32.820> be

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
look at your meter it should still be

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.979 
look at your meter it should still be
read<00:03:33.450> on<00:03:33.690> low<00:03:34.620> ohms<00:03:35.010> or<00:03:36.000> you<00:03:36.660> know<00:03:36.780> whatever

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
read on low ohms or you know whatever

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.740 
read on low ohms or you know whatever
close<00:03:37.440> to<00:03:37.620> what<00:03:37.769> it<00:03:37.860> was<00:03:37.950> reading<00:03:38.540> before<00:03:39.540> you

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
close to what it was reading before you

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.979 
close to what it was reading before you
stuck<00:03:40.019> it<00:03:40.140> in<00:03:40.260> there<00:03:40.440> which<00:03:41.370> it<00:03:41.549> does<00:03:41.840> and<00:03:42.840> then

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
stuck it in there which it does and then

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.009 
stuck it in there which it does and then
you<00:03:43.080> pull<00:03:43.530> it<00:03:43.680> out<00:03:44.060> and<00:03:45.060> it<00:03:45.209> goes<00:03:45.360> you<00:03:45.900> know

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
you pull it out and it goes you know

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:49.100 
you pull it out and it goes you know
stays<00:03:46.290> the<00:03:46.470> same<00:03:46.670> or<00:03:47.670> you<00:03:48.420> know<00:03:48.510> only<00:03:48.690> changes

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
stays the same or you know only changes

stays the same or you know only changes
in<00:03:49.140> trouble<00:03:49.590> I<00:03:50.239> got<00:03:51.239> a<00:03:51.269> text<00:03:51.570> message<00:03:51.989> a<00:03:52.200> and

in trouble I got a text message a and

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.810 
in trouble I got a text message a and
then<00:03:52.920> you<00:03:52.950> use<00:03:53.220> your<00:03:53.900> 16<00:03:54.900> thousandths

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:55.820 
then you use your 16 thousandths

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.740 
then you use your 16 thousandths
stick<00:03:56.820> it<00:03:56.940> in<00:03:57.030> there<00:03:57.180> and<00:03:57.209> that's<00:03:57.390> when<00:03:57.630> your

stick it in there and that's when your

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.430 
stick it in there and that's when your
meter<00:03:57.900> shouldn't<00:03:58.320> read<00:03:59.180> open<00:04:00.180> and<00:04:00.630> that's<00:04:01.290> the

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
meter shouldn't read open and that's the

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.150

cheaper<00:04:07.650> at<00:04:07.739> Harbor<00:04:08.010> Freight<00:04:08.040> I've<00:04:08.400> seen<00:04:08.580> them

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
cheaper at Harbor Freight I've seen them

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.810 
cheaper at Harbor Freight I've seen them
for<00:04:09.049> you<00:04:10.049> know<00:04:10.170> around<00:04:10.410> six<00:04:10.860> dollars<00:04:11.280> actually

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
for you know around six dollars actually

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:15.580 
for you know around six dollars actually
so<00:04:12.410> not<00:04:13.410> a<00:04:13.440> big<00:04:13.650> expensive<00:04:14.250> thing<00:04:14.430> to<00:04:14.459> do<00:04:14.790> and

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
so not a big expensive thing to do and

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.050 
so not a big expensive thing to do and
it's<00:04:16.590> another<00:04:16.890> shot<00:04:17.190> of<00:04:17.220> this<00:04:17.489> better

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
it's another shot of this better

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.939 
it's another shot of this better
lighting<00:04:18.479> maybe

00:04:20.939 --> 00:04:20.949 

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:24.950 

so<00:04:21.549> you<00:04:21.669> just<00:04:21.909> I<00:04:22.210> do<00:04:22.960> have<00:04:23.199> a<00:04:23.229> head<00:04:23.499> cold<00:04:23.770> and

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
so you just I do have a head cold and

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.320 
so you just I do have a head cold and
then<00:04:25.960> when<00:04:26.169> you<00:04:26.259> pull<00:04:26.439> it<00:04:26.560> out<00:04:26.999> your<00:04:27.999> meters

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
then when you pull it out your meters

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:33.929 
then when you pull it out your meters
obviously<00:04:28.900> want<00:04:29.050> to<00:04:29.080> go<00:04:29.199> back<00:04:29.409> to<00:04:32.819> your<00:04:33.819> low

00:04:33.929 --> 00:04:33.939 
obviously want to go back to your low

00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:39.689 
obviously want to go back to your low
ohm<00:04:34.120> situation<00:04:34.840> which<00:04:35.710> it<00:04:35.860> does<00:04:37.110> okay<00:04:38.110> so<00:04:38.699> this

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:39.699 
ohm situation which it does okay so this

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:41.939 
ohm situation which it does okay so this
one's<00:04:39.939> adjusted<00:04:40.479> but<00:04:41.080> if<00:04:41.199> it<00:04:41.319> wasn't<00:04:41.740> reading

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:41.949 
one's adjusted but if it wasn't reading

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:43.890 
one's adjusted but if it wasn't reading
correctly<00:04:42.610> you<00:04:43.029> know<00:04:43.120> at<00:04:43.300> the<00:04:43.419> start<00:04:43.689> position

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
correctly you know at the start position

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.659 
correctly you know at the start position
or<00:04:44.379> when<00:04:44.529> you<00:04:44.620> put<00:04:44.800> in<00:04:44.949> your<00:04:44.979> feeler<00:04:45.400> gauges

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:45.669 
or when you put in your feeler gauges

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:49.050 
or when you put in your feeler gauges
you<00:04:46.590> obviously<00:04:47.590> just<00:04:47.620> adjust<00:04:48.219> as<00:04:48.370> a<00:04:48.460> teeny<00:04:48.729> bit

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
you obviously just adjust as a teeny bit

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.309 
you obviously just adjust as a teeny bit
at<00:04:49.449> a<00:04:49.539> time<00:04:49.659> as<00:04:50.580> I<00:04:51.580> told<00:04:52.240> you<00:04:52.419> until<00:04:52.840> it<00:04:53.020> reads

00:04:53.309 --> 00:04:53.319 
at a time as I told you until it reads

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:54.540 
at a time as I told you until it reads
what<00:04:53.529> it's<00:04:53.650> supposed<00:04:53.949> to<00:04:54.069> read<00:04:54.219> and<00:04:54.460> you're

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
what it's supposed to read and you're

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.330 
what it's supposed to read and you're
finished<00:04:54.849> you<00:04:55.719> tighten<00:04:56.469> up<00:04:56.529> the<00:04:56.650> screws<00:04:56.919> check

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
finished you tighten up the screws check

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.379 
finished you tighten up the screws check
it<00:04:57.460> one<00:04:57.610> more<00:04:57.729> time<00:04:58.080> and<00:04:59.080> call<00:04:59.379> it<00:04:59.529> good

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:00.389 
it one more time and call it good
