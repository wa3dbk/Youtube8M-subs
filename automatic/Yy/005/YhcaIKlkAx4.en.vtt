00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.320 
while I actually have the recording
going<00:01:45.950> at<00:01:46.310> two<00:01:46.490> times<00:01:46.760> beef<00:01:47.090> right<00:01:47.300> now

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
going at two times beef right now

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.690 
going at two times beef right now
because<00:01:47.690> it<00:01:47.960> took<00:01:48.110> me<00:01:48.260> around<00:01:48.400> three<00:01:49.400> minutes

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
because it took me around three minutes

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.130 
because it took me around three minutes
to<00:01:49.850> download<00:01:50.060> the<00:01:50.360> whole<00:01:50.540> thing<00:01:50.780> but<00:01:50.990> it<00:01:51.050> all

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
to download the whole thing but it all

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.420 
to download the whole thing but it all
really<00:01:51.170> depends<00:01:51.830> on<00:01:51.979> your<00:01:52.130> internet

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
really depends on your internet

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:53.830 
really depends on your internet
connection<00:01:52.490> so<00:01:53.030> make<00:01:53.210> sure<00:01:53.360> that<00:01:53.479> you<00:01:53.630> have

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
connection so make sure that you have

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.770 
connection so make sure that you have
either<00:01:54.020> a<00:01:54.320> strong<00:01:54.890> Wi-Fi<00:01:55.220> connection<00:01:56.060> or<00:01:56.240> at

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
either a strong Wi-Fi connection or at

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.969 
either a strong Wi-Fi connection or at
least<00:01:56.990> LTE<00:01:57.710> on<00:01:58.220> your<00:01:59.060> iDevice<00:01:59.360> but<00:02:00.200> it<00:02:00.470> should

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
least LTE on your iDevice but it should

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:02.230 
least LTE on your iDevice but it should
not<00:02:01.070> it<00:02:01.250> really<00:02:01.429> shouldn't<00:02:01.729> take<00:02:01.940> too<00:02:02.000> long

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
not it really shouldn't take too long

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.690 
not it really shouldn't take too long
maybe<00:02:02.690> five<00:02:03.050> ten<00:02:03.560> minutes<00:02:03.590> at<00:02:04.100> most<00:02:04.369> with

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
maybe five ten minutes at most with

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.700 
maybe five ten minutes at most with
really<00:02:05.240> bad<00:02:05.390> internet<00:02:05.690> connection<00:02:05.780> but<00:02:06.380> once

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
really bad internet connection but once

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:07.960 
really bad internet connection but once
it's<00:02:06.890> done<00:02:06.979> you'll<00:02:07.280> get<00:02:07.429> a<00:02:07.490> screen<00:02:07.759> like<00:02:07.910> this

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
it's done you'll get a screen like this

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.270 
it's done you'll get a screen like this
all<00:02:08.720> you<00:02:08.810> have<00:02:08.869> to<00:02:09.020> do<00:02:09.140> is<00:02:09.259> click<00:02:09.440> on<00:02:09.560> open<00:02:10.100> in

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
and then you'll get a prompt with all

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.890 
and then you'll get a prompt with all
your<00:02:13.640> apps<00:02:13.790> that<00:02:14.030> can<00:02:14.180> open<00:02:14.450> it<00:02:14.570> up<00:02:14.750> we're

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
your apps that can open it up we're

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.960 
your apps that can open it up we're
going<00:02:15.020> to<00:02:15.080> open<00:02:15.140> it<00:02:15.320> in<00:02:15.470> NDS<00:02:16.010> for<00:02:16.310> iOS<00:02:16.670> because

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
going to open it in NDS for iOS because

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.420 
going to open it in NDS for iOS because
that's<00:02:17.750> the<00:02:18.069> application<00:02:19.069> we're<00:02:19.190> going<00:02:19.220> to<00:02:19.340> be

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
that's the application we're going to be

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.059 
that's the application we're going to be
using<00:02:19.730> to<00:02:19.819> play<00:02:19.970> the<00:02:20.120> game<00:02:20.270> and<00:02:20.740> finally<00:02:21.740> it

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
using to play the game and finally it

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:23.980 
using to play the game and finally it
will<00:02:22.190> open<00:02:22.520> an<00:02:22.610> MDS<00:02:23.000> for<00:02:23.030> iOS<00:02:23.510> it<00:02:23.660> will<00:02:23.780> take

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
will open an MDS for iOS it will take

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:25.690 
will open an MDS for iOS it will take
some<00:02:24.200> time<00:02:24.230> because<00:02:24.740> it<00:02:24.860> needs<00:02:24.980> to<00:02:25.069> extract

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
some time because it needs to extract

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.010 
some time because it needs to extract
the<00:02:26.690> NDS<00:02:27.380> file<00:02:28.130> into<00:02:29.090> the<00:02:29.180> MDS<00:02:29.540> for<00:02:29.569> iOS

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
the NDS file into the MDS for iOS

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.110 
the NDS file into the MDS for iOS
application<00:02:30.680> and<00:02:30.860> then<00:02:31.640> you<00:02:31.850> will<00:02:31.940> have<00:02:32.060> your

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
application and then you will have your

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.590 
application and then you will have your
pokemon<00:02:32.840> black<00:02:33.080> or<00:02:33.350> white<00:02:33.710> in<00:02:34.069> MDS<00:02:34.760> for<00:02:35.270> iOS

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
pokemon black or white in MDS for iOS

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.500 
pokemon black or white in MDS for iOS
and<00:02:35.810> they<00:02:35.870> both<00:02:36.080> will<00:02:36.470> work<00:02:36.770> perfectly<00:02:37.640> in<00:02:37.880> NDS

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
and they both will work perfectly in NDS

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.870 
and they both will work perfectly in NDS
for<00:02:38.750> iOS<00:02:39.050> now<00:02:39.230> note<00:02:39.530> that<00:02:39.770> this<00:02:40.310> game<00:02:40.550> only

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
for iOS now note that this game only

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.320 
for iOS now note that this game only
runs<00:02:41.090> at<00:02:41.270> full<00:02:41.300> speed<00:02:41.870> on<00:02:42.110> a<00:02:42.560> 7<00:02:43.190> devices<00:02:43.520> so

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
runs at full speed on a 7 devices so

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.020 
runs at full speed on a 7 devices so
make<00:02:45.200> sure<00:02:45.410> you<00:02:45.709> take<00:02:46.130> note<00:02:46.340> of<00:02:46.370> that<00:02:46.459> if<00:02:46.850> your

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
make sure you take note of that if your

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.309 
make sure you take note of that if your
game<00:02:47.209> is<00:02:47.240> lagging<00:02:47.630> then<00:02:47.959> it's<00:02:48.110> probably

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:48.319 
game is lagging then it's probably

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:50.170 
game is lagging then it's probably
because<00:02:48.830> of<00:02:48.860> the<00:02:49.069> phone's<00:02:49.310> hardware<00:02:49.700> and

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
because of the phone's hardware and

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.000 
because of the phone's hardware and
there's<00:02:50.840> nothing<00:02:51.170> really<00:02:51.319> that<00:02:51.440> we<00:02:51.680> can<00:02:51.830> do

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
there's nothing really that we can do

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.890 
there's nothing really that we can do
about<00:02:52.160> that<00:02:52.310> besides<00:02:52.910> wait<00:02:53.150> for<00:02:53.360> more<00:02:53.510> updates

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
about that besides wait for more updates

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.100 
about that besides wait for more updates
from<00:02:54.170> infinity<00:02:54.709> dev<00:02:54.890> that<00:02:55.100> can<00:02:55.310> hopefully

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
from infinity dev that can hopefully

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.620 
from infinity dev that can hopefully
speed<00:02:57.110> up<00:02:57.260> the<00:02:57.440> game<00:02:57.590> and<00:02:58.270> that<00:02:59.270> is<00:02:59.420> how<00:02:59.570> you

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
speed up the game and that is how you

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.380 
speed up the game and that is how you
get<00:02:59.870> pokemon<00:03:00.440> black<00:03:00.740> or<00:03:01.040> white<00:03:01.490> with<00:03:01.880> an<00:03:02.060> ax

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
get pokemon black or white with an ax

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.690 
get pokemon black or white with an ax
