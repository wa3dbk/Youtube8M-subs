00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.660 

now<00:02:07.390> driving<00:02:08.170> this<00:02:08.290> car<00:02:08.560> is<00:02:08.740> pretty<00:02:09.009> much<00:02:09.190> very

simple now if you can look down over

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.190 
simple now if you can look down over
here<00:02:14.340> there<00:02:15.340> are<00:02:15.430> just<00:02:15.640> two<00:02:15.940> leavers<00:02:16.360> what<00:02:17.080> is

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
here there are just two leavers what is

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.890 
here there are just two leavers what is
the<00:02:17.320> accelerator<00:02:18.240> the<00:02:19.240> one<00:02:19.390> I'm<00:02:19.510> pushing

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
the accelerator the one I'm pushing

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.860 
the accelerator the one I'm pushing
right<00:02:20.080> now<00:02:20.320> and<00:02:20.980> the<00:02:21.130> other<00:02:21.340> one<00:02:21.610> is<00:02:21.910> the<00:02:22.060> brake

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.210 

so<00:02:25.870> just<00:02:26.500> like<00:02:26.710> a<00:02:27.810> kiddie<00:02:28.810> car<00:02:29.380> you<00:02:29.800> know<00:02:29.950> is

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
so just like a kiddie car you know is

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
so just like a kiddie car you know is
driving<00:02:30.700> so<00:02:30.940> simple<00:02:32.070> forward<00:02:33.240> accelerator

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
driving so simple forward accelerator

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.990 
driving so simple forward accelerator
stop<00:02:36.150> brakes<00:02:37.680> and<00:02:38.680> I<00:02:39.220> guess<00:02:39.430> that<00:02:39.640> would<00:02:39.820> be

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
stop brakes and I guess that would be

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.930 
stop brakes and I guess that would be
all<00:02:40.209> and<00:02:40.750> one<00:02:41.380> thing<00:02:41.620> which<00:02:42.250> we<00:02:42.430> should<00:02:42.580> not

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
all and one thing which we should not

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.780 
all and one thing which we should not
forget<00:02:43.180> while<00:02:43.690> driving<00:02:44.080> is<00:02:44.410> the<00:02:45.010> indicators

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
forget while driving is the indicators

forget while driving is the indicators
