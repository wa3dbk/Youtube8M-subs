00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
things pretty easy to collect in the

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.560 
things pretty easy to collect in the
beginning<00:00:40.520> this<00:00:41.520> is<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.730> tube<00:00:42.059> that<00:00:42.329> we<00:00:42.450> saw

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
beginning this is the tube that we saw

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:43.729 
beginning this is the tube that we saw
earlier<00:00:42.930> when<00:00:43.050> we<00:00:43.110> passed<00:00:43.320> through<00:00:43.469> this<00:00:43.559> room

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
earlier when we passed through this room

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.709 
earlier when we passed through this room
except<00:00:44.010> now<00:00:44.100> we're<00:00:44.250> inside<00:00:44.670> of<00:00:44.820> it<00:00:44.940> get<00:00:45.600> to

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
except now we're inside of it get to

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.450 
except now we're inside of it get to
climb<00:00:45.870> up<00:00:46.050> here<00:00:46.200> to<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.500> upper<00:00:46.530> section<00:00:47.129> of

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
climb up here to the upper section of

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:57.310 
climb up here to the upper section of
area<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:54.289> boy<00:00:55.289> we<00:00:55.710> know<00:00:55.800> what<00:00:55.920> this<00:00:56.070> door<00:00:56.250> means

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
area to boy we know what this door means

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.060 
area to boy we know what this door means
but<00:00:58.320> wait<00:00:59.300> he's<00:01:00.300> not<00:01:00.449> holding<00:01:00.600> anything

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
but wait he's not holding anything

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.680 
but wait he's not holding anything
that's<00:01:02.070> because<00:01:02.489> what<00:01:02.910> he<00:01:03.000> is<00:01:03.090> holding<00:01:03.300> is

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
that's because what he is holding is

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.350 
that's because what he is holding is
behind<00:01:04.080> him<00:01:04.760> apparently<00:01:05.760> someone<00:01:06.119> is<00:01:06.240> trying

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
standard elementary school logic you can

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.740 
standard elementary school logic you can
pretty<00:01:17.549> much<00:01:17.610> figure<00:01:17.909> out<00:01:18.030> which<00:01:18.180> one<00:01:18.390> holds

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
pretty much figure out which one holds

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.710 
they were trying to find ways to make it
look<00:01:46.890> a<00:01:46.979> little<00:01:47.190> different<00:01:47.340> because<00:01:47.759> just

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
look a little different because just

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.420 
look a little different because just
doing<00:01:49.140> a<00:01:49.259> slightly<00:01:49.500> darker<00:01:49.890> palate<00:01:50.250> when

there's only four colors doesn't really

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.639 
there's only four colors doesn't really
work<00:01:53.430> so<00:01:53.700> well<00:01:53.909> so<00:01:54.299> they<00:01:54.750> added<00:01:54.960> these<00:01:55.200> giant

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
work so well so they added these giant

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:01.279

if<00:02:01.530> you're<00:02:01.710> an<00:02:01.860> avid<00:02:02.009> player<00:02:02.280> of<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.429> Metroid

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
if you're an avid player of the Metroid

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:03.740 
if you're an avid player of the Metroid
series<00:02:02.729> you're<00:02:03.030> probably<00:02:03.179> used<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.450> that<00:02:03.509> and

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
series you're probably used to that and

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.029 
series you're probably used to that and
think<00:02:03.899> has<00:02:04.080> no<00:02:04.350> big<00:02:04.500> deal<00:02:04.649> it's<00:02:04.830> what<00:02:04.920> she

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:05.039 
think has no big deal it's what she

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:06.680 
think has no big deal it's what she
looks<00:02:05.220> like<00:02:05.280> all<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.580> time<00:02:05.789> but<00:02:06.060> it<00:02:06.300> is<00:02:06.420> a<00:02:06.450> big

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
looks like all the time but it is a big

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.540 
looks like all the time but it is a big
deal<00:02:06.840> because<00:02:06.990> this<00:02:07.350> is<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:08.009> first<00:02:08.190> time<00:02:08.369> she

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.420 
of a wall while in the Spyder ball is
pretty<00:02:36.360> nasty<00:02:36.739> because<00:02:37.739> usually<00:02:38.250> have<00:02:38.340> to

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:45.770 
climb back up again so the very suit
pretty<00:02:44.040> much<00:02:44.250> doesn't<00:02:45.120> do<00:02:45.269> anything<00:02:45.570> special

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780

except<00:02:46.290> that<00:02:46.470> it<00:02:46.709> lets<00:02:47.640> us<00:02:47.790> take<00:02:47.970> about<00:02:48.150> half

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:48.359 
except that it lets us take about half

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:49.670 
except that it lets us take about half
damage

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
also make some pretty cool noise I think

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.770 
also make some pretty cool noise I think
when<00:04:25.460> it<00:04:25.550> fires<00:04:26.889> and<00:04:27.889> if<00:04:28.820> you<00:04:28.910> beg<00:04:29.060> to<00:04:29.180> differ

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
when it fires and if you beg to differ

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.590 
when it fires and if you beg to differ
I<00:04:29.979> beg<00:04:30.979> to<00:04:31.100> ask<00:04:31.280> you<00:04:31.460> sir<00:04:31.610> -<00:04:31.820> please<00:04:31.940> shut<00:04:32.419> up

I beg to ask you sir - please shut up
because<00:04:33.500> it's<00:04:33.650> on<00:04:33.770> it's<00:04:34.220> right<00:04:34.400> it's<00:04:34.789> the<00:04:34.910> most

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
because it's on it's right it's the most

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:39.969 
because it's on it's right it's the most
awesome<00:04:35.180> gun<00:04:35.479> anyway<00:04:37.870> man<00:04:38.870> they<00:04:39.560> sure<00:04:39.830> got

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:39.979 
awesome gun anyway man they sure got

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:41.710 
awesome gun anyway man they sure got
lazy<00:04:40.220> in<00:04:40.490> designing<00:04:40.820> these<00:04:41.030> rooms<00:04:41.300> because

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
lazy in designing these rooms because

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.580 
lazy in designing these rooms because
they're<00:04:41.930> all<00:04:42.139> looking<00:04:42.710> pretty<00:04:42.740> much<00:04:43.190> the<00:04:43.460> same

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
they're all looking pretty much the same

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.460 
they're all looking pretty much the same
we'll<00:04:45.590> use<00:04:45.770> the<00:04:45.979> same<00:04:46.250> trick<00:04:46.580> obviously<00:04:47.150> to

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
we'll use the same trick obviously to

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.600 
we'll use the same trick obviously to
get<00:04:48.470> the<00:04:48.590> extra<00:04:48.860> missile<00:04:49.099> upgrade<00:04:49.310> up<00:04:49.430> top

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.610 
get the extra missile upgrade up top

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:50.920 
get the extra missile upgrade up top
because<00:04:49.880> I<00:04:49.970> don't<00:04:50.090> feel<00:04:50.180> like<00:04:50.300> spider<00:04:50.599> balling

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
because I don't feel like spider balling

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.439 
because I don't feel like spider balling
all<00:04:51.050> the<00:04:51.139> way<00:04:51.229> up<00:04:51.320> to<00:04:51.410> the<00:04:51.530> ceiling<00:04:52.449> spider

balling<00:04:53.720> to<00:04:53.810> the<00:04:53.900> ceiling<00:04:54.169> is<00:04:54.260> for<00:04:54.440> losers<00:04:54.650> who

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
balling to the ceiling is for losers who

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.089 
balling to the ceiling is for losers who
want<00:04:55.639> to<00:04:55.669> waste<00:04:55.880> time<00:04:56.150> I<00:04:56.680> got<00:04:57.860> to<00:04:57.889> do<00:04:58.070> I

want to waste time I got to do I

00:04:58.099 --> 00:04:58.900 
want to waste time I got to do I
got<00:04:58.310> places<00:04:58.520> to<00:04:58.639> be

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:58.910 
got places to be

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:01.650 
got places to be
I<00:04:59.090> don't<00:04:59.570> have<00:04:59.660> time<00:04:59.870> to<00:05:00.320> waste<00:05:00.500> on<00:05:00.650> that

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:01.660 
I don't have time to waste on that

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.510 
I don't have time to waste on that
another<00:05:02.660> missile<00:05:02.900> upgrade<00:05:03.199> here<00:05:03.410> and<00:05:04.310> we<00:05:04.430> are

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 
another missile upgrade here and we are

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.189 
another missile upgrade here and we are
just<00:05:04.699> cruising<00:05:05.570> along<00:05:05.660> with<00:05:05.900> the<00:05:05.960> missile

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:06.199 
just cruising along with the missile

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:08.260 
just cruising along with the missile
upgrades<00:05:06.530> there's<00:05:07.520> a<00:05:07.580> missile<00:05:07.820> upgrade<00:05:08.090> and

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270 
upgrades there's a missile upgrade and

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:09.670 
upgrades there's a missile upgrade and
an<00:05:08.330> energy<00:05:08.660> tank<00:05:08.840> there<00:05:09.050> to<00:05:09.169> the<00:05:09.260> right<00:05:09.410> but<00:05:09.560> we

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 
an energy tank there to the right but we

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:15.159 
an energy tank there to the right but we
won't<00:05:09.889> see<00:05:10.130> it<00:05:10.220> until<00:05:10.400> later<00:05:10.880> on<00:05:13.720> man<00:05:14.720> if<00:05:15.050> only

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:15.169 
won't see it until later on man if only

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:18.070 
won't see it until later on man if only
I<00:05:15.349> could<00:05:15.650> jump<00:05:15.979> higher<00:05:16.430> I<00:05:16.900> would<00:05:17.900> have<00:05:17.990> been

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080 
I could jump higher I would have been

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.550 
I could jump higher I would have been
able<00:05:18.229> to<00:05:18.289> do<00:05:18.410> that<00:05:18.680> without<00:05:18.889> the<00:05:19.039> spider<00:05:19.340> ball

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:21.560 
able to do that without the spider ball

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.700 
able to do that without the spider ball
let's<00:05:22.560> do<00:05:22.770> something<00:05:23.010> about<00:05:23.160> that<00:05:23.340> shall<00:05:23.670> we<00:05:23.820> I

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:24.710 
let's do something about that shall we I

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:27.080 
let's do something about that shall we I
have<00:05:25.710> a<00:05:25.800> feeling<00:05:26.100> that<00:05:26.190> our<00:05:26.250> next<00:05:26.670> upgrade

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.090 
have a feeling that our next upgrade

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:30.440 
have a feeling that our next upgrade
will<00:05:27.360> allow<00:05:27.570> us<00:05:27.750> to<00:05:27.780> do<00:05:27.990> that<00:05:28.850> Wow<00:05:29.880> I'm<00:05:30.240> not

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:30.450 
will allow us to do that Wow I'm not

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:32.300 
will allow us to do that Wow I'm not
watching<00:05:30.720> my<00:05:30.840> health<00:05:31.020> this<00:05:31.860> is<00:05:31.980> not<00:05:32.130> looking

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:32.310 
watching my health this is not looking

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:38.780 
watching my health this is not looking
good<00:05:32.370> I<00:05:36.170> will<00:05:37.170> stop<00:05:37.470> to<00:05:37.620> say<00:05:37.800> that<00:05:38.130> while<00:05:38.580> it

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:38.790 
good I will stop to say that while it

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:39.830 
good I will stop to say that while it
does<00:05:38.970> look<00:05:39.090> like<00:05:39.150> I'm<00:05:39.330> pretty<00:05:39.510> good<00:05:39.630> at<00:05:39.690> this

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:39.840 
does look like I'm pretty good at this

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.160 
does look like I'm pretty good at this
game<00:05:39.930> I<00:05:40.260> am<00:05:40.500> no<00:05:41.150> professional<00:05:42.150> this<00:05:42.450> is<00:05:42.570> not<00:05:42.840> a

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:43.170 
game I am no professional this is not a

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:47.690 
game I am no professional this is not a
serious<00:05:43.830> run<00:05:44.190> and<00:05:46.370> there's<00:05:47.370> probably<00:05:47.490> many

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:47.700 
serious run and there's probably many

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:48.830 
serious run and there's probably many
times<00:05:47.970> where<00:05:48.180> I'm<00:05:48.270> pretty<00:05:48.450> close<00:05:48.540> to<00:05:48.690> death

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:48.840 
times where I'm pretty close to death

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.930 
times where I'm pretty close to death
but<00:05:49.160> that'll<00:05:50.160> just<00:05:50.190> make<00:05:50.340> it<00:05:50.520> more<00:05:50.610> realistic

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:50.940 
but that'll just make it more realistic

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:55.030 
but that'll just make it more realistic
for<00:05:51.300> you<00:05:51.390> right<00:05:52.160> right<00:05:53.160> right

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:55.040 
for you right right right

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.440 
for you right right right
so<00:05:56.040> another<00:05:56.220> fancy<00:05:56.550> missile<00:05:57.000> door<00:05:57.120> will<00:05:57.330> lead

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:57.450 
so another fancy missile door will lead

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:59.000 
so another fancy missile door will lead
us<00:05:57.570> to<00:05:57.600> another<00:05:57.960> upgrade<00:05:58.200> which<00:05:58.560> happens<00:05:58.890> to

00:05:59.000 --> 00:05:59.010 
us to another upgrade which happens to

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:02.420 
us to another upgrade which happens to
be<00:05:59.040> the<00:05:59.670> high<00:05:59.820> jump<00:06:00.120> boots<00:06:00.270> yes<00:06:01.430> basically

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:02.430 
be the high jump boots yes basically

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:06.130 
be the high jump boots yes basically
doubles<00:06:03.030> your<00:06:03.150> jumping<00:06:03.540> height<00:06:04.040> highly<00:06:05.040> nifty

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:06.140 
doubles your jumping height highly nifty

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:09.020 
doubles your jumping height highly nifty
makes<00:06:07.140> us<00:06:07.290> sending<00:06:07.560> those<00:06:07.740> giant<00:06:08.280> chasms<00:06:08.730> much

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:09.030 
makes us sending those giant chasms much

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:12.890 
makes us sending those giant chasms much
simpler<00:06:09.560> and<00:06:11.150> once<00:06:12.150> again<00:06:12.300> there's<00:06:12.690> something

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:12.900 
simpler and once again there's something

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:15.820 
simpler and once again there's something
hidden<00:06:13.170> behind<00:06:13.590> and<00:06:13.710> chose<00:06:13.860> a<00:06:13.890> statue

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:15.830 
hidden behind and chose a statue

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:17.810 
hidden behind and chose a statue
forget<00:06:16.830> bomb<00:06:17.040> our<00:06:17.220> way<00:06:17.250> through<00:06:17.490> the<00:06:17.610> wall

forget bomb our way through the wall

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:23.960 
forget bomb our way through the wall

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:23.970 
here man that's some great jumpin we're

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:24.880
