00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:16.810 
the game of today yeah well I mean the

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:19.679 
the game of today yeah well I mean the
game<00:00:16.960> was<00:00:17.140> very<00:00:17.320> short<00:00:17.650> I<00:00:17.860> think<00:00:18.510> there<00:00:19.510> were

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:19.689 
game was very short I think there were

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:23.159 
game was very short I think there were
some<00:00:19.990> strategical<00:00:20.740> I<00:00:21.570> won't<00:00:22.570> say<00:00:22.750> mistakes

00:00:23.159 --> 00:00:23.169 
some strategical I won't say mistakes

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:27.800 
some strategical I won't say mistakes
but<00:00:24.000> dubious<00:00:25.000> decisions<00:00:25.480> from<00:00:26.110> my<00:00:26.410> opponent

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
but dubious decisions from my opponent

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.359 
but dubious decisions from my opponent
he<00:00:28.810> don't<00:00:29.050> think<00:00:29.259> a<00:00:29.439> five<00:00:29.680> is<00:00:29.919> a<00:00:29.950> very<00:00:30.310> good

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:30.369 
he don't think a five is a very good

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.110 
he don't think a five is a very good
plan<00:00:30.700> for<00:00:31.119> black<00:00:31.270> in<00:00:31.450> general<00:00:31.810> I<00:00:32.020> I<00:00:32.800> thought<00:00:33.340> my

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:34.120 
plan for black in general I I thought my

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.450 
plan for black in general I I thought my
position<00:00:34.540> was<00:00:34.809> very<00:00:35.020> good<00:00:35.260> and<00:00:35.559> what<00:00:36.250> I<00:00:36.280> was

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:36.460 
position was very good and what I was

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.180 
position was very good and what I was
doing<00:00:36.760> is<00:00:36.910> very<00:00:36.940> logical<00:00:37.690> I<00:00:37.900> actually<00:00:38.290> didn't

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.190 
doing is very logical I actually didn't

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.550 
doing is very logical I actually didn't
expect<00:00:39.730> him<00:00:39.880> to<00:00:40.060> take<00:00:40.210> the<00:00:40.270> poem<00:00:40.540> I<00:00:40.810> thought

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:41.560 
expect him to take the poem I thought

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.210 
expect him to take the poem I thought
that<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:43.180> attack<00:00:43.750> has<00:00:43.780> to<00:00:44.110> be<00:00:44.290> mating<00:00:45.010> for

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:45.220 
that the attack has to be mating for

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.020 
that the attack has to be mating for
white<00:00:45.370> so<00:00:45.790> that's<00:00:46.210> what<00:00:46.360> happened<00:00:46.480> so<00:00:47.080> I<00:00:47.320> I

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
white so that's what happened so I I

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.770 
white so that's what happened so I I
generally<00:00:49.030> think<00:00:49.090> that<00:00:49.420> he<00:00:49.600> just

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
generally think that he just

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.190 
generally think that he just
underestimated<00:00:50.110> my<00:00:50.620> attack<00:00:50.920> and<00:00:51.160> after<00:00:51.400> that

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:52.200 
underestimated my attack and after that

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:59.450 
underestimated my attack and after that
the<00:00:53.200> game<00:00:53.410> was<00:00:53.650> I<00:00:53.980> mean<00:00:54.430> beyond<00:00:55.650> the<00:00:56.650> possible

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
the game was I mean beyond the possible

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.079 
the game was I mean beyond the possible
fixing<00:01:00.460> for<00:01:00.850> him<00:01:01.170> okay<00:01:02.170> and<00:01:02.380> yo<00:01:03.190> bafa<00:01:03.579> he's<00:01:03.790> in

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
fixing for him okay and yo bafa he's in

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:06.420 
fixing for him okay and yo bafa he's in
this<00:01:04.600> tournament<00:01:04.900> not<00:01:05.290> scoring<00:01:05.650> as<00:01:05.890> expected

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
this tournament not scoring as expected

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.450 
this tournament not scoring as expected
is<00:01:07.299> it<00:01:07.540> his<00:01:07.659> form<00:01:08.079> or<00:01:08.350> is<00:01:08.470> it<00:01:08.619> a<00:01:08.770> style<00:01:09.220> that

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
is it his form or is it a style that

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.249 
is it his form or is it a style that
doesn't<00:01:09.850> work<00:01:10.060> in<00:01:10.539> a<00:01:10.630> tournament<00:01:11.109> like<00:01:11.140> this

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:11.259 
doesn't work in a tournament like this

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:14.999 
doesn't work in a tournament like this
oh<00:01:11.789> it's<00:01:12.789> difficult<00:01:13.240> to<00:01:13.420> comment<00:01:13.780> I<00:01:14.380> mean<00:01:14.740> on

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:15.009 
oh it's difficult to comment I mean on

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:17.459 
oh it's difficult to comment I mean on
somebody<00:01:15.520> else's<00:01:15.939> chest<00:01:16.149> cuz<00:01:16.509> I<00:01:16.719> I<00:01:17.109> wouldn't

00:01:17.459 --> 00:01:17.469 
somebody else's chest cuz I I wouldn't

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:22.099 
somebody else's chest cuz I I wouldn't
say<00:01:17.619> I'm<00:01:17.740> i'm<00:01:18.009> playing<00:01:18.520> so<00:01:18.789> well<00:01:18.909> here<00:01:19.210> so<00:01:20.369> but

00:01:22.099 --> 00:01:22.109 
say I'm i'm playing so well here so but

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:26.219 
say I'm i'm playing so well here so but
yeah<00:01:23.109> of<00:01:23.259> course<00:01:23.590> he's<00:01:23.829> struggling<00:01:24.369> I<00:01:25.229> think

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.229 
yeah of course he's struggling I think

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:31.190 
yeah of course he's struggling I think
he<00:01:26.469> I<00:01:26.799> mean<00:01:27.159> he<00:01:27.549> needs<00:01:27.759> to<00:01:27.969> think<00:01:28.960> what<00:01:29.170> to<00:01:29.200> do

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
he I mean he needs to think what to do

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.840 
he I mean he needs to think what to do
maybe<00:01:32.200> he's<00:01:32.979> been<00:01:33.249> he's<00:01:33.460> playing<00:01:33.729> to

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
maybe he's been he's playing to

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.559 
maybe he's been he's playing to
creatively<00:01:34.359> so<00:01:34.719> you<00:01:35.020> know<00:01:35.139> know<00:01:35.999> and<00:01:36.999> then

00:01:37.559 --> 00:01:37.569 
creatively so you know know and then

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:39.840 
creatively so you know know and then
about<00:01:37.600> your<00:01:37.990> own<00:01:38.109> score<00:01:38.469> as<00:01:38.709> she<00:01:39.009> said<00:01:39.249> not<00:01:39.700> too

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
about your own score as she said not too

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.090 
about your own score as she said not too
good<00:01:40.139> especially<00:01:41.139> when<00:01:41.380> we<00:01:41.530> compare<00:01:41.920> it<00:01:42.069> with

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
good especially when we compare it with

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.730 
good especially when we compare it with
last<00:01:42.429> year<00:01:42.700> do<00:01:43.359> you<00:01:43.450> have<00:01:43.600> an<00:01:43.719> explanation<00:01:45.299> I

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
last year do you have an explanation I

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.539 
last year do you have an explanation I
wish<00:01:47.740> I<00:01:47.920> had<00:01:48.130> so<00:01:49.829> that's<00:01:50.829> kind<00:01:51.249> of<00:01:51.279> a<00:01:51.369> problem

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:51.549 
wish I had so that's kind of a problem

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:57.660 
wish I had so that's kind of a problem
so<00:01:52.209> I<00:01:52.740> mean<00:01:53.740> I<00:01:54.039> I<00:01:54.549> think<00:01:55.420> I'm<00:01:55.600> I'm<00:01:56.039> my<00:01:57.039> my<00:01:57.399> plane

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
so I mean I I think I'm I'm my my plane

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.929 
so I mean I I think I'm I'm my my plane
last<00:01:58.270> couple<00:01:58.630> rounds<00:01:58.810> is<00:01:59.139> better<00:01:59.350> than<00:01:59.560> before

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
last couple rounds is better than before

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.899 
last couple rounds is better than before
but<00:02:00.939> it's<00:02:01.179> still<00:02:01.560> nowhere<00:02:02.560> near<00:02:02.859> what<00:02:03.759> I'm

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
but it's still nowhere near what I'm

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.050 
but it's still nowhere near what I'm
used<00:02:04.179> to<00:02:05.069> okay<00:02:06.069> that's<00:02:06.279> obvious<00:02:06.609> but<00:02:06.670> is<00:02:06.909> it

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
used to okay that's obvious but is it

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.480 
used to okay that's obvious but is it
like<00:02:07.270> maybe<00:02:07.719> that<00:02:08.020> calculations<00:02:08.770> are<00:02:09.130> not

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:09.490 
like maybe that calculations are not

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:14.370 
like maybe that calculations are not
correct<00:02:10.740> what<00:02:11.740> is<00:02:11.860> it<00:02:12.120> no<00:02:13.120> actually<00:02:13.600> I<00:02:13.630> think

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
correct what is it no actually I think

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.890 
correct what is it no actually I think
my<00:02:14.680> chest<00:02:15.370> is<00:02:15.550> fine<00:02:15.820> is<00:02:16.120> just<00:02:16.390> at<00:02:16.570> the<00:02:16.750> one

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
my chest is fine is just at the one

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.390 
my chest is fine is just at the one
moment<00:02:17.230> I'm

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
moment I'm

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:24.580 
moment I'm
I'm<00:02:19.450> starting<00:02:20.450> to<00:02:22.330> make<00:02:23.330> weird<00:02:23.810> decisions<00:02:24.290> so

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
I'm starting to make weird decisions so

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.020 
I'm starting to make weird decisions so
I'll<00:02:25.510> I'll<00:02:26.510> think<00:02:26.780> about<00:02:26.870> it<00:02:27.050> ok<00:02:28.010> ok<00:02:28.580> now<00:02:28.880> but

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
I'll I'll think about it ok ok now but

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.780 
I'll I'll think about it ok ok now but
there's<00:02:29.239> still<00:02:29.330> a<00:02:29.720> lot<00:02:30.230> of<00:02:30.260> runs<00:02:30.560> to<00:02:30.739> go<00:02:30.920> after

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
there's still a lot of runs to go after

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.600 
there's still a lot of runs to go after
a<00:02:32.060> victory<00:02:32.300> like<00:02:32.780> this<00:02:33.020> a<00:02:33.050> quick<00:02:33.410> victory<00:02:33.610> is

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
a victory like this a quick victory is

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.699 
a victory like this a quick victory is
its<00:02:34.819> you're<00:02:35.269> still<00:02:35.540> getting<00:02:35.900> ambition<00:02:36.470> again
