00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:08.299 

so<00:00:05.819> we<00:00:06.420> made<00:00:06.660> row<00:00:07.049> and<00:00:07.319> line<00:00:07.649> your<00:00:07.680> planting

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
so we made row and line your planting

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.150 
so we made row and line your planting
and<00:00:08.639> we<00:00:09.179> must<00:00:09.420> maintain<00:00:09.690> crops<00:00:10.320> that<00:00:10.920> were

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
and we must maintain crops that were

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.940 
and we must maintain crops that were
sown<00:00:11.460> so<00:00:12.240> for<00:00:12.660> the<00:00:12.750> maintenance<00:00:12.960> of<00:00:13.440> cultures

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
sown so for the maintenance of cultures

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.890 
sown so for the maintenance of cultures
that<00:00:14.250> were<00:00:14.460> planted<00:00:14.969> there<00:00:15.360> is<00:00:15.480> a<00:00:15.509> small

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
that were planted there is a small

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.050 
that were planted there is a small
device<00:00:16.260> on<00:00:16.740> which<00:00:17.010> you<00:00:17.190> can<00:00:17.340> put<00:00:17.400> different

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
device on which you can put different

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.000 
device on which you can put different
tools

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.010 
tools

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.519 
tools
those<00:00:20.010> are<00:00:20.369> scrapers<00:00:21.119> that<00:00:21.390> can<00:00:22.050> cut<00:00:22.380> the

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
those are scrapers that can cut the

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.830 
those are scrapers that can cut the
grass<00:00:22.740> which<00:00:23.310> are<00:00:23.670> of<00:00:23.939> different<00:00:24.630> widths

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
grass which are of different widths

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.380 
grass which are of different widths
according<00:00:25.680> to<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:25.980> distance<00:00:26.460> that<00:00:26.730> was<00:00:27.119> set

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
according to the distance that was set

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.930 
according to the distance that was set
up<00:00:27.420> between<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.140> lines<00:00:29.359> those<00:00:30.359> are<00:00:30.689> close

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:31.940 
up between the lines those are close

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.319 
up between the lines those are close
that<00:00:32.940> can<00:00:33.300> make<00:00:33.600> hoeing<00:00:34.350> so<00:00:35.250> that<00:00:35.550> water<00:00:35.850> can

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
that can make hoeing so that water can

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.780 
that can make hoeing so that water can
still<00:00:36.660> penetrate<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.590> soil<00:00:38.750> and<00:00:40.579> this<00:00:41.579> is<00:00:41.760> a

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
still penetrate the soil and this is a

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.170 
still penetrate the soil and this is a
piece<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.480> edit<00:00:42.890> that<00:00:43.890> opens<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.610> lines<00:00:44.820> and

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
piece to edit that opens the lines and

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.830 
piece to edit that opens the lines and
send<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:46.440> extra<00:00:46.920> soil<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.820> crops<00:00:48.149> that<00:00:48.570> need

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
send the extra soil to crops that need

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.150 
send the extra soil to crops that need
it<00:00:49.309> so<00:00:50.309> these<00:00:51.059> three<00:00:51.510> types<00:00:51.809> of<00:00:52.050> tools<00:00:52.379> can<00:00:53.100> be

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
it so these three types of tools can be

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.119 
it so these three types of tools can be
adjusted<00:00:53.969> on<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.329> single<00:00:54.899> machine<00:00:57.199> so<00:00:58.199> how<00:00:58.980> it

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
adjusted on a single machine so how it

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.569 
adjusted on a single machine so how it
comes<00:00:59.510> well<00:01:00.510> we<00:01:01.230> will<00:01:01.379> take<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.859> small<00:01:02.070> scraper

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
comes well we will take a small scraper

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.899 
comes well we will take a small scraper
that<00:01:02.940> we<00:01:03.690> will<00:01:03.870> set<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.409> rise<00:01:04.710> from<00:01:05.250> each<00:01:05.519> side

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
that we will set and rise from each side

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:15.859 
that we will set and rise from each side
of<00:01:06.119> each<00:01:06.270> line<00:01:07.340> she<00:01:08.340> enters<00:01:08.820> in<00:01:09.090> this<00:01:09.240> pot<00:01:14.869> we

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
of each line she enters in this pot we

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:23.080 
of each line she enters in this pot we
fixed<00:01:16.320> it<00:01:16.439> with<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:16.920> key<00:01:17.360> just<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.630> key<00:01:19.020> certain

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:29.410 

we<00:01:24.090> will<00:01:24.270> tighten<00:01:24.650> so<00:01:25.650> that<00:01:26.580> it<00:01:26.759> is<00:01:26.909> blocked

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.410 

well<00:01:30.710> then<00:01:31.710> we<00:01:31.920> will<00:01:32.070> adjust<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.579> tool<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:33.299> the

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
well then we will adjust the tool to the

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.260 
well then we will adjust the tool to the
size<00:01:33.659> of<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.439> one<00:01:34.650> who<00:01:34.860> uses<00:01:35.100> it<00:01:38.270> to

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
size of the one who uses it to

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.380 
size of the one who uses it to
settings--<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:40.530> aid<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:41.119> position<00:01:42.119> of<00:01:42.270> the

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
settings-- the aid and position of the

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.310 
settings-- the aid and position of the
Andals<00:01:42.810> depending<00:01:43.409> also<00:01:43.590> on<00:01:44.070> we<00:01:44.850> will<00:01:45.030> use<00:01:45.090> it

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.770 

so<00:01:49.320> we<00:01:49.799> set<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.159> eight<00:01:50.280> position<00:01:50.939> here<00:01:51.630> and

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
so we set the eight position here and

00:01:51.780 --> 00:02:01.360 
so we set the eight position here and
the<00:01:52.649> position<00:01:53.100> of<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.430> Andals<00:01:53.850> here

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:01.370 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:06.260 

by<00:02:02.370> a<00:02:02.400> movement<00:02:02.880> back<00:02:03.480> and<00:02:03.780> forth<00:02:04.130> well<00:02:05.130> we<00:02:06.000> cut

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
by a movement back and forth well we cut

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.169 
by a movement back and forth well we cut
the<00:02:06.420> grass<00:02:06.570> without<00:02:07.140> any<00:02:07.680> efforts<00:02:08.250> between

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
the grass without any efforts between

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.289 
the grass without any efforts between
the<00:02:09.330> lines<00:02:09.570> of<00:02:09.869> radish
