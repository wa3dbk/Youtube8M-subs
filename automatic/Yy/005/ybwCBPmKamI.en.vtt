 hello people corals with you today 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.070
 we will create a block in cinema 4d 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.930
 what kind of block is this block for the game 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.820
 minecraft if you want to create 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.920
 Any animation you want to create 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.900
 something like built just not 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.090
 Mainkravte and in cinema 4d 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.039
 then we will definitely need blocks a 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.859
 block we are made of words let 's 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.890
 let's start first create a cube change it 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:38.160
 well, let's say up to 100 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:40.850
 to look more harmonious here 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.890
 voila so now we need material 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.840
 material we will take x textures 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.629
 more precisely the material of us will be and is 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.100
 texture texture game minecraft here on 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.730
 a train 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:57.660
 so now we remove the interpolation without 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.820
 here choose copy shader channel i 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.649
 I do n't remember already 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:04.769
 openable fu here paste shader 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:07.500
 voila frame now assign ready 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:11.640
 here we press here here we choose 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:14.460
 scale here choose 1600 and here too 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:18.090
 choose 1600 ready we have appeared 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.580
 black us appeared black white block i 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.860
 I do not remember what that unit is called and 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.619
 let's start living the offset lighting 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.479
 we have performed by yurevich and now if 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.229
 will shift we have blocks 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:33.270
 minecraft games first stone sweat 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:35.640
 block of land then block of grass let's the same with 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.590
 you about texture ruim grass block and there 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.180
 still a huge number of blocks that 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.340
 can be very very very easy 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.490
 textured we proceed to this block 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.040
 what we need to create need to do 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.229
 polygonal filthy polygonal behind 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.140
 easy to know about this button so 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.960
 then we copy the material ready 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.360
 Now we send this material 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.400
 any polygon for example, let's say 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.190
 select from here and so choose a polygon 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:10.119
 now assign the material to the polygon 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:14.320
 here choose 1600 is ready now for us 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:17.830
 need to paint this polygon for this 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:20.350
 we open it here choose the color 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:23.700
 color we choose literally 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:27.910
 colors of the screen let's say this one 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:30.210
 here already intimacy we will be a little bit 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.210
 reduce 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:36.010
 so we will do it like this 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:41.670
 it turns out again a black and white block that I 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:45.610
 not once did it so that's somewhere already 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:49.810
 so here is a little bit better then 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:52.630
 the lighter is still cant 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:55.420
 cant but it seems fine to me so 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:57.510
 now you will change the lower block 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:01.060
 the bottom block of us is very easy 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:04.260
 we again choose this one 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:07.330
 we remove this shnyagu under control 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:11.290
 further create the same material david 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:15.930
 such a contour c counter in as 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:20.380
 now change now change here 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:23.080
 feeling I will say that here is the editor 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.150
 apply the lower part to change too 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:28.930
 easy i just stopped recording a little 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:31.360
 so as to confused excuse me so 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:37.989
 Now we will betray the size of this 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:40.870
 it will also be here in 1600, too, in 1600 all 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:44.500
 now we drag so wrong 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:47.709
 side so so so here so 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:50.620
 literally every 100 as I said all 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:51.209
 voila and we get a normal block 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.100
 and 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:56.530
 normal beautiful grass blog in the game 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:58.170
