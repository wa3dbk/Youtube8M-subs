00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.859
 hey people i am looking for a bushkow 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.350
 and today I want to give you one 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.150
 Imagine camping mat if you ever 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.190
 Christmas has slept outside and 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.410
 maybe from a sleeping time 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.540
 then you know how important the isolation is 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.770
 especially from the bottom is and just too 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.920
 in the winter season is one 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.340
 installation from the bottom possible yes 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.020
 necessary for survival if on it 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.600
 arrives and that's why I want you 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.500
 today the cameras satellite sohl 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.510
 imagine 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.830
 that's the mat on which lies and 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.630
 I'm really excited about it 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.369
 this mat and I want you now 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.210
 Let me show you why I definitely do 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.210
 would recommend 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:40.980
 the requirements for iso mats are 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.629
 incredibly versatile and hanging 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.090
 Of course, very much from the field of application 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.520
 why I still the sleeping pad here 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.309
 yes for almost anyone can recommend 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.320
 He has some very simple reasons for that 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.480
 first reason is schonmal it costs 44 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.710
 euro if you compare that with others 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.600
 tavares sleeping mats 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.550
 then you usually have to go 100 euros again 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.000
 drauflegen that there is a camera it 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.949
 gets for and gets for 44 euros 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.049
 still very much at the math 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.270
 much offered as I think 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.159
 As a first time, she is one of the 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.950
 leichtesten Isomatten this on currently 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.299
 The market gives with 410 grams 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.369
 really hard to top 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.299
 but that was compared to a therme 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.000
 rest per light 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.729
 they weigh between 6 and 7,100 grams 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.920
 depending on which model you choose who 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.799
 what now compared with neon he is the 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.180
 neon he has something easier for it 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.770
 but they have other disadvantages 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.020
 and when we compare that 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.820
 stay with the inflatable tamaris 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.280
 mats then we have the whole here 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.500
 big advantage that they are from across 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.460
 is made of crosslinked polyethylene and 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.380
 This makes it incredibly resistant 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.360
 thing where I always has big problems 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.460
 if I have a sleeping mat there is 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.470
 that I almost only use them in the tent 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.170
 can and if under the deaf then I have to 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.180
 really pay attention to the floor or must 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.799
 even lay down a floor plate 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.530
 I do not have the problem with the mat 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.420
 this plastic if you are so easy 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.829
 want to say that is like the old ones 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.420
 Maybe some of you are camping 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.099
 know 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.020
 there is nothing broken there is times 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.879
 a needle in there to put wet times 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.420
 through then a small smile is in it 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:15.640
 that was it 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.200
 now many say yes good but a 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.099
 Terrorist pro lite is also incredible 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.230
 stable 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:21.819
 yes that may be I already have a lot 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.860
 I made with my thermal rest 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:26.290
 otherwise , and indeed was 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.970
 Amazed how much they endured 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.890
 But it is so I do not want me 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.780
 rely on it because when I'm on 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.550
 any two three day tour 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.840
 and I'm going to break this matte then it is 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.790
 the one thing but when I actually 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.600
 several weeks on the road 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.890
 in the canoe holiday and my tab inflatable 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.080
 gets air mattress or thermal rest 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.590
 a hole then is the isolation performance 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.900
 then 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.970
 it can not happen with the matter 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:52.150
 The only disadvantage to the mat here 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:54.310
 it is right that you are right 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.360
 it's not all that big here 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.880
 fold up 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.150
 then you'll see that's natural 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:03.280
 not to compare with the pack size of 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:06.880
 terma rest pro light or maybe 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.230
 he even goes on to score 51 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:12.519
 13 on 14 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:14.230
 The sleeping pad is relatively okay from the pack size 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:15.340
 if you have such a normal to roll up 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.870
 it is even bigger 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.880
 and if I think that outside 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.380
 It's not a backpack, either 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.880
 problem and I have the advantage that 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.650
 if I take a break somewhere I do 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.140
 just pull out the part on the 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:29.590
 throws ground and sit down comfortably 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:31.060
 can many complain still synonymous 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.670
 little to the comfort of such 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.799
 Polyethylene mats rum and prefer 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.910
 that's why they prefer an inflatable what they do 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:38.560
 absolutely understand 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.329
 but I must honestly say I was 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.670
 very enthusiastic about the comfort of this 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:45.850
 mat from the construction she has such a 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.260
 egg cups pattern that you on the one 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.030
 has side elevations and then directly 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.859
 next to it a well what natural 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.600
 on the other side exactly that 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:54.280
 on the contrary, it causes one 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.500
 well on the one hand it is 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.390
 on the other side the fulfillment and 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.980
 that is really incredibly comfortable 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.140
 you can almost do it a bit 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.870
 Compare that with one so 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.340
 art massage mat has come to this 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.810
 Of course, that too after one 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.569
 he has sleeping bag on it 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:13.540
 of course also on the back 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:15.340
 feathers or a filling in it he has the 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.579
 fumes these naturally attract even 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.419
 so it does not get uncomfortable or anything 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:21.400
 Of course, you are clear about that 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:22.750
 it must be that they nibble with each other 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.510
 the time a bit flat 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:28.690
 of course that is a disadvantage for 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:31.600
 44 euros if the 45 years I can hold 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:33.180
 I also like to buy good new ones 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.530
 absolutely OK 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.690
 otherwise it is here on one side 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.760
 here in this yellow color on the 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:43.210
 another side alu coated what else 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:45.160
 times better heat insulation offers 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.830
 mostly it is so on the 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.660
 story of the page pages reflected 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:52.240
 the body heat is beautiful again and again 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:54.820
 The mat has name acquisition of 26 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.919
 which of course also pleasant on this 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:59.230
 target harmonica if system is here 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:01.510
 that you simply as a complete part 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:02.380
 can use me slightly increased 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:04.330
 draufzusetzen 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:07.450
 or I can also put the mat in exactly 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:09.760
 halve the half and then have one 

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:11.680
 double pad that just me yes 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.240
 advertise twice but at the same time 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.820
 Of course also double upholstery at 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:18.010
 yes, in my opinion that is 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:21.040
 Matt a very clear buy recommendation like 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:22.960
 I think she's super comfortable that 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.880
 only problem where I am with her is 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.600
 it packpack but that can be 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.610
 cope with 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:30.070
 and i just have the advantage that 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:32.560
 she is incredibly stable and very warm 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:35.440
 is yes if you are interested in the mat 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:37.390
 then have a look at www.my time eu 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:40.090
 over there you can relate the mat 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:42.100
 as I said for 44 euros there is still one 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:44.290
 other model of this satellite 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.669
 who has no idea coating and 

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:49.390
 is then held in such a shade of brown 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:51.880
 it's about 30 euros a bit cheaper 

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:52.990
 But I think both are really great 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.180
 and from me a very clear one 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:58.800
 buy recommendation then I thank you fors 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.800
 watch and see you next time
