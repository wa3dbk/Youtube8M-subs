of<00:06:52.860> these<00:06:53.040> little<00:06:53.460> bins<00:06:53.640> with<00:06:53.880> opened<00:06:54.680> started

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:55.680 
of these little bins with opened started

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.080 
of these little bins with opened started
balls<00:06:55.920> because<00:06:56.190> once<00:06:56.340> they're<00:06:56.490> open<00:06:56.880> and

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:57.090 
balls because once they're open and

00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:58.820 
balls because once they're open and
started<00:06:57.390> I<00:06:57.540> like<00:06:57.720> to<00:06:57.870> keep<00:06:57.990> them<00:06:58.140> separately

00:06:58.820 --> 00:06:58.830 
started I like to keep them separately

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:01.700 
started I like to keep them separately
so<00:06:58.860> that<00:06:59.070> I<00:06:59.220> don't<00:06:59.870> get<00:07:00.870> confused<00:07:01.020> and<00:07:01.530> then<00:07:01.620> I

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:01.710 
so that I don't get confused and then I

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:02.840 
so that I don't get confused and then I
just<00:07:01.890> weigh<00:07:02.070> them<00:07:02.280> to<00:07:02.400> know<00:07:02.550> how<00:07:02.700> much

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:02.850 
just weigh them to know how much

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:05.360 
just weigh them to know how much
approximately<00:07:03.780> how<00:07:03.900> much<00:07:04.020> yarn<00:07:04.260> is<00:07:04.410> left<00:07:04.710> so

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:05.370 
approximately how much yarn is left so

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:08.600 
approximately how much yarn is left so
that<00:07:05.400> is<00:07:05.820> basically<00:07:06.150> my<00:07:07.160> pretty<00:07:08.160> much<00:07:08.400> like

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:08.610 
that is basically my pretty much like

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:11.900 
that is basically my pretty much like
the<00:07:08.730> new<00:07:08.910> yarn<00:07:09.210> stash<00:07:09.560> there<00:07:10.560> and<00:07:11.130> then<00:07:11.880> just
