00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.340
 solutions 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:25.400
 Youth as the hairstyle 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:27.439
 it really is a very very fashionable resource 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.009
 that is being used by girls the 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:30.009
 otan girls 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.690
 A) Yes 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:03.280
 We are with javi and I started doing 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:06.710
 a kind of lattice 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:10.600
 one hand exactly and we will continue 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.600
 I'm going to make a braid here 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:29.610
 it looked and news when nobody 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.610
 it's normal that I took years 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.079
 the braid 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.530
 is taking 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:56.340
 and then I'm leaving I 'm getting out of here 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:00.590
 outline the outline I do not know exactly 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.590
 how far away 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.539
 if it is important that you have in the little hair 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.399
 whole there you can wear a braid a 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:13.019
 little more neat when the expert 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:18.209
 is scaled down appear by 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:21.480
 there but the solution is to have a 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:23.370
 arm so that perfect so clear what 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:30.999
 ideal is that this one 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:32.409
 stretched also serves to create 

00:02:30.999 --> 00:02:35.170
 while the girl who has the most hair 

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:37.510
 corrugated with curlers suffer from the volume not 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:40.389
 they like the volume is a braid well 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:44.189
 more pegadito because later he wants this 

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:44.189
 like an hour of frizz 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:57.659
 we 're going to leave that 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.780
 when I was in school but what 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.790
 I wanted to ask Mauricio there's a 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.010
 trend of brides who are also 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.620
 doing very many and many 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.419
 girlfriends are liking me 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:21.730
 I personally like braids more 

00:03:16.419 --> 00:03:24.030
 looser not so tight as were the 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:27.280
 Ribbons tomatoes for weddings 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:30.069
 more romantic the braid cuts you the 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.189
 hair no no no no to 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:35.379
 No product before to prepare by 

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:37.150
 a little touch of oil comes in handy because 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:40.950
 from the fate closes the politos 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.950
 then to be able to work better 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:57.130

00:03:54.189 --> 00:04:02.430

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:02.430
 says mexico as a general melo week 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:14.010
 to be able to let them tell me once 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:14.010
 more than clear 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:28.889
 I will not take it 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:32.419
