for<00:03:30.030> about<00:03:30.239> nine<00:03:30.510> or<00:03:30.720> ten<00:03:30.750> dollars<00:03:32.000> but<00:03:33.000> this

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
for about nine or ten dollars but this

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.539 
for about nine or ten dollars but this
has<00:03:33.690> 150<00:03:34.470> grams<00:03:34.739> and<00:03:35.010> this<00:03:35.099> would<00:03:35.340> usually

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
has 150 grams and this would usually

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:38.390 
has 150 grams and this would usually
last<00:03:36.000> me<00:03:36.239> about<00:03:36.360> a<00:03:36.690> mile<00:03:36.900> not<00:03:37.049> too<00:03:37.410> pricey<00:03:38.040> but
