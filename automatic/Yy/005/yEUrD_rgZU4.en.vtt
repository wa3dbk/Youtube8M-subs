so let's imagine we were in the bathroom

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.600 
so let's imagine we were in the bathroom
here<00:00:29.550> and<00:00:29.730> I<00:00:30.599> like<00:00:31.140> prismarine<00:00:31.529> using<00:00:32.430> for

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
here and I like prismarine using for

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.310 
here and I like prismarine using for
bathroom<00:00:33.030> because<00:00:33.329> it<00:00:33.450> kinda<00:00:33.690> has<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:33.899> do<00:00:34.140> with

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
bathroom because it kinda has to do with

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.270 
bathroom because it kinda has to do with
water<00:00:34.590> I<00:00:34.920> also<00:00:35.370> like<00:00:35.670> this<00:00:36.020> turquoise<00:00:37.020> is<00:00:37.980> that

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
water I also like this turquoise is that

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.610 
water I also like this turquoise is that
how<00:00:38.489> you<00:00:38.550> say<00:00:38.850> it<00:00:38.910> I<00:00:39.120> think<00:00:39.600> so<00:00:39.750> took<00:00:39.809> for<00:00:40.379> his

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
how you say it I think so took for his

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.100 
how you say it I think so took for his
color<00:00:41.250> of<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.700> purse<00:00:41.910> Mary<00:00:42.149> I<00:00:42.390> think<00:00:42.540> it<00:00:42.930> looks

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
color of the purse Mary I think it looks

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.490 
color of the purse Mary I think it looks
really<00:00:43.170> nice<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:44.090> here<00:00:45.090> is<00:00:45.239> a<00:00:45.809> shower<00:00:46.200> curtain

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
really nice and here is a shower curtain

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.950 
really nice and here is a shower curtain
which<00:00:46.890> was<00:00:47.070> made<00:00:47.280> of<00:00:47.460> two<00:00:47.850> banners<00:00:48.120> which<00:00:48.780> are

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
which was made of two banners which are

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.069 
which was made of two banners which are
hanging<00:00:49.320> on<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:49.950> other<00:00:50.219> banners<00:00:50.850> because<00:00:51.239> the

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
hanging on to other banners because the

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.130 
hanging on to other banners because the
reason<00:00:52.710> is<00:00:52.980> if<00:00:53.579> we<00:00:53.940> grab<00:00:54.210> one<00:00:54.480> of<00:00:54.510> these<00:00:54.809> and

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
reason is if we grab one of these and

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.139 
reason is if we grab one of these and
place<00:00:55.350> it<00:00:55.530> on<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.770> ground<00:00:56.010> it<00:00:56.280> would<00:00:56.850> be<00:00:57.030> in

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
place it on the ground it would be in

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.209 
place it on the ground it would be in
the<00:00:57.270> middle<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:57.660> that<00:00:57.800> wouldn't<00:00:58.800> look<00:00:58.949> so

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
the middle and that wouldn't look so

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.400 
the middle and that wouldn't look so
nice<00:00:59.399> as<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.850> shower<00:01:00.059> curtain<00:01:00.510> so<00:01:00.960> I<00:01:00.989> had<00:01:01.289> to

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
nice as the shower curtain so I had to

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.470 
nice as the shower curtain so I had to
put<00:01:01.620> them<00:01:01.739> on<00:01:01.859> something<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.460> that<00:01:02.550> is<00:01:03.210> the

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
put them on something and that is the

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.060 
put them on something and that is the
banners<00:01:03.809> because<00:01:04.140> you<00:01:04.260> cannot<00:01:04.530> see<00:01:04.739> them<00:01:04.860> from

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
banners because you cannot see them from

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.810 
banners because you cannot see them from
outside<00:01:05.369> if<00:01:05.790> I<00:01:06.450> were<00:01:07.080> to<00:01:07.320> place<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.770> few<00:01:08.520> other

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
outside if I were to place a few other

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.630 
outside if I were to place a few other
blocks<00:01:09.150> there<00:01:09.479> it<00:01:09.840> would<00:01:10.290> look<00:01:10.590> bad<00:01:11.010> so<00:01:11.250> use

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
blocks there it would look bad so use

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.359 
blocks there it would look bad so use
other<00:01:11.970> banners<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:12.540> then<00:01:13.470> you<00:01:13.710> shall<00:01:13.979> be<00:01:14.040> good

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
other banners and then you shall be good

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.090 
other banners and then you shall be good
how<00:01:14.700> you<00:01:14.760> craft<00:01:15.119> them<00:01:15.360> is<00:01:15.479> fairly<00:01:16.110> simple<00:01:16.530> just

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
how you craft them is fairly simple just

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.640 
how you craft them is fairly simple just
use<00:01:17.189> white<00:01:17.820> banners<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.420> then<00:01:18.659> a<00:01:18.840> sigh<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:19.320> I

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
they look pretty fancy kind of like the

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.350 
they look pretty fancy kind of like the
real<00:01:37.560> ones<00:01:37.860> then<00:01:38.369> in<00:01:38.490> here<00:01:38.790> I've<00:01:38.939> got<00:01:38.970> some

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
real ones then in here I've got some

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.260 
real ones then in here I've got some
ages<00:01:39.950> just<00:01:40.950> like<00:01:41.189> in<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.400> movie<00:01:41.759> where<00:01:42.119> they

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
ages just like in a movie where they

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.179 
ages just like in a movie where they
don't<00:01:42.509> really<00:01:42.780> have<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.170> entire<00:01:43.530> houses<00:01:43.829> but

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
don't really have the entire houses but

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.190 
don't really have the entire houses but
just<00:01:44.460> it<00:01:44.640> seems<00:01:44.880> that<00:01:45.090> you<00:01:45.270> need<00:01:45.540> for<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:45.869> movie

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
just it seems that you need for a movie

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.889 
just it seems that you need for a movie
and<00:01:46.409> so<00:01:47.159> I've<00:01:47.460> got<00:01:47.759> that<00:01:47.970> it<00:01:48.180> looks<00:01:48.509> complete

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
and so I've got that it looks complete

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.850 
and so I've got that it looks complete
when<00:01:49.649> it<00:01:49.680> actually<00:01:50.280> isn't<00:01:50.689> fancy<00:01:51.689> isn't<00:01:52.320> it<00:01:52.409> so

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
when it actually isn't fancy isn't it so

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.010 
when it actually isn't fancy isn't it so
how<00:01:53.130> how<00:01:53.520> you<00:01:53.579> craft<00:01:53.970> them<00:01:54.210> is<00:01:54.390> also<00:01:54.659> fairly

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
how how you craft them is also fairly

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.770 
how how you craft them is also fairly
simple<00:01:55.470> we<00:01:55.920> use<00:01:56.130> red<00:01:56.610> banners<00:01:57.030> this<00:01:57.270> time<00:01:57.540> and

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
simple we use red banners this time and

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.080 
simple we use red banners this time and

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
while preparing very professional Nick

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.749 
while preparing very professional Nick
and<00:02:03.329> then<00:02:03.750> we<00:02:03.899> make<00:02:04.140> a<00:02:04.409> cross<00:02:04.740> just<00:02:05.310> like<00:02:05.430> that

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
and then we make a cross just like that

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.389 
and then we make a cross just like that
or<00:02:05.969> next<00:02:06.420> so<00:02:06.869> it<00:02:06.960> makes<00:02:07.259> an<00:02:07.530> X<00:02:07.829> on<00:02:08.099> the<00:02:08.220> banner

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
or next so it makes an X on the banner

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.760 
or next so it makes an X on the banner
itself<00:02:08.849> and<00:02:09.179> then<00:02:09.720> we<00:02:09.899> also<00:02:10.050> need<00:02:10.379> a<00:02:10.440> frame

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
itself and then we also need a frame

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.330 
itself and then we also need a frame
around<00:02:10.800> it<00:02:11.220> so<00:02:11.489> we<00:02:11.670> just<00:02:11.700> do<00:02:12.120> that<00:02:12.300> with

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
around it so we just do that with

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.050 
around it so we just do that with
and<00:02:13.430> then<00:02:14.240> we<00:02:14.420> got<00:02:14.630> the<00:02:15.020> barn<00:02:15.260> doors<00:02:16.060> cool

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
and then we got the barn doors cool

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.900 
and then we got the barn doors cool
right<00:02:17.930> let's<00:02:18.830> go<00:02:19.010> to<00:02:19.069> the<00:02:19.340> last<00:02:19.550> one<00:02:19.819> which<00:02:20.150> is

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
right let's go to the last one which is

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.420 
right let's go to the last one which is
kind<00:02:22.910> of<00:02:23.120> yeah<00:02:24.110> just<00:02:24.140> using<00:02:24.890> a<00:02:24.980> white<00:02:25.160> banner

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
kind of yeah just using a white banner

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.940 
kind of yeah just using a white banner
but<00:02:25.700> it<00:02:25.849> still<00:02:26.120> adds<00:02:26.360> to<00:02:26.720> the<00:02:26.870> effect<00:02:27.260> so<00:02:27.709> what

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
but it still adds to the effect so what

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.770 
but it still adds to the effect so what
is<00:02:28.190> this<00:02:28.610> supposed<00:02:29.030> to<00:02:29.120> be<00:02:29.209> you<00:02:29.420> may<00:02:29.600> ask

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
is this supposed to be you may ask

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.080 
is this supposed to be you may ask
yourself<00:02:29.959> well<00:02:30.680> it's<00:02:31.160> pretty<00:02:31.370> obvious<00:02:31.910> I

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
yourself well it's pretty obvious I

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.030

gonna be a link in the video description
as<00:03:19.400> well<00:03:19.430> I've<00:03:20.090> also<00:03:20.390> got<00:03:20.660> some<00:03:20.690> more<00:03:20.959> green<00:03:21.290> in

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
as well I've also got some more green in

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.860 
as well I've also got some more green in
here<00:03:21.709> with<00:03:21.950> as<00:03:22.160> large<00:03:22.430> fern<00:03:22.730> and<00:03:22.970> some<00:03:23.570> coarse

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
here with as large fern and some coarse

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.080 
here with as large fern and some coarse
dirt<00:03:24.320> the<00:03:24.799> floor<00:03:25.070> is<00:03:25.160> made<00:03:25.340> of<00:03:25.400> jungle<00:03:25.790> wood

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
dirt the floor is made of jungle wood

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.840 
dirt the floor is made of jungle wood
and<00:03:26.329> I<00:03:26.959> think<00:03:27.320> that<00:03:27.500> creates<00:03:27.980> a<00:03:28.220> really<00:03:28.549> nice

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
and I think that creates a really nice

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.910 
and I think that creates a really nice
scene<00:03:29.150> when<00:03:29.540> you<00:03:29.630> stand<00:03:29.930> in<00:03:30.019> here<00:03:30.260> it<00:03:30.620> looks

scene when you stand in here it looks

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.599 
scene when you stand in here it looks
