texture<00:00:40.390> then<00:00:40.690> otherwise<00:00:41.229> I<00:00:41.379> just<00:00:41.710> don't

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:41.979 
texture then otherwise I just don't

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:43.860 
texture then otherwise I just don't
understand<00:00:42.519> so<00:00:42.699> I<00:00:42.729> would<00:00:42.940> say<00:00:43.120> avoid<00:00:43.570> that

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870

to<00:00:46.870> buy<00:00:47.170> foundations<00:00:47.979> obviously<00:00:48.339> is<00:00:48.460> to<00:00:48.610> go

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:48.760 
to buy foundations obviously is to go

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.060

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.460 
into a department store or a drug store
and<00:00:51.309> actually<00:00:51.699> look<00:00:52.479> at<00:00:52.570> it<00:00:52.690> and<00:00:53.110> try<00:00:53.440> it

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:53.470 
and actually look at it and try it

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.310 
and actually look at it and try it
yourself<00:00:53.699> now<00:00:54.699> there<00:00:55.360> are<00:00:55.510> issues<00:00:56.019> with<00:00:56.049> that

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320 
yourself now there are issues with that

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.930 
yourself now there are issues with that

00:01:12.959 --> 00:01:12.969 
you can get a bit more of an idea but I

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:15.060 
you can get a bit more of an idea but I
still<00:01:13.210> don't<00:01:13.450> feel<00:01:13.659> that<00:01:13.899> you<00:01:14.170> can<00:01:14.590> experience
