inconsistency<00:01:58.780> so<00:01:59.780> i'm<00:02:00.290> going<00:02:00.350> to<00:02:00.440> say<00:02:00.560> keep

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
inconsistency so i'm going to say keep

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.040 
inconsistency so i'm going to say keep
changing<00:02:01.130> the<00:02:01.190> direction<00:02:01.340> of<00:02:01.640> the<00:02:01.760> trot<00:02:02.050> and

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.050 
changing the direction of the trot and

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:04.540 
changing the direction of the trot and
she's<00:02:03.350> going<00:02:03.470> to<00:02:03.560> soften<00:02:04.010> as<00:02:04.130> i<00:02:04.220> do<00:02:04.280> in<00:02:04.400> the

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:04.550 
she's going to soften as i do in the

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.310 
she's going to soften as i do in the
circle<00:02:04.940> so<00:02:05.180> what<00:02:05.300> I<00:02:05.360> mean<00:02:05.540> by<00:02:05.660> soften<00:02:06.110> is<00:02:06.230> you
