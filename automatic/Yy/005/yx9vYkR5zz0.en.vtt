the way over here if you go over to a
guard<00:03:48.720> and<00:03:50.660> you<00:03:51.660> kill<00:03:51.930> him<00:03:55.730> he<00:03:56.730> drops<00:03:57.000> a<00:03:57.150> tiny

stone<00:03:57.720> sword<00:03:58.760> so<00:03:59.760> I<00:03:59.790> don't<00:04:00.150> know<00:04:00.239> because<00:04:01.200> it

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
stone sword so I don't know because it

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.910 
stone sword so I don't know because it
doesn't<00:04:01.380> show<00:04:01.769> them<00:04:01.920> holding<00:04:02.310> it<00:04:02.459> or<00:04:02.610> not<00:04:02.780> but

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
doesn't show them holding it or not but

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.180 
doesn't show them holding it or not but
so<00:04:04.920> the<00:04:05.040> guard<00:04:05.250> tough<00:04:05.430> sword<00:04:05.760> and<00:04:07.010> those<00:04:08.010> are

so the guard tough sword and those are

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:11.509 
so the guard tough sword and those are
two<00:04:08.310> things<00:04:08.340> you<00:04:08.640> create<00:04:08.940> and<00:04:10.340> they<00:04:11.340> will

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519
