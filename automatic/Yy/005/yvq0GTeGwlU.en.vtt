give<00:04:26.370> you<00:04:26.460> few<00:04:27.390> shots<00:04:27.960> to<00:04:28.290> show<00:04:28.380> you<00:04:28.590> how<00:04:28.919> the

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:28.979 
give you few shots to show you how the

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:32.360 
give you few shots to show you how the
camera<00:04:29.490> actually<00:04:29.669> performs<00:04:30.770> so<00:04:31.770> this<00:04:31.950> one<00:04:32.160> was

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
camera actually performs so this one was

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.219 
camera actually performs so this one was
with<00:04:32.700> flash<00:04:32.940> let<00:04:33.270> me<00:04:33.419> turn<00:04:33.540> off<00:04:33.600> the<00:04:33.780> flash<00:04:33.990> and

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:34.229 
with flash let me turn off the flash and

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:38.150 
with flash let me turn off the flash and
try<00:04:34.800> again<00:04:36.380> so<00:04:37.380> these<00:04:37.500> are<00:04:37.680> the<00:04:37.770> pictures<00:04:37.919> that

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
try again so these are the pictures that

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.920 
try again so these are the pictures that
we<00:04:38.490> played<00:04:38.700> right<00:04:38.910> now<00:04:38.970> and<00:04:39.450> the<00:04:39.600> pictures

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
we played right now and the pictures

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.590 
we played right now and the pictures
come<00:04:40.140> out<00:04:40.229> to<00:04:40.410> be<00:04:40.530> good<00:04:41.280> the<00:04:41.550> display<00:04:42.060> gives<00:04:42.419> a

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
come out to be good the display gives a

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.190 
come out to be good the display gives a
very<00:04:42.930> good<00:04:43.229> natural<00:04:43.620> color<00:04:44.190> reproduction<00:04:44.850> the

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:45.200 
very good natural color reproduction the

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.690 
very good natural color reproduction the
saturation<00:04:46.200> of<00:04:46.470> the<00:04:46.500> display<00:04:46.890> is<00:04:47.100> just<00:04:47.490> about

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:47.700 
saturation of the display is just about

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.300 
saturation of the display is just about
right<00:04:48.229> let<00:04:49.229> me<00:04:49.260> also<00:04:49.500> show<00:04:49.800> you<00:04:49.860> the<00:04:50.130> video

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
right let me also show you the video

00:04:50.310 --> 00:05:06.200 
right let me also show you the video
playback<00:04:50.669> quality<00:04:50.940> I'll<00:04:51.510> turn<00:04:51.840> the<00:04:52.020> volume<00:05:05.210> we

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
playback quality I'll turn the volume we

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.030 
playback quality I'll turn the volume we
can<00:05:06.360> see<00:05:06.540> the<00:05:06.630> colors<00:05:06.960> come<00:05:07.290> out<00:05:07.410> really<00:05:07.710> live

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:08.040 
can see the colors come out really live

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.190 
can see the colors come out really live
on<00:05:08.340> video<00:05:08.669> playback<00:05:08.850> so<00:05:09.180> this<00:05:09.330> is<00:05:09.479> a<00:05:09.690> really

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:10.200 
on video playback so this is a really

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.500 
on video playback so this is a really
nice<00:05:10.380> multimedia<00:05:11.010> device<00:05:11.250> and<00:05:11.580> the<00:05:12.090> speakers

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:12.510 
nice multimedia device and the speakers

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:13.959 
nice multimedia device and the speakers
are<00:05:12.750> also<00:05:12.990> fairly<00:05:13.530> loud

00:05:13.959 --> 00:05:13.969 
are also fairly loud

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:16.179 
are also fairly loud
the<00:05:14.029> speaker<00:05:14.389> grille<00:05:14.599> is<00:05:14.779> provided<00:05:15.229> at<00:05:15.769> the

00:05:16.179 --> 00:05:16.189 
the speaker grille is provided at the

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:19.029 
the speaker grille is provided at the
rear<00:05:16.369> bottom<00:05:17.059> here<00:05:17.329> with<00:05:17.809> flower<00:05:18.589> grinding

00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:19.039 
rear bottom here with flower grinding

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:20.919 
rear bottom here with flower grinding
just<00:05:19.279> above<00:05:19.549> it<00:05:19.729> and<00:05:19.879> there<00:05:20.389> is<00:05:20.629> a<00:05:20.659> small

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:20.929 
just above it and there is a small

00:05:20.929 --> 00:05:23.319 
just above it and there is a small
protrusion<00:05:21.739> around<00:05:22.339> the<00:05:22.489> speaker<00:05:22.789> which<00:05:23.029> is<00:05:23.059> a

00:05:23.319 --> 00:05:23.329 
protrusion around the speaker which is a

00:05:23.329 --> 00:05:25.029 
protrusion around the speaker which is a
very<00:05:23.629> clever<00:05:23.779> design<00:05:23.989> because<00:05:24.499> when<00:05:24.679> you<00:05:24.769> put

00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:25.039 
very clever design because when you put

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:27.639 
very clever design because when you put
it<00:05:25.189> on<00:05:25.789> a<00:05:25.849> flat<00:05:26.089> surface<00:05:26.119> it<00:05:26.719> will<00:05:26.869> not<00:05:27.110> muffle

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:27.649 
it on a flat surface it will not muffle

00:05:27.649 --> 00:05:29.289 
it on a flat surface it will not muffle
the<00:05:27.799> speaker's<00:05:28.309> if<00:05:28.729> there<00:05:28.939> are<00:05:29.059> no

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:29.299 
the speaker's if there are no

00:05:29.299 --> 00:05:31.539 
the speaker's if there are no
protrusions<00:05:30.169> here<00:05:30.409> it<00:05:30.649> will<00:05:30.829> be<00:05:30.979> muffled<00:05:31.429> and

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:31.549 
protrusions here it will be muffled and

00:05:31.549 --> 00:05:33.699 
protrusions here it will be muffled and
the<00:05:31.699> sound<00:05:31.909> will<00:05:32.089> not<00:05:32.119> come<00:05:32.479> so<00:05:32.929> I<00:05:33.139> must<00:05:33.649> say

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:33.709 
the sound will not come so I must say

00:05:33.709 --> 00:05:35.879 
the sound will not come so I must say
this<00:05:33.889> is<00:05:34.039> an<00:05:34.159> excellent<00:05:34.519> designing<00:05:34.969> from<00:05:35.179> lava

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:35.889 
this is an excellent designing from lava

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:43.209 
Android 4.2 jellybean preloaded and
there<00:05:41.029> is<00:05:41.149> your<00:05:41.869> update<00:05:42.049> support<00:05:42.559> you<00:05:43.069> can

00:05:43.209 --> 00:05:43.219 
there is your update support you can

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:44.919 
there is your update support you can
scroll<00:05:43.519> around<00:05:43.669> with<00:05:44.059> two<00:05:44.209> fingers<00:05:44.389> to<00:05:44.569> get

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:44.929 
scroll around with two fingers to get

00:05:44.929 --> 00:05:47.289 
scroll around with two fingers to get
the<00:05:45.079> quick<00:05:45.259> toggles<00:05:45.469> and<00:05:45.860> one<00:05:46.129> finger<00:05:46.489> to<00:05:47.089> get

the<00:05:47.449> notifications<00:05:48.169> there<00:05:48.589> is<00:05:48.709> also<00:05:48.919> one

00:05:49.329 --> 00:05:49.339 
the notifications there is also one

00:05:49.339 --> 00:05:51.309 
the notifications there is also one
extra<00:05:49.849> feature<00:05:49.999> added<00:05:50.329> which<00:05:50.659> is<00:05:50.779> the<00:05:50.899> CPU

00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:51.319 
extra feature added which is the CPU

00:05:51.319 --> 00:05:53.469 
extra feature added which is the CPU
rate<00:05:51.529> so<00:05:51.919> you<00:05:51.949> can<00:05:52.159> actually<00:05:52.369> see<00:05:52.759> what<00:05:53.269> is<00:05:53.360> the

00:05:53.469 --> 00:05:53.479 
rate so you can actually see what is the

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:56.649 
rate so you can actually see what is the
CPU<00:05:53.839> utilization<00:05:54.259> it<00:05:54.799> also<00:05:55.009> uses<00:05:55.509> CPUC<00:05:56.509> which

00:05:56.649 --> 00:05:56.659 
CPU utilization it also uses CPUC which

00:05:56.659 --> 00:05:58.929 
CPU utilization it also uses CPUC which
is<00:05:56.809> an<00:05:56.929> optimized<00:05:57.589> display<00:05:58.189> technology<00:05:58.759> which

00:05:58.929 --> 00:05:58.939 
is an optimized display technology which

00:05:58.939 --> 00:06:01.149 
is an optimized display technology which
reduces<00:05:59.479> the<00:05:59.659> battery<00:05:59.959> usage<00:06:00.259> which<00:06:00.889> gives

00:06:01.149 --> 00:06:01.159 
reduces the battery usage which gives

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:02.679 
reduces the battery usage which gives
you<00:06:01.279> extra<00:06:01.429> battery<00:06:01.939> there<00:06:02.089> is<00:06:02.209> 2000

00:06:02.679 --> 00:06:02.689 
you extra battery there is 2000
