this<00:00:01.590> is<00:00:01.740> our<00:00:01.890> new<00:00:02.129> virtual<00:00:02.700> Anatomy<00:00:03.419> table

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
this is our new virtual Anatomy table

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.529 
this is our new virtual Anatomy table
called<00:00:04.080> anatomage<00:00:04.769> and<00:00:05.180> anatomize<00:00:06.209> is<00:00:06.509> a

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:06.539 
called anatomage and anatomize is a

00:00:06.539 --> 00:00:09.589 
called anatomage and anatomize is a
virtual<00:00:07.410> cadaver<00:00:07.829> this<00:00:08.580> is<00:00:08.759> an<00:00:08.969> actual

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
virtual cadaver this is an actual

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.049 
virtual cadaver this is an actual
cadaver<00:00:10.139> there's<00:00:10.530> a<00:00:10.589> male<00:00:10.799> and<00:00:11.009> a<00:00:11.070> female<00:00:11.099> that

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
cadaver there's a male and a female that

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.690 
cadaver there's a male and a female that
have<00:00:12.360> been<00:00:12.690> rendered<00:00:13.080> into<00:00:13.530> 3d<00:00:13.709> that<00:00:14.549> the

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
have been rendered into 3d that the

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.759 
have been rendered into 3d that the
students<00:00:15.150> can<00:00:15.299> then<00:00:15.329> manipulate<00:00:16.110> so<00:00:16.439> they<00:00:16.590> can

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:16.769 
students can then manipulate so they can

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:19.820 
students can then manipulate so they can
rotate<00:00:16.980> them<00:00:17.400> they<00:00:18.029> can<00:00:18.410> virtually<00:00:19.410> dissect

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
rotate them they can virtually dissect

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.279 
rotate them they can virtually dissect
them<00:00:20.070> they<00:00:20.640> can<00:00:20.820> essentially<00:00:21.240> do<00:00:21.630> the<00:00:21.990> kinds

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
them they can essentially do the kinds

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:23.900 
them they can essentially do the kinds
of<00:00:22.349> things<00:00:22.590> they<00:00:22.769> can<00:00:22.920> do<00:00:23.070> in<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.369> anatomy<00:00:23.580> lab

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
of things they can do in the anatomy lab

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.509 
of things they can do in the anatomy lab
yeah<00:00:24.539> and<00:00:24.929> how<00:00:25.140> you<00:00:25.289> slice<00:00:25.529> them<00:00:25.740> you<00:00:26.369> can

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
yeah and how you slice them you can

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.050 
yeah and how you slice them you can
change<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:26.939> depth<00:00:27.150> of<00:00:27.330> your<00:00:27.420> cut<00:00:28.820> we<00:00:29.820> choose

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
change the depth of your cut we choose

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.470 
change the depth of your cut we choose
the<00:00:30.240> part<00:00:31.130> we<00:00:32.130> think<00:00:32.400> it<00:00:32.550> is<00:00:32.580> incredibly

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
the part we think it is incredibly

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.480 
the part we think it is incredibly
functional<00:00:33.810> it<00:00:34.590> allows<00:00:34.920> students<00:00:35.400> to

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:35.490 
functional it allows students to

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:47.930 
functional it allows students to
visualize<00:00:36.050> tissues<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.380> multiple<00:00:38.010> views<00:00:46.940> you

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
visualize tissues and multiple views you

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.100 
visualize tissues and multiple views you
can<00:00:48.000> see<00:00:48.240> the<00:00:48.390> body<00:00:48.510> from<00:00:48.720> a<00:00:48.780> bunch<00:00:49.020> of

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
can see the body from a bunch of

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.960 
can see the body from a bunch of
different<00:00:49.170> angles<00:00:49.650> and<00:00:49.860> that<00:00:50.310> really<00:00:50.550> allows

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:50.970 
different angles and that really allows

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.020 
different angles and that really allows
you<00:00:51.150> to<00:00:51.240> appreciate<00:00:51.450> some<00:00:51.900> of<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.020> structures

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
you to appreciate some of the structures

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.520 
you to appreciate some of the structures
being<00:00:54.030> able<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.240> manipulate<00:00:54.390> have<00:00:55.260> things

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
being able to manipulate have things

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.890 
being able to manipulate have things
labeled<00:00:56.070> I<00:00:56.370> think<00:00:57.090> there's<00:00:57.240> a<00:00:57.330> really<00:00:57.660> cool

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:57.900 
labeled I think there's a really cool

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.600 
labeled I think there's a really cool
learning<00:00:58.140> experience<00:00:58.890> it's<00:00:59.040> very<00:00:59.160> much<00:00:59.580> like

00:00:59.600 --> 00:00:59.610 
learning experience it's very much like

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.790 
learning experience it's very much like
an<00:00:59.970> iPad<00:01:00.360> these<00:01:00.570> are<00:01:00.690> touchscreens<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:01.620> so

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
an iPad these are touchscreens and so

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.160 
an iPad these are touchscreens and so
they<00:01:01.950> can<00:01:02.160> be<00:01:02.310> expanded<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.450> aorta<00:01:04.019> you

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
they can be expanded to the aorta you

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.719 
they can be expanded to the aorta you
can<00:01:04.320> see<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.710> ascending<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:05.700> descending

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
can see the ascending and descending

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.620 
can see the ascending and descending
aorta<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:07.320> resolution<00:01:08.009> is<00:01:08.390> beautiful<00:01:09.390> so

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
aorta the resolution is beautiful so

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.149 
aorta the resolution is beautiful so
you're<00:01:09.780> looking<00:01:09.869> at<00:01:10.079> these<00:01:10.170> really<00:01:10.500> nice

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
you're looking at these really nice

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.130 
you're looking at these really nice
images<00:01:11.729> you<00:01:12.179> can<00:01:12.270> now<00:01:12.420> see<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.689> liver<00:01:12.929> the

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
images you can now see the liver the

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.840 
images you can now see the liver the
stomach<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.679> spleen<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:13.979> gallbladder<00:01:14.640> is

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
stomach the spleen the gallbladder is

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.999 
stomach the spleen the gallbladder is
there<00:01:15.090> like<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.329> control<00:01:15.749> fine<00:01:16.020> feature<00:01:16.289> go

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
there like a control fine feature go

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.499 
there like a control fine feature go
ahead<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.249> search<00:01:17.429> put<00:01:18.090> in<00:01:18.179> something<00:01:18.390> that

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
ahead and search put in something that

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.569 
ahead and search put in something that
you<00:01:18.630> can<00:01:18.749> actually<00:01:18.899> see<00:01:19.229> gastrin<00:01:20.009> Amyas

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:20.579 
you can actually see gastrin Amyas

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:23.480 
you can actually see gastrin Amyas
it's<00:01:20.999> a<00:01:21.060> terrible<00:01:21.390> spelling<00:01:21.950> and<00:01:22.950> lamb<00:01:23.219> you

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
it's a terrible spelling and lamb you

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.399 
it's a terrible spelling and lamb you
see<00:01:23.759> I<00:01:24.090> could<00:01:24.420> have<00:01:24.600> her<00:01:24.749> but<00:01:24.899> a<00:01:24.929> lot<00:01:25.140> of<00:01:25.229> times

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
see I could have her but a lot of times

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:26.810 
see I could have her but a lot of times
you<00:01:25.560> have<00:01:25.649> been<00:01:25.679> dissected<00:01:26.249> all<00:01:26.399> the<00:01:26.520> way<00:01:26.609> down

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
you have been dissected all the way down

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.730 
you have been dissected all the way down
so<00:01:27.119> being<00:01:27.570> able<00:01:27.719> to<00:01:27.899> see<00:01:28.259> all<00:01:28.499> different

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
so being able to see all different

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.520 
so being able to see all different
orientations<00:01:29.670> at<00:01:29.850> once<00:01:30.060> is<00:01:30.569> great<00:01:31.079> or<00:01:31.289> here's

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
orientations at once is great or here's

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.739 
orientations at once is great or here's
your<00:01:31.649> septum<00:01:32.039> here<00:01:32.340> interatrial<00:01:32.850> septum<00:01:32.969> here

00:01:33.739 --> 00:01:33.749 
your septum here interatrial septum here

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:35.389 
your septum here interatrial septum here
here<00:01:34.079> and<00:01:34.200> here<00:01:34.259> translating<00:01:35.069> what<00:01:35.219> they<00:01:35.340> see

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:35.399 
here and here translating what they see

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:37.340 
here and here translating what they see
in<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.789> anatomy<00:01:36.030> lab<00:01:36.390> into<00:01:36.719> the

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
in the anatomy lab into the

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.200 
in the anatomy lab into the
cross-sectional<00:01:38.039> news<00:01:38.280> that<00:01:38.520> they'll<00:01:38.670> see<00:01:38.909> in

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
cross-sectional news that they'll see in

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.830 
cross-sectional news that they'll see in
radiology<00:01:39.960> MRI<00:01:40.770> images<00:01:41.310> CT<00:01:41.729> images<00:01:42.240> can<00:01:42.810> be

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
radiology MRI images CT images can be

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.050 
radiology MRI images CT images can be
challenging<00:01:43.499> so<00:01:43.710> our<00:01:44.159> hope<00:01:44.369> is<00:01:44.579> that<00:01:44.609> the

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
challenging so our hope is that the

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.660 
challenging so our hope is that the
virtual<00:01:45.450> Anatomy<00:01:46.139> table<00:01:46.649> is<00:01:46.829> a<00:01:46.859> great<00:01:47.310> way<00:01:47.609> to

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
virtual Anatomy table is a great way to

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.580 
virtual Anatomy table is a great way to
bridge<00:01:48.179> the<00:01:48.389> gap<00:01:48.569> between<00:01:48.600> what<00:01:49.139> they<00:01:49.259> see<00:01:49.469> in

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
bridge the gap between what they see in

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.190 
bridge the gap between what they see in
a<00:01:49.649> gross

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
a gross

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.139 
a gross
and<00:01:50.289> and<00:01:50.829> what<00:01:51.039> they'll<00:01:51.219> see<00:01:51.490> for<00:01:51.789> the<00:01:51.850> rest<00:01:52.030> of

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:52.149 
and and what they'll see for the rest of

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:54.330 
and and what they'll see for the rest of
their<00:01:52.270> careers<00:01:52.659> it's<00:01:53.170> more<00:01:53.380> interactive<00:01:54.009> and

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
their careers it's more interactive and

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.670 
their careers it's more interactive and
I<00:01:54.579> think<00:01:54.759> it's<00:01:54.880> a<00:01:54.969> really<00:01:55.119> good<00:01:55.360> learning<00:01:55.680> I

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 
I think it's a really good learning I

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.640 
I think it's a really good learning I
think<00:01:56.920> it's<00:01:57.009> gonna<00:01:57.130> be<00:01:57.250> a<00:01:57.280> great<00:01:57.430> thing
