00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.910
 hi to everyone this is another video on 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:07.910
 car and chery amulet 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:19.010
 show tidy so we have tidy 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.010
 here is chery amulet 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:32.730
 according to the rule 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:37.800
 something like this in this tidy not 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:41.280
 tachometer does not respond at all 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:46.710
 as if polazil on forums this friend bought 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:49.739
 the machine does not work tachometer come in two 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.100
 type of devices we say we have 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:56.969
 they are different stepper motor here it is 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.480
 stepper motors speedometer level 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.600
 fuel 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:06.080
 temperature and tachometer works by 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:11.310
 principle 3 clockwork 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:16.280
 2 reels cost 1 2 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.280
 gear 1 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:24.150
 2 window are three small 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:28.140
 with a magnet well and fourth here 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:31.050
 Naturally, the dream is not taken apart 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.180
 no difficulty 3 4 small bolts 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.160
 learn tidy at all on 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:42.210
 snaps that is massive such 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:48.690
 the sounds of the slider are so powerful 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:52.760
 Clamp what cost that is disassembled by 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:55.979
 the main problem is obtained 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:02:00.290
 breaks the coil that is roughly speaking 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.290
 now if you want to remove everything 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:18.580
 Meets in general, here is one leg and here 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:20.800
 the second leg here and here is the same 2 this 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.600
 the coil she is alive it died usually 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.850
 break their wiring to the camera 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.230
 Naturally I can not remove that is here with 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.920
 this reel is winding 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:32.110
 goes she breaks off near the legs here 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.180
 either here well or on that here 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.209
 broke off here on this reel and 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.670
 broke unfortunately right below the 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:41.950
 because winding somewhere here with the edge 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.600
 there is no way to solder it 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:47.020
 provided possible at 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.670
 least home remedies that is 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:52.000
 simple soldering iron standards and so 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:55.420
 further even if you vypayat completely 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.600
 remove I can not change it solder 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.370
 I met another reel on 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.860
 forum that a man tried to change 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.680
 it does not work that is, under the replacement 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:08.950
 stepper motor that's the thing is that 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.390
 in Russia you can buy from 250 rubles 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.670
 I've been watching this in the morning 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.070
 Ukraine find it almost impossible 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.350
 because tachometer this car while 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.500
 will not work 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:24.640
 Well, except that with the disassembly somewhere broken 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:27.580
 there that is somewhere you understand with what that 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.590
 another about why i'm shooting a video 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.630
 because so many people write that we 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:36.239
 very hard to collect it then back 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:39.580
 this is such a dream business that you should 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:42.190
 put this gear here 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.740
 now so about just want to be a 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.440
 I will not be kind to play on 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:48.600
 that's somehow so it will be so no there is 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:53.040
 position so here is an example of awake fingers 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:55.830
 can reduce but on this part of you 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:04:01.800
 you need to wear this gear and clothes 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:06.080
 its like this is just taking 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:08.760
 let's say and here and so insert that is 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.950
 you will not succeed in you 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:14.870
 recorded the mechanism and then he now 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:17.070
 and then well, just will not spin 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:21.390
 Yes, and you can not download it 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:24.560
 solid meaning to yourself is that this 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:28.740
 a small gear that's here now is 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:31.920
 Sister put first here here 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:33.420
 about here you can see two points black here 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.520
 nothing is fixed simply 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:37.770
 level exactly but flat 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.670
 the surface of the horse is this gear very 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.010
 at first here 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:43.770
 this align this example and then later 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:47.880
 don't move and dress everything this 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:51.480
 lid and then it will stand exactly 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:52.550
 Well, it should not shaking hands rudely 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:55.650
 speaking and 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:57.510
 try hard not long to suffer but 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.370
 let's say it all really do nothing 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:00.900
 it is not necessary to unsolder as they say that 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:03.210
 but be sure to paint a stepper motor 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:05.850
 and collect it on your hands start otherwise you 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:07.920
 I will not collect him yesterday in my arms right in 

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:09.540
 car in the garage and the mouth parsed collected 

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:12.330
 repeatedly that is it can be done 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:14.730
 it's just that you first need to set these 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.690
 two gears will turn out exactly I then 

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:17.880
 through 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:20.580
 but roughly speaking when you attach through 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:23.040
 chink will see whether these 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:25.410
 here is strike 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:27.990
 in their seats and then she 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:30.180
 will sit down then she will sit down normally and nothing 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:33.150
 bite will not be well unfortunately we 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:37.970
 it is tidy like a tachometer 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:40.470
 it's like all I wanted to show 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:42.420
 so that people understand what kind of running gear 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:44.610
 engines Vika Kotova looks where 

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:47.460
 climb and what happens when it stops 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:50.220
 work one or the other mechanism also 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:53.790
 if someone is here still climb well, 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:56.700
 let's say take a torpedo and so on 

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:57.300
 slightly literally there on the screwdriver on 

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:59.790
 edge 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:01.680
 Well, that is, if you decide all the same 

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:03.840
 disassemble you already have some noise 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.940
 they can be a bit of some kind of mask 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:08.520
 one that is not thick does not freeze 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:10.680
 just dangerous how to mechanism 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:14.640
 plastic nice touch id then starts 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:17.370
 rumble and then stop working but 

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:20.400
 without need I would not climb honest 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:25.370
 a word because all thanks for 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:25.370
 attention and see you
