00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.170
 I came and this super fun spongebob 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.609
 nail art 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.020
 and I'm going to show you how today 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.670
 simple and easy this nail art 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.529
 actually is 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.970
 first I painted my nails with 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.400
 lemon face 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.349
 this beautiful pastel yellow nail polish 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.119
 china 'i read i have two of them here 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.369
 layers applied and leave completely 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.219
 I will use drying for the nail art 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.630
 make in my a2 consultation hours and that is 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.820
 a plate with all pictures of it 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.890
 spongebob and I'm going 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.530
 his face stamping you and on my 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.039
 the other name shines these spots 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.320
 stamp and face are you going to do with 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:51.629
 black stamp varnish and the spots with 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.870
 dark yellow stamp machelen bring some 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.420
 of the dark yellow ink on the 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.489
 yes for the spots say the sponge 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.870
 then I get my scraping 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.359
 over it 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:07.430
 I press my ink pad and then 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.430
 sitting dots on the inkpad 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.020
 and then I just need it over my nail 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.100
 I will do that one more time because I 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.840
 it thinks it is a bit low 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.560
 I fill it with black ink 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:27.290
 face of spongebob 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.290
 here too the scraper link here 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.240
 I press the green side of it 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:40.530
 inkpad that she put it on my 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:41.759
 stamp cushion in which I put on 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.729
 my nail 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:48.000
 I still make a number of those yes 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:50.850
 holes of the sponge also 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.590
 at spongebob you suck something around him 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.590
 more to give real effect 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.250
 and the cloth above his eyes is still running 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.409
 once with a very big doating 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:05.100
 I'll go in a white color 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:07.020
 and I used here for stamp varnish 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.810

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.340
 in 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:13.280
 or to his eyes first in and later 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:17.000

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.780

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.360
 blue paint 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.360
 I then put the color in his eyes 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:37.120
 and then and I with black stamp 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.820
