fourteen piece of plexiglass and what
I've<00:01:04.189> done<00:01:04.460> with<00:01:04.850> a<00:01:04.879> Sharpie<00:01:05.540> permanent

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
I've done with a Sharpie permanent

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.880 
I've done with a Sharpie permanent
Sharpie<00:01:06.590> is<00:01:06.920> I've<00:01:07.670> measured<00:01:08.120> out<00:01:08.890> I've

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
Sharpie is I've measured out I've

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.640 
Sharpie is I've measured out I've
divided<00:01:10.400> it<00:01:11.229> vertically<00:01:12.229> and<00:01:12.350> horizontally

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650

divided it vertically and horizontally
and<00:01:13.430> then<00:01:13.670> divided<00:01:14.630> that<00:01:14.840> again<00:01:15.440> to<00:01:16.400> make<00:01:16.820> the

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
and then divided that again to make the

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.750 
and then divided that again to make the
square<00:01:17.360> so<00:01:17.840> yeah<00:01:18.740> you'll<00:01:19.070> want<00:01:19.280> to<00:01:19.400> do<00:01:19.549> that

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:19.760 
square so yeah you'll want to do that

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.840 
square so yeah you'll want to do that
you<00:01:20.060> want<00:01:20.240> to<00:01:20.330> get<00:01:20.420> a<00:01:20.450> piece<00:01:20.690> of<00:01:20.870> pec<00:01:21.049> Plexiglas

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
you want to get a piece of pec Plexiglas

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.490 
you want to get a piece of pec Plexiglas
measured<00:01:22.850> out<00:01:23.060> correctly<00:01:23.720> so<00:01:23.960> that<00:01:24.140> you<00:01:24.260> have

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.100 
measured out correctly so that you have
your<00:01:24.530> squares<00:01:25.040> and<00:01:25.460> then<00:01:26.330> you<00:01:26.780> can<00:01:26.960> actually

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
your squares and then you can actually

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.920 
your squares and then you can actually
trace<00:01:27.650> this<00:01:28.100> whole<00:01:28.400> thing<00:01:28.700> onto<00:01:28.880> a<00:01:29.299> piece<00:01:29.750> of

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:37.760 
of the Plexiglas

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.840 
of the Plexiglas
with<00:01:38.330> the<00:01:38.479> same<00:01:38.690> size<00:01:38.930> squares<00:01:39.350> so<00:01:40.280> I'm<00:01:40.610> just

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
with the same size squares so I'm just

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.630 
with the same size squares so I'm just
about<00:01:41.090> ready<00:01:41.150> I've<00:01:41.960> set<00:01:42.409> up<00:01:42.440> the<00:01:42.680> Plexiglas<00:01:43.310> in

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
about ready I've set up the Plexiglas in

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.649 
about ready I've set up the Plexiglas in
front<00:01:44.030> of<00:01:44.299> the<00:01:44.510> still<00:01:44.750> life<00:01:46.390> set<00:01:47.390> it<00:01:47.540> up

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
front of the still life set it up

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:49.420 
front of the still life set it up
vertically<00:01:48.080> on<00:01:48.290> those<00:01:48.439> two<00:01:48.680> pieces<00:01:48.860> of<00:01:49.100> clay

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
vertically on those two pieces of clay

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.190 
vertically on those two pieces of clay
pinch<00:01:49.850> the<00:01:50.030> clay<00:01:50.150> together<00:01:50.540> so<00:01:50.780> it<00:01:50.869> doesn't

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
pinch the clay together so it doesn't

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.350 
pinch the clay together so it doesn't
flop<00:01:51.549> down<00:01:52.549> which<00:01:52.850> can<00:01:53.030> be<00:01:53.150> very

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
flop down which can be very

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.240 
flop down which can be very
disheartening<00:01:54.049> now<00:01:54.229> you<00:01:54.290> want<00:01:54.680> that<00:01:54.890> to<00:01:55.100> be

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
disheartening now you want that to be

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.460 
disheartening now you want that to be
fairly<00:01:55.670> you<00:01:56.000> want<00:01:56.180> that<00:01:56.390> to<00:01:56.510> be<00:01:56.630> stable<00:01:57.200> and

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
fairly you want that to be stable and

to<00:02:06.820> start<00:02:07.060> drawing<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:09.160> tricky<00:02:09.430> thing<00:02:09.670> about

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
to start drawing the tricky thing about

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.730 
to start drawing the tricky thing about
it<00:02:10.090> is<00:02:10.240> you<00:02:10.360> when<00:02:10.960> you<00:02:11.080> start<00:02:11.380> drawing<00:02:11.560> you

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
it is you when you start drawing you

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.230 
it is you when you start drawing you
really<00:02:12.010> don't<00:02:12.190> want<00:02:12.340> to<00:02:12.400> move<00:02:12.610> you<00:02:12.940> want<00:02:12.970> to

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
really don't want to move you want to

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.290 
really don't want to move you want to
keep<00:02:13.480> as<00:02:13.750> as<00:02:14.350> still<00:02:15.160> as<00:02:15.340> possible<00:02:15.370> because<00:02:16.030> if

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
keep as as still as possible because if

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.810 
keep as as still as possible because if
you<00:02:16.420> move<00:02:16.630> your<00:02:16.900> whole<00:02:17.110> reference<00:02:17.770> of<00:02:17.980> the

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
you move your whole reference of the

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.030 
you move your whole reference of the
still<00:02:19.090> life<00:02:19.300> behind<00:02:19.810> the<00:02:19.990> plexiglass<00:02:20.650> moves

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
still life behind the plexiglass moves

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.910 
still life behind the plexiglass moves
so<00:02:21.970> I<00:02:22.270> tell<00:02:22.510> my<00:02:22.660> students<00:02:23.050> always<00:02:23.470> to<00:02:23.650> start

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
so I tell my students always to start

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.700 
so I tell my students always to start
with<00:02:24.190> one<00:02:24.820> square<00:02:25.270> and<00:02:25.570> that<00:02:26.050> will<00:02:26.260> be<00:02:26.410> kind<00:02:26.590> of

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710 
with one square and that will be kind of

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.830 
with one square and that will be kind of
your<00:02:26.890> main<00:02:27.100> reference<00:02:27.640> so<00:02:27.880> I'm<00:02:28.540> going<00:02:28.780> to

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
your main reference so I'm going to

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.780 
your main reference so I'm going to
start<00:02:29.110> with<00:02:29.290> this<00:02:29.440> this<00:02:29.800> square<00:02:30.190> on<00:02:30.430> the<00:02:30.580> left

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
start with this this square on the left

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.010 
start with this this square on the left
here<00:02:31.590> and<00:02:32.590> I'm<00:02:32.860> just<00:02:32.890> drawing<00:02:33.370> an<00:02:33.760> angle<00:02:34.540> in

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
here and I'm just drawing an angle in

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.430 
here and I'm just drawing an angle in
that<00:02:35.230> square<00:02:35.590> which<00:02:35.770> is<00:02:35.800> the<00:02:36.250> table<00:02:37.440> just

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
that square which is the table just

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.970 
that square which is the table just
sketching<00:02:38.950> it<00:02:39.070> in<00:02:39.250> and<00:02:40.260> then<00:02:41.260> part<00:02:41.680> of<00:02:41.860> the

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
sketching it in and then part of the

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.770 
sketching it in and then part of the
sweet<00:02:42.250> potato<00:02:42.670> which<00:02:43.210> is<00:02:44.520> that<00:02:45.520> kind<00:02:46.270> of<00:02:46.480> shape

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
sweet potato which is that kind of shape

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.360 
sweet potato which is that kind of shape
in<00:02:47.110> the<00:02:47.260> square<00:02:47.590> like<00:02:47.830> that<00:02:49.170> very<00:02:50.170> simple<00:02:50.500> very

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
in the square like that very simple very

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:57.600 
in the square like that very simple very
easy<00:02:51.550> to<00:02:51.850> do<00:02:52.980> then<00:02:53.980> I<00:02:54.400> have<00:02:56.160> some<00:02:57.160> of<00:02:57.280> the<00:02:57.370> towel

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
easy to do then I have some of the towel

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.370 
easy to do then I have some of the towel
here<00:02:58.030> this<00:02:58.330> is<00:02:58.480> what<00:02:58.660> I'm<00:02:58.780> seeing<00:02:58.990> through

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
here this is what I'm seeing through

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:06.630 
here this is what I'm seeing through
that<00:02:59.560> one<00:02:59.950> square<00:03:00.730> okay<00:03:03.990> and<00:03:05.400> that's<00:03:06.400> pretty

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
that one square okay and that's pretty

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.540 
that one square okay and that's pretty
much<00:03:06.790> it<00:03:07.180> now<00:03:07.390> that<00:03:07.660> was<00:03:07.810> easy<00:03:08.080> and<00:03:08.440> the<00:03:09.340> nice

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550 
much it now that was easy and the nice

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:11.220 
much it now that was easy and the nice
thing<00:03:09.580> now<00:03:10.000> is<00:03:10.239> that<00:03:10.420> I<00:03:10.450> can<00:03:10.660> move<00:03:10.840> a<00:03:11.020> little

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
thing now is that I can move a little

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.010 
thing now is that I can move a little
bit<00:03:11.530> if<00:03:12.010> I<00:03:12.220> sneeze<00:03:12.610> or<00:03:12.940> something<00:03:13.330> nothing<00:03:13.750> is

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.020 
bit if I sneeze or something nothing is

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.140 
bit if I sneeze or something nothing is
gonna<00:03:14.140> be<00:03:14.350> too<00:03:14.500> upset<00:03:14.530> because<00:03:15.070> I'm<00:03:15.850> using

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
gonna be too upset because I'm using

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.150 
gonna be too upset because I'm using
this<00:03:16.450> square<00:03:16.750> is<00:03:16.840> my<00:03:17.020> little<00:03:17.290> I'm<00:03:17.620> taking<00:03:18.070> a

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
this square is my little I'm taking a

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.430 
this square is my little I'm taking a
minute<00:03:18.190> to<00:03:18.760> show<00:03:19.239> you<00:03:19.300> a<00:03:19.450> little<00:03:19.930> bit<00:03:20.050> closer

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
minute to show you a little bit closer

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.650 
minute to show you a little bit closer
look<00:03:20.830> at<00:03:21.040> what<00:03:21.190> I've<00:03:21.340> drawn<00:03:21.580> so<00:03:21.910> far<00:03:22.239> which<00:03:22.630> is

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
look at what I've drawn so far which is

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.170 
look at what I've drawn so far which is
just<00:03:22.989> really<00:03:23.260> the<00:03:23.380> beginning<00:03:23.910> there<00:03:24.910> are<00:03:25.030> the

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
just really the beginning there are the

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.030 
just really the beginning there are the
rest<00:03:25.390> of<00:03:25.570> the<00:03:25.690> squares<00:03:26.020> that<00:03:26.200> I<00:03:26.260> have<00:03:26.560> to<00:03:26.800> draw

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
rest of the squares that I have to draw

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.350 
rest of the squares that I have to draw
and<00:03:28.050> there<00:03:29.050> is<00:03:29.380> the<00:03:29.830> still<00:03:30.610> life<00:03:30.790> right<00:03:31.090> there

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
and there is the still life right there

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.400 
and there is the still life right there
I<00:03:32.400> can<00:03:33.400> be<00:03:33.790> pretty<00:03:34.090> sure<00:03:34.390> that<00:03:34.870> what<00:03:35.110> I<00:03:35.140> put

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
I can be pretty sure that what I put

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.160 
I can be pretty sure that what I put
down<00:03:35.560> so<00:03:35.860> far<00:03:36.100> is<00:03:36.430> pretty<00:03:37.330> accurate<00:03:37.570> and<00:03:38.080> you

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
down so far is pretty accurate and you

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:39.930 
down so far is pretty accurate and you
won't<00:03:38.380> want<00:03:38.739> to<00:03:38.830> check<00:03:39.070> yourself<00:03:39.220> with<00:03:39.730> each

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
won't want to check yourself with each

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.470 
won't want to check yourself with each
square<00:03:40.330> one<00:03:41.320> square<00:03:41.890> after<00:03:42.190> another<00:03:42.480> before

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
square one square after another before

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:49.199 
square one square after another before
you<00:03:43.930> go<00:03:44.140> on<00:03:44.290> to<00:03:44.410> the<00:03:44.500> next<00:03:44.860> square<00:03:47.820> it's<00:03:48.820> taking

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
you go on to the next square it's taking

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:54.640 
you go on to the next square it's taking
my<00:03:49.360> time

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.479 

probably<00:03:55.650> the<00:03:55.890> most<00:03:56.040> difficult<00:03:58.459> time<00:03:59.459> you

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
probably the most difficult time you

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.420 
probably the most difficult time you
will<00:03:59.970> have<00:04:00.180> with<00:04:00.420> this<00:04:00.599> exercise<00:04:00.989> is<00:04:01.620> in<00:04:02.159> the

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
will have with this exercise is in the

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.600 
will have with this exercise is in the
beginning<00:04:03.230> because<00:04:04.230> it<00:04:04.680> is<00:04:04.829> probably

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
beginning because it is probably

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.130 
beginning because it is probably
different<00:04:06.000> than<00:04:06.180> anything<00:04:06.480> else<00:04:06.720> you've<00:04:07.019> ever

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
different than anything else you've ever

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:12.589 
different than anything else you've ever
done<00:04:07.500> and<00:04:08.090> I<00:04:10.579> encourage<00:04:11.579> my<00:04:11.819> students<00:04:12.269> to<00:04:12.360> do

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:12.599 
done and I encourage my students to do

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:14.990 
done and I encourage my students to do
this<00:04:12.750> exercise<00:04:13.140> over<00:04:13.769> and<00:04:13.890> over<00:04:14.099> until<00:04:14.430> they

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
this exercise over and over until they

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.740 
this exercise over and over until they
feel<00:04:15.360> comfortable<00:04:15.659> with<00:04:16.169> it<00:04:16.350> and<00:04:17.720> after<00:04:18.720> a

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
feel comfortable with it and after a

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.370 
feel comfortable with it and after a
while<00:04:19.139> what<00:04:19.979> happens<00:04:20.519> is<00:04:20.910> do<00:04:21.180> you

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
while what happens is do you

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.439 
while what happens is do you
automatically<00:04:22.380> begin<00:04:22.740> to<00:04:22.860> see<00:04:23.130> things<00:04:23.460> on<00:04:24.419> a

00:04:24.439 --> 00:04:24.449 
automatically begin to see things on a

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:29.960 
automatically begin to see things on a
grid<00:04:24.780> really<00:04:25.289> truly<00:04:26.120> I<00:04:27.120> took<00:04:27.840> six<00:04:28.320> years<00:04:28.970> of

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
grid really truly I took six years of

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.600 
grid really truly I took six years of
drawing<00:04:30.449> in<00:04:30.810> art<00:04:31.050> school<00:04:31.380> for<00:04:31.949> my<00:04:32.100> master's

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
drawing in art school for my master's

there's<00:04:43.800> the<00:04:44.340> plexiglass<00:04:45.000> and<00:04:45.949> there's<00:04:46.949> my

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
there's the plexiglass and there's my

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.240 
there's the plexiglass and there's my
drawing<00:04:47.550> and<00:04:47.940> I'm<00:04:48.090> just<00:04:48.600> about<00:04:49.530> ready<00:04:49.860> to

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250 
drawing and I'm just about ready to

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:52.580 
drawing and I'm just about ready to
complete<00:04:50.880> the<00:04:50.910> first<00:04:51.300> phase<00:04:51.840> of<00:04:51.900> this<00:04:52.380> way

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
complete the first phase of this way

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.909 
complete the first phase of this way
through<00:04:52.919> and<00:04:53.280> check<00:04:54.470> the<00:04:55.470> rest<00:04:55.710> of<00:04:55.860> the

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:55.919 
through and check the rest of the

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:04.900 
through and check the rest of the
drawing<00:04:56.220> make<00:04:56.910> sure<00:04:57.120> that<00:04:57.300> that's<00:04:57.510> accurate

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:04.910 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:07.879 

joining<00:05:05.910> us<00:05:06.120> now<00:05:06.660> that<00:05:07.229> I've<00:05:07.470> finished<00:05:07.680> my

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:07.889 
joining us now that I've finished my

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:10.640 
joining us now that I've finished my
drawing<00:05:08.250> what<00:05:09.120> I<00:05:09.150> did<00:05:09.419> is<00:05:09.599> I<00:05:09.750> went<00:05:10.050> in<00:05:10.410> and<00:05:10.560> I

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:10.650 
drawing what I did is I went in and I

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:13.129 
drawing what I did is I went in and I
did<00:05:10.889> the<00:05:11.370> lines<00:05:11.669> a<00:05:12.060> little<00:05:12.330> bit<00:05:12.479> stronger<00:05:12.930> in

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:13.139 
did the lines a little bit stronger in

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:15.409 
did the lines a little bit stronger in
the<00:05:13.319> drawing<00:05:13.560> I<00:05:13.770> was<00:05:13.819> pretty<00:05:14.819> it's<00:05:15.090> pretty

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:15.419 
the drawing I was pretty it's pretty

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:17.990 
the drawing I was pretty it's pretty
accurate<00:05:15.690> I<00:05:16.080> was<00:05:16.259> sure<00:05:16.470> of<00:05:16.620> that<00:05:16.889> so<00:05:17.610> I<00:05:17.639> made

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
accurate I was sure of that so I made

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.260 
accurate I was sure of that so I made
the<00:05:18.210> lines<00:05:18.509> in<00:05:19.020> the<00:05:19.139> drawing<00:05:19.409> stronger<00:05:20.270> there

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270 
the lines in the drawing stronger there

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:25.100 
the lines in the drawing stronger there
you<00:05:21.479> can<00:05:21.659> see<00:05:21.930> those<00:05:22.800> still<00:05:23.159> life<00:05:23.370> and<00:05:24.110> there

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
you can see those still life and there

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.550 
you can see those still life and there
is<00:05:25.139> my<00:05:25.440> drawing<00:05:25.800> and<00:05:26.659> now<00:05:27.659> I'm<00:05:28.139> just<00:05:28.440> gonna

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 
is my drawing and now I'm just gonna

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.890 
is my drawing and now I'm just gonna
keep<00:05:28.800> the<00:05:28.979> plexiglass<00:05:29.610> up<00:05:29.879> and<00:05:30.180> I'm<00:05:30.270> going<00:05:30.840> to

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 
keep the plexiglass up and I'm going to

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.570 
keep the plexiglass up and I'm going to
go<00:05:31.050> back<00:05:31.259> into<00:05:31.530> the<00:05:31.740> drawing<00:05:32.009> and<00:05:32.190> I'm<00:05:32.340> going

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580 
go back into the drawing and I'm going

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.790 
go back into the drawing and I'm going
to<00:05:32.699> start<00:05:32.940> doing<00:05:33.150> some<00:05:33.479> basic<00:05:33.720> shading<00:05:34.440> on<00:05:34.590> it

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800 
to start doing some basic shading on it

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.950 
to start doing some basic shading on it
again<00:05:35.610> the<00:05:35.849> plexiglass<00:05:36.810> will<00:05:37.620> actually<00:05:38.250> help

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960 
again the plexiglass will actually help

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.070 
again the plexiglass will actually help
place<00:05:39.960> the<00:05:40.770> shading<00:05:41.280> because<00:05:41.639> you<00:05:42.630> can<00:05:42.810> still

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 
place the shading because you can still

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.290 
place the shading because you can still
you<00:05:43.259> can<00:05:43.409> use<00:05:43.590> the<00:05:43.770> scores<00:05:44.069> as<00:05:44.280> a<00:05:44.310> reference

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 
you can use the scores as a reference

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.170 
you can use the scores as a reference
and<00:05:45.539> the<00:05:45.630> shading<00:05:46.220> becomes<00:05:47.220> actual<00:05:47.759> shapes

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.180 
and the shading becomes actual shapes

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:52.219 
and the shading becomes actual shapes
that<00:05:48.720> you<00:05:49.530> can<00:05:49.560> compare<00:05:50.159> to<00:05:50.520> the<00:05:51.060> squares<00:05:51.419> now

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:52.229 
that you can compare to the squares now

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:54.770 
that you can compare to the squares now
I've<00:05:52.440> just<00:05:53.039> done<00:05:53.310> some<00:05:53.580> of<00:05:53.699> the<00:05:53.759> basic<00:05:54.180> shading

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:54.780 
I've just done some of the basic shading

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:57.499 
I've just done some of the basic shading
to<00:05:55.199> show<00:05:56.009> a<00:05:56.039> little<00:05:56.460> bit<00:05:56.669> of<00:05:56.729> volume<00:05:57.180> for<00:05:57.360> this

00:05:57.499 --> 00:05:57.509 
to show a little bit of volume for this

00:05:57.509 --> 00:06:01.550 
to show a little bit of volume for this
drawing<00:05:58.490> obviously<00:05:59.569> it<00:06:00.569> can<00:06:00.780> be<00:06:00.930> developed<00:06:01.409> a

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:01.560 
drawing obviously it can be developed a

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:05.270 
drawing obviously it can be developed a
lot<00:06:01.860> more<00:06:02.130> than<00:06:02.340> that<00:06:02.550> but<00:06:03.560> it<00:06:04.560> will<00:06:04.830> not<00:06:05.009> take

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:05.280 
lot more than that but it will not take

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:08.839 
lot more than that but it will not take
you<00:06:05.310> six<00:06:05.849> years<00:06:06.270> to<00:06:06.659> learn<00:06:06.870> this<00:06:07.159> it<00:06:08.159> may<00:06:08.550> take

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:08.849 
you six years to learn this it may take

00:06:08.849 --> 00:06:12.920 
you six years to learn this it may take
six<00:06:09.210> tries<00:06:09.719> but<00:06:10.169> not<00:06:10.319> six<00:06:10.680> years<00:06:11.060> and<00:06:12.060> I<00:06:12.870> think

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:12.930 
six tries but not six years and I think

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:15.709 
six tries but not six years and I think
if<00:06:13.770> you<00:06:13.949> really<00:06:14.699> want<00:06:14.880> to<00:06:15.000> learn<00:06:15.090> how<00:06:15.150> to<00:06:15.360> see

00:06:15.709 --> 00:06:15.719 
if you really want to learn how to see

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:18.320 
if you really want to learn how to see
this<00:06:15.930> is<00:06:16.110> a<00:06:16.139> really<00:06:16.830> good<00:06:17.190> method<00:06:17.909> to<00:06:17.940> begin

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:18.330 
this is a really good method to begin

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:21.979 
this is a really good method to begin
with<00:06:18.569> give<00:06:19.500> it<00:06:19.620> a<00:06:19.710> try
