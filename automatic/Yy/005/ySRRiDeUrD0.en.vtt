 thing we started 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:56.030
 in form of accounts like borges is hessens 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:03:03.780
 quality bad things is allowed is that the 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:09.380
 scenery sambeth english thing that is 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:09.380
 probably one million years recipe 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:17.580
 has worked partie for the great fan 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:24.900
 For 19 years quality has built so good quality 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:33.720
 more like that sell rating watch practice

 netherlands people's loss 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:16.549
 ok academy index language appointment okay 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.530
 that's good from helfer's hit now 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:21.440
 is your english food 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:25.960
 we watch even those chips such 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:32.770
 There is a way to see chips 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:35.780
 lidls may taste terribly sweet 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:43.520
 one of the reasons could be that out 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:54.770
 sugar is essentially what 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:56.930
 Carbohydrates are determined 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:57.460
 Krukov if you do not mind 100 percent 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:02.260
 come 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:02.260
 it tastes terribly awful 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:09.200
 she is not bad quality 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:23.330
 I mean that should be different then 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:26.229
 make comparisons here with sweets so 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.229
 worth the original 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:41.240
 you have that here 

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:44.320
 I do not know you can do it too 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:47.510
 times so you can eat 1 per day 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:49.310
 yes that is already suboptimal 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:51.550
 if you are the whole box 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:53.330
 then you probably have to end it 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:56.990
 so I will not be smarter 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:06:01.460
 exit yes let me know if 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:02.390
 you have tasted that you have to 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:06.590
 probably totally caramel 

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:09.380
 be fanatic about that so who likes to 

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:11.450
 for example or really on caramel 

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:12.229
 sweets he is supposed to do that 

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:14.810
 try out 

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:17.620
 Who let caramel not already done so 

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:21.110
 he should go around the bend 

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:23.120
 that's the really extreme caramel 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:27.370
 product what I learned to know now 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:27.370
