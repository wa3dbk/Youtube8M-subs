00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.830
 a new little video then 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.230
 today a video a bit special because 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.510
 we will test a phone us 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.730
 are there with the week oosterweel one 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.730
 two brand new kids 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.790
 the other being the dark side so the video 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.170
 will take place in two parts I will 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.719
 first introduce you the phone 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.730
 general aspe and then I will show 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.460
 a little video so you can 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:48.090
 take full advantage of the hd qualities of 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:51.780
 this screen so the phone an aspect 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:55.820
 rather attractive he looks like 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:01:00.059
 strangely one of the Korean brand 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:01.859
 the finish is in my opinion better than 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.769
 some high-end phones from the 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:07.530
 competition we have an outline that is 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:12.390
 totally aluminum and 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:14.310
 good quality plastics the phone 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.580
 technical level that is equipped with a 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:22.140
 hd corning gorilla glass screen 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:24.590
 a little bhl 2 5 inches with a 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:28.050
 resolution of 1280 by 720 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:30.030
 the processor is a quad core of 1.2 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:34.470
 the phone is equipped 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:37.290
 of android jelly bean 4.2.1 memory 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:41.090
 rom and its giga and can be increased 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:45.120
 up to 32 GB thanks to a microsd card 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:47.640
 the ram is 1 gig the phone to a 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:50.250
 double sim to be able to contacts 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:54.360
 private and pro contacts the device 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:02:01.729
 photo makes 13 megapixels and the camera 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:01.729
 frontal so the phone inside 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:08.070
 the location for the battery 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:11.760
 the location for the sim card number 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:19.170
 one for the SD card and the sim card 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:24.470
 number 2 a micro here a micro here in 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.470
 loud speakers there and the other here 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:35.880
 so now the phone itself 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:39.990
 so we're on a phone that has 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:41.820
 a price around 240 250 euros 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:45.390
 what ranks it in low phones 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:47.610
 cost for me it's not at all a 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.490
 low cost phone it can widely 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:53.510
 compete with 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:55.970
 and samsung and some company you 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.150
 will say no and will prefer to buy the 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.890
 Korean brand where the mark at the apple 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.690
 so the overlay is almost non - existent 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.420
 so this phone what is rather 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.550
 pleasant because everyone can customize 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:11.450
 the phone as they wish to 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:13.990
 his taste so I'm going to show you the 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.990
 little video 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.210
 a little problem of internet connection 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.150
 you see the high quality 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.150
 setting this screen 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.569
 the sound quality is also rather not 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:06.580
 wrong 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:10.750
 we will listen to that so the phone is 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:13.599
 equipped with an equalizer you can 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:17.169
 activate or not and then you can 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:20.799
 set the music as you want 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:23.100
 normal classic dance pop bluestor of 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:26.880
 bass or user or you will adjust 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.880
 totally your music 

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:46.990
 so that's all it will be for the test of 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:50.340
 this phone I hope this video 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.340
