00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:15.150
 years in Ukraine, both sides are fighting 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:16.949

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.590
 friendly Russian separatists 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.570
 intend to continue to arm especially 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:26.039
 difficult situation these days around town 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:28.199
 Debaltseve about 7 thousand Ukrainian 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.390
 the soldier is there in a very dangerous 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.210
 position on three sides oppresses them 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.280
 separatists 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:38.280
 if they manage to surround who can 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.950
 disaster will happen morale 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.590
 many Ukrainian soldiers at the bottom and 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:47.850
 for bad communication these days happened 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.890
 tragic misunderstanding two 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.879
 Ukrainian battalion fired on a friend 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:57.090
 friend here is damp and cold and there is war 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.160
 and again today is the day when these 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.309
 Ukrainian soldiers lost their combat 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.309
 mates 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.100
 just today we have 70 wounded 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:16.140
 entered this little hospital 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:18.290
 in about six hours 15 of their combat 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.060
 comrades did not survive the last attack 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:26.220
 this man who called himself artem 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:28.170
 supervised this battalion of soldiers 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:34.860
 sends to war without appropriate 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:36.390
 training without moral training on 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.400
 this time it was Ukrainian soldiers 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:43.170
 who shot each other 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:45.119
 terrible and deadly mistake terrible 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:49.320
 a mistake is when two battalions are sent 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:56.729
 into the battle without giving them the means of communication we 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:02:04.710

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:06.840

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.940
 that the United States wants to connect for information 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.890
