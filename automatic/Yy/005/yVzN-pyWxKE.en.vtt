30 minutes so it's kind of like drawing
the<00:00:49.890> front<00:00:50.129> but<00:00:50.280> it's<00:00:50.370> still<00:00:50.550> pretty<00:00:50.730> wet<00:00:50.969> in

the<00:00:51.210> back<00:00:51.980> anyway<00:00:52.980> so<00:00:55.190> first<00:00:56.190> I<00:00:56.579> just<00:00:57.000> braid<00:00:57.719> it

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
the back anyway so first I just braid it

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.619 
the back anyway so first I just braid it
I<00:00:58.140> split<00:00:58.620> it<00:00:58.739> into<00:00:58.920> two<00:00:59.340> I<00:00:59.760> just<00:01:00.059> do<00:01:00.270> normal

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
I split it into two I just do normal

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.870 
I split it into two I just do normal
braids<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.920> give<00:01:02.070> it<00:01:02.250> a<00:01:02.489> little<00:01:03.300> more<00:01:03.420> texture

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:04.880 
braids to give it a little more texture

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.810 
braids to give it a little more texture
in<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.600> morning<00:01:07.049> cuz<00:01:07.979> it<00:01:08.100> makes<00:01:08.130> it<00:01:08.400> easier<00:01:08.760> to

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
in the morning cuz it makes it easier to

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:15.080 
in the morning cuz it makes it easier to
UM<00:01:09.540> curl<00:01:10.460> cuz<00:01:11.460> i<00:01:11.520> use<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:11.760> curling<00:01:12.060> iron<00:01:13.880> but<00:01:14.880> yes

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
UM curl cuz i use a curling iron but yes

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.440 
UM curl cuz i use a curling iron but yes
so<00:01:16.250> this<00:01:17.250> braid<00:01:17.520> it<00:01:17.700> doesn't<00:01:18.150> have<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.420> be

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
so this braid it doesn't have to be

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.660 
so this braid it doesn't have to be
perfect<00:01:18.960> obviously<00:01:19.680> because<00:01:19.860> no<00:01:20.189> one's<00:01:20.369> good

because it's it's a little coloring so

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.240 
because it's it's a little coloring so
use<00:02:42.860> it<00:02:42.890> all<00:02:43.130> the<00:02:43.160> time<00:02:43.280> but<00:02:44.000> anyway<00:02:44.270> so<00:02:45.250> first

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
use it all the time but anyway so first

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:52.180 
use it all the time but anyway so first
just<00:02:46.700> take<00:02:47.480> like<00:02:47.810> I<00:02:49.750> like<00:02:50.750> that<00:02:50.930> much<00:02:51.170> maybe<00:02:52.040> a

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
just take like I like that much maybe a

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.790 
just take like I like that much maybe a
little<00:02:52.310> more<00:02:52.520> than<00:02:52.700> that's<00:02:52.880> not<00:02:53.390> enough<00:02:53.800> so

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
little more than that's not enough so

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.600 
little more than that's not enough so
just<00:02:54.980> like<00:02:55.130> a<00:02:55.160> link<00:02:55.520> to<00:02:55.730> the<00:02:55.940> hair<00:02:57.160> is<00:02:58.160> a<00:02:58.370> rapper

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
just like a link to the hair is a rapper

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:04.750 
just like a link to the hair is a rapper
I'll<00:02:58.910> method<00:03:02.980> and<00:03:03.980> the<00:03:04.070> check<00:03:04.280> to<00:03:04.400> make<00:03:04.490> me<00:03:04.700> is

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
I'll method and the check to make me is

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.690 
I'll method and the check to make me is
a<00:03:04.880> wave<00:03:05.090> and<00:03:05.540> not<00:03:05.720> a<00:03:05.750> curl<00:03:06.170> is<00:03:06.560> to<00:03:06.770> not<00:03:07.040> hold<00:03:07.430> it

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
a wave and not a curl is to not hold it

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:20.150 
a wave and not a curl is to not hold it
as<00:03:07.910> long

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.620 

alright<00:03:21.980> makes<00:03:22.980> like<00:03:23.280> a<00:03:23.520> wave<00:03:24.000> it's<00:03:24.330> more<00:03:24.480> what

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
alright makes like a wave it's more what

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:39.260 
alright makes like a wave it's more what
curl<00:03:24.960> up<00:03:25.110> here<00:03:25.470> but<00:03:25.740> it<00:03:25.860> falls<00:03:26.190> out<00:03:26.430> more<00:03:26.790> so

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:39.270 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:44.420 

so<00:03:39.810> this<00:03:40.800> continued<00:03:41.640> do<00:03:42.000> that<00:03:42.330> I<00:03:43.250> don't<00:03:44.250> have
