quite<00:00:59.610> long<00:00:59.940> long<00:01:00.860> hat<00:01:01.860> and<00:01:02.629> then<00:01:03.629> we<00:01:04.229> need

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:05.060 
quite long long hat and then we need

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:15.580 
quite long long hat and then we need
need<00:01:07.130> spark<00:01:08.130> book<00:01:09.470> he<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:11.930> for<00:01:12.930> that<00:01:13.200> we<00:01:14.160> need

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
need spark book he and for that we need

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:21.730 
need spark book he and for that we need
16<00:01:16.590> millimeter<00:01:18.080> socket<00:01:19.080> what<00:01:19.710> is<00:01:19.920> in<00:01:20.100> here<00:01:20.400> and

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
16 millimeter socket what is in here and

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:27.100 
16 millimeter socket what is in here and
then<00:01:22.740> when<00:01:23.580> this<00:01:24.200> spot<00:01:25.200> moves<00:01:25.650> is<00:01:26.189> so<00:01:26.430> deep

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
then when this spot moves is so deep

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.609 
then when this spot moves is so deep
sometimes<00:01:28.110> this<00:01:28.920> chocolate<00:01:30.170> chocolate<00:01:31.170> drops

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
sometimes this chocolate chocolate drops

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.660 
sometimes this chocolate chocolate drops
in<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.400> cylinder<00:01:32.880> head<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.330> now<00:01:34.260> I<00:01:34.670> think

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
in the cylinder head and now I think

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.270 
in the cylinder head and now I think
that<00:01:35.909> we<00:01:36.299> need<00:01:36.600> this<00:01:37.530> tape<00:01:38.810> and<00:01:39.810> I<00:01:40.080> I<00:01:40.500> insert

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
that we need this tape and I I insert

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.870 
that we need this tape and I I insert
here<00:01:41.580> little<00:01:42.390> bit<00:01:42.659> this<00:01:43.080> is<00:01:43.140> like<00:01:43.409> in<00:01:43.880> this

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
here little bit this is like in this

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.469 
here little bit this is like in this
date

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:53.880 

in<00:01:50.479> that<00:01:51.409> way<00:01:51.860> and<00:01:52.189> this<00:01:52.670> purpose<00:01:53.210> is<00:01:53.450> that

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
in that way and this purpose is that

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.639 
in that way and this purpose is that
attend<00:01:54.890> this<00:01:55.430> socket

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:56.649 
attend this socket

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:03.039 
attend this socket
don't<00:01:57.649> drop<00:01:58.659> to<00:01:59.659> this<00:02:00.549> spark<00:02:01.549> looks<00:02:01.909> hole<00:02:02.270> and

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:03.049 
don't drop to this spark looks hole and

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:07.199 
don't drop to this spark looks hole and
then<00:02:03.710> when<00:02:04.670> and<00:02:05.240> I<00:02:05.509> insert<00:02:06.110> this<00:02:06.350> in<00:02:06.590> here

00:02:07.199 --> 00:02:07.209 
then when and I insert this in here

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:11.160 
then when and I insert this in here
there's<00:02:08.209> the<00:02:08.420> spark<00:02:08.750> looks<00:02:09.220> we<00:02:10.220> can<00:02:10.489> usually

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
there's the spark looks we can usually

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:21.420 
there's the spark looks we can usually
take<00:02:12.170> a<00:02:12.349> look<00:02:16.840> and<00:02:17.840> when<00:02:18.709> we<00:02:19.030> look<00:02:20.030> in<00:02:20.300> there

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
take a look and when we look in there

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.089 
take a look and when we look in there
there<00:02:22.430> we<00:02:22.640> can<00:02:22.849> see<00:02:23.090> this<00:02:23.299> path<00:02:23.569> book<00:02:23.950> it<00:02:24.950> is

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 
there we can see this path book it is

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:29.910 
there we can see this path book it is
just<00:02:25.400> in<00:02:25.670> third<00:02:25.940> in<00:02:26.180> the<00:02:26.269> hole<00:02:26.450> and<00:02:28.480> and<00:02:29.480> then

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
just in third in the hole and and then

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:37.050 
just in third in the hole and and then
one<00:02:30.920> way<00:02:32.260> when<00:02:33.260> we<00:02:33.470> install<00:02:34.299> this<00:02:35.299> spark<00:02:35.840> book

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
one way when we install this spark book

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:42.130 
one way when we install this spark book
in<00:02:38.060> in<00:02:38.569> this<00:02:38.840> hole<00:02:40.090> there<00:02:41.090> is<00:02:41.209> important<00:02:41.900> that

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
in in this hole there is important that

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.250 
in in this hole there is important that
that<00:02:42.560> when<00:02:42.769> you<00:02:42.980> is<00:02:43.250> a<00:02:43.280> that<00:02:43.849> spark<00:02:44.630> plug<00:02:44.930> tool

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
that when you is a that spark plug tool

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.990 
that when you is a that spark plug tool
in<00:02:45.530> there<00:02:46.540> then<00:02:47.590> you<00:02:48.590> need<00:02:48.890> to<00:02:49.099> little<00:02:49.819> bit

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
in there then you need to little bit

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.370 
in there then you need to little bit
move<00:02:50.360> the<00:02:50.930> tool<00:02:51.260> so<00:02:52.160> that<00:02:52.190> you<00:02:52.790> you<00:02:53.359> hear<00:02:53.780> that

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
move the tool so that you you hear that

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.729 
move the tool so that you you hear that
there<00:02:54.650> are<00:02:54.680> some<00:02:55.480> Stoppers<00:02:56.480> that<00:02:56.900> this<00:02:57.470> don't

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
there are some Stoppers that this don't

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:00.370 
there are some Stoppers that this don't
move<00:02:58.150> something<00:02:59.150> like<00:02:59.359> in<00:02:59.569> in<00:02:59.840> that<00:03:00.019> when<00:03:00.230> they

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
move something like in in that when they

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.979 
move something like in in that when they
drop<00:03:00.709> carefully<00:03:01.400> and<00:03:01.609> then<00:03:02.150> when<00:03:02.359> you<00:03:02.540> rotate

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
drop carefully and then when you rotate

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:05.680 
drop carefully and then when you rotate
suddenly<00:03:03.530> do<00:03:03.650> notice<00:03:03.920> that<00:03:04.069> now<00:03:04.970> there<00:03:05.540> is

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
suddenly do notice that now there is

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.910 
suddenly do notice that now there is
contact<00:03:06.139> and<00:03:07.000> an<00:03:08.000> after<00:03:08.480> that<00:03:08.780> and<00:03:09.440> you<00:03:09.620> can

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
contact and an after that and you can

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.699 
contact and an after that and you can
start<00:03:10.670> rotate<00:03:11.319> in

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
start rotate in

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:21.360 
start rotate in
in<00:03:15.599> in<00:03:16.599> that<00:03:16.900> way<00:03:18.390> and<00:03:19.560> and<00:03:20.560> then<00:03:21.010> you<00:03:21.129> wrote

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
in in that way and and then you wrote

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.940 
in in that way and and then you wrote
that<00:03:21.549> so<00:03:21.819> long<00:03:22.120> that<00:03:22.959> when<00:03:23.140> you<00:03:23.319> take<00:03:23.680> your

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
that so long that when you take your

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.209 
that so long that when you take your
hand<00:03:24.430> in<00:03:24.730> here<00:03:25.409> actually<00:03:26.409> it<00:03:26.650> is<00:03:26.769> not<00:03:26.980> yet

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:27.219 
hand in here actually it is not yet

00:03:27.219 --> 00:03:31.979 
hand in here actually it is not yet
ready<00:03:27.719> you<00:03:28.719> can<00:03:28.930> hear<00:03:29.109> a<00:03:29.140> small<00:03:29.469> click<00:03:30.989> now

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
ready you can hear a small click now

looks<00:03:52.989> it<00:03:53.409> is<00:03:53.560> also<00:03:54.569> Japanese<00:03:56.609> spark<00:03:57.609> and<00:03:58.319> I

00:03:59.309 --> 00:03:59.319 
looks it is also Japanese spark and I

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:06.509 
looks it is also Japanese spark and I
have<00:03:59.560> here<00:03:59.859> new<00:04:00.250> spark<00:04:00.819> books<00:04:02.970> and<00:04:05.340> here<00:04:06.340> is

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:06.519 
have here new spark books and here is

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:11.610 
have here new spark books and here is
this<00:04:07.349> tensor<00:04:08.349> spark<00:04:08.739> look<00:04:09.599> what<00:04:10.599> I<00:04:10.930> what<00:04:11.409> we

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
this tensor spark look what I what we

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:21.170 
this tensor spark look what I what we
open

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:26.600 

and<00:04:22.370> then<00:04:23.370> when<00:04:23.970> we<00:04:24.150> compare<00:04:24.979> that<00:04:25.979> new<00:04:26.310> one

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
and then when we compare that new one

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.610 
and then when we compare that new one
and<00:04:26.990> old<00:04:27.990> one<00:04:28.340> we<00:04:29.340> can<00:04:29.639> notice<00:04:30.150> that<00:04:30.440> that<00:04:31.440> this

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
and old one we can notice that that this

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.400 
and old one we can notice that that this
old<00:04:31.919> one<00:04:32.190> is<00:04:32.400> not<00:04:32.639> actually<00:04:33.300> very<00:04:33.539> bad<00:04:33.840> spot

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
old one is not actually very bad spot

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.980 
old one is not actually very bad spot
look<00:04:34.860> and<00:04:35.759> there<00:04:36.030> is<00:04:36.150> hint<00:04:36.389> that<00:04:36.660> please

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
look and there is hint that please

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.719 
look and there is hint that please
compare<00:04:37.560> those<00:04:38.430> part<00:04:38.850> books<00:04:39.320> that<00:04:40.320> they<00:04:40.729> suit

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:41.729 
compare those part books that they suit

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:46.999 
compare those part books that they suit
moves<00:04:43.639> almost<00:04:44.639> similar<00:04:45.479> of<00:04:46.410> course<00:04:46.680> this<00:04:46.830> is

00:04:46.999 --> 00:04:47.009 
moves almost similar of course this is

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:53.600 
moves almost similar of course this is
more<00:04:47.220> whiter<00:04:47.520> and<00:04:48.240> then<00:04:51.350> when<00:04:52.350> you<00:04:52.830> install

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
more whiter and then when you install

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:58.270 
more whiter and then when you install
that<00:04:54.260> spark<00:04:55.260> back<00:04:56.120> in<00:04:57.120> there

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:58.280 
that spark back in there

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.629 
that spark back in there
there<00:04:59.280> is<00:04:59.400> idea<00:04:59.850> that<00:05:00.240> you<00:05:00.630> carefully<00:05:01.639> insert

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:02.639 
there is idea that you carefully insert

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:04.400 
there is idea that you carefully insert
this<00:05:02.940> look<00:05:03.539> in<00:05:03.810> theory

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.410 
this look in theory

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:07.610 
this look in theory
don't<00:05:04.800> drop<00:05:05.310> that<00:05:05.340> and<00:05:06.180> then<00:05:06.539> when<00:05:06.750> it<00:05:07.229> is<00:05:07.289> in

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 
don't drop that and then when it is in

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.810 
don't drop that and then when it is in
down<00:05:07.889> you<00:05:08.610> start<00:05:08.930> carefully<00:05:10.610> move<00:05:11.610> with<00:05:11.789> that

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:11.820 
down you start carefully move with that

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:17.900 
down you start carefully move with that
tool<00:05:12.510> and<00:05:14.270> in<00:05:15.270> this<00:05:15.449> Honda<00:05:15.750> Civic<00:05:16.440> car<00:05:16.910> this

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:17.910 
tool and in this Honda Civic car this

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:20.570 
tool and in this Honda Civic car this
part<00:05:18.270> looks<00:05:18.599> closed<00:05:18.990> very<00:05:19.320> easily<00:05:19.590> and<00:05:19.949> then

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 
part looks closed very easily and then

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:25.070 
part looks closed very easily and then
when<00:05:21.060> these<00:05:21.810> tops<00:05:23.060> then<00:05:24.060> you<00:05:24.330> need<00:05:24.750> to<00:05:24.900> take

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 
when these tops then you need to take

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.120 
when these tops then you need to take
them<00:05:25.380> normal<00:05:26.340> way<00:05:26.639> is<00:05:26.880> that<00:05:27.500> if<00:05:28.500> you<00:05:28.710> have<00:05:28.889> that

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.130 
them normal way is that if you have that

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:32.990 
them normal way is that if you have that
kind<00:05:29.430> of<00:05:29.490> tool<00:05:29.789> new<00:05:30.090> only<00:05:31.160> do<00:05:32.160> not<00:05:32.400> take<00:05:32.639> too

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 
kind of tool new only do not take too

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.860 
kind of tool new only do not take too
much<00:05:33.949> something<00:05:34.949> like<00:05:35.160> that<00:05:35.570> because<00:05:36.570> there

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:36.870 
much something like that because there

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.159 
much something like that because there
is<00:05:36.990> small<00:05:37.699> if<00:05:38.699> you<00:05:38.880> take<00:05:39.180> the<00:05:39.330> too<00:05:39.539> much<00:05:39.780> you

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:40.169 
is small if you take the too much you

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:45.070 
is small if you take the too much you
destroy<00:05:40.680> this<00:05:40.919> spark<00:05:41.909> book<00:05:42.210> threads<00:05:43.199> and<00:05:43.949> then

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.080 
destroy this spark book threads and then

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:54.070 
destroy this spark book threads and then
we<00:05:46.080> if<00:05:46.560> you<00:05:46.620> have<00:05:51.050> Taurus<00:05:52.050> this<00:05:52.260> amount<00:05:53.130> is

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.080 
we if you have Taurus this amount is

00:05:54.080 --> 00:06:02.589 
we if you have Taurus this amount is
something<00:05:55.080> like<00:05:56.840> 20<00:05:57.840> or<00:05:59.000> 25<00:06:00.139> good<00:06:01.220> there<00:06:02.220> is<00:06:02.310> a

00:06:02.589 --> 00:06:02.599 
something like 20 or 25 good there is a

00:06:02.599 --> 00:06:10.850 
something like 20 or 25 good there is a
20<00:06:04.669> 20<00:06:06.740> Newton<00:06:07.740> meters<00:06:08.159> what<00:06:08.490> means<00:06:09.530> LPF

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:10.860 
20 20 Newton meters what means LPF

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:15.439 
20 20 Newton meters what means LPF
is<00:06:11.699> something<00:06:12.210> like<00:06:12.449> a<00:06:12.690> little<00:06:13.560> bit<00:06:13.800> to<00:06:14.460> be<00:06:14.580> 10

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:15.449 
is something like a little bit to be 10

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:19.159 
is something like a little bit to be 10
or<00:06:15.479> 50<00:06:16.340> then<00:06:17.340> I<00:06:17.580> produced<00:06:18.419> this<00:06:18.630> little<00:06:18.960> bit

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:19.169 
or 50 then I produced this little bit

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:25.680 
or 50 then I produced this little bit
and<00:06:19.409> then<00:06:20.130> I<00:06:20.340> insert<00:06:20.580> that<00:06:21.060> in<00:06:21.300> here<00:06:22.520> and<00:06:23.520> when

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:25.690 
and then I insert that in here and when

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:30.999 
and then I insert that in here and when
when<00:06:26.690> we<00:06:26.900> hear<00:06:27.169> this<00:06:27.470> click<00:06:28.009> this<00:06:29.349> this<00:06:30.349> dictum

00:06:30.999 --> 00:06:31.009 
when we hear this click this this dictum

00:06:31.009 --> 00:06:35.550 
when we hear this click this this dictum
is<00:06:31.159> okay<00:06:31.490> and<00:06:32.169> suddenly<00:06:33.220> this<00:06:34.220> list<00:06:34.430> this

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:35.560 
is okay and suddenly this list this

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:41.649 
is okay and suddenly this list this
thickness<00:06:36.560> is<00:06:37.810> enough<00:06:38.810> and<00:06:39.280> okay<00:06:40.330> and<00:06:41.330> then<00:06:41.479> we

00:06:41.649 --> 00:06:41.659 
thickness is enough and okay and then we

00:06:41.659 --> 00:06:44.950 
thickness is enough and okay and then we
take<00:06:41.870> this<00:06:42.080> part<00:06:42.409> look<00:06:42.620> away<00:06:43.629> instead<00:06:44.629> back

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:44.960 
take this part look away instead back

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:47.980 
take this part look away instead back
this<00:06:45.229> spot<00:06:45.949> look<00:06:46.190> hard<00:06:46.430> and<00:06:47.150> now<00:06:47.389> we<00:06:47.750> have

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:47.990 
this spot look hard and now we have

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:51.450 
this spot look hard and now we have
changed<00:06:48.470> this<00:06:48.699> first<00:06:49.699> part<00:06:50.300> look<00:06:50.569> look<00:06:51.110> and

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:51.460 
changed this first part look look and

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:54.369 
changed this first part look look and
after<00:06:52.460> that<00:06:52.699> we<00:06:52.940> need<00:06:53.180> to<00:06:53.419> change<00:06:53.870> that<00:06:54.110> one

00:06:54.369 --> 00:06:54.379 
after that we need to change that one

00:06:54.379 --> 00:06:56.920 
after that we need to change that one
that<00:06:54.710> one<00:06:54.949> and<00:06:54.979> that<00:06:55.520> one<00:06:55.699> and<00:06:56.389> then<00:06:56.750> this

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:56.930 
that one and that one and then this

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:00.820 
that one and that one and then this
spark<00:06:57.469> groups<00:06:57.770> change<00:06:58.250> has<00:06:58.699> been<00:06:58.940> made<00:06:59.830> thank

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:00.830 
spark groups change has been made thank

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:02.979
