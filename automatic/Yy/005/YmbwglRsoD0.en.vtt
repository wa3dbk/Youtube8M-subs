00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
guy 2 times Row which is also very

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.100 
guy 2 times Row which is also very

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.110 
likely on a free fall because the spawns

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.950 
likely on a free fall because the spawns
are<00:01:01.320> set<00:01:01.500> up<00:01:01.649> so<00:01:02.059> there<00:01:03.059> are<00:01:03.180> a<00:01:03.239> lot<00:01:03.420> of<00:01:03.449> revenge

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960

kills<00:01:04.289> going<00:01:04.860> on<00:01:04.979> in<00:01:05.160> this<00:01:05.250> game<00:01:05.610> type<00:01:05.880> so<00:01:06.300> very

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
kills going on in this game type so very

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.260 
kills going on in this game type so very
likely<00:01:07.440> that<00:01:07.619> you'll<00:01:08.490> run<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.910> same<00:01:09.119> guy

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
likely that you'll run to the same guy

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.200 
likely that you'll run to the same guy
twice<00:01:09.740> but<00:01:10.740> mainly<00:01:11.310> this<00:01:11.550> challenge<00:01:11.970> is<00:01:12.149> just

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
that you're not comfortable with is like

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.690 
that you're not comfortable with is like
wearing<00:01:57.780> a<00:01:57.960> new<00:01:58.079> pair<00:01:58.350> of<00:01:58.409> underwear<00:01:58.740> it's

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
wearing a new pair of underwear it's

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.760 
wearing a new pair of underwear it's
workable<00:02:00.119> but<00:02:00.930> we<00:02:01.049> all<00:02:01.140> know<00:02:01.290> what<00:02:01.320> a<00:02:01.439> new<00:02:01.560> pair

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
workable but we all know what a new pair

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.319 
workable but we all know what a new pair
underwear<00:02:02.159> it<00:02:02.220> feels<00:02:02.430> like<00:02:02.610> right<00:02:02.850> it's<00:02:03.119> just

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
I feel very very uncomfortable when

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.219 
I feel very very uncomfortable when
they're<00:02:05.520> not<00:02:05.640> broken<00:02:05.850> in<00:02:06.119> yet<00:02:06.299> so<00:02:06.479> yeah<00:02:06.600> so<00:02:07.170> I'm

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
they're not broken in yet so yeah so I'm

comfortable but it's workable and pick

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.229 
comfortable but it's workable and pick
up<00:02:10.259> an<00:02:10.380> mp5<00:02:10.769> without<00:02:11.310> any<00:02:11.519> attachments<00:02:12.120> here

up an mp5 without any attachments here

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.670 
up an mp5 without any attachments here
because<00:02:12.570> I<00:02:12.600> think<00:02:12.930> that<00:02:13.079> guy<00:02:13.170> just<00:02:13.500> bought

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
been thinking about trying I've been

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.620 
been thinking about trying I've been
leaning<00:02:38.100> towards<00:02:38.640> showing<00:02:39.240> you<00:02:39.420> guys<00:02:39.450> how

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
leaning towards showing you guys how

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.570 
leaning towards showing you guys how
exactly<00:02:40.380> you<00:02:40.590> go<00:02:40.740> through<00:02:41.010> making<00:02:41.310> a<00:02:41.400> video

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
exactly you go through making a video

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.250 
exactly you go through making a video
because<00:02:41.820> a<00:02:42.180> lot<00:02:42.570> of<00:02:42.600> people<00:02:42.690> seem<00:02:43.050> to<00:02:43.080> be

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
because a lot of people seem to be

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.920 
because a lot of people seem to be
interested<00:02:43.410> in<00:02:43.650> that<00:02:43.800> but<00:02:44.430> if<00:02:44.790> anyone<00:02:45.180> has<00:02:45.540> any

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
interested in that but if anyone has any

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.410 
interested in that but if anyone has any
other<00:02:46.050> ideas<00:02:46.680> and<00:02:46.980> really<00:02:47.460> open<00:02:47.880> to<00:02:47.910> that<00:02:48.120> and

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
other ideas and really open to that and

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.390 
other ideas and really open to that and
I<00:02:49.350> saw<00:02:49.500> that<00:02:49.650> came<00:02:49.860> a<00:02:49.890> guy<00:02:50.040> a<00:02:50.070> little<00:02:50.190> bit

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
I saw that came a guy a little bit

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.370 
I saw that came a guy a little bit
earlier<00:02:50.460> but<00:02:50.700> I<00:02:50.970> saw<00:02:51.240> him<00:02:51.330> a<00:02:51.390> long<00:02:51.600> range<00:02:51.810> so<00:02:52.350> I

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
earlier but I saw him a long range so I

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.320 
earlier but I saw him a long range so I
didn't<00:02:52.710> shoot<00:02:52.860> him<00:02:53.010> because<00:02:53.400> I<00:02:53.670> would<00:02:54.120> have<00:02:54.240> to

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
didn't shoot him because I would have to

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.150 
didn't shoot him because I would have to
run<00:02:54.510> pretty<00:02:54.750> far<00:02:55.020> for<00:02:55.200> those<00:02:55.410> like<00:02:55.560> ambos<00:02:55.920> and

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
run pretty far for those like ambos and

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.370 
run pretty far for those like ambos and
most<00:02:56.400> likely<00:02:56.580> with<00:02:57.000> the<00:02:57.090> response<00:02:57.510> system<00:02:57.930> I'm

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
most likely with the response system I'm

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.440 
most likely with the response system I'm
at<00:02:58.560> a<00:02:58.590> remain<00:02:59.130> respawn<00:02:59.520> point<00:02:59.790> right<00:02:59.970> now<00:03:00.000> and

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
at a remain respawn point right now and

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.440 
at a remain respawn point right now and
beside<00:03:01.290> that<00:03:01.320> square<00:03:01.830> next<00:03:02.220> to<00:03:02.370> a<00:03:02.580> flag<00:03:03.240> is

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
beside that square next to a flag is

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.900 
beside that square next to a flag is
also<00:03:03.750> a<00:03:03.780> hot<00:03:03.990> spot<00:03:04.050> as<00:03:04.500> well<00:03:04.650> so<00:03:04.980> I<00:03:05.220> would<00:03:05.790> have

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
also a hot spot as well so I would have

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.220 
also a hot spot as well so I would have
ran<00:03:06.030> for<00:03:06.240> those<00:03:06.330> akimbo<00:03:06.570> then<00:03:06.870> most<00:03:07.050> likely

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
ran for those akimbo then most likely

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.300 
ran for those akimbo then most likely
some<00:03:07.710> guy<00:03:07.860> would<00:03:08.070> really<00:03:08.310> came<00:03:08.550> up<00:03:08.700> beside<00:03:08.850> me

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
some guy would really came up beside me

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.560 
some guy would really came up beside me
hit<00:03:11.310> this<00:03:11.460> guy<00:03:11.670> with<00:03:11.820> this<00:03:11.850> predator<00:03:12.270> missile

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
hit this guy with this predator missile
