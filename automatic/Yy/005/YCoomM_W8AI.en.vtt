00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
what are we have you the Caledon forest

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.429 
what are we have you the Caledon forest
so<00:01:30.329> I<00:01:30.360> figured<00:01:30.720> I'll<00:01:30.780> just<00:01:30.840> go<00:01:31.049> over<00:01:31.229> where<00:01:31.350> all

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
so I figured I'll just go over where all

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.050 
so I figured I'll just go over where all
the<00:01:31.530> tasks<00:01:31.920> are<00:01:32.100> again<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.640> tests<00:01:32.909> or<00:01:33.000> the

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
the tasks are again the tests or the

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.569 
the tasks are again the tests or the
little<00:01:33.180> hearts<00:01:33.479> here<00:01:33.860> there<00:01:34.860> are<00:01:35.009> 18<00:01:35.369> on<00:01:35.490> the

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
little hearts here there are 18 on the

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.249 
little hearts here there are 18 on the
map<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:35.909> a<00:01:36.000> lot<00:01:36.150> of<00:01:36.270> people<00:01:36.509> have<00:01:36.990> only<00:01:37.140> been

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
map and a lot of people have only been

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.950 
map and a lot of people have only been
able<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.500> find<00:01:37.710> 16<00:01:38.130> or<00:01:38.280> 17<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:39.540> biggest<00:01:39.810> thing

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
able to find 16 or 17 the biggest thing

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.800 
able to find 16 or 17 the biggest thing
to<00:01:39.990> do<00:01:40.229> is<00:01:40.470> on<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.340> map<00:01:41.579> you<00:01:42.450> won't<00:01:42.600> be<00:01:42.659> able<00:01:42.720> to

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
to do is on the map you won't be able to

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.030 
to do is on the map you won't be able to
see<00:01:42.930> it<00:01:42.990> because<00:01:43.170> I<00:01:43.229> have<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:43.380> mole<00:01:43.590> discovered

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
see it because I have a mole discovered

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.560 
see it because I have a mole discovered
but<00:01:44.369> there'll<00:01:44.520> be<00:01:44.549> little<00:01:44.729> telescopes<00:01:45.329> the

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
but there'll be little telescopes the

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.609 
but there'll be little telescopes the
best<00:01:45.750> thing<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:45.899> do<00:01:46.079> is<00:01:46.200> find<00:01:46.470> those

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
best thing to do is find those

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.499 
best thing to do is find those
telescopes<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.310> talk<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:47.700> them<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.030> they

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
telescopes and talk to them and they

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.359 
telescopes and talk to them and they
will<00:01:48.630> showcase<00:01:49.110> where<00:01:49.350> your<00:01:49.530> tasks<00:01:49.950> are<00:01:50.100> on

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
will showcase where your tasks are on

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.060 
will showcase where your tasks are on
that<00:01:50.579> map<00:01:51.049> but<00:01:52.049> a<00:01:52.229> lot<00:01:52.530> of<00:01:52.560> people<00:01:52.799> don't<00:01:52.890> know

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
that map but a lot of people don't know

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.710 
that map but a lot of people don't know
that<00:01:53.100> so<00:01:53.670> you<00:01:53.729> know<00:01:53.939> they<00:01:54.060> just<00:01:54.240> blindly<00:01:54.540> run

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
that so you know they just blindly run

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.120 
that so you know they just blindly run
around<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.079> they<00:01:55.170> discover<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.710> map<00:01:55.890> but

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
around and they discover the map but

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.039 
around and they discover the map but
whatever<00:01:57.090> so<00:01:57.240> I<00:01:57.299> figured<00:01:57.540> I'll<00:01:57.600> go<00:01:57.719> over<00:01:57.930> all

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
whatever so I figured I'll go over all

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.569 
whatever so I figured I'll go over all
18<00:01:58.619> of<00:01:58.649> them<00:01:58.860> we'll<00:01:59.070> start<00:01:59.250> in<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.340> bottom

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
18 of them we'll start in the bottom

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.959 
18 of them we'll start in the bottom
left<00:01:59.759> here<00:02:00.229> top<00:02:01.229> of<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.710> ogum<00:02:02.159> wild<00:02:02.670> this<00:02:02.909> is

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
left here top of the ogum wild this is

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.700 
left here top of the ogum wild this is
one<00:02:03.270> that<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.479> lot<00:02:03.509> of<00:02:03.659> people<00:02:03.960> actually<00:02:04.320> have

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
one that a lot of people actually have

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.880 
one that a lot of people actually have
been<00:02:04.860> missing<00:02:05.219> and<00:02:06.049> well<00:02:07.049> here<00:02:07.350> it<00:02:07.439> is<00:02:07.500> oakum

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
been missing and well here it is oakum

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.029 
been missing and well here it is oakum
wilds<00:02:08.340> then<00:02:09.000> to<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.599> north<00:02:10.530> east<00:02:10.800> of<00:02:10.979> that

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
wilds then to the north east of that

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.220 
wilds then to the north east of that

storia<00:02:13.650> are<00:02:14.340> two<00:02:14.550> saris<00:02:14.940> Toria<00:02:15.300> we<00:02:15.780> have

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
storia are two saris Toria we have

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.710 
storia are two saris Toria we have
another<00:02:16.260> one<00:02:16.409> such<00:02:16.709> two<00:02:17.010> then<00:02:17.819> in<00:02:18.209> the<00:02:18.390> verdant

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
another one such two then in the verdant

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.990 
another one such two then in the verdant
is<00:02:19.049> three<00:02:19.349> then<00:02:19.980> two<00:02:20.250> exactly<00:02:20.640> to<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:20.849> right

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
is three then two exactly to the right

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.570 
is three then two exactly to the right
of<00:02:21.120> that<00:02:21.209> is<00:02:21.720> four<00:02:22.110> then<00:02:23.010> you<00:02:23.040> go<00:02:23.220> northeast

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
of that is four then you go northeast

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.390 
of that is four then you go northeast
again<00:02:23.940> we<00:02:24.150> have<00:02:24.269> five<00:02:24.599> then<00:02:25.500> to<00:02:25.860> the<00:02:25.950> west<00:02:26.099> is

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
again we have five then to the west is

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.820 
again we have five then to the west is
six<00:02:26.670> and<00:02:26.940> to<00:02:27.269> the<00:02:27.360> west<00:02:27.540> again<00:02:27.720> is<00:02:28.049> seven<00:02:28.500> so

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
six and to the west again is seven so

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.440 
six and to the west again is seven so
the<00:02:28.980> starting<00:02:29.310> area<00:02:29.489> right<00:02:29.819> here<00:02:30.060> there<00:02:30.330> will

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
the starting area right here there will

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.050 
the starting area right here there will
be<00:02:30.480> seven<00:02:30.930> hearts<00:02:31.280> okay<00:02:32.280> and<00:02:32.640> then<00:02:32.790> we'll<00:02:32.940> move

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
be seven hearts okay and then we'll move

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.539 
be seven hearts okay and then we'll move
from<00:02:33.239> there<00:02:33.480> we<00:02:34.290> will<00:02:34.500> now<00:02:34.650> go<00:02:34.890> into<00:02:35.069> the<00:02:35.220> sandy

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549 
from there we will now go into the sandy

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:37.940 
from there we will now go into the sandy
cove<00:02:35.730> beach<00:02:35.940> that'll<00:02:36.510> be<00:02:36.599> eight<00:02:36.780> and<00:02:37.019> all<00:02:37.860> the

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
cove beach that'll be eight and all the

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.759 
cove beach that'll be eight and all the
way<00:02:38.040> to<00:02:38.099> the<00:02:38.310> right<00:02:38.489> of<00:02:38.670> that<00:02:38.870> pretty<00:02:39.870> directly

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
way to the right of that pretty directly

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:42.800 
way to the right of that pretty directly
northeast<00:02:41.519> of<00:02:41.700> the<00:02:41.730> drum<00:02:42.000> bark<00:02:42.180> and<00:02:42.360> clave<00:02:42.599> is

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
northeast of the drum bark and clave is

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.650 
northeast of the drum bark and clave is
nine<00:02:43.349> then<00:02:44.190> we'll<00:02:44.340> come<00:02:44.519> up<00:02:44.549> north<00:02:44.879> here<00:02:45.209> this

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
nine then we'll come up north here this

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.550 
nine then we'll come up north here this
will<00:02:45.810> be<00:02:45.930> ten<00:02:46.200> will<00:02:47.099> be<00:02:47.220> east<00:02:47.370> of<00:02:47.549> Ventre<00:02:47.970> beach

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
will be ten will be east of Ventre beach

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.960 
will be ten will be east of Ventre beach
all<00:02:49.560> the<00:02:49.590> way<00:02:49.920> here<00:02:50.069> west<00:02:50.340> of<00:02:50.519> entry<00:02:50.819> beach

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
all the way here west of entry beach

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.809 
all the way here west of entry beach
that's<00:02:51.299> eleven<00:02:52.160> hopefully<00:02:53.160> we<00:02:53.310> are<00:02:53.340> counting

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
that's eleven hopefully we are counting

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:57.020 
that's eleven hopefully we are counting
correctly<00:02:54.000> then<00:02:54.959> north<00:02:55.230> here<00:02:55.560> which<00:02:55.859> is<00:02:56.190> west

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
correctly then north here which is west

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:03.289 
correctly then north here which is west
of<00:02:57.239> the<00:02:57.480> route<00:02:57.690> angles<00:02:58.200> is<00:02:58.819> twelve<00:03:02.000> north<00:03:03.000> west

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
of the route angles is twelve north west

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:06.920 
of the route angles is twelve north west
of<00:03:03.450> that<00:03:03.629> is<00:03:03.900> thirteen<00:03:04.410> I<00:03:05.660> guess<00:03:06.660> we'll<00:03:06.810> go

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
of that is thirteen I guess we'll go

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.339 
of that is thirteen I guess we'll go
east<00:03:07.530> now<00:03:07.769> then<00:03:08.340> we<00:03:08.489> have<00:03:08.519> the<00:03:09.150> Dominion<00:03:09.900> of<00:03:10.079> Y

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
east now then we have the Dominion of Y

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:12.619 
east now then we have the Dominion of Y
of<00:03:10.650> winds<00:03:10.950> the<00:03:11.280> minion<00:03:11.670> of<00:03:11.849> winds<00:03:12.120> that's

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:12.629

fourteen then in Quetzal Bay is fifteen
north<00:03:17.910> of<00:03:18.209> that<00:03:18.650> pretty<00:03:19.650> much<00:03:19.799> where<00:03:19.980> this

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:20.099 
north of that pretty much where this

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:21.920 
north of that pretty much where this
goal<00:03:20.310> point<00:03:20.459> is<00:03:20.700> I<00:03:21.000> guess<00:03:21.209> you<00:03:21.389> could<00:03:21.510> say<00:03:21.660> east

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
goal point is I guess you could say east

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.099 
goal point is I guess you could say east
of<00:03:22.139> trademark<00:03:22.620> estuary<00:03:23.160> is<00:03:23.599> I<00:03:24.599> think<00:03:24.930> that's

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:25.109 
of trademark estuary is I think that's

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:27.379 
of trademark estuary is I think that's
16<00:03:25.769> or<00:03:26.010> 15<00:03:26.190> I<00:03:26.519> already<00:03:26.730> lost<00:03:26.849> count<00:03:27.180> I<00:03:27.239> believe

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:27.389 
16 or 15 I already lost count I believe

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:29.089 
16 or 15 I already lost count I believe
that's<00:03:27.510> 16

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:29.099 
that's 16

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:31.640 
that's 16
yep<00:03:29.549> that's<00:03:29.760> sixteen<00:03:30.090> and<00:03:30.239> then<00:03:30.810> in<00:03:31.139> the

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.460 
here so north of the lion guard way
station<00:03:40.919> is<00:03:41.069> number<00:03:41.700> 18<00:03:42.169> so<00:03:43.169> hopefully

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
station is number 18 so hopefully

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:44.509

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
hundred percent completion on the map as

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.099 
hundred percent completion on the map as
you<00:03:51.120> can<00:03:51.239> see<00:03:51.329> I<00:03:51.389> do<00:03:51.450> have<00:03:51.540> one<00:03:51.750> hundred<00:03:51.840> and

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.109 
you can see I do have one hundred and

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:53.690 
you can see I do have one hundred and
there's<00:03:52.319> eighteen<00:03:52.680> waypoints<00:03:53.310> there's

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
there's eighteen waypoints there's

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.490 
there's eighteen waypoints there's
twenty<00:03:54.030> points<00:03:54.299> of<00:03:54.389> interest<00:03:54.780> seven<00:03:55.260> skill

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
twenty points of interest seven skill

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.640 
twenty points of interest seven skill
challenges<00:03:56.099> and<00:03:56.250> eight<00:03:56.609> vistas<00:03:57.540> if<00:03:58.470> you'd

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
challenges and eight vistas if you'd

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.110 
challenges and eight vistas if you'd
like<00:03:58.799> I<00:03:58.950> can<00:03:59.099> do<00:03:59.220> a<00:03:59.250> video<00:03:59.459> on<00:03:59.669> where<00:03:59.849> they<00:03:59.970> all

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
like I can do a video on where they all

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.729 
like I can do a video on where they all
are<00:04:00.329> but<00:04:00.540> hopefully<00:04:00.989> you<00:04:01.290> know<00:04:01.379> I'll<00:04:01.470> just<00:04:01.650> do

are but hopefully you know I'll just do

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:02.930 
are but hopefully you know I'll just do
a<00:04:01.769> quick<00:04:01.980> little<00:04:02.010> scan<00:04:02.370> of<00:04:02.489> the<00:04:02.549> map<00:04:02.730> and<00:04:02.910> I

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
a quick little scan of the map and I

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.979 
a quick little scan of the map and I
guess<00:04:03.090> from<00:04:03.419> here<00:04:03.510> you<00:04:03.810> can<00:04:03.959> see<00:04:05.870> zoom<00:04:06.870> in

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
guess from here you can see zoom in

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:07.940 
guess from here you can see zoom in
right<00:04:07.139> here<00:04:07.319> you<00:04:07.379> should<00:04:07.530> be<00:04:07.590> able<00:04:07.680> to<00:04:07.799> see

right here you should be able to see
them<00:04:08.099> all<00:04:08.220> just<00:04:08.459> on<00:04:08.609> the<00:04:08.760> map<00:04:08.940> we'll<00:04:09.150> just<00:04:09.299> do<00:04:09.389> a

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:09.419 
them all just on the map we'll just do a

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:12.289 
them all just on the map we'll just do a
slow<00:04:09.750> little<00:04:10.109> pan<00:04:10.379> up<00:04:10.560> here<00:04:10.799> and<00:04:11.669> hopefully

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:12.299 
slow little pan up here and hopefully

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:13.640 
slow little pan up here and hopefully
this<00:04:12.510> will<00:04:12.629> help<00:04:12.690> you<00:04:12.870> guys<00:04:13.019> you<00:04:13.230> know<00:04:13.319> get<00:04:13.530> all

your uh you know get a hundred percent
completion<00:04:15.629> on<00:04:15.810> the<00:04:15.900> map<00:04:16.079> I<00:04:16.229> do<00:04:16.320> recommend

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
completion on the map I do recommend

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:18.409 
completion on the map I do recommend
doing<00:04:17.039> it<00:04:17.250> on<00:04:17.340> every<00:04:17.549> math<00:04:17.699> you<00:04:17.849> go<00:04:18.000> into<00:04:18.269> you

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
doing it on every math you go into you

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:20.539 
doing it on every math you go into you
get<00:04:18.539> a<00:04:18.599> lot<00:04:18.870> of<00:04:19.079> xp<00:04:19.440> for<00:04:19.470> it<00:04:19.889> and<00:04:20.070> you<00:04:20.400> actually
