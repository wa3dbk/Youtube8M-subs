this<00:00:08.800> is<00:00:08.890> going<00:00:09.010> to<00:00:09.130> create<00:00:09.370> a<00:00:09.580> fringe<00:00:10.030> which

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:10.450 
this is going to create a fringe which

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:13.589 
this is going to create a fringe which
is<00:00:10.599> a<00:00:10.630> bit<00:00:10.809> longer<00:00:11.080> at<00:00:11.290> the<00:00:11.410> size<00:00:12.480> what<00:00:13.480> you

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:13.599 
is a bit longer at the size what you

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:15.089 
is a bit longer at the size what you
need<00:00:13.750> to<00:00:13.780> do<00:00:14.050> if<00:00:14.230> you<00:00:14.320> don't<00:00:14.500> have<00:00:14.740> a<00:00:14.769> fringe

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:15.099 
need to do if you don't have a fringe

00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:19.710 
already you figure out which part of
your<00:00:18.519> hair<00:00:18.699> to<00:00:18.789> use<00:00:18.970> of<00:00:19.119> a<00:00:19.210> friend<00:00:19.509> now<00:00:19.689> I

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:25.060 
always take basically where you know in

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.269 
always take basically where you know in
the<00:00:25.359> corner<00:00:25.630> where<00:00:26.199> you<00:00:26.529> know<00:00:26.649> this<00:00:26.859> the

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:27.279 
the corner where you know this the

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:29.700 
the corner where you know this the
straight<00:00:27.550> bit<00:00:27.789> and<00:00:27.999> this<00:00:28.599> bit<00:00:28.899> there's<00:00:29.619> a

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:29.710 
straight bit and this bit there's a

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.679 
straight bit and this bit there's a
corner<00:00:30.099> and<00:00:30.279> that's<00:00:30.489> that's<00:00:30.909> here<00:00:31.210> I<00:00:31.390> start

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:31.689 
corner and that's that's here I start

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:35.190 
corner and that's that's here I start
over<00:00:32.020> there<00:00:33.090> it's<00:00:34.090> been<00:00:34.270> both<00:00:34.450> sides<00:00:34.780> i<00:00:34.960> just

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:35.200 
over there it's been both sides i just

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.890 
over there it's been both sides i just
take<00:00:35.380> the<00:00:35.530> hair<00:00:35.710> from<00:00:36.000> inside<00:00:37.000> that<00:00:37.360> corner

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:37.900 
take the hair from inside that corner

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.370 
take the hair from inside that corner
and<00:00:38.640> then<00:00:39.640> it<00:00:39.790> sort<00:00:40.030> of<00:00:40.150> depends<00:00:40.540> on<00:00:40.930> whether

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:41.380 
and then it sort of depends on whether

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.430 
and then it sort of depends on whether
you<00:00:41.530> want<00:00:42.130> it<00:00:42.490> very<00:00:42.550> full<00:00:43.120> fringe<00:00:43.420> or<00:00:43.630> or<00:00:44.170> not

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
you want it very full fringe or or not

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.600 
you want it very full fringe or or not
how<00:00:45.160> much<00:00:45.580> and<00:00:46.030> far<00:00:46.330> back<00:00:46.630> you<00:00:46.990> go<00:00:47.020> now<00:00:47.830> it<00:00:48.010> will

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:48.610 
how much and far back you go now it will

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.050 
how much and far back you go now it will
take<00:00:48.760> back<00:00:49.240> this<00:00:49.600> much<00:00:50.220> if<00:00:51.220> you<00:00:51.370> already<00:00:51.520> have

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:52.060 
take back this much if you already have

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.200 
take back this much if you already have
a<00:00:52.090> fringe<00:00:52.920> then<00:00:53.920> just<00:00:54.520> take<00:00:54.850> the<00:00:55.000> hair<00:00:55.180> that's

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210 
a fringe then just take the hair that's

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:00.090 
a fringe then just take the hair that's
in<00:00:55.630> your<00:00:55.840> fringe<00:00:56.050> now<00:00:57.989> so<00:00:58.989> we<00:00:59.140> have<00:00:59.350> have<00:00:59.920> this

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
in your fringe now so we have have this

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.380 
in your fringe now so we have have this
bit<00:01:00.310> of<00:01:00.460> hair<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:02.020> we're<00:01:02.170> going<00:01:02.320> to<00:01:02.380> cut<00:01:02.650> that

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
bit of hair and we're going to cut that

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.969 
bit of hair and we're going to cut that
my<00:01:04.390> advice<00:01:04.689> is<00:01:04.719> if<00:01:05.019> you<00:01:05.140> don't<00:01:05.409> have<00:01:05.590> a<00:01:05.619> fringe

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:05.979 
my advice is if you don't have a fringe

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:10.289 
my advice is if you don't have a fringe
already<00:01:07.200> don't<00:01:08.200> try<00:01:08.530> to<00:01:08.590> cut<00:01:09.280> it<00:01:09.429> too<00:01:10.270> short
