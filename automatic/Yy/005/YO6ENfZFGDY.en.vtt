the<00:01:40.290> butt<00:01:40.439> ends<00:01:40.740> up<00:01:41.000> you're<00:01:42.049> kind<00:01:43.049> of<00:01:43.110> ensuring

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
the butt ends up you're kind of ensuring

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.380 
the butt ends up you're kind of ensuring
that<00:01:43.710> that<00:01:43.979> hair<00:01:44.280> is<00:01:44.430> going<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.729> stay<00:01:45.000> on<00:01:45.149> top

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
that that hair is going to stay on top

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.819 
that that hair is going to stay on top
of<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.600> hook<00:01:45.810> which<00:01:46.049> is<00:01:46.200> where<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:46.500> want<00:01:46.649> it

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
of the hook which is where you want it

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.429 
of the hook which is where you want it
so<00:01:47.729> let's<00:01:48.090> make<00:01:48.299> one<00:01:48.540> or<00:01:48.659> two<00:01:48.810> more<00:01:48.960> securing

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
so let's make one or two more securing

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.010 
so let's make one or two more securing
wraps<00:01:49.649> and<00:01:50.009> then<00:01:50.939> move<00:01:51.180> my<00:01:51.210> hands<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:51.750> you<00:01:51.810> see

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
wraps and then move my hands and you see

let's take a few more securing wraps

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.880 
let's take a few more securing wraps
over<00:02:05.850> top<00:02:06.149> of<00:02:06.329> this<00:02:06.420> red<00:02:06.689> bunch<00:02:06.930> make<00:02:07.710> sure

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
over top of this red bunch make sure

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.249 
over top of this red bunch make sure
it's<00:02:08.039> really<00:02:08.190> nailed<00:02:08.489> into<00:02:08.729> place<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:09.450> then

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
it's really nailed into place and then

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.020 
it's really nailed into place and then
come<00:02:10.560> in<00:02:10.679> here<00:02:10.709> cut<00:02:11.099> these<00:02:11.250> fibers<00:02:11.670> off<00:02:11.819> at<00:02:11.970> a

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
come in here cut these fibers off at a

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.300 
come in here cut these fibers off at a
bit<00:02:12.150> of<00:02:12.239> an<00:02:12.330> angle

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
bit of an angle

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.619 
bit of an angle
and<00:02:14.310> we're<00:02:14.549> going<00:02:14.670> to<00:02:14.700> lock<00:02:14.879> that<00:02:14.939> bunch<00:02:15.360> down

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
and we're going to lock that bunch down

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:17.750 
and we're going to lock that bunch down
by<00:02:15.840> wrapping<00:02:16.319> toward<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.370> eye<00:02:17.430> of<00:02:17.579> the<00:02:17.670> hook

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
by wrapping toward the eye of the hook

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.170 
by wrapping toward the eye of the hook
getting<00:02:18.090> all<00:02:18.209> those<00:02:18.360> fibers<00:02:18.540> secured<00:02:19.079> down

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
getting all those fibers secured down

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.670 
getting all those fibers secured down
okay<00:02:23.480> now<00:02:24.480> we'll<00:02:24.720> take<00:02:24.870> our<00:02:25.019> next<00:02:25.200> bunch<00:02:25.470> our

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
there and if we rotate that around we

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.550 
there and if we rotate that around we
did<00:03:15.239> pretty<00:03:15.420> good<00:03:15.540> on<00:03:15.720> this<00:03:15.870> side<00:03:16.109> -<00:03:16.319> it's<00:03:16.500> a

little hard to tell by the angle of the

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:20.000 
little hard to tell by the angle of the
video<00:03:18.180> so<00:03:18.449> take<00:03:19.049> that<00:03:19.169> it<00:03:19.319> yeah<00:03:19.620> there<00:03:19.769> you<00:03:19.859> can

another good point to mention here is
that<00:03:50.430> no<00:03:50.670> matter<00:03:50.820> how<00:03:51.060> careful<00:03:51.330> you<00:03:51.570> are<00:03:51.660> with

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
that no matter how careful you are with

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.110 
that no matter how careful you are with
your<00:03:52.050> placement<00:03:52.560> if<00:03:52.680> you<00:03:52.920> do<00:03:53.130> use<00:03:53.370> too<00:03:53.670> big<00:03:53.970> of

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
your placement if you do use too big of

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.780 
your placement if you do use too big of
a<00:03:54.180> bundle<00:03:54.540> of<00:03:54.690> hair<00:03:54.930> fibers<00:03:55.380> again<00:03:56.370> no<00:03:56.640> matter

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
a bundle of hair fibers again no matter

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.240 
a bundle of hair fibers again no matter
how<00:03:57.120> careful<00:03:57.630> you<00:03:57.660> are<00:03:58.040> you're<00:03:59.040> inevitably

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
how careful you are you're inevitably

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:00.920 
how careful you are you're inevitably
going<00:03:59.670> to<00:03:59.730> have<00:03:59.850> some<00:04:00.060> of<00:04:00.180> that<00:04:00.210> material<00:04:00.540> roll

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
going to have some of that material roll

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.810 
going to have some of that material roll
around<00:04:01.050> and<00:04:01.380> your<00:04:01.500> stripe<00:04:01.740> is<00:04:01.890> going<00:04:02.160> to<00:04:02.310> blur

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
around and your stripe is going to blur

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.900 
around and your stripe is going to blur
a<00:04:03.060> bit<00:04:03.560> so<00:04:04.560> you<00:04:04.620> do<00:04:04.830> want<00:04:05.010> to<00:04:05.040> be<00:04:05.160> sparse<00:04:05.580> I

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
a bit so you do want to be sparse I

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.580 
a bit so you do want to be sparse I
could<00:04:06.090> have<00:04:06.180> even<00:04:06.420> gone<00:04:06.510> sparser<00:04:07.110> on<00:04:07.320> this

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
could have even gone sparser on this

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.010 
could have even gone sparser on this
Mickey<00:04:07.800> Finn<00:04:08.420> but<00:04:09.420> you<00:04:09.570> know<00:04:09.660> we<00:04:09.780> want<00:04:09.930> up

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:10.020 
Mickey Finn but you know we want up

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.040 
Mickey Finn but you know we want up
doing<00:04:10.260> okay<00:04:10.500> anyway<00:04:11.690> but<00:04:12.690> definitely<00:04:13.020> keep

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.050 
doing okay anyway but definitely keep

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:15.860 
doing okay anyway but definitely keep
your<00:04:13.290> bundles<00:04:13.620> sparse<00:04:14.660> otherwise<00:04:15.660> you're

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
your bundles sparse otherwise you're

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.890 
your bundles sparse otherwise you're
really<00:04:16.140> fighting<00:04:16.530> a<00:04:16.650> losing<00:04:17.220> battle

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
really fighting a losing battle

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.490 
really fighting a losing battle
so<00:04:18.900> we'll<00:04:19.080> Lance<00:04:19.230> our<00:04:19.440> thread<00:04:19.680> off<00:04:19.860> here<00:04:20.299> and

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
so we'll Lance our thread off here and

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.910 
so we'll Lance our thread off here and
our<00:04:22.760> take<00:04:23.760> that<00:04:23.940> out<00:04:24.060> and<00:04:24.210> inspect<00:04:24.540> it<00:04:24.770> we<00:04:25.770> did

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:25.920 
our take that out and inspect it we did

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.830 
our take that out and inspect it we did
pretty<00:04:26.100> good<00:04:26.190> on<00:04:26.400> that<00:04:26.430> side<00:04:26.640> and<00:04:27.330> if<00:04:27.480> we<00:04:27.660> flip

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
pretty good on that side and if we flip

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.510 
pretty good on that side and if we flip
it<00:04:28.050> around<00:04:28.140> and<00:04:28.530> check<00:04:28.770> the<00:04:28.890> other<00:04:28.920> side<00:04:29.100> out

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
it around and check the other side out

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.490 
it around and check the other side out
there<00:04:30.240> pretty<00:04:30.420> good<00:04:30.600> on<00:04:30.690> that<00:04:30.750> side<00:04:30.870> too<00:04:31.260> so

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
there pretty good on that side too so

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.150 
there pretty good on that side too so
there<00:04:31.680> you<00:04:31.800> go<00:04:31.920> a<00:04:31.950> perfect<00:04:32.600> crisp<00:04:33.600> stripe<00:04:34.160> for

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
there you go a perfect crisp stripe for

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.940 
there you go a perfect crisp stripe for
a<00:04:35.220> hair<00:04:35.430> wing<00:04:35.610> streamer
