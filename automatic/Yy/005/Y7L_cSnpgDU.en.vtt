00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.719
 hello friends are you on the channel how to become 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.059
 hunter I am leading oleynik today flour 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.349
 I came here such curiosity is 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:18.060
 predecessor 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.960
 18 responses Yeshka I lead which was 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.080
 produced 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:25.220
 the fifty second year and my friend with him 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:28.109
 them is still by the way in the trunk 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:31.259
 very good condition only she is good 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:34.860
 preserved as if shooting from it 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:38.640
 super than it is cool in the first place she 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:41.610
 easy very easy because not here 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.360
 metal is generally a bit of weight in general 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.239
 tagieva 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.460
 even see we have a back plate beats 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.769
 iron tyn they thought they are not yet 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.320
 free clinics this is my one of the first 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:54.479
 guns Zhukovsky plant and 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.989
 times as far as i know these souls even 

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:59.850
 sold without registration then 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.920
 whether they really sold there with 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.110
 trapped and cover them with one dinner and 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.369
 shot rats could come 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.649
 ointments buy weapons calmly se 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:14.359
 shoot the rat is not inherently 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:17.549
 as if somehow driving there anymore 

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:19.950
 what's cool here is a long barrel with 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.740
 12 700 80 millimeters 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.740
 presents both to and driving well as if 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.479
 what a long barrel of course not all 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.789
 found only in the sixteenth 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.920
 Hummingbird other calibers for some reason I do not 

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:35.899
 saw 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:38.759
 perhaps it was at the time, and normal 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:43.950
 let's say 12 gauge and don't make a weapon 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:46.999
 only 16 18 below have already passed 12 some 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:50.789
 12 gauge and but in this while I do not see 

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:51.820
 she understands the standard as a break 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:55.060
 separated 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:57.990
 separate themselves like a barrel I disassemble 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.670
 I will not because there is so uncomfortable 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.600
 tsigal lever and she sits 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.380
 very tours 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:07.060
 Well, they are removed very badly because 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.030
 that it is circular with us 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:13.959
 made shooting we call the barrel 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:16.180
 insert cartridge closed toponym blood 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:20.310
 we have a cool one 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:22.600
 rezik with which you need to reduce the fly and 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:26.020
 accordingly when the trigger we reduced 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:29.140
 see this strait and cocked my husband I tell you 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:34.030
 I will say very nicely falls from the first 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:37.360
 of course the bar is resting on when we 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:40.060
 today class all happened in if to us 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.850
 you need to remove from combat platoon you just 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.459
 finger hold the trigger and press 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.700
 trigger and gently release here 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:50.080
 so it is made as if just there 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.360
 descent from combat platoon 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.390
 but there is a drawback if you are for 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.739
 me go to some gloves and 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.810
 try to hold yours 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:01.840
 that is, this trigger is likely 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:04.090
 Of course, what will be the goal ? 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.510
 so everywhere with these people need to be 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:10.450
 over by maybe stick 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.430
 security rules platoon clear 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.310
 Now this is done as a lever 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:18.280
 eighteenth lie but 18 when on 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:21.100
 platoon we platoon and trigger we erect 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.739
 and the new ones break the barrel right here 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.170
 we just have this break function 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:28.600
 the trunk 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:31.000
 trigger we like here separately for both 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.730
 such a wonder which way out well which 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.340
 I wanted to share with you a video on these 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.470
 guns beginner hunters and not in 1 and 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:42.730
 i saw i will tell you this is a great option 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:44.980
 learn to shoot because if you 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.120
 understand that you have one cartridge and you for 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.510
 one cartridge is needed 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:51.640
 boogie what will you bring it that is 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.370
 look take care to eat accordingly 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.620
 will learn to shoot and every 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:04:00.489
 at once you will drive to the target and then 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:02.730
 of course when you spend on weapons on 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:04.810
 cartridges on by automatically 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.909
 accordingly in those guns you already 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.280
 will be well how would you be 

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:11.950
 prepared and you will be well 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:14.379
 shoot then novice hunter sous 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:17.560
 demanded that most likely such already 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:20.350
 generally cost a penny is an inexpensive brook 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.510
 and his budding background which is strong 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:24.760
 wants to hunt for a day and can't afford 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:28.030
 allow therefore here such here 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:30.610
 interesting thing you want looking for 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:34.240
 novice hunters try i think 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:35.260
 you will be satisfied on this until all 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.330
 see you soon
