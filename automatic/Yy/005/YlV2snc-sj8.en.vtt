00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870 
came in the last one important was good

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:01.690 
came in the last one important was good
to<00:04:59.870> the<00:04:59.990> series<00:05:00.320> it<00:05:00.440> was<00:05:00.610> unbelievable<00:05:01.610> the

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:01.700 
to the series it was unbelievable the

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.590

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210 
that they might start using visuals of

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:13.540 
that they might start using visuals of
your<00:05:08.360> celebrations<00:05:08.990> in<00:05:09.170> Twilight<00:05:09.590> movies<00:05:12.550> why
