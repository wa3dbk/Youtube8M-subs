00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:07.970
 about 15 meters above the river 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:11.750
 clyde west of scotland 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:15.530
 be it the best known victory bridge 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:18.920
 like the overtown bridge 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:21.830
 since 1950 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:26.060
 it is said that more than 500 dogs have been 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:29.689
 killed in the jumping always in 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:32.540
 full earth and in view of all 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:36.410
 curiously from the same point of 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:38.680
 right side of the bridge even if there is not 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:42.469
 an official figure of dead dogs 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:46.460
 due to the lack of records just 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:50.040
 in 2005 five dogs died in a 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:54.060
 space of six months 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:57.150
 that with their strange situation moves them to 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:59.910
 committing said acts 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:04.589
 perhaps there are spirits lurking around the 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:08.100
 place extract the magnetic fields or 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:11.300
 energies of the beyond that induce them the 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.300
 sadness and despair 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:17.860
 it is at liberty a place where 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:20.440
 makes the line more vulnerable 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.190
 divide the real world set 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:27.320
 unknown 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:30.580
 today we want to talk about the bridge of 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.580
 the suicide dogs 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:43.290
 the bridge was built in 1895 by 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:48.940
 Order of the Calvinist Lord Robert 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:52.030
 although it was not until 1950 that the 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:54.900
 dog suicides did not start 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.900
 to know 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:02.009
 curiously next to said bridge it 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.619
 find the door to the house that had 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:09.229
 served as a rest home for 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:12.450
 soldiers injured but only until 1947 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:15.569
 since in that year it became 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:20.340
 maternity hospital being destroyed 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:23.580
 partially by a fire in 1948 in 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:26.370
 which there were no deaths and after 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:30.030
 that the place continued to function 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:35.220
 as occipital maternity until 1 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:38.010
 September 1970 maybe the energies 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.440
 of the wounded soldiers and what happened 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.780
 during the fire they stayed 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:46.680
 impregnated in the place 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:50.180
 and probably many of those soldiers 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.180
 they did not want to live 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:56.610
 investigations have shown that 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:03:00.830
 war veterans are more likely to 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.830
 suicide that other people 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:09.310
 it will be that dogs can see things that 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:12.940
 most people can not see 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:17.819
 will be that they can serve things that the 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.819
 most people can not feel 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:24.580
 will be this place where they become 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:28.120
 much thinner the lines of the 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.800
 border between the afterlife and the world in 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:34.150
 that we live 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:37.540
 Many people have testified 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:40.110
 the things that happen in that famous place 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:43.480
 one of the most testimonies 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:46.930
 impressive was the testimony of his 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:49.080
 son jon from glasgow who told what 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.080
 following 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:55.080
 feel like a lot of children 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:58.590
 They grabbed their legs while walking 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:00.850
 across the bridge and I was attracted 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:03.910
 to the right side 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:06.130
 I felt very uncomfortable in certain 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:08.590
 parts and sometimes it was like that if 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.840
 I was walking and sinking myself to 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:14.480
 across the bridge 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:18.280
 the worst stories about this place 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:22.900
 they do not have paths as protagonists 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.900
 but human beings 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:32.930
 in 1994 the soldier I live 32 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:36.689
 years out the bridge with her little baby 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:39.719
 it is known that kevin always insisted on 

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:43.069
 that the bridge is haunted whether or not 

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:45.990
 true that he told me to be the antichrist 

00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:50.069
 I thought that her little baby of two weeks 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:53.120
 of born was satan and that he and his son 

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:57.180
 they were guilty of the gulf war 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:59.440
 so I had to put an end to the evil of 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:03.310
 both of them 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:06.340
 kevin threw her baby on the bridge and 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:08.940
 he tried after committing suicide by surviving 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:11.830
 and being hospitalized in a hospital 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:16.800
 psychiatric 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:20.110
 dona cooper account who in 1995 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:24.130
 She is walking on the bridge with her husband 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:26.970
 his son and his dog but not missing 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:30.820
 a lot to get to the end of the bridge 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:33.550
 ben got put I think he ran frantic 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:36.910
 to the exact point where always the 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:41.010
 dogs are thrown and jumped as if a 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:44.260
 mysterious force will call him to death 

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:47.490
 he survived the fall but his wounds 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:51.280
 they were so serious that because of their agony 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:55.630
 they had to sacrifice it as well as 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:58.180
 previous there are many stories but 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:06:01.840
 The most surprising thing is that in many 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:05.680
 cases the dogs survived and despite 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:08.680
 that they jumped again at the same point 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:12.080
 when their masters brought them 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:17.040
 to the damn bridge 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:20.310
 whether it is a reality or a fantasy 

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:23.340
 The truth is that hundreds of dogs 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:28.820
 have committed suicide in that place and maybe 

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:28.820
 we will never know the real reason
