00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
running we find that it is stretching so

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:11.670 
running we find that it is stretching so
in<00:03:09.730> order<00:03:09.909> to<00:03:10.060> shorten<00:03:10.359> that<00:03:10.659> we<00:03:11.170> stop<00:03:11.469> the

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
in order to shorten that we stop the

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.929 
in order to shorten that we stop the
wheel<00:03:11.859> and<00:03:12.400> secure<00:03:12.819> the<00:03:13.239> belt<00:03:13.450> with<00:03:13.689> clamps

wheel and secure the belt with clamps

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:23.610 
wheel and secure the belt with clamps
and<00:03:15.939> cut<00:03:16.209> away<00:03:16.480> a<00:03:16.810> piece<00:03:17.290> of<00:03:17.319> the<00:03:17.620> belt

then it's time to start up the wheel to

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.600 
then it's time to start up the wheel to
