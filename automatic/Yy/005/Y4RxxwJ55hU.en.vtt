00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 
course hopefully it'll be at least three

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:06.509 
course hopefully it'll be at least three
characters<00:04:04.720> in<00:04:04.870> that<00:04:04.900> Oh<00:04:05.200> fifty<00:04:05.980> dollars<00:04:06.010> you

that's<00:04:13.540> probably<00:04:13.930> about<00:04:14.080> right<00:04:14.260> now<00:04:15.220> for<00:04:15.760> that

00:04:15.899 --> 00:04:15.909 
that's probably about right now for that

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:16.759 
that's probably about right now for that
you'd<00:04:16.090> expect<00:04:16.479> about

you'd expect about

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:18.229 
you'd expect about
three<00:04:16.889> characters<00:04:17.340> I<00:04:17.430> think<00:04:17.729> because<00:04:18.030> these

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
three characters I think because these

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.569 
three characters I think because these
are<00:04:18.389> pretty<00:04:18.599> small<00:04:18.930> well<00:04:19.709> let's<00:04:19.889> hope<00:04:20.099> but

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 
are pretty small well let's hope but

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:21.949 
are pretty small well let's hope but

that's going to be a bit of a winner Joe
yes<00:04:42.659> I<00:04:42.930> think<00:04:43.580> if<00:04:44.580> you<00:04:45.120> are<00:04:45.150> saying<00:04:45.830> its<00:04:46.830> core

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
yes I think if you are saying its core

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:52.070 
yes I think if you are saying its core
it<00:04:47.819> it<00:04:48.330> would<00:04:48.509> be<00:04:48.659> the<00:04:48.810> vowel<00:04:49.110> a<00:04:49.380> score<00:04:49.830> or<00:04:51.080> i

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
it it would be the vowel a score or i

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.029 
it it would be the vowel a score or i
would<00:04:52.830> say<00:04:53.130> a<00:04:53.490> hundred<00:04:53.729> and<00:04:54.650> twenty-five<00:04:55.650> and

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:56.039 
would say a hundred and twenty-five and

00:04:56.039 --> 00:04:58.909 
would say a hundred and twenty-five and
i<00:04:56.310> would<00:04:56.639> say<00:04:56.880> that's<00:04:57.180> about<00:04:57.449> some<00:04:57.990> Skylanders

00:04:58.909 --> 00:04:58.919 
i would say that's about some Skylanders

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:01.550 
i would say that's about some Skylanders
okay<00:04:59.669> so<00:04:59.970> I<00:05:00.000> think<00:05:00.330> considering<00:05:01.199> how<00:05:01.380> well

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
okay so I think considering how well
