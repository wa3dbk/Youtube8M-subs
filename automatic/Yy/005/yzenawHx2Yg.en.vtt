 his thoughts have young on 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.309
 In any case, I was just on youtube 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.059
 on the way and have a comment 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.489

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.649
 hey said how much finally said 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.649
 larger commentators being tested 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.660
 but thought materia t wants that 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:07.200
 right in front of me until I found out 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.180
 have that dear donkey wiser or from 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.240
 somehow made me video and has 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:15.630
 he mentioned eleven as a commentator 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:17.700
 with a weapon in the name of money pays 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.020
 other cultures so he pushes for it 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.400
 and then we have like 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.720
 strangely many thought it would be 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.250
 real travel &amp; ba that yes cherilyn is yes 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:29.759
 yes you can say it is a weapon or 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.140
 so much an anti dingsbums part where 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.460
 Somehow somehow here today things 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.700
 rum probably repeat 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.920
 good thing more in any case how long 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.810
 meant kevin rogers still has some and 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.430
 the video was written and I had too 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.259
 get some ps and also in the post 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.450
 posted on facebook that i have now on 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:50.549
 In any case, I am not 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.890
 definitely definitely yes it is about the 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.170
 story that somehow a commentator 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:57.630
 Paying money to other larger comments 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.689
 so that he is pushed there and I can 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.100
 you to a hundred thousand percent 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:04.110
 assure that this is not the case 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.950
 I pay no money any one 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.479
 commentator nix nada 0 because that's me 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.270
 but not worth it because youtube is one 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.460
 hobby and 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:15.120
 I already have enough money invested 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:18.580
 and moisten money invested for subscriptions 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:22.450
 I prefer to invest that for the notes 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:25.630
 the puff yes I have to earn more 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.460
 More fun in any case I want 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.990
 again clarify though I pay here 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.120
 no money to commentators 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.920
 I say so pushes one another 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.530
 sure again and again one of them 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.760
 others and money if I'm up for it 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.950
 I never pay any case 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.840
 I'll never share either, and that's why 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.880
 is said at and the people here 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.780
 I think it would be so I can 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.240
 help you today 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.680
 there are somehow some or video 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.170
 that somehow posted it 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.240
 certain person whose I 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.740
 I could always say that this 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.870
 wise then look at the comments 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:58.540
 read about it the name of the 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.770
 Often mentioned the iss could be but 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.150
 Now it really is crazy 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.700
 I do not care because I had 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:08.560
 nothing to do with me 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:09.850
 and that much is said and I hope 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:15.370
 Now that's the story here 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:18.760
 The end is over because I have 1000 fans 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.980
 get because the terrain you and 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.640
 thank you again for fries 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:26.050
 average 12 1 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.270
 tomorrow, neither will be better 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.040
 somehow had no desire to cut 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:33.150
 And so in any case was maybe 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.150
 also a normal comments
