paddling the most smoothly comfortably
and<00:00:36.670> efficiently<00:00:37.440> let's<00:00:38.440> start<00:00:38.680> by<00:00:38.800> looking

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:38.950 
and efficiently let's start by looking

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.120 
and efficiently let's start by looking
at<00:00:39.160> the<00:00:39.280> anatomy<00:00:39.520> of<00:00:39.730> a<00:00:39.880> paddle<00:00:40.230> at<00:00:41.230> the<00:00:41.380> top<00:00:41.590> we

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:42.130 
at the anatomy of a paddle at the top we

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.400 
at the anatomy of a paddle at the top we
have<00:00:42.280> what's<00:00:42.460> called<00:00:42.610> the<00:00:42.730> T<00:00:42.910> grip<00:00:43.290> then<00:00:44.290> we

you are the bigger the blade you can

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.180 
you are the bigger the blade you can
handle<00:01:37.270> however<00:01:38.020> a<00:01:38.290> bigger<00:01:38.710> blade<00:01:39.010> isn't

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.190 
handle however a bigger blade isn't

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.070 
handle however a bigger blade isn't
always<00:01:39.430> better<00:01:39.729> because<00:01:40.450> smaller<00:01:40.780> blades

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
always better because smaller blades

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.600 
always better because smaller blades
tend<00:01:41.350> to<00:01:41.409> be<00:01:41.500> easier<00:01:41.650> on<00:01:41.979> your<00:01:42.100> joints<00:01:42.130> and

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
tend to be easier on your joints and

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.190 
tend to be easier on your joints and
allow<00:01:43.030> you<00:01:43.090> to<00:01:43.240> paddle<00:01:43.510> with<00:01:43.900> a<00:01:43.930> higher

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
allow you to paddle with a higher

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.130 
allow you to paddle with a higher
cadence<00:01:45.360> most<00:01:46.360> stand-up<00:01:46.690> paddles<00:01:47.020> on<00:01:47.110> the

market today have a blade that's canted
forwards<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:51.100> reason<00:01:51.400> for<00:01:51.549> this<00:01:51.700> is<00:01:51.909> so<00:01:52.270> you

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
forwards the reason for this is so you

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.030 
forwards the reason for this is so you
get<00:01:52.510> the<00:01:52.630> most<00:01:52.840> energy<00:01:53.140> out<00:01:53.470> of<00:01:53.590> the<00:01:53.650> paddle

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 
get the most energy out of the paddle

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.890 
get the most energy out of the paddle
and<00:01:54.250> out<00:01:54.580> of<00:01:54.700> your<00:01:54.820> blade<00:01:55.060> when<00:01:55.570> you're<00:01:55.720> in<00:01:55.810> the

use<00:02:00.400> the<00:02:00.520> paddle<00:02:00.820> backwards<00:02:01.090> if<00:02:01.750> you're<00:02:01.960> doing

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:02.260 
use the paddle backwards if you're doing

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:03.600 
use the paddle backwards if you're doing
this<00:02:02.409> you're<00:02:02.860> going<00:02:02.950> to<00:02:03.010> be<00:02:03.100> scooping<00:02:03.549> water

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
this you're going to be scooping water

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:04.859

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
and you're going to be much less

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:06.870 
and you're going to be much less

backwards the last thing we're going to
look<00:02:15.670> at<00:02:15.850> are<00:02:16.030> the<00:02:16.120> materials<00:02:16.660> that<00:02:16.750> go<00:02:16.900> into

making a paddle and this has the biggest

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:30.870 
if you're looking at price however they
also<00:02:29.769> tend<00:02:30.070> to<00:02:30.100> be<00:02:30.190> a<00:02:30.250> little<00:02:30.459> bit<00:02:30.579> heavier

than others these paddles will

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.130 
than others these paddles will
definitely<00:02:33.730> do<00:02:33.819> the<00:02:33.940> job<00:02:33.970> in<00:02:34.390> mild<00:02:34.599> conditions

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
definitely do the job in mild conditions

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.839 
definitely do the job in mild conditions
