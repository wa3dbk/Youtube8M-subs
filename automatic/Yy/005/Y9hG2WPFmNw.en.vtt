00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.730
 we equip ourselves with this video 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.690
 company of nick devolution seven 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.570
 guys in this new video we see 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:13.019
 how to optimize the local disk CEO 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.230
 there is data storage unit e 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.980
 than to say the same operating system 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.109
 is windows 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:23.310
 then here people never come all 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:27.390
 data and having neither program nor already killed 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:30.060
 and let's say let's check the whole gucci 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.780
 from the last operating system if it 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:36.210
 let's do a right rate property 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:38.820
 we can also appreciate it and will give us here 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.489
 then here was really the general 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.040
 then we must either perform the two 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.960
 operations the punishment the record was 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.960
 first we put police disk 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.379
 let's allow blacks and here 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.899
 get emulated downloaded programs on 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:58.660
 trash and temporary files hurt in 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:00.670
 the fighter bolan is enough 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:06.399
 low previews that says when we put 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:09.790
 ok yes and we await the police of the i 

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:13.299
 various files and did not do one 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.130
 quick puffin now to optimize 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:18.220
 even better 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:20.770
 let's say better days in the coming days 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.410
 the functions gives us makes the 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.679
 defragmentation then the operation lo 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.490
 half was the optimization 

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:29.050
 optimization of a destination with zones a 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:33.280
 commit them to work more 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:37.240
 efficient we put it optimizes the 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:41.550
 We bet optimizes in a 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.550
 first time it will analyze it 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.539
 and we say it has already fallen from fast 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:58.780
 and then it will do the defragmentation e 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:01.150
 the golds are definitely reasonable 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.150
 function was the system at this point 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:06.310
 property that is, it would be a symbol 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.890
 The disc is doing well 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.460
 let's correct the variators a little 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:16.180
 now it has passed to the passage where I will do the 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:18.610
 retouched unlocked where the only one at all is 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.790
 for let's say then finish two for the 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:24.160
 final check and here it would take a while 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:29.410
 time guys see you later when 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:32.560
 now finished well guys after a couple of 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.940
 long ago by a couple of roccati 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.160
 will do a couple of defragmentation 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:41.680
 after which we still await his 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:44.980
 daughter well thanks in the end will make a 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:48.840
 let's say a short consolidated one 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:51.840
 controlled and will end game ends 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.840
 radicalization 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:03:00.750
 good guys once life we ​​say the 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:03.060
 defragmentation which will succeed ok that 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:07.110
 been executed on the last day at what time 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:10.560
 and salt followed by fragmentation is 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:15.570
 finished and precisely we admired the 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:20.490
 stations of the let's say of the hard 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:24.570
 disk I do now will tell you a lot 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:26.910
 faster these guys light roses 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:29.580
 video passages really had a lot 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:32.430
 simple and to me it 's fine if kubilay da 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:35.190
 all about police and determination 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:38.340
 of disc that I am heart to 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:40.140
 optimization good guys there 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.550
 see you at the next video and there is everything from 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.550
