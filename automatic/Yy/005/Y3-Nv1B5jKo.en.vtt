00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
completely out of a very thick paper

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.320 
completely out of a very thick paper
pretty<00:00:27.210> much<00:00:27.330> just<00:00:27.570> like<00:00:27.720> cardstock<00:00:28.590> and<00:00:29.330> I

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
pretty much just like cardstock and I

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.479 
pretty much just like cardstock and I
got<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.080> template<00:00:31.590> online<00:00:33.079> spent<00:00:34.489> several

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
got the template online spent several

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.790 
got the template online spent several
hours<00:00:36.800> folding<00:00:38.780> the<00:00:39.780> part<00:00:40.050> well<00:00:40.320> first<00:00:40.620> of<00:00:40.739> all

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
hours folding the part well first of all

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.440 
hours folding the part well first of all
cutting<00:00:41.219> them<00:00:41.340> out<00:00:42.620> then<00:00:43.620> folding<00:00:44.280> them<00:00:44.489> then

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
cutting them out then folding them then

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.690

gluing<00:00:45.930> it<00:00:46.140> all<00:00:46.260> together<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:48.200> now<00:00:49.489> it<00:00:50.489> will

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
gluing it all together and now it will

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.520 
gluing it all together and now it will
fit<00:00:51.000> on<00:00:51.030> it's<00:00:51.360> actually<00:00:51.539> bigger<00:00:52.140> than<00:00:52.410> I

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
fit on it's actually bigger than I

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.779 
fit on it's actually bigger than I
wanted<00:00:52.949> it<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.250> be<00:00:53.430> but<00:00:53.899> you<00:00:54.899> know<00:00:55.579> yes<00:00:56.579> that's

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
wanted it to be but you know yes that's

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.450 
wanted it to be but you know yes that's
okay<00:00:57.180> because<00:00:57.449> it<00:00:57.719> still<00:00:58.050> turned<00:00:58.859> out<00:00:59.070> looking

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
okay because it still turned out looking

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.619 
okay because it still turned out looking
pretty<00:00:59.699> good<00:01:01.670> several<00:01:02.670> things<00:01:02.910> I<00:01:03.149> could<00:01:03.329> do<00:01:03.480> to

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
pretty good several things I could do to

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.780 
pretty good several things I could do to
make<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:03.840> look<00:01:04.140> better<00:01:04.350> I<00:01:04.530> could<00:01:04.769> even<00:01:04.920> add

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
make it look better I could even add

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.929 
make it look better I could even add
LEDs<00:01:06.450> on<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.780> sides<00:01:07.229> like<00:01:07.710> some<00:01:08.549> people<00:01:08.820> have

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
LEDs on the sides like some people have

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.649 
LEDs on the sides like some people have
done<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:10.549> of<00:01:11.549> course<00:01:11.790> I<00:01:11.880> made<00:01:12.060> it<00:01:12.150> look<00:01:12.270> battle

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
done and of course I made it look battle

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.370 
done and of course I made it look battle
damaged<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:13.260> everything<00:01:13.880> but<00:01:14.880> if<00:01:15.869> you<00:01:16.020> do<00:01:16.170> put

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
damaged and everything but if you do put

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.539 
damaged and everything but if you do put
it<00:01:16.500> on<00:01:16.820> you<00:01:17.820> can't<00:01:18.090> see<00:01:18.420> out<00:01:18.659> of<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.869> visor

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 
it on you can't see out of the visor

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:24.020 
it on you can't see out of the visor
simply<00:01:20.549> because<00:01:22.130> pretty<00:01:23.130> much<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.460> only<00:01:23.490> way

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
simply because pretty much the only way

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.920 
simply because pretty much the only way
the<00:01:24.720> only<00:01:24.900> thing<00:01:24.960> you<00:01:25.229> can<00:01:25.409> do<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:26.420> get<00:01:27.420> a<00:01:27.479> gold

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
the only thing you can do to get a gold

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.420 
the only thing you can do to get a gold
buzzer<00:01:28.259> like<00:01:28.710> this<00:01:28.979> that<00:01:29.189> you<00:01:29.280> can<00:01:29.310> actually

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
buzzer like this that you can actually

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:37.390 
buzzer like this that you can actually
see<00:01:30.000> out<00:01:30.180> of<00:01:30.650> would<00:01:31.650> be<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:33.470> buy<00:01:34.470> like<00:01:34.829> a<00:01:34.860> $40

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400 
see out of would be to buy like a $40

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.760 
see out of would be to buy like a $40
motorcycle<00:01:38.400> visor<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.600> I<00:01:40.380> didn't<00:01:40.619> want<00:01:40.740> to

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
motorcycle visor and I didn't want to

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.740 
motorcycle visor and I didn't want to
spend<00:01:41.070> that<00:01:41.310> much<00:01:41.549> on<00:01:41.700> a<00:01:41.759> homemade<00:01:42.180> project

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
spend that much on a homemade project

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:49.580 
spend that much on a homemade project
like<00:01:42.960> this<00:01:43.610> so<00:01:44.610> I<00:01:45.030> just<00:01:45.799> used<00:01:46.799> basically<00:01:48.590> like

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
like this so I just used basically like

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.510 
like this so I just used basically like
cellophane<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:51.409> more<00:01:52.409> of<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.649> same<00:01:52.890> like

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
cellophane and more of the same like

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.990 
cellophane and more of the same like
card<00:01:53.850> stock<00:01:54.149> material<00:01:54.860> now<00:01:55.860> you<00:01:56.790> probably

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
card stock material now you probably

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.870 
card stock material now you probably
think<00:01:57.210> that<00:01:57.659> it's<00:01:57.810> you

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
think that it's you

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.980 
think that it's you
fragile<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:01.070> easy<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.430> damage<00:02:03.210> and<00:02:03.450> whatnot

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
fragile and easy to damage and whatnot

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.059 
fragile and easy to damage and whatnot
but<00:02:04.020> really<00:02:04.619> I<00:02:04.829> used<00:02:05.700> I<00:02:06.509> didn't<00:02:06.990> use<00:02:07.470> the<00:02:07.649> resin

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
but really I used I didn't use the resin

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.910 
but really I used I didn't use the resin
method<00:02:08.459> and<00:02:08.610> like<00:02:09.479> some<00:02:09.750> people<00:02:10.050> did<00:02:10.619> or<00:02:10.860> the

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
method and like some people did or the

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.440 
method and like some people did or the
bondo<00:02:11.340> or<00:02:11.370> anything<00:02:11.670> like<00:02:12.000> that<00:02:12.060> but<00:02:13.430> it<00:02:14.430> has<00:02:14.940> a

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
bondo or anything like that but it has a

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.250 
bondo or anything like that but it has a
couple<00:02:16.410> coats<00:02:16.709> of<00:02:16.950> polyurethane<00:02:17.310> on<00:02:18.120> it<00:02:18.330> as

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
couple coats of polyurethane on it as

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.460 
couple coats of polyurethane on it as
well<00:02:19.470> as<00:02:19.650> the<00:02:19.739> pain<00:02:19.950> of<00:02:20.190> course<00:02:20.540> so<00:02:21.540> it's

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
well as the pain of course so it's

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.740 
well as the pain of course so it's
really<00:02:22.680> you<00:02:22.920> know<00:02:23.840> it's<00:02:24.840> pretty<00:02:25.200> tough<00:02:26.720> yeah

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
really you know it's pretty tough yeah

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.449 
really you know it's pretty tough yeah
decided<00:02:28.970> I'd<00:02:29.970> show<00:02:30.330> this<00:02:30.599> just<00:02:31.170> in<00:02:31.739> comparison

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
decided I'd show this just in comparison

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:37.780 
decided I'd show this just in comparison
to<00:02:32.489> whatever<00:02:33.480> else<00:02:33.930> people<00:02:34.350> have<00:02:34.590> made

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.539 

I'd<00:02:38.790> say<00:02:39.030> it<00:02:39.180> turned<00:02:39.330> out<00:02:39.540> pretty<00:02:39.660> good<00:02:40.549> right

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:41.549 
I'd say it turned out pretty good right

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:43.340 
I'd say it turned out pretty good right
now<00:02:41.700> I've<00:02:41.880> stabbed<00:02:42.180> it<00:02:42.360> sitting<00:02:42.930> on<00:02:43.049> top<00:02:43.290> of

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
now I've stabbed it sitting on top of

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.830 
now I've stabbed it sitting on top of
our<00:02:43.560> TV<00:02:44.239> next<00:02:45.239> to<00:02:45.420> the<00:02:45.510> 360<00:02:45.959> of<00:02:46.319> course<00:02:46.530> song

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
our TV next to the 360 of course song

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.670 
our TV next to the 360 of course song
but<00:02:48.840> yeah<00:02:49.019> I<00:02:50.420> know<00:02:51.420> I<00:02:51.540> may<00:02:51.840> have<00:02:51.870> some<00:02:52.260> offers

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.289 
but yeah I know I may have some offers
I've<00:02:52.920> thought<00:02:53.130> about<00:02:53.190> putting<00:02:53.640> it<00:02:53.819> on<00:02:53.940> eBay

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
I've thought about putting it on eBay

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:57.440 
I've thought about putting it on eBay
I've<00:02:54.569> also<00:02:54.750> made<00:02:55.170> it<00:02:55.380> an<00:02:55.950> assault<00:02:56.730> rifle<00:02:56.880> -

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
I've also made it an assault rifle -

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.170 
I've also made it an assault rifle -
that's<00:02:57.810> not<00:02:58.019> done<00:02:58.610> starting<00:02:59.610> getting<00:02:59.819> around

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
that's not done starting getting around

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.240 
that's not done starting getting around
to<00:03:00.299> finish<00:03:00.599> painting<00:03:00.900> it<00:03:01.140> but<00:03:01.890> I'll<00:03:02.069> probably

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
to finish painting it but I'll probably

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:08.660 
to finish painting it but I'll probably
have<00:03:02.549> a<00:03:02.580> video<00:03:02.910> of<00:03:03.060> that<00:03:03.299> too<00:03:03.570> but<00:03:06.049> yeah<00:03:07.670> I'm

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
have a video of that too but yeah I'm

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:21.050 
have a video of that too but yeah I'm
not<00:03:08.940> me<00:03:09.150> so<00:03:10.019> it<00:03:17.720> did<00:03:19.160> it<00:03:20.160> actually<00:03:20.519> only<00:03:20.670> took

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
not me so it did it actually only took

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.000 
not me so it did it actually only took
it<00:03:21.720> didn't<00:03:21.989> take<00:03:22.140> as<00:03:22.290> long<00:03:22.500> as<00:03:22.739> you<00:03:22.859> might

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
it didn't take as long as you might

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.270 
it didn't take as long as you might
think<00:03:23.070> it<00:03:23.489> only<00:03:23.670> took<00:03:23.940> about<00:03:25.040> less<00:03:26.040> than<00:03:26.220> a

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
think it only took about less than a

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.840 
think it only took about less than a
week<00:03:27.109> first<00:03:28.109> you<00:03:28.290> know<00:03:28.410> I<00:03:28.769> wanted<00:03:29.519> to<00:03:29.670> finish

wanted to go ahead and finish it so I

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.500
