get<00:01:37.680> all<00:01:37.950> that<00:01:38.299> spread<00:01:39.299> out<00:01:39.479> I<00:01:39.509> try<00:01:39.810> two

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
get all that spread out I try two

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.350 
get all that spread out I try two
different<00:01:40.130> sense<00:01:41.130> of<00:01:41.310> these<00:01:41.400> one<00:01:41.790> is<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:41.939> just<00:01:42.270> a

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
different sense of these one is a just a

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.130 
different sense of these one is a just a
cocoa<00:01:42.659> butter

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
cocoa butter

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.639 
cocoa butter
yes<00:01:43.619> cocoa<00:01:44.130> radiant<00:01:44.880> and<00:01:45.140> then<00:01:46.140> this<00:01:46.259> one<00:01:46.500> is

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
yes cocoa radiant and then this one is

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.289 
yes cocoa radiant and then this one is
an<00:01:46.860> aloe<00:01:47.130> fresh<00:01:47.960> I<00:01:49.700> probably<00:01:50.700> like<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:51.030> cocoa

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
an aloe fresh I probably like the cocoa

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.980 
an aloe fresh I probably like the cocoa
butter<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.540> little<00:01:51.659> bit<00:01:51.869> better<00:01:52.049> smell<00:01:52.710> wise

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
butter a little bit better smell wise

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.480 
butter a little bit better smell wise
it's<00:01:54.990> I<00:01:55.320> think<00:01:55.380> pretty<00:01:55.710> much<00:01:55.799> a<00:01:55.950> traditional

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
it's I think pretty much a traditional

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.100 
it's I think pretty much a traditional
cocoa<00:01:56.729> butter<00:01:57.030> what<00:01:57.210> do<00:01:57.270> you<00:01:57.329> think<00:01:57.540> I<00:01:57.780> think

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.770 
so and I think you love your cocoa care
lip<00:02:01.259> balm<00:02:01.530> so<00:02:01.710> darn<00:02:02.219> much<00:02:02.310> but<00:02:03.060> we've

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
lip balm so darn much but we've

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.600 
lip balm so darn much but we've
attracted<00:02:04.259> to<00:02:04.770> that<00:02:04.860> maybe<00:02:05.130> that's<00:02:05.340> what's

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
attracted to that maybe that's what's

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.059 
attracted to that maybe that's what's
drawing<00:02:05.909> me<00:02:06.149> in<00:02:06.329> yeah<00:02:06.689> I<00:02:06.960> like<00:02:07.259> that<00:02:07.290> one<00:02:07.469> too

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
drawing me in yeah I like that one too

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.130 
drawing me in yeah I like that one too
see<00:02:08.429> I<00:02:08.700> thought<00:02:09.179> when<00:02:09.390> I<00:02:09.420> put<00:02:09.599> this<00:02:09.750> on<00:02:09.899> I

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
see I thought when I put this on I

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.740 
see I thought when I put this on I
almost<00:02:10.289> smell<00:02:10.770> a<00:02:10.800> little<00:02:11.220> bit<00:02:11.340> like

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
almost smell a little bit like

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.010 
almost smell a little bit like
I'd<00:02:11.840> like<00:02:12.050> a<00:02:12.200> whiskey<00:02:12.910> smell<00:02:13.910> like<00:02:14.360> just<00:02:14.780> kind

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
I'd like a whiskey smell like just kind

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.110 
I'd like a whiskey smell like just kind
of<00:02:15.080> subtly<00:02:15.500> in<00:02:15.650> there<00:02:15.920> she<00:02:16.700> looked<00:02:16.880> at<00:02:16.940> me<00:02:17.030> like

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
of subtly in there she looked at me like

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.720 
of subtly in there she looked at me like
I<00:02:17.270> was<00:02:17.390> crazy<00:02:17.420> when<00:02:17.810> I<00:02:17.930> said<00:02:18.170> that<00:02:18.250> but<00:02:19.250> I<00:02:19.280> I

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
I was crazy when I said that but I I

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.150 
I was crazy when I said that but I I
still<00:02:19.970> think<00:02:20.420> it<00:02:20.510> does<00:02:20.690> just<00:02:21.590> a<00:02:21.710> little<00:02:21.980> bit

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
still think it does just a little bit

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.560 
still think it does just a little bit
this<00:02:22.550> one<00:02:22.760> is<00:02:22.880> more<00:02:23.060> of<00:02:23.090> a<00:02:23.300> typical<00:02:24.170> allo<00:02:25.570> smell

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
this one is more of a typical allo smell

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.080 
this one is more of a typical allo smell
neither<00:02:26.840> one<00:02:27.080> of<00:02:27.110> them<00:02:27.320> our<00:02:27.980> objection<00:02:28.730> we're

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
neither one of them our objection we're

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.449 
neither one of them our objection we're
just<00:02:29.360> both<00:02:29.480> very<00:02:29.810> neutral<00:02:30.470> so<00:02:30.950> it's<00:02:31.100> just<00:02:31.190> kind

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
just both very neutral so it's just kind

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:32.530 
just both very neutral so it's just kind
of<00:02:31.490> nice<00:02:31.580> and<00:02:31.790> clean<00:02:31.970> and<00:02:32.209> this<00:02:32.300> one's<00:02:32.480> a

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
of nice and clean and this one's a

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.600 
of nice and clean and this one's a
little<00:02:32.690> more<00:02:32.900> of<00:02:33.110> a<00:02:33.230> I<00:02:33.470> don't<00:02:34.190> even<00:02:34.310> know<00:02:34.490> how

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
little more of a I don't even know how

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.130 
little more of a I don't even know how
to<00:02:34.640> describe<00:02:34.790> it<00:02:35.209> I<00:02:35.360> usually<00:02:35.780> put<00:02:35.900> on<00:02:35.959> some

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
to describe it I usually put on some

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.390 
to describe it I usually put on some
body<00:02:36.290> spray<00:02:36.590> or<00:02:36.680> something<00:02:36.830> it's<00:02:37.160> not<00:02:37.220> going

it's centered up and be real careful

it's centered up and be real careful
when<00:02:49.340> you're<00:02:49.430> pushing<00:02:50.060> down<00:02:50.239> on<00:02:50.420> it<00:02:50.780> to<00:02:50.930> not

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
move it back over because the first time

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.040 
move it back over because the first time
I<00:02:53.209> used<00:02:53.600> it<00:02:53.840> I<00:02:54.650> had<00:02:55.520> the<00:02:55.670> lid<00:02:56.239> closed<00:02:56.660> just<00:02:56.959> a

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
I used it I had the lid closed just a

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:58.660 
I used it I had the lid closed just a
little<00:02:57.350> bit<00:02:57.560> and<00:02:57.950> then<00:02:58.130> it<00:02:58.220> shoots<00:02:58.400> out<00:02:58.610> like

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
little bit and then it shoots out like

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.760 
little bit and then it shoots out like
in<00:02:58.910> just<00:02:59.060> a<00:02:59.150> little<00:02:59.420> narrow<00:02:59.660> stream<00:03:00.170> and<00:03:00.470> it

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 
in just a little narrow stream and it

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.160 
in just a little narrow stream and it
just<00:03:00.950> like<00:03:01.100> ends<00:03:01.760> up<00:03:01.850> a<00:03:01.940> little<00:03:02.180> line<00:03:02.420> on<00:03:02.810> there

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
just like ends up a little line on there

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.110 
just like ends up a little line on there
instead<00:03:03.470> actually<00:03:03.620> spread<00:03:04.250> it<00:03:04.370> around<00:03:04.489> so<00:03:04.910> as

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
instead actually spread it around so as

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
instead actually spread it around so as
a<00:03:05.150> non<00:03:05.620> lotion<00:03:06.620> user<00:03:06.980> for<00:03:07.850> the<00:03:07.940> most<00:03:08.150> part<00:03:08.510> you

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
a non lotion user for the most part you

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.020 
a non lotion user for the most part you
think<00:03:09.380> these<00:03:09.560> will<00:03:10.010> change<00:03:10.340> your<00:03:10.580> tune<00:03:10.760> and

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
think these will change your tune and

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:12.400 
think these will change your tune and
you<00:03:11.060> think<00:03:11.270> you'll<00:03:11.390> probably<00:03:11.570> consistently

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
you think you'll probably consistently

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:13.810 
you think you'll probably consistently
like<00:03:12.620> you<00:03:12.830> sees<00:03:13.070> after<00:03:13.220> you<00:03:13.430> get<00:03:13.520> out<00:03:13.670> of<00:03:13.700> the

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
like you sees after you get out of the

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:15.550 
like you sees after you get out of the
shower<00:03:14.030> I<00:03:14.360> will<00:03:14.780> use<00:03:14.959> them<00:03:15.110> much<00:03:15.320> more

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
shower I will use them much more
