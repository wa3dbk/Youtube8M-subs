00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.950
 I tell you beauty, I'll give it to you. 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.799
 people how to improve performance are 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.230
 genes first tablet or smartphone 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:14.130
 I played with genes and small and s 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.690
 using romi black hawk and we will not 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.770
 give nothing if you are cutting the new 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.390
 car or with ons to change anything in the 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.510
 Wow, you guys really change 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.060
 improve the performance of him good doctor 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.900
 when you lower a north launch more 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.210
 Light 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.149
 The director for you today is the minimal x 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:37.290
 good and sign it comes with the interface 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:41.160
 android 4.4 kitkat can see a 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.260
 launcher in place a very light 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.829
 smooth transition and the most 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.530
 interesting 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.739
 I find this peak it does not keep running in 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.399
 background as others can see here 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.989
 O 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.989
 maybe running apps 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:07.250
 interesting also only that he occupies 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:07.250
 only 1 mega of memory only one 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:13.229
 better yield 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:20.340
 the device may also lower the 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:22.950
 application called who it releases 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.240
 your device can see here 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.240
 memory boost 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.040
 it will collect the applications it is 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:38.350
 running in the background 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:41.200
 you can boost 6316 megabytes of 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.960
 released memory 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.420
 um here 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.759
 to unwanted platts it will make a 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.759
 you should scour your device and go 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:53.229
 look for useless files good here 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:56.020
 Since I already did this procedure there is no 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:58.330
 unnecessary risks and also has the 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.840
 backup option 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:04.780
 the application manager can move 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:08.350
 application capable of doing up the 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.399
 application and also has the option to 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.890
 privacy 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.230
 this function I found interesting you can 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.660
 delete your messages and msc the registry 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:20.290
 call and other apps' cache 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:23.920
 how to tread p you browsing youtube 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:26.709
 play only navigation such is this function 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.110
 interesting that you will change the 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:31.120
 You do not have to be going. 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:34.180
 directly into the vital application and 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.720
 clearing the history or deleting one by 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.180
 one 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:40.209
 this very interesting function and another 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:43.900
 another tip of the doctor you too 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:50.860
 settings are in the 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:53.769
 developer and enable the force the 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.600
 gp realization and the collar use the 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:58.900
 radio federation and two to apply the 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:02.890
 rainy and turn off the download option from 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:05.290
 Animation off animation window 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.769
 when you click an application and it 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.720
 log in 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:11.010
 you leave application turned off this 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:15.730
 function off size collaborating 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:18.220
 for the best performance are appliances 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.600
 another hint of personal position is to exclude 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.880
 those unnecessary sugar 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.890
 unnecessary as the appliance has 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.650
 only 512 megabytes of ram 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.510
 there's no way I can install the applications 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.299
 then be restricted only to the fall of 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.459
 assets that I like, you can see me 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:36.700
 I have family I have few applications 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:40.080
 I use only what is needed 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.080
 you may be excluding 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:46.060
 the desired applications and 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:50.290
 large applications such as games can 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.940
 be moving your device sd memory 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.340
 as I do not have any application from a 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:58.690
 play here will not have to show to 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:59.379
 you you can be seeing the card 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:05.430
 sd 

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:10.239
 you can see a sd card here 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:15.430
 I have 95 baptized and two gigabytes 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:18.760
 books and main memory in 702 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:23.680
 free megawatts to show you 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:25.150
 applications running or 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.639
 delete applications run in second 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.440
 plan against facebook for example I 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:32.740
 I chose this book and tried to 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:38.800
 alarm because it occupies incredible 40 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:40.990
 megabytes of memory and I prefer to use 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:47.919
 he for the a for myself justly 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:50.710
 to ram seeing I have 54 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:55.900
 megabytes free but may vary the maximum 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:58.900
 who managed it was 160 staff with this 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.250
 I realized that to access the application 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:03.400
 it was much faster 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:07.630
 the idea is to uncheck the scale option 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:12.010
 to free the RAM memory and the 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:18.099
 Talk also about the game. 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:20.940
 it has two options with just one click 

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:22.570
 you optimize your device's ram memory 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:24.789
 of the base 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:28.990
 the ELISAL with this procedure can 

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:30.099
 realize that the application transition 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:31.750
 the exchange of assets 

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:34.419
 and to enter the application was very 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:37.479
 faster for example the opera mini 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:40.360
 Before I needed the screen myself. 

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:42.940
 black take a while then lift the 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.900
 there when you enter the 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:48.240
 app 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:48.240
 then they can see that the improved dell 

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:56.310
 it was much faster 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:58.919
 took a while but was much more 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:02.430
 fast before we live our temple 

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:04.590
 where was the application took one year 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:07.710
 now it's much faster than I use 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:09.840
 A lot, the one for me is special. 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:13.800
 I hope it has helped you if these 

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:15.840
 Simple tips you will notice you will 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.940
 to notice the difference in your device 

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:20.099
 Because it 's personal, I hope you like it and 

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:22.740
 very short video writes on the channel 

00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:24.780
 Do not miss out on passing by. 

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:27.979
 Give a little blogger, okay, okay. 

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:27.979
 staff to the next video
