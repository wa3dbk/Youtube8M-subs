long
that's<00:02:22.170> about<00:02:22.530> um<00:02:22.910> looks<00:02:23.910> like<00:02:24.090> almost<00:02:24.450> a<00:02:25.100> inch

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
that's about um looks like almost a inch

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.280 
that's about um looks like almost a inch
and<00:02:26.250> a<00:02:26.340> quarter<00:02:26.580> to<00:02:27.060> an<00:02:27.240> inch<00:02:27.420> and<00:02:27.600> a<00:02:27.630> half<00:02:27.660> of

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
right on track because of course the

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.530 
right on track because of course the
