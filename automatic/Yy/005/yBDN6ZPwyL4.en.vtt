00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.000
 Come, take a chair 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
 Let's start with the questions my love 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 Eehh assistant the cloth to embolarle the girl please 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 How am I doing, miss, well, with that beauty you make me nervous 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 I'm going to ask you the first question 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 Ehh, to you who is sponsoring her in this reign? 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 Look! you heard, I believe that I am sponsored by the white brandy of the valley because I am the target of all eyes. 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 See and I see you as well as beautiful, all replies, what music do you hear? 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 You heard, because I like it as well as the CD's music, I think that because it's the best 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 Ahh and you who are so beautiful, a rose fell from the sky and your mother picked it up and see how beautiful it was 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 Ehh, I'm going to ask you a question, do you think about gay marriages? 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 What happens is that good I think that now you have to live as a free union, or say that man with man, woman with woman and in the same way in the opposite direction, do you understand? 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 See beauty and do you when you study in the university and teach you philosophy, what did you learn? 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 Mirá vé I saw philosophy in the university the pontifical one of San Pachito de Belalcazar and I saw a semester in philosophy and I learned that, osse, what everybody knows, that platón invented the dishes and confucius the confusion, obvious 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 And so a tricky question, do you think of hunger in Afrique? 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 I think that the situation of hunger in Afrique is very good because they make a diet super great and have a figure!, Definitely. 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 See, another question, what kind of silícona do you use, because you are very much in the know? 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 Ayyy, well look, I use the silícona the house to glue the tablecloths, organize Christmas things, if you understand me? 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 Can you be a busy woman? I am going to ask you the last question. What do you think about the role of women in Colombia? 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:33.000
 You can play the role of women in Colombia I believe that women have to value ourselves and believe the story that we have to value ourselves and we have to walk in BMW, Mazda, with brand clothes, that kind of thing. 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 So I can see you as a half brutish, because I tell you one thing, they will not be like her, I study because if you young people do not assume the direction of your own country, nobody, NO ONE, will do it for you! 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
