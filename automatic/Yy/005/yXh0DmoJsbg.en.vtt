00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.760
 in the basket you are going to take a 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:29.709

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.510

 show you how to close the basket too 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.110
 so that the heat stays in the 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.750
 same and this is all that is module 1 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.400
 ok module 1 you pass from the armed 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.709
 the basket to the closed of the basket with 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.209
 the bags in that as I already know 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.920
 mention you are going to take a basket 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.630
 with tacos with 100 tacos 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.099
 so it's really worth it because 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.140
 then you will take for the family 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:07.269
 for friends for acquaintances to 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.860
 that you give them to approve something that you 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:11.769
 did you give your point a point 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.900
 ok ok view that's module 1 the 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:16.329
 module 2 this module I really like 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.129
 especially because with this this module 2 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:20.890
 We take away the fear of initiating 

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:22.269
 people have ever been afraid of 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.319
 make an investment and lose your 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:25.030
 money 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:27.849
 have ever been afraid to start 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.829
 a business to hunt sometime you 've 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:32.260
 I'm afraid that the family will 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:34.689
 recriminate because you have not been able to achieve 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.549
 nothing of what you have proposed you good 

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:38.590
 so welcome to module 2 we are the 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:40.540

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.730
 business ok 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.680
 when we start a business we need 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.530
 to carry we need to take a good road 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.870
 drawn a goal step by step what is 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.490
 have to do if you take step by step 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.070
 what I'm going to take you because I'm going to 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:00.840
 teach to do this next Saturday in 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.010
 the course that we are going to give the result 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.320
 what are you going to have definitely 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.210
 it's only up one of the 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.160
 best results you're going to get going 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:10.440
 to be with all the information that you're going to 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.840
 get this module the information that 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.620
 let's include in this module is how 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.850
 started a business how he started a business 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.560
 many times we think that nothing 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.989
 more put us in the corner with that and what 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.700
 let's start many we think that 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.980
 buying a bicycle already with that 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:28.410
 we have start our business there is no 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:30.450
 more garrafal form or larger errors 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.710
 than to think that way in reality today 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:34.170
 in business days have not worked 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.910
 they do not work that way anymore then 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:37.470
 we have to evolve in the form of 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.210
 think about when you start your 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.680
 I 'm going to teach you three 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:43.260
 strategies that you are going to develop 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:46.320
 to see which ones can be the best 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:48.390
 points of sale to get the best 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.280
 gain ok 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:52.950
 the second point that you are going to take in this 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:56.190
 in this module is how much I will invest 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:57.900
 and how much will I earn one of the best 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:01.830
 points that you have when you start a 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:03.750
 business is if I invest a peso 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:07.020
 how much will I recover from the weight 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:09.380
 how much will I earn that takes away your fear 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.580
 completely if today you today 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:13.710
 someone introduces himself to you and he 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:15.240
 invest 100 thousand pesos but you do not 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:17.340
 I guarantee that you will win then 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.290
 you definitely do not do it would be a 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.210
 madness is good you do not know how much you're going to 

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:22.920
 recover here I'll teach you if you 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.140
 you invest a peso how much you are going to earn 

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:26.940
 invest 100 pesos how much are you going to 

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:28.950
 recover and the intention of this is 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.900
 lose the fear that you know that of 

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:34.800
 Any way your money is insured 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:37.440
 because yes because I'm going to show you one of 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:39.540
 the strategies that brought us to us 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:42.060
 to grow from a point of view of 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:45.990
 sales to have more than 20 points of sale 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:47.940
 and in none have loss I would like 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:50.010
 know how not to have losses this flavor 

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:51.570
 I'm going to reveal it really is one of 

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:54.530
 those of the strategies that we 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:54.530
 they took to the summit
