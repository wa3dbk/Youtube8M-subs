creamy<00:02:38.239> top<00:02:38.660> note<00:02:39.070> for<00:02:40.070> the<00:02:40.220> whipped<00:02:40.370> cream

whatever<00:02:43.010> so<00:02:43.250> those<00:02:43.430> are<00:02:43.549> three<00:02:43.850> different

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
whatever so those are three different

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.650 
whatever so those are three different
flavors<00:02:44.829> cream<00:02:45.829> banana<00:02:46.519> and<00:02:46.820> whatever<00:02:47.360> you

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
flavors cream banana and whatever you

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.520 
flavors cream banana and whatever you
consider<00:02:48.019> crust<00:02:48.380> you<00:02:49.280> know<00:02:50.140> so<00:02:51.140> I<00:02:51.170> think<00:02:51.320> it'd

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
consider crust you know so I think it'd

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.860 
consider crust you know so I think it'd
be<00:02:51.650> really<00:02:51.920> hard<00:02:52.250> to<00:02:52.430> pinpoint<00:02:52.790> that<00:02:53.299> specific

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
be really hard to pinpoint that specific

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.390 
be really hard to pinpoint that specific
flavor<00:02:54.109> like<00:02:54.290> banana<00:02:54.709> cream<00:02:54.859> pie<00:02:56.950> so<00:02:57.950> no<00:02:58.190> I

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
flavor like banana cream pie so no I

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.800 
flavor like banana cream pie so no I
don't<00:02:58.579> think<00:02:58.910> it<00:02:59.000> tastes<00:02:59.239> like<00:02:59.359> banana<00:02:59.480> cream

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
don't think it tastes like banana cream

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.750 
don't think it tastes like banana cream
pie<00:03:00.109> however<00:03:00.650> I<00:03:00.739> still<00:03:01.040> really<00:03:01.220> like<00:03:01.400> it<00:03:01.579> and<00:03:01.700> I

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
pie however I still really like it and I

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.370 
pie however I still really like it and I
think<00:03:01.790> that<00:03:02.150> the<00:03:02.299> closest<00:03:02.840> thing<00:03:03.049> I<00:03:03.200> can

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
think that the closest thing I can

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.440 
think that the closest thing I can
describe<00:03:04.280> that<00:03:04.640> this<00:03:04.760> tastes<00:03:05.030> like<00:03:05.150> is<00:03:05.420> a

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
describe that this tastes like is a

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.090 
describe that this tastes like is a
combination<00:03:06.140> I<00:03:06.260> really<00:03:06.590> thought<00:03:06.709> about<00:03:06.769> this

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
combination I really thought about this

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.280 
combination I really thought about this
David<00:03:07.579> for<00:03:07.820> the<00:03:07.850> last<00:03:08.060> half-hour<00:03:08.480> on<00:03:08.750> this<00:03:08.900> one

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
David for the last half-hour on this one

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.830 
David for the last half-hour on this one
and<00:03:09.500> I<00:03:10.370> think<00:03:10.940> I've<00:03:11.060> nailed<00:03:11.239> it<00:03:11.510> it's<00:03:11.720> a

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
and I think I've nailed it it's a

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.080 
and I think I've nailed it it's a
combination<00:03:12.230> or<00:03:12.709> cross<00:03:13.100> between<00:03:13.310> banana

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
combination or cross between banana

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.270 
combination or cross between banana

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.300 
candies runs those bananas which is a
strong<00:03:19.670> fake<00:03:20.269> banana<00:03:21.200> flavor<00:03:21.560> with<00:03:22.070> some
