BlueStacks<00:00:52.570> don't<00:00:53.570> worry<00:00:53.809> about<00:00:53.960> it<00:00:54.289> on

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:54.550 
BlueStacks don't worry about it on

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.009 
BlueStacks don't worry about it on
everybody<00:00:55.550> else<00:00:55.760> really<00:00:56.090> uses<00:00:56.600> you<00:00:56.899> know

00:00:57.009 --> 00:00:57.019 
everybody else really uses you know

00:00:57.019 --> 00:00:59.889 
everybody else really uses you know
iPhone<00:00:57.730> and<00:00:58.730> stuff<00:00:59.059> like<00:00:59.210> that<00:00:59.420> Apple

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899 
iPhone and stuff like that Apple

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:02.319 
iPhone and stuff like that Apple
products<00:01:00.350> so<00:01:00.949> it's<00:01:01.280> a<00:01:01.399> little<00:01:01.670> different<00:01:01.940> like

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
products so it's a little different like

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:05.049 
products so it's a little different like
the<00:01:02.510> layout<00:01:02.899> so<00:01:03.260> anyway<00:01:03.739> the<00:01:03.890> first<00:01:04.129> step<00:01:04.519> to

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
the layout so anyway the first step to

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:07.270 
the layout so anyway the first step to
getting<00:01:05.269> your<00:01:05.390> base<00:01:05.690> back<00:01:06.050> would<00:01:06.800> be<00:01:06.830> to

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
getting your base back would be to

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.760 
getting your base back would be to
pressing<00:01:08.060> the<00:01:08.240> Settings<00:01:08.750> button<00:01:09.020> right<00:01:09.740> down

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
pressing the Settings button right down

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.330 
pressing the Settings button right down
here<00:01:10.280> and<00:01:10.460> then<00:01:11.259> you<00:01:12.259> want<00:01:12.470> to<00:01:12.560> go<00:01:12.710> and<00:01:13.039> press

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
here and then you want to go and press

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.980 
here and then you want to go and press
help<00:01:13.789> and<00:01:13.970> support<00:01:15.340> and<00:01:16.340> then<00:01:17.209> it's<00:01:17.390> obviously

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
help and support and then it's obviously

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.050 
help and support and then it's obviously
different<00:01:18.590> for<00:01:18.860> me<00:01:19.069> since<00:01:19.640> I'm<00:01:19.849> on<00:01:20.030> the

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
different for me since I'm on the

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.480 
different for me since I'm on the
BlueStacks<00:01:20.780> App<00:01:21.140> I'm<00:01:21.619> playing<00:01:21.979> on<00:01:22.130> my<00:01:22.250> laptop

BlueStacks App I'm playing on my laptop

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.050 
BlueStacks App I'm playing on my laptop
but<00:01:23.030> it<00:01:23.569> would<00:01:23.660> be<00:01:23.780> different<00:01:24.170> for<00:01:24.380> you<00:01:25.030> anyway

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
but it would be different for you anyway

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.199 
but it would be different for you anyway
I'm<00:01:26.750> just<00:01:26.989> gonna<00:01:27.110> go<00:01:27.349> into<00:01:27.649> villages<00:01:28.250> accounts

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
and passwords and then obviously this is

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.270 
and passwords and then obviously this is
