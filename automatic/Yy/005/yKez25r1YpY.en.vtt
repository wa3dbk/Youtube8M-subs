00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.240
 so people welcome to one 

00:00:02.139 --> 00:00:06.430
 another 20 plus this time with the aida 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.499
 on the map next to then you're on but 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:11.429
 then desert I do not know exactly 

00:00:08.499 --> 00:00:14.320
 I have today the number of members 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:20.830
 video to battlefield 3 experts 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:23.440
 well, I'm still beautiful 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.300
 never such a 1 1 in the heart area that 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.870
 Gameplay seen how the motorcycle would be 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.880
 i say i like the world but we will 

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:33.129
 have not really that prepared 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.539
 but we considered because we 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:36.070
 stop no topic we have to do 

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:37.899
 It's been a while since then 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.929
 with me with her now nothing less 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:43.659
 but definitely such a faq thing like that 

00:00:40.929 --> 00:00:46.449
 Ask and answer as the professionals do 

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:49.079
 say about pudding to say yes 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:52.269
 At least faq not so in question this 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.789
 question it was but everyone knows what 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:57.550
 You mean ok and therefore you can now 

00:00:54.789 --> 00:01:00.969
 probably if you want to ask 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:05.620
 in the comments put to me or to 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:06.940
 I do not know what we're thinking 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:11.340
 we're a bit different than that 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.340
 so ask each other the questions 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:18.700
 So I thought that I completely 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.830
 It's not so much fun that we sit then 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.540
 and there what are you doing how are you and 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.120
 what are you doing so i find the new one 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:28.870
 do not turn trailer of animals when 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:32.910
 I would ask something what if you were 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.910
 would you like to interview me? 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.360
 if we are not in the sun all the time 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.610
 is asked out and it is always that 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.140
 same and that's the way I ask 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.270
 Well, what do you ask me again? 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.730
 then I ask you again what yes 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:51.540
 know me because your infinite 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:51.540
 course link to subscribe 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:58.450
 So maybe I'll forget anyway 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.890
 but yes the description is linked 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.700
 not so hard 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:06.250
 so think but you already know 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.659
 I've been to a live show many times 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.570
 stream sometime when I times a 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:12.910
 made since there was a century off 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:15.400
 make my skype image my skype 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:19.200
 had windows in there and then there was 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.200
 Of course our window is open so ours 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.319
 where your picture was to be seen and then 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.120
 have a few people in the 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:27.459
 written comments in the chat 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.100
 that's the meadows is not that 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:32.320
 it's not that I think so 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:36.700
 a fraction of my eyes ducks 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:38.320
 knows you anyway and a little if there 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.030
 no questions come together then do 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:43.709
 you just twice as a video ding so 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:46.150
 always ask me anyway 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.320
 I do not need to make a video she could 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.300
 make it really cool because 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.709
 We know each other so well that I know yours 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.380
 So if someone asks you, ask questions 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:57.880
 what questions then do I answer for 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:03:01.110
 we are doing all these these 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:05.320
 now there is this whole 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:07.900
 often or golf wintek where the 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:11.829
 corresponding youtuber know his friend 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:14.620
 I have never seen anything but mine 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:28.510
 If you say that, I think I'm watching now 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:30.040
 not now it's out now 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.989
 Now I have to admit I have last 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:39.400
 sometimes where you put it back when I'm back 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:42.750
 our buddy here will be the netbook 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.670
 when I know what snap away 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.739
 shame on you 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:50.290
 I joined one in one 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:52.450
 a little bit clicked around again and then 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.950
 I have in the channels that one 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.900
 because I can not link to something I have 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:04:00.090
 clicked and then there was such a video 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.090
 make-up make-up of such a 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:07.490
 yes as hot as gore in the ozone 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:12.430
 made boyfriend corner where then stop the 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:12.430
 understand each other so much better 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:19.459
 here we can place in the 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:21.790
 video as you do not see it yet 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.790
 you see 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.210
 because here I almost died 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.200
 then harmony came in then I countered 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.850
 I shot him , I only have him 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.750
 once hit and then came along with 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.150
 I played 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.530
 the battery and has it for me and me 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:36.050
 he would not have been there 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:39.650
 I died cold, I was the stimulus 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:42.950
 bottom with the battery is the battery charge 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:44.120
 means he should also my headset 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:46.370
 do because there is not always there 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.210
 Everyone can unload it by now 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.890
 witness 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:52.000
 but what was the point now ? 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:55.460
 we want to do 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.639
 Make-up and make-up Oberin girl of 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:02.810
 brenntag we do or just 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:06.290
 ask and be as specific as this 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:07.930
 video here but we try 

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:10.400
 implement 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.450
 the one minute time we have now 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.400
 Here's what we want to do 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:14.630
 what was the longest washing powder for us ? 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:28.250
 the implement provide 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:29.780
 we can not do that with it 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.750
 you do not care or me so attacked 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:37.760
 feel here again 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:39.620
 I think I have 17 16 17 seats 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:41.600
 Merkel Oh no , that's not good 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:44.650
 I wanted to wanted it now today 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:48.580
 spoilers of the chancellor 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:48.580
 I can not promise something like that 

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:52.619
 but the video is one minute long 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.659
 That's why I can promise because it 

00:05:52.619 --> 00:05:56.249
 goes fast 

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:59.309
 when i have fully listened for i heard 

00:05:56.249 --> 00:06:03.889
 I can but I could not do anything 

00:05:59.309 --> 00:06:08.520
 but not really what it is now 

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:09.749
 Only 18 kills until I am full 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.099
 I wondered, that's how it was 

00:06:09.749 --> 00:06:12.300
 feel like I'm just seven today 

00:06:11.099 --> 00:06:14.459
 then I was done anyway 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:16.439
 only 18 to 19 I believe now 

00:06:14.459 --> 00:06:20.219
 It is still missing so much will mine 

00:06:16.439 --> 00:06:24.959
 hands were shaking or my hands were shaking 

00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:28.379
 shaking 420 I think I've got it 

00:06:24.959 --> 00:06:31.159
 here comes 21 okay we all have it 

00:06:28.379 --> 00:06:35.449
 understood and we say goodbye 

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:35.449
 see you next time until then
