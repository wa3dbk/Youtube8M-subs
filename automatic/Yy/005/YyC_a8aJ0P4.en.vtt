necessarily<00:00:31.180> us<00:00:31.330> being<00:00:31.660> the<00:00:31.750> best<00:00:32.019> i<00:00:32.230> think

00:00:32.249 --> 00:00:32.259 
necessarily us being the best i think

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:33.810

knowledge<00:00:33.940> so<00:00:34.720> the<00:00:34.840> more<00:00:35.050> you<00:00:35.170> learn<00:00:35.200> the<00:00:35.770> more

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.070 
knowledge so the more you learn the more

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.400 
knowledge so the more you learn the more
you<00:00:36.250> can<00:00:36.340> adapt<00:00:36.670> to<00:00:36.850> people<00:00:37.270> so<00:00:37.480> that<00:00:37.750> probably
