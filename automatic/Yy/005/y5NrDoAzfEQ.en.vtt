00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
what this guy can do is it can charge up

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.270 
what this guy can do is it can charge up
to<00:00:35.940> four<00:00:36.570> move<00:00:36.840> devices<00:00:37.350> so<00:00:37.590> theoretically

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
to four move devices so theoretically

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.880 
to four move devices so theoretically
the<00:00:40.550> 26<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:41.820> your<00:00:42.360> two<00:00:42.600> controllers<00:00:43.440> are<00:00:43.710> here

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
the 26 and your two controllers are here

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.160 
the 26 and your two controllers are here
your<00:00:44.010> navigators<00:00:44.550> can<00:00:44.760> be<00:00:44.879> charged<00:00:45.300> plus<00:00:45.870> it

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
your navigators can be charged plus it

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.590

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
this can charge four devices while the

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.310 
this can charge four devices while the
Sony<00:01:45.930> unit<00:01:46.320> can

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
Sony unit can

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:52.230 
Sony unit can
due<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:49.540> devices<00:01:50.140> you<00:01:50.290> know<00:01:50.409> just<00:01:50.860> the<00:01:51.240> move

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
due to devices you know just the move

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.620 
due to devices you know just the move
controller<00:01:52.690> and<00:01:53.020> the<00:01:53.560> navigator<00:01:54.070> and<00:01:54.630> you

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
controller and the navigator and you

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.190 
controller and the navigator and you
know<00:01:55.780> I<00:01:56.020> think<00:01:56.830> having<00:01:57.130> four<00:01:57.940> units<00:01:58.750> charged

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
know I think having four units charged

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.870 
know I think having four units charged
at<00:01:59.380> once<00:01:59.650> as<00:01:59.920> a<00:01:59.950> heck<00:02:00.220> of<00:02:00.280> a<00:02:00.369> lot<00:02:00.460> better<00:02:00.520> and<00:02:00.850> I

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
at once as a heck of a lot better and I

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.190 
at once as a heck of a lot better and I
think<00:02:00.910> the<00:02:01.150> majority<00:02:01.270> of<00:02:01.570> people<00:02:01.930> you<00:02:02.110> know

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
think the majority of people you know

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.390 
think the majority of people you know
unless<00:02:02.350> they're<00:02:02.619> really<00:02:02.830> just<00:02:02.890> playing<00:02:03.250> by

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.400 
unless they're really just playing by

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.370 
unless they're really just playing by
themselves<00:02:03.850> or<00:02:04.150> it's<00:02:04.930> gonna<00:02:05.080> have<00:02:05.920> more<00:02:06.340> than

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
themselves or it's gonna have more than

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.720 
themselves or it's gonna have more than
two<00:02:08.380> devices<00:02:08.709> sitting<00:02:09.160> around<00:02:09.369> I<00:02:11.610> really<00:02:12.610> got

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
two devices sitting around I really got

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.490 
two devices sitting around I really got
to<00:02:12.760> get<00:02:12.850> these<00:02:12.970> boxes<00:02:13.209> open<00:02:13.570> the<00:02:13.810> start<00:02:14.320> they

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:58.320 
the box the unitive song comes on this
nice<00:02:55.989> little<00:02:56.459> plastic<00:02:57.459> controller<00:02:57.850> with<00:02:58.209> the

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
nice little plastic controller with the

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.509 
nice little plastic controller with the
kind<00:02:58.540> of<00:02:58.830> plastic<00:02:59.830> /<00:03:00.640> chrome<00:03:01.450> interior<00:03:01.720> on<00:03:02.320> it

kind of plastic / chrome interior on it

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:06.180 
kind of plastic / chrome interior on it
you<00:03:03.519> have<00:03:03.760> your<00:03:04.030> two<00:03:04.720> USB<00:03:05.230> ports<00:03:05.260> right<00:03:05.860> on<00:03:06.040> the

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
you have your two USB ports right on the

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:07.770 
you have your two USB ports right on the
back<00:03:06.310> so<00:03:06.549> again<00:03:06.730> this<00:03:06.820> is<00:03:06.970> for<00:03:07.180> plugging<00:03:07.660> in

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
back so again this is for plugging in

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.440 
back so again this is for plugging in
additional<00:03:08.320> equipment<00:03:08.760> you<00:03:09.760> have<00:03:09.790> your<00:03:10.269> power

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
additional equipment you have your power

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:11.789 
additional equipment you have your power
plug<00:03:10.690> right<00:03:10.810> here<00:03:10.900> and<00:03:11.350> you<00:03:11.440> even<00:03:11.470> have<00:03:11.620> an

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:11.799 
plug right here and you even have an

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:13.199 
plug right here and you even have an
on/off<00:03:12.130> switch<00:03:12.370> so<00:03:12.610> this<00:03:12.760> whole<00:03:12.940> thing

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
on/off switch so this whole thing

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.240 
on/off switch so this whole thing
doesn't<00:03:13.360> have<00:03:13.660> to<00:03:13.780> be<00:03:13.900> on<00:03:14.079> the<00:03:14.320> whole<00:03:14.470> time<00:03:14.709> and

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
doesn't have to be on the whole time and

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:16.830 
doesn't have to be on the whole time and
obviously<00:03:15.519> the<00:03:15.820> other<00:03:15.940> thing<00:03:16.150> in<00:03:16.269> the<00:03:16.329> box<00:03:16.540> is

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
obviously the other thing in the box is

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.360 
obviously the other thing in the box is
the<00:03:17.709> power<00:03:18.010> cable<00:03:18.459> with<00:03:18.579> it<00:03:18.730> um<00:03:19.360> and<00:03:20.190> the<00:03:21.190> nice

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
the power cable with it um and the nice

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.370 
the power cable with it um and the nice
part<00:03:21.670> about<00:03:21.730> it<00:03:21.910> is<00:03:22.329> when<00:03:23.230> your<00:03:24.269> move<00:03:25.380> itself

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
part about it is when your move itself

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.210 
part about it is when your move itself
is<00:03:26.680> fully<00:03:27.100> charged<00:03:27.989> this<00:03:28.989> is<00:03:29.230> actually<00:03:29.709> an<00:03:29.799> LED

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
is fully charged this is actually an LED

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.720 
is fully charged this is actually an LED
light<00:03:30.549> and<00:03:30.880> it<00:03:31.360> turns<00:03:31.780> blue<00:03:32.470> inside<00:03:33.130> of<00:03:33.310> it<00:03:33.430> so

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
light and it turns blue inside of it so

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.100 
light and it turns blue inside of it so
that's<00:03:34.000> the<00:03:34.180> nice<00:03:34.329> part<00:03:34.360> about<00:03:34.660> this<00:03:34.959> little

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110 
that's the nice part about this little

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.990 
that's the nice part about this little
unit<00:03:35.500> is<00:03:35.709> it<00:03:36.190> actually<00:03:36.640> indicates<00:03:37.209> when<00:03:37.989> your

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
unit is it actually indicates when your

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.310 
unit is it actually indicates when your
move<00:03:40.000> controller<00:03:40.450> itself<00:03:40.810> is<00:03:40.989> charged<00:03:41.260> so

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320 
move controller itself is charged so

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.940 
move controller itself is charged so
that's<00:03:42.070> actually<00:03:42.250> really<00:03:42.760> really<00:03:43.060> nice<00:03:43.209> um

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
that's actually really really nice um

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.620 
that's actually really really nice um
