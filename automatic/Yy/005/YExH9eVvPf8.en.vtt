have need for strong safeties even some

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.760 
have need for strong safeties even some
free<00:02:16.810> safeties<00:02:17.170> because<00:02:17.350> I<00:02:17.440> know<00:02:17.500> there's

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
free safeties because I know there's

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.130 
free safeties because I know there's
some<00:02:17.830> free<00:02:18.100> safeties<00:02:18.490> I<00:02:18.700> know<00:02:19.690> the<00:02:19.960> majority

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
some free safeties I know the majority

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.990

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
trigger so I'm just guessing that they

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.040 
trigger so I'm just guessing that they
don't<00:02:24.160> a<00:02:24.370> lot<00:02:24.670> of<00:02:24.700> people<00:02:24.820> you<00:02:25.240> got<00:02:25.420> McCourty

that crap okay uh so Paul Worrilow is 20

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.870 
that crap okay uh so Paul Worrilow is 20
k<00:03:52.090> and<00:03:52.780> that<00:03:53.380> makes<00:03:53.590> a<00:03:53.709> 41<00:03:54.160> kid<00:03:54.340> get<00:03:54.580> an<00:03:54.670> intro

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
k and that makes a 41 kid get an intro

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:00.990 
k and that makes a 41 kid get an intro
role<00:03:55.090> he<00:03:55.390> said<00:03:55.600> 95<00:03:56.260> free<00:03:56.709> safety<00:03:59.790> so<00:04:00.790> I<00:04:00.820> don't

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
role he said 95 free safety so I don't

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.110 
role he said 95 free safety so I don't
think<00:04:01.180> it's<00:04:01.300> that<00:04:01.390> big<00:04:01.660> of<00:04:01.720> a<00:04:02.459> it's<00:04:03.459> a<00:04:03.550> new<00:04:03.790> free

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
think it's that big of a it's a new free

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.910 
think it's that big of a it's a new free
safety<00:04:04.570> I<00:04:04.600> guess<00:04:04.870> I<00:04:04.990> think<00:04:05.170> it's<00:04:05.320> free<00:04:05.590> he<00:04:05.800> may

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
safety I guess I think it's free he may

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.060 
safety I guess I think it's free he may
be<00:04:05.980> strong<00:04:06.370> we<00:04:07.330> can<00:04:07.420> look<00:04:07.540> at<00:04:07.660> that<00:04:07.720> crap<00:04:08.080> ah

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:09.070 
be strong we can look at that crap ah

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:12.540 
be strong we can look at that crap ah
but<00:04:10.260> yeah<00:04:11.260> gives<00:04:11.500> you<00:04:11.590> a<00:04:11.620> I<00:04:11.890> guess<00:04:12.190> what<00:04:12.370> I<00:04:12.400> was

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:12.550 
but yeah gives you a I guess what I was

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:14.400 
but yeah gives you a I guess what I was
just<00:04:12.670> ranting<00:04:12.970> about<00:04:13.209> the<00:04:13.570> safeties<00:04:13.989> I<00:04:14.200> guess

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
just ranting about the safeties I guess

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.280 
just ranting about the safeties I guess
it<00:04:14.590> gives<00:04:14.709> you<00:04:14.890> another<00:04:15.160> safety<00:04:15.489> but<00:04:16.290> strong

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.290 
it gives you another safety but strong

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:19.680 
it gives you another safety but strong
safety<00:04:17.709> strong<00:04:18.220> safety<00:04:18.299> might<00:04:19.299> actually<00:04:19.480> I

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
safety strong safety might actually I

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:21.210 
safety strong safety might actually I
would<00:04:20.020> actually<00:04:20.169> consider<00:04:20.470> getting<00:04:20.890> in<00:04:21.070> but

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220

they do it off of stats and whatnot but

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.100 
they do it off of stats and whatnot but
I<00:04:35.710> don't<00:04:35.860> know<00:04:35.950> they<00:04:36.100> might<00:04:36.250> make<00:04:36.460> like

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110
