long 4 channel is more challenging it

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.640 
long 4 channel is more challenging it
has<00:00:15.570> more<00:00:15.809> diverse<00:00:17.810> movements<00:00:18.810> so<00:00:19.080> it<00:00:19.410> makes

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
has more diverse movements so it makes

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.660 
has more diverse movements so it makes
it<00:00:19.890> more<00:00:20.160> fun<00:00:21.500> this<00:00:22.500> right<00:00:22.800> here<00:00:23.070> is<00:00:23.220> a<00:00:23.250> remote

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
it more fun this right here is a remote

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
you first get your helicopter we

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.310 
you first get your helicopter we
recommend<00:01:23.400> that<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:23.700> test<00:01:23.939> it<00:01:24.270> so<00:01:25.020> you<00:01:25.080> know

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
recommend that you test it so you know

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.630 
recommend that you test it so you know
that<00:01:25.530> you<00:01:25.680> got<00:01:25.830> shipped<00:01:26.189> a<00:01:26.460> good<00:01:27.500> working

that you got shipped a good working

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.039 
that you got shipped a good working
helicopter<00:01:29.640> so<00:01:30.090> first<00:01:30.299> you're<00:01:30.570> going<00:01:30.600> to<00:01:30.840> turn

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
helicopter so first you're going to turn

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.600 
helicopter so first you're going to turn
on<00:01:31.200> your<00:01:31.290> remote<00:01:31.380> control<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:32.189> then<00:01:32.340> turn<00:01:32.579> on

your first a little bit so you know that

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:46.070 
your first a little bit so you know that
the<00:01:39.479> propellers<00:01:39.960> are<00:01:40.140> moving

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.690 

so<00:01:47.080> you<00:01:47.140> test<00:01:47.470> it<00:01:47.590> out<00:01:47.710> by<00:01:48.040> moving<00:01:48.340> up<00:01:48.520> with

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
so you test it out by moving up with

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.450 
so you test it out by moving up with
time<00:01:48.910> and<00:01:49.330> on<00:01:49.690> the<00:01:49.750> other<00:01:49.990> side<00:01:50.320> your<00:01:51.190> movie

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
time and on the other side your movie

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.590 
time and on the other side your movie
and<00:01:52.030> you<00:01:52.420> will<00:01:52.630> start<00:01:53.560> to<00:01:53.650> notice<00:01:54.210> it's<00:01:55.210> a<00:01:55.330> real
