00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:06.540
 delorean journey with the car of the 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.090
 time 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.580
 the aj mentioned above we all go 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.400
 of 1993 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.350
 I admit I was there April 17th 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.180

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.850
 fame a great chick 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.680
 in addition to that you feel like going 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.029
 forward to commenting on the images 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.820
 we're talking about scavolini I'll lose 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:31.140
 Milan Millies Miss America Race 3 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:33.660
 I see the images far away in time and 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.320
 even in space, however, on that 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.879
 bench there was a current tenant 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.800
 together with the current coach of 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.370
 lakers is near him filippo faina 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.399
 long game driven by the Milan club 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:52.350
 davide pessina mai d'antoni the current 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:54.030
 conductor who did cheerleader and then 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.020
 enough things happen in the end 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.030
 unbelievable 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.430
 meanwhile marks a basket in traffic 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.399
 crazy the current referee youth work 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.979
 man then sasha george judges me you know 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.630
 schuch forge vice passes the ball alberti 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.270
 that misses free throws for the thistle 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.729
 pittis tixi riccardo pittis confuses la 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.220
 situation then rivas and alberti make a mistake 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.159
 by half a meter and the scavolini flows 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.259
 milano look at your hands in the hair of 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.869
 benches including some current ones 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:25.790
 commentators and conductors celebrate in 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:29.070
 work man and this game dear david is 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.570
 fundamental because without all those 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.670
 george bush situations that pass it 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.409
 alberti pittis who does not understand time 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.000
 work but that makes a miraculous basket 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.600
 Alberti arrives who make mistakes from the middle 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.979
 meter 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.600
 to not count all the rest of the 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.119
 season injuries 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.350
 at 90 percent with the team that 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.299
 would have gone 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.670
 in the current euroleague mike d'antoni 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.320
 he would have remained in Milan more than not 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.299
 we would have gone to treviso we said 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.869
 before treviso was a crossroads 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:57.719
 for flaps and in substance I am convinced 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:00.030
 to 110 percent who today mike d'antoni 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.549
 you wouldn't see Manhattan Beach 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.280
 beach in front of the house but the atmosphere like 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.740
 how to say a bit of rainy winter 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.729
 of today's milan then david if there 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.390
 he played a little more 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:14.810
 probably sinopoli 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:18.060
 regenerating selected lillo at least yes 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.599
 they must show a good one once 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.180
 I remember 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:24.360
 miley you win your relationship in many 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.220
 regions but what game would have been enough for me 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.989
 the relationship with antonio already and is called 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.060
 here for the outer rod did me 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:33.120
 rightly notice davide pitis 5 out of 14 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.519
 from 3 comes one on three is yellow thing not 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.950
 go you are in race 2 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:41.130
 the key is true in race2 big game 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.860
 by paolo alberti the reason why paolo 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.840
 was in the field in that final obviously i 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.060
 free throws were not like saying yet 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.220
 his specialty was the first steps a 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.900
 that really great experience level 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.590
 I always remember everything 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.480
 this is talked about twenty years ago anyway 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.010
 big fans and it's amazing how it goes 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.510
 time because hand work today is a 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.580
 referee nba davide pessina ago 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.760
 commentator and mike d'antoni is no longer 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:07.290
 at the forum but it's no longer the forum in los 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.209
 angeles is the staple center 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.209
 they spend a little for all the years
