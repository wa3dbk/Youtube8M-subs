 peter congratulations what did you think of the 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.160
 match today 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.720
 well i found a moderate game of 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.259
 our side rash might do differently 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.570
 suspect 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.090
 this both very justified result because me 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.340
 think we also have four five six whole 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.460
 even big chances outside the penalty 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.260
 have left but still felt 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.520
 not that we had a full grip and 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.510
 we also let it come back in the 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.890
 contest 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.810

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.760
 on which you as a trainer rested on a couch

 was the mc i don't know exactly what anymore 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.570
 it was patience we were without two one 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.850
 exams are back to 2 just before time 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.930
 2 we do that scenario for a bit 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.340
 your head 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.869
 Well you often have the time in front of you 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.070
 to watch the current match and 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.390
 you then see what you can do there 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.009
 and i had to say with the band that we 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.060
 have it my kidneys though 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.799
 quite a few with impossibilities 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.610
 gives and 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.439
 and the also have the best of it 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.850
 benefited because I found all three 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.020
 the boys how slow and how short they are 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.030
 maybe it also played great 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.280
 have done with cries score flash 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.290
 just their baby was warm deep and I know 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.240
 how do the stairs have name if you 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.700
 smartphone it's so the defender and him 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.220
 so to the of the may people had 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.619
 Flick your hair again but have it after abeba 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.869
 plein was a sort of cake from a crash 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.970
 course of this song 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.070
 across various camp from my hey people 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.229
 yes they lose 6.6 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.310
 finally you score your goal the burden 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.950
 couple or with your shit 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.079
 view Harris with silent and ran the idea 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.649
 finally found century was in the right 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.670
 position and was the risk livelink mine 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.250
 thank you you have this 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.130
 driving school helps the team to to 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.710
 to grab this repins eyes this beautiful 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.539
 impotent for this moment and first half 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.730
 the dead had already scored second half as long 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.600
 Choosing the striker scoring that needs you 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.340
 also do well 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.900
 yes it makes where I normally do not 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.310
 a lot from who scores but for it 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.630
 peak hour then I do important and 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.980
 if both boys have scored it is 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.540
 is that perfect 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.790
 we start today with after it already on 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.720
 the left side burned and therefore remained 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.970
 on the couch 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.790
 Why was the answer almost 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.080
 given the first minute I think the lights 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.420
 always against the soccer team 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.250
 space behind the defense and is that 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.780
 is after all more a combination player and after 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.400
 then the fast boy who is in the 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.820
