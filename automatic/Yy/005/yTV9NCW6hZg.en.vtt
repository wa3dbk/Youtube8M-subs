00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.000
 related to league of 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:50.369
 legends can be sad happy 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.309
 fun to be faithful to the name of the game or 

00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:55.890
 no I do not care all I ask is that 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.750

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.770
 LOL 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:19.810
 now conditions good I'm not much of 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.610
 impose anything for these things but I think 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.530
 that at least one is necessary for 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.969
 this goes well you will have to follow me in 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.009
 my twitter account if you want 

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:28.569
 participate basically to be 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:31.240
 informed about how the 

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:33.250
 contest deadlines and why I would like 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.319
 to write me a tweet when I 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.090
 send is a story so I can 

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:39.459
 check at the moment and I confirm that 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.140
 I have something else that you can do and 

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:42.909
 that will help to make the contest better 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.829
 is to retweet the message that I have 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:46.880
 published in my profile and that I put you 

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:49.759
 down in the description 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.070
 and well I explain to you once the 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:54.890
 June 30 will close the deadline for 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.960
 delivery and I will choose five stories that 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.009
 I considered better for its originality 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.250
 and quality 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:03.110
 then to take these five stories and 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:06.049
 I will upload them to the channel individually 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.539
 so you do not know the style of these 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:11.090
 stories to be reported will be similar 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:13.550
 to this one here you can click here to 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.650
 right and so you have an idea for 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.420
 both once they are uploaded you can 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.150
 see them and value them through the 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.890
 comments if I like however this 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.769
 It will not be definitive to choose the 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.810
 winner because because anyone 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:29.269
 You can share your story on Facebook 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.160
 by groups of thousands of people and 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:33.530
 plead like or just be done 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.390
 bot accounts for auto vote is for 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.970
 avoid this my criteria will also have 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.840
 an important weight in all this 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.870
 obviously the votes and comments 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.900
 yours too but it will not be definitive 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.430
 and finally the awards the story 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.950
 who is the winner of this contest 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.590
 you can choose the skin you want from the 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.940

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.280
