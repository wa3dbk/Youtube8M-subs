is a third move parkour stuff what you
want<00:02:52.460> to<00:02:52.580> do<00:02:52.700> it's<00:02:53.660> basically<00:02:54.080> like<00:02:54.950> kind<00:02:55.550> of

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
want to do it's basically like kind of

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.260 
want to do it's basically like kind of
like<00:02:55.850> a<00:02:56.060> backflip<00:02:56.900> on<00:02:57.110> the<00:02:57.260> ground<00:02:57.590> and<00:02:58.270> it's

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
like a backflip on the ground and it's

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.180 
like a backflip on the ground and it's
not<00:02:59.450> that<00:02:59.690> hard<00:02:59.960> these<00:03:00.350> are<00:03:00.590> all<00:03:00.740> going<00:03:00.950> to<00:03:01.010> be

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
not that hard these are all going to be

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.510 
not that hard these are all going to be
easy<00:03:01.820> but<00:03:02.210> I<00:03:02.270> think<00:03:02.390> the<00:03:02.720> roundoff<00:03:03.260> might<00:03:04.220> take

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:04.520 
easy but I think the roundoff might take

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.550 
easy but I think the roundoff might take
a<00:03:04.550> little<00:03:04.820> bit<00:03:04.970> of<00:03:05.120> practice<00:03:06.040> okay<00:03:07.040> so<00:03:07.850> first

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
a little bit of practice okay so first

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.340 
a little bit of practice okay so first
what<00:03:09.560> you<00:03:09.590> want<00:03:09.890> to<00:03:10.010> do<00:03:10.160> put<00:03:10.630> your<00:03:11.630> legs<00:03:11.960> like
