00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:05.009
 Good night people are great again I 'm going 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.099
 show you 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:12.450
 the difference that makes use of an engine and 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:16.049
 more than using a sensor and using them 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.370
 components without sensor sir are here 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:23.420
 You, to you. 

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:27.300
 This little car here is connected here. 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:30.449
 a connection here in the engine can see who 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.009
 we can not stand our healing and the other 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.950
 Connection will not work 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:40.050
 probably with my camera is very bad 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:41.399
 It's not here that you can see it. 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.460
 is not online 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:47.309
 I'll call you guys, think they will. 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.590
 can see how much code it has 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.750
 and that occurs by the shaking when 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.290
 begins to walk with him how much he has 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.760
 without the sensor connected in 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:03.469
 time it connected 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:03.469
 Look, just a little celebration. 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:11.130
 after I go through this phase only 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.340
 after you pass this stage with a car 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:17.310
 Conventional can even try to do is 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.830
 right here knowing that the pole fell 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.729
 I know the code will be strong and I will 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.250
 try to show a little on the floor to 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:30.740
 this light picture 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.740
 but just look and walk with the sensor 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:38.500
 even after it gets to it goes 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.390
 to win is the same thing a little 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.760
 code 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:48.520
 then you can pick up more speed and go 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:51.010
 normal I will now show you 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:55.210
 how does he stay 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:58.960
 When I connect this sensor it can be 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:02.020
 guilty fell the cloth that was here when 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.500
 same pleasure you want to connect here with 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:11.880
 the always difficult hand 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:11.880
 it guys laws is very difficult 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.310
 but he did not give up 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.950
 bread his mother 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:31.870
 I'll have to appeal to that old man. 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:33.519
 trick of downloading kan does not even look at the 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.569
 big difference the crowd is now 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:40.080
 connected there is a simple touch to 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.080
 zoom out 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:47.680
 Look here very slowly and neither 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:49.980
 I even got it up there, she looks 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.980
 delicious 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:03:01.569
 put up here holding with radio 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:05.019
 be real the province is moving 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:07.730
 only that he did not tremble that none 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:11.439
 has everything including pushing here the 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:16.629
 radio cope pushing the question further 

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:19.549
 it 's not making any noise again 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:21.340
 Look, I'll show you on the floor too. 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:24.409
 this difference 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.400
 It's unbelievable, people who have this 

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:33.620
 option does 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:35.319
 Look who slow down can walk without 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:40.060
 electricity 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:40.060
 look now 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:51.370
 Look how fantastic I now understand. 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:56.680
 because crawler always uses one is that 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:58.780
 with sensor instead of a 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:02.560
 It means that as the sensor and motor 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:05.520
 also with sensor the only options to 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:09.190
 cacao is brasiliense with sensor by then 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:12.670
 a 11 is that engine gap 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:15.490
 here who has this option I recommend 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:21.250
 I was amazed to see you at school soon 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:22.830
 again i will push that the radio went well 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:25.720
 slowly 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:30.090
 yes he make no complaint 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.090
 now let's try this without the connection 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:42.040
 I connected she looks only after a certain 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.510
 force here has a certain pressure 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:47.650
 negative 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:48.910
 he will start walking the trepidation is 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.370
 very strong 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:54.130
 good, this is a very difficult video of 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:57.820
 see and understand then research and 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:05:00.070
 understand better why it is a motor 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.990
 with sensor and I'll try to make a 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:05.860
 outdoor video to better understand 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:07.419
 this function did not connect my sakura to 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:14.310
 new disease is already studying here is a 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:14.310
 mess you win
