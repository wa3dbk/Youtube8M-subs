00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.500
 i 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.840
 I from classmates you share 

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:12.120
 this tweet called eric and this has a 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.860
 price of a dollar with 49 cents and with 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.300
 this tweet we are going to be able to have 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.490
 the camera to our dictation when 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.590
 let's be writing if that's the way it is 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.090
 they will stumble or anything no longer 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.410
 they will be in danger because when they go 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.960
 writing they will see that they have 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.610
 opposite very well or also this tri that 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.110
 It is very good to give it a good appearance 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.119
 of this key do below we're going 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.070
 to see what we installed restart ball 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.660
 fast and we will create some adjustments 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.610
 but before going to the settings menu we're going to 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.530
 see the keyboard for example mind can 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.180
 see me here I have my rear camera and 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.920
 well there it is and there is the 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.230
 screen where I'm recording can see 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.570
 background and then yes I can write 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.630
 I can activate this keyboard 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.310
 keeping in the space key as 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.690
 you can see I already take it off and I want 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:55.350
 activate I keep the triple again 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.120
 space and without active also this one has 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.310
 an option for us to leave 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.840
 pressed the letter f of the keyboard we 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:04.480

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.960
 leave it pressed ok then this is 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.670

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.130
