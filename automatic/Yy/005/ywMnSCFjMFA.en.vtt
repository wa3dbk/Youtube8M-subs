00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:19.369 
we're looking straight down the tree and

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:22.550 
we're looking straight down the tree and
you're<00:00:20.369> standing<00:00:20.939> you're<00:00:21.510> standing<00:00:22.050> say<00:00:22.289> here

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
you're standing you're standing say here

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.790 
you're standing you're standing say here
cutting<00:00:23.689> you're<00:00:24.689> planning<00:00:25.170> on<00:00:25.259> having<00:00:25.529> it

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
cutting you're planning on having it

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.710 
cutting you're planning on having it
fall<00:00:26.070> say<00:00:26.429> this<00:00:26.670> direction<00:00:27.060> you've<00:00:27.449> got<00:00:27.630> to

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
fall say this direction you've got to

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.079 
fall say this direction you've got to
look<00:00:27.840> up<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.170> tree<00:00:28.410> make<00:00:28.710> darn<00:00:28.980> sure<00:00:29.099> it's<00:00:29.880> not

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:30.089 
look up the tree make darn sure it's not

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:32.300 
look up the tree make darn sure it's not
going<00:00:30.390> some<00:00:30.869> other<00:00:31.050> direction<00:00:31.289> in<00:00:31.679> particular

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:32.310 
going some other direction in particular

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.820 
going some other direction in particular
towards<00:00:33.150> you<00:00:33.330> now<00:00:34.020> obviously<00:00:34.140> if<00:00:34.470> the<00:00:34.620> tree

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:34.830 
towards you now obviously if the tree

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:36.500 
towards you now obviously if the tree
starts<00:00:35.160> falling<00:00:35.610> there's<00:00:35.790> no<00:00:35.970> way<00:00:36.180> in<00:00:36.240> heck

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
starts falling there's no way in heck

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.720 
starts falling there's no way in heck
you<00:00:37.110> can<00:00:37.320> push<00:00:37.530> on<00:00:37.710> that<00:00:37.890> tree<00:00:38.130> and<00:00:38.160> stop<00:00:38.460> it

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
you can push on that tree and stop it

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.760 
you can push on that tree and stop it
it's<00:00:38.970> comin<00:00:39.450> whatever<00:00:39.780> direction<00:00:40.020> wants<00:00:40.620> to

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
it's comin whatever direction wants to

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.970 
it's comin whatever direction wants to
go<00:00:41.040> so<00:00:41.790> that's<00:00:42.000> why<00:00:42.210> we<00:00:42.600> like<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.410> loop<00:00:43.590> on<00:00:43.800> it

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
go so that's why we like the loop on it

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.220 
go so that's why we like the loop on it
with<00:00:44.790> the<00:00:44.880> rope<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.360> you<00:00:45.750> can<00:00:45.900> pull<00:00:46.140> up<00:00:46.260> that

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
with the rope and you can pull up that

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.100 
with the rope and you can pull up that
that's<00:00:49.230> that's<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:50.250> theory<00:00:50.730> of<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.360> notching

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
that's that's the theory of the notching

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.710 
that's that's the theory of the notching
so<00:00:52.710> in<00:00:52.890> this<00:00:53.010> case<00:00:53.250> if<00:00:53.940> we're<00:00:54.180> going<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.510> fall

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:54.720 
so in this case if we're going to fall

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.330 
so in this case if we're going to fall
this<00:00:54.930> way<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.380> notch<00:00:55.590> would<00:00:55.890> have<00:00:56.010> been<00:00:56.160> in

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
this way the notch would have been in

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.340 
this way the notch would have been in
this<00:00:56.850> side<00:00:57.090> of<00:00:57.150> the<00:00:57.240> tree<00:00:57.480> right<00:00:57.510> here<00:00:57.780> and

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
this side of the tree right here and

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.080 
this side of the tree right here and
then<00:00:58.920> we<00:00:59.010> do<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.190> thumb<00:00:59.670> cut<00:01:00.060> through<00:01:00.360> here<00:01:02.090> if

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
then we do the thumb cut through here if

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.570 
then we do the thumb cut through here if
we're<00:01:03.360> using<00:01:03.510> if<00:01:04.409> we're<00:01:04.650> using<00:01:04.890> a

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
we're using if we're using a

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.910 
we're using if we're using a
wedge<00:01:05.790> let's<00:01:06.600> take<00:01:06.810> a<00:01:06.869> bigger<00:01:07.140> tree<00:01:09.619> it's<00:01:10.619> if

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
wedge let's take a bigger tree it's if

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.279 
wedge let's take a bigger tree it's if
we<00:01:11.070> have<00:01:11.159> a<00:01:11.219> bigger<00:01:11.460> tree<00:01:11.729> over<00:01:12.000> here<00:01:12.179> we<00:01:13.079> have

00:01:13.279 --> 00:01:13.289 
we have a bigger tree over here we have

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:17.029 
we have a bigger tree over here we have
we<00:01:13.590> have<00:01:13.740> it<00:01:13.920> notched<00:01:15.259> here<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.530> we're

00:01:17.029 --> 00:01:17.039 
we have it notched here and we're

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:20.209 
we have it notched here and we're
cutting<00:01:17.429> through<00:01:17.810> so<00:01:18.810> it's<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:19.140> large<00:01:19.679> tree<00:01:20.100> we

00:01:20.209 --> 00:01:20.219 
cutting through so it's a large tree we

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:23.450 
cutting through so it's a large tree we
got<00:01:20.369> our<00:01:20.460> chainsaw<00:01:20.999> blade<00:01:21.990> right<00:01:22.229> here<00:01:22.499> we're

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
got our chainsaw blade right here we're

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.109 
got our chainsaw blade right here we're
heading<00:01:23.729> through<00:01:24.060> on<00:01:24.350> this<00:01:25.350> side<00:01:25.710> we<00:01:26.159> put<00:01:26.939> a

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
heading through on this side we put a

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.730 
heading through on this side we put a
felling<00:01:28.109> wedge<00:01:28.399> and<00:01:30.020> that<00:01:31.020> could<00:01:31.170> be<00:01:31.200> pounded

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
felling wedge and that could be pounded

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.800 
felling wedge and that could be pounded
in<00:01:31.859> with<00:01:32.069> a<00:01:32.100> hammer<00:01:34.850> and<00:01:35.850> we<00:01:36.030> cut<00:01:36.270> through<00:01:36.420> most

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
in with a hammer and we cut through most

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.139 
in with a hammer and we cut through most
of<00:01:36.929> the<00:01:36.990> way<00:01:37.170> you<00:01:37.229> can<00:01:37.619> stop<00:01:37.770> cutting<00:01:38.429> and<00:01:38.609> then

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:39.149 
of the way you can stop cutting and then

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:42.590 
of the way you can stop cutting and then
tap<00:01:39.450> in<00:01:39.749> the<00:01:39.960> wedge<00:01:40.799> if<00:01:41.149> you've<00:01:42.149> got<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.569> eat

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
tap in the wedge if you've got to eat

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.139 
tap in the wedge if you've got to eat
them<00:01:42.869> so<00:01:43.049> it's<00:01:43.200> fairly<00:01:43.409> close<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:44.219> wedge<00:01:44.429> and

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
them so it's fairly close the wedge and

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.999 
them so it's fairly close the wedge and
make<00:01:45.329> it<00:01:45.479> start<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:45.929> fall<00:01:46.170> you<00:01:46.380> may<00:01:46.560> have<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:46.889> go

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
make it start to fall you may have to go

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.550 
make it start to fall you may have to go
back<00:01:47.249> in<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:47.909> cut<00:01:48.600> over<00:01:49.049> further<00:01:49.259> with

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
back in and and cut over further with

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.129 
back in and and cut over further with
your<00:01:49.679> chainsaw<00:01:50.810> but<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:53.569> the<00:01:54.569> wedge<00:01:54.780> can<00:01:55.020> be

00:01:55.129 --> 00:01:55.139 
your chainsaw but the the wedge can be

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:56.569 
your chainsaw but the the wedge can be
in<00:01:55.229> there<00:01:55.380> it's<00:01:55.469> a<00:01:55.530> plastic<00:01:56.009> Rachel<00:01:56.399> if<00:01:56.490> you

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
in there it's a plastic Rachel if you

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.580 
in there it's a plastic Rachel if you
accidentally<00:01:57.119> touch<00:01:57.689> it<00:01:57.929> with<00:01:58.139> the<00:01:58.289> chainsaw

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
accidentally touch it with the chainsaw

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.739 
accidentally touch it with the chainsaw
it's<00:01:59.039> not<00:01:59.189> going<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.429> damage<00:01:59.609> the<00:01:59.880> chainsaw<00:02:00.450> or

00:02:00.739 --> 00:02:00.749 
it's not going to damage the chainsaw or

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:02.959 
it's not going to damage the chainsaw or
if<00:02:01.409> it<00:02:01.499> flies<00:02:01.740> all<00:02:02.039> it's<00:02:02.310> not<00:02:02.490> as<00:02:02.579> likely<00:02:02.819> to

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
if it flies all it's not as likely to

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.649 
if it flies all it's not as likely to
hurt<00:02:03.240> you<00:02:03.450> so<00:02:04.109> you<00:02:04.499> cut<00:02:04.979> through<00:02:05.189> it<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:05.659> then

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
hurt you so you cut through it and then
