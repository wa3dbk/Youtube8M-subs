00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.420 

and<00:00:47.850> then<00:00:48.060> next<00:00:48.480> stage<00:00:48.750> we<00:00:48.930> can<00:00:49.080> just<00:00:49.260> quickly

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:49.430 
and then next stage we can just quickly

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.729 
and then next stage we can just quickly
clean<00:00:50.430> off<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.760> other<00:00:50.940> side<00:00:51.120> of<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.330> hand<00:00:51.739> and

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
clean off the other side of the hand and

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.229 
clean off the other side of the hand and
to<00:00:52.890> do<00:00:53.040> this<00:00:53.220> we<00:00:53.430> just<00:00:53.640> go<00:00:53.790> in<00:00:53.880> a<00:00:53.970> circular

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
to do this we just go in a circular

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:11.320 
to do this we just go in a circular
motion<00:00:58.250> and<00:00:59.250> just<00:00:59.430> remove<00:00:59.760> the<00:01:00.230> excess<00:01:01.910> oxide

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.490 

so<00:01:12.330> that<00:01:12.510> now<00:01:12.660> looks<00:01:12.900> a<00:01:12.990> little<00:01:13.050> bit<00:01:13.320> more

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
so that now looks a little bit more

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.930 
so that now looks a little bit more
presentable<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:16.160> so<00:01:17.160> the<00:01:17.250> next<00:01:17.430> stage<00:01:17.670> really

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:17.940 
presentable and so the next stage really

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.200 
presentable and so the next stage really
is<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.720> start<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.410> clean<00:01:19.619> up<00:01:19.800> the<00:01:20.210> scalloped

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
is to start to clean up the scalloped

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.060 
is to start to clean up the scalloped
tips<00:01:21.780> here<00:01:22.410> and<00:01:22.729> to<00:01:23.729> do<00:01:23.850> this<00:01:24.030> we<00:01:24.530> mount<00:01:25.530> just

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
tips here and to do this we mount just

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.040 
tips here and to do this we mount just
rest<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.960> hand<00:01:27.960> on<00:01:28.380> a<00:01:28.880> block<00:01:29.880> hold<00:01:30.780> it<00:01:30.930> with

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.050 
rest the hand on a block hold it with

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.609 
rest the hand on a block hold it with
the<00:01:31.140> middle<00:01:31.320> or<00:01:32.190> second<00:01:32.670> finger<00:01:32.910> and<00:01:33.619> then

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
the middle or second finger and then

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.740 
the middle or second finger and then
steady<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.280> tip<00:01:35.550> with<00:01:36.000> your<00:01:36.210> other<00:01:36.330> finger

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
steady the tip with your other finger

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.380 
steady the tip with your other finger
and<00:01:37.590> what<00:01:37.770> we<00:01:37.890> use<00:01:38.070> to<00:01:38.280> start<00:01:38.550> with<00:01:38.759> is<00:01:38.910> just<00:01:39.090> a

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
and what we use to start with is just a

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.310 
and what we use to start with is just a
round<00:01:39.720> broach<00:01:40.910> smoothing<00:01:41.910> broach<00:01:42.140> and<00:01:43.140> what

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
round broach smoothing broach and what

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.969 
round broach smoothing broach and what
we<00:01:43.440> do<00:01:43.619> is<00:01:43.710> just<00:01:43.740> lie<00:01:44.130> it<00:01:44.190> in<00:01:44.580> the<00:01:45.000> groove<00:01:45.240> and

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
we do is just lie it in the groove and

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:51.469 
we do is just lie it in the groove and
just<00:01:46.979> draw<00:01:47.970> it<00:01:48.210> back<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:48.930> forth<00:01:50.299> and<00:01:51.299> this

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
just draw it back and forth and this

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.920 
just draw it back and forth and this
just<00:01:51.720> helps<00:01:52.229> to<00:01:52.820> compress<00:01:53.820> it<00:01:54.150> all<00:01:54.420> if<00:01:54.780> you

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
just helps to compress it all if you

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.219 
just helps to compress it all if you
like<00:01:55.080> burnish<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.770> surface<00:01:55.799> and<00:01:57.110> just<00:01:58.110> to

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
like burnish the surface and just to

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.670 
like burnish the surface and just to
remove<00:01:58.470> any<00:01:59.090> marks<00:02:00.090> from<00:02:00.450> all<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.229> previous

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
remove any marks from all the previous

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:08.139 
remove any marks from all the previous
processes<00:02:05.000> so<00:02:06.000> one<00:02:06.360> thing<00:02:06.570> you<00:02:06.750> must<00:02:07.020> do

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
processes so one thing you must do

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.840 
processes so one thing you must do
particularly<00:02:09.709> on<00:02:10.709> hand<00:02:10.979> like<00:02:11.190> this<00:02:11.430> is<00:02:11.670> you've

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
particularly on hand like this is you've

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.280 
particularly on hand like this is you've
got<00:02:12.000> to<00:02:12.150> make<00:02:12.299> sure<00:02:12.450> that<00:02:12.600> all<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:12.870> movements

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
got to make sure that all the movements

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.350 
got to make sure that all the movements
are<00:02:13.410> perfectly<00:02:13.739> straight<00:02:14.120> and<00:02:15.120> that<00:02:15.269> you

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
are perfectly straight and that you

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.080 
are perfectly straight and that you
don't<00:02:15.630> at<00:02:15.930> any<00:02:16.110> time<00:02:16.380> catch<00:02:16.769> this<00:02:17.310> section<00:02:17.880> of

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
don't at any time catch this section of

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.720 
don't at any time catch this section of
the<00:02:18.209> hand<00:02:18.590> because<00:02:19.590> then<00:02:19.860> you'll<00:02:20.430> start

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
the hand because then you'll start

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:28.319 
the hand because then you'll start
looking<00:02:20.940> silently

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:28.329 

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:30.670 

okay<00:02:29.329> now<00:02:29.480> it's<00:02:29.599> starting<00:02:29.689> to<00:02:30.019> look<00:02:30.140> good<00:02:30.470> and

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
okay now it's starting to look good and

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.610 
okay now it's starting to look good and
I<00:02:30.950> think<00:02:31.159> it<00:02:31.280> will<00:02:31.400> now<00:02:31.610> start<00:02:31.939> to<00:02:32.030> take<00:02:32.239> a

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
I think it will now start to take a

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.030 
I think it will now start to take a
Polish<00:02:34.090> so<00:02:35.090> the<00:02:35.180> hunt<00:02:35.390> is<00:02:35.629> now<00:02:35.840> ready<00:02:36.140> to<00:02:36.379> apply

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
Polish so the hunt is now ready to apply

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.880 
Polish so the hunt is now ready to apply
the<00:02:37.220> pause<00:02:37.549> to<00:02:37.849> these<00:02:38.030> tips<00:02:38.360> and<00:02:38.659> it's<00:02:39.560> a

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
the pause to these tips and it's a

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.420 
the pause to these tips and it's a
concave<00:02:40.489> surface<00:02:41.560> two<00:02:42.560> curves<00:02:42.860> which<00:02:43.159> meet

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
concave surface two curves which meet

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.179 
concave surface two curves which meet
here<00:02:43.849> in<00:02:44.060> the<00:02:44.150> middle<00:02:44.450> and<00:02:44.650> so<00:02:45.650> what<00:02:45.980> we<00:02:46.069> have

00:02:46.179 --> 00:02:46.189 
here in the middle and so what we have

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:49.119 
here in the middle and so what we have
to<00:02:46.340> do<00:02:46.549> is<00:02:46.849> to<00:02:47.569> file<00:02:48.170> a<00:02:48.200> piece<00:02:48.530> of<00:02:48.709> wood<00:02:48.859> in

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:49.129 
to do is to file a piece of wood in

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:53.770 
to do is to file a piece of wood in
order<00:02:50.120> to<00:02:50.299> follow<00:02:50.569> that<00:02:51.379> contour<00:02:52.540> so<00:02:53.540> take<00:02:53.750> a

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
order to follow that contour so take a

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.720 
order to follow that contour so take a
piece<00:02:54.019> of<00:02:54.049> peg<00:02:54.349> wood<00:02:54.560> and<00:02:54.769> it's<00:02:55.220> just<00:02:55.489> a<00:02:55.579> very

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
piece of peg wood and it's just a very

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.750 
piece of peg wood and it's just a very
coarse<00:02:56.030> file<00:02:56.739> while<00:02:57.739> constantly<00:02:58.310> spinning

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
coarse file while constantly spinning

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.619 
coarse file while constantly spinning
the<00:02:58.849> wood<00:02:58.970> in<00:02:59.120> your<00:02:59.150> hand<00:03:00.489> you<00:03:01.489> can<00:03:01.519> just<00:03:01.940> file

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:02.629 
the wood in your hand you can just file

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:06.910 
the wood in your hand you can just file
a<00:03:03.099> taper<00:03:04.099> nice<00:03:04.639> round<00:03:04.940> taper<00:03:05.560> with<00:03:06.560> into<00:03:06.829> the

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
a taper nice round taper with into the

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:14.410 
a taper nice round taper with into the
wood<00:03:11.859> okay<00:03:12.859> so<00:03:12.920> I<00:03:13.129> think<00:03:13.310> now<00:03:13.639> we<00:03:13.700> are<00:03:14.000> ready<00:03:14.209> to

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
wood okay so I think now we are ready to

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:57.390 
wood okay so I think now we are ready to
do<00:03:14.569> some<00:03:14.900> polishing

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.530 

and<00:03:57.909> there<00:03:58.090> we<00:03:58.209> are<00:03:58.239> now<00:03:58.690> we<00:03:58.750> are<00:03:58.959> starting<00:03:59.440> to

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
and there we are now we are starting to

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:07.199 
and there we are now we are starting to
get<00:04:02.879> very<00:04:03.879> nice<00:04:04.090> polished<00:04:05.730> concave<00:04:06.730> surface

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
get very nice polished concave surface

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:09.390 
get very nice polished concave surface
there<00:04:07.480> and<00:04:08.080> if<00:04:08.349> you<00:04:08.530> note<00:04:08.739> we're<00:04:09.159> still

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
there and if you note we're still

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.550 
there and if you note we're still
maintaining<00:04:09.849> the<00:04:10.150> sharpness<00:04:10.480> of<00:04:10.659> this<00:04:11.290> peak

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
maintaining the sharpness of this peak

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.819 
maintaining the sharpness of this peak
and<00:04:12.060> also<00:04:13.060> the<00:04:13.239> sharpness<00:04:13.989> of<00:04:14.200> the<00:04:14.260> edge<00:04:14.379> here

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:14.829 
and also the sharpness of the edge here

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:17.340 
and also the sharpness of the edge here
so<00:04:15.730> that's<00:04:15.849> looking<00:04:16.000> good<00:04:16.329> and<00:04:16.510> we'll<00:04:17.139> leave

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350 
so that's looking good and we'll leave

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:18.659 
so that's looking good and we'll leave
up<00:04:17.560> for<00:04:17.739> the<00:04:17.799> moment<00:04:18.160> and<00:04:18.310> now<00:04:18.489> we'll

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:18.669 
up for the moment and now we'll

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:21.870 
up for the moment and now we'll
concentrate<00:04:19.030> on<00:04:19.600> the<00:04:20.410> other<00:04:20.949> side<00:04:21.250> of<00:04:21.729> the

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
concentrate on the other side of the

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.719 
concentrate on the other side of the
scalloped<00:04:22.240> tip<00:04:22.979> so<00:04:23.979> now<00:04:24.100> we<00:04:24.160> have<00:04:24.340> to<00:04:24.490> push

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:24.729 
scalloped tip so now we have to push

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:29.159 
scalloped tip so now we have to push
this<00:04:25.270> side<00:04:25.510> of<00:04:25.690> the<00:04:25.750> hand<00:04:25.960> and<00:04:27.630> so<00:04:28.630> again<00:04:28.960> we

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:29.169 
this side of the hand and so again we

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:33.920 
this side of the hand and so again we
just<00:04:29.380> take<00:04:30.010> it<00:04:30.039> like<00:04:30.220> this<00:04:32.220> with<00:04:33.220> a<00:04:33.250> burnish<00:04:33.669> up

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
just take it like this with a burnish up

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:41.810 
just take it like this with a burnish up
and<00:04:34.930> just<00:04:35.080> start<00:04:35.320> to<00:04:35.440> draw<00:04:35.710> down<00:04:35.949> its<00:04:36.190> length

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.540 

again<00:04:42.820> making<00:04:43.120> sure<00:04:44.100> you'll<00:04:45.100> keep<00:04:45.310> it

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
again making sure you'll keep it

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:51.120 
again making sure you'll keep it
absolutely<00:04:46.210> perfectly<00:04:46.660> straight<00:04:50.130> may

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130 
absolutely perfectly straight may

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:52.710 
absolutely perfectly straight may
sometimes<00:04:51.580> be<00:04:51.760> easy<00:04:51.940> when<00:04:52.150> you<00:04:52.210> work<00:04:52.419> on<00:04:52.600> that

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
sometimes be easy when you work on that

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:53.909 
sometimes be easy when you work on that
side<00:04:52.960> of<00:04:53.050> the<00:04:53.110> hunters<00:04:53.470> to<00:04:53.500> reverse<00:04:53.889> a

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:53.919 
side of the hunters to reverse a

00:04:53.919 --> 00:05:00.779 
side of the hunters to reverse a
direction<00:04:56.910> all<00:04:57.910> down<00:04:58.120> there<00:04:58.360> with<00:04:58.539> a<00:04:58.570> nail<00:04:59.789> and

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:00.789 
direction all down there with a nail and

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:02.909 
direction all down there with a nail and
then<00:05:01.180> is<00:05:01.360> to<00:05:01.510> work<00:05:01.690> from<00:05:01.930> this<00:05:02.110> direction<00:05:02.349> and

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:02.919 
then is to work from this direction and

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:05.719 
then is to work from this direction and
it<00:05:03.010> means<00:05:03.220> you<00:05:03.430> can<00:05:03.580> get<00:05:03.729> longer<00:05:04.590> straighter

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:05.729 
it means you can get longer straighter

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:10.889 
it means you can get longer straighter
sweep<00:05:07.410> with<00:05:08.410> the<00:05:08.440> burnish
