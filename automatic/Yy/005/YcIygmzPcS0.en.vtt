is<00:01:42.890> a<00:01:42.950> point<00:01:43.100> I<00:01:43.250> always<00:01:43.399> bring<00:01:43.640> up<00:01:43.789> in<00:01:43.940> cars

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
is a point I always bring up in cars

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.480 
is a point I always bring up in cars
because<00:01:44.509> the<00:01:44.600> most<00:01:44.810> cars<00:01:45.080> they're<00:01:45.770> too<00:01:45.979> low

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
because the most cars they're too low

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.600 
because the most cars they're too low
these<00:01:47.030> are<00:01:47.450> right<00:01:48.350> up<00:01:48.530> high<00:01:48.740> and<00:01:49.130> that's<00:01:49.340> great

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
these are right up high and that's great

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.160 
these are right up high and that's great
because<00:01:49.759> it<00:01:49.970> all<00:01:50.090> it<00:01:50.210> means<00:01:50.330> is<00:01:50.600> look<00:01:50.899> at<00:01:51.050> them

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
because it all it means is look at them

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.870 
because it all it means is look at them
you<00:01:51.409> just<00:01:51.590> got<00:01:51.710> to<00:01:51.800> look<00:01:51.920> left<00:01:52.130> and<00:01:52.280> look<00:01:52.369> right

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
you just got to look left and look right

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.550 
you just got to look left and look right
don't<00:01:53.450> have<00:01:53.569> to<00:01:53.659> rearrange<00:01:53.899> your<00:01:54.229> head<00:01:54.409> or

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.300 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.770 

now<00:01:59.300> this<00:01:59.720> car<00:02:00.080> pulls<00:02:00.800> quite<00:02:01.250> nicely<00:02:01.550> but<00:02:02.420> it

the<00:02:56.660> vehicle<00:02:57.230> is<00:02:58.360> me<00:02:59.360> it's<00:02:59.990> quite<00:03:00.140> low<00:03:00.440> that

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
the vehicle is me it's quite low that

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.910 
the vehicle is me it's quite low that
there's<00:03:00.980> not<00:03:01.070> a<00:03:01.130> lot<00:03:01.280> going<00:03:01.310> on<00:03:01.700> here<00:03:01.760> but<00:03:02.920> I

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
there's not a lot going on here but I

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.550 
there's not a lot going on here but I
think<00:03:03.980> Skoda<00:03:04.880> now<00:03:05.300> have<00:03:05.660> come<00:03:05.900> up<00:03:06.050> with<00:03:06.260> car

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
think Skoda now have come up with car

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.900 
think Skoda now have come up with car
which<00:03:07.240> everybody<00:03:08.240> could<00:03:08.480> use<00:03:09.640> maybe<00:03:10.640> there's

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
which everybody could use maybe there's

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:12.580 
which everybody could use maybe there's
still<00:03:11.120> a<00:03:11.150> little<00:03:11.300> bit<00:03:11.540> of<00:03:11.600> a<00:03:11.630> stigma<00:03:11.870> hanging

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
still a little bit of a stigma hanging

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.970 
still a little bit of a stigma hanging
around<00:03:12.920> but<00:03:13.250> these<00:03:14.240> are<00:03:14.420> good<00:03:14.540> cars<00:03:14.840> and<00:03:15.200> you

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
around but these are good cars and you

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.050

looking but there's worse looking cause
this<00:03:26.660> car<00:03:27.020> feels<00:03:27.290> like<00:03:27.470> it<00:03:27.800> that<00:03:27.950> you<00:03:28.040> could

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
this car feels like it that you could

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.940 
this car feels like it that you could
last<00:03:28.460> a<00:03:28.610> good<00:03:28.760> 10<00:03:29.000> 15<00:03:29.180> years<00:03:29.750> no<00:03:30.200> problem<00:03:30.710> with

daily use high mileage
now<00:03:33.710> let's<00:03:33.950> see<00:03:34.070> what<00:03:34.220> the<00:03:34.280> brakes<00:03:34.520> walk

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
now let's see what the brakes walk

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:40.360 
now let's see what the brakes walk
around<00:03:36.010> well<00:03:37.010> they<00:03:37.940> don't<00:03:38.090> seem<00:03:38.360> too<00:03:38.600> bad<00:03:39.370> but

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
around well they don't seem too bad but

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.340 
around well they don't seem too bad but
I<00:03:40.550> must<00:03:40.940> admit<00:03:41.150> I<00:03:41.300> felt<00:03:41.660> a<00:03:41.720> bit<00:03:41.870> disconnected

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 
I must admit I felt a bit disconnected

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.210 
I must admit I felt a bit disconnected
from<00:03:42.770> them

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
from them

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.990 
from them
this<00:03:44.910> skater<00:03:45.540> it's<00:03:45.930> a<00:03:46.050> bloody<00:03:46.260> good<00:03:46.350> car

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
this skater it's a bloody good car

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.250 
this skater it's a bloody good car
thinking<00:03:48.000> about<00:03:48.210> firing<00:03:48.450> one<00:03:48.750> take<00:03:48.990> this<00:03:49.080> for

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
thinking about firing one take this for

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.750 
thinking about firing one take this for
a<00:03:49.290> test<00:03:49.320> drive<00:03:49.620> I<00:03:49.830> think<00:03:50.220> you<00:03:50.310> will<00:03:50.400> be<00:03:50.430> very

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
a test drive I think you will be very

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.570 
a test drive I think you will be very
pleasantly<00:03:51.150> surprised<00:03:52.190> there's<00:03:53.190> a<00:03:53.280> lot<00:03:53.430> of

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
pleasantly surprised there's a lot of

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.150 
pleasantly surprised there's a lot of

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
good attributes about this there's no

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.550 
good attributes about this there's no

right<00:04:10.590> it's<00:04:10.770> not<00:04:10.890> a<00:04:10.950> bird<00:04:11.190> full<00:04:11.460> of<00:04:11.580> this<00:04:11.700> car

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
right it's not a bird full of this car

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.570 
right it's not a bird full of this car
but<00:04:12.270> it's<00:04:12.420> certainly<00:04:12.990> a<00:04:13.110> very<00:04:13.410> good<00:04:13.710> car<00:04:13.980> and<00:04:14.810> I

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:16.580 
but it's certainly a very good car and I

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:19.099 
but it's certainly a very good car and I
think<00:04:17.580> you'd<00:04:17.790> be<00:04:18.030> hard-pressed<00:04:18.330> to<00:04:18.930> get

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
think you'd be hard-pressed to get

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:22.280 
think you'd be hard-pressed to get
disappointed<00:04:19.830> with<00:04:19.950> this<00:04:20.070> way
