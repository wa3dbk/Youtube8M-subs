fantastic<00:01:55.049> team<00:01:55.470> I<00:01:55.680> mean<00:01:55.740> it's<00:01:56.180> yeah<00:01:57.180> I'm

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
fantastic team I mean it's yeah I'm

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.030 
fantastic team I mean it's yeah I'm
looking<00:01:57.719> forward<00:01:58.079> but<00:01:58.290> he<00:01:58.350> said<00:01:58.560> that<00:01:58.740> doesn't

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
looking forward but he said that doesn't

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.249 
looking forward but he said that doesn't
mean<00:01:59.159> that<00:01:59.310> it's<00:01:59.700> gonna<00:01:59.850> be<00:02:00.090> better<00:02:01.020> or<00:02:01.229> worse

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
mean that it's gonna be better or worse

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.050 
mean that it's gonna be better or worse
we<00:02:01.770> just<00:02:02.040> have<00:02:02.159> to<00:02:02.310> enjoy<00:02:02.430> life<00:02:02.579> and<00:02:02.939> I'm

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
enjoying very much Rubens thanks very

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.639 
enjoying very much Rubens thanks very
much<00:02:05.659> Michael<00:02:06.659> so<00:02:06.960> it<00:02:07.020> sounds<00:02:07.320> though<00:02:07.439> it<00:02:07.560> was

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
much Michael so it sounds though it was

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.040 
much Michael so it sounds though it was
your<00:02:07.860> decision<00:02:08.069> to<00:02:08.550> try<00:02:09.420> and<00:02:09.539> get<00:02:09.660> was<00:02:09.869> it<00:02:09.989> a

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
your decision to try and get was it a

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.270 
your decision to try and get was it a
dead<00:02:10.229> heat<00:02:10.410> do<00:02:10.679> you<00:02:10.739> want<00:02:10.890> to<00:02:10.979> get<00:02:11.129> the

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
dead heat do you want to get the

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.010 
dead heat do you want to get the
ultimate<00:02:11.400> precise<00:02:11.940> bit<00:02:12.150> of<00:02:12.239> driving<00:02:12.450> or<00:02:12.900> did

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
ultimate precise bit of driving or did

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.290 
ultimate precise bit of driving or did
you<00:02:13.080> in

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
you in

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.550 
you in
and<00:02:13.360> for<00:02:13.510> Rubens<00:02:13.780> just<00:02:13.840> to<00:02:14.110> get<00:02:14.230> in<00:02:14.350> front

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
and for Rubens just to get in front

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.960 
and for Rubens just to get in front
maybe<00:02:15.670> I<00:02:15.700> mean<00:02:17.400> we<00:02:18.400> have<00:02:18.490> so<00:02:18.610> many<00:02:18.700> records

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
maybe I mean we have so many records

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.630 
maybe I mean we have so many records
than<00:02:19.630> this<00:02:19.780> year<00:02:19.960> I<00:02:19.990> think<00:02:20.260> there<00:02:20.530> is<00:02:20.560> one<00:02:21.190> what

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
than this year I think there is one what

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.520 
than this year I think there is one what
is<00:02:21.730> the<00:02:21.850> closest<00:02:22.210> finish<00:02:22.330> nobody<00:02:23.140> not<00:02:23.320> on

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
is the closest finish nobody not on

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.710 
is the closest finish nobody not on
honesty<00:02:24.070> I<00:02:24.100> think<00:02:24.520> with<00:02:25.090> such<00:02:25.240> a<00:02:25.270> great<00:02:25.540> team

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
honesty I think with such a great team

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.800 
honesty I think with such a great team
together<00:02:25.990> Rubens<00:02:26.500> and<00:02:26.560> myself<00:02:27.090> we<00:02:28.090> we<00:02:28.630> work

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
together Rubens and myself we we work

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.320 
together Rubens and myself we we work
very<00:02:28.840> hard<00:02:29.140> we<00:02:29.890> have<00:02:30.070> a<00:02:30.250> fantastic<00:02:30.670> team<00:02:31.030> and

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
very hard we have a fantastic team and

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.170 
very hard we have a fantastic team and
and<00:02:31.660> we<00:02:32.290> have<00:02:32.380> always<00:02:32.700> supported<00:02:33.700> each<00:02:33.790> each

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
and we have always supported each each

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.410 
and we have always supported each each
other<00:02:34.510> and<00:02:34.780> today<00:02:35.500> I<00:02:36.490> thought<00:02:37.120> is<00:02:37.210> a<00:02:37.300> good

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
other and today I thought is a good

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.720 
other and today I thought is a good
opportunity<00:02:37.630> to<00:02:38.230> go<00:02:38.650> equal<00:02:39.280> over<00:02:39.460> the<00:02:39.550> line

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
opportunity to go equal over the line

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.620 
opportunity to go equal over the line
and<00:02:40.360> we<00:02:40.480> tried<00:02:40.770> we<00:02:41.770> failed<00:02:41.800> by<00:02:42.130> a<00:02:42.160> little<00:02:42.430> bit

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
and we tried we failed by a little bit

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.730 
and we tried we failed by a little bit
you<00:02:43.630> didn't<00:02:43.840> fail<00:02:43.930> by<00:02:44.140> much<00:02:44.350> that<00:02:44.530> was<00:02:44.650> the

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740 
you didn't fail by much that was the

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.560 
you didn't fail by much that was the
closest<00:02:45.130> ever<00:02:45.310> finished<00:02:45.640> point<00:02:45.850> zero<00:02:46.150> 1<00:02:46.390> of<00:02:46.510> a

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
closest ever finished point zero 1 of a

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.080 
closest ever finished point zero 1 of a
second<00:02:46.930> now<00:02:47.860> he<00:02:47.920> predicted<00:02:48.430> yesterday<00:02:48.880> that

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
second now he predicted yesterday that

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.090 
second now he predicted yesterday that
it'd<00:02:49.180> be<00:02:49.330> a<00:02:49.360> close<00:02:49.660> race<00:02:49.900> here<00:02:50.320> not<00:02:51.070> just

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
it'd be a close race here not just

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.650 
it'd be a close race here not just
between<00:02:51.430> yourself<00:02:51.880> and<00:02:51.970> Rubens<00:02:52.330> but<00:02:52.480> also

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
between yourself and Rubens but also

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.900 
between yourself and Rubens but also
with<00:02:53.020> perhaps<00:02:53.260> McLaren<00:02:54.010> and<00:02:54.280> Williams<00:02:54.700> it

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
with perhaps McLaren and Williams it

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.310 
with perhaps McLaren and Williams it
seemed<00:02:55.180> McLaren<00:02:55.600> really<00:02:55.840> raised<00:02:56.020> their<00:02:56.200> game

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
seemed McLaren really raised their game

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.900 
seemed McLaren really raised their game
today<00:02:56.470> and<00:02:56.650> got<00:02:56.770> right<00:02:56.890> up<00:02:57.070> with<00:02:57.250> you<00:02:57.370> yeah

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
today and got right up with you yeah

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.940 
today and got right up with you yeah
that<00:02:58.270> was<00:02:58.480> expected<00:02:58.810> to<00:02:59.440> be<00:02:59.560> honest<00:02:59.740> and<00:02:59.890> if

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
that was expected to be honest and if

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.090 
that was expected to be honest and if
you<00:03:00.040> see<00:03:00.190> the<00:03:00.340> gap<00:03:00.520> it's<00:03:00.930> just<00:03:01.930> over<00:03:02.260> about<00:03:02.470> 10

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
you see the gap it's just over about 10

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.430 
you see the gap it's just over about 10
seconds<00:03:03.550> of<00:03:03.700> him<00:03:03.850> not<00:03:04.090> even<00:03:04.210> less<00:03:04.510> than<00:03:05.200> 10

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
seconds of him not even less than 10

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.130 
seconds of him not even less than 10
seconds<00:03:05.890> in<00:03:06.730> the<00:03:06.850> end<00:03:06.970> of<00:03:07.060> the<00:03:07.150> race<00:03:07.330> which

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
seconds in the end of the race which

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.320 
seconds in the end of the race which
which<00:03:08.500> shows<00:03:08.740> that<00:03:08.770> it<00:03:09.370> was<00:03:09.520> a<00:03:09.550> tight<00:03:09.820> race<00:03:10.060> I

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
which shows that it was a tight race I

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.630 
which shows that it was a tight race I
think<00:03:10.390> the<00:03:11.110> strategy<00:03:11.320> we<00:03:11.710> use<00:03:11.890> two<00:03:12.100> stops<00:03:12.430> in

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
think the strategy we use two stops in

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.360 
think the strategy we use two stops in
the<00:03:12.760> end<00:03:12.850> was<00:03:13.360> supposed<00:03:13.690> to<00:03:13.810> be<00:03:13.990> by<00:03:14.620> about<00:03:15.100> 10

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
the end was supposed to be by about 10

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.060 
the end was supposed to be by about 10
seconds<00:03:15.790> faster<00:03:15.940> but<00:03:16.930> would<00:03:17.709> we<00:03:17.920> have<00:03:18.040> been

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070 
seconds faster but would we have been

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.910 
seconds faster but would we have been
stucked<00:03:18.520> behind<00:03:19.300> then<00:03:19.930> our<00:03:20.200> strategy<00:03:20.709> could

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
stucked behind then our strategy could

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.360 
stucked behind then our strategy could
have<00:03:21.010> been<00:03:21.190> a<00:03:21.580> problem<00:03:21.880> so<00:03:22.750> all<00:03:23.140> in<00:03:23.350> all<00:03:23.470> we<00:03:24.220> did

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
have been a problem so all in all we did

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:25.920 
have been a problem so all in all we did
the<00:03:24.459> right<00:03:24.610> thing<00:03:24.820> at<00:03:24.940> the<00:03:24.970> right<00:03:25.150> time<00:03:25.209> we<00:03:25.810> had

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
the right thing at the right time we had

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.979 
the right thing at the right time we had
the<00:03:26.020> right<00:03:26.140> car<00:03:26.410> and<00:03:27.330> our<00:03:28.330> guys<00:03:28.600> did<00:03:28.780> the<00:03:28.870> right

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
the right car and our guys did the right

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:31.140 
the right car and our guys did the right
strategy<00:03:29.440> for<00:03:29.470> us<00:03:29.820> thank<00:03:30.820> you<00:03:30.850> very<00:03:30.910> much

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
strategy for us thank you very much

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.990 
strategy for us thank you very much

your<00:03:36.310> only<00:03:36.459> pit<00:03:36.760> stop<00:03:37.030> but<00:03:37.120> you<00:03:37.209> were<00:03:37.300> right

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
your only pit stop but you were right

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.740 
your only pit stop but you were right
behind<00:03:37.660> the<00:03:37.900> Ferraris<00:03:38.320> how<00:03:38.530> how<00:03:39.630> did<00:03:40.630> you

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
behind the Ferraris how how did you

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:41.880 
behind the Ferraris how how did you
reckon<00:03:40.989> at<00:03:41.050> that<00:03:41.170> stage<00:03:41.410> you<00:03:41.560> might<00:03:41.650> be<00:03:41.800> able

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
reckon at that stage you might be able

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.729 
reckon at that stage you might be able
to<00:03:42.070> get<00:03:42.550> past<00:03:42.730> them<00:03:43.350> well<00:03:44.350> there<00:03:44.470> was<00:03:44.560> a<00:03:44.590> lot<00:03:44.709> of

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
to get past them well there was a lot of

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:46.320 
to get past them well there was a lot of
traffic<00:03:44.980> at<00:03:45.250> that<00:03:45.400> point<00:03:45.640> you<00:03:46.030> know<00:03:46.180> it's

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
traffic at that point you know it's

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.810 
traffic at that point you know it's
incredible<00:03:46.450> that<00:03:47.160> I've<00:03:48.160> never<00:03:48.400> seen<00:03:48.610> too<00:03:48.730> many

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:48.820 
incredible that I've never seen too many

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.280 
incredible that I've never seen too many
cars<00:03:49.060> that<00:03:49.150> have<00:03:49.330> to<00:03:49.420> be<00:03:49.510> a<00:03:49.540> lab<00:03:49.720> so<00:03:49.959> in<00:03:50.050> actual

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
cars that have to be a lab so in actual

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.260 
cars that have to be a lab so in actual
fact<00:03:50.380> I<00:03:50.530> think<00:03:50.590> it<00:03:50.739> helped<00:03:51.010> that<00:03:51.100> the<00:03:51.880> Ferraris

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:52.270 
fact I think it helped that the Ferraris

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:53.400 
fact I think it helped that the Ferraris
were<00:03:52.390> going<00:03:52.570> through<00:03:52.690> the<00:03:52.810> traffic<00:03:52.959> first<00:03:53.290> of

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
were going through the traffic first of

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:54.660 
were going through the traffic first of
all<00:03:53.530> and<00:03:53.770> that<00:03:53.890> helped<00:03:54.070> clear<00:03:54.340> a<00:03:54.370> little<00:03:54.489> bit

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
all and that helped clear a little bit

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.640 
all and that helped clear a little bit
of<00:03:54.730> space<00:03:54.880> for<00:03:55.090> me<00:03:55.209> but<00:03:55.840> clearly<00:03:56.140> the<00:03:56.500> fact

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
of space for me but clearly the fact

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.890 
of space for me but clearly the fact
that<00:03:56.800> I<00:03:57.250> was<00:03:57.580> already<00:03:57.700> a<00:03:57.820> stop<00:03:58.090> down<00:03:58.330> and<00:03:58.570> you

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
that I was already a stop down and you

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.600 
that I was already a stop down and you
realistically<00:03:59.560> it<00:03:59.800> was<00:03:59.920> a<00:03:59.950> case<00:04:00.160> of<00:04:00.310> just<00:04:00.430> try

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:00.610 
realistically it was a case of just try

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:03.600 
realistically it was a case of just try
not<00:04:00.640> to<00:04:00.820> lose<00:04:01.600> too<00:04:01.780> much<00:04:01.900> time<00:04:02.170> there<00:04:02.440> and<00:04:02.739> make

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 
not to lose too much time there and make

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:04.860 
not to lose too much time there and make
sure<00:04:03.640> that<00:04:03.880> I<00:04:03.910> could<00:04:04.090> keep<00:04:04.510> with<00:04:04.630> the<00:04:04.720> third

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
sure that I could keep with the third

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.170 
sure that I could keep with the third
place<00:04:05.080> now<00:04:06.040> you're<00:04:06.220> pressing<00:04:06.430> hard<00:04:06.700> right<00:04:06.970> to

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
place now you're pressing hard right to

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.150 
place now you're pressing hard right to
the<00:04:07.270> finish<00:04:07.570> but<00:04:07.780> with<00:04:08.470> one<00:04:08.709> Pablo<00:04:09.040> Montoya

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
the finish but with one Pablo Montoya

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.620 
the finish but with one Pablo Montoya
closing<00:04:09.760> in<00:04:09.880> on<00:04:09.940> you<00:04:10.090> but<00:04:10.300> you<00:04:10.450> couldn't

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630 
closing in on you but you couldn't

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.990 
closing in on you but you couldn't
afford<00:04:10.750> to<00:04:10.930> back<00:04:11.080> off<00:04:11.290> because<00:04:11.530> I<00:04:12.130> would<00:04:12.910> have

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
afford to back off because I would have

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.070 
afford to back off because I would have
thought<00:04:13.120> the<00:04:13.330> knowledge<00:04:13.720> that<00:04:13.750> Kimi

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:14.080 
thought the knowledge that Kimi

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.420 
thought the knowledge that Kimi
räikkönen's<00:04:14.500> engine<00:04:14.800> had<00:04:14.950> blown<00:04:15.100> must<00:04:15.340> have

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
räikkönen's engine had blown must have

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:16.620 
räikkönen's engine had blown must have
made<00:04:15.519> you<00:04:15.670> wanted<00:04:15.910> to<00:04:15.970> lift<00:04:16.120> your<00:04:16.239> foot<00:04:16.390> just

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
made you wanted to lift your foot just

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.720 
made you wanted to lift your foot just
that<00:04:16.720> little<00:04:16.930> bit<00:04:17.049> off<00:04:17.140> the<00:04:17.169> pedal<00:04:17.640> well<00:04:18.640> an

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:18.730 
that little bit off the pedal well an

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:20.520 
that little bit off the pedal well an
actual<00:04:19.000> fact<00:04:19.150> we'd<00:04:19.450> would<00:04:20.200> change<00:04:20.410> the

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
actual fact we'd would change the

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:22.409 
actual fact we'd would change the
strategy<00:04:20.739> on<00:04:21.310> the<00:04:21.460> engine<00:04:21.729> and<00:04:21.940> I<00:04:22.060> was<00:04:22.210> driving

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:22.419 
strategy on the engine and I was driving

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:23.430 
strategy on the engine and I was driving
too

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
too

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.860 
too
protect<00:04:23.710> the<00:04:23.830> engine<00:04:23.950> for<00:04:24.190> the<00:04:24.910> last<00:04:25.120> sort<00:04:25.840> of

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
protect the engine for the last sort of

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.230 
protect the engine for the last sort of
20<00:04:26.080> laps<00:04:26.230> of<00:04:26.380> the<00:04:26.440> race<00:04:26.590> so<00:04:27.310> I<00:04:27.700> think<00:04:27.820> our<00:04:28.000> piece

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 
20 laps of the race so I think our piece

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.090 
20 laps of the race so I think our piece
could<00:04:28.390> have<00:04:28.480> been<00:04:28.570> quicker<00:04:28.750> but<00:04:29.020> you<00:04:29.680> know<00:04:29.800> we

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100 
could have been quicker but you know we

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.980 
could have been quicker but you know we
weren't<00:04:30.250> going<00:04:30.400> to<00:04:30.490> beat<00:04:30.940> Ferrari<00:04:31.120> and<00:04:31.540> it<00:04:31.900> was

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
weren't going to beat Ferrari and it was

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.330 
weren't going to beat Ferrari and it was
just<00:04:32.140> a<00:04:32.170> question<00:04:32.500> of<00:04:32.590> finishing<00:04:32.980> in<00:04:33.070> front<00:04:33.220> of

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
just a question of finishing in front of

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.330 
just a question of finishing in front of
Williams<00:04:33.640> so<00:04:34.500> you<00:04:35.500> know<00:04:35.620> just<00:04:35.800> a<00:04:35.860> precaution

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
Williams so you know just a precaution

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:37.710 
Williams so you know just a precaution
because<00:04:36.640> a<00:04:36.820> Keeney's<00:04:37.120> problem<00:04:37.480> but

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
because a Keeney's problem but

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.950 
because a Keeney's problem but
nonetheless<00:04:38.650> I<00:04:38.980> think<00:04:39.160> we<00:04:39.280> can<00:04:39.430> take<00:04:39.580> a<00:04:39.870> bit<00:04:40.870> of

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
nonetheless I think we can take a bit of

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.510 
nonetheless I think we can take a bit of
a<00:04:40.990> boost<00:04:41.170> from<00:04:41.320> this<00:04:41.500> weekend<00:04:41.830> because<00:04:42.250> we've

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
a boost from this weekend because we've

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.150 
a boost from this weekend because we've
taken<00:04:42.940> a<00:04:43.060> little<00:04:43.150> step<00:04:43.390> forward<00:04:43.890> David<00:04:44.890> thanks

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.160 
taken a little step forward David thanks
