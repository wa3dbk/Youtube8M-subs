00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
detail it's not it wasn't really a

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.920 
detail it's not it wasn't really a
detailed<00:01:00.780> moment<00:01:01.170> in<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.410> beta<00:01:01.820> trailer<00:01:02.930> it

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
detailed moment in the beta trailer it

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.370 
detailed moment in the beta trailer it
was<00:01:04.369> pretty<00:01:05.369> basic<00:01:05.670> but<00:01:06.180> it's<00:01:06.570> very<00:01:06.689> round<00:01:07.080> so

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
was pretty basic but it's very round so

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.660 
was pretty basic but it's very round so
I'm<00:01:07.470> wearing<00:01:07.710> two<00:01:07.770> fiberglass<00:01:08.220> and<00:01:08.400> bond<00:01:08.549> to

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
I'm wearing two fiberglass and bond to

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:09.770 
I'm wearing two fiberglass and bond to
it<00:01:08.760> eventually<00:01:09.000> so<00:01:09.299> that's<00:01:09.479> why<00:01:09.600> I'm<00:01:09.659> using

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
it eventually so that's why I'm using

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.240 
it eventually so that's why I'm using
tape<00:01:10.080> because<00:01:10.320> it<00:01:10.350> doesn't<00:01:10.650> matter<00:01:10.770> cuz<00:01:11.070> it's

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
tape because it doesn't matter cuz it's

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.420 
tape because it doesn't matter cuz it's
gonna<00:01:11.400> disappear<00:01:11.820> anyway<00:01:12.119> I<00:01:12.710> hope<00:01:13.710> I've<00:01:14.040> never

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
gonna disappear anyway I hope I've never

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.740 
gonna disappear anyway I hope I've never
done<00:01:14.640> that<00:01:14.670> I've<00:01:15.090> never<00:01:15.270> done<00:01:15.509> anything

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
done that I've never done anything

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.300 
done that I've never done anything
before<00:01:15.990> I'm<00:01:16.740> I'm<00:01:17.250> quite<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.880> noob<00:01:19.100> so<00:01:20.100> yeah

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
before I'm I'm quite the noob so yeah

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.179 
before I'm I'm quite the noob so yeah

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
made it just cardboard it's too small

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.899 
made it just cardboard it's too small
for<00:01:23.310> my<00:01:23.430> head<00:01:23.750> I<00:01:24.920> would<00:01:25.920> show<00:01:26.070> you<00:01:26.130> my<00:01:26.220> face<00:01:26.580> but

for my head I would show you my face but
it's<00:01:27.810> gonna<00:01:28.020> be<00:01:28.110> too<00:01:28.470> much<00:01:28.500> for<00:01:28.829> work<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.549> it's

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
it's gonna be too much for work and it's

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.140 
it's gonna be too much for work and it's
apparently<00:01:31.530> six<00:01:31.829> o'clock<00:01:32.159> even<00:01:32.759> though<00:01:32.909> it's

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
apparently six o'clock even though it's

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.370

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
I think nose 1142 the time you see this

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.249 
I think nose 1142 the time you see this
it'll<00:01:38.640> be<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.820> morning<00:01:39.150> because<00:01:39.750> I'm<00:01:40.110> gonna

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
it'll be the morning because I'm gonna

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.630 
it'll be the morning because I'm gonna
upload<00:01:40.500> it<00:01:40.680> then<00:01:41.689> but<00:01:42.689> yeah<00:01:43.280> it<00:01:44.280> looks<00:01:44.520> a<00:01:44.610> bit

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
upload it then but yeah it looks a bit

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.160 
upload it then but yeah it looks a bit
better<00:01:45.149> when<00:01:45.630> it's<00:01:46.040> expanded<00:01:47.960> you<00:01:48.960> know<00:01:49.079> what

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
better when it's expanded you know what

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.389 
better when it's expanded you know what
I<00:01:49.229> mean<00:01:49.409> like<00:01:51.259> like<00:01:52.259> a<00:01:52.320> bit<00:01:52.560> widened<00:01:53.009> out<00:01:53.130> more

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
I mean like like a bit widened out more

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.289 
I mean like like a bit widened out more
um<00:01:54.200> not<00:01:55.200> really<00:01:55.380> thin<00:01:55.680> like<00:01:55.860> this<00:01:56.149> maybe<00:01:57.149> I'll

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
um not really thin like this maybe I'll

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.010 
um not really thin like this maybe I'll
find<00:01:57.509> a<00:01:57.570> way<00:01:57.659> to<00:01:57.719> do<00:01:57.840> it

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
find a way to do it

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.260 
find a way to do it
maybe<00:01:58.350> I<00:01:58.439> won't<00:01:58.649> who<00:01:59.100> cares<00:01:59.369> really<00:01:59.670> honestly

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
maybe I won't who cares really honestly

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.240 
maybe I won't who cares really honestly
um<00:02:00.950> yeah<00:02:01.950> that's<00:02:02.430> pretty<00:02:02.969> much<00:02:03.149> it<00:02:04.130> if<00:02:05.130> you
