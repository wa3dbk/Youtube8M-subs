00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:08.809
 hello to you, the gift of murtazin 

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:11.180
 Ifa and we are talking today about 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:14.290
 all kotelevsky tablet 8 inches and 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:17.090
 it's called simple hero 8 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:19.940
 metal case is quite thin 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:22.130
 lte support and these are the conclusions for 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:25.130
 to connect different to sariku in 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:27.890
 particular you can connect the magic 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.920
 not a board as some say look 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:33.500
 pay attention 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:36.320
 appears on top when connected icon 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:39.860
 this magic board is ice 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.870
 tap here can various events if 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.809
 mail came for example if music 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:51.640
 Played let's look at the music on 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:55.910
 the music will play music 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:57.110
 that is, in fact we get very 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.110
 very pleasant 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:02.120
 the evolution of the company 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:06.530
 alcoa are you with the outside covers of the dinners 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:09.080
 here's the add-on over android 4 4 2 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:12.530
 And on typically at Kotelevskaya too 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:15.500
 but there was one chip for which you can 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.070
 send the company say thank you 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.560
 you know 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.650
 main menu she's wife here you know 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:25.310
 a collection of all sorts of pay on 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:27.500
 radio icon for example attention usually 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.320
 radio icon go to the main menu in 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:35.030
 This icon appears such squares 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:37.180
 in the lower corner note that 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.880
 happens i spend 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:43.430
 A quick launch appears from this icon. 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.860
 for example, I can write a dictaphone 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.810
 now what is happening is very cool 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.180
 the chip is actually a widget 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.860
 because on the main screen and 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.110
 really necessary for the widget 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.869
 do well or music like this I can 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.000
 listen to the fact that there is this widget 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:01.130
 which works very cool he is for 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.180
 some only by application but 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:07.640
 let's go back to the stuffing apparatus 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:10.879
 front camera ordinary camera here in 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.460
 Generally for tablets, to say nothing 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:15.740
 very thin keys 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.990
 volume control turning it on 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.520
 generally a sign of the last generation 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:22.160
 products on pusher 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:26.180
 love they make them microusb and 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:29.210
 connector speakers and in general and to port 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:33.980
 to control various techniques for 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:37.850
 SIM card and slot and in general headphones 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:42.950
 you can plug in here turn on the device 8 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:45.140
 In our he is bright enough in him 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:50.450
 there are a few things that him 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:53.600
 differ but first you see how 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:59.690
 status bar does not just look like 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:03:02.510
 she became not androids 6592 mediatek 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.490
 inside full hd screen resolution 5 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:07.940
 megapixel cameras on japan already 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:11.720
 said the internal memory is 16 gigabytes of 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:14.350
 which 12 is available to you if 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:18.290
 talk about 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:21.440
 also the internal memory is 12 gigabytes well 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.990
 that is actually 32 gigabytes 2 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:27.340
 8 gigabytes of RAM 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:29.720
 6592 processor is quite voracious 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:34.070
 small battery for this 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:35.750
 4600 devices just give 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:37.730
 look at this icon which 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:40.910
 surely you are interested in what is it 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:44.780
 this icon is very simple you can 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:46.940
 run various applications such 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:50.510
 multitasking if you want but now I want 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:55.010
 another calendar and run here is the calendar 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:57.080
 and ran and removed it less did then 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.150
 there are essentially we get applications 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.790
 which are running on the same 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:05.390
 Notice the screen when I 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:07.340
 I run the manager of running applications 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:10.160
 the application here also shows something 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:13.340
 I can go over them but they will 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:15.830
 Here in these mini windows and I can change 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:18.020
 their size is rotated on the screen there 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:20.780
 move around the screen wherever i want and 

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:22.970
 working somewhere else is very comfortable in 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:27.500
 unlike for example galaxy well 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:29.540
 and smartphones or there galaxy tabs here 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:32.480
 you can work this way with 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:34.610
 any applications without exception 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.950
 there you can take any 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.290
 applications and it really works 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:41.720
 very cool 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:44.690
 still have if we talk about software 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:47.510
 softy everything is clear and built-in fm radio 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:49.900
 multimedia sync clouds 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:52.010
 storage pusher 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:54.020
 performance is generally average 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:57.740
 while talking about time work probably 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:05:01.430
 premature but first results they 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:03.470
 show that the device is average 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:06.920
 performance if you take top 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:08.660
 device but relatively speaking that is, we 

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.950
 we can compare it with others 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:14.000
 devices 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:15.890
 it has a lot of power but time 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.010
 most likely will suffer because 

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:19.720
 there is always a little on this media library 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:23.330
 flaw 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:25.669
 There is another point in time 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:27.710
 here you can take a bluetooth headset 

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:31.700
 Sidekka Sidekika 2 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:34.040
 which is very small and looks 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:37.280
 as follows, then there is this 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:41.360
 headset with it you can fully call 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:46.700
 that is, you connect you can 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:50.210
 watch my calls here now you 

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:52.100
 can dial on the phone to use 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:56.600
 like a phone small set to 

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:59.690
 buy on an additional start thing 

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:01.970
 cool really cool 

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:04.310
 really if you are for some 

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:07.010
 the reason they chose the tablet as the main 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:08.229
 communication tool such a headset to become 

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:10.700
 your phone 

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:13.130
 Of course text messages write with her not very 

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:15.860
 convenient but on the tablet there to talk about 

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:18.740
 why not such a headset if not suddenly 

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:22.550
 want to connect the usual 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:25.699
 bluetooth headset for tablets i can 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:27.440
 say overall device wolf opel me 

00:06:25.699 --> 00:06:29.900
 I like how the device turns out 

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:32.180
 very solidly made here by 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:34.460
 value for money + design 

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:37.400
 Alcatel is always ahead of the planet 

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:39.860
 it is based on the fact that so wisely 

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:42.139
 made done wisely and beautifully 

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:45.110
 pleasant in general and you can not say that by 

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:47.210
 brand because what talk hotel to me 

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:49.759
 Begins more and more to remind 

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:52.340
 learn and better times because and 

00:06:49.759 --> 00:06:56.630
 design pays attention to the software 

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:58.490
 and you know from year to year sawing and sawing 

00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:01.220
 called do not very bad 

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:04.909
 solutions for the price of this solution for now 

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:07.699
 unknown to appear in Russia in autumn 

00:07:04.909 --> 00:07:10.310
 the model turned out to be interesting to us 

00:07:07.699 --> 00:07:12.229
 look at the cost and i think that 

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:17.120
 possible in the text material which 

00:07:12.229 --> 00:07:19.490
 there will be numbers on efi about this tablet pro 

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:21.699
 We'll talk more about the price and tell you. 

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:25.479
 what is the price and 

00:07:21.699 --> 00:07:29.180
 Well, of course I like this tablet 

00:07:25.479 --> 00:07:30.979
 Looks with this watch you need to buy 

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:32.900
 Separately, I think that such a cover will be 

00:07:30.979 --> 00:07:35.570
 inexpensive enough 

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:37.190
 relatively inexpensive and it is very 

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:40.099
 functionally very nice and interesting 

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:42.560
 on this all while others watch 

00:07:40.099 --> 00:07:44.449
 the news from them we have special 

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:47.259
 section for this stay with us 

00:07:44.449 --> 00:07:47.259
 Hi Bye
