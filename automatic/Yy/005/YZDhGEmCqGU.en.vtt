00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
I'm going to chain one and now I'm going

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.449 
I'm going to chain one and now I'm going
to<00:02:38.490> begin<00:02:38.610> to<00:02:38.940> work<00:02:39.060> back<00:02:39.570> up<00:02:39.870> in<00:02:40.290> the<00:02:41.160> other

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
to begin to work back up in the other

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.580 
to begin to work back up in the other
side<00:02:41.940> of<00:02:41.970> the<00:02:42.270> V<00:02:42.420> stitch<00:02:42.720> in<00:02:42.990> this<00:02:43.230> double

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
side of the V stitch in this double

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.000 
side of the V stitch in this double
crochet<00:02:43.850> so<00:02:44.850> it<00:02:45.240> helps<00:02:45.750> if<00:02:45.930> you<00:02:46.170> turn<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:46.860> work

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
crochet so it helps if you turn the work

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.000 
crochet so it helps if you turn the work
sideways<00:02:47.640> and<00:02:47.970> expose<00:02:48.810> that<00:02:49.200> double<00:02:49.620> crochet

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
sideways and expose that double crochet

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.160 
sideways and expose that double crochet
so<00:02:50.070> that<00:02:50.400> it's<00:02:50.550> easier<00:02:50.940> to<00:02:51.000> work<00:02:51.239> into<00:02:51.630> so<00:02:52.110> I'm

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
so that it's easier to work into so I'm

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.440 
so that it's easier to work into so I'm
going<00:02:52.380> to<00:02:52.470> make<00:02:52.620> 5<00:02:53.010> double<00:02:53.340> crochets<00:02:54.030> on<00:02:54.269> this

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260 
feast stitch that's the basics for

00:04:53.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
feast stitch that's the basics for
making<00:04:53.590> each<00:04:54.010> of<00:04:54.370> these<00:04:54.490> individual<00:04:55.060> shells

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:06.669 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:12.480 

and<00:05:07.150> you<00:05:07.300> can<00:05:07.509> see<00:05:07.749> that<00:05:08.759> each<00:05:09.759> row<00:05:10.180> will<00:05:11.490> be

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:12.490 
and you can see that each row will be

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.399 
and you can see that each row will be
between<00:05:13.090> the<00:05:13.479> scales<00:05:13.810> of<00:05:14.050> the<00:05:14.110> previous<00:05:14.860> row

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:16.409 
between the scales of the previous row

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:18.809 
between the scales of the previous row
I'm<00:05:17.409> not<00:05:17.650> going<00:05:17.860> to<00:05:17.949> explain<00:05:18.189> that<00:05:18.310> in<00:05:18.520> this

00:05:18.809 --> 00:05:18.819 
I'm not going to explain that in this
