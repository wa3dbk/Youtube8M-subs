the<00:00:18.360> similars<00:00:18.690> have<00:00:18.949> two<00:00:19.970> main<00:00:21.470> properties<00:00:22.470> to

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
the similars have two main properties to

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.529 
the similars have two main properties to
them<00:00:22.770> one<00:00:23.220> is<00:00:23.550> how<00:00:23.730> they're<00:00:23.910> carried<00:00:24.210> into<00:00:24.419> the

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
them one is how they're carried into the

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.779 
them one is how they're carried into the
stone<00:00:25.039> there<00:00:26.039> you<00:00:26.099> can<00:00:26.220> see<00:00:26.339> there<00:00:26.550> could<00:00:26.640> be<00:00:26.699> a

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
stone there you can see there could be a

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.200 
stone there you can see there could be a
solvent-based<00:00:27.300> or<00:00:27.689> water-based<00:00:27.960> sealer

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210

stumper has a proprietary solvent /
water<00:00:33.810> carrier<00:00:34.500> so<00:00:34.770> we<00:00:34.800> use<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.250> technology

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
water carrier so we use the technology

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
into the stone quickly and carry out

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.770 
into the stone quickly and carry out
quickly<00:00:43.260> why<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.470> water<00:00:43.770> helps<00:00:44.100> keep<00:00:44.250> it<00:00:44.400> wet

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
quickly why the water helps keep it wet

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.740 
quickly why the water helps keep it wet
to<00:00:45.780> help<00:00:45.960> with<00:00:46.110> residue<00:00:46.770> issues<00:00:47.390> the<00:00:48.390> Salem

to help with residue issues the Salem

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.840 
to help with residue issues the Salem
property<00:00:49.230> is<00:00:49.320> probably<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.710> most<00:00:49.860> important

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
property is probably the most important

many of the sealers that are available

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.300 
many of the sealers that are available
out<00:00:52.710> there<00:00:52.770> use<00:00:53.550> some<00:00:53.910> form<00:00:54.180> of<00:00:54.330> silicone

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:55.310

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
they do a great job against water and

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.130 
they do a great job against water and
oil<00:01:06.630> so<00:01:07.080> we<00:01:07.290> have<00:01:07.439> a<00:01:07.470> unique<00:01:08.090> hybrid<00:01:09.140> solvent

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
oil so we have a unique hybrid solvent

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.590 
oil so we have a unique hybrid solvent
that<00:01:10.470> pulls<00:01:10.710> it<00:01:10.860> in<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.909> floral<00:01:12.240> polymer

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
that pulls it in and the floral polymer

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.469 
that pulls it in and the floral polymer
gives<00:01:12.869> long<00:01:13.729> protection<00:01:14.729> gets<00:01:14.969> both<00:01:15.179> water

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
gives long protection gets both water

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.859 
gives long protection gets both water
and<00:01:15.600> oil<00:01:16.109> stains<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:17.340> lot<00:01:18.299> of<00:01:18.359> people<00:01:18.570> think<00:01:18.780> the

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
and oil stains a lot of people think the

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.239 
and oil stains a lot of people think the
granite<00:01:19.170> doesn't<00:01:19.439> even<00:01:19.530> in<00:01:19.679> be<00:01:19.770> silt<00:01:20.039> so<00:01:20.130> I've

00:01:20.239 --> 00:01:20.249 
granite doesn't even in be silt so I've

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:21.529 
granite doesn't even in be silt so I've
got<00:01:20.399> this<00:01:20.520> light<00:01:20.729> piece<00:01:20.909> of<00:01:21.060> granite<00:01:21.270> here

00:01:21.529 --> 00:01:21.539 
got this light piece of granite here

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:23.120 
got this light piece of granite here
because<00:01:21.840> it's<00:01:21.990> easier<00:01:22.289> to<00:01:22.409> see<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.619> product

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
because it's easier to see the product

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.190 
because it's easier to see the product
and<00:01:23.670> you<00:01:23.759> can<00:01:23.909> see<00:01:24.060> how<00:01:24.240> fast<00:01:24.539> on<00:01:24.899> with<00:01:25.049> this

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
and you can see how fast on with this

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.609 
and you can see how fast on with this
water<00:01:25.499> on<00:01:25.799> how<00:01:26.670> fast<00:01:26.999> it<00:01:27.179> goes<00:01:27.359> in<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:27.899> very

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
water on how fast it goes in and very

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.550 
water on how fast it goes in and very
quickly<00:01:29.009> within<00:01:29.340> seconds<00:01:30.109> darkens<00:01:31.109> the<00:01:31.170> stone

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
quickly within seconds darkens the stone

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.039 
quickly within seconds darkens the stone
we've<00:01:32.399> actually<00:01:32.609> sealed<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.270> site<00:01:33.539> up<00:01:33.719> here

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
we've actually sealed the site up here

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.559 
we've actually sealed the site up here
so<00:01:34.770> when<00:01:35.069> you<00:01:35.189> when<00:01:35.579> you<00:01:35.700> try<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.240> get<00:01:36.450> the

00:01:36.559 --> 00:01:36.569 
so when you when you try to get the

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:38.510 
so when you when you try to get the
water<00:01:36.749> up<00:01:36.899> there<00:01:37.259> you<00:01:37.799> can<00:01:37.979> see<00:01:38.130> how<00:01:38.280> it<00:01:38.399> gets

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
water up there you can see how it gets

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.779 
water up there you can see how it gets
wet<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.210> line<00:01:39.420> is<00:01:39.539> very<00:01:39.780> defined<00:01:40.499> it<00:01:41.310> beads<00:01:41.579> up

00:01:41.779 --> 00:01:41.789 
wet the line is very defined it beads up

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:43.550 
wet the line is very defined it beads up
and<00:01:41.969> actually<00:01:42.359> pushes<00:01:42.719> the<00:01:42.749> water<00:01:42.960> back<00:01:43.319> out

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
and actually pushes the water back out

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.669 
and actually pushes the water back out
away<00:01:44.149> of<00:01:45.149> where<00:01:45.450> it's<00:01:45.630> been<00:01:45.780> sealed<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:46.560> you

00:01:46.669 --> 00:01:46.679 
away of where it's been sealed and you

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:48.469 
away of where it's been sealed and you
can<00:01:46.799> see<00:01:46.979> it<00:01:47.100> come<00:01:47.249> up<00:01:47.280> here<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:47.850> all<00:01:48.359> the

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
can see it come up here and all the

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.340 
can see it come up here and all the
water<00:01:48.659> is<00:01:48.960> pushed<00:01:49.259> back<00:01:49.859> line<00:01:50.819> here<00:01:51.270> so<00:01:52.200> it's

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
water is pushed back line here so it's

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.260 
water is pushed back line here so it's
important<00:01:52.950> once<00:01:53.729> you've<00:01:53.909> sealed<00:01:54.179> your
