00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:15.400
 hello how are you welcome to a 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:17.289
 video to live is special return to 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.580
 cole walt around the clock with the 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:20.439
 that we are for many families 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.300
 especially those that have children is 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:24.279
 a complicated time just because we left 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.349
 the summer with what they have happened to us but 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:28.269
 because we started all the continuous of the 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:29.890
 autumn and winter and with the amount of 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:32.080
 expenses that this entails in families 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.000
 so today what I am going to propose is 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.769
 that we play at the free shop and that 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.329
 means free shop and we were not like your 

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:39.760
 term indicates in English is to buy 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:41.409
 free to say almost at zero cost then 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.539
 what do real terms of the 

00:00:41.409 --> 00:00:45.280
 family so you fuck those things 

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:47.500
 that you have in our children's house that 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.600
 no longer use you no longer need 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.399
 are in good condition and put them to the 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.440
 sale with that money that generated 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:55.359
 these sales you can face two new 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.460
 cases these new needs that 

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:59.530
 you have in return to school at zero cost 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.120
 what kind of things could be harmonious 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.739
 master coaching on things that could 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.629
 perfectly mind because really already 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:06.670
 I do not use for my children in those I teach 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.320
 for example these devices that I have are 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.520
 to listen at a distance not if the baby 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.520
 cries not used 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.250
 sell and they got then to buy by 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.090
 example a new music for my daughter or 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.860
 no pita 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.110
 you can have a lot of compassion for 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.240
 that you no longer use the crisis 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.610
 you can put baby clothes the bottom the 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.080
 baby pint for example travel cots 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.030
 Some of the journey comes a moment that 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.380
 children of any of these older and 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.060
 of mind in his bed but nevertheless 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.560
 still have the travel there in a 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.270
 house if they are in perfect condition 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.070
 why not sell them those families 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.780
 that they may need another type of 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.060
 things that you can sell the level is 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.620
 capable with saddles for the medium is 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.300
 finished this one that I had out there that is not 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.950
 a saddle yes luxury but yes that is 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.360
 an appointment that at a given moment can 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.700
 come very well to a family then to 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.380
 small excursions or to have a couple 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.790
 of silletas in two different houses that 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.710
 you have for example I will move to 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.720
 Expensive combinations like ways to sell 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.580
 your items through ebay and 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.040
 you know that you go the leader of 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.720
 buy online sale worldwide is 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.229
 say that lack of buyers are not going to 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.399
 to have 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:05.810
 the important thing is that you much 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:07.250
 also stand out among all 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.020
 ads that there are on ebay simply 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.560
 register and following a usual process 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.930
 how do you normally 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.209
 in pages on the internet one on twitter 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.220
 registered you have to go to sell 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.720
 those products that advice to both the 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.880
 first will not receive what you see 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.310
 to sell secondly look for a 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.080
 good title to that ad is for that 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.610
 you have to say what the words are 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.349
 keys that will highlight our 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.930
 product for example if you are losing 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:33.300
 He teaches one like a moon trip 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.340
 well, there is only one because it is not a 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.970
 sufficiently descriptive title or if 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.260
 you put a law jane trip for example 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.940
 and detecting information that is 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.560
 a travel cot that is to say brings us a 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.209
 normal audience and that is the brand 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.250
 jane is a respected brand in the 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.690
 market for example if you consider that 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.600
 the price you are putting on that crib 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.670
 it's a very good price you can even 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.680
 add it in the title put a price 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.880
 very good or at a great price 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.590
 very important question that should 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.420
 accompanying your product are the 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.130
 photographs I think that nowadays almost 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.110
 nobody dare to buy things without 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:07.080
 see the photos of how they are and 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.810
 what is your current status 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.340
 Well, several years is to say if 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.380
 you make the photos for example of a 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.810
 chair that you make the chair of the 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.520
 believer in the saddle of the saddle by 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.250
 the back of three students to 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.080
 that can of the product in 360 degrees what 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.700
 same the details for example if 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.220
 we want to sell that clothes to live your 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.960
 partner before taking another picture 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.090
 wide of the low then take a photo 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:32.100
 closest so that you appreciate by 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.870
 example the fabric and that people know they 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.700
 talking about a weak point and not the 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.650
 dimension on the price that we are going to 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.810
 put that is very important to offer 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.240
 a price that is competitive you can go 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.700
 to a search search by products 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.959
 finalized to finalized purchases choose 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.670
 those products that have come 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.290
 then you can see more or less what 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.330
 prices have sold that kind of 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.160
 products or even with seeing the ads 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.600
 that at that moment they are in the air to 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.730
 see what are the prices of yours 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.800
 competition and so put a price that 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.030
 be competitive another very question 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.770
 important is the description of 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.170
 product that is not only the photos but 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:05.910
 write for example put it to the example 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.370
 of the crib if you are going to sell a crib 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:10.980
 it may be very interesting to put 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.780
 dimensions it is also important to add 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.940
 information about payment methods and 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.010
 the shape of the biopic at the beginning until 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.829
 that you get 50 positive points for 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.180
 part of the community is only allowed 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:23.340
 Buy and collect from buyers 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.620
 through paypal this system is a 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.210
 vote system that I was telling you that gives 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.220
 portal security is to say a person 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.199
 buyer one more seller adding up for 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.880
 bonuses depending on how they are from 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:34.260
 positive transactions with that 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.360
 person the question also very 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.740
 important is what ad format 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.270
 are going to do there are two formats of 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.820
 ads so many people identify 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.650
 ebay with auctions but not seen two 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.449
 auctions there is a formula that I think 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.400
 more interesting and is that of bought already 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:50.400
 that is , you give a fair price 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:54.630
 edit this carrycot nor to bet 30 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:57.270
 euros to a 45 euros the price 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.120
 will the consumer buy the costs 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.669
 for 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.229
 how to make the photographs we are all 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:04.120
 against losses that are explained in 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:07.590
 your website and for more information or revenue 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.590
 that you go so that you see it
