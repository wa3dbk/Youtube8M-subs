00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
official name or is but then it's just a

it

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.639 
it
but<00:00:36.000> I<00:00:36.210> put<00:00:36.360> some<00:00:36.570> new<00:00:36.750> fresh<00:00:36.989> batteries<00:00:37.410> in<00:00:37.440> it

but I put some new fresh batteries in it
for<00:00:37.920> them<00:00:38.190> so<00:00:38.579> there's<00:00:38.760> a<00:00:38.820> couple<00:00:38.940> buttons<00:00:39.239> on

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
for them so there's a couple buttons on

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.170 
for them so there's a couple buttons on
it<00:00:39.540> so<00:00:40.320> what<00:00:40.530> this<00:00:40.649> button<00:00:40.890> does<00:00:41.040> right<00:00:41.700> here

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
it so what this button does right here

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:48.830 
it so what this button does right here
is<00:00:44.510> it<00:00:45.510> lets<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.469> light<00:00:46.680> on<00:00:47.120> in<00:00:48.120> there<00:00:48.390> so<00:00:48.629> that's

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
is it lets a light on in there so that's

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.580 
is it lets a light on in there so that's
cool<00:00:50.270> but<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.420> whole<00:00:51.570> point<00:00:52.170> of<00:00:52.230> these<00:00:52.350> is

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
cool but the whole point of these is

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.729 
cool but the whole point of these is
that<00:00:52.739> it's<00:00:52.920> just<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.219> normal<00:00:53.370> so<00:00:54.140> if<00:00:55.140> I<00:00:55.379> open<00:00:55.649> it

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
that it's just a normal so if I open it

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:56.180 
that it's just a normal so if I open it
up

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
up

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.869 
up
I'm<00:00:56.910> just<00:00:57.090> practice<00:00:57.510> open<00:00:58.100> without<00:00:59.100> exploring

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
I'm just practice open without exploring

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.450 
I'm just practice open without exploring
so<00:01:00.420> let<00:01:00.690> me<00:01:00.780> just<00:01:00.930> look<00:01:01.079> for<00:01:01.199> my<00:01:01.289> camera<00:01:01.530> so

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
so let me just look for my camera so

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.719 
so let me just look for my camera so
inside<00:01:02.879> there<00:01:03.719> are<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.379> bunch<00:01:04.769> of<00:01:04.920> cool<00:01:05.610> looking

marbles and these models do come with it
but<00:01:07.500> I<00:01:07.650> guess<00:01:08.090> you<00:01:09.090> would<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.479> whole<00:01:09.600> gimmick

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
but I guess you would the whole gimmick

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.539 
but I guess you would the whole gimmick
was<00:01:10.049> you<00:01:10.170> collect<00:01:10.470> marbles<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:11.130> like<00:01:11.250> the

was you collect marbles and like the

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
different colors of them and stuff would

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.330 
different colors of them and stuff would
mean<00:01:13.950> how<00:01:14.130> rare<00:01:14.340> they<00:01:14.490> are<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:14.850> on<00:01:15.600> them<00:01:15.840> I

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:57.010 

move<00:04:53.870> them<00:04:54.050> over<00:04:54.139> there<00:04:54.820> see<00:04:55.820> he's<00:04:56.330> ready<00:04:56.990> to

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
move them over there see he's ready to

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.159 
move them over there see he's ready to
go<00:04:57.229> but<00:04:57.500> so<00:04:58.370> what's<00:04:58.580> the<00:04:58.700> point<00:04:58.850> of<00:04:58.970> this<00:04:59.180> so

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:00.169 
go but so what's the point of this so

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:02.400 
go but so what's the point of this so
since<00:05:00.380> they're<00:05:00.500> marbles<00:05:00.790> you<00:05:01.790> can<00:05:01.970> shoot<00:05:02.150> them

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.410 
since they're marbles you can shoot them

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:04.510 
since they're marbles you can shoot them
first<00:05:03.410> of<00:05:03.530> all<00:05:03.620> the<00:05:03.830> bottom<00:05:04.160> there's<00:05:04.400> this

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 
first of all the bottom there's this

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.820 
first of all the bottom there's this
thing<00:05:04.790> that<00:05:05.030> moves<00:05:05.690> around<00:05:05.840> like<00:05:06.080> this<00:05:06.350> and<00:05:06.680> it

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:06.830 
thing that moves around like this and it

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:10.450 
thing that moves around like this and it
goes<00:05:06.979> up<00:05:07.220> and<00:05:07.460> down<00:05:08.440> and<00:05:09.440> so<00:05:10.040> what<00:05:10.220> the<00:05:10.310> point

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
goes up and down and so what the point

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:13.629 
goes up and down and so what the point
of<00:05:10.580> that<00:05:10.729> is<00:05:11.260> angle<00:05:12.260> it<00:05:12.380> up<00:05:12.500> and<00:05:13.130> go<00:05:13.370> down

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:13.639 
of that is angle it up and go down

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:15.820 
of that is angle it up and go down
swivel<00:05:14.600> it<00:05:14.690> it<00:05:15.169> can<00:05:15.320> move<00:05:15.440> everywhere

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:15.830 
swivel it it can move everywhere

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.700 
swivel it it can move everywhere
basically<00:05:16.010> so<00:05:16.490> I<00:05:16.550> can<00:05:16.729> angle<00:05:17.120> my<00:05:17.270> shots<00:05:17.590> and<00:05:18.590> so

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
basically so I can angle my shots and so

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.529 
basically so I can angle my shots and so
I<00:05:18.740> guess<00:05:18.979> the<00:05:19.160> games<00:05:19.370> were<00:05:19.550> like<00:05:19.700> battling<00:05:20.240> you

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:20.539 
I guess the games were like battling you

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:23.020 
I guess the games were like battling you
who<00:05:21.169> can<00:05:21.350> go<00:05:21.470> the<00:05:21.530> farthest<00:05:22.039> and<00:05:22.310> stuff<00:05:22.580> let

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:23.030 
who can go the farthest and stuff let

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:29.529 
who can go the farthest and stuff let
them<00:05:23.180> in<00:05:23.990> the<00:05:24.020> back<00:05:25.030> we<00:05:26.030> got<00:05:27.700> but<00:05:28.700> this<00:05:29.030> little

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:29.539 
them in the back we got but this little

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:31.779 
them in the back we got but this little
lever<00:05:29.840> here<00:05:29.990> that<00:05:30.229> pulls<00:05:30.620> back<00:05:30.800> and<00:05:31.070> the

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:31.789 
lever here that pulls back and the

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:35.590 
lever here that pulls back and the
smaller<00:05:32.060> one<00:05:32.300> there<00:05:32.450> pull<00:05:32.630> back<00:05:33.970> and<00:05:34.970> so<00:05:35.419> what

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:35.600 
smaller one there pull back and so what

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:40.210 
smaller one there pull back and so what
we<00:05:35.780> basically<00:05:36.050> do<00:05:36.710> is<00:05:37.960> shoot<00:05:38.960> them<00:05:39.200> you<00:05:40.039> see

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:40.220 
we basically do is shoot them you see

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.010 
we basically do is shoot them you see
this<00:05:40.340> thing<00:05:40.520> that's<00:05:40.729> blocking<00:05:40.880> them<00:05:41.300> so<00:05:41.960> you

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:42.020 
this thing that's blocking them so you

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:46.170 
this thing that's blocking them so you
would<00:05:42.200> pull<00:05:42.470> this<00:05:42.979> back<00:05:44.020> so<00:05:45.020> when<00:05:45.169> I<00:05:45.200> do<00:05:45.320> that

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:46.180 
would pull this back so when I do that

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:51.130 
would pull this back so when I do that
it<00:05:47.180> pulls<00:05:47.450> this<00:05:47.600> down<00:05:48.669> like<00:05:49.669> so<00:05:49.940> and<00:05:50.180> then<00:05:50.570> this

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:51.140 
it pulls this down like so and then this

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:54.190 
it pulls this down like so and then this
you<00:05:51.620> pull<00:05:51.830> it<00:05:51.919> back<00:05:51.950> and<00:05:52.340> release<00:05:52.990> choose<00:05:53.990> some

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:54.200 
you pull it back and release choose some

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:59.380 
you pull it back and release choose some
marble<00:05:54.530> so<00:05:54.830> let's<00:05:55.070> see<00:05:57.820> and<00:05:58.820> it<00:05:58.940> shoots<00:05:59.180> pretty

00:05:59.380 --> 00:05:59.390
