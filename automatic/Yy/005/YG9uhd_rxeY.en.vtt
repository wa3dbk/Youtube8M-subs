00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:36.080 
now the thing that is a little bit

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.440 
now the thing that is a little bit
important<00:00:36.530> about<00:00:36.680> this<00:00:36.860> is<00:00:37.130> that<00:00:37.550> it's<00:00:37.820> hsdpa

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:38.450

so<00:00:39.080> rather<00:00:40.040> than<00:00:40.280> it's<00:00:40.490> 3.5<00:00:41.240> g<00:00:41.510> so<00:00:41.780> rather<00:00:42.050> than

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.320 
so rather than it's 3.5 g so rather than

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.110 
so rather than it's 3.5 g so rather than
just<00:00:42.800> your<00:00:42.950> normal<00:00:43.040> 3ds<00:00:43.460> fees<00:00:43.730> this<00:00:43.940> is

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120 
just your normal 3ds fees this is

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.210 
just your normal 3ds fees this is

supposed to connect to mobile internet

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.400 
supposed to connect to mobile internet
faster<00:00:46.670> and<00:00:46.940> the<00:00:47.690> really<00:00:47.870> good<00:00:48.110> thing<00:00:48.290> about

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.410 
faster and the really good thing about

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:49.630 
faster and the really good thing about
this<00:00:48.590> is<00:00:48.650> that<00:00:48.890> you<00:00:49.040> can<00:00:49.100> use<00:00:49.310> it<00:00:49.340> as<00:00:49.489> a<00:00:49.520> modem
