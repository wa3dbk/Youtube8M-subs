of the slow-motion example all you need

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.650 
of the slow-motion example all you need
to<00:00:49.800> do<00:00:49.920> is<00:00:50.100> hold<00:00:50.340> down<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.910> trigger<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.480> right

yourself a naught point 1 times playback
speed<00:00:57.140> okay<00:00:58.140> so<00:00:58.199> straight<00:00:58.710> away<00:00:58.739> at<00:00:59.129> the

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
speed okay so straight away at the

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.709 
speed okay so straight away at the
naught<00:00:59.460> point<00:00:59.699> 1<00:00:59.910> speed<00:01:00.149> you'll<00:01:00.420> see<00:01:00.570> that

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
naught point 1 speed you'll see that

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.630 
naught point 1 speed you'll see that
you're<00:01:00.840> already<00:01:01.199> getting<00:01:01.469> a<00:01:01.649> very<00:01:01.890> good<00:01:02.070> slow

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
you're already getting a very good slow

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.820 
you're already getting a very good slow
motion<00:01:02.820> but<00:01:03.570> we<00:01:03.750> want<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.050> go<00:01:04.199> even<00:01:04.799> slower

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
motion but we want to go even slower

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.800 
motion but we want to go even slower
than<00:01:05.280> this<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:05.729> this<00:01:06.119> is<00:01:06.299> where<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.570> next

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
than this and this is where the next

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.760 
than this and this is where the next
part<00:01:07.020> of<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.320> slow-motion<00:01:07.890> example<00:01:08.580> comes<00:01:08.939> in

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
part of the slow-motion example comes in

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.859 
part of the slow-motion example comes in
so<00:01:10.770> here<00:01:11.070> we<00:01:11.189> are<00:01:11.340> at<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:12.150> final<00:01:12.360> result

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
so here we are at the the final result

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.510 
so here we are at the the final result
of<00:01:12.990> what<00:01:13.170> we're<00:01:13.290> looking<00:01:13.560> for<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:13.950> we've

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
of what we're looking for and we've

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.609 
of what we're looking for and we've
recorded<00:01:14.909> with<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.600> naught<00:01:16.079> point<00:01:16.350> 1

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
recorded with the naught point 1

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.880 
recorded with the naught point 1
playback<00:01:17.520> speed<00:01:17.850> in<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.360> theater<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:19.020> what

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
playback speed in the theater and what

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.490 
playback speed in the theater and what
I've<00:01:20.100> also<00:01:20.520> done<00:01:20.880> is<00:01:21.119> I've<00:01:21.270> taken<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:22.140> clip

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
I've also done is I've taken the clip

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.310 
I've also done is I've taken the clip
into<00:01:22.770> Sony<00:01:23.369> Vegas<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:24.030> I've<00:01:24.689> stretched<00:01:25.110> the

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
into Sony Vegas and I've stretched the

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.870 
into Sony Vegas and I've stretched the
clip<00:01:25.560> so<00:01:25.799> not<00:01:25.920> only<00:01:26.009> has<00:01:26.189> it<00:01:26.220> been<00:01:26.400> slowed<00:01:26.700> down

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
clip so not only has it been slowed down

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.840 
clip so not only has it been slowed down
in<00:01:27.150> game<00:01:27.390> it<00:01:27.659> has<00:01:28.049> also<00:01:28.290> been<00:01:28.470> slowed<00:01:29.280> down<00:01:29.520> on

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
in game it has also been slowed down on

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.240 
in game it has also been slowed down on
the<00:01:31.490> editing<00:01:32.490> software<00:01:32.960> post-processing<00:01:34.250> old

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
the editing software post-processing old

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.069 
the editing software post-processing old
also<00:01:35.549> just<00:01:35.850> lot<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.119> point<00:01:36.329> out<00:01:36.540> that<00:01:36.750> black

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
also just lot to point out that black

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.050 
also just lot to point out that black

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
slowing a clip down which is how it used

one<00:02:12.270> thing<00:02:12.420> I've<00:02:12.540> is<00:02:12.720> a<00:02:12.750> lot<00:02:13.110> of<00:02:13.200> editors<00:02:13.470> like

one thing I've is a lot of editors like
to<00:02:13.800> do<00:02:13.890> is<00:02:14.070> they'll

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
to do is they'll

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.100 
to do is they'll
playclip<00:02:14.730> full<00:02:15.060> speed<00:02:15.329> slow<00:02:15.629> it<00:02:15.780> down<00:02:15.810> and

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
playclip full speed slow it down and

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.229 
playclip full speed slow it down and
then<00:02:16.470> go<00:02:16.680> back<00:02:16.860> to<00:02:16.920> full<00:02:17.280> speed<00:02:17.430> now<00:02:18.060> this

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
then go back to full speed now this

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:20.569 
then go back to full speed now this
works<00:02:18.540> particularly<00:02:19.290> well<00:02:19.590> with<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.400> naught

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:20.579 
works particularly well with the naught

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:23.270 
works particularly well with the naught

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:24.629 
all about being creative with the

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:26.809 
all about being creative with the
trigger<00:02:24.989> and<00:02:25.170> then<00:02:25.319> playing<00:02:25.590> the<00:02:25.799> clip<00:02:26.159> again

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819
