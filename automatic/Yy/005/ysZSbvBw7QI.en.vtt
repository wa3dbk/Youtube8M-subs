00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:03.439 

let's<00:00:02.639> do<00:00:02.820> it

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
let's do it

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:05.420 
let's do it
let's<00:00:03.750> try<00:00:03.929> to<00:00:03.990> plug<00:00:04.230> in<00:00:04.380> the<00:00:04.470> insert<00:00:04.740> so<00:00:04.920> so

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
let's try to plug in the insert so so

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.580 
let's try to plug in the insert so so
far<00:00:05.609> we<00:00:05.759> have<00:00:06.440> clean<00:00:07.440> sound<00:00:09.559> too<00:00:10.559> much

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
far we have clean sound too much

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.410 
far we have clean sound too much
compression

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:14.420 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:30.180 

let's<00:00:15.420> get<00:00:15.690> changed<00:00:17.900> dynamics

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:30.190 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:47.940 

you

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:47.950 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.750 

okay<00:00:48.950> we<00:00:49.100> got<00:00:49.309> it<00:00:49.489> and<00:00:49.640> let's<00:00:51.190> what<00:00:52.190> we<00:00:52.309> do<00:00:52.520> now

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
okay we got it and let's what we do now

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.549 
okay we got it and let's what we do now
go<00:00:53.230> to<00:00:54.230> effects<00:00:55.540> take<00:00:56.540> the<00:00:56.690> first<00:00:56.930> effect<00:00:57.350> now

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 
go to effects take the first effect now

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:02.700 
go to effects take the first effect now
for<00:00:57.860> example<00:00:57.980> what<00:00:58.579> I<00:00:58.610> added<00:00:59.090> and<00:01:01.210> change<00:01:02.210> it

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
for example what I added and change it

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.290 
for example what I added and change it
that<00:01:03.710> was<00:01:03.890> in<00:01:04.220> the<00:01:04.369> boss<00:01:04.550> I<00:01:04.850> changed<00:01:05.180> it<00:01:05.269> to

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:05.300 
that was in the boss I changed it to

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:11.640 
that was in the boss I changed it to
insert<00:01:05.780> a<00:01:06.820> sign<00:01:07.820> if<00:01:07.940> we<00:01:08.119> insert<00:01:09.610> went<00:01:10.610> back<00:01:10.820> to

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:11.650 
insert a sign if we insert went back to

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.969 
insert a sign if we insert went back to
channel<00:01:12.650> and<00:01:13.450> here<00:01:14.450> at<00:01:14.540> home<00:01:14.570> I<00:01:15.140> have<00:01:15.530> to<00:01:15.710> act

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
channel and here at home I have to act

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:21.999 
channel and here at home I have to act
I<00:01:16.070> selected<00:01:16.580> pre<00:01:16.909> pre<00:01:17.540> cue<00:01:17.900> and<00:01:20.350> and<00:01:21.350> it<00:01:21.770> goes

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
I selected pre pre cue and and it goes

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:25.620 
I selected pre pre cue and and it goes
pretty<00:01:22.340> dynamic<00:01:22.580> so<00:01:23.000> we<00:01:23.119> can<00:01:23.300> see<00:01:24.130> the<00:01:25.130> order

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
pretty dynamic so we can see the order

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.740 
pretty dynamic so we can see the order
and<00:01:26.630> we<00:01:26.960> have<00:01:27.170> to<00:01:27.350> activate<00:01:27.649> the<00:01:27.890> insert

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:40.359 

so<00:01:31.590> so<00:01:31.920> far<00:01:32.160> we<00:01:32.370> have<00:01:32.400> it<00:01:32.790> a<00:01:32.910> little<00:01:33.030> bit

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:41.620 

little<00:01:40.670> bit<00:01:40.759> too<00:01:40.880> much<00:01:41.060> on<00:01:41.210> the<00:01:41.299> game<00:01:41.479> is

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
little bit too much on the game is

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:49.670 
little bit too much on the game is
clipping<00:01:41.899> sometimes

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.780 

let's<00:01:50.430> go<00:01:50.580> back<00:01:50.790> to<00:01:50.940> effect<00:01:52.310> and<00:01:53.310> see<00:01:53.520> what<00:01:53.670> we

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
let's go back to effect and see what we

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:54.170 
let's go back to effect and see what we
got

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
got

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.510 
got
so<00:01:54.900> first<00:01:55.260> of<00:01:55.410> all<00:01:55.500> we<00:01:55.680> can<00:01:55.860> have<00:01:56.160> we<00:01:56.310> have<00:01:56.490> a

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
so first of all we can have we have a

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.090 
so first of all we can have we have a
cabinet<00:01:56.970> simulation<00:01:57.540> we<00:01:58.530> can<00:01:58.560> shut<00:01:58.890> it<00:01:58.920> off

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
cabinet simulation we can shut it off

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.590 
cabinet simulation we can shut it off
and<00:02:01.460> those<00:02:02.460> who<00:02:02.640> play<00:02:02.850> guitar<00:02:03.180> knows<00:02:03.390> will

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
and those who play guitar knows will

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.650 
and those who play guitar knows will
happen<00:02:03.930> when<00:02:04.080> you<00:02:04.170> now<00:02:04.650> plug<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.660> overdrive

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:06.660 
happen when you now plug the overdrive

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:07.999 
happen when you now plug the overdrive
directly<00:02:07.080> into<00:02:07.260> the<00:02:07.350> board<00:02:07.560> without<00:02:07.830> them

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
directly into the board without them

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.030 
directly into the board without them
simulator<00:02:08.429> with<00:02:08.759> it<00:02:08.940> without<00:02:09.179> them<00:02:09.540> simulator

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:10.040 
simulator with it without them simulator

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.860 
simulator with it without them simulator
or<00:02:11.040> without<00:02:11.520> the<00:02:11.760> cabinet<00:02:12.150> simulation<00:02:12.630> here

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
or without the cabinet simulation here

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:19.210 
or without the cabinet simulation here
we<00:02:12.990> simulate<00:02:13.530> the<00:02:13.620> cabin

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.050 

I<00:02:19.250> can<00:02:19.610> go

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
I can go

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:28.110 
I can go
and<00:02:22.130> change

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.360 

change<00:02:29.120> some<00:02:29.360> parameters<00:02:29.540> a<00:02:30.260> little<00:02:30.770> bit<00:02:31.220> low

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
change some parameters a little bit low

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:48.800 
change some parameters a little bit low
on<00:02:31.490> the<00:02:31.610> drive

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:03:01.940 

I'm<00:02:49.500> doing<00:02:49.860> everything<00:02:50.130> goes<00:02:50.459> down

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.520 

since<00:03:02.670> we<00:03:02.790> have<00:03:02.940> a<00:03:02.970> stereo<00:03:03.450> priam<00:03:03.870> so<00:03:04.140> they

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
since we have a stereo priam so they

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.490 
since we have a stereo priam so they
have<00:03:04.709> two<00:03:04.980> separate<00:03:05.340> controls<00:03:06.150> over<00:03:06.500> off

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
have two separate controls over off

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.979 
have two separate controls over off
channel<00:03:08.069> so<00:03:08.280> first<00:03:09.030> two<00:03:09.209> is<00:03:09.300> not<00:03:09.480> activated

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
channel so first two is not activated

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.550 
channel so first two is not activated
right<00:03:10.319> now<00:03:10.530> so<00:03:10.709> we're<00:03:10.830> starting<00:03:11.130> from<00:03:11.250> three<00:03:11.580> a

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
right now so we're starting from three a

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.510 
right now so we're starting from three a
little<00:03:13.560> bit

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.140 

you<00:03:18.300> can<00:03:18.450> see<00:03:18.630> I'm<00:03:18.750> changing<00:03:18.810> the<00:03:19.200> buzz<00:03:20.150> that's

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
you can see I'm changing the buzz that's

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.850 
you can see I'm changing the buzz that's
just<00:03:21.360> a<00:03:21.480> little<00:03:21.690> bit<00:03:21.780> of<00:03:21.900> Drive<00:03:22.140> I<00:03:22.170> can<00:03:22.560> do

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
just a little bit of Drive I can do

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.680 
just a little bit of Drive I can do
crunch

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.240 

you<00:03:28.020> can<00:03:28.230> adjust<00:03:28.320> a<00:03:28.650> little<00:03:28.710> bit<00:03:28.860> of<00:03:29.040> Lowe's<00:03:29.220> a

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
you can adjust a little bit of Lowe's a

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:36.320 
you can adjust a little bit of Lowe's a
little<00:03:29.580> bit<00:03:29.670> of<00:03:29.760> ice<00:03:29.970> whatever<00:03:34.850> then<00:03:35.850> we<00:03:36.120> can

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
little bit of ice whatever then we can

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:41.440 
little bit of ice whatever then we can
go<00:03:36.480> to<00:03:36.540> the<00:03:37.020> effects<00:03:37.500> section<00:03:38.040> and<00:03:38.930> a<00:03:39.930> little

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
go to the effects section and a little

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:47.510 
go to the effects section and a little
delay<00:03:42.450> probably<00:03:44.180> what<00:03:45.180> we<00:03:45.330> have<00:03:45.510> you<00:03:46.460> go<00:03:47.460> to

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:47.520 
delay probably what we have you go to

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.940 
delay probably what we have you go to
effects<00:03:48.380> home

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
effects home

00:03:49.950 --> 00:04:23.790 
effects home
we<00:03:50.250> have<00:03:50.400> stereo<00:03:50.760> delay<00:03:50.910> on<00:03:51.180> to<00:03:51.450> both<00:03:51.630> 15

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.990 

I<00:04:23.830> can<00:04:24.610> also<00:04:24.789> add<00:04:25.060> a<00:04:25.090> little<00:04:25.389> bit<00:04:25.599> of<00:04:25.630> workhorse

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
I can also add a little bit of workhorse

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:43.360 
I can also add a little bit of workhorse
you

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.310 

and<00:04:44.370> if<00:04:44.520> you<00:04:44.640> want<00:04:44.820> to<00:04:44.910> go<00:04:45.000> really<00:04:45.540> hard<00:04:45.780> let's

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
and if you want to go really hard let's

00:04:46.320 --> 00:05:14.250 
and if you want to go really hard let's
bring<00:04:46.860> up<00:04:47.190> some<00:04:48.110> noise
