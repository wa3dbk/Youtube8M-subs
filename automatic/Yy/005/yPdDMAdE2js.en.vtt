00:05:17.869 --> 00:05:17.879 
key over fired right up

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:22.679 
key over fired right up
we<00:05:18.879> got<00:05:19.590> mr.<00:05:20.590> Shannon<00:05:21.069> out<00:05:21.189> there<00:05:21.400> looking<00:05:21.789> no

we got mr. Shannon out there looking no
fuel<00:05:23.020> leaks<00:05:25.560> that's<00:05:26.560> how<00:05:26.710> you<00:05:26.770> change<00:05:26.979> your

00:05:27.179 --> 00:05:27.189 
fuel leaks that's how you change your

00:05:33.089 --> 00:05:33.099

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:35.590 
models oh seven and a half because they

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:39.330 
models oh seven and a half because they
