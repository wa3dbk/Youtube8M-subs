00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:07.140
 windows 10 is here and now finally 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.240
 also the version for mobile phones and for 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.219
 small tablets so under 8 inches 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.960
 that is practically what everyone is 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.389
 commonly referred to as windows phone 10 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.810
 denote is not finished yet 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.810
 but about the app windows insider can 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.150
 you look at a pre- developer version 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:26.430
 on his lumia phone or his windows 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.160
 Charge smartphone and then handy 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.439
 Watch as this system intervenes 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.719
 Here we see the current state it is 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.050
 So it was not right now 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.510
 recommend for normal everyday cell phones 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.920
 but in principle for second devices because 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.870
 It is not quite finished yet 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.670
 you can already see this whole system 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.770
 Settings are cleared up 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.270
 and you will also find it so pc-like 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.739
 Settings for the devices are now 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.879
 also printer mouse keyboard 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.379
 listed here are connections 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.750
 not yet planned but you 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.890
 should also have bluetooth keyboards and 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.910
 Mice can now use the other 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.680
 You can see new things when you give it that 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.930
 pulls down first looks like 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.810
 earlier then another tip 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.100
 There are three years old here 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:14.100
 So previews fast settings 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.630
 so that you can take her eg blood and 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.080
 can turn off camera that had one 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.490
 also before but you can also on 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.619
 rotation later internet release 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.380
 airplane mode all this so you have more 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.500
 opportunities more quickly accesses to 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.570
 which one can access 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:33.180
 In principle, the optics is like 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.030
 the sensation is different 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.549
 principle the big goal of microsoft 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.960
 Mobile tablet and pc notebook all too 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.880
 to throw a system together 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.670
 So everything is under the hood what 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.369
 beyond the menu or below the menu 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:51.450
 this is really in windows 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:54.899
 10 with the less same software the 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.189
 even when pc works here we see 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.049
 there is still a start screen there 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.290
 not much changed you should now too 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.950
 in complete and ford completely 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.990
 screen-filling image behind it 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.610
 can in our trial has that 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.140
 also does not work if you are now in 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.379
 the apps will go and have many apps then 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:13.050
 annoying when you have new apps loaded 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:16.020
 I immediately find again now here 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.300
 a separate department new in 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.160
 last installed apps this is here 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.370
 the windows insider app and the 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.350
 low- voltage mode apropos low- power mode 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.300
 is always a nuisance that for many 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.920
 phones the updates but then very late 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.360
 I'm afraid that will 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.480
 probably synonymous with windows happy 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.610
 10 or windows 10 for us not that 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.230
 case be different but what microsoft 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.970
 Being clever has many features 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.580
 that is, realized as individual apps 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.980
 even without the network operator unplust the 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.960
 network operator has been approved 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.090
 because updates are relatively easy on the 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:51.180
 store can install if the 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:54.090
 you can find apps too 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:59.490
 few innovations eg in the photos there should 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:04.470
 then here also from drive and everything with 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:07.370
 be here in the photo stream 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.960
 is still interesting here is the 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.570
 calendar should then someday also 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.550
 very similar to windows 10 running 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:16.620
 so with the colorful presentation and such 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:20.010
 unfortunately this is not yet 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.780
 So looks like before, so a 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.880
 There are also some new apps out there 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.280
 the really interesting ones are coming 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.900
 but only then an advantage 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.420
 this common code base is if 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.500
 microsoft office the next one is done 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.050
 then it really will be here 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.750
 full word excel powerpoint exactly 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:39.510
 run with the same code as on the pc 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:42.320
 that means in the ideal case at least one has 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:45.239
 then no compatibility issues with 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:47.250
 between pc mobile tablet but man 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:49.530
 the whole thing can really run full 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.690
 which is not new yet 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.600
 is the new browser 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.800
 here is the internet explorer 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:59.100
 installed, however, has microsoft 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:03.150
 behind it already the new engine for the 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:05.130
 new saving browser installed and 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.950
 there are still a few small things 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.640
 the kind of pc feeling 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.920
 mediate if I have a new one now 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.420
 E-mail I can hang on here 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.000
 not only take pictures but I can 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.680
 also in file manager go the 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.690
 By the way, also completely new is so one 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.799
 bit looks different than the north 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.590
 but come a bit like that 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:24.600
 real pc feeling you have already and 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.060
 Can he in the different folders 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.460
 go and then berlin 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.960
 send the files so they too 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.330
 really a little bit more 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:35.120
 Functionality is like everything else 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.610
 a pc represents nice gimmick to 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.200
 end when I turn off the device 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.460
 now the mobile phone points me to it 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.560
 out that I might in soon 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.990
 I could miss an appointment 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.150
 really a pretty nice feature for that 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.340
 First impression is it runs so relatively 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.710
 fluent but not to study 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:53.000
 like a real system because of that and 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:55.120
 because also many functions among others 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.350
 just the portaner the 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:01.280
 said assistant that I just 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:03.050
 get that that's why it's missing 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.389
 is not recommended that here already 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.460
 on german flower sea devices too 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:09.560
 you really install in everyday life 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:11.540
 used but who has fun at the 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:14.960
 Development can pursue the whole 

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:17.060
 even on the cheap lumia 630 5 90 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.520
 install euro if that still as 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:21.680
 second mobile has or is increasing 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.900
 is definitely an exciting thing 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:26.540
 Thanks to be ready to be done the whole 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:28.630
 probably I think summer at the latest in 

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:28.630
 autumn
