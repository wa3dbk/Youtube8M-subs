can<00:01:05.239> see<00:01:05.570> this<00:01:05.869> manufacturer<00:01:06.680> chose<00:01:07.040> to

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
can see this manufacturer chose to

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.880 
can see this manufacturer chose to
replace<00:01:07.970> the<00:01:08.240> original<00:01:08.360> fuel<00:01:09.079> lines<00:01:09.380> on<00:01:09.680> this

actually<00:01:13.040> makes<00:01:13.310> good<00:01:13.610> sense<00:01:13.880> because<00:01:14.570> as<00:01:14.750> you

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
actually makes good sense because as you

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.410 
actually makes good sense because as you
can<00:01:15.259> imagine<00:01:15.380> dropping<00:01:16.310> the<00:01:16.640> floor<00:01:16.939> several

even the biggest concern here these fuel

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.300 
event of a rear impact all right let's
take<00:03:46.810> a<00:03:46.870> look<00:03:46.989> at<00:03:47.260> another<00:03:47.410> manufacturers

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
take a look at another manufacturers

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.410 
take a look at another manufacturers
fuel<00:03:48.519> tank<00:03:50.400> what<00:03:51.400> you<00:03:51.549> wouldn't<00:03:51.819> know<00:03:52.060> by

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
fuel tank what you wouldn't know by

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.629 
fuel tank what you wouldn't know by
looking<00:03:52.450> at<00:03:52.930> it<00:03:53.079> is<00:03:53.230> that<00:03:53.650> the<00:03:53.769> OEM<00:03:54.220> of<00:03:54.459> this

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:54.639 
looking at it is that the OEM of this

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:56.940 
looking at it is that the OEM of this
vehicle<00:03:55.180> actually<00:03:55.420> had<00:03:55.959> support<00:03:56.590> straps

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
vehicle actually had support straps

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.819 
vehicle actually had support straps
running<00:03:57.489> from<00:03:57.670> front<00:03:58.060> to<00:03:58.540> back<00:03:58.750> but<00:03:59.079> this

00:03:59.819 --> 00:03:59.829 
running from front to back but this

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:03.030 
running from front to back but this
manufacturer<00:04:00.609> turned<00:04:01.299> the<00:04:01.750> gas<00:04:01.930> tank<00:04:02.319> and<00:04:02.560> of

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
manufacturer turned the gas tank and of

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.789 
manufacturer turned the gas tank and of
course<00:04:03.250> the<00:04:03.430> support<00:04:03.609> straps<00:04:04.120> 90<00:04:05.079> degrees<00:04:05.470> so

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:05.799 
course the support straps 90 degrees so

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:08.660 
course the support straps 90 degrees so
now<00:04:06.310> the<00:04:06.940> straps<00:04:07.239> run<00:04:07.480> from<00:04:07.900> side<00:04:08.139> to<00:04:08.170> side

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
now the straps run from side to side

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:13.339 
now the straps run from side to side
totally<00:04:09.670> contrary<00:04:10.269> to<00:04:10.419> what<00:04:10.870> the<00:04:10.989> OEM<00:04:11.410> did<00:04:12.060> why

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:13.349 
totally contrary to what the OEM did why

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:17.339 
totally contrary to what the OEM did why
is<00:04:14.349> there<00:04:14.620> is<00:04:14.859> there<00:04:14.980> a<00:04:15.010> good<00:04:15.190> reason<00:04:15.250> on<00:04:16.349> a

00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:17.349 
is there is there a good reason on a

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:19.529 
is there is there a good reason on a
more<00:04:17.590> positive<00:04:17.769> note<00:04:18.099> this<00:04:18.760> manufacturer

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:19.539 
more positive note this manufacturer

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:21.930 
more positive note this manufacturer
doesn't<00:04:19.870> use<00:04:20.229> hose<00:04:20.620> in<00:04:21.010> the<00:04:21.130> fuel<00:04:21.370> system<00:04:21.639> and

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
doesn't use hose in the fuel system and

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.450 
doesn't use hose in the fuel system and
that's<00:04:22.390> a<00:04:22.510> good<00:04:22.720> thing<00:04:22.960> these<00:04:23.650> are<00:04:23.710> steel

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
that's a good thing these are steel

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.339 
that's a good thing these are steel
lines<00:04:24.820> and<00:04:25.210> that's<00:04:25.599> better<00:04:25.900> from<00:04:26.229> an

00:04:26.339 --> 00:04:26.349 
lines and that's better from an

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:27.820 
lines and that's better from an
engineering<00:04:26.740> perspective

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
engineering perspective

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.450 
engineering perspective
but<00:04:28.669> then<00:04:28.879> you<00:04:29.240> see<00:04:29.479> something<00:04:29.750> like<00:04:29.930> this

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
but then you see something like this

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.939 
but then you see something like this
this<00:04:31.460> is<00:04:31.789> an<00:04:32.180> evaporation<00:04:32.810> line<00:04:33.259> and<00:04:33.560> it

00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:33.949 
this is an evaporation line and it

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:36.219 
this is an evaporation line and it
circles<00:04:34.460> back<00:04:34.759> and<00:04:35.000> rubs<00:04:35.449> against<00:04:35.870> the<00:04:35.990> body

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:36.229 
circles back and rubs against the body

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:39.010 
circles back and rubs against the body
right<00:04:36.500> here<00:04:36.560> it's<00:04:37.550> not<00:04:37.789> routed<00:04:38.389> right<00:04:38.689> and

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
right here it's not routed right and

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.129 
right here it's not routed right and
there's<00:04:39.560> too<00:04:39.830> much<00:04:40.069> excess<00:04:40.669> it<00:04:41.659> looks<00:04:41.930> like

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:42.139 
there's too much excess it looks like

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:43.950 
there's too much excess it looks like
they<00:04:42.319> made<00:04:42.590> it<00:04:42.740> fit<00:04:43.009> as<00:04:43.219> best<00:04:43.610> they<00:04:43.729> could

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 
they made it fit as best they could

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.869 
they made it fit as best they could
which<00:04:44.960> if<00:04:45.259> you<00:04:45.469> ask<00:04:45.500> me<00:04:46.009> isn't<00:04:46.639> good<00:04:46.849> enough

00:04:46.869 --> 00:04:46.879 
which if you ask me isn't good enough

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:50.339 
which if you ask me isn't good enough
it's<00:04:47.689> a<00:04:47.840> shortcut<00:04:48.229> in<00:04:48.830> your<00:04:49.069> fuel<00:04:49.310> system

00:04:50.339 --> 00:04:50.349 
it's a shortcut in your fuel system

it's a shortcut in your fuel system
