00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
locked and that's the only thing I can

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.550 
locked and that's the only thing I can
think<00:00:14.940> of<00:00:15.420> to<00:00:15.540> refer<00:00:15.750> to<00:00:15.929> it<00:00:16.049> if<00:00:16.320> you<00:00:16.410> have<00:00:16.529> a

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
think of to refer to it if you have a

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.130 
think of to refer to it if you have a
passcode<00:00:16.800> lock<00:00:17.189> on<00:00:17.340> your<00:00:17.460> iphone<00:00:17.790> or<00:00:17.820> ipod<00:00:18.210> or

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
passcode lock on your iphone or ipod or

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.550 
passcode lock on your iphone or ipod or
ipad<00:00:19.970> somebody<00:00:20.970> tries<00:00:21.239> to<00:00:21.419> get<00:00:21.540> into<00:00:21.689> it<00:00:21.960> and<00:00:22.140> I

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
ipad somebody tries to get into it and I

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.560 
ipad somebody tries to get into it and I
think<00:00:22.619> it's<00:00:22.890> five<00:00:23.130> attempts<00:00:23.669> if<00:00:23.849> they<00:00:24.000> try<00:00:24.540> to

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
think it's five attempts if they try to

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.359 
think it's five attempts if they try to
get<00:00:24.750> into<00:00:25.020> it<00:00:25.169> it<00:00:25.320> will<00:00:25.439> lock<00:00:25.649> your<00:00:25.860> ipod<00:00:26.220> up

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
get into it it will lock your ipod up

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.190 
get into it it will lock your ipod up
for<00:00:26.550> like<00:00:26.640> a<00:00:26.669> minute<00:00:26.970> then<00:00:27.540> if<00:00:27.660> they<00:00:27.720> try<00:00:27.930> again

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:28.200 
for like a minute then if they try again

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.170 
for like a minute then if they try again
five<00:00:28.470> minutes<00:00:28.860> then<00:00:29.130> or<00:00:29.550> two<00:00:29.730> minutes<00:00:30.059> or

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:30.180 
five minutes then or two minutes or

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:31.159 
five minutes then or two minutes or
something<00:00:30.239> like<00:00:30.419> that<00:00:30.480> but<00:00:30.689> every<00:00:30.869> time<00:00:30.989> they

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:31.169
