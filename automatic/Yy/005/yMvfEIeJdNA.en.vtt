00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:10.510
 thank you for continuing with us and going 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:18.640
 very much pleasure to receive in the study of 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:21.610
 function he hears that there is the only one in 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.020
 preproduction of the new show that is going to 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:24.970
 be the biggest we have done up 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:26.230
 now then they went to advance 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.849
 with the sequences I reached them 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.710
 then to put the voices in 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:31.750
 we are divided so they doing was 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.570
 beyond that by making programs here 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.770
 but I feel that they are in acapulco are 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.660
 in acapulco they went to do the 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.339
 sequences we are very excited 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.800
 because it's the biggest show we've ever 

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:44.489
 done is everything automated we have 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:47.170
 seven screens with engines that is if 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.839
 we throw the house this time how long 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.550
 they sat down to plan this new 

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:53.079
 look then we take in 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.579
 preproduction and teaching is very good 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:57.370
 shows and it has to be said in the 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:59.469
 screens and the way they did not know each other 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.839
 that is how I explain to them the people who do not 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:03.940
 I have seen them are standing on the 

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:07.870
 stage and suddenly they get in and we 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:09.640
 we convince the i's and also 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:11.380
 li ning is printing has to be 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.080
 perfect because if you do not see much if 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.180
 We've been around for a while now because every six 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.760
 months more or less we change of show and 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.200
 this is the show that you saw the most 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:24.040
 long we have done we have two months 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.600
 and I say two years and two months 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.240
 then it took a while you 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:31.720
 wanting to do this new show that 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.640
 called the matera tour but it's a lot 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.520
 logistics thing in terms of technology 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:39.310
 as for engine screens then 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.710
 and finally on March 28 in the square 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.650
 Countess we are going to premiere this new tour 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.990
 and that's why other cities go to 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.640
 visit or for today that we have paid 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.800
 the tour although in no time from 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.530
 about four years ago , and then I 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.180
 I think we're going with this we'll have to 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.760
 go everywhere to the potosÃ­ 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:00.160
 Acapulco Guerrero 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.870
 toluca that we always go and well the 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.510
 program goes incredibly well fat of 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:07.270
 hours the disc also the video 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:10.869
 we are very content launched us 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.570
 all because it is an unpublished subject as 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.050
 receives people because they are already 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.420
 accustomed 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:20.710
 the whole night listen to the songs and 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:23.200
 in this new and fresh theme also the 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:24.790
 truth is that for a total handsome 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.950
 because we had no idea how they were going to 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.720
 receive and with the luck that are the 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.360
 first places the video is on high 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.740
 rotation in video channels 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.050
 so we are very excited because 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:37.390
 It was the only thing that we really lacked 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.130
 so that people who did not have 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.020
 idea of who we are 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:44.530
 well I had an idea that we can also 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:46.780
 make original music and well done the 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.700
 they're going to continue with that line they're going 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.680
 to present more topics and we are going to 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:54.190
 present more unreleased tracks on the album 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:57.490
 matute live 2 and 4 but the idea is not 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.200
 leaving the 80 is null as it goes to 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:01.090
 do that is something that we leave for 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.970
 always but then there we will go today 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.080
 combining what little by little then the 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.150
 truth is that it has all the influence 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:10.030
 eighty also then if you hear it 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.190
 It's not like we're too crazy 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.680
 very happy very happy now the square 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:17.020
 Countess is a scenario loved by 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.690
 you very dear we carry two full 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.740
 totals there gauged different first 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.870
 we did it for 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:25.330
 hundred people did it for 1200 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.190
 now we have full house we are going to 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:31.220
 open to its maximum capacity to see what 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:33.380
 happens that they are in 1,800 people ok 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.840
 but we are happy, the 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.090
 sale and that the sale ya ya opened and already 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.070
 come on I think more than 50% capacity 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.960
 then it is a dream in the truth 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:44.360
 for us the people who already saw their 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:46.610
 show that is what you will be able to see 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.370
 new that is not all everything is 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.930
 completely connect car 9no in 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.730
 about music and things that we're going to 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.310
 let's not we can remove because to the 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:57.830
 People like to ask him as potpourri 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:00.710
 of ballads or tarzan I go now but 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:03.020
 visually each song has a 

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:05.510
 visual independent production in each 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.950
 pretty necessary song I think that 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.870
 for people who have been around for many years 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.570
 seeing new ones if you are going to take a 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:14.090
 surprise because we are putting him 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:16.370
 much care and a lot of love this new 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.739
 show now they bet on a show 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.870
 because normally, let's say they are 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:22.730
 you those who invest to the 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.860
 shows to see what happens not if 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:26.960
 this is has been in the line of matutes 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.910
 from the beginning we will invest more than 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:32.560
 we had 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:35.660
 clear then that's the line not to 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.460
 invest invest propose as to 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.190
 technology in terms of music 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:42.470
 to arrangements and now much more in the 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:44.510
 visual question but the truth is that what 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:46.760
 what we most enjoy doing and thanks to 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:48.590
 the live shows everything has happened 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:51.400
 has happened with matute there is no word of mouth 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:53.510
 we can not be very easy and already 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.370
 conform and say this show that 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:58.010
 we present works people like 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.660
 the chorea sings it but it does not stop 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:02.930
 we are also a necessity and a 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:04.220
 responsibility to be like advancing 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.980
 and bringing in new people 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:09.280
 arrange each new production then 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:11.000
 and also include new topics 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.620
 regardless of you have this 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.690
 exact is the most complicated there is 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.010
 so many new eighties themes to do 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:18.170
 Service 3 is always the best 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:21.500
 complicated already pay the paper think 

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:23.700
 on the stone to spend I think that 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:26.490
 we cover everything from the most rocky 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:30.060
 until the most then then the little mermaid 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:33.560
 you hear we have a and a fusion of 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:37.110
 opus of life is life with the little mermaid 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:39.810
 yes yes but the percussions are already 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:44.400
 let's put songs beyond 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:46.560
 cumbia that we do not see in the example how 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:49.230
 they are put as they agree on if 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.120
 you have to put it here or who is the 

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:54.330
 He is among all of us 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:56.790
 brainstorming in production always 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:06:00.690
 we brainstorm and as for 

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:03.180
 production already as such because it is the 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:05.910
 is responsible for landing the ideas but 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:08.340
 yes, because ideas can say thousands 

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:09.480
 but landing to throw everything is Jorge 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:11.730
 the one in charge the truth is that it is a 

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:14.430
 genius in that and he does very well then 

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:16.080
 we are risking, we have fun 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:18.090
 the rhythms of us and that I think the 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.920
 people appreciate it and enjoy it too 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:22.890
 how matute has changed throughout 

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:24.690
 these years how they felt at the beginning 

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:26.970
 how they feel now you know that 

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:27.780
 thank god he's still not looking for 20 

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:29.520
 nothing 

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:31.620
 it's a true blessing because 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:34.410
 then we go out just as I hope that in 

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:36.450
 the pocket yes good not to be left 

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:39.180
 imagine it would be very big 

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:40.560
 imagine not but we left the same 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:42.690
 excited and when we sang for 

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:44.910
 nine people clear then now by 

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:47.220
 example, they invited us to close the 

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:48.540
 Merida festival and they were 17,000 

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:51.720
 people watching and we said 

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:54.780
 when did we go from singing 9 to 

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:56.669
 sing in 17 thousand no but it has only 

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:58.770
 become more fun than that is the only thing 

00:06:56.669 --> 00:07:01.830
 that has changed more fun and a lot 

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:03.600
 more work oiled and more more let's say 

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:05.460
 more brotherhood among the there is not much 

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:07.530
 we got along incredibly well human 

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:09.690
 that really I said today that 

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:11.820
 anything without the secret to 

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:13.710
 now we get along incredibly well 

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:15.690
 on many fronts, that's why nothing else 

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:18.030
 finish inviting the public for this 

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:21.210
 renewed renewed expectation I do not know 

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:24.570

 information with the following videos
