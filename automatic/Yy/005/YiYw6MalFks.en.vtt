00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:04.620
 rico schmidt guest in the editorial 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.870
 the Offenbach post 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.680
 we have with the ofc trainer over the 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.680
 new season spoken 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:16.359
 simple color difficult to wander or 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:18.349
 again not 

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:21.050
 we have a good team for one 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:23.090
 strong team and we go already 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.110
 ambitious into the round well 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.970
 know that from the strong competition 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:29.629
 We are indeed considering the 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:32.360
 Approach of the season 2013 14 with the place 

00:00:29.629 --> 00:00:33.980
 eight with the 50 customers who are the 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.559
 team has worked with one 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:40.309
 strong second half with a strong 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:42.590
 defensive performance and also with one 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:45.260
 good offensive performance that was one more 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.270
 better then we go 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.060
 very ambitious in the round 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:53.320
 in and of course, too 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.320
 measured and let say 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.260
 the rag 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.460
 league south west has been known since 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.199
 years that he is a very strong 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:06.400
 regionalliga is strong with 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:08.690
 teams with economic 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.460
 Potentially equipped 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.500
 a lot of football is played 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:16.009
 different than now maybe in one 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:19.460
 other regionalliga and that is exactly 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:21.970
 to know but i have the 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:25.690
 impression also what I saw and 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.690
 the competition is strong 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.800
 the preparation of last year 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.430
 This year Axel is not too 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.770
 to compare 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.900
 last year or focus of focus 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:42.820
 Community within the shortest possible time 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:44.860
 time from 33 junior players what like 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.900
 Deep players then in competitive 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.300
 community to organize 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.790
 get excited and that's it 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:58.020
 This year has been structured differently 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:58.020
 the guys work is outstanding 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.079
 play with it always come for me one 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.360
 I 'm too slow 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.799
 The game has become enormously fast 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.200
 even in training 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.840
 except football tennis or even trust 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.550
 to keep up otherwise the 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.379
 game form was just too good the 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.830
 guys and that's all very fast 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:22.200
 then the risk of injury is also 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.030
 I see myself that way, too 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.709
 it is difficult then you want too 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.910
 win if win then win 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.799
 Zack is perhaps a muscle torn 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.390
 be up to the next 14 days 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:32.340
 That's not what I have to have 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:36.920
 just like that from the player trainer 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:40.860
 the trainer's training situation 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.090
 shifted and so I have the potential 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.590
 keep to myself 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:48.420
 so I do not wear that anymore and more 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.260
 in other things but now the 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.870
 soccer shoes 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:57.000
 So I would also grip the lawn 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:03:00.739
 but the lawn is wet and it is for 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.739
 to be with me
