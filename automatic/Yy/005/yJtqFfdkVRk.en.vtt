00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
just make sure well let's demonstrate if

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.830 
just make sure well let's demonstrate if
I<00:01:40.650> just<00:01:40.770> go<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:40.950> sign<00:01:41.520> up<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:41.820> I've<00:01:42.360> set<00:01:42.540> up<00:01:42.570> a

test email which in this case is test
well<00:01:45.840> I'll<00:01:45.930> demonstrate<00:01:46.140> with<00:01:46.439> test<00:01:46.710> tube's<00:01:47.009> I

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
well I'll demonstrate with test tube's I

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.039 
well I'll demonstrate with test tube's I
think<00:01:47.430> test<00:01:47.640> wise<00:01:47.820> already<00:01:48.119> subscribed<00:01:48.540> so<00:01:49.020> I

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
think test wise already subscribed so I
