road is too narrow if you're doing a

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.029 
road is too narrow if you're doing a
turn<00:00:17.539> in<00:00:17.660> the<00:00:17.720> road<00:00:17.840> and<00:00:18.470> it's<00:00:18.590> also<00:00:18.740> one<00:00:19.009> of

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:19.039 
turn in the road and it's also one of

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:20.830 
turn in the road and it's also one of
the<00:00:19.189> four<00:00:19.369> maneuvers<00:00:19.820> that<00:00:20.300> you<00:00:20.390> may<00:00:20.539> be<00:00:20.599> asked

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:22.099 
to do on the driving test

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:23.440 
to do on the driving test
now<00:00:22.369> I'm<00:00:22.430> going<00:00:22.579> to<00:00:22.610> show<00:00:22.759> you<00:00:22.789> how<00:00:23.000> to<00:00:23.029> do<00:00:23.300> it

them okay so go drive to the other side

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.100 
them okay so go drive to the other side
of<00:00:34.790> the<00:00:34.850> junction<00:00:35.030> be<00:00:35.420> prompt<00:00:35.750> so<00:00:35.960> I'm<00:00:36.020> gonna

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
of the junction be prompt so I'm gonna

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.080 
of the junction be prompt so I'm gonna
prepare<00:00:36.410> the<00:00:36.559> car<00:00:36.739> by<00:00:36.860> finding<00:00:37.129> the<00:00:37.250> bike<00:00:37.430> I'm

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.090 
prepare the car by finding the bike I'm

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:39.459 
prepare the car by finding the bike I'm
gonna<00:00:38.300> reserve<00:00:38.390> all<00:00:38.719> the<00:00:39.020> way<00:00:39.110> around<00:00:39.320> to<00:00:39.379> make

00:00:39.459 --> 00:00:39.469 
gonna reserve all the way around to make

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:41.290 
gonna reserve all the way around to make
sure<00:00:39.649> it's<00:00:39.800> safe<00:00:39.980> there's<00:00:40.640> no<00:00:40.760> one<00:00:40.879> to<00:00:40.969> signal

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
sure it's safe there's no one to signal

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.610 
sure it's safe there's no one to signal
to<00:00:41.450> so<00:00:41.600> I<00:00:41.660> can<00:00:41.810> just<00:00:41.990> move<00:00:42.110> across<00:00:42.440> the

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
to so I can just move across the

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.160 
to so I can just move across the
junction<00:00:42.829> now<00:00:43.210> now<00:00:44.210> as<00:00:44.360> I<00:00:44.480> Drive<00:00:44.690> across<00:00:44.930> it's

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
junction now now as I Drive across it's

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:46.930 
junction now now as I Drive across it's
important<00:00:45.590> to<00:00:45.650> look<00:00:45.770> into<00:00:45.890> the<00:00:46.160> road<00:00:46.340> to<00:00:46.820> make

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
important to look into the road to make

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.190 
important to look into the road to make
sure<00:00:47.060> there's<00:00:47.210> no<00:00:47.300> hazards<00:00:47.720> so<00:00:47.780> it's<00:00:47.989> not<00:00:48.079> me

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:48.200 
sure there's no hazards so it's not me

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.960 
sure there's no hazards so it's not me
doing<00:00:48.350> the<00:00:48.440> manoeuvre<00:00:48.680> but<00:00:49.250> also<00:00:49.430> to<00:00:49.610> assess

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:49.970 
doing the manoeuvre but also to assess

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:51.790 
doing the manoeuvre but also to assess
the<00:00:50.120> shape<00:00:50.300> of<00:00:50.450> the<00:00:50.600> corner<00:00:50.900> now<00:00:51.320> putting<00:00:51.650> over

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
left mirror there's no one to a signal t

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.370 
left mirror there's no one to a signal t
I'm<00:00:56.030> going<00:00:56.180> to<00:00:56.270> talk<00:00:56.360> about<00:00:56.480> drain<00:00:56.930> to<00:00:57.110> it<00:00:57.200> away

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:57.380 
I'm going to talk about drain to it away

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:58.630 
I'm going to talk about drain to it away
from<00:00:57.500> the<00:00:57.649> curb<00:00:57.829> gives<00:00:58.130> me<00:00:58.190> a<00:00:58.250> little<00:00:58.370> bit<00:00:58.489> of

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
from the curb gives me a little bit of

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.100 
from the curb gives me a little bit of
room<00:00:58.760> to<00:00:58.910> maneuver<00:00:59.000> and<00:00:59.450> a<00:00:59.600> couple<00:00:59.810> of<00:00:59.960> card

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:00.110 
room to maneuver and a couple of card

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.359

the<00:01:07.909> bike<00:01:08.060> because<00:01:08.210> it's<00:01:08.450> downhill<00:01:08.899> I<00:01:09.110> do<00:01:09.590> my

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
the bike because it's downhill I do my

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.830 
the bike because it's downhill I do my
observations<00:01:10.250> in<00:01:10.369> Reverse<00:01:10.759> so<00:01:11.390> you<00:01:11.479> end<00:01:11.719> up

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.510 
observations in Reverse so you end up
looking<00:01:12.110> out<00:01:12.229> the<00:01:12.320> back<00:01:12.469> window<00:01:12.649> and<00:01:13.430> I'm

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
around me just to see if there any

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.040 
around me just to see if there any
hazards<00:01:24.400> that<00:01:24.490> might<00:01:24.610> affect<00:01:24.970> me<00:01:25.150> when<00:01:25.810> I<00:01:25.840> get

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.050 
hazards that might affect me when I get

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.290 
hazards that might affect me when I get
to<00:01:26.140> the<00:01:26.260> turning<00:01:26.650> point<00:01:26.860> which<00:01:27.400> is<00:01:27.550> about<00:01:27.820> now

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:28.300 
to the turning point which is about now

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.210 
to the turning point which is about now
I'm<00:01:28.479> gonna<00:01:28.659> check<00:01:28.840> my<00:01:28.990> right<00:01:29.170> shoulder<00:01:29.409> and<00:01:30.159> I

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
I'm gonna check my right shoulder and I

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.960 
I'm gonna check my right shoulder and I
can<00:01:30.340> do<00:01:30.430> half<00:01:30.729> a<00:01:30.880> turn<00:01:31.090> to<00:01:31.240> the<00:01:31.360> left

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
can do half a turn to the left

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.580 
can do half a turn to the left
now<00:01:33.970> the<00:01:34.030> gaps<00:01:34.360> getting<00:01:34.690> smaller<00:01:35.020> already<00:01:35.440> so

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
I can tell that by looking at the back

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
couple of mistakes that sometimes happen

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.100 
couple of mistakes that sometimes happen
when<00:02:36.970> people<00:02:37.000> reverse<00:02:37.570> around<00:02:37.780> the<00:02:37.840> corner

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
when people reverse around the corner

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.530 
when people reverse around the corner
the<00:02:38.620> first<00:02:38.860> one<00:02:39.130> is<00:02:39.340> if<00:02:39.700> the<00:02:39.820> car<00:02:40.030> gets<00:02:40.269> too

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
the first one is if the car gets too

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
through how to get away again okay so

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:46.800 
through how to get away again okay so
I'm<00:02:45.640> going<00:02:45.790> to<00:02:45.850> be<00:02:45.910> prompt<00:02:46.150> to<00:02:46.269> go<00:02:46.390> backwards

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
I'm going to be prompt to go backwards

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.860 
I'm going to be prompt to go backwards
so<00:02:47.769> you're<00:02:47.950> gonna<00:02:48.190> find<00:02:48.459> the<00:02:48.610> by<00:02:48.870> observations

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
so you're gonna find the by observations

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.060 
so you're gonna find the by observations
in<00:02:50.019> Reverse<00:02:50.320> because<00:02:50.560> we're<00:02:50.709> going<00:02:50.829> backwards

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
in Reverse because we're going backwards

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:56.020 
in Reverse because we're going backwards
and<00:02:51.910> then<00:02:52.269> slowly<00:02:52.720> going<00:02:53.260> backwards

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.730

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:57.740 
now just looking for my turning point

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.470 
now just looking for my turning point
I'm<00:02:58.070> nearly<00:02:58.340> there<00:02:58.460> so<00:02:58.760> gonna<00:02:58.910> check<00:02:59.090> my<00:02:59.210> right

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
I'm nearly there so gonna check my right

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.100 
I'm nearly there so gonna check my right
shoulder<00:02:59.750> and<00:03:00.140> then<00:03:00.680> half<00:03:00.890> turn<00:03:01.220> to<00:03:01.400> the<00:03:01.520> left

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
shoulder and then half turn to the left

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.540 
shoulder and then half turn to the left
now<00:03:03.110> as<00:03:03.230> I<00:03:03.320> come<00:03:03.440> around<00:03:03.620> this<00:03:03.830> corner<00:03:04.130> I'm

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
now as I come around this corner I'm

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.430 
now as I come around this corner I'm
gonna<00:03:04.700> let<00:03:04.880> the<00:03:04.970> car<00:03:05.120> get<00:03:05.270> a<00:03:05.300> bit<00:03:05.510> close<00:03:05.750> as<00:03:06.020> you

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
gonna let the car get a bit close as you

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.710 
gonna let the car get a bit close as you
can<00:03:06.560> see<00:03:06.800> in<00:03:06.950> the<00:03:07.100> little<00:03:08.030> clip<00:03:08.210> of<00:03:08.240> the<00:03:08.480> kerb

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
can see in the little clip of the kerb

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.960 
can see in the little clip of the kerb
now<00:03:09.710> it's<00:03:09.890> getting<00:03:10.070> really<00:03:10.370> close<00:03:10.550> now<00:03:10.760> so<00:03:10.790> the

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
now it's getting really close now so the

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.550 
now it's getting really close now so the
best<00:03:11.150> thing<00:03:11.360> to<00:03:11.390> do<00:03:11.660> is<00:03:11.750> just<00:03:11.900> completely

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
best thing to do is just completely

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.600 
best thing to do is just completely
straighten<00:03:12.860> your<00:03:12.920> wheels<00:03:13.070> up<00:03:13.190> at<00:03:13.310> this<00:03:13.400> point

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
straighten your wheels up at this point

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.970 
straighten your wheels up at this point
keep<00:03:14.120> whilst<00:03:14.630> keep<00:03:14.840> looking<00:03:15.080> everywhere<00:03:15.320> when

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
keep whilst keep looking everywhere when

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.620 
keep whilst keep looking everywhere when
it<00:03:16.070> starts<00:03:16.310> getting<00:03:16.400> bigger<00:03:16.640> again<00:03:16.910> just<00:03:17.540> go

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
it starts getting bigger again just go

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.560 
it starts getting bigger again just go
back<00:03:17.840> to<00:03:17.990> half<00:03:18.200> a<00:03:18.290> turn<00:03:18.470> as<00:03:18.970> you<00:03:19.970> can<00:03:20.150> see<00:03:20.360> from

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
back to half a turn as you can see from

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.770 
back to half a turn as you can see from
the<00:03:20.690> video<00:03:20.780> clip<00:03:20.990> of<00:03:21.380> the<00:03:21.680> curve<00:03:21.950> gap<00:03:22.510> it's<00:03:23.510> fix

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
the video clip of the curve gap it's fix

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.840 
the video clip of the curve gap it's fix
the<00:03:23.900> gap<00:03:24.020> quite<00:03:24.230> nicely<00:03:24.470> and<00:03:25.400> we're<00:03:25.610> back<00:03:25.730> to

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
the gap quite nicely and we're back to

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.360 
the gap quite nicely and we're back to
where<00:03:25.970> we<00:03:26.030> were<00:03:26.890> keeping<00:03:27.890> an<00:03:27.950> eye<00:03:27.980> out<00:03:28.190> all

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
where we were keeping an eye out all

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:35.620 
where we were keeping an eye out all
around<00:03:28.700> me<00:03:29.170> keeping<00:03:30.170> the<00:03:30.230> car<00:03:30.410> nice<00:03:30.590> and<00:03:30.650> slow

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.990 

warmish<00:03:36.410> at<00:03:36.560> the<00:03:36.650> strait<00:03:36.860> bit<00:03:37.040> now<00:03:37.160> so<00:03:37.400> I'm

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
warmish at the strait bit now so I'm

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.460 
warmish at the strait bit now so I'm
gonna<00:03:38.150> straighten<00:03:38.510> my<00:03:38.720> wheels<00:03:39.020> and<00:03:39.230> then

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
gonna straighten my wheels and then

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:40.660 
gonna straighten my wheels and then
follow<00:03:39.710> the<00:03:39.860> curve<00:03:40.040> back<00:03:40.220> a<00:03:40.250> couple<00:03:40.490> of

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
follow the curve back a couple of

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:42.280 
follow the curve back a couple of
columns<00:03:40.940> so<00:03:41.630> we're<00:03:41.780> not<00:03:41.870> blocking<00:03:42.080> the

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
columns so we're not blocking the

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.760 
columns so we're not blocking the
junction<00:03:43.930> okay<00:03:44.930> with<00:03:45.110> this<00:03:45.260> clip<00:03:45.590> I'm<00:03:45.740> going

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:45.770 
junction okay with this clip I'm going

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:48.250 
junction okay with this clip I'm going
to<00:03:45.980> show<00:03:46.040> you<00:03:46.220> how<00:03:46.490> to<00:03:46.520> deal<00:03:47.000> with<00:03:47.360> the<00:03:47.900> gap<00:03:48.080> if

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
to show you how to deal with the gap if

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.590 
to show you how to deal with the gap if
it<00:03:48.380> gets<00:03:48.590> a<00:03:48.680> bit<00:03:48.860> too<00:03:49.100> big<00:03:49.370> okay<00:03:50.090> so<00:03:50.390> I'm<00:03:50.510> going

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:50.600 
it gets a bit too big okay so I'm going

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.190 
it gets a bit too big okay so I'm going
to<00:03:50.690> be<00:03:50.750> pond<00:03:51.050> to<00:03:51.200> go<00:03:51.320> backwards<00:03:53.080> you're<00:03:54.080> gonna

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
to be pond to go backwards you're gonna

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.890 
to be pond to go backwards you're gonna
find<00:03:54.530> it<00:03:54.770> by<00:03:54.920> look<00:03:55.430> all<00:03:55.580> the<00:03:55.790> way<00:03:55.940> around<00:03:56.210> in

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:04.570 
looking for my turning reference point

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.210 
looking for my turning reference point
keeping<00:04:05.570> an<00:04:05.690> eye<00:04:05.780> on<00:04:05.810> all<00:04:06.050> around<00:04:06.170> now<00:04:07.070> we're

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
I'm just going to take a quarter turn

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.479 
I'm just going to take a quarter turn
off<00:04:14.210> like<00:04:14.390> normal<00:04:14.980> now<00:04:15.980> I'm<00:04:16.040> just<00:04:16.160> gonna<00:04:16.250> let

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
off like normal now I'm just gonna let

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:17.860 
off like normal now I'm just gonna let
the<00:04:16.580> cap<00:04:16.730> get<00:04:16.880> a<00:04:16.910> little<00:04:17.300> bit<00:04:17.420> big<00:04:17.570> and<00:04:17.780> then

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
the cap get a little bit big and then

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.100 
the cap get a little bit big and then
show<00:04:18.050> you<00:04:18.140> how<00:04:18.200> to<00:04:18.320> deal<00:04:18.560> with<00:04:18.590> it<00:04:20.050> okay<00:04:21.050> so

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.410 
the best thing to do is put a whole turn

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.940 
the best thing to do is put a whole turn
on<00:04:24.590> and<00:04:25.010> count<00:04:25.280> to<00:04:25.430> three<00:04:25.700> two<00:04:25.940> one<00:04:26.210> two<00:04:27.080> three

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
on and count to three two one two three

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:30.250 
on and count to three two one two three
and<00:04:28.340> then<00:04:28.550> take<00:04:28.820> that<00:04:29.000> back<00:04:29.600> to<00:04:29.780> half<00:04:29.960> a<00:04:30.050> turn

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260 
and then take that back to half a turn

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.010 
and then take that back to half a turn
and<00:04:30.470> you<00:04:30.800> should<00:04:30.980> be<00:04:31.100> back<00:04:31.250> to<00:04:31.280> normal<00:04:31.430> now

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
and you should be back to normal now

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.630 
and you should be back to normal now
keeping<00:04:33.020> laia<00:04:33.170> all<00:04:33.470> around<00:04:33.800> the<00:04:34.370> gaps<00:04:34.550> still

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:34.640 
keeping laia all around the gaps still

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:35.860 
keeping laia all around the gaps still
getting<00:04:34.880> slightly<00:04:35.240> smaller<00:04:35.510> so<00:04:35.690> I'll<00:04:35.750> take

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
getting slightly smaller so I'll take

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.990 
getting slightly smaller so I'll take
the<00:04:36.020> quarter<00:04:36.260> off<00:04:36.380> just<00:04:36.560> as<00:04:36.680> normal<00:04:37.010> and<00:04:37.910> we

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
the quarter off just as normal and we

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.250 
the quarter off just as normal and we
just<00:04:38.180> back<00:04:38.330> to<00:04:38.450> where<00:04:38.570> we<00:04:38.720> were<00:04:38.750> when<00:04:39.050> it<00:04:39.080> was

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
just back to where we were when it was

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.970 
just back to where we were when it was
going<00:04:39.530> well<00:04:41.380> well<00:04:42.380> you've<00:04:42.500> got<00:04:42.620> to<00:04:42.710> be<00:04:42.770> careful

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:42.980 
going well well you've got to be careful

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:45.010 
going well well you've got to be careful
I'll<00:04:43.220> be<00:04:43.310> putting<00:04:43.580> too<00:04:43.700> much<00:04:43.850> steering<00:04:44.210> on<00:04:44.360> is

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
I'll be putting too much steering on is

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.630 
I'll be putting too much steering on is
it<00:04:45.200> does<00:04:45.380> make<00:04:45.650> the<00:04:45.770> car<00:04:45.920> coming<00:04:46.220> on<00:04:46.340> really

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:46.640 
it does make the car coming on really

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:47.980 
it does make the car coming on really
quickly<00:04:47.000> it's<00:04:47.210> the<00:04:47.270> same<00:04:47.450> as<00:04:47.600> if<00:04:47.720> you're<00:04:47.840> going

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 
quickly it's the same as if you're going

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.080 
quickly it's the same as if you're going
closer<00:04:48.320> you<00:04:49.010> take<00:04:49.190> too<00:04:49.370> much<00:04:49.400> steering<00:04:49.850> off<00:04:49.970> it

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
closer you take too much steering off it

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:51.280 
closer you take too much steering off it
will<00:04:50.210> go<00:04:50.300> away<00:04:50.450> very<00:04:50.480> quickly

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:51.290 
will go away very quickly

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:53.890 
will go away very quickly
if<00:04:51.770> you<00:04:51.860> just<00:04:52.010> count<00:04:52.310> to<00:04:52.550> three<00:04:52.820> like<00:04:53.090> one<00:04:53.330> two

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
if you just count to three like one two

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.230 
if you just count to three like one two
three<00:04:54.380> and<00:04:54.590> then<00:04:55.130> go<00:04:55.190> back<00:04:55.550> to<00:04:55.580> half<00:04:55.970> a<00:04:56.060> turn

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
three and then go back to half a turn

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.120 
three and then go back to half a turn
that<00:04:57.050> would<00:04:57.200> normally<00:04:57.530> put<00:04:57.650> you<00:04:57.770> back<00:04:57.950> in

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.130 
that would normally put you back in

that would normally put you back in
