00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.850
 Cat name is a bath British breed 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.490
 shorthair age nine with 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.200
 half years he is plush by definition 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.330
 under and plush character absolutely 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.460
 calm and balanced and that is 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.590
 wonderful very kind looking age 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.529
 already makes itself felt 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.539
 scaling or 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.130
 respectively, now the gum disease 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.660
 and went bad breath 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:30.240
 periodically we used special 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.730
 pastes that are applied to the teeth and so 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.550
 tartar dissolves 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.770
 the result was alleviated all this well 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.050
 basically for his age funny 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.149
 fairly good condition but all 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.710
 Equally, the principle I decided after all 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.270
 and finally clean them 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:55.199
 supports simple already in good 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:57.210
 health condition all cats are small 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.930
 were giving it like this 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.870
 a hefty code that le ping and 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.690
 tells what happened I tell 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.660
 age 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:11.020
 I sell we have not a pleasant smell from the mouth 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:16.570
 us dirty ugly soups 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:29.680
 You tried to type aggressive posts 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:33.580
 we use everything just very strongly 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:36.660
 Respect where the songs of years have passed 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:40.510
 it is natural to clean such a stone 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:43.480
 on the shy here you almost no 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:44.740
 release we experience we worry and how 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.900
 it 's all going to happen 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:52.900
 it will happen here is special 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:54.910
 sound skeleton that just never 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.610
 whom I am not the actual cuttings of law and 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:02:03.240
 Of course, what is she good at? 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:07.870
 injured between you there are such 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:11.290
 problems with plaque a lot of them 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:14.020
 almost all of them lead well what have 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.330
 animal teeth go missing they start 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.610
 stagger they fall animal remain 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.970
 generally without teeth is a disaster for 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:24.940
 most of our patients what are 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:28.120
 methods methods are actually three 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:31.680
 the main first is the chemical method 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.920
 special gels smear tsana teeth 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.290
 amazed 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.060
 stones these little stones quietly 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.500
 after the dissolve dissolve 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:42.850
 dissolve this process is long and 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.959
 takes a very long time host 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:49.420
 the second method is mechanical purification 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:52.270
 there is a concept with keller is this 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.560
 small paddle with handle 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:57.730
 whose doctor 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:03:00.550
 mechanically removes these dental deposits 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.769
 3 most but I think today 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.340
 day the best there is no tooth removal 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:07.030
 stone 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:10.720
 This is an ultrasonic scaler that is when 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:13.739
 ultrasound aid and water supply 1 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:17.860
 killing stones that overlap 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:19.200
 teeth than the last method is good yet 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.090
 what 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.549
 scratching tooth enamel which is always 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:28.860
 present during mechanical cleansing 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:31.750
 these deposits are practically excluded 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:35.020
 processing immediately washing it 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:37.750
 plot of water and more 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:40.540
 let's say if you do everything right then water 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.290
 add some antiseptics allows 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.830
 reduce 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:59.280
 complications reduce swelling reduce 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:04:13.420
 inflammation after manipulative ran down 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:16.209
 hurt a visit on the foot is a place arrow 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:19.930
 inside it needs to be opened and home and 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:22.750
 just take off the future what you do 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:25.630
 there there clean teeth thread 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:27.640
 appropriately tough enough 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:30.460
 pocket does not forget there to some water 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:32.290
 It was not all multi continue on 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.620
 so do then meet he lost 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.940
 occasion or me often 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:39.000
 anyway training time there 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.300
 browse because if you already have fabrics 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:47.590
 deposited something better than them 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:49.789
 broker procedure went well 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:52.759
 normal condition worried about 

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:54.099
 anesthesia year brought it superbly exactly 

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:56.479
 this cleaning method 

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:58.430
 ultrasonic cleaning it is in principle 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:00.080
 by itself implies the absence of 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:03.139
 further some more difficult not 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:06.470
 inflammation of all such therefore in 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:08.180
 Generally care normal standard code 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.780
 will live on full life like 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.780
 drawing it
