00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.410
 hey people everyday and eat spector 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.629
 we do that weekly gaming in tech news 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.740
 and this week I'm going a little different 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.000
 to tackle 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.250
 First of all, I just go a little more 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.170
 all the news items discuss that so 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.059
 you just get more information in one 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.070
 get a shorter time 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.050
 and secondly I'm going to have some fun 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.789
 infographics use in the image 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.289
 so I hope you enjoy it 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.800
 and then we just go from it 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.130
 Start 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.170
 the rumors go that the xbox one is fixed 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.060
 in the third quarter of 2014 in the Netherlands 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.840
 goes out the test is long 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.690
 of course since a few weeks 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.340
 Available in America in England 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.680
 Germany and France in such 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.329
 only a few months ago 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.469
 Microsoft already announced the Xbox 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.719
 one 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.059
 only in 2014 would come true 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:48.090
 The Netherlands and the rumor went that way 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.039
 around March April would be go alone now 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.559
 there are rumors again that it is only in the 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.600
 third quarter of 2014 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.239
 an anonymous source of game projector 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.070
 knows names and he doesn't have to 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.420
 all that source of their that was exactly 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.329
 same source 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.189
 whoever said I asked did not arrive until 2014 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.890
 the netherlands would come true so it is 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.360
 a pretty reliable source of microsoft 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.310
 of course it doesn't have it yet 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.280
 officially responded to and not before 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.200
 the show, by the way, so it's still mostly 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.869
 equally unclear at the moment when the x 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.060
 for coming out 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.189
 they say the i dug from then 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.130
 probably only after the summer 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:28.380
 come true and August or September because 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.340
 game computers or game consoles that 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.049
 are never in the summer months 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.450
 released because it is also pretty cunt 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.130
 time because everyone is through a vacation 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.869
 and why would you use a game console 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.880
 are going to purchase 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.340
 so the rumor go August or 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.229
 September that I was going to come true 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.700
 Annelies is about the Playstation 4 that is 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.590
 of course available for a while 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.200
 the Netherlands and also in America 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.299
 and you can go via the playstation 4 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.180
 live streaming the switch that is four to 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.219
 new function and apparently there is 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.630
 made very much use of that 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.430
 possibility to stream live via the 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.710
 your playstation 4 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.960
 Sony has announced that 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.600
 there on the playstation 4 in total for 20 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.939
 million 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:10.479
 the gameplay is deceived friend and that 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:12.730
 20 million minutes that are through 800,000 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.680
 then did not broadcast the comics and to 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.230
 those 800,000 unique streams 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:20.050
 have a total of seven comma seven comma 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:23.280
 1 million people watched and twixt 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:26.230
 also let that know 10 percent of all 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.069
 broadcast content on troy since 15 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.709
 November 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:31.660
 from the playstation 4 and ustream 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:33.940
 reports that a string 4 playstation 4 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.620
 takes an average of 31 minutes 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.300
 and that is of course mainly due to this 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.700
 the share button that is on the playstation 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.319
 4 controller is what makes you just whole 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.150
 easily into live streaming videos 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:45.010
 record make screenshots to share 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.680
 know twitter with your friends on facebook 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.450
 I the what and yes that tear button that 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.800
 appears to work if we do this 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.720
 statistics may believe what 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.459
 of course so is a game true 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.680
 of course very many people look forward to it 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.060
 2014 is destiny 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.590
 this game makes it come true for the 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.360
 playstation 4 xbox for a playstation 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.230
 3 and xbox 360 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.049
 he probably also goes for the 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:07.150
 come and bungee computer or the 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:08.080
 developer of destiny and also of the 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.440
 whole series 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.090
 that he will come out on September 9 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:16.480
 2014 for the playstation 4 xbox one 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.730
 playstation 3 and xbox 360 and they already 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.470
 announced the beta of the game in 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.930
 the beginning of the summer would come true 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.280
 on playstation 3 and playstation 4 and 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.799
 then the name for a while because he is 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.220
 temporarily exactly for playstation 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:28.299
 platforms 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.600
 then of course there is also the 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:33.790
 xbox 360 and xbox one out and a nice it 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.040
 now about just cause 2 the game 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:39.250
 gets a multiplayer motty's 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.989
 December 16 comes to steam and the game 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.540
 is pretty old for people who 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:45.519
 don't know it's an open world game 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.530
 really just a bit like gta and 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:48.940
 CEO where you want to be able to go here 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.190
 cutten of course this is a story and 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.530
 all alone the game had none 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.209
 multiplayer and the multiplayer is coming now 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.530
 through a god and that is 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:58.660
 very fat of course 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.299
 this just shows again what for 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.560
 can do good moss for games 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:05.470
 screen is of course also a very good one 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.329
 example of and it's a shame that games 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.400
 nowadays so little moth support 

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:11.680
 because it can really just be a whole 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.359
 very big addition to the game and 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.650
 now and again it appears 

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:16.489
 latest news monitors have go 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.229
 is battlefield 4 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:20.449
 everyone of course knows the game with 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:22.490
 incredible difficulties hand very 

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:25.340
 a lot of crèches I know a lot of burks 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:26.900
 example everything and some doctors and each 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.610
 there we announced the 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:32.690
 battlefield 4 extensions 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:34.940
 suspended until all issues regarding 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.500
 many views have been resolved 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.000
 seeing rua had of course come true 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.590
 it is for 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.500
 were much good come from their past 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.729
 they can now play it as a single player 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.889
 the others already like content 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:48.199
 second assault that have been delayed 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:49.400
 due to persistent problems with 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:50.810
 battlefield 4 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.569
 and this is just a good thing because really 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:55.970
 the game is just sometimes very cunt 

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:58.340
 to play because you are constantly disconnected 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:00.169
 becomes cline crèches so I know what 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.120
 as far as I'm concerned , it's good at slaats 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:03.800
 first game but just fix it completely 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.020
 by actually pressing the game 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.000
 a super well playable house not good 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.770
 but is super playable 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.319
 and then that expansion can come and 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:13.430
 then we can really enjoy it to the full 

00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:15.319
 way of people this was gaming 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:16.490
 tech news for this week I hope so 

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:18.440

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.330
 otherwise it is nothing 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.190
 news in it and those nice infographics 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.330
 liked turkey and so did you
