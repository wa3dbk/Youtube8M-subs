hadn't have called us out the

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.180 
hadn't have called us out the
consequences<00:00:39.239> could<00:00:39.809> have<00:00:39.870> been<00:00:39.989> series<00:00:40.590> just

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
consequences could have been series just

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.130 
consequences could have been series just
like<00:00:41.280> Coronation<00:00:42.090> Street<00:00:42.239> was<00:00:42.480> showing<00:00:42.899> very

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
like Coronation Street was showing very

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.170 
like Coronation Street was showing very
recently

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:46.180 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.400 

well<00:00:47.180> ambidextrous<00:00:49.660> changing<00:00:50.660> a<00:00:50.720> diverse<00:00:51.170> of

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
well ambidextrous changing a diverse of

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:57.100 
well ambidextrous changing a diverse of
all<00:00:51.820> on<00:00:52.820> a<00:00:52.880> valency<00:00:53.480> Kotak<00:00:54.550> well<00:00:55.550> so<00:00:56.110> these

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.110 
all on a valency Kotak well so these

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.799 
all on a valency Kotak well so these
exchange<00:00:57.680> yet<00:00:57.950> was<00:00:58.130> warped<00:00:58.580> the<00:00:59.360> places

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
exchange yet was warped the places

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:03.420 
exchange yet was warped the places
walked<00:01:00.280> so<00:01:01.280> we're<00:01:01.430> changing<00:01:01.670> none<00:01:02.000> as<00:01:02.150> well

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430 
walked so we're changing none as well

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.240 
walked so we're changing none as well
there<00:01:04.430> it<00:01:04.550> says<00:01:04.760> if<00:01:05.660> I<00:01:06.350> walk<00:01:06.560> to<00:01:06.770> this<00:01:06.890> just

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
there it says if I walk to this just

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:15.420 
there it says if I walk to this just
found<00:01:07.430> out<00:01:07.580> ed<00:01:07.729> today<00:01:08.979> seals<00:01:09.979> gone

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:22.560 

let's<00:01:16.390> get<00:01:16.540> a<00:01:16.600> new<00:01:16.750> place<00:01:16.960> to<00:01:20.910> engineer<00:01:21.910> the

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
let's get a new place to engineer the

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.150 
let's get a new place to engineer the
plates<00:01:22.870> on<00:01:23.080> the<00:01:23.170> Front's<00:01:23.500> of<00:01:23.590> the<00:01:23.650> air<00:01:23.920> the

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.160 
plates on the Front's of the air the

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.810 
plates on the Front's of the air the
heat<00:01:24.310> exchanger<00:01:25.000> which<00:01:25.510> is<00:01:25.720> warped<00:01:26.670> suits<00:01:27.670> are

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 
heat exchanger which is warped suits are

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.280 
heat exchanger which is warped suits are
not<00:01:27.850> being<00:01:28.120> put<00:01:28.330> on<00:01:28.450> properly

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290 
not being put on properly

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.180 
not being put on properly
as<00:01:29.650> you<00:01:30.340> can<00:01:30.490> actually<00:01:30.640> see<00:01:30.910> here<00:01:32.190> it's

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.190 
as you can actually see here it's

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.520 
as you can actually see here it's
actually<00:01:33.520> warm<00:01:33.820> there<00:01:34.300> so<00:01:35.050> we're<00:01:35.290> changing

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
actually warm there so we're changing

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.250 
actually warm there so we're changing
that<00:01:35.890> we've<00:01:36.610> got<00:01:36.760> the<00:01:36.880> full<00:01:37.090> kit<00:01:37.420> we're

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:38.260 
that we've got the full kit we're

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:46.530 
that we've got the full kit we're
cleaning<00:01:38.500> it<00:01:38.800> up<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:44.530> then<00:01:45.540> reassembling

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:46.540 
cleaning it up and then reassembling

00:01:46.540 --> 00:02:35.520 
cleaning it up and then reassembling

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
seals back here with them in what songs

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:03.069 
seals back here with them in what songs
here<00:04:01.519> yes

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:03.079 
here yes

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
have now reassemble it and put it back

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.339 
have now reassemble it and put it back
on<00:04:31.930> the<00:04:32.139> boiler<00:04:32.500> and<00:04:33.340> now<00:04:33.490> we're<00:04:33.699> doing<00:04:34.349> these

00:04:35.339 --> 00:04:35.349 
on the boiler and now we're doing these

00:04:35.349 --> 00:04:38.850 
on the boiler and now we're doing these
now<00:04:35.699> we've<00:04:36.699> got<00:04:36.879> some<00:04:37.060> allies<00:04:37.389> in<00:04:38.289> the<00:04:38.440> carbon
