00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:08.389
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:12.059
 video on my desk and on minecraft 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:14.400
 so it's not bad it's very good 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.340
 what am I going to do to you because in 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.880
 did it before there were kits 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.529
 point fr is finally here it is for 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.350
 you see to have a lot of people 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.650
 brings together a lot of people full of fashion 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.689
 to group at the same time and hafid the 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.870
 path daughter of patrick I confuse 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:37.710
 with afp 1 there are two lists that is 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.690
 released and for cracked versions there 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.230
 had no way to see her in 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:48.570
 practical and well figure you that if and 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:51.149
 here there is for cracked version and then 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.860
 so if you are see me I loved the 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:57.120
 craft sp1 look when I reopen 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.129
 and I will show you how 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.430
 install track girl in version 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.530
 crack so first of all you go on 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.290
 wii you do windows r to go on 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.990
 a grandpa data monpoint minecraft I'm going 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:14.400
 delete it all because to make 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:20.189
 the tutorial there had been to delete so 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:24.180
 here is voila you open minecraft 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:26.869
 sp for the purpose of putting my name in 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.070
 faking the passport of no need 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:32.210
 people 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.210
 so here it is 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.080
 there it embarrassed in the thing that m 30 years 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.250
 so here I am going to put it fast forward 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.250
 I think 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:22.050
 and well everyone's good 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:25.020
 after this little acceleration that has 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:27.210
 not last long so I think so how 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.160
 you have to know how to marry 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.890
 the time it is now and that's it 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.390
 of theirs that they had before and you 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.810
 will be the time it taught me he 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.970
 So here this time we will the 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.540
 see if the folder was created on the 1st 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.880
 graph 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.770
 so it's good all and everything is in 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:48.110
 you remember to thaler I had everything 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:51.480
 delete so it's simple archi 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:54.240
 so on a link but there mediafire I 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:58.950
 will you put these two island packs 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:02.520
 easter so has it the first pack 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:06.320
 actually it's going to serve you go see at 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:09.690
 what would it serve so you open it 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:12.930
 you go on here you click you 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:16.110
 go on minecraft you open it so 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:18.330
 it's very followed follow me really 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:21.870
 like I do what otherwise it risks 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:24.360
 to make everything bugger all that is so 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:27.410
 you take all the kiala files and 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.410
 you put them here 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:35.970
 here you replace all high 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:47.580
 and that's apparently it's good then 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:50.440
 now you go on on guines 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:54.700
 for minecraft you open it with winrar 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:57.340
 we say we're not unruly but you 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:01.480
 as a plus it is removed by default 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:04.360
 with this pack so here you are there so 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.730
 you put no malgras forges who will 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:09.670
 the impact of course there will be no mode 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.410
 so I advise you m otherwise 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.130
 is completely useless 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.130
 movie the beast 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:19.900
 so here is hop all class files 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:23.980
 put them in there with finally trifi 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:27.090
 it's what's it going it's okay 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.090
 pretty fast as you see 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:35.800
 so that will be with the small fine 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:38.290
 my thing 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:45.090
 so here we are also going to install at 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:45.090
 little fine and hop 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:53.450
 this is actually like that after one time 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:54.860
 this is closing all there is more 

00:04:53.450 --> 00:05:00.430
 need nothing where you open your 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:05:00.430
 thousand leaflets sp and magically 

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:11.930
 smart the minecraft ftb version 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:13.310
 cracked anyway so if that's worth it 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:17.870
 not a shot a little inch to what 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:20.450
 this is where it might forget 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:22.390
 a little love minecraft that does not respond 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:27.110
 because there is so much fashion 

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:27.440
 wait i'll make you see ah ben 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:32.000
 here 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:37.190
 you see my 37 fashion law dead 37 fashion 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:39.620
 active so here again look if I 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:42.610
 does not create a map first at least quickly 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.610
 put in France is quickly done 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:51.119
 french french soul 

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:53.639
 this is how I'm hoping to find you 

00:05:51.119 --> 00:05:56.399
 after 30 seconds and well re all the 

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:59.819
 world so here I quickly generated 

00:05:56.399 --> 00:06:02.189
 a world because actually a little 

00:05:59.819 --> 00:06:03.630
 cut because we were in the process of 

00:06:02.189 --> 00:06:07.550
 call me 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:09.960
 so we're going to get into this world 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:11.710
 so I did a little construction a 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:17.860
 do what 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:23.670
 in two minutes even more my panel 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:27.930
 solar and the same plus 2 to 6 

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:30.630
 yeah well, that's good, the tuque actually 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:33.540
 actually look at if I look for you 

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:34.920
 these of the ermine wrongly so I do not know 

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:36.810
 not at all how it because Kraft 

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:38.900
 that I then put myself anti 

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:42.960
 cheat mode 

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:46.290
 so if you want some tutorial on ftb ben 

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:48.900
 tell me not a private message where we 

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:53.430
 was talking about comments or it's not too much 

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:54.060
 in what then by private message or in 

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:57.540
 comments 

00:06:54.060 --> 00:07:02.280
 and it takes for the one who puts the 

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:05.280
 comment or the hair at least at 

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:08.820
 less judge says well at least who puts 1 

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:12.690
 gym on the video about the city â€‹â€‹on this 

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:14.730

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:19.830
