00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.539
 do not 

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.100
 as promised is debt and some 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.960
 unless you were asking insistently 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:13.510
 I will leave you in the description the 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:17.050
 links for downloading so much delight 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:21.070
 The Chinese dragon ball bears like the TLC 1 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:26.500
 containing the DGT pack which we can 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:28.449
 goku find bread and a child dgt 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.039
 missions and book correction are three 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:32.230
 files I'll leave the three links in the 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:34.090
 description is very easy simply 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.490
 download is the first one you put in the 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:39.400
 Game folder downloads the second 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:41.590
 put in the part that is inside the 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:44.470
 update folder in the game folder 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:47.830
 replace is what I ask and you put and 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:50.500
 it replaces is the character well and with the 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:52.390
 third just the same what there is 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.240
 inside the update folder you put it in 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.600
 the game folder and then you put the 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:00.430
 crack and I could play as you see 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.860
 we are in the side missions and 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:07.650
 we are here with 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:11.490
 gt saga worth 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.320
 in this case if we give it apart also 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.240
 good corrects a series of books 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.700
 et cetera but well this is the most 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.800
 interesting that it brings and good as you see 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:24.600
 well bring here the characters so much bread 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.600
 how trans this drama 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.510
 let's do here in the structure 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.340
 good the discharge is enemy as I have 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.170
 said will be in the description and good 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.430
 it is very easy you put it in order and not 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.430
 you will have no problem 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.330
 well I'm now with the mouse and the 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:51.050
 keyboard and this I do not know much how 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:53.600
 but these good works with what 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:56.120
 you have here to see the characters in 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.930
 question how do you look here to see if it 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.930
 guess how it is fixed 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.690
 the received is not worth I am spending here 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.560
 capsules of all 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.560
 now 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.040
 and we are on the planet plan 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.430
 or the truth that the scenarios leave 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.670
 rather than wish I did not suffer a 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.670
 bit 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.659
 it's a bit like it's weird 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.330
 and good little more here we can do 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.250
 the mission of 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.350
 dgt I think there was also some mission 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.580
 of the pathology of time are missions 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.370
 of five stars per dan are the most 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.010
 difficult of the game 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:56.010
 but good if we have more content and the 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.989
 next time the new dlc comes out 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.760
 will be on the way I guess it will take a 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.470
 little bit more to go out then also not 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.590
 I will go up to the channel so you can 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.590
 enjoy
