that vent and be perfect well these guys

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:58.189 
that vent and be perfect well these guys
thought<00:00:56.280> of<00:00:56.309> that<00:00:56.489> so<00:00:56.879> this<00:00:57.030> is<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.210> Tetris<00:00:57.989> and

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
thought of that so this is a Tetris and

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.580 
thought of that so this is a Tetris and
what<00:00:58.379> they<00:00:58.500> have<00:00:58.710> is<00:00:59.840> check<00:01:00.840> this<00:01:00.960> out<00:01:01.140> so<00:01:01.410> this

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
what they have is check this out so this

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.249 
what they have is check this out so this
is<00:01:01.800> a<00:01:01.829> little<00:01:02.579> magnet<00:01:03.059> well<00:01:03.600> what<00:01:03.719> it<00:01:03.809> is<00:01:03.840> is<00:01:03.929> it

00:01:04.249 --> 00:01:04.259 
is a little magnet well what it is is it

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:06.020 
is a little magnet well what it is is it
clamps<00:01:04.649> on<00:01:04.800> and<00:01:05.009> I<00:01:05.039> can<00:01:05.190> pull<00:01:05.369> one<00:01:05.489> out<00:01:05.610> here<00:01:05.850> so

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
clamps on and I can pull one out here so

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.669 
clamps on and I can pull one out here so
see<00:01:06.660> this<00:01:06.810> little<00:01:06.929> there's<00:01:07.410> this<00:01:07.500> little

00:01:07.669 --> 00:01:07.679 
see this little there's this little

00:01:07.679 --> 00:01:09.469 
see this little there's this little
clamp<00:01:08.310> here<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.670> so<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:08.759> can<00:01:08.940> tighten<00:01:09.330> this

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
clamp here and so you can tighten this

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.900 
clamp here and so you can tighten this
actually<00:01:10.259> on<00:01:10.440> to<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.830> carbon<00:01:11.280> so<00:01:11.729> you<00:01:11.789> got<00:01:11.880> a

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:11.910 
actually on to the carbon so you got a

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:13.219 
actually on to the carbon so you got a
little<00:01:11.970> car<00:01:12.270> vent<00:01:12.450> here<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:12.750> you<00:01:12.810> can<00:01:12.899> you<00:01:13.110> can

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
little car vent here and you can you can

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.870 
little car vent here and you can you can
simply<00:01:13.380> attach<00:01:14.160> that<00:01:14.399> so<00:01:14.580> that's<00:01:14.729> what's

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
simply attach that so that's what's

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.580 
simply attach that so that's what's
going<00:01:15.030> on<00:01:15.119> right<00:01:15.179> here<00:01:15.360> so<00:01:16.170> this<00:01:16.320> is<00:01:16.470> all

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
going on right here so this is all

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.520 
going on right here so this is all
attached<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.550> the<00:01:17.990> you<00:01:18.990> know<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.200> its<00:01:19.470> really

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
attached to the you know and its really

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.050 
attached to the you know and its really
sticking<00:01:19.979> on<00:01:20.159> there<00:01:20.310> now<00:01:20.369> there's<00:01:20.550> a<00:01:20.640> really

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
sticking on there now there's a really

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.389 
sticking on there now there's a really
really<00:01:21.240> good<00:01:21.539> magnet<00:01:22.200> here<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:22.560> so<00:01:23.130> what<00:01:23.280> you

00:01:23.389 --> 00:01:23.399 
really good magnet here and so what you

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:26.029 
really good magnet here and so what you
can<00:01:23.520> do<00:01:23.759> is<00:01:24.110> you<00:01:25.110> know<00:01:25.229> you<00:01:25.590> can<00:01:25.710> stick

00:01:26.029 --> 00:01:26.039 
can do is you know you can stick

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:28.460 
can do is you know you can stick
something<00:01:26.460> like<00:01:26.729> this<00:01:26.970> onto<00:01:27.929> onto<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.350> back

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
something like this onto onto the back

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.469 
something like this onto onto the back
of<00:01:28.500> your<00:01:28.679> iPhone<00:01:29.009> so<00:01:29.220> you<00:01:29.310> can<00:01:29.429> see<00:01:29.670> see<00:01:30.270> here

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
now this is a case so this is the other

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.219 
now this is a case so this is the other
option<00:01:32.310> so<00:01:33.149> this<00:01:33.270> is<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.390> little<00:01:33.600> case<00:01:33.780> here<00:01:34.049> and

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
option so this is a little case here and

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.690 
option so this is a little case here and
it's<00:01:34.590> got<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.860> little<00:01:34.979> piece<00:01:35.310> that<00:01:35.460> it<00:01:35.549> needs

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700
