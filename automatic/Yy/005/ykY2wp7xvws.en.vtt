have on those yes and actually we have a
four<00:01:08.090> SDI<00:01:08.540> output<00:01:09.079> okay<00:01:09.590> and<00:01:09.880> everything

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
four SDI output okay and everything

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.180 
four SDI output okay and everything
labeled<00:01:11.149> us<00:01:11.540> like<00:01:11.869> a<00:01:11.899> problem<00:01:12.380> output<00:01:12.920> and<00:01:13.100> the

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:13.190 
labeled us like a problem output and the

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.460 
labeled us like a problem output and the
overlay<00:01:13.729> output<00:01:14.180> and<00:01:14.360> also<00:01:14.690> a<00:01:14.870> multi<00:01:15.229> puing

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
overlay output and also a multi puing

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.860 
overlay output and also a multi puing
output<00:01:16.070> multi<00:01:16.400> view<00:01:16.610> which<00:01:16.729> we<00:01:16.880> have<00:01:17.060> exactly

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:17.870 
output multi view which we have exactly

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:19.360 
output multi view which we have exactly
on<00:01:18.049> the<00:01:18.140> screen<00:01:18.380> behind<00:01:18.500> us<00:01:18.770> yeah<00:01:18.920> very<00:01:19.280> good

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:19.370 
on the screen behind us yeah very good

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:20.950 
on the screen behind us yeah very good
but<00:01:19.610> it<00:01:19.760> doesn't<00:01:20.000> just<00:01:20.180> have<00:01:20.360> to<00:01:20.390> be<00:01:20.540> multi<00:01:20.900> of

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
but it doesn't just have to be multi of

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.030 
but it doesn't just have to be multi of
you<00:01:21.080> know<00:01:21.229> that's<00:01:21.650> correct

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
you know that's correct

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.039 
you know that's correct
actually<00:01:22.520> yeah<00:01:22.610> you<00:01:22.640> can<00:01:23.120> assign<00:01:23.720> another

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049 
actually yeah you can assign another

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:26.590 
actually yeah you can assign another
signal<00:01:24.650> onto<00:01:25.040> the<00:01:25.159> interface<00:01:25.460> even<00:01:26.210> for<00:01:26.540> the

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
signal onto the interface even for the

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.080 
signal onto the interface even for the
program<00:01:26.960> out<00:01:27.170> you<00:01:27.830> can<00:01:28.040> assign<00:01:28.430> our<00:01:28.729> preview

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
program out you can assign our preview

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.890 
program out you can assign our preview
or<00:01:29.450> much<00:01:29.720> viewing<00:01:30.170> or<00:01:30.700> auxiliary<00:01:31.720> radio<00:01:32.720> or

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
program out fantastic so for HD SDI

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.039 
program out fantastic so for HD SDI
outputs<00:01:36.799> two<00:01:37.340> DVI<00:01:37.760> outputs<00:01:37.880> and<00:01:38.570> they're<00:01:38.930> all

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:39.049 
outputs two DVI outputs and they're all

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:41.530 
outputs two DVI outputs and they're all
independently<00:01:39.890> assignable<00:01:40.490> right<00:01:40.970> anything

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
independently assignable right anything

could be a single camera or a program or
as<00:01:44.570> you<00:01:44.780> mentioned<00:01:44.900> a<00:01:45.350> preview<00:01:46.159> or<00:01:46.310> program

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
as you mentioned a preview or program

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:49.510 
as you mentioned a preview or program
for<00:01:46.939> an<00:01:47.000> aux<00:01:47.240> that's<00:01:47.720> right<00:01:48.020> which<00:01:48.439> will<00:01:48.680> which

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
for an aux that's right which will which

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.070 
for an aux that's right which will which
I'd<00:01:49.640> like<00:01:49.760> to<00:01:49.820> describe<00:01:50.119> for<00:01:50.450> you<00:01:50.540> now<00:01:50.689> how

here<00:02:36.180> are<00:02:36.300> the<00:02:36.420> six<00:02:37.100> independently

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
here are the six independently

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.480 
here are the six independently
assignable<00:02:38.970> outputs<00:02:39.500> now<00:02:40.500> they<00:02:40.650> have<00:02:41.070> labels

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
assignable outputs now they have labels

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:42.890 
assignable outputs now they have labels
on<00:02:41.580> them<00:02:41.790> but<00:02:41.910> of<00:02:42.000> course<00:02:42.240> we<00:02:42.360> can<00:02:42.480> assign<00:02:42.750> them

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
on them but of course we can assign them

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.720 
on them but of course we can assign them
to<00:02:43.050> an<00:02:43.140> output<00:02:43.410> other<00:02:44.100> than<00:02:44.340> those<00:02:44.490> labels

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
to an output other than those labels

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.000 
to an output other than those labels
second<00:02:47.540> I<00:02:47.750> just<00:02:48.019> want<00:02:48.290> to<00:02:48.470> go<00:02:48.590> over<00:02:48.769> this<00:02:48.860> one

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
second I just want to go over this one

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.500 
second I just want to go over this one
more<00:02:49.040> time<00:02:49.280> because<00:02:49.430> again<00:02:49.819> I<00:02:49.940> haven't<00:02:50.180> seen

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
more time because again I haven't seen

this<00:02:50.780> feature<00:02:51.260> in<00:02:51.590> a<00:02:51.769> switcher<00:02:52.129> before<00:02:52.489> we

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
this feature in a switcher before we

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.420 
this feature in a switcher before we
have<00:02:53.480> two<00:02:53.690> independent<00:02:53.959> auxilary<00:02:54.950> outputs

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
have two independent auxilary outputs

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.880 
have two independent auxilary outputs
but<00:02:56.060> the<00:02:56.299> auxilary<00:02:56.690> output<00:02:57.049> can<00:02:57.260> do<00:02:57.349> a<00:02:57.379> cut<00:02:57.709> and

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
but the auxilary output can do a cut and

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.789 
but the auxilary output can do a cut and
a<00:02:58.370> dissolve<00:02:58.700> right<00:02:58.970> so<00:02:59.659> here<00:03:00.019> on<00:03:00.200> the<00:03:00.409> on<00:03:00.620> the

a dissolve right so here on the on the

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:02.740 
a dissolve right so here on the on the

aux<00:03:03.230> 1<00:03:03.319> program<00:03:03.860> if<00:03:04.760> I<00:03:05.299> was<00:03:05.540> just<00:03:05.840> switching

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
aux 1 program if I was just switching

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.650 
aux 1 program if I was just switching
the<00:03:06.349> sort<00:03:06.530> of<00:03:06.590> cutting<00:03:06.950> to<00:03:07.370> my<00:03:07.459> background<00:03:07.970> how

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
the sort of cutting to my background how

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.479 
the sort of cutting to my background how
would<00:03:08.840> I<00:03:08.870> switch<00:03:09.290> to<00:03:09.650> how<00:03:09.830> would<00:03:09.950> I<00:03:09.980> change<00:03:10.250> the

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
would I switch to how would I change the

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:12.400 
would I switch to how would I change the
switcher<00:03:10.849> so<00:03:11.209> I<00:03:11.239> can<00:03:11.510> do<00:03:11.660> it<00:03:11.780> dissolve<00:03:12.140> between

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:26.349 
you can assign this pro cross point

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:29.920 
you can assign this pro cross point

overly one yeah and now this cross point

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.650 
overly one yeah and now this cross point
can<00:03:38.359> be<00:03:38.390> assigned<00:03:38.900> as<00:03:39.640> always<00:03:40.640> one<00:03:40.940> cross
