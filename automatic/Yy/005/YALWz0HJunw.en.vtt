00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:11.340
 hi guys the other day there was news about 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.769
 the fact that ps4 will release the mouse and 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.900
 the keyboard is called she choir and 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.060
 is an ergonomic mouse and 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.359
 gaming keyboard which you 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.939
 connect to ps4 and play the price of it 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.430
 device will be 120 dollars this 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.539
 quite expensive but in this video I'm not 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.449
 would like to advertise 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.830
 I strongly advise this type of device to buy and 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.100
 so on opposite 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:38.340
 and so for reference I will call 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.140
 gamepad joystick so familiar to me not 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.860
 I need to write that it is completely different 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.829
 things 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.739
 closed the topic so start with the fact that 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.600
 ps3 i had a similar thing i was working 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.340
 in game store game zone and we 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.949
 bought a mouse for ps3 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.230
 that's how it looks and and bought and 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.329
 returned the next day and they gave me 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.680
 check if it works I tested 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.219
 I'll say her week right away 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:05.040
 it still is not working in all games 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.439
 specifically took it for bf3 on ps3 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.840
 I also checked there for the most part I 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:13.250
 I thought I would come in and start bending down 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.500
 fucking she was just awful 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:19.979
 The mouse itself was still normal, but 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.990
 pribluda to go with the stick she was 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.150
 terribly uncomfortable and normal 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.210
 use and switch weapons was 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:30.240
 just unrealistic to pull the finger here 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:33.270
 stick to the cross in is just that 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.880
 in general it was unreal that is the chip in 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.360
 that when I ran one on one 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.729
 emphasis 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.130
 I killed because I could before 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.590
 turn around more precisely twist and so 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.380
 Further, that is, as for now if two 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.630
 good players will play 1 on the mouse 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.189
 another advantage will be 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.970
 mice but only on the minimum 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.130
 the distance 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.110
 you can run away opponents 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.420
 shoot her in the back on joe so 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.880
 quickly don't do the rest 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.689
 decides only your straight hand and reaction 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:06.689
 that is, this thing cost 3000 and it was 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.700
 trash and the toughest is that when 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:11.430
 you pick up a sniper and aim 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:14.609
 far you are not on the lead 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:17.909
 the enemy in general for the aim starts 

00:02:14.609 --> 00:02:20.340
 move in jerks and no matter how much I want and 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:23.430
 I can not visit exactly on the enemy 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.450
 the scope of his jumps in general mouse 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.420
 was set up 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.400
 terribly cost much therefore if you 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.760
 think that the rich will buy themselves 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:36.480
 for ps4 such priblud and begin to bend 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.730
 then no it's not even if the new mouse 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.030
 and the club will be set up awesome all 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:45.180
 equally better than native even from 4 to ps4 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:49.079
 it is not configured so no 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:51.780
 domination of people with such pribluda speech 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:54.900
 it does not go at all it is rather made for 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:58.079
 those who do not really want to play 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.840
 gamepad and wants to play the mouse then 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:03.930
 for the good of you take the mouse at a high price 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:06.209
 please your business and so my opinion on 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.549
 consoles should only be joysticks on 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:11.579
 then she and the console all the same 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:14.579
 joystick no cheater all equal 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:16.970
 conditions there are only morons and juices and 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:20.069
 other defective but it is therefore everywhere 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:22.440
 ps4 this and is good compared to while 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:24.389
 and the server is clogged up to failure therefore 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.909
 I do not advise anyone to buy such 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:29.609
 because it won't work as much as you 

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:32.280
 think guys with even hands of you 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:34.439
 will bend anyway need to have a shock 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.610
 I still think it's more convenient 

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:39.790
 gaming is when you play 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:42.460
 on the couch with a joystick they hide 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:45.130
 sitting with a hunched back with a mouse and 

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:47.290
 albeit a good gaming keyboard and 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.180
 by the way on the one with bloody will not work 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.520
 play mortal kombat and others 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.590
 fighting games it is purely for shooters that me 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:56.190
 again suggested an idea what kind of 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.810
 still a gamepad well or a joystick 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:01.840
 a developed device that fits 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.910
 for all types of games fighting racing shooter 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.800
 and so on except that strategy 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:08.980
 stay on mouse and bye 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.959
 but I don't think this dead genre 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:14.050
 upset someone with his absence on 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:16.120
