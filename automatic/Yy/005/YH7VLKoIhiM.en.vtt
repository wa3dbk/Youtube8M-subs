causing<00:01:30.479> them<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:31.110> speed<00:01:31.350> up<00:01:31.500> in<00:01:31.650> turn<00:01:31.829> and

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
causing them to speed up in turn and

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.260 
causing them to speed up in turn and
bump<00:01:33.450> into<00:01:33.720> their<00:01:33.990> neighbors<00:01:34.470> and<00:01:34.790> so<00:01:35.790> on<00:01:36.000> all

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
bump into their neighbors and so on all

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.410 
bump into their neighbors and so on all
along<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.960> ladle<00:01:37.520> in<00:01:38.520> this<00:01:38.790> way<00:01:39.030> the

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
along the ladle in this way the

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.149 
along the ladle in this way the
increased<00:01:39.869> speed<00:01:40.140> of<00:01:40.380> vibration<00:01:40.950> and

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
increased speed of vibration and

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.789 
increased speed of vibration and
therefore<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.060> heat<00:01:42.270> is<00:01:42.899> passed<00:01:43.290> on<00:01:43.530> from

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
therefore the heat is passed on from

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.460 
therefore the heat is passed on from
molecule<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.340> molecule<00:01:44.640> or<00:01:45.270> from<00:01:45.930> atom<00:01:46.290> to

their<00:02:26.460> secret<00:02:27.230> well<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.350> secret<00:02:28.680> lies<00:02:28.890> in<00:02:28.920> the

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
their secret well the secret lies in the

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.950 
their secret well the secret lies in the
fact<00:02:29.520> that<00:02:29.730> there's<00:02:30.120> something<00:02:30.600> very

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
fact that there's something very

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.490 
fact that there's something very

peculiar about these atoms in metals we

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.830 
peculiar about these atoms in metals we
know<00:02:34.680> that<00:02:34.920> all<00:02:35.130> atoms<00:02:35.640> consist<00:02:35.910> of<00:02:36.210> a<00:02:36.300> nucleus
