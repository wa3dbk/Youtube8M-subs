00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.100
 all by one end of the confinement 

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.720
 the phenotype is genetics 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.909
 more with the school environment 

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:10.739
 the dead animal it seems to be 

00:00:10.739 --> 00:00:13.739
 genealogy what can be 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.730
 depends on luck 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.619
 is getting the best tennis players keeping and the father 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:26.020
 and progeny or with a genetic variation with consistency therein 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:29.019
 that he really is 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.730
 another characteristic this goal we evaluate is a beak because it is of 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.690
 easy exploration we took advantage of then we also sent the anvil 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.050
 we know that a mustache 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.320
 max payne are more than seven times the pathologies caused by 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.320
 trauma due to contact 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.100
 from the mucosa to the invasive granule this can lead to an injury 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.310
 consequently an inflammation 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:02.890
 and there we apply stories from 1 to 6 as well but there no more form 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.890
 concerning the contemporary group essien 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.659
 an evaluation lead 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:12.209
 absolute of bradespar and poorly focused in brachiaria 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.090
 on hand bash the motive will not give much change 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.650
 the important thing is that we evaluate some progeny 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.630
 dawn certain breeder than other breeders and we know that 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.249
 that breeder he is to help correct a beak 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.860
 it will generate with more fervent nozzles there we work this 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.080
 feature 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.080
 within the direction of mating 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.660
 solve more or less like birth weight 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.970
 nobody satan and small wine 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.100
 Nobody's too bad to be so heavy. 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.360
 but we asked for birth weight 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.170
 to monitor feature within the selection process 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.100
 and then how I was conducting a head pole in being very big, let's not go there 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.130
 heifer 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.040
 here it's more or less the same way 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.159
 since they already have the most southern motif 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:10.709
 we're not going to use a whole that you have here to see 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.989
 these indicating that this individual 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.929
 I downloaded 

00:02:13.929 --> 00:02:16.439
 the best placed 

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:20.969
 and this evaluation of pm how do we apply it in practice then 

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:22.769
 in practice 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:24.939
 we have a lot 

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:27.579
 the seventh mark on a coral for example 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:29.590
 this lot and date have not yet 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.940
 to weigh in the program we step on animals 

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:41.739
 subdivide cp - age difference in corral indicated is up to 60 months in the 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:43.539
 maximum offered age 

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:46.379
 from the oldest to the youngest 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:48.429
 nomadic breast for example 

00:02:48.429 --> 00:02:53.629
 in a mountaineering season of four months can kill us and this is the oldest 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:55.839
 this is the youngest 

00:02:55.839 --> 00:03:00.319
 Older calf is the youngest and there are four stores 

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:06.389
 already the heavy on the plate and also so the convention to make evaluation 

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:09.239
 usually by the younger daughters 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:14.119
 until we arrive we say but it was from the north pedro 

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:17.269
 the animals are heavy 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:21.269
 we subi divided then we separated from the lot of smaller difference of age 

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:23.959
 we put 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:29.449
 per hour worked in a choir and there we went from three entrepreneurs in two 

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:31.069
 stages next to 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:34.780
 we looked at the floor and what game distributed copies of the south 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.260
 interviewed to pass bad is heavy 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.160
 this test somewhere 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.270
 or will give more structure or more and muscularity 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.889
 or more and precocity at last 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:52.150
 in the case of this individual what he stood out more employment pme is precisely 

00:03:52.149 --> 00:03:57.729
 structure counts the spirit of it slightly higher than the average of the lot 

00:03:57.729 --> 00:03:59.609
 evaluated 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:03.980
 precocity was weaker than if some 

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:08.649
 raised from the floor of the groin most reported showing a little more 

00:04:08.649 --> 00:04:09.969
 use dispute 

00:04:09.969 --> 00:04:12.629
 and the muscularity is over 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:14.339
 fitting 

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:16.979
 has 31 and scolari the other 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:22.719
 here in case the tcu already highlights such a painful construction company but also little 

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:23.319
 by motorcycle 

00:04:23.319 --> 00:04:28.069
 fracture with deep sequelae and low groin 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.580
 when we put one visible with next to the other 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:34.550
 is evident 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.650
 these differences 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.920
 40 m deep I hope to acquire the property 

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:44.210
 mass coverage 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.990
 muscle
