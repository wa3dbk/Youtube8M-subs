00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:07.820
 hi girls, guys, how are you? 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.400
 today I bring you a new video and in this 

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:11.990
 I'm going to show you my lipsticks 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.510
 The truth is that I do not have many 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:17.270
 because almost all of the ones that you can 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:19.430
 find in my closet are mac 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.050
 so good anyway are three 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:24.310
 what I want to show you before I had 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.260
 another more good lipstick was a balm 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.880
 ok but I'm spending and now I have 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.890
 these three that are different 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.770
 tones one plus I bought it makes 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.480
 little good to say that I'll leave you in 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.460
 the link left them without gasoline of all 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.220
 the videos I'll leave you a series of 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.230
 links where you can see where where 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.300
 buy this signature you can do so much 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:46.079
 online as in stands in physical stores 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:49.030
 in some english court of spain 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.710
 so then I'm going to try all three 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.850
 so you can see how the color looks in 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.430
 the lips to me the truth is that I 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.900
 I really like what I have and I hope 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.850
 that you also like good 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.790
 I understand that the price of each 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:03.220
 labial per unit round 25 25 euros 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.470
 with 50 I do not know exactly but I think 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:07.799
 I 'm out there so I do not expect anything 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.510
 you like the video and let's start 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.580
 let's start from the clearest to the 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.890
 darker to not ride something weird 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.869
 there on the lips then good to give us 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.580
 I have a little capped with concealer for 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:20.229
 that looks good is not really 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.970
 a corrector is the product this that 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:26.120
 has more for lips, well, that's 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:28.900
 then the first one is the roman holiday 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:31.360
 It is a very clear pink 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:34.690
 then it is not so intense or so pink 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:37.350
 as you can see here 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.350
 OK 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:44.670
 and now I'm going to try to see how 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.670
 remains 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.189
 well, this is the roman live as 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.619
 you see is a very natural rosita as very 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.659
 cake I love it seems to me 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:58.500
 precious we say that the lipsticks of 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.969
 nash bring 34 grams and although 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.069
 they seem smaller than the others 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.439
 because those that seem smaller to me 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:06.810
 it's the feeling that it gives me because it brings a 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.849
 little bit more others bring 3 grams 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.890
 is between high up to 3 grams not 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:13.310
 you understand not good because this is the roman 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.310
 holiday 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.480
 so nothing and you will tell me what has 

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:22.129
 like now let's go I'm going to 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.019
 teach the next one that is a little more 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:26.629
 clear because the last one is already the most 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:28.400
 uploaded of all good because it is the Niagara 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:31.640
 the stand comes and it seemed very 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.500
 really nice to see I saw it and I 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.329
 it got attention but when really 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.739
 it convinced me was when I tried it on 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:39.799
 the lips because I found a color 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:42.109
 super nice very very very flattering 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:43.939
 that I bought it exactly and I know 

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:46.069
 I said is the Niagara so I already 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:48.439
 I say I'm going to try it this way 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:50.689
 that I have the lips is pretty creamy 

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:54.880
 does not become mate and this is also 

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:58.540
 is we believe milestone is this color 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:00.990
 it's like a mix between coral coral very 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.990
 soft 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.420
 it's very nice then now I'm going to 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.420
 try and you see me 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.310
 Well, this is the other one, it's also that 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.530
 I have to say that all the lipsticks 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.990
 they are modulable that is to say if you can put 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.730
 a thin layer remains less intense and 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:18.110
 If you give several passes, it stays 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:21.590
 A) Yes 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:23.750
 I like it a lot, it's very beautiful and nothing 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:27.020
 This is the other one that I wanted to teach you and 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:30.230
 last worth the last one is the one 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:32.160
 write jungle red so you can understand 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:35.730
 you understand me 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:38.340
 then you can see it is worth and it is a red 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.230
 very very very nice 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.450
 a red by the way the same color as 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:46.110
 my nails 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:49.170
 very cool this is something more matte I think 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:52.220
 this is mate was mate practically and 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.220
 now you will see how beautiful it is 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.769
 well girls, this is the last one 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.709
 see is a work that is like a red 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:02.269
 cherry is totally matte when put it 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:04.819
 I've realized that yes that was 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:06.799
 drier than the mojama but good what 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:08.209
 great anyway if we like this 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:10.129
 finished then you can put a little bit of 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:11.720
 balloons in the middle of the lip like this 

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:13.489
 you are also going to bring volume and such 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.440
 sure you already know this trick because 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:17.660
 It's quite old but good 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.940
 perhaps so nothing, this is the video 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.829
 that I bring you teaching the ministres 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.470
 lipsticks hand mark nash 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:25.639
 I always have the mac chip and good 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.100
 Well, you will tell me in 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:29.750
 comments if you have any or if I 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.520
 you recommend another color that is incredible 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.750
 and that I have not realized because 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.610
 the truth that is pretty good is 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.760
 the siap that is also very nice but 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:39.949
 it looks like it has an air to it or the 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:44.570
 light at times go cloudiness I think 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:46.430
 will fall incredible go good cloud that 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.620
 I think being is also very similar 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.210
 The union lamp does not become equal 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.620
 but very similar then that's why I did not 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:53.479
 I picked it up but that's pretty well known 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.860
 also anyway anyway I tell you if 

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:56.449
 Do you have any recommendation to give me? 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.680
 please put it in comments no 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:58.580
 forget to click on I like it if I really 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.470
 you liked it 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:03.819
 comments of love and passion and we 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:03.819
 we see very soon until the next
