pretty solid
I<00:02:07.860> mean<00:02:08.360> first<00:02:09.360> real<00:02:09.660> real<00:02:10.489> top-to-bottom<00:02:11.489> run

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
of done all weekend so it was a good

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.059 
of done all weekend so it was a good
gauge<00:02:14.280> to<00:02:14.550> see<00:02:14.580> how<00:02:14.849> the<00:02:14.910> purpose<00:02:15.239> was<00:02:15.450> and

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
gauge to see how the purpose was and

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.800 
gauge to see how the purpose was and
kind<00:02:17.069> of<00:02:17.130> felt<00:02:17.340> like<00:02:17.510> and<00:02:18.510> it<00:02:18.599> could<00:02:18.720> have

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
kind of felt like and it could have

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.210 
kind of felt like and it could have
pushed<00:02:18.989> a<00:02:19.140> little<00:02:19.260> harder<00:02:19.410> so<00:02:19.739> that's<00:02:20.040> big

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
pushed a little harder so that's big

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.509 
pushed a little harder so that's big
confidence<00:02:20.790> going<00:02:21.000> into<00:02:21.150> the<00:02:21.360> final<00:02:21.780> and<00:02:22.519> you

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
it wasn't so bad it was it could be a

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.900 
it wasn't so bad it was it could be a
lot<00:02:48.930> worse<00:02:49.230> but<00:02:49.620> I<00:02:49.800> just<00:02:49.830> didn't<00:02:50.370> feel<00:02:50.400> like<00:02:50.700> I

and<00:02:53.490> on<00:02:53.610> the<00:02:53.730> track<00:02:53.970> like<00:02:54.240> this<00:02:54.450> you<00:02:54.780> can't<00:02:55.110> be

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
and on the track like this you can't be

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.760 
and on the track like this you can't be
on<00:02:55.650> top<00:02:55.950> of<00:02:55.980> a<00:02:56.310> train<00:02:56.760> it's<00:02:57.750> gonna<00:02:57.960> bite<00:02:58.230> you

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
on top of a train it's gonna bite you

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.880 
on top of a train it's gonna bite you
and<00:02:59.060> I<00:03:00.060> started<00:03:00.630> be<00:03:00.750> dangerous<00:03:01.170> to<00:03:01.320> try<00:03:01.530> right

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
and I started be dangerous to try right

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.840 
and I started be dangerous to try right
I<00:03:02.280> was<00:03:02.610> not<00:03:03.300> even<00:03:03.570> close<00:03:03.750> to<00:03:04.220> my<00:03:05.220> face<00:03:05.460> that<00:03:05.520> I

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
I was not even close to my face that I

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.630 
I was not even close to my face that I
want<00:03:06.030> to<00:03:06.090> be<00:03:06.210> yet<00:03:06.390> so<00:03:07.160> I'm<00:03:08.160> just<00:03:08.340> gonna<00:03:08.430> wait

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
want to be yet so I'm just gonna wait

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.580 
want to be yet so I'm just gonna wait
until<00:03:08.700> my<00:03:09.210> ankles<00:03:09.510> ready<00:03:09.780> and<00:03:09.990> then<00:03:10.110> I<00:03:10.320> think

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
until my ankles ready and then I think

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.260 
until my ankles ready and then I think
that's<00:03:10.800> that's<00:03:11.400> the<00:03:11.520> right<00:03:11.700> thing<00:03:11.730> to<00:03:11.940> do<00:03:12.090> it's

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
that's that's the right thing to do it's

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:46.449 
that's that's the right thing to do it's
a<00:03:12.360> tough<00:03:12.570> decision<00:03:12.690> but

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:51.089 

it<00:03:47.030> was<00:03:47.180> good<00:03:47.450> I<00:03:47.480> just<00:03:47.840> did<00:03:48.019> two<00:03:48.739> runs<00:03:49.040> and

00:03:51.089 --> 00:03:51.099

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
there and you know found a few lines

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.440 
there and you know found a few lines
that<00:03:57.019> I<00:03:57.140> changed<00:03:57.530> from<00:03:57.980> my<00:03:58.219> qualifier<00:03:58.909> and<00:03:59.180> so
