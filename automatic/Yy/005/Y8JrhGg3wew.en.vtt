here actually just took a little bit of

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.499 
here actually just took a little bit of
leverage<00:01:19.470> not<00:01:19.890> I<00:01:19.920> mean<00:01:20.340> not<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.700> lot<00:01:20.909> came<00:01:21.270> right

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
leverage not I mean not a lot came right

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
you know it's it's fun pretty easy I can

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.350 
you know it's it's fun pretty easy I can
spread<00:01:25.350> by<00:01:25.530> hand<00:01:25.740> now<00:01:25.939> actually<00:01:26.939> it<00:01:27.030> gets<00:01:27.119> hung

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
spread by hand now actually it gets hung

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:37.100 
spread by hand now actually it gets hung
up<00:01:27.540> at<00:01:28.200> one<00:01:28.409> spot<00:01:28.770> so<00:01:35.479> you'll<00:01:36.479> get<00:01:36.600> hung<00:01:36.840> up<00:01:36.960> at

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
up at one spot so you'll get hung up at

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.490 
up at one spot so you'll get hung up at
one<00:01:37.259> spot<00:01:37.790> and<00:01:38.790> try<00:01:38.939> it<00:01:39.000> back<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.270> other<00:01:39.299> way

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.630

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
but I'm really glad now because I was

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.740 
but I'm really glad now because I was
thinking<00:01:44.909> I've<00:01:44.970> gonna<00:01:45.119> have<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.360> cut<00:01:45.570> the

thinking I've gonna have to cut the

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.730 
thinking I've gonna have to cut the
timing<00:01:46.350> chain<00:01:46.380> off<00:01:46.799> because<00:01:48.110> the<00:01:49.110> two<00:01:49.320> bolts

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
timing chain off because the two bolts

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.789 
timing chain off because the two bolts
that<00:01:50.549> hold<00:01:50.700> it<00:01:50.880> on<00:01:51.320> it<00:01:52.320> was<00:01:52.560> in<00:01:52.950> this<00:01:53.850> position

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 
that hold it on it was in this position

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:57.050 
that hold it on it was in this position

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
and there's no way you can get to the

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.429 
and there's no way you can get to the

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
off now I can turn it

there's<00:02:23.180> a<00:02:23.270> couple<00:02:23.450> more<00:02:23.660> bolts<00:02:23.870> to<00:02:24.050> get<00:02:24.170> the

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
there's a couple more bolts to get the

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.160 
there's a couple more bolts to get the

you didn't know about this so I got

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.979 
you didn't know about this so I got
those<00:02:31.610> off<00:02:31.880> and<00:02:32.060> actually<00:02:32.270> came<00:02:32.569> off<00:02:32.600> pretty

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
those off and actually came off pretty

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
basically clean in cylinder four which

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.800 
basically clean in cylinder four which
had<00:03:00.739> more<00:03:00.920> light<00:03:04.060> something<00:03:05.060> happened<00:03:05.630> there

loose<00:03:13.310> here<00:03:13.580> let's<00:03:14.360> pull<00:03:14.600> them<00:03:14.690> out

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
loose here let's pull them out

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.400 
loose here let's pull them out
I<00:03:15.230> should<00:03:16.100> go<00:03:16.220> ask<00:03:16.340> for<00:03:16.489> second<00:03:17.000> hand<00:03:17.410> hold

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
I should go ask for second hand hold

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:31.509 
I should go ask for second hand hold
these<00:03:18.709> hold<00:03:19.430> this<00:03:22.180> timing<00:03:23.180> chain<00:03:30.370> make<00:03:31.370> it

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 
these hold this timing chain make it

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:32.920 
these hold this timing chain make it
look<00:03:31.640> a<00:03:31.700> lot<00:03:31.790> easier<00:03:31.850> than<00:03:32.180> it<00:03:32.299> was<00:03:32.480> I<00:03:32.690> did<00:03:32.840> you

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
look a lot easier than it was I did you

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:56.230 
look a lot easier than it was I did you
little<00:03:33.200> prime<00:03:42.910> there's<00:03:43.910> this

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.970 

noticed<00:04:02.760> is<00:04:03.540> that<00:04:03.600> good<00:04:03.990> old<00:04:04.200> rusty<00:04:04.680> number

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
noticed is that good old rusty number

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.310 
noticed is that good old rusty number
four<00:04:05.220> here<00:04:05.580> the<00:04:06.300> Rings<00:04:06.570> are<00:04:06.720> frozen<00:04:07.020> on<00:04:07.260> the

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
four here the Rings are frozen on the

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.220 
four here the Rings are frozen on the
piston<00:04:08.000> you<00:04:09.000> can<00:04:09.120> see<00:04:09.360> it's<00:04:09.510> rings<00:04:09.810> are<00:04:09.960> frozen

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
piston you can see it's rings are frozen

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:11.660 
piston you can see it's rings are frozen
you<00:04:10.380> can't<00:04:10.560> see<00:04:10.710> them<00:04:10.830> on<00:04:10.950> all<00:04:11.040> other<00:04:11.220> Pistons

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
you can't see them on all other Pistons

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.460 
you can't see them on all other Pistons
they're<00:04:11.880> loose<00:04:12.090> you<00:04:12.420> can<00:04:12.540> you<00:04:12.930> can<00:04:13.080> spin<00:04:13.350> him

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
they're loose you can you can spin him

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:23.900 
they're loose you can you can spin him
around<00:04:20.510> but<00:04:21.510> they're<00:04:22.230> frozen<00:04:22.680> I'm<00:04:23.640> talking

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
around but they're frozen I'm talking

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.340 
around but they're frozen I'm talking
about<00:04:23.940> the<00:04:24.120> frozen<00:04:24.270> piston<00:04:24.690> ring<00:04:24.840> as<00:04:24.930> well

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
about the frozen piston ring as well

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:28.130 
about the frozen piston ring as well
they're<00:04:26.250> very<00:04:26.520> frozen<00:04:26.790> I<00:04:27.090> soaked<00:04:27.480> this<00:04:27.690> piston

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:28.140 
they're very frozen I soaked this piston

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:31.520 
they're very frozen I soaked this piston
and<00:04:28.440> PB<00:04:28.950> Blaster<00:04:29.460> in<00:04:30.150> this<00:04:30.360> can<00:04:30.660> here<00:04:31.050> has<00:04:31.260> cut

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
and PB Blaster in this can here has cut

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.130 
and PB Blaster in this can here has cut
the<00:04:31.650> can<00:04:31.860> off<00:04:32.070> it<00:04:32.790> was<00:04:32.940> a<00:04:32.970> lot<00:04:33.210> of<00:04:33.240> Eros<00:04:33.570> also

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:34.140 
the can off it was a lot of Eros also

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.930 
the can off it was a lot of Eros also
but<00:04:34.590> there<00:04:34.740> was<00:04:34.830> literally<00:04:35.280> that<00:04:35.460> much<00:04:35.640> PB

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
but there was literally that much PB

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.520 
but there was literally that much PB
Blaster<00:04:36.360> left<00:04:36.570> in<00:04:36.690> it<00:04:36.780> so<00:04:36.930> I<00:04:36.960> soaked<00:04:37.260> it<00:04:37.380> in

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
Blaster left in it so I soaked it in

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:38.020 
Blaster left in it so I soaked it in
there

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
there

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.340 
there
and<00:04:39.030> it<00:04:39.120> didn't<00:04:39.330> really<00:04:39.510> seem<00:04:39.660> to<00:04:39.780> do<00:04:39.900> much<00:04:39.930> I

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.350 
and it didn't really seem to do much I

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.340 
and it didn't really seem to do much I
just<00:04:40.380> went<00:04:40.860> ahead<00:04:40.950> and<00:04:41.240> start<00:04:42.240> trying<00:04:42.390> to<00:04:42.510> get

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
just went ahead and start trying to get

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.290 
just went ahead and start trying to get
him<00:04:43.470> out<00:04:43.560> with<00:04:43.650> a<00:04:43.710> screwdriver<00:04:43.980> and<00:04:44.490> they

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
him out with a screwdriver and they

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.090 
him out with a screwdriver and they
broke<00:04:45.510> off<00:04:45.690> this<00:04:45.900> is<00:04:46.050> just<00:04:46.230> when<00:04:46.410> I<00:04:46.440> put<00:04:46.770> it<00:04:47.040> in

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 
broke off this is just when I put it in

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:48.530 
broke off this is just when I put it in
here<00:04:47.250> they're<00:04:47.430> from<00:04:47.700> another<00:04:47.790> piston<00:04:48.330> just

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:48.540 
here they're from another piston just

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.370 
here they're from another piston just
test<00:04:48.960> the<00:04:49.110> fit<00:04:50.300> but<00:04:51.300> yeah<00:04:51.630> I<00:04:51.750> mean<00:04:51.900> that<00:04:52.110> I<00:04:52.170> had

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
test the fit but yeah I mean that I had

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.390 
test the fit but yeah I mean that I had
to<00:04:52.470> break<00:04:52.650> him<00:04:52.830> out<00:04:52.980> and<00:04:53.160> five<00:04:54.030> or<00:04:54.420> six<00:04:54.450> pieces

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
to break him out and five or six pieces

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.680 
to break him out and five or six pieces
cuz<00:04:56.400> they<00:04:56.520> were<00:04:56.640> there<00:04:56.760> that<00:04:56.940> rusted<00:04:57.390> in<00:04:57.510> there

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
cuz they were there that rusted in there

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.410
