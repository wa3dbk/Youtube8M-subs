stoppage in the radiator because it did
recently<00:00:32.390> had<00:00:32.990> a<00:00:33.290> coolant<00:00:34.010> system<00:00:34.730> flush<00:00:35.120> and

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:35.950 
recently had a coolant system flush and

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.260 
recently had a coolant system flush and
we<00:00:36.950> noticed<00:00:37.340> that<00:00:37.400> there<00:00:37.520> were<00:00:37.700> no<00:00:37.970> water

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:38.270 
we noticed that there were no water

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.860 
we noticed that there were no water
leaks<00:00:38.570> or<00:00:38.840> coolant<00:00:39.200> leaks<00:00:39.440> of<00:00:39.650> any<00:00:39.800> kind

leaks or coolant leaks of any kind
axillary<00:00:41.870> fans<00:00:42.170> were<00:00:42.440> working<00:00:42.830> correctly<00:00:43.490> but

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
axillary fans were working correctly but

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.750 
axillary fans were working correctly but
the<00:00:44.180> vehicle<00:00:44.600> just<00:00:44.630> seems<00:00:45.290> to<00:00:45.650> on<00:00:45.950> the<00:00:46.310> freeway

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
the vehicle just seems to on the freeway

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.320 
the vehicle just seems to on the freeway
or<00:00:47.090> any<00:00:47.540> kind<00:00:47.960> of<00:00:48.370> driving<00:00:49.370> after<00:00:49.880> six<00:00:50.150> or

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:50.330 
or any kind of driving after six or

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.090 
or any kind of driving after six or
seven<00:00:50.660> miles<00:00:50.900> the<00:00:51.260> vehicle<00:00:51.650> starts<00:00:52.010> to

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
seven miles the vehicle starts to

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.460 
seven miles the vehicle starts to
overheat<00:00:52.520> so<00:00:53.270> let's<00:00:53.480> see<00:00:53.690> what<00:00:53.870> we<00:00:53.990> did<00:00:54.020> to

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:54.470 
overheat so let's see what we did to

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.340 
overheat so let's see what we did to
diagnose<00:00:55.340> this<00:00:55.580> project<00:00:56.210> and<00:00:56.390> then<00:00:57.080> turn

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
diagnose this project and then turn

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.640 
diagnose this project and then turn
around<00:00:57.500> and<00:00:57.830> do<00:00:57.980> the<00:00:58.130> repair<00:00:59.170> after<00:01:00.170> running

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:00.650 
around and do the repair after running

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.590 
around and do the repair after running
the<00:01:00.860> car<00:01:01.070> for<00:01:01.340> a<00:01:01.370> while<00:01:01.580> our<00:01:01.610> suspicions<00:01:02.420> were

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
the car for a while our suspicions were

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.630 
the car for a while our suspicions were
that<00:01:02.840> we<00:01:02.990> had<00:01:03.140> some<00:01:03.470> kind<00:01:03.500> of<00:01:03.830> circulation

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
that we had some kind of circulation

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.380 
that we had some kind of circulation
issue<00:01:04.970> so<00:01:05.900> we<00:01:06.110> removed<00:01:06.760> most<00:01:07.760> of<00:01:07.940> the<00:01:08.000> engine

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
issue so we removed most of the engine

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.060 
issue so we removed most of the engine
cover<00:01:08.630> and<00:01:08.750> stuff<00:01:09.140> so<00:01:09.290> we<00:01:09.380> can<00:01:09.410> actually<00:01:09.680> see

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
cover and stuff so we can actually see

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.640 
cover and stuff so we can actually see
the<00:01:10.250> motor<00:01:10.460> and<00:01:10.760> what<00:01:11.750> we<00:01:11.870> did<00:01:12.080> is<00:01:12.230> we<00:01:12.260> let<00:01:12.500> the

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
the motor and what we did is we let the

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.400 
the motor and what we did is we let the
car<00:01:12.860> warm<00:01:13.280> up<00:01:13.490> and<00:01:13.790> we<00:01:14.720> check<00:01:14.960> the<00:01:15.110> upper

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:15.410 
car warm up and we check the upper

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:18.160 
car warm up and we check the upper
radiator<00:01:15.620> hose<00:01:16.270> once<00:01:17.270> the<00:01:17.420> car<00:01:17.630> was<00:01:17.840> warm

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
radiator hose once the car was warm

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.740 
radiator hose once the car was warm
upper<00:01:18.530> radiator<00:01:18.740> hose<00:01:19.070> was<00:01:19.730> warm<00:01:20.210> which

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
upper radiator hose was warm which

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.200 
upper radiator hose was warm which
indicated<00:01:21.290> that<00:01:21.440> the<00:01:21.620> thermostat<00:01:22.159> had<00:01:22.700> opened

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
indicated that the thermostat had opened

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.930 
indicated that the thermostat had opened
if<00:01:24.140> the<00:01:24.470> thermostat<00:01:24.950> had<00:01:25.190> not<00:01:25.400> opened<00:01:25.820> we

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:25.940 
if the thermostat had not opened we

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.880 
if the thermostat had not opened we
would<00:01:26.120> have<00:01:26.240> had<00:01:26.390> a<00:01:26.420> cold<00:01:26.870> upper<00:01:27.680> radiator

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
would have had a cold upper radiator

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.880 
would have had a cold upper radiator
hose<00:01:28.330> so<00:01:29.330> the<00:01:29.510> next<00:01:29.750> thing<00:01:30.050> to<00:01:30.080> check<00:01:30.230> would<00:01:30.680> be

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
hose so the next thing to check would be

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.120 
hose so the next thing to check would be
is<00:01:31.400> the<00:01:31.700> water<00:01:31.909> pump<00:01:32.240> actually<00:01:33.130> circulating

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
is the water pump actually circulating

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.570 
is the water pump actually circulating
water<00:01:34.450> well<00:01:35.450> in<00:01:35.900> most<00:01:36.440> situations<00:01:36.680> the<00:01:37.340> water

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
water well in most situations the water

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.719 
water well in most situations the water
pump<00:01:37.909> wouldn't<00:01:38.300> be<00:01:38.390> as<00:01:38.510> suspect<00:01:39.080> unless<00:01:39.729> we

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
pump wouldn't be as suspect unless we

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:43.540 
pump wouldn't be as suspect unless we
had<00:01:40.880> a<00:01:40.909> leak<00:01:41.240> of<00:01:41.450> the<00:01:41.479> water<00:01:41.750> pump<00:01:42.159> but<00:01:43.159> knowing

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550 
had a leak of the water pump but knowing

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.969 
had a leak of the water pump but knowing
that<00:01:43.580> the<00:01:44.270> design<00:01:44.690> of<00:01:44.960> the<00:01:45.050> Volkswagen<00:01:45.320> water

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
that the design of the Volkswagen water

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:48.990 
that the design of the Volkswagen water
pump<00:01:46.340> we<00:01:46.580> decided<00:01:47.180> to<00:01:47.360> take<00:01:47.600> the<00:01:48.229> intake<00:01:48.799> hose

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
pump we decided to take the intake hose

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.520 
pump we decided to take the intake hose
off<00:01:50.000> of<00:01:50.060> the<00:01:50.420> vehicle<00:01:50.810> this<00:01:50.960> is<00:01:51.140> the<00:01:51.260> lower

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
off of the vehicle this is the lower

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.120 
off of the vehicle this is the lower
radiator<00:01:52.070> hose<00:01:52.220> that<00:01:53.060> fits<00:01:53.510> up<00:01:53.750> to<00:01:54.080> about<00:01:54.890> an

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
radiator hose that fits up to about an

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.580 
radiator hose that fits up to about an
inch<00:01:55.280> and<00:01:55.549> a<00:01:55.580> quarter<00:01:55.850> fitting<00:01:56.840> that<00:01:57.229> goes

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
inch and a quarter fitting that goes

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.550 
inch and a quarter fitting that goes
just<00:01:58.490> above<00:01:58.729> the<00:01:58.909> alternator<00:01:59.479> what<00:02:00.200> we<00:02:00.350> did

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
just above the alternator what we did

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.210 
just above the alternator what we did
with<00:02:00.740> this<00:02:00.920> hose<00:02:01.190> is<00:02:01.549> we<00:02:02.090> took<00:02:02.299> the<00:02:02.510> hose<00:02:02.720> off

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
with this hose is we took the hose off

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.640 
with this hose is we took the hose off
connected<00:02:04.220> another<00:02:04.580> hose<00:02:04.909> to<00:02:05.360> it<00:02:05.570> and<00:02:05.810> ran<00:02:06.440> the

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
connected another hose to it and ran the

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.430 
connected another hose to it and ran the
hose<00:02:06.830> to<00:02:07.130> a<00:02:07.159> bucket<00:02:07.729> and<00:02:07.940> then<00:02:08.780> started<00:02:09.349> the

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
hose to a bucket and then started the

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.129 
hose to a bucket and then started the
engine<00:02:09.799> once<00:02:10.039> again<00:02:10.489> now<00:02:11.329> if<00:02:11.599> we<00:02:11.810> would<00:02:11.989> have

they will break loose off of the inner
shaft<00:03:17.040> and<00:03:17.400> that's<00:03:17.520> exactly<00:03:18.240> what<00:03:18.420> happened

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
shaft and that's exactly what happened

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.140 
shaft and that's exactly what happened
to<00:03:18.900> this<00:03:19.110> water<00:03:19.440> pump<00:03:19.710> right<00:03:19.980> here<00:03:20.040> watch<00:03:20.910> what

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
to this water pump right here watch what

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.530 
to this water pump right here watch what
happens<00:03:21.570> the<00:03:22.670> actual<00:03:23.670> impeller<00:03:24.180> that's

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
happens the actual impeller that's

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.390 
happens the actual impeller that's
supposed<00:03:24.780> to<00:03:24.840> be<00:03:24.900> pumping<00:03:25.410> the<00:03:25.530> water<00:03:25.560> is<00:03:26.070> just

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
supposed to be pumping the water is just

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.780 
supposed to be pumping the water is just
freewheeling<00:03:27.390> so<00:03:28.140> that<00:03:28.350> created<00:03:28.770> a<00:03:29.010> situation

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
freewheeling so that created a situation

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.380 
freewheeling so that created a situation
why<00:03:30.290> the<00:03:31.290> vehicle<00:03:31.770> would<00:03:32.040> overheat<00:03:32.970> after

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
why the vehicle would overheat after

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.440 
why the vehicle would overheat after
only<00:03:33.720> a<00:03:34.260> few<00:03:34.680> miles<00:03:34.860> of<00:03:35.130> driving<00:03:35.400> the<00:03:36.090> impeller

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
only a few miles of driving the impeller

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.690 
only a few miles of driving the impeller
was<00:03:36.810> turning<00:03:37.440> and<00:03:37.590> probably<00:03:38.010> a<00:03:38.040> few<00:03:38.100> weeks<00:03:38.520> ago

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
was turning and probably a few weeks ago

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.940 
was turning and probably a few weeks ago
it<00:03:38.970> was<00:03:39.120> actually<00:03:39.630> still<00:03:39.870> frozen<00:03:40.200> onto<00:03:40.800> the

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
it was actually still frozen onto the

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.300 
it was actually still frozen onto the
shaft<00:03:41.550> or<00:03:42.000> pressed<00:03:42.330> onto<00:03:42.570> the<00:03:42.810> chef<00:03:43.310> somewhat

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
shaft or pressed onto the chef somewhat

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.250 
shaft or pressed onto the chef somewhat
better<00:03:44.550> than<00:03:44.700> it<00:03:44.970> is<00:03:45.180> now<00:03:45.420> but<00:03:46.020> what's

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
better than it is now but what's

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.410 
better than it is now but what's
occurred<00:03:46.560> here<00:03:46.980> is<00:03:47.130> it's<00:03:47.640> totally<00:03:47.940> free

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
occurred here is it's totally free

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.510 
occurred here is it's totally free
wheeled<00:03:48.660> now<00:03:48.930> so<00:03:49.500> there's<00:03:49.710> no<00:03:49.920> water<00:03:50.190> pump

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:50.520 
wheeled now so there's no water pump

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.000 
wheeled now so there's no water pump
pressure<00:03:51.360> at<00:03:51.570> all<00:03:51.690> anymore<00:03:52.020> so<00:03:52.320> this<00:03:52.470> vehicle

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
pressure at all anymore so this vehicle

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.020 
pressure at all anymore so this vehicle
went<00:03:53.280> from<00:03:53.610> a<00:03:53.820> slight<00:03:54.420> overheat<00:03:55.200> to<00:03:56.070> a<00:03:56.100> gradual

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
went from a slight overheat to a gradual

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.540 
went from a slight overheat to a gradual
overheat<00:03:58.020> till<00:03:58.260> finally<00:03:58.710> probably<00:03:59.430> in

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
overheat till finally probably in

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.790 
overheat till finally probably in
another<00:03:59.640> few<00:04:00.120> days<00:04:00.300> it<00:04:00.930> would<00:04:01.140> not<00:04:01.320> have<00:04:01.470> even

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 
another few days it would not have even

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.800 
another few days it would not have even
gone<00:04:02.400> a<00:04:02.460> couple<00:04:02.880> of<00:04:02.940> blocks<00:04:03.150> without<00:04:03.450> running

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
gone a couple of blocks without running

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.830 
gone a couple of blocks without running
into<00:04:04.260> the<00:04:04.380> red<00:04:05.120> so<00:04:06.120> this<00:04:06.300> is<00:04:06.480> a<00:04:06.510> situation

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
into the red so this is a situation

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.200 
into the red so this is a situation
where<00:04:07.530> when<00:04:07.740> you<00:04:07.890> purchase<00:04:08.310> a<00:04:08.430> new<00:04:08.460> water<00:04:08.850> pump

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:09.210 
where when you purchase a new water pump

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:11.870 
where when you purchase a new water pump
you'll<00:04:10.110> want<00:04:10.410> to<00:04:10.530> get<00:04:10.710> a<00:04:10.920> water<00:04:11.220> pump<00:04:11.520> that<00:04:11.580> has

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
you'll want to get a water pump that has

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.630 
you'll want to get a water pump that has
a<00:04:12.090> metal<00:04:12.570> impeller<00:04:12.930> an<00:04:13.260> iron<00:04:13.560> impeller<00:04:14.100> that

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
a metal impeller an iron impeller that

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.789 
a metal impeller an iron impeller that
is<00:04:14.850> pressed<00:04:15.240> onto<00:04:15.630> the<00:04:15.750> shaft<00:04:16.080> and<00:04:16.350> it<00:04:16.500> can't

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
is pressed onto the shaft and it can't

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.490 
is pressed onto the shaft and it can't
break<00:04:17.040> loose<00:04:17.100> like<00:04:17.580> this<00:04:17.609> in<00:04:18.390> my<00:04:18.720> opinion<00:04:19.230> it's

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
break loose like this in my opinion it's

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.240 
break loose like this in my opinion it's
just<00:04:19.799> a<00:04:20.549> design<00:04:21.359> flaw<00:04:21.860> now<00:04:22.860> that<00:04:23.100> we've

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
just a design flaw now that we've

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:24.850 
just a design flaw now that we've
discovered<00:04:23.700> what<00:04:24.060> the<00:04:24.210> problem<00:04:24.660> was

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
discovered what the problem was

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.960 
discovered what the problem was
replacing<00:04:25.860> the<00:04:25.950> water<00:04:26.130> pump<00:04:26.520> is<00:04:26.700> going<00:04:26.910> to

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
replacing the water pump is going to

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.670 
replacing the water pump is going to
have<00:04:27.180> to<00:04:27.330> be<00:04:27.480> the<00:04:27.780> solution<00:04:28.320> we've<00:04:28.470> already

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
have to be the solution we've already

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:29.670 
have to be the solution we've already
removed<00:04:29.220> the

we're going to replace it with a water

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:26.100 
we're going to replace it with a water
pump<00:05:22.599> that<00:05:23.080> has<00:05:23.110> a<00:05:23.320> cast<00:05:23.740> iron<00:05:24.360> impeller<00:05:25.360> which

loose<00:05:28.750> in<00:05:28.990> my<00:05:29.169> experience<00:05:29.770> so<00:05:30.430> you're<00:05:30.610> going

00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:30.849 
loose in my experience so you're going

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:32.999 
loose in my experience so you're going
to<00:05:30.910> end<00:05:31.090> up<00:05:31.240> with<00:05:31.419> a<00:05:31.479> better<00:05:31.840> water<00:05:32.169> pump<00:05:32.590> at

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:33.009 
to end up with a better water pump at

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:35.040 
to end up with a better water pump at
the<00:05:33.099> same<00:05:33.520> time<00:05:33.820> I<00:05:33.849> recommend<00:05:34.419> doing<00:05:34.930> the

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.050 
the same time I recommend doing the

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:38.100 
the same time I recommend doing the

that's<00:05:58.810> in<00:05:59.080> that<00:05:59.259> bearing<00:05:59.770> what<00:06:00.610> you<00:06:00.789> want<00:06:01.000> to

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:01.090 
that's in that bearing what you want to

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:03.480 
that's in that bearing what you want to
do<00:06:01.210> is<00:06:01.330> replace<00:06:01.479> that<00:06:02.050> at<00:06:02.229> the<00:06:02.349> same<00:06:02.620> time<00:06:02.979> that

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:03.490 
do is replace that at the same time that

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:06.029 
do is replace that at the same time that
you're<00:06:03.789> doing<00:06:04.090> your<00:06:04.240> belt<00:06:04.479> now<00:06:05.110> in<00:06:05.349> turn<00:06:05.740> if

00:06:06.029 --> 00:06:06.039 
you're doing your belt now in turn if

00:06:06.039 --> 00:06:08.700 
you're doing your belt now in turn if
you're<00:06:06.190> doing<00:06:06.430> a<00:06:06.639> belt<00:06:07.000> project<00:06:07.810> I<00:06:08.020> would<00:06:08.560> also

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:08.710 
you're doing a belt project I would also

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:11.129 
you're doing a belt project I would also
recommend<00:06:09.070> doing<00:06:09.759> a<00:06:09.849> water<00:06:10.090> pump<00:06:10.479> project

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:11.139 
recommend doing a water pump project

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:14.100 
recommend doing a water pump project
just<00:06:11.500> in<00:06:11.650> case<00:06:11.979> if<00:06:12.490> you<00:06:13.300> were<00:06:13.419> to<00:06:13.570> have<00:06:13.690> a<00:06:13.750> water

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:14.110 
just in case if you were to have a water

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:16.469 
just in case if you were to have a water
pump<00:06:14.440> leak<00:06:14.800> then<00:06:15.400> you'll<00:06:15.610> be<00:06:15.789> doing<00:06:16.120> these<00:06:16.240> two

00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:16.479 
pump leak then you'll be doing these two

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:19.560 
pump leak then you'll be doing these two
projects<00:06:17.169> in<00:06:17.289> a<00:06:17.740> staggered<00:06:18.280> fashion<00:06:18.909> do<00:06:19.419> it

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:19.570 
projects in a staggered fashion do it

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:21.719 
projects in a staggered fashion do it
once<00:06:19.870> you'll<00:06:20.349> save<00:06:20.650> some<00:06:20.979> money<00:06:21.099> on<00:06:21.250> the<00:06:21.520> labor

00:06:21.719 --> 00:06:21.729 
once you'll save some money on the labor

00:06:21.729 --> 00:06:23.760 
once you'll save some money on the labor
now<00:06:22.419> we're<00:06:22.599> going<00:06:22.720> to<00:06:22.780> go<00:06:22.960> over<00:06:22.990> back<00:06:23.409> to<00:06:23.620> the

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:23.770 
now we're going to go over back to the

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:26.480 
now we're going to go over back to the
TDI<00:06:24.099> and<00:06:24.550> I'll<00:06:24.970> show<00:06:25.210> you<00:06:25.270> how<00:06:25.449> to<00:06:25.479> make<00:06:25.780> a<00:06:25.810> tool
