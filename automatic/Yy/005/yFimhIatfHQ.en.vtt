there's<00:03:07.530> actually<00:03:07.920> multiple<00:03:08.100> printed<00:03:08.700> pieces

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
there's actually multiple printed pieces

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.060 
there's actually multiple printed pieces
really<00:03:09.690> nice<00:03:09.900> little<00:03:10.140> handle<00:03:10.290> and<00:03:10.620> some<00:03:10.800> other

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
really nice little handle and some other

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:12.620 
really nice little handle and some other
controls<00:03:11.580> there<00:03:11.790> which<00:03:11.940> is<00:03:11.970> really<00:03:12.360> cool

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
controls there which is really cool

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.930 
controls there which is really cool
there's<00:03:13.440> also<00:03:13.650> quite<00:03:14.010> a<00:03:14.130> lot<00:03:14.310> of<00:03:14.430> room<00:03:14.580> to<00:03:14.610> fit

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
there's also quite a lot of room to fit

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.180 
there's also quite a lot of room to fit
whichever<00:03:15.330> minifigure<00:03:15.900> you<00:03:16.140> want<00:03:16.440> to<00:03:16.740> sit<00:03:16.980> in

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
whichever minifigure you want to sit in

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.970 
whichever minifigure you want to sit in
the<00:03:17.970> pit<00:03:18.480> you<00:03:19.019> can<00:03:19.170> close<00:03:19.410> the<00:03:19.590> cockpit

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
the pit you can close the cockpit

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.940 
the pit you can close the cockpit
just<00:03:20.250> like<00:03:20.670> that<00:03:21.269> the<00:03:22.170> back<00:03:22.380> here<00:03:22.620> is<00:03:22.709> kind<00:03:22.890> of

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
just like that the back here is kind of

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.530 
just like that the back here is kind of
the<00:03:23.040> weirdest<00:03:23.489> play<00:03:23.670> feature<00:03:23.970> with<00:03:24.209> this<00:03:24.390> said

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
the weirdest play feature with this said

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.390 
the weirdest play feature with this said
there's<00:03:24.750> a<00:03:24.870> space<00:03:25.709> to<00:03:25.920> store<00:03:26.160> her

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
there's a space to store her

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.860 
there's a space to store her
double-sided<00:03:26.940> lightsaber<00:03:27.450> you<00:03:27.660> see<00:03:27.780> this

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
double-sided lightsaber you see this

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.300 
double-sided lightsaber you see this
little<00:03:27.930> orange<00:03:28.230> plate<00:03:28.680> you<00:03:28.830> just<00:03:29.010> lift<00:03:29.250> that

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
little orange plate you just lift that

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.640 
little orange plate you just lift that
up<00:03:29.430> and<00:03:29.700> there's<00:03:29.880> two<00:03:30.060> clips<00:03:30.450> it's<00:03:31.230> a<00:03:31.350> little

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
up and there's two clips it's a little

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.199 
up and there's two clips it's a little
bit<00:03:31.739> dorky<00:03:31.950> looking<00:03:32.280> I'm<00:03:32.580> not<00:03:32.610> a<00:03:32.730> huge<00:03:32.910> fan<00:03:33.000> of

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
bit dorky looking I'm not a huge fan of

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.300 
bit dorky looking I'm not a huge fan of
it<00:03:33.390> you<00:03:33.480> just<00:03:33.540> clip<00:03:33.930> the<00:03:34.080> lightsaber<00:03:34.470> blade<00:03:34.860> on

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
it you just clip the lightsaber blade on

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:36.920 
it you just clip the lightsaber blade on
like<00:03:35.670> that<00:03:35.880> and<00:03:35.940> then<00:03:36.269> you<00:03:36.390> get<00:03:36.510> the<00:03:36.690> other

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
like that and then you get the other

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.420 
like that and then you get the other
side<00:03:37.170> of<00:03:37.230> the<00:03:37.320> lightsaber<00:03:37.739> and<00:03:37.920> click<00:03:38.070> on<00:03:38.190> like

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
side of the lightsaber and click on like

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.520 
side of the lightsaber and click on like
that<00:03:38.580> then<00:03:39.300> that's<00:03:39.420> supposed<00:03:39.690> to<00:03:39.840> cover<00:03:40.260> it<00:03:40.440> up

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
that then that's supposed to cover it up

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:41.509 
that then that's supposed to cover it up
I<00:03:40.709> think<00:03:40.769> I<00:03:40.950> could<00:03:41.010> have<00:03:41.190> done<00:03:41.220> a<00:03:41.310> much<00:03:41.459> better

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
I think I could have done a much better

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.100 
I think I could have done a much better
job<00:03:41.790> with<00:03:42.150> that<00:03:42.209> may<00:03:42.570> just<00:03:42.600> put<00:03:42.900> it<00:03:42.989> on<00:03:43.049> the

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
job with that may just put it on the

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:44.870 
job with that may just put it on the
bottom<00:03:43.350> I<00:03:43.620> preferred<00:03:43.980> that<00:03:44.160> but<00:03:44.370> I<00:03:44.549> mean<00:03:44.730> it's

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
bottom I preferred that but I mean it's

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.370 
bottom I preferred that but I mean it's
still<00:03:45.090> nice<00:03:45.269> that<00:03:45.450> you<00:03:45.510> have<00:03:45.570> a<00:03:45.660> spot<00:03:46.019> to<00:03:46.170> put

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
still nice that you have a spot to put

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:47.630 
still nice that you have a spot to put
her<00:03:46.500> legs<00:03:46.709> ever<00:03:46.950> but<00:03:47.190> it<00:03:47.280> could<00:03:47.430> have<00:03:47.519> been<00:03:47.580> a

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
her legs ever but it could have been a

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.850 
her legs ever but it could have been a
better<00:03:47.970> design<00:03:48.450> now<00:03:49.080> the<00:03:49.140> main<00:03:49.380> feature<00:03:49.620> this

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
better design now the main feature this

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.259 
better design now the main feature this
is<00:03:49.980> going<00:03:50.130> to<00:03:50.190> kind<00:03:50.310> of<00:03:50.340> transform<00:03:50.640> from<00:03:51.120> an

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
is going to kind of transform from an

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:53.900 
is going to kind of transform from an
old-style<00:03:51.630> a<00:03:51.989> wing<00:03:52.320> to<00:03:52.769> an<00:03:52.860> old-style<00:03:53.160> x-wing

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
old-style a wing to an old-style x-wing

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.270 
old-style a wing to an old-style x-wing
this<00:03:54.480> is<00:03:54.660> by<00:03:55.110> far<00:03:55.380> the<00:03:55.440> coolest<00:03:55.709> feature<00:03:56.130> in

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
this is by far the coolest feature in

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.340 
this is by far the coolest feature in
this<00:03:56.430> set<00:03:56.640> so<00:03:56.670> what<00:03:56.970> you<00:03:57.120> do<00:03:57.360> is<00:03:57.570> you<00:03:57.900> grab<00:03:58.140> the

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
this set so what you do is you grab the

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:59.720 
this set so what you do is you grab the
wing<00:03:58.530> here<00:03:58.799> and<00:03:58.920> you<00:03:58.980> kind<00:03:59.220> of<00:03:59.280> rip<00:03:59.400> it<00:03:59.519> off<00:03:59.700> you

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
wing here and you kind of rip it off you

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.280 
wing here and you kind of rip it off you
can<00:04:00.000> see<00:04:00.120> there's<00:04:00.299> little<00:04:00.540> black<00:04:00.750> hook<00:04:01.080> right

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
can see there's little black hook right

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:02.600 
can see there's little black hook right
there<00:04:01.500> it's<00:04:01.650> going<00:04:01.739> to<00:04:01.830> hook<00:04:01.920> into<00:04:02.130> there<00:04:02.430> and

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
there it's going to hook into there and

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.449 
there it's going to hook into there and
then<00:04:03.360> we'll<00:04:04.110> flip<00:04:04.290> it<00:04:04.470> around<00:04:04.560> to<00:04:04.890> the<00:04:05.040> back

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
then we'll flip it around to the back

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:08.840 
then we'll flip it around to the back
there's<00:04:06.420> a<00:04:06.570> little<00:04:06.720> white<00:04:07.709> hook<00:04:08.070> right<00:04:08.519> there

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
there's a little white hook right there

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:10.610 
there's a little white hook right there
and<00:04:09.060> another<00:04:09.209> one<00:04:09.450> of<00:04:09.540> those<00:04:09.630> pieces<00:04:09.930> and<00:04:10.140> it

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
and another one of those pieces and it

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.890 
and another one of those pieces and it
comes<00:04:10.890> back<00:04:11.160> and<00:04:11.220> it<00:04:11.430> clips<00:04:11.760> on<00:04:12.000> to<00:04:12.720> right

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
comes back and it clips on to right

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.560 
comes back and it clips on to right
there<00:04:13.170> either<00:04:13.890> side<00:04:14.400> which<00:04:14.610> is<00:04:14.640> also<00:04:14.940> really

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.570 
there either side which is also really

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:18.289 
there either side which is also really
really<00:04:15.900> nice<00:04:16.470> it<00:04:17.280> transformation<00:04:17.729> you<00:04:18.030> to<00:04:18.150> to

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
really nice it transformation you to to

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:19.909 
really nice it transformation you to to
grab<00:04:18.479> the<00:04:18.630> guns<00:04:18.840> and<00:04:19.109> they'll<00:04:19.290> simply<00:04:19.650> just

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
grab the guns and they'll simply just

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:22.969 
grab the guns and they'll simply just
rotate<00:04:20.400> that<00:04:20.640> way<00:04:21.260> both<00:04:22.260> of<00:04:22.410> them<00:04:22.560> and<00:04:22.710> then

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
rotate that way both of them and then

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:25.640 
rotate that way both of them and then
you<00:04:23.130> have<00:04:23.340> the<00:04:23.820> strife<00:04:24.270> the<00:04:24.870> Starfighter<00:04:25.380> and

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
you have the strife the Starfighter and

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:26.360 
you have the strife the Starfighter and
it's

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
it's

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:27.740 
it's
I<00:04:26.400> don't<00:04:26.550> really<00:04:26.639> know<00:04:26.820> attack<00:04:27.150> mode<00:04:27.389> i<00:04:27.570> guess

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
I don't really know attack mode i guess

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.960 
I don't really know attack mode i guess
flight<00:04:28.050> mode<00:04:28.260> i'm<00:04:28.410> not<00:04:28.530> really<00:04:28.850> positive<00:04:29.850> on

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
flight mode i'm not really positive on

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:31.490 
flight mode i'm not really positive on
what<00:04:30.120> mode<00:04:30.330> this<00:04:30.479> is<00:04:30.690> but<00:04:30.840> it<00:04:30.930> looks<00:04:31.139> really

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
what mode this is but it looks really

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.560 
what mode this is but it looks really
cool<00:04:31.830> the<00:04:32.280> Starfighter<00:04:32.760> in<00:04:32.820> that<00:04:33.030> mode<00:04:33.270> and<00:04:33.479> my

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
cool the Starfighter in that mode and my

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.840 
cool the Starfighter in that mode and my
opinion<00:04:33.900> the<00:04:34.020> much<00:04:34.260> better<00:04:34.620> version<00:04:35.130> of<00:04:35.280> this

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:35.850 
opinion the much better version of this

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.540 
opinion the much better version of this
ship<00:04:36.120> it's<00:04:36.300> pretty<00:04:36.630> big<00:04:36.870> it's<00:04:37.199> not<00:04:37.380> huge<00:04:38.130> but

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
ship it's pretty big it's not huge but

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.550 
ship it's pretty big it's not huge but
it's<00:04:39.060> still<00:04:39.210> a<00:04:39.270> pretty<00:04:39.540> big<00:04:39.780> ship<00:04:40.050> normally

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
it's still a pretty big ship normally

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.080 
it's still a pretty big ship normally
not<00:04:40.740> a<00:04:40.770> huge<00:04:41.070> fan<00:04:41.340> of<00:04:41.400> all<00:04:41.610> the<00:04:41.699> flick<00:04:41.910> fire

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
not a huge fan of all the flick fire

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:43.640 
not a huge fan of all the flick fire
missiles<00:04:42.449> on<00:04:42.540> these<00:04:42.690> sets<00:04:42.930> nowadays<00:04:43.320> but<00:04:43.470> this

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
missiles on these sets nowadays but this

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.560 
missiles on these sets nowadays but this
one<00:04:43.830> actually<00:04:44.010> has<00:04:44.280> pretty<00:04:44.910> good<00:04:45.240> flick

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
one actually has pretty good flick

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:47.300 
one actually has pretty good flick
missiles<00:04:45.750> you<00:04:46.350> see<00:04:46.530> these<00:04:46.650> little<00:04:46.770> rods<00:04:47.100> on

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
missiles you see these little rods on

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.010 
missiles you see these little rods on
the<00:04:47.400> side<00:04:47.610> here<00:04:47.639> all<00:04:48.330> you<00:04:48.510> do<00:04:48.690> is<00:04:48.720> just<00:04:48.840> push

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
the side here all you do is just push

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.110 
the side here all you do is just push
those<00:04:49.410> in<00:04:49.710> and<00:04:49.949> it<00:04:50.250> will<00:04:50.370> fire<00:04:50.639> flick<00:04:50.940> missiles

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
those in and it will fire flick missiles

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.330 
those in and it will fire flick missiles
there<00:04:51.690> you<00:04:51.810> look<00:04:52.350> like<00:04:52.530> this<00:04:52.710> at<00:04:52.919> atlanta's

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
there you look like this at atlanta's

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.280 
there you look like this at atlanta's
green<00:04:53.639> color<00:04:53.910> and<00:04:54.240> they<00:04:54.479> fire<00:04:54.720> pretty<00:04:55.050> well

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:55.290 
green color and they fire pretty well

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:57.320 
green color and they fire pretty well
and<00:04:55.530> it's<00:04:56.160> you<00:04:56.340> don't<00:04:56.669> have<00:04:56.790> to<00:04:56.880> flick<00:04:57.210> it

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
and it's you don't have to flick it

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:58.610 
and it's you don't have to flick it
yourself<00:04:57.690> which<00:04:57.810> I<00:04:57.900> really<00:04:58.080> like<00:04:58.320> and<00:04:58.500> there's

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
yourself which I really like and there's

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:59.870 
yourself which I really like and there's
four<00:04:58.860> of<00:04:58.889> them<00:04:58.979> so<00:04:59.190> that's<00:04:59.250> actually<00:04:59.520> not<00:04:59.820> a

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
four of them so that's actually not a

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.570 
four of them so that's actually not a
bad<00:04:59.970> play<00:05:00.449> feature<00:05:00.720> the<00:05:01.590> side<00:05:01.830> here<00:05:02.160> kind<00:05:02.520> of

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
bad play feature the side here kind of

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.010 
bad play feature the side here kind of
look<00:05:02.669> a<00:05:02.699> little<00:05:02.850> bit<00:05:03.030> funky<00:05:03.389> I<00:05:03.419> don't<00:05:03.690> know<00:05:03.780> why

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
look a little bit funky I don't know why

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:05.750 
look a little bit funky I don't know why
there's<00:05:04.289> all<00:05:04.440> this<00:05:04.650> like<00:05:04.830> random<00:05:05.280> I<00:05:05.370> seem<00:05:05.580> like

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:05.760 
there's all this like random I seem like

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.070 
there's all this like random I seem like
there's<00:05:05.970> a<00:05:06.030> lot<00:05:06.210> of<00:05:06.240> these<00:05:06.510> kind<00:05:06.840> of<00:05:06.870> color

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
there's a lot of these kind of color

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.350 
there's a lot of these kind of color
pieces<00:05:07.350> on<00:05:07.590> the<00:05:07.740> bottom<00:05:08.100> there<00:05:08.310> no<00:05:08.850> landing

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
pieces on the bottom there no landing

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.000 
pieces on the bottom there no landing
gear<00:05:09.539> but<00:05:09.690> you<00:05:09.750> had<00:05:09.900> these<00:05:10.050> brown<00:05:10.380> parts<00:05:10.830> and

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010 
gear but you had these brown parts and

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:13.010 
gear but you had these brown parts and
browns<00:05:11.220> kind<00:05:11.550> of<00:05:11.639> stands<00:05:11.850> out<00:05:12.060> not<00:05:12.720> really

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
browns kind of stands out not really

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.480 
browns kind of stands out not really
working<00:05:13.260> with<00:05:13.560> the<00:05:13.650> color<00:05:13.860> scheme<00:05:14.039> so<00:05:14.310> that's

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490 
working with the color scheme so that's

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:16.400 
working with the color scheme so that's
really<00:05:14.820> weird<00:05:14.940> so<00:05:15.539> flat<00:05:15.810> awarded<00:05:16.229> for<00:05:16.350> the

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:16.410 
really weird so flat awarded for the

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:18.379 
really weird so flat awarded for the
Republic<00:05:16.949> striker<00:05:17.280> class<00:05:17.610> Starfighter<00:05:18.150> I

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:18.389 
Republic striker class Starfighter I

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:20.719 
Republic striker class Starfighter I
really<00:05:18.900> like<00:05:19.080> this<00:05:19.289> set<00:05:19.560> it's<00:05:19.800> not<00:05:20.010> perfect<00:05:20.580> I

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:20.729 
really like this set it's not perfect I

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:22.490 
really like this set it's not perfect I
think<00:05:20.970> my<00:05:21.060> main<00:05:21.270> problem<00:05:21.510> is<00:05:21.780> it's<00:05:22.020> five

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
think my main problem is it's five

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.409 
think my main problem is it's five
dollars<00:05:22.860> of<00:05:23.010> a<00:05:23.070> price<00:05:23.310> for<00:05:24.030> tea<00:05:24.180> would<00:05:24.300> have

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:24.419 
dollars of a price for tea would have

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:26.300 
dollars of a price for tea would have
been<00:05:24.510> perfect<00:05:24.990> 45<00:05:25.440> a<00:05:25.470> little<00:05:25.889> bit<00:05:25.979> too<00:05:26.130> much

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.310 
been perfect 45 a little bit too much

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.550 
been perfect 45 a little bit too much
and<00:05:26.639> it's<00:05:26.669> just<00:05:27.449> not<00:05:27.570> a<00:05:27.600> recognizable<00:05:28.139> vehicle

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 
and it's just not a recognizable vehicle

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:29.990 
and it's just not a recognizable vehicle
you<00:05:28.680> know<00:05:28.800> I<00:05:28.830> don't<00:05:29.010> really<00:05:29.250> I've<00:05:29.550> watched<00:05:29.820> the

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 
you know I don't really I've watched the

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.490 
you know I don't really I've watched the
trailers<00:05:30.450> and<00:05:30.660> I<00:05:30.720> played<00:05:30.930> a<00:05:30.960> little<00:05:31.200> bit<00:05:31.410> of

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:31.500 
trailers and I played a little bit of

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.080 
trailers and I played a little bit of
the<00:05:31.650> old<00:05:31.680> republic<00:05:31.889> game<00:05:32.280> but<00:05:32.580> I've<00:05:32.760> never

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.090 
the old republic game but I've never

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:35.029 
the old republic game but I've never
really<00:05:33.419> gotten<00:05:33.450> into<00:05:33.750> it<00:05:34.050> or<00:05:34.139> anything<00:05:34.320> so<00:05:35.010> you

00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:35.039 
really gotten into it or anything so you

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:36.620 
really gotten into it or anything so you
know<00:05:35.340> I<00:05:35.370> don't<00:05:35.520> know<00:05:35.789> too<00:05:35.849> much<00:05:36.270> about<00:05:36.330> this

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:36.630 
know I don't know too much about this

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:38.659 
know I don't know too much about this
vehicle<00:05:36.990> just<00:05:37.139> on<00:05:37.260> a<00:05:37.289> recognizable<00:05:38.130> vehicle<00:05:38.550> I

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:38.669 
vehicle just on a recognizable vehicle I

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:39.680 
vehicle just on a recognizable vehicle I
think<00:05:38.820> it's<00:05:38.940> that's<00:05:39.120> going<00:05:39.240> to<00:05:39.300> be<00:05:39.389> really

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:39.690 
think it's that's going to be really

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:41.900 
think it's that's going to be really
cool<00:05:40.020> once<00:05:40.680> i<00:05:40.860> get<00:05:41.039> the<00:05:41.190> Sith<00:05:41.490> fury<00:05:41.729> class

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:41.910
