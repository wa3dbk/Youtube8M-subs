00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.769
 facts facts facts because the nordschleife 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.450
 in the 80s as too unsafe for 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.460
 I was classified the formula one 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.520
 should we have to remember the 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.340
 niki lauda accident 1976 and so on 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.810
 For the formula 1 series for now only 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.430
 still on the hockenheimring 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.720
 you wanted to get the formula 1 back in 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.579
 The Eifel therefore became the 1981-1984 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.469
 built former grand prix track 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.739
 at that time 4.5 kilometers long 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:40.350
 now in 2003, the new route will open 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.559
 including mercedes benz arena has today 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.570
 a distance of 5,148 kilometers the 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.700
 distance is between 10 and 25 meters 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.039
 wide we have seven left and ten 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.930
 right turn enough run-off zones and 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.910
 pebble beds and accordingly we have 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.340
 a modern and safe race course 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:00.140
 and of course a possibility too 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.140
 to move normal vehicles here 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.570
 Welcome to the box 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.280
 of the nürburgring here have the 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.570
 race teams during the event 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.310
 base here the drivers come to 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.500
 refuel for repairs or as a 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.600
 tire change and in the box had to 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.600
 but at all events quasi the 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.799
 drive the entire route 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.069
 we are here for such an event now 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:26.679
 driving straight with the seat leon cupra 280 

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:29.469
 and here behind the pit lane begins 

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:32.549
 now at the same time the first round and 

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:35.649
 Although it's right after that 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.450
 So-called yokohama is great though 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:40.929
 It 's a curve combination on grand 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.909
 prix will reach the adac in 24 hours 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:44.829
 is driven and after the 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:46.270
 start-target straight here is directly from 

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:47.470
 a high speed strong 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.220
 slowed down then it goes right 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:53.079
 and then it goes in 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.819
 direction mercedes arena mercedes arena 

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:57.459
 in march just here has every turn 

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:58.959
 a special name and the 

00:01:57.459 --> 00:02:00.909
 Mercedes-arena is definitely the one 

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:01.299
 trickiest section of the complete 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:03.429
 route 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:04.270
 who has found a perfect line here 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:05.429
 is really already an experienced 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.179
 racer 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:09.910
 you have the right speed 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:13.560
 meet meet and of course 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.560
 partly the extension 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.069
 Christmas goose here the 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:33.269
 müllenbachschleife the lowest 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:36.329
 point of the track and you can also as 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:39.870
 also rent a round of the course 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:41.670
 round 3 but the new loop is 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.290
 also because of the guardrails and through the 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.700
 tight track guidance here as a small one 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.829
 Monaco is called garbage is the 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.299
 round course after the müllenbachschleife 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:51.269
 it goes with a 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:53.730
 That's why they call left-right combinations 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:54.810
 the whole schumacher s is there 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.760
 Of course, the German record world champion 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.519
 Michael Schumacher we all everything 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:02.180
 good wishes of the namesake and since 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:06.530
 2007 is this left right combination 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.530
 as schumacher it in the country 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:23.220
 after schumacher it is then 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.769
 directly in the fastest section of the 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:29.280
 Combi route we have a top speed 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:30.870
 passage that is after turn 12 and there 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.790
 then it goes to the advent bow pure 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.200
 and that is a full legal course the 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.239
 fastest turn on the complete 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.859
 Grand Prix track and there then reach 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:40.079
 the driver also topspeed in the rule 

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:42.269
 topspeed that is the seat leon 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:43.560
 for example, the drivers drive the euro cup 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:45.989
 an average speed of 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.260
 140 km h so could imagine about 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:50.430
 how high speeds because as 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.400
 After the aqua in arc, it goes into the 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.680
 Granddaughter complains bully who can 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.090
 Two variants drive when the close he 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.920
 square design for example the 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.900
 formula 1 or further cut 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.519
 Lighter motorcycle variant as well 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.930
 at the 12 hour race comes to use 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:06.000
 we were now here at derek know 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.790
 execution that means strong braking 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.799
 left out on the right and here behind 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.420
 would be the entrance again 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:14.489
 we were ready for the pit lane 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.590
 continue on start and finish last turn 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:17.430
 since bmw can make advertising here 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.410
 as long as they want 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.359
 that's still the coca for me 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.729
 Cola turn then it goes straight city 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:26.130
 stand on the left we have the grandstands on 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:29.340
 the lodges are on the right side 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.870
 of course the pit lane so now 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.430
 I really shut my mouth shut 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:36.139
 look at another round 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:37.889
 com prix course we would like to have, of course 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:39.360
 I admit that 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:41.750
 if we like to travel faster 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:44.400
 but has been in the course of one 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:46.949
 Customer event not possible 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.360
 Thank you at seat Germany leads 

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:50.669
 make that possible for a red 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.560
 Camera round turn customer and hope 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:54.210
