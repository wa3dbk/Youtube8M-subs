00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.850
 there are many to all and we are back with 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.080
 a new one and of card 5 and in this case 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.960
 We are with one of the new vehicles 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.550
 of the new dirty money dlc part 2 already 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.190
 you know that I have previously uploaded the 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.500
 two vehicles tuning what would be 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.880
 then the 20 and the other that also 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.890
 has really liked the SUV that 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.390
 right now I do not remember the name but 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.740
 now you are going to see that we put here the 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.930
 ball of internet and today we will see 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.250
 what would the name of the vehicle be 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.660
 because as I say it's called inhabited now 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.590
 same but you have it here that the 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.570
 it 's a car and it has also 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.519
 quite liked that is the brawer and 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.679
 then the one that we're going to have now would be 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.210
 the rocket inventory that is the new one that 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.180
 they have gotten it called ccoo that is going 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.530
 cfe this car moves a lot I did not know 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.300
 very well what color to put now you go to 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.040
 see that I've put at the end one that 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.960
 cool pretty good I guess the magazine 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.149
 of the miniature but still as I say 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.329
 this car is really cool, it's a car 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.039
 as well as old and a car a tad of 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.739
 modern not very much the truth but yes that 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.270
 it's pretty cool as I say this car 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.039
 fact would be the third of the ones that most 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.449
 They liked the ones he has put in because 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.920
 the other is a little more normal and the 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.690
 I do not really like that, that's why 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.250
 I'm not going to upload it because as I say 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.199
 does not have much to do but this one does 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.000
 I liked it has convinced me when I 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.990
 been tuning so he decided to upload it 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.360
 for you to see 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.610
 the things that they have and then you do not know if 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.110
 buy it or not and with this video the 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.689
 I really like to upload it already 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.580
 that I can help you choose between what 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.890
 buy car since you imagine that 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.299
 you only have then I do not know two million 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.979
 if you can only buy a vehicle like this 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.330
 that with this video I think that also 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.920
 can help us a lot so you can see 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.110
 the little things that can be put on it 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.030
 I'm going to put no engine or turbo or anything 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.130
 of that I'm just going to put the pieces 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.720
 so you can see how it would look and feel 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.979
 as you see here the ailerons the 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.259
 it's true that the spoiler is not very noticeable 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.090
 this would be here the tail spoiler of 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.740
 duck and the truth that has been that has 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.420
 liked and will continue pretty any 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.740
 car like this and now how are you going to see it 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.959
 let's put the windows the 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.060
 window I do not like whole black 

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:50.610
 because because as you can see the part of 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.049
 ahead, that's how it's like, 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.479
 transparent of all then I do not 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.250
 I like how the form looks if I put it on 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.200
 that would be black the east side of the 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.909
 window here as you see finally I 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.039
 I decide to choose a color after having 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.289
 been a good time of cortaditos for 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:06.030
 that you see what color I put him because 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:08.009
 It would be this orange and now here we are going 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.229
 to put on the face of one so clear 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.670
 to make it look brighter 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.410
 car and mole more then in the secondary 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.770
 it happened to me exactly the same I did not know very 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.600
 all right 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.790
 what color to put on him because he wanted to put the 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.370
 blue car clarito that I have a car 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.810
 tuned like this in blue but I 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.280
 I agreed that I had the blue car like this 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.410
 who decided not to put the blue and I've 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.240
 put in orange that I think I do not have 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.910
 none so I think it's left 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.470
 pretty good, it would just look good too 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.480
 if I put the target but decided 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.550
 put on the blue night this midnight 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.800
 and the truth that I do not know I like has 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.120
 liked at the end like how it was and 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.190
 as I'm seeing around here now we're going to 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.780
 put on wheels the wheels me 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.400
 it happens exactly like I did not know which one 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.930
 put so that it would stay fine then to 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.520
 final already against some that yes that 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.110
 they liked it and that I think it has been 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.300
 pretty good so the car now you will see 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.790
 when I finish tunnel what is left 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.950
 but as I say it's pretty good this 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.680
 car sincerely the dlc has not been 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.820
 bad has been in the middle, so to speak 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.760
 he has not been in a pretty dlc 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:05.010
 normalito since it is basically 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.140
 what they usually put in the 13 4 cars 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:10.320
 finally a motorcycle that if a boat 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.750
 that if two weapons and a little clothing and 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:15.240
 honestly I would like that 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.890
 face a dlc as he did with 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.450
 the robberies to banks a dlc quite 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.750
 great but good the fact that they have 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.270
 got in the last month and this month 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.160
 tlc that's pretty good they come back 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.810
 to the cane I do not know if now in August 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.970
 they'll put another one back I doubt it enough 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.350
 I suppose it will be a while until 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.930
 that they put another dlc like 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:35.090
 they did with stilt drinks and 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.980
 I do not remember anymore that it was the last one 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.240
 until then, he spent a lot of time 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.400
 until they have got what would be the 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.870
 dirty money part a guide part 2 and 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.400
 the truth is that as I say that is cool 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.670
 pretty or if that 's at the beginning 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.980
 we had a bed it's a new dlc and that 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.380
 it was what we liked so much but good 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:54.080
 little by little to see if they put something like 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.430
 casinos or something that suits you like that 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.140
 that I think we almost get to put 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.940
 in the future I hope not too late 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.440
 but that I put it a soon that the truth 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.000
 that we are quite especially now for 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.489
 the little summer so nothing like I'm 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.020
 seeing like that would be the car as I have 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:07.430
 left at the end I like it 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.720
 I sincerely believe that blank too 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.370
 would have been fine what would be the 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.260
 second color leaving a little with the 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.700
 comments that seem to you or 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.200
 as you have seen it unites two and you have 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.269
 bought and above all also what 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.040
 it seems like if you liked it or if 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:20.390
 you wait more so nothing you are agusta 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.769
 now I would say a lot if the video 

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:24.640
 share it with our new friends 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:24.640
 goodbye incidents
