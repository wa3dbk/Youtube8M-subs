at<00:03:51.780> 270<00:03:52.500> 9.99<00:03:54.860> respectively

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
at 270 9.99 respectively

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.410 
at 270 9.99 respectively
I<00:03:56.960> think<00:03:57.960> that's<00:03:58.080> low<00:03:58.440> for<00:03:58.680> a<00:03:58.740> phone<00:03:58.920> like<00:03:59.160> this

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
I think that's low for a phone like this

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.700 
I think that's low for a phone like this
dollars<00:04:00.420> will<00:04:00.540> come<00:04:00.720> on<00:04:00.840> at<00:04:00.930> least<00:04:00.960> like<00:04:01.200> 300

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:01.710 
dollars will come on at least like 300

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:04.330 
dollars will come on at least like 300
350<00:04:02.190> which<00:04:03.180> had<00:04:03.390> been<00:04:03.540> you<00:04:03.960> know

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
350 which had been you know

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.550 
350 which had been you know
understandable<00:04:05.450> but<00:04:06.450> didn't<00:04:06.840> stay<00:04:07.410> wet

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
understandable but didn't stay wet

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.220 
understandable but didn't stay wet
through<00:04:07.590> under<00:04:08.340> $200<00:04:08.910> phone<00:04:09.210> guys<00:04:09.990> it's

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
through under $200 phone guys it's

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:11.900 
through under $200 phone guys it's
better<00:04:10.440> than<00:04:10.680> any<00:04:10.980> other<00:04:11.100> phone<00:04:11.460> I<00:04:11.490> think<00:04:11.670> it's

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
better than any other phone I think it's

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.930 
better than any other phone I think it's
out<00:04:12.120> on<00:04:12.150> around<00:04:12.690> $200<00:04:13.470> only<00:04:14.280> for<00:04:14.460> not<00:04:14.610> to<00:04:14.730> think

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
out on around $200 only for not to think

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.229 
out on around $200 only for not to think
it's<00:04:15.060> probably<00:04:15.360> better<00:04:15.480> than<00:04:15.660> these<00:04:15.960> is<00:04:17.239> it

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
it's probably better than these is it

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:19.580 
it's probably better than these is it
surrounding<00:04:18.810> all<00:04:19.080> arranged

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
surrounding all arranged

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.480 
surrounding all arranged
hmm<00:04:20.370> it's<00:04:20.760> hard<00:04:21.210> I<00:04:21.590> think<00:04:22.590> the<00:04:22.710> oneplus<00:04:23.190> one

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
hmm it's hard I think the oneplus one

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.340 
hmm it's hard I think the oneplus one
probably<00:04:23.970> is<00:04:24.060> the<00:04:24.150> only<00:04:24.270> sonís<00:04:24.690> around<00:04:24.930> at<00:04:25.230> all

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
probably is the only sonís around at all

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.390 
probably is the only sonís around at all
it's<00:04:25.590> probably<00:04:25.740> better<00:04:26.100> than<00:04:26.220> these

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
it's probably better than these

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.129 
it's probably better than these
and<00:04:27.790> even<00:04:28.060> then<00:04:28.180> you<00:04:28.210> still<00:04:28.570> getting<00:04:28.810> a<00:04:28.930> real

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:29.139 
and even then you still getting a real

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:32.340
