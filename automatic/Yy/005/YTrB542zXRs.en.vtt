00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
accessories first let's have a good look

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:10.130 
accessories first let's have a good look
at<00:00:58.920> them<00:01:04.760> and<00:01:07.909> what<00:01:08.909> really<00:01:09.180> attracted<00:01:09.689> me<00:01:09.750> to

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
at them and what really attracted me to

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.000 
at them and what really attracted me to
the<00:01:10.439> figure<00:01:10.770> itself<00:01:10.920> is<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.939> metallic<00:01:12.720> blue

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.010 
the figure itself is the metallic blue

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.359 
the figure itself is the metallic blue
metallic<00:01:14.010> red<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:14.820> even<00:01:15.680> you<00:01:16.680> can<00:01:16.830> argue<00:01:17.009> it's

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
metallic red and even you can argue it's

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.940 
metallic red and even you can argue it's
a<00:01:17.460> metallic<00:01:18.390> kind<00:01:18.600> of<00:01:18.689> white<00:01:18.960> so<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.770> red

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
a metallic kind of white so the red

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.700 
a metallic kind of white so the red
white<00:01:20.159> and<00:01:20.280> blue<00:01:20.490> metallic<00:01:21.090> really<00:01:21.659> drew<00:01:22.530> my

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
white and blue metallic really drew my

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.520 
white and blue metallic really drew my
eye<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.920> this<00:01:23.310> figure<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:23.759> then<00:01:24.299> it<00:01:24.630> contrasts

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
eye to this figure and then it contrasts

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.590 
eye to this figure and then it contrasts
nicely<00:01:25.710> with<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.400> rest<00:01:26.970> of<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.150> figure<00:01:27.420> which

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.440 
way that it's holding it there's not a
whole<00:02:18.890> lot<00:02:19.100> of<00:02:19.160> friction<00:02:19.490> keeping<00:02:20.030> it<00:02:20.180> between

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
whole lot of friction keeping it between

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.290 
whole lot of friction keeping it between
the<00:02:21.050> fingers<00:02:21.440> so<00:02:21.680> if<00:02:22.550> you<00:02:22.700> turn<00:02:22.910> it<00:02:23.030> upside

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
the fingers so if you turn it upside

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.940 
the fingers so if you turn it upside
down<00:02:23.330> it's<00:02:23.810> gonna<00:02:23.900> fall<00:02:24.140> out<00:02:24.200> in<00:02:25.150> contrast<00:02:26.150> the

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
down it's gonna fall out in contrast the

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.800 
down it's gonna fall out in contrast the
handle<00:02:27.950> of<00:02:28.130> the<00:02:28.250> gun<00:02:28.280> fits<00:02:28.790> very<00:02:29.210> very<00:02:29.540> nicely

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
handle of the gun fits very very nicely

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.780 
handle of the gun fits very very nicely
into<00:02:30.350> the<00:02:30.560> hand<00:02:30.800> you<00:02:30.980> can<00:02:31.130> see<00:02:31.280> how<00:02:31.400> it<00:02:31.430> just

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
into the hand you can see how it just

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.470 
into the hand you can see how it just
really<00:02:32.750> is<00:02:32.780> a<00:02:32.990> snug<00:02:33.440> fit<00:02:33.470> and<00:02:34.010> the<00:02:34.970> size<00:02:35.210> of<00:02:35.420> the

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
really is a snug fit and the size of the

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.480 
really is a snug fit and the size of the
gun<00:02:35.720> in<00:02:36.050> relation<00:02:36.530> to<00:02:36.680> the<00:02:36.860> hand<00:02:37.160> and<00:02:37.430> the

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490 
gun in relation to the hand and the

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.900 
gun in relation to the hand and the
figure<00:02:37.910> is<00:02:38.150> correct<00:02:38.690> I<00:02:38.810> believe<00:02:39.370> now<00:02:40.370> one<00:02:40.880> of

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
figure is correct I believe now one of

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.170 
figure is correct I believe now one of
the<00:02:41.060> nicer<00:02:41.390> features<00:02:41.690> of<00:02:41.900> this<00:02:42.110> figure<00:02:42.800> is<00:02:43.010> the

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
the nicer features of this figure is the

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.390 
the nicer features of this figure is the
utility<00:02:44.180> belt<00:02:44.720> as<00:02:44.960> you<00:02:45.110> can<00:02:45.260> see<00:02:45.440> here<00:02:45.740> you<00:02:46.250> can

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
utility belt as you can see here you can

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.610 
utility belt as you can see here you can
see<00:02:46.550> some<00:02:46.580> pouches<00:02:47.210> you<00:02:48.050> actually<00:02:48.470> have<00:02:48.590> a
