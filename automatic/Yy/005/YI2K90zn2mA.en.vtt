applications
and<00:01:33.840> this<00:01:34.840> is<00:01:34.990> different<00:01:35.380> yeah<00:01:36.070> so<00:01:36.280> this<00:01:36.370> is

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
and this is different yeah so this is

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.570 
and this is different yeah so this is
our<00:01:36.760> system<00:01:37.450> 6440<00:01:38.409> it's<00:01:38.650> kind<00:01:38.860> of<00:01:38.950> we<00:01:39.310> like<00:01:39.430> to

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
our system 6440 it's kind of we like to

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.490 
our system 6440 it's kind of we like to
call<00:01:39.729> it<00:01:39.850> our<00:01:39.970> Swiss<00:01:40.270> Army<00:01:40.660> knife<00:01:40.870> type

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
call it our Swiss Army knife type

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.480 
call it our Swiss Army knife type
development<00:01:42.750> so<00:01:43.750> this<00:01:43.990> is<00:01:44.140> a<00:01:44.170> more<00:01:45.010> features

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
development so this is a more features

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.690 
development so this is a more features
it<00:01:45.760> has<00:01:45.910> the<00:01:46.090> Miffy<00:01:46.390> DSi<00:01:46.869> display<00:01:47.520> it<00:01:48.520> comes

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
it has the Miffy DSi display it comes

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.719 
it has the Miffy DSi display it comes
with<00:01:48.820> batteries<00:01:48.970> sensor<00:01:49.840> module<00:01:50.580> comes<00:01:51.580> with

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
with batteries sensor module comes with

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:54.230 
with batteries sensor module comes with
a<00:01:51.790> camera<00:01:52.150> adapter<00:01:52.390> based<00:01:52.960> on<00:01:53.140> an<00:01:53.259> omni<00:01:53.560> vision

so it's kind of fully featured with a
lot<00:01:58.660> more<00:01:58.840> BIOS<00:01:59.200> and<00:01:59.650> based<00:02:00.009> on<00:02:00.190> the<00:02:00.310> q7<00:02:02.310> so<00:02:03.570> how

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
lot more BIOS and based on the q7 so how

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.440 
lot more BIOS and based on the q7 so how
much<00:02:04.720> is<00:02:04.840> that<00:02:04.960> this<00:02:05.800> one<00:02:06.009> is<00:02:06.160> a<00:02:06.190> little<00:02:06.450> more

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
much is that this one is a little more

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.410 
much is that this one is a little more
expensive<00:02:07.690> it<00:02:08.200> sits<00:02:08.619> around<00:02:09.000> $5.99<00:02:10.000> but<00:02:10.300> right

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
expensive it sits around $5.99 but right

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.009 
working on this product line so you make
only<00:02:32.709> qualcomm<00:02:33.670> based<00:02:33.850> development<00:02:34.780> boards

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
only qualcomm based development boards

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:37.890 
only qualcomm based development boards
we<00:02:35.590> do<00:02:35.739> we<00:02:36.010> also<00:02:36.160> do<00:02:36.370> Intel<00:02:36.820> Atom<00:02:36.970> boards<00:02:37.600> and

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
we do we also do Intel Atom boards and

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.320 
we do we also do Intel Atom boards and
we<00:02:38.049> also<00:02:38.170> do<00:02:38.440> a<00:02:38.650> VM<00:02:39.010> PCIe<00:02:39.430> networking<00:02:40.000> cards

we also do a VM PCIe networking cards

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.600 
we also do a VM PCIe networking cards
but<00:02:41.140> this<00:02:41.290> is<00:02:41.440> a<00:02:41.470> huge<00:02:42.010> part<00:02:42.250> of<00:02:42.310> our<00:02:42.400> business

or
so<00:02:44.430> how<00:02:44.520> many<00:02:44.580> boys<00:02:44.820> do<00:02:45.030> so<00:02:45.620> we<00:02:46.620> saw<00:02:46.830> a<00:02:47.160> lot<00:02:47.220> of

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
so how many boys do so we saw a lot of

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.560 
so how many boys do so we saw a lot of
developing<00:02:48.240> that<00:02:48.300> these<00:02:48.890> units<00:02:49.890> are<00:02:50.420> one<00:02:51.420> to

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
developing that these units are one to

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.530 
developing that these units are one to
two<00:02:51.780> units<00:02:52.200> that<00:02:52.410> we<00:02:52.530> sell<00:02:52.740> the<00:02:52.890> customers<00:02:53.540> and

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
two units that we sell the customers and

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.130 
two units that we sell the customers and
then<00:02:54.720> we<00:02:54.960> can<00:02:55.470> sell<00:02:55.740> more<00:02:56.460> mostly<00:02:57.240> into<00:02:57.540> custom

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
then we can sell more mostly into custom

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.770 
then we can sell more mostly into custom
designs<00:02:58.500> so<00:02:59.070> we<00:02:59.190> have<00:02:59.430> a<00:02:59.790> lot<00:03:00.240> of<00:03:00.270> different

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
designs so we have a lot of different

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.840 
designs so we have a lot of different
applications<00:03:01.320> a<00:03:01.470> lot<00:03:01.620> of<00:03:01.770> different<00:03:02.070> projects

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
applications a lot of different projects

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.690 
applications a lot of different projects
that<00:03:02.940> we<00:03:03.150> do<00:03:03.330> but<00:03:04.230> how<00:03:04.680> many<00:03:04.740> do<00:03:05.310> you<00:03:05.370> sell<00:03:05.520> like
