submachine<00:00:39.480> gun<00:00:39.719> in<00:00:39.989> my<00:00:40.469> opinion<00:00:40.739> submachine

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
submachine gun in my opinion submachine

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.010 
submachine gun in my opinion submachine
guns<00:00:41.640> are<00:00:41.820> kind<00:00:42.059> of<00:00:42.149> underpowered<00:00:42.600> in<00:00:42.870> this

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
guns are kind of underpowered in this

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.850 
guns are kind of underpowered in this
game<00:00:43.550> so<00:00:44.550> it<00:00:45.480> is<00:00:45.719> kind<00:00:45.960> of<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.140> nice<00:00:46.289> break<00:00:46.590> from

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
game so it is kind of a nice break from

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.650 
game so it is kind of a nice break from
most<00:00:47.550> of<00:00:47.730> them<00:00:47.850> most<00:00:48.059> of<00:00:48.180> them<00:00:48.300> seem<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.570> be

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
most of them most of them seem to be

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.369 
most of them most of them seem to be
like<00:00:48.840> mid<00:00:49.110> damage<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:49.829> low<00:00:50.570> medium<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:52.110> high

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
like mid damage to low medium to high

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.439 
like mid damage to low medium to high
rates<00:00:52.649> of<00:00:52.800> fire<00:00:52.860> kind<00:00:53.520> of<00:00:53.610> sub<00:00:53.789> machine<00:00:54.090> gun<00:00:54.270> so

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
rates of fire kind of sub machine gun so

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.990 
rates of fire kind of sub machine gun so
this<00:00:54.629> one<00:00:54.840> is<00:00:54.989> actually<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.440> high<00:00:55.680> damage<00:00:56.010> low

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
this one is actually a high damage low

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.910 
this one is actually a high damage low
rate<00:00:57.239> of<00:00:57.390> fire<00:00:57.629> submachine<00:00:58.410> gun<00:00:58.590> which<00:00:58.739> is<00:00:58.890> a

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
rate of fire submachine gun which is a

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.910 
rate of fire submachine gun which is a
great<00:00:59.160> break<00:00:59.460> from<00:00:59.760> again<00:01:00.660> most<00:01:01.020> of<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.350> the

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
mg42 in this video but I did test them

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.789 
mg42 in this video but I did test them
out<00:01:33.540> in<00:01:33.689> a<00:01:33.750> couple<00:01:33.900> games<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.380> I<00:01:34.619> found

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
out in a couple games and I found

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.170 
out in a couple games and I found
they're<00:01:34.950> actually<00:01:35.220> pretty<00:01:35.340> powerful<00:01:35.759> as<00:01:35.970> well

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
they're actually pretty powerful as well

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.920 
they're actually pretty powerful as well
the<00:01:36.450> mg<00:01:37.079> 42<00:01:37.560> I<00:01:38.150> actually<00:01:39.150> used<00:01:39.630> it<00:01:39.750> as<00:01:39.900> a

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
the mg 42 I actually used it as a

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.480 
the mg 42 I actually used it as a
modified<00:01:40.470> version<00:01:40.500> i'm<00:01:41.040> not<00:01:41.159> sure<00:01:41.340> i<00:01:41.369> think

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
modified version i'm not sure i think

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.389 
modified version i'm not sure i think
it's<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.790> mg34<00:01:42.329> with<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.439> light<00:01:43.950> barrel<00:01:44.280> is

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
it's the mg34 with the light barrel is

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.490 
it's the mg34 with the light barrel is
actually<00:01:44.759> quite<00:01:44.909> fun<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.270> use<00:01:45.540> you<00:01:45.930> get<00:01:46.110> lots

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
actually quite fun to use you get lots

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.950 
actually quite fun to use you get lots
of<00:01:46.649> accuracy<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.250> stability<00:01:47.509> especially<00:01:48.509> for

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
of accuracy and stability especially for

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.380 
of accuracy and stability especially for
such<00:01:49.380> a<00:01:49.409> high<00:01:49.649> rate<00:01:49.829> of<00:01:49.890> fire<00:01:50.060> so<00:01:51.060> it<00:01:51.090> makes<00:01:51.270> a

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
such a high rate of fire so it makes a

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.569 
such a high rate of fire so it makes a
really<00:01:51.600> nice<00:01:51.840> suppression<00:01:52.680> going<00:01:53.100> or<00:01:53.310> if<00:01:53.430> you

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
really nice suppression going or if you

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.940 
really nice suppression going or if you
get<00:01:53.759> you<00:01:54.540> get<00:01:54.689> swamped<00:01:55.229> with<00:01:55.470> a<00:01:55.619> lot<00:01:55.920> of

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
get you get swamped with a lot of

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.209 
get you get swamped with a lot of
heavier<00:01:56.939> units<00:01:57.360> it's<00:01:57.570> a<00:01:57.659> great<00:01:57.869> weapon<00:01:58.219> the

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
heavier units it's a great weapon the

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.380 
heavier units it's a great weapon the
broom<00:01:59.430> handle<00:01:59.790> is<00:01:59.850> actually<00:02:00.149> a<00:02:00.180> pretty

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390

competing with the beretta and the Sig
Sauer<00:02:04.590> now<00:02:05.430> I<00:02:05.460> haven't<00:02:05.759> been<00:02:06.000> able<00:02:06.119> to<00:02:06.299> decode

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
Sauer now I haven't been able to decode

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.749 
Sauer now I haven't been able to decode
any<00:02:07.320> of<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.590> stats<00:02:07.890> yet<00:02:08.099> so<00:02:08.340> I<00:02:08.369> don't<00:02:08.489> know<00:02:08.729> if

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
any of the stats yet so I don't know if

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.249 
any of the stats yet so I don't know if
it<00:02:08.940> has<00:02:08.970> any<00:02:09.239> special<00:02:09.390> like<00:02:09.840> hipfire

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
it has any special like hipfire

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.199 
it has any special like hipfire

Beretta

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.700 
Beretta
so<00:02:13.390> i'll<00:02:13.900> be<00:02:14.020> doing<00:02:14.140> a<00:02:14.290> little<00:02:14.440> bit<00:02:14.560> more

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:14.710 
so i'll be doing a little bit more

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.440 
so i'll be doing a little bit more
research<00:02:14.890> on<00:02:15.250> that<00:02:15.310> and<00:02:15.490> if<00:02:15.760> I<00:02:15.910> find<00:02:16.120> anything

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
research on that and if I find anything

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.020 
research on that and if I find anything
worthy<00:02:17.200> of<00:02:17.470> mentioning<00:02:17.920> I'll<00:02:18.160> put<00:02:18.490> it<00:02:18.610> in<00:02:18.730> the

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
worthy of mentioning I'll put it in the

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.310 
worthy of mentioning I'll put it in the
weapon<00:02:19.540> guide<00:02:19.750> for<00:02:20.200> it<00:02:20.880> speaking<00:02:21.880> of<00:02:21.970> which

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
weapon guide for it speaking of which

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:27.090 
weapon guide for it speaking of which
I'm<00:02:23.320> planning<00:02:23.710> on<00:02:23.800> doing<00:02:24.280> either<00:02:24.760> the<00:02:25.740> mg42<00:02:26.740> or

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
I'm planning on doing either the mg42 or

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.270 
I'm planning on doing either the mg42 or
the<00:02:27.250> mosin<00:02:27.790> for<00:02:28.600> my<00:02:28.960> next<00:02:29.320> weapon<00:02:29.590> guide<00:02:29.950> video

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
the mosin for my next weapon guide video

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.590 
the mosin for my next weapon guide video
I<00:02:30.340> was<00:02:30.460> kind<00:02:30.610> of<00:02:30.640> waiting<00:02:30.760> for<00:02:31.060> this<00:02:31.150> pack<00:02:31.420> to

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
I was kind of waiting for this pack to

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.900 
I was kind of waiting for this pack to
come<00:02:31.780> out<00:02:31.930> before<00:02:32.560> I<00:02:32.740> made<00:02:32.950> any<00:02:33.070> more<00:02:33.340> videos<00:02:33.670> I

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
come out before I made any more videos I

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.810 
come out before I made any more videos I
can<00:02:34.090> I<00:02:34.540> could<00:02:34.900> tell<00:02:35.170> that<00:02:35.680> overkill<00:02:36.370> was<00:02:36.550> about

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
can I could tell that overkill was about

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.570 
can I could tell that overkill was about
to<00:02:36.970> release<00:02:37.210> a<00:02:37.270> new<00:02:37.600> DLC<00:02:38.470> so<00:02:38.680> I<00:02:38.710> figured<00:02:39.430> I'd

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
to release a new DLC so I figured I'd

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.370 
to release a new DLC so I figured I'd
hold<00:02:39.910> off<00:02:40.060> on<00:02:40.500> making<00:02:41.500> a<00:02:41.800> video<00:02:41.980> until<00:02:42.400> then<00:02:43.380> so

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
hold off on making a video until then so

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:45.930 
hold off on making a video until then so
I'm<00:02:44.530> probably<00:02:44.680> going<00:02:44.980> to<00:02:45.070> lean<00:02:45.250> towards<00:02:45.700> the

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
I'm probably going to lean towards the

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.450 
I'm probably going to lean towards the
mg42<00:02:46.540> just<00:02:46.990> because<00:02:47.140> I<00:02:47.260> only<00:02:47.380> have<00:02:47.590> one<00:02:47.830> lmg

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:48.460 
mg42 just because I only have one lmg

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.600 
mg42 just because I only have one lmg
video<00:02:48.790> out<00:02:48.970> so<00:02:49.240> far<00:02:49.540> the<00:02:50.020> RPK<00:02:51.010> I<00:02:51.160> think<00:02:51.490> it's

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
video out so far the RPK I think it's

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.300 
video out so far the RPK I think it's
that's<00:02:52.060> the<00:02:52.240> 1i<00:02:52.360> have<00:02:52.570> up<00:02:52.780> I<00:02:53.020> have<00:02:53.800> two<00:02:54.010> sniper

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
that's the 1i have up I have two sniper

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.020 
that's the 1i have up I have two sniper
videos<00:02:54.700> already<00:02:54.940> the<00:02:55.330> Thanatos<00:02:56.140> or<00:02:56.740> the<00:02:57.030> m95

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
videos already the Thanatos or the m95

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.190 
videos already the Thanatos or the m95
and<00:02:58.600> I<00:02:59.260> also<00:02:59.410> have<00:02:59.860> the<00:03:00.750> rattlesnake<00:03:01.750> which<00:03:01.990> is

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
and I also have the rattlesnake which is

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.990 
and I also have the rattlesnake which is
the<00:03:02.440> MSR<00:03:03.480> sniper<00:03:04.480> rifle<00:03:04.960> so<00:03:05.730> I'll<00:03:06.730> probably

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
the MSR sniper rifle so I'll probably

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.920 
the MSR sniper rifle so I'll probably
end<00:03:07.360> up<00:03:07.510> doing<00:03:07.870> the<00:03:07.960> mg42<00:03:09.060> 34<00:03:10.060> first<00:03:10.450> and<00:03:10.810> then

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
end up doing the mg42 34 first and then

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.020 
end up doing the mg42 34 first and then
doing<00:03:11.320> the<00:03:11.350> mosin<00:03:11.800> again<00:03:12.070> the<00:03:12.280> mosin<00:03:12.820> is<00:03:12.880> gonna

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
doing the mosin again the mosin is gonna

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.190 
doing the mosin again the mosin is gonna
be<00:03:13.090> a<00:03:13.120> lot<00:03:13.270> of<00:03:13.330> fun<00:03:13.540> I<00:03:13.600> like<00:03:13.840> all<00:03:14.050> the

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.860 
be a lot of fun I like all the
modifications<00:03:14.740> they<00:03:15.430> have<00:03:15.610> for<00:03:15.880> it<00:03:16.030> it's

modifications they have for it it's
going<00:03:17.020> to<00:03:17.080> be<00:03:17.140> a<00:03:17.170> really<00:03:17.350> interesting<00:03:17.680> weapon

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070 
going to be a really interesting weapon

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.880 
going to be a really interesting weapon
to<00:03:18.340> do<00:03:18.489> a<00:03:18.520> review<00:03:18.970> on<00:03:19.030> and<00:03:19.989> after<00:03:20.320> that<00:03:20.350> I<00:03:20.680> might

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
can't take in the name in game anyways I

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.440 
can't take in the name in game anyways I
might<00:03:31.750> do<00:03:32.260> that<00:03:32.290> one<00:03:32.680> or<00:03:32.980> I<00:03:33.400> may<00:03:33.940> do<00:03:34.420> the

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
might do that one or I may do the

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.310 
might do that one or I may do the

PPK that's another good pistol in game
after<00:03:42.250> that<00:03:42.370> i'm<00:03:42.580> probably<00:03:42.820> going<00:03:43.030> to<00:03:43.120> go<00:03:43.209> back

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
after that i'm probably going to go back

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.350 
after that i'm probably going to go back
to<00:03:43.470> doing<00:03:44.470> a<00:03:44.650> rifle<00:03:45.310> then<00:03:45.670> maybe<00:03:45.940> a<00:03:46.030> shotgun

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 
to doing a rifle then maybe a shotgun

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.140 
to doing a rifle then maybe a shotgun
and<00:03:46.930> maybe<00:03:47.739> work<00:03:47.950> on<00:03:48.100> the<00:03:48.280> cimmino<00:03:48.640> pistols

and maybe work on the cimmino pistols

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.449 
and maybe work on the cimmino pistols
but<00:03:49.330> who<00:03:49.780> knows<00:03:49.989> by<00:03:50.200> then<00:03:50.230> there<00:03:50.739> might<00:03:50.860> be<00:03:50.920> new

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
but who knows by then there might be new
