00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.609 
the overview the gun they're just
basically<00:01:42.990> bigger<00:01:44.360> bigger<00:01:45.360> Mavericks<00:01:45.869> and

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
basically bigger bigger Mavericks and

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.399

just<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:46.950> different<00:01:47.250> way<00:01:47.369> of<00:01:48.170> cocking<00:01:49.170> because

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
just a different way of cocking because

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.179 
just a different way of cocking because
it<00:01:49.500> will<00:01:49.710> this<00:01:49.829> like<00:01:50.310> this<00:01:50.540> instead<00:01:51.540> of<00:01:51.689> like

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 
it will this like this instead of like

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:58.219 
it will this like this instead of like
pulling<00:01:53.189> it<00:01:53.340> back<00:01:56.390> alright<00:01:57.390> so<00:01:57.659> let's<00:01:57.930> load

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
pulling it back alright so let's load

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.180 
pulling it back alright so let's load
this

00:01:59.180 --> 00:01:59.190 
this

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:05.360 
this
yes<00:02:00.200> spilled<00:02:01.200> this<00:02:01.550> slowed<00:02:02.550> it<00:02:02.670> off<00:02:04.100> just<00:02:05.100> hope

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:05.370 
yes spilled this slowed it off just hope

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:14.230 
yes spilled this slowed it off just hope
you<00:02:05.520> know<00:02:05.610> what

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.030 

and<00:02:15.240> then<00:02:15.390> the<00:02:15.540> orange<00:02:16.260> starts<00:02:16.560> will<00:02:16.710> come<00:02:16.890> out

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
and then the orange starts will come out

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.000 
and then the orange starts will come out
first<00:02:17.600> decide<00:02:18.600> in<00:02:18.750> fact<00:02:18.990> them<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.500> green<00:02:19.680> so

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
first decide in fact them the green so

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:31.280 
first decide in fact them the green so
easier<00:02:21.500> like<00:02:22.500> this<00:02:29.150> but<00:02:30.150> I'm<00:02:30.450> looking<00:02:30.990> forward

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
easier like this but I'm looking forward

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.320 
easier like this but I'm looking forward
to<00:02:31.320> this<00:02:31.500> I'm<00:02:31.860> looking<00:02:32.130> forward<00:02:32.400> to<00:02:32.430> open

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
to this I'm looking forward to open

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.330 
to this I'm looking forward to open
these<00:02:33.420> up<00:02:33.480> and<00:02:33.810> see<00:02:33.930> how<00:02:34.260> it<00:02:34.290> looks<00:02:34.440> see<00:02:35.130> if<00:02:35.220> it

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
these up and see how it looks see if it

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:41.980 
these up and see how it looks see if it
looks<00:02:35.490> like<00:02:35.640> the<00:02:36.650> Maverick<00:02:37.650> internals<00:02:40.520> so

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990 
looks like the Maverick internals so

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:45.770 
looks like the Maverick internals so
yeah<00:02:42.990> I<00:02:43.550> think<00:02:44.550> I<00:02:45.150> think<00:02:45.330> I<00:02:45.510> have<00:02:45.600> a<00:02:45.660> couple

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
yeah I think I think I have a couple

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.510 
yeah I think I think I have a couple
ideas<00:02:45.990> of<00:02:46.290> what<00:02:46.380> I'm<00:02:46.440> going<00:02:46.530> to<00:02:46.590> do<00:02:46.740> might

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
ideas of what I'm going to do might

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.200 
ideas of what I'm going to do might
integrate<00:02:47.840> air<00:02:48.840> tech<00:02:49.080> mm<00:02:49.800> into<00:02:50.640> this<00:02:50.790> somehow

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210 
integrate air tech mm into this somehow

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:55.520 
integrate air tech mm into this somehow
like<00:02:51.840> using<00:02:53.720> I'll<00:02:54.720> show<00:02:54.870> you<00:02:54.990> that<00:02:55.110> in<00:02:55.170> a<00:02:55.290> sec

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
like using I'll show you that in a sec

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:56.840 
like using I'll show you that in a sec
what<00:02:55.710> that<00:02:55.890> looks<00:02:56.070> like<00:02:56.190> in<00:02:56.430> case<00:02:56.610> you<00:02:56.760> don't

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
what that looks like in case you don't

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:10.070 
what that looks like in case you don't
know<00:02:57.320> and<00:02:58.320> I<00:02:58.410> seem<00:02:58.680> to<00:02:58.710> be<00:02:58.890> missing

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:19.400

here fire this so that's that's that it

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.630 
here fire this so that's that's that it
shoots<00:03:47.310> pretty<00:03:47.610> good<00:03:47.880> for<00:03:48.180> stock<00:03:49.220> stock<00:03:50.220> darts

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
shoots pretty good for stock stock darts

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.230 
shoots pretty good for stock stock darts
or<00:03:50.970> stock<00:03:51.330> gun<00:03:51.750> hit<00:03:52.440> the<00:03:52.620> garage<00:03:52.770> from<00:03:53.670> here<00:03:53.970> so
