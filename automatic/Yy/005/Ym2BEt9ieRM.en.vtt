00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
could I don't think if I did tie it that

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:15.470 
could I don't think if I did tie it that
I<00:02:14.100> would<00:02:14.400> even<00:02:14.520> be<00:02:14.760> able<00:02:14.820> to<00:02:14.970> take<00:02:15.090> it<00:02:15.180> out<00:02:15.300> with

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
I would even be able to take it out with

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.100 
I would even be able to take it out with
ease<00:02:15.690> like<00:02:15.990> I<00:02:16.110> would<00:02:17.270> yeah<00:02:18.270> what<00:02:18.630> suits<00:02:18.900> her<00:02:19.050> as

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
ease like I would yeah what suits her as

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.770 
ease like I would yeah what suits her as
his<00:02:19.230> finer<00:02:19.590> what<00:02:20.430> I<00:02:20.460> did<00:02:20.700> was<00:02:20.880> I<00:02:21.000> split<00:02:21.360> it<00:02:21.510> not

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
his finer what I did was I split it not

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.040 
his finer what I did was I split it not
completely<00:02:22.350> in<00:02:22.440> half<00:02:22.470> but<00:02:22.860> like<00:02:23.430> 75<00:02:24.150> 25<00:02:24.480> and

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
completely in half but like 75 25 and

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.640 
completely in half but like 75 25 and
then<00:02:26.010> I<00:02:26.100> take<00:02:26.310> the<00:02:26.610> smaller<00:02:27.570> portion<00:02:28.020> the<00:02:28.140> 25

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
then I take the smaller portion the 25

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.450 
then I take the smaller portion the 25
and<00:02:29.010> I<00:02:29.430> cut<00:02:29.760> that<00:02:29.790> in<00:02:30.150> half<00:02:30.680> and<00:02:31.680> then<00:02:32.250> I<00:02:32.310> just

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
and I cut that in half and then I just

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:37.100 
and I cut that in half and then I just
tie<00:02:32.910> it<00:02:32.940> around<00:02:33.150> the<00:02:33.960> rest<00:02:34.230> of<00:02:34.500> you<00:02:35.660> not<00:02:36.660> strand

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
tie it around the rest of you not strand

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
tie it around the rest of you not strand
with<00:02:37.500> this<00:02:37.680> bunch<00:02:38.430> of<00:02:38.640> style

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.559 

that's<00:02:45.730> pretty<00:02:45.940> much<00:02:46.150> it

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:47.569 
that's pretty much it

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:49.809 
that's pretty much it
so<00:02:48.140> what<00:02:48.439> I<00:02:48.469> did<00:02:48.709> to<00:02:48.829> prep<00:02:49.069> for<00:02:49.099> that<00:02:49.430> was<00:02:49.670> I

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:49.819 
so what I did to prep for that was I

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:52.920 
so what I did to prep for that was I
just<00:02:50.030> cornrowed<00:02:50.480> everything<00:02:51.290> back<00:02:51.530> and

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
just cornrowed everything back and

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.809 
just cornrowed everything back and
straight<00:02:53.930> back<00:02:54.170> and<00:02:54.950> then<00:02:55.159> she<00:02:55.430> liked<00:02:55.670> that

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:55.819 
straight back and then she liked that

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:58.360 
straight back and then she liked that
