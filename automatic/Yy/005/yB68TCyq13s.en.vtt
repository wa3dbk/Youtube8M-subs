00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
Baron's go ahead and shoot at another

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.450 
Baron's go ahead and shoot at another
enemy<00:01:58.509> switch<00:01:59.289> weapons<00:01:59.740> again<00:02:00.009> this<00:02:00.159> way<00:02:00.399> you

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
enemy switch weapons again this way you

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.580 
enemy switch weapons again this way you
can<00:02:00.789> conserve<00:02:01.149> your<00:02:01.329> ammo<00:02:01.780> but<00:02:02.229> the<00:02:02.350> only

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
can conserve your ammo but the only

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.740 
can conserve your ammo but the only
problem<00:02:02.979> is<00:02:03.070> right<00:02:03.310> here<00:02:03.609> I<00:02:03.789> took<00:02:04.179> about<00:02:04.299> a<00:02:04.450> 5

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
problem is right here I took about a 5

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.169 
problem is right here I took about a 5
or<00:02:04.780> 6<00:02:04.990> bully<00:02:05.560> bombs<00:02:05.859> out<00:02:06.130> in<00:02:06.429> true<00:02:06.969> vault

00:02:07.169 --> 00:02:07.179 
or 6 bully bombs out in true vault

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:09.180 
or 6 bully bombs out in true vault
hunter<00:02:07.329> mode<00:02:07.570> and<00:02:07.960> I<00:02:08.320> was<00:02:08.470> down<00:02:08.740> to<00:02:08.920> about<00:02:08.950> a

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
hunter mode and I was down to about a

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.120 
hunter mode and I was down to about a
hundred<00:02:09.490> bullets<00:02:10.150> of<00:02:10.270> ammo<00:02:10.660> which<00:02:11.140> is<00:02:11.410> a<00:02:11.590> very

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
hundred bullets of ammo which is a very

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.330 
hundred bullets of ammo which is a very
expensive<00:02:12.880> waste<00:02:13.480> of<00:02:13.690> ammo

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
expensive waste of ammo

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.449 
expensive waste of ammo
so<00:02:14.670> using<00:02:15.090> this<00:02:15.390> gun<00:02:15.720> at<00:02:16.020> any<00:02:16.560> type<00:02:16.920> of<00:02:17.130> range

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
so using this gun at any type of range

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.180 
so using this gun at any type of range
is<00:02:17.760> a<00:02:17.819> big<00:02:18.540> no-no<00:02:18.810> because<00:02:19.380> it<00:02:19.530> has<00:02:19.680> a<00:02:19.709> 50

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
is a big no-no because it has a 50

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.030 
is a big no-no because it has a 50
percent<00:02:20.670> accuracy<00:02:21.270> rated<00:02:21.780> which<00:02:22.200> means<00:02:22.500> this

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
percent accuracy rated which means this

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.130 
percent accuracy rated which means this
guns<00:02:23.400> bullet<00:02:23.880> spread<00:02:24.120> pattern<00:02:24.450> since<00:02:24.870> it<00:02:25.020> is<00:02:25.110> a

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
guns bullet spread pattern since it is a

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.339 
guns bullet spread pattern since it is a
gap<00:02:25.440> with<00:02:25.650> gun<00:02:25.860> is<00:02:26.220> like<00:02:26.760> a<00:02:26.819> big<00:02:27.120> o<00:02:27.300> think<00:02:28.140> of<00:02:28.260> a

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
gap with gun is like a big o think of a

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:30.770 
gap with gun is like a big o think of a
cheerio<00:02:28.830> that's<00:02:29.489> how<00:02:29.790> these<00:02:30.000> bullets<00:02:30.480> spread

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
cheerio that's how these bullets spread

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.600 
cheerio that's how these bullets spread
and<00:02:31.019> it's<00:02:31.440> not<00:02:31.709> very<00:02:31.950> practical<00:02:32.580> for

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
and it's not very practical for

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.850 
and it's not very practical for
long-range<00:02:33.000> use<00:02:33.599> and<00:02:33.959> I<00:02:34.260> thought<00:02:34.470> this<00:02:34.650> gun

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
long-range use and I thought this gun

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.100 
long-range use and I thought this gun
would<00:02:35.040> be<00:02:35.190> great<00:02:35.519> performing<00:02:36.209> but<00:02:36.599> even<00:02:36.959> with

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
would be great performing but even with

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.890 
would be great performing but even with
the<00:02:37.260> be<00:02:37.440> against<00:02:38.040> pyro<00:02:38.280> Pete<00:02:38.640> it<00:02:38.970> just<00:02:39.569> really

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
the be against pyro Pete it just really

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.960 
the be against pyro Pete it just really
doesn't<00:02:40.349> do<00:02:40.709> the<00:02:40.920> type<00:02:41.130> of<00:02:41.160> damage<00:02:41.489> that<00:02:41.819> you

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
doesn't do the type of damage that you

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.970 
doesn't do the type of damage that you
would<00:02:42.090> expect<00:02:42.540> from<00:02:42.660> an<00:02:42.840> assault<00:02:43.140> rifle<00:02:43.230> that

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
would expect from an assault rifle that

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.880 
would expect from an assault rifle that
fire<00:02:44.250> is<00:02:44.489> this<00:02:44.610> entire<00:02:45.120> clip<00:02:45.720> and<00:02:45.930> one<00:02:46.500> pull<00:02:46.860> of

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
fire is this entire clip and one pull of

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.250 
fire is this entire clip and one pull of
the<00:02:47.040> trigger<00:02:47.150> just<00:02:48.150> because<00:02:48.600> the<00:02:48.840> damage

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
the trigger just because the damage

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.520 
the trigger just because the damage
rated<00:02:49.650> all<00:02:49.739> this<00:02:49.920> is<00:02:50.100> about<00:02:50.750> 4,000<00:02:51.750> to<00:02:51.810> 5,000

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
rated all this is about 4,000 to 5,000

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.229 
rated all this is about 4,000 to 5,000
I've<00:02:52.590> seen<00:02:52.860> them<00:02:53.010> fluctuate<00:02:53.580> anywhere<00:02:54.090> around

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
I've seen them fluctuate anywhere around

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.210 
I've seen them fluctuate anywhere around
there<00:02:54.690> but<00:02:55.049> because<00:02:55.440> it<00:02:55.590> does<00:02:55.890> have<00:02:56.160> a

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
there but because it does have a

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.940 
there but because it does have a
multiple<00:02:56.819> projectile<00:02:57.330> damage<00:02:57.810> value<00:02:58.170> it<00:02:58.350> does

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
multiple projectile damage value it does

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.640 
multiple projectile damage value it does
not<00:02:59.280> actually<00:02:59.610> do<00:03:00.120> the<00:03:00.269> job<00:03:00.510> like<00:03:01.110> it<00:03:01.290> should

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
not actually do the job like it should

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.500 
not actually do the job like it should
there's<00:03:02.190> a<00:03:02.250> lot<00:03:02.459> better<00:03:02.700> weapons<00:03:03.150> out<00:03:03.299> there

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
there's a lot better weapons out there

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.720 
there's a lot better weapons out there
for<00:03:03.750> you<00:03:03.840> guys<00:03:04.019> to<00:03:04.230> use<00:03:04.440> for<00:03:05.010> farming<00:03:05.220> so<00:03:05.670> you

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
for you guys to use for farming so you

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.759 
for you guys to use for farming so you
don't<00:03:05.940> waste<00:03:06.180> your<00:03:06.390> entire<00:03:06.720> ammo<00:03:07.170> because<00:03:07.739> a

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
don't waste your entire ammo because a

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.190 
don't waste your entire ammo because a
true<00:03:08.040> vault<00:03:08.220> hunter<00:03:08.340> mode<00:03:08.580> ammo<00:03:09.450> does<00:03:09.840> get

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
true vault hunter mode ammo does get

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.160 
true vault hunter mode ammo does get
expensive<00:03:10.760> but<00:03:11.760> that<00:03:12.360> does<00:03:12.599> not<00:03:12.840> mean<00:03:13.140> that

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
expensive but that does not mean that

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.020 
expensive but that does not mean that
this<00:03:13.380> gun<00:03:13.650> is<00:03:13.680> not<00:03:13.799> fun<00:03:14.340> and<00:03:14.519> that<00:03:14.610> does<00:03:14.790> not

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
this gun is not fun and that does not

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.759 
this gun is not fun and that does not
mean<00:03:15.299> that<00:03:15.330> you<00:03:15.660> should<00:03:15.870> not<00:03:16.049> try<00:03:16.319> to<00:03:16.410> get<00:03:16.590> this
