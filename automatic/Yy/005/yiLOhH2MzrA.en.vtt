00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:19.970 
and flying type which gives it a times
for<00:07:18.930> weakness<00:07:19.290> to<00:07:19.440> lightning

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:19.980 
for weakness to lightning

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:21.770 
for weakness to lightning
I<00:07:20.010> guess<00:07:20.580> the<00:07:20.730> create<00:07:20.970> is<00:07:21.060> a<00:07:21.090> game<00:07:21.300> freak<00:07:21.600> knew

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:21.780 
I guess the create is a game freak knew

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:23.420 
I guess the create is a game freak knew
what<00:07:21.930> kind<00:07:22.110> of<00:07:22.140> monster<00:07:22.500> they<00:07:22.620> created<00:07:23.280> and

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:23.430 
what kind of monster they created and

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:25.670 
what kind of monster they created and
without<00:07:23.970> a<00:07:24.000> big<00:07:24.240> weakness<00:07:24.690> then<00:07:25.170> you<00:07:25.350> would<00:07:25.500> be

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:25.680 
without a big weakness then you would be

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:27.950 
without a big weakness then you would be
almost<00:07:25.920> unstoppable<00:07:26.400> most<00:07:27.270> Pokemon<00:07:27.750> with<00:07:27.930> a

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:27.960 
almost unstoppable most Pokemon with a

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:29.810 
almost unstoppable most Pokemon with a
high<00:07:28.140> base<00:07:28.350> that<00:07:28.680> had<00:07:29.010> this<00:07:29.250> times<00:07:29.550> for

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:29.820 
high base that had this times for

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:31.760 
high base that had this times for
weakness<00:07:30.240> and<00:07:30.480> there's<00:07:30.990> a<00:07:31.080> fair<00:07:31.290> reasoning

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:31.770 
weakness and there's a fair reasoning

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:34.220 
weakness and there's a fair reasoning
behind<00:07:31.920> it<00:07:32.280> all<00:07:32.790> that<00:07:33.030> aside<00:07:33.330> Gyarados<00:07:34.020> will

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:34.230 
behind it all that aside Gyarados will

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:35.930 
behind it all that aside Gyarados will
probably<00:07:34.590> be<00:07:34.710> my<00:07:34.890> favorite<00:07:34.920> pokemon<00:07:35.700> for<00:07:35.880> a
