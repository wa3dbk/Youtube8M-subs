talk about how you can come up with your

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:15.670 
talk about how you can come up with your
own<00:01:02.280> riffs<00:01:02.519> alright<00:01:03.479> so<00:01:03.720> here's<00:01:03.930> an<00:01:04.080> example

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.080 

all<00:01:16.680> right<00:01:16.890> so<00:01:17.130> that's<00:01:17.250> from<00:01:17.430> Neil<00:01:17.580> Young<00:01:17.820> and

all right so that's from Neil Young and
it's<00:01:19.020> just<00:01:19.260> you<00:01:19.620> know<00:01:19.710> instead<00:01:20.040> of<00:01:20.160> the<00:01:20.220> a

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
it's just you know instead of the a

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.170 
it's just you know instead of the a
minor<00:01:21.050> or<00:01:22.050> a<00:01:22.080> minor<00:01:22.410> indeed<00:01:22.970> we're<00:01:23.970> really

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
minor or a minor indeed we're really

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:31.780 
minor or a minor indeed we're really
going<00:01:26.600> walking<00:01:27.600> up<00:01:27.690> that<00:01:27.870> baseline

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.230 

that's<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.920> so<00:01:34.920> notice<00:01:35.070> how<00:01:35.310> we're<00:01:35.940> hitting

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
that's the a so notice how we're hitting

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:42.220 
that's the a so notice how we're hitting
those<00:01:36.390> you<00:01:37.140> know<00:01:37.260> root<00:01:37.890> notes<00:01:38.430> of<00:01:38.580> the<00:01:38.670> court

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:42.230 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:50.850 

here's<00:01:43.230> another<00:01:43.380> example

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.860 

candidates<00:01:51.860> receive<00:01:52.190> iller<00:01:52.450> again<00:01:53.450> we're

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:53.870 
candidates receive iller again we're

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:55.630 
candidates receive iller again we're
using<00:01:53.900> like<00:01:54.440> you<00:01:54.590> know<00:01:54.680> the<00:01:54.800> G<00:01:54.980> core<00:01:55.220> but<00:01:55.520> we're

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
using like you know the G core but we're

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.160 
using like you know the G core but we're
starting<00:01:55.910> with<00:01:56.060> G<00:01:56.210> based<00:01:56.450> on<00:01:58.960> walking<00:01:59.960> it<00:02:00.050> up

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
starting with G based on walking it up

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:08.380 
starting with G based on walking it up
to<00:02:00.290> the<00:02:00.380> next<00:02:00.500> quarter<00:02:00.950> it's<00:02:01.070> the<00:02:01.220> sea

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.900 

okay<00:02:09.390> so<00:02:10.039> there's<00:02:11.039> a<00:02:11.099> couple<00:02:11.130> principles<00:02:11.760> here

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
okay so there's a couple principles here

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.610 
okay so there's a couple principles here
first<00:02:12.180> of<00:02:12.270> all<00:02:12.360> when<00:02:12.690> I<00:02:12.720> say<00:02:12.810> we're<00:02:13.110> walking<00:02:13.530> it

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
first of all when I say we're walking it

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:22.890 
first of all when I say we're walking it
out<00:02:13.709> like<00:02:14.160> in<00:02:14.459> that<00:02:14.610> first<00:02:14.849> example

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.690 

so<00:02:23.900> we're<00:02:24.019> staying<00:02:24.260> with<00:02:24.349> you<00:02:24.500> the<00:02:24.650> scale<00:02:24.980> it

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
so we're staying with you the scale it

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:26.920 
so we're staying with you the scale it
helps<00:02:25.969> to<00:02:26.090> know<00:02:26.209> a<00:02:26.239> little<00:02:26.569> bit<00:02:26.750> of<00:02:26.840> music

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
helps to know a little bit of music

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.539 
helps to know a little bit of music
theory<00:02:27.379> and<00:02:27.739> you<00:02:27.859> want<00:02:28.010> to<00:02:28.099> kind<00:02:28.189> of<00:02:28.310> stay<00:02:28.519> in

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:28.549 
theory and you want to kind of stay in

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:32.800 
theory and you want to kind of stay in
that<00:02:28.790> major<00:02:29.000> scale<00:02:31.000> and<00:02:32.000> by<00:02:32.209> the<00:02:32.269> way<00:02:32.450> if

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
that major scale and by the way if

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.330 
that major scale and by the way if
you're<00:02:32.989> not<00:02:33.140> you<00:02:33.650> know<00:02:33.769> familiar<00:02:33.950> with<00:02:34.250> the

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
you're not you know familiar with the

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.949 
you're not you know familiar with the
major<00:02:34.519> scale<00:02:34.640> or<00:02:35.150> you<00:02:35.269> want<00:02:35.450> to<00:02:35.510> learn<00:02:35.629> more<00:02:35.810> of

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
major scale or you want to learn more of

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.470 
major scale or you want to learn more of
these<00:02:36.049> like<00:02:36.439> example<00:02:36.799> songs<00:02:37.159> you<00:02:38.150> can<00:02:38.239> check

beginner guitar and it's got a lot of

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.429 
beginner guitar and it's got a lot of
great<00:02:43.849> some<00:02:44.030> of<00:02:44.120> those<00:02:44.180> so<00:02:44.329> check<00:02:44.359> that<00:02:44.599> out<00:02:44.780> so

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
we'll plug them for the day so anyway

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.030 
we'll plug them for the day so anyway
using<00:02:49.879> the<00:02:50.150> you<00:02:50.959> know<00:02:51.079> stay<00:02:51.469> within<00:02:51.650> the<00:02:51.829> scale

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
using the you know stay within the scale

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.550 
using the you know stay within the scale
that's<00:02:52.459> one<00:02:52.609> principle<00:02:53.150> another<00:02:54.049> one<00:02:54.260> is<00:02:54.530> that

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
that's one principle another one is that

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.270 
that's one principle another one is that
you<00:02:55.099> know<00:02:55.280> this<00:02:55.430> is<00:02:55.609> really<00:02:55.819> more<00:02:56.090> of<00:02:56.150> a<00:02:56.329> melody

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
you know this is really more of a melody

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.460 
you know this is really more of a melody
with<00:02:58.280> low<00:02:58.459> notes<00:02:58.700> than<00:02:58.939> a<00:02:58.970> bassline<00:02:59.450> per<00:02:59.689> se<00:02:59.900> so

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
with low notes than a bassline per se so

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.830 
with low notes than a bassline per se so
what<00:03:00.829> I<00:03:00.859> mean<00:03:01.040> by<00:03:01.159> that<00:03:01.189> is<00:03:01.700> you<00:03:02.569> know<00:03:02.659> these

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
kind of obvious but we're hitting the

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.119 
kind of obvious but we're hitting the
root<00:03:30.969> of<00:03:31.180> the<00:03:31.359> chord<00:03:31.599> on<00:03:32.500> the<00:03:32.560> beat<00:03:32.890> where<00:03:33.040> it

00:03:33.119 --> 00:03:33.129 
root of the chord on the beat where it

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:37.440 
root of the chord on the beat where it
falls<00:03:33.340> so<00:03:33.780> again<00:03:34.780> with<00:03:34.900> this<00:03:35.049> one<00:03:36.269> if<00:03:37.269> our

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
falls so again with this one if our

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.339 
falls so again with this one if our
chord<00:03:37.659> progression<00:03:38.049> is

00:03:39.339 --> 00:03:39.349 
chord progression is

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:43.770 
chord progression is
see

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:51.890 

notice<00:03:44.770> how<00:03:44.860> we're<00:03:45.010> hitting<00:03:45.250> those<00:03:45.370> notes<00:03:45.670> G

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.190 

okay<00:03:53.670> so<00:03:54.670> let's<00:03:54.940> take<00:03:55.150> a<00:03:55.180> let's<00:03:55.720> take<00:03:55.900> our<00:03:56.050> own

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
okay so let's take a let's take our own

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.560 
okay so let's take a let's take our own
progression<00:03:56.610> here's<00:03:57.610> one<00:03:57.850> that<00:03:57.940> I<00:03:58.060> like<00:03:58.240> it's

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
progression here's one that I like it's

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:11.920 
progression here's one that I like it's
G

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.679

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:17.269 
the baseline or the build you know the

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:21.999 
the baseline or the build you know the
low<00:04:17.449> ability<00:04:17.900> first<00:04:18.169> and<00:04:20.199> then<00:04:21.199> like<00:04:21.680> add<00:04:21.859> it

00:04:21.999 --> 00:04:22.009 
low ability first and then like add it

and there we're really using that

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:23.930 
and there we're really using that
walking<00:05:11.300> up<00:05:11.419> kind<00:05:11.750> of<00:05:11.780> movement<00:05:14.979> sorry

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:29.910 
this scale now it's interesting when I

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:35.780 
this scale now it's interesting when I
go<00:05:30.060> from<00:05:30.240> the<00:05:30.330> a<00:05:30.360> minor<00:05:30.750> the<00:05:31.020> see<00:05:34.580> it's<00:05:35.580> got

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:35.790

enough space to walk up like there's

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:43.370 
enough space to walk up like there's
three<00:05:38.160> notes<00:05:38.460> down<00:05:41.480> notice<00:05:42.480> between<00:05:42.840> the<00:05:43.170> GBA

direction okay now you could do

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:16.409 
direction okay now you could do
something<00:06:06.849> like<00:06:06.879> chromatic<00:06:15.300> you<00:06:16.300> could

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:16.419 
something like chromatic you could

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:18.029 
something like chromatic you could
always<00:06:16.539> do<00:06:16.719> that<00:06:16.839> you<00:06:16.899> don't<00:06:17.439> have<00:06:17.589> to<00:06:17.740> stay<00:06:17.919> at
