goes with the gun cannon it always shows

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.259 
goes with the gun cannon it always shows
you<00:02:16.500> that<00:02:16.650> you<00:02:16.769> that<00:02:17.400> you<00:02:17.549> should<00:02:17.730> apply<00:02:17.970> one

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
you that you that you should apply one

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:19.640 
you that you that you should apply one
singer<00:02:18.569> but<00:02:18.720> there<00:02:18.930> is<00:02:19.049> an<00:02:19.200> other<00:02:19.379> one

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
singer but there is an other one

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.990 
singer but there is an other one
underneath<00:02:20.390> and<00:02:21.560> it's<00:02:22.560> not<00:02:22.799> too<00:02:23.250> easy<00:02:23.519> to

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
underneath and it's not too easy to

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.530 
underneath and it's not too easy to
remove<00:02:24.269> a<00:02:24.510> sticker<00:02:24.989> so<00:02:25.459> I<00:02:26.459> didn't<00:02:27.120> bother<00:02:27.239> and

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
remove a sticker so I didn't bother and

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.380 
remove a sticker so I didn't bother and
simply<00:02:27.930> applied<00:02:28.409> it<00:02:28.530> in<00:02:28.620> a<00:02:28.680> different<00:02:28.920> place

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
simply applied it in a different place

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.979 
simply applied it in a different place
that<00:02:30.390> was<00:02:30.659> a<00:02:30.959> little<00:02:31.530> bit<00:02:31.859> frustrating<00:02:32.579> though

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
that was a little bit frustrating though

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:37.220 
that was a little bit frustrating though
also<00:02:33.989> the<00:02:34.920> sticker<00:02:35.189> sheet<00:02:35.459> you<00:02:36.299> get<00:02:36.510> a<00:02:36.689> lot<00:02:37.200> of

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
also the sticker sheet you get a lot of

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.410 
also the sticker sheet you get a lot of
sticker<00:02:37.650> so<00:02:37.950> I<00:02:38.430> mean<00:02:38.760> this<00:02:38.909> is<00:02:38.970> a<00:02:39.150> sticker

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
sticker so I mean this is a sticker

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.000 
sticker so I mean this is a sticker
sheet<00:02:39.629> after<00:02:39.810> you've<00:02:40.079> applied<00:02:40.260> all<00:02:40.709> this

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
sheet after you've applied all this

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.160 
sheet after you've applied all this
cigar<00:02:41.310> sir<00:02:41.459> should<00:02:41.790> so<00:02:42.090> there's<00:02:42.599> still<00:02:42.810> plenty

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
cigar sir should so there's still plenty

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.449 
cigar sir should so there's still plenty
of<00:02:43.439> stickers<00:02:43.769> to<00:02:43.859> go<00:02:43.950> crazy

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
of stickers to go crazy

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.449 
of stickers to go crazy
also<00:02:45.409> most<00:02:46.409> of<00:02:46.560> them<00:02:46.739> aren't<00:02:46.980> just<00:02:47.370> normal

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
also most of them aren't just normal

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.300 
also most of them aren't just normal
peel<00:02:48.120> off<00:02:48.329> but<00:02:48.659> these<00:02:49.230> underneath<00:02:49.650> here

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
peel off but these underneath here

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.000 
peel off but these underneath here
aren't<00:02:50.819> cut<00:02:51.120> out<00:02:51.150> so<00:02:51.629> you've<00:02:52.440> got<00:02:52.650> to<00:02:52.769> cut<00:02:52.950> them

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
aren't cut out so you've got to cut them

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.520 
aren't cut out so you've got to cut them
out<00:02:53.099> yourself<00:02:53.639> which<00:02:54.299> is<00:02:54.450> a<00:02:54.629> little<00:02:55.230> bit<00:02:55.349> of<00:02:55.440> an

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
out yourself which is a little bit of an

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.819 
out yourself which is a little bit of an
annoyance<00:02:55.739> but<00:02:56.310> yeah<00:02:57.409> just<00:02:58.409> let<00:02:58.530> me<00:02:58.590> deal<00:02:58.799> with

00:02:58.819 --> 00:02:58.829 
annoyance but yeah just let me deal with

00:02:58.829 --> 00:02:59.559 
annoyance but yeah just let me deal with
it

00:02:59.559 --> 00:02:59.569 
it

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:03.050 
it
now<00:03:00.569> onto<00:03:01.280> articulation<00:03:02.280> and<00:03:02.489> because<00:03:02.879> this

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
now onto articulation and because this

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.089 
now onto articulation and because this
is<00:03:03.299> of<00:03:03.510> course<00:03:03.659> basically<00:03:04.109> a<00:03:04.230> tank<00:03:04.680> it's<00:03:04.980> not

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099 
is of course basically a tank it's not

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:09.229 
is of course basically a tank it's not
going<00:03:05.639> to<00:03:05.819> be<00:03:06.000> all<00:03:06.209> that<00:03:06.269> great<00:03:07.010> head<00:03:08.010> goes<00:03:08.340> bit

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
going to be all that great head goes bit

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:12.679 
going to be all that great head goes bit
up<00:03:09.420> bit<00:03:10.019> down<00:03:10.819> rotate<00:03:11.819> a<00:03:11.849> bit<00:03:11.970> side<00:03:12.569> to<00:03:12.599> side

00:03:12.679 --> 00:03:12.689 
up bit down rotate a bit side to side

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:16.429 
up bit down rotate a bit side to side
and<00:03:13.109> that's<00:03:13.379> all<00:03:13.670> the<00:03:14.670> cans<00:03:14.939> will<00:03:15.389> go<00:03:15.599> down<00:03:16.049> up

00:03:16.429 --> 00:03:16.439 
and that's all the cans will go down up

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:22.699 
and that's all the cans will go down up
and<00:03:17.959> will<00:03:18.959> rotate<00:03:19.579> right<00:03:20.579> that<00:03:20.970> far<00:03:21.680> which<00:03:22.680> is

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
and will rotate right that far which is

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.619 
and will rotate right that far which is
actually<00:03:23.190> pretty<00:03:23.459> nice<00:03:23.730> considering<00:03:24.480> that

00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:24.629 
actually pretty nice considering that

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:27.409 
actually pretty nice considering that
they're<00:03:25.470> cannons<00:03:25.919> of<00:03:26.340> course<00:03:27.030> if<00:03:27.150> you<00:03:27.239> put

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:27.419 
they're cannons of course if you put

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:29.089 
they're cannons of course if you put
them<00:03:27.510> down<00:03:27.540> to<00:03:27.840> anyone<00:03:27.989> carry<00:03:28.260> that<00:03:28.440> much<00:03:28.650> but

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:29.099 
them down to anyone carry that much but

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:31.399 
them down to anyone carry that much but
you<00:03:29.430> can<00:03:29.459> still<00:03:29.819> put<00:03:30.480> it<00:03:30.540> right<00:03:30.659> like<00:03:30.870> this<00:03:31.079> for

00:03:31.399 --> 00:03:31.409 
you can still put it right like this for

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:34.520 
you can still put it right like this for
some<00:03:31.560> interesting<00:03:31.859> fire<00:03:32.220> poses<00:03:33.019> which<00:03:34.019> is<00:03:34.230> of

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
some interesting fire poses which is of

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.500 
some interesting fire poses which is of
course<00:03:34.829> necessary<00:03:35.190> because<00:03:35.879> this<00:03:36.090> guy<00:03:36.299> has

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
course necessary because this guy has

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.830 
course necessary because this guy has
very<00:03:36.989> little<00:03:37.260> waist<00:03:37.650> movement<00:03:38.299> but<00:03:39.299> to<00:03:39.599> be

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
very little waist movement but to be

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.099 
very little waist movement but to be
fair<00:03:40.109> to<00:03:40.169> the<00:03:40.409> kit<00:03:41.569> canonically<00:03:42.569> it<00:03:42.810> shouldn't

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:43.109 
fair to the kit canonically it shouldn't

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:45.409 
fair to the kit canonically it shouldn't
have<00:03:43.229> any<00:03:43.470> waist<00:03:43.769> movement<00:03:44.069> at<00:03:44.459> all<00:03:45.030> because

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:45.419 
have any waist movement at all because

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:48.619 
have any waist movement at all because
if<00:03:45.750> you<00:03:45.870> read<00:03:46.049> about<00:03:46.199> its<00:03:46.470> specs<00:03:47.150> because<00:03:48.150> of

00:03:48.619 --> 00:03:48.629 
if you read about its specs because of

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:52.569 
if you read about its specs because of
his<00:03:49.049> core<00:03:49.560> block<00:03:49.949> system<00:03:50.489> he<00:03:51.479> cannot<00:03:51.930> rotate

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:52.579 
his core block system he cannot rotate

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:55.939 
his core block system he cannot rotate
this<00:03:53.579> once<00:03:53.879> again<00:03:54.150> confirmed<00:03:54.690> by<00:03:54.930> the<00:03:54.989> gun<00:03:55.319> by

00:03:55.939 --> 00:03:55.949 
this once again confirmed by the gun by

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:58.250 
this once again confirmed by the gun by
the<00:03:56.010> gun<00:03:56.159> tank<00:03:56.430> -<00:03:56.879> and<00:03:56.909> the<00:03:57.449> gun<00:03:57.629> tank<00:03:57.930> mass

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
the gun tank - and the gun tank mass

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.289 
the gun tank - and the gun tank mass
production<00:03:58.680> time<00:03:58.829> because<00:03:59.129> they<00:03:59.340> say<00:03:59.400> it's

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
production time because they say it's

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:03.349 
production time because they say it's
take<00:04:00.599> this<00:04:00.959> it<00:04:01.560> is<00:04:01.799> stated<00:04:02.129> there<00:04:02.250> that<00:04:02.400> they

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:03.359 
take this it is stated there that they

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:05.839 
take this it is stated there that they
are<00:04:03.569> an<00:04:03.690> improvement<00:04:04.079> over<00:04:04.440> the<00:04:04.889> gun<00:04:05.280> tank<00:04:05.549> in

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:05.849 
are an improvement over the gun tank in

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:07.789 
are an improvement over the gun tank in
the<00:04:05.970> way<00:04:06.090> that<00:04:06.299> they<00:04:06.569> have<00:04:06.840> waist<00:04:07.409> movement

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
the way that they have waist movement

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:11.030 
the way that they have waist movement
and<00:04:08.220> that<00:04:08.310> they<00:04:08.430> can<00:04:08.669> rotate<00:04:08.940> around<00:04:09.859> so<00:04:10.859> yeah

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
and that they can rotate around so yeah

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.099 
and that they can rotate around so yeah
actually<00:04:11.310> this<00:04:11.609> kit<00:04:11.849> does<00:04:11.879> some<00:04:12.840> things

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:13.109 
actually this kit does some things

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:15.199 
actually this kit does some things
better<00:04:13.319> than<00:04:13.500> the<00:04:13.889> actual<00:04:14.310> mobile<00:04:14.940> suit

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
better than the actual mobile suit

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:18.469 
better than the actual mobile suit
itself<00:04:15.650> now<00:04:16.650> the<00:04:16.709> firm's<00:04:17.250> once<00:04:17.820> again<00:04:18.060> aren't

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
itself now the firm's once again aren't

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:19.670 
itself now the firm's once again aren't
really<00:04:18.750> all<00:04:18.780> that<00:04:19.109> great<00:04:19.289> in<00:04:19.440> terms<00:04:19.530> of

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
really all that great in terms of

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.269 
really all that great in terms of
articulation<00:04:20.280> will<00:04:21.150> go<00:04:21.359> up<00:04:21.599> down<00:04:22.409> rotate

00:04:23.269 --> 00:04:23.279 
articulation will go up down rotate

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:25.070 
articulation will go up down rotate
around<00:04:23.400> all<00:04:23.700> the<00:04:23.880> way<00:04:23.909> low<00:04:24.659> forwards<00:04:24.990> and

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
around all the way low forwards and

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.129 
around all the way low forwards and
backwards<00:04:25.229> moving<00:04:25.650> because

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:26.139 
backwards moving because

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:29.700 
backwards moving because
is<00:04:26.229> a<00:04:26.289> pretty<00:04:26.979> early<00:04:27.340> high<00:04:27.580> grade<00:04:27.900> now<00:04:28.900> they

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
is a pretty early high grade now they

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:34.200 
is a pretty early high grade now they
will<00:04:29.949> rotate<00:04:31.499> above<00:04:32.499> the<00:04:32.620> elbow<00:04:33.189> like<00:04:33.999> this

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
will rotate above the elbow like this

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.390 
will rotate above the elbow like this
and<00:04:34.719> the<00:04:34.840> elbow<00:04:35.199> itself<00:04:35.620> is<00:04:35.800> on<00:04:35.949> a<00:04:35.979> double

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
and the elbow itself is on a double

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.399 
and the elbow itself is on a double
joint<00:04:36.669> but<00:04:36.879> this<00:04:37.150> is<00:04:37.360> all<00:04:37.719> you're<00:04:38.020> going<00:04:38.289> to

00:04:38.399 --> 00:04:38.409 
joint but this is all you're going to

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:44.070 
joint but this is all you're going to
get<00:04:39.150> so<00:04:40.150> not<00:04:40.749> what<00:04:41.080> I<00:04:41.520> mean<00:04:42.520> -<00:04:42.610> but<00:04:42.789> no<00:04:43.779> the<00:04:43.930> top

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
get so not what I mean - but no the top

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.790 
get so not what I mean - but no the top
joint<00:04:44.319> hardly<00:04:44.770> does<00:04:44.949> anything<00:04:45.159> really<00:04:46.800> you

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
joint hardly does anything really you

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.320 
joint hardly does anything really you
can<00:04:47.979> actually<00:04:48.159> get<00:04:48.400> it<00:04:48.520> to<00:04:48.550> same<00:04:48.939> position

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
can actually get it to same position

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.379 
can actually get it to same position
without<00:04:49.629> using<00:04:49.990> the<00:04:50.080> top<00:04:50.289> joint<00:04:50.499> at<00:04:50.770> all<00:04:51.389> so

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:52.389 
without using the top joint at all so

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:55.320 
without using the top joint at all so
yeah<00:04:53.110> not<00:04:53.469> too<00:04:53.919> great<00:04:54.189> but<00:04:54.249> then<00:04:54.819> again<00:04:54.939> it<00:04:55.300> is

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
yeah not too great but then again it is

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.920 
yeah not too great but then again it is
a<00:04:55.810> tank<00:04:56.259> and<00:04:57.189> that's<00:04:57.759> all<00:04:58.029> the<00:04:58.300> articulation

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 
a tank and that's all the articulation

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.350 
a tank and that's all the articulation
you<00:04:59.080> get<00:04:59.259> the<00:04:59.860> threats<00:05:00.159> as<00:05:00.370> expected<00:05:00.909> don't

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 
you get the threats as expected don't

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.010 
you get the threats as expected don't
move<00:05:02.490> but<00:05:03.490> yeah<00:05:03.819> I<00:05:04.150> wasn't<00:05:04.689> really<00:05:04.779> expecting

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.020 
move but yeah I wasn't really expecting

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.730 
move but yeah I wasn't really expecting
that<00:05:05.289> so<00:05:05.590> it's<00:05:05.740> not<00:05:05.860> too<00:05:06.219> much<00:05:06.490> of<00:05:06.550> a<00:05:06.729> shame<00:05:07.000> but

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
that so it's not too much of a shame but

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.529 
that so it's not too much of a shame but
I<00:05:08.740> always<00:05:09.129> say<00:05:09.669> that<00:05:09.699> you<00:05:09.879> have<00:05:10.180> to<00:05:10.360> keep

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:10.539 
I always say that you have to keep

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:11.820 
I always say that you have to keep
articulation

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
articulation

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:13.950 
articulation
well<00:05:12.370> articulation<00:05:13.060> whether<00:05:13.569> it's<00:05:13.750> good<00:05:13.930> or

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:13.960 
well articulation whether it's good or

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.830 
well articulation whether it's good or
bad<00:05:14.050> all<00:05:14.439> the<00:05:14.860> pens<00:05:15.159> on<00:05:15.400> the<00:05:15.849> mobile<00:05:16.060> suit<00:05:16.419> this

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 
bad all the pens on the mobile suit this

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:21.089 
bad all the pens on the mobile suit this
is<00:05:17.080> a<00:05:17.259> tank<00:05:17.740> pretty<00:05:18.460> much<00:05:18.699> so<00:05:19.680> because<00:05:20.680> the

00:05:21.089 --> 00:05:21.099 
is a tank pretty much so because the

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:23.129 
is a tank pretty much so because the
fact<00:05:21.310> that<00:05:21.370> it<00:05:21.550> has<00:05:21.699> bad<00:05:22.210> articulation<00:05:23.020> or

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:23.139 
fact that it has bad articulation or

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:25.589 
fact that it has bad articulation or
some<00:05:23.349> articulation<00:05:23.740> doesn't<00:05:24.580> matter<00:05:24.879> at<00:05:25.150> all

00:05:25.589 --> 00:05:25.599 
some articulation doesn't matter at all

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:28.230 
some articulation doesn't matter at all
I<00:05:25.990> mean<00:05:26.469> you<00:05:26.800> don't<00:05:27.099> expect<00:05:27.279> this<00:05:27.759> guy<00:05:27.969> to<00:05:27.999> go

bats<00:05:57.520> well<00:05:58.300> articulation<00:05:58.960> is<00:05:59.110> subpar<00:05:59.649> but<00:05:59.680> and

00:06:00.179 --> 00:06:00.189 
bats well articulation is subpar but and

00:06:00.189 --> 00:06:02.999 
bats well articulation is subpar but and
again<00:06:00.399> that<00:06:00.610> doesn't<00:06:01.029> really<00:06:01.449> matter<00:06:02.009> the

00:06:02.999 --> 00:06:03.009 
again that doesn't really matter the

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:04.709 
again that doesn't really matter the
color<00:06:03.219> is<00:06:03.430> nice<00:06:03.669> and<00:06:03.969> when<00:06:04.300> you<00:06:04.389> consider<00:06:04.539> that

00:06:04.709 --> 00:06:04.719 
color is nice and when you consider that

00:06:04.719 --> 00:06:07.110 
color is nice and when you consider that
the<00:06:04.899> original<00:06:05.319> one<00:06:05.500> was<00:06:05.680> only<00:06:06.009> 800<00:06:06.669> yen

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.120 
the original one was only 800 yen

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.110 
the original one was only 800 yen
yeah<00:06:07.930> that's<00:06:08.259> pretty<00:06:08.949> that's<00:06:09.490> a<00:06:09.669> pretty<00:06:09.939> damn

00:06:20.519 --> 00:06:20.529 
the aurochs 75 which means that this was
