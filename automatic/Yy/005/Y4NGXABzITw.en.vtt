00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:16.350
 My name is a Takao Kato 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:20.300
 Cultivate 25 asparagus 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.300
 a It will be the fifth year 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:25.540
 Well agriculture is what entirely of amateur but yeah 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.199
 I 'm making this asparagus 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:37.930
 Let's make that soil first 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:41.530
 Sound the soil by putting a lot of microorganisms in the soil 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:43.300
 And there 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:47.320
 Organic fertilizer 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:49.310
 Scientific medicine is made with 100% organic fertilizer 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:54.290
 If you use the salary say 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:58.610
 It is very sweet without you 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:01:01.490
 Originally it's crops are sweet vegetables that asparagus 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:03.660
 More delicious and soft 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:08.520
 Amami's 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:11.860
 You can taste that sweet asparagus with natural sweetness 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.190
 By or stretched the insect net 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:20.790
 That pesticide 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:25.350
 I was safe and relieved to you in a way that I kept it to the limit 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:28.500
 I'm looking forward to eating that foothold and working hard 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.620
 Well I 'll eat it once 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.330
 I do not like asparagus Kapa 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.810
 I think the image for asparagus will change 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:42.900
 That one 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:45.580
 When that impression is touched in the wind that there were sweet and delicious vegetables 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:49.100
 I guess I am sure 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:51.369
 This last year or this branch 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.369
 Ne 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.730
 Such use this this is stock of last year 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.150
 so 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.390
 in short 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.530
 It is around here 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.430
 Such a guy 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.770
 Minutes 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.220
 That book 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:11.450
 Hey roughly another 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:14.860
 I think the is about strike roots next to each other and have become lower 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.860
 Because it will be about four years already 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:23.870
 For example, here I 'm here 30 cm apart but when I'm making it 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:27.200
 When planting, go here 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.380
 I think that I 'm stuck from here to now 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.790
 eh 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:33.239
 This soil 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.239
 Necessary 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:40.390
 The soft village your milk'm microorganisms 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.510
 Warmth place 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:46.550
 It states I mean riding the best state warm current of father 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:49.260
 And use the two microorganisms 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:55.400
 There is no bone father using microorganisms 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:56.840
 If you put in the biological sciences people of traditional farming method 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.470
 That 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:02.010
 I'm disinfecting the field for sterilization 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:07.870
 But that 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:10.160
 My way Wrap the microbe and don't use the disinfectant 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:13.569
 It is a direction to say 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15.569
 Then that usual is in this state 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:19.379
 that 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:23.310
 The Preface agent but usually you have to wind this sheet 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:29.310
 We use herbicide once, too, and Tomoko is really that 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:30.750
 I will stick to what everyone can eat with confidence 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:35.400
 eh 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:38.770
 Asparagus is a plant of the lily family of asparagus 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:44.930
 The Apini is it that nutrients 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:49.130
 You entrapment to the roots of the underground in it is accumulated in the roots that 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:50.620
 Nutrients become a hub sprouted 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:56.050
 This intends in 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:04:01.330
 Woman Where is referred to as spring buds to job hunting Well the it came out Let's go all at once 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:02.050
 Then I got to 2 laps tap because the 6-round underground that had that spring buds Yamada but its after Sakura 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.390
 is not it 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:09.950
 that 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:14.209
 Build a tree and expand its disappearing eight cups by photosynthesis of its leaves 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:16.739
 This time also make the new life this is Well, summer and autumn 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:21.850
 It is said to be a woman 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:27.010
 In from mid of roughly 1 February if we come up to about October of head 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:29.030
 Asparagus harvest over 7 months and 8 months 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:32.330
 It will be in the form of there 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:35.889
 Because the taste is so I have been pursuing 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:37.580
 Yeah Well taste solder 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:40.920
 I think I will not lose 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:43.529
 It crops say the asparagus that 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:44.830
 I will say that the division of the field 

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:49.480
 4 2 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:54.700
 It is enough to do the fertilizer which needs a large amount of fertilizer 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:55.830
 Improvement in the out things do is admirable leave that out, for example, put Nante relationship fee because you 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.360
 Though 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.689
 Delicious and I'm Hey good 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.320
 To make it delicious 

00:04:59.689 --> 00:05:03.280
 After all 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:09.289
 that 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:10.780
 It 's a short experience I have, but when I use it in a relationship I don't get a good taste 

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:13.090
 Yup 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.280
 After all, bitterness comes out 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:16.400
 Masu have Tei 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:20.600
 That 's home 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:24.390
 We stuck all the way to 100% of such organic fertilizers 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:27.530
 So very child from this that Well 

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:27.530
 Sweet taste comes out 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.960
 Hmm 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:36.940
 ee 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:39.840
 me 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:41.840
 Hame's
