not<00:00:41.040> his<00:00:41.340> pectoral<00:00:42.000> fins<00:00:42.379> like<00:00:43.379> I<00:00:43.500> think<00:00:43.559> a

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
not his pectoral fins like I think a

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.529 
not his pectoral fins like I think a
regular<00:00:44.100> lionfish<00:00:44.600> its<00:00:45.600> but<00:00:45.780> uh<00:00:45.809> he<00:00:46.559> also<00:00:46.710> has

00:00:47.529 --> 00:00:47.539 
regular lionfish its but uh he also has

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:50.690 
regular lionfish its but uh he also has
his<00:00:48.539> pectoral<00:00:49.140> fins<00:00:49.379> are<00:00:49.500> like<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:49.649> fan<00:00:50.039> instead

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
his pectoral fins are like a fan instead

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.889 
his pectoral fins are like a fan instead
of<00:00:50.789> sticking<00:00:51.090> out<00:00:51.180> like<00:00:51.300> spikes<00:00:51.629> like<00:00:51.870> a

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
of sticking out like spikes like a

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.479 
of sticking out like spikes like a
regular<00:00:52.050> lionfish<00:00:52.440> so<00:00:52.829> he<00:00:53.010> looks<00:00:53.160> more<00:00:53.309> like<00:00:53.370> a

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
regular lionfish so he looks more like a

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.010 
regular lionfish so he looks more like a
scorpion<00:00:53.879> fish<00:00:54.210> even<00:00:54.539> though<00:00:54.600> he's<00:00:54.750> part<00:00:54.989> of

anenome their whole entire life as they

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.139 
anenome their whole entire life as they

are parasite as to the sea enemy as a
host<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:51.750> they<00:01:52.530> will<00:01:52.680> stay<00:01:52.890> in<00:01:52.950> there<00:01:53.180> their

host and they will stay in there their
entire<00:01:54.450> life<00:01:54.659> so<00:01:54.840> if<00:01:54.930> I<00:01:55.020> put<00:01:55.229> it<00:01:55.290> in<00:01:55.380> one<00:01:55.530> side

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
entire life so if I put it in one side

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.340 
entire life so if I put it in one side
of<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:55.890> tank<00:01:56.100> like<00:01:56.969> over<00:01:57.240> here<00:01:57.420> bye-bye<00:01:58.170> him

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
of the tank like over here bye-bye him

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.709 
of the tank like over here bye-bye him
then<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:59.549> clownfish<00:01:59.969> probably<00:02:00.420> won't<00:02:00.570> ever

the<00:02:16.830> farm<00:02:17.129> fish<00:02:17.310> could<00:02:17.519> probably<00:02:17.730> use<00:02:18.060> a<00:02:18.480> tank

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379 
the farm fish could probably use a tank

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:22.339 
the farm fish could probably use a tank
maybe<00:02:19.590> twice<00:02:19.890> as<00:02:20.040> big<00:02:20.190> as<00:02:20.310> this<00:02:20.459> but<00:02:21.349> it's

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349 
maybe twice as big as this but it's

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:23.690 
maybe twice as big as this but it's
alright<00:02:22.680> because<00:02:22.739> I<00:02:23.129> feed<00:02:23.310> him<00:02:23.430> pretty

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
alright because I feed him pretty

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.839 
alright because I feed him pretty
regularly<00:02:24.060> so<00:02:25.069> it's<00:02:26.069> not<00:02:26.190> in<00:02:26.280> any<00:02:26.370> danger<00:02:26.580> of

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
regularly so it's not in any danger of

with<00:04:13.770> the<00:04:14.770> scorpion<00:04:15.250> fish<00:04:15.280> or<00:04:15.910> the<00:04:16.030> lionfish

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:16.270 
with the scorpion fish or the lionfish

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:17.760 
with the scorpion fish or the lionfish
whatever<00:04:16.750> but<00:04:17.050> they<00:04:17.200> don't<00:04:17.380> care<00:04:17.590> because

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:17.770 
whatever but they don't care because

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:20.280 
whatever but they don't care because
they<00:04:18.270> nothing's<00:04:19.270> gonna<00:04:19.390> transpire<00:04:19.840> of<00:04:20.020> it<00:04:20.170> you

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.290 
they nothing's gonna transpire of it you

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:23.700 
they nothing's gonna transpire of it you
can't<00:04:20.560> start<00:04:21.430> can't<00:04:21.700> eat<00:04:21.850> him<00:04:22.380> and<00:04:23.380> the

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
can't start can't eat him and the

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.060 
can't start can't eat him and the
scorpion<00:04:24.160> fish<00:04:24.340> can't<00:04:24.850> eat<00:04:25.030> the<00:04:25.150> shark<00:04:25.420> so

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
scorpion fish can't eat the shark so

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.190 
scorpion fish can't eat the shark so
you're<00:04:27.070> just<00:04:27.190> gonna<00:04:27.340> have<00:04:27.640> to<00:04:27.930> befriend<00:04:28.930> one

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.200 
you're just gonna have to befriend one

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
you're just gonna have to befriend one
another<00:04:30.180> yeah<00:04:31.710> yeah<00:04:32.710> I<00:04:32.740> think<00:04:32.860> this<00:04:33.040> takes

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
another yeah yeah I think this takes

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:34.530 
another yeah yeah I think this takes
just<00:04:33.370> a<00:04:33.520> little<00:04:33.550> bit<00:04:33.820> larger<00:04:34.090> than<00:04:34.120> I<00:04:34.240> think<00:04:34.450> I

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:34.540 
just a little bit larger than I think I

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:38.070 
just a little bit larger than I think I
got<00:04:34.690> him<00:04:34.900> out<00:04:35.020> of<00:04:36.300> it's<00:04:37.300> the<00:04:37.390> same<00:04:37.600> size<00:04:37.780> as<00:04:37.990> the

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
got him out of it's the same size as the

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.160 
got him out of it's the same size as the
one<00:04:38.200> I<00:04:38.230> got<00:04:38.440> the<00:04:39.250> scorpion<00:04:39.820> fish<00:04:40.020> the<00:04:41.020> frog

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:41.170 
one I got the scorpion fish the frog

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:45.300 
one I got the scorpion fish the frog
fish<00:04:41.560> and<00:04:41.920> the<00:04:41.980> clownfish<00:04:42.400> out<00:04:42.640> of<00:04:43.230> so<00:04:44.230> I<00:04:44.680> think

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.310 
fish and the clownfish out of so I think

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:48.240 
fish and the clownfish out of so I think
they'll<00:04:45.610> be<00:04:45.820> all<00:04:45.940> right<00:04:46.090> in<00:04:46.780> here<00:04:47.070> they<00:04:48.070> seem

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
they'll be all right in here they seem

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.500 
they'll be all right in here they seem
to<00:04:48.340> stay<00:04:48.490> out<00:04:48.550> of<00:04:48.610> each<00:04:48.730> other's<00:04:48.880> way

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:51.510 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.080 

the<00:04:52.510> cronies<00:04:52.930> are<00:04:53.140> probably<00:04:53.350> gonna<00:04:53.470> get<00:04:53.620> eaten

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
the cronies are probably gonna get eaten

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.450 
the cronies are probably gonna get eaten
but<00:04:55.090> yeah<00:04:55.470> and<00:04:56.470> probably<00:04:56.710> the<00:04:56.920> Domino<00:04:57.280> damsels

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
but yeah and probably the Domino damsels

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:58.530 
but yeah and probably the Domino damsels
I<00:04:57.760> don't<00:04:57.910> know<00:04:58.000> where<00:04:58.150> he<00:04:58.270> went

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:58.540 
I don't know where he went

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:03.960 
I don't know where he went
he's<00:04:59.140> back<00:04:59.350> there<00:05:00.690> but<00:05:01.690> um<00:05:01.870> I<00:05:02.580> don't<00:05:03.580> know<00:05:03.730> I

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
he's back there but um I don't know I

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.340 
he's back there but um I don't know I
feed<00:05:04.270> them<00:05:04.330> regularly<00:05:04.480> I<00:05:04.840> don't<00:05:05.110> think<00:05:05.260> they

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:05.350 
feed them regularly I don't think they

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.760 
feed them regularly I don't think they
will

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
will

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.910 
will
I<00:05:05.800> think<00:05:06.490> that'd<00:05:06.610> be<00:05:06.730> all<00:05:06.850> right<00:05:06.970> and<00:05:07.920> it's

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:08.920 
I think that'd be all right and it's

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.900 
I think that'd be all right and it's
hard<00:05:09.070> to<00:05:09.100> get<00:05:09.250> any<00:05:09.340> presences<00:05:10.000> of<00:05:10.300> Isis<00:05:11.140> but<00:05:11.380> uh

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:11.910 
hard to get any presences of Isis but uh

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:13.710 
hard to get any presences of Isis but uh
you<00:05:12.910> know<00:05:13.000> they're<00:05:13.150> all<00:05:13.210> pretty<00:05:13.390> particular

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:13.720 
you know they're all pretty particular

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:18.120 
you know they're all pretty particular
about<00:05:13.960> eating<00:05:14.590> live<00:05:14.800> things<00:05:15.870> so<00:05:16.870> I<00:05:17.320> don't<00:05:18.040> know

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.130 
about eating live things so I don't know

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:21.030 
about eating live things so I don't know
but<00:05:18.960> I<00:05:19.960> hope<00:05:20.080> I<00:05:20.200> get<00:05:20.290> to<00:05:20.410> keep<00:05:20.530> my<00:05:20.590> cronies

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:21.040 
but I hope I get to keep my cronies

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.629 
but I hope I get to keep my cronies
that'd<00:05:21.160> be<00:05:21.250> kind<00:05:21.430> of<00:05:21.460> cool
