in<00:00:00.060> this<00:00:00.719> lecture<00:00:00.960> video<00:00:01.410> we<00:00:02.040> will<00:00:02.159> discuss

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
in this lecture video we will discuss

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.730 
in this lecture video we will discuss
the<00:00:02.700> concept<00:00:03.210> of<00:00:03.360> central<00:00:03.959> venous<00:00:04.200> pressure

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
the concept of central venous pressure

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.629 
the concept of central venous pressure
and<00:00:05.100> the<00:00:06.089> factors<00:00:06.450> that<00:00:06.569> affect<00:00:06.870> it<00:00:07.280> to<00:00:08.280> begin

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
and the factors that affect it to begin

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.459 
and the factors that affect it to begin
let's<00:00:09.480> define<00:00:09.809> a<00:00:09.870> few<00:00:10.139> terms<00:00:10.759> venous<00:00:11.759> capacity

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:12.469 
let's define a few terms venous capacity

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:15.950 
let's define a few terms venous capacity
venous<00:00:13.469> return<00:00:13.650> and<00:00:14.750> central<00:00:15.750> venous

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
venous return and central venous

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.150 
venous return and central venous
pressure<00:00:17.480> first<00:00:18.480> let's<00:00:19.230> discuss<00:00:19.439> venous

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
pressure first let's discuss venous

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.450 
pressure first let's discuss venous
capacity<00:00:21.740> think<00:00:22.740> about<00:00:22.949> going<00:00:23.189> to<00:00:23.310> a

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
capacity think about going to a

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.670 
capacity think about going to a
restaurant<00:00:23.699> and<00:00:24.180> they<00:00:24.810> always<00:00:25.109> have<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.439> sign

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
restaurant and they always have the sign

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.169 
restaurant and they always have the sign
that<00:00:25.710> says<00:00:26.449> maximum<00:00:27.449> capacity<00:00:28.199> is<00:00:28.230> and<00:00:29.179> some

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
that says maximum capacity is and some

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.290 
that says maximum capacity is and some
number<00:00:31.009> this<00:00:32.009> sign<00:00:32.309> tells<00:00:32.640> you<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.910> maximum

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
number this sign tells you the maximum

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.569 
number this sign tells you the maximum
number<00:00:33.719> of<00:00:33.750> people<00:00:34.260> you<00:00:34.890> should<00:00:35.100> have<00:00:35.309> in<00:00:35.489> that

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
number of people you should have in that

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.560 
number of people you should have in that
establishment<00:00:36.920> that<00:00:37.920> is<00:00:38.309> similar<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:39.239> venous

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
establishment that is similar to venous

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.610 
establishment that is similar to venous
capacity<00:00:40.309> venous<00:00:41.309> capacity<00:00:42.059> indicates<00:00:42.719> the

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
capacity venous capacity indicates the

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.130 
capacity venous capacity indicates the
volume<00:00:44.219> of<00:00:44.370> blood<00:00:44.550> that<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.180> veins<00:00:45.450> can

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
volume of blood that the veins can

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.819 
volume of blood that the veins can
accommodate<00:00:47.629> now<00:00:48.629> let's<00:00:48.899> focus<00:00:49.110> on<00:00:49.410> venous

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
accommodate now let's focus on venous

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.350 
accommodate now let's focus on venous
return<00:00:51.559> venous<00:00:52.559> return<00:00:52.739> is<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.579> volume<00:00:54.120> of

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
return venous return is the volume of

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.660 
return venous return is the volume of
blood<00:00:54.690> that<00:00:55.500> returns<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.449> heart<00:00:58.670> finally

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
blood that returns to the heart finally

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.700 
blood that returns to the heart finally
you<00:01:00.480> will<00:01:00.570> need<00:01:00.629> to<00:01:00.899> be<00:01:01.020> familiar<00:01:01.199> with<00:01:01.620> the

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
you will need to be familiar with the

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.660 
you will need to be familiar with the
term<00:01:01.980> central<00:01:02.760> venous<00:01:03.300> pressure<00:01:03.690> or<00:01:04.549> what<00:01:05.549> we

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
term central venous pressure or what we

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.539 
term central venous pressure or what we
call<00:01:05.939> C<00:01:06.600> V<00:01:07.409> P<00:01:09.680> central<00:01:10.680> venous<00:01:10.830> pressure<00:01:10.979> is

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
call C V P central venous pressure is

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.730 
call C V P central venous pressure is
the<00:01:11.939> pressure<00:01:12.210> in<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.570> large<00:01:12.840> veins<00:01:13.290> of<00:01:13.619> the

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
the pressure in the large veins of the

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.219 
the pressure in the large veins of the
thoracic<00:01:13.979> cavity<00:01:14.369> this<00:01:15.360> would<00:01:15.600> include<00:01:15.960> the

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
thoracic cavity this would include the

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.020 
thoracic cavity this would include the
inferior<00:01:17.009> vena<00:01:17.640> cava<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:18.710> the<00:01:19.710> superior<00:01:20.610> vena

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
inferior vena cava and the superior vena

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.950 
inferior vena cava and the superior vena
cava<00:01:22.430> all<00:01:23.430> right<00:01:23.640> so<00:01:24.210> let's<00:01:24.450> start<00:01:24.750> thinking

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
cava all right so let's start thinking

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.640 
cava all right so let's start thinking
about<00:01:25.290> how<00:01:25.770> increasing<00:01:26.700> or<00:01:26.880> decreasing

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
about how increasing or decreasing

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.730 
about how increasing or decreasing
venous<00:01:28.650> capacity<00:01:29.400> or<00:01:29.610> venous<00:01:30.270> return<00:01:30.740> affects

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
venous capacity or venous return affects

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.140 
venous capacity or venous return affects
central<00:01:32.189> venous<00:01:32.340> pressure<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:33.119> vice<00:01:33.810> versa

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
central venous pressure and vice versa

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.469 
central venous pressure and vice versa
for<00:01:36.150> example<00:01:36.600> if<00:01:37.130> central<00:01:38.130> venous<00:01:38.280> pressure

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
for example if central venous pressure

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.569 
for example if central venous pressure
increases<00:01:39.619> what<00:01:40.619> will<00:01:40.650> happen<00:01:41.159> to<00:01:41.280> venous

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
increases what will happen to venous

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.700 
increases what will happen to venous
return<00:01:42.590> will<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.619> patient<00:01:44.220> with<00:01:44.369> an<00:01:44.490> increased

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
return will a patient with an increased

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.580 
return will a patient with an increased
central<00:01:46.710> venous<00:01:46.890> pressure<00:01:47.509> have<00:01:48.509> more<00:01:49.049> blood

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
central venous pressure have more blood

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.260 
central venous pressure have more blood
flowing<00:01:50.130> into<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.579> heart<00:01:50.610> or<00:01:51.329> less<00:01:53.270> more

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
flowing into the heart or less more

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.249 
flowing into the heart or less more
blood<00:01:54.570> your<00:01:55.200> correct<00:01:56.180> so<00:01:57.180> increasing<00:01:57.899> central

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
blood your correct so increasing central

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.020 
blood your correct so increasing central
venous<00:01:58.439> pressure<00:01:58.909> increases<00:01:59.909> venous<00:02:00.060> return

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
venous pressure increases venous return

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.420 
venous pressure increases venous return
okay<00:02:03.030> so<00:02:03.689> if<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.140> patient<00:02:04.530> has<00:02:04.680> an<00:02:04.860> increased

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
okay so if the patient has an increased

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.300 
okay so if the patient has an increased
venous<00:02:05.850> return<00:02:06.500> how<00:02:07.500> is<00:02:07.710> that<00:02:07.890> going<00:02:08.160> to

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
venous return how is that going to

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.999 
venous return how is that going to
affect<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:09.539> volume<00:02:10.200> of<00:02:10.379> blood<00:02:10.709> and<00:02:10.920> the

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
affect the volume of blood and the

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.680 
affect the volume of blood and the
ventricles<00:02:11.959> before<00:02:12.959> can<00:02:13.440> track

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
ventricles before can track

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.240 
ventricles before can track
it<00:02:15.690> increases<00:02:16.440> right<00:02:17.480> you<00:02:18.480> have<00:02:18.630> just<00:02:18.900> defined

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
it increases right you have just defined

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.200 
it increases right you have just defined
what's<00:02:20.250> called<00:02:20.610> the<00:02:20.880> end<00:02:21.230> diastolic<00:02:22.230> volume

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210 
what's called the end diastolic volume

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:30.020 
what's called the end diastolic volume
II<00:02:24.590> D<00:02:25.590> V<00:02:27.230> the<00:02:28.230> end<00:02:28.440> diastolic<00:02:28.620> volume<00:02:29.010> is<00:02:29.640> the

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
II D V the end diastolic volume is the

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.850 
II D V the end diastolic volume is the
maximum<00:02:30.780> amount<00:02:31.080> of<00:02:31.170> blood<00:02:31.470> in<00:02:31.650> the

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
maximum amount of blood in the

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.830 
maximum amount of blood in the
ventricles<00:02:32.400> B<00:02:33.390> for<00:02:34.160> contraction<00:02:35.630> so<00:02:36.630> let's

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
ventricles B for contraction so let's

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.560 
ventricles B for contraction so let's
continue<00:02:37.170> with<00:02:37.440> the<00:02:37.560> idea<00:02:37.920> of<00:02:38.220> increasing<00:02:39.150> the

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
continue with the idea of increasing the

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.760 
continue with the idea of increasing the
venous<00:02:39.870> return<00:02:41.270> again<00:02:42.270> if<00:02:42.630> you<00:02:43.230> increase

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
venous return again if you increase

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.490 
venous return again if you increase
venous<00:02:44.040> return<00:02:44.390> that<00:02:45.390> will<00:02:45.570> increase<00:02:46.080> the<00:02:46.290> end

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
venous return that will increase the end

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.840 
venous return that will increase the end
diastolic<00:02:47.400> volume<00:02:48.920> so<00:02:49.920> what<00:02:50.190> will<00:02:50.340> that<00:02:50.370> do<00:02:50.700> to

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
diastolic volume so what will that do to

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.870 
diastolic volume so what will that do to
the<00:02:50.940> patient's<00:02:51.420> cardiac<00:02:51.660> muscle<00:02:52.290> is<00:02:52.880> the

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
the patient's cardiac muscle is the

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:59.080 
the patient's cardiac muscle is the
cardiac<00:02:54.570> muscle<00:02:54.840> going<00:02:55.350> to<00:02:55.440> stretch<00:02:55.910> or<00:02:56.910> not<00:02:57.300> a

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
cardiac muscle going to stretch or not a

cardiac muscle going to stretch or not a
greater<00:03:00.090> volume<00:03:00.660> of<00:03:00.780> blood<00:03:01.520> causes<00:03:03.350> more

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
greater volume of blood causes more

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.850 
greater volume of blood causes more
stretch<00:03:05.000> toward<00:03:06.000> the<00:03:06.150> optimal<00:03:06.600> length<00:03:06.860> which

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
stretch toward the optimal length which

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.800 
stretch toward the optimal length which
will<00:03:08.070> increase<00:03:08.730> the<00:03:09.090> number<00:03:09.450> of<00:03:09.480> cross

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
will increase the number of cross

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.800 
will increase the number of cross
bridges<00:03:10.170> that<00:03:10.470> can<00:03:10.680> form<00:03:11.070> and<00:03:11.310> will<00:03:12.270> cause<00:03:12.510> the

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
bridges that can form and will cause the

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.560 
bridges that can form and will cause the
force<00:03:13.080> of<00:03:13.260> contraction<00:03:13.820> to<00:03:15.290> increase<00:03:16.290> as<00:03:16.530> a

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
force of contraction to increase as a

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.210 
force of contraction to increase as a
result<00:03:18.570> this<00:03:19.230> will<00:03:19.470> cause<00:03:19.680> the<00:03:19.709> stroke<00:03:20.190> volume

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
result this will cause the stroke volume

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.210 
result this will cause the stroke volume
to<00:03:20.880> increase<00:03:21.860> okay

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
to increase okay

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.130 
to increase okay
let's<00:03:23.820> return<00:03:24.120> for<00:03:24.420> a<00:03:24.480> moment<00:03:24.540> to<00:03:24.959> the

increased force of contraction how did

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.580 
increased force of contraction how did
this<00:03:28.440> affect<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:29.190> patient's<00:03:29.760> and<00:03:30.590> systolic

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
this affect the patient's and systolic

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.020 
this affect the patient's and systolic
volume<00:03:33.260> remember<00:03:34.260> the<00:03:34.830> end<00:03:35.130> systolic<00:03:35.700> volume

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.740 
volume remember the end systolic volume
or<00:03:36.660> the<00:03:36.720> ESV<00:03:37.650> is<00:03:37.890> the<00:03:38.550> maximum<00:03:39.300> amount<00:03:39.660> of

contraction the patient just had a huge

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.830 
contraction the patient just had a huge
contraction<00:03:46.680> so<00:03:47.640> is<00:03:47.790> there<00:03:47.970> going<00:03:48.150> to<00:03:48.270> be<00:03:48.390> more

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
contraction so is there going to be more

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.580

that<00:03:52.739> contraction<00:03:54.260> less<00:03:55.790> therefore<00:03:57.050> the<00:03:58.050> end

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
that contraction less therefore the end

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:03.740 
that contraction less therefore the end
systolic<00:03:58.920> volume<00:03:59.540> will<00:04:00.540> be<00:04:00.570> lower<00:04:01.790> okay<00:04:02.820> let's

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
systolic volume will be lower okay let's

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.770 
systolic volume will be lower okay let's
return<00:04:03.959> to<00:04:04.170> the<00:04:04.440> stroke<00:04:04.680> volume<00:04:05.209> earlier<00:04:06.209> we

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
return to the stroke volume earlier we

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.479 
return to the stroke volume earlier we
said<00:04:06.989> that<00:04:07.050> the<00:04:07.350> patient's<00:04:07.950> stroke<00:04:08.250> volume

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
said that the patient's stroke volume

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:12.050 
said that the patient's stroke volume
would<00:04:09.270> increase<00:04:09.989> due<00:04:10.980> to<00:04:11.220> the<00:04:11.370> increased

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
would increase due to the increased

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.199 
would increase due to the increased
central<00:04:12.870> venous<00:04:13.080> pressure

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:14.209 
central venous pressure

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:17.420 
central venous pressure
how<00:04:15.209> does<00:04:15.450> stroke<00:04:15.810> volume<00:04:16.049> affect<00:04:16.709> cardiac

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
how does stroke volume affect cardiac

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:22.130 
how does stroke volume affect cardiac
output<00:04:19.400> remember<00:04:20.400> that<00:04:20.910> cardiac<00:04:21.419> output<00:04:21.870> is

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
output remember that cardiac output is

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.730 
output remember that cardiac output is
equal<00:04:22.830> to<00:04:23.310> heart<00:04:23.550> rate<00:04:23.760> times<00:04:24.750> the<00:04:25.320> stroke

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
equal to heart rate times the stroke

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.500 
equal to heart rate times the stroke
volume

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
volume

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.950 
volume
so<00:04:28.080> if<00:04:28.290> stroke<00:04:28.620> volume<00:04:28.830> increases<00:04:29.790> so<00:04:30.660> does

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
so if stroke volume increases so does

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.270 
so if stroke volume increases so does
your<00:04:31.500> cardiac<00:04:31.830> output<00:04:32.040> and<00:04:33.200> remember<00:04:34.280> that

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
your cardiac output and remember that

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.100 
your cardiac output and remember that
this<00:04:35.520> will<00:04:35.760> also<00:04:35.970> increase<00:04:36.630> the<00:04:36.900> mean

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
this will also increase the mean

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.860 
this will also increase the mean
arterial<00:04:37.530> pressure<00:04:38.480> which<00:04:39.480> is<00:04:39.690> the<00:04:39.720> pressure

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
arterial pressure which is the pressure

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.210 
arterial pressure which is the pressure
in<00:04:40.470> the<00:04:40.650> aorta<00:04:40.700> during<00:04:41.700> one<00:04:42.000> cardiac<00:04:42.690> cycle

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
in the aorta during one cardiac cycle

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.900 
in the aorta during one cardiac cycle
all<00:04:44.510> right<00:04:45.510> so<00:04:45.750> to<00:04:45.810> recap<00:04:46.260> if<00:04:46.670> we<00:04:47.670> alter

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
all right so to recap if we alter

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.510 
all right so to recap if we alter
central<00:04:48.570> venous<00:04:48.750> pressure<00:04:49.340> that<00:04:50.340> will

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
central venous pressure that will

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.480 
central venous pressure that will
indirectly<00:04:51.360> influence<00:04:52.140> your<00:04:52.590> mean<00:04:52.920> arterial

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
indirectly influence your mean arterial

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.380 
indirectly influence your mean arterial
pressure<00:04:53.670> and<00:04:54.770> remember<00:04:55.770> that<00:04:56.430> mean<00:04:56.790> arterial

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:57.390 
pressure and remember that mean arterial

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:01.100 
pressure and remember that mean arterial
pressure<00:04:58.550> influences<00:04:59.550> how<00:05:00.180> much<00:05:00.390> blood<00:05:00.780> is

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
pressure influences how much blood is

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.850 
pressure influences how much blood is
delivered<00:05:01.680> to<00:05:02.040> your<00:05:02.400> organs
