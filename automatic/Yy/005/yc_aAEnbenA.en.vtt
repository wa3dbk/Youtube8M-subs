00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
approach is fantastic and was it a

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.360 
approach is fantastic and was it a
conscious<00:04:01.330> decision<00:04:01.540> to<00:04:02.019> have<00:04:02.370> exterior

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
conscious decision to have exterior

up<00:04:06.700> on<00:04:06.880> big<00:04:07.239> exterior<00:04:07.870> huge<00:04:08.500> kind<00:04:08.920> of<00:04:09.040> scale

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
up on big exterior huge kind of scale

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.790 
up on big exterior huge kind of scale
freestanding<00:04:10.510> structures<00:04:11.170> to<00:04:11.380> mount<00:04:11.560> them<00:04:11.709> on

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:11.800 
freestanding structures to mount them on

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.740 
freestanding structures to mount them on
these<00:04:12.370> structures<00:04:12.760> came<00:04:13.000> to<00:04:13.180> us<00:04:13.330> last<00:04:13.570> year

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
these structures came to us last year

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.720 
these structures came to us last year
from<00:04:14.050> another<00:04:14.590> exhibition<00:04:14.920> called<00:04:15.250> respect

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
from another exhibition called respect

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.310 
from another exhibition called respect
which<00:04:15.910> looked<00:04:16.209> at<00:04:16.299> the<00:04:16.390> boreal<00:04:16.750> court<00:04:17.109> so<00:04:17.290> a

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
which looked at the boreal court so a

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.759 
which looked at the boreal court so a
broader<00:04:17.680> view<00:04:18.130> of<00:04:18.190> what<00:04:18.489> is<00:04:18.609> Canada<00:04:19.060> and<00:04:19.570> so<00:04:20.560> we

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
broader view of what is Canada and so we

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:22.320 
broader view of what is Canada and so we
were<00:04:20.859> looking<00:04:20.950> for<00:04:21.100> another<00:04:21.340> idea<00:04:21.760> to<00:04:22.000> present

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 
were looking for another idea to present

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:23.520 
were looking for another idea to present
and<00:04:22.510> this<00:04:22.630> is<00:04:22.750> the<00:04:22.840> first<00:04:22.870> year<00:04:23.229> that<00:04:23.290> we

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
and this is the first year that we

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.409 
and this is the first year that we
actually<00:04:23.830> curated<00:04:24.640> and<00:04:24.790> brought<00:04:25.300> the

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:25.419 
actually curated and brought the

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:28.200 
actually curated and brought the
exhibition<00:04:25.840> to<00:04:26.140> these<00:04:26.800> structures<00:04:27.340> so<00:04:27.370> we

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
exhibition to these structures so we

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:29.850 
exhibition to these structures so we
were<00:04:28.330> looking<00:04:28.600> at<00:04:28.720> something<00:04:29.110> that<00:04:29.320> would<00:04:29.440> be

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
were looking at something that would be

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.680 
were looking at something that would be
more<00:04:30.070> directed<00:04:30.520> towards<00:04:30.940> Toronto<00:04:31.510> and

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
more directed towards Toronto and

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.110 
more directed towards Toronto and
Ontario<00:04:32.110> and<00:04:32.740> so<00:04:32.919> the<00:04:33.039> green<00:04:33.250> belts<00:04:33.610> was<00:04:34.090> a

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
Ontario and so the green belts was a

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.190 
Ontario and so the green belts was a
perfect<00:04:34.570> fit<00:04:34.750> well<00:04:35.470> I<00:04:35.500> definitely

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:36.200 
perfect fit well I definitely

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.350 
perfect fit well I definitely
remember<00:04:36.680> seeing<00:04:36.980> the<00:04:37.160> huge<00:04:37.520> images<00:04:38.030> of<00:04:38.210> the

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
remember seeing the huge images of the

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.000 
remember seeing the huge images of the
boreal<00:04:38.720> forest<00:04:39.200> when<00:04:39.380> I<00:04:39.410> was<00:04:39.680> coming<00:04:39.980> down
