00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:19.140 
you want go to up to here you wanna go
to<00:03:14.160> start<00:03:15.160> the<00:03:15.370> driver<00:03:15.670> max<00:03:15.970> agent<00:03:17.970> do<00:03:18.970> this

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
to start the driver max agent do this

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:30.620 
to start the driver max agent do this
real<00:03:19.330> quick

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.390 

and<00:03:31.230> it's<00:03:31.350> already<00:03:31.560> running<00:03:31.710> it<00:03:31.860> for<00:03:31.950> me<00:03:32.100> so<00:03:32.370> I

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400

can't really show you what it is right
what's<00:03:35.070> going<00:03:35.280> to<00:03:35.340> be<00:03:35.460> if<00:03:36.300> you're<00:03:36.510> just<00:03:36.660> gone

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
what's going to be if you're just gone

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.320 
what's going to be if you're just gone
on<00:03:36.840> you're<00:03:37.800> just<00:03:37.890> going<00:03:38.130> to<00:03:38.190> kind<00:03:39.090> of<00:03:39.120> follow

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
on you're just going to kind of follow

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.780 
on you're just going to kind of follow
the<00:03:39.510> steps<00:03:39.750> it<00:03:39.870> shows<00:03:40.460> it's<00:03:41.460> going<00:03:41.610> to<00:03:41.670> look

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
the steps it shows it's going to look

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.790 
the steps it shows it's going to look
for<00:03:42.000> your<00:03:42.090> drivers<00:03:42.600> and<00:03:43.170> everything<00:03:43.500> it's

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
for your drivers and everything it's

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:44.630 
for your drivers and everything it's
going<00:03:43.890> to<00:03:43.980> look<00:03:44.040> for<00:03:44.160> all<00:03:44.280> your<00:03:44.460> available

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
going to look for all your available

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.610 
going to look for all your available
drivers<00:03:45.270> and<00:03:46.940> then<00:03:47.940> it's<00:03:48.660> going<00:03:48.840> to<00:03:48.960> pop<00:03:49.170> up<00:03:49.200> on

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
drivers and then it's going to pop up on

00:03:49.620 --> 00:04:01.620 
drivers and then it's going to pop up on
the<00:03:50.400> internet<00:03:50.790> site

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:10.309 

and<00:04:02.080> it's<00:04:02.560> going<00:04:02.800> to<00:04:03.010> look<00:04:03.340> something

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:12.050 

so<00:04:10.860> I<00:04:10.950> write<00:04:11.129> Internet's<00:04:11.730> take<00:04:11.879> a<00:04:11.909> little

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
so I write Internet's take a little

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.099 
so I write Internet's take a little
while<00:04:12.239> you<00:04:12.900> know<00:04:13.019> future<00:04:13.379> didn't<00:04:13.590> real<00:04:15.109> it's

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
while you know future didn't real it's

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:17.120 
while you know future didn't real it's
gonna<00:04:16.259> look<00:04:16.350> something<00:04:16.440> like<00:04:16.620> this

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
gonna look something like this

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.460 
gonna look something like this
here's<00:04:17.970> your<00:04:18.120> legend<00:04:18.449> if<00:04:18.690> you<00:04:18.930> had<00:04:19.079> the<00:04:19.199> latest

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:34.259 
going to have is this this is this is

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:36.590 
going to have is this this is this is
the<00:04:34.440> driver<00:04:34.680> that<00:04:35.669> you<00:04:35.729> download<00:04:36.180> it'll<00:04:36.449> make

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
the driver that you download it'll make

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.600 
the driver that you download it'll make
your<00:04:36.720> screen<00:04:36.930> less<00:04:37.080> blurry<00:04:37.410> there's<00:04:38.400> other

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
your screen less blurry there's other

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.520 
your screen less blurry there's other
ones<00:04:38.850> you<00:04:39.600> know<00:04:39.720> when<00:04:39.870> you<00:04:39.930> do<00:04:40.020> the<00:04:40.139> check<00:04:40.350> you

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
ones you know when you do the check you

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.920 
ones you know when you do the check you
might<00:04:40.650> have<00:04:40.800> the<00:04:40.919> X's<00:04:41.280> I<00:04:41.780> think<00:04:42.780> there's<00:04:42.900> only

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
might have the X's I think there's only

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.370 
might have the X's I think there's only
two<00:04:43.500> and<00:04:43.889> this<00:04:44.340> is<00:04:44.400> the<00:04:44.610> other<00:04:45.180> one<00:04:45.389> this<00:04:46.110> one's

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
two and this is the other one this one's

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.200 
two and this is the other one this one's
not<00:04:46.530> really<00:04:46.800> that<00:04:46.949> great<00:04:47.370> unless<00:04:47.940> you<00:04:48.090> know

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
not really that great unless you know

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.930 
not really that great unless you know
you<00:04:48.270> want<00:04:48.720> to<00:04:48.810> play<00:04:49.620> video<00:04:49.919> games<00:04:50.280> on<00:04:50.520> here<00:04:50.699> for

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
you want to play video games on here for

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:51.529 
you want to play video games on here for
some<00:04:51.060> reason

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:51.539 
some reason

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:54.950 
some reason
I<00:04:51.570> don't<00:04:52.289> know<00:04:52.380> that's<00:04:52.740> up<00:04:52.919> to<00:04:53.039> you<00:04:53.160> but<00:04:53.960> you

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
I don't know that's up to you but you

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.529 
I don't know that's up to you but you
want<00:04:55.410> to<00:04:55.470> hit<00:04:55.590> this<00:04:55.800> little<00:04:55.860> button<00:04:56.190> right<00:04:56.539> you

00:04:57.529 --> 00:04:57.539 
want to hit this little button right you

00:04:57.539 --> 00:04:59.689 
want to hit this little button right you
know<00:04:57.770> see<00:04:58.770> that's<00:04:58.949> going<00:04:59.160> down<00:04:59.220> let<00:04:59.490> you<00:04:59.550> drive

00:04:59.689 --> 00:04:59.699 
know see that's going down let you drive

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:01.909 
know see that's going down let you drive
it<00:04:59.849> for<00:05:00.000> you<00:05:00.120> it's<00:05:01.050> as<00:05:01.139> simple<00:05:01.289> as<00:05:01.500> that

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:01.919 
it for you it's as simple as that

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:04.490 
it for you it's as simple as that
then<00:05:02.490> you're<00:05:02.910> probably<00:05:03.060> on<00:05:03.240> the<00:05:03.330> run<00:05:03.630> you<00:05:04.380> know

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:04.500 
then you're probably on the run you know

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.700 
then you're probably on the run you know
runs<00:05:05.430> it<00:05:05.840> downloads<00:05:06.840> it<00:05:06.930> for<00:05:07.110> you<00:05:07.229> a<00:05:07.259> Python
