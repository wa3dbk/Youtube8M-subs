00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
a lot of mistakes this year as far as

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.479 
a lot of mistakes this year as far as
not<00:00:31.980> listening<00:00:32.399> to<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.610> body<00:00:34.010> you<00:00:35.010> know<00:00:35.160> just

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
not listening to the body you know just

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.459 
not listening to the body you know just

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
it's hard to really kind of cover it all

it's hard to really kind of cover it all
but<00:00:37.739> you<00:00:38.010> know<00:00:38.100> long<00:00:38.370> story<00:00:38.640> I<00:00:38.969> was<00:00:39.180> off<00:00:39.300> the

but you know long story I was off the

bike last year for nine months and a
long<00:00:42.930> time<00:00:43.200> every<00:00:43.530> time<00:00:43.649> even<00:00:43.890> when<00:00:44.070> I<00:00:44.129> got

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
long time every time even when I got

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.540 
long time every time even when I got
back<00:00:44.520> on<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.879> bike<00:00:45.890> it<00:00:46.890> just<00:00:47.100> never<00:00:47.219> felt

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
back on the bike it just never felt

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.790 
back on the bike it just never felt
right<00:00:47.820> um<00:00:48.210> you<00:00:49.110> know<00:00:49.140> I<00:00:49.230> had<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.500> have<00:00:49.590> surgery

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
right um you know I had to have surgery

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.799 
right um you know I had to have surgery
again<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:51.920> you<00:00:52.920> know<00:00:53.039> but<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:54.360> knees<00:00:54.600> not

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
again and you know but the knees not

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.990 
again and you know but the knees not
awesome<00:00:55.260> but<00:00:55.289> my<00:00:55.980> problems<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:56.699> not<00:00:56.789> my<00:00:56.940> knee

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
awesome but my problems and not my knee

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.610 
awesome but my problems and not my knee
you<00:00:57.300> know<00:00:57.420> I<00:00:57.449> think<00:00:57.629> my<00:00:57.930> knee<00:00:57.989> has<00:00:58.289> actually

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
you know I think my knee has actually

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.229 
you know I think my knee has actually
come<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.800> long<00:00:59.039> way<00:00:59.250> after<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.730> second<00:01:00.059> surgery

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
come a long way after the second surgery

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.160 
come a long way after the second surgery
and<00:01:01.129> where<00:01:02.129> you<00:01:02.879> know<00:01:03.000> I<00:01:03.030> think<00:01:03.420> were<00:01:03.510> 80%<00:01:03.809> of

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
and where you know I think were 80% of

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.440 
and where you know I think were 80% of
where<00:01:04.350> we<00:01:04.439> need<00:01:04.619> to<00:01:04.739> be<00:01:05.000> there's<00:01:06.000> just<00:01:06.119> maybe<00:01:06.330> a

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
where we need to be there's just maybe a

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.670 
where we need to be there's just maybe a
few<00:01:06.659> little<00:01:06.780> things<00:01:06.900> that<00:01:07.170> I<00:01:07.229> needed<00:01:07.409> tweaked

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
few little things that I needed tweaked

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.770 
few little things that I needed tweaked
for<00:01:08.010> some<00:01:08.340> reason<00:01:08.640> I'm<00:01:08.729> not<00:01:08.939> getting<00:01:09.360> my<00:01:09.540> full

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
for some reason I'm not getting my full

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.770 
for some reason I'm not getting my full
range<00:01:10.409> of<00:01:10.560> motion<00:01:10.700> and<00:01:11.700> I<00:01:12.060> think<00:01:12.299> that's<00:01:12.450> kind

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
range of motion and I think that's kind

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.530 
range of motion and I think that's kind
of<00:01:13.100> really<00:01:14.100> all<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.460> pain<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.210> they're

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
of really all the pain and they're

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.700 
of really all the pain and they're
really<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.900> only<00:01:15.990> struggle<00:01:16.290> that<00:01:16.439> I<00:01:16.500> have

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
really the only struggle that I have

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.399 
really the only struggle that I have
would<00:01:17.400> not<00:01:17.580> have<00:01:17.700> in<00:01:17.790> range<00:01:17.970> of<00:01:18.060> motion<00:01:18.409> riding

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
would not have in range of motion riding

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.630 
would not have in range of motion riding
outdoors<00:01:19.740> obviously<00:01:20.100> you've<00:01:20.220> daven<00:01:20.520> your

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
outdoors obviously you've daven your

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.890 
outdoors obviously you've daven your
knee<00:01:20.759> down<00:01:20.909> on<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.180> ground<00:01:21.360> on<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.750> ground

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
knee down on the ground on the ground

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.679 
knee down on the ground on the ground
and<00:01:22.409> basically<00:01:23.189> you<00:01:23.820> know<00:01:23.939> when<00:01:24.270> you<00:01:24.360> do<00:01:24.479> that

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
and basically you know when you do that

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:25.940 
and basically you know when you do that
you're<00:01:24.869> getting<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.229> a<00:01:25.259> point<00:01:25.439> where<00:01:25.560> you<00:01:25.740> push

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
you're getting to a point where you push

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.039 
you're getting to a point where you push
and<00:01:26.070> pass<00:01:26.280> that<00:01:26.549> range<00:01:27.450> of<00:01:27.570> motion<00:01:27.630> where

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
and pass that range of motion where

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.800 
and pass that range of motion where
you're<00:01:28.200> happy<00:01:28.470> places<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:29.659> that's<00:01:30.659> really

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
you're happy places and that's really

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.120 
you're happy places and that's really
the<00:01:30.930> only<00:01:31.020> thing<00:01:31.200> I'm<00:01:31.290> struggling<00:01:31.530> with<00:01:31.680> other

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
the only thing I'm struggling with other

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.890 
the only thing I'm struggling with other
than<00:01:32.369> that<00:01:32.490> is<00:01:32.670> my<00:01:32.939> knees<00:01:33.150> great<00:01:33.479> it's<00:01:33.689> fine

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
than that is my knees great it's fine

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.010 
than that is my knees great it's fine
strong<00:01:34.290> I<00:01:34.560> think<00:01:34.740> structurally<00:01:35.009> it's<00:01:35.310> fine

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
strong I think structurally it's fine

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.210 
strong I think structurally it's fine
but<00:01:37.020> yeah<00:01:37.170> just<00:01:37.409> got<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.650> got<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:37.890> work<00:01:38.070> that

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
but yeah just got to got to work that

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.730 
but yeah just got to got to work that
part<00:01:38.400> out<00:01:38.579> but<00:01:38.820> yeah<00:01:39.630> just<00:01:39.869> basically<00:01:40.439> health

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
part out but yeah just basically health

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.050 
part out but yeah just basically health
issues<00:01:41.130> you<00:01:41.280> know<00:01:41.369> just<00:01:41.610> hold<00:01:41.759> me<00:01:41.880> back<00:01:42.000> a

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
issues you know just hold me back a

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.370 
issues you know just hold me back a
little<00:01:42.150> bit<00:01:42.329> there's<00:01:42.990> always<00:01:43.200> speculation

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
little bit there's always speculation

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.469 
little bit there's always speculation
it's<00:01:44.040> part<00:01:44.340> of<00:01:44.430> our<00:01:44.549> industry<00:01:44.970> you<00:01:45.119> know<00:01:45.240> when

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
it's part of our industry you know when

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.480 
it's part of our industry you know when
one<00:01:45.720> minute<00:01:46.020> together<00:01:46.140> you<00:01:47.040> kind<00:01:47.220> of<00:01:47.280> go<00:01:47.399> from

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
one minute together you kind of go from

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.149 
one minute together you kind of go from
here<00:01:47.700> at<00:01:47.820> a<00:01:47.880> zero<00:01:48.149> so<00:01:48.450> nearly<00:01:49.350> as<00:01:49.770> good<00:01:49.920> as<00:01:50.040> your

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
here at a zero so nearly as good as your

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.850 
here at a zero so nearly as good as your
last<00:01:50.220> race<00:01:50.610> so<00:01:51.200> being<00:01:52.200> around<00:01:52.350> my<00:01:52.500> whole<00:01:52.649> life

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860

have a good understanding of it in

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.969 
have a good understanding of it in
there<00:01:55.650> it's<00:01:56.009> fickle<00:01:56.400> and<00:01:56.689> but<00:01:57.689> you<00:01:58.560> know<00:01:58.710> where

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
there it's fickle and but you know where

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.999
