00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:08.019
 connect a conventional active microphone 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:11.769
 for video surveillance systems 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:12.889
 They are usually three-wire to 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:19.359
 video recorder 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:22.699
 or api camera three - wire microphone 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:27.320
 responsibly and they are red it is + black 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:32.029
 It is a minus and the total and then transfer it 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:36.880
 sound on combo to faith 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:40.190
 here I have seams 30 12 in the example goes 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:42.320
 this yellow wire is braided braid 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:48.410
 this is to minus that is to say we are minus and black 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:50.590
 today together here are the three wires that is 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.590
 on 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:59.109
 this is how we connect the yellow to the first 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.080
 black with black braid red 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.080
 red 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.180
 all this country country microphone 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:14.990
 the inclusion registrar will be a little bit 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:19.530
 differently we are braided cable me and 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:22.320
 we connect central vein on bnc 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:29.460
 plug remember to put on pro linc like me 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:30.619
 Now I tried and now I will not press 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:36.000
 to end 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:40.770
 that twisted floor so it was hooked 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.200
 why that he did not drop them example 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.580
 everything is connected there 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:48.770
 spun che we need to apply 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:54.229
 there is nothing to do with it 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:54.229
 connector but this connector 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:12.600
 there is a plus or minus 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.600
 red is + black tu minus 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.610
 disabled real 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.660
 for microphone power here's weird 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:39.000
 Registration connector to make it more convenient 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:41.660
 disconnect us it will be the microphone to 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.660
 the truth . 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:47.380
 a microphone jack 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.580
 without and traded shy just active 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.380
 here is the power connector 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:08.660
 suitable conventional plug let's say in 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:10.790
 power supply you are 1205 there and just 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:15.710
 wires can take the camera still 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:19.130
 somehow here first here this 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:21.650
 microphone must be assembled to connect 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:27.110
 what kind of camera do we have special 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:31.250
 there is one connector on one side 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:33.680
 Bedrooms jack other cases 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:37.900
 spring or right or left channel 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.900
 choose and in camera 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.640
 connection
