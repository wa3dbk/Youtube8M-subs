00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:15.819 
to dodge punches get out of the way and

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:17.250 
to dodge punches get out of the way and
i<00:03:16.000> can<00:03:16.150> actually<00:03:16.300> counter<00:03:16.780> off<00:03:16.930> an<00:03:17.110> easement

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
i can actually counter off an easement

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.949 
i can actually counter off an easement
as<00:03:17.590> well<00:03:17.830> so<00:03:18.340> here<00:03:18.640> i<00:03:18.670> can<00:03:18.910> counter<00:03:19.209> back<00:03:19.390> and

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
as well so here i can counter back and

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:21.630 
as well so here i can counter back and
we<00:03:20.050> have<00:03:20.140> this<00:03:20.260> concept<00:03:20.620> of<00:03:20.739> risk<00:03:20.920> reward<00:03:21.190> if<00:03:21.550> i

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
we have this concept of risk reward if i

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.610 
we have this concept of risk reward if i
do<00:03:21.700> these<00:03:21.970> front<00:03:22.269> leading<00:03:22.810> space<00:03:23.290> that's

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
do these front leading space that's

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.350 
do these front leading space that's
going<00:03:23.800> to<00:03:23.860> be<00:03:23.980> less<00:03:24.160> risky<00:03:24.549> for<00:03:24.760> me<00:03:24.790> as<00:03:25.060> opposed

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
going to be less risky for me as opposed

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.809 
going to be less risky for me as opposed
to<00:03:25.510> a<00:03:25.540> left-to-right<00:03:26.080> leading<00:03:26.830> sway<00:03:27.069> and<00:03:27.340> the

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
counter the result encounter is going to

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.470 
counter the result encounter is going to
be<00:03:29.470> more<00:03:29.650> powerful<00:03:29.970> last<00:03:30.970> year<00:03:31.120> the<00:03:31.239> game<00:03:31.360> was

GSP a lot of great advice you can see be

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:46.010 
GSP a lot of great advice you can see be
in<00:05:44.520> the<00:05:44.610> background<00:05:44.760> they're<00:05:45.120> very<00:05:45.510> vey<00:05:45.720> but

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:46.020 
in the background they're very vey but

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:56.629 
in the background they're very vey but
that's<00:05:46.170> not<00:05:46.200> going<00:05:46.410> again

00:05:56.629 --> 00:05:56.639 

00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:59.939 

take<00:05:57.639> a<00:05:57.669> look<00:05:57.819> at<00:05:57.940> action<00:05:58.630> here<00:05:58.870> so<00:05:59.289> utilizing

00:05:59.939 --> 00:05:59.949 
take a look at action here so utilizing

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:01.710 
take a look at action here so utilizing
those<00:06:00.190> in<00:06:00.400> a<00:06:00.460> quarter<00:06:00.729> circle<00:06:01.000> turns<00:06:01.180> there

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:01.720 
those in a quarter circle turns there

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.420 
those in a quarter circle turns there
you<00:06:01.960> know<00:06:02.080> obviously<00:06:02.229> I<00:06:02.440> can<00:06:02.590> perform<00:06:03.009> throws

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:03.430 
you know obviously I can perform throws

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:06.240 
you know obviously I can perform throws
for<00:06:03.789> that<00:06:03.819> again<00:06:04.810> so<00:06:05.080> it's<00:06:05.380> basically<00:06:05.740> taking

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:06.250 
for that again so it's basically taking

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:07.499 
for that again so it's basically taking
a<00:06:06.310> dynamic<00:06:06.759> that<00:06:06.849> we<00:06:06.970> felt<00:06:07.150> was<00:06:07.300> very

00:06:07.499 --> 00:06:07.509 
a dynamic that we felt was very

00:06:07.509 --> 00:06:09.480 
a dynamic that we felt was very
effective<00:06:07.990> and<00:06:08.139> then<00:06:08.259> applying<00:06:08.560> it<00:06:08.770> to<00:06:08.800> other

something<00:06:20.919> that<00:06:21.069> I<00:06:21.220> think<00:06:21.280> made<00:06:21.550> the<00:06:21.580> game

00:06:21.779 --> 00:06:21.789 
something that I think made the game

00:06:21.789 --> 00:06:31.110 
something that I think made the game
play<00:06:22.000> a<00:06:22.030> lot<00:06:22.270> better<00:06:28.710> so<00:06:29.729> going<00:06:30.729> back<00:06:30.849> to<00:06:31.090> that

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:31.120 
play a lot better so going back to that

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.120 
play a lot better so going back to that
