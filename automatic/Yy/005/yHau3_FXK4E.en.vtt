00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:18.240
 we will prepare a recipe for the 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.250
 great for kids anyway 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.340
 can be prepared with children with 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.350
 yes yes very good tip thanks to 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.010
 the use of a microwave especially 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.840
 whirlpool crisis handset will be able to 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.399
 to make a floating island with caramel and 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.130
 almonds hours you will see it's 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.739
 extremely easy the white sheep 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.050
 like magic in the microwave 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.940
 it takes barely two minutes and we have 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.680
 tent islands on which we did not 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.210
 more than add a milk caramel 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.160
 some broken almonds 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.820
 it's very fast we go right now 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.750
 we will prepare the whites 2 3 whites 2 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.020
 for this recipe 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.090
 I'm going to climb them by hand on the 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:01.070
 weight of sugar we put a tiny 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.070
 part of sugar points at the beginning 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:10.100
 here are the whites are almost climb on 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.900
 add the end of the sugar and we will be able to 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.790
 to squeeze them that is to say the crazy ones were 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.090
 very very strong to complete the effect 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.090
 technical rebound 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:46.579
 whites are now enough 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.630
 climb is cooked we will be able to get them out 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:50.479
 directly 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.820
 we will drop the spoon and caramel 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:53.869
 dairy in the little hollow that has 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.180
 formed during cooking 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:57.920
 I am crushed a few fines that 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.720
 we can have done just a little bit 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.070
 possibly grilled in an oven 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.049
 for a few seconds 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.850
 the mounted whites are finished that's 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:06.850
 really child's play with almost a 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.500
 magic trick in the oven 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.780
 especially it's a recipe to make and 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.349
 enjoy with the little ones I 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.349
 also benefits
