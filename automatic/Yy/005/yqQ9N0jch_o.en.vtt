00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 my people today I show time update 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.470
 video to mister crayfish sneer murder 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:11.660
 because there was a major update with 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.660
 even more cool furniture a lot of fun 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.849
 so please do not turn off because I 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.439
 I 've already seen this 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:27.599
 murder you have ever imagined 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.789
 I link here a video to the 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.129
 previous presentation there you see 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.720
 Show all the furniture that existed now 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:35.160
 So I just look at the update 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.930
 s.besten both videos on 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.290
 if you do not know murder yet 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.000
 so we just start with the 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.260
 small innovations are now available 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 an oven to get out of it 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.129
 iron blocks and an oven forces and 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.780
 In this oven, you can then nine 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:57.869
 but things are burning 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.369
 without own source so without coal or 

00:00:57.869 --> 00:01:02.670
 wood but you can just there 

00:00:59.369 --> 00:01:04.500
 clean and then let cook 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.060
 Furthermore, there is now a small one 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.490
 night cupboard in which you again 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.009
 something can stow a little 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.560
 update to the previous mod you can 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:15.240
 bail now infinitely expand 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.009
 because now this is not a two couch 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.970
 but a simple armchair and more 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.140
 which can then finally 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.329
 put side by side 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.359
 then there is just such a small one 

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:26.490
 Hood next time for such a 

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:28.920
 hood for the oven 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.950
 to bake from iron and to kill one 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.020
 forces then we come to the garden 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.759
 update because the update what now 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.920
 The result is garden update 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.929
 why garden because a lot of garden 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.079
 things have been added, for example, the hedge 

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:45.630
 as simple as a bush as a leaf 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:48.319
 stop is just thinner and like a hedge 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:52.770
 The gibbs look old then everyone 

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:54.799
 from each sheet 7 leaf remains nice 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.020
 that's how you get the power out of six 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:02:01.020
 scroll and then you get four hedges 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.969
 that and that are the hacking 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.319
 then there is such a small one 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.389
 white fence 

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:08.459
 because now they are fans and the 

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:10.140
 you force yourself out of the window of the 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.600
 fence and floor we will get you 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.970
 Two-wheelers and these behave 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.910
 Just like normal fences just stop 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.130
 white and thinner then there is still 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.080
 What cool thing I find so cool 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.810
 a stone path you look at the floor 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.129
 can put if you have the power and 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.170
 which was of course, they placed them 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:30.090
 is logical and you can get it 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.800
 then build a nice stone away 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.120
 I have done here now then asks 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.459
 you look at how forces is a 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.459
 stone away from two stones then gets 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:41.670
 There are eight stone path blocks in the back 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:45.480
 then a water pump the forces one 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:47.010
 Made of stone and iron, the power is nothing 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.140
 they can not pump water or anything 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.099
 but it just looks nice where you are 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:55.560
 can stone ways over water placed 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:59.549
 we would like that just as have 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:01.080
 i made it so ok with a little one 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:03.000
 trick can apparently be on stone 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.880
 but I was over water 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.170
 the water pump so it simply looks 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.660
 like a water pump you can 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.220
 put it anywhere you want it 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.079
 and then that 's just like one 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.310
 Water pump what I already said 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:15.720
 so can you can then 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.879
 many of them are sitting here 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.129
 but you can not pump water from it 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:22.950
 then there is such a little bird bath so 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:25.440
 a birdbath which is automatically with 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.480
 water filled and it looks like that 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.549
 you can not do it because that 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.829
 why furniture motto beautify something 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:33.420
 the strong one is made of stone and 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:36.630
 without water the water is automatic 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.310
 in there then at the end there are 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.269
 letterbox I think that's really cool 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.799
 if you look a little now 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:42.900
 Property has built with the hedge 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:44.370
 and in steinweg it is so mailbox 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.470
 and then you can see if you post 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.079
 has gotten yes you post gets 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.220
 here a hedge was sent by 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:52.049
 some nice guy 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:55.739
 no you can just six things in there 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:58.049
 stow and yes that was it 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:01.650
 first of the torture again that 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:03.810
 the update finally blocks 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.370
 big garden update and if you like that 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.440
 want to see complete review with the 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.450
 previous example, the sofa the 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:12.840
 tables of styles and all kinds 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:14.760
 barriers and all that if 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.430
 you want to see that then click here 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.750
 Somewhere on it is a picture now and 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.660
 what I almost forgot to say 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.979
 This mod is texture pack compatible 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.510
 I would now have another texture pack 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:26.130
 Of course I do not install something 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.690
 have prepared as I am then 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.190
 For example, they would hack 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.050
 fit into the texture pack 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.930
 the stones also because you can see how 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.520
 the stone texture and so on , well that 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.280
 was it really from the mister 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.909
 craig abbott update video namely times 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.909
