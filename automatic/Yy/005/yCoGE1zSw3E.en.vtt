is i think diablo 3 has the potential to

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.930 
is i think diablo 3 has the potential to
be<00:00:32.489> an<00:00:32.609> amazing<00:00:32.969> game<00:00:33.420> but<00:00:34.020> that<00:00:34.140> potential

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:34.940

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:36.749 
that potential is going to need some

00:00:36.749 --> 00:00:38.930 
that potential is going to need some
work<00:00:37.289> and<00:00:37.499> some<00:00:37.649> input<00:00:38.129> from<00:00:38.159> blizzard<00:00:38.699> in<00:00:38.879> the
