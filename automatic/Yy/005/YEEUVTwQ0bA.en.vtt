putting a big steel door on a garage I

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.450 
putting a big steel door on a garage I
mean<00:01:52.350> at<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.530> end<00:01:52.560> of<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:52.890> day<00:01:53.040> it's<00:01:53.250> a<00:01:53.280> big

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
mean at the end of the day it's a big

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.219 
mean at the end of the day it's a big
steel<00:01:53.729> door<00:01:54.030> with<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.600> prize<00:01:54.780> energy

shooting<00:01:55.500> up<00:01:55.740> which<00:01:56.369> is<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.880> constant

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
shooting up which is the constant

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.749 
shooting up which is the constant
consideration<00:01:57.960> though<00:01:58.369> it's<00:01:59.369> a<00:01:59.430> big<00:01:59.579> steel

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
consideration though it's a big steel

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.340 
consideration though it's a big steel
door<00:01:59.939> knock<00:02:00.119> off<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.299> letter<00:02:00.509> huge<00:02:00.990> amount<00:02:01.229> of

a<00:02:01.799> huge<00:02:02.340> amount<00:02:02.549> of<00:02:02.670> cold<00:02:02.850> in<00:02:03.659> fact<00:02:03.840> it<00:02:03.960> does

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
a huge amount of cold in fact it does

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.450 
a huge amount of cold in fact it does
the<00:02:04.170> opposite<00:02:04.500> because<00:02:04.679> even<00:02:05.250> though<00:02:05.340> the

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
the opposite because even though the

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.709 
the opposite because even though the

because under Buddha polyester coated

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.790 
because under Buddha polyester coated
it's<00:02:08.729> actually<00:02:09.149> a<00:02:09.390> sandwich<00:02:10.080> construction<00:02:10.379> so

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
it's actually a sandwich construction so

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.170 
it's actually a sandwich construction so

was<00:03:37.010> installed<00:03:37.489> the<00:03:37.579> operator<00:03:37.909> so<00:03:38.780> that<00:03:39.290> the

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
was installed the operator so that the

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
resistance it'll reverse and it would be

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.719 
resistance it'll reverse and it would be
sensitive<00:04:42.530> enough<00:04:42.620> photos<00:04:43.010> very<00:04:43.340> sensitive

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:43.729 
sensitive enough photos very sensitive

certainly very quiet but what were the

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.650 
certainly very quiet but what were the
