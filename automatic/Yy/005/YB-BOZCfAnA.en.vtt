00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
people close to go one way and then

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:06.490 
people close to go one way and then
those<00:01:05.150> who<00:01:05.300> were<00:01:05.420> told<00:01:05.600> us<00:01:05.690> to<00:01:05.840> go<00:01:05.960> another<00:01:06.200> way

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
those who were told us to go another way

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.560

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
the entire time we're standing in lines

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.200 
the entire time we're standing in lines
that<00:01:08.900> are<00:01:08.990> not<00:01:09.470> correct<00:01:09.860> for<00:01:09.979> us<00:01:10.190> and<00:01:10.700> I<00:01:11.180> was

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
that are not correct for us and I was

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.480 
that are not correct for us and I was
really<00:01:11.630> really<00:01:11.780> upset<00:01:12.100> really<00:01:13.100> really<00:01:13.370> upset

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
really really upset really really upset

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
really really upset really really upset
in<00:01:13.940> fact<00:01:14.180> I<00:01:14.680> told<00:01:15.680> off<00:01:15.830> one<00:01:16.070> girl<00:01:16.310> because<00:01:17.300> she

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:17.510 
in fact I told off one girl because she

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.719 
in fact I told off one girl because she
told<00:01:17.690> us<00:01:17.900> to<00:01:18.110> go<00:01:18.260> get<00:01:18.800> our<00:01:18.920> luggage<00:01:19.130> and

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
told us to go get our luggage and

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.560 
told us to go get our luggage and
recheck<00:01:20.630> it<00:01:20.660> but<00:01:21.110> the<00:01:21.470> luggage<00:01:22.270> needed<00:01:23.270> to<00:01:23.420> be

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
recheck it but the luggage needed to be

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.270 
recheck it but the luggage needed to be
gotten<00:01:23.960> it<00:01:24.170> was<00:01:24.320> already<00:01:24.530> sent<00:01:24.860> to<00:01:24.920> the<00:01:25.040> plane

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
gotten it was already sent to the plane

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.730 
gotten it was already sent to the plane
so<00:01:25.610> we<00:01:25.729> spent<00:01:26.000> about<00:01:26.119> 30<00:01:26.479> minutes<00:01:26.840> literally

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
so we spent about 30 minutes literally

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.480 
so we spent about 30 minutes literally
running<00:01:28.660> running<00:01:29.660> around<00:01:30.590> all<00:01:30.920> of<00:01:31.220> the<00:01:31.250> bell

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
running running around all of the bell

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.650 
running running around all of the bell
tracks<00:01:31.759> that<00:01:32.540> held<00:01:32.750> a<00:01:32.840> look<00:01:33.040> then<00:01:34.040> what<00:01:34.250> oh

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:34.660 
tracks that held a look then what oh

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.420 
tracks that held a look then what oh
then<00:01:35.660> we<00:01:35.840> wanted<00:01:36.080> to<00:01:36.170> go<00:01:36.320> to<00:01:36.380> our<00:01:36.979> transfer

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
then we wanted to go to our transfer

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.249 
then we wanted to go to our transfer
destination<00:01:37.580> but<00:01:38.570> someone<00:01:38.869> sent<00:01:39.080> us<00:01:39.140> to

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
destination but someone sent us to

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:40.990 
destination but someone sent us to
international<00:01:40.040> transfers<00:01:40.520> which<00:01:40.729> makes

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
international transfers which makes

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.609 
international transfers which makes
sense<00:01:41.270> but<00:01:41.630> apparently<00:01:42.080> that's<00:01:42.200> for<00:01:42.530> the

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
sense but apparently that's for the

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:44.469 
sense but apparently that's for the
outside<00:01:43.100> and<00:01:43.640> then<00:01:43.759> we<00:01:43.910> had<00:01:44.119> to<00:01:44.149> go<00:01:44.300> outside

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
outside and then we had to go outside

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:47.650 
outside and then we had to go outside
the<00:01:45.350> good<00:01:45.500> news<00:01:45.680> is<00:01:45.710> we<00:01:46.220> saw<00:01:46.430> the<00:01:47.030> Olympic

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:47.660 
the good news is we saw the Olympic

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.260 
the good news is we saw the Olympic
countdown<00:01:48.320> sign<00:01:48.890> so<00:01:49.430> I<00:01:49.490> got<00:01:49.610> a<00:01:49.640> picture<00:01:49.850> taken

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270
