00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:06.270
 hello and welcome to this new area that remains on the universe of 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.290
 la licra today very short chapters to introduce you to the house 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.710
 I built so that on the port the server is as young as 

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:19.470
 that death is by that the main facade I would say that the 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.819
 four columns of life the ground floor 

00:00:22.819 --> 00:00:26.209
 and windows with facts dozens of poles 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.520
 the duo that we fight began to disappear pavement and so we arrive 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:32.829
 on one side in london 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:34.330
 so with 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.000
 an armchair in it a carpet on the floor 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.840
 a desk 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.320
 so with the options men &amp; ballen 5% 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.010
 know the amount that we have to vote on us 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:46.870
 in the name because 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.160
 we have soderling shops ad that licha ndongou with their legs you 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.110
 can you buy fine wood 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.589
 the dispute between except that's what 

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:56.760
 the lesotho proposed 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.360
 here we are in the first Russian civil chamber who realized it thank you 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.770
 well 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.770
 with them a column of the cross section 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:07.770
 these differences in fact the two rooms is why it is terraced 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.110
 and so little luck and allow that he realized in a little style 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.110
 little different for a small office corner here 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.740
 % and floor wood 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.820
 and then a room apart from the publisher I would have stone 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.320
 to limit women 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.020
 so here a little garden shed 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.360
 the swimming pool 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.420
 with lighting the endorsement that makes it is elsewhere 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.270
 and inside the pool 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.150
 here is a little corner and umbrellas 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.340
 so that's the same it's the signature of tornadoes 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.600
 especially the small panels of his side eliminated in simple mail and the 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.940
 sunbeds trees 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.460
 and that gives straight on the beach on the water or on the greenhouse so it's rather 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:01.770
 pretty 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.670
 and if so that's what home looks like 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.320
 so here I was happy that he wandered from a house that I could find 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.369
 on different design citizens 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.699
 that I admit it gives good ideas of series then the realization after 

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:16.479
 all the debt is in hell on my nature guitar 

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:18.859
 it gives things really not bad 

00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:21.719
 so there two columns of Africa but also outside and 

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:24.719
 interior 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:31.139
 we see here the green that is really all around more here so the green 

00:02:31.139 --> 00:02:34.139
 to allow to eliminate the room sic 

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:38.889
 gaudin originally so the judge did not want but green here but hey 

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:43.249
 port that was inhabited had avoided the fashions in the house I am and I had to 

00:02:43.249 --> 00:02:44.549
 make this choice 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:48.659
 bolani what says to go up to the storied and that's really the tasks 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:51.649
 I love the most here in germany 

00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:55.169
 the balcony that gives no pieroni therefore takes the 

00:02:55.169 --> 00:02:56.409
 the living room 

00:02:56.409 --> 00:03:00.449
 with tons of ice blocks it's the same and bright embedded and bone 

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:03.849
 when the floor between the two been bought 3 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:06.670
 brick thick I think it's a good compromise to be able to do this 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.709
 we want 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:12.099
 so here the little fireplace corner the kitchen area 

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:17.089
 with the worktop the water source the seats 

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:19.879
 this way 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:21.579
 alpha his bar 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:25.119
 the kitchen fitted with the backlighting remains a notch in 

00:03:25.119 --> 00:03:28.119
 below a fridge of the coffers of the ovens 

00:03:28.649 --> 00:03:30.579
 what to eat in the coffers 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:34.180
 so here I liked the fact of raising the kitchen I find 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.119
 it gives a nice little effect 

00:03:37.119 --> 00:03:40.659
 so neither he nor his work plans by gervinho blocks and blogs from 

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:42.359
 Laussonne 

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:44.859
 and of course since it's still a house with a trace 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:45.889
 and chests 

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:48.889
 so that the house is still functional equality 

00:03:51.249 --> 00:03:54.249
 yaman of iron of gold a lot of things 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:59.290
 and the little touch even launched the diving board that allows you to jump 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.290
 Arctic 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:08.930
 relaxed all for them the visit today i had told you this is 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:09.879
 very fast 

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:12.900
 it's to show you a little inside the house and what we 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.569
 could do in cra what was pretty cool 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:17.000
 Thank you for seeing alberto
