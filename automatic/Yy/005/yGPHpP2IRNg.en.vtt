00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:41.330 
and we stayed like a couple of hours in

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.560 
and we stayed like a couple of hours in
the<00:05:41.570> summit<00:05:41.900> just<00:05:42.460> watching<00:05:43.460> my<00:05:43.820> friends<00:05:44.210> you

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:46.720 
the summit just watching my friends you
know<00:05:44.690> flying<00:05:45.020> from<00:05:45.530> the<00:05:45.620> top<00:05:45.800> so<00:05:46.280> it<00:05:46.400> was<00:05:46.550> just

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:46.730 
know flying from the top so it was just

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:50.140 
know flying from the top so it was just
great<00:05:47.060> and<00:05:47.240> you<00:05:47.930> know<00:05:47.960> two<00:05:48.500> hours<00:05:48.800> was<00:05:49.070> like<00:05:49.760> 20

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:50.150 
great and you know two hours was like 20

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:52.060 
great and you know two hours was like 20
minutes<00:05:50.450> so<00:05:51.170> the<00:05:51.290> way<00:05:51.410> that<00:05:51.530> was<00:05:51.650> very<00:05:51.710> good
