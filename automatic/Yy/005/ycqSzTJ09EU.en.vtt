big-ass pile of wood with the plan is as

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.270 
big-ass pile of wood with the plan is as
we<00:00:51.730> lay<00:00:52.730> our<00:00:52.910> wood<00:00:53.210> down<00:00:53.480> that<00:00:53.750> way<00:00:54.280> parallel

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
we lay our wood down that way parallel

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.460 
we lay our wood down that way parallel
going<00:00:55.910> up<00:00:56.030> across<00:00:56.210> that<00:00:56.810> way<00:00:56.989> on<00:00:57.200> that<00:00:57.410> same

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:57.470 
going up across that way on that same

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.120 
going up across that way on that same
and<00:00:57.950> we<00:00:58.130> put<00:00:58.370> our<00:00:58.579> stunning<00:00:59.230> the<00:01:00.230> pond<00:01:00.590> itself

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:01.130 
and we put our stunning the pond itself

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.650 
and we put our stunning the pond itself
is<00:01:01.520> going<00:01:01.880> to<00:01:02.059> be<00:01:02.239> about<00:01:02.770> right<00:01:03.770> here<00:01:04.160> and<00:01:04.660> it's

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:05.660 
is going to be about right here and it's

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.900 
is going to be about right here and it's
going<00:01:06.259> to<00:01:06.320> be<00:01:06.470> about<00:01:06.619> eight<00:01:07.040> foot<00:01:07.310> long<00:01:07.369> by

three feet wide by three feet deep so

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.980 
three feet wide by three feet deep so
it's<00:01:11.330> going<00:01:11.479> to<00:01:11.540> be<00:01:11.740> pretty<00:01:12.740> cool<00:01:13.040> and<00:01:13.990> indoor

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
it's going to be pretty cool and indoor

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:22.959 
it's going to be pretty cool and indoor
palm<00:01:15.320> support

00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:22.969 

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:25.160 

she's<00:01:23.969> actually<00:01:24.149> going<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.630> be<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:24.810> trade

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
she's actually going to be a trade

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.529 
she's actually going to be a trade
framework<00:01:25.979> for<00:01:26.219> a<00:01:26.250> trellis<00:01:26.759> wall<00:01:27.030> it's<00:01:27.299> going

00:01:27.529 --> 00:01:27.539 
framework for a trellis wall it's going

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:30.230 
framework for a trellis wall it's going
to<00:01:27.600> go<00:01:27.719> that<00:01:27.960> way<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.700> all<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.850> way<00:01:29.939> to<00:01:30.000> that

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
to go that way and all the way to that

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.480 
to go that way and all the way to that
end<00:01:30.509> there's<00:01:30.750> going<00:01:30.899> to<00:01:30.990> be<00:01:31.049> a<00:01:31.170> door<00:01:31.560> it's

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
end there's going to be a door it's

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.580 
end there's going to be a door it's
going<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:32.700> be<00:01:32.850> trellis<00:01:33.360> with<00:01:33.630> a<00:01:33.659> vines<00:01:34.200> growing

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
going to be trellis with a vines growing

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.819 
going to be trellis with a vines growing
so<00:01:35.039> the<00:01:35.539> the<00:01:36.539> fish<00:01:36.750> room<00:01:36.990> here<00:01:37.229> is<00:01:37.350> going<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.649> be

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
so the the fish room here is going to be

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.200 
so the the fish room here is going to be
a<00:01:37.860> combination<00:01:38.310> as<00:01:38.850> an<00:01:39.299> arboretum<00:01:39.860> and<00:01:41.210> this

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
a combination as an arboretum and this

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.020 
a combination as an arboretum and this
will<00:01:42.360> save<00:01:42.539> us<00:01:42.600> from<00:01:42.929> needing<00:01:43.289> to<00:01:43.470> bring<00:01:43.740> the

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
will save us from needing to bring the

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.730 
will save us from needing to bring the
indoor<00:01:45.030> house<00:01:45.329> plants<00:01:45.869> in<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.229> out<00:01:46.350> in<00:01:46.590> and

just violent like that um this has a

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.770 
just violent like that um this has a
little<00:02:29.220> bit<00:02:29.489> of<00:02:29.549> a<00:02:29.730> gap<00:02:29.940> e<00:02:30.120> all<00:02:30.420> right<00:02:30.569> that

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
little bit of a gap e all right that

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.809

aren't going to matter it off I know I
know<00:02:35.100> our<00:02:35.280> trellis<00:02:35.910> is<00:02:36.090> gonna<00:02:36.359> righty<00:02:39.350> but<00:02:40.350> we

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
know our trellis is gonna righty but we

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:47.090 
know our trellis is gonna righty but we
be<00:02:40.680> able<00:02:40.829> to<00:02:41.010> screw<00:02:41.310> that<00:02:41.489> into<00:02:45.889> okay<00:02:46.889> because

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
be able to screw that into okay because

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.970 
be able to screw that into okay because
there<00:02:47.250> is<00:02:47.370> a<00:02:47.400> bit<00:02:47.609> of<00:02:47.639> a<00:02:47.790> framework<00:02:48.530> oh<00:02:49.530> yeah<00:02:49.889> I

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
there is a bit of a framework oh yeah I

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.590 
there is a bit of a framework oh yeah I
know<00:02:50.100> but<00:02:50.459> I'm<00:02:50.579> just<00:02:50.609> saying<00:02:50.940> as<00:02:51.120> far<00:02:51.329> because

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
know but I'm just saying as far because

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.259 
know but I'm just saying as far because
you<00:02:51.870> don't<00:02:52.049> want<00:02:52.109> this<00:02:52.440> to<00:02:52.500> shift<00:02:52.980> from<00:02:53.970> side

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
you don't want this to shift from side

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.150 
you don't want this to shift from side
to<00:02:54.480> side<00:02:54.510> or<00:02:54.750> anything<00:02:55.260> you<00:02:55.380> want<00:02:55.410> it<00:02:55.709> to<00:02:55.829> stay

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
to side or anything you want it to stay

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.370 
to side or anything you want it to stay
and<00:02:56.549> you<00:02:57.000> don't<00:02:57.180> want<00:02:57.389> the<00:02:57.540> wood<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:57.780> split

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
and you don't want the wood the split

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.199 
and you don't want the wood the split
when<00:02:58.590> you<00:02:58.739> when<00:02:59.010> you<00:02:59.040> screw<00:02:59.489> in<00:02:59.639> to<00:02:59.760> merge<00:02:59.970> it

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
when you when you screw in to merge it

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:01.970 
when you when you screw in to merge it
so<00:03:00.450> don't<00:03:00.870> worry<00:03:00.959> about<00:03:01.079> that<00:03:01.470> even<00:03:01.769> if<00:03:01.859> it

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
so don't worry about that even if it
