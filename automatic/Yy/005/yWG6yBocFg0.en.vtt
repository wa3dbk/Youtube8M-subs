00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.090

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.470
 proud to present 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.970

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.740
 hearts well exactly is heart is one 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.210
 student rally team of hand car 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.820
 motivate arnhem 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.340
 we maintain and rally car we race 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.829
 on the Dutch entire paths and 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.560
 do everything with myself 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:55.399
 they are public relations 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:58.100
 call management functions engineering function 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:59.989
 him by students and for fun 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.520
 they don't get any credits for us 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:04.129
 get nothing 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.269
 extra English exemptions really need 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.920
 for being paid anyway 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:08.470
 absolutely and that is by sponsoring well 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.970
 you see the pleasure stickers of 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:14.810
 moving the car save a lot 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:17.960
 save in the old car that peugeot die 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:21.140
 does the scrap heap top or hurts 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.030
 really away to work but what is true yes 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.920
 driving after five years of the 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.780
 old peugeot it was time for one 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.880
 successor and a new challenge 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.590
 the team meanwhile released pujol far 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.420
 further developed and with this a good one 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.090
 maintained and cleaned before and after 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.160
 and rally the team with these new cars 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.320
 again able to move a few years ahead 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.009
 to be able and to do what they really do well 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.140
 in his 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:44.180
 innovate the search for new ones 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.280
 number was not exactly easy we 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.440
 have every five years is bit normal 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.470
 that you get a new car with team 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.180
 this is ready as in the developed yes 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.930
 all 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:58.160
 most extreme things are done 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.780
 so we started looking for new ones 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:03.470
 car where again could innovate 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:07.189
 and new things can adjust new ones 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.780
 so this one can make that search through this one 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:11.330
 car was not easy huh 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:14.120
 no you have lasted a lot for two years 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:17.510
 save when I walk know the service 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.190
 bus from the half year ago or so 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.810
 not helped 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.760
 then you start looking for a car that 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.640
 is affordable which is cheap quickly 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.630
 maintenance is good he is really huge 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.860
 for preconditions we must meet 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.950
 meet 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.480
 a fellow student team so yes yes you have one 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.160
 professional team then yes 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.380
 get easier anyway but because so 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.910
 have worked hard with all his thinking 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.470
 or luck 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.350
 what makes this car better for that 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:45.920
 of competition from competition 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.420
 he is new this one is from 2013 in it 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.280
 championship now do not drive much new 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.120
 cars around it so I expect this one 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.370
 last longer 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.410
 more reliable and ultimately we 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.549
 are all religious he? 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.920
 propose 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:59.140
 I did when I was expecting you 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.630
 yes we go a lot with this car 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.340
 draw attention because it is it until now 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.870
 back at first so in Netherlands 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.180
 We are going with the first in Netherlands 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.970
 So why do you watch a lot of attention with it 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.160
 but also cool to other sponsors 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.390
 new sponsors 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.120
 as if the team were still looking at magazines 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:19.270
 new levels appear in terms of spa 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:23.080
 finances also especially challenge pleasure 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:24.340
 sure he is now about 140 hp and 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.230
 still want to go to the under 90 two 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.500
 Well that is a long way to go 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.569
 to go 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.100
 it seems a little steps so it 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:32.350
 first year will take it easy to 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.000
 after that it really wants to screw it up 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.010
 clearly the team is out at a car 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.319
 how do they come and meets all requirements 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:41.110
 therefore reliably cheap in fast 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:45.569
 maintenance and how much chance of innovation 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:45.569
 and besides, it looks fantastic
