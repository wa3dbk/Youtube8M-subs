00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
received to do a review of creatine

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.470 
received to do a review of creatine
hydrochloride<00:00:10.650> supplements<00:00:11.550> and<00:00:11.700> so<00:00:12.300> that's

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
hydrochloride supplements and so that's

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.980 
hydrochloride supplements and so that's
what<00:00:12.660> this<00:00:12.840> video<00:00:13.290> today<00:00:13.860> will<00:00:14.070> be<00:00:14.190> about<00:00:14.490> so

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:14.990 
what this video today will be about so

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.810 
what this video today will be about so
we<00:00:15.990> started<00:00:16.350> off<00:00:16.470> with<00:00:16.710> the<00:00:17.010> original

comparison<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.070> creatine<00:00:56.579> monohydrate<00:00:57.109> but

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
comparison to creatine monohydrate but

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.590 
comparison to creatine monohydrate but
is<00:00:58.260> creatine<00:00:58.680> HCl<00:00:59.160> superior<00:00:59.820> to<00:01:00.030> creatine

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
is creatine HCl superior to creatine

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.349 
is creatine HCl superior to creatine
monohydrate<00:01:00.899> well<00:01:01.440> let's<00:01:02.010> examine<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.820> main

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
monohydrate well let's examine the main

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.870 
monohydrate well let's examine the main
claims<00:01:03.780> that<00:01:04.049> are<00:01:04.260> made<00:01:04.290> about<00:01:04.830> creatine<00:01:05.159> HCl

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
claims that are made about creatine HCl

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.000 
claims that are made about creatine HCl
in<00:01:06.390> comparison<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.200> creatine<00:01:07.770> monohydrate

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
in comparison to creatine monohydrate

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.850 
in comparison to creatine monohydrate
and<00:01:08.790> then<00:01:09.750> you<00:01:09.900> can<00:01:10.080> basically<00:01:10.200> just<00:01:10.530> make<00:01:10.740> the

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
and then you can basically just make the

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.760 
and then you can basically just make the
decision<00:01:10.979> for<00:01:11.549> yourself<00:01:11.700> so<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:13.200> first<00:01:13.590> major

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
decision for yourself so the first major

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.010 
decision for yourself so the first major
claim<00:01:14.250> is<00:01:14.520> that<00:01:14.549> there<00:01:15.000> is<00:01:15.119> no<00:01:15.330> loading<00:01:15.689> phase

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
claim is that there is no loading phase

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.160 
claim is that there is no loading phase
required<00:01:16.590> with<00:01:16.939> creatine<00:01:17.939> HCl<00:01:18.479> now<00:01:18.659> this<00:01:18.869> is<00:01:19.049> a

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
required with creatine HCl now this is a

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.620 
required with creatine HCl now this is a
totally<00:01:19.680> irrelevant<00:01:20.009> point<00:01:20.520> because<00:01:21.390> there

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
totally irrelevant point because there

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.570 
totally irrelevant point because there
is<00:01:21.840> no<00:01:22.110> need<00:01:22.320> for<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.619> perform<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:23.159> loading

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
is no need for you to perform a loading

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.539 
is no need for you to perform a loading
phase<00:01:23.850> with<00:01:24.479> any<00:01:24.720> form<00:01:24.990> of<00:01:25.110> creatine<00:01:25.549> whether

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
phase with any form of creatine whether

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.730 
phase with any form of creatine whether
it's<00:01:26.820> creatine<00:01:27.299> monohydrate<00:01:27.600> or<00:01:28.200> creatine

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
it's creatine monohydrate or creatine

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.819 
it's creatine monohydrate or creatine
hydrochloride<00:01:29.040> a<00:01:29.900> loading<00:01:30.900> phase<00:01:30.930> can<00:01:31.560> help

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
hydrochloride a loading phase can help

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.859 
hydrochloride a loading phase can help
you<00:01:31.979> see<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.729> results<00:01:33.210> in<00:01:33.299> a<00:01:33.390> shorter<00:01:33.750> amount

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
you see the results in a shorter amount

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.260 
you see the results in a shorter amount
of<00:01:34.049> time<00:01:34.110> five<00:01:34.829> days<00:01:35.100> as<00:01:35.250> opposed<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.610> about<00:01:35.850> 20

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
of time five days as opposed to about 20

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.109 
of time five days as opposed to about 20
but<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.020> standard<00:01:37.710> 3/5<00:01:38.159> gram<00:01:38.460> per<00:01:38.670> day<00:01:38.850> dosage

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
but a standard 3/5 gram per day dosage

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.170 
but a standard 3/5 gram per day dosage
of<00:01:39.509> creatine<00:01:40.140> will<00:01:40.439> result<00:01:40.799> in<00:01:40.979> full<00:01:41.759> creatine

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
of creatine will result in full creatine

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.609 
of creatine will result in full creatine
saturation<00:01:42.360> of<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:42.960> muscles<00:01:43.290> within<00:01:43.530> about

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
saturation of the muscles within about

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.740 
saturation of the muscles within about
two<00:01:43.890> to<00:01:44.009> three<00:01:44.040> weeks<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:45.090> second<00:01:45.390> claim<00:01:45.600> is

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
two to three weeks the second claim is

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.120 
two to three weeks the second claim is
that<00:01:45.780> there's<00:01:46.020> no<00:01:46.170> bloating<00:01:46.590> with<00:01:46.829> creatine

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
that there's no bloating with creatine

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.069 
that there's no bloating with creatine
HCl<00:01:47.700> now<00:01:47.820> I've<00:01:47.909> talked<00:01:48.180> about<00:01:48.299> this<00:01:48.570> a<00:01:48.840> hundred

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
HCl now I've talked about this a hundred

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.440 
HCl now I've talked about this a hundred
times<00:01:49.649> in<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.890> past<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.549> I<00:01:51.210> don't<00:01:51.270> even

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
times in the past and I don't even

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.210 
times in the past and I don't even
really<00:01:51.689> know<00:01:51.899> where<00:01:52.170> this<00:01:52.409> idea<00:01:52.829> came<00:01:53.159> from

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
really know where this idea came from

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.940 
really know where this idea came from
but<00:01:53.790> creatine<00:01:54.540> monohydrate<00:01:54.780> does<00:01:55.320> not<00:01:55.560> cause

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
but creatine monohydrate does not cause

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.910 
but creatine monohydrate does not cause
bloating<00:01:56.610> of<00:01:56.850> any<00:01:57.119> kind<00:01:57.530> creatine<00:01:58.530> does

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
bloating of any kind creatine does

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.240 
bloating of any kind creatine does
require<00:01:59.790> additional<00:02:00.270> water<00:02:00.840> in<00:02:01.200> order<00:02:01.860> to<00:02:02.100> be

actually one of the primary benefits of

so<00:02:18.610> sure<00:02:19.180> creatine<00:02:19.629> hydrochloride<00:02:20.129> doesn't

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:21.129 
so sure creatine hydrochloride doesn't

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:22.830 
so sure creatine hydrochloride doesn't
cause<00:02:21.250> bloating<00:02:21.580> but<00:02:21.909> neither<00:02:22.150> does<00:02:22.390> creatine

creatine HCl now I just mentioned this a

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.539 
creatine HCl now I just mentioned this a
couple<00:03:26.410> points<00:03:26.650> ago<00:03:26.889> but<00:03:27.130> increased

so<00:03:57.459> when<00:03:57.940> it<00:03:58.030> really<00:03:58.239> all<00:03:58.419> comes<00:03:58.690> down<00:03:58.840> to<00:03:59.079> it

00:03:59.369 --> 00:03:59.379 
so when it really all comes down to it

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:02.009 
so when it really all comes down to it
there's<00:03:59.590> just<00:03:59.650> no<00:03:59.950> good<00:04:00.459> reason<00:04:00.849> to<00:04:01.419> deviate

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
there's just no good reason to deviate

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:05.309 
there's just no good reason to deviate
from<00:04:02.349> the<00:04:02.859> monohydrate<00:04:03.549> form<00:04:04.150> when<00:04:04.900> it<00:04:05.019> comes

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:05.319 
from the monohydrate form when it comes

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:08.610

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
that there is necessarily anything bad

about<00:04:28.880> creatine<00:04:29.330> hydrochloride<00:04:29.780> itself<00:04:30.710> but

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
about creatine hydrochloride itself but

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.640 
about creatine hydrochloride itself but
why<00:04:31.850> pay<00:04:32.060> eight<00:04:32.270> eight<00:04:32.930> to<00:04:33.110> ten<00:04:33.260> times<00:04:33.470> the

why pay eight eight to ten times the

benefits that creatine has to offer by

simply<00:04:38.210> using<00:04:38.240> the<00:04:38.570> monohydrate<00:04:39.080> form<00:04:39.680> one<00:04:40.640> of

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:40.670 
simply using the monohydrate form one of

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:44.110 
simply using the monohydrate form one of
the<00:04:40.960> primary<00:04:41.960> reasons<00:04:42.440> why<00:04:42.770> creatine<00:04:43.340> HCl<00:04:43.940> is

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 
the primary reasons why creatine HCl is

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.540 
the primary reasons why creatine HCl is
claimed<00:04:44.510> to<00:04:44.540> be<00:04:44.720> superior<00:04:45.020> to<00:04:45.530> monohydrate<00:04:46.130> is

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
claimed to be superior to monohydrate is

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.300 
claimed to be superior to monohydrate is
because<00:04:47.330> it's<00:04:47.510> more<00:04:47.690> water<00:04:48.050> soluble<00:04:48.620> and<00:04:48.860> so

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
because it's more water soluble and so

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.580 
because it's more water soluble and so
it<00:04:49.490> requires<00:04:49.880> a<00:04:50.000> smaller<00:04:50.450> dosage<00:04:51.050> but<00:04:51.290> on<00:04:51.530> a

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
it requires a smaller dosage but on a

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.190 
it requires a smaller dosage but on a
per<00:04:52.130> serving<00:04:52.550> basis<00:04:53.000> despite<00:04:53.510> that<00:04:53.750> it<00:04:53.930> still

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:54.200 
per serving basis despite that it still

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.990 
per serving basis despite that it still
ends<00:04:54.500> up<00:04:54.560> being<00:04:54.830> a<00:04:55.070> significantly<00:04:55.730> higher

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
ends up being a significantly higher

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.930 
ends up being a significantly higher
price<00:04:56.480> and<00:04:56.780> on<00:04:57.320> top<00:04:57.560> of<00:04:57.710> this<00:04:57.800> creatine<00:04:58.250> HCl<00:04:58.760> is

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940 
price and on top of this creatine HCl is

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.840 
price and on top of this creatine HCl is
still<00:04:59.210> a<00:04:59.450> relatively<00:05:00.080> new<00:05:00.230> supplement<00:05:00.860> and<00:05:01.730> at

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:01.850 
still a relatively new supplement and at

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:03.420 
still a relatively new supplement and at
this<00:05:02.000> point<00:05:02.300> there<00:05:02.480> really<00:05:02.510> isn't<00:05:02.930> any

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
this point there really isn't any

this point there really isn't any

the day creatine monohydrate is the most

the day creatine monohydrate is the most

also the most cost effective form as

also the most cost effective form as

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:42.200

which<00:05:43.010> shows<00:05:43.370> a<00:05:44.170> different<00:05:45.170> form<00:05:45.350> of<00:05:45.410> creatine

performance<00:05:50.900> I<00:05:50.990> think<00:05:51.020> the<00:05:51.260> choice<00:05:51.500> is<00:05:51.770> pretty

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:52.070 
performance I think the choice is pretty

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:55.450 
performance I think the choice is pretty
much<00:05:52.310> a<00:05:52.370> no-brainer<00:05:52.670> this<00:05:53.300> at<00:05:53.930> this<00:05:54.290> time<00:05:54.590> so<00:05:55.430> I

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:55.460 
much a no-brainer this at this time so I
