00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
this case here we're going to view

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.470 
this case here we're going to view
directly<00:00:13.679> to<00:00:14.009> our<00:00:14.040> Internet<00:00:14.580> and<00:00:14.910> Explorer

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
directly to our Internet and Explorer

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.090 
directly to our Internet and Explorer
browser<00:00:15.719> and<00:00:16.139> it's<00:00:16.289> important<00:00:16.710> that<00:00:16.740> you<00:00:16.949> use

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
browser and it's important that you use

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.240 
browser and it's important that you use
the<00:00:17.130> Internet<00:00:17.520> Explorer<00:00:17.820> and<00:00:18.830> forest<00:00:19.920> now<00:00:20.189> you

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
the Internet Explorer and forest now you

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.279 
the Internet Explorer and forest now you
could<00:00:20.550> load<00:00:21.240> it<00:00:21.270> on<00:00:21.539> as<00:00:21.810> a<00:00:21.840> standalone

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
could load it on as a standalone

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.439 
could load it on as a standalone
application<00:00:23.189> but<00:00:23.580> it's<00:00:23.699> just<00:00:23.789> happier<00:00:24.210> to<00:00:24.330> do

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
application but it's just happier to do

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.529 
application but it's just happier to do
it<00:00:24.539> this<00:00:24.660> way<00:00:24.930> so<00:00:25.320> to<00:00:25.380> access<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:26.369> actual<00:00:27.029> and

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
it this way so to access the actual and

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.210 
it this way so to access the actual and
software<00:00:28.109> what<00:00:28.410> we're<00:00:28.590> going<00:00:28.710> to<00:00:28.769> do<00:00:28.890> is<00:00:29.070> just

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
software what we're going to do is just

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.460 
software what we're going to do is just
type<00:00:29.400> in<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.760> IP<00:00:29.910> address<00:00:30.119> of<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.630> DVR<00:00:30.990> itself

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
type in the IP address of the DVR itself

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.110 
type in the IP address of the DVR itself
so<00:00:31.920> it's<00:00:32.130> HTTP<00:00:33.230> colon<00:00:34.230> forward<00:00:34.940> slash<00:00:35.940> forward

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
so it's HTTP colon forward slash forward

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.020 
so it's HTTP colon forward slash forward
slash<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:36.899> then<00:00:36.960> 192<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:38.160> you<00:00:38.520> can<00:00:38.700> see<00:00:38.850> we've

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
slash and then 192 and you can see we've

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.610 
slash and then 192 and you can see we've
entered<00:00:39.329> here<00:00:39.510> already<00:00:39.840> now<00:00:40.230> interestingly

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
entered here already now interestingly

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.830 
entered here already now interestingly
we<00:00:41.430> have<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:41.700> enter<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.149> portion<00:00:42.540> over<00:00:42.600> here

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
we have to enter the portion over here

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.990 
we have to enter the portion over here
at<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.050> answer<00:00:43.320> which<00:00:43.440> is<00:00:43.559> port<00:00:43.800> 82<00:00:44.399> if<00:00:44.910> we

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
at the answer which is port 82 if we

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.520 
at the answer which is port 82 if we
went<00:00:45.149> with<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.450> default<00:00:45.899> port<00:00:46.140> which<00:00:46.410> would

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
went with the default port which would

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.200 
went with the default port which would
be<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.770> V<00:00:46.829> and<00:00:47.309> in<00:00:47.520> our<00:00:47.670> case<00:00:47.879> it<00:00:48.059> wasn't

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
be a V and in our case it wasn't

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.450 
be a V and in our case it wasn't
available<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:48.809> say<00:00:49.170> because<00:00:49.980> we<00:00:50.100> already<00:00:50.370> been

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
available to say because we already been

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.090 
available to say because we already been
using<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.910> router<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:51.480> we<00:00:52.140> just<00:00:52.770> entered

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
using the router and we just entered

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.799 
using the router and we just entered
straightforward<00:00:53.730> IP<00:00:53.879> address<00:00:54.300> but<00:00:54.510> because

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
straightforward IP address but because

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.569 
straightforward IP address but because
it<00:00:54.930> is<00:00:55.050> we<00:00:55.230> need<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.500> enter<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.989> colon<00:00:58.370> m82<00:00:59.370> in

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
it is we need to enter and colon m82 in

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.160 
it is we need to enter and colon m82 in
this<00:00:59.699> case<00:00:59.940> so<00:01:00.480> we're<00:01:00.600> going<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:00.780> do<00:01:00.870> here<00:01:01.079> is

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
this case so we're going to do here is

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.310 
this case so we're going to do here is
just<00:01:01.320> click<00:01:01.500> on<00:01:01.649> this<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:02.780> won't<00:01:03.780> be<00:01:03.930> printed

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
just click on this and won't be printed

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.170 
just click on this and won't be printed
here<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:04.710> you<00:01:04.799> can<00:01:04.949> see<00:01:05.100> it's<00:01:05.339> saying<00:01:05.549> DVR

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
stand for a password here so we set up

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.120
