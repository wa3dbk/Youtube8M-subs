00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:14.510
 and there we are again pro evolution 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:17.240
 soccer 2013 will be the legend 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:21.759
 against the sc heerenveen course directly 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.759
 at bristol marys 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:36.260
 that's the way it is and again we have to 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:38.859
 Wait because we are not in again 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.870
 the starting lineup has been called 

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:43.789
 only I hope that we go up very slowly 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.829
 The chance will prove to us that 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:48.219
 We also play from the beginning 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:48.219
 can 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:01:03.140
 schÃ¶nau free kick 48 yes what is there to 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.859
 say anything new we sit just yes 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.150
 only on the bank 

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:07.400
 Last time as I get here 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.430
 We have to watch that we do that 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.890
 Trust the team to tear us down 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.939
 I'd say so that we can from the trainer 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.180
 to get the chance 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:18.560
 to play from the beginning but like me 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.079
 already said that is in the first 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.820
 but always play when we enter 

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:25.009
 few games have played well 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.860
 have made one or the other goal 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:29.149
 much have made on off and so then 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.189
 we also have that pretty fast 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:34.670
 trust and then almost become 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:37.390
 always from the beginning but play there 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.390
 we have to get there first 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:42.979
 I hope they make a goal 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:43.460
 because most of the time it's only 00 or so 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:45.619
 is 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.030
 or were you left behind 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:48.219
 not as a youngster 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.939
 substitute 

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:52.609
 That's why I hope they get one 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:53.990
 Giving a little gas here and maybe 

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:56.920
 make a goal so that we are the same 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.920
 chance to come in 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.340
 now in a fast run it would have 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:07.330
 in my opinion be an eleven meters 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:09.550
 but can now be duplicated 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.230
 speed do you enable us to 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:17.710
 almost the enemy has fallen 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:21.010
 half-time 000 does not pay yes to see 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:23.500
 second half every time thought 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.360
 we did not change that at half-time 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:31.060
 means we hope maybe later 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:34.450
 still need to be changed but need 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.390
 Let's wait and see that we maybe 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:43.660
 make a goal or 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:48.180
 the teammates now 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.180
 maybe or maybe not 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:56.200
 not really much to talk about though 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.390
 you do not play great now, too 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:02.290
 still in arrears 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:06.420
 that is of course especially bitter hh 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.420
 and now in the movie plays perfect 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.620
 the trust is not that big yet 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.790
 I have stood tall as seen ex rad 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.510
 completely free and get the ball 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.510
 leaked 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.760
 yes great then we play the ball to you 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:37.100
 can say to make disabled 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:39.450
 I can try stuntshows with me 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.660
 he also went down quite a bit 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.790
 is that goes pretty far over it 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:48.800
 pretty repetitive starts again 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:52.130
 to boa which meets even the network 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:54.950
 would have gone down meters earlier 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:04:03.240
 if we get one for this feature one 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:05.580
 or almost who decided now that 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:10.770
 ball should go to me 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:14.440
 aha I think okay what I extra off 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:16.690
 so I play here as a good pass 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.780
 scored and then he is verkackt 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.780
 so 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:37.100
 there was a shit in a man would be 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.590
 beautiful on the gate still like that 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.990
 long shot just say 'that's me 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:45.130
 is gone at all because 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:47.450
 he was pretty close you have to say yes 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.860
 what kind of a beginner player 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:05:00.260
 Almost nothing has ever happened before 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:05:01.640
 but the corners are very good here at pro 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.410
 I do not really like evolution soccer 

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:05.800
 So I 'm not supposed to talk about it either 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.800
 to look forward to 

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:15.759
 super volley shot they would have all 

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:16.860
 can stand still rather than high 

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:20.680
 jump 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:23.349
 the repetition of the corner one now 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:26.680
 the wonderful chance is barely ten 

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:29.099
 meter passes the gate 90 minutes of play 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:33.419
 are in the nachspiel time 

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:33.419
 So it will say the game is lost 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:39.250
 are already on the nachspiel time 

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:40.449
 He talks about it right away he whistles because 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:43.120
 I would like the next action 

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:46.590
 Let's say the ball is off 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.590
 not so maybe last chance 

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:54.099
 I would say at the next high ball 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:57.849
 there flank and whistled 

00:05:54.099 --> 00:06:00.580
 but with it 1 0 against the sc rwe lost 

00:05:57.849 --> 00:06:02.699
 Let's have a look at the player ratings 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:06.969
 that we got 

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:09.069
 a 75 as well as the player of the 

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:11.590
 what I do not understand he has that 

00:06:09.069 --> 00:06:13.389
 We did not have a goal for that 

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:14.830
 But we have a great chance so I 

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:16.719
 Hope you liked it if so 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:19.150
 Of course thumbs up if not then 

00:06:16.719 --> 00:06:21.719
 thumbs down and see you on 

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:21.719
 next day again
