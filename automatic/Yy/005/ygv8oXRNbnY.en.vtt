00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
realistic than one but then again you

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.150 
realistic than one but then again you

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
okay so yeah so that's the mod guys in a

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.820 
okay so yeah so that's the mod guys in a

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
nutshell it increases the all of the

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.910 
nutshell it increases the all of the
pedestrians<00:03:15.340> with<00:03:15.580> extra<00:03:16.060> health<00:03:16.470> and<00:03:17.470> I
