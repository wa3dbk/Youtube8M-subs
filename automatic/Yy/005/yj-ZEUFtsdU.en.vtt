you know an idea of how long it's been

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.540 
you know an idea of how long it's been
you're<00:00:40.230> not<00:00:40.350> sure<00:00:40.649> if<00:00:40.680> it's<00:00:41.040> been<00:00:41.280> long<00:00:41.520> enough

since you've drank this application
helps<00:00:43.770> you<00:00:44.040> determine<00:00:44.250> whether<00:00:44.820> or<00:00:44.940> not<00:00:45.239> you

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
helps you determine whether or not you

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.790

are<00:00:45.930> good<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.320> go<00:00:46.440> now<00:00:46.829> this<00:00:47.550> is<00:00:47.730> estimates

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
are good to go now this is estimates

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.930 
are good to go now this is estimates
obviously<00:00:49.800> everybody's<00:00:50.219> body<00:00:50.430> type<00:00:50.789> is

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
obviously everybody's body type is

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.000 
obviously everybody's body type is
different<00:00:51.390> in<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.539> way<00:00:51.570> you<00:00:51.890> you<00:00:52.890> know

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
different in the way you you know

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.060 
different in the way you you know
process<00:00:53.579> stuff<00:00:53.879> so<00:00:54.270> it's<00:00:54.960> an<00:00:55.140> estimate<00:00:55.620> so<00:00:55.980> you

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
process stuff so it's an estimate so you

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.470 
process stuff so it's an estimate so you
you<00:00:56.489> probably<00:00:56.820> will<00:00:57.210> want<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:59.210> be<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.239> little

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
you probably will want to be a little

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.150 
you probably will want to be a little
generous<00:01:00.780> with<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.260> time<00:01:01.469> frame<00:01:01.500> that<00:01:01.890> it

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
generous with the time frame that it

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.369 
generous with the time frame that it
gives<00:01:02.370> just<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.850> make<00:01:03.000> sure<00:01:03.140> because<00:01:04.140> you

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
gives just to make sure because you

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.550 
gives just to make sure because you
never<00:01:04.530> know<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:05.400> cop<00:01:06.119> could<00:01:06.390> get<00:01:06.630> you<00:01:06.810> for<00:01:07.140> you

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
never know a cop could get you for you

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
know anything so very cool the way it

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.000 
know anything so very cool the way it
works<00:01:10.560> so<00:01:10.799> let's<00:01:10.830> go<00:01:11.189> in<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:11.790> do<00:01:11.939> a<00:01:11.970> forecast

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.010 
works so let's go in and do a forecast

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:19.670 
works so let's go in and do a forecast

alcohol<00:03:48.720> level<00:03:49.050> down<00:03:49.430> it'll<00:03:50.430> definitely<00:03:50.640> let

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
alcohol level down it'll definitely let

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.200 
alcohol level down it'll definitely let
me<00:03:51.720> know<00:03:51.900> what<00:03:52.590> to<00:03:52.800> expect<00:03:52.830> I<00:03:53.490> can<00:03:53.730> also<00:03:53.880> look

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:54.210 
me know what to expect I can also look

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:56.330 
me know what to expect I can also look
at<00:03:54.360> a<00:03:54.390> graph<00:03:54.690> and<00:03:54.990> then<00:03:55.680> I<00:03:55.740> can<00:03:55.920> look<00:03:56.100> at<00:03:56.190> that

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
at a graph and then I can look at that

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.090 
at a graph and then I can look at that
information<00:03:57.000> as<00:03:57.240> well<00:03:57.630> right<00:03:58.320> there<00:03:58.590> so<00:03:58.890> the

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
information as well right there so the

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.740 
information as well right there so the
timer<00:03:59.370> is<00:03:59.550> really<00:03:59.850> nice<00:04:00.030> because<00:04:00.330> it<00:04:00.540> kind<00:04:00.720> of

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
timer is really nice because it kind of

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.080 
timer is really nice because it kind of
gives<00:04:00.900> me<00:04:01.020> an<00:04:01.200> idea<00:04:01.320> of<00:04:01.740> how<00:04:02.610> much<00:04:02.760> time<00:04:03.060> I

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
gives me an idea of how much time I

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.640 
gives me an idea of how much time I
should<00:04:03.450> probably<00:04:03.600> wait<00:04:04.020> before<00:04:04.230> I<00:04:04.410> should

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
should probably wait before I should

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.130 
should probably wait before I should
drive<00:04:04.950> this<00:04:05.580> is<00:04:05.760> great<00:04:06.150> information<00:04:06.510> to<00:04:06.930> have

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
drive this is great information to have

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.290 
drive this is great information to have
if<00:04:07.200> you<00:04:07.560> don't<00:04:07.740> have<00:04:07.980> some<00:04:08.640> sort<00:04:08.850> of<00:04:08.970> a<00:04:09.060> little

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:09.300 
if you don't have some sort of a little

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:10.820 
if you don't have some sort of a little
device<00:04:09.600> that<00:04:09.630> you<00:04:09.930> can<00:04:10.110> breathe<00:04:10.290> into<00:04:10.530> that

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
device that you can breathe into that

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:12.710 
device that you can breathe into that
gives<00:04:10.980> you<00:04:11.100> completely<00:04:11.670> accurate<00:04:11.940> readings

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
gives you completely accurate readings

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.820 
gives you completely accurate readings
this<00:04:13.350> will<00:04:13.560> give<00:04:13.590> you<00:04:13.830> an<00:04:13.980> idea<00:04:14.130> so<00:04:15.530> I'd<00:04:16.530> say

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:16.830 
this will give you an idea so I'd say

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:18.500 
this will give you an idea so I'd say
you<00:04:16.890> know<00:04:17.160> if<00:04:17.280> this<00:04:17.459> was<00:04:17.640> my<00:04:17.760> situation<00:04:18.390> I

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
you know if this was my situation I

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.870 
you know if this was my situation I
probably<00:04:18.810> want<00:04:19.230> to<00:04:19.350> get<00:04:19.470> a<00:04:19.530> ride<00:04:19.799> home<00:04:19.830> or<00:04:20.340> at

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
probably want to get a ride home or at

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.200 
probably want to get a ride home or at
least<00:04:21.800> if<00:04:22.800> I<00:04:22.950> couldn't<00:04:23.250> hang<00:04:23.490> out<00:04:23.669> for<00:04:23.970> a<00:04:24.000> long

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
least if I couldn't hang out for a long

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.510 
least if I couldn't hang out for a long
time<00:04:24.510> you<00:04:25.229> know<00:04:25.350> take<00:04:25.710> a<00:04:25.740> cab<00:04:26.040> or<00:04:26.070> something

time you know take a cab or something

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.590 
time you know take a cab or something
like<00:04:26.820> that<00:04:26.880> because

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
like that because

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.810 
like that because
I<00:04:27.810> probably<00:04:28.560> drank<00:04:28.830> a<00:04:28.950> little<00:04:29.130> too<00:04:29.220> much<00:04:29.550> and<00:04:29.760> I

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
I probably drank a little too much and I

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.510 
I probably drank a little too much and I
don't<00:04:30.150> want<00:04:30.480> to<00:04:30.660> risk<00:04:30.870> driving<00:04:31.230> home<00:04:31.710> even<00:04:32.430> if

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
don't want to risk driving home even if

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.280 
don't want to risk driving home even if
I<00:04:32.640> feel<00:04:32.910> fine<00:04:33.210> that<00:04:33.540> doesn't<00:04:33.840> necessarily

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:34.290 
I feel fine that doesn't necessarily

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.560
