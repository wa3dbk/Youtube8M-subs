is also where the middle of the flam
drag<00:01:04.799> is<00:01:05.040> okay<00:01:05.519> so<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.119> play<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.450> second

flam on the downbeat followed by an
accent<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:12.810> diddle<00:01:13.200> on<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.830> second<00:01:14.250> partial

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
accent to diddle on the second partial

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.700 
accent to diddle on the second partial
and<00:01:14.880> then<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.270> tap<00:01:15.659> on<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.020> third<00:01:16.380> partial

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
and then a tap on the third partial

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.590 
and then a tap on the third partial
right<00:01:17.189> so<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.520> second<00:01:17.850> grouping<00:01:18.090> sounds<00:01:18.509> like

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
right so the second grouping sounds like

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:25.820 
right so the second grouping sounds like
this<00:01:23.299> okay<00:01:24.299> and<00:01:24.600> finally<00:01:25.530> in<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.799> third

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
this okay and finally in the third

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.950

grouping we're gonna shift the accent
back<00:01:28.080> one<00:01:28.439> more<00:01:28.710> triplet<00:01:29.159> partial<00:01:29.490> so<00:01:29.850> now<00:01:30.090> the

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
back one more triplet partial so now the

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.120 
back one more triplet partial so now the
ass<00:01:30.420> is<00:01:30.720> on<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:31.020> third<00:01:31.380> partial<00:01:31.799> of<00:01:32.009> the

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:17.120 
triplet grid by itself and really really
understanding<00:04:15.840> that<00:04:15.930> before<00:04:16.410> you<00:04:16.709> learn<00:04:16.950> this

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
understanding that before you learn this

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.819 
understanding that before you learn this
is<00:04:17.370> a<00:04:17.669> huge<00:04:18.389> help<00:04:18.780> and<00:04:19.049> a<00:04:19.139> huge<00:04:19.470> advantage
