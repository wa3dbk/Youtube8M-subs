bass<00:00:40.110> reflex<00:00:40.379> port<00:00:41.280> there<00:00:41.489> is<00:00:41.579> tuned<00:00:41.790> for

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
bass reflex port there is tuned for

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.479 
bass reflex port there is tuned for
about<00:00:42.149> sixty<00:00:42.829> so<00:00:43.829> what<00:00:43.950> we're<00:00:44.040> going<00:00:44.129> to<00:00:44.190> do<00:00:44.340> is

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
about sixty so what we're going to do is

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:45.799 
about sixty so what we're going to do is
have<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:44.940> look<00:00:45.090> at<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.270> settings<00:00:45.600> that<00:00:45.660> I've

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
have a look at the settings that I've

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.270 
have a look at the settings that I've
got<00:00:45.960> on<00:00:46.110> here<00:00:46.350> which<00:00:46.469> I'll<00:00:46.649> set<00:00:46.920> everything<00:00:47.250> to

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
got on here which I'll set everything to

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.029 
got on here which I'll set everything to
zero<00:00:47.610> in<00:00:47.910> terms<00:00:48.149> of<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:49.170> equalizer<00:00:49.559> they<00:00:49.800> go

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
zero in terms of the equalizer they go

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.139 
zero in terms of the equalizer they go
equalize<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.460> low<00:00:50.730> medium<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.420> high<00:00:51.800> and<00:00:53.149> we

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
equalize a low medium and high and we

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.410 
equalize a low medium and high and we
got<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.360> Louds<00:00:54.570> off<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:56.030> few<00:00:57.030> other<00:00:57.180> settings

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
got the Louds off a few other settings

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.389 
got the Louds off a few other settings
in<00:00:57.750> there<00:00:57.960> that<00:00:58.140> really<00:00:58.170> don't<00:00:58.800> mean<00:00:59.039> much<00:00:59.219> to

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
in there that really don't mean much to

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.360 
in there that really don't mean much to
us<00:00:59.430> when<00:01:00.420> I<00:01:00.449> will<00:01:00.660> get<00:01:00.780> our<00:01:00.870> volume<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:02.129> max

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
us when I will get our volume the max

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.670 
us when I will get our volume the max
volume<00:01:02.609> we'll<00:01:02.910> get<00:01:03.030> out<00:01:03.180> of<00:01:03.210> this<00:01:03.329> is<00:01:03.539> about<00:01:03.780> 62

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
volume we'll get out of this is about 62

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.240 
volume we'll get out of this is about 62
or<00:01:04.710> belief<00:01:06.229> and<00:01:07.229> war<00:01:07.470> so<00:01:07.770> we'll<00:01:07.920> set<00:01:08.070> it<00:01:08.159> to

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
or belief and war so we'll set it to

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.310 
or belief and war so we'll set it to
about<00:01:08.430> 50<00:01:09.650> which<00:01:10.650> is<00:01:10.680> about<00:01:11.450> 85%<00:01:12.450> of<00:01:13.200> the

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
about 50 which is about 85% of the

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.749 
about 50 which is about 85% of the
available<00:01:14.010> power<00:01:14.330> and<00:01:16.189> we'll<00:01:17.189> set<00:01:17.430> this<00:01:17.549> back

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
available power and we'll set this back

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.520 
available power and we'll set this back
up<00:01:17.909> over<00:01:18.210> here<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.689> then<00:01:18.810> I'll<00:01:18.930> put<00:01:19.350> those

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
up over here and then I'll put those

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:26.770 
up over here and then I'll put those
candles<00:01:20.159> in<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.549> holes<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:23.390> play<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.420> song<00:01:25.159> so

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
candles in the holes and play a song so

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.460 
candles in the holes and play a song so
this<00:01:27.780> is<00:01:29.180> running<00:01:30.180> off<00:01:30.299> a<00:01:30.329> 15<00:01:30.810> volt<00:01:31.020> plug<00:01:31.290> back

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
this is running off a 15 volt plug back

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.690 
this is running off a 15 volt plug back
off<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.829> mains<00:01:32.900> that<00:01:33.900> produces<00:01:34.530> a<00:01:34.829> dance<00:01:35.490> of
