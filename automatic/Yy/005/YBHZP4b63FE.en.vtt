00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.300 

on<00:03:52.320> the<00:03:52.440> next<00:03:52.710> page<00:03:52.950> here<00:03:53.490> we'll<00:03:53.730> see<00:03:55.310> well

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
on the next page here we'll see well

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.340 
on the next page here we'll see well
does<00:03:56.490> see<00:03:56.700> the<00:03:56.820> first<00:03:57.060> items<00:03:57.780> was<00:03:58.050> only<00:03:58.320> a

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
does see the first items was only a

second item was two hundred catcher

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.790 
second item was two hundred catcher
coins<00:04:03.690> so<00:04:03.990> they<00:04:04.110> do<00:04:04.350> tend<00:04:04.650> to<00:04:06.410> increase<00:04:07.410> pretty

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:07.800 
coins so they do tend to increase pretty

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:15.890 
coins so they do tend to increase pretty
quickly<00:04:08.900> so<00:04:09.900> there's<00:04:10.080> a<00:04:10.140> sound<00:04:10.470> board<00:04:14.900> overall

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
quickly so there's a sound board overall

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.009 
quickly so there's a sound board overall
I'm<00:04:16.140> not<00:04:16.320> real<00:04:16.560> sure<00:04:17.180> what<00:04:18.180> age<00:04:18.390> group<00:04:18.810> would

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
I'm not real sure what age group would

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:23.780 
I'm not real sure what age group would
be<00:04:19.079> best<00:04:19.440> for<00:04:19.709> this<00:04:19.859> particular<00:04:20.220> game<00:04:22.010> the<00:04:23.010> art

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
be best for this particular game the art

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:27.350 
be best for this particular game the art
style<00:04:24.240> and<00:04:25.010> the<00:04:26.010> sound<00:04:26.340> and<00:04:26.700> everything<00:04:26.760> it

style and the sound and everything it

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.870 
style and the sound and everything it
sounds<00:04:27.690> just<00:04:27.840> like<00:04:28.440> a<00:04:28.500> spectra<00:04:29.190> gadget<00:04:29.640> which

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
sounds just like a spectra gadget which

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.130 
sounds just like a spectra gadget which
is<00:04:30.030> really<00:04:30.300> appealing<00:04:32.690> unfortunately<00:04:33.690> for<00:04:33.960> me

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:34.140 
is really appealing unfortunately for me

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.280 
is really appealing unfortunately for me
I'm<00:04:34.650> not<00:04:34.710> a<00:04:35.130> big<00:04:35.550> fan<00:04:35.940> necessarily<00:04:36.720> of<00:04:36.870> the<00:04:36.900> run

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.290 
I'm not a big fan necessarily of the run

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.070 
I'm not a big fan necessarily of the run
and<00:04:37.560> jump<00:04:38.250> of<00:04:38.460> this<00:04:38.640> particular<00:04:39.030> style<00:04:39.540> kind

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
and jump of this particular style kind

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.640 
and jump of this particular style kind
of<00:04:40.110> it

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.070 

with<00:04:43.650> only<00:04:43.770> three<00:04:44.100> lives<00:04:44.370> I<00:04:44.730> think<00:04:44.930> you<00:04:45.930> can

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
with only three lives I think you can

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.450 
with only three lives I think you can
get<00:04:46.200> to<00:04:46.320> the<00:04:46.410> point<00:04:46.710> where<00:04:46.860> you<00:04:46.950> can<00:04:47.070> get<00:04:47.160> bored

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
with it pretty quickly I think

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.250 
with it pretty quickly I think
but<00:04:51.180> you<00:04:51.450> know<00:04:51.540> if<00:04:51.660> you<00:04:51.780> like<00:04:51.930> Inspector
