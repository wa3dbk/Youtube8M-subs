00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
about all the matters that came to hand

disagreements about some of these

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.400

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410

election is likely to be decided I do

00:00:37.589 --> 00:00:39.560 
election is likely to be decided I do
think<00:00:38.070> that<00:00:38.129> he<00:00:38.309> did<00:00:38.519> effectively<00:00:38.970> use<00:00:39.330> the

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
think that he did effectively use the

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.750 
think that he did effectively use the
economy<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.890> weakness<00:00:41.190> of<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.430> economy

economy and the weakness of the economy

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.210 
economy and the weakness of the economy
as<00:00:42.150> a<00:00:42.180> weapon<00:00:42.720> in<00:00:43.049> a<00:00:43.140> debate<00:00:43.290> about<00:00:43.589> about

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:44.220 
as a weapon in a debate about about

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.729 
as a weapon in a debate about about
about<00:00:44.820> foreign<00:00:45.299> policy<00:00:45.330> and<00:00:45.839> and<00:00:46.470> our

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
about foreign policy and and our

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.020 
about foreign policy and and our
position<00:00:47.129> in<00:00:47.220> the<00:00:47.309> world<00:00:47.339> I<00:00:47.699> would<00:00:47.820> say<00:00:47.940> this

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
position in the world I would say this

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.100 
position in the world I would say this
about<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.390> president<00:00:48.809> I<00:00:48.839> thought<00:00:49.019> the

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
about the president I thought the

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.820 
about the president I thought the
president<00:00:49.440> was<00:00:50.330> looking<00:00:51.330> as<00:00:51.540> he<00:00:52.320> well<00:00:52.559> might

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
Governor Romney it seemed to me has this

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.950 
Governor Romney it seemed to me has this
kind<00:01:16.980> of<00:01:17.130> benign<00:01:17.310> default<00:01:18.180> expression<00:01:18.840> in

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
kind of benign default expression in

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.750 
kind of benign default expression in
which<00:01:19.020> he<00:01:19.560> appears<00:01:19.860> to<00:01:19.920> be<00:01:20.040> interested<00:01:20.550> most

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:20.760 
which he appears to be interested most

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.910 
which he appears to be interested most
of<00:01:20.910> the<00:01:21.000> time<00:01:21.240> he<00:01:21.750> has<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:21.960> slight<00:01:22.290> smile<00:01:22.590> on<00:01:22.770> his

of the time he has a slight smile on his

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.520 
of the time he has a slight smile on his
face<00:01:22.950> but<00:01:23.130> not<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:23.460> smugglin<00:01:24.060> I<00:01:24.210> wonder<00:01:25.140> if<00:01:25.230> his

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
face but not a smugglin I wonder if his

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.080 
face but not a smugglin I wonder if his
was<00:01:25.740> not<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.070> more<00:01:26.220> attractive<00:01:26.460> default

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
was not the more attractive default

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.520 
was not the more attractive default
expression<00:01:27.660> because<00:01:27.900> that<00:01:28.050> kind<00:01:28.200> of<00:01:28.350> thing

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
expression because that kind of thing

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.020 
expression because that kind of thing
matters<00:01:28.710> I<00:01:28.950> thought<00:01:29.190> the<00:01:29.340> president<00:01:29.610> did<00:01:29.820> well

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
matters I thought the president did well

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.850 
matters I thought the president did well
I<00:01:30.060> thought<00:01:30.390> he<00:01:30.510> argued<00:01:30.810> his<00:01:30.900> points<00:01:31.290> well<00:01:31.440> but

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
I thought he argued his points well but

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.070 
I thought he argued his points well but
I<00:01:31.890> thought<00:01:32.130> he<00:01:32.280> was<00:01:32.400> burdened<00:01:32.970> time<00:01:33.690> and<00:01:33.990> again

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
I thought he was burdened time and again

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.440 
I thought he was burdened time and again
by<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.530> record<00:01:35.010> it's<00:01:35.460> very<00:01:35.790> difficult<00:01:36.090> to

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
by the record it's very difficult to

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.820 
by the record it's very difficult to
talk<00:01:36.690> about<00:01:36.870> how<00:01:37.110> well<00:01:37.350> you're<00:01:37.500> going<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.680> do

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:37.830 
talk about how well you're going to do

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.740 
talk about how well you're going to do
against<00:01:38.130> Iran<00:01:38.460> when<00:01:38.670> her<00:01:38.790> honest<00:01:39.150> nuclear

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
against Iran when her honest nuclear

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.270 
against Iran when her honest nuclear
program<00:01:40.170> which<00:01:40.350> you<00:01:40.470> pledged<00:01:40.710> to<00:01:40.740> stop<00:01:41.100> is

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
program which you pledged to stop is

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.040 
program which you pledged to stop is
still<00:01:41.490> going<00:01:41.700> on<00:01:41.909> it's<00:01:42.300> very<00:01:42.540> hard<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:42.840> talk

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.050 
still going on it's very hard to talk

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:44.480 
still going on it's very hard to talk
about<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.409> strength<00:01:43.680> of<00:01:43.800> the<00:01:43.860> economy<00:01:44.159> when

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
about the strength of the economy when

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.520 
about the strength of the economy when
we<00:01:44.610> all<00:01:44.730> know<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.000> economy<00:01:45.420> is<00:01:45.450> not<00:01:45.600> strong<00:01:45.930> so

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
we all know the economy is not strong so

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.840 
we all know the economy is not strong so
I<00:01:46.560> thought<00:01:46.860> that<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.159> President<00:01:47.550> did<00:01:47.580> a<00:01:47.700> good

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
I thought that the President did a good

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.280 
I thought that the President did a good
job<00:01:47.909> arguing<00:01:48.659> what<00:01:48.870> because<00:01:49.260> of

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
job arguing what because of

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.850 
job arguing what because of
circumstances<00:01:49.590> may<00:01:50.580> be<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.820> weaker<00:01:51.090> case

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
circumstances may be the weaker case

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.500 
circumstances may be the weaker case
Chris<00:01:52.860> a<00:01:52.890> number<00:01:53.370> of<00:01:53.490> fact<00:01:53.729> Jack's<00:01:54.030> along<00:01:54.360> the

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:54.510 
Chris a number of fact Jack's along the

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.860 
Chris a number of fact Jack's along the
way<00:01:54.800> yeah<00:01:55.800> let<00:01:55.979> me<00:01:56.070> first<00:01:56.460> give<00:01:56.640> you<00:01:56.870> my

general<00:01:58.200> opinion<00:01:58.560> and<00:01:58.830> that<00:01:59.010> was<00:01:59.220> I<00:01:59.430> thought

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
general opinion and that was I thought

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:00.770 
general opinion and that was I thought
the<00:01:59.670> middle<00:01:59.970> of<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.060> debate<00:02:00.390> that<00:02:00.570> if<00:02:00.690> I'd

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
the middle of the debate that if I'd

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.240 
the middle of the debate that if I'd
been<00:02:00.930> on<00:02:01.020> a<00:02:01.080> desert<00:02:01.350> island<00:02:01.590> for<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.040> last

been on a desert island for the last
four<00:02:02.490> years<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:03.060> I<00:02:03.540> had<00:02:03.750> just<00:02:04.020> been

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.260 
four years and I had just been

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.469 
four years and I had just been
parachuted<00:02:04.650> into<00:02:05.100> this<00:02:05.310> debate<00:02:05.520> I<00:02:05.970> would<00:02:06.390> have

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
parachuted into this debate I would have

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.600 
parachuted into this debate I would have
thought<00:02:06.690> the<00:02:07.229> guy<00:02:07.380> who<00:02:07.440> turned<00:02:07.799> out<00:02:07.920> to<00:02:07.979> be<00:02:08.369> to

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
thought the guy who turned out to be to

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.639 
thought the guy who turned out to be to
be<00:02:08.640> Mitt<00:02:08.970> Romney<00:02:09.420> was<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:10.110> president

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
be Mitt Romney was the president

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.009 
be Mitt Romney was the president
protecting<00:02:11.280> a<00:02:11.370> lead<00:02:11.580> and<00:02:11.909> the<00:02:12.330> Barack<00:02:12.599> Obama

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:13.019 
protecting a lead and the Barack Obama

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:14.960 
protecting a lead and the Barack Obama
was<00:02:13.260> the<00:02:13.409> Challenger<00:02:14.040> trying<00:02:14.459> somewhat

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
was the Challenger trying somewhat

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.150 
was the Challenger trying somewhat
desperately<00:02:15.450> to<00:02:15.569> catch<00:02:15.750> up<00:02:16.080> Obama<00:02:16.890> was

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
desperately to catch up Obama was

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.040 
desperately to catch up Obama was
slashing<00:02:17.520> was<00:02:17.940> personal<00:02:18.600> was

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
slashing was personal was

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.800 
slashing was personal was
I<00:02:19.560> thought<00:02:20.280> that<00:02:20.430> Romney<00:02:20.790> was<00:02:20.940> big<00:02:21.240> picture

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
I thought that Romney was big picture

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.590 
I thought that Romney was big picture
seemed<00:02:22.740> to<00:02:22.830> have<00:02:23.040> much<00:02:23.430> more<00:02:23.670> of<00:02:23.730> an<00:02:24.060> agenda

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
seemed to have much more of an agenda

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.420 
seemed to have much more of an agenda
for<00:02:24.840> the<00:02:24.900> future<00:02:24.930> than<00:02:25.650> the<00:02:25.680> President<00:02:26.250> did

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
for the future than the President did

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.300 
for the future than the President did
and<00:02:26.700> I<00:02:27.060> emailed<00:02:27.840> one<00:02:28.020> of<00:02:28.170> his<00:02:28.590> top<00:02:28.800> aides<00:02:29.100> in

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310

behind this strategy and clearly he was

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.850 
behind this strategy and clearly he was
