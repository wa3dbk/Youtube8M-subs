00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:07.950
 good to everyone and we all started the 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.450
 hydro kinesitherapy season or what 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.870
 which is the same physiotherapy within the 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.150
 Water 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.769
 aquatic therapy are we going to do 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.710
 an exercise in this first chapter that 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.320
 it's called ski ping 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.880
 in a very simple exercise and I'm going to 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.099
 explain why we do it so that 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.019
 we do it and the benefits that they have 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:27.239
 suppose we win injured 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.669
 most sports have a 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:32.699
 athletics base soccer the 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:34.559
 basketball tennis all involve the 

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:36.780
 race except swimming most 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.550
 sports are terrestrial injuries 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.250
 they can be due to an accident or they can be 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.949
 by muscle overload or joint 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.659
 case you injure yourself well as well as 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:47.640
 they're stopped for a while because you can not 

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:50.160
 doing nothing tends to fatten up that 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.079
 overweight does not benefit you either 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.929
 joint level and what you want to start 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.969
 to recover the physical form and also 

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:58.320
 the racing sensations because when 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.780
 they are long stopped also they are 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.600
 they lose those sensations mentally 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.090
 of career that body scheme that 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.460
 we have dynamic as really not 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.530
 You can go running to recover the 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.720
 weight because it is also generating a lot 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.420
 stress on the joints and maybe 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:19.380
 at muscular level because water minimizes 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.180
 much all that impact and that 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.130
 those micro hits that you are giving the 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.969
 joints when doing the technique of 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.770
 race here 

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:28.979
 we help to recover that scheme 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.270
 dynamic body the race to 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.490
 same time we work the 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.250
 musculature worth it is not such a job 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.869
 intense as when we run but if 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.640
 we can do a little more intense if 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.619
 we increase the frequency 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.069
 we got to work by doing the 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.929
 skiing ping look at all the part of 

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:47.680
 the quad is when we stretch the 

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:49.450
 leg 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.430
 we work the hip flexors the 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.540
 psoas iliac and the rectum portion 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.450
 anterior quadriceps 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:58.070
 the twins when we jump on the floor 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.329
 we are going to work on all of this 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.329
 they are the legs also the glutes 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.860
 not only works inferior train but that 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.690
 work superior train thing that does not happen 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.729
 while we are going to run the ideal is that 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.070
 the water is more or less at this height 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.750
 study halls more or less power 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.760
 be a little more sunken or a bit more 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.830
 outside but so they can work 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.970
 the arms that the water is more or less 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.470
 at the height of the shoulders as we 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.390
 we help with the arms to compensate 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.090
 the movement because we work all the 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.290
 anterior part of posterior deltoid 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.170
 also with much more backwards 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.930
 we have the 10 ex in a tension 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.310
 isometric that we also work a 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:37.300
 little the breastplate to throw the arms towards 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.650
 forward and a little to compensate when going up 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.330
 one leg with the opposite arm 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.920
 we also work the trunk and the 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.690
 career and all that impacts 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.310
 indirectly in our abs 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.860
 in our abdominal girdle this too 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.510
 will help us at the time of going to the bathroom 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.970
 accelerate all intestinal transit 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.040
 In addition, many people think that 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.540
 swimming is the most complete sport that 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.150
 it exists because the train works so much 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.680
 superior as the bottom train but not 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.510
 have stopped to think that the 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.489
 sit-ups are not worked 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.799
 practically nothing in swimming just 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:07.360
 when the combined improvement of back and 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:09.640
 comes out in position of minimum resistance 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.620
 making dolphin shake there works a 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.209
 little the abdominals but normally 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.310
 as always you have to try to adopt 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:16.959
 the position of least resistance and in 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.060
 all the ships you have to go the most 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:21.610
 stretched as possible by the belly the 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.170
 you have stretched and not the against in any 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.019
 then you do not work 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:29.170
 abdominals that can cause 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:30.939
 decompensation lumbar hyperlordosis and 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.739
 to compensate this also serves the 

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:35.379
 skiing ping the exercise that I propose is 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:37.650
 the next 30 seconds ago with a lot 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:37.650
 intensity 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:48.200
 and 30 seconds to recover if you want 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.180
 work more intensely could 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.780
 increase the work time strong 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:55.670
 reduce rest time or do it 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.530
 more intensely stay longer if 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.420
 you want to increase the intensity you can 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.650
 use a specific how are you 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.870
 you can get in the water perfectly 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:05.300
 that weigh more or if not the bottles of 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:07.170
 small water filled with water 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:10.069
 then here 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.069
 and the team 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:15.540
 and you work much better the superior train 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.130
 you can do it on the site or you can 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.730
 do it also moving a little 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.730
 as well 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:26.640
 The good thing about this exercise is that we 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:28.800
 generates impacts on the joints 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:31.800
 with the same intensity that generates 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:34.730
 when you have to be carrying your 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.840
 own weight and running we will achieve 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:39.630
 recover our feelings of 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.400
 career without impacting our 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.410
 joints apart from that we work 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.670
 the muscles involved in the race and 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.980
 that of current has a transfer 

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:49.380
 positive for the land sport that 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:51.300
 we are practicing also helps us in 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:54.480
 swimming to compensate for 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:56.100
 decompensation in this case 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:58.290
 the work of the abdominals the 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:00.600
 abdominal distension that we can have to 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:02.520
 lumbar hyperlordosis for example that 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.810
 we can have with 3 minutitos we already have 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.520
 because then we're going to work a 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:07.590
 series of variants and a series of 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.000
 exercises that will help us 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:12.500
 complement all this work of 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.500
 aquatic therapy come a greeting
