to do is that allows us to start
recording<00:00:48.810> what<00:00:49.530> we're<00:00:49.710> going<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:50.100> do<00:00:50.420> and

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
recording what we're going to do and

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.360 
recording what we're going to do and
it'll<00:00:51.840> put<00:00:52.140> it<00:00:52.260> into<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.530> nice<00:00:52.740> little<00:00:52.950> format

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
it'll put it into a nice little format

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.400 
it'll put it into a nice little format
for<00:00:53.610> so<00:00:53.790> I'm<00:00:53.880> going<00:00:54.000> to<00:00:54.030> show<00:00:54.270> this<00:00:54.510> or<00:00:55.140> going

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
for so I'm going to show this or going

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.100 
for so I'm going to show this or going
to<00:00:55.470> demonstrate<00:00:55.620> this<00:00:56.130> by<00:00:56.630> making<00:00:57.630> the<00:00:57.930> GAD

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:58.110 
to demonstrate this by making the GAD

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.670 
to demonstrate this by making the GAD
folder<00:00:58.650> and<00:00:58.830> you<00:00:58.890> can<00:00:59.370> see<00:00:59.870> what<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:01.020> saves<00:01:01.350> and

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
folder and you can see what it saves and

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.470 
folder and you can see what it saves and
how<00:01:01.800> this<00:01:02.010> will<00:01:02.190> be<00:01:02.310> a<00:01:02.340> useful<00:01:02.610> utility<00:01:02.970> if<00:01:03.360> you

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
how this will be a useful utility if you

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.670 
how this will be a useful utility if you
ever<00:01:03.570> wanted<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:03.900> do<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.049> walk-through<00:01:04.619> for

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
ever wanted to do a walk-through for

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.510 
ever wanted to do a walk-through for
anyone<00:01:05.129> so<00:01:05.820> we'll<00:01:05.939> start<00:01:06.270> recording<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:07.520> will

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
anyone so we'll start recording and will

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.429 
anyone so we'll start recording and will
minimize<00:01:08.939> this<00:01:09.179> here<00:01:09.570> it'll<00:01:09.929> show<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:10.259> down

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
minimize this here it'll show it down

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.889 
minimize this here it'll show it down
here<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:10.979> what<00:01:11.549> it<00:01:11.670> does<00:01:11.850> is<00:01:12.119> every<00:01:12.479> time<00:01:12.689> we

00:01:12.889 --> 00:01:12.899 
here and what it does is every time we

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:14.480 
here and what it does is every time we
click<00:01:13.259> on<00:01:13.439> something<00:01:13.740> it'll<00:01:14.159> actually

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
click on something it'll actually

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.370 
click on something it'll actually
capture<00:01:15.240> that<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.570> you'll<00:01:15.689> see<00:01:15.960> because<00:01:16.170> the

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
capture that and you'll see because the

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.380 
capture that and you'll see because the
curse<00:01:16.590> she'll<00:01:16.770> turn<00:01:16.979> red<00:01:17.340> so<00:01:17.369> we're<00:01:18.210> going<00:01:18.299> to

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
curse she'll turn red so we're going to

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.700 
curse she'll turn red so we're going to
right-click<00:01:18.600> in<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.020> middle<00:01:19.289> the<00:01:19.380> screen

right-click in the middle the screen

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.120 
right-click in the middle the screen
it's<00:01:19.890> going<00:01:20.039> to<00:01:20.100> capture<00:01:20.490> that<00:01:20.700> go<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.270> new<00:01:21.570> and

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:02.109 
this once but we're going to just call
this<00:01:58.340> one<00:01:58.630> demo<00:01:59.630> and<00:01:59.899> save<00:02:00.590> it<00:02:00.880> and<00:02:01.880> then<00:02:01.939> we

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
this one demo and save it and then we

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:04.359 
this one demo and save it and then we
can<00:02:02.209> close<00:02:02.390> out<00:02:02.659> of<00:02:02.689> this<00:02:02.840> utility<00:02:03.500> what<00:02:04.250> we're

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
can close out of this utility what we're

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:05.740 
can close out of this utility what we're
going<00:02:04.459> to<00:02:04.549> do<00:02:04.700> now<00:02:04.909> is<00:02:04.939> we're<00:02:05.420> going<00:02:05.509> to<00:02:05.599> go

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
going to do now is we're going to go

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.199 
going to do now is we're going to go
into<00:02:05.959> our<00:02:06.170> documents<00:02:06.979> folder<00:02:07.369> we'll<00:02:07.969> take<00:02:08.149> a

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
into our documents folder we'll take a

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:10.570 
into our documents folder we'll take a
look<00:02:08.450> at<00:02:08.660> what<00:02:09.200> it's<00:02:09.349> done<00:02:09.590> and<00:02:09.890> what<00:02:10.429> it's

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
look at what it's done and what it's

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.759 
look at what it's done and what it's
done<00:02:10.789> here<00:02:11.120> is<00:02:11.239> it<00:02:11.269> is<00:02:11.540> actually<00:02:11.780> created<00:02:12.620> a

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:12.769 
done here is it is actually created a

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:16.600 
done here is it is actually created a
zip<00:02:13.160> folder<00:02:13.400> for<00:02:14.090> us<00:02:14.239> that<00:02:14.629> has<00:02:14.980> this<00:02:15.980> file<00:02:16.280> or

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
zip folder for us that has this file or

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.069 
zip folder for us that has this file or
all<00:02:16.730> the<00:02:16.879> screen<00:02:17.150> captures<00:02:17.569> in<00:02:17.750> it<00:02:17.900> and<00:02:17.989> so

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:18.079 
all the screen captures in it and so

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:20.650 
all the screen captures in it and so
will<00:02:18.170> go<00:02:18.349> into<00:02:18.470> demo<00:02:18.970> we'll<00:02:19.970> take<00:02:20.180> a<00:02:20.209> look<00:02:20.450> at

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
will go into demo we'll take a look at

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.800 
will go into demo we'll take a look at
what<00:02:20.840> the<00:02:21.530> HTML<00:02:22.220> file<00:02:22.519> it<00:02:22.849> created<00:02:23.269> looks<00:02:23.569> like

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
what the HTML file it created looks like

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.220 
what the HTML file it created looks like
so<00:02:24.590> go<00:02:24.829> inside<00:02:25.220> of<00:02:25.250> here<00:02:25.610> and<00:02:25.730> basically<00:02:26.569> what

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
so go inside of here and basically what

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.039 
so go inside of here and basically what
it<00:02:27.290> does<00:02:27.410> is<00:02:27.829> it<00:02:27.860> records<00:02:28.519> the<00:02:28.610> steps<00:02:29.000> that<00:02:29.360> you

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:30.049 
it does is it records the steps that you

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:32.440 
it does is it records the steps that you
take<00:02:30.319> on<00:02:30.739> your<00:02:30.859> computer<00:02:31.340> now<00:02:31.519> I<00:02:31.790> can<00:02:32.090> see<00:02:32.299> this

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
take on your computer now I can see this

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.660 
take on your computer now I can see this
being<00:02:32.629> useful<00:02:32.980> one<00:02:33.980> if<00:02:34.190> you<00:02:34.340> had<00:02:34.489> to

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
being useful one if you had to

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.069 
being useful one if you had to
demonstrate<00:02:34.849> a<00:02:35.269> problem<00:02:35.690> that<00:02:35.780> you're<00:02:35.900> having

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:36.079 
demonstrate a problem that you're having

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:37.300 
demonstrate a problem that you're having
and<00:02:36.410> you<00:02:36.470> want<00:02:36.650> to<00:02:36.769> give<00:02:36.950> that<00:02:37.129> to<00:02:37.280> somebody

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
and you want to give that to somebody

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.800 
and you want to give that to somebody
but<00:02:37.879> to<00:02:38.209> if<00:02:38.720> you<00:02:38.840> want<00:02:38.989> to<00:02:39.079> do<00:02:39.200> a<00:02:39.230> walk-through

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
but to if you want to do a walk-through

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.119 
but to if you want to do a walk-through
showing<00:02:41.810> how<00:02:41.989> to<00:02:42.019> actually<00:02:42.470> do<00:02:42.799> something

00:02:43.119 --> 00:02:43.129 
showing how to actually do something

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:46.089 
showing how to actually do something
such<00:02:44.120> as<00:02:44.150> we<00:02:44.780> want<00:02:44.989> to<00:02:45.109> show<00:02:45.260> people<00:02:45.290> how<00:02:45.739> to<00:02:45.769> do

00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:46.099 
such as we want to show people how to do

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:48.339 
such as we want to show people how to do
the<00:02:46.489> GAD<00:02:46.670> mode<00:02:46.970> folder<00:02:47.569> so<00:02:47.840> if<00:02:47.900> you<00:02:48.019> can<00:02:48.139> have

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:48.349 
the GAD mode folder so if you can have

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:51.940 
the GAD mode folder so if you can have
all<00:02:48.560> the<00:02:48.829> windows<00:02:49.930> different<00:02:50.930> features<00:02:51.680> all

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
all the windows different features all

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.890 
all the windows different features all
in<00:02:52.099> one<00:02:52.280> location<00:02:52.359> we<00:02:53.359> would<00:02:53.510> just<00:02:53.720> simply

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
in one location we would just simply

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.830 
in one location we would just simply
copy<00:02:54.739> this<00:02:55.040> into<00:02:55.310> a<00:02:55.519> program<00:02:55.940> like<00:02:56.150> word<00:02:56.359> and

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
copy this into a program like word and

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.620 
copy this into a program like word and
modify<00:02:57.319> it<00:02:57.380> so<00:02:57.709> that<00:02:57.950> it<00:02:58.880> doesn't<00:02:59.060> say<00:02:59.359> things

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
modify it so that it doesn't say things

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.629 
modify it so that it doesn't say things
like<00:02:59.780> user<00:03:00.079> right<00:03:00.470> clicked<00:03:00.799> on<00:03:01.040> and<00:03:01.370> blah<00:03:01.609> blah

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:01.639 
like user right clicked on and blah blah

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:03.460 
like user right clicked on and blah blah
blah<00:03:01.819> we<00:03:02.180> can<00:03:02.359> actually<00:03:02.510> modify<00:03:02.989> and<00:03:03.319> keep

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
blah we can actually modify and keep

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.170 
blah we can actually modify and keep
these<00:03:03.680> screen<00:03:04.010> images<00:03:04.430> and<00:03:04.669> make<00:03:04.819> it<00:03:05.000> a<00:03:05.060> little

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
these screen images and make it a little

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.319 
these screen images and make it a little
more<00:03:05.349> readable<00:03:06.349> but<00:03:07.310> you<00:03:07.459> can<00:03:07.609> see<00:03:07.819> it<00:03:07.970> takes

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:08.329 
more readable but you can see it takes

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:11.370 
more readable but you can see it takes
screen<00:03:08.630> images<00:03:09.079> tells<00:03:09.859> what<00:03:10.280> steps<00:03:10.669> are<00:03:10.880> taken

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
screen images tells what steps are taken

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.129 
screen images tells what steps are taken
it's<00:03:12.380> actually<00:03:12.560> I<00:03:13.040> think<00:03:13.400> a<00:03:13.489> very<00:03:13.930> very<00:03:14.930> useful

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:15.139 
it's actually I think a very very useful

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:17.379 
it's actually I think a very very useful
tool<00:03:15.620> you<00:03:16.040> can<00:03:16.099> see<00:03:16.310> here<00:03:16.579> because<00:03:16.880> I<00:03:17.060> put<00:03:17.239> the

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:17.389 
tool you can see here because I put the

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:19.420 
tool you can see here because I put the
wrong<00:03:17.540> thing<00:03:17.840> in<00:03:17.989> there<00:03:18.230> we<00:03:18.859> backspace

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
wrong thing in there we backspace

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.250 
wrong thing in there we backspace
meaningly<00:03:19.940> deleted<00:03:20.540> what<00:03:20.720> was<00:03:20.870> there<00:03:21.700> and

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
meaningly deleted what was there and

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.220 
meaningly deleted what was there and
then<00:03:24.260> copied<00:03:24.739> in<00:03:24.919> the<00:03:25.639> actual<00:03:26.030> information<00:03:26.690> so

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
then copied in the actual information so

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.190 
then copied in the actual information so
it's<00:03:27.709> a<00:03:27.859> very<00:03:27.889> useful<00:03:28.400> tool<00:03:28.880> i<00:03:28.910> think<00:03:29.450> and<00:03:29.720> has

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
it's a very useful tool i think and has

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.990 
it's a very useful tool i think and has
some<00:03:30.470> good<00:03:30.709> applications<00:03:31.370> if<00:03:31.519> you<00:03:31.639> ever<00:03:31.730> had

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
some good applications if you ever had

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.839 
some good applications if you ever had
to<00:03:32.239> show<00:03:33.139> somebody<00:03:33.440> how<00:03:33.680> to<00:03:33.859> do<00:03:34.160> a<00:03:34.190> specific

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:34.849 
to show somebody how to do a specific

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:39.639 
to show somebody how to do a specific
procedure<00:03:35.569> inside<00:03:36.230> of<00:03:36.500> Windows<00:03:37.250> 7
