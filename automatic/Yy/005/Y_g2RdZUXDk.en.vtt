00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
you noticed but the ball on the right

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.930 
you noticed but the ball on the right
side<00:03:55.170> is<00:03:55.560> smaller<00:03:56.040> than<00:03:56.310> the<00:03:56.430> one<00:03:56.580> on<00:03:56.610> the<00:03:56.760> left

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
side is a bigger ball that's because the

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.300 
side is a bigger ball that's because the
swelling<00:03:59.610> was<00:03:59.730> still<00:04:00.060> a<00:04:00.450> little<00:04:00.980> as<00:04:01.980> two<00:04:02.160> had<00:04:02.280> a
