00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:27.039

 with the guide modify the xbox for 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:32.500

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:44.830
 Concerns at half link meca link is a 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:49.260
 very useful program in which size 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:49.260
 they are or are few 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:58.760
 on the 2 megabytes I believe while 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:01.329
 very useful also to download from 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.329
 of sites 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:06.300
 we can download it both on my forum 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.300
 and be on the official website 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.330
 download 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.390
 and anyway I'm saying that in the police station 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:17.060
 but if you need to hurl premium from 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.490
 all sites as you can see the sites 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.560
 they are megavideo megaupload and others 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.060
 platforms 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:29.520
 all in one program of course 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:30.690
 and for free I must have downloaded guide 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.750
 but this 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.920
 this icon 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.920
 we click on it 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.120
 the loading 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.560
 you want me to say 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.560
 this small screen 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.610
 we 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.820
 how to write to us 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.050
 nothing of 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.340
 serious I would say 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.340
 and difficult and completely normal 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.920
 it's very simple well 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.420
 I'm a member 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.420
 I put my use n 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.110
 but conceal them 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.550
 more than 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.069
 we find ourselves 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.400
 then 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:25.620
 this 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.439
 must be absolutely selected 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:32.069
 otherwise as we read the return of no 

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:35.520
 part of the year in a maximum of downloads 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:39.210
 which can be downloaded are seven 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:42.900
 then if we have we say a list of 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:45.470
 d link we can join them together forming a 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.470
 single file 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:55.540
 then we have mmbt 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:56.860
 if you excuse me for a hundred you download me 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.210
 once it has reached one hundred percent 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.210
 having to start up the computer 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:07.260
 which is not a virus is nothing then 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:10.500
 to access the link list 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.750
 we have to click on the sponsor one 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.810
 once clicked we have to wait here 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.840
 who comes out thanks for support later 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:21.430
 we can put 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.430
 one of our links list 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.740
 it seems only options to decide only 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:31.319
 the folder where they should be placed 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.690
 to say nothing to him afterwards 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:35.459
 what we do lapio 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.440
 thanks for my understanding also in 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:40.040
 this video 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.040
