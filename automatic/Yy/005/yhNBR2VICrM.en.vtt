00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
one shot as long as you shoot it between

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.630 
one shot as long as you shoot it between
both<00:00:32.850> objects<00:00:33.540> and<00:00:34.410> I'll<00:00:34.590> say<00:00:34.890> it<00:00:34.920> has<00:00:35.250> a<00:00:35.340> range

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
both objects and I'll say it has a range

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.479 
both objects and I'll say it has a range
of<00:00:35.850> maybe<00:00:36.230> almost<00:00:37.230> 20<00:00:37.620> meters<00:00:37.950> so<00:00:38.160> basically

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
of maybe almost 20 meters so basically

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.520 
of maybe almost 20 meters so basically
everything<00:00:38.850> that<00:00:39.210> isn't<00:00:39.450> around<00:00:39.870> 20<00:00:40.290> meters

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
everything that isn't around 20 meters

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.170 
everything that isn't around 20 meters
you<00:00:40.680> can<00:00:40.739> shoot<00:00:40.980> it<00:00:41.040> in<00:00:41.280> this<00:00:41.370> one<00:00:41.670> hits<00:00:41.940> I

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
you can shoot it in this one hits I

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.060 
you can shoot it in this one hits I
don't<00:00:43.050> really<00:00:43.230> think<00:00:43.350> you<00:00:43.590> can<00:00:43.739> destroy<00:00:43.890> a

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
don't really think you can destroy a

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.130 
don't really think you can destroy a
tank<00:00:44.309> of<00:00:44.460> course<00:00:44.760> with<00:00:44.969> one<00:00:45.210> hits<00:00:45.480> but<00:00:46.020> that

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
tank of course with one hits but that

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.450 
tank of course with one hits but that
will<00:00:46.230> actually<00:00:46.320> be<00:00:46.530> very<00:00:46.800> interesting<00:00:47.250> if<00:00:47.340> you

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
will actually be very interesting if you

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.400 
will actually be very interesting if you
actually<00:00:47.640> could<00:00:48.000> just<00:00:48.239> do<00:00:48.450> it<00:00:48.600> but<00:00:49.140> I<00:00:49.170> didn't

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
actually could just do it but I didn't

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.590 
actually could just do it but I didn't
really<00:00:49.620> try<00:00:49.829> it<00:00:49.890> so<00:00:50.100> i<00:00:50.160> really<00:00:50.489> don't<00:00:50.610> know<00:00:50.910> but

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600
