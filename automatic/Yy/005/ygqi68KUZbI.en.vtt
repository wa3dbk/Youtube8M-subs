you're<00:01:48.030> going<00:01:48.149> to<00:01:48.210> eventually<00:01:48.570> come<00:01:49.320> out<00:01:49.350> on

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
you're going to eventually come out on

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.319 
you're going to eventually come out on
the<00:01:49.680> other<00:01:49.770> side<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.460> it's<00:01:50.970> not<00:01:51.060> going<00:01:51.240> to

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
the other side and it's not going to

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.990 
the other side and it's not going to
work<00:01:51.479> correctly<00:01:51.799> so<00:01:52.799> make<00:01:53.189> sure<00:01:53.220> you<00:01:53.460> time<00:01:53.790> it

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
work correctly so make sure you time it

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.289 
work correctly so make sure you time it
time<00:01:54.780> it<00:01:54.930> at<00:01:55.079> a<00:01:55.110> good<00:01:55.740> time<00:01:55.979> it's<00:01:56.939> going<00:01:57.119> to<00:01:57.149> be

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
time it at a good time it's going to be

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.749 
time it at a good time it's going to be
kind<00:01:58.049> of<00:01:58.200> difficult<00:01:58.409> doing<00:01:59.130> this<00:01:59.250> glitch<00:01:59.520> the

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
kind of difficult doing this glitch the

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.700 
kind of difficult doing this glitch the
first<00:01:59.969> couple<00:02:00.149> of<00:02:00.329> times<00:02:00.390> but<00:02:01.229> after<00:02:01.560> doing

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
first couple of times but after doing

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.740 
first couple of times but after doing
this<00:02:01.950> a<00:02:02.009> handful<00:02:02.460> of<00:02:02.490> times<00:02:02.759> you<00:02:03.329> should<00:02:03.390> get

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
this a handful of times you should get

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.780 
this a handful of times you should get
it<00:02:03.899> down<00:02:04.140> and<00:02:04.439> you<00:02:04.770> should<00:02:05.070> be<00:02:05.219> able<00:02:05.340> to<00:02:05.460> do<00:02:05.610> it

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
it down and you should be able to do it

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.809 
it down and you should be able to do it
every<00:02:06.000> single<00:02:06.360> time<00:02:06.799> in<00:02:07.799> this<00:02:08.069> glitch<00:02:08.429> there

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
every single time in this glitch there

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.330 
every single time in this glitch there
is<00:02:08.970> no<00:02:09.209> barriers<00:02:09.660> around<00:02:10.050> you<00:02:10.349> so<00:02:10.950> there<00:02:11.310> is

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
is no barriers around you so there is

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.070 
is no barriers around you so there is
nothing<00:02:11.790> that<00:02:11.819> is<00:02:12.090> going<00:02:12.239> to<00:02:12.330> penetrate<00:02:12.900> your

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
nothing that is going to penetrate your

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.750 
nothing that is going to penetrate your
bullets

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
bullets

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.790 
bullets
you'll<00:02:14.760> be<00:02:14.910> able<00:02:15.000> to<00:02:15.180> kill<00:02:15.360> anybody<00:02:15.750> if<00:02:16.200> you

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
you'll be able to kill anybody if you

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.380 
you'll be able to kill anybody if you
see<00:02:17.040> them<00:02:17.190> on<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.430> outside<00:02:19.400> so<00:02:20.400> if<00:02:20.730> I<00:02:20.910> if<00:02:21.120> I<00:02:21.240> can

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
see them on the outside so if I if I can

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.940 
see them on the outside so if I if I can
get<00:02:21.510> a<00:02:21.570> couple<00:02:21.750> people<00:02:22.110> i<00:02:22.350> will<00:02:22.530> show<00:02:22.740> you<00:02:22.800> that

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
get a couple people i will show you that

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.430 
get a couple people i will show you that
it<00:02:23.790> works<00:02:24.240> anywhere<00:02:25.140> on<00:02:25.430> the<00:02:26.430> outside<00:02:27.440> but

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
it works anywhere on the outside but

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.560 
it works anywhere on the outside but
this<00:02:28.590> is<00:02:28.770> a<00:02:28.800> very<00:02:29.160> good<00:02:29.250> glitch<00:02:29.730> it's<00:02:30.000> uh<00:02:30.210> it's

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
this is a very good glitch it's uh it's

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.930 
this is a very good glitch it's uh it's
pretty<00:02:31.380> good<00:02:31.590> for<00:02:31.830> getting<00:02:31.920> Kim<00:02:32.250> strikes<00:02:32.640> I've

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
pretty good for getting Kim strikes I've

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.480 
pretty good for getting Kim strikes I've
gotten<00:02:33.270> a<00:02:33.330> couple<00:02:33.450> Kim<00:02:33.810> strikes<00:02:34.190> using<00:02:35.190> this

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
gotten a couple Kim strikes using this

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.660 
gotten a couple Kim strikes using this
glitch<00:02:35.790> i<00:02:36.060> would<00:02:36.600> recommend<00:02:37.280> getting<00:02:38.280> some

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
glitch i would recommend getting some

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.300 
glitch i would recommend getting some
guns<00:02:38.970> that<00:02:39.210> have<00:02:39.350> large<00:02:40.350> amounts<00:02:40.770> of<00:02:40.860> ammo

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
guns that have large amounts of ammo

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.890 
guns that have large amounts of ammo
because<00:02:41.880> if<00:02:42.030> you<00:02:42.120> could<00:02:42.300> guns<00:02:42.480> have<00:02:42.660> large

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
because if you could guns have large

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.530 
because if you could guns have large
amounts<00:02:43.230> of<00:02:43.290> ammo<00:02:43.590> you're<00:02:43.980> most<00:02:44.310> likely<00:02:44.580> not

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
amounts of ammo you're most likely not

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.880 
amounts of ammo you're most likely not
going<00:02:45.570> to<00:02:45.780> run<00:02:45.960> out<00:02:45.990> of<00:02:46.140> ammo<00:02:46.910> also<00:02:48.680> some<00:02:49.680> good

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
going to run out of ammo also some good

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.010 
going to run out of ammo also some good
spots<00:02:50.220> are<00:02:50.550> on<00:02:50.760> the<00:02:51.000> sides<00:02:51.300> if<00:02:51.540> you<00:02:51.660> can<00:02:51.840> get

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
spots are on the sides if you can get

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:53.840 
spots are on the sides if you can get
far<00:02:52.560> enough<00:02:52.680> to<00:02:52.950> the<00:02:53.040> side<00:02:53.250> where<00:02:53.550> you're<00:02:53.670> not

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
far enough to the side where you're not

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.930 
far enough to the side where you're not
hanging<00:02:54.210> out<00:02:54.360> so<00:02:54.750> people<00:02:54.930> can<00:02:55.320> actually<00:02:55.940> see

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
hanging out so people can actually see

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
hanging out so people can actually see
you<00:02:57.090> and<00:02:57.270> kill<00:02:57.480> you<00:02:57.510> I<00:02:57.950> you<00:02:58.950> can<00:02:59.160> kill<00:02:59.370> somebody

00:02:59.950 --> 00:02:59.960 
you and kill you I you can kill somebody

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.210 
you and kill you I you can kill somebody
if<00:03:00.960> they're<00:03:01.170> close<00:03:01.350> enough<00:03:01.380> to<00:03:01.710> the<00:03:01.800> side<00:03:02.010> you

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
if they're close enough to the side you

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.060 
if they're close enough to the side you
can<00:03:02.400> actually<00:03:02.700> pick<00:03:03.120> up<00:03:03.270> their<00:03:03.420> gun<00:03:03.950> but<00:03:04.950> also

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
can actually pick up their gun but also

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:09.140 
can actually pick up their gun but also
you<00:03:05.340> can<00:03:05.610> just<00:03:05.790> use<00:03:06.590> overkill<00:03:07.590> and<00:03:08.150> actually

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
you can just use overkill and actually

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.620 
you can just use overkill and actually
have<00:03:09.330> two<00:03:10.080> primary<00:03:10.380> guns<00:03:10.940> just<00:03:11.940> pick<00:03:12.180> two<00:03:12.390> guns

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
have two primary guns just pick two guns

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.990 
have two primary guns just pick two guns
that<00:03:12.810> have<00:03:12.870> a<00:03:12.960> lot<00:03:13.170> of<00:03:13.200> ammo<00:03:13.610> and<00:03:14.610> if<00:03:14.730> you<00:03:14.790> do

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
that have a lot of ammo and if you do

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.110 
that have a lot of ammo and if you do
this<00:03:15.180> you're<00:03:15.840> not<00:03:15.930> going<00:03:16.200> to<00:03:16.260> run<00:03:16.380> out<00:03:16.410> of<00:03:16.530> ammo

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
this you're not going to run out of ammo

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.880 
this you're not going to run out of ammo
so<00:03:18.120> the<00:03:18.300> big<00:03:18.750> issues<00:03:19.140> that<00:03:19.350> people<00:03:19.500> have

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
so the big issues that people have

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.090 
so the big issues that people have
getting<00:03:20.640> into<00:03:20.910> this<00:03:21.030> glitch<00:03:21.390> is<00:03:21.600> um<00:03:22.020> when<00:03:22.950> they

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
getting into this glitch is um when they

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.150 
getting into this glitch is um when they
put<00:03:23.820> the<00:03:23.970> ballistic<00:03:24.390> vest<00:03:24.660> down<00:03:25.260> and<00:03:25.590> then<00:03:26.040> go

end up dying on their way to the on
their<00:03:32.010> way<00:03:32.130> to<00:03:32.160> actually<00:03:32.850> get<00:03:33.030> in<00:03:33.150> front<00:03:33.390> of

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
their way to actually get in front of

their way to actually get in front of
the<00:03:33.600> cart<00:03:33.870> and<00:03:34.080> when<00:03:34.530> you<00:03:34.620> do<00:03:34.770> that<00:03:35.040> the<00:03:35.960> carts

already moved all the way over here you

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.600 
already moved all the way over here you
don't<00:03:39.480> have<00:03:39.660> time<00:03:39.960> to<00:03:40.320> go<00:03:40.470> to<00:03:40.740> go<00:03:41.370> back<00:03:41.580> and
