let's see what she's up to so I'm
reading<00:01:36.950> her<00:01:37.040> text<00:01:37.280> messages<00:01:37.310> right<00:01:37.790> now

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
reading her text messages right now

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:41.889 
reading her text messages right now
and<00:01:39.770> this<00:01:40.700> is<00:01:40.820> going<00:01:40.969> to<00:01:41.030> give<00:01:41.210> me<00:01:41.329> some<00:01:41.600> idea

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:41.899 
and this is going to give me some idea

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:44.770 
and this is going to give me some idea
what<00:01:42.170> the<00:01:42.350> crime<00:01:42.829> can<00:01:43.069> be<00:01:43.100> about<00:01:43.780> basically

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
what the crime can be about basically

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.480 
what the crime can be about basically
you<00:01:44.899> could<00:01:45.020> read<00:01:45.200> what<00:01:45.350> people<00:01:45.380> are<00:01:45.740> saying

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
you could read what people are saying

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.849 
you could read what people are saying
and<00:01:46.759> this<00:01:47.030> is<00:01:47.210> what<00:01:47.359> the<00:01:47.479> real<00:01:48.020> CTOs<00:01:48.530> system

00:01:48.849 --> 00:01:48.859 
and this is what the real CTOs system

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:50.440 
and this is what the real CTOs system
and<00:01:48.979> systems<00:01:49.280> the<00:01:49.429> predictive<00:01:49.969> crime<00:01:50.119> systems

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
and systems the predictive crime systems

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.990 
and systems the predictive crime systems
do<00:01:50.600> is<00:01:51.939> they<00:01:54.130> they<00:01:55.130> basically<00:01:55.520> look<00:01:55.789> at<00:01:55.880> the

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
do is they they basically look at the

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.660 
do is they they basically look at the
data<00:01:56.179> that<00:01:56.450> you<00:01:56.600> have<00:01:56.810> and<00:01:57.520> predict<00:01:58.520> whether

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
data that you have and predict whether

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.449 
data that you have and predict whether
or<00:01:58.789> not<00:01:58.849> you're<00:01:59.030> likely<00:01:59.179> to<00:01:59.299> commit<00:01:59.569> a<00:01:59.630> crime

00:02:00.449 --> 00:02:00.459 
or not you're likely to commit a crime

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:03.010 
or not you're likely to commit a crime

here eden is not scannable by the CTOs

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.040 
here eden is not scannable by the CTOs
so<00:02:25.670> the<00:02:25.819> camera<00:02:26.120> he's<00:02:26.239> not<00:02:26.420> vulnerable<00:02:26.690> to<00:02:26.900> the

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
so the camera he's not vulnerable to the

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.050 
so the camera he's not vulnerable to the
camera<00:02:27.319> system<00:02:27.620> so<00:02:28.190> i<00:02:28.250> can<00:02:28.400> hack<00:02:28.580> this<00:02:28.760> woman

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
camera system so i can hack this woman

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.000 
camera system so i can hack this woman
here<00:02:29.330> if<00:02:29.780> I<00:02:29.930> try<00:02:30.080> to<00:02:30.110> focus<00:02:30.380> the<00:02:30.650> profile

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
here if I try to focus the profile

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.320 
here if I try to focus the profile
around<00:02:31.160> Aiden<00:02:31.550> he's<00:02:32.090> actually<00:02:32.300> blocked<00:02:34.330> so

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
around Aiden he's actually blocked so

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.390 
around Aiden he's actually blocked so
he's<00:02:35.690> he's<00:02:36.349> a<00:02:36.380> kind<00:02:36.769> of<00:02:36.860> a<00:02:36.920> ghost<00:02:37.130> of<00:02:37.310> the

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
he's he's a kind of a ghost of the

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.100 
he's he's a kind of a ghost of the
system<00:02:37.730> so<00:02:38.540> you<00:02:38.599> don't<00:02:38.720> need<00:02:38.810> to<00:02:38.900> worry<00:02:38.930> about

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
system so you don't need to worry about

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.100 
system so you don't need to worry about
cameras<00:02:39.560> detecting<00:02:40.010> you<00:02:40.360> so<00:02:41.360> we've<00:02:41.510> seen<00:02:41.959> what

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.810 

it's<00:04:24.350> perfectly<00:04:24.740> legitimate<00:04:24.980> by<00:04:25.490> the<00:04:25.550> way<00:04:25.760> to

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
it's perfectly legitimate by the way to

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.180 
it's perfectly legitimate by the way to
just<00:04:26.660> disrupt<00:04:27.020> the<00:04:27.140> guy<00:04:27.290> hack<00:04:27.620> something<00:04:27.920> as

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
just disrupt the guy hack something as

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:29.800 
just disrupt the guy hack something as
well<00:04:28.310> if<00:04:28.820> I<00:04:29.000> had<00:04:29.030> not<00:04:29.210> been<00:04:29.390> able<00:04:29.510> to<00:04:29.660> catch

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
well if I had not been able to catch

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.220 
well if I had not been able to catch
them<00:04:29.990> so<00:04:30.170> quickly<00:04:31.690> it<00:04:32.690> might<00:04:32.870> have<00:04:32.960> led<00:04:33.110> to<00:04:33.200> a

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
people can get hurt big of vigilance is

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:42.480 
people can get hurt big of vigilance is
messy<00:04:37.640> business
