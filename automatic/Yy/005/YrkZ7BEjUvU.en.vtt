00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.839 
see most of the transformers or beasts
would<00:02:10.080> be<00:02:10.289> like<00:02:10.560> just<00:02:11.069> straight<00:02:11.489> but<00:02:11.730> this

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
would be like just straight but this

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.550 
would be like just straight but this
guy's<00:02:12.090> a<00:02:12.329> little<00:02:12.599> twisted<00:02:12.959> so<00:02:13.109> he's<00:02:13.260> always

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
guy's a little twisted so he's always

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.559 
guy's a little twisted so he's always
looking<00:02:14.010> trying<00:02:14.760> to<00:02:14.939> look<00:02:15.090> behind

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
looking trying to look behind

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.369 
looking trying to look behind
but<00:02:15.749> not<00:02:15.900> getting<00:02:16.109> all<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.349> way<00:02:16.439> there<00:02:16.650> anyway

00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:18.379 
but not getting all the way there anyway

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:21.050 
but not getting all the way there anyway
articulation<00:02:19.379> consists<00:02:19.829> of<00:02:20.069> his<00:02:20.430> fourth

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
articulation consists of his fourth

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.899 
articulation consists of his fourth
teeny<00:02:21.569> little<00:02:21.870> feet<00:02:22.230> at<00:02:22.920> all<00:02:23.099> ends<00:02:23.489> with<00:02:23.670> ball

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:23.909 
teeny little feet at all ends with ball

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:26.209 
teeny little feet at all ends with ball
joints<00:02:24.329> and<00:02:24.510> they<00:02:25.290> worked<00:02:25.590> reasonably<00:02:26.129> well

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:26.219 
joints and they worked reasonably well

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:29.599 
joints and they worked reasonably well
oh<00:02:27.260> forgot<00:02:28.260> to<00:02:28.409> give<00:02:28.560> a<00:02:28.829> map<00:02:29.040> for<00:02:29.219> the<00:02:29.310> look<00:02:29.459> I'd

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:29.609 
oh forgot to give a map for the look I'd

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:31.699 
oh forgot to give a map for the look I'd
give<00:02:29.819> it<00:02:29.849> a<00:02:30.120> least<00:02:30.719> an<00:02:31.139> eight<00:02:31.409> because<00:02:31.650> he

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
give it a least an eight because he

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:33.259 
give it a least an eight because he
looks<00:02:31.920> quite<00:02:32.129> cool<00:02:32.159> and<00:02:32.519> heavily<00:02:32.879> armored<00:02:33.209> and

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
looks quite cool and heavily armored and

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:37.220 
looks quite cool and heavily armored and
so<00:02:34.219> articulation<00:02:35.219> he<00:02:35.370> also<00:02:35.549> has<00:02:36.030> a<00:02:36.719> little

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
so articulation he also has a little

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.390 
so articulation he also has a little
mouth<00:02:37.709> which<00:02:38.040> which<00:02:38.519> opens<00:02:38.909> wrong<00:02:40.280> but<00:02:41.280> this

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
mouth which which opens wrong but this

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.280 
mouth which which opens wrong but this
is<00:02:41.579> one<00:02:41.760> of<00:02:41.790> his<00:02:42.000> failing<00:02:42.689> gimmicks<00:02:43.109> because

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
is one of his failing gimmicks because

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.979 
is one of his failing gimmicks because
it<00:02:43.409> doesn't<00:02:43.680> work<00:02:43.859> too<00:02:44.099> well<00:02:44.480> yes<00:02:47.689> okay<00:02:48.689> and

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
it doesn't work too well yes okay and

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:52.220 
it doesn't work too well yes okay and
here<00:02:49.260> is<00:02:49.409> bazooka<00:02:50.099> in<00:02:50.219> his<00:02:51.049> dinosaur<00:02:52.049> mode

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
here is bazooka in his dinosaur mode

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.559 
here is bazooka in his dinosaur mode
will<00:02:52.469> color<00:02:52.709> codes<00:02:53.010> don't<00:02:53.969> really<00:02:54.209> know<00:02:54.359> what

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
will color codes don't really know what

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:56.720 
will color codes don't really know what
kind<00:02:54.750> of<00:02:54.780> dinosaur<00:02:54.959> is<00:02:55.379> again<00:02:55.859> I'm<00:02:56.430> sure

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730

kind of dinosaur is again I'm sure
someone<00:02:57.150> will<00:02:57.299> put<00:02:57.569> a<00:02:57.599> comment<00:02:57.959> below<00:02:58.489> but<00:02:59.489> I

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
someone will put a comment below but I

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:00.559 
someone will put a comment below but I

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
don't really care if it's not

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:02.449 
don't really care if it's not
technically<00:03:01.199> a<00:03:01.319> dinosaur<00:03:01.829> because<00:03:02.099> he<00:03:02.310> will

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
technically a dinosaur because he will

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.330 
technically a dinosaur because he will
always<00:03:02.879> have<00:03:03.060> been<00:03:03.239> marketed<00:03:03.810> as<00:03:04.379> a<00:03:04.439> dinosaur

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
always have been marketed as a dinosaur

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.110 
always have been marketed as a dinosaur
so<00:03:06.209> just<00:03:06.659> that<00:03:06.900> I'm<00:03:07.620> gonna<00:03:07.829> say<00:03:08.099> so<00:03:08.879> I'll<00:03:09.000> have

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
so just that I'm gonna say so I'll have

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.179 
so just that I'm gonna say so I'll have
a<00:03:09.209> quick<00:03:09.359> look<00:03:09.480> at<00:03:09.780> this<00:03:09.900> guy<00:03:10.139> I<00:03:10.409> have<00:03:10.949> a<00:03:11.069> look

00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:11.189 
a quick look at this guy I have a look

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:13.729 
a quick look at this guy I have a look
at<00:03:11.340> his<00:03:11.459> mouth<00:03:11.609> this<00:03:11.909> is<00:03:12.199> this<00:03:13.199> but<00:03:13.379> here<00:03:13.620> this

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
at his mouth this is this but here this

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:15.770 
at his mouth this is this but here this
graber<00:03:14.219> is<00:03:14.370> different<00:03:15.209> from<00:03:15.299> these<00:03:15.480> ones

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
graber is different from these ones

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.050 
graber is different from these ones
because<00:03:16.109> it<00:03:16.319> is<00:03:16.500> the<00:03:16.769> gimmick<00:03:16.980> you<00:03:17.370> pull<00:03:17.909> it

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
because it is the gimmick you pull it

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.319 
because it is the gimmick you pull it
and<00:03:18.299> that's<00:03:19.230> as<00:03:19.409> far<00:03:19.560> as<00:03:19.620> a<00:03:19.769> mouth<00:03:19.949> opens<00:03:20.430> with

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
and that's as far as a mouth opens with

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:23.330 
and that's as far as a mouth opens with
this<00:03:21.540> gimmick<00:03:21.780> if<00:03:22.379> you<00:03:22.560> push<00:03:22.769> your<00:03:22.919> back<00:03:23.099> it

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
this gimmick if you push your back it

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.339 
this gimmick if you push your back it
stays<00:03:23.609> open<00:03:23.879> so<00:03:24.629> you<00:03:24.720> need<00:03:24.870> to<00:03:24.959> close<00:03:25.169> it

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:25.349 
stays open so you need to close it

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:28.339 
stays open so you need to close it
manually<00:03:25.829> but<00:03:26.009> it's<00:03:26.159> more<00:03:26.280> fun<00:03:26.340> just<00:03:26.729> to<00:03:27.349> open

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:28.349 
manually but it's more fun just to open

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:31.330 
manually but it's more fun just to open
it<00:03:28.439> up<00:03:28.590> yourself<00:03:28.769> really<00:03:29.489> like<00:03:29.970> that<00:03:30.150> wrong

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340

well<00:04:04.349> unfortunately<00:04:04.879> but<00:04:05.879> you<00:04:06.090> get<00:04:06.239> the<00:04:06.299> idea

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:06.469 
well unfortunately but you get the idea

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:09.080 
well unfortunately but you get the idea
and<00:04:07.469> this<00:04:07.590> kind<00:04:07.829> of<00:04:07.979> lines<00:04:08.250> effect<00:04:08.669> is<00:04:08.849> used

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
and this kind of lines effect is used

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.149 
and this kind of lines effect is used
across<00:04:09.419> his<00:04:09.689> entire<00:04:09.719> bacha<00:04:10.349> so<00:04:10.560> you<00:04:10.620> can<00:04:10.769> see

00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:11.159 
across his entire bacha so you can see

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:13.610 
across his entire bacha so you can see
there<00:04:11.430> which<00:04:11.969> is<00:04:12.000> good<00:04:12.359> lots<00:04:13.199> of<00:04:13.379> little

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
there which is good lots of little

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.610 
there which is good lots of little
random<00:04:14.370> lumps<00:04:14.699> not<00:04:14.879> sure<00:04:15.090> if<00:04:15.150> they're<00:04:15.359> like

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
random lumps not sure if they're like

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.949 
random lumps not sure if they're like
plastic<00:04:16.620> air<00:04:17.120> imperfections<00:04:18.120> or<00:04:18.269> walk<00:04:18.659> but

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
plastic air imperfections or walk but

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.469 
plastic air imperfections or walk but
it's<00:04:19.169> it's<00:04:19.380> nice<00:04:19.620> it<00:04:19.829> breaks<00:04:20.099> it<00:04:20.280> up<00:04:20.449> so<00:04:21.449> you

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
it's it's nice it breaks it up so you

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:23.839 
it's it's nice it breaks it up so you
can<00:04:21.780> tell<00:04:21.959> he's<00:04:22.109> not<00:04:23.009> perfect<00:04:23.310> like<00:04:23.639> any

00:04:23.839 --> 00:04:23.849 
can tell he's not perfect like any

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:28.820 
can tell he's not perfect like any
dinosaur<00:04:24.419> would<00:04:24.690> not<00:04:25.110> be<00:04:25.289> perfect<00:04:26.510> and<00:04:27.560> one

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
dinosaur would not be perfect and one

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.860 
dinosaur would not be perfect and one
I do<00:04:29.190> have<00:04:29.310> a<00:04:29.370> problem<00:04:29.670> with<00:04:29.940> the<00:04:30.180> detail<00:04:30.600> is

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
I do have a problem with the detail is

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.500 
I do have a problem with the detail is
add<00:04:31.140> the<00:04:31.460> spikes<00:04:32.460> they<00:04:32.790> don't<00:04:32.970> really<00:04:33.270> seem<00:04:33.480> to

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
add the spikes they don't really seem to

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.710 
add the spikes they don't really seem to
like<00:04:34.160> have<00:04:35.160> any<00:04:35.310> particular<00:04:35.850> size<00:04:36.300> and<00:04:36.540> order

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
like have any particular size and order

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.770 
like have any particular size and order
like<00:04:36.900> these<00:04:37.080> to<00:04:37.290> line<00:04:37.680> up<00:04:37.890> but<00:04:38.880> then<00:04:39.420> not<00:04:39.660> the

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
like these to line up but then not the

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.510 
like these to line up but then not the
right<00:04:39.960> size<00:04:40.200> these<00:04:40.770> two<00:04:41.040> are<00:04:41.070> not<00:04:41.280> the<00:04:41.400> right

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
right size these two are not the right

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.040 
right size these two are not the right
size<00:04:41.730> these<00:04:42.180> two<00:04:42.390> are<00:04:42.420> not<00:04:42.600> the<00:04:42.720> right<00:04:42.870> size

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
size these two are not the right size

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:44.840 
size these two are not the right size
things<00:04:43.380> are<00:04:43.650> fairly<00:04:43.830> closely<00:04:44.250> is<00:04:44.490> a<00:04:44.610> fairly

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:44.850 
things are fairly closely is a fairly

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:47.720 
things are fairly closely is a fairly
close<00:04:45.180> and<00:04:45.420> then<00:04:45.480> it<00:04:45.630> goes<00:04:45.780> off<00:04:46.050> again<00:04:46.520> but<00:04:47.520> I

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:47.730 
close and then it goes off again but I

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:49.070 
close and then it goes off again but I
guess<00:04:48.030> that's<00:04:48.060> because<00:04:48.390> of<00:04:48.570> the<00:04:48.690> way<00:04:48.870> the

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
guess that's because of the way the

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.250 
guess that's because of the way the
figure<00:04:49.440> is<00:04:49.560> shaped<00:04:49.890> which<00:04:50.130> is<00:04:50.310> this<00:04:50.580> curved

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:51.260 
figure is shaped which is this curved

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:56.450 
figure is shaped which is this curved
fashion<00:04:52.260> and<00:04:53.220> of<00:04:53.580> course<00:04:53.940> is<00:04:54.260> weird<00:04:55.460> peculiar

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
fashion and of course is weird peculiar

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.240 
fashion and of course is weird peculiar
tail<00:04:56.730> which<00:04:57.000> you<00:04:57.150> can<00:04:57.360> you<00:04:57.990> know<00:04:58.140> look<00:04:58.980> at<00:04:59.130> that

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
tail which you can you know look at that

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.850 
tail which you can you know look at that
how<00:04:59.400> you<00:04:59.460> like<00:04:59.820> and<00:05:00.720> again<00:05:01.020> his<00:05:01.260> legs<00:05:01.620> are

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
how you like and again his legs are

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.760 
how you like and again his legs are
formed<00:05:02.490> much<00:05:02.790> like<00:05:03.150> a<00:05:03.450> sling<00:05:04.050> swirl<00:05:04.470> which

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
formed much like a sling swirl which

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:07.060 
formed much like a sling swirl which
would<00:05:04.980> these<00:05:05.310> little<00:05:05.610> lines<00:05:05.820> and<00:05:06.150> stuff<00:05:06.240> pong

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.070 
would these little lines and stuff pong

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:10.040 
would these little lines and stuff pong
but<00:05:08.070> it's<00:05:08.280> a<00:05:08.370> lot<00:05:08.520> more<00:05:08.580> consistent<00:05:09.390> for<00:05:09.900> this

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.050 
but it's a lot more consistent for this

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.430 
but it's a lot more consistent for this
kind<00:05:10.320> of<00:05:10.470> figure<00:05:11.070> because<00:05:11.810> like<00:05:12.810> his<00:05:12.990> back<00:05:13.260> in

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 
kind of figure because like his back in

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.080 
kind of figure because like his back in
his<00:05:13.560> face<00:05:13.590> kind<00:05:14.160> of<00:05:14.250> have<00:05:14.430> these<00:05:14.550> little<00:05:14.790> lines

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.090 
his face kind of have these little lines

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:19.160 
his face kind of have these little lines
as<00:05:15.360> well<00:05:15.510> so<00:05:16.010> yeah<00:05:17.390> that's<00:05:18.390> as<00:05:18.630> much<00:05:18.810> as<00:05:18.870> I<00:05:19.110> can

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:19.170 
as well so yeah that's as much as I can

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:21.380 
as well so yeah that's as much as I can
think<00:05:19.800> about<00:05:19.890> to<00:05:20.160> safer<00:05:20.580> bazooka<00:05:21.030> in<00:05:21.060> this

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:21.390 
think about to safer bazooka in this

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:24.410 
think about to safer bazooka in this
mode<00:05:21.630> so<00:05:22.470> I'll<00:05:22.770> wait<00:05:23.190> well<00:05:23.730> now<00:05:23.910> I'll<00:05:24.030> go<00:05:24.210> on<00:05:24.300> to

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:24.420 
mode so I'll wait well now I'll go on to

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:26.210 
mode so I'll wait well now I'll go on to
the<00:05:24.540> the<00:05:24.900> robot<00:05:25.170> mode<00:05:25.380> so<00:05:25.710> I'll<00:05:25.770> see<00:05:26.010> for<00:05:26.190> that

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.220 
the the robot mode so I'll see for that

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.790 
the the robot mode so I'll see for that
in<00:05:26.490> a<00:05:26.640> moment
