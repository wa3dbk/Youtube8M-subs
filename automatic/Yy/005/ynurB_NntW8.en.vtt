00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
experienced this and it's a very simple

experienced this and it's a very simple
tool<00:00:05.930> now<00:00:06.930> when<00:00:07.140> they're<00:00:07.290> installed

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
tool now when they're installed

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.400 
tool now when they're installed
typically<00:00:08.670> they<00:00:08.849> have<00:00:09.030> a<00:00:09.139> something<00:00:10.139> like

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
typically they have a something like

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.959 
typically they have a something like
this<00:00:10.530> that<00:00:10.740> the<00:00:10.889> screw<00:00:11.219> goes<00:00:11.429> into<00:00:11.759> and<00:00:11.910> it

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
this that the screw goes into and it

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.470 
this that the screw goes into and it
holds<00:00:12.240> it<00:00:12.360> in<00:00:12.480> the<00:00:12.509> sheetrock<00:00:13.460> but<00:00:14.460> in<00:00:15.269> this

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
holds it in the sheetrock but in this

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.859 
holds it in the sheetrock but in this
case<00:00:15.809> to<00:00:16.740> fix<00:00:17.039> it<00:00:17.279> all<00:00:17.490> we<00:00:17.730> need<00:00:18.000> to<00:00:18.060> do<00:00:18.330> is<00:00:18.600> pop

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
case to fix it all we need to do is pop

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.859 
case to fix it all we need to do is pop
by<00:00:19.199> some<00:00:19.529> toggle<00:00:20.010> bolts<00:00:20.430> and<00:00:20.689> what<00:00:21.689> they<00:00:21.840> are

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
by some toggle bolts and what they are

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.929 
by some toggle bolts and what they are
going<00:00:22.289> to<00:00:22.710> note<00:00:22.859> that<00:00:22.890> these<00:00:23.310> are<00:00:23.369> available

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
going to note that these are available

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.790 
going to note that these are available
in<00:00:24.029> most<00:00:24.180> hardware<00:00:24.420> stores<00:00:24.869> and<00:00:25.439> they<00:00:25.680> aren't

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
in most hardware stores and they aren't

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.870 
in most hardware stores and they aren't
whispers<00:00:26.310> really<00:00:27.650> it's<00:00:28.650> a<00:00:28.800> very<00:00:28.830> long<00:00:29.310> screw

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
whispers really it's a very long screw

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.479 
whispers really it's a very long screw
and<00:00:31.189> it<00:00:32.189> seats<00:00:32.610> into<00:00:32.940> this<00:00:33.360> piece<00:00:33.660> of<00:00:33.809> metal

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:34.489 
and it seats into this piece of metal

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:36.880 
and it seats into this piece of metal
which<00:00:35.489> is<00:00:35.520> spring-loaded

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
which is spring-loaded

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:42.110 
which is spring-loaded
so<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.879> wall<00:00:39.530> will<00:00:40.530> hold<00:00:40.890> this<00:00:41.430> will<00:00:41.700> hold

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
so the wall will hold this will hold

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.750 
so the wall will hold this will hold
itself<00:00:42.510> against<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:43.110> wall<00:00:43.430> so<00:00:44.430> let's<00:00:44.610> get

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
itself against the wall so let's get

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.380 
itself against the wall so let's get
started<00:00:46.010> now<00:00:47.010> hopefully<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.700> holes<00:00:47.969> in<00:00:48.329> your

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
started now hopefully the holes in your

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.900 
started now hopefully the holes in your
wall<00:00:48.870> are<00:00:49.170> still<00:00:49.559> small<00:00:50.039> enough<00:00:50.070> that<00:00:50.610> you<00:00:50.730> can

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
wall are still small enough that you can

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.450 
wall are still small enough that you can
use<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.510> toggle<00:00:51.930> bolt<00:00:52.140> if<00:00:52.829> you<00:00:53.010> have<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.160> huge

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
use the toggle bolt if you have a huge

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.830 
use the toggle bolt if you have a huge
gaping<00:00:53.699> hole<00:00:54.030> you're<00:00:54.239> going<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.510> have<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.719> do

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
gaping hole you're going to have to do

gaping hole you're going to have to do
it<00:00:54.960> repair<00:00:55.320> on<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.590> sheetrock<00:00:55.860> first<00:00:56.399> I'm<00:00:57.000> not

the shower rod if you have a shower a
towel<00:01:11.210> hanger<00:01:12.619> rod<00:01:13.619> then<00:01:14.130> it<00:01:14.640> will<00:01:14.850> have<00:01:15.090> a

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
towel hanger rod then it will have a

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.679 
towel hanger rod then it will have a
metal<00:01:15.689> plate<00:01:16.820> and<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.909> metal<00:01:18.180> plate<00:01:18.390> just

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
metal plate and the metal plate just

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.890 
metal plate and the metal plate just
fits<00:01:18.960> right<00:01:19.110> inside<00:01:19.680> here<00:01:20.570> and<00:01:21.570> this<00:01:21.689> metal

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
fits right inside here and this metal

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.630 
fits right inside here and this metal
plate<00:01:22.200> is<00:01:22.350> mounted<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:23.009> walls<00:01:23.250> we're

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
plate is mounted to the walls we're

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.609 
plate is mounted to the walls we're
going<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:23.850> go<00:01:23.939> ahead<00:01:24.890> the<00:01:25.890> toggle<00:01:26.369> bolt<00:01:27.619> and

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
going to go ahead the toggle bolt and

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.370 
going to go ahead the toggle bolt and
put<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.490> toggle<00:01:29.970> bolt<00:01:31.220> inside<00:01:32.220> like<00:01:32.520> this<00:01:32.850> and

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
put the toggle bolt inside like this and

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:48.130 
put the toggle bolt inside like this and
then<00:01:34.380> we'll<00:01:34.710> take<00:01:35.210> the<00:01:36.210> nut<00:01:37.369> and<00:01:38.750> thread<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:39.900> on

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.380 

so<00:01:48.740> we're<00:01:49.070> going<00:01:49.220> to<00:01:49.340> thread<00:01:49.760> the<00:01:49.970> bolt<00:01:50.180> on

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
so we're going to thread the bolt on

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.120 
so we're going to thread the bolt on
just<00:01:50.810> a<00:01:50.990> little<00:01:51.260> bit<00:01:51.410> so<00:01:51.680> that<00:01:51.860> there's<00:01:52.040> a

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
just a little bit so that there's a

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.940 
just a little bit so that there's a
little<00:01:52.400> bit<00:01:52.520> leading<00:01:52.970> out<00:01:53.150> of<00:01:53.540> the<00:01:53.750> nut<00:01:53.950> we're

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
little bit leading out of the nut we're

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.040 
little bit leading out of the nut we're
going<00:01:55.160> to<00:01:55.460> stick<00:01:55.790> the<00:01:56.000> whole<00:01:56.180> thing<00:01:56.450> inside

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.050 
going to stick the whole thing inside

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.970 
going to stick the whole thing inside
the<00:01:57.290> wall<00:01:57.500> like<00:01:57.740> this<00:01:57.980> and<00:01:59.530> then<00:02:00.530> you<00:02:00.650> hear<00:02:00.860> it

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:00.980 
the wall like this and then you hear it

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.370 
the wall like this and then you hear it
spring<00:02:01.400> back<00:02:01.670> open<00:02:02.210> and<00:02:02.450> so<00:02:02.600> now<00:02:02.750> it's<00:02:02.930> secured

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
spring back open and so now it's secured

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.280 
spring back open and so now it's secured
now<00:02:03.620> it's<00:02:03.800> just<00:02:03.950> a<00:02:04.100> matter<00:02:04.310> of<00:02:05.050> taking<00:02:06.050> a

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
now it's just a matter of taking a

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
now it's just a matter of taking a
screwdriver<00:02:09.009> and<00:02:10.009> tightening<00:02:10.729> it<00:02:12.010> you<00:02:13.010> can

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
screwdriver and tightening it you can

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.199 
screwdriver and tightening it you can
just<00:02:13.790> take<00:02:14.000> it<00:02:14.180> by<00:02:14.330> hand<00:02:14.660> for<00:02:14.959> a<00:02:15.020> while<00:02:15.220> and<00:02:16.220> you

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
just take it by hand for a while and you

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:21.570 
just take it by hand for a while and you
want<00:02:17.360> to<00:02:17.480> make<00:02:17.600> sure<00:02:17.810> that<00:02:17.900> you're<00:02:18.110> pulling

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.770 

the<00:02:23.170> bolt<00:02:24.580> against<00:02:25.580> the<00:02:25.790> wall<00:02:25.940> as<00:02:26.180> you<00:02:26.209> tighten

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
the bolt against the wall as you tighten

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.030 
the bolt against the wall as you tighten
it<00:02:26.810> otherwise<00:02:27.200> it<00:02:27.440> will<00:02:27.500> just<00:02:27.560> be<00:02:27.830> very

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
it otherwise it will just be very

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:36.460

spinning<00:02:33.130> okay<00:02:34.130> we<00:02:34.400> have<00:02:34.550> that<00:02:34.760> one<00:02:35.320> secure<00:02:36.320> it

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
spinning okay we have that one secure it

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:42.310 
spinning okay we have that one secure it
out<00:02:36.590> a<00:02:36.980> little<00:02:37.880> more<00:02:40.750> okay<00:02:41.750> now<00:02:41.930> we<00:02:41.989> have<00:02:42.110> our

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
out a little more okay now we have our

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:43.930 
out a little more okay now we have our
second<00:02:42.709> one<00:02:42.830> this<00:02:43.010> holds<00:02:43.280> a<00:02:43.310> bit<00:02:43.489> bigger<00:02:43.700> but

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
second one this holds a bit bigger but

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.330 
second one this holds a bit bigger but
it'll<00:02:44.180> still<00:02:44.390> work<00:02:44.420> just<00:02:44.780> fine<00:02:45.020> now<00:02:45.830> you<00:02:46.160> want

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
it'll still work just fine now you want

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.130 
it'll still work just fine now you want
to<00:02:46.400> make<00:02:46.520> sure<00:02:46.790> that<00:02:47.060> this<00:02:47.360> is<00:02:47.600> aligned

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
to make sure that this is aligned

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.350 
to make sure that this is aligned
properly<00:02:48.500> in<00:02:49.280> the<00:02:49.430> right<00:02:49.580> direction<00:02:50.170> to<00:02:51.170> the

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
properly in the right direction to the

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.620 
properly in the right direction to the
to<00:02:53.360> the<00:02:53.480> base<00:02:53.720> so<00:02:54.260> this<00:02:54.620> needs<00:02:54.890> to<00:02:55.010> be<00:02:55.330> this<00:02:56.330> way

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
to the base so this needs to be this way

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.380 
to the base so this needs to be this way
so<00:02:56.959> make<00:02:57.650> sure<00:02:57.680> that<00:02:57.920> the<00:02:58.280> screws<00:02:58.760> where<00:02:59.269> it

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
so make sure that the screws where it

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.590 
so make sure that the screws where it
catches<00:02:59.600> are<00:03:00.560> lined<00:03:01.120> so<00:03:02.120> that<00:03:02.269> you<00:03:02.360> don't<00:03:02.510> have

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
catches are lined so that you don't have

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:10.539 
catches are lined so that you don't have
to<00:03:02.690> rearrange<00:03:03.019> this<00:03:06.489> pop<00:03:07.489> it<00:03:07.670> in<00:03:09.010> okay<00:03:10.010> our

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:10.549 
to rearrange this pop it in okay our

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:13.420 
to rearrange this pop it in okay our
spring<00:03:10.940> back<00:03:11.150> and<00:03:11.860> then<00:03:12.860> it's<00:03:13.100> just<00:03:13.250> a<00:03:13.400> matter

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
spring back and then it's just a matter

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.160 
spring back and then it's just a matter
of<00:03:13.730> tightening

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
of tightening

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.010 
of tightening
okay<00:03:17.160> we<00:03:17.370> have<00:03:17.520> that<00:03:17.730> secured<00:03:18.270> as<00:03:18.420> well<00:03:18.660> and

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
okay we have that secured as well and

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:24.290 
okay we have that secured as well and
string<00:03:19.620> it<00:03:19.800> out<00:03:19.950> of<00:03:20.250> it<00:03:22.730> okay<00:03:23.730> so<00:03:23.820> the<00:03:24.090> next

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
string it out of it okay so the next

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.800 
string it out of it okay so the next
step<00:03:24.630> is<00:03:24.870> to<00:03:25.650> attach<00:03:25.800> this<00:03:26.370> now<00:03:26.640> on<00:03:26.880> the<00:03:27.600> base

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
step is to attach this now on the base

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.720 
step is to attach this now on the base
of<00:03:28.110> this<00:03:28.290> somewhere<00:03:28.830> is<00:03:29.160> going<00:03:29.430> to<00:03:29.580> be<00:03:29.700> a

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
of this somewhere is going to be a

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.510 
of this somewhere is going to be a
little<00:03:29.970> screw<00:03:30.570> and<00:03:30.780> this<00:03:30.870> time<00:03:31.110> is<00:03:31.860> a<00:03:31.890> flathead

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
little screw and this time is a flathead

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.540 
little screw and this time is a flathead
sometimes<00:03:32.970> it's<00:03:33.150> a<00:03:33.270> hex<00:03:33.590> shaped<00:03:34.590> but<00:03:35.340> we've

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
sometimes it's a hex shaped but we've

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.480 
sometimes it's a hex shaped but we've
just<00:03:35.730> got<00:03:36.030> a<00:03:36.060> flat<00:03:36.500> flat<00:03:37.500> head<00:03:37.740> screw<00:03:38.100> that

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:38.490 
just got a flat flat head screw that

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:41.660 
just got a flat flat head screw that
tightens<00:03:39.180> this<00:03:39.620> onto<00:03:40.620> the<00:03:40.740> mounted<00:03:41.130> bracket

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
tightens this onto the mounted bracket

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.130 
tightens this onto the mounted bracket
so<00:03:41.940> we're<00:03:42.090> going<00:03:42.180> to<00:03:42.240> go<00:03:42.510> ahead<00:03:42.570> and<00:03:42.780> put<00:03:42.930> it<00:03:43.020> on

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
so we're going to go ahead and put it on

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.380 
so we're going to go ahead and put it on
and<00:03:43.290> make<00:03:43.410> sure<00:03:43.560> it's<00:03:43.680> a<00:03:43.800> line<00:03:44.070> so<00:03:44.970> I'll<00:03:45.209> put

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
and make sure it's a line so I'll put

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.270 
and make sure it's a line so I'll put
the<00:03:45.510> screw<00:03:45.900> underneath<00:03:46.320> so<00:03:46.800> that<00:03:46.950> you<00:03:47.070> don't

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
the screw underneath so that you don't

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:55.490 
the screw underneath so that you don't
see<00:03:47.580> it<00:03:47.760> so<00:03:47.940> we'll<00:03:48.450> go<00:03:48.570> on<00:03:48.600> this<00:03:48.900> one<00:03:54.440> so<00:03:55.440> I'm

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
see it so we'll go on this one so I'm

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.650 
see it so we'll go on this one so I'm
just<00:03:55.830> loosening<00:03:56.100> it<00:03:56.610> up<00:03:56.760> so<00:03:57.090> that<00:03:57.239> the<00:03:57.390> pin

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
just loosening it up so that the pin

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:08.210 
just loosening it up so that the pin
that<00:03:57.959> holds<00:03:58.110> it<00:03:58.350> in<00:03:58.410> place<00:03:58.880> fit<00:03:59.880> right<00:04:00.150> on<00:04:07.220> okay

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
that holds it in place fit right on okay

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:22.550 
that holds it in place fit right on okay
I<00:04:08.670> got<00:04:09.000> that<00:04:09.300> and<00:04:10.140> now<00:04:10.400> the<00:04:11.400> next<00:04:11.670> one<00:04:21.560> all

I got that and now the next one all
right<00:04:22.880> we<00:04:23.880> go<00:04:24.030> over<00:04:24.390> the<00:04:24.510> top<00:04:24.690> that's<00:04:25.050> how

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
right we go over the top that's how

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.740 
right we go over the top that's how
we're<00:04:25.350> supposed<00:04:25.590> to<00:04:25.710> do<00:04:25.890> it<00:04:26.010> right<00:04:26.419> so<00:04:27.419> anyway
