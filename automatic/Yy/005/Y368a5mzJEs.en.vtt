00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
that I know it's just a scout but it's

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.190 
that I know it's just a scout but it's
just<00:01:43.380> one<00:01:43.530> thing<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.799> think<00:01:44.040> about<00:01:45.020> you<00:01:46.020> can

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
just one thing to think about you can

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.660 
just one thing to think about you can
see<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.500> tire<00:01:46.770> is<00:01:47.130> at<00:01:47.909> least<00:01:48.680> at<00:01:49.680> a<00:01:49.979> little

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
see the tire is at least at a little

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.760 
see the tire is at least at a little
less<00:01:50.820> than<00:01:50.850> an<00:01:51.119> inch<00:01:51.270> right<00:01:51.689> there<00:01:52.560> you<00:01:52.619> can

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
less than an inch right there you can

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.520 
less than an inch right there you can
see<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:52.979> size<00:01:53.159> and<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.460> spare<00:01:54.210> tire<00:01:54.240> is<00:01:54.689> a<00:01:55.140> lot

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:30.710 
size comparison I'll get little clocker
here<00:04:29.340> I<00:04:29.580> know<00:04:29.940> they're<00:04:30.210> not<00:04:30.330> from<00:04:30.450> the<00:04:30.540> same
