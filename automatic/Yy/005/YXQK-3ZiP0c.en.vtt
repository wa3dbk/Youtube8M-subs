00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
the Platinum I just about manage 15 I

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.509 
the Platinum I just about manage 15 I
think<00:00:13.200> this<00:00:13.320> is<00:00:13.469> a<00:00:13.500> difficult<00:00:13.740> one<00:00:14.099> very

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
think this is a difficult one very

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.129 
think this is a difficult one very
difficult<00:00:14.969> skill<00:00:15.089> game<00:00:15.360> still<00:00:15.750> really<00:00:15.960> cool

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
difficult skill game still really cool

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.090 
difficult skill game still really cool
though<00:00:16.289> because<00:00:16.320> it<00:00:16.529> kind<00:00:16.680> of<00:00:16.740> changed<00:00:17.010> all

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
though because it kind of changed all

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.590 
though because it kind of changed all
the<00:00:17.190> time<00:00:17.340> it<00:00:17.460> keeps<00:00:17.609> you<00:00:17.730> guessing<00:00:17.880> it

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
the time it keeps you guessing it

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.970 
the time it keeps you guessing it
actually<00:00:18.990> takes<00:00:19.199> a<00:00:19.289> little<00:00:19.410> more<00:00:19.590> skill<00:00:19.650> than

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
actually takes a little more skill than

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.560 
actually takes a little more skill than
the<00:00:20.070> track<00:00:20.310> would<00:00:20.520> because<00:00:20.850> you<00:00:21.000> just<00:00:21.240> learn

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
the track would because you just learn

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.750 
the track would because you just learn
the<00:00:21.810> track<00:00:22.050> and<00:00:22.650> this<00:00:22.740> keeps<00:00:23.010> changing<00:00:23.279> up<00:00:23.609> so

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
the track and this keeps changing up so

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.009 
the track and this keeps changing up so
it's<00:00:23.910> much<00:00:24.090> difficult<00:00:24.539> to<00:00:24.630> sort<00:00:24.810> of<00:00:24.840> know

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
it's much difficult to sort of know

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.929 
it's much difficult to sort of know
what's<00:00:25.230> coming<00:00:25.529> next<00:00:25.560> but<00:00:26.369> a<00:00:26.430> lot<00:00:26.609> of<00:00:26.699> them<00:00:26.789> are

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
what's coming next but a lot of them are

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.609 
what's coming next but a lot of them are
sort<00:00:27.210> of<00:00:27.300> say<00:00:27.660> me<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:28.050> similar<00:00:28.439> they<00:00:28.560> do

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
sort of say me and similar they do

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.250 
sort of say me and similar they do
change<00:00:28.980> it<00:00:29.099> up<00:00:29.220> a<00:00:29.340> bit<00:00:29.369> but<00:00:29.670> lava<00:00:30.599> is<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:31.050> same

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
change it up a bit but lava is the same

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.780 
change it up a bit but lava is the same
and<00:00:31.500> once<00:00:31.650> you<00:00:31.769> keep<00:00:31.980> replaying<00:00:32.340> them<00:00:32.579> you'll

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
and once you keep replaying them you'll

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.850 
and once you keep replaying them you'll
get<00:00:33.030> used<00:00:33.239> to<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.480> same<00:00:33.690> ones<00:00:33.989> or<00:00:34.530> you've<00:00:34.710> got

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
get used to the same ones or you've got

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.650 
get used to the same ones or you've got
to<00:00:34.950> do<00:00:35.040> to<00:00:35.190> get<00:00:35.309> through<00:00:35.489> stuff<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:36.329> be<00:00:36.420> fair

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
to do to get through stuff to be fair

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.150 
to do to get through stuff to be fair
the<00:00:36.870> levels<00:00:37.200> aren't<00:00:37.440> actually<00:00:37.739> that<00:00:37.770> hard

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
the levels aren't actually that hard

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.590 
the levels aren't actually that hard
they're<00:00:38.520> not<00:00:38.700> really<00:00:38.879> that<00:00:39.059> difficult<00:00:39.239> but

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
they're not really that difficult but

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.500 
they're not really that difficult but
they<00:00:39.690> can<00:00:39.840> just<00:00:39.960> catch<00:00:40.140> you<00:00:40.350> out<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:40.879> you<00:00:41.879> get

I tried to work it out through the
challenges<00:00:50.219> try<00:00:50.399> and<00:00:50.489> lose<00:00:50.610> one<00:00:50.879> life<00:00:50.910> for

can<00:00:55.559> get<00:00:55.680> your<00:00:55.770> platinum<00:00:56.039> I<00:00:56.280> didn't<00:00:56.940> get<00:00:57.059> any

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
can get your platinum I didn't get any

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.490 
can get your platinum I didn't get any
further<00:00:57.329> than<00:00:57.570> that<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:57.960> I<00:00:58.020> think<00:00:58.050> it<00:00:58.350> was

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
further than that and I think it was

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.099 
further than that and I think it was
still<00:00:58.829> not<00:00:59.219> so<00:00:59.460> bad<00:00:59.640> on<00:00:59.820> the<00:00:59.910> leaderboards<00:01:00.480> so

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
still not so bad on the leaderboards so

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.389 
still not so bad on the leaderboards so
I<00:01:01.170> think<00:01:01.230> people<00:01:01.440> are<00:01:01.710> struggling<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.190> do<00:01:02.280> this

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
I think people are struggling to do this

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.429 
I think people are struggling to do this
one<00:01:02.579> a<00:01:02.609> little<00:01:02.820> bit<00:01:02.969> it<00:01:03.090> is<00:01:03.239> difficult<00:01:03.690> but<00:01:04.379> I

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
one a little bit it is difficult but I

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.710 
one a little bit it is difficult but I
enjoy<00:01:04.769> it's<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.610> lot<00:01:05.970> of<00:01:06.000> fun<00:01:06.240> it's<00:01:06.390> also<00:01:06.510> the

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
that's it man well halfway through now 7

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.850 
that's it man well halfway through now 7
to<00:01:24.210> get<00:01:24.360> that<00:01:24.509> one<00:01:24.630> done<00:01:24.780> four<00:01:25.020> ain't<00:01:25.170> got<00:01:25.710> one

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
to get that one done four ain't got one

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.700 
to get that one done four ain't got one
life<00:01:26.070> left<00:01:26.189> actually<00:01:26.729> so<00:01:27.439> must<00:01:28.439> have<00:01:28.560> done

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
life left actually so must have done

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.230 
life left actually so must have done
well<00:01:28.890> on<00:01:29.009> my<00:01:29.100> last<00:01:29.310> couple<00:01:29.549> of<00:01:29.729> lives<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.150> got

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
well on my last couple of lives and got

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.580 
well on my last couple of lives and got
quite<00:01:30.360> far<00:01:30.659> with<00:01:30.840> them<00:01:30.960> I<00:01:31.140> probably<00:01:31.380> could

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
quite far with them I probably could

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.140 
quite far with them I probably could
have<00:01:31.619> done<00:01:31.710> better<00:01:32.009> if<00:01:32.250> I<00:01:32.369> if<00:01:32.640> I<00:01:32.759> kept<00:01:33.000> playing

you guys there's not really much I can
help<00:01:39.390> guide<00:01:39.570> you<00:01:39.630> through<00:01:39.810> on<00:01:40.079> this<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:40.439> just

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
sort of show you my run I know some of

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:43.760 
sort of show you my run I know some of
you<00:01:42.600> like<00:01:42.780> seeing<00:01:43.049> this<00:01:43.170> stuff<00:01:43.409> and<00:01:43.500> a<00:01:43.560> lot<00:01:43.710> of

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
you like seeing this stuff and a lot of

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.109 
you like seeing this stuff and a lot of
you've<00:01:43.920> asked<00:01:44.130> me<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.280> finish<00:01:44.460> this<00:01:44.640> series<00:01:44.880> up

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
you've asked me to finish this series up

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.270 
you've asked me to finish this series up
so<00:01:45.329> I'm<00:01:45.450> gonna<00:01:45.570> do<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:45.840> all<00:01:46.049> that<00:01:47.040> good

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
so I'm gonna do it all that good

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.929 
so I'm gonna do it all that good
malarkey<00:01:47.990> just<00:01:48.990> keep<00:01:49.170> what<00:01:49.320> we<00:01:49.409> are<00:01:49.500> now<00:01:49.680> 9<00:01:49.950> so

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
malarkey just keep what we are now 9 so

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.310 
malarkey just keep what we are now 9 so
I<00:01:50.970> think<00:01:51.060> it<00:01:51.299> gets<00:01:51.479> progressively<00:01:51.659> harder

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
I think it gets progressively harder

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.980 
I think it gets progressively harder
each<00:01:52.619> 5<00:01:52.890> stages<00:01:53.189> as<00:01:53.460> well<00:01:53.659> like<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.750> first

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
each 5 stages as well like the first

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.600 
each 5 stages as well like the first
five<00:01:55.200> are<00:01:55.380> quite<00:01:55.530> simple<00:01:55.979> and<00:01:56.280> then<00:01:56.490> you've

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
five are quite simple and then you've

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.340 
five are quite simple and then you've
got<00:01:56.640> 5<00:01:57.030> to<00:01:57.180> 10<00:01:57.390> or<00:01:57.509> a<00:01:57.570> little<00:01:57.719> bit<00:01:57.810> harder<00:01:58.079> from

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
got 5 to 10 or a little bit harder from

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.410 
got 5 to 10 or a little bit harder from
10<00:01:58.560> to<00:01:58.649> 15<00:01:58.979> they're<00:01:59.549> quite<00:01:59.729> hard<00:01:59.909> as<00:02:00.030> well<00:02:00.210> but

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
10 to 15 they're quite hard as well but

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.020 
10 to 15 they're quite hard as well but
some<00:02:00.600> of<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.750> top<00:02:01.140> guys<00:02:01.409> on<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:02.579> leaderboard

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
some of the top guys on the leaderboard

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.270 
some of the top guys on the leaderboard
again<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:03.570> like<00:02:03.689> level<00:02:03.930> 60s<00:02:04.439> and<00:02:04.680> 70s<00:02:04.860> and

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
again to like level 60s and 70s and

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.340 
again to like level 60s and 70s and
stuff<00:02:05.460> probably<00:02:05.670> higher<00:02:06.000> than<00:02:06.299> that<00:02:06.450> and<00:02:07.229> I

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
stuff probably higher than that and I

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.080 
stuff probably higher than that and I
guess<00:02:07.619> by<00:02:07.829> then<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.160> tracks<00:02:08.489> must<00:02:08.729> be<00:02:08.879> just

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
guess by then the tracks must be just

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.999 
guess by then the tracks must be just
getting<00:02:09.149> ridiculously<00:02:09.840> hard<00:02:10.110> to<00:02:10.319> get<00:02:10.470> for<00:02:10.709> I

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
getting ridiculously hard to get for I

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.180 
getting ridiculously hard to get for I
don't<00:02:11.459> either

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
don't either

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.670 
don't either
but<00:02:12.610> let's<00:02:12.940> keep<00:02:13.330> going<00:02:13.690> on<00:02:13.780> here<00:02:14.050> we<00:02:14.320> are<00:02:14.470> now

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
but let's keep going on here we are now

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.710 
but let's keep going on here we are now
11<00:02:14.950> I<00:02:15.250> still<00:02:15.850> only<00:02:15.940> got<00:02:16.120> that<00:02:16.180> one<00:02:16.330> life<00:02:16.480> all

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
11 I still only got that one life all

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.570 
11 I still only got that one life all
there<00:02:16.900> it<00:02:16.990> goes<00:02:17.200> I<00:02:17.500> guess<00:02:18.220> to<00:02:18.340> get<00:02:18.430> through

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
there it goes I guess to get through

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.150 
there it goes I guess to get through
these<00:02:18.730> last<00:02:18.910> four<00:02:19.120> on<00:02:19.240> my<00:02:19.330> last<00:02:19.510> life<00:02:19.690> then<00:02:20.160> we

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
these last four on my last life then we

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.200 
these last four on my last life then we
as<00:02:21.280> I<00:02:21.310> said<00:02:21.580> they're<00:02:21.730> really<00:02:21.850> not

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.210 
as I said they're really not

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.120 
as I said they're really not
ridiculously<00:02:23.110> difficult<00:02:23.350> but<00:02:23.800> they<00:02:23.920> can

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
ridiculously difficult but they can

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.980 
ridiculously difficult but they can
catch<00:02:24.370> you<00:02:24.550> out<00:02:24.700> and<00:02:25.450> you've<00:02:25.570> only<00:02:25.660> all<00:02:25.900> those

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
catch you out and you've only all those

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.470 
catch you out and you've only all those
three<00:02:26.350> fails<00:02:26.620> so<00:02:27.430> I'll<00:02:27.520> go<00:02:27.610> get<00:02:27.760> through<00:02:28.000> three

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
three fails so I'll go get through three

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.960 
three fails so I'll go get through three
more<00:02:28.860> hopefully<00:02:29.860> it<00:02:30.010> blesses<00:02:30.520> me<00:02:30.670> with<00:02:30.700> some

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
easy ones you can get lucky like that

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.290 
easy ones you can get lucky like that
