that all this money was created by

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:33.750 
that all this money was created by
pushing<00:02:32.260> a<00:02:32.410> few<00:02:32.650> buttons<00:02:32.920> and<00:02:33.310> a<00:02:33.370> computer

system I think we can all agree that

system I think we can all agree that
something<00:02:38.380> is<00:02:38.650> badly<00:02:38.920> amiss

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.180 

the<00:02:47.120> basic<00:02:47.510> point<00:02:47.690> of<00:02:48.020> the<00:02:48.200> basic<00:02:48.560> case<00:02:48.950> for

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
the basic point of the basic case for

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.400 
the basic point of the basic case for
gold<00:02:49.370> is<00:02:49.550> that<00:02:49.730> it<00:02:49.880> supposedly<00:02:50.750> provides<00:02:51.260> us

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
gold is that it supposedly provides us

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.230 
gold is that it supposedly provides us
with<00:02:51.440> a<00:02:51.620> stable<00:02:51.950> supply<00:02:52.400> of<00:02:52.640> money<00:02:55.090> and<00:02:56.090> the

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:56.240 
with a stable supply of money and the

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.200 
with a stable supply of money and the
problem<00:02:56.540> is<00:02:57.400> the<00:02:58.400> gold<00:02:58.580> standards<00:02:59.000> of<00:02:59.120> the

00:02:59.200 --> 00:02:59.210 
problem is the gold standards of the

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:01.270 
problem is the gold standards of the
past<00:02:59.450> I've<00:02:59.690> seen<00:02:59.720> massive<00:03:00.200> asset<00:03:00.680> bubbles<00:03:01.040> and

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
past I've seen massive asset bubbles and

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.240 
past I've seen massive asset bubbles and
massive<00:03:01.640> deflationary<00:03:02.420> busts<00:03:02.990> and<00:03:03.250> they're

massive deflationary busts and they're

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.190 
massive deflationary busts and they're
it<00:03:04.400> because<00:03:05.180> of<00:03:05.330> this<00:03:05.420> is<00:03:05.720> quite<00:03:05.990> well<00:03:06.170> known

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
it because of this is quite well known

it because of this is quite well known
all<00:03:07.070> the<00:03:07.460> goal<00:03:07.670> is<00:03:07.910> in<00:03:08.030> the<00:03:08.120> hands<00:03:08.420> of<00:03:08.480> very<00:03:08.690> few

all the goal is in the hands of very few

all the goal is in the hands of very few
people<00:03:09.320> these<00:03:10.280> people<00:03:10.610> are<00:03:10.700> called<00:03:10.880> the

people these people are called the

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.810 
people these people are called the
international<00:03:11.720> bankers<00:03:12.140> the<00:03:13.070> Rothschilds

and the wild Berg's and all these

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.780 
and the wild Berg's and all these
criminals<00:03:16.960> so<00:03:17.960> if<00:03:18.440> you<00:03:18.590> control<00:03:19.010> the<00:03:19.280> gold<00:03:19.520> you

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
criminals so if you control the gold you

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.630 
criminals so if you control the gold you
can<00:03:19.820> flow<00:03:20.570> flood<00:03:20.930> the<00:03:21.050> market<00:03:21.230> with<00:03:21.490> what's<00:03:22.490> in

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
can flow flood the market with what's in

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.450 
can flow flood the market with what's in
your<00:03:22.820> vaults<00:03:23.360> and<00:03:23.920> lend<00:03:24.920> it<00:03:25.010> out<00:03:25.130> at<00:03:25.310> interest

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:25.460 
your vaults and lend it out at interest

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:28.240 
your vaults and lend it out at interest
and<00:03:26.150> then<00:03:26.390> you<00:03:27.230> can<00:03:27.590> easily<00:03:27.920> create<00:03:28.160> a

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
and then you can easily create a

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.950 
and then you can easily create a
deflationary<00:03:28.820> bust<00:03:29.240> by<00:03:29.450> calling<00:03:29.810> in<00:03:29.930> the

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:29.960 
deflationary bust by calling in the

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:33.190 
deflationary bust by calling in the
loans<00:03:30.230> or<00:03:30.650> stop<00:03:30.980> landing<00:03:31.160> and<00:03:31.930> this<00:03:32.930> is<00:03:33.080> what

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
loans or stop landing and this is what

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.340 
loans or stop landing and this is what
has<00:03:33.290> been<00:03:33.440> going<00:03:33.590> on<00:03:33.830> for<00:03:33.890> centuries<00:03:34.250> and

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
has been going on for centuries and

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.230 
has been going on for centuries and
doesn't<00:03:36.350> matter<00:03:36.500> if<00:03:36.680> the<00:03:36.860> year<00:03:37.190> of<00:03:37.910> the<00:03:37.970> means

if you control its supply you will be

if you control its supply you will be

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
able to create a boom-bust cycle so gold

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.350 
able to create a boom-bust cycle so gold
will<00:03:47.840> absolutely<00:03:48.260> not<00:03:48.560> solve<00:03:49.190> this<00:03:49.430> it's

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
will absolutely not solve this it's

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:51.699 
will absolutely not solve this it's
strange<00:03:50.690> that<00:03:50.900> people<00:03:51.110> you've<00:03:51.350> considered

last decade we have we have known about

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.530 
last decade we have we have known about

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:39.140 
basically long before then at interest

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:40.870 
basically long before then at interest
and<00:04:39.560> they<00:04:40.070> have<00:04:40.190> been<00:04:40.250> controlled

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 
and they have been controlled

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.550 
and they have been controlled
controlling<00:04:41.540> gold<00:04:41.780> market<00:04:42.169> and<00:04:42.290> the<00:04:42.350> flow<00:04:42.530> of

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.370 
controlling gold market and the flow of
gold<00:04:42.950> ever<00:04:43.550> since<00:04:43.820> then<00:04:44.120> and<00:04:44.419> it's<00:04:45.169> absolutely

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380 
gold ever since then and it's absolutely

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.370 
gold ever since then and it's absolutely
certain<00:04:46.100> that<00:04:46.130> they<00:04:46.370> never<00:04:46.580> relinquished<00:04:47.540> the

certain that they never relinquished the

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.270 
certain that they never relinquished the

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.600 

and<00:04:53.000> the<00:04:53.600> problem<00:04:53.780> is<00:04:54.080> so<00:04:54.980> so<00:04:55.160> the<00:04:55.250> problem<00:04:55.460> is

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.610 
and the problem is so so the problem is

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:57.310 
and the problem is so so the problem is
gold<00:04:55.910> is<00:04:56.060> absolutely<00:04:56.480> worthless<00:04:56.720> as<00:04:57.050> a<00:04:57.080> means

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:57.320 
gold is absolutely worthless as a means

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.890 
gold is absolutely worthless as a means
of<00:04:57.410> exchange<00:04:57.650> it<00:04:58.460> is<00:04:58.580> interests<00:04:58.940> bearing<00:04:59.420> the

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:04.570 
boom-bust cycle will not be stopped
whereas<00:05:03.410> we<00:05:03.530> could<00:05:03.710> have<00:05:03.919> interest-free

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:04.580

fractional reserve banking that we have

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:21.010 
fractional reserve banking that we have
now<00:05:18.740> and<00:05:19.040> that<00:05:19.970> the<00:05:20.060> money<00:05:20.240> power<00:05:20.540> the<00:05:20.750> people

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 
now and that the money power the people

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.040 
now and that the money power the people

of<00:05:26.120> reasons<00:05:31.210> what<00:05:32.210> we<00:05:32.360> really<00:05:32.690> need<00:05:32.720> is

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:32.930 
of reasons what we really need is

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:35.380 
of reasons what we really need is
interest-free<00:05:33.710> credit<00:05:34.010> based<00:05:34.340> currencies<00:05:35.030> we

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:35.390 
interest-free credit based currencies we

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:37.030 
interest-free credit based currencies we
have<00:05:35.540> now<00:05:35.720> a<00:05:35.750> banking<00:05:36.169> system<00:05:36.500> that<00:05:36.620> plays<00:05:36.740> all

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:37.040 
have now a banking system that plays all

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.159 
have now a banking system that plays all
the<00:05:37.160> money<00:05:37.340> out<00:05:37.850> of<00:05:37.880> thin<00:05:38.180> air<00:05:38.240> and<00:05:38.660> this<00:05:38.960> is

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:39.169 
the money out of thin air and this is

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:41.950 
the money out of thin air and this is
not<00:05:39.860> a<00:05:40.160> crime<00:05:40.970> yeah<00:05:41.330> well<00:05:41.450> it<00:05:41.540> is<00:05:41.660> a<00:05:41.690> crime

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:41.960 
not a crime yeah well it is a crime

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.300 
not a crime yeah well it is a crime
because<00:05:42.350> they<00:05:42.500> could<00:05:42.680> be<00:05:42.770> charges<00:05:43.160> with

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:43.310 
because they could be charges with

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:45.490 
because they could be charges with
interest<00:05:43.669> for<00:05:43.910> it<00:05:44.030> but<00:05:44.840> it<00:05:44.870> is<00:05:45.050> basically<00:05:45.470> a

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:45.500 
interest for it but it is basically a

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.350 
interest for it but it is basically a
good<00:05:45.740> invention<00:05:46.010> it's<00:05:46.550> good<00:05:46.820> to<00:05:46.850> know<00:05:47.120> that

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:47.360 
good invention it's good to know that

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.510 
good invention it's good to know that
such<00:05:47.660> a<00:05:47.690> crucial<00:05:48.020> commodity<00:05:48.890> as<00:05:49.070> money<00:05:49.310> she

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:49.520 
such a crucial commodity as money she

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.000 
such a crucial commodity as money she
would<00:05:49.880> never<00:05:50.030> have<00:05:50.240> to<00:05:50.389> be<00:05:50.479> scarce<00:05:50.840> and<00:05:51.139> that

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:52.010 
would never have to be scarce and that

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:53.770 
would never have to be scarce and that
it<00:05:52.100> would<00:05:52.190> be<00:05:52.340> able<00:05:52.639> that<00:05:52.790> we<00:05:53.000> are<00:05:53.419> able<00:05:53.630> to

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:53.780 
it would be able that we are able to

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:57.010 
it would be able that we are able to
create<00:05:53.960> it<00:05:54.290> and<00:05:54.410> virtually<00:05:54.800> no<00:05:54.950> cost<00:05:56.020> the

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:57.020 
create it and virtually no cost the

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.620 
create it and virtually no cost the
future<00:05:57.380> is<00:05:57.530> interest-free<00:05:58.419> mortgages<00:05:59.419> so

00:05:59.620 --> 00:05:59.630 
future is interest-free mortgages so

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:03.159 
future is interest-free mortgages so
