several times in order for them to work

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:12.400 
several times in order for them to work
well<00:00:11.150> the<00:00:11.269> problem<00:00:11.599> could<00:00:11.750> be<00:00:11.809> the<00:00:12.019> with<00:00:12.290> the

clips so using the squad of the
screwdriver<00:01:39.900> you<00:01:40.229> can<00:01:40.520> remove<00:01:41.520> those<00:01:41.759> clips

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
screwdriver you can remove those clips

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.700 
screwdriver you can remove those clips
not<00:01:42.329> actually<00:01:42.659> remove<00:01:42.990> them<00:01:43.200> but<00:01:43.320> remove

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.120 

get<00:02:04.460> the<00:02:04.610> new<00:02:04.790> battery<00:02:05.240> and<00:02:05.920> snap<00:02:06.920> it<00:02:07.100> back

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
get the new battery and snap it back

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.150 
get the new battery and snap it back
into<00:02:07.760> the<00:02:07.970> position<00:02:08.149> of<00:02:08.690> the<00:02:08.869> old<00:02:09.050> one<00:02:09.320> now

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
into the position of the old one now

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.910 
into the position of the old one now
notice<00:02:10.850> that<00:02:10.880> it'll<00:02:11.780> tell<00:02:12.110> you<00:02:12.320> on<00:02:12.530> the<00:02:12.710> case

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
notice that it'll tell you on the case

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.100 
notice that it'll tell you on the case
that<00:02:13.280> the<00:02:13.370> plus<00:02:13.640> side<00:02:13.940> is<00:02:14.270> probably<00:02:14.570> going<00:02:14.990> to

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
that the plus side is probably going to

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.530 
that the plus side is probably going to
go<00:02:15.380> down<00:02:15.650> but<00:02:16.040> yours<00:02:16.400> may<00:02:16.580> be<00:02:16.610> different<00:02:17.120> and

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
go down but yours may be different and

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:18.850 
go down but yours may be different and
make<00:02:17.720> sure<00:02:17.870> you<00:02:18.020> put<00:02:18.230> the<00:02:18.380> correct<00:02:18.620> polarity

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
make sure you put the correct polarity

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.560 
make sure you put the correct polarity
put<00:02:19.460> it<00:02:19.550> in<00:02:19.640> with<00:02:19.760> a<00:02:19.790> collect<00:02:20.120> correct

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
put it in with a collect correct

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.820 
put it in with a collect correct
polarity<00:02:21.370> don't<00:02:22.390> reverse<00:02:23.390> it<00:02:23.630> and<00:02:23.810> now<00:02:24.770> you

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
polarity don't reverse it and now you

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.830 
polarity don't reverse it and now you
may<00:02:25.280> have<00:02:25.520> to<00:02:25.730> slide<00:02:26.150> it<00:02:26.390> into<00:02:26.570> position

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
may have to slide it into position

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.870 
may have to slide it into position
rather<00:02:27.380> than<00:02:27.560> snap<00:02:27.980> it<00:02:28.190> because<00:02:28.550> there's<00:02:28.760> two

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
rather than snap it because there's two

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.370 
rather than snap it because there's two
little<00:02:29.060> prongs<00:02:29.420> that<00:02:29.720> have<00:02:29.840> to<00:02:29.990> connect<00:02:30.320> to

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
little prongs that have to connect to

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.199 
little prongs that have to connect to
the<00:02:30.500> side<00:02:30.709> of<00:02:30.890> the<00:02:30.950> battery<00:02:31.130> so<00:02:31.880> if<00:02:32.000> you<00:02:32.090> have

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
the side of the battery so if you have

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.090 
the side of the battery so if you have
to<00:02:32.360> slide<00:02:32.630> it<00:02:32.660> in<00:02:32.870> sideways<00:02:33.170> in<00:02:33.590> order<00:02:33.770> to<00:02:33.860> snap

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
to slide it in sideways in order to snap

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.830 
to slide it in sideways in order to snap
into<00:02:34.340> position<00:02:34.520> that's<00:02:35.209> okay

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
into position that's okay

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.120 
into position that's okay
now<00:02:37.570> replace<00:02:38.570> the<00:02:38.870> housing<00:02:39.530> that<00:02:39.709> contains

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
now replace the housing that contains

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.520 
now replace the housing that contains
the<00:02:40.280> electronics<00:02:40.940> snap<00:02:41.870> the<00:02:42.050> little<00:02:42.260> Clips

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
the electronics snap the little Clips

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.310 
the electronics snap the little Clips
back<00:02:42.830> into<00:02:43.160> place<00:02:43.630> check<00:02:44.630> it<00:02:44.780> out<00:02:44.930> make<00:02:45.200> sure

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
back into place check it out make sure

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.110 
back into place check it out make sure
it<00:02:45.470> works<00:02:45.680> before<00:02:45.860> you<00:02:46.220> put<00:02:46.459> the<00:02:46.640> whole<00:02:46.850> key

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
it works before you put the whole key

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.940 
it works before you put the whole key
back<00:02:47.330> together<00:02:47.540> again<00:02:47.900> the<00:02:48.230> little<00:02:48.470> light<00:02:48.709> the

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
back together again the little light the

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.410 
back together again the little light the
little<00:02:49.190> diode<00:02:49.580> will<00:02:49.850> tell<00:02:50.060> you<00:02:50.180> that<00:02:50.270> it's

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
little diode will tell you that it's

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.920 
little diode will tell you that it's
working<00:02:50.630> correctly<00:02:51.160> put<00:02:52.160> it<00:02:52.280> back<00:02:52.459> in<00:02:52.670> the<00:02:52.930> key

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
working correctly put it back in the key

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.570 
working correctly put it back in the key
housing<00:02:54.440> snap<00:02:55.430> the<00:02:55.670> cover<00:02:55.820> on

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.920 

replace<00:02:59.450> the<00:02:59.690> screw

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.679 

and<00:03:03.019> you're<00:03:03.709> in<00:03:03.859> business<00:03:04.180> you've<00:03:05.180> replaced

00:03:05.679 --> 00:03:05.689 
and you're in business you've replaced

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:07.630 
and you're in business you've replaced
the<00:03:05.870> battery<00:03:06.349> in<00:03:06.590> the<00:03:06.620> remote<00:03:06.739> and<00:03:07.250> now<00:03:07.579> the

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
the battery in the remote and now the

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.000 
the battery in the remote and now the
locks<00:03:08.060> assuming<00:03:09.019> that<00:03:09.200> they<00:03:09.349> themselves<00:03:09.560> are

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
locks assuming that they themselves are

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:11.979 
locks assuming that they themselves are
not<00:03:10.069> broken<00:03:10.430> should<00:03:11.150> work<00:03:11.359> just<00:03:11.390> fine

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
not broken should work just fine

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:14.229 
not broken should work just fine
and<00:03:12.260> of<00:03:12.769> course<00:03:13.010> we'll<00:03:13.219> check<00:03:13.459> it<00:03:13.609> again<00:03:13.670> once

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
and of course we'll check it again once

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.059 
and of course we'll check it again once
we<00:03:14.390> have<00:03:14.540> it<00:03:14.689> all<00:03:14.780> completed<00:03:15.200> to<00:03:15.739> make<00:03:15.920> sure

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:16.069 
we have it all completed to make sure

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:18.390 
we have it all completed to make sure
that<00:03:16.310> it's<00:03:16.519> in<00:03:16.730> proper<00:03:17.269> working<00:03:17.420> order

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
that it's in proper working order

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.699 
that it's in proper working order
so<00:03:19.400> there<00:03:19.639> you<00:03:19.790> go<00:03:19.989> maybe<00:03:20.989> that<00:03:21.230> will<00:03:21.379> cure

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
so there you go maybe that will cure

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:32.200 
so there you go maybe that will cure
your<00:03:21.980> remote<00:03:22.370> lock<00:03:22.639> problem<00:03:23.000> good<00:03:23.780> luck

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:32.210 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:34.270 

you
