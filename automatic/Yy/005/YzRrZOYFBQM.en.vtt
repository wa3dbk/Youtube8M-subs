00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
we're just pretty much going to be a

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:50.020 
we're just pretty much going to be a
chance<00:00:11.940> to<00:00:12.090> the<00:00:12.150> finals<00:00:12.510> cover

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.270 

so<00:00:50.629> I<00:00:50.690> expected<00:00:51.320> to<00:00:51.379> see<00:00:51.469> a<00:00:51.500> similar<00:00:51.890> opener

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
so I expected to see a similar opener

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.180 
so I expected to see a similar opener
from<00:00:52.489> Stefano<00:00:53.260> pretty<00:00:54.260> similar<00:00:54.680> opener<00:00:55.010> from

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
from Stefano pretty similar opener from

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:56.889 
from Stefano pretty similar opener from
Sauk<00:00:55.460> so<00:00:55.760> sokka's<00:00:56.180> probably<00:00:56.510> going<00:00:56.690> to<00:00:56.750> come

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899 
Sauk so sokka's probably going to come

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:04.660 
Sauk so sokka's probably going to come
into<00:00:57.050> things<00:00:57.550> his<00:00:58.550> expansion<00:00:58.969> again

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.760 

the<00:01:05.299> final<00:01:05.570> will<00:01:05.689> probably<00:01:06.049> go<00:01:06.200> for<00:01:06.380> seeing<00:01:06.650> us

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
the final will probably go for seeing us

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:21.840 
the final will probably go for seeing us
for<00:01:07.009> example<00:01:07.369> again

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.959 

he's<00:01:22.850> not<00:01:23.649> gases<00:01:24.649> go<00:01:24.799> into<00:01:25.009> 15<00:01:25.460> so<00:01:25.700> he<00:01:25.820> might

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:25.969 
he's not gases go into 15 so he might

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:29.440 
he's not gases go into 15 so he might
try<00:01:26.299> to<00:01:26.329> 50<00:01:26.780> hatch<00:01:27.280> but<00:01:28.280> a<00:01:28.340> sock<00:01:28.819> is<00:01:29.030> probably

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
try to 50 hatch but a sock is probably

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.779 
try to 50 hatch but a sock is probably
going<00:01:29.600> to<00:01:29.659> block<00:01:29.899> his<00:01:30.079> with<00:01:30.289> the<00:01:30.469> edge<00:01:30.679> i<00:01:31.159> would

00:01:31.779 --> 00:01:31.789 
going to block his with the edge i would

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:35.740 
going to block his with the edge i would
guess<00:01:32.060> yeah<00:01:32.479> there<00:01:32.780> it<00:01:32.899> is<00:01:33.020> oh<00:01:34.090> so<00:01:35.090> he<00:01:35.209> went<00:01:35.329> 15

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
guess yeah there it is oh so he went 15

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:36.969 
guess yeah there it is oh so he went 15
pool<00:01:35.929> okay<00:01:36.200> this<00:01:36.350> is<00:01:36.469> what<00:01:36.590> I<00:01:36.619> was<00:01:36.770> talking

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
pool okay this is what I was talking

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:39.880 
pool okay this is what I was talking
about<00:01:37.250> this<00:01:37.520> is<00:01:37.640> what<00:01:37.729> i<00:01:37.759> usually<00:01:37.969> do<00:01:38.439> when<00:01:39.439> I'm

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890

about this is what i usually do when I'm
denied<00:01:40.310> of<00:01:40.429> my<00:01:40.610> 15<00:01:41.569> catch<00:01:41.810> just<00:01:42.350> go<00:01:42.469> like<00:01:42.649> with

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
denied of my 15 catch just go like with

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.550 
denied of my 15 catch just go like with
people<00:01:43.039> a<00:01:43.310> little<00:01:43.549> later<00:01:43.880> yes<00:01:44.380> so<00:01:45.380> I<00:01:45.409> think

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
people a little later yes so I think

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.410 
people a little later yes so I think
it's<00:01:45.829> open<00:01:46.130> our<00:01:46.220> last<00:01:46.399> game<00:01:46.610> was<00:01:46.849> just<00:01:46.880> for

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
it's open our last game was just for

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.330 
it's open our last game was just for
shattered<00:01:47.780> temple<00:01:48.140> because<00:01:48.709> there's<00:01:48.950> rocks

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
shattered temple because there's rocks

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.179 
shattered temple because there's rocks
on<00:01:49.579> the<00:01:49.670> map<00:01:49.849> you<00:01:50.720> can<00:01:51.229> use<00:01:51.560> the<00:01:51.799> links<00:01:52.159> that

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 
on the map you can use the links that

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:55.120 
on the map you can use the links that
you<00:01:52.340> get<00:01:52.579> early<00:01:52.880> on<00:01:53.030> to<00:01:53.420> apply<00:01:53.720> pressure<00:01:54.130> delay

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
you get early on to apply pressure delay

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:56.800 
you get early on to apply pressure delay
their<00:01:55.340> expo<00:01:55.700> and<00:01:55.880> then<00:01:56.060> break<00:01:56.299> your<00:01:56.450> rocks<00:01:56.630> and

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
their expo and then break your rocks and

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.929 
their expo and then break your rocks and
they<00:01:56.959> could<00:01:57.110> pass<00:01:57.259> their<00:01:57.470> third<00:01:57.789> so<00:01:58.789> I<00:01:58.819> think

00:01:58.929 --> 00:01:58.939 
they could pass their third so I think

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:01.929 
they could pass their third so I think
it<00:01:59.209> was<00:01:59.329> a<00:01:59.360> really<00:02:00.189> build<00:02:01.189> really<00:02:01.429> geared<00:02:01.789> up

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:01.939 
it was a really build really geared up

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:03.729 
it was a really build really geared up
just<00:02:02.239> for<00:02:02.420> shadow<00:02:02.599> temple<00:02:02.869> and<00:02:03.200> similar<00:02:03.530> to

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:03.739 
just for shadow temple and similar to

00:02:03.739 --> 00:02:05.139 
just for shadow temple and similar to

00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:04.879 
unusual to see something like that as

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:06.520 
unusual to see something like that as
the<00:03:05.060> finest<00:03:05.329> taking<00:03:05.659> an<00:03:05.720> incredibly<00:03:06.200> fast

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
the finest taking an incredibly fast

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:12.369 
the finest taking an incredibly fast
third<00:03:08.170> which<00:03:09.170> I<00:03:09.349> like<00:03:10.629> we'll<00:03:11.629> see<00:03:11.870> how<00:03:12.019> far

00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:12.379 
third which I like we'll see how far

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:15.610 
third which I like we'll see how far
since<00:03:12.650> the<00:03:13.040> socks<00:03:13.430> for<00:03:13.609> us<00:03:14.170> nice<00:03:15.170> scouting
