00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.799
 Nine people today I'll show you the 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.799
 snapshot 13 w 21 a 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.869
 There is so much new in this spot 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.189
 but not that I do not think bad 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.450
 rather you should take a little time 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.560
 let's do something really good 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.689
 rauszuhauen 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.840
 The first is when you sneak and 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.039
 his entire work also comes to light 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.449
 fairer inventory there you can 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.820
 armor the saddle removed again 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.989
 and put the armor back in when 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.489
 For example, sometime now with her 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.410
 you can easily find diamond armor 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.449
 exchange and you can too 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.190
 Take it away again and so on 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:42.540
 continue you can change the saddle if 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.500
 you do not want to have that 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.059
 new forces 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.850
 the same then there's also the donkey 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.430
 there it is so there is no box 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.470
 slot but this here is the boxes 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.699
 So here the box is displayed 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.420
 is still a little less fields 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.909
 as previously 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.339
 and there is no box slot you can 

00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:02.010
 take the box away only by the 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:03.360
 donkey kills but now also the 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.799
 We will be dropped again 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.080
 have seen a saddle and 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.580
 a box I think that 's good 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.869
 things now honestly dropped 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:15.479
 So another innovation is that 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.909
 you no longer have armor armor 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.920
 as you can see I get stuck 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.420
 only one single one 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.310
 armor out of it and you can not 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.750
 more stuck 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.600
 furthermore, hay bales are burning now 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.439
 fast or they burn at least 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.060
 where did not I think that from 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.710
 burned and now they burn one sees 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.380
 how fast they burn then there is 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.979
 another innovation that calls itself that 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.740
 attribute to be added 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.200
 Attribute means some ability 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.719
 something that can improve the item 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.840
 for example at the 20 speed as 

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:51.899
 attribute and stop by the potions are 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.399
 yes, all attributes actually because everyone 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.649
 Ill do something with the swords 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.539
 that's just the attack surface 6 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.479
 discovered with a tactical is a 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:03.119
 half heart so diamond has seven day 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.950
 so that the armor is not yet and 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.020
 that will all be added to the 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.300
 example here again the attribute and it 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.209
 is now you can now if you want 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.280
 the budget own attributes easier 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:16.470
 Add as it used to be earlier 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.930
 At that time , you had to crown very special 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.670
 and now it's relatively easy to get rich 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.800
 I do not know how but they are 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.750
 attribute 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.700
 then there is a chat system namely 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:30.020
 times as an ever if you now 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:32.030
 Command enters the mediates and 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:35.060
 the language pack what you install 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:37.310
 has the commands immediately and thus 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.570
 will now be commandos in the multiplayer 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.160
 translated better if you are 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.960
 drown language packages of German 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.230
 have installed then he does not look 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.910
 which words are translated 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.530
 but that translates the whole command 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.970
 theoretically one could believe me there 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.430
 something completely different to write 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.350
 and pigs are like horses now 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.290
 these thighs in the corner those 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:59.030
 Show life performance and that was too 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.260
 everything from this snapshot again 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.230
 not much but I wish you 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:06.160
 Nevertheless, have fun with the snapshot 13 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.160
 21h and ciao
