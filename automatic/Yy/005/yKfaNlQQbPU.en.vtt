 this console but I will stay mattress 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.140
 great for its design by half 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:36.920
 it's like a different reality to 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:39.500
 insert discs in one piece one thing 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.300
 totally different since as many 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.350
 they will know when the games did not work 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.350
 you had to do this 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:53.570
 and then if it did not work like that we were 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:55.130

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:59.540
 entertaining analysis of the nintendo 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.550
 entertainment system nintendo 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.890
 also known entertainment system 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.110
 how nes is a video game console 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.420
 8-bit belonging to the third 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.280
 generation game console many 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.770
 people believe that this is the first 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.050
 generation but it's only because this 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.270
 it began to be labeled with nomenclatures 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.940
 of bits and was known as the era of 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.640
 the 8 bits in which in addition to nes 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:25.940
 I found the sega master system marc 2 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:28.430
 of sega marc 3 of sega atari 7,800 and 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.259
 time set vision nintendo was also 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.930
 known in countries like japan china 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:37.100
 vietnam et cetera as family computer of 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:39.020
 fame com where it was marketed in 1983 and 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:43.340
 then in north america europe and australia 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:46.250
 between 1985 and 87 as nintendo 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.440
 entertainment system is considered 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.690
 like a most successful video game console of his 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.290
 era and helped revitalize the industry 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.630
 of the videos 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:56.480
 in the USA after many companies 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.490
 they had broken their design has a 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.830
 color scheme with gray tones and 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.510
 ornaments in black the slot for 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.340
 the cartridges is covered by a 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.680
 small door that must be opened for 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.690
 insert a game the dimensions of 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.810
 this model is approximately 10 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:14.030
 inches wide by 8 long and 3.5 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.470
 high here you can see the 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.140
 demonstration of how to insert a 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.820
 cartridge first open the lid what 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.920
 insert until they feel that the 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.800
 card was inserted and it remains firm in the 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.750
 Console slot press down 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.030
 and there the game will be secured for 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.760
 close the lid to remove it should 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.490
 pressing down the game will go up and 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.590
 you can extract it all the cartridges 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.330
 they had gray tonality except games 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.520
 specials such as the legend of zelda or 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.620
 soldiers who had plastic letters 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.910
 golden one extra fact is that the 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.070
 cartridges from the factory 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:49.700
 they were smaller than only 3 inches of 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:53.600
 high the nes uses a microprocessor of 8 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:56.410
 1.79 megahertz called rayco cpu 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.069
 and based on a core most technology 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.069
 6502 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:01.879
 a standard sound hardware 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:04.519
 finally mention that Danish 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:06.139
 contains 2 kb of ram memory so 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:08.329
 a game cartridge can reach 

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:11.510
 have extended ram to increase this 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:14.090
 figure also has 2 kb of ram of 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:17.959
 video the screen resolution of the 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:21.319
 nes is 256 x 240 and has a 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:23.420
 48-color palette controls the 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:25.760
 They had a rectangular design with a 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.840
 Simple layout of 4 start buttons 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.120

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.719
 Directional cross-shaped 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:35.169
 movements that replaced the 

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:37.040
 bulky joystick or joystick 

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:39.709

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:44.719
 famous light gun good friends that 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:46.609

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:47.989
 entertaining also for us in front 

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:49.519
 stopped doing it since we had to read 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:50.989
 quite a lot of things that we did not have 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:53.090
 idea as the technical specifications 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:56.000

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.949
 the feeling of recommended for you 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.049
 got there was the because they are already 

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:05.030
 leaving very few to be achieved 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:06.950
 a texture need more 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:10.010
