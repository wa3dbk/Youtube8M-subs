00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:03.790
 good 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.969
 what I bring you today for the version 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.550
 1.2 point 5 of our minecraft the 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:17.760
 world flame 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:20.880
 waters lounge generated mode and good what 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.660
 what it generates is a huge gigantic map 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.680
 of the valuable can be translated 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:29.300
 imagine yourself as if 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.920
 the volts of the web 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.230
 the eastern territory of the 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.390
 neighborhoods and good is a map of 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.239
 extreme survival because why not 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.010
 there is neither grass nor trees good 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:41.850
 6 trees but there are neither leaves nor anything 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.780
 you say what 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:48.020
 we are not going we will not be able to replant 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:50.960
 so the very scarce wood super 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:53.180
 scarce is neither pumpkin nor melons nor 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.539
 flowers there are no oceans there will only be 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.730
 small aquifers below these 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:02.020
 ruins that must be generated 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:04.170
 around all our mix 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.659
 in our world 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.150
 and also good for here is a 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:13.310
 probability of such a one appearing 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:17.220
 some grass to tree 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:19.260
 water and some varied flora 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.090
 and good for this model that 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.070
 we will need only is the model to 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.510
 give so you download it and I'll leave it 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.520
 as always the description of the video 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.890
 this law previously remember to erase the 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.450
 meta and pnv folder and good for download 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.700
 let's not be 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.060
 I'm going to explain to you , Mr. Beach and 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.039
 we give him here the mediafire will open with 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.170
 the file this we download rain as 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:41.909
 I have it I do not download it good for 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.240
 install it we go as always to 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:47.280
 start write run 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.540
 well let's write percentage app 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.540
 data percentage we accept 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.810
 we're going our minecraft point 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.580
 we open right button right in the 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.480
 executable find open with wilson 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.280
 archive 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.850
 we open 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.470
 our mod 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.870
 if you want to go backwards online it 's 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.780
 really this 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:12.560
 directly do this we copy all 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.480
 these files 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.739
 control 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.940
 and the past we accept and they are already 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:22.129
 will remember installed knows it because not 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.870
 the mod is going to work and we're going 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:26.330
 our men kraft to verify that 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.549
 we have been correctly good 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:32.090
 good as you are seeing this is the 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:34.250
 natural landscape of this mod 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:38.230
 that is, as I am seeing a tree 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:41.810
 it is not on green earth all sand in 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:44.120
 normal ground these are foundations of 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.590
 house that what we can take advantage of 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.239
 here only in the wood so 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.940
 all the wood that we see we will have it 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:51.440
 that pick up yes or yes we're going to go here that 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.280
 There are other 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.640
 other foundations you see here there is fire 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.890
 that if we remove it we have here 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:02.350
 this stone of the flow 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.720
 throw your broken burning that I do not remember 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.670
 as this ruin is called they will appear 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.400
 throughout our map with cancer in the 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.319
 I can see a mushroom stove with the 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.959
 seen can see bread can see dust 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:15.730
 Bones can know the most valuable water 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:18.370
 water Cube 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.520
 these are the trees that are in this 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.520
 Map 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.570
 this has to cut the whole thing that the 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:29.150
 valuable wood in this mode is very 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:32.750
 valuable here we see a poster of 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:35.290
 here he died of pitt no longer follows 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.629
 digging around here no no 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:40.180
 children who offer anything we're going to 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:42.450
 approaching here there are more ruins and we go 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:45.490
 an aquifer 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:47.910
 here we go that has looked here 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:50.280
 and these aquifers are the ones 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.069
 we will have to take advantage we are going to 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.730
 find a bread 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:54.730
 nothing 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:02.410
 more of the same with two rings you go 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:10.280
 of extreme survival 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.280
 this seems to me to be a bomb 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:18.440
 go a trap 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:21.170
 so be careful when you go to 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.930
 take things do not go very excited 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:26.290
 because they can make you zasca 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.960
 now let's go for 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:30.770
 it consists here 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.770
 wheat 

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:41.259
 here is a shit I do not think 

00:04:38.309 --> 00:04:42.219
 we open we have light bone powder is 

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:45.969
 boy this is the mod 

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:48.300
 I say is a mod that is very handsome what 

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:50.200
 what happens that is super 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.810
 extreme survival of I say this 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:55.660

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.750
