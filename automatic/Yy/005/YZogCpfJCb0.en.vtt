00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.140 
time to start relaxing my hair I use a
no<00:01:52.750> live<00:01:52.990> relaxer<00:01:53.560> because<00:01:53.890> it's<00:01:54.100> gentle<00:01:54.970> on

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.150 
no live relaxer because it's gentle on

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.840 
no live relaxer because it's gentle on
the<00:01:55.180> skin<00:01:55.540> and<00:01:55.900> the<00:01:55.990> scalp<00:01:56.320> I<00:01:56.650> like<00:01:57.220> to<00:01:57.490> add

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
the skin and the scalp I like to add

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.790 
the skin and the scalp I like to add
enough<00:01:58.210> activator<00:01:58.750> into<00:01:59.170> my<00:01:59.320> new<00:01:59.590> line

00:01:59.790 --> 00:01:59.800 
enough activator into my new line

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.070 
enough activator into my new line
relaxer<00:02:00.340> so<00:02:00.370> that<00:02:00.850> it<00:02:00.940> reaches<00:02:01.600> the<00:02:01.720> normal

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
relaxer so that it reaches the normal

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.970 
relaxer so that it reaches the normal
mark<00:02:04.050> just<00:02:05.050> be<00:02:05.230> careful<00:02:05.680> when<00:02:05.860> you're

applying<00:02:06.280> the<00:02:06.520> activator<00:02:07.270> to<00:02:07.480> the<00:02:07.570> relaxer

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
applying the activator to the relaxer

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.600 
applying the activator to the relaxer
because<00:02:08.320> it<00:02:08.470> will<00:02:08.649> agitate<00:02:08.890> your<00:02:09.310> skin<00:02:09.580> a

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
from the crown to your edges but as you

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.940 
from the crown to your edges but as you
get<00:02:49.270> to<00:02:49.480> your<00:02:49.630> edge<00:02:49.810> be<00:02:50.140> sure<00:02:50.320> to<00:02:50.440> stop<00:02:50.680> right

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
get to your edge be sure to stop right

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.890 
get to your edge be sure to stop right
before<00:02:50.980> it<00:02:51.400> with<00:02:51.520> each<00:02:51.700> section<00:02:52.209> I<00:02:52.390> like<00:02:52.600> to<00:02:52.750> go

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
before it with each section I like to go

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.110 
before it with each section I like to go
back<00:02:53.350> at<00:02:53.560> the<00:02:53.680> end<00:02:53.709> after<00:02:54.340> I've<00:02:54.430> done<00:02:54.580> all<00:02:54.820> four

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
back at the end after I've done all four

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.600 
back at the end after I've done all four
sections<00:02:55.420> and<00:02:55.930> then<00:02:56.350> go<00:02:56.920> ahead<00:02:57.070> and<00:02:57.310> apply<00:02:57.489> the

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
sections and then go ahead and apply the

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.090 
sections and then go ahead and apply the
relaxer<00:02:57.910> to<00:02:58.450> my<00:02:58.630> edges<00:02:59.200> and<00:02:59.440> my<00:02:59.620> nape<00:02:59.830> section

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
relaxer to my edges and my nape section

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.070 
relaxer to my edges and my nape section
just<00:03:00.489> because<00:03:00.820> that<00:03:01.000> section<00:03:01.480> of<00:03:01.630> my<00:03:01.750> hair<00:03:01.780> is

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
just because that section of my hair is

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.590 
just because that section of my hair is
a<00:03:02.110> lot<00:03:02.380> less<00:03:02.620> resistant<00:03:03.220> to<00:03:03.880> the<00:03:04.060> relaxer<00:03:04.570> and

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
a lot less resistant to the relaxer and

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.690 
a lot less resistant to the relaxer and
so<00:03:04.840> it<00:03:04.930> doesn't<00:03:05.080> need<00:03:05.320> as<00:03:05.470> much<00:03:05.800> time<00:03:06.100> to<00:03:06.519> get

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
so it doesn't need as much time to get

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:12.479 
so it doesn't need as much time to get
straight<00:03:10.200> another<00:03:11.200> helpful<00:03:11.620> tip<00:03:11.920> is<00:03:12.130> to<00:03:12.310> try

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
straight another helpful tip is to try

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:14.640 
straight another helpful tip is to try
to<00:03:12.550> do<00:03:12.790> each<00:03:13.030> section<00:03:13.720> within<00:03:14.170> two<00:03:14.500> to<00:03:14.530> three

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
to do each section within two to three

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.740 
to do each section within two to three
minutes<00:03:15.220> that<00:03:15.760> way<00:03:15.970> by<00:03:16.180> the<00:03:16.239> time<00:03:16.540> you've
