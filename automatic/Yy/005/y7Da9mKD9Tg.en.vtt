00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
unique I would say the most challenging

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.309 
unique I would say the most challenging
part<00:02:48.709> is<00:02:48.920> doing<00:02:49.430> 10<00:02:49.700> shows<00:02:49.910> a<00:02:49.940> week<00:02:50.170> getting<00:02:51.170> up

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:51.319 
part is doing 10 shows a week getting up

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:53.319 
part is doing 10 shows a week getting up
and<00:02:51.530> performing<00:02:52.340> the<00:02:52.489> same<00:02:52.700> thing<00:02:52.970> the<00:02:53.299> next

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:53.329 
and performing the same thing the next

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:55.600 
and performing the same thing the next
day<00:02:53.629> for<00:02:53.930> the<00:02:54.019> next<00:02:54.260> group<00:02:54.680> of<00:02:54.890> audience<00:02:55.250> but

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
day for the next group of audience but

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.970 
day for the next group of audience but
even<00:02:56.390> though<00:02:56.510> it<00:02:56.629> is<00:02:56.660> challenging<00:02:57.440> at<00:02:57.950> times

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
even though it is challenging at times

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:06.650 
even though it is challenging at times
physically<00:02:58.760> it<00:02:59.360> it's<00:02:59.840> different<00:03:00.440> every<00:03:00.769> night

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.590 

typically<00:03:07.590> a<00:03:07.740> show<00:03:08.070> starts<00:03:08.790> about<00:03:09.240> three

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
typically a show starts about three

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.170 
typically a show starts about three
years<00:03:09.630> out<00:03:10.080> from<00:03:10.620> premier<00:03:11.220> and<00:03:11.460> that's<00:03:12.000> the

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
years out from premier and that's the

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.850 
years out from premier and that's the
very<00:03:12.330> early<00:03:12.750> stages<00:03:12.780> where<00:03:13.410> the<00:03:13.470> creative

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
very early stages where the creative

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.920 
very early stages where the creative
team<00:03:14.010> is<00:03:14.160> assembled<00:03:14.460> and<00:03:15.030> the<00:03:15.180> story<00:03:15.540> starts

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
team is assembled and the story starts

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.540 
team is assembled and the story starts
to<00:03:16.050> be<00:03:16.140> developed<00:03:16.590> and<00:03:16.740> the<00:03:16.830> ACT<00:03:17.010> start<00:03:17.340> to<00:03:17.460> be

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
to be developed and the ACT start to be

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.390 
to be developed and the ACT start to be
identified<00:03:18.090> then<00:03:18.870> we<00:03:19.080> jump<00:03:19.470> into<00:03:19.590> casting<00:03:20.190> and

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
identified then we jump into casting and

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.130 
identified then we jump into casting and
we<00:03:20.490> create<00:03:20.760> an<00:03:20.850> acrobatic<00:03:21.360> skeleton<00:03:21.900> which

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
we create an acrobatic skeleton which

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.750 
we create an acrobatic skeleton which
allows<00:03:22.470> us<00:03:22.650> to<00:03:22.770> understand<00:03:23.250> what<00:03:23.490> is<00:03:23.610> the

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
allows us to understand what is the

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.600 
allows us to understand what is the
makeup<00:03:24.000> of<00:03:24.300> this<00:03:24.450> show<00:03:24.770> then<00:03:25.770> we<00:03:26.160> jump<00:03:26.490> into

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
makeup of this show then we jump into

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.820 
makeup of this show then we jump into
the<00:03:26.940> creation<00:03:27.240> period<00:03:27.810> which<00:03:28.140> is<00:03:28.440> usually

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
the creation period which is usually

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.740 
the creation period which is usually
about<00:03:28.920> nine<00:03:29.280> months<00:03:29.550> so<00:03:30.330> we<00:03:30.450> bring<00:03:30.630> the

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
about nine months so we bring the

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.570 
about nine months so we bring the
artists<00:03:31.170> in<00:03:31.290> weaving<00:03:31.620> in<00:03:31.770> our<00:03:31.890> trainings<00:03:32.370> and

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
artists in weaving in our trainings and

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.030 
artists in weaving in our trainings and
those<00:03:33.030> trainings<00:03:33.480> transition<00:03:34.050> into<00:03:34.260> stagings

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
those trainings transition into stagings

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.670 
those trainings transition into stagings
which<00:03:35.850> transition<00:03:36.510> into<00:03:36.660> rehearsals<00:03:37.410> and

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
which transition into rehearsals and

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:47.250 
which transition into rehearsals and
then<00:03:38.430> we<00:03:38.550> have<00:03:38.670> a<00:03:38.700> show

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260
