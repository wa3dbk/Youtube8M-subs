first use following along with the
instructions<00:01:02.899> first<00:01:03.899> steps<00:01:04.229> are<00:01:04.409> to<00:01:04.530> take<00:01:04.650> it

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
instructions first steps are to take it

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:05.950 
instructions first steps are to take it
out<00:01:04.920> of<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.129> box

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
out of the box

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.270 
out of the box
next<00:01:06.960> step<00:01:07.140> is<00:01:07.409> to<00:01:07.560> take<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.890> smart<00:01:08.159> and

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
next step is to take the smart and

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.260 
next step is to take the smart and
extruder<00:01:09.110> and<00:01:10.760> put<00:01:11.760> it<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.600> extruder<00:01:13.110> down<00:01:13.380> in

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
extruder and put it the extruder down in

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.080 
extruder and put it the extruder down in
place<00:01:15.710> it's<00:01:16.710> magnetic<00:01:17.220> so<00:01:17.369> we'll<00:01:17.640> pop<00:01:17.820> right

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
place it's magnetic so we'll pop right

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.620 
place it's magnetic so we'll pop right
on

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:28.600 

next<00:01:22.160> take<00:01:23.160> the<00:01:23.340> film<00:01:23.580> in<00:01:24.710> make<00:01:25.710> sure

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.300 

you<00:01:29.210> have<00:01:29.360> some<00:01:29.570> ready

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:40.670 

slide<00:01:32.970> it<00:01:33.150> down<00:01:33.530> into<00:01:34.530> place<00:01:38.300> next<00:01:39.300> step<00:01:39.660> is<00:01:40.500> to

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
slide it down into place next step is to

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.550 
slide it down into place next step is to
take<00:01:40.800> the<00:01:40.950> filament<00:01:41.370> -<00:01:42.500> and<00:01:44.180> make<00:01:45.180> sure<00:01:45.560> you

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
take the filament - and make sure you

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.800 
take the filament - and make sure you
have<00:01:46.680> your<00:01:46.800> filament<00:01:47.330> going<00:01:48.330> through<00:01:48.660> the

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
have your filament going through the

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:58.679 
have your filament going through the
tube

00:01:58.679 --> 00:01:58.689 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:03.300 

and<00:01:58.929> it<00:01:59.350> clips<00:01:59.619> on<00:01:59.799> to<00:02:00.219> the<00:02:00.340> side<00:02:01.259> of<00:02:02.310> the

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
and it clips on to the side of the

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:09.180 
and it clips on to the side of the
filament<00:02:03.609> to<00:02:03.909> case<00:02:04.689> right<00:02:05.140> here<00:02:06.179> and<00:02:08.160> has<00:02:09.160> a

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
filament to case right here and has a

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.280 
filament to case right here and has a
little<00:02:09.489> arrow<00:02:09.700> on<00:02:10.000> it<00:02:10.110> pointing<00:02:11.110> which

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
little arrow on it pointing which

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.520 
little arrow on it pointing which
direction<00:02:11.650> goes<00:02:11.980> out<00:02:12.360> next<00:02:13.360> the<00:02:13.870> filament<00:02:14.349> to

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
direction goes out next the filament to

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:22.640 
direction goes out next the filament to
goes<00:02:15.310> right<00:02:15.549> into<00:02:15.730> the<00:02:15.879> extruder<00:02:18.780> like<00:02:19.780> so

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.540 

the<00:02:23.040> next<00:02:23.310> step<00:02:24.050> is<00:02:25.050> to<00:02:25.260> take<00:02:25.410> your<00:02:25.560> tray<00:02:25.860> the

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
the next step is to take your tray the

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.750 
the next step is to take your tray the
tray<00:02:26.580> comes<00:02:27.120> with<00:02:27.560> blue<00:02:28.560> tape<00:02:28.860> that<00:02:29.640> is

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
tray comes with blue tape that is

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.080 
tray comes with blue tape that is
oriented<00:02:30.330> these<00:02:31.050> holes<00:02:31.440> over<00:02:32.160> where<00:02:32.849> the

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
oriented these holes over where the

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:39.410 
oriented these holes over where the
magnetic<00:02:34.580> points<00:02:35.580> of<00:02:35.790> contact<00:02:36.239> are<00:02:38.120> the<00:02:39.120> tray

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
magnetic points of contact are the tray

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.930 
magnetic points of contact are the tray
slides<00:02:39.870> right<00:02:40.500> and<00:02:41.150> like<00:02:42.150> so<00:02:43.370> final<00:02:44.370> step<00:02:44.730> is

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
slides right and like so final step is

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.350 
slides right and like so final step is
