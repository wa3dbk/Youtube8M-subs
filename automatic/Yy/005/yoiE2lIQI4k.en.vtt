00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.809
 boxing the channel and well really not 

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:17.630
 you are waiting for this but a long time ago 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:20.599
 I wanted to play starcraft I did not have it 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.950
 a long time ago but the question is 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:24.349
 that a friend gave it to me and he said no 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:26.150
 he had given me but actually I 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:28.220
 there was how to say it as a means 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.690
 cheated since he uses the has accepted 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.890
 with some bank and I gave you the 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:32.660
 product before checking that the 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.160
 bank account worked total that 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.320
 I had the starcraft seven days but I did not 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.760
 I'm just running so now I've 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.010
 seen pretty are going to dominate good has 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.440
 cost there to put that equals 35s this 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.329
 focuses well puts 35 with 90 but I started 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.950
 of web call me this 17 euros for the 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.620
 of drawn for 17 euros that go as 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.969
 you are watching is the starcraft 2 juezo 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.920
 that I also had the expansion now 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:54.020
 right away to play with my cousin town and 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.280
 with whom you cheer up so you're not going to 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.480
 stop surely starting at the 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.520
 channel of this same yes you have some 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.600
 direct with Mr. Town but no no 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.129
 I think the games simply the 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.719
 Salesman I do not think you play for 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:05.000
 I'm going to play it to patch 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:06.229
 minutes free data out there with the 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.539
 sir is one I only here is the 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:09.830
 mister of starcraft so let's see 

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:11.960
 without more the box has opened these 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:17.990
 slightly tricky bridge designs 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:20.360
 to see it and remove it from the mobile and above 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:24.260
 you know nothing for being supported and pulling 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.400
 the lady box to see to see if we are not 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.110
 I know how he 's recording this be that 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.750
 is recorded from the mobile look that 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.790
 is with your Lord seal as I like 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.040
 nothing what it does is light that there is 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.229
 slide I have everything I have I have all 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.050
 the original eggs in physical edition 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.159
 since I like to have them in format 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.479
 physical all that comes to be from 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:43.970
 use but hey look here he puts 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:46.190
 begins the lady battle that makes 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.259
 a little football and we are going to open the 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.880
 no more box we have that is a box 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:51.830
 because they are typical of plastic does not have 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.300
 It does not have much mystery and see if it has 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.399
 the seal of this one also easy 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.899
 studying time shares and good as 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:58.460
 I'm telling you really, you have not expected 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:59.780
 this being here was a couple 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.179
 days founded by twitter if someone 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.800
 I knew of some cheap place to buy 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:05.210
 is back since I 'm more interested in 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.159
 nothing by its extension but its expansion 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.100
 is a bit expensive in physical format like 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:11.710
 at 36 euros and case size or because 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.750
 he comes out about 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:16.390
 25 euros while it is necessary in 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.400
 house 35 10 and no but how can it be a 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.530
 digital format that comes to be that of 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.300
 those that come out more expensive than a format 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.310
 physical that in this case has already left 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.780
 I say 17 euros but if you buy it in 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.430
 villamar you are not fools and say what 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.770
 you are going to buy it with web price 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.020
 because if they nail us 35 euros thing that 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.760
 also happened with the mobile that I did 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.830
 you go directly that puts in 326 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.020
 euros while the web has nothing 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.850
 280 and good technique makes a discount 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.730
 open to practically be here 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:45.160
 of the game to see this is a pass from 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.930
 invited over here we have the Lord game 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.250
 that I really do not even know so they have 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.510
 a cd board is what really matters 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.070
 in this type of games is the one that led 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.050
 not equal that they do not put so that it is 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.790
 decent in the a chef this is the pass 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.230
 invited not to play the world 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.540
 warcraft to see what else they have here 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.690
 I do not want to take out the one we have 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:04.330
 here a guide but here since late 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.819
 they are here to teach them really go 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.969
 here I have limited passes to play 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:11.439
 and the one that endorses the one that I think is 

00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:16.749
 under the Lord, let's see 

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:18.129
 wait a second if it is worth then here 

00:03:16.749 --> 00:03:20.590
 there is the sign that is here below 

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:21.939
 is on a guest pass that well I do not know 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.469
 if someone will want some much I know that 

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:26.139
 you want a friend of mine so this one 

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:27.519
 I'm going to remove from here and well have two 

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:29.260
 Guest classes in case someone wants 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:30.579
 some I can give as I know I do not 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.530
 it matters to give a pass of these that 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:34.000
 you just play for seven days and 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.639
 well the other thing that has the wo look 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.230
 if you want this pass then there you have 

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:39.939
 here of the wow 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.639
 well here brings a manual with you 

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:44.200
 typical things of starcraft that the truth 

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:45.609
 is that it is great and I say everything 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.989
 what it does when hoisting is typical 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:48.400
 company that only has three games 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:50.769
 but the three you have are brutal 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.989
 both this one and in the expansion that 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:54.400
 taken from the swap as all the 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:55.810
 egg although good I say I was 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.810
 debut player but to this day already 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.739
 The truth is that for me it has been a bit 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.659
 stagnant have not been reached in me 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:03.189
 these pandaria and everything the whole subject well 

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:04.449
 that cheap in fats that I had 

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:06.010
 really want to catch this game the 

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:08.379
 truth is that I was seeing the other day 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.250
 a streaming of these from people who know 

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:10.720
 play this 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.730
 and it also gives me a bit of touch 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.990
 find very good people or like me the 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.000
 I call the Chinese because the Chinese or the 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:17.890
 who are here all day hesitating and you 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.970
 they beat up so good guys I hope 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:21.880
 that you have liked what comes to be 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.500
 the theme of this we're going I hope so 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.970
 good if you want some employment of this 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.380
 house you do not say and you can surely take 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:28.120
 some direct with a new cash of 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.710
 that surely if we want some but 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.360
 simple in itself to be home we are going to have 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.800
 we go like this with our dear call 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.390
 assume to enter as what I hope you 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.980
 have liked this a boxing is recorded 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.990
 with the phone to see if it is recorded well and 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:39.790
 everything is just about the pc that we see 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.180
 in the next video a hug and extra 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:42.180
 following
