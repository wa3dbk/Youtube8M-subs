00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 I have my old days far and wide 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.350
 used to write poems after 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.450
 I already do this during my term 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:14.549
 The meeting will be conducted with a big party 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:16.650
 have done no you have to 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.810
 poems in the service of the practical 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.020
 make use of 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:23.580
 First of all, you have to remember one thing 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:26.880
 namely the lab know nothing long 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.859
 more tolerate the earlier poets 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.380
 Schiller oland and all the houses 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.200
 Tent wrote for too long 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:38.030
 their only first stanza was impelling them 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.030
 Cambodian woman and the camera 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:53.199
 and then there is another 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:55.870
 mistakes many ma has many faces 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:58.719
 Colleague sees pressure that any 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:02.050
 thoughts on the poem so far nothing 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:03.940
 with god and the reader who left that 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.979
 poem and says what are you doing 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.990
 houses then usually ran snow 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:09.909
 less at the third time meant 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.790
 right terms at the fourth time recognizes 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:14.320
 that is not the case 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.840
 what the consequences for interest 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.910
 no more poems on my poems 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.920
 you can rely on it when at 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:24.149
 first read no sense found 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.149
 no glasses will be 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:44.650
 If you are currently not hanging out, show them 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.080
 would they if they are as a 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.330
 enlightened and educate decide 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.330
 I have to share some of my audience 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:54.630
 recite poems 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.630
 Mansfeld before 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:07.240
 the one poem is called profanation 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:12.129
 Trumpet exactly what that means who in the 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:15.129
 book one of his lyrical poems like that 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:17.799
 sensitive and tender are now 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:20.400
 under cabinet so that the cabinet door foot 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:20.400
 no more 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:35.890
 then I try my successor 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:38.900
 to support his last action 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:43.310
 my successor leaves you in the rest 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:47.060
 heartfelt crisis with a poignant 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:49.939
 poem that is dirt swing and is 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:52.840
 the room still so dirty I brush 

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:52.840
 not better before 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:13.890
 the bse crisis has a good memory 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:16.440
 we have never been so good cheaper 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:24.120
 as long as hung language yesterday with 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:28.860
 At the time I am also a poet 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:31.020
 flown visit cowshed the 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:34.320
 cattle looks at me silly 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:36.870
 maybe it does I mad cow 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:40.580
 Do not look much wiser 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.580
 I probably be affected 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:58.849
 a big danger threatens every citizen 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:04:02.760
 in that in the last three years 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:03.200

 For this register guestbook alcohol gave 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:23.010

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.760
 the beef left that was pretty 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.760
 low
