00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:26.270
 very good evening today 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:29.750
 I bring a new video of how to install 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:33.380
 a tweet that will give us a framework to 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:38.050
 icons as you can see all the 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.050
 apps let's go to syria 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.750
 once we enter like this day we are going to 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.610
 look for him 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.110
 with fire 'hot springs 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.640
 by ios 7 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:54.110
 I have it installed myself 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:57.030
 install I have installed 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:00.680
 and when they give it to install 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:04.500
 they are automatically going 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.800
 to also install the winter board 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.330
 once they have installed that 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:13.530
 we just go back to cydia 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.530
 and we look 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.820
 let's find 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.530
 another 'tweet' 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.830
 let's write it 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:32.470
 currÃ­n 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:34.480
 here is more than we already have installed 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.900
 also of the same 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:41.790
 there will be no problem 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:46.050
 It is already 100% compatible it is checked and 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:50.210
 you have it installed on my ipod 5 once 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.210
 that we already have all that installed 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.220
 let's go to window board 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.770
 and let's activate it 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.680
 we give here in this and it is here 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.340
 selected 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:11.709
 and once we select new 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.709
 let's give it a break 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:20.630
 it will reset us and automatically 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.630
 will not leave those icons 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.590
 now there are two versions you can do it 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:30.010
 squares like the ones I have or 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.830
 you can also do it in a circular way 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:37.770
 which is the other option 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:40.550
 let's see here that we see 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.550
 again 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.700
 themes 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:51.739
 and I have the option that is 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.050
 what is the one here that is from box to 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:57.330
 these two options as well as 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.830
 those three options that I already have 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.590
 ready 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.650
 what is it that makes me look like that 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.490
 fact that they are lying on one side 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:09.920
 export 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:09.920
 for another tweet that I already made a video 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:19.230
 vig bay not as you know lets them 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:21.340
 rotate the app in the app as 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:26.110
 you want 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:28.900
 as you see something simple very striking me 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:33.100
 like the way this looks 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:36.670
 excellent so I hope you like it 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:40.020

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.020
