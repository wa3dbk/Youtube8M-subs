right<00:02:35.730> or<00:02:36.150> perhaps<00:02:36.300> unfairly<00:02:36.810> that<00:02:37.080> open

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
right or perhaps unfairly that open

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.530 
right or perhaps unfairly that open
sides<00:02:37.830> are<00:02:38.010> judged<00:02:38.250> against<00:02:39.060> each<00:02:39.210> other<00:02:39.420> in

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
sides are judged against each other in

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.090 
sides are judged against each other in
ending<00:02:40.020> in<00:02:40.230> the<00:02:40.380> game<00:02:40.560> more<00:02:40.770> than<00:02:40.800> perhaps

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
ending in the game more than perhaps

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.340 
ending in the game more than perhaps
other<00:02:41.400> other<00:02:41.820> positions<00:02:42.240> it<00:02:42.390> seems<00:02:42.600> if<00:02:42.780> you're

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
other other positions it seems if you're

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:44.750 
other other positions it seems if you're
open<00:02:43.470> sides<00:02:43.830> that<00:02:43.980> a<00:02:44.010> good<00:02:44.160> game<00:02:44.310> easy<00:02:44.520> about<00:02:44.730> a

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
open sides that a good game easy about a

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.520 
open sides that a good game easy about a
bad<00:02:44.910> game<00:02:45.150> opposite<00:02:45.720> you<00:02:45.840> do<00:02:46.290> you<00:02:46.380> think

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
bad game opposite you do you think

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.110 
bad game opposite you do you think
that's<00:02:46.650> very<00:02:46.710> nice<00:02:47.100> away<00:02:47.490> I<00:02:47.790> think<00:02:48.030> it's

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
that's very nice away I think it's

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.300 
that's very nice away I think it's
always<00:02:48.240> tough<00:02:48.540> if<00:02:48.800> especially<00:02:49.800> you're<00:02:49.980> the

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
always tough if especially you're the

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:51.620 
always tough if especially you're the
opposite<00:02:50.640> mangas<00:02:50.970> man<00:02:51.150> on<00:02:51.270> the<00:02:51.330> mat<00:02:51.450> or

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
opposite mangas man on the mat or

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.530 
opposite mangas man on the mat or
something<00:02:51.660> but<00:02:52.350> that<00:02:53.220> it's<00:02:53.520> all<00:02:53.970> position<00:02:54.420> to

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
something but that it's all position to

autumn and the world cup game coming up

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.740 
autumn and the world cup game coming up
in<00:03:31.350> 11<00:03:31.860> months<00:03:31.920> time<00:03:32.220> yeah<00:03:32.730> it's<00:03:33.030> huge<00:03:33.480> in<00:03:33.720> that

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
in 11 months time yeah it's huge in that

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.390 
in 11 months time yeah it's huge in that
we<00:03:34.140> probably<00:03:34.350> look<00:03:34.560> back<00:03:34.740> and<00:03:34.950> I<00:03:35.040> think<00:03:35.220> if<00:03:35.310> we

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
we probably look back and I think if we

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.160 
we probably look back and I think if we
lose<00:03:35.550> this<00:03:35.580> game<00:03:35.730> will<00:03:36.150> will<00:03:36.510> consider<00:03:36.990> this<00:03:37.110> a

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
lose this game will will consider this a

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.840 
lose this game will will consider this a
very<00:03:37.440> disciplined<00:03:37.920> disappointing<00:03:38.580> autumn

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
up to expectation of course it'll always

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.590 
up to expectation of course it'll always
be<00:03:52.260> referred<00:03:52.710> to<00:03:52.740> as<00:03:52.980> markers<00:03:53.400> and<00:03:53.730> a<00:03:53.970> Miss<00:03:54.420> and

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
be referred to as markers and a Miss and

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.240 
be referred to as markers and a Miss and
that<00:03:54.660> but<00:03:55.290> for<00:03:55.410> us<00:03:55.560> it's<00:03:55.710> very<00:03:55.890> much<00:03:56.070> about

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
that but for us it's very much about

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.380 
that but for us it's very much about
finishing<00:03:56.670> with<00:03:57.000> a<00:03:57.030> winner<00:03:57.240> because

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
finishing with a winner because

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.390 
finishing with a winner because
otherwise<00:03:57.690> it<00:03:58.140> does<00:03:58.350> hang<00:03:58.770> over<00:03:58.950> you<00:03:59.130> you

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
otherwise it does hang over you you

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.190 
otherwise it does hang over you you
always<00:03:59.610> think<00:03:59.760> what<00:03:59.970> if<00:04:00.000> this<00:04:00.720> is<00:04:00.780> a<00:04:00.900> great<00:04:01.170> way

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
always think what if this is a great way

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.170 
always think what if this is a great way
to<00:04:01.380> sign<00:04:02.070> off<00:04:02.100> what<00:04:02.700> do<00:04:02.760> you<00:04:02.790> think<00:04:02.850> you<00:04:03.030> need

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
to sign off what do you think you need

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.910 
to sign off what do you think you need

to do in the next nine games before the
world<00:04:05.100> cup<00:04:05.190> we<00:04:05.730> always<00:04:06.150> look<00:04:06.300> at<00:04:06.420> aspects<00:04:06.780> of

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840
