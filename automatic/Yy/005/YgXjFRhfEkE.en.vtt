well<00:02:59.720> with<00:02:59.960> this<00:03:00.050> Toyota<00:03:00.350> carburetor<00:03:01.070> they

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
well with this Toyota carburetor they

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.000 
well with this Toyota carburetor they
everything<00:03:02.630> moves<00:03:02.840> nice<00:03:03.080> I'm<00:03:03.350> surprised<00:03:03.770> it

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
everything moves nice I'm surprised it

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.770

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
really really works better this in a

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:06.820 
really really works better this in a
freaking<00:03:06.080> full<00:03:06.230> 180

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
I guess Suzuki's don't want to put a

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.080 
I guess Suzuki's don't want to put a
Toyota<00:03:08.870> carburetor<00:03:09.410> on<00:03:09.620> their<00:03:09.800> cars<00:03:10.070> oh<00:03:10.280> look
