00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.550 
so this sort of looks out of place
now<00:04:47.090> let's<00:04:47.300> go<00:04:47.419> back<00:04:47.600> inside<00:04:47.870> and<00:04:48.260> see<00:04:48.320> if<00:04:48.470> we

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
now let's go back inside and see if we

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.549 
now let's go back inside and see if we
can<00:04:48.710> do<00:04:48.800> some<00:04:49.040> burnout<00:04:49.400> action

00:04:51.549 --> 00:04:51.559 
can do some burnout action

00:04:51.559 --> 00:05:12.500 
can do some burnout action
sure<00:04:52.099> we<00:04:52.249> won't<00:04:52.369> go<00:04:52.609> anywhere

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:12.510 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:15.409 

yeah

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:15.419 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:17.690 

we're<00:05:15.930> moving

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:17.700 
we're moving

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:24.050 
we're moving
hardly

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:28.450 

I<00:05:24.150> think<00:05:24.990> we're<00:05:25.139> running<00:05:25.260> out<00:05:25.410> of<00:05:25.470> gas<00:05:26.450> anyways

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:28.460 
I think we're running out of gas anyways

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:34.939 
I think we're running out of gas anyways
success

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:34.949 

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:38.040
