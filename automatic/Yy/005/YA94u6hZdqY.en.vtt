00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
the process of sealing right now I've

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.330 
the process of sealing right now I've
actually<00:02:31.390> applied<00:02:31.690> it<00:02:31.960> and<00:02:32.380> you<00:02:32.590> really<00:02:33.130> can't

actually applied it and you really can't

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.940 
actually applied it and you really can't
tell<00:02:33.460> it<00:02:33.970> has<00:02:34.210> a<00:02:34.240> really<00:02:34.600> good<00:02:34.780> fit<00:02:35.080> there<00:02:35.800> are

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
tell it has a really good fit there are

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.100 
tell it has a really good fit there are
some<00:02:36.190> very<00:02:36.460> small<00:02:36.820> air<00:02:37.120> bubbles<00:02:37.630> there<00:02:37.870> and

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
some very small air bubbles there and

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.500 
some very small air bubbles there and
across<00:02:38.290> the<00:02:38.410> bottom<00:02:38.740> and<00:02:39.040> in<00:02:39.910> the<00:02:40.210> actual

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
across the bottom and in the actual

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.930 
across the bottom and in the actual
pamphlet<00:02:41.080> that<00:02:41.260> comes<00:02:41.530> with<00:02:41.800> it<00:02:42.040> it<00:02:42.520> says<00:02:42.910> that

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
pamphlet that comes with it it says that

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.770 
pamphlet that comes with it it says that
you<00:02:43.540> should<00:02:43.810> allow<00:02:44.820> 1-2<00:02:45.820> days<00:02:46.030> right<00:02:46.480> there

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
you should allow 1-2 days right there

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.720 
you should allow 1-2 days right there
for<00:02:47.590> the<00:02:47.680> smaller<00:02:47.950> bubbles<00:02:48.400> to<00:02:48.520> fully

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
for the smaller bubbles to fully

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.140 
for the smaller bubbles to fully
dissipate<00:02:49.590> so<00:02:50.590> I'm<00:02:51.010> gonna<00:02:51.220> allow<00:02:51.580> it<00:02:51.610> to<00:02:51.940> do

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
dissipate so I'm gonna allow it to do

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.120 
dissipate so I'm gonna allow it to do
that<00:02:52.390> and<00:02:52.660> that's<00:02:53.200> pretty<00:02:53.380> much<00:02:53.590> it<00:02:53.830> but<00:02:53.860> I

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
that and that's pretty much it but I

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.510 
that and that's pretty much it but I
think<00:02:54.280> it<00:02:54.550> was<00:02:54.670> a<00:02:54.730> successful<00:02:55.270> install<00:02:56.520> and

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:57.520 
think it was a successful install and

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.060 
think it was a successful install and
I'm<00:02:58.180> really<00:02:58.450> happy<00:02:59.110> with<00:02:59.440> the<00:02:59.680> way<00:02:59.800> this<00:03:00.010> thing

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
basically line up the corners and you

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.740 
basically line up the corners and you
lock<00:03:49.480> it<00:03:49.660> in<00:03:49.810> like<00:03:50.350> so<00:03:50.380> and<00:03:51.120> it<00:03:52.120> goes<00:03:52.300> right<00:03:52.690> on

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750
