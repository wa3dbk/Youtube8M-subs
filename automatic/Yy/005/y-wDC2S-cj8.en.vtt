00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.390
 good i am quiksilver and today I bring you a 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.719
 new draw in which I bring you another 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.250
 once again for the second consecutive time 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:13.320
 although it is not the first time I do it 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.350
 I've done it before, it 's a 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:19.800
 draw of an original copy of 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:22.109
 minecraft minecraft premium and good is 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.080
 very easy to participate and you know that 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:28.800
 this I pay everything as I am not a partner 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:32.009
 I do not take anything from youtube so for 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.570
 Now I pay everything I hope to have 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.990
 plans and can create more contests 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.570
 this type 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:39.400
 and nothing we're going to start the contest the 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:43.570
 requirements are to be subscribed to the channel 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:45.490
 leave the favorites and leave a 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.829
 comment saying I agree and 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:49.690
 He participated 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:51.789
 what I agree is simply 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:55.749
 by the fact that not so that later 

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:58.089
 you can complain about whatsapp but it's that 

00:00:55.749 --> 00:00:59.469
 I like how the draws are worth if you've 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:03.420
 participated is because it is quite 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:06.270
 just simply extra data 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.770
 the more you know the video 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.509
 more contest is because I see that you 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.390
 interest is worth 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:15.250
 then I have already said it of not putting to him sticks 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.460
 to the sweep subway now explain how 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.710
 is 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.390
 follow me on twitter because there I give all 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.159
 my information as if there was a video 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.500
 when I do not know what but I was whole very 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:27.240
 fast when the contest comes up 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.230
 I will give the prize to the two thousand 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:34.830
 subscribers I have about 1800 what 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:36.420
 I can give 1,850 that you can to 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.119
 the 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.180
 in 1999 subscribers is to say how 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:46.380
 so want to be attentive to the channel 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.550
 I wish you luck and if you are going to put something 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.930
 that has nothing to do with the contest 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.390
 put it in your comment with a 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.690
 sandwich or just say did not participate 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.409
 or to oppose comment is that it helps me 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.929
 much as 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:02.740
 in the last contest they were a classic 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:04.329
 300 people and it was a mess because 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.610
 I had to take the name by name and 

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:10.030
 noted in a list 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:13.330
 and this time I'm going to do the same 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:19.250
 way because it seems the simplest 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:21.710
 between the work you have and the more 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.069
 the one that more possibility to give to all already 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.920
 that good 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:27.150
 in the future it may change and it does 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.030
 in another good way now it's going to be with 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.849
 the random dot org that puts a number 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:36.610
 that if between 1 and 100 and it gives you a number 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:39.250
 randomly you already know 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.950
 I hope you are lucky that I can 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.170
 touch that can touch us and nothing 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.850
 any question whatever 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.990
 I will leave the comments - you send by 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:51.370
 private I do not care and if you want 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.950
 there is something special that is not 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.290
 minecraft that I do not believe because most 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.700
 wants minecraft but also because 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.980
 give away anything else thanks 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.680
 minecraft while not worth much 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:06.130
 Maybe because it was a game of 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:09.220
 euros and should give away a couple of gifts or 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:11.560
 something like that, not me, it's not that 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.970
 be rich or anything like that but he 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.980
 tell me to be 20 euros 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:18.849
 I do not know 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:20.709
 in the field on the street, or want 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:22.910
 buy any asshole spending on 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.350
 this and I make a person happy 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:28.080
 and nothing 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:30.780
 many say that it is by subscribers 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:33.500
 Well, I do not know what man can do, 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:36.530
 I pay something something I have to earn but 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:39.160
 bear in mind that it is a gift 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:42.980
 if it does not touch you then I'm sorry but anyway 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:44.650
 nothing I do not want to roll more I do not know more 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.659
 what to say 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.120
 be very attentive to the channel because when 

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:54.180
 unless you expect it I upload the video and nothing 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.180
 see you in the next video bye bye
