time and it tells time like accurately I

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.490 
time and it tells time like accurately I
mean<00:01:48.700> that<00:01:48.880> was<00:01:49.060> seriously<00:01:49.510> in<00:01:49.990> their<00:01:50.260> copy

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
mean that was seriously in their copy

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.590 
mean that was seriously in their copy
it's<00:01:51.070> going<00:01:51.310> to<00:01:51.370> tell<00:01:51.580> time<00:01:51.760> accurately<00:01:52.060> guys

three<00:01:53.350> different<00:01:53.710> ways<00:01:54.480> redundancies<00:01:55.480> to

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
three different ways redundancies to

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.080 
three different ways redundancies to
make<00:01:55.900> sure<00:01:56.080> the<00:01:56.290> time<00:01:56.560> is<00:01:56.920> accurate

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
make sure the time is accurate

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.480 
make sure the time is accurate
so<00:01:58.810> there<00:01:59.049> are<00:01:59.079> all<00:01:59.350> different<00:01:59.490> variations

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
so there are all different variations

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.669 
so there are all different variations
from<00:02:00.700> what<00:02:00.909> I<00:02:00.939> gather<00:02:01.270> of<00:02:01.570> this<00:02:01.840> watch<00:02:02.079> you<00:02:02.530> can

00:02:02.669 --> 00:02:02.679 
from what I gather of this watch you can
