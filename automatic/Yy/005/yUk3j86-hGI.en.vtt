00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:03.360
 there are more and more games 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.770
 9 are very violent 6 disastrous effect 6 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:13.869
 anyway not after 

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:17.310
 an age limit 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.310
 their working week 

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:28.619
 The number of violent games has risen considerably in recent years 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.249
 since an external consoles have come on the market I think so 

00:00:32.249 --> 00:00:33.650
 become more realistic 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.050
 you may wonder whether young people can see the difference between the games 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.020
 and the reality 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:40.830
 pull out what kind of game 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:45.130
 the time between multiple shooter and the race and the football of course this 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.910
 successes 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:47.640
 no more chance 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.540
 central 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.970
 which stands for extremely violent games wealth management 2 a gt year four 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:55.870
 clearly an 18 plus sign 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.800
 a bit of this just sold to minors 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.800
 most of the time the old child doesn't even know what a third child is playing 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.930
 and what about violence in third day of violent games 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.890
 if you are a while then you understand naturally draws a game is a game 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.360
 in reality reality 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.030
 yes I have no problems with a tumor I am the aggression of the city 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.210
 get there 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.620
 9 only to more violence as a parent, of course I am not happy with that 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:26.040
 a lot of violence in syria 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.670
 how many people for young people 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.159
 boy who are very sensitive to it, I think it's just because of it 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.580
 dangerous but i much more first of all i know that 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.080
 Much is controversial but I think most people 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.030
 why it can be seen as trainers players and the other is one 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.050
 There is again the time between people to watch 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.630
 the exceptions but I have you everywhere at risk for some young people I think so 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.220
 interest rates too low 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.780
 could be sustained for two to three years 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.359
 I just think it's normal 

00:01:57.359 --> 00:02:01.009
 if you just a little bit by little on the street a child of nine is already going 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:02.810
 quickly put his money at stake 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.040
 even though it is heavy criminals 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.429
 and things like that also do what happens in my game 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.429
 sanders 

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:15.119
 when children come 

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:17.409
 let me say 

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:22.869
 7 or 8 years and playing a game of London from 16 years 

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:24.799
 then you may wonder 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:26.489
 what effect it has 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:30.310
 final conclusion others do well at the age limits of the games in the 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.439
 keep an eye on 

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:33.219
 and especially look at the stickers on the corners
