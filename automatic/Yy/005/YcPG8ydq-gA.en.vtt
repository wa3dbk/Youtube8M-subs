00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.430
 who are we at transport training on 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.600
 tour this separation has been going on since 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.420
 eleven years 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.869
 the customers of mercedes benz over the year 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:30.070
 We have about 100 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:34.000
 event days in which we talk about the 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:39.580
 accompany 4800 guests in the trends 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:44.710
 Do not have to react properly 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:46.629
 as you are used to it maybe that 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.129
 GÃ¼nter and other transporters and therefore 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:50.019
 was my concern natural persons 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:51.790
 training to participate just like that 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:52.930
 a dare to cross the border 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.860
 experience and know how that is 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.860
 then vehicle behaves 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.600
 I once have the learning effect that I do 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.760
 say well, I moved later with me 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.220
 much safer for our vehicles 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.530
 on the street but also the whole day 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.060
 to have fun over 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.320
 that is really interesting it will be 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.640
 now to a full braking one 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.640
 to make a braking stop 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.909
 also our demonstrations with the kitsch 

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:26.590
 winter as well as looks trailer 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:29.649
 stabilization show it completely 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:32.820
 clearly that our systems are there really 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:32.820
 support emergency situations 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.540
 the loaded unload the secure that 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.640
 are all mechanical hazards 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.350
 Factors and that's exactly where 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.670
 we are also geared to that 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.230
 We are required to do this instruction 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.230
 Practice compliant 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.550
 you drive a car which is quite another 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.659
 has dynamics than the cars and that's why 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.610
 I see that as very helpful 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:02.770
 that you have the opportunity to practice 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:07.229
 participate for free and get that 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.229
 car with appropriate training
