like you 911 in snow the more serious
points<00:01:28.110> make<00:01:28.289> is<00:01:28.500> that<00:01:28.850> mission<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.000> actually

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
points make is that mission and actually

so<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.979> thing<00:01:38.189> is<00:01:38.220> we<00:01:38.969> don't<00:01:39.090> have<00:01:39.210> to<00:01:39.420> have

00:01:39.559 --> 00:01:39.569 
so the thing is we don't have to have

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:42.590 
so the thing is we don't have to have
your<00:01:39.659> car<00:01:39.899> looking<00:01:40.200> as<00:01:40.350> if<00:01:40.469> it's<00:01:41.600> completely

ice<00:01:58.380> basically<00:01:59.539> having<00:02:00.539> said<00:02:00.810> that<00:02:00.840> there

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
ice basically having said that there

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:07.710 
ice basically having said that there
doesn't<00:02:01.380> need<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:01.649> be<00:02:01.770> quite<00:02:02.280> a<00:02:02.310> lot<00:02:02.640> of<00:02:02.789> rig

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.630 

I<00:02:07.810> mean<00:02:08.080> there's<00:02:08.290> quite<00:02:08.590> decent<00:02:09.040> bit<00:02:09.160> steering

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
I mean there's quite decent bit steering

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:15.430 
I mean there's quite decent bit steering
quite<00:02:09.820> there<00:02:10.060> well<00:02:10.390> much<00:02:10.869> sheet<00:02:11.260> of<00:02:11.560> snow

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.160 

I<00:02:15.470> mean<00:02:16.130> with<00:02:16.250> a<00:02:16.310> summer<00:02:16.580> tire<00:02:16.880> on<00:02:17.120> he<00:02:18.020> would

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
I mean with a summer tire on he would

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.010 
I mean with a summer tire on he would
just<00:02:18.320> be<00:02:18.500> straight<00:02:19.370> off<00:02:19.640> into<00:02:20.090> the<00:02:20.150> snowbank

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
just be straight off into the snowbank

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.640 
just be straight off into the snowbank
the<00:02:21.470> braking<00:02:22.130> is<00:02:22.160> really<00:02:22.490> good<00:02:22.670> too<00:02:23.080> in<00:02:24.080> fact<00:02:24.320> I

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
the braking is really good too in fact I

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.110 
the braking is really good too in fact I
think<00:02:24.920> the<00:02:25.040> braking<00:02:25.460> is<00:02:25.520> the<00:02:25.580> most<00:02:25.760> impressive

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
think the braking is the most impressive

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.670 
think the braking is the most impressive
thing<00:02:26.360> of<00:02:26.480> all<00:02:26.570> we<00:02:26.750> can<00:02:26.900> put<00:02:26.930> tires<00:02:27.290> like<00:02:27.530> this

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
thing of all we can put tires like this

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.950 
thing of all we can put tires like this
on<00:02:28.090> the<00:02:29.090> bottom<00:02:29.420> of<00:02:29.570> that<00:02:29.690> because<00:02:29.870> they

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:29.960 
on the bottom of that because they

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.000 
on the bottom of that because they
weren't<00:02:30.110> leads<00:02:30.290> and<00:02:30.530> the<00:02:30.590> traction<00:02:30.860> control

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
weren't leads and the traction control

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.060 
weren't leads and the traction control
off<00:02:31.450> so<00:02:32.450> you<00:02:32.540> can't<00:02:32.750> have<00:02:32.810> a<00:02:32.870> proper<00:02:33.200> proper

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
off so you can't have a proper proper

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:40.160 
off so you can't have a proper proper
play

right<00:02:44.260> this<00:02:44.500> is<00:02:44.650> exactly<00:02:44.830> the<00:02:45.490> same<00:02:45.640> thing

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
right this is exactly the same thing

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.059 
right this is exactly the same thing
again<00:02:46.030> exactly<00:02:46.599> the<00:02:46.780> same<00:02:47.050> car<00:02:47.319> a<00:02:47.560> Carrera<00:02:47.860> S

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 
again exactly the same car a Carrera S

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:51.150 
again exactly the same car a Carrera S
but<00:02:48.580> with<00:02:49.090> Pirellis<00:02:49.840> 20-inch<00:02:50.410> winter<00:02:50.739> tire<00:02:50.950> on

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
but with Pirellis 20-inch winter tire on

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:57.580 
but with Pirellis 20-inch winter tire on
question<00:02:52.150> these<00:02:52.330> will<00:02:52.569> I<00:02:52.599> fall<00:02:52.959> straight<00:02:53.290> off

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.150 

Wow

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:06.830 

okay<00:03:02.160> I<00:03:02.810> know<00:03:03.810> this<00:03:03.960> is<00:03:04.260> a<00:03:04.290> Mitch<00:03:04.560> Lin<00:03:04.860> event<00:03:05.840> so

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
okay I know this is a Mitch Lin event so

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.470 
okay I know this is a Mitch Lin event so
there's<00:03:07.080> a<00:03:07.140> huge<00:03:07.440> factor<00:03:07.890> of<00:03:08.040> he<00:03:09.030> would<00:03:09.270> say

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
there's a huge factor of he would say

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.640 
there's a huge factor of he would say
that<00:03:09.690> wouldn't<00:03:09.900> he<00:03:10.130> but<00:03:11.130> here<00:03:11.520> it<00:03:11.610> is<00:03:11.760> a

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
that wouldn't he but here it is a

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.670 
that wouldn't he but here it is a
massive<00:03:13.650> difference<00:03:13.890> in<00:03:15.260> amount<00:03:16.260> of<00:03:16.380> grit

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
massive difference in amount of grit

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:23.120 
massive difference in amount of grit
that<00:03:17.640> this<00:03:17.820> car<00:03:18.120> now<00:03:18.540> doesn't<00:03:19.080> have<00:03:19.410> Oh<00:03:22.130> get

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
that this car now doesn't have Oh get

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.820 
that this car now doesn't have Oh get
out<00:03:23.250> walk<00:03:23.520> faster<00:03:24.150> than<00:03:24.300> this

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
out walk faster than this

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.740 
out walk faster than this
limey

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
limey

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.140 
limey
that's<00:03:27.350> uh<00:03:27.800> that's<00:03:28.130> quite<00:03:28.370> an<00:03:28.550> eye-opener

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
that's uh that's quite an eye-opener

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.870 
that's uh that's quite an eye-opener
Ashley<00:03:29.510> I<00:03:29.930> mean<00:03:30.620> they're<00:03:30.770> still<00:03:30.890> massively

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
Ashley I mean they're still massively

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.960 
Ashley I mean they're still massively
better<00:03:32.180> than<00:03:32.890> the<00:03:33.890> mystic<00:03:34.310> car<00:03:34.520> would<00:03:34.700> be<00:03:34.850> on

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
better than the mystic car would be on

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:42.100 
better than the mystic car would be on
summer<00:03:35.240> tires<00:03:35.510> no<00:03:36.380> question<00:03:36.710> about<00:03:36.740> that<00:03:36.920> but

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.110 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:44.470 

it's<00:03:42.650> just<00:03:42.920> nowhere<00:03:43.400> near<00:03:43.730> as<00:03:43.880> much<00:03:44.030> turning

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
it's just nowhere near as much turning

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.400 
it's just nowhere near as much turning
grip<00:03:44.900> there's<00:03:45.140> nowhere<00:03:45.470> near<00:03:45.680> as<00:03:45.770> much<00:03:45.800> break

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.309 

we're<00:03:50.410> near<00:03:50.590> as<00:03:50.680> much<00:03:50.860> crit<00:03:51.280> pulls<00:03:51.640> thought

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 
we're near as much crit pulls thought

00:03:52.319 --> 00:04:00.080 
we're near as much crit pulls thought
okay<00:03:53.319> point<00:03:53.860> to<00:03:54.010> proven<00:03:54.430> which<00:03:55.000> live<00:03:55.300> wins

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.880 

okay<00:04:01.090> so<00:04:01.569> we're<00:04:01.750> back<00:04:01.989> in<00:04:02.319> the<00:04:02.440> mid<00:04:02.620> Flynn

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
okay so we're back in the mid Flynn

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.580 
okay so we're back in the mid Flynn
again<00:04:03.340> just<00:04:04.300> to<00:04:04.390> see<00:04:04.599> how<00:04:05.230> big<00:04:05.470> the

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
again just to see how big the

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.630 
again just to see how big the
differences<00:04:06.120> and<00:04:07.120> in<00:04:07.360> the<00:04:07.450> first<00:04:07.720> corner<00:04:08.640> you

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
differences and in the first corner you

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.780 
differences and in the first corner you
can<00:04:09.790> feel<00:04:10.000> it

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
can feel it

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.500 
can feel it
actually<00:04:12.790> I<00:04:12.849> think<00:04:12.940> the<00:04:13.120> biggest<00:04:13.300> difference

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
actually I think the biggest difference

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:16.080 
actually I think the biggest difference
of<00:04:13.780> all<00:04:13.959> is<00:04:14.349> that<00:04:14.410> the<00:04:14.650> brakes<00:04:14.890> you<00:04:15.790> just<00:04:15.940> feel

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
of all is that the brakes you just feel

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.120 
of all is that the brakes you just feel
as<00:04:16.180> if<00:04:16.269> you've<00:04:16.419> got<00:04:16.600> another<00:04:16.870> ten<00:04:17.560> yards<00:04:18.040> in

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
as if you've got another ten yards in

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.789 
as if you've got another ten yards in
which<00:04:18.280> to<00:04:18.430> stop<00:04:18.669> it's<00:04:19.419> quite<00:04:19.959> incredible<00:04:20.169> how

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
which to stop it's quite incredible how

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:26.350 
which to stop it's quite incredible how
much<00:04:20.979> difference<00:04:22.530> tires<00:04:23.530> can<00:04:23.919> make

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.520 

I<00:04:26.419> mean<00:04:26.990> conditions<00:04:27.500> like<00:04:27.650> this<00:04:27.889> in<00:04:28.069> the<00:04:28.189> UK

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
I mean conditions like this in the UK

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.839 
I mean conditions like this in the UK
pretty<00:04:30.530> much<00:04:30.710> never<00:04:31.039> I<00:04:31.280> guess

00:04:31.839 --> 00:04:31.849 
pretty much never I guess

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:34.869 
pretty much never I guess
for<00:04:32.509> in<00:04:32.629> Germany<00:04:33.169> and<00:04:33.349> in<00:04:33.530> Latvia<00:04:34.009> and<00:04:34.340> in<00:04:34.490> all

00:04:34.869 --> 00:04:34.879 
for in Germany and in Latvia and in all

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:38.050 
for in Germany and in Latvia and in all
these<00:04:35.060> Eastern<00:04:35.419> European<00:04:35.870> countries<00:04:37.000> this<00:04:38.000> is

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
these Eastern European countries this is

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.939 
these Eastern European countries this is
a<00:04:38.180> regular<00:04:38.629> deal<00:04:38.840> conditions<00:04:39.620> like<00:04:39.770> this

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:39.949 
a regular deal conditions like this

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:42.820 
a regular deal conditions like this
hence<00:04:40.639> the<00:04:41.120> reason<00:04:41.300> that<00:04:41.840> winter<00:04:42.199> tire<00:04:42.439> sales

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
hence the reason that winter tire sales

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.640 
hence the reason that winter tire sales
in<00:04:43.129> the<00:04:43.340> last<00:04:43.580> three<00:04:44.120> years<00:04:44.229> have<00:04:45.229> increased

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
in the last three years have increased

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.570 
in the last three years have increased
by<00:04:45.889> 82%<00:04:47.319> that's<00:04:48.319> astonishing<00:04:48.680> I<00:04:49.219> mean<00:04:49.400> that's

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
by 82% that's astonishing I mean that's

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.010 
by 82% that's astonishing I mean that's
big<00:04:49.789> business<00:04:50.000> that's<00:04:50.569> why<00:04:50.689> we're<00:04:50.870> here

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.020 
big business that's why we're here

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.909 
big business that's why we're here
basically<00:04:52.990> but<00:04:53.990> it's<00:04:54.139> not<00:04:54.289> just<00:04:54.439> the<00:04:54.650> sort<00:04:54.860> of

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:54.919 
basically but it's not just the sort of

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:57.939 
basically but it's not just the sort of
cynical<00:04:55.189> marketing<00:04:55.729> exercise<00:04:56.180> at<00:04:56.360> all<00:04:56.949> these

00:04:57.939 --> 00:04:57.949 
cynical marketing exercise at all these

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:00.350 
cynical marketing exercise at all these
tires<00:04:58.250> keep

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
tires keep

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.050 
tires keep
I<00:05:00.419> guess<00:05:00.900> wealthy<00:05:01.530> owners<00:05:01.949> of<00:05:02.099> nice<00:05:02.340> cars<00:05:02.699> on

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
I guess wealthy owners of nice cars on

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.670 
I guess wealthy owners of nice cars on
the<00:05:03.210> road<00:05:03.389> and<00:05:03.689> out<00:05:03.750> of<00:05:03.900> the<00:05:03.960> undergrowth<00:05:04.319> and

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
the road and out of the undergrowth and

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.749 
the road and out of the undergrowth and
they<00:05:04.830> do<00:05:04.889> a<00:05:05.099> really<00:05:05.759> good<00:05:05.909> job<00:05:06.120> of<00:05:06.180> doing<00:05:06.539> so
