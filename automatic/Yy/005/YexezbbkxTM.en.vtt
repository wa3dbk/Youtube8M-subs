00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.920
 Hello everyone, I am RXSFAI. 

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:04.420
 Today is Tuesday 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:06.840
 It’s time to equip the series video. 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.460
 If you have equipment, I want to try it out and make a test. 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:14.380
 Can leave a message here or on my Facebook page 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:19.160
 I will randomly select the video for the next week. 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:25.820
 This time the equipment was provided by McNoc ArbiTer. 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.500
 His equipment list is very detailed, and the camouflage is also specified. 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.860
 So I decided to choose his equipment. 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.940
 The main weapon is M4, using holographic sights, laser sights, silencers, upright grips 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:46.120
 The pistol uses the M9 without any accessories, equipped with a medical kit, an electric shock, and equipped with attack skills. 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.920
 M4, the name of this gun, I don’t want to believe that everyone will be unfamiliar. 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.520
 And everyone will have a question when playing BF4. 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.720
 Why is the M4 in the BF4 semi-automatically launched instead of fully automatic? 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:03.500
 In fact, everyone often sees M4A1, not M4. 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.540
 The earliest M4 firing mode was semi-automatic 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.060
 But this early version of the M4 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.960
 Basically have been replaced by M4A1 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:19.140
 So strictly speaking, the M4 can’t be said to be the seal’s equipment. 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.740
 Say back to this M4. 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.520
 M4 is a kind of carbine rifle 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.940
 Its rate of fire and the initial velocity of the bullet also have a good performance. 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.240
 Hit 800 bullets per minute 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.060
 Bullet initial velocity is 580m per second 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.820
 It takes 1.85 seconds to replace the magazine and 2.4 seconds to use the entire magazine. 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.800
 M4 overall performance is very balanced 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.880
 Although no one performance is particularly good 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.520
 However, it can give you a very reliable feeling. 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:55.280
 So you don't have to worry about where the battle will be very weak. 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.920
 The most special place for M4 is semi-automatic emission. 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.220
 Because only three bullets can be played at a time 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.220
 And the maximum damage is only 25 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.940
 So even if it is close range, you have to hit twice to solve the enemy. 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.760
 A little bit of a loss in the close fire 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.400
 However, in the middle distance, it will save you a lot of bullets because of semi-automatic shooting. 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.720
 The grip of this equipment is an upright grip (comfort grip) 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.720
 But for the M4, the utility of the upright grip (comfort grip) is not that great. 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.240
 For a gun with a semi-automatic launch mode 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.880
 Every time you shoot, the first shot will determine the position of the next two shots and the position of the hit. 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.420
 So I would recommend that you use a right angle grip (folding grip) 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.020
 Because the function of the right angle grip (folding grip) is to reduce the recoil of the first shot. 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:53.100
 And the rear seat force of the first shot of the M4 is among the highest in all guns. 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.140
 So the right angle grip (folding grip) is very suitable for M4 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.940
 The choice of sight is not fixed 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.460
 You can use the same holographic sight as this netizen. 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.500
 Or use a coyote sight, the cobra scope can also 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.960
 However, I don’t recommend a 3.4 or 4 times mid-range sight. 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.760
 On the accessories of the barrel, although I personally like to install the silencer 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.800
 But if you don't like to use the mode of attacking the enemy 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.840
 In fact, it is best not to install any barrel fittings (can also be equipped with a matt) 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.200
 Because the most important recoil force for semi-automatic launch is on the first shot. 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.600
 Then the two recoils produced by the two shots will have only a small effect. 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.240
 So the role of the fire cap is not great. 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.740
 Of course, if you think that the back seat to the right is a bit too big 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:41.320
 You can install a brake to reduce the level of recoil 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.060
 In terms of skills, players who use [attack] skills should have quite a few 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.900
 The main reason is for the level 2 skills in the middle, raising the maximum number of bullets. 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.600
 Therefore, many players choose 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.460
 For players who have a silencer and plan to attack 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:01.120
 This skill is very practical 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.560
 Because of the sneak attack, there is a great chance that you will not have ammunition supplies. 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.440
 So when you don’t play, you can only pick up enemy equipment. 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.360
 But if you want to make it harder to find you 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.160
 Choosing [ghost] skills will be more suitable 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:16.720
 Let’s summarize it. 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.780
 The performance of the M4 gun is very balanced. 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.500
 No special advantages, no shortcomings 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.200
 So you always feel that M4 is a little bit short. 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.300
 When fighting at close range 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.680
 Due to semi-automatic performance, the situation of the cartridge often appears 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.180
 So a big chance to lose 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.020
 Old birds use M4, still ok 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.920
 However, if it is a newcomer with poor shooting accuracy 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.080
 Then his battle should be very fierce. 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.400
 Therefore, not many people choose M4 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.300
 I also don't recommend newbie selection. 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.940
 If you are an old bird, you can try M4. 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:00.860
 By chance, using this semi-automatic gun will have a good experience. 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.080
 I said it this time. 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:07.300
