00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:17.460
 my name is christian'm Knoblich 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:21.150
 active in the specialist area electrician electronics 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.310
 I am in love with bmw 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.199
 2004 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.210
 I am interface between mine 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.840
 faculty and verified 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:34.710
 conceptually means vehicle projects 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:38.190
 that i have the concept of air conditioning 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:41.250
 Energy electronics indicator conditions 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.930
 then the vehicle has to vote 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.530
 Project also at the right time for you 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.530
 can go 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.219
 Every customer can fish today 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.010
 company in the cars already 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:56.610
 experience the right and concrete 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.770
 next step is electromobility and 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.989
 this electromobility constitutes one 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.140
 huge revolution for the complete 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.140
 business 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.890
 I am sure that the bmw group 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.509
 in the revolution electromobility one 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.240
 play a very influential and active role 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:14.920
 and that's why I think that's it 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:19.539
 unbelievably exciting for him engineer 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:21.750
 is part of this formative revolution too 

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:21.750
 his 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.320
 we read more independently 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.750
 Vehicle manufacturers bring products 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.540
 this leads to innovation in the 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.640
 is crucial for 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.390
 the company's success that's great 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.640
 from engineer 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.740
 You can have such weird ideas 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.170
 they are never looked at obliquely 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.630
 means I have the bmw group so far as 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:55.140
 very open company perceived 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:02:00.270
 which is quite plugged back sometimes there 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:01.860
 to get every impulse around and that 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.899
 the employee in the regard there as well 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.840
 so focus is ultimately there 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:09.319
 Also, that these innovations too 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.319
 Then come 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.980
 my name is laura brand i work in 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.330
 the development of the bmw group in the 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.330
 project e mobility 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:22.609
 We go to different fields 

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:24.620
 to and across sites sure that 

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:26.810
 the injured functions that developed 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.969
 are consistent with each other , it is just for 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:33.139
 customers a total networked offer 

00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:34.609
 functionalities in the vehicle gives if 

00:02:33.139 --> 00:02:36.859
 now for example on the active e 

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:40.489
 then look at the innsbrucker 

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:43.609
 the loading function that means how can I 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:45.739
 also the loading time and according to the 

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:47.829
 Customers also comfortable load 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:47.829
 enable 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.849
 basically at bmw so is us 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.430
 no matter where we work is white 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:57.919
 particularly strong matches, it is 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.790
 the fascination for products and the 

00:02:57.919 --> 00:03:00.739
 you also notice in everyday life 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.739
 Working together means that counts for us 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:05.150
 the result and accordingly becomes him 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:07.099
 still purposefully working towards it 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.909
 for the customer the best possible product 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:09.909
 to develop 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.569
 at bmw we already have almost 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:19.090
 centenary product history 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:20.959
 accordingly one has also there 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.120
 an incredible number of development steps 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:24.769
 that you can follow with us we were 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.750
 even in very early years 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:28.790
 area of ​​electromobility active and 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.669
 pascal related to electromobility 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.019
 it is crucial of one day 

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:33.979
 to learn what in the 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:35.750
 was past 

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:37.790
 and that is exactly what they are 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.949
 exciting in everyday work because we 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.419
 Exactly know we will always be one 

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:44.319
 step forward and we will 

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:47.319
 always also future technologies 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:47.319
 develop 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:54.200
 my name is tobias bona i am since 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:56.330
 2004 100 mw group active 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.250
 i am rich development new 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:01.670
 technologies for the topic of hydrogen 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:03.700
 and fuel cell to introduce the new 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.930
 technologies include the future ones 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.090
 Key technologies in an automobile 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.160
 In the future, these include in particular 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.260
 the theme lightweight construction the theme 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:16.519
 electrification and hydrogen and 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:19.489
 fuel cell enthusiasm belongs 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:21.139
 actually to the engineer giant and 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:23.450
 drives us at bmw and group of 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:25.250
 Strong on our paths are short 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.750
 that means innovations that we have 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.910
 are implemented very fast as 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.130
 So you can already find engineers in the 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:34.810
 next vehicle generation on 10 was 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:34.810
 arrived from your ideas 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.520
 Close contact is the ability to work in a team 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.950
 a decisive factor for us 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.540
 we do not just love consensus but 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:46.730
 also the sense that means we sit down 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:50.950
 apart but always in the sense of one 

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:50.950
 solve constructive best possible
