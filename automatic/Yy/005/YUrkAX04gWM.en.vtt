big<00:02:15.239> big<00:02:16.220> focus<00:02:17.220> on<00:02:17.370> my<00:02:17.459> deadlift<00:02:17.760> now

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
big big focus on my deadlift now

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.729 
big big focus on my deadlift now
although<00:02:18.690> i'm<00:02:18.840> not<00:02:18.870> going<00:02:19.170> to<00:02:19.230> change<00:02:19.440> how<00:02:19.709> i

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
although i'm not going to change how i

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.050 
although i'm not going to change how i
do<00:02:19.920> it<00:02:20.040> too<00:02:20.190> much<00:02:20.370> because<00:02:20.519> i<00:02:20.640> don't<00:02:20.820> believe

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
do it too much because i don't believe

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.789 
do it too much because i don't believe
you<00:02:21.120> can<00:02:21.329> deadlift<00:02:21.660> heavy<00:02:21.959> twice<00:02:22.290> a<00:02:22.320> week<00:02:22.590> or

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799 
you can deadlift heavy twice a week or

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:24.229 
you can deadlift heavy twice a week or
you<00:02:23.340> know<00:02:23.400> you're<00:02:23.549> probably<00:02:23.760> could<00:02:24.000> but<00:02:24.180> I

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
you know you're probably could but I

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.630 
you know you're probably could but I
don't<00:02:24.269> believe<00:02:24.720> is<00:02:25.100> that's<00:02:26.100> a<00:02:26.220> great<00:02:26.400> plan

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
don't believe is that's a great plan

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.220 
don't believe is that's a great plan
what<00:02:26.970> I'm<00:02:27.060> going<00:02:27.209> to<00:02:27.239> do<00:02:27.420> is<00:02:27.570> introduce<00:02:27.780> a

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
what I'm going to do is introduce a

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.830 
what I'm going to do is introduce a
speed<00:02:28.890> day<00:02:29.130> so<00:02:29.190> this<00:02:29.880> will<00:02:30.150> be<00:02:30.239> my<00:02:30.450> regular

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
speed day so this will be my regular

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.390 
speed day so this will be my regular
deadlift<00:02:31.230> day<00:02:31.380> as<00:02:31.620> it's<00:02:31.980> always<00:02:32.070> been<00:02:32.190> the

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
deadlift day as it's always been the

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.830 
deadlift day as it's always been the
case<00:02:32.600> and<00:02:33.600> I'll<00:02:33.720> do<00:02:33.900> this<00:02:34.079> followed<00:02:34.410> by

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
case and I'll do this followed by

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.060 
case and I'll do this followed by
stiff-legged<00:02:36.840> deadlift<00:02:37.350> probably<00:02:37.709> babies<00:02:37.980> in

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
stiff-legged deadlift probably babies in

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.039 
stiff-legged deadlift probably babies in
deficit<00:02:38.430> work<00:02:38.640> and<00:02:38.940> some<00:02:39.480> other<00:02:39.630> stuff<00:02:39.660> and

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
deficit work and some other stuff and

then in the other session the other the
second<00:02:42.450> squat<00:02:42.780> session<00:02:43.049> on<00:02:43.109> the<00:02:43.200> friday<00:02:43.410> i'll

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
second squat session on the friday i'll

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.880 
second squat session on the friday i'll
do<00:02:44.489> some<00:02:44.970> speed<00:02:45.630> deadlift<00:02:46.140> so<00:02:46.260> five<00:02:46.500> sets<00:02:46.799> of

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
do some speed deadlift so five sets of

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.680 
do some speed deadlift so five sets of
three<00:02:47.130> very<00:02:47.400> light<00:02:47.609> just<00:02:48.180> trying<00:02:48.450> to<00:02:48.510> move<00:02:48.630> the

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
three very light just trying to move the

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.170 
three very light just trying to move the
bar<00:02:48.989> as<00:02:49.140> fast<00:02:49.470> as<00:02:49.709> I<00:02:49.799> physically<00:02:50.250> can<00:02:50.549> because

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
bar as fast as I physically can because

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.580 
bar as fast as I physically can because
I<00:02:51.299> feel<00:02:51.540> like<00:02:51.690> I'm<00:02:51.900> when<00:02:52.049> I<00:02:52.109> feel<00:02:52.260> like<00:02:52.319> I<00:02:52.410> am

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
I feel like I'm when I feel like I am

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.020 
I feel like I'm when I feel like I am
week<00:02:52.829> off<00:02:52.980> before<00:02:53.010> I<00:02:53.310> think<00:02:53.579> that's<00:02:53.730> partly

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
week off before I think that's partly

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.150 
week off before I think that's partly
because<00:02:54.120> I'm<00:02:54.359> not<00:02:54.540> I'm<00:02:55.440> not<00:02:55.500> recruiting<00:02:56.069> those

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
because I'm not I'm not recruiting those

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.680 
because I'm not I'm not recruiting those
fibers<00:02:56.609> quickly<00:02:56.910> enough<00:02:57.120> so<00:02:57.239> it's<00:02:57.359> taking<00:02:57.480> me

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
fibers quickly enough so it's taking me

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.150 
fibers quickly enough so it's taking me
a<00:02:57.750> long<00:02:57.900> time<00:02:58.140> to<00:02:58.200> get<00:02:58.380> the<00:02:58.500> bar<00:02:58.650> moving<00:02:58.859> so<00:02:59.069> if

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
a long time to get the bar moving so if

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.500 
a long time to get the bar moving so if
I<00:02:59.220> can<00:02:59.400> get<00:02:59.489> everything<00:02:59.760> going<00:03:00.090> really<00:03:00.269> quick

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
I can get everything going really quick

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.449 
I can get everything going really quick
hopefully<00:03:00.720> it's<00:03:00.989> going<00:03:01.109> to<00:03:01.200> help<00:03:01.290> added<00:03:02.190> with

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
hopefully it's going to help added with

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:03.740 
hopefully it's going to help added with
the<00:03:02.489> other<00:03:02.760> things<00:03:03.000> I've<00:03:03.180> changing<00:03:03.540> so<00:03:03.660> we'll

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
the other things I've changing so we'll

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.770 
the other things I've changing so we'll
see<00:03:03.900> what<00:03:03.959> happens<00:03:04.049> anyway<00:03:04.799> I<00:03:05.419> mean<00:03:06.419> I<00:03:06.479> felt

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
see what happens anyway I mean I felt

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.509 
see what happens anyway I mean I felt
strongly<00:03:07.049> I<00:03:07.260> mean<00:03:07.470> in<00:03:07.560> this<00:03:08.010> session<00:03:08.160> I<00:03:08.310> felt

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
strongly I mean in this session I felt

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:10.039 
strongly I mean in this session I felt
pretty<00:03:08.760> good<00:03:08.940> in<00:03:09.120> terms<00:03:09.299> of<00:03:09.510> the<00:03:09.660> fire<00:03:09.870> was

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
pretty good in terms of the fire was

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:12.259 
pretty good in terms of the fire was
moving<00:03:10.350> where<00:03:10.500> I<00:03:10.530> felt<00:03:10.769> strong<00:03:11.070> I<00:03:11.310> was<00:03:11.880> just<00:03:12.060> in

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
moving where I felt strong I was just in

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:13.759 
moving where I felt strong I was just in
so<00:03:12.510> much<00:03:12.540> paint<00:03:12.959> everything<00:03:13.260> was<00:03:13.470> that<00:03:13.620> much

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
so much paint everything was that much

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:17.920 
so much paint everything was that much
harder<00:03:13.949> the<00:03:14.519> other<00:03:14.699> issue<00:03:14.850> I<00:03:15.030> have<00:03:15.299> is<00:03:15.540> that

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.969 

again<00:03:18.930> I<00:03:18.959> haven't<00:03:19.290> done<00:03:19.380> this<00:03:19.530> volume<00:03:19.829> for<00:03:19.949> a

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:19.979 
again I haven't done this volume for a

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:21.439 
again I haven't done this volume for a
while<00:03:20.130> so<00:03:20.310> my<00:03:20.430> grip<00:03:20.639> was<00:03:20.820> failing<00:03:21.030> a<00:03:21.180> little

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:21.449 
while so my grip was failing a little

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:25.250 
while so my grip was failing a little
bit<00:03:21.600> plus<00:03:22.380> I<00:03:22.680> used<00:03:23.370> bumper<00:03:23.940> plates<00:03:24.169> and<00:03:25.169> it

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
bit plus I used bumper plates and it

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.629 
bit plus I used bumper plates and it
didn't<00:03:25.500> occur<00:03:25.739> to<00:03:25.769> me<00:03:25.979> that<00:03:26.070> obviously<00:03:26.519> they

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:26.639 
didn't occur to me that obviously they

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:28.009 
didn't occur to me that obviously they
bounce<00:03:26.910> a<00:03:27.120> lot<00:03:27.209> more<00:03:27.419> than<00:03:27.540> what<00:03:27.690> I'm<00:03:27.750> used<00:03:27.780> to

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
bounce a lot more than what I'm used to

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:29.420 
bounce a lot more than what I'm used to
so<00:03:28.229> every<00:03:28.410> time<00:03:28.440> I<00:03:28.560> was<00:03:28.709> slamming<00:03:29.190> the<00:03:29.280> bar

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
so every time I was slamming the bar

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.340 
so every time I was slamming the bar
down<00:03:29.639> it<00:03:29.729> was<00:03:29.790> bouncing<00:03:30.389> all<00:03:30.930> over<00:03:31.169> the<00:03:31.260> place

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
down it was bouncing all over the place

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:32.930 
down it was bouncing all over the place
and<00:03:31.590> I<00:03:31.650> had<00:03:31.799> to<00:03:31.919> keep<00:03:32.070> resetting<00:03:32.549> which<00:03:32.820> was

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
and I had to keep resetting which was

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.629 
and I had to keep resetting which was
pretty<00:03:33.120> annoying<00:03:33.540> so<00:03:34.229> note<00:03:35.100> to<00:03:35.130> self<00:03:35.459> don't

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:35.639 
pretty annoying so note to self don't

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:37.849 
pretty annoying so note to self don't
use<00:03:36.060> bumper<00:03:36.479> plates<00:03:36.600> what<00:03:37.350> he<00:03:37.410> did<00:03:37.530> a<00:03:37.590> sense<00:03:37.769> of

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
use bumper plates what he did a sense of

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:40.490 
use bumper plates what he did a sense of
five<00:03:38.150> anyway<00:03:39.150> I<00:03:39.180> got<00:03:39.419> those<00:03:39.600> done<00:03:39.870> it<00:03:40.139> sucks

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
five anyway I got those done it sucks

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.640 
five anyway I got those done it sucks
but<00:03:41.400> that<00:03:41.549> was<00:03:41.669> that<00:03:41.820> I<00:03:41.970> then<00:03:42.359> SAT<00:03:43.019> around<00:03:43.470> for

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
but that was that I then SAT around for

00:05:32.459 --> 00:05:32.469 
has gone up by about 50 kilos in the

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:33.809

time and my deadlifts gone up by about
10<00:05:34.389> kilo<00:05:34.749> so<00:05:34.929> obviously<00:05:35.229> there's<00:05:35.409> a<00:05:35.469> big<00:05:35.709> no

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:36.449 
10 kilo so obviously there's a big no

10 kilo so obviously there's a big no
kind<00:05:37.449> of<00:05:39.059> deficit<00:05:40.059> to<00:05:40.209> make<00:05:40.360> up<00:05:40.509> there<00:05:40.719> anyway
