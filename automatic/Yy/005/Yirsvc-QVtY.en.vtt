hey<00:00:15.619> i'm<00:00:15.860> here<00:00:16.129> at<00:00:16.250> the<00:00:16.430> european<00:00:17.270> astronaut

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:17.539 
hey i'm here at the european astronaut

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:19.720 
hey i'm here at the european astronaut
center<00:00:17.840> together<00:00:18.230> with<00:00:18.500> Elizabeth<00:00:19.340> one<00:00:19.610> of

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:19.730 
center together with Elizabeth one of

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:21.820 
center together with Elizabeth one of
our<00:00:19.820> astronaut<00:00:20.330> trainers<00:00:20.750> there's<00:00:21.350> less<00:00:21.619> than

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:21.830 
our astronaut trainers there's less than

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.550 
our astronaut trainers there's less than
six<00:00:22.100> months<00:00:22.250> now<00:00:22.520> until<00:00:22.850> launch<00:00:23.320> I'm<00:00:24.320> still

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:24.560 
six months now until launch I'm still

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.320 
six months now until launch I'm still
doing<00:00:24.650> a<00:00:24.770> lot<00:00:24.890> of<00:00:24.950> training<00:00:25.250> on<00:00:25.520> Soyuz<00:00:26.300> and

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:26.330 
doing a lot of training on Soyuz and

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.720 
doing a lot of training on Soyuz and
Space<00:00:26.690> Station<00:00:27.140> but<00:00:28.040> now<00:00:28.160> the<00:00:28.220> training<00:00:28.640> is

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
Space Station but now the training is

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.580 
Space Station but now the training is
also<00:00:29.000> getting<00:00:29.180> more<00:00:29.450> focused<00:00:29.930> on<00:00:30.080> some<00:00:30.440> of<00:00:30.500> the

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:30.590 
also getting more focused on some of the

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.619 
also getting more focused on some of the
experiments<00:00:31.010> that<00:00:31.220> are<00:00:31.370> till<00:00:31.730> you<00:00:31.850> doing<00:00:32.270> in

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:32.629 
experiments that are till you doing in

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:34.660 
experiments that are till you doing in
space<00:00:33.020> on<00:00:33.260> board<00:00:33.559> the<00:00:33.770> International<00:00:34.610> Space

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
space on board the International Space

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.209 
space on board the International Space
Station<00:00:35.270> a<00:00:35.450> lot<00:00:36.289> of<00:00:36.379> the<00:00:36.469> work<00:00:36.620> that<00:00:36.800> we<00:00:36.860> do<00:00:37.010> is

00:00:37.209 --> 00:00:37.219 
Station a lot of the work that we do is

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:40.209 
Station a lot of the work that we do is
focused<00:00:37.640> on<00:00:37.820> human<00:00:38.030> physiology<00:00:38.480> and<00:00:39.100> not<00:00:40.100> only

00:00:40.209 --> 00:00:40.219 
focused on human physiology and not only

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:41.770 
focused on human physiology and not only
to<00:00:40.489> understand<00:00:40.909> what<00:00:41.089> happens<00:00:41.449> to<00:00:41.659> the

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
to understand what happens to the

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.899 
to understand what happens to the
astronauts<00:00:42.170> in<00:00:42.320> space<00:00:42.350> but<00:00:42.739> also<00:00:42.859> how<00:00:43.609> that

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:43.909 
astronauts in space but also how that

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:47.439 
astronauts in space but also how that
applies<00:00:44.749> to<00:00:45.140> humans<00:00:45.499> here<00:00:45.890> on<00:00:46.129> earth<00:00:46.609> and<00:00:46.909> one

00:00:47.439 --> 00:00:47.449 
applies to humans here on earth and one

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:49.119 
applies to humans here on earth and one
of<00:00:47.480> the<00:00:47.629> really<00:00:48.050> interesting<00:00:48.260> experiments

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:49.129 
of the really interesting experiments

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:50.739 
of the really interesting experiments
that<00:00:49.190> I'll<00:00:49.370> be<00:00:49.489> working<00:00:49.909> with<00:00:50.239> involves

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:50.749 
that I'll be working with involves

00:00:50.749 --> 00:00:53.020 
that I'll be working with involves
endothelium<00:00:51.499> cells<00:00:51.800> and<00:00:52.100> that's<00:00:52.729> what<00:00:52.909> i'm

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
endothelium cells and that's what i'm

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.540 
endothelium cells and that's what i'm
here<00:00:53.960> with<00:00:54.140> Elizabeth<00:00:54.649> today<00:00:54.859> and<00:00:55.159> alert<00:00:55.339> some

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
here with Elizabeth today and alert some

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.180 
here with Elizabeth today and alert some
more<00:00:55.729> about<00:00:56.149> that<00:00:56.449> in<00:00:56.659> the<00:00:56.690> actual<00:00:57.190> experiment

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
more about that in the actual experiment

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.459 
more about that in the actual experiment
so<00:00:58.609> it<00:00:58.879> really<00:00:59.210> sells<00:00:59.539> ourselves<00:01:00.109> that<00:01:00.350> are

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:00.469 
so it really sells ourselves that are

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:02.200 
so it really sells ourselves that are
aligning<00:01:00.800> all<00:01:01.129> your<00:01:01.399> caddy<00:01:01.609> vessel<00:01:02.030> other

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
aligning all your caddy vessel other

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.539 
aligning all your caddy vessel other
vessels<00:01:02.629> so<00:01:03.469> there<00:01:03.649> are<00:01:03.769> some<00:01:03.920> of<00:01:04.070> the<00:01:04.190> barrier

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:04.549 
vessels so there are some of the barrier

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:07.539 
vessels so there are some of the barrier
between<00:01:05.030> Bloods<00:01:05.630> and<00:01:05.930> the<00:01:05.960> tissues<00:01:06.530> and<00:01:06.710> that

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:07.549 
between Bloods and the tissues and that

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:09.760 
between Bloods and the tissues and that
location<00:01:08.060> they<00:01:08.270> have<00:01:08.479> very<00:01:08.930> bright<00:01:09.440> your

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
location they have very bright your

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.890 
location they have very bright your
functions<00:01:10.220> most<00:01:10.940> important<00:01:11.450> ones<00:01:11.600> is<00:01:11.840> the

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 
functions most important ones is the

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.510 
functions most important ones is the
filter<00:01:12.410> function<00:01:12.830> so<00:01:13.130> the<00:01:13.340> endothelium

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
filter function so the endothelium

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.840 
filter function so the endothelium
serves<00:01:14.390> as<00:01:14.630> a<00:01:14.690> gatekeeper<00:01:15.310> so<00:01:16.310> inta<00:01:16.580> size

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
serves as a gatekeeper so inta size

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.880 
serves as a gatekeeper so inta size
which<00:01:17.180> of<00:01:17.360> the<00:01:17.450> substances<00:01:18.110> are<00:01:18.350> allowed<00:01:18.710> to

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
which of the substances are allowed to

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.890 
which of the substances are allowed to
travel<00:01:19.160> from<00:01:19.520> the<00:01:19.580> blood<00:01:19.910> to<00:01:20.180> the<00:01:20.210> tissue<00:01:20.510> or

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
travel from the blood to the tissue or

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.680 
travel from the blood to the tissue or
the<00:01:21.140> other<00:01:21.290> way<00:01:21.440> around<00:01:22.120> so<00:01:23.120> specifically

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:23.690 
the other way around so specifically

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.830 
the other way around so specifically
what<00:01:24.160> I'm<00:01:25.160> going<00:01:25.760> to<00:01:25.790> be<00:01:25.910> looking<00:01:26.030> at<00:01:26.330> during<00:01:26.690> a

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
what I'm going to be looking at during a

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.340 
what I'm going to be looking at during a
this<00:01:27.440> experiment<00:01:28.010> in<00:01:28.250> space<00:01:29.080> maybe<00:01:30.080> the

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
this experiment in space maybe the

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:31.810 
this experiment in space maybe the
scientists<00:01:30.800> are<00:01:30.890> looking<00:01:31.160> at<00:01:31.460> different

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
scientists are looking at different

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.690 
scientists are looking at different
things<00:01:32.080> one<00:01:33.080> of<00:01:33.110> that<00:01:33.380> is<00:01:33.560> the<00:01:33.860> cell<00:01:34.070> cycle<00:01:34.280> so

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
things one of that is the cell cycle so

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.310 
things one of that is the cell cycle so
they<00:01:34.820> want<00:01:35.060> to<00:01:35.150> understand<00:01:35.750> if<00:01:36.020> there<00:01:36.200> are

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
they want to understand if there are

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.790 
they want to understand if there are
differences<00:01:36.890> in<00:01:37.130> how<00:01:37.610> cells<00:01:38.150> will<00:01:38.480> divide<00:01:38.800> in

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:39.800 
differences in how cells will divide in

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.530 
differences in how cells will divide in
space<00:01:40.130> compared<00:01:40.610> to<00:01:40.670> on<00:01:40.790> ground<00:01:41.090> space

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
space compared to on ground space

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.050 
space compared to on ground space
compared<00:01:42.020> to<00:01:42.050> on<00:01:42.200> ground<00:01:42.470> and<00:01:42.820> they're<00:01:43.820> also

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
compared to on ground and they're also

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.750 
compared to on ground and they're also
looking<00:01:44.390> at<00:01:44.780> the<00:01:45.080> at<00:01:45.620> the<00:01:45.680> product<00:01:46.220> of<00:01:46.370> a<00:01:46.520> cell

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:46.760 
looking at the at the product of a cell

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.060 
looking at the at the product of a cell
for<00:01:47.090> example<00:01:47.500> usually<00:01:48.500> cells<00:01:48.740> produce

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
for example usually cells produce

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.980 
for example usually cells produce
proteins<00:01:49.790> and<00:01:50.030> I<00:01:50.270> want<00:01:50.480> to<00:01:50.510> see<00:01:50.720> if<00:01:50.900> that

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
proteins and I want to see if that

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.320 
proteins and I want to see if that
changes<00:01:51.680> on<00:01:51.890> board<00:01:52.190> if<00:01:52.400> different<00:01:53.030> party

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
changes on board if different party

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.750 
changes on board if different party
means<00:01:53.450> are<00:01:53.690> produced<00:01:54.200> or<00:01:54.740> if<00:01:55.130> the<00:01:55.250> production

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:55.760 
means are produced or if the production

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.460 
means are produced or if the production
pathway<00:01:56.240> is<00:01:56.330> different<00:01:56.750> so<00:01:56.870> if<00:01:57.020> different

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
pathway is different so if different

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.710 
pathway is different so if different
genes<00:01:57.740> are<00:01:58.040> used<00:01:58.280> as<00:01:58.490> a<00:01:58.520> recipe<00:01:59.060> for<00:01:59.420> the<00:01:59.510> same

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
genes are used as a recipe for the same

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.350 
genes are used as a recipe for the same
kind<00:02:00.350> of<00:02:00.500> party<00:02:00.800> so<00:02:01.010> the<00:02:01.310> genes<00:02:01.940> express

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
kind of party so the genes express

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.970 
kind of party so the genes express
themselves<00:02:02.900> differently<00:02:03.080> in<00:02:03.590> weightlessness

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:03.980 
themselves differently in weightlessness

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.460 
themselves differently in weightlessness
compared<00:02:04.520> to<00:02:04.610> ground<00:02:04.880> exactly<00:02:05.540> and<00:02:06.170> to<00:02:06.350> do

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
compared to ground exactly and to do

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.669 
compared to ground exactly and to do
this<00:02:06.620> will<00:02:06.860> be<00:02:07.040> using<00:02:07.250> cubic<00:02:07.790> which<00:02:08.000> is<00:02:08.149> a

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
this will be using cubic which is a

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:10.979 
this will be using cubic which is a
stand-alone<00:02:09.429> payload<00:02:10.030> that<00:02:10.060> we<00:02:10.329> can<00:02:10.569> deploy

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
stand-alone payload that we can deploy

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:14.550 
stand-alone payload that we can deploy
in<00:02:11.560> Columbus<00:02:12.129> and<00:02:12.510> want<00:02:13.510> to<00:02:13.540> show<00:02:13.689> gilligan's

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
in Columbus and want to show gilligan's

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.550 
in Columbus and want to show gilligan's
incubators<00:02:15.340> we<00:02:15.670> can<00:02:16.000> warm<00:02:16.390> up<00:02:16.629> in<00:02:16.870> Tierra<00:02:17.200> or

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
incubators we can warm up in Tierra or

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:18.959 
incubators we can warm up in Tierra or
you<00:02:17.650> can<00:02:17.829> pull<00:02:18.040> it<00:02:18.189> down<00:02:18.340> depending<00:02:18.640> on<00:02:18.849> what

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:18.969 
you can pull it down depending on what

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:21.599 
you can pull it down depending on what
you<00:02:19.120> do<00:02:19.239> since<00:02:19.750> we<00:02:19.930> are<00:02:20.049> using<00:02:20.109> human<00:02:20.980> cells<00:02:21.250> we

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:21.609 
you do since we are using human cells we

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:23.099 
you do since we are using human cells we
want<00:02:21.790> to<00:02:21.879> have<00:02:21.969> body<00:02:22.209> temperatures<00:02:22.780> so<00:02:22.810> we

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:23.109 
want to have body temperatures so we

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:26.250 
want to have body temperatures so we
will<00:02:23.260> heat<00:02:23.469> it<00:02:23.500> up<00:02:23.709> to<00:02:24.069> 37<00:02:24.730> degrees<00:02:25.019> and<00:02:26.019> it

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
will heat it up to 37 degrees and it

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.349 
will heat it up to 37 degrees and it
also<00:02:26.409> has<00:02:26.530> a<00:02:26.680> centrifuge<00:02:27.489> rights<00:02:27.790> and<00:02:28.120> a<00:02:28.150> huge

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:28.359 
also has a centrifuge rights and a huge

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:30.569 
also has a centrifuge rights and a huge
in<00:02:28.599> there<00:02:28.840> that<00:02:29.230> we<00:02:29.319> can<00:02:29.500> have<00:02:29.620> a1g<00:02:29.950> reference

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:30.579 
in there that we can have a1g reference

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:33.000 
in there that we can have a1g reference
and<00:02:31.150> that<00:02:31.329> kind<00:02:31.599> of<00:02:31.629> functions<00:02:31.989> as<00:02:32.139> a<00:02:32.590> control

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
and that kind of functions as a control

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.190 
and that kind of functions as a control
so<00:02:33.219> we<00:02:33.340> can<00:02:33.370> see<00:02:33.730> how<00:02:34.269> weightlessness<00:02:34.719> affects

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
so we can see how weightlessness affects

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.500 
so we can see how weightlessness affects
it<00:02:35.409> and<00:02:35.590> compare<00:02:36.310> it<00:02:36.400> to<00:02:36.609> samples<00:02:37.359> that<00:02:37.480> are

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
it and compare it to samples that are

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.899 
it and compare it to samples that are
not<00:02:37.870> weightless<00:02:38.109> exactly<00:02:38.920> and<00:02:39.310> the<00:02:39.489> samples

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:39.909 
not weightless exactly and the samples

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:41.970 
not weightless exactly and the samples
are<00:02:40.090> the<00:02:40.420> are<00:02:40.659> in<00:02:41.139> these<00:02:41.260> small<00:02:41.500> containers

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
are the are in these small containers

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.800 
are the are in these small containers
you<00:02:42.099> have<00:02:42.280> here<00:02:42.549> so<00:02:42.909> each<00:02:43.120> container<00:02:43.569> will

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
you have here so each container will

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.369 
you have here so each container will
have<00:02:44.079> the<00:02:44.829> endothelial<00:02:45.639> cells<00:02:46.169> already<00:02:47.169> with

00:02:47.369 --> 00:02:47.379 
have the endothelial cells already with

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:49.710 
have the endothelial cells already with
all<00:02:47.620> the<00:02:47.769> fixative<00:02:48.459> Zand<00:02:48.760> the<00:02:48.849> the<00:02:49.329> culture

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
all the fixative Zand the the culture

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.420 
all the fixative Zand the the culture
medium<00:02:50.200> that<00:02:50.560> they<00:02:50.680> will<00:02:50.829> be<00:02:50.859> growing<00:02:51.280> in

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
medium that they will be growing in

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.670 
medium that they will be growing in
exactly<00:02:52.090> so<00:02:52.480> in<00:02:52.689> here<00:02:52.930> where<00:02:53.139> the<00:02:53.319> cells<00:02:53.530> and

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
exactly so in here where the cells and

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.319 
exactly so in here where the cells and
everything<00:02:54.040> that<00:02:54.159> they<00:02:54.280> need<00:02:54.310> to<00:02:54.639> survive<00:02:54.819> and

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:55.329 
everything that they need to survive and

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:57.690 
everything that they need to survive and
that<00:02:55.540> later<00:02:55.810> on<00:02:55.900> to<00:02:56.200> these<00:02:56.319> tix<00:02:56.620> answers<00:02:57.099> or

transport all right and those equipment

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.179 
transport all right and those equipment
containers<00:03:01.450> will<00:03:01.719> go<00:03:01.870> into<00:03:02.079> the<00:03:02.579> into<00:03:03.579> cubic

00:03:05.179 --> 00:03:05.189 
containers will go into the into cubic

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:12.030 
containers will go into the into cubic
either<00:03:06.189> go<00:03:06.459> on<00:03:06.730> static<00:03:07.150> positions<00:03:10.859> all<00:03:11.859> they

either go on static positions all they

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.819 
either go on static positions all they
will<00:03:12.189> sit<00:03:12.400> on<00:03:12.459> this<00:03:12.609> indication<00:03:16.500> all<00:03:17.500> right<00:03:17.680> to

will sit on this indication all right to

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:21.599 
will sit on this indication all right to
mimic<00:03:18.159> a<00:03:18.400> 1g<00:03:19.120> environment<00:03:20.099> all<00:03:21.099> right<00:03:21.370> well

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:21.609 
mimic a 1g environment all right well

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:23.369 
mimic a 1g environment all right well
i'm<00:03:21.909> looking<00:03:22.209> forward<00:03:22.359> to<00:03:22.510> performing<00:03:23.079> this

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:23.379 
i'm looking forward to performing this

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:24.449 
i'm looking forward to performing this
experiment<00:03:23.769> it<00:03:24.069> should<00:03:24.250> be<00:03:24.340> interesting

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
experiment it should be interesting

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:25.830 
experiment it should be interesting
hopefully<00:03:25.090> we'll<00:03:25.269> get<00:03:25.359> some<00:03:25.569> good<00:03:25.689> results

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
hopefully we'll get some good results

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.570 
hopefully we'll get some good results
