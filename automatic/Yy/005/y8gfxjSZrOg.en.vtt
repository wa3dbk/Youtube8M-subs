00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:10.380
 argon 18 slowly introduces you by the 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:12.349
 founding philosophy of design seen from 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.120
 the manufacture of all bicycles 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:17.130
 based on 25 years of experience and 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.230
 a solid expertise in R &amp; D 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.820
 this philosophy today the 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.119
 brand reputation 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.609
 argon 18 in our quest for balance 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.519
 perfect we knew how to combine rigidity 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.610
 comfort and lightness in one set 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.340
 consistent his qualities usually 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.960
 conflictual work here of father for 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.110
 do you have an experience of the 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.850
 unique feeling argon 18 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.360
 this is the secret of the recipe 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.360
 perfect 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.440
 these past two decades have allowed 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.390
 to our r &amp; d team to participate 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.789
 actively to the evolution of the industry 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.710
 cycling and innovating in many 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.410
 domains which has earned him several 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.829
 Awards and Recognition 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.570
 these successes and the invaluable experience 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:06.060
 cargo 18 year old withdraw allowed us 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.150
 to achieve excellence in design and 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.729
 making a bike to be 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.790
 performing the entire crossroads must 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.660
 have optimal rigidity if this one 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.580
 is too rigid 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.590
 the cyclist will then have to deploy a 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.690
 additional effort and will lose in 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.040
 performing 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.380
 we are also on and that the 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.690
 rigidity evening part of actively 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.910
 on our cable farms africa there 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:33.270
 exists as much as a uniform whole there 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:35.820
 to be effective 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.070
 the whole crossroads must also be the 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.630
 more people possible a bike whose 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.420
 lightness is at the expense of the 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.660
 rigidity or comfort will not offer 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.220
 their performances a light bike it's 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.229
 a more maneuverable bike in the 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.800
 climbs and then live in the 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.830
 starts to be successful 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:57.780
 the entire frame fouche must finally be 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:02:00.210
 comfortable how comfort is the 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.160
 performance guarantee for the cyclist 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.950
 having already lived the experience of a bike 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.910
 poorly designed and tiredness felt at the 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.750
 lead a long hike 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:11.700
 the answer goes without saying so the degree of 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.610
 satisfaction during your outings goes from 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.950
 pair with comfort level 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.930
 whether you are a regional champion or 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.940
 weekend hikers you 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.390
 enjoy the qualities of the optimum 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:28.430
 bounce whatever without exception the 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.430
 bike jumped him that you choose 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:38.660
 will you have the other word band 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.660
 will you have the unique argon feel 18
