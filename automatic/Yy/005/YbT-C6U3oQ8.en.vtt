hair with it being so waving so thick

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.110 
hair with it being so waving so thick
and<00:02:19.410> dry<00:02:19.800> what<00:02:20.430> we're<00:02:20.550> going<00:02:20.670> to<00:02:20.700> do<00:02:20.819> is<00:02:20.970> we're

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
and dry what we're going to do is we're

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.850 
and dry what we're going to do is we're
going<00:02:21.150> to<00:02:21.300> smooth<00:02:21.840> it<00:02:22.080> down<00:02:22.110> as<00:02:22.410> much<00:02:22.530> as<00:02:22.739> we

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
going to smooth it down as much as we

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:23.330 
going to smooth it down as much as we
can

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
can

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.850 
can
I'm<00:02:23.459> gonna<00:02:23.580> bring<00:02:23.910> the<00:02:24.180> fringe<00:02:24.540> back<00:02:25.470> on

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
I'm gonna bring the fringe back on

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.150 
I'm gonna bring the fringe back on
itself<00:02:26.400> okay<00:02:27.290> keeping<00:02:28.290> it<00:02:28.440> smooth<00:02:28.739> okay

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
itself okay keeping it smooth okay

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.640 
itself okay keeping it smooth okay
because<00:02:29.459> if<00:02:29.940> you<00:02:30.060> dry<00:02:30.480> it<00:02:30.540> or<00:02:30.870> when<00:02:31.170> we<00:02:31.319> dry<00:02:31.620> it

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
because if you dry it or when we dry it

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.949 
because if you dry it or when we dry it
it's<00:02:32.310> going<00:02:32.459> to<00:02:32.549> puff<00:02:32.940> out<00:02:33.120> and<00:02:33.480> what<00:02:33.780> you<00:02:33.840> want

to do is you want to kick you don't want

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.710 
to do is you want to kick you don't want
to<00:02:35.069> make<00:02:35.190> it<00:02:35.430> stick<00:02:35.880> up<00:02:36.030> right<00:02:36.360> so<00:02:36.510> we're<00:02:36.630> going

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
to make it stick up right so we're going

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.720 
to make it stick up right so we're going
to<00:02:36.780> try<00:02:37.049> and<00:02:37.170> bring<00:02:37.350> it<00:02:37.470> back<00:02:37.500> as<00:02:38.040> best<00:02:38.250> we<00:02:38.430> can

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
to try and bring it back as best we can

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.580 
to try and bring it back as best we can
over<00:02:39.060> here<00:02:39.209> with<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:39.959> wave<00:02:40.170> we've<00:02:40.440> got

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
over here with the wave we've got

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.520 
over here with the wave we've got
trunking<00:02:41.040> controller<00:02:41.940> so<00:02:42.319> especially<00:02:43.319> with

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
trunking controller so especially with

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.259 
trunking controller so especially with
the<00:02:43.620> nozzle<00:02:44.010> the<00:02:44.160> nozzle<00:02:44.190> most<00:02:44.640> important<00:02:45.120> bit

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
the nozzle the nozzle most important bit

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:46.729 
the nozzle the nozzle most important bit
because<00:02:45.450> you're<00:02:45.599> directing<00:02:46.260> the<00:02:46.349> airflow

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
because you're directing the airflow

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.400 
because you're directing the airflow
going<00:02:47.190> to<00:02:47.280> bring<00:02:47.549> it<00:02:47.670> right<00:02:47.700> in<00:02:48.150> there<00:02:48.410> right

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
going to bring it right in there right

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.170 
going to bring it right in there right
in<00:02:49.590> there<00:02:49.769> just<00:02:50.130> bringing<00:02:50.640> it<00:02:50.730> back<00:02:50.880> nice<00:02:51.120> and

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
in there just bringing it back nice and

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.789 
in there just bringing it back nice and
straight<00:02:51.510> you<00:02:51.810> can<00:02:51.959> see<00:02:52.170> how<00:02:52.349> the<00:02:52.410> pressure<00:02:52.620> is

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
straight you can see how the pressure is

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:55.280 
straight you can see how the pressure is
already<00:02:52.950> doing<00:02:53.310> the<00:02:53.489> work<00:02:53.670> the<00:02:54.660> heat<00:02:54.930> behind

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
already doing the work the heat behind

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.800 
already doing the work the heat behind
is<00:02:55.500> just<00:02:55.830> going<00:02:55.980> to<00:02:56.069> enforce<00:02:56.459> it<00:02:56.670> and<00:02:56.819> make<00:02:57.569> it

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
is just going to enforce it and make it

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.699 
is just going to enforce it and make it
and<00:02:57.959> mold<00:02:58.290> it<00:02:59.180> the<00:03:00.180> beard<00:03:00.510> has<00:03:00.810> been<00:03:00.989> cut<00:03:01.320> down

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
and mold it the beard has been cut down

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.729 
and mold it the beard has been cut down
to<00:03:01.769> a<00:03:01.950> number<00:03:02.190> two<00:03:02.690> nice<00:03:03.690> and<00:03:03.930> tapered<00:03:04.109> into

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
to a number two nice and tapered into

once again I've dried the fringe first

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.100 
once again I've dried the fringe first
just<00:03:38.890> so<00:03:39.250> it<00:03:39.370> doesn't<00:03:39.670> dry<00:03:40.030> and<00:03:40.360> drop<00:03:40.659> down<00:03:40.870> and
