00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.420 
here let's look at displays and let's
try<00:02:15.769> and<00:02:15.860> figure<00:02:16.010> out<00:02:16.160> what's<00:02:16.340> going<00:02:16.610> on<00:02:18.430> all

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
try and figure out what's going on all

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.400 
try and figure out what's going on all
right<00:02:19.610> so<00:02:19.940> here's<00:02:20.180> the<00:02:20.360> other<00:02:20.480> display<00:02:20.900> that's

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
right so here's the other display that's

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:31.800 
right so here's the other display that's
being<00:02:21.680> that's<00:02:22.069> showing<00:02:22.489> up<00:02:22.610> on<00:02:22.790> the<00:02:22.879> ATM<00:02:28.299> and

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.370 

most<00:02:32.810> of<00:02:32.959> the<00:02:33.079> color<00:02:34.690> display<00:02:35.690> called<00:02:35.930> profile

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
most of the color display called profile

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:42.430 
most of the color display called profile
color<00:02:36.829> LCD<00:02:40.810> it<00:02:41.810> doesn't<00:02:42.049> appear<00:02:42.260> to<00:02:42.290> be

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
color LCD it doesn't appear to be

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:50.210 
color LCD it doesn't appear to be
anything<00:02:42.849> strange<00:02:44.739> so

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.820 

you<00:02:50.760> know<00:02:50.880> while<00:02:51.240> we're<00:02:51.450> getting<00:02:51.830> this

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
you know while we're getting this

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.240 
you know while we're getting this
curious<00:02:53.460> mirror<00:02:53.880> image<00:02:54.180> here<00:02:54.540> or<00:02:55.470> this

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
curious mirror image here or this

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.300 
curious mirror image here or this
extended<00:02:56.880> image<00:02:57.210> but<00:02:58.110> negative<00:02:58.620> image

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
extended image but negative image

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:12.320 
extended image but negative image
I'm<00:03:02.310> not<00:03:02.550> certain<00:03:07.010> see<00:03:08.010> bars<00:03:08.370> are<00:03:08.580> fine<00:03:11.330> let's
