with my phone and not my camera and

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:44.869 
with my phone and not my camera and
least<00:00:43.800> with<00:00:43.920> my<00:00:44.040> camera<00:00:44.280> I<00:00:44.489> can<00:00:44.670> you<00:00:44.760> know

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
least with my camera I can you know

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.000 
least with my camera I can you know
render<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.390> do<00:00:45.660> things<00:00:46.379> of<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.559> video<00:00:46.800> but

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
render and do things of the video but

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.190 
render and do things of the video but
anyway<00:00:47.309> it's<00:00:48.000> a<00:00:48.090> 10<00:00:48.239> gallon<00:00:48.480> aquarium<00:00:48.989> he's<00:00:49.170> a

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
anyway it's a 10 gallon aquarium he's a

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.020 
anyway it's a 10 gallon aquarium he's a
baby<00:00:49.559> so<00:00:50.190> this<00:00:50.309> is<00:00:50.370> probably<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.850> biggest

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
baby so this is probably the biggest

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.479 
baby so this is probably the biggest
you're<00:00:51.270> going<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.449> want<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.660> go<00:00:52.070> at<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.190> bottom

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
here he has eco earth coconut fiber

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.220 
here he has eco earth coconut fiber
substrate<00:00:56.399> retains<00:00:57.300> humidity<00:00:57.780> pretty<00:00:58.020> well

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
substrate retains humidity pretty well

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.330 
substrate retains humidity pretty well
and<00:00:58.440> I<00:00:58.500> have<00:00:58.710> quite<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.399> bit<00:00:59.489> of<00:00:59.640> it<00:00:59.870> so<00:01:00.870> I'm<00:01:01.340> just

and I have quite a bit of it so I'm just

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.640 
and I have quite a bit of it so I'm just
made<00:01:02.489> sense<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.820> use<00:01:03.000> it<00:01:03.120> I<00:01:03.210> guess<00:01:03.470> over<00:01:04.470> here

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
made sense to use it I guess over here

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.490 
made sense to use it I guess over here
we<00:01:04.739> have<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:05.070> log<00:01:05.369> hide<00:01:05.670> a<00:01:05.939> food<00:01:06.330> dish<00:01:06.570> with<00:01:06.840> some

humidity<00:01:35.790> because<00:01:36.090> these<00:01:36.180> guys<00:01:36.390> need<00:01:36.659> fifty

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
humidity because these guys need fifty

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.260 
humidity because these guys need fifty
to<00:01:37.710> eighty<00:01:37.860> percent<00:01:38.189> humidity<00:01:38.670> is<00:01:38.909> probably

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
to eighty percent humidity is probably

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.289 
to eighty percent humidity is probably
pretty<00:01:39.360> good<00:01:39.770> over<00:01:40.770> here<00:01:40.950> we<00:01:41.070> have<00:01:41.100> a<00:01:41.460> digital

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
pretty good over here we have a digital

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.539 
pretty good over here we have a digital
thermometer<00:01:42.540> it's<00:01:43.350> not<00:01:43.560> on<00:01:43.740> right<00:01:43.890> now<00:01:43.950> but

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
thermometer it's not on right now but

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.030 
thermometer it's not on right now but
helps<00:01:45.479> me<00:01:45.630> measure<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:46.470> temperature<00:01:46.860> on<00:01:46.890> the

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
helps me measure the temperature on the

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.889 
helps me measure the temperature on the
hot<00:01:47.189> side<00:01:47.399> and<00:01:47.670> up<00:01:48.119> here<00:01:48.329> we<00:01:48.360> have<00:01:48.570> a<00:01:48.600> light

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
hot side and up here we have a light

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.630 
hot side and up here we have a light
it's<00:01:49.110> not<00:01:49.259> a<00:01:49.290> traditional<00:01:49.560> light<00:01:50.189> fixture

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
it's not a traditional light fixture

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.719 
it's not a traditional light fixture
like<00:01:50.880> one<00:01:51.540> of<00:01:51.570> these<00:01:52.280> but<00:01:53.280> it<00:01:53.369> works<00:01:53.520> pretty

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
like one of these but it works pretty

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.969 
like one of these but it works pretty
well<00:01:53.850> especially<00:01:54.149> for<00:01:54.659> a<00:01:54.710> crested<00:01:55.710> gecko

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
well especially for a crested gecko

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.380 
well especially for a crested gecko
where<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.219> temperatures<00:01:56.670> don't<00:01:56.939> need<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.210> be

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
where the temperatures don't need to be

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.690 
where the temperatures don't need to be
that<00:01:58.259> high<00:01:58.500> up<00:01:58.680> in<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:58.860> 90<00:01:59.280> says<00:01:59.430> I<00:01:59.460> have<00:01:59.670> a

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
that high up in the 90 says I have a

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.999 
that high up in the 90 says I have a
60-watt<00:02:00.240> bulb<00:02:00.570> but<00:02:00.869> you<00:02:01.079> know<00:02:01.200> only<00:02:01.560> six

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
60-watt bulb but you know only six

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.950 
60-watt bulb but you know only six
inches<00:02:02.310> down<00:02:02.369> a<00:02:02.820> 60-watt<00:02:03.299> bulb<00:02:03.570> could<00:02:03.840> get

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
inches down a 60-watt bulb could get

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.749 
inches down a 60-watt bulb could get
into<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.290> 90s<00:02:04.649> and<00:02:04.770> that's<00:02:04.890> probably<00:02:05.520> a<00:02:05.610> bit

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
into the 90s and that's probably a bit

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.589 
into the 90s and that's probably a bit
too<00:02:05.790> hot<00:02:06.119> and<00:02:06.420> dry<00:02:07.049> out<00:02:07.079> the<00:02:08.179> drought<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.330> tank

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
too hot and dry out the drought the tank

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.020 
too hot and dry out the drought the tank
and<00:02:09.810> lower<00:02:10.379> humidity<00:02:10.619> and<00:02:10.950> probably<00:02:11.879> more

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
and lower humidity and probably more

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.550 
and lower humidity and probably more
negative<00:02:12.450> than<00:02:12.480> it<00:02:12.900> is<00:02:13.020> positive

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
negative than it is positive

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.280 
negative than it is positive
but<00:02:13.709> so<00:02:14.040> this<00:02:14.190> desk<00:02:14.370> light<00:02:14.580> works<00:02:14.760> pretty<00:02:14.940> well

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
but so this desk light works pretty well

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.530 
but so this desk light works pretty well
so<00:02:16.290> yeah<00:02:16.470> that's<00:02:16.620> the<00:02:16.830> tank<00:02:17.130> and<00:02:17.700> here<00:02:18.390> he<00:02:18.480> is

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
so yeah that's the tank and here he is

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.780 
so yeah that's the tank and here he is
one<00:02:18.599> more<00:02:18.810> time<00:02:18.959> he<00:02:19.680> looks<00:02:19.890> really<00:02:20.220> good<00:02:20.520> like

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
one more time he looks really good like

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.300 
one more time he looks really good like
I<00:02:20.970> mean<00:02:21.150> he<00:02:21.300> looks<00:02:21.840> good<00:02:22.140> but<00:02:22.470> he<00:02:22.739> moves<00:02:23.130> around

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
I mean he looks good but he moves around

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.460 
I mean he looks good but he moves around
a<00:02:23.550> lot<00:02:23.580> he's<00:02:23.819> a<00:02:23.849> little<00:02:24.090> bit<00:02:24.270> skinny<00:02:24.540> but<00:02:24.810> once

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
a lot he's a little bit skinny but once

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.020 
a lot he's a little bit skinny but once
he<00:02:25.560> gets<00:02:25.709> acclimated<00:02:25.890> and<00:02:26.340> eating<00:02:26.730> I<00:02:26.819> think

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
he gets acclimated and eating I think

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.630 
he gets acclimated and eating I think
he'll<00:02:27.180> be<00:02:27.330> really<00:02:27.810> good<00:02:28.410> and<00:02:28.650> like<00:02:29.280> I<00:02:29.400> said<00:02:29.459> he

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
he'll be really good and like I said he

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.830 
he'll be really good and like I said he
moves<00:02:29.819> around<00:02:29.910> a<00:02:30.060> lot<00:02:30.090> he<00:02:30.269> started<00:02:30.660> down<00:02:30.810> here

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
moves around a lot he started down here

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.630 
moves around a lot he started down here
and<00:02:31.260> he's<00:02:31.349> been<00:02:31.500> moving<00:02:32.250> all<00:02:32.310> over<00:02:32.430> the<00:02:32.580> place
