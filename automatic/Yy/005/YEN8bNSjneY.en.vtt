whatever you initially lasso and a

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.070 
whatever you initially lasso and a
secondary<00:01:05.439> source<00:01:05.830> so<00:01:06.790> you<00:01:07.210> just<00:01:07.510> lasso

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.080 
secondary source so you just lasso

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.710 
secondary source so you just lasso
around<00:01:08.110> click<00:01:08.620> and<00:01:08.770> drag<00:01:08.980> and<00:01:09.330> then<00:01:10.330> it<00:01:10.600> gets

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.720 
around click and drag and then it gets

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.870 
around click and drag and then it gets
rid<00:01:10.960> of<00:01:10.990> it<00:01:11.200> what<00:01:12.160> the<00:01:12.250> patch<00:01:12.430> tool<00:01:12.460> does

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880
