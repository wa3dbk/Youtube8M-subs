00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:07.799
 and then welcome staff but a video 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.960
 Now I'm going to do a second test on the 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.590
 new cruise day care 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.900
 the first one I had done I rode 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.560
 three 1080-point displays with one 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:25.230
 resolution of 3,520 per 1920 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:30.210
 this in a 7 and 39 30k-overclocked 4.5 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:32.189
 and a frame of 690 gtx 690 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.559
 now all in the same configuration as 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:38.129
 same machine but running on only one 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:40.770
 1080 point screen with only one 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.230
 the graphic quality is the same as the 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:48.719
 previous video where she hesitates at a minimum 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:51.829
 and the textures at very high and systems 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.829
 pecs no v hi 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:57.090
 Come on, put no one there for you. 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.070
 for you to have a more or less 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.859
 less the first video showing how 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.470
 that the codex came out using three screens of 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.659
 1080 points in a resolution of almost 4 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.750
 and now this video to show the 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.470
 performance of the code in only one killer 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.470
 1080 points 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.610
 a half hour 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:24.520
 right away here if you can see 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:28.960
 there the counter of fps quoted the species 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:30.310
 is in a phase of 250 and daycare centers 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.770
 today is considered one of the most 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:36.750
 more beautiful and heavier for you 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.750
 run on your computer 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.640
 here is a closed area then with 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:44.680
 sure when we talk outside 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.659
 will give a drop in these fps 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.210
 as there is little here, let's say few 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:53.770
 objects to the gpu is performing a 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:02:01.440
 species will be very high for scoring 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:02:01.440
 but here in the corner 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:14.330
 until the interesting part arrives in this 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:21.790
 Closed computer part is on average 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:21.790
 of 250 when we go outside 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:28.040
 has already given a considerable drop 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.590
 how is an open area here counter 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:35.030
 dropped to 50 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:39.140
 he is getting better he came back with 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:42.980
 200 depending on the match where you look 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:47.329
 in the game it keeps varying is in a 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:51.579
 average about 100 m in height 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:51.579
 trying to kill you can eliminate 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:07.240
 the bigger the area is the worse the fs 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.840
 This game is not yet fully 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:13.420
 Let's say the machine is optimized. 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.250
 ability to walk well but up to 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.930
 now it has not gone out and we have won many 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.890
 updates both shared in 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.090
 video 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.090
 another purpose of crytek 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.580
 mello 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:14.270
 is during resacada being of the species 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:19.139
 kept pretty high 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:20.880
 the only significant drop was soon 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:24.720
 when we left that small room 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:27.389
 and depending on where to look 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.740
 fps of a considerable brand but in the 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:30.630
 most of the game and keep 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:35.660
 generally above 100 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:35.660
 here in this part for example is at 150 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:39.840
 put it serves because that 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:42.060
 service the whole game 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:46.020
 the only bet in fact the game had a 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:49.950
 is very much considered using this 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:51.090
 graphic quality because most of the 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:57.330
 about the game 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:05:00.240
 it remains at the base of the 150 points with 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:02.400
 peak of 200 and 250 depending on smoking is 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.990
 closed but this room closed I 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.000
 particularly does not count 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.200
 I believe the correct one for you to start 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.100
 to see this game does not have a tool 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:15.750
 of well that the correct one is you with an area 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:17.850
 open and inside you check the 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:20.490
 performance that you have to 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:22.669
 stipulate you are running well if you do not 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.669
 OK 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:29.210
 this video is more evidence and had as 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.210
 reference 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:36.690
 in the first video I was using 30 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:39.650
 80 and now only using one for you guys 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.650
 a more or less base 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:03.720
 see how the game did not even know that 

00:06:00.569 --> 00:06:06.650
 I was with the grenade it was shot and 

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.650
 practically kill me 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:20.660
 I hope you liked the video. 

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:22.550
 I will stretch a lot more throughout the 

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:24.740
 game is the average 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:27.740
 using a frame with at least 17 

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:33.260
 39 30 here with this touch of 45 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:35.800
 the game is between 100 and 150 fps with 

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:37.669
 only a few parts where 

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:39.919
 some parts like the one I 

00:06:37.669 --> 00:06:43.639
 I showed at first where he has a fall 

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:47.240
 meaning that this is running at maximum 

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:50.830
 because if you want to decrease the quality 

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:53.300
 graphic and I account of the species goes away 

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:56.020
 You liked any doubt it is 

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:56.020
 just leave a comment
