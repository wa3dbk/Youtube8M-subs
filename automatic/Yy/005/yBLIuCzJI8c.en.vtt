there's so many people around here let
me<00:01:54.180> show<00:01:54.210> you<00:01:54.360> here<00:01:54.930> it's<00:01:55.560> been<00:01:55.680> like<00:01:55.799> this

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
me show you here it's been like this

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.160 
me show you here it's been like this
that's<00:01:56.130> really<00:01:56.340> fast<00:01:56.610> right<00:01:56.909> but<00:01:57.840> if<00:01:57.899> I<00:01:57.960> spin

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
that's really fast right but if I spin

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.899 
that's really fast right but if I spin
over<00:01:58.350> here<00:01:58.590> it's<00:01:58.860> been<00:01:59.070> slower<00:01:59.399> because<00:01:59.579> the

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
over here it's been slower because the

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.380 
over here it's been slower because the
in<00:02:00.180> assists<00:02:00.540> is<00:02:00.689> slowing<00:02:01.020> me<00:02:01.110> down<00:02:02.240> all<00:02:03.240> right
