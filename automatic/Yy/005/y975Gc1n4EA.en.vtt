bits are carbide tipped they stay

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.970 
bits are carbide tipped they stay
sharper<00:00:29.609> much<00:00:29.730> longer<00:00:30.590> give<00:00:31.590> you<00:00:31.679> a<00:00:31.740> cleaner

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
sharper much longer give you a cleaner

cut less burning steel bits the old
steel<00:00:35.550> bits<00:00:36.620> actually<00:00:37.620> are<00:00:37.710> getting<00:00:37.920> harder

and<00:00:38.280> harder<00:00:38.370> to<00:00:38.610> find<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:38.969> that's<00:00:39.030> a<00:00:39.180> good

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
and harder to find and that's a good

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.389 
and harder to find and that's a good
thing<00:00:40.010> they<00:00:41.010> cost<00:00:41.340> a<00:00:41.640> little<00:00:41.910> bit<00:00:42.120> less<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:43.399> if

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
thing they cost a little bit less and if

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
working in oak or maple you might get

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.810 
working in oak or maple you might get
about<00:00:47.940> a<00:00:48.000> 3-foot<00:00:48.570> cut<00:00:48.780> in<00:00:48.930> it<00:00:49.050> before<00:00:49.170> it<00:00:49.469> dulls

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
about a 3-foot cut in it before it dulls

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.939 
about a 3-foot cut in it before it dulls
whereas<00:00:50.820> with<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:51.270> good<00:00:51.449> carbide<00:00:51.899> bit<00:00:52.140> you<00:00:52.800> can

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
whereas with a good carbide bit you can

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.560 
whereas with a good carbide bit you can
cut<00:00:53.100> hundreds<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.640> hundreds<00:00:53.910> of<00:00:54.000> feet<00:00:54.059> before

cut hundreds and hundreds of feet before

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.189 
cut hundreds and hundreds of feet before
it<00:00:54.660> will<00:00:54.809> dull<00:00:55.879> the<00:00:56.879> next<00:00:57.090> thing<00:00:57.210> is<00:00:57.360> is<00:00:57.600> shank

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
it will dull the next thing is is shank

shanks<00:01:11.970> I<00:01:12.290> have<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.380> exact<00:01:13.680> same<00:01:13.710> profile<00:01:14.400> why

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
shanks I have the exact same profile why

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.660 
shanks I have the exact same profile why
do<00:01:14.790> I<00:01:14.909> have<00:01:15.060> it<00:01:15.090> two<00:01:15.330> different<00:01:15.600> shanks<00:01:16.670> the

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
do I have it two different shanks the

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.149 
do I have it two different shanks the
heavier<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.119> shank<00:01:18.500> the<00:01:19.500> more<00:01:19.710> stable<00:01:19.950> the

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
heavier the shank the more stable the

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.240 
heavier the shank the more stable the
cut<00:01:20.460> is<00:01:20.610> going<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:20.820> be<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.590> smaller<00:01:22.590> shank<00:01:22.979> will

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
cut is going to be a smaller shank will

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.370 
cut is going to be a smaller shank will
give<00:01:23.549> you<00:01:23.670> could<00:01:24.270> give<00:01:24.450> you<00:01:24.540> more<00:01:24.720> vibration

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
give you could give you more vibration

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.859 
give you could give you more vibration
and<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:26.369> rougher<00:01:26.970> cut<00:01:27.180> so<00:01:27.450> if<00:01:27.570> you<00:01:27.659> have<00:01:27.750> the

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
and a rougher cut so if you have the

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.569 
and a rougher cut so if you have the
chance<00:01:28.140> it<00:01:28.500> may<00:01:28.740> cost<00:01:28.950> you<00:01:29.100> an<00:01:29.189> extra<00:01:29.250> dollar

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
chance it may cost you an extra dollar

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.060 
chance it may cost you an extra dollar
but<00:01:30.240> it's<00:01:30.390> certainly<00:01:30.659> worth<00:01:30.869> it<00:01:31.170> for<00:01:31.770> a<00:01:31.829> bit

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
but it's certainly worth it for a bit

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.710 
but it's certainly worth it for a bit
that<00:01:32.189> you're<00:01:32.280> going<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.430> be<00:01:32.549> using<00:01:32.729> for<00:01:33.150> years

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
that you're going to be using for years

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.450 
that you're going to be using for years
to<00:01:33.990> come<00:01:34.170> so<00:01:34.470> always<00:01:34.860> go<00:01:35.009> with<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.220> heavier

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
to come so always go with the heavier

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.550 
to come so always go with the heavier
shank<00:01:35.729> when<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:35.970> can<00:01:36.180> another<00:01:37.049> item<00:01:37.290> that<00:01:37.409> I

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
shank when you can another item that I

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.950 
shank when you can another item that I
find<00:01:37.860> useful<00:01:38.009> with<00:01:38.520> when<00:01:39.390> I'm<00:01:39.479> sitting<00:01:39.840> at<00:01:39.930> my

share<00:02:16.260> with<00:02:16.410> you<00:02:16.650> is<00:02:17.600> when<00:02:18.600> you're<00:02:18.720> using<00:02:18.810> a

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
share with you is when you're using a

there's a lot of fussing to get set up
right<00:02:38.180> so<00:02:39.180> what<00:02:39.300> I<00:02:39.330> have<00:02:39.600> done<00:02:39.840> is<00:02:40.819> when<00:02:41.819> I<00:02:41.850> use

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
right so what I have done is when I use

where I like it

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.400 
where I like it
I<00:02:45.420> ran<00:02:45.840> a<00:02:45.870> couple<00:02:45.989> pieces<00:02:46.440> of<00:02:46.650> scrap<00:02:46.769> and<00:02:48.410> you

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
I ran a couple pieces of scrap and you

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.380 
I ran a couple pieces of scrap and you
can<00:02:49.560> see<00:02:49.769> how<00:02:50.370> the<00:02:50.430> joint<00:02:50.790> comes<00:02:51.090> together

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
can see how the joint comes together

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.350 
can see how the joint comes together
real<00:02:51.630> nicely<00:02:52.220> but<00:02:53.220> now<00:02:53.430> I<00:02:53.459> keep<00:02:53.820> these<00:02:54.090> pieces

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
real nicely but now I keep these pieces

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.960 
real nicely but now I keep these pieces
of<00:02:54.630> scrap<00:02:54.840> with<00:02:55.290> my<00:02:55.470> cutter<00:02:55.739> so<00:02:56.700> that<00:02:56.730> when<00:02:56.940> I

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
of scrap with my cutter so that when I

go<00:02:57.150> to<00:02:57.180> set<00:02:57.480> up<00:02:57.660> I<00:02:58.489> can<00:02:59.489> just<00:02:59.880> set<00:03:00.060> this<00:03:00.239> on<00:03:00.480> my

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
go to set up I can just set this on my
