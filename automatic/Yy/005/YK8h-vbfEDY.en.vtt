00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:03.789 
there just cut there and then we'll
slice<00:02:02.659> this<00:02:02.899> piece<00:02:03.169> of<00:02:03.319> off<00:02:03.439> of<00:02:03.590> the<00:02:03.679> other

piece on the strip now the one last

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:10.240 
piece on the strip now the one last
thing<00:02:07.249> to<00:02:07.369> think<00:02:07.579> about<00:02:07.639> is<00:02:07.999> this<00:02:08.440> LED<00:02:09.440> we<00:02:10.069> want

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
thing to think about is this LED we want

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.670 
thing to think about is this LED we want
that<00:02:10.369> to<00:02:10.490> be<00:02:10.580> visible<00:02:11.000> so<00:02:11.120> or<00:02:11.659> I'm<00:02:11.959> gonna<00:02:12.260> cut<00:02:12.650> a

that to be visible so or I'm gonna cut a

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:13.170 
that to be visible so or I'm gonna cut a
little

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
little

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.069 
little
not<00:02:13.450> out<00:02:13.870> of<00:02:13.900> my<00:02:14.170> velcro<00:02:15.000> this<00:02:16.000> corner<00:02:16.629> so<00:02:17.019> I

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:17.079 
not out of my velcro this corner so I

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:24.000 
not out of my velcro this corner so I
can<00:02:17.379> see<00:02:18.450> that<00:02:19.450> red<00:02:20.129> LED<00:02:22.439> and<00:02:23.439> I<00:02:23.500> can<00:02:23.650> test<00:02:23.859> fit

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
can see that red LED and I can test fit

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.319 
can see that red LED and I can test fit
it<00:02:24.129> again<00:02:24.370> and<00:02:24.549> I<00:02:24.609> can<00:02:24.730> see<00:02:24.849> that<00:02:24.939> that<00:02:25.060> velcro

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:25.329 
it again and I can see that that velcro

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:27.539 
it again and I can see that that velcro
is<00:02:25.750> gonna<00:02:26.680> be<00:02:26.829> the<00:02:26.950> perfect<00:02:27.099> size<00:02:27.340> of<00:02:27.489> the

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:27.549 
is gonna be the perfect size of the

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:30.030 
is gonna be the perfect size of the
bottom<00:02:27.819> and<00:02:27.969> that<00:02:28.000> my<00:02:28.359> LED<00:02:28.900> is<00:02:29.170> going<00:02:29.680> to<00:02:29.889> be

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
bottom and that my LED is going to be

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:36.360 
bottom and that my LED is going to be
clearly<00:02:30.579> visible<00:02:34.349> all<00:02:35.349> right<00:02:35.560> then<00:02:36.219> we're

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
clearly visible all right then we're

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:42.379 
clearly visible all right then we're
simply<00:02:36.489> gonna<00:02:36.730> peel<00:02:37.060> the<00:02:37.480> backing<00:02:37.780> off<00:02:40.200> and

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
stick the velcro down and that's it our

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.399 
stick the velcro down and that's it our
camera<00:02:48.849> is<00:02:48.970> now<00:02:49.120> completely<00:02:49.629> modified<00:02:49.959> so

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:50.409 
camera is now completely modified so

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:53.610 
camera is now completely modified so
that<00:02:50.590> would<00:02:50.769> be<00:02:50.919> used<00:02:51.189> on<00:02:51.370> any<00:02:51.900> kind<00:02:52.900> of<00:02:53.169> velcro

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
that would be used on any kind of velcro

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.229 
that would be used on any kind of velcro
mount<00:02:54.129> we<00:02:54.609> want<00:02:54.939> to<00:02:55.120> use<00:02:55.299> it<00:02:55.419> on<00:02:56.669> and<00:02:57.669> if<00:02:58.150> you

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
mount we want to use it on and if you

00:02:58.239 --> 00:02:59.909 
mount we want to use it on and if you
guys<00:02:58.419> are<00:02:58.569> worried<00:02:58.930> about<00:02:59.019> it's<00:02:59.290> not<00:02:59.530> working

00:02:59.909 --> 00:02:59.919 
guys are worried about it's not working

00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:02.759 
guys are worried about it's not working
in<00:03:00.010> the<00:03:00.099> case<00:03:00.430> you<00:03:00.790> can<00:03:01.659> let<00:03:01.900> that<00:03:02.079> worry<00:03:02.379> rest

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769 
in the case you can let that worry rest

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:04.679 
in the case you can let that worry rest
because<00:03:03.310> if<00:03:03.430> you<00:03:03.519> get<00:03:03.639> your<00:03:03.730> case<00:03:03.969> out<00:03:04.239> you

00:03:04.679 --> 00:03:04.689 
because if you get your case out you

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:07.550 
because if you get your case out you
will<00:03:04.840> find<00:03:05.109> that<00:03:05.769> your<00:03:06.010> GoPro<00:03:06.400> still<00:03:07.030> slides

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
will find that your GoPro still slides

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:14.069 
will find that your GoPro still slides
perfectly<00:03:08.760> into<00:03:09.760> the<00:03:09.879> case<00:03:12.629> the<00:03:13.629> nice<00:03:13.810> thing

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:14.079 
perfectly into the case the nice thing

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:15.720 
perfectly into the case the nice thing
about<00:03:14.139> using<00:03:14.349> the<00:03:14.469> soft<00:03:14.709> ocher<00:03:15.010> is<00:03:15.159> that<00:03:15.430> these

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
about using the soft ocher is that these

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.629 
about using the soft ocher is that these
feet<00:03:16.060> where<00:03:16.799> the<00:03:17.799> velcro<00:03:18.040> makes<00:03:18.310> contact<00:03:18.549> with

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:18.639 
feet where the velcro makes contact with

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:20.640 
feet where the velcro makes contact with
the<00:03:18.729> case<00:03:19.019> because<00:03:20.019> the<00:03:20.109> soft<00:03:20.319> stuff<00:03:20.470> just

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
the case because the soft stuff just

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:21.839 
the case because the soft stuff just
kind<00:03:20.799> of<00:03:20.829> spreads<00:03:21.069> to<00:03:21.159> the<00:03:21.250> side<00:03:21.459> so<00:03:21.639> it<00:03:21.729> is<00:03:21.819> a

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:21.849 
kind of spreads to the side so it is a

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:23.219 
kind of spreads to the side so it is a
little<00:03:22.120> bit<00:03:22.239> harder<00:03:22.479> to<00:03:22.569> slide<00:03:22.780> in<00:03:23.019> and<00:03:23.139> out

00:03:23.219 --> 00:03:23.229 
little bit harder to slide in and out

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:27.449 
little bit harder to slide in and out
but<00:03:24.129> it's<00:03:24.400> not<00:03:25.620> tight<00:03:26.620> in<00:03:26.919> such<00:03:27.159> a<00:03:27.220> way<00:03:27.340> that

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
but it's not tight in such a way that

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:28.379 
but it's not tight in such a way that
you're<00:03:27.549> worried<00:03:27.790> about<00:03:27.849> damaging<00:03:28.150> your

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:28.389 
you're worried about damaging your

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:31.649 
you're worried about damaging your
camera<00:03:28.810> and<00:03:28.989> it<00:03:29.739> still<00:03:30.069> comes<00:03:30.340> out<00:03:30.549> just<00:03:31.180> fine

00:03:31.649 --> 00:03:31.659 
camera and it still comes out just fine

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:33.509 
camera and it still comes out just fine
so<00:03:32.139> you've<00:03:32.319> lost<00:03:32.530> none<00:03:32.889> of<00:03:32.919> the<00:03:33.040> functionality

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
so you've lost none of the functionality

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:35.399 
so you've lost none of the functionality
of<00:03:33.579> using<00:03:33.849> the<00:03:33.909> waterproof<00:03:34.150> case<00:03:34.419> but<00:03:35.260> you've

00:03:35.399 --> 00:03:35.409 
of using the waterproof case but you've

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:38.879 
of using the waterproof case but you've
added<00:03:35.650> this<00:03:36.069> option<00:03:36.819> of<00:03:37.120> mounting<00:03:37.780> it<00:03:37.900> outside

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:38.889 
added this option of mounting it outside

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:41.039 
added this option of mounting it outside
the<00:03:38.979> case<00:03:39.189> so<00:03:39.519> to<00:03:40.120> mount<00:03:40.299> it<00:03:40.449> onto<00:03:40.629> this<00:03:40.870> to

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:41.049 
the case so to mount it onto this to

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:43.229 
the case so to mount it onto this to
just<00:03:41.349> aren't<00:03:41.560> to<00:03:41.620> the<00:03:41.849> other<00:03:42.849> piece<00:03:43.000> of<00:03:43.030> velcro

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
just aren't to the other piece of velcro

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:45.179 
just aren't to the other piece of velcro
all<00:03:43.509> we<00:03:43.629> would<00:03:43.780> do<00:03:43.959> is<00:03:44.229> stick<00:03:44.530> down<00:03:44.739> this<00:03:44.949> piece

00:03:45.179 --> 00:03:45.189 
all we would do is stick down this piece

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:47.759 
all we would do is stick down this piece
of<00:03:45.340> velcro<00:03:45.549> here<00:03:45.939> the<00:03:46.269> hard<00:03:46.509> side<00:03:46.780> and<00:03:47.019> then<00:03:47.590> we

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769 
of velcro here the hard side and then we

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:50.129
