and<00:01:23.939> some<00:01:24.479> commercials<00:01:25.049> so<00:01:25.290> I<00:01:25.320> need<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.590> bring

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
and some commercials so I need to bring

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.120 
and some commercials so I need to bring
a<00:01:25.950> backup<00:01:26.280> camera<00:01:26.990> for<00:01:27.990> my<00:01:28.200> production<00:01:28.500> so

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
a backup camera for my production so

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.390 
a backup camera for my production so
this<00:01:29.280> is<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.520> EOS<00:01:30.030> m<00:01:30.619> mirrorless<00:01:31.619> camera<00:01:32.189> from

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
this is the EOS m mirrorless camera from

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.910 
this is the EOS m mirrorless camera from
Canon<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.840> reason<00:01:34.200> I<00:01:34.350> went<00:01:34.500> ahead<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:34.799> picked

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
Canon the reason I went ahead and picked

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.859 
Canon the reason I went ahead and picked
this<00:01:35.130> up<00:01:35.189> is<00:01:35.610> because<00:01:35.850> this<00:01:36.090> has<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.659> same

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
this up is because this has the same

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.399 
this up is because this has the same
sensor<00:01:37.530> as<00:01:37.560> a<00:01:37.790> Canon<00:01:38.790> 60d<00:01:39.110> so<00:01:40.110> it's<00:01:40.229> kind<00:01:40.380> of

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
sensor as a Canon 60d so it's kind of

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:41.600 
sensor as a Canon 60d so it's kind of
going<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:40.619> give<00:01:40.740> me<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:40.920> same<00:01:41.159> kind<00:01:41.490> of

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
going to give me the same kind of

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.270 
going to give me the same kind of
quality<00:01:42.570> that<00:01:42.600> I<00:01:42.810> might<00:01:43.110> get<00:01:43.350> from<00:01:43.740> actual

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
quality that I might get from actual

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.340 
quality that I might get from actual
DSLR<00:01:44.790> plus<00:01:45.180> I<00:01:45.299> needed<00:01:45.540> something<00:01:45.689> compact

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
DSLR plus I needed something compact

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.440 
DSLR plus I needed something compact

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
battery now the battery life on here is

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.069 
battery now the battery life on here is
I<00:03:24.280> don't<00:03:24.340> think<00:03:24.489> it's<00:03:24.700> really<00:03:25.060> much<00:03:25.630> on<00:03:25.840> here

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:26.079 
I don't think it's really much on here

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:29.550 
I don't think it's really much on here
because<00:03:26.410> this<00:03:26.530> one<00:03:26.769> is<00:03:27.209> 875<00:03:28.209> milliamp<00:03:28.750> so<00:03:29.410> it

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
because this one is 875 milliamp so it

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:30.870 
because this one is 875 milliamp so it

of<00:05:23.770> course<00:05:24.280> if<00:05:24.430> I<00:05:24.550> put<00:05:25.120> in<00:05:25.240> my<00:05:25.360> 24<00:05:25.840> to<00:05:25.930> 105<00:05:26.380> lens

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:26.680 
of course if I put in my 24 to 105 lens

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.100 
of course if I put in my 24 to 105 lens
on<00:05:26.889> here<00:05:27.220> I<00:05:27.430> can't<00:05:28.240> just<00:05:28.419> go<00:05:28.540> ahead<00:05:28.720> and<00:05:28.870> mount

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
on here I can't just go ahead and mount

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:30.630 
on here I can't just go ahead and mount
it<00:05:29.290> on<00:05:29.410> here<00:05:29.560> because<00:05:29.710> gonna<00:05:29.919> be<00:05:30.100> really<00:05:30.340> heavy

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:30.640 
it on here because gonna be really heavy

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:33.750 
it on here because gonna be really heavy
so<00:05:30.910> they<00:05:31.060> did<00:05:31.270> include<00:05:31.750> this<00:05:32.740> on<00:05:32.950> here<00:05:33.220> so<00:05:33.430> all

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:33.760 
so they did include this on here so all

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.790 
so they did include this on here so all
the<00:05:33.880> weight<00:05:34.060> is<00:05:34.360> not<00:05:34.540> on<00:05:34.810> your<00:05:35.110> camera<00:05:35.590> but

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:35.800

how<00:05:38.770> this<00:05:38.950> works<00:05:39.310> and<00:05:41.310> just<00:05:42.310> gonna<00:05:42.400> go<00:05:42.610> ahead

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:42.700 
how this works and just gonna go ahead

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:45.540 
how this works and just gonna go ahead
and<00:05:42.880> mount<00:05:43.210> this<00:05:43.510> to<00:05:43.919> so<00:05:44.919> all<00:05:45.039> you<00:05:45.160> have<00:05:45.280> to<00:05:45.400> do

like<00:06:37.270> I<00:06:37.390> said

00:06:38.129 --> 00:06:38.139 
like I said

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:39.989 
like I said
I<00:06:38.169> can't<00:06:38.409> hold<00:06:38.590> it<00:06:38.770> just<00:06:38.889> like<00:06:38.979> this<00:06:39.129> because

00:06:39.989 --> 00:06:39.999 
I can't hold it just like this because

00:06:39.999 --> 00:06:42.689 
I can't hold it just like this because
of<00:06:40.300> the<00:06:41.050> weight<00:06:41.229> on<00:06:41.409> here<00:06:41.620> so<00:06:42.280> I<00:06:42.340> do<00:06:42.400> have<00:06:42.610> to

00:06:42.689 --> 00:06:42.699 
of the weight on here so I do have to

00:06:42.699 --> 00:06:46.439 
of the weight on here so I do have to
rest<00:06:43.689> it<00:06:43.780> on<00:06:43.900> here<00:06:44.199> or<00:06:44.789> if<00:06:45.789> you<00:06:45.909> put<00:06:46.060> it<00:06:46.210> to<00:06:46.330> your

00:06:46.439 --> 00:06:46.449 
rest it on here or if you put it to your

00:06:46.449 --> 00:06:48.659 
rest it on here or if you put it to your
tripod<00:06:46.689> make<00:06:47.590> sure<00:06:47.770> you<00:06:47.889> plug<00:06:48.159> it<00:06:48.310> into<00:06:48.430> this

00:06:48.659 --> 00:06:48.669 
tripod make sure you plug it into this

00:06:48.669 --> 00:06:50.689 
tripod make sure you plug it into this
one<00:06:48.909> because<00:06:49.029> this<00:06:49.360> one<00:06:49.419> does<00:06:49.749> detach<00:06:50.169> if<00:06:50.499> you

00:06:50.689 --> 00:06:50.699 
one because this one does detach if you

00:06:50.699 --> 00:06:57.869 
one because this one does detach if you
unscrew<00:06:51.699> it<00:06:51.999> I<00:06:52.090> think<00:06:55.650> this<00:06:56.650> will<00:06:56.860> detach<00:06:57.219> but

00:06:57.869 --> 00:06:57.879 
unscrew it I think this will detach but

00:06:57.879 --> 00:07:00.029 
unscrew it I think this will detach but
I'd<00:06:58.029> rather<00:06:58.180> have<00:06:58.449> that<00:06:58.479> on<00:06:58.779> there<00:06:59.039> because

00:07:00.029 --> 00:07:00.039 
I'd rather have that on there because

00:07:00.039 --> 00:07:01.890 
I'd rather have that on there because
it's<00:07:00.189> gonna<00:07:00.340> help<00:07:00.490> with<00:07:00.699> the<00:07:00.849> weight<00:07:01.060> that<00:07:01.779> I'm

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:01.900 
it's gonna help with the weight that I'm

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:05.129 
it's gonna help with the weight that I'm
