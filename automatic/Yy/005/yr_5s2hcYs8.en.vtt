there's an extra one that for this which

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.639 
there's an extra one that for this which
you<00:00:59.960> use<00:01:00.230> on<00:01:01.130> some<00:01:01.940> kits<00:01:02.300> like<00:01:03.020> this<00:01:03.320> you<00:01:03.620> see

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:03.649 
you use on some kits like this you see

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:07.410 
you use on some kits like this you see
there's<00:01:04.280> a<00:01:04.369> screw<00:01:04.790> into<00:01:05.059> the<00:01:05.750> crotch<00:01:06.079> it<00:01:06.320> goes

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:14.049 
this is the first grade exia and

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:20.469 
this is the first grade exia and
basically<00:01:17.619> you<00:01:18.619> get<00:01:18.830> the<00:01:19.070> the<00:01:19.790> base<00:01:20.030> can<00:01:20.450> be

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
basically you get the the base can be

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:23.950 
basically you get the the base can be
detached<00:01:21.080> like<00:01:21.470> this<00:01:21.940> and<00:01:22.940> you<00:01:23.540> have<00:01:23.720> this

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
detached like this and you have this

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.969 
detached like this and you have this
little<00:01:24.229> connector<00:01:24.860> piece<00:01:25.240> so<00:01:26.240> that<00:01:26.270> you<00:01:26.690> can

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:26.979 
little connector piece so that you can

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:33.070 
little connector piece so that you can
connect<00:01:27.979> it<00:01:29.560> to<00:01:30.560> other<00:01:30.770> parts<00:01:31.720> doesn't<00:01:32.720> always

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.080 
connect it to other parts doesn't always

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:39.429 
connect it to other parts doesn't always
have<00:01:33.380> to<00:01:33.409> be<00:01:35.380> like<00:01:36.380> this<00:01:37.450> as<00:01:38.450> you<00:01:38.689> can<00:01:38.869> see<00:01:39.200> each

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:39.439 
have to be like this as you can see each

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:45.070 
have to be like this as you can see each
piece<00:01:39.920> has<00:01:40.220> a<00:01:40.369> little<00:01:40.850> groove<00:01:41.290> so<00:01:42.290> you<00:01:42.350> can<00:01:44.080> you

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
piece has a little groove so you can you

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.230 
piece has a little groove so you can you
could<00:01:45.290> put<00:01:45.530> it<00:01:45.650> at<00:01:45.740> any<00:01:46.220> way<00:01:46.549> you<00:01:46.610> want<00:01:47.030> it<00:01:47.180> to

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
could put it at any way you want it to

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.640 
could put it at any way you want it to
accommodate<00:01:48.110> other<00:01:48.320> action<00:01:48.979> basis<00:01:49.490> but<00:01:50.650> since

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:51.650 
accommodate other action basis but since

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.039 
accommodate other action basis but since
I<00:01:51.890> don't<00:01:51.920> have<00:01:52.280> any<00:01:52.670> other<00:01:52.909> action<00:01:53.180> bases<00:01:53.840> this

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:54.049 
I don't have any other action bases this

00:01:54.049 --> 00:02:00.179 
I don't have any other action bases this
is<00:01:54.290> the<00:01:55.070> most<00:01:55.369> i<00:01:56.170> like<00:01:57.170> to<00:01:57.380> do<00:01:57.560> with<00:01:57.770> it<00:01:58.570> now

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:00.189 
is the most i like to do with it now

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:04.569 
is the most i like to do with it now
down<00:02:01.189> here<00:02:01.390> this<00:02:02.390> part<00:02:02.780> rotates<00:02:03.530> also<00:02:04.310> comes

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:04.579 
down here this part rotates also comes

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:10.660 
down here this part rotates also comes
out<00:02:07.329> as<00:02:08.329> you<00:02:08.509> can<00:02:08.720> see<00:02:09.019> has<00:02:09.379> like<00:02:09.799> sparkling

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
out as you can see has like sparkling

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.729 
out as you can see has like sparkling
thingies<00:02:11.180> in<00:02:11.209> the<00:02:11.569> plastic<00:02:12.080> which<00:02:12.260> make<00:02:12.530> it

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739 
thingies in the plastic which make it

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:16.150 
thingies in the plastic which make it
look<00:02:12.920> awesome

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.070 

so<00:02:17.160> you<00:02:17.250> can<00:02:17.460> rotate<00:02:17.850> the<00:02:18.060> whole<00:02:18.240> thing<00:02:18.540> around

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
so you can rotate the whole thing around

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.699 
so you can rotate the whole thing around
and<00:02:19.620> this<00:02:19.950> little<00:02:20.280> tab<00:02:20.700> here<00:02:21.150> goes<00:02:22.140> into<00:02:22.560> these

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
and this little tab here goes into these

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:27.980 
and this little tab here goes into these
notches<00:02:23.160> here<00:02:23.850> which<00:02:24.720> allow<00:02:25.080> you<00:02:25.610> to<00:02:26.990> incline

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
notches here which allow you to incline

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.270 
notches here which allow you to incline
the<00:02:28.319> base<00:02:28.560> as<00:02:28.890> much<00:02:29.280> as<00:02:29.520> you<00:02:29.670> want<00:02:29.910> oh<00:02:31.070> not<00:02:32.070> as

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
the base as much as you want oh not as

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.020 
the base as much as you want oh not as
much<00:02:32.490> as<00:02:33.000> you<00:02:33.209> can<00:02:33.390> see<00:02:34.370> that's<00:02:35.370> as<00:02:35.610> far<00:02:35.970> down

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
much as you can see that's as far down

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.580 
much as you can see that's as far down
as<00:02:36.270> as<00:02:36.750> it'll<00:02:37.260> da<00:02:37.790> one<00:02:38.790> of<00:02:38.940> the<00:02:39.030> reasons<00:02:39.600> that<00:02:39.900> i

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
as as it'll da one of the reasons that i

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.920 
as as it'll da one of the reasons that i
bought<00:02:40.890> the<00:02:41.130> space<00:02:41.430> was<00:02:41.790> for<00:02:42.150> my<00:02:42.300> little<00:02:42.540> photo

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
bought the space was for my little photo

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.360 
bought the space was for my little photo
shoots<00:02:43.580> so<00:02:44.580> I<00:02:44.610> could<00:02:45.090> take<00:02:46.080> different<00:02:46.470> dynamic

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
shoots so I could take different dynamic

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:55.790 
shoots so I could take different dynamic
pictures<00:02:47.940> of<00:02:48.270> the<00:02:48.600> model<00:02:48.989> kits<00:02:54.290> there's<00:02:55.290> a<00:02:55.380> tab

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
pictures of the model kits there's a tab

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:01.340 
pictures of the model kits there's a tab
here<00:02:56.330> which<00:02:57.330> allows<00:02:57.840> you<00:02:58.230> to<00:02:59.090> lies<00:03:00.090> and<00:03:00.660> lower

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
here which allows you to lies and lower

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:11.180 
here which allows you to lies and lower
this<00:03:07.220> so<00:03:08.220> you<00:03:08.280> get<00:03:08.760> a<00:03:08.790> screw<00:03:09.239> here<00:03:09.769> and<00:03:10.769> this

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
this so you get a screw here and this

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:16.310 
this so you get a screw here and this
allows<00:03:11.640> for<00:03:12.800> this<00:03:13.800> part<00:03:14.130> to<00:03:14.310> move<00:03:14.489> I<00:03:14.760> did<00:03:15.720> make

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
allows for this part to move I did make

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.670 
allows for this part to move I did make
it<00:03:16.530> a<00:03:16.650> little<00:03:16.830> tight<00:03:17.280> in<00:03:17.610> Tunisia<00:03:18.680> because

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
it a little tight in Tunisia because

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.660 
it a little tight in Tunisia because
