up<00:04:45.470> coming<00:04:46.040> to<00:04:46.250> that<00:04:46.490> restaurant<00:04:46.850> there<00:04:47.510> and

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
up coming to that restaurant there and

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.480 
up coming to that restaurant there and
then<00:04:48.110> they<00:04:48.260> all<00:04:48.410> came<00:04:48.650> outside<00:04:48.830> and<00:04:49.100> saw<00:04:49.430> me

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
then they all came outside and saw me

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.210 
then they all came outside and saw me
and<00:04:49.850> until<00:04:50.420> it<00:04:50.660> was<00:04:50.780> at<00:04:50.930> that<00:04:51.110> moment<00:04:51.440> is<00:04:51.800> when

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:52.220 
and until it was at that moment is when

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:53.680 
and until it was at that moment is when
everybody<00:04:52.610> thought<00:04:52.760> that<00:04:52.820> you<00:04:53.270> know<00:04:53.360> this<00:04:53.540> is

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690 
everybody thought that you know this is

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:55.450 
everybody thought that you know this is
dead<00:04:53.990> you're<00:04:54.230> just<00:04:54.380> renting<00:04:54.590> to<00:04:54.860> cargo<00:04:55.070> no<00:04:55.430> I

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 
dead you're just renting to cargo no I

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.330 
dead you're just renting to cargo no I
owned<00:04:55.910> that<00:04:56.270> car<00:04:56.570> down<00:04:56.870> so<00:04:57.140> it<00:04:57.890> was<00:04:58.010> a<00:04:58.040> family

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
owned that car down so it was a family

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:59.800 
owned that car down so it was a family
feeling<00:04:58.970> and<00:04:59.120> it<00:04:59.330> was<00:04:59.420> just<00:04:59.570> a<00:04:59.660> great

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 
feeling and it was just a great

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:01.600 
feeling and it was just a great
experience<00:05:00.080> it's<00:05:00.440> a<00:05:00.500> lifetime<00:05:01.040> experience

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
experience it's a lifetime experience

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:07.800 
experience it's a lifetime experience
you<00:05:01.910> could<00:05:02.030> only<00:05:02.210> do<00:05:02.450> what<00:05:02.660> type

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:07.810 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:10.290 

I<00:05:08.250> never<00:05:09.250> thought<00:05:09.460> I'd<00:05:09.610> actually<00:05:09.730> see<00:05:10.060> one<00:05:10.210> of

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300 
I never thought I'd actually see one of

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.510 
I never thought I'd actually see one of
these<00:05:10.360> things<00:05:10.420> like<00:05:10.870> every<00:05:11.350> time<00:05:11.950> I<00:05:12.130> was<00:05:12.370> just

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
these things like every time I was just

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.329 
these things like every time I was just
driving<00:05:12.639> by

00:05:17.329 --> 00:05:17.339 

00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:24.589 

my<00:05:18.339> heart

00:05:24.589 --> 00:05:24.599 

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:29.200 

that's<00:05:25.139> when<00:05:25.469> a<00:05:25.499> Facebook<00:05:26.069> page

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.210 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:31.780 

I<00:05:29.440> didn't<00:05:30.440> just<00:05:30.740> wanted<00:05:31.010> DeLorean<00:05:31.460> I<00:05:31.550> wanted

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:31.790 
I didn't just wanted DeLorean I wanted

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:33.820 
I didn't just wanted DeLorean I wanted
to<00:05:31.880> learn<00:05:32.000> in<00:05:32.150> time<00:05:32.390> machine<00:05:32.840> so<00:05:33.260> I<00:05:33.290> got<00:05:33.470> a<00:05:33.500> flux

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:33.830 
to learn in time machine so I got a flux

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:35.710 
to learn in time machine so I got a flux
capacitor<00:05:33.950> which<00:05:34.790> is<00:05:34.820> what<00:05:35.060> makes<00:05:35.210> time<00:05:35.420> trip

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:35.720 
capacitor which is what makes time trip

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.830 
capacitor which is what makes time trip
travel<00:05:36.320> possible<00:05:36.920> and<00:05:37.130> I<00:05:37.910> just<00:05:38.270> kept<00:05:38.480> it<00:05:38.630> that

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:38.840 
travel possible and I just kept it that

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.170 
travel possible and I just kept it that
way<00:05:39.110> and<00:05:39.380> I<00:05:39.500> put<00:05:39.680> new<00:05:39.920> seats<00:05:40.220> and<00:05:40.460> I<00:05:40.640> realized

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:41.180 
way and I put new seats and I realized

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.960 
way and I put new seats and I realized
then<00:05:41.510> that<00:05:41.810> it's<00:05:42.050> so<00:05:42.200> beautiful<00:05:42.440> I<00:05:42.950> can't<00:05:43.850> do

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:43.970 
then that it's so beautiful I can't do

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:44.920 
then that it's so beautiful I can't do
anything<00:05:44.210> more<00:05:44.480> to<00:05:44.510> it

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:44.930 
anything more to it

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:46.720 
anything more to it
I<00:05:44.960> can't<00:05:45.290> drill<00:05:45.470> holes<00:05:45.740> in<00:05:46.010> it<00:05:46.130> it's<00:05:46.610> a

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:46.730 
I can't drill holes in it it's a

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:48.100 
I can't drill holes in it it's a
DeLorean<00:05:47.030> it's<00:05:47.390> going<00:05:47.510> to<00:05:47.570> stay<00:05:47.720> a<00:05:47.750> DeLorean

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:48.110 
DeLorean it's going to stay a DeLorean

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:50.500 
DeLorean it's going to stay a DeLorean
it's<00:05:48.830> then<00:05:49.160> when<00:05:49.190> I<00:05:49.490> realized<00:05:49.940> that<00:05:50.150> I'm<00:05:50.330> going

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:50.510 
it's then when I realized that I'm going

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:52.390 
it's then when I realized that I'm going
to<00:05:50.570> try<00:05:50.750> to<00:05:50.780> find<00:05:51.080> another<00:05:51.230> car<00:05:51.740> to<00:05:52.250> make<00:05:52.340> it

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:52.400 
to try to find another car to make it

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.090 
to try to find another car to make it
into<00:05:52.700> a<00:05:52.730> time<00:05:53.030> machine<00:05:53.060> I<00:05:53.780> wound<00:05:54.590> up<00:05:54.770> finding

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:55.100 
into a time machine I wound up finding

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:57.220 
into a time machine I wound up finding
someone<00:05:55.640> who<00:05:55.880> lived<00:05:56.240> in<00:05:56.570> check<00:05:56.780> outside

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:57.230 
someone who lived in check outside

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:59.980 
someone who lived in check outside
Chicago<00:05:57.950> and<00:05:58.240> that<00:05:59.240> cars<00:05:59.450> been<00:05:59.510> sitting<00:05:59.780> there

00:05:59.980 --> 00:05:59.990 
Chicago and that cars been sitting there

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:02.890 
Chicago and that cars been sitting there
for<00:06:00.110> about<00:06:00.140> 10<00:06:00.440> 11<00:06:00.560> years<00:06:01.390> when<00:06:02.390> I<00:06:02.420> got<00:06:02.660> this

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:02.900 
for about 10 11 years when I got this

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:04.540 
for about 10 11 years when I got this
DeLorean<00:06:03.320> where<00:06:03.770> it's<00:06:03.890> been<00:06:04.040> sitting<00:06:04.370> for<00:06:04.400> a

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:04.550 
DeLorean where it's been sitting for a

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:06.040 
DeLorean where it's been sitting for a
very<00:06:04.790> long<00:06:05.030> time<00:06:05.300> I<00:06:05.450> had<00:06:05.600> to<00:06:05.660> give<00:06:05.780> it<00:06:05.870> a<00:06:05.900> new

life to it

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:27.790 
life to it
and<00:06:26.270> a<00:06:26.690> life<00:06:26.870> that<00:06:27.050> you<00:06:27.140> can't<00:06:27.350> get<00:06:27.440> out<00:06:27.500> of<00:06:27.680> any

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:27.800 
and a life that you can't get out of any

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:30.290 
other kind of car it wasn't until I got

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:32.620 
other kind of car it wasn't until I got
this<00:06:30.710> DeLorean<00:06:31.010> time<00:06:31.370> machine<00:06:31.430> that<00:06:32.300> I<00:06:32.330> really

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:32.630 
this DeLorean time machine that I really

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:34.120 
this DeLorean time machine that I really
felt<00:06:32.870> that<00:06:33.080> time<00:06:33.440> travel<00:06:33.680> is<00:06:33.890> possible

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:34.130 
felt that time travel is possible

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:36.700 
felt that time travel is possible
whether<00:06:34.670> it's<00:06:34.850> in<00:06:34.940> the<00:06:35.030> mind<00:06:35.300> or<00:06:35.540> the<00:06:36.200> real<00:06:36.380> and

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:36.710 
whether it's in the mind or the real and

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:38.470 
whether it's in the mind or the real and
you<00:06:37.280> get<00:06:37.460> that<00:06:37.580> connection<00:06:38.000> that<00:06:38.300> you<00:06:38.360> feel

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:38.480 
you get that connection that you feel

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.600
