00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:14.940
 Hello everyone, I will show you today 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.800
 you mod called crafting saw 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.199
 he adds us three here 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.990
 buildings and what can we do with them 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.720
 In the first 1 we crafted out of seven 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.269
 near her we can put some 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.160
 one kind of objects is meat for 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.410
 this just hold down the right mouse button 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:35.219
 on seeing there is on here this upper bound 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.950
 all to get out of there this kind of we 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.800
 must hold down the left shift to take an empty 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.750
 empty hand and also aim at that 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.760
 face clicking the right mouse button 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.899
 all well of course the usual chest is more convenient but 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.329
 let's say you can show that you 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.059
 some rich on server putting 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.430
 myself here is such a house in my very 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.739
 comfortable yes and it looks nice let's 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.770
 let's leave three emeralds so rotate and 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.930
 move on here so here we are 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.200
 next building here we need 6 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.540
 cobblestone and one workbench this is some 3d 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.520
 crafting yes and in it we can also 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.090
 getting throw a thing let's say 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.140
 we make ourselves first shelves and then from 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.960
 we will make sticks 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.450
 diamond pickaxe and so here we do 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.210
 and get shelves to do get 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.310
 hold down the left shift and press the left button 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.430
 mouse on our workbench 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.100
 all the way we can not do 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.570
 kiku if we come from the wrong side with 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.150
 which set the workbench that is 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.450
 let's do it from this side not 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:42.990
 get you need to come up with exactly 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.780
 sides from where you put so for this 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.850
 so we do kraft and as you see 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.790
 everything turns out we press the left shift 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.880
 the usual cool mined on the collar 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.600
 by the way to show how many items 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.869
 you lies 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.520
 you need to hold you just need to right click 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.189
 mouse poke on one of these here 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.469
 parties that is, let's say here or here 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:05.850
 it is also very convenient but now let's 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.009
 look at the third subject 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.489
 to make it you need 3 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.530
 usually 6 ordinary stones and 1 stove think 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.540
 you guessed it was a 3d oven 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.900
 down we have to impose coal let's say 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.280
 so much we have enough up any ore or 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.600
 what you can fry 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:27.890
 Here I will take a diamond and show you how much 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:30.510
 I will have things and as you can see we have 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.790
 they for each other in so here swim 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.350
 that is, they are still flying up 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.000
 you can not get them but when they are already 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.440
 sailed also pinch left shift 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.350
 ordinary class is not 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:43.620
 and here our items can be taken 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:47.130
 items coal there I don't know this 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:49.680
 everything is very simple I think you understand 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:52.470
 This mod with you was Hades I hope you 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.160
