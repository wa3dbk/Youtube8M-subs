00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 
in construction or business or you know

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:08.469 
in construction or business or you know
a<00:01:06.649> lot<00:01:06.890> of<00:01:06.950> the<00:01:07.340> things<00:01:08.000> that<00:01:08.060> go<00:01:08.149> along<00:01:08.329> with

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
a lot of the things that go along with

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:12.789 
a lot of the things that go along with
that<00:01:08.659> so<00:01:09.110> we<00:01:09.920> definitely<00:01:11.079> very<00:01:12.079> tense<00:01:12.380> it<00:01:12.619> was

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799 
that so we definitely very tense it was

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:15.030 
that so we definitely very tense it was
a<00:01:12.860> very<00:01:12.979> tense<00:01:13.219> situation<00:01:13.310> but<00:01:13.969> we<00:01:14.000> did<00:01:14.299> it<00:01:14.329> and

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 
a very tense situation but we did it and

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.980 
a very tense situation but we did it and
we<00:01:16.040> did<00:01:16.189> it<00:01:16.310> several<00:01:16.579> toughest<00:01:17.119> I<00:01:17.420> think<00:01:17.689> we

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
we did it several toughest I think we

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.480 
we did it several toughest I think we
learned<00:01:18.200> from<00:01:18.560> it<00:01:18.619> and<00:01:18.920> that's<00:01:19.130> really<00:01:19.310> what

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
learned from it and that's really what

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.129 
learned from it and that's really what
taught<00:01:19.700> us<00:01:19.850> how<00:01:19.880> to<00:01:19.999> work<00:01:20.240> together<00:01:20.420> because

00:01:21.129 --> 00:01:21.139

it<00:01:21.350> was<00:01:21.499> from<00:01:21.920> that<00:01:22.159> point<00:01:22.399> on<00:01:22.579> I<00:01:22.609> would<00:01:22.759> kind

00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:22.969 
it was from that point on I would kind

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:24.730 
it was from that point on I would kind
of<00:01:23.030> learn<00:01:23.209> to<00:01:23.450> give<00:01:23.749> each<00:01:23.869> other<00:01:24.020> space<00:01:24.380> that

kind<00:03:07.390> of<00:03:07.569> like<00:03:08.110> the<00:03:08.560> limitations<00:03:09.220> I've

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:09.819

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
tattooing and I think they can work to

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.990 
tattooing and I think they can work to
your<00:03:13.780> advantage<00:03:13.930> if<00:03:14.560> you<00:03:14.769> if<00:03:15.549> you<00:03:15.730> embrace

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
tattoos look really classic and not even

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.319 
tattoos look really classic and not even
really<00:03:20.680> having<00:03:20.980> to<00:03:21.100> do<00:03:21.280> classic<00:03:21.790> images<00:03:22.120> but

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:22.329
