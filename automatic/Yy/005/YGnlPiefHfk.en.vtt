into some birds we came up on some
mallards<00:01:49.400> pretty<00:01:49.670> quickly<00:01:50.000> but<00:01:50.990> what<00:01:51.140> I<00:01:51.170> found

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:51.410 
mallards pretty quickly but what I found

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.230 
mallards pretty quickly but what I found
out<00:01:51.530> using<00:01:51.650> this<00:01:51.800> GoPro<00:01:52.070> camera<00:01:52.730> is<00:01:52.880> that<00:01:52.910> you

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
out using this GoPro camera is that you

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.730 
out using this GoPro camera is that you
can't<00:01:53.480> see<00:01:53.690> the<00:01:53.810> birds<00:01:53.990> very<00:01:54.380> well<00:01:54.590> even

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
can't see the birds very well even

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.800 
can't see the birds very well even
though<00:01:54.890> they're<00:01:55.070> relatively<00:01:55.430> close<00:01:55.760> the<00:01:56.570> zoom

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
though they're relatively close the zoom

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.800 
though they're relatively close the zoom
on<00:01:56.990> the<00:01:57.080> camera<00:01:57.440> is<00:01:57.500> just<00:01:57.530> not<00:01:57.890> that<00:01:58.280> good<00:01:58.810> for

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
on the camera is just not that good for

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.020 
on the camera is just not that good for
this<00:01:59.930> purpose<00:02:00.440> but<00:02:01.160> anyway<00:02:01.520> it<00:02:01.670> gives<00:02:01.880> you<00:02:02.000> a

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
this purpose but anyway it gives you a

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.350 
this purpose but anyway it gives you a
front<00:02:02.450> seat<00:02:02.750> action<00:02:03.410> on<00:02:04.370> what<00:02:04.640> we<00:02:04.760> experienced

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
front seat action on what we experienced

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:45.100 
front seat action on what we experienced
that<00:02:05.390> day<00:02:05.660> so<00:02:05.720> I<00:02:05.990> hope<00:02:06.140> you'll<00:02:06.320> enjoy
