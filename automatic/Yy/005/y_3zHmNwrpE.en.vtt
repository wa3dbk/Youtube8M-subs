rack<00:02:08.179> up<00:02:08.420> all<00:02:08.629> three<00:02:09.409> of<00:02:09.619> your<00:02:09.769> kill<00:02:10.159> streaks

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:10.519 
rack up all three of your kill streaks

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:12.970 
rack up all three of your kill streaks
in<00:02:10.729> one<00:02:10.939> go<00:02:11.209> but<00:02:11.870> if<00:02:12.139> you<00:02:12.260> camp<00:02:12.499> in<00:02:12.769> and

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
in one go but if you camp in and

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.890 
in one go but if you camp in and
building<00:02:13.519> nowhere<00:02:14.269> near<00:02:14.480> not<00:02:14.659> only

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
building nowhere near not only

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.140 
building nowhere near not only
objectives<00:02:15.470> you<00:02:16.099> get<00:02:16.280> less<00:02:16.610> on<00:02:16.760> your<00:02:16.909> score

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150

streaks<00:02:17.450> i<00:02:17.629> think<00:02:17.870> i<00:02:17.930> was<00:02:18.019> going<00:02:18.170> to<00:02:18.230> actually

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:18.349 
streaks i think i was going to actually

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:19.990 
streaks i think i was going to actually
change<00:02:18.829> the<00:02:18.980> dynamics<00:02:19.610> of<00:02:19.730> the<00:02:19.819> game

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
change the dynamics of the game

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.460 
change the dynamics of the game
especially<00:02:20.269> on<00:02:20.629> the<00:02:21.579> objective<00:02:22.579> game<00:02:22.790> types

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
especially on the objective game types

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.750 
especially on the objective game types
now<00:02:24.470> that<00:02:24.799> thing<00:02:25.010> you've<00:02:25.129> actually<00:02:25.280> seen<00:02:25.579> me

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
now that thing you've actually seen me

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.280 
now that thing you've actually seen me
from<00:02:26.000> the<00:02:26.120> floor<00:02:26.360> there<00:02:26.540> is<00:02:26.629> just<00:02:26.930> the

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
from the floor there is just the

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.100 
from the floor there is just the
equivalent<00:02:27.829> of<00:02:27.980> a<00:02:28.099> motion<00:02:28.579> sensor<00:02:28.849> room<00:02:29.390> on

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
equivalent of a motion sensor room on

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.009 
equivalent of a motion sensor room on
the<00:02:30.709> other<00:02:30.739> ones<00:02:31.069> however<00:02:31.480> instead<00:02:32.480> of<00:02:32.720> just<00:02:32.870> a

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
the other ones however instead of just a

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:34.960 
the other ones however instead of just a
dot<00:02:33.230> coming<00:02:33.620> up<00:02:33.739> on<00:02:33.950> you<00:02:34.099> actual<00:02:34.489> mini-map

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
dot coming up on you actual mini-map

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.330 
dot coming up on you actual mini-map
you'll<00:02:35.180> get<00:02:35.359> it<00:02:35.480> right<00:02:35.650> it'll<00:02:36.650> come<00:02:36.829> up<00:02:36.859> as<00:02:37.159> it

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
you'll get it right it'll come up as it

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.069 
you'll get it right it'll come up as it
would<00:02:37.579> say<00:02:37.970> if<00:02:38.120> you've<00:02:38.329> got<00:02:38.540> a<00:02:38.569> black<00:02:38.840> beard

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:39.079 
would say if you've got a black beard

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:40.630 
would say if you've got a black beard
for<00:02:39.260> a<00:02:39.290> modern<00:02:39.439> warfare<00:02:39.680> 3<00:02:39.890> or<00:02:40.280> you've<00:02:40.430> got

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
for a modern warfare 3 or you've got

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.770 
for a modern warfare 3 or you've got
orbital<00:02:41.239> vsat<00:02:41.420> from<00:02:41.930> this<00:02:42.170> actual<00:02:42.530> game<00:02:43.780> so

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
orbital vsat from this actual game so

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.899 
orbital vsat from this actual game so
yeah<00:02:45.019> at<00:02:45.170> the<00:02:45.260> moment<00:02:45.590> I'm<00:02:45.709> pretty<00:02:46.250> much<00:02:46.400> not

00:02:46.899 --> 00:02:46.909 
yeah at the moment I'm pretty much not

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:48.399 
yeah at the moment I'm pretty much not
getting<00:02:47.180> what's<00:02:47.389> Joey<00:02:47.659> going<00:02:47.959> that<00:02:48.109> side<00:02:48.319> of

00:02:48.399 --> 00:02:48.409 
getting what's Joey going that side of

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:50.199 
getting what's Joey going that side of
them<00:02:48.680> up<00:02:48.829> so<00:02:49.010> I<00:02:49.040> think<00:02:49.280> at<00:02:49.400> this<00:02:49.519> point<00:02:49.639> I'm<00:02:50.030> if

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
them up so I think at this point I'm if

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:53.470 
them up so I think at this point I'm if
you<00:02:50.299> can<00:02:50.480> write<00:02:50.629> one-nil<00:02:51.230> down<00:02:51.260> I<00:02:51.799> need<00:02:52.760> to<00:02:53.000> you

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
you can write one-nil down I need to you

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.410 
you can write one-nil down I need to you
know<00:02:53.599> try<00:02:53.659> to<00:02:53.840> capture<00:02:54.109> if<00:02:54.290> like<00:02:54.470> myself<00:02:55.060> is<00:02:56.060> I

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
know try to capture if like myself is I

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:57.910 
know try to capture if like myself is I
think<00:02:56.480> right<00:02:56.840> let's<00:02:57.139> try<00:02:57.319> going<00:02:57.590> around<00:02:57.769> the

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
think right let's try going around the

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.699 
think right let's try going around the
other<00:02:57.980> way<00:02:58.659> seems<00:02:59.659> a<00:02:59.780> bit<00:02:59.870> quiet<00:03:00.139> around<00:03:00.409> here

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
other way seems a bit quiet around here

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:04.270 
other way seems a bit quiet around here
so<00:03:01.750> at<00:03:02.750> this<00:03:02.780> point<00:03:03.139> my<00:03:03.260> thinking<00:03:03.799> is<00:03:03.950> I<00:03:03.980> don't

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
so at this point my thinking is I don't

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.250 
so at this point my thinking is I don't
really<00:03:04.459> want<00:03:04.790> to<00:03:04.849> lose<00:03:05.030> because<00:03:05.180> on<00:03:05.629> the<00:03:06.079> Lee

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
really want to lose because on the Lee

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.319 
really want to lose because on the Lee
played<00:03:06.680> the<00:03:06.859> actual<00:03:07.159> first<00:03:07.400> five<00:03:07.670> matches<00:03:08.209> you

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:08.329 
played the actual first five matches you

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:11.080 
played the actual first five matches you
play<00:03:08.720> our<00:03:09.379> actual<00:03:09.859> placement<00:03:10.159> matches<00:03:10.639> so

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
play our actual placement matches so

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.640 
play our actual placement matches so
depending<00:03:11.569> on<00:03:11.569> how<00:03:11.720> you<00:03:11.870> go<00:03:12.200> on<00:03:12.349> on<00:03:12.470> those

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
depending on how you go on on those

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.819 
depending on how you go on on those
matches<00:03:13.159> is<00:03:13.340> depending<00:03:13.849> how<00:03:14.030> well<00:03:14.659> what<00:03:15.260> legal

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:15.829 
matches is depending how well what legal

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:17.559 
matches is depending how well what legal
series<00:03:16.370> they'll<00:03:16.579> put<00:03:16.849> you<00:03:17.000> in<00:03:17.150> but<00:03:17.359> I<00:03:17.420> haven't

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:17.569 
series they'll put you in but I haven't

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:20.530 
series they'll put you in but I haven't
actually<00:03:17.900> completed<00:03:18.590> all<00:03:18.739> of<00:03:18.769> the<00:03:19.540> placement

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
actually completed all of the placement

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:21.939 
actually completed all of the placement
games<00:03:20.690> yet<00:03:20.900> so<00:03:21.049> I<00:03:21.139> don't<00:03:21.199> know<00:03:21.530> I<00:03:21.650> it's

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:21.949 
games yet so I don't know I it's

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:23.979 
games yet so I don't know I it's
actually<00:03:22.280> going<00:03:22.430> to<00:03:22.519> work<00:03:22.730> but<00:03:23.569> yet<00:03:23.720> same

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
actually going to work but yet same

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:25.360 
actually going to work but yet same
again<00:03:24.260> I've<00:03:24.349> just<00:03:24.500> thrown<00:03:24.650> one<00:03:24.919> of<00:03:25.010> those<00:03:25.129> in

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
again I've just thrown one of those in

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.129 
again I've just thrown one of those in
motion<00:03:25.790> sensor<00:03:26.269> grenade<00:03:26.569> things<00:03:26.870> on<00:03:27.049> the

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:27.139 
motion sensor grenade things on the

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:30.670 
motion sensor grenade things on the
floor<00:03:28.419> so<00:03:29.419> at<00:03:29.780> this<00:03:29.840> point<00:03:30.199> you're<00:03:30.409> thinking

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
capture the flag is now because tree art

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.649 
capture the flag is now because tree art
tend<00:03:40.310> to<00:03:40.430> do<00:03:40.549> this<00:03:40.760> quite<00:03:41.030> well<00:03:41.269> this<00:03:41.419> game

UV UAV open somebody kills somebody

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:13.270 
UV UAV open somebody kills somebody
while<00:07:11.000> your<00:07:11.210> UAVs<00:07:11.720> up<00:07:11.960> you<00:07:12.409> get<00:07:12.590> 10<00:07:12.830> points<00:07:13.009> on

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:13.280 
while your UAVs up you get 10 points on

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:15.760 
while your UAVs up you get 10 points on
your<00:07:13.310> scores<00:07:13.699> three<00:07:14.000> so<00:07:14.419> I<00:07:14.659> could<00:07:15.259> imagine<00:07:15.500> if

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:15.770 
your scores three so I could imagine if

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:17.890 
your scores three so I could imagine if
you<00:07:15.889> get<00:07:16.069> UAV<00:07:16.430> and<00:07:16.550> come<00:07:16.880> to<00:07:17.060> UAV<00:07:17.360> that<00:07:17.690> might

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:17.900 
you get UAV and come to UAV that might

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:19.749 
you get UAV and come to UAV that might
be<00:07:18.110> enough<00:07:18.440> just<00:07:18.770> to<00:07:18.860> take<00:07:19.039> you<00:07:19.159> up<00:07:19.280> to<00:07:19.310> eat<00:07:19.520> you

00:07:19.749 --> 00:07:19.759 
be enough just to take you up to eat you

00:07:19.759 --> 00:07:21.790 
be enough just to take you up to eat you
know<00:07:19.789> your<00:07:20.090> big<00:07:20.300> kill<00:07:20.599> streak<00:07:20.960> so<00:07:21.530> if<00:07:21.620> you<00:07:21.710> have

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:21.800 
know your big kill streak so if you have

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.830 
know your big kill streak so if you have
too<00:07:22.009> low<00:07:22.310> ones<00:07:22.580> and<00:07:22.789> then<00:07:22.909> one<00:07:23.120> high<00:07:23.360> one<00:07:23.630> that

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:23.840 
too low ones and then one high one that

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:27.490 
too low ones and then one high one that
could<00:07:24.020> make<00:07:24.229> sense<00:07:25.330> so<00:07:26.330> yeah<00:07:26.509> guys<00:07:26.690> not<00:07:27.110> not

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:27.500 
could make sense so yeah guys not not
