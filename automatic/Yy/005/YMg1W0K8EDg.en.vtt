don't<00:00:54.930> think<00:00:55.170> it's<00:00:55.289> a<00:00:55.350> good<00:00:55.500> idea<00:00:55.620> for<00:00:55.980> the

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
don't think it's a good idea for the

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.610 
don't think it's a good idea for the
novice<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.059> reason<00:00:57.420> is<00:00:57.600> novices<00:00:58.289> don't

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
novice and the reason is novices don't

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.869 
novice and the reason is novices don't
know<00:00:58.739> their<00:00:58.890> body<00:00:59.129> well<00:00:59.370> enough<00:00:59.640> they<00:00:59.760> don't

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
know the weights and the way different

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.030 
know the weights and the way different

weights feel and how they should move

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.380 
weights feel and how they should move
well<00:01:05.339> enough<00:01:05.670> for<00:01:05.820> them<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.180> really

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
well enough for them to really

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.120 
well enough for them to really
effectively<00:01:06.869> use<00:01:07.260> our<00:01:07.439> P<00:01:07.590> East<00:01:07.770> you<00:01:08.010> know<00:01:08.100> I

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
effectively use our P East you know I

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.179 
effectively use our P East you know I
would<00:01:08.460> rather<00:01:08.760> them<00:01:09.409> stick<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.590> very<00:01:10.770> strict

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
would rather them stick to very strict

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.289 
would rather them stick to very strict
numbers<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:12.000> very<00:01:12.270> strict<00:01:12.600> programming

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:14.299 
numbers and very strict programming

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:16.429 
numbers and very strict programming
purely<00:01:15.299> because<00:01:15.479> of<00:01:15.659> that<00:01:15.869> but<00:01:16.020> when<00:01:16.200> someone

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
purely because of that but when someone

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.710 
purely because of that but when someone
reaches<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.950> intermediate<00:01:17.790> level<00:01:17.820> enough<00:01:18.479> I

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
reaches the intermediate level enough I

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.520 
reaches the intermediate level enough I
think

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
think

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.880 
think
RPE<00:01:19.890> can<00:01:20.759> be<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:20.970> very<00:01:21.360> very<00:01:21.659> useful<00:01:21.810> tool<00:01:22.290> if

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
RPE can be a very very useful tool if

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.700 
RPE can be a very very useful tool if
used<00:01:23.670> correctly<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:24.330> any<00:01:24.930> has<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.170> song<00:01:25.470> with<00:01:25.680> a

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
used correctly and any has a song with a

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.230 
used correctly and any has a song with a
bit<00:01:25.920> of<00:01:26.040> experience<00:01:26.310> at<00:01:26.580> least<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:26.880> year

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
bit of experience at least a year

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.899 
bit of experience at least a year
serious<00:01:27.720> training<00:01:28.049> experience<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:28.790> it<00:01:29.790> is

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
serious training experience and it is

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.280 
serious training experience and it is
something<00:01:30.119> I<00:01:30.299> personally<00:01:30.540> use<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.170> I<00:01:31.229> do

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
something I personally use and I do

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.410 
something I personally use and I do
advocate<00:01:32.009> I<00:01:32.250> just<00:01:32.700> don't<00:01:32.909> think<00:01:33.119> it's<00:01:33.270> good

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
advocate I just don't think it's good

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.260 
advocate I just don't think it's good
for<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.689> novice<00:01:34.640> and<00:01:35.640> I<00:01:35.759> think<00:01:36.000> it<00:01:36.150> would

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
for the novice and I think it would

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.899 
for the novice and I think it would
benefit<00:01:36.780> any<00:01:37.049> lifter<00:01:37.710> who<00:01:38.490> is<00:01:38.670> at<00:01:38.790> the

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
benefit any lifter who is at the

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.580 
benefit any lifter who is at the
intermediate<00:01:39.390> stage<00:01:39.600> not<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:39.960> at<00:01:40.079> least<00:01:40.350> use

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
bottom of a strict press I could make

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:47.780 
bottom of a strict press I could make
the<00:02:46.170> standard<00:02:46.590> joke<00:02:46.829> which<00:02:47.010> is<00:02:47.190> true<00:02:47.489> and<00:02:47.670> say

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
the standard joke which is true and say

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.400 
the standard joke which is true and say
yeah<00:02:48.000> you<00:02:48.030> just<00:02:48.329> need<00:02:48.450> to<00:02:48.629> get<00:02:48.720> stronger<00:02:49.140> and

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
yeah you just need to get stronger and

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:50.690 
yeah you just need to get stronger and
then<00:02:49.500> you'll<00:02:49.590> be<00:02:49.680> able<00:02:49.769> to<00:02:49.950> explode<00:02:50.310> a<00:02:50.340> heavier

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
then you'll be able to explode a heavier

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.910 
then you'll be able to explode a heavier
weight<00:02:50.940> up<00:02:51.120> more<00:02:51.329> and<00:02:52.140> you<00:02:52.260> do<00:02:52.410> that<00:02:52.560> by<00:02:52.739> doing

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
weight up more and you do that by doing

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.069 
weight up more and you do that by doing
the<00:02:53.129> lift<00:02:53.340> more<00:02:53.489> often<00:02:53.879> but<00:02:54.480> that's<00:02:54.690> kind<00:02:54.930> of<00:02:54.989> a

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.079 
the lift more often but that's kind of a

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:57.110 
the lift more often but that's kind of a
cliche<00:02:55.500> answer<00:02:55.890> really<00:02:56.160> what<00:02:56.640> you<00:02:56.790> want<00:02:56.970> to<00:02:57.030> do

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
cliche answer really what you want to do

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.550 
cliche answer really what you want to do
if<00:02:57.209> you<00:02:57.299> want<00:02:57.480> to<00:02:57.510> get<00:02:57.629> more<00:02:57.810> explosive<00:02:58.379> with

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
if you want to get more explosive with

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.680 
if you want to get more explosive with
it<00:02:58.709> then<00:02:59.519> you<00:02:59.640> need<00:02:59.819> to<00:02:59.909> do<00:03:00.060> more<00:03:00.299> work

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
it then you need to do more work

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.539 
it then you need to do more work
explosively<00:03:01.440> which<00:03:01.739> means<00:03:02.010> if<00:03:02.220> you<00:03:02.310> need<00:03:02.459> to

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 
explosively which means if you need to

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:05.149 
explosively which means if you need to
reduce<00:03:02.700> the<00:03:02.879> weight<00:03:03.180> 10%<00:03:04.019> then<00:03:04.739> reduce<00:03:05.010> the

00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:05.159 
reduce the weight 10% then reduce the

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:06.979 
reduce the weight 10% then reduce the
weight<00:03:05.340> 10%<00:03:06.030> and<00:03:06.239> practice<00:03:06.629> on<00:03:06.750> getting

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
weight 10% and practice on getting

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.319 
weight 10% and practice on getting
really<00:03:07.230> explosive<00:03:07.709> and<00:03:08.099> pushing<00:03:08.579> the<00:03:08.760> bar<00:03:09.000> as

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:09.329 
really explosive and pushing the bar as

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:12.050 
really explosive and pushing the bar as
hard<00:03:10.260> and<00:03:10.560> as<00:03:10.680> fast<00:03:10.739> as<00:03:11.250> you<00:03:11.400> can

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
hard and as fast as you can

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.539 
hard and as fast as you can
out<00:03:12.959> of<00:03:13.170> the<00:03:13.230> bottle<00:03:13.530> on<00:03:13.680> every<00:03:14.010> single<00:03:14.220> rep

out of the bottle on every single rep
and<00:03:15.090> if<00:03:15.239> it<00:03:15.390> means<00:03:15.540> you've<00:03:15.690> got<00:03:15.840> to<00:03:15.870> reduce<00:03:16.049> the

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:16.379 
and if it means you've got to reduce the

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:18.020 
and if it means you've got to reduce the
weight<00:03:16.500> slightly<00:03:16.799> to<00:03:17.069> do<00:03:17.280> that<00:03:17.459> then<00:03:17.700> go<00:03:17.849> ahead

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
weight slightly to do that then go ahead

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.129 
weight slightly to do that then go ahead
and<00:03:18.150> do<00:03:18.239> that<00:03:18.269> you<00:03:18.510> might<00:03:18.630> have<00:03:18.810> to<00:03:18.900> cut<00:03:19.049> the

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:19.139 
and do that you might have to cut the

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:22.339 
and do that you might have to cut the
weight<00:03:19.290> 10<00:03:19.470> or<00:03:19.590> 15<00:03:19.919> percent<00:03:20.750> but<00:03:21.750> by<00:03:22.290> doing

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:22.349 
weight 10 or 15 percent but by doing

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:26.180 
weight 10 or 15 percent but by doing
that<00:03:22.919> and<00:03:23.220> doing<00:03:23.510> more<00:03:24.510> sets<00:03:25.139> that<00:03:25.440> way<00:03:25.650> so<00:03:26.099> if

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
that and doing more sets that way so if

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.500 
that and doing more sets that way so if
you<00:03:26.310> cut<00:03:26.459> the<00:03:26.579> weight<00:03:26.730> 10<00:03:26.940> or<00:03:27.060> 15<00:03:27.329> percent

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
you cut the weight 10 or 15 percent

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.930 
you cut the weight 10 or 15 percent
you've<00:03:27.900> been<00:03:28.019> doing<00:03:28.319> 3<00:03:28.500> sets<00:03:28.530> of<00:03:28.829> 3<00:03:29.099> then<00:03:29.819> you

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
you've been doing 3 sets of 3 then you

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.080 
you've been doing 3 sets of 3 then you
get<00:03:30.090> up<00:03:30.239> at<00:03:30.389> 2<00:03:30.510> 5<00:03:30.720> or<00:03:30.750> 7<00:03:31.049> sets<00:03:31.379> of<00:03:31.560> 3<00:03:31.739> and<00:03:32.220> focus

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
get up at 2 5 or 7 sets of 3 and focus
