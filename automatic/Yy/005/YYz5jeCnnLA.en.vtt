to<00:02:52.570> plug<00:02:52.600> into<00:02:52.959> so<00:02:53.350> I<00:02:53.380> had<00:02:53.590> to<00:02:53.709> make<00:02:53.890> kind<00:02:54.340> of

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
to plug into so I had to make kind of

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.460 
to plug into so I had to make kind of
improvised<00:02:54.790> right<00:02:55.030> here<00:02:55.290> they're<00:02:56.290> usually

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
improvised right here they're usually

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:57.930 
improvised right here they're usually
the<00:02:56.769> battery<00:02:57.040> were<00:02:57.190> just<00:02:57.400> going<00:02:57.580> right<00:02:57.730> here

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
and it would run I put the black one

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.090 
and it would run I put the black one
here<00:03:04.019> black<00:03:05.019> wire<00:03:05.230> goes<00:03:05.500> into<00:03:05.530> this<00:03:05.860> socket

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
here black wire goes into this socket

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.370 
here black wire goes into this socket
right<00:03:06.370> here<00:03:06.640> and<00:03:07.570> the<00:03:07.630> red<00:03:07.780> one<00:03:07.959> went<00:03:08.140> in<00:03:08.230> here

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
right here and the red one went in here
