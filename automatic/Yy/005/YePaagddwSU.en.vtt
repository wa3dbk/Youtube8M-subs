00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:05.700
 what is it difficult game what 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.150
 typical november kick how can you do that 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:12.150
 match the game so shortly after the final whistle 

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:12.870
 classic holland germany and me 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.790
 think both teams have 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.510
 played a lot of ball possession 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:21.090
 course on both sides and 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.560
 the opportunities not much approved the 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.300
 was very positive today after we 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.950
 Last time you wanted to play 4 4 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.640
 we can start gate in the little 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.279
 we succeeded 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.600
 no offense and calls the 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.760
 one or the other possibility shortly from 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.530
 leipzig you have the chance the individual 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:36.500
 guidance and I think anyway 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.790
 Total visit to China 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.100
 defensively improved in comparison to 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.180
 last game against the sweden 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.239
 offensive all had suffered somewhat 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.559
 so to be expected that, hopefully 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.970
 I suffer a lot from this 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.430
 quite normal especially if you have the 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.900
 demand site looks back to today 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.930
 first played together so first 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.190
 even without a classic lace then 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.320
 so it was natural to another 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.430
 play for us and it was not 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.080
 bad team holland should 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.100
 is a good team and with good 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.080
 single players that you have too 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.640
 viewed in phases and therefore can 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.620
 to be satisfied that we have little 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.700
 have allowed in the ports of love before 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.110
 everything like i said if you want that 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.640
 has played last game 4 4 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.960
 important that the defensive again 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.820
 Safety wins mats hummels when 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.979
 no one asks eight players 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.600
 that works before 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.190
 you actually try it 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.780
 in such a game against high-profile 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.920
 opponent 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.150
 Above all , you can be the same 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.040
 security repeat after the 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.450
 game against Sweden lost a bit 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.190
 Gone is I think has noticed 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.890
 that he has the very last risk 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.750
 both sides was missing 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.040
 because you still saw it 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.970
 probably will give many goals 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.310
 you did not want the first mistake 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.120
 make and then there is just the way a 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.320
 play it for the audience 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.940
 probably not that spectacular 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.380
 have someday asked who has 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.760
 actually a home game far from here 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.670
 the dutch not offensively so 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.619
 I'm not looking forward to much, though 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.270
 Of course it is so that he is now 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:54.560
 always very much on the ball have a lot 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.869
 have possession of the ball and the office of the 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.409
 game have had us not very much 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:59.119
 attacked 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.040
 therefore more needs because the paths 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:03.140
 in the midfield were delivered well by 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.310
 to them and then we have him I have 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.720
 no idea how much percent but then 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.039
 it runs just so my animals a 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.440
 a bit more in balad in between 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.330
 went about as much as 17.30 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.800
 weekdays on the A1 between Cologne and 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.599
 dortmund namely nothing at all 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.430
 and back and then there was at the end 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:18.930
 but again 2 3 carves behind 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.270
 that then unfocusedness because you even 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.349
 not so much to do 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.540
 So I do not know how 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:25.050
 cut out 23 dangerous lines 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.640
 that is clear 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.080
 I have no big mistake from there 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.489
 That 's why it was easy 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.550
 so again dangerous at the corner to 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:34.769
 example as in bahrain minds though 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.769
 otherwise came up to a shot 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:38.760
 dollar 213 not solo star of manu on 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:40.769
 it was not much on the other side either 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.400
 that's why you have to say absolutely 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:46.860
 just 0 0 today thank you 200 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.569
 manuel new once great succeeded 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.920
 is a grateful or ungrateful at 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.120
 he has hardly anything to do when the land 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.750
 plays and then comes a thing about the 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:57.500
 corner i do not say so in principle 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:01.290
 then grateful that I'll hang in there 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:03.180
 thankful that their defensive something 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.260
 more stable compared to late I like 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.450
 especially the last half hour in 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.680
 to this game 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.000
 how do you rate it as it is ? 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.590
 Do you want to introduce or want something else? 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.330
 improve 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.860
 no you have not seen any two 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.860
 teams wanted to make a mistake 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.660
 we were defensive very well and we 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.220
 Did not want the game in any case 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.140
 No one wanted to lose and nobody wanted 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.459
 team today and therefore maybe 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.290
 also a bit tough but no one 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:26.940
 I wanted to pass the goal and we wanted to 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.830
 just want a positive result 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.360
 Take me here from Amsterdam and me 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.340
 think the 0 0 is fine 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.930
 the 2012 country game until the end 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.280
 it as the last man said I was the 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.900
 Hall always observed from behind 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.120
 what is the most important point you have 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.739
 but take it with you 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.360
 yes that you play the crucial games 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:44.370
 Just win at the 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.120
 European Championship the decisive one 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.340
 we play at the 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:50.000
 World Cup lost to Spain 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.830
 now in the semi-final against Italy 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.060
 lost and I think we are one 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:57.580
 have a little more experience 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:01.420
 easy in 2010 we can do it 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:03.340
 Thank you very much 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.930
 should if you are as natural as you 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.730
 if you are a lively player after 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.349
 wants to play front wants to go fast 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.459
 then it is such a game today horror 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:11.190
 or are they just between a bit 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:14.019
 desperate because so little was going on 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.940
 yes, my first hertha at that time 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:18.130
 Nevertheless, some chances worked out 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:21.519
 a little better in the name 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.230
 played yes I mean the rooms you too 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:24.130
 pretty tight 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:25.270
 still compliment the team 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.220
 that we played thinking to zero 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.930
 I think that was 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.669
 most important ones always emphasize such a thing 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.020
 play against such an opponent that is too 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:33.820
 an important one for those in the 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.290
 one and a half or second row 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.790
 you can prove yourself a little something 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:39.100
 you could prove yourself 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:40.150
 everything in the game is trying 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:43.540
 I think we have one 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:46.270
 new team in front mario not say 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:48.300
 I have my half double-top too 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.229
 I have not given that yet 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.970
 I mean some chances 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:52.440
 worked out a bit of luck 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.300
 Missed front where always bounce off 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:57.000
 when stopped with me one was still 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:59.610
 save post shot omark stand that 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.960
 was neat performance to zero 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.580
 I think we can build and 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.720
 We have to think ahead even further 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.190
 what do you believe in what work 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.240
 Germany would have been going on if there was one 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.620
 Home game for the German team 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.620
 we had never played this way 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.729
 for the dutch I can not 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:15.120
 I also do not want to judge 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:16.349
 i just look at us honestly and 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.699
 I am grateful for that beautiful 

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:20.840
 country game that is very 

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:20.840
 thank you and
