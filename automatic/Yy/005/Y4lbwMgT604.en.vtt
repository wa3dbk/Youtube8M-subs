00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 for export 4 is a lively trade in all eleven victims, think 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.370
 for example, on an extra bed that is the place to be for the battery life of your skin 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:08.199
 extend it 

00:00:08.199 --> 00:00:12.029
 or and and always dock you with speakers to listen to music 

00:00:12.659 --> 00:00:16.499
 now world news namely the turtle bracke and bad month 

00:00:16.499 --> 00:00:19.419
 for the out of 4 

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:20.570
 this thing 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.730
 This makes it possible to connect the lens of a mirror flat camera to your iPhone 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:25.599
 screws 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:29.319
 the idea behind this is that you get me best of two worlds together 

00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:33.200
 brings the quality of a mirror flex camera 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.200
 and there it is easier of the iphone you always have 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.700
 the application is that actually also our country 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.230
 I already have parts in front of me and it is a beer that has a room too 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.230
 put 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.980
 and now take pictures but it goes as it always does because you too 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.260
 the room 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.290
 but if you immediately miss all the problems, that is the image 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.290
 upside down 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.290
 and that actually makes sense because 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.980
 ps piero flats cameras on the mirror and that takes care of 9 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.270
 the butt is good 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.730
 in the search for an SLR camera 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.880
 he replaced the city mirror that you don't see 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.729
 but you can also just take photos like this but 8 far from ideal 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.600
 what this solution is for 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.659
 in the form of apple only then you have to look for it yourself 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:30.680
 because on the manufacturer's website or training I have nothing in return 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:31.660
 can find 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.660
 the two chest that and care 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.080
 well if you are this 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.720
 The most important function that has is that the image now just 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.470
 normally shows on the screen of the iphone 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.460
 so no longer in mirror image 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.160
 what about the quality of the photos 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.660
 well that is to be honest and not too good you really have a lot 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.540
 light needed to be able to take good photos 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.540
 In addition, you must always focus by hand 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.270
 and k and moreover all the options that you have on your spirou flex in terms of 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.209
 settings so set aperture there also it is not going to work 

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:15.559
 conclusion too nice coined by the makers but the photo quality is not too good 

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:18.629
 In addition, science to be convenient to use 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:22.819
 and off because of a quick grab and take snapshots after going here anyway 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:23.969
 no longer work 

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:27.109
 in addition, it is also a fairly expensive construction 

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:30.419
 a total of 60 euros counts out 

00:02:30.419 --> 00:02:33.169
 bring the basket from america here 

00:02:33.169 --> 00:02:36.169
 In addition, you need work and you need a lens 

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:40.139
 all works very well ok 8 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:47.229
 i had with stefan i have the new one living room movies land on me
