 maintenance and storage a 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.970
 caramelization perfectly identical to 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.220
 above and below 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.360
 in comparison with a standard mold 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.890
 here is the difference 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.080

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:32.090
 by mold here are some of these 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.190
 virtuosos of pastry use 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.700
 put the mold on a rack and not on 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.619
 a plate 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.970
 unless it is perforated for a 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:41.090
 better convection of heat 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:43.600
 gressel slightly only before the 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.600
 first use 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.030
 never put in the oven with 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.620
 empty spaces 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.080
 simply add a drop of oil 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:58.140
 in empty alveoli to feed the 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.610
 mold and prevent it from drying out 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.680
 be careful never use the 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.990
 grill resistance because infrared 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:08.760
 could damage the mold and for 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.760
 finish mussels and with ease 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.710
 some molds have the r system 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.000
 patented system of perforations are 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:20.590
 located between the different 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.120
 footprints of the plate for a 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.100
 better circulation of heat and 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.720
 cold for perfect cooking 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.420
 regular and homogeneous throughout the 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.220
 plate and a better course results from 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.620
 the regularity of cooking and the

 caramelization product presentation 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:38.280
