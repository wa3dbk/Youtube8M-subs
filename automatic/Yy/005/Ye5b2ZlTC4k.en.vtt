00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.390
 are 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.090
 the journey sda four days after the us-launch, it is also in Germany 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.890
 arrived 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.130
 in trust 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:52.370
 Look what the box is, there is not much we have seen 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.190
 the iPad those few lines also very sparse not much on it 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:58.640
 just how to get 10 CNY 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.950
 um, of course, Apple sticker here to the super awesome porr of action devens more 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.950
 Power delivered as to that of the iPhone 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.930
 um and here a cable break after a new variant with the square plug 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.890
 that was it also 4 who is not in the box 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.660
 or nothing 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.090
 the intention is SW so here 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.340
 that the decision 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.340
 It seems to me that Ahlen's field is exactly like an iPhone or iPod 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.619
 It is also very boring and it also turns off that was stress 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.390
 Daniel Jensens to AIDS and Sam Cooper remind us how is it 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.390
 Probst 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.170
 then you would have to have logged in just like any other iPhone and iPod 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.210
 Touch owns whatever 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.870
 in order to act then it is necessary to accept the so-called third percent determinations 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.490
 and then percent 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.920
 the taz actually continues as usual not so much exciting percent of 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.340
 Companies Alpina the common scare but then so rarely on 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.270
 also on the expensive products with me which of course related to 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.100
 the iPad makes sense 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.880
 so not now there is already going on it is to be understood then because 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.680
 so far, they have no problem recognizing it 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.230
 Percent financial volume continues here dangling few hooks put everything like 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.709
 used to be fulfilled then should have been on board 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:23.139
 47 

00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:25.839
 and then the device presents itself 

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:28.019
 also not exciting 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:32.019
 Thumbs everything looks so far maybe out of all riders this March 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:35.149
 of course speaking about him a bit different 

00:02:35.149 --> 00:02:39.319
 Under as the only novelty have the upper area are the talking 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:41.999
 in the Middle Ages books 

00:02:41.999 --> 00:02:46.149
 since the east as rs version year will be audiobooks and percent yes «paper 

00:02:46.149 --> 00:02:50.170
 Books can not be said but iPad books treated at the same time and for this 

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:53.169
 with these according to the collision 

00:02:56.189 --> 00:03:00.450
 Commerce to the iPad itself as the EPS out certainly had ten times 

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:03.209
 seen elsewhere and read so I do not want you further 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.019
 stopping her husband through the highlights 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:09.679
 To get around here, the calendar has not been so spectacular as well 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.679
 Problems - the book 

00:03:13.679 --> 00:03:18.230
 beautiful is just the love of detail makes this somali impression 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.400
 for example here a match 1 the front picture through the virtual 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.619
 paper 

00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:27.499
 I think you can not recognize yourself so well if you have to 

00:03:27.499 --> 00:03:31.089
 maybe there is better then incredible attention to detail and the 

00:03:31.089 --> 00:03:32.129
 attempt 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:36.679
 to represent the real world, which is thought through to the goal of the ZTE 

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:40.859
 It had to be fast because new the meadow 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.440
 virtual reality until 10 o'clock as long as percent 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.359
 really 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:48.749
 she followed her finger 

00:03:48.749 --> 00:03:50.379
 done 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:52.169
 it does in any case 

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:56.209
 Tom also very nice here on Safari actually the killer app 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:58.429
 Surfaces on the thing around 

00:03:58.429 --> 00:04:03.529
 how the fans are turned around madness the vacant places do everything around Paulis 

00:04:03.529 --> 00:04:04.599
 That's why 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:07.749
 «Iran's incredibly high resolution sharp 

00:04:07.749 --> 00:04:09.599
 of course, paralyzed 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:11.469
 around 

00:04:11.469 --> 00:04:14.469
 Wolski 

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:24.949
 Chr 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:27.949
 cottbus 

00:04:35.559 --> 00:04:38.559
 KMI 

00:04:57.279 --> 00:04:59.789
 is essential 

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:02.789
 Vienna 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.599
 It is very difficult to explain why the device is so great and why 

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:13.909
 feel so good 

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:17.309
 you have to do it in any case, if you have the opportunity only for a short time 

00:05:17.309 --> 00:05:21.369
 Take time to test and serve, then he understands what this magic 

00:05:21.369 --> 00:05:22.889
 makes 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:25.620
 Infos with him the two most important questions 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:29.059
 Percent for the iPad, in particular, illuminate something different 

00:05:30.999 --> 00:05:33.800
 you need that 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.779
 when do I really have to drive them? 

00:05:36.779 --> 00:05:38.009
 I think 

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:40.210
 both sides 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:43.699
 and does not really need big iPhone 

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:46.699
 for the tasks available 

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:51.259
 but the iPad needs or does not ask you yourself 

00:05:51.809 --> 00:05:55.830
 next question why is it for the market revolutionizing where does that come from 

00:05:55.829 --> 00:05:56.740
 Optics on 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:58.450
 small example that 

00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:59.999
 so far Police 

00:05:59.999 --> 00:06:02.099
 gas at 6 pm 

00:06:02.099 --> 00:06:04.650
 and that should be enough 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:07.810
 who will win this leads out of round 

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:09.500
 because the Roma are not 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:12.500
 completely confused until four o'clock in the morning 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.790
 that was the slightly different view of the iPad I say thank you to the nice 

00:06:20.789 --> 00:06:21.280
 next episode
