00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.680
 hello your puzzle I have joy 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.810
 today a new riddle for you and indeed 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.230
 I'm just standing at the waymark saying 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.250
 clear 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:13.349
 which is in the levels of esport in 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.299
 the clown train is because 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.400
 this area used to be called and 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.529
 of course I have the puzzle clown 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.820
 Continue for you I am already a few 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.949
 run through times 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.570
 the special thing about this riddle is that 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.109
 There are many different paths 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.970
 not all for a goal but yes the one 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.230
 or others just leads my goal me 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.969
 I also do not want to say that I have the 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.050
 but I have the fastest way 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.880
 definitely a goal 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.690
 so if you have a faster then 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.140
 can you it gladly in the 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.300
 post comments 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.739
 all right after a couple of info to the puzzle 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.890
 here 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:49.170
 There are both fall in this puzzle 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.600
 I'm just trying to dodge it as 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.210
 also opponents and you have to be relatively good 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.680
 can jump 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.320
 as if everything was not enough 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.780
 also wiggles in ten seconds a day 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.620
 I claim the whole screen 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.500
 or 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.860
 the wages around it rpg friendly 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.860
 express 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.860
 that does not necessarily do that 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:17.369
 easier but with a bit of practice you can 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:21.630
 so master this riddle easily 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:23.640
 now again such a wobbly sequence here 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.840
 you can get up the stones sometimes 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.900
 see relatively bad 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.040
 but if you know that they are there 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.750
 just help 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:36.900
 The bad guys can not play either 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:38.390
 do more with any more 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.160
 Fire 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.030
 I'm not even on my way there 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.080
 come over 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.520
 it may be that you have another way 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:51.030
 that one at another away 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.369
 but I do not know that 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.460
 here you jump through the waterfall 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:57.990
 can land safely on the other side 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.460
 Well then, there is usually one here 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.960
 Of course, locked truly is now 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.910
 already open because I opened it 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.950
 if you could public yours 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:06.960
 So we do not need that boss 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:11.070
 make sure you leave the best 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:13.459
 to go on here you can here 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.459
 already jump out 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.130
 My goodness 

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:30.200
 no problem 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.879
 so we might have about this 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.370
 but I was able to do it directly 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:36.500
 to'd just be here on then 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:43.670
 opens here by pressing the 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:46.150
 pressure plate opens input is located 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.150
 he does not care now 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:49.840
 well this gang does not open now 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.230
 usually then opens here 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:57.430
 walk through which one can go 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.810
 yes exactly at this point her and then 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.730
 there is also the chest here 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:04.900
 your success and that's it 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.769
 if you have any questions left in it 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.359
 the comments 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:09.129
 Look at the official really 

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:13.980
 I write over the link as usual 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:13.980
 in the description and yes that's it
