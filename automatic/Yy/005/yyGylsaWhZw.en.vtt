which<00:03:15.159> was<00:03:15.400> in<00:03:15.489> my<00:03:15.640> design<00:03:15.969> it<00:03:16.120> so<00:03:16.359> you<00:03:17.319> did

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:17.469

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.410 

does<00:03:23.890> this<00:03:24.010> IC<00:03:24.220> indicate<00:03:24.760> that<00:03:24.790> he<00:03:25.060> is<00:03:25.120> to<00:03:25.300> use

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
does this IC indicate that he is to use

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.120 
does this IC indicate that he is to use
the<00:03:25.540> gait<00:03:25.690> trainer<00:03:25.990> perspective<00:03:26.590> spectrum

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
the gait trainer perspective spectrum

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:28.330 
the gait trainer perspective spectrum
yes

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
yes

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.360 
yes
that<00:03:28.849> format

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
that format

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.440 
that format
and<00:03:30.879> also<00:03:31.030> therapy<00:03:31.420> ball

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.600 

did<00:03:34.840> you<00:03:35.020> use<00:03:35.140> any<00:03:35.379> of<00:03:35.530> those<00:03:35.709> pieces<00:03:36.430> of

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
did you use any of those pieces of

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.460 
did you use any of those pieces of
equipment<00:03:37.000> with<00:03:37.209> respect<00:03:37.569> to<00:03:37.720> this<00:03:37.870> golem

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
equipment with respect to this golem

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.280 
equipment with respect to this golem
benchmark<00:03:38.890> I<00:03:39.569> guess<00:03:40.569> you<00:03:40.780> could<00:03:40.930> say<00:03:41.110> the

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
benchmark I guess you could say the

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.930 
benchmark I guess you could say the
nature<00:03:41.650> and<00:03:41.769> the<00:03:41.830> reason

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
nature and the reason

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.800 
nature and the reason
so<00:03:44.870> one<00:03:45.080> time

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
so one time

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.589 
so one time
did<00:03:47.440> ever<00:03:48.310> stay<00:03:48.640> to<00:03:48.700> you<00:03:48.970> that<00:03:49.150> she<00:03:49.180> would<00:03:49.450> not

00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:49.599 
did ever stay to you that she would not

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:51.750 
did ever stay to you that she would not
put<00:03:49.900> him<00:03:49.989> in<00:03:50.110> the<00:03:50.709> gait<00:03:51.130> trainer<00:03:51.370> because<00:03:51.580> her

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
put him in the gait trainer because her

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.110 
put him in the gait trainer because her
back<00:03:51.940> hurt<00:03:52.150> yes<00:03:53.370> state<00:03:54.370> of<00:03:54.400> Missouri<00:03:54.700> receives

for instance Chandler Scott is entitled

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.620 
for instance Chandler Scott is entitled
to<00:04:04.510> have<00:04:04.690> a<00:04:04.720> one-to-one<00:04:05.200> aid<00:04:05.670> so<00:04:06.670> then<00:04:06.910> he<00:04:07.420> did

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.630 
to have a one-to-one aid so then he did

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:11.830 
to have a one-to-one aid so then he did
not<00:04:07.840> get<00:04:08.140> the<00:04:08.349> 11<00:04:08.860> that<00:04:09.250> that<00:04:09.610> was<00:04:09.819> what<00:04:10.000> I<00:04:10.030> felt

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
not get the 11 that that was what I felt

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.080 
not get the 11 that that was what I felt
but<00:04:12.410> the<00:04:12.709> work<00:04:12.890> sets<00:04:13.160> required<00:04:13.430> so<00:04:13.849> are<00:04:14.060> you

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
but the work sets required so are you

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.900 
but the work sets required so are you
saying<00:04:14.390> he<00:04:14.569> did<00:04:14.750> not<00:04:14.900> receive<00:04:15.440> one-on-one

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.790 

I<00:04:17.970> just<00:04:18.690> as<00:04:18.810> you<00:04:18.930> were<00:04:19.080> tough<00:04:19.320> to<00:04:19.470> find<00:04:19.620> there

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:19.800 
I just as you were tough to find there

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.610 
I just as you were tough to find there
were<00:04:19.890> so<00:04:20.190> many<00:04:20.280> different<00:04:20.580> times<00:04:20.970> when<00:04:21.620> when

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
were so many different times when when

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.020 
were so many different times when when
you<00:04:22.710> were<00:04:22.800> describing<00:04:23.070> things<00:04:23.640> that<00:04:23.940> it

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
you were describing things that it

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.260 
you were describing things that it
seemed<00:04:24.270> like<00:04:24.510> if<00:04:24.750> he<00:04:24.930> had<00:04:25.080> had<00:04:25.380> that<00:04:25.710> aid<00:04:26.040> it<00:04:26.880> is

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
seemed like if he had had that aid it is

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:28.910 
seemed like if he had had that aid it is
dude<00:04:27.450> you're<00:04:27.690> doing<00:04:27.930> the<00:04:28.020> best<00:04:28.050> you<00:04:28.290> can<00:04:28.530> and
