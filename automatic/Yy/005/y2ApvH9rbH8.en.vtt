Hydra soldier right here I believe this
is<00:00:10.590> the<00:00:10.620> non<00:00:10.920> variant<00:00:11.490> the<00:00:12.090> vid<00:00:12.300> the<00:00:13.019> non

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
is the non variant the vid the non

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.560 
is the non variant the vid the non
variant<00:00:13.620> to<00:00:13.740> I<00:00:13.769> have<00:00:14.040> four<00:00:14.250> of<00:00:14.280> these<00:00:14.400> guys<00:00:14.610> the

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
variant to I have four of these guys the

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.740 
variant to I have four of these guys the
only<00:00:16.160> difference<00:00:17.160> between<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:17.970> non<00:00:18.359> burien

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
only difference between the non burien

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.779 
only difference between the non burien
and<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:18.960> variant<00:00:19.320> is<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.890> face<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.430> the

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
and the variant is the face the the

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.460 
and the variant is the face the the
variant<00:00:21.180> makes<00:00:21.359> like<00:00:21.539> kind<00:00:21.779> of<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:21.960> screaming

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
variant makes like kind of a screaming

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.980 
variant makes like kind of a screaming
type<00:00:22.650> of<00:00:22.859> gesture<00:00:23.670> in<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:23.910> face<00:00:24.150> so<00:00:24.810> that's

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
type of gesture in the face so that's

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.720 
type of gesture in the face so that's
the<00:00:25.050> only<00:00:25.140> difference<00:00:25.410> so<00:00:25.890> it's<00:00:26.400> cool<00:00:26.699> that

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
the only difference so it's cool that

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.450 
the only difference so it's cool that
people<00:00:27.359> can<00:00:27.630> army<00:00:27.930> bilbies<00:00:28.349> and<00:00:28.800> have<00:00:29.099> you

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
people can army bilbies and have you

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.429 
people can army bilbies and have you
know<00:00:29.580> at<00:00:30.060> least<00:00:30.150> that<00:00:30.359> settle<00:00:30.869> a<00:00:30.960> difference

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
know at least that settle a difference

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.290 
know at least that settle a difference
in<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:32.250> figures<00:00:32.610> so<00:00:32.759> they're<00:00:32.910> not<00:00:33.000> all

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
in the figures so they're not all

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.410 
in the figures so they're not all
completely<00:00:33.899> alike<00:00:34.320> so<00:00:34.920> that's<00:00:35.070> pretty<00:00:35.280> cool

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.420 
completely alike so that's pretty cool

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.389 
completely alike so that's pretty cool
so<00:00:36.420> i<00:00:36.450> just<00:00:36.780> recently<00:00:37.140> picked<00:00:37.469> up<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:37.739> bunch<00:00:38.280> of

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
so i just recently picked up a bunch of

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.819 
so i just recently picked up a bunch of
these<00:00:38.550> guys<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:39.320> actually<00:00:40.320> looking<00:00:40.559> at<00:00:40.649> the

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
these guys and actually looking at the

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.610 
these guys and actually looking at the
figure<00:00:41.280> as<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.120> standalone<00:00:42.629> figure<00:00:43.110> not<00:00:43.350> in<00:00:43.500> a

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
figure as a standalone figure not in a

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.490 
figure as a standalone figure not in a
group<00:00:43.940> he's<00:00:44.940> not<00:00:45.210> too<00:00:45.629> great<00:00:45.899> a<00:00:45.960> figure<00:00:46.320> now

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
group he's not too great a figure now

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.350 
group he's not too great a figure now
don't<00:00:47.010> get<00:00:47.100> me<00:00:47.190> wrong<00:00:47.250> he's<00:00:47.850> not<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.239> worst

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
don't get me wrong he's not the worst

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.510 
don't get me wrong he's not the worst
figure<00:00:48.809> in<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:48.989> world<00:00:49.020> definitely<00:00:49.649> not<00:00:49.829> but

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
figure in the world definitely not but

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.850 
figure in the world definitely not but
he's<00:00:50.610> not<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.789> best<00:00:51.030> either<00:00:51.320> the<00:00:52.320> reason<00:00:52.649> this

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
he's not the best either the reason this

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.459 
he's not the best either the reason this
figure<00:00:53.280> so<00:00:53.550> cool<00:00:53.940> is<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.660> you<00:00:54.899> know<00:00:55.020> the

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
figure so cool is the you know the

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.260 
figure so cool is the you know the
possibility<00:00:56.160> of<00:00:56.190> army<00:00:56.610> building<00:00:56.910> with<00:00:57.090> them

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
possibility of army building with them

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.510 
possibility of army building with them
when<00:00:57.719> he's<00:00:57.840> in<00:00:57.989> a<00:00:58.079> group<00:00:58.379> with<00:00:58.410> three<00:00:59.129> or<00:00:59.250> four

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
of his you know the same figure if

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.670 
of his you know the same figure if
there's<00:01:02.969> three<00:01:03.180> for<00:01:03.420> these<00:01:03.570> guys<00:01:03.809> look<00:01:04.650> really

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
there's three for these guys look really

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.410 
there's three for these guys look really
cool<00:01:05.250> you<00:01:05.430> can<00:01:05.580> get<00:01:05.700> them<00:01:05.820> in<00:01:05.909> some<00:01:06.060> crazy

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
cool you can get them in some crazy

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.120 
cool you can get them in some crazy
displays<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.260> you<00:01:07.409> can<00:01:07.560> make<00:01:07.680> it<00:01:07.740> look<00:01:07.950> really

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
displays and you can make it look really

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.469 
displays and you can make it look really
cool<00:01:08.600> but<00:01:09.600> by<00:01:10.049> itself<00:01:10.560> it's<00:01:10.920> nothing<00:01:11.729> too<00:01:12.240> much

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
cool but by itself it's nothing too much

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.750 
cool but by itself it's nothing too much
to<00:01:12.689> talk<00:01:12.869> about<00:01:12.930> it's<00:01:13.470> just<00:01:13.799> it's<00:01:14.430> got<00:01:14.580> some

to talk about it's just it's got some

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.550 
to talk about it's just it's got some
really<00:01:14.880> wacky<00:01:15.270> articulation<00:01:16.140> that<00:01:16.290> I've<00:01:16.380> seen

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
really wacky articulation that I've seen

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.380 
really wacky articulation that I've seen
a<00:01:16.590> couple<00:01:16.680> times<00:01:17.250> on<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.549> Hasbro<00:01:17.909> figures<00:01:18.240> but

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
a couple times on the Hasbro figures but

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.170 
a couple times on the Hasbro figures but
overall<00:01:18.780> it's<00:01:19.770> kind<00:01:20.100> of<00:01:20.159> a<00:01:20.310> goofy<00:01:20.670> looking

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
overall it's kind of a goofy looking

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.330 
overall it's kind of a goofy looking
figure<00:01:21.420> if<00:01:21.780> I<00:01:22.259> really<00:01:22.470> get<00:01:22.590> down<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:22.860> it<00:01:23.070> so<00:01:23.280> I'm

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
going to start off he does have two guns

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.640 
going to start off he does have two guns
first<00:01:26.670> one<00:01:26.909> being<00:01:27.090> this<00:01:27.270> pistol<00:01:27.750> actually

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
first one being this pistol actually

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.410

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
in the back we've got the bunches of the

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.710 
in the back we've got the bunches of the
clothing<00:03:31.410> but<00:03:32.220> where<00:03:32.760> the<00:03:32.850> articulation<00:03:33.570> is

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
clothing but where the articulation is

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.720 
clothing but where the articulation is
needed<00:03:34.140> it's<00:03:34.380> not<00:03:34.620> there<00:03:34.920> so<00:03:35.220> it<00:03:35.280> just<00:03:35.430> kind<00:03:35.670> of

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
needed it's not there so it just kind of

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.240 
needed it's not there so it just kind of
makes<00:03:35.910> me<00:03:36.120> not<00:03:36.299> appreciate<00:03:37.170> the<00:03:37.680> sculpting

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
makes me not appreciate the sculpting

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.509 
makes me not appreciate the sculpting
for<00:03:38.519> some<00:03:38.700> reason<00:03:39.030> it's<00:03:39.720> crazy<00:03:39.959> I<00:03:40.170> know<00:03:40.519> but

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
for some reason it's crazy I know but

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:44.210 
for some reason it's crazy I know but
yeah<00:03:42.180> no<00:03:42.360> upward<00:03:42.720> biceps<00:03:43.440> well<00:03:43.680> it's<00:03:43.889> just<00:03:43.950> got

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.120 
yeah no upward biceps well it's just got
this<00:03:44.400> this<00:03:45.290> up-and-down<00:03:46.290> motion<00:03:46.620> right<00:03:46.889> there

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
this this up-and-down motion right there

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.610 
this this up-and-down motion right there
as<00:03:47.250> well

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
as well

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.380 
as well
forward<00:03:48.190> and<00:03:48.220> back<00:03:48.310> kind<00:03:48.730> of<00:03:48.760> on<00:03:48.909> a<00:03:48.940> ratchet

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
forward and back kind of on a ratchet

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.030 
forward and back kind of on a ratchet
joint<00:03:49.720> and<00:03:50.319> it's<00:03:50.470> got<00:03:50.590> this<00:03:50.739> crazy

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
joint and it's got this crazy

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.680 
joint and it's got this crazy
articulation<00:03:51.819> that<00:03:51.909> we've<00:03:52.030> seen<00:03:52.180> in<00:03:52.299> a<00:03:52.360> couple

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
articulation that we've seen in a couple

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.190 
articulation that we've seen in a couple
of<00:03:52.870> the<00:03:53.140> nemesis<00:03:54.010> wave<00:03:54.450> figures<00:03:55.450> it's<00:03:56.049> got

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
of the nemesis wave figures it's got

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.259 
of the nemesis wave figures it's got
this<00:03:56.379> it's<00:03:57.099> like<00:03:57.340> a<00:03:57.370> joint<00:03:57.730> it's<00:03:58.090> like<00:03:58.239> a

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
this it's like a joint it's like a

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:00.750 
this it's like a joint it's like a
two-part<00:03:58.959> joint<00:03:59.319> I<00:03:59.500> guess<00:03:59.739> it's<00:04:00.280> kind<00:04:00.730> of

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
two-part joint I guess it's kind of

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.339 
two-part joint I guess it's kind of
compensating<00:04:01.330> for<00:04:01.569> two<00:04:01.750> joints<00:04:02.200> and<00:04:02.290> they

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:02.349 
compensating for two joints and they

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:03.869 
compensating for two joints and they
just<00:04:02.560> threw<00:04:02.709> it<00:04:02.739> into<00:04:02.920> one<00:04:03.190> which<00:04:03.670> I<00:04:03.790> don't

00:04:03.869 --> 00:04:03.879 
just threw it into one which I don't

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:05.850 
just threw it into one which I don't
like<00:04:04.000> I<00:04:04.450> don't<00:04:04.870> know<00:04:04.959> why<00:04:05.110> I<00:04:05.140> just<00:04:05.620> don't<00:04:05.769> like

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
and down motion which for some reason I

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.130 
and down motion which for some reason I
don't<00:04:11.650> like<00:04:11.950> it's<00:04:12.760> crazy<00:04:13.000> does<00:04:13.659> have<00:04:13.870> hand

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
bother making it a real holster when you

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.140 
bother making it a real holster when you
could<00:05:08.169> easily<00:05:08.440> fit<00:05:08.830> this<00:05:09.039> gun<00:05:09.310> I<00:05:09.610> mean<00:05:10.120> look

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
could easily fit this gun I mean look

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:11.850 
could easily fit this gun I mean look
how<00:05:10.360> big<00:05:10.599> that<00:05:10.660> holster<00:05:11.169> is<00:05:11.320> you<00:05:11.440> can<00:05:11.590> easily

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
how big that holster is you can easily

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.310 
how big that holster is you can easily
fit<00:05:12.430> a<00:05:12.460> gun<00:05:12.789> in<00:05:12.940> that<00:05:13.060> if<00:05:13.599> it<00:05:13.840> was<00:05:13.960> actually

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.320 
fit a gun in that if it was actually

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.650 
fit a gun in that if it was actually
sculpted<00:05:14.830> to<00:05:15.400> do<00:05:15.550> that<00:05:15.760> but<00:05:16.180> instead<00:05:16.479> they

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:16.660 
sculpted to do that but instead they

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:19.350 
sculpted to do that but instead they
took<00:05:16.840> the<00:05:16.990> lazy<00:05:17.199> route<00:05:17.530> and<00:05:18.090> sculpted<00:05:19.090> it<00:05:19.210> on

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 
took the lazy route and sculpted it on

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.260 
took the lazy route and sculpted it on
with<00:05:19.840> the<00:05:19.990> skirt<00:05:20.289> so<00:05:20.650> now<00:05:20.800> it's<00:05:21.190> not<00:05:21.460> able<00:05:21.970> to

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.270 
with the skirt so now it's not able to

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:23.550 
with the skirt so now it's not able to
do<00:05:22.389> any<00:05:22.539> of<00:05:22.660> that<00:05:22.690> stuff<00:05:22.870> and<00:05:23.169> it's<00:05:23.349> Hollow

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 
do any of that stuff and it's Hollow

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.589 
do any of that stuff and it's Hollow
which<00:05:24.370> really<00:05:24.639> pisses<00:05:24.849> me<00:05:24.970> off<00:05:25.860> so<00:05:26.860> that<00:05:26.889> sucks

got the elbow articulation on the
it's<00:06:02.229> this<00:06:02.500> crazy<00:06:02.860> joint<00:06:03.340> that's<00:06:03.520> counting

00:06:03.929 --> 00:06:03.939 
it's this crazy joint that's counting

00:06:03.939 --> 00:06:06.959 
it's this crazy joint that's counting
for<00:06:04.120> two<00:06:04.270> joints<00:06:04.719> I<00:06:05.310> don't<00:06:06.310> like<00:06:06.550> it<00:06:06.789> it<00:06:06.939> just

00:06:06.959 --> 00:06:06.969 
for two joints I don't like it it just

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:09.119 
for two joints I don't like it it just
it<00:06:07.750> hides<00:06:07.990> the<00:06:08.110> articulation<00:06:08.710> i<00:06:08.770> will<00:06:08.949> get

00:06:09.119 --> 00:06:09.129 
it hides the articulation i will get

00:06:09.129 --> 00:06:11.640 
it hides the articulation i will get
heads<00:06:09.430> the<00:06:09.520> articulation<00:06:10.180> well<00:06:10.330> but<00:06:10.960> i<00:06:11.259> don't

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:11.650 
heads the articulation well but i don't

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:12.990 
heads the articulation well but i don't
care<00:06:11.889> about<00:06:11.979> that<00:06:12.129> because<00:06:12.400> these<00:06:12.550> are<00:06:12.699> marvel

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:13.000 
care about that because these are marvel

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.640 
care about that because these are marvel
legends<00:06:13.300> and<00:06:13.479> I've<00:06:13.539> always<00:06:13.689> gotten<00:06:14.199> used<00:06:14.469> to

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:14.650 
legends and I've always gotten used to

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:16.800 
legends and I've always gotten used to
seeing<00:06:15.310> the<00:06:15.460> articulation<00:06:16.150> and<00:06:16.240> knowing<00:06:16.629> it's

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:16.810 
seeing the articulation and knowing it's

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:19.020 
seeing the articulation and knowing it's
there<00:06:16.870> instead<00:06:17.409> of<00:06:17.469> it<00:06:18.099> being<00:06:18.159> like<00:06:18.580> this<00:06:18.789> i

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:19.030 
there instead of it being like this i

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:20.100 
there instead of it being like this i
just<00:06:19.060> don't<00:06:19.479> like<00:06:19.539> this<00:06:19.750> for<00:06:19.900> some<00:06:20.080> reason

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:20.110 
just don't like this for some reason

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:22.230 
just don't like this for some reason
it's<00:06:20.710> got<00:06:20.860> the<00:06:20.979> swivel<00:06:21.189> as<00:06:21.520> well<00:06:22.060> as<00:06:22.150> the

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:22.240 
it's got the swivel as well as the

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.360 
it's got the swivel as well as the
upward<00:06:22.449> and<00:06:22.569> downward<00:06:22.599> motion<00:06:23.169> it's<00:06:24.129> kind<00:06:24.310> of

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:24.370 
upward and downward motion it's kind of

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:26.760 
upward and downward motion it's kind of
weird<00:06:25.050> doesn't<00:06:26.050> look<00:06:26.139> too<00:06:26.199> real<00:06:26.530> from<00:06:26.740> the

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:26.770 
weird doesn't look too real from the

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:30.300 
weird doesn't look too real from the
back<00:06:26.979> see<00:06:27.400> the<00:06:27.520> articulation<00:06:28.090> no<00:06:28.900> I<00:06:29.650> guess

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:30.310 
back see the articulation no I guess

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:31.559 
back see the articulation no I guess
this<00:06:30.490> joint<00:06:30.759> really<00:06:30.969> isn't<00:06:31.180> needed<00:06:31.330> but<00:06:31.509> I

00:06:31.559 --> 00:06:31.569 
this joint really isn't needed but I

00:06:31.569 --> 00:06:34.529 
this joint really isn't needed but I
would<00:06:31.750> like<00:06:31.960> to<00:06:31.990> see<00:06:32.229> it<00:06:32.349> a<00:06:32.789> you<00:06:33.789> know<00:06:33.819> a<00:06:33.939> swivel

00:06:44.259 --> 00:06:47.540 
lots of little details on there no peg
holes<00:06:44.529> of<00:06:44.919> course<00:06:45.569> brute<00:06:46.569> queen<00:06:46.810> series<00:06:47.199> was

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:47.550 
holes of course brute queen series was

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:49.529 
holes of course brute queen series was
definitely<00:06:48.550> one<00:06:48.669> of<00:06:48.699> the<00:06:48.819> worst<00:06:49.000> series<00:06:49.389> as

00:06:49.529 --> 00:06:49.539 
definitely one of the worst series as

00:06:49.539 --> 00:06:51.330 
definitely one of the worst series as
well<00:06:49.779> it<00:06:50.110> was<00:06:50.229> right<00:06:50.439> up<00:06:50.590> there<00:06:50.620> with<00:06:50.830> nemesis

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:51.340 
well it was right up there with nemesis

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:53.610 
well it was right up there with nemesis
so<00:06:51.550> this<00:06:52.479> figure<00:06:52.719> was<00:06:52.840> actually<00:06:53.229> pretty

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:53.620 
so this figure was actually pretty

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:54.809 
so this figure was actually pretty
decent<00:06:53.860> compared<00:06:54.430> to<00:06:54.490> some<00:06:54.639> of<00:06:54.669> the<00:06:54.759> other

00:06:54.809 --> 00:06:54.819 
decent compared to some of the other

00:06:54.819 --> 00:06:59.219 
decent compared to some of the other
figures<00:06:55.240> in<00:06:55.360> that<00:06:55.509> wave<00:06:55.659> cap<00:06:56.909> but<00:06:57.909> um<00:06:58.090> yeah<00:06:59.080> and

00:06:59.219 --> 00:06:59.229 
figures in that wave cap but um yeah and

00:06:59.229 --> 00:07:01.490 
figures in that wave cap but um yeah and
then<00:06:59.349> we<00:06:59.409> go<00:06:59.560> down<00:06:59.590> to<00:07:00.009> the<00:07:00.129> foot<00:07:00.370> which<00:07:00.729> is<00:07:01.090> a

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:01.500 
then we go down to the foot which is a

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:04.469 
then we go down to the foot which is a
does<00:07:02.500> have<00:07:02.680> a<00:07:02.740> pivot<00:07:03.129> which<00:07:03.699> is<00:07:03.849> cool<00:07:04.029> i<00:07:04.240> like

00:07:04.469 --> 00:07:04.479 
does have a pivot which is cool i like

00:07:04.479 --> 00:07:06.719 
does have a pivot which is cool i like
the<00:07:04.659> pivot<00:07:04.930> and<00:07:05.080> then<00:07:05.830> it<00:07:06.069> also<00:07:06.250> has<00:07:06.550> the

00:07:06.719 --> 00:07:06.729 
the pivot and then it also has the

00:07:06.729 --> 00:07:09.119 
the pivot and then it also has the
articulation<00:07:07.330> it<00:07:07.419> goes<00:07:07.569> from<00:07:07.779> back<00:07:08.139> so

00:07:09.119 --> 00:07:09.129 
articulation it goes from back so

00:07:09.129 --> 00:07:12.089 
articulation it goes from back so
overall<00:07:09.520> this<00:07:09.909> figure<00:07:10.389> is<00:07:10.629> it's<00:07:11.529> really<00:07:11.889> cool

00:07:12.089 --> 00:07:12.099 
overall this figure is it's really cool

00:07:12.099 --> 00:07:13.589 
overall this figure is it's really cool
when<00:07:12.310> you<00:07:12.370> have<00:07:12.520> them<00:07:12.610> in<00:07:12.759> an<00:07:12.879> army<00:07:13.240> building

00:07:13.589 --> 00:07:13.599 
when you have them in an army building

00:07:13.599 --> 00:07:16.559 
when you have them in an army building
type<00:07:14.289> of<00:07:14.469> display<00:07:15.370> but<00:07:16.089> when<00:07:16.240> he's<00:07:16.330> by<00:07:16.539> himself

00:07:16.559 --> 00:07:16.569 
type of display but when he's by himself

00:07:16.569 --> 00:07:19.200 
type of display but when he's by himself
if<00:07:17.199> you<00:07:17.319> just<00:07:17.500> only<00:07:17.800> have<00:07:17.949> one<00:07:18.250> he's<00:07:19.000> not

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:19.210 
if you just only have one he's not

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:20.939 
if you just only have one he's not
really<00:07:19.389> too<00:07:19.629> much<00:07:19.659> to<00:07:19.930> talk<00:07:20.080> about<00:07:20.139> but<00:07:20.409> he's

00:07:20.939 --> 00:07:20.949 
really too much to talk about but he's

00:07:20.949 --> 00:07:23.309 
really too much to talk about but he's
definitely<00:07:21.159> not<00:07:21.400> the<00:07:21.580> worst<00:07:21.759> figure<00:07:22.089> so<00:07:22.330> he<00:07:23.199> is

00:07:23.309 --> 00:07:23.319 
definitely not the worst figure so he is

00:07:23.319 --> 00:07:24.869 
definitely not the worst figure so he is
a<00:07:23.349> cool<00:07:23.620> figure<00:07:24.009> and<00:07:24.099> I<00:07:24.159> do<00:07:24.219> recommend<00:07:24.580> getting

00:07:24.869 --> 00:07:24.879 
a cool figure and I do recommend getting

00:07:24.879 --> 00:07:27.059 
a cool figure and I do recommend getting
a<00:07:25.060> bunch<00:07:25.270> of<00:07:25.389> these<00:07:25.479> guys<00:07:25.690> so<00:07:25.960> you<00:07:26.020> can<00:07:26.229> now<00:07:26.409> you

expect anything incredible from this

00:07:31.629 --> 00:07:33.300 
expect anything incredible from this
figure<00:07:31.839> because<00:07:32.259> it's<00:07:32.650> not<00:07:32.770> going<00:07:32.919> to<00:07:33.009> deliver

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:33.310 
figure because it's not going to deliver
