00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
whatnot it really does it it's lacking a

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.540 
whatnot it really does it it's lacking a
bit<00:03:05.180> as<00:03:05.480> you<00:03:05.600> can<00:03:05.750> see<00:03:05.960> it<00:03:06.650> doesn't<00:03:07.280> look<00:03:07.370> the

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:07.550 
bit as you can see it doesn't look the

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.790 
bit as you can see it doesn't look the
best<00:03:07.760> at<00:03:08.000> all<00:03:08.360> you<00:03:08.540> know<00:03:08.660> stuff<00:03:09.140> is<00:03:09.350> sticking

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
best at all you know stuff is sticking

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.830 
best at all you know stuff is sticking
out<00:03:09.920> everywhere<00:03:10.100> I<00:03:10.400> mean<00:03:10.550> this<00:03:10.640> is<00:03:10.700> fish<00:03:11.570> food

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840

but<00:03:12.050> anyway<00:03:12.650> this<00:03:13.340> part<00:03:13.730> I've<00:03:14.660> worked<00:03:15.050> on

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
but anyway this part I've worked on

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.770 
but anyway this part I've worked on
quite<00:03:15.710> a<00:03:15.740> lot<00:03:16.130> you<00:03:16.850> can<00:03:17.000> see<00:03:17.180> I've<00:03:17.300> got<00:03:17.330> a<00:03:17.510> nice

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
quite a lot you can see I've got a nice

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.260 
quite a lot you can see I've got a nice
stereo<00:03:18.350> spread<00:03:18.950> as<00:03:19.250> far<00:03:19.430> as<00:03:19.580> the<00:03:19.640> speakers<00:03:20.090> go

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:20.270 
stereo spread as far as the speakers go

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:22.810 
stereo spread as far as the speakers go
I<00:03:21.170> wouldn't<00:03:21.710> mind<00:03:21.800> them<00:03:22.010> a<00:03:22.070> little<00:03:22.370> bit<00:03:22.640> higher

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
I wouldn't mind them a little bit higher

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.540 
I wouldn't mind them a little bit higher
up<00:03:23.060> if<00:03:23.690> that<00:03:23.900> was<00:03:24.020> possible<00:03:24.230> in<00:03:24.500> any<00:03:24.680> way<00:03:24.920> but

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:25.550 
up if that was possible in any way but

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.110 
up if that was possible in any way but
it<00:03:25.880> isn't<00:03:26.630> really<00:03:26.690> and<00:03:27.550> that's<00:03:28.550> one<00:03:28.850> drawback

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
it isn't really and that's one drawback

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.270 
it isn't really and that's one drawback
to<00:03:29.330> this<00:03:29.540> setup<00:03:29.920> it's<00:03:30.920> always<00:03:31.130> been<00:03:31.250> a

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
to this setup it's always been a

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.650 
to this setup it's always been a
drawback<00:03:31.640> to<00:03:31.700> this<00:03:31.910> set<00:03:32.150> but<00:03:32.330> I've<00:03:32.450> been<00:03:32.540> able

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
drawback to this set but I've been able

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.410 
drawback to this set but I've been able

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
to have them high enough and with when I

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:36.970 
to have them high enough and with when I
had<00:03:35.630> the<00:03:35.660> cabinets<00:03:36.170> on<00:03:36.290> my<00:03:36.410> desk<00:03:36.650> so<00:03:36.800> they<00:03:36.890> were

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
had the cabinets on my desk so they were

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.820 
had the cabinets on my desk so they were
they<00:03:37.280> were<00:03:37.340> too<00:03:37.610> high<00:03:37.850> so<00:03:38.510> you<00:03:39.050> know<00:03:39.170> I'm

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:39.830 
they were too high so you know I'm

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:41.110 
they were too high so you know I'm
pleased<00:03:40.130> with<00:03:40.280> them<00:03:40.460> like<00:03:40.580> this<00:03:40.820> and<00:03:41.000> there's

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
pleased with them like this and there's

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.240 
pleased with them like this and there's
an<00:03:41.180> angle<00:03:41.600> to<00:03:41.690> the<00:03:41.810> speaker<00:03:42.140> so<00:03:42.290> they<00:03:42.410> fire<00:03:42.710> the

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
an angle to the speaker so they fire the

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.280 
an angle to the speaker so they fire the
sound<00:03:43.520> up<00:03:43.820> anyway<00:03:44.360> in<00:03:44.510> general<00:03:44.960> so<00:03:45.110> that's

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
sound up anyway in general so that's

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.550 
sound up anyway in general so that's
that's<00:03:45.860> pretty<00:03:46.310> good<00:03:46.550> and<00:03:47.380> the<00:03:48.380> other

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
that's pretty good and the other

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.350 
that's pretty good and the other
downfall<00:03:49.190> is<00:03:49.430> my<00:03:50.270> eyesight<00:03:50.510> webcam<00:03:52.330> now<00:03:53.330> i

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360

look<00:03:57.860> at<00:03:58.430> this<00:03:58.670> screen<00:03:59.110> and<00:04:00.110> then<00:04:00.290> it's<00:04:00.500> still

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
look at this screen and then it's still

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.350 
look at this screen and then it's still
a<00:04:00.740> little<00:04:00.920> bit<00:04:01.160> side<00:04:01.370> of<00:04:01.520> my<00:04:01.610> head<00:04:01.850> but<00:04:02.090> if<00:04:02.210> I

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.360 
a little bit side of my head but if I

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.600 
a little bit side of my head but if I
you<00:04:02.930> know<00:04:02.960> look<00:04:03.860> at<00:04:04.010> both<00:04:04.130> of<00:04:04.160> the<00:04:04.340> screens

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
you know look at both of the screens
