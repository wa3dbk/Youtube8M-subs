00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:07.240
 Well, let's start, for example 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:11.120
 with some cardiovascular exercises 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:13.100
 to start getting warm and so on 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.320
 For example, we can practice 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.850
 racing in the water is always at 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.650
 slower speed than we would make them out 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.890
 because if not you people not going to 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:24.410
 give time to perform would push them more 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.660
 with the opposite hand to the front well 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:30.910
 closed to drag a lot of 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.910
 water and we suffered the knee up 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:36.320
 now open and close your legs and the 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.560
 once it pushes the water outwards and towards 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.560
 in 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:44.340
 with this exercise we could feel like 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.020
 the pulsations rise and apart it will start 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.370
 to mobilize our arms our train 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:52.920
 higher 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:54.660
 scissors front and back 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.170
 Push the water with the palm of your hand 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:02.140
 in front 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.140
 dragging the water backwards forward 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.659
 very good for example little horses 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:12.319
 raise the knee 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:14.350
 push the back water forward and make 

00:01:12.319 --> 00:01:17.350
 a femoral look at the back foot 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.350
 femoral 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.520
 with the other leg equal 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:35.810
 and kicks to the front always double the 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.760
 nougat and there and then push with the 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.800
 tip upwards to 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.520
 drag more water and feel the work 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.520
 in the quadriceps 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:49.300
 these exercises we could make them 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.580
 alternating those doing less and less 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.470
 repetitions of each exercise and adding 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.600
 at the end all together in one 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.280
 sequence and it would last about five or ten 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.190
 minutes when we see that our 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.680
 students are already motivated activated 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:05.820
 ready to work we would introduce 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.820
 toning exercises
