00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
what just said I'm just try it out when

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:55.760 
what just said I'm just try it out when
you<00:01:54.540> put<00:01:54.659> on<00:01:54.689> recruit<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.200> only<00:01:55.350> level<00:01:55.560> like

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
you put on recruit the only level like

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.770 
you put on recruit the only level like
one<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.130> ten<00:01:56.340> or<00:01:56.520> something<00:01:56.850> regular<00:01:57.540> is<00:01:57.630> like

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
one to ten or something regular is like

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.010 
one to ten or something regular is like
230<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.500> then<00:01:59.100> you<00:01:59.250> know<00:01:59.369> um<00:01:59.729> hardens<00:02:00.630> you

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
230 and then you know um hardens you

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.230 
230 and then you know um hardens you
know<00:02:01.140> going<00:02:01.380> up<00:02:01.619> in<00:02:01.770> every<00:02:01.950> rich<00:02:02.130> so<00:02:02.549> I<00:02:02.850> think

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
know going up in every rich so I think

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.550 
know going up in every rich so I think
that's<00:02:03.540> why<00:02:03.750> you<00:02:03.810> know<00:02:04.110> when<00:02:04.320> you<00:02:04.380> put<00:02:04.530> a
