00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.120
 m 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:22.289
 to make me miami farmer hello 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.000
 welcome to the farm welcome to 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.760
 cocotte tv today I present to you 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.289
 the rs3 2.5 end that recently came back 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.769
 from the dead in quotation marks on 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.120
 the market with a rug the ten30 lurking 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.559
 which takes the name of his former 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.870
 colleague so question of the old 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.480
 funk carpet star we have 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.180
 kept as a reference with his side 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.850
 double its double side forgiveness precision 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.140
 speed its general presentation we 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.239
 we loved him all 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.899
 especially we must certainly liked the 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:54.239
 rigid then 5 so we propose a 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.760
 mouse that is supposed to get married to the 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.350
 perfection with this carpet the mouse 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.420
 would present so in a white box 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.640
 with a single orange and will be the code 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.630
 techno the talking aesthetic codes of 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.880
 the mark some information on the back 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:12.060
 and we went straight to what's 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.889
 frame inside at the bundle level 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.039
 you'll see it's pretty chick 

00:01:13.889 --> 00:01:20.490
 as far as we have a simple 

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:22.679
 endless without a cd of drivers as well as 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.929
 the quick start guide and that's 

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:26.869
 everything we also have the little mouse 

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:30.329
 the funk 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:32.340
 so when we say little mouse 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.439
 it may be an inaccuracy in the 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.090
 extent that it is wide very wide 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.520
 maybe it's even the most 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.229
 wide that I was given to test at 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.770
 level of finish nothing to say 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.179
 fully covered with soft touch 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:49.649
 there is no age burrs that exceeds 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:52.649
 it's quite good the misalignment 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.719
 pardon are quite accurate the 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.219
 cliques are equipped with omron switch 

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:58.770
 everyone is turning to the world in 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:02.279
 this moment so nothing to say 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.919
 the wheel proposes a course with 

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:07.349
 pretty sensitive screen but can mark 

00:02:04.919 --> 00:02:09.179
 in any case it's pretty flexible two 

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:11.939
 little round buttons for the climb and 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.650
 the descent of the dpi a button on the 

00:02:11.939 --> 00:02:16.689
 right click that will allow switcher 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.269
 the profiles on the right side always 

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:21.280
 an impressive economy cuts 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:22.329
 which from a design point of view gives him 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.810
 still a little the look of a paw 

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:25.360
 bear 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.340
 in any case so cuts 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.220
 important ergonomic left side 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.950
 we have two buttons for the thumb one 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.930
 boot will have a bit like a button 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.400
 heinze sniper that will slow down 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.950
 or even accelerate if you 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.650
 want the dpi temporarily in the 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:45.159
 holding pressed on the platform a 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:47.650
 hard enough button my faith that will 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:49.720
 maybe add a feature 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.730
 but it is really hard in all 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.670
 case not below we have four 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.950
 paws a pretty big split at the four 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.940
 mouse corners a sensor no I 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.909
 will resume the features 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:03.129
 techniques right after and a 

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:03.900
 orange and black braided cable of any 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:06.549
 beauty 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.359
 end with a usb gold plated that's it 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:08.680
 classical 

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:11.049
 at the level of characteristics 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.750
 techniques what can I teach you 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:17.409
 I have not already given you 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.970
 the box so we know that the 

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:20.829
 mouse is equipped with switcher one I 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:24.190
 wanted to already said we also 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:27.220
 that she a sensor before taste that gets 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:30.940
 name the subject s 9500 whose 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:33.190
 course from 90 countries to 5670 countries 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.949
 they ship inside a 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.989
 memory chip of 512 kg that she has a lift 

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:39.940
 off adjustable when direct pauline like 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:42.220
 all players adjustable up 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.510
 1000 hertz and that we have done little 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.010
 near the turn since all the others 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.959
 technical characteristics I you the 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.519
 will give in the written test that you 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:50.709
 will have very very soon on
