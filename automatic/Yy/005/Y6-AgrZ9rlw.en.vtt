00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:21.400
 Hello, my name is Katya and today 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:24.369
 I want to show you how to skip 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.900
 almost from starbucks i'm starting 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:27.759
 our fate is very tasty drink and his 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.130
 can be done at home because absolutely 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:32.050
 simple and you can even beg 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:39.129
 him in his own way so what's next he is here 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:41.489
 no stay smart and go so for 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:44.019
 start you will need ordinary blends 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.940
 if you want you can use 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:48.640
 some skills some other 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.500
 and starting with the fact that for their 5 6 cubes 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.129
 under an them usual vanilla 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.870
 ice cream also pour milk keep in mind 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:58.329
 that the amount of milk is about 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.449
 so much you get the most missed 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:02.980
 so what do you know next 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.440
 next i use cocoa powder 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.450
 several years a window can use 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.090
 some more bitter may be from 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.250
 dark chocolate like you want further 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.740
 I take such chocolate spoons big 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.840
 I do have a tiny, tiny cop on 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.750
 okay mug because differently I 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:23.170
 the way is impossible to drink and everything is fine with a knife 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:25.149
 grind ready principle this by 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.550
 optional so if you do not want to have chocolate 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:29.200
 mug of piston is mined just i think 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.229
 starbucks did not like it so much 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:35.910
 decided that why not give them or all 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:35.910
 whip well and ready 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:45.790
 It turned out such a frappuccino if you 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.799
 don't want to use cream about what i'm talking about 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.659
 I'll show you at the end can put 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:52.799
 little pieces of marshmallow so in 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:52.799
 principle, too, will be very tasty 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:10.340
 yes, of course, I understand 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:12.350
 there will be again 6 maybe even 8q there 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.000
 or shaking ordinary use 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.750
 ice cream and already tasteful 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.340
 Creme brulee 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.130
 principle, you can take and caramel 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.590
 coffee is generally only want to 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:24.740

 who bought in the store she's cold i 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.730
 I thought it would be more convenient than the trust 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:31.730
 afraid of mine so use already in 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.710
 dollars and vanilla extract as well 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.530
 it was a little bit sweeter and again our 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:39.370
 favorite chocolate crumb and all 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.370

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.330
 often ask me katya why are you 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.910
 pour all the cans 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:54.100
 well firstly the bank is big comfortable and to 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.620

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.600
 the main thing and so now I will show you how 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.730
 make asleep and from fishing line to get you started 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:04.000
 need the usual cream where thirty 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:06.490
 five percent fat is better not more 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.380
 no less this is about like this and night 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:10.510
 all start beating up neatly 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.400
 smiley on power then increase 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.200
 and when you see that they become 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.930
 empty means they are ready 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.400
 then I take a special culinary 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.950
 syringe basically if you don't have a syringe 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.720
 can use the bag if you don't 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.520
 know how to look on the internet there 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.650
 sure to explain everything to you in detail and 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:29.650
 I fill the syringe and take a special 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:33.840
 cream nozzle and already on top of ours 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.840

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.880

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:51.770
 but to make the color beautiful and 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:54.570
 bright cream i use food colors 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:56.640
 I use red on my mind first 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:58.890
 did not understand that he is too so coral 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.410

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:03.360
