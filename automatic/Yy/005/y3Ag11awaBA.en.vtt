before it does let's take a look at what

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.850 
before it does let's take a look at what
I<00:00:18.849> think<00:00:19.150> most<00:00:19.419> riders<00:00:19.810> would<00:00:20.110> agree<00:00:20.410> is<00:00:20.649> the

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:20.860 
I think most riders would agree is the

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.040 
I think most riders would agree is the
most<00:00:21.040> critical<00:00:21.310> part<00:00:21.520> of<00:00:21.880> any<00:00:22.180> race<00:00:22.480> gotta<00:00:22.899> be

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:23.050 
most critical part of any race gotta be

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.569 
most critical part of any race gotta be
true<00:00:23.230> Larry<00:00:23.500> and<00:00:23.619> that's<00:00:23.770> of<00:00:23.980> course<00:00:24.220> is<00:00:24.399> the

00:00:24.569 --> 00:00:24.579 
true Larry and that's of course is the

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:26.550 
true Larry and that's of course is the
start<00:00:24.910> the<00:00:25.300> guy<00:00:25.450> who's<00:00:25.689> been<00:00:25.810> the<00:00:25.960> master<00:00:26.439> of

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:26.560 
start the guy who's been the master of

the great start this year operating most

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.330 
the great start this year operating most
effectively<00:00:29.020> off<00:00:29.259> that<00:00:29.500> gate<00:00:29.739> is<00:00:29.919> the<00:00:30.220> guy

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:30.340 
effectively off that gate is the guy

effectively off that gate is the guy
they<00:00:30.520> call<00:00:30.550> the<00:00:30.849> doctor<00:00:31.180> doug<00:00:31.540> dubach<00:00:32.100> about

they call the doctor doug dubach about
15<00:00:33.550> seconds<00:00:34.059> into<00:00:34.390> the<00:00:34.570> thirty<00:00:34.780> second<00:00:35.199> card

I'm<00:00:35.590> just<00:00:35.800> really<00:00:36.129> clearing<00:00:36.489> my<00:00:36.609> mind<00:00:36.640> of

00:00:37.049 --> 00:00:37.059 
I'm just really clearing my mind of

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:39.869 
I'm just really clearing my mind of
everything<00:00:37.949> grabbing<00:00:38.949> the<00:00:39.010> bike<00:00:39.219> up<00:00:39.489> just

00:00:39.869 --> 00:00:39.879 
everything grabbing the bike up just

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:42.540 
everything grabbing the bike up just
mentally<00:00:40.660> preparing<00:00:41.170> myself<00:00:41.440> for<00:00:41.980> getting

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550 
mentally preparing myself for getting

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.910 
mentally preparing myself for getting
out<00:00:42.640> of<00:00:42.730> that<00:00:42.910> gate

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:44.920 
out of that gate

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.380 
out of that gate
the<00:00:46.230> 30-second<00:00:47.230> board<00:00:47.260> goes<00:00:47.620> sideways<00:00:47.920> I<00:00:48.519> know

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
the 30-second board goes sideways I know

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.869 
the 30-second board goes sideways I know
I've<00:00:49.690> got<00:00:49.960> at<00:00:50.379> least<00:00:50.559> 5<00:00:50.859> seconds<00:00:51.339> so<00:00:51.429> I<00:00:51.609> just

00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:51.879 
I've got at least 5 seconds so I just

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:55.469 
I've got at least 5 seconds so I just
count<00:00:52.120> it<00:00:52.210> down<00:00:52.390> slowly<00:00:52.780> in<00:00:52.989> my<00:00:53.109> mind<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.820> once

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:55.479 
count it down slowly in my mind and once

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:58.439 
count it down slowly in my mind and once
I<00:00:55.690> get<00:00:55.870> down<00:00:56.079> to<00:00:57.070> when<00:00:57.309> the<00:00:57.489> gate<00:00:57.699> could<00:00:58.089> drop

00:00:58.439 --> 00:00:58.449 
I get down to when the gate could drop

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:01.350 
I get down to when the gate could drop
it's<00:00:58.929> when<00:00:59.170> I<00:00:59.199> really<00:00:59.739> focus<00:01:00.159> i<00:01:00.370> watch<00:01:01.149> the

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:01.360 
it's when I really focus i watch the

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.359 
it's when I really focus i watch the
gate<00:01:01.539> next<00:01:01.899> to<00:01:01.989> me<00:01:02.110> because<00:01:02.409> it's<00:01:02.829> easier<00:01:03.219> to

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:03.369 
gate next to me because it's easier to

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:06.090 
gate next to me because it's easier to
see<00:01:03.579> than<00:01:03.789> my<00:01:03.969> own<00:01:04.119> gate<00:01:04.390> dropping<00:01:04.930> right<00:01:05.890> as

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
see than my own gate dropping right as

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.340 
see than my own gate dropping right as
the<00:01:06.250> gates<00:01:06.460> ready<00:01:06.759> to<00:01:06.909> drop<00:01:07.149> I<00:01:07.479> picture<00:01:08.200> it

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
the gates ready to drop I picture it

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.999 
the gates ready to drop I picture it
dropping<00:01:08.890> so<00:01:09.700> that<00:01:10.270> way<00:01:10.570> I'm<00:01:10.869> ready<00:01:11.259> for<00:01:11.830> when

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:12.009 
dropping so that way I'm ready for when

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:14.039 
dropping so that way I'm ready for when
it<00:01:12.130> actually<00:01:12.340> drops<00:01:12.880> if<00:01:13.240> you're<00:01:13.539> sitting<00:01:13.750> back

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:14.049 
it actually drops if you're sitting back

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:16.919 
it actually drops if you're sitting back
waiting<00:01:14.470> for<00:01:14.759> it<00:01:15.759> to<00:01:15.789> drop<00:01:16.149> then<00:01:16.509> it'll<00:01:16.750> catch

00:01:16.919 --> 00:01:16.929 
waiting for it to drop then it'll catch

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:20.460 
waiting for it to drop then it'll catch
you<00:01:17.140> off<00:01:17.289> guard<00:01:17.940> so<00:01:18.940> as<00:01:19.149> that<00:01:19.420> gates<00:01:19.690> dropping

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470 
you off guard so as that gates dropping

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.029 
you off guard so as that gates dropping
I'm<00:01:20.710> already<00:01:21.069> have<00:01:21.580> pictured<00:01:22.060> it<00:01:22.179> going<00:01:22.210> down

00:01:23.029 --> 00:01:23.039 
I'm already have pictured it going down

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:25.859 
I'm already have pictured it going down
and<00:01:24.039> of<00:01:24.130> course<00:01:24.340> that<00:01:24.549> same<00:01:24.909> procedure<00:01:25.210> Dave

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:25.869 
and of course that same procedure Dave

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:27.870 
and of course that same procedure Dave
is<00:01:26.049> going<00:01:26.229> through<00:01:26.440> the<00:01:26.530> minds<00:01:26.920> of<00:01:27.009> 19<00:01:27.580> other

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
is going through the minds of 19 other

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.609 
is going through the minds of 19 other
riders<00:01:28.479> that<00:01:28.509> are<00:01:28.720> all<00:01:28.780> preparing<00:01:29.289> for<00:01:29.470> that

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619 
riders that are all preparing for that

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:32.340 
riders that are all preparing for that
start<00:01:29.979> in<00:01:30.280> Supercross<00:01:31.030> competition<00:01:31.720> probably

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
start in Supercross competition probably

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.309 
start in Supercross competition probably
more<00:01:32.590> so<00:01:32.890> than<00:01:32.920> any<00:01:33.190> other<00:01:33.429> form<00:01:34.179> of

00:01:34.309 --> 00:01:34.319 
more so than any other form of

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:37.469 
more so than any other form of
motorcycle<00:01:35.319> racing<00:01:35.649> the<00:01:36.039> start<00:01:36.340> is<00:01:36.610> extremely

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479 
motorcycle racing the start is extremely

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:39.210 
motorcycle racing the start is extremely
critical<00:01:37.690> the<00:01:38.140> corners<00:01:38.470> are<00:01:38.590> very<00:01:38.740> very<00:01:38.950> tight

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
critical the corners are very very tight

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.460 
critical the corners are very very tight
passing<00:01:39.880> is<00:01:40.000> difficult<00:01:40.569> so<00:01:40.720> obviously<00:01:41.140> if<00:01:41.350> you

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
passing is difficult so obviously if you

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.590 
passing is difficult so obviously if you
can<00:01:41.649> get<00:01:41.920> the<00:01:42.069> holeshot<00:01:42.250> if<00:01:42.880> you<00:01:43.060> can<00:01:43.240> get<00:01:43.450> that

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
can get the holeshot if you can get that

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.510 
can get the holeshot if you can get that
lead<00:01:43.840> right<00:01:44.049> off<00:01:44.170> the<00:01:44.319> bat<00:01:44.560> you'll<00:01:45.100> have<00:01:45.340> the

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
lead right off the bat you'll have the

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.070 
lead right off the bat you'll have the
opportunity<00:01:46.360> to<00:01:46.420> put<00:01:46.659> a<00:01:46.690> little<00:01:46.899> bit<00:01:46.990> of

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.080 
opportunity to put a little bit of

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.959 
opportunity to put a little bit of
distance<00:01:47.530> between<00:01:47.619> yourself<00:01:47.950> and<00:01:48.250> the<00:01:48.759> guys

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:48.969 
distance between yourself and the guys
