them<00:01:45.360> so<00:01:45.570> in<00:01:45.840> this<00:01:45.960> case<00:01:46.229> we<00:01:46.439> have<00:01:46.649> a<00:01:46.890> tank<00:01:47.159> and

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
them so in this case we have a tank and

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.120 
them so in this case we have a tank and
a<00:01:48.329> medic<00:01:48.600> medic<00:01:49.290> following<00:01:49.829> if<00:01:49.950> you<00:01:50.040> ever

to use it same thing goes with the you

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.149 
to use it same thing goes with the you
know<00:02:01.049> killing<00:02:01.890> skills<00:02:02.430> here<00:02:03.119> you<00:02:03.570> can<00:02:03.979> work<00:02:04.979> it

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
know killing skills here you can work it

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.709 
know killing skills here you can work it
like<00:02:05.430> this<00:02:05.729> we're<00:02:06.180> gonna<00:02:06.299> move<00:02:06.420> a<00:02:06.509> little<00:02:06.630> bit

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
like this we're gonna move a little bit

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.529 
like this we're gonna move a little bit
closer<00:02:07.049> so<00:02:07.350> I<00:02:07.409> can<00:02:07.500> do<00:02:07.740> so<00:02:07.979> there<00:02:08.849> you<00:02:08.970> go<00:02:09.030> now

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
closer so I can do so there you go now

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.400 
closer so I can do so there you go now
you<00:02:09.569> have<00:02:09.929> this

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:13.990 

there<00:02:12.860> you<00:02:13.010> go<00:02:13.160> and<00:02:13.310> as<00:02:13.430> you<00:02:13.580> can<00:02:13.700> tell<00:02:13.730> it's

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:47.210 
of area to get some in there so that

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:49.000 
of area to get some in there so that
your<00:02:47.450> completed<00:02:47.990> that<00:02:48.200> mission<00:02:48.230> now<00:02:48.890> this

through the different MC ER again same

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:54.550 
through the different MC ER again same
thing<00:02:53.390> different<00:02:53.570> objectives<00:02:54.170> you<00:02:54.410> have

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
thing different objectives you have

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.430 
thing different objectives you have
different<00:02:55.390> you<00:02:56.390> know<00:02:56.480> this<00:02:56.570> one<00:02:57.260> for<00:02:57.410> instance

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
different you know this one for instance

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.130 
different you know this one for instance
is<00:02:57.770> all<00:02:58.130> about<00:02:58.700> Stealth<00:02:59.210> so<00:02:59.480> you<00:02:59.540> only<00:02:59.840> one

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
is all about Stealth so you only one

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:07.840 
is all about Stealth so you only one
you're<00:03:00.260> using<00:03:00.440> here<00:03:01.010> is<00:03:01.700> your<00:03:02.650> del<00:03:03.650> c<00:03:06.520> spy<00:03:07.520> so

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
you're using here is your del c spy so

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:09.670 
you're using here is your del c spy so
really<00:03:08.030> cool<00:03:08.300> I<00:03:08.570> think<00:03:08.960> the<00:03:09.020> game<00:03:09.170> mechanics

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
really cool I think the game mechanics

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.860 
really cool I think the game mechanics
are<00:03:09.830> really<00:03:10.070> easy<00:03:10.280> and<00:03:10.760> that<00:03:10.820> the<00:03:11.210> concepts

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
are really easy and that the concepts

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.480 
are really easy and that the concepts
kind<00:03:12.110> of<00:03:12.200> cool<00:03:12.410> and<00:03:12.620> that's<00:03:12.800> really
