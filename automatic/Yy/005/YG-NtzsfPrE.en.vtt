the<00:01:02.879> point<00:01:03.390> of<00:01:03.480> me<00:01:03.600> talking<00:01:03.899> about<00:01:04.080> this<00:01:04.409> is<00:01:04.619> it

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
the point of me talking about this is it

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.330 
the point of me talking about this is it
seems<00:01:05.250> like<00:01:05.610> whenever<00:01:06.330> Nike<00:01:06.840> comes<00:01:07.049> together

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
seems like whenever Nike comes together

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.450 
seems like whenever Nike comes together
with<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.580> person<00:01:09.180> or<00:01:09.630> with<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:09.869> boutique<00:01:10.439> or<00:01:10.740> with

with a person or with a boutique or with
a<00:01:11.490> company<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.990> end<00:01:13.200> result<00:01:13.560> tends<00:01:13.860> to<00:01:14.070> be

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
a company the end result tends to be
