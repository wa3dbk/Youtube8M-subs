Cabela's you can only pick it up a dick
quantum<00:04:00.910> makes<00:04:01.120> it<00:04:01.240> exclusively<00:04:01.840> for<00:04:02.170> dick

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
quantum makes it exclusively for dick

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.500 
quantum makes it exclusively for dick
it's<00:04:03.010> the<00:04:03.250> same<00:04:03.520> basically<00:04:04.000> the<00:04:04.090> same<00:04:04.270> thing

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
it's the same basically the same thing

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:05.880 
it's the same basically the same thing
as<00:04:04.600> the<00:04:04.780> quantum<00:04:05.170> Triax

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 
as the quantum Triax

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.720 
as the quantum Triax
but<00:04:06.959> you<00:04:07.959> know<00:04:08.110> six<00:04:08.620> ball<00:04:08.800> bangs<00:04:09.070> pretty<00:04:09.610> good

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
but you know six ball bangs pretty good

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.650 
but you know six ball bangs pretty good
real<00:04:09.970> that<00:04:10.600> in<00:04:10.720> a<00:04:10.810> size<00:04:11.020> 30<00:04:11.400> overall<00:04:12.400> great<00:04:13.360> and

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
real that in a size 30 overall great and

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.860 
real that in a size 30 overall great and
it's<00:04:14.230> a<00:04:14.350> quantum<00:04:14.800> octane<00:04:15.640> size<00:04:16.150> 30<00:04:16.450> thanks

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
it's a quantum octane size 30 thanks

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.049 
it's a quantum octane size 30 thanks
guys
