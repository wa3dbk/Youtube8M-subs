doing so that somebody else will be able
to<00:00:25.390> do<00:00:25.509> it<00:00:25.630> probably<00:00:25.869> in<00:00:26.169> less<00:00:26.349> time<00:00:26.560> than<00:00:26.619> I'm

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:26.860 
to do it probably in less time than I'm

doing so let's go I'm gonna go on this

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:31.499 
doing so let's go I'm gonna go on this
and<00:00:30.700> you<00:00:30.759> know<00:00:30.849> what<00:00:30.910> it<00:00:31.060> took<00:00:31.180> me<00:00:31.329> a<00:00:31.360> while<00:00:31.450> to

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:31.509 
and you know what it took me a while to

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:32.729 
and you know what it took me a while to
figure<00:00:31.720> this<00:00:31.989> clip<00:00:32.320> out

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:32.739 
figure this clip out

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:34.319 
figure this clip out
I've<00:00:32.800> been<00:00:33.309> yanking<00:00:33.760> on<00:00:33.910> it<00:00:34.030> and<00:00:34.149> stuff<00:00:34.300> and

00:00:34.319 --> 00:00:34.329 
I've been yanking on it and stuff and

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:35.610 
I've been yanking on it and stuff and
then<00:00:34.480> I<00:00:34.510> realize<00:00:34.899> these<00:00:35.079> are<00:00:35.140> actually<00:00:35.500> quite

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:35.620 
then I realize these are actually quite

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.819 
then I realize these are actually quite
interesting<00:00:36.219> it's<00:00:36.640> the<00:00:36.880> very<00:00:37.090> top<00:00:37.570> that<00:00:38.410> we

00:00:38.819 --> 00:00:38.829 
interesting it's the very top that we

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:40.440 
interesting it's the very top that we
goes<00:00:39.010> lose<00:00:39.250> him<00:00:39.550> there<00:00:40.030> you<00:00:40.059> go<00:00:40.210> it<00:00:40.300> took<00:00:40.420> a

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:40.450 
goes lose him there you go it took a

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:41.819 
goes lose him there you go it took a
little<00:00:40.630> bit<00:00:40.750> of<00:00:40.899> pulling<00:00:41.110> but<00:00:41.290> basically<00:00:41.739> that

00:00:41.819 --> 00:00:41.829 
little bit of pulling but basically that

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:45.680 
little bit of pulling but basically that
pops<00:00:42.280> up<00:00:42.460> and<00:00:43.120> then<00:00:43.239> the<00:00:43.360> clip<00:00:43.600> comes<00:00:43.899> out<00:00:44.340> so

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
pops up and then the clip comes out so

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.180 
pops up and then the clip comes out so
very<00:00:46.690> easy<00:00:47.559> to<00:00:47.980> operate<00:00:48.160> once<00:00:48.789> you<00:00:49.570> know<00:00:49.719> how

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
very easy to operate once you know how

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.130 
very easy to operate once you know how
but<00:00:51.190> I<00:00:51.550> can<00:00:51.910> see<00:00:52.120> I<00:00:52.149> broke<00:00:52.510> who<00:00:52.719> are<00:00:52.809> you<00:00:52.899> trying

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.140 
but I can see I broke who are you trying

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.619 
but I can see I broke who are you trying
to<00:00:53.170> figure<00:00:53.499> it<00:00:53.620> out<00:00:53.710> so<00:00:54.070> that's<00:00:54.879> this<00:00:55.149> clip<00:00:55.449> so

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:55.629 
to figure it out so that's this clip so

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:57.169 
to figure it out so that's this clip so
once<00:00:55.809> I<00:00:55.960> have<00:00:56.199> this<00:00:56.379> I<00:00:56.559> should<00:00:56.739> be<00:00:56.890> able<00:00:57.070> to

00:00:57.169 --> 00:00:57.179 
once I have this I should be able to

00:00:57.179 --> 00:00:59.910 
once I have this I should be able to
snap<00:00:58.179> this<00:00:58.449> out<00:00:58.690> this<00:00:58.989> top<00:00:59.350> you<00:00:59.559> should<00:00:59.589> just

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
snap this out this top you should just

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.579 
snap this out this top you should just
snap<00:01:00.159> out<00:01:00.370> of<00:01:00.460> place<00:01:00.699> too<00:01:01.030> so<00:01:01.809> I've<00:01:02.140> got<00:01:02.440> the

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:02.589 
snap out of place too so I've got the

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:05.790 
snap out of place too so I've got the
clip<00:01:02.980> in<00:01:03.129> the<00:01:03.219> back<00:01:03.370> to<00:01:03.579> do<00:01:03.699> now<00:01:03.850> I<00:01:04.440> use<00:01:05.440> sort<00:01:05.770> of

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:05.800 
clip in the back to do now I use sort of

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.050 
clip in the back to do now I use sort of
same<00:01:05.980> thing<00:01:06.159> they<00:01:06.310> use<00:01:06.430> the<00:01:06.550> screwdriver<00:01:06.820> to

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
same thing they use the screwdriver to

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.610 
same thing they use the screwdriver to
pry<00:01:07.360> it<00:01:07.420> apart<00:01:07.540> so<00:01:07.900> I'm<00:01:07.960> gonna<00:01:08.050> pull<00:01:08.260> it<00:01:08.440> and

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:08.620 
pry it apart so I'm gonna pull it and

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:18.180 
pry it apart so I'm gonna pull it and
out<00:01:09.340> it'll<00:01:09.550> come<00:01:13.050> to<00:01:14.050> get<00:01:14.229> at<00:01:14.380> it<00:01:16.020> this<00:01:17.190> these

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.190 
out it'll come to get at it this these

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:19.469 
out it'll come to get at it this these
clips<00:01:18.550> here<00:01:18.670> I<00:01:18.820> gotta<00:01:19.030> make<00:01:19.180> sure<00:01:19.329> they're

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479 
clips here I gotta make sure they're

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:21.990 
clips here I gotta make sure they're
nice<00:01:19.600> and<00:01:19.659> straight<00:01:20.079> again<00:01:20.340> so<00:01:21.340> I<00:01:21.369> should<00:01:21.820> have

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
nice and straight again so I should have

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.959 
nice and straight again so I should have
enough<00:01:22.240> to<00:01:22.390> get<00:01:22.540> at<00:01:22.630> the<00:01:22.750> sunshade<00:01:23.229> now<00:01:23.969> I've

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:24.969 
enough to get at the sunshade now I've

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:29.819 
enough to get at the sunshade now I've
noticed<00:01:25.360> that<00:01:25.570> here<00:01:26.579> I've<00:01:27.579> broken<00:01:28.380> two<00:01:29.380> clips

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:29.829 
noticed that here I've broken two clips

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:31.380 
noticed that here I've broken two clips
here<00:01:30.219> so<00:01:30.399> I'm<00:01:30.460> gonna<00:01:30.549> Burtt<00:01:30.789> I'm<00:01:31.060> gonna<00:01:31.240> glue

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
here so I'm gonna Burtt I'm gonna glue

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.149 
here so I'm gonna Burtt I'm gonna glue
those<00:01:31.719> pull<00:01:32.619> them<00:01:32.799> off<00:01:34.680> so<00:01:35.680> it<00:01:35.740> looks<00:01:35.890> like<00:01:35.979> I

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 
those pull them off so it looks like I

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:38.700 
those pull them off so it looks like I
need<00:01:36.189> a<00:01:36.399> screwdriver<00:01:37.149> here<00:01:37.689> pry<00:01:38.320> on<00:01:38.500> the<00:01:38.590> other

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
need a screwdriver here pry on the other

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.319 
need a screwdriver here pry on the other
end<00:01:38.920> so<00:01:39.159> with<00:01:39.310> a<00:01:39.340> stub<00:01:39.670> you<00:01:39.880> should<00:01:40.060> be<00:01:40.149> able<00:01:40.210> to

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:40.329 
end so with a stub you should be able to

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:43.260 
end so with a stub you should be able to
get<00:01:40.479> in<00:01:40.600> there<00:01:40.750> okay<00:01:41.729> with<00:01:42.729> that<00:01:42.880> I<00:01:42.939> know<00:01:43.090> of

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
get in there okay with that I know of

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.740
