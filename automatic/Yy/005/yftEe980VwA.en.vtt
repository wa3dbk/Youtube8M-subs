00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:32.609 
middle let's get started I'm gonna start
by<00:00:29.440> going<00:00:29.680> out<00:00:30.550> from<00:00:30.910> the<00:00:31.060> inside<00:00:31.630> doesn't

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:32.619 
by going out from the inside doesn't

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:34.849 
by going out from the inside doesn't
matter<00:00:32.800> which<00:00:33.010> side<00:00:33.039> you<00:00:33.280> start<00:00:33.609> on<00:00:33.819> here<00:00:34.149> here

00:00:34.849 --> 00:00:34.859 
matter which side you start on here here

00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:38.340 
matter which side you start on here here
as<00:00:35.859> long<00:00:36.039> as<00:00:36.159> you<00:00:36.280> go<00:00:36.429> diagonally<00:00:37.149> across<00:00:37.350> into

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350 
as long as you go diagonally across into

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:44.790 
as long as you go diagonally across into
the<00:00:38.379> very<00:00:38.589> top<00:00:38.889> eyelet<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:44.050> then<00:00:44.559> when<00:00:44.710> you

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:44.800 
the very top eyelet and then when you

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:52.889 
the very top eyelet and then when you
even<00:00:45.129> these<00:00:45.280> up<00:00:48.839> you<00:00:49.839> want<00:00:50.079> to<00:00:50.170> pull<00:00:50.859> more<00:00:51.899> of

00:00:52.889 --> 00:00:52.899 
even these up you want to pull more of

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:58.110 
even these up you want to pull more of
the<00:00:54.690> top<00:00:55.690> eyelet<00:00:56.319> so<00:00:56.649> that<00:00:56.920> the<00:00:57.579> strings<00:00:57.909> are

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120 
the top eyelet so that the strings are

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.149 
the top eyelet so that the strings are
about<00:00:58.359> that<00:00:58.600> much<00:00:58.780> different<00:00:59.319> when<00:00:59.829> you<00:00:59.949> pull

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:00.159 
about that much different when you pull

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:02.669 
about that much different when you pull
them<00:01:00.280> tight<00:01:00.749> so<00:01:01.749> the<00:01:01.899> bottom<00:01:02.170> string<00:01:02.440> has

00:01:02.669 --> 00:01:02.679 
them tight so the bottom string has

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:09.510 
them tight so the bottom string has
significantly<00:01:03.489> less<00:01:03.609> slack<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.920> then<00:01:09.310> you're

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
significantly less slack and then you're

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.300 
significantly less slack and then you're
gonna<00:01:09.640> start<00:01:10.030> at<00:01:10.150> the<00:01:10.180> top<00:01:10.420> and<00:01:10.750> go<00:01:11.440> straight

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
gonna start at the top and go straight

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.630 
gonna start at the top and go straight
across<00:01:12.430> and<00:01:12.940> down<00:01:13.870> from<00:01:14.680> the<00:01:14.800> outside<00:01:15.250> through

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
across and down from the outside through

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:22.320 
across and down from the outside through
the<00:01:15.730> eyelet<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:19.930> then<00:01:20.770> go<00:01:21.100> diagonally<00:01:21.460> to<00:01:22.210> the

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.330 
the eyelet and then go diagonally to the

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.630 
the eyelet and then go diagonally to the
number<00:01:22.630> two<00:01:23.250> up<00:01:24.250> from<00:01:24.700> the<00:01:24.790> inside<00:01:26.190> and<00:01:27.190> then

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
number two up from the inside and then

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:45.149 
number two up from the inside and then
just<00:01:27.880> repeat<00:01:28.090> that

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:45.159 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:59.130 

and<00:01:45.729> one<00:01:46.329> more<00:01:46.540> time

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.910 

and<00:02:00.140> then<00:02:00.620> start<00:02:00.980> from<00:02:01.160> the<00:02:01.280> bottom<00:02:02.620> go<00:02:03.620> down

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
and then start from the bottom go down

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.270 
and then start from the bottom go down
and<00:02:04.220> through<00:02:04.460> and<00:02:05.290> in<00:02:06.290> diagonally<00:02:06.950> it's<00:02:07.130> the

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
and through and in diagonally it's the

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.220 
and through and in diagonally it's the
same<00:02:07.520> thing<00:02:07.850> just<00:02:08.270> head<00:02:08.930> in<00:02:09.020> the<00:02:09.110> other

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:09.230 
same thing just head in the other

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:20.320 
same thing just head in the other
direction

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.590 

and<00:02:20.780> then<00:02:21.650> you<00:02:22.280> can<00:02:22.430> see<00:02:22.700> even<00:02:23.240> though<00:02:23.480> they

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
and then you can see even though they

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.030 
and then you can see even though they
start<00:02:23.870> out<00:02:24.020> way<00:02:24.230> different<00:02:24.680> they<00:02:24.770> end<00:02:24.920> up

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
start out way different they end up

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.610 
start out way different they end up
pretty<00:02:25.310> close<00:02:25.490> to<00:02:25.790> the<00:02:25.880> same<00:02:26.150> you<00:02:27.080> can<00:02:27.110> do<00:02:27.410> some

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
pretty close to the same you can do some

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.820 
pretty close to the same you can do some
trial<00:02:27.890> and<00:02:28.040> error<00:02:28.220> to<00:02:28.720> get<00:02:29.720> it<00:02:29.870> exactly<00:02:30.530> the

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
trial and error to get it exactly the

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.310 
trial and error to get it exactly the
way<00:02:30.860> you<00:02:31.010> want<00:02:31.340> it<00:02:31.460> and<00:02:31.810> then<00:02:32.810> you<00:02:32.960> can<00:02:33.140> tie
