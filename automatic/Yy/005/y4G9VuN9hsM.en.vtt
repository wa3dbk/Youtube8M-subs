your<00:01:25.650> animal<00:01:26.330> this<00:01:27.330> game<00:01:27.509> allows<00:01:27.780> you<00:01:27.930> to<00:01:27.990> do

trail or anything else that might be

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.319 
trail or anything else that might be
useful<00:01:35.840> so<00:01:36.840> you<00:01:37.320> can<00:01:37.560> use<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.040> dinosaur<00:01:38.850> luring

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
useful so you can use a dinosaur luring

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.399 
useful so you can use a dinosaur luring
call<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:40.409> call<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.100> Beast<00:01:41.310> of<00:01:41.490> your<00:01:41.640> choice

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
call to call the Beast of your choice

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:45.800 
call to call the Beast of your choice
this<00:01:43.409> works<00:01:44.100> sometimes<00:01:44.640> another<00:01:45.149> time<00:01:45.479> that's

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
this works sometimes another time that's

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.410 
this works sometimes another time that's
not<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.320> best<00:01:46.470> idea<00:01:47.090> with<00:01:48.439> velociraptors

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
not the best idea with velociraptors

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.670 
not the best idea with velociraptors
using<00:01:51.420> their<00:01:51.570> call<00:01:51.810> usually<00:01:52.290> kills<00:01:52.530> you

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
using their call usually kills you

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.859 
using their call usually kills you
quicker<00:01:52.979> which<00:01:53.579> makes<00:01:53.880> them<00:01:54.119> by<00:01:54.390> far<00:01:54.689> the

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
quicker which makes them by far the

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.940 
quicker which makes them by far the
hardest<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:56.070> find<00:01:56.340> to<00:01:56.700> hunt<00:01:56.969> in<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.149> game<00:01:57.950> for

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
hardest to find to hunt in the game for

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.190 
hardest to find to hunt in the game for
this<00:01:59.070> reason<00:01:59.310> I'm<00:02:00.000> using<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.509> radar<00:02:00.899> right

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
this reason I'm using the radar right

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.740 
this reason I'm using the radar right
now<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:02.070> radar<00:02:02.490> will<00:02:02.850> be<00:02:03.180> increase<00:02:03.600> the

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
now the radar will be increase the

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:04.819 
now the radar will be increase the
number<00:02:03.990> of<00:02:04.020> points<00:02:04.170> i<00:02:04.380> get<00:02:04.530> for<00:02:04.710> each

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
number of points i get for each

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.880 
number of points i get for each
velociraptor<00:02:05.640> kill<00:02:05.909> but<00:02:06.659> it<00:02:07.380> increases<00:02:07.740> my

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
velociraptor kill but it increases my

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.190 
velociraptor kill but it increases my
likelihood<00:02:08.550> of<00:02:08.670> finding<00:02:08.849> one<00:02:09.239> in<00:02:09.450> time<00:02:10.020> to

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
likelihood of finding one in time to

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.650 
likelihood of finding one in time to
make<00:02:10.349> this<00:02:10.470> review<00:02:10.860> as<00:02:11.190> i<00:02:12.090> walk<00:02:12.300> around
