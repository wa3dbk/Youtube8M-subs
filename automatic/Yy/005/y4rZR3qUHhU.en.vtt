 Y 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.270
 It's hard to see that you've already left that in your 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.490
 Heart beats will no longer sound for 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.830

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.390
 I sigh in every place I feel with me 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.669
 Although you are not there anymore, I do not forget that 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.250
 for me you were cousin's nephew son and 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.900
 exemplary friend I curse this damn life 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.489
 the cursed luck to which the day in which 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.559
 I did not see you again that God wanted 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.600
 take you up without thinking about all 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.670
 that today we mourn your death is that I do not 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.620
 I accept I can not stand the pain that 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.960
 I have to kill me if you do not 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.390
 you hurt nobody did not deserve to have 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.579
 that tragic ending misses me a lot 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.530
 you do not know how much to return the emptiness that 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.719
 now up to your room so many things for 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.329
 live that were half-baked with just 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.309
 28 years ago you do not like to see us so 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.320
 sad maybe you dislike my anger the 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.420
 destiny to which I look with sorrow and courage 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.160
 while he laughs in my face with so much 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.860
 cynicism say that you are in a place 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.259
 better they say that there is no pain 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:17.119
 that all this to deer fear and grief 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:17.119
 evil or that I want to believe 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:29.850
 or so I want to believe 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:33.659
 wherever you are 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:37.220

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.220

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.730
