00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
and connect it with the roof moving on

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.919 
and connect it with the roof moving on
to<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.860> torso<00:01:47.869> flip<00:01:48.869> down<00:01:49.140> both<00:01:49.800> seats<00:01:50.250> and

split it in half make sure the steering

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.249 
split it in half make sure the steering
wheel<00:01:54.659> is<00:01:54.899> completely<00:01:55.440> up<00:01:56.780> so<00:01:57.780> that<00:01:57.990> you<00:01:58.080> can

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
wheel is completely up so that you can

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.730 
wheel is completely up so that you can
flip<00:01:58.530> up<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.979> torso<00:01:59.280> halves<00:02:00.110> to<00:02:01.110> form<00:02:01.440> the

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
flip up the torso halves to form the

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:09.510 
flip up the torso halves to form the
middle<00:02:01.890> of<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.250> car

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.190 

split<00:02:10.390> the<00:02:10.570> skeletal<00:02:11.140> bit<00:02:11.350> here<00:02:11.680> and<00:02:13.200> flippy

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
split the skeletal bit here and flippy

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:20.430 
split the skeletal bit here and flippy
chaff<00:02:14.500> away<00:02:16.770> finally<00:02:18.390> flip<00:02:19.390> up<00:02:19.600> the<00:02:19.900> rear<00:02:20.110> car

then rotate the doors and there we are I

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:48.699 
then rotate the doors and there we are I
