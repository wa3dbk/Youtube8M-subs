00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.540 
I really like that about this on the
color<00:00:52.870> so<00:00:53.350> a<00:00:53.380> few<00:00:53.650> minutes<00:00:54.040> after<00:00:54.370> application

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:54.550 
color so a few minutes after application

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.260 
color so a few minutes after application
it<00:00:55.180> would<00:00:55.330> feel<00:00:55.690> very<00:00:55.750> like<00:00:56.530> um<00:00:56.850> very<00:00:57.850> sticky

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:58.270

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
straw and then I ate a little snack I

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.800 
straw and then I ate a little snack I
smacked<00:01:49.440> my<00:01:49.590> lips<00:01:49.920> a<00:01:50.130> lot<00:01:50.310> and<00:01:50.580> I<00:01:51.210> noticed<00:01:51.630> that

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
smacked my lips a lot and I noticed that

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.750 
smacked my lips a lot and I noticed that
I<00:01:51.960> had<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.350> reapply<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.830> color<00:01:53.130> on<00:01:53.400> the<00:01:53.580> center

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:53.760 
I had to reapply the color on the center

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.890 
I had to reapply the color on the center
lips<00:01:54.240> or<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.260> center<00:01:56.220> rim<00:01:56.520> if<00:01:57.240> that<00:01:57.570> even

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:57.900 
lips or the center rim if that even

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.510 
lips or the center rim if that even
makes<00:01:57.930> sense<00:01:58.200> so<00:01:58.530> I<00:01:58.680> had<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.070> apply<00:01:59.280> because

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
makes sense so I had to apply because

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.580 
makes sense so I had to apply because
the<00:01:59.700> inner<00:01:59.850> part<00:02:00.180> of<00:02:00.330> my<00:02:00.390> lips<00:02:00.540> were<00:02:00.930> like<00:02:00.960> the

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
the inner part of my lips were like the

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.380 
the inner part of my lips were like the
color<00:02:01.800> was<00:02:02.040> like<00:02:02.220> running<00:02:02.580> out<00:02:02.730> already<00:02:02.940> so<00:02:03.210> I

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
color was like running out already so I

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.310 
color was like running out already so I
had<00:02:03.720> to<00:02:03.840> reapply

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
had to reapply

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.760 
had to reapply
so<00:02:04.860> I<00:02:04.890> touched<00:02:05.760> a<00:02:06.090> total<00:02:06.750> of<00:02:06.870> two<00:02:07.050> times<00:02:07.080> I

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
so I touched a total of two times I

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.380 
so I touched a total of two times I
really<00:02:08.280> like<00:02:08.460> this<00:02:08.610> shade<00:02:08.820> which<00:02:09.000> is<00:02:09.030> number

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
really like this shade which is number

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.300 
really like this shade which is number
95<00:02:09.840> in<00:02:10.229> finale

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
95 in finale

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.530 
95 in finale
I'd<00:02:11.370> be<00:02:11.550> like<00:02:11.700> it<00:02:11.820> because<00:02:12.060> it's<00:02:12.209> just<00:02:12.360> a

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540
