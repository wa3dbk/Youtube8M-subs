00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:10.440
 in today's video I would think you 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.000
 top apps of the month of november show the 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.679
 I had a class of h months 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.020
 is introduced and is unfortunately in the last 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.830
 months let something grind or gave 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.500
 not anymore 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.270
 but now I want it back again again 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.060
 or introduce fresh again 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.980
 I have three apps or actually two 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.980
 selected apps and a website 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.260
 Let's go to the db navigator 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.149
 recently also an adaptation to the iphone 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.030
 5 get to the longer speak 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.350
 So screen is also for iphone 5 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.690
 Customer class to use 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.550
 what can the db navigator do for what 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.410
 I think of the poor conditions of 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.190
 the german railway and for people the 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.690
 movies train bus and train driving is the app 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.640
 really very convenient we have here 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.399
 below have a menu bar at the far left 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.140
 our favorites where we are ours 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.399
 We can save connections 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.230
 use more often 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.000
 fitness here with me, for example 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.920
 you go straight to a connection 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.199
 tap and thus always on the current 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.229
 time searched when the next train 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.030
 because each route would drive 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:10.950
 left always with the departure and with 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.930
 which train and custody the arrival to 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.909
 what time the green number in this 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.700
 falling behind now displays should the train 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.470
 have a delay as much as 15 minutes 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.210
 the time is red then that is 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.680
 whole but a little longer what the 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.360
 delay is behind it 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.799
 always how long the whole lasts and whether 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.180
 I have to change or not 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.979
 if me then, for example, a 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.960
 Connection interested in carpet 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.579
 then on the one hand at my start 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.490
 station at which equal to the train 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.560
 then leaves and see underneath the 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.049
 destination station at which circle the train there 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.070
 arrives there are stops in what 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.930
 this case is not the case 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.280
 here then with the row one lists 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.880
 can then always easily infos 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.920
 catch up 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.229
 in this the red bar follows 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.320
 refill where the train is currently 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.009
 can also be found right out here 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.899
 book 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.219
 then i will give you the db tickets 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.259
 which can also be forwarded for free 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.490
 can be downloaded and then so 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.049
 For example , if I am one 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.000
 Monthly ticket from and the distance only 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:06.230
 and to drive me along with it all 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 an online ticket just on the phone 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.800
 also not possible to function 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.670
 right here in my calendar 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.380
 save 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.030
 It will then be the right one 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.250
 stored time of day and I've got 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.650
 a possibility to be remembered 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.330
 can display the whole one 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.430
 then also up here the respective 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:25.280
 Show map how the super sun 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.990
 of course, even if I drive it 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.940
 no favorite we take the whole itself 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:32.090
 For example, you can select one here 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:36.440
 station of my choice enter or came 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:38.930
 for example , then locate it 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.850
 let can enter if i 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.710
 stops want to pass which the 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.480
 you should be able to do exactly that here 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:49.340
 Enter departure date I say 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:51.980
 I would want tomorrow at 12 o'clock am 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.290
 destination station arrives similar to the above 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.120
 whole of waste on arrival and 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.290
 confirmed and finished then has the 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.450
 possibility of the tear profile too 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.890
 can determine which persons say 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.470
 right out of class second class 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.860
 i have a bank or i can not 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.820
 me all the means of transport 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.560
 Transfer time to say I just like the 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.180
 right connections and if I have a look 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.920
 his bike with the constituency also here 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.030
 then go search and search 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.850
 Now the connections are displayed 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.740
 just as close to 12 o'clock am 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.330
 augsburger main station can arrive 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.340
 Just click up and have it 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.600
 the same options over the 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.070
 I have the standard functions 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.540
 possibility that my stop 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:28.340
 announced if I have already at the beginning 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.860
 when there are not only trains displayed 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.140
 from hero also bus stops 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.459
 can also type white up here 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.380
 then I came across different 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:38.180
 navigate bus lines 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.040
 i live in your smaller town of 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.870
 heister the lavishly so big but in 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.790
 bigger cities really are enough 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.320
 the db app even if the cities share 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:48.020
 to offer on their own app 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.550
 it works really well then 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:52.010
 I still like that falls here too 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:55.040
 again directly at individual stations 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.660
 looking for what drops off or arrives and 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.760
 Last but not least a graduate is a point 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:01.700
 for bb tickets here because then i go directly 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:04.010
 forwarded to the db tickets from and 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.450
 you can buy just tickets from this 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.700
 So you really a well done 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.410
 i'm free with just iphone 5 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.690
 I'm really happy with that 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:13.970
 said at the time more often with the train and 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:15.829
 also with the bus on the way and 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.620
 actually every day had depta daily 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:18.180
 late before 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.400
 if I have the other time from 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:23.010
 which train to take is best 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.840
 because really very convenient the 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.970
 finally show next call to speed 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.169
 test can be downloaded for free 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.229
 I do not know one or the other 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:33.380
 confession the site speed ethernet 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:35.910
 just serves our current ones 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.419
 speed of the internet out too 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.280
 Find 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:39.840
 you have the opportunity if you 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.430
 Now immediately start the test 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.900
 we'll just do it 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.850
 in this case it will be a wlan 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.199
 I certainly find it interesting because I 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:48.510
 I tend to be in bigger cities right now 

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:49.919
 Most of the time I have lte 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:51.840
 connections and then I check off and 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:54.300
 to the connection speak how fast that 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.770
 whole is here you can see it's the data 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.080
 my wifi connection told me that 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:00.000
 find my local wifi network 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.410
 as far as actually very good only thing 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.180
 could be something better is the 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.490
 upload with which I am not satisfied 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.710
 but is currently no longer has 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:10.680
 then the possibility to view the data 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:12.570
 can let me down here about the 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.470
 attitudes say what I do all this 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:15.750
 want to have displayed 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:17.760
 I usually use it in kb per 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.780
 seconds can now quickly 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.870
 let sort by 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:24.960
 go for example on my results 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:27.240
 that's what I mean by the tests 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.610
 last days she then vanessa each 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.229
 and not much clock then he is here 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:33.599
 nice if it was wlan or how I like it 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:35.580
 For example, the lte 

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:37.320
 Connection leaves my home wireless 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.030
 connection can look quite old 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:41.510
 also tap up again and we 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:44.160
 however, the data is only displayed 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:46.710
 including addresses with which server 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.389
 I was connected then too good 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:49.560
 last still the possibility me the info 

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:51.720
 show 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:54.090
 Here are simply information 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:56.099
 I suspect times shown to development 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:58.139
 that here to where I can say 

00:05:56.099 --> 00:05:59.699
 Let's get it out of now , last but not least 

00:05:58.139 --> 00:06:01.139
 website that I have on the internet 

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:05.160
 I've found out now we have to 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:07.020
 first the wireless connection and hats 

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:09.000
 then have hopefully mobile net now 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:10.440
 right now I have the whole thing 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.660
 Data usage is called a website 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:14.729
 if I type now I will mine 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:16.530
 current volume of data displayed to 

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:18.000
 is still available so is in 

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:19.590
 if this case speaks of the telekom 

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.030
 also only contract with the telekom has 

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:22.620
 they can do that very well 

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:24.720
 I guess times up here up that 

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:26.610
 the full address sees resp 

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:29.460
 is almost the full address, I limit 

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:34.610
 also easy and again 

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:34.610
 the whole is from telekom.de 

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:41.010
 sportal.de metlife your current data 

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:42.900
 to show now you can see it 

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:45.810
 I used roughly 180 megawatts 

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:48.120
 of a gigabyte for days to me 

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:50.040
 stay until the month is over and 

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:52.350
 you have below the respective service 

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:54.500
 now i want the 22 02 should too 

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:57.330
 be a concept to every telecom customer 

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:59.190
 is as I said only possible if you are 

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:01.470
 We located in the mobile network as otherwise over 

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:03.180
 wlan would go in and then it is 

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:04.590
 just not possible if you maybe 

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:06.660
 do not know how to do it all on his 

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:09.240
 Stallion Ring adds notes down here 

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:09.810
 then the arrow keys go to the home 

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:12.000
 screen 

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:13.890
 then it will be added and added 

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.780
 you can name it as normal
