00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
disaster in the Gulf

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.510 
disaster in the Gulf
everybody<00:00:27.340> says<00:00:27.550> work<00:00:27.840> so<00:00:28.980> let<00:00:29.980> them<00:00:30.220> find

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:30.520 
everybody says work so let them find

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.300 
everybody says work so let them find
work<00:00:30.849> and<00:00:31.090> if<00:00:31.869> there's<00:00:32.140> an<00:00:32.349> environmental<00:00:32.980> and

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:33.310 
work and if there's an environmental and

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:35.730 
work and if there's an environmental and
health<00:00:33.490> benefit<00:00:34.000> that's<00:00:34.390> the<00:00:34.690> bonus<00:00:34.870> and<00:00:35.200> it

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:35.740 
health benefit that's the bonus and it

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:40.150 
health benefit that's the bonus and it
increases<00:00:36.579> acceptance<00:00:37.210> faster

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.930 

so<00:00:41.170> I'm<00:00:42.170> not<00:00:42.350> as<00:00:42.470> tall<00:00:42.680> as<00:00:42.860> you<00:00:42.980> guys<00:00:43.160> so<00:00:43.430> you'll

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
so I'm not as tall as you guys so you'll

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.790 
so I'm not as tall as you guys so you'll
have<00:00:44.060> to<00:00:44.240> look<00:00:44.360> and<00:00:44.510> see<00:00:44.570> from<00:00:45.140> above<00:00:45.410> if<00:00:45.620> it's

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
have to look and see from above if it's

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.750 
have to look and see from above if it's
centered<00:00:46.100> or<00:00:46.250> we<00:00:46.340> can<00:00:46.490> do<00:00:46.580> it<00:00:46.700> on<00:00:46.820> the<00:00:46.910> floor

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:48.760 
centered or we can do it on the floor

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:54.040 
centered or we can do it on the floor
somewhat<00:00:49.760> centered<00:00:50.620> okay<00:00:52.030> so<00:00:53.030> as<00:00:53.330> a<00:00:53.750> slight

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
somewhat centered okay so as a slight

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.000 
somewhat centered okay so as a slight
caveat<00:00:55.960> we<00:00:56.960> have<00:00:57.140> some<00:00:57.320> pellets<00:00:57.590> this<00:00:57.860> is

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
caveat we have some pellets this is

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.860 
caveat we have some pellets this is
tuned<00:00:58.220> to<00:00:58.250> a<00:00:58.400> smaller<00:00:58.790> diameter<00:00:59.030> pellet<00:00:59.630> but

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
tuned to a smaller diameter pellet but

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.300 
tuned to a smaller diameter pellet but
we'll<00:01:00.050> see<00:01:00.260> they<00:01:00.470> might<00:01:00.739> have<00:01:00.890> to<00:01:01.010> do<00:01:01.130> some

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:01.310 
we'll see they might have to do some

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.960 
we'll see they might have to do some
adjusting<00:01:01.700> on<00:01:01.850> the<00:01:01.880> fly<00:01:03.280> earlier<00:01:04.280> you<00:01:04.640> saw<00:01:04.850> me

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
adjusting on the fly earlier you saw me

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.330 
adjusting on the fly earlier you saw me
cutting<00:01:05.270> the<00:01:05.390> scan<00:01:05.660> the<00:01:06.560> principle<00:01:07.040> of<00:01:07.130> all

lutea<00:01:07.700> stoves<00:01:08.000> are<00:01:08.210> the<00:01:08.300> same<00:01:08.510> so<00:01:08.690> it<00:01:08.810> can<00:01:08.930> be

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
lutea stoves are the same so it can be

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.680 
lutea stoves are the same so it can be
big<00:01:09.260> or<00:01:09.380> small<00:01:09.560> I<00:01:09.920> will<00:01:10.610> try<00:01:10.820> and<00:01:10.970> go<00:01:11.060> faster

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:11.690 
big or small I will try and go faster

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:24.050 
big or small I will try and go faster
since<00:01:11.870> you're<00:01:12.020> running<00:01:12.260> out<00:01:12.380> of<00:01:12.410> time

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.789 

so<00:01:24.799> the<00:01:25.799> idea<00:01:26.130> is<00:01:27.260> you<00:01:28.260> heat<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.650> inner

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
so the idea is you heat the inner

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.170 
so the idea is you heat the inner
cylinder

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
cylinder

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.420 
cylinder
that<00:01:30.750> radiates<00:01:31.230> out<00:01:31.470> between<00:01:31.830> the<00:01:32.040> inner<00:01:32.220> and

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
that radiates out between the inner and

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.720 
that radiates out between the inner and
the<00:01:32.490> outer<00:01:32.550> cylinder<00:01:33.830> the<00:01:34.830> air<00:01:35.010> between<00:01:35.340> those

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:35.730 
the outer cylinder the air between those

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:37.910 
the outer cylinder the air between those
two<00:01:35.910> cylinders<00:01:36.330> heats<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:36.840> as<00:01:37.320> it<00:01:37.470> heats<00:01:37.680> it

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
two cylinders heats and as it heats it

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.210 
two cylinders heats and as it heats it
goes<00:01:38.100> up<00:01:38.280> as<00:01:38.900> it<00:01:39.900> goes<00:01:40.050> up<00:01:40.080> if<00:01:40.650> you<00:01:40.830> look<00:01:40.980> at<00:01:41.130> the

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
goes up as it goes up if you look at the

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.830 
goes up as it goes up if you look at the
bottom<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:41.850> go<00:01:42.000> ahead<00:01:42.120> and<00:01:42.270> peek<00:01:42.390> there's<00:01:42.630> no

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
bottom and go ahead and peek there's no

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.840 
bottom and go ahead and peek there's no
space<00:01:43.140> in<00:01:43.410> the<00:01:43.590> middle<00:01:43.830> it's<00:01:44.310> flat<00:01:44.610> it's

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
space in the middle it's flat it's

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.210 
space in the middle it's flat it's
closed<00:01:45.240> you<00:01:47.300> can<00:01:48.300> confirm<00:01:48.630> all<00:01:49.560> flows<00:01:49.920> thank

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
closed you can confirm all flows thank

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.910 
closed you can confirm all flows thank
you<00:01:50.310> so<00:01:51.920> and<00:01:53.960> you<00:01:54.960> see<00:01:55.110> that<00:01:55.260> the<00:01:55.470> two<00:01:55.619> people

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
you so and you see that the two people

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.460 
you so and you see that the two people
who<00:01:56.040> trust<00:01:56.310> me<00:01:56.430> less<00:01:56.700> mental<00:01:57.060> okay

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.639 

as<00:02:02.420> this<00:02:03.420> is<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.630> same<00:02:03.750> thing<00:02:04.140> but<00:02:04.290> in<00:02:04.440> very

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
as this is the same thing but in very

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.950 
as this is the same thing but in very
small<00:02:04.920> version<00:02:05.100> so<00:02:05.880> it's<00:02:06.360> closed<00:02:06.720> at<00:02:06.899> the

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
small version so it's closed at the

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.979 
small version so it's closed at the
bottom<00:02:07.290> as<00:02:07.910> the<00:02:08.910> space<00:02:09.270> between<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:09.840> outer

comes<00:02:11.880> up<00:02:12.120> and<00:02:12.570> the<00:02:13.020> key<00:02:13.170> in<00:02:13.350> this<00:02:13.470> case<00:02:13.530> it

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
comes up and the key in this case it

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.080 
comes up and the key in this case it
comes<00:02:14.100> through<00:02:14.220> holes<00:02:14.430> in<00:02:14.520> the<00:02:14.640> bottom<00:02:14.880> here

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
comes through holes in the bottom here

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.760 
comes through holes in the bottom here
I've<00:02:15.180> just<00:02:15.209> quickly<00:02:15.989> made<00:02:16.170> some<00:02:16.350> holes<00:02:16.530> on<00:02:16.680> the

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
I've just quickly made some holes on the

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.699 
I've just quickly made some holes on the
outside<00:02:16.800> as<00:02:17.430> that<00:02:18.360> air<00:02:18.540> comes<00:02:18.810> up<00:02:18.989> past<00:02:19.410> these

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
outside as that air comes up past these

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.340 
outside as that air comes up past these
it's<00:02:20.550> just<00:02:20.700> like<00:02:21.150> when<00:02:21.510> you<00:02:21.600> blow<00:02:21.780> on<00:02:21.810> a<00:02:22.020> bottle

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
it's just like when you blow on a bottle

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.160 
it's just like when you blow on a bottle
and<00:02:22.440> you<00:02:22.530> get<00:02:22.650> them<00:02:22.770> right<00:02:23.610> so<00:02:24.570> these<00:02:24.750> that's

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
and you get them right so these that's

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.650 
and you get them right so these that's
the<00:02:25.380> Bernoulli<00:02:25.800> effect<00:02:25.890> and<00:02:26.340> these<00:02:27.090> then<00:02:27.420> act

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
the Bernoulli effect and these then act

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.690 
the Bernoulli effect and these then act
like<00:02:27.750> venturi<00:02:28.290> and<00:02:28.530> they<00:02:28.770> rather<00:02:29.160> than<00:02:29.430> blow

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
like venturi and they rather than blow

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.810 
like venturi and they rather than blow
air<00:02:29.970> in<00:02:30.180> they<00:02:30.540> draw<00:02:30.780> air<00:02:30.989> out<00:02:31.250> so<00:02:32.780> if<00:02:33.780> if<00:02:34.350> I'm

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
air in they draw air out so if if I'm

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
air in they draw air out so if if I'm
sucking<00:02:35.820> like<00:02:35.910> that<00:02:36.120> and<00:02:36.299> I'm<00:02:36.390> close<00:02:36.600> on<00:02:36.780> the

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
sucking like that and I'm close on the

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.240 
sucking like that and I'm close on the
bottom<00:02:37.140> where<00:02:37.410> can<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:37.650> air<00:02:37.799> come<00:02:38.040> from

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
bottom where can the air come from

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.970 
bottom where can the air come from
because<00:02:38.730> I<00:02:38.940> can't<00:02:39.209> if<00:02:39.720> I<00:02:39.840> it<00:02:40.440> has<00:02:40.650> to<00:02:40.769> come<00:02:40.950> from

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
because I can't if I it has to come from

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.310 
because I can't if I it has to come from
someplace<00:02:41.340> where<00:02:42.269> would<00:02:42.420> it<00:02:42.540> come<00:02:42.570> from<00:02:42.780> it

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
someplace where would it come from it

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.710 
someplace where would it come from it
has<00:02:43.530> to<00:02:43.680> it<00:02:43.830> can<00:02:44.040> only<00:02:44.220> come<00:02:44.519> from<00:02:44.640> the<00:02:44.730> top<00:02:45.000> so

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
has to it can only come from the top so

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.890 
has to it can only come from the top so
the<00:02:46.410> Lucia's<00:02:47.310> stoves<00:02:47.580> function<00:02:48.390> on<00:02:48.540> the<00:02:48.630> idea

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
the Lucia's stoves function on the idea

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.320 
the Lucia's stoves function on the idea
that<00:02:48.959> you<00:02:49.560> draw<00:02:49.830> the<00:02:49.890> gases<00:02:50.459> out<00:02:50.610> and<00:02:50.880> smoke<00:02:51.180> is

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
that you draw the gases out and smoke is

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.050 
that you draw the gases out and smoke is
just<00:02:51.360> not<00:02:51.930> burnt<00:02:52.170> fuel<00:02:52.440> you<00:02:53.160> draw<00:02:53.400> that<00:02:53.580> out<00:02:53.820> at

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
just not burnt fuel you draw that out at

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.720 
just not burnt fuel you draw that out at
less<00:02:54.930> than<00:02:54.959> the<00:02:55.230> rate<00:02:55.500> it<00:02:55.709> takes<00:02:55.980> to<00:02:56.220> use<00:02:56.400> all

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
less than the rate it takes to use all

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.910 
less than the rate it takes to use all
the<00:02:56.910> oxygen<00:02:57.390> in<00:02:57.510> the<00:02:57.540> air<00:02:57.630> before<00:02:58.410> it<00:02:58.680> goes

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
the oxygen in the air before it goes

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.520 
the oxygen in the air before it goes
through<00:02:59.130> the<00:02:59.220> flame<00:03:00.049> afterwards<00:03:01.049> all<00:03:01.290> you

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
through the flame afterwards all you

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.650 
through the flame afterwards all you
have<00:03:01.739> are<00:03:01.950> leftover<00:03:02.400> inert<00:03:02.760> gases<00:03:03.239> which<00:03:03.510> are

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
have are leftover inert gases which are

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.130 
have are leftover inert gases which are
nitrogen<00:03:04.049> mostly<00:03:05.150> very<00:03:06.150> hot<00:03:06.420> nitrogen<00:03:06.989> then

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
nitrogen mostly very hot nitrogen then

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.680 
nitrogen mostly very hot nitrogen then
goes<00:03:07.980> through<00:03:08.220> that<00:03:08.370> and<00:03:08.670> since<00:03:09.420> there's<00:03:09.630> no

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
goes through that and since there's no

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.410 
goes through that and since there's no
oxygen<00:03:10.140> here<00:03:10.470> these<00:03:10.650> can't<00:03:11.010> ignite<00:03:11.370> and<00:03:11.670> since

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
oxygen here these can't ignite and since

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.080 
oxygen here these can't ignite and since
they<00:03:12.570> can't<00:03:12.840> ignite<00:03:13.140> they<00:03:13.980> release<00:03:14.280> gas<00:03:14.579> which

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
they can't ignite they release gas which

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.420 
they can't ignite they release gas which
is<00:03:15.239> called<00:03:15.450> pyrolysis<00:03:15.829> the<00:03:16.829> gas<00:03:17.010> comes<00:03:17.280> out

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
is called pyrolysis the gas comes out

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.190 
is called pyrolysis the gas comes out
mixes<00:03:18.000> with<00:03:18.150> the<00:03:18.180> air<00:03:18.269> and<00:03:18.660> continues<00:03:19.079> the

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
mixes with the air and continues the

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.020 
mixes with the air and continues the
process<00:03:19.350> until<00:03:19.799> you<00:03:19.920> run<00:03:20.040> out<00:03:20.190> of<00:03:20.250> bottles<00:03:21.019> so

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
process until you run out of bottles so

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.890 
process until you run out of bottles so
essentially

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.650 

that's<00:03:27.900> a<00:03:28.020> lucha<00:03:28.290> stove

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:48.430 

so<00:03:35.020> no<00:03:37.030> toys<00:03:44.440> we<00:03:45.440> have<00:03:45.470> please<00:03:47.440> excellent

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
so no toys we have please excellent

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.250 
so no toys we have please excellent
question<00:03:48.680> so<00:03:49.630> you<00:03:50.630> should<00:03:50.810> come<00:03:50.900> to<00:03:51.080> all<00:03:51.140> the

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
question so you should come to all the

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.000 
question so you should come to all the
demonstrations<00:03:51.530> thank<00:03:52.310> you<00:03:53.560> it<00:03:54.560> does<00:03:54.800> need<00:03:54.980> to

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
demonstrations thank you it does need to

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.440 
demonstrations thank you it does need to
be<00:03:55.130> dry<00:03:55.430> up<00:03:56.030> to<00:03:56.480> 30%<00:03:56.960> humidity<00:03:57.740> is<00:03:57.830> okay<00:03:58.450> beyond

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
be dry up to 30% humidity is okay beyond

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.390 
be dry up to 30% humidity is okay beyond
30<00:03:59.780> percent<00:04:00.170> humidity<00:04:00.350> about<00:04:00.890> half<00:04:01.160> your

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
30 percent humidity about half your

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.980 
30 percent humidity about half your
energy<00:04:01.430> is<00:04:01.970> going<00:04:02.150> to<00:04:02.270> be<00:04:02.390> used<00:04:02.540> to<00:04:02.660> get<00:04:02.810> rid<00:04:02.930> of

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:02.990 
energy is going to be used to get rid of

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:05.560 
energy is going to be used to get rid of
the<00:04:03.140> water<00:04:03.290> so<00:04:03.950> you<00:04:04.850> can<00:04:05.000> either<00:04:05.180> use<00:04:05.390> the

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:05.570 
the water so you can either use the

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:08.020 
the water so you can either use the
energy<00:04:05.930> to<00:04:06.080> make<00:04:06.200> food<00:04:06.920> and<00:04:07.130> electricity<00:04:07.520> or

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
energy to make food and electricity or

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.910 
energy to make food and electricity or
whatever<00:04:08.360> or<00:04:08.990> you<00:04:09.140> can<00:04:09.260> use<00:04:09.380> it<00:04:09.530> to<00:04:09.620> get<00:04:09.740> rid<00:04:09.860> of

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
whatever or you can use it to get rid of

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.190 
whatever or you can use it to get rid of
water<00:04:10.160> so<00:04:10.400> better<00:04:11.150> let<00:04:11.450> it<00:04:11.480> dry<00:04:11.780> a<00:04:11.810> little<00:04:11.990> bit

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.850 

that<00:04:15.200> won't<00:04:15.590> work<00:04:15.860> however<00:04:17.140> if<00:04:18.140> it's<00:04:18.470> dry

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:18.860 
that won't work however if it's dry

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:22.330 
that won't work however if it's dry
what's<00:04:19.790> really<00:04:20.180> neat<00:04:20.360> you<00:04:20.600> know<00:04:20.720> I<00:04:21.380> mean<00:04:21.739> look

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
what's really neat you know I mean look

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.190 
what's really neat you know I mean look
at<00:04:22.400> look<00:04:22.580> at<00:04:22.640> the<00:04:22.760> almonds<00:04:23.120> right<00:04:23.660> if<00:04:23.900> you<00:04:24.050> just

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
at look at the almonds right if you just

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.010 
at look at the almonds right if you just
take<00:04:24.380> some<00:04:24.530> out<00:04:25.150> you<00:04:26.150> can<00:04:26.300> see<00:04:26.480> it's<00:04:26.630> an<00:04:26.720> almond

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
take some out you can see it's an almond

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.050 
take some out you can see it's an almond
right<00:04:27.190> because<00:04:28.190> what<00:04:28.370> it<00:04:28.490> does<00:04:28.670> is<00:04:28.910> it

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
right because what it does is it

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.050 
right because what it does is it
extracts<00:04:29.870> all<00:04:30.170> the<00:04:30.470> gases<00:04:30.860> and<00:04:31.100> leaves<00:04:31.790> the

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
extracts all the gases and leaves the

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.080 
extracts all the gases and leaves the
basic<00:04:32.450> structure<00:04:32.840> unchanged<00:04:33.670> so<00:04:34.670> all<00:04:34.880> the

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
basic structure unchanged so all the

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.240 
basic structure unchanged so all the
cells<00:04:35.330> become<00:04:35.810> little<00:04:36.140> tiny<00:04:36.380> reservoirs<00:04:37.010> for

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
cells become little tiny reservoirs for

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.060 
cells become little tiny reservoirs for
microbes<00:04:37.640> and<00:04:37.760> water<00:04:38.230> so<00:04:39.230> I've<00:04:39.710> done<00:04:39.950> it

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
microbes and water so I've done it

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.010 
microbes and water so I've done it
multiple<00:04:40.910> times<00:04:40.970> people<00:04:41.630> like<00:04:41.840> this

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
multiple times people like this

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:51.000 
take take the gasses out and then I have
a<00:04:48.520> completely<00:04:49.520> black<00:04:49.820> flower<00:04:50.090> that<00:04:50.360> weighs

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.010 
a completely black flower that weighs

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:52.870 
a completely black flower that weighs
one-fifth<00:04:52.010> of<00:04:52.190> what<00:04:52.250> it<00:04:52.490> weighed<00:04:52.669> before

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
one-fifth of what it weighed before

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.760 
one-fifth of what it weighed before
because<00:04:53.570> I've<00:04:53.720> taken<00:04:53.930> everything<00:04:54.260> else<00:04:54.560> out

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
but the structure is intact I'll need

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.570 
but the structure is intact I'll need

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.920 

now<00:05:17.880> I<00:05:17.910> know<00:05:18.150> it<00:05:18.270> might<00:05:18.420> be<00:05:18.480> a<00:05:18.630> disadvantage

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:18.930 
now I know it might be a disadvantage

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:20.990 
now I know it might be a disadvantage
for<00:05:19.320> you<00:05:19.560> but<00:05:19.890> would<00:05:20.190> you<00:05:20.220> mind<00:05:20.460> if<00:05:20.580> I<00:05:20.700> put<00:05:20.910> this

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.000 
for you but would you mind if I put this

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.780 
for you but would you mind if I put this
on<00:05:21.150> the<00:05:21.180> floor<00:05:21.450> cuz<00:05:21.750> I'm<00:05:22.560> too<00:05:23.220> short<00:05:23.430> to<00:05:23.550> look

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:23.790 
on the floor cuz I'm too short to look

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:34.250 
on the floor cuz I'm too short to look
down<00:05:24.050> and<00:05:25.050> I'm<00:05:25.740> not<00:05:32.060> no<00:05:33.060> this<00:05:33.330> is<00:05:33.480> solid<00:05:33.840> so

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:34.260 
down and I'm not no this is solid so

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:35.830 
down and I'm not no this is solid so
you'll<00:05:34.410> see<00:05:34.590> this<00:05:34.740> burning<00:05:35.040> in<00:05:35.220> the<00:05:35.310> beginning

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840 
you'll see this burning in the beginning

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.260 
you'll see this burning in the beginning
when<00:05:36.840> the<00:05:37.080> cap<00:05:37.260> is<00:05:37.440> on<00:05:37.610> it<00:05:38.610> starts<00:05:39.060> burning

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.270 
when the cap is on it starts burning

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.590 
when the cap is on it starts burning
just<00:05:39.630> the<00:05:39.780> gases<00:05:40.170> and<00:05:40.200> so<00:05:40.440> almost<00:05:40.890> instantly

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:41.600 
just the gases and so almost instantly

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.190 
just the gases and so almost instantly
down<00:05:42.600> below

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:43.200 
down below

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.050 
down below
most<00:05:43.680> of<00:05:43.860> the<00:05:43.920> combustion<00:05:44.280> will<00:05:44.550> stop<00:05:44.790> and

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:45.060 
most of the combustion will stop and

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.650 
most of the combustion will stop and
you'll<00:05:45.990> see<00:05:46.260> a<00:05:46.470> cap<00:05:47.340> of<00:05:47.520> flame<00:05:47.760> form<00:05:48.360> here

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:48.660 
you'll see a cap of flame form here

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.410 
you'll see a cap of flame form here
which<00:05:48.930> starts<00:05:49.350> turning<00:05:49.620> real<00:05:49.920> quickly<00:05:50.420> once

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:51.420 
which starts turning real quickly once

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:53.860 
which starts turning real quickly once
that<00:05:51.720> is<00:05:51.840> fully<00:05:52.080> formed<00:05:52.380> below<00:05:52.950> there<00:05:53.250> will<00:05:53.310> be

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:53.870 
that is fully formed below there will be

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:57.740 
that is fully formed below there will be
no<00:05:54.870> gas<00:05:55.170> and<00:05:55.500> therefore<00:05:56.340> no<00:05:56.970> more<00:05:57.150> combustion

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:57.750 
no gas and therefore no more combustion

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:59.450 
no gas and therefore no more combustion
no<00:05:58.020> more<00:05:58.170> oxygen<00:05:58.320> sir<00:05:58.710> no<00:05:58.830> more<00:05:58.950> combustion

00:05:59.450 --> 00:05:59.460 
no more oxygen sir no more combustion

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:01.190 
no more oxygen sir no more combustion
and<00:05:59.640> at<00:06:00.150> that<00:06:00.330> point<00:06:00.480> we<00:06:00.660> can<00:06:00.780> even<00:06:00.960> take

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:01.200 
and at that point we can even take

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.680 
and at that point we can even take
things<00:06:01.530> as<00:06:01.740> you<00:06:01.920> were<00:06:02.040> asking<00:06:02.430> if<00:06:02.610> your<00:06:03.510> leaf

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:03.690 
things as you were asking if your leaf

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:05.000 
things as you were asking if your leaf
had<00:06:03.870> been<00:06:04.020> dry<00:06:04.170> we<00:06:04.350> could<00:06:04.530> have<00:06:04.620> dropped<00:06:04.860> that

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:05.010 
had been dry we could have dropped that

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:06.650 
had been dry we could have dropped that
in<00:06:05.190> and<00:06:05.400> you<00:06:05.460> could<00:06:05.610> watch<00:06:05.790> the<00:06:06.030> gas<00:06:06.210> come<00:06:06.510> out

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:06.660 
in and you could watch the gas come out

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:10.040 
in and you could watch the gas come out
of<00:06:06.810> it<00:06:06.930> and<00:06:07.590> go<00:06:07.800> down<00:06:08.270> the<00:06:09.270> other<00:06:09.450> advantages

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:10.050 
of it and go down the other advantages

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:12.350 
of it and go down the other advantages
since<00:06:10.650> down<00:06:10.980> below<00:06:11.280> you<00:06:11.640> have<00:06:11.670> charcoal

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:12.360 
since down below you have charcoal

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.720 
since down below you have charcoal
charcoal<00:06:12.840> is<00:06:12.990> a<00:06:13.020> great<00:06:13.290> filter<00:06:13.560> right<00:06:14.550> the

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:14.730 
charcoal is a great filter right the

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:16.310 
charcoal is a great filter right the
same<00:06:14.940> things<00:06:15.180> that<00:06:15.270> you<00:06:15.450> use<00:06:15.600> to<00:06:15.810> filter<00:06:16.050> this

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:16.320 
same things that you use to filter this

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:17.870 
same things that you use to filter this
air<00:06:16.830> that's<00:06:17.100> coming<00:06:17.400> through<00:06:17.520> those<00:06:17.700> fun

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:17.880 
air that's coming through those fun

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:20.840 
air that's coming through those fun
events<00:06:18.440> is<00:06:19.440> a<00:06:19.500> charcoal<00:06:19.919> filter<00:06:20.070> so<00:06:20.490> by<00:06:20.669> having

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:20.850 
events is a charcoal filter so by having

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:22.760 
events is a charcoal filter so by having
the<00:06:21.120> gas<00:06:21.240> go<00:06:21.540> first<00:06:21.990> through<00:06:22.230> the<00:06:22.380> charcoal

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:22.770 
the gas go first through the charcoal

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:24.920 
the gas go first through the charcoal
and<00:06:22.980> then<00:06:23.220> come<00:06:23.520> get<00:06:23.730> combusted<00:06:24.390> you're

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:24.930 
and then come get combusted you're

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:31.660 
and then come get combusted you're
cleaning<00:06:25.260> a<00:06:25.470> lot<00:06:25.590> of<00:06:25.770> the<00:06:25.860> things<00:06:26.070> out<00:06:26.250> of<00:06:26.280> it

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:31.670 

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:33.520 

it's<00:06:32.000> a<00:06:32.090> good<00:06:32.270> question<00:06:32.450> it'll<00:06:32.990> vary<00:06:33.200> from

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:33.530 
it's a good question it'll vary from

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:35.680 
it's a good question it'll vary from
biomass<00:06:34.040> to<00:06:34.250> biomass<00:06:34.640> good<00:06:34.970> pyrolysis<00:06:35.270> is

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:35.690 
biomass to biomass good pyrolysis is

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:37.150 
biomass to biomass good pyrolysis is
taking<00:06:35.990> place<00:06:36.110> around<00:06:36.320> 500<00:06:36.920> degrees

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:37.160 
taking place around 500 degrees

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:42.310 
taking place around 500 degrees
centigrade<00:06:37.690> so<00:06:38.710> she'll<00:06:39.710> be<00:06:39.740> Oh<00:06:40.930> in<00:06:41.930> the<00:06:42.080> end

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:42.320 
centigrade so she'll be Oh in the end

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:48.910 
centigrade so she'll be Oh in the end
the<00:06:42.500> big<00:06:42.650> bowl<00:06:42.890> so<00:06:43.160> we<00:06:43.280> can<00:06:43.400> put<00:06:43.580> that<00:06:43.700> in<00:06:47.920> yeah

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:48.920 
the big bowl so we can put that in yeah

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:57.130 
the big bowl so we can put that in yeah
this<00:06:49.130> is<00:06:49.250> just<00:06:49.460> could<00:06:50.120> be<00:06:50.270> paper<00:06:50.570> could<00:06:55.630> no<00:06:56.630> no

00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:57.140 
this is just could be paper could no no

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:58.750 
this is just could be paper could no no
no<00:06:57.260> that's<00:06:57.500> just<00:06:57.590> where<00:06:57.860> the<00:06:57.980> gas<00:06:58.160> is<00:06:58.190> passing

00:06:58.750 --> 00:06:58.760 
no that's just where the gas is passing

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:03.100 
no that's just where the gas is passing
okay<00:07:00.250> yeah<00:07:01.250> and<00:07:01.490> this<00:07:02.390> is<00:07:02.570> you<00:07:02.720> can<00:07:02.900> actually

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:03.110 
okay yeah and this is you can actually

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:05.290 
okay yeah and this is you can actually
see<00:07:03.440> the<00:07:03.560> smoke<00:07:03.800> now<00:07:04.010> yeah<00:07:04.220> so<00:07:04.910> go<00:07:05.060> ahead<00:07:05.120> and

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:05.300 
see the smoke now yeah so go ahead and

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:06.640
