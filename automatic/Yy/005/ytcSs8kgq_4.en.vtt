00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:30.770 
had a lot of clumping issues with it now

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.340 
had a lot of clumping issues with it now
if<00:00:30.890> you<00:00:30.980> look<00:00:31.130> in<00:00:31.250> mine<00:00:31.430> it's<00:00:32.329> totally<00:00:32.750> gone

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
if you look in mine it's totally gone

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.250 
if you look in mine it's totally gone
right<00:00:33.680> but<00:00:33.980> the<00:00:34.880> main<00:00:35.090> thing<00:00:35.360> in<00:00:35.870> order<00:00:36.020> to

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
right but the main thing in order to

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.930 
right but the main thing in order to
avoid<00:00:36.620> having<00:00:37.060> clumping<00:00:38.060> with<00:00:38.240> c4<00:00:38.720> is<00:00:39.940> you

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
avoid having clumping with c4 is you

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.460 
avoid having clumping with c4 is you
need<00:00:41.090> to<00:00:41.180> keep<00:00:41.329> that<00:00:41.570> pillow<00:00:41.840> pack<00:00:42.110> in<00:00:42.290> there

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:42.470 
need to keep that pillow pack in there

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.250 
need to keep that pillow pack in there
I've<00:00:43.400> never<00:00:44.030> taken<00:00:44.329> mine<00:00:44.660> out<00:00:44.840> and<00:00:44.870> I<00:00:45.020> always

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
I've never taken mine out and I always

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.680 
I've never taken mine out and I always
leave<00:00:45.530> it<00:00:45.590> in<00:00:45.770> there<00:00:45.950> I<00:00:46.149> just<00:00:47.149> move<00:00:47.360> it<00:00:47.480> to<00:00:47.570> the

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
leave it in there I just move it to the

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.479 
leave it in there I just move it to the
side<00:00:47.899> get<00:00:48.410> it<00:00:48.500> out<00:00:48.620> of<00:00:48.739> the<00:00:48.800> waste<00:00:49.010> and<00:00:49.220> get<00:00:49.370> the

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
side get it out of the waste and get the

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:51.729 
side get it out of the waste and get the
scoops<00:00:49.760> that<00:00:49.850> I<00:00:49.970> need<00:00:50.300> and<00:00:51.140> the<00:00:51.260> other<00:00:51.410> thing

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
scoops that I need and the other thing

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:55.510 
scoops that I need and the other thing
is<00:00:51.950> that<00:00:52.760> you<00:00:53.690> need<00:00:53.840> to<00:00:54.170> maybe<00:00:54.890> every<00:00:55.309> day

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
is that you need to maybe every day

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.630 
is that you need to maybe every day
every<00:00:55.850> two<00:00:56.120> days<00:00:56.329> you<00:00:56.690> need<00:00:56.840> to<00:00:57.340> kind<00:00:58.340> of<00:00:58.430> move

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
every two days you need to kind of move

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.340 
every two days you need to kind of move
it<00:00:58.850> like<00:00:58.969> this<00:00:59.270> with<00:00:59.540> the<00:00:59.630> top<00:00:59.840> closed<00:01:00.170> of

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
it like this with the top closed of

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.270 
it like this with the top closed of
course<00:01:00.590> in<00:01:00.890> a<00:01:01.120> circular<00:01:02.120> motion<00:01:02.570> and<00:01:03.280> almost

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
course in a circular motion and almost

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.580 
course in a circular motion and almost
think<00:01:04.489> of<00:01:04.579> like<00:01:04.759> a<00:01:04.790> spiral<00:01:05.780> right<00:01:06.170> like<00:01:06.440> you're

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
think of like a spiral right like you're

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
think of like a spiral right like you're
going<00:01:06.740> like<00:01:06.920> that<00:01:07.870> really<00:01:08.870> fast<00:01:09.290> with<00:01:10.280> the<00:01:10.400> top

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
going like that really fast with the top

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.130 
going like that really fast with the top
closed<00:01:10.909> and<00:01:11.120> what<00:01:11.240> that<00:01:11.390> does<00:01:11.600> is<00:01:11.900> it's<00:01:12.080> going

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
closed and what that does is it's going

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.500 
closed and what that does is it's going
to<00:01:12.320> spin<00:01:13.310> up<00:01:13.430> all<00:01:13.610> the<00:01:13.729> ingredients<00:01:14.240> almost

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:14.510 
to spin up all the ingredients almost

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.140 
to spin up all the ingredients almost
like<00:01:14.630> what<00:01:14.810> they<00:01:14.930> do<00:01:14.990> at<00:01:15.440> the<00:01:16.150> manufacturing

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
like what they do at the manufacturing

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.120 
like what they do at the manufacturing
plant<00:01:17.210> when<00:01:18.200> they're<00:01:18.350> blending<00:01:18.860> all<00:01:18.979> the

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
plant when they're blending all the

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.070 
plant when they're blending all the
ingredients<00:01:19.670> they<00:01:19.790> do<00:01:20.119> that<00:01:20.299> for<00:01:20.570> hours<00:01:20.930> and

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
ingredients they do that for hours and

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.420 
ingredients they do that for hours and
hours<00:01:21.380> and<00:01:21.500> hours<00:01:21.619> to<00:01:21.799> get<00:01:22.010> all<00:01:22.070> the

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
hours and hours to get all the

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.670 
hours and hours to get all the
ingredients<00:01:22.520> mixed<00:01:23.119> together<00:01:23.210> so<00:01:24.110> yeah<00:01:24.470> guys

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
ingredients mixed together so yeah guys

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.680 
ingredients mixed together so yeah guys
it's<00:01:24.950> really<00:01:25.130> just<00:01:25.430> three<00:01:25.760> simple<00:01:26.000> things<00:01:26.450> to

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:26.690 
it's really just three simple things to

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:28.660 
it's really just three simple things to
avoid<00:01:27.080> you're<00:01:27.440> pretty<00:01:27.890> worked<00:01:28.100> out<00:01:28.250> in<00:01:28.520> this

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
avoid you're pretty worked out in this

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.660 
avoid you're pretty worked out in this
case<00:01:28.909> c4<00:01:29.420> extreme<00:01:29.780> from<00:01:30.110> being<00:01:30.950> super<00:01:31.280> clumpy

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
case c4 extreme from being super clumpy

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.859 
case c4 extreme from being super clumpy
now<00:01:32.210> if<00:01:32.330> you<00:01:32.450> ordered<00:01:32.780> it<00:01:32.869> and<00:01:33.280> it<00:01:34.280> just<00:01:34.580> came

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:34.869 
now if you ordered it and it just came

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:37.719 
now if you ordered it and it just came
super<00:01:35.869> clumped<00:01:36.320> up<00:01:36.409> and<00:01:36.740> it<00:01:36.860> just<00:01:37.100> seemed<00:01:37.369> like

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
super clumped up and it just seemed like

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:40.840 
super clumped up and it just seemed like
all<00:01:38.150> gritty<00:01:38.570> and<00:01:38.840> just<00:01:39.320> wouldn't<00:01:40.040> be<00:01:40.310> soft

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
all gritty and just wouldn't be soft

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.730 
all gritty and just wouldn't be soft
powder<00:01:41.119> at<00:01:41.299> all<00:01:41.420> then<00:01:41.720> you<00:01:42.229> may<00:01:42.350> want<00:01:42.470> to<00:01:42.560> call

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.240 
try to avoid that in any condition is
stir<00:02:00.110> it<00:02:00.340> by<00:02:01.340> moving<00:02:01.670> it<00:02:01.880> circular<00:02:02.360> fashion

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
stir it by moving it circular fashion

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.240 
stir it by moving it circular fashion
