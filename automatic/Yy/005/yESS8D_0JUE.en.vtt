show<00:02:44.400> you<00:02:44.610> guys<00:02:44.849> the<00:02:45.030> texture<00:02:45.510> of<00:02:45.540> it<00:02:47.030> but<00:02:48.030> this

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
show you guys the texture of it but this

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:54.890 
show you guys the texture of it but this
is<00:02:48.239> pretty<00:02:48.660> much<00:02:48.870> a<00:02:49.110> week<00:02:49.879> hold<00:02:51.500> it<00:02:52.500> is<00:02:53.480> of<00:02:54.480> all

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
is pretty much a week hold it is of all

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.670 
is pretty much a week hold it is of all
the<00:02:55.290> of<00:02:55.859> all<00:02:56.220> the<00:02:56.720> curly<00:02:57.720> hair<00:02:57.959> I<00:02:58.109> say<00:02:58.440> I've

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
the of all the curly hair I say I've

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:59.660 
the of all the curly hair I say I've
ever<00:02:59.069> owned

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
ever owned

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.449 
ever owned
I<00:02:59.700> think<00:03:00.299> this<00:03:00.510> is<00:03:00.660> probably<00:03:00.950> the<00:03:01.950> cheapest

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
I think this is probably the cheapest

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.360 
I think this is probably the cheapest
because<00:03:02.880> this<00:03:03.420> path<00:03:03.720> literally<00:03:04.260> cost<00:03:04.500> me<00:03:04.709> 99

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
because this path literally cost me 99

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.360 
because this path literally cost me 99
um<00:03:05.959> and<00:03:06.959> this<00:03:07.530> is<00:03:07.680> what<00:03:07.829> we<00:03:07.950> the<00:03:08.069> chick<00:03:08.250> this

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
um and this is what we the chick this

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.099 
um and this is what we the chick this
year<00:03:08.519> I've<00:03:08.700> ever<00:03:08.730> owned<00:03:09.299> beside<00:03:09.690> my<00:03:09.840> braids

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:10.109 
year I've ever owned beside my braids

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:11.839 
year I've ever owned beside my braids
because<00:03:10.560> the<00:03:10.739> owner<00:03:10.889> braids<00:03:11.280> are<00:03:11.430> quite<00:03:11.639> cheap

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:11.849 
because the owner braids are quite cheap

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:14.059 
because the owner braids are quite cheap
but<00:03:12.720> this<00:03:12.930> is<00:03:13.109> definitely<00:03:13.290> the<00:03:13.620> cheapest

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
but this is definitely the cheapest

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:17.720 
but this is definitely the cheapest
weave<00:03:14.310> I've<00:03:14.670> ever<00:03:15.030> purchased<00:03:15.359> and<00:03:15.750> I<00:03:16.730> just

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
weave I've ever purchased and I just

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.550 
weave I've ever purchased and I just
wanted<00:03:17.880> to<00:03:18.000> wear<00:03:18.150> for<00:03:18.359> holiday<00:03:18.840> but<00:03:19.139> it<00:03:19.260> turns

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
wanted to wear for holiday but it turns

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.110 
wanted to wear for holiday but it turns
out<00:03:19.739> that<00:03:19.950> it<00:03:20.099> might<00:03:20.250> actually<00:03:20.280> last<00:03:20.669> me<00:03:20.880> a<00:03:20.910> lot

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
out that it might actually last me a lot

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.909 
out that it might actually last me a lot
longer<00:03:21.299> than<00:03:21.510> I<00:03:21.720> thought<00:03:21.900> and<00:03:22.319> I<00:03:22.620> I'm

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:22.919 
longer than I thought and I I'm

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:25.069 
longer than I thought and I I'm
absolutely<00:03:23.430> okay<00:03:23.669> with<00:03:23.970> it<00:03:24.150> and<00:03:24.599> think<00:03:24.989> this

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
absolutely okay with it and think this

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:27.199 
absolutely okay with it and think this
will<00:03:25.260> usher<00:03:25.410> you<00:03:25.560> might<00:03:25.859> go<00:03:26.040> to<00:03:26.069> a<00:03:26.549> weave

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
will usher you might go to a weave

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:31.099 
will usher you might go to a weave
