00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 the beautiful good day dear people 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:16.800
 got to rage with the way I wanted 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:18.690
 finally for the first time I have to 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.279
 I really want to watch how the whole thing 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.980
 Game works that way I'm real 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.109
 not good in this game 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:27.960
 okay maybe somehow so 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.750
 At least it seems right as he completely 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.210
 are good in the game 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:35.550
 okay we have the bow we have here 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.480
 on it on the only one the bow one on 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.350
 most of them too 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:43.860
 somehow all were coming from 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.969
 Jeep okay is a very funny game 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.840
 Definitely we have to like it 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:52.370
 looks quite like somehow 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:55.370
 they have but certainly not the job 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.370
 com 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.320
 the wonderful we do not do that 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.460
 Actually, it shit really well 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:06.020
 in the game until now at least know 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.220
 that again a wm would have saved me 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.909
 without fun you are always in the same 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.490
 put 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:12.280
 if i could stair any or or 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.240
 it did not even happen to him sometimes 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.729
 okay are also and finally 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.960
 died again immediately 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:19.130
 Just shoot yourself is synonymous 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.729
 why can not you do it in his 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.710
 yes I have the problem because I have 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:26.869
 wrong here because it is not on the one 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.420
 my sword is straight is pretty 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:30.470
 unfamiliar to me personally 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:34.490
 we are packing for it because of me 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:36.200
 Also here someone got used to 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.369
 is precisely the sword on the one 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.119
 I did not hit the one in the bow 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:44.149
 maybe another somehow I 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:45.369
 get behind the guys or something like that 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:47.780
 just have to pack a bit 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:50.539
 things mode where you are not necessarily very 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:53.110
 By the way, I can say a lot 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:53.110
 personally straight 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:02:00.130
 they will definitely not come back 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.060
 more so good at running somehow 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:05.960
 yes I have other things too 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:08.390
 I know yes I'll see if I the 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.569
 could put that but sometimes 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.650
 died a jeep really hotkey 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:16.980
 do not forget 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:19.260
 so this is dingens we can call 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.659
 hopefully as it is 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:25.260
 so we have to be more precise with that 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:27.780
 then in stripclubs but neither me 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.849
 You can sometimes meet really blatantly 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.799
 We already knew that a bit 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:34.670
 I'll try this game 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:34.670
 Never really played this way 

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:39.959
 No one did not stop attacking me 

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:45.629
 was just as good that no fact on 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:50.810
 the inhabitant in high arch jan 12 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:50.810
 run again 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.070
 there is the other one was hit me though 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:02.840
 the case I have made 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:06.750
 actually nice nice all of us 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:09.240
 hello I'm really one of the whole 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.770
 likes to use the bow, I think I'm 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:15.510
 hawk is not mine and the computex 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:17.460
 is not that homophobic actually 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.660
 met 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:22.150
 even shoots me okay too 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:25.530
 I am me for the other other people 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:30.850
 of course, then has the bow there then 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:31.930
 meet again with extremely fun it 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.880
 was really my first round 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:37.380
 Actually, this is how I play this game mode 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:41.430
 I almost never play 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.430
 not at all hit straight 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:49.590
 no information for that 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:51.460
 if I did not even hit 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.830
 I was kind of back to the 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:56.620
 sword intervene what I had 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:59.170
 I hate it so much it is right 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:04.660
 bad that I just do not like that 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:07.170
 can go never really namely when 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.910
 have become such a bad thing 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:12.420
 we get nice up there 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:16.150
 maybe one nice shoot 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:18.120
 voice head is still all 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:23.699
 dies again 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:26.580
 but okay so it's arch has mainz 

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:28.590
 the other is not mine for me 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.940
 so is the bow is a and o then 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.470
 you win here with the player 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:36.680
 actually values ​​someday 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:39.570
 you can see that somewhere so nice 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:43.260
 camera he comes or comes naturally 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:47.960
 We have always here too 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:56.539
 i can meet katjes here too 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:56.539
 nice one nine nine help 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:04.400
 I stay myself silly and fun 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:11.610
 experience a bit of the live 100 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:13.830
 into it and he just came yahoo 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:16.170
 would have won now and I'm one 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:18.750
 In the second place I am really good 

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:19.710
 actually a really good place three 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.420
 we have become 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.710
 I wanted to once a round long 

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:24.690
 rather make the organ short follow 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.620
 but today I'm allowed a round 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:27.060
 if you want to see more that my 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:29.490
 thumb upwards because I actually know 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.660
 funny actually in the end has two 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.130
 I was born here, I think 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:35.100
 well hopefully i think it was space 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:38.060
 Having seen two correctly as well 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:38.060
 nothing more does it well
