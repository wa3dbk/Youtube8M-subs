00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.010 

so<00:00:00.599> this<00:00:00.750> is<00:00:00.780> my<00:00:00.900> su-37<00:00:01.800> of<00:00:02.399> the<00:00:03.240> ailerons<00:00:03.810> the

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
so this is my su-37 of the ailerons the

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.230 
so this is my su-37 of the ailerons the
canards<00:00:04.620> and<00:00:04.980> the<00:00:05.220> elevator<00:00:05.640> they<00:00:05.879> all<00:00:05.910> work

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
canards and the elevator they all work

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.810 
canards and the elevator they all work
together<00:00:06.450> for<00:00:06.839> pitch<00:00:07.080> and<00:00:07.639> elevator<00:00:08.639> has

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
together for pitch and elevator has

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.360 
together for pitch and elevator has
thrust<00:00:09.090> vectoring<00:00:09.480> the<00:00:09.780> ailerons<00:00:10.440> work<00:00:10.800> by

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
thrust vectoring the ailerons work by

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.060 
thrust vectoring the ailerons work by
themselves<00:00:11.519> for<00:00:12.389> role<00:00:12.809> and<00:00:13.080> the<00:00:13.110> rudder<00:00:13.769> is

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
themselves for role and the rudder is

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.849 
themselves for role and the rudder is
its<00:00:14.309> own<00:00:14.400> little<00:00:14.429> thing<00:00:14.700> and<00:00:15.000> it<00:00:15.120> has<00:00:15.269> a<00:00:15.299> gyro

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:15.859 
its own little thing and it has a gyro

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:19.910 
its own little thing and it has a gyro
so<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:17.010> motor<00:00:17.220> is<00:00:17.430> a<00:00:17.460> 22<00:00:17.850> 1206<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:19.170> old<00:00:19.529> kind

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
so the motor is a 22 1206 the old kind

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.660 
so the motor is a 22 1206 the old kind
and<00:00:20.310> it's<00:00:20.820> got<00:00:21.000> a<00:00:21.029> KF<00:00:21.480> for<00:00:21.930> airfoil<00:00:22.680> it's<00:00:23.430> got<00:00:23.640> a

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
and it's got a KF for airfoil it's got a

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.960 
and it's got a KF for airfoil it's got a
2200<00:00:24.539> milliamp<00:00:25.019> 3-cell<00:00:25.680> battery<00:00:25.710> and<00:00:26.279> this<00:00:26.789> is

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
2200 milliamp 3-cell battery and this is

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.900 
2200 milliamp 3-cell battery and this is
the<00:00:27.090> maiden<00:00:27.420> flight<00:00:28.130> ok<00:00:29.130> I<00:00:29.160> got<00:00:29.189> it<00:00:29.369> so<00:00:29.640> this<00:00:29.789> is

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
the maiden flight ok I got it so this is

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.150 
the maiden flight ok I got it so this is
kind<00:00:30.150> of<00:00:30.240> high<00:00:30.390> alpha<00:00:30.570> ish<00:00:30.869> do<00:00:31.560> it<00:00:31.679> better<00:00:31.890> if<00:00:32.070> I

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
kind of high alpha ish do it better if I

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.819 
kind of high alpha ish do it better if I
had<00:00:32.369> more<00:00:32.730> gyros<00:00:33.300> I<00:00:33.719> want<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.260> put<00:00:34.380> a<00:00:34.410> gyro<00:00:34.649> on

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
had more gyros I want to put a gyro on

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.590 
had more gyros I want to put a gyro on
the<00:00:34.950> pitch<00:00:35.190> not<00:00:35.489> not<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.790> elevator<00:00:36.210> just<00:00:36.329> the

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
the pitch not not the elevator just the

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.240 
the pitch not not the elevator just the
canards<00:00:37.020> and<00:00:37.230> then<00:00:37.680> i'll<00:00:37.800> see<00:00:37.950> you<00:00:38.010> about<00:00:38.070> the

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
canards and then i'll see you about the

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:52.080 
canards and then i'll see you about the
ailerons

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:52.090 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:01:08.880 

whoa

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.770 

so<00:01:09.890> right<00:01:10.040> here<00:01:10.250> the<00:01:10.490> ailerons<00:01:11.060> got<00:01:11.299> stuck<00:01:11.630> up

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
so right here the ailerons got stuck up

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.270 
so right here the ailerons got stuck up
like<00:01:11.960> spoiler<00:01:12.409> ons<00:01:12.619> and<00:01:12.860> I<00:01:12.890> don't<00:01:13.009> know<00:01:13.100> why

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
like spoiler ons and I don't know why

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.740 
like spoiler ons and I don't know why
but<00:01:13.310> they<00:01:13.520> were<00:01:13.610> stuck<00:01:13.909> like<00:01:14.060> that<00:01:14.119> so<00:01:14.479> I<00:01:14.509> had

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
but they were stuck like that so I had

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:31.860 
but they were stuck like that so I had
to<00:01:14.780> make<00:01:14.990> an<00:01:15.110> emergency<00:01:15.170> landing

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:31.870 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:33.790 

so<00:01:32.870> right<00:01:33.050> here<00:01:33.080> it<00:01:33.350> was<00:01:33.440> just<00:01:33.620> kind<00:01:33.770> of

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:33.800 
so right here it was just kind of

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.620 
so right here it was just kind of
falling<00:01:34.190> straight<00:01:34.520> down<00:01:34.580> it<00:01:35.030> wasn't<00:01:35.420> going

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
falling straight down it wasn't going

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.030 
falling straight down it wasn't going
forward<00:01:36.050> at<00:01:36.170> all<00:01:36.260> it<00:01:36.470> kind<00:01:36.650> of<00:01:36.680> looks<00:01:36.830> like<00:01:36.860> it

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
forward at all it kind of looks like it

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.770 
forward at all it kind of looks like it
but<00:01:37.130> it<00:01:37.250> wasn't<00:01:37.550> it<00:01:38.030> was<00:01:38.210> just<00:01:38.330> like<00:01:38.450> flat

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
but it wasn't it was just like flat

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.780 
but it wasn't it was just like flat
falling<00:01:39.320> right<00:01:40.070> here<00:01:40.250> it<00:01:40.340> was<00:01:40.430> kind<00:01:40.610> of<00:01:40.640> going

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
falling right here it was kind of going

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.640 
falling right here it was kind of going
like<00:01:41.090> nose<00:01:41.630> first<00:01:41.960> a<00:01:42.140> little<00:01:42.380> bit<00:01:42.470> so<00:01:42.560> I'm

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:42.650 
like nose first a little bit so I'm

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:44.440 
like nose first a little bit so I'm
gonna<00:01:42.740> put<00:01:42.890> a<00:01:42.950> gyro<00:01:43.280> on<00:01:43.610> the<00:01:43.729> cards<00:01:44.150> to<00:01:44.300> maybe

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
gonna put a gyro on the cards to maybe

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.240 
gonna put a gyro on the cards to maybe
help<00:01:44.630> for<00:01:44.840> that<00:01:44.960> but<00:01:45.080> that's<00:01:45.200> pretty<00:01:45.350> cool<00:01:45.620> the

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
help for that but that's pretty cool the

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.160 
help for that but that's pretty cool the
KF<00:01:46.610> airfoil<00:01:47.060> keeps<00:01:47.390> it<00:01:47.540> from<00:01:47.630> stalling<00:01:47.900> out

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
KF airfoil keeps it from stalling out

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:49.870 
KF airfoil keeps it from stalling out
it's<00:01:48.619> pretty<00:01:48.830> it<00:01:49.100> just<00:01:49.250> falls<00:01:49.490> straight<00:01:49.820> down

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
it's pretty it just falls straight down

00:01:49.880 --> 00:02:04.059 
it's pretty it just falls straight down
it's<00:01:50.180> awesome

00:02:04.059 --> 00:02:04.069 

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:13.390 

Wow

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.890 

for<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.490> landings<00:02:14.940> I<00:02:15.090> think<00:02:15.300> I<00:02:15.360> need<00:02:15.540> a<00:02:15.570> flare

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
for the landings I think I need a flare

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.040 
for the landings I think I need a flare
late<00:02:16.200> or<00:02:16.530> later<00:02:17.490> I'm<00:02:17.730> flaring<00:02:18.240> too<00:02:18.480> soon<00:02:18.810> and

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
late or later I'm flaring too soon and

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.570 
late or later I'm flaring too soon and
its<00:02:19.170> kind<00:02:19.350> of<00:02:19.380> falling<00:02:19.650> out<00:02:19.890> of<00:02:19.920> the<00:02:20.040> sky<00:02:20.070> and

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
its kind of falling out of the sky and

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.180 
its kind of falling out of the sky and
hung<00:02:21.390> hang<00:02:21.600> the<00:02:21.780> elevator<00:02:22.170> and<00:02:22.440> stuff<00:02:22.710> it<00:02:22.980> does

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
hung hang the elevator and stuff it does

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.350 
hung hang the elevator and stuff it does
that<00:02:23.430> a<00:02:23.460> lot<00:02:23.550> on<00:02:23.940> this<00:02:24.150> landing<00:02:26.000> so<00:02:27.000> that's<00:02:27.180> it

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
that a lot on this landing so that's it

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.900 
that a lot on this landing so that's it
for<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:27.630> su-37<00:02:28.530> that<00:02:29.010> day<00:02:29.220> I'll<00:02:29.370> be<00:02:29.400> flying<00:02:29.610> it

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
for the su-37 that day I'll be flying it

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.540 
for the su-37 that day I'll be flying it
more<00:02:30.240> later<00:02:30.840> on<00:02:30.930> here's<00:02:31.740> some<00:02:31.950> video<00:02:32.220> footage

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
more later on here's some video footage

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.090 
more later on here's some video footage
from<00:02:32.940> my<00:02:33.150> Super<00:02:33.630> Cub<00:02:33.810> dropping<00:02:34.680> a<00:02:34.770> bomb<00:02:34.950> with

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
from my Super Cub dropping a bomb with

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.560 
from my Super Cub dropping a bomb with
the<00:02:35.220> onboard<00:02:35.610> cam<00:02:35.820> you<00:02:36.030> can<00:02:36.180> see<00:02:36.300> the<00:02:36.420> bomb

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
the onboard cam you can see the bomb

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.110 
the onboard cam you can see the bomb
falling<00:02:36.870> right<00:02:37.200> here<00:02:37.560> in<00:02:37.650> slow<00:02:37.920> motion<00:02:38.160> so

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
falling right here in slow motion so

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.230 
falling right here in slow motion so
that<00:02:39.510> went<00:02:39.720> good<00:02:39.930> those<00:02:40.200> with<00:02:40.350> my<00:02:40.470> Super<00:02:40.830> Cub

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.240 
that went good those with my Super Cub

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:51.070 
that went good those with my Super Cub
here's<00:02:42.240> some<00:02:42.390> more<00:02:42.540> of<00:02:42.720> that<00:02:42.750> footage

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:03:01.470 

you

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.320 

so<00:03:02.080> that's<00:03:02.260> it<00:03:02.440> thanks<00:03:02.890> for<00:03:02.920> watching
