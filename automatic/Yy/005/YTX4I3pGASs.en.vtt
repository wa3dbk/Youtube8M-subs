00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.200
 a new hair routine so he 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.930
 is a rescue routine 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.980
 capillaries as you can see 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.840
 in the title of the video everything 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.590
 just if you follow me on the 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.390
 social networks 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.279
 you know that these days I tested 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.930
 a range of hair that has me 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.610
 completely screwed up the hair I 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:36.269
 had never had hair so dry 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.979
 also breaking also also union of all 

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:39.659
 my life it was like a wall finally at 

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:42.750
 touch it's a mixture of water from the 

00:00:39.659 --> 00:00:44.519
 straw and the trick towards the bridges I'm going 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.040
 to be there to scrape the utensils of 

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:47.720
 kitchen for toilets there so it's you 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.460
 say 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.229
 finally good so it really had to 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.780
 I make a routine of attacks for 

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:56.670
 really rehydrate my hair the 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.769
 feed them again and take care of them 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.909
 all because it was just 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:02.129
 catastrophic 

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:03.839
 so if you are in this case there 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.510

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:08.190
 who did not succeed us simply 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.810
 but when you have hyper hair 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.880
 dry that you have brittle hair 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.369
 that you have weakened hair or 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.789
 sensitized and where this routine will be 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.500
