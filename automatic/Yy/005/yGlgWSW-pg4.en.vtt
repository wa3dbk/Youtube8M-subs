so<00:02:12.940> that<00:02:13.870> was<00:02:14.020> fairly<00:02:14.230> easy<00:02:14.410> and<00:02:14.950> you<00:02:15.130> said<00:02:15.400> as

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
so that was fairly easy and you said as

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.300 
so that was fairly easy and you said as
you<00:02:15.670> see<00:02:16.120> the<00:02:16.390> hook<00:02:16.630> part<00:02:16.990> right<00:02:17.800> here<00:02:17.830> is

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
you see the hook part right here is

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.560 
you see the hook part right here is
basically<00:02:18.580> at<00:02:18.970> the<00:02:19.120> top<00:02:19.390> of<00:02:19.420> the<00:02:21.150> the<00:02:22.150> ribbon

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
basically at the top of the the ribbon

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:25.470 
basically at the top of the the ribbon
the<00:02:23.020> breast<00:02:23.260> cancer<00:02:23.350> ribbon<00:02:24.090> and<00:02:25.090> it's<00:02:25.270> fairly

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
the breast cancer ribbon and it's fairly

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.360 
the breast cancer ribbon and it's fairly
easy<00:02:25.660> if<00:02:26.230> you<00:02:26.410> know<00:02:26.440> how<00:02:26.710> to<00:02:26.740> do<00:02:27.130> this

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
easy if you know how to do this

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.490 
easy if you know how to do this
particular<00:02:27.820> weaving<00:02:28.420> but<00:02:28.870> I<00:02:28.900> don't<00:02:28.990> know<00:02:29.380> how

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500

particular weaving but I don't know how
to<00:02:29.560> do<00:02:29.770> it<00:02:29.920> so<00:02:29.950> i<00:02:30.100> get<00:02:30.310> my<00:02:30.400> daughter's<00:02:30.760> to<00:02:30.880> do<00:02:31.000> it

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
to do it so i get my daughter's to do it

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.200 
to do it so i get my daughter's to do it
and<00:02:31.390> once<00:02:32.380> they<00:02:32.560> do<00:02:32.620> it<00:02:32.860> i<00:02:32.950> create<00:02:33.430> different

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
and once they do it i create different

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:37.970 
and once they do it i create different
stuff<00:02:34.450> from<00:02:34.720> it<00:02:35.250> but<00:02:36.250> again<00:02:36.640> and<00:02:36.850> this<00:02:37.030> is<00:02:37.240> the

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
stuff from it but again and this is the

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.620 
stuff from it but again and this is the
gloss<00:02:38.980> that<00:02:39.010> i<00:02:39.340> put<00:02:39.610> i<00:02:39.760> use<00:02:39.970> the<00:02:40.120> trip<00:02:40.330> of<00:02:40.450> thick

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
gloss and it's real thick so you have to

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.690 
gloss and it's real thick so you have to
be<00:02:42.940> careful<00:02:43.260> and<00:02:44.260> now<00:02:44.890> what<00:02:45.190> I'm<00:02:45.220> going<00:02:45.460> to<00:02:45.520> do

I'm going to put the backs on these and

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.280 
I'm going to put the backs on these and
it's<00:02:48.100> something<00:02:48.460> like<00:02:48.490> this<00:02:48.850> is<00:02:49.060> just<00:02:49.090> a<00:02:49.420> piece

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290
