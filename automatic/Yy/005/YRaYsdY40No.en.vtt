out what I'm gonna the text that I'm
going<00:00:32.689> to<00:00:32.719> use

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:36.430 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.530 

all<00:00:37.430> right<00:00:37.579> put<00:00:37.760> it<00:00:37.790> to<00:00:37.910> the<00:00:37.970> center<00:00:38.210> of<00:00:38.329> the

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540 
all right put it to the center of the

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:45.400 
all right put it to the center of the
frame<00:00:42.100> okay<00:00:43.930> scale<00:00:44.930> it<00:00:45.020> down<00:00:45.050> just<00:00:45.350> a<00:00:45.379> little

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
frame okay scale it down just a little

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:51.710 
frame okay scale it down just a little
bit

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:51.720 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.710

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:53.720 
I so first we're gonna put a bevel on

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.460 
I so first we're gonna put a bevel on
textures<00:00:54.720> to<00:00:54.810> make<00:00:54.960> it<00:00:55.050> look<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.230> little<00:00:55.320> more

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:55.470 
textures to make it look a little more

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.770 
textures to make it look a little more
3d<00:00:55.590> like<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:57.150> get<00:00:57.330> make<00:00:57.480> it<00:00:57.600> look<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:57.720> little

3d like and get make it look a little

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.210 
3d like and get make it look a little
cooler<00:00:58.250> great<00:00:59.250> as<00:00:59.340> high<00:00:59.460> as<00:00:59.520> it<00:00:59.670> goes<00:01:01.070> it<00:01:02.070> looks

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:02.220 
cooler great as high as it goes it looks

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:10.070 
cooler great as high as it goes it looks
good<00:01:07.130> my<00:01:08.130> new<00:01:08.400> letter<00:01:08.640> I'm<00:01:09.600> gonna<00:01:09.750> use<00:01:09.930> this

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
good my new letter I'm gonna use this

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.320 
good my new letter I'm gonna use this
for<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.410> fractal<00:01:10.860> noise<00:01:11.060> that's<00:01:12.060> what<00:01:12.180> goes

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
for the fractal noise that's what goes

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.740 
for the fractal noise that's what goes
in<00:01:12.480> the<00:01:12.540> bottom<00:01:12.870> of<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.170> letters<00:01:13.530> you'll<00:01:13.830> see

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
in the bottom of the letters you'll see

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.630 
in the bottom of the letters you'll see
put<00:01:15.750> it<00:01:15.810> on<00:01:15.900> rocky<00:01:16.320> that's<00:01:16.560> what<00:01:16.740> makes<00:01:16.890> that

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
put it on rocky that's what makes that

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.280 
put it on rocky that's what makes that
very<00:01:17.670> nice<00:01:18.060> texture<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:18.870> it

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
very nice texture to it

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.500 
very nice texture to it
crazy<00:01:19.920> contrast<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:20.550> little<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.970> little<00:01:21.330> bit

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:21.510 
crazy contrast a little a little bit

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.469 
crazy contrast a little a little bit
bite<00:01:21.750> in<00:01:21.840> this<00:01:21.930> little<00:01:23.390> complexity<00:01:24.390> is<00:01:24.450> not

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
bite in this little complexity is not

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.820 
bite in this little complexity is not
that<00:01:24.750> important<00:01:25.110> here<00:01:27.530> alright<00:01:28.530> now<00:01:28.680> we'll

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:28.830 
that important here alright now we'll

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:29.930 
that important here alright now we'll
create<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:29.040> new<00:01:29.070> layer<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.460> put<00:01:29.580> on<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.760> bottom

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
create a new layer and put on the bottom

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.310 
create a new layer and put on the bottom
so<00:01:30.869> that<00:01:31.020> when<00:01:31.170> you<00:01:31.260> do<00:01:32.210> multiply<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.990> it'll

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
so that when you do multiply and it'll

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:40.460 
so that when you do multiply and it'll
only<00:01:34.440> go<00:01:34.770> over<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.160> text<00:01:36.890> there<00:01:37.890> you<00:01:37.950> go<00:01:39.470> now

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
only go over the text there you go now

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.930 
only go over the text there you go now
with<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.680> mask<00:01:40.890> layer<00:01:41.220> so<00:01:41.520> we're<00:01:41.640> only<00:01:41.759> on<00:01:41.880> the

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 
with the mask layer so we're only on the

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:47.330 
with the mask layer so we're only on the
bottom<00:01:42.090> of<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.330> test<00:01:45.950> put<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:46.979> little<00:01:47.100> feather

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
bottom of the test put a little feather

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.330 
bottom of the test put a little feather
on

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:58.539 

I<00:01:52.720> mean<00:01:53.720> that<00:01:53.840> was<00:01:53.990> okay<00:01:56.170> continue<00:01:57.340> make<00:01:58.340> a<00:01:58.369> new

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:58.549 
I mean that was okay continue make a new

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:00.310 
I mean that was okay continue make a new
layer<00:01:58.700> for<00:01:59.060> our<00:01:59.119> beam<00:01:59.570> now<00:01:59.840> that's<00:02:00.049> what<00:02:00.140> we<00:02:00.200> do

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
layer for our beam now that's what we do

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.320 
layer for our beam now that's what we do
next

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
next

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:09.109 
next
look<00:02:02.330> at<00:02:02.450> the<00:02:02.540> beam<00:02:02.690> effect

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.559 

personally<00:02:09.899> full-length<00:02:11.150> change<00:02:12.150> started

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
personally full-length change started

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.140 
personally full-length change started
thickness<00:02:12.900> to<00:02:13.140> I<00:02:13.349> get<00:02:14.040> nice<00:02:14.280> and<00:02:14.310> big<00:02:14.610> any

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
thickness to I get nice and big any

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.140 
thickness to I get nice and big any
thickness<00:02:15.480> moved<00:02:15.750> to<00:02:15.870> zero<00:02:16.580> so<00:02:17.580> it<00:02:17.670> trails<00:02:18.030> off

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
thickness moved to zero so it trails off

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.580 
thickness moved to zero so it trails off
nicely<00:02:20.450> the<00:02:21.450> insides<00:02:21.780> white<00:02:22.050> so<00:02:22.349> it's<00:02:22.440> very

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
nicely the insides white so it's very

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.490 
nicely the insides white so it's very
nice<00:02:22.950> and<00:02:23.099> bright<00:02:23.310> at<00:02:23.730> that<00:02:23.910> polite<00:02:24.150> didn't

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
nice and bright at that polite didn't

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:32.589 
nice and bright at that polite didn't
pick<00:02:25.500> a<00:02:25.590> bluish

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:32.599 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:34.580 

starting<00:02:33.599> place<00:02:33.750> not<00:02:33.930> that<00:02:33.959> important<00:02:34.500> cuz

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
starting place not that important cuz

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.220 
starting place not that important cuz
we're<00:02:34.709> gonna<00:02:34.800> just<00:02:35.040> that<00:02:35.190> later<00:02:35.400> but<00:02:36.080> just<00:02:37.080> get

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
we're gonna just that later but just get

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.040 
we're gonna just that later but just get
around<00:02:37.650> what<00:02:37.830> we<00:02:37.920> want<00:02:38.099> it<00:02:38.160> to<00:02:38.190> be<00:02:38.400> and<00:02:39.050> we're

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
around what we want it to be and we're

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.090 
around what we want it to be and we're
gonna<00:02:40.200> change<00:02:40.380> that<00:02:40.560> so<00:02:40.739> they're<00:02:40.860> the<00:02:40.920> same

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
gonna change that so they're the same

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.090 
gonna change that so they're the same
height<00:02:41.310> at<00:02:41.430> the<00:02:41.489> starting<00:02:41.819> in<00:02:41.940> the<00:02:42.000> under<00:02:43.100> move

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
height at the starting in the under move

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.500

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
just gonna cover up the entire layer

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.360 
just gonna cover up the entire layer
with<00:02:57.450> that<00:02:57.569> new<00:02:57.780> beam<00:02:57.989> this<00:02:58.830> way<00:02:58.980> we<00:02:59.099> see<00:02:59.220> both

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
with that new beam this way we see both

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.180 
with that new beam this way we see both
beams<00:03:00.200> alright<00:03:01.200> that<00:03:01.349> looks<00:03:01.380> pretty<00:03:01.500> good

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
alright now we're gonna make a new layer

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.089 
alright now we're gonna make a new layer
it's<00:03:06.239> for<00:03:06.420> our<00:03:07.549> brushing<00:03:09.799> we're<00:03:10.799> gonna<00:03:10.920> brush

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.099 
it's for our brushing we're gonna brush

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:12.979 
it's for our brushing we're gonna brush
it<00:03:11.160> on<00:03:11.310> a<00:03:11.340> little<00:03:11.580> star<00:03:12.000> to<00:03:12.599> put<00:03:12.690> right<00:03:12.810> in<00:03:12.930> the

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
it on a little star to put right in the

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.550 
it on a little star to put right in the
middle<00:03:13.170> there<00:03:13.380> so<00:03:13.410> it<00:03:13.650> looks<00:03:13.799> a<00:03:13.859> little<00:03:13.950> nicer

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
middle there so it looks a little nicer

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:20.390 
middle there so it looks a little nicer
bring<00:03:16.560> up<00:03:16.650> that<00:03:16.799> brushing<00:03:17.130> channel<00:03:17.519> I<00:03:19.400> bring

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
bring up that brushing channel I bring

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.020 
bring up that brushing channel I bring
down<00:03:20.489> the<00:03:20.549> diameter<00:03:21.380> everything<00:03:22.380> else<00:03:22.530> to

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
down the diameter everything else to

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.330 
down the diameter everything else to
regular<00:03:24.829> doesn't<00:03:25.829> really<00:03:25.950> matter<00:03:26.130> where<00:03:26.310> I

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
regular doesn't really matter where I

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.699 
regular doesn't really matter where I
put<00:03:26.400> it<00:03:26.640> right<00:03:26.730> back<00:03:26.910> so<00:03:26.970> I<00:03:27.120> move<00:03:27.420> it

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
put it right back so I move it

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.429 
put it right back so I move it
now<00:03:29.340> we're<00:03:29.489> going<00:03:29.579> to<00:03:29.670> add<00:03:29.849> the<00:03:30.030> little<00:03:30.439> lines

00:03:31.429 --> 00:03:31.439 
now we're going to add the little lines

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:33.970 
now we're going to add the little lines
and<00:03:31.680> they<00:03:31.829> make<00:03:31.980> it<00:03:32.040> looking<00:03:32.280> like<00:03:32.310> a<00:03:32.489> star

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
and they make it looking like a star

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.830 
and they make it looking like a star
it's<00:03:34.980> the<00:03:35.099> one<00:03:35.280> there

it's the one there

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.209 
it's the one there
then<00:03:36.840> we'll<00:03:36.959> change<00:03:37.109> it<00:03:37.319> to<00:03:37.439> 90<00:03:37.829> degrees<00:03:38.189> and

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:38.219 
then we'll change it to 90 degrees and

00:03:38.219 --> 00:03:40.899 
then we'll change it to 90 degrees and
add<00:03:39.150> another<00:03:39.450> one

00:03:40.899 --> 00:03:40.909

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:19.340 
just far still friend but now we have to

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.460 
just far still friend but now we have to
make<00:05:19.460> a<00:05:19.490> little<00:05:19.759> animation<00:05:20.139> so<00:05:21.139> that's<00:05:21.319> coming

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:21.470 
make a little animation so that's coming

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:22.960 
make a little animation so that's coming
next<00:05:21.560> and<00:05:22.220> I'm<00:05:22.340> gonna<00:05:22.430> do<00:05:22.580> that<00:05:22.669> using<00:05:22.849> a

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:22.970 
next and I'm gonna do that using a

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:25.360 
next and I'm gonna do that using a
camera<00:05:23.419> and<00:05:24.379> we're<00:05:24.500> gonna<00:05:24.620> move<00:05:24.860> the<00:05:25.069> camera

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.370 
camera and we're gonna move the camera

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:27.820 
camera and we're gonna move the camera
closer<00:05:25.580> and<00:05:26.000> that<00:05:26.509> way<00:05:26.720> it's<00:05:27.199> gonna<00:05:27.349> move<00:05:27.560> a

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:27.830 
closer and that way it's gonna move a

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:29.379 
closer and that way it's gonna move a
little<00:05:28.220> bit<00:05:28.340> in<00:05:28.400> perspective<00:05:28.610> you<00:05:29.120> might<00:05:29.240> not

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:29.389 
little bit in perspective you might not

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:31.629 
little bit in perspective you might not
notice<00:05:29.569> it<00:05:29.840> but<00:05:30.590> your<00:05:30.949> eyes<00:05:31.099> notice<00:05:31.490> it<00:05:31.610> even

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:31.639 
notice it but your eyes notice it even

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:34.390 
notice it but your eyes notice it even
if<00:05:31.909> you<00:05:32.030> don't<00:05:32.150> consciously<00:05:32.630> see<00:05:33.169> it<00:05:33.400> you'll

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.400 
if you don't consciously see it you'll

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.580 
if you don't consciously see it you'll
see<00:05:34.550> what<00:05:34.669> I<00:05:34.699> mean<00:05:35.050> so<00:05:36.050> we'll<00:05:36.169> start<00:05:36.380> with<00:05:36.470> a

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:36.590 
see what I mean so we'll start with a

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:39.460 
see what I mean so we'll start with a
keyframe<00:05:37.310> over<00:05:37.550> there<00:05:37.699> and<00:05:38.139> then<00:05:39.139> we'll<00:05:39.289> try

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:39.470 
keyframe over there and then we'll try

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:41.110 
keyframe over there and then we'll try
well<00:05:39.919> that's<00:05:40.099> not<00:05:40.250> zooming<00:05:40.550> yeah<00:05:40.759> we<00:05:40.909> have<00:05:41.000> to

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.120 
well that's not zooming yeah we have to

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.839 
well that's not zooming yeah we have to
add<00:05:41.330> 3d<00:05:41.870> to<00:05:42.139> the<00:05:42.919> time<00:05:43.220> will<00:05:43.370> come<00:05:43.520> later<00:05:43.729> and

00:05:43.839 --> 00:05:43.849 
add 3d to the time will come later and

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:45.820 
add 3d to the time will come later and
also<00:05:43.940> to<00:05:44.090> the<00:05:44.150> fractal<00:05:44.630> noise<00:05:45.229> layer<00:05:45.560> so<00:05:45.740> that

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:45.830 
also to the fractal noise layer so that

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:46.480 
also to the fractal noise layer so that
they<00:05:45.949> move<00:05:46.099> together

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:46.490 
they move together

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:49.390 
they move together
there<00:05:46.940> that's<00:05:47.150> better<00:05:47.210> and<00:05:47.949> of<00:05:48.949> course<00:05:49.159> the

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:49.400 
there that's better and of course the

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.520 
there that's better and of course the
the<00:05:49.699> lens<00:05:49.940> flare<00:05:50.210> and<00:05:50.240> the<00:05:50.419> beam<00:05:50.630> still<00:05:51.050> are<00:05:51.319> in

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:51.530 
the lens flare and the beam still are in

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:52.930 
the lens flare and the beam still are in
the<00:05:51.560> same<00:05:51.770> is<00:05:51.889> application<00:05:52.310> so<00:05:52.669> we'll<00:05:52.819> move

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:52.940 
the same is application so we'll move

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:56.800 
the same is application so we'll move
those<00:05:53.150> next<00:05:53.680> that<00:05:54.680> was<00:05:54.770> pretty<00:05:54.949> good<00:05:55.810> let's

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:56.810 
those next that was pretty good let's

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:59.909 
those next that was pretty good let's
move<00:05:56.900> the<00:05:57.050> beam<00:05:57.199> in<00:05:57.409> effect<00:05:58.219> the<00:05:58.400> lens<00:05:58.879> flare

00:05:59.909 --> 00:05:59.919 
move the beam in effect the lens flare

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:03.070 
move the beam in effect the lens flare
the<00:06:00.919> lastly<00:06:01.250> we're<00:06:01.370> gonna<00:06:01.460> move<00:06:01.639> by<00:06:02.080> the

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:03.080 
the lastly we're gonna move by the

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.719 
the lastly we're gonna move by the
effect<00:06:03.469> moving<00:06:03.830> at<00:06:03.979> the<00:06:04.159> center<00:06:04.610> location

00:06:04.719 --> 00:06:04.729 
effect moving at the center location

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:07.570 
effect moving at the center location
these<00:06:05.719> were<00:06:05.930> just<00:06:06.020> gonna<00:06:06.199> move<00:06:06.919> them<00:06:07.130> up<00:06:07.250> a

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:07.580 
these were just gonna move them up a

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.200 
these were just gonna move them up a
little<00:06:08.060> bit

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:10.210 
little bit

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:12.060 
little bit
yes<00:06:10.870> I'm<00:06:11.080> moving<00:06:11.350> up<00:06:11.380> with<00:06:11.530> my<00:06:11.650> mouse<00:06:11.860> right

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:12.070 
yes I'm moving up with my mouse right

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:15.950 
yes I'm moving up with my mouse right
now<00:06:12.250> with<00:06:12.460> up<00:06:12.640> and<00:06:12.880> up<00:06:13.300> and<00:06:13.510> down<00:06:13.630> arrow<00:06:13.870> keys

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:15.960 
now with up and up and down arrow keys

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:20.260 
now with up and up and down arrow keys
yeah<00:06:16.960> that<00:06:17.110> was<00:06:17.200> pretty<00:06:17.350> good

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:20.270 

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:24.490 

I<00:06:20.860> just<00:06:21.860> zoomed<00:06:22.039> in<00:06:22.190> there<00:06:22.370> with<00:06:22.490> command+<00:06:23.500> I'm

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:24.500 
I just zoomed in there with command+ I'm

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.610 
I just zoomed in there with command+ I'm
swell<00:06:24.860> just<00:06:25.280> see<00:06:25.729> what<00:06:25.819> it<00:06:25.880> looks<00:06:26.030> like<00:06:26.620> all

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:27.620

swell just see what it looks like all
right<00:06:27.740> now<00:06:27.860> the<00:06:27.919> center<00:06:28.370> of<00:06:28.430> the<00:06:28.550> position<00:06:29.270> of

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:29.360 
right now the center of the position of

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.480 
right now the center of the position of
the<00:06:29.539> lunch<00:06:30.349> player<00:06:30.560> you<00:06:31.099> have<00:06:31.130> to<00:06:31.220> animate

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:31.490 
the lunch player you have to animate

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:36.460 
the lunch player you have to animate
that<00:06:31.699> to<00:06:34.720> doesn't<00:06:35.720> move<00:06:35.840> that<00:06:35.960> position<00:06:36.289> up<00:06:36.380> a

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:36.470 
that to doesn't move that position up a

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:46.320 
that to doesn't move that position up a
little<00:06:36.620> bit<00:06:36.830> a<00:06:37.479> little<00:06:38.479> spot<00:06:38.840> right

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:46.330 

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:49.020

all right so that's pretty good so
that's<00:06:49.120> how<00:06:49.300> I<00:06:49.330> made<00:06:49.509> the<00:06:49.780> the<00:06:50.530> text<00:06:50.860> for<00:06:51.099> the

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:51.430 
that's how I made the the text for the

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:53.580 
that's how I made the the text for the
trailer<00:06:51.699> and<00:06:52.319> hopefully<00:06:53.319> you<00:06:53.409> like<00:06:53.560> it

trailer and hopefully you like it
hopefully<00:06:54.039> from<00:06:54.280> a<00:06:54.400> scene<00:06:54.550> like<00:06:54.729> this<00:06:54.819> on<00:06:54.970> your

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:55.090 
hopefully from a scene like this on your

00:06:55.090 --> 00:07:01.290 
hopefully from a scene like this on your
own<00:06:57.300> just<00:06:58.300> not<00:06:58.840> just<00:06:58.990> proper<00:07:00.180> remember<00:07:01.180> all

00:07:02.969 --> 00:07:02.979 
the name all your layers that's

00:07:02.979 --> 00:07:05.279 
the name all your layers that's
important<00:07:03.629> so<00:07:04.629> when<00:07:04.720> you<00:07:04.810> come<00:07:04.930> back<00:07:04.960> to<00:07:05.259> it
