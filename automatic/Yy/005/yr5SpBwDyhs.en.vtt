comes<00:01:43.890> up<00:01:44.130> about<00:01:44.430> you<00:01:44.759> know<00:01:44.990> about<00:01:45.990> 50<00:01:46.470> percent

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
comes up about you know about 50 percent

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.219 
comes up about you know about 50 percent
of<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:46.950> way<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.430> top<00:01:47.670> so<00:01:48.079> some<00:01:49.079> of<00:01:49.170> the

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
of the way to the top so some of the

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.630 
of the way to the top so some of the
heat<00:01:49.409> will<00:01:49.530> go<00:01:49.649> back<00:01:49.860> forth<00:01:50.130> but<00:01:50.310> for<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.520> most

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
heat will go back forth but for the most

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.480 
heat will go back forth but for the most
part<00:01:50.729> is<00:01:51.090> you<00:01:51.810> can<00:01:51.960> have<00:01:52.110> two<00:01:52.350> different
