00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:25.069
 so will 

00:00:25.069 --> 00:00:27.489
 So the second attempt on this topic 

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:31.119
 and the question you have to ask yourself what actually happens when you look down 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:34.610
 several discs and several wreaths with each other is just three 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.420
 the magnet does it 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.420
 after being disconnected by the momentum 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.570
 Indian law resistance 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.710
 the decision 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.800
 Wagner Phone 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.690
 in front of the disc is not right behind the disc 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.690
 while I write again 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.300
 can make these statements 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.620
 and the magnet is not pulled and not pressed in a given 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:05.820
 position 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.820
 Furry do not compare on the other side exactly the other way round 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.230
 e on and with the wrong sound to the disc stands 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:14.530
 that before the divorce 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.040
 in the course of the same as the boll team Kranzes is thus also a product 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:18.890
 had 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.210
 a lot is in trouble 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.130
 to align with this crowd 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.040
 that is, calling him from one side to the other have 180 degrees 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.110
 that means that you have the apparent resistance 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.470
 who do not have not after the divorce 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.990
 still the question is that today I try to answer this by asking this 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.550
 Experiment made 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.620
 as already criticized 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.140
 "Now I want to 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.160
 put the next slice of countries 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.630
 in the class are quasi with the acceleration through the next 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:54.820
 write songs 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.130
 what can bridge into this resistance then 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.130
 Say that high for the function 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.770
 he can do that too 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:22.590
 but now the question is how does the whole leg behind behave again 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:23.609
 Squad stands 

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:26.409
 the director in Cannes 

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:29.569
 it will be easy 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:32.859
 theoretically, debate should now be accelerated more 

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:36.449
 that certainly this raises this quorum again and again 

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:41.189
 that seems to make us 

00:02:45.499 --> 00:02:48.499
 and that is indeed the case 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:54.739
 assuming I am lucky that they are windy 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:01.019
 So you see the magnet shoots target further forward 

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:04.589
 when he does it with a divorce initially 

00:03:18.899 --> 00:03:20.929
 after the first acceleration 

00:03:20.929 --> 00:03:24.629
 the magnet can easily move into the second disc opposite the 

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:28.019
 Resistance to come in and is accelerated again 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:31.259
 So you could speculate that you could expand this system like 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:36.429
 in a jungle for example and here never moves a high 

00:03:36.429 --> 00:03:38.399
 that 7 2 he had 

00:03:38.399 --> 00:03:40.699
 Acceleration has horror 

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:44.179
 Wehking no way back and the whole thing is connected to a constituency 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:48.439
 The magnet always moves because of me 

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:51.439
 while he is on the invitation gullet 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:56.170
 then virtually the raw water wanders and then on the lists straight again 

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:58.999
 accelerated and so on 

00:03:58.999 --> 00:04:02.559
 So it would be a closed system that runs completely autonomous 

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:12.029
 at least confirm that tries 

00:04:12.029 --> 00:04:14.649
 what you can see here 

00:04:14.649 --> 00:04:17.649
 the criticism of the 4 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:21.529
 you see b 

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:24.099
 her husband remained significantly rising 1 

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:27.099
 if you offered the whole thing with a wreath 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.370
 with the second place 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.370
 it looks very different 

00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:08.359
 so much for it
