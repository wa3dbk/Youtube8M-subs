00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:05.290
 and what can I do from youtube like 

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:09.519
 we were today to dump more than less to this 

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:11.799
 I do not forget and good people as they will already have 

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:13.929
 seen my inactivity in the channel not 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:18.130
 may have uploaded videos for lack of 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:19.869
 internet the damn telmex good was that 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:23.560
 the modem burned again 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:27.460
 already two molds are burned and good 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:31.179
 we have achieved a break to be able and 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:34.990
 thus 60 the two modes here and in favor of 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:37.210
 crazy me and we already have internet and I was already 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:41.050
 failure to have brought them a video 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:44.350
 Android as we are seeing and good today 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:46.750
 I'm going to show you some games and then 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.270
 do something a little tour for my solar 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.070
 as we are seeing and I change the 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:53.560
 notifications bar not if they can 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:56.950
 see how the battery type is 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:01:02.400
 neighborhood and it's green and that's why 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:06.540
 alcohol let's see why I have 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:09.360
 android 2,306 unfinished update 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.360
 I already have the big gingerbread android 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.240
 be the 2.2.1 that had to give the roll 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:19.170
 and I decided to update it and it was more 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.630
 cool and can not stand things anymore 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.110
 good thing about the update is that the 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.110
 memory 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.290
 the memory 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.120
 it does not fill you much that we say because 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.340
 I will have installed applications of 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:37.030
 factory that were from this is the one that 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.740
 they try whatsapp that I did not have before 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.290
 because it does not give me the memory and as you see 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.970
 now I need a little spare and now 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:46.420
 had installed all that all the 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:49.480
 I had and sorry if I'm talking very 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:52.300
 fast I do not know good I'll show you the 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:54.430
 game that is today we already have my menu my 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:57.610
 small android menu 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:00.790
 and this icon can not be seen well 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:04.020
 icon is from a game called call of 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.020
 mini zombies 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:10.940
 What is the call of mimi zombies? 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:13.340
 Well then this game is thinking is 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:17.180
 thinking about the call of players 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:19.580
 duty zombies why because that game is 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.850
 call of duty zombies but in one version 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:25.790
 minutes the game is not at first 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.980
 person is still the same shooter 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.420
 but it's third person like we are 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.420
 watching here 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:35.120
 they are not famous and very pros we say 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:39.080
 they are squared zombies but it brings you 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.670
 good entertainment or a good game 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:44.120
 to pass him 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:47.750
 time and this is the menu of the heat and 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.760
 zombies as we are seeing the little ones 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.340
 little points that we see here are the parts of 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:56.290
 the campaign I go on day 19 on the day 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:59.600
 4 but in that update that blur and 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:03.020
 based on making a backup 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:07.930
 let's channel the menu we see that 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:10.989
 bring forgiveness for the color of the screen 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:13.930
 brings us to this part that is campaign 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:16.900
 cooperative we can enter with a friend 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:19.540
 for wifi and play to be able to play both in 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.549
 the campaign because they are several days or 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.670
 we have the option of versus that is 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:26.709
 90 can see well that allows us to play 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.650
 against other players via wifi 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:32.769
 I 'm going to show you a little tour here 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:36.280
 for the normal campaign we are already seeing 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:40.900
 we enter every first day I think that 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:44.189
 I'm going to laugh at the tutorial so good at 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:46.450
 the tutorial may show a bit of the 

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:48.000
 game mode and the gameplay that 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.580
 we have 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.400
 and here we have it as we are seeing day 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:55.970
 1 good did not throw the overcome but as 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.800
 we see is a third-person shooter 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:03.180
 They are little squared dolls and if they see that 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:05.000
 they kill me is because I do not have the other hand 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.690
 is with the one I have caught 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.390
 to the camera and we see that it is very fluid 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:14.120
 the game 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:17.630
 we have two types of weapons 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:19.850
 it is the first one that is a horrible mp5 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:23.750
 Well, we loved why 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:26.600
 it came out a lot and they killed me with it is also 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:28.639
 a game in third person the game is 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:31.250
 very good I can spend time here 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:35.760
 throwing 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:37.960
 and riding and I 'll show you another 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.150
 time 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:43.479
 the first weapons that give us the 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:48.669
 first as they saw was a rifle is 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:50.500
 terrible is the mp5 and us with the 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:53.710
 money we earn because for every 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:55.509
 game that we earn money and we can 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.849
 improve these weapons and not buy other 

00:04:55.509 --> 00:05:00.370
 government weapons there is a dog that is 

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:03.310
 attacking what we are going to do is run 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:06.449
 and another weapon that brings us very interesting 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:10.860
 and we're going to tell him to change forgiveness 

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:13.650
 it is this that is the chainsaw and I could not 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:15.990
 use it because they killed me good I think that 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:18.930
 it's from that review of this game very 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:20.969
 amazing called call or mini zombies the 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:23.249
 game is thought about the players of 

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:26.309
 coal dutti zombies because it's almost what 

00:05:23.249 --> 00:05:28.379
 same only in the gameplay changes 

00:05:26.309 --> 00:05:30.779
 because this is in the third person and the 

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:33.599
 another is in the first person if you are a 

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:36.559
 great call of duty player and good 

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:36.559
