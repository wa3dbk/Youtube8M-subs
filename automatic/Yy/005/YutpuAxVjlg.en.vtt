the speaker microphone USB port even at

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.700 
the speaker microphone USB port even at
the<00:01:03.390> top<00:01:03.539> of<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.750> headphone<00:01:04.080> jack<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.409> the

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
the top of the headphone jack and the

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.679 
the top of the headphone jack and the
sensors<00:01:05.430> above<00:01:08.000> camera<00:01:09.000> hole<00:01:09.150> was<00:01:09.330> obviously

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
sensors above camera hole was obviously

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.370 
sensors above camera hole was obviously
cut<00:01:09.930> so<00:01:10.799> as<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:11.040> flash<00:01:11.280> so<00:01:11.939> I've<00:01:12.510> taken<00:01:13.110> some

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
cut so as to flash so I've taken some

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.609 
cut so as to flash so I've taken some
pictures<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:13.979> I<00:01:14.869> think<00:01:15.869> this<00:01:15.930> is<00:01:15.990> if<00:01:16.470> I

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
pictures and I think this is if I

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.710 
pictures and I think this is if I
believe<00:01:16.939> this<00:01:17.939> is<00:01:18.090> one<00:01:18.240> of<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.390> cases<00:01:18.570> that

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
believe this is one of the cases that

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.359 
believe this is one of the cases that
actually<00:01:19.110> don't<00:01:19.290> affect<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.650> flash<00:01:19.890> which<00:01:20.220> is

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
actually don't affect the flash which is

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.160 
actually don't affect the flash which is
good<00:01:20.580> I<00:01:20.820> know<00:01:21.180> one<00:01:21.479> of<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.659> other<00:01:21.810> speaking

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
good I know one of the other speaking

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.560 
good I know one of the other speaking
cases<00:01:22.740> it's<00:01:23.280> kind<00:01:23.490> of<00:01:23.549> weird<00:01:23.759> it<00:01:24.210> kind<00:01:24.479> of

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
cases it's kind of weird it kind of

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.090 
cases it's kind of weird it kind of
draws<00:01:24.780> out<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.049> flash<00:01:25.380> at<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.619> top<00:01:25.830> it's

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
draws out the flash at the top it's

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.249

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
soft feel to it which is nice and then

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.810 
soft feel to it which is nice and then
the<00:01:53.640> sides<00:01:53.880> have<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.180> more<00:01:54.840> I<00:01:55.670> guess<00:01:56.670> you

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
the sides have the more I guess you

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.120 
the sides have the more I guess you
would<00:01:56.939> say<00:01:57.020> kind<00:01:58.020> of<00:01:58.049> like<00:01:58.170> a<00:01:58.200> plastic<00:01:58.560> like<00:01:59.040> a

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
would say kind of like a plastic like a

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.280 
would say kind of like a plastic like a
very<00:01:59.369> hard<00:01:59.579> plastic<00:02:00.060> I<00:02:00.240> would<00:02:00.960> say<00:02:01.079> if<00:02:01.200> I

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
very hard plastic I would say if I

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.620 
very hard plastic I would say if I
dropped<00:02:01.680> it<00:02:01.890> I<00:02:02.100> would<00:02:02.579> be<00:02:02.700> confident<00:02:03.329> that<00:02:03.509> it

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
dropped it I would be confident that it

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.230 
dropped it I would be confident that it
won't<00:02:03.869> break<00:02:04.549> but<00:02:05.549> if<00:02:05.640> i'm<00:02:05.759> outside<00:02:05.939> on

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
won't break but if i'm outside on

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.440 
won't break but if i'm outside on
concrete<00:02:06.750> and<00:02:07.129> i<00:02:08.129> like<00:02:08.340> it<00:02:08.610> gets<00:02:08.789> flung<00:02:09.149> i'm

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
concrete and i like it gets flung i'm

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.479 
concrete and i like it gets flung i'm
not<00:02:09.690> i'm<00:02:10.020> not<00:02:10.080> too<00:02:10.470> positive<00:02:10.649> about<00:02:11.039> that<00:02:11.220> i'm

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
not i'm not too positive about that i'm

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.390 
not i'm not too positive about that i'm
still<00:02:11.760> kind<00:02:11.970> of

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
still kind of

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.330 
still kind of
to<00:02:12.909> be<00:02:13.030> honest<00:02:13.329> before<00:02:13.510> I<00:02:13.720> pick<00:02:13.870> it<00:02:13.900> up<00:02:14.340> the

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
to be honest before I pick it up the

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.770 
to be honest before I pick it up the
next<00:02:15.549> thing<00:02:15.610> about<00:02:15.760> this<00:02:15.970> though<00:02:16.120> is<00:02:16.150> it<00:02:16.599> kind

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
next thing about this though is it kind

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.119 
next thing about this though is it kind
of<00:02:16.810> gives<00:02:16.930> it<00:02:17.049> a<00:02:17.140> lip<00:02:17.349> for<00:02:17.560> the<00:02:17.590> camera<00:02:17.980> in<00:02:18.040> the

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:18.129 
of gives it a lip for the camera in the

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:19.979 
of gives it a lip for the camera in the
flash<00:02:18.370> so<00:02:18.849> whenever<00:02:19.150> you<00:02:19.390> do<00:02:19.540> set<00:02:19.750> it<00:02:19.840> down

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
flash so whenever you do set it down

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:22.860 
flash so whenever you do set it down
you'd<00:02:20.920> have<00:02:21.010> to<00:02:21.069> worry<00:02:21.519> about<00:02:21.640> it<00:02:21.909> I'm<00:02:22.629> same

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
you'd have to worry about it I'm same

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.119 
you'd have to worry about it I'm same
thing<00:02:23.049> with<00:02:23.140> the<00:02:23.170> front<00:02:23.439> as<00:02:23.530> well<00:02:23.650> there's<00:02:24.069> a

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:24.129 
thing with the front as well there's a

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:26.880 
thing with the front as well there's a
very<00:02:24.370> minimal<00:02:24.849> lip<00:02:25.000> it's<00:02:25.180> not<00:02:25.390> crazy<00:02:25.840> it's<00:02:26.319> not

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
very minimal lip it's not crazy it's not

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.179 
very minimal lip it's not crazy it's not
too<00:02:27.629> it's<00:02:28.629> not<00:02:28.780> too<00:02:28.989> intense<00:02:29.349> you<00:02:29.650> can<00:02:29.739> kind<00:02:30.069> of

00:02:30.179 --> 00:02:30.189 
too it's not too intense you can kind of

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:33.030 
too it's not too intense you can kind of
see<00:02:30.250> make<00:02:30.670> it<00:02:30.790> out<00:02:30.939> but<00:02:31.290> it's<00:02:32.290> enough<00:02:32.590> so<00:02:32.859> where

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
see make it out but it's enough so where

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.110 
see make it out but it's enough so where
you<00:02:33.129> put<00:02:33.280> it<00:02:33.310> down<00:02:33.549> it's<00:02:33.730> not<00:02:33.849> going<00:02:33.970> to<00:02:34.060> be

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
you put it down it's not going to be

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.460 
you put it down it's not going to be
affected<00:02:34.569> so<00:02:35.349> overall<00:02:35.829> pretty<00:02:36.129> nice<00:02:36.340> in<00:02:36.489> case

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
affected so overall pretty nice in case

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.690 
affected so overall pretty nice in case
