 cargo dedicated to the awards system for 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:32.770
 murder in the game just yesterday 14 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.690
 August at the presentation of the new call of 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.239
 duty shown multiplayer 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.670
 part of the game and a lot of 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:43.270
 information appeared directly about 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:45.580
 the game itself in particular is worth noting 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:48.190
 a kind of return to the origins of 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:50.070
 killstreak of how these cargo 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:53.440
 followed in the footsteps of his predecessor 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.899
 wisely rf and r3 and so in the game again 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.960
 there will be three kinds of keeps track of which 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:00.850
 now called strike 3g and then soprut 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.980
 strike pikachu allows you to earn 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.989
 killing rewards with this amount 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.240
 points are not reset if 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.040
 the player was killed this is a specialist system 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.229
 perks for killing a player 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:14.500
 adversary and making him peculiar 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:16.869
 universal soldier and ordinary a solo 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.820
 strike back eat steeper 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:21.520
 rewards for killing that while 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:24.159
 reset if a player was killed 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:27.340
 actually a set of awards once again 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:28.360
 changed but how did let's change 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.729
 in more detail 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.290
 the first thing worth mentioning is that 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:35.500
 standard as a us straight edge 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:37.930
 jagerna is back and now there are two 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.600
 it is a light jaggerout having 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:43.600
 only a knife and heavy carrying 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:46.299
 so you thought the six-barreled machine gun 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.990
 so now feel like john 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:52.119
 rmb it will be possible not only cis 3 m 60 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:55.479
 In addition, a new one was added. 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:57.610
 killstreak dog reilly dog ​​plays a role 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:59.619
 a kind of bodyguard and some 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.689
 time will run after the player on the map 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:04.659
 killing all living things on their way 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:07.180
 dog understandably can be kill 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:10.149
 however, dog bodyguards are already there 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.019
 is the owner himself or rather the player 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.290
 caused 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:17.680
 i will go to dog 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.060
 life will be much more but the most important 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.970
 a reward that I would like to point out 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.210
 dear friends is invisible 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.310
 or maybe 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:28.070
 ghost exact name at the moment 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.760
 unknown think everyone played team 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.160
 fortress 2 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.930
 so there is such a character as 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.480
 spy who is a certain amount 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.850
 time can go full inviz 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.850
 there is something similar now in call of 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.560
 duty load now on reaching 14 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.240
 kills you get a chance on 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.850
 some time become invisible for 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.860
 the enemy and then it would be time 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:52.250
 start shouting something in the spirit of painting 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:54.410
 I can explode imbalance but the most 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.030
 the main and important thing here is that in the mode 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.760
 invisibility to attack 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:01.280
 but rather it will not be a player to shoot 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:04.040
 can only navigate the map this 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.420
 pleases however the question arises 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.460
 sense of this award 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.530
 after all as a matter of fact to the player using 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.570
 samp and straight edge system namely 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.730
 there is a given reward to lose 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:16.040
 nothing since the number of points 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.470
 required for awards are not reset 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:21.020
 after death and accordingly leave 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.100
 from chasing down lanes and passing streets 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:26.150
 to mode and me for 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:28.280
 no point though maybe given 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.980
 killstreak will be relevant for covert 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:33.320
 sabotage for example picking a token saints 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:36.350
 bodies of comrades and enemies as well 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:38.600
 mining and demining bombs well and 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:41.450
 Of course in Rostov moisture under the city 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:43.250
 automatic bullets in the light of new modes 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.460
 which focuses on team play 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:49.610
 this is very, very important but a new 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:51.470
 modes we'll talk another time in 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.480
 Anyway, this killstreak is very 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.510
 unusual and villar appears from the series 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:59.120
 call of duty for the first time the most important thing is to 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.550
 it did not hit the balance after all the moments 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:05.060
 out of the blue nowhere invisible 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:07.820
 Sosnin can become many times more but 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:10.490
 it's not all in addition to the game conduct 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:12.650
 killstalk hel sniper he also refers 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:15.350
 to support straight edge and for him 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.609
 13 killings required for killstreak 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:18.109
 makes you feel like 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:20.420
 helicopter sniper 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:22.880
 however, don't forget that 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:24.350
 sniper is very easy to kill by having 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.230
 a little bit straight arms 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:29.180
 firstly because it is open secondly 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:31.280
 because the helicopter hangs over the map 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:34.070
 and for a while does not move doing 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:36.200
 sniper excellent target and third 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:38.270
 it 's still a killstreak support 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:40.010
 very easy run without any problems 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.200
 accordingly this killstreak is very 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:44.300
 just destroy here such 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:47.270
 turned out quite short but 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:49.150
 hopefully let's get an informative video 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.970
 Now let's summarize 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:54.320
 gauti cargo curled up to the origins of the series 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:57.170
 abandoning the system of the skin strikov 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.470
 represented the nobility of everything in the game 

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:02.990
 there will be three types of rewards they are similar 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:04.940
 mudr r3 is killstreaks system 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:08.330
 universal soldier specialist and 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:10.910
 support of the game beyond standard awards 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:12.740
 you &amp; me type and parcels and drones will 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:15.650
 introduced new never seen before 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:17.960
 awards such as invisible camouflage them 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:20.630
 or sniper oh yes how could forget 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:23.660
 all fathers dream call of duty game 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:25.790
 returned map this can be seen on 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:28.780
 the screen that you see right now on 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:31.580
 its screens but everything is not so simple 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:33.470
 the main change is both his 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:35.750
 ease and accessibility 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:38.780
 the thing is now for getting mom 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:41.000
 only 16 bits required without death 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:43.880
 data solution on the one hand 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.070
 is it sufficiently justified now atm both 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:49.100
 full dynamic change depends 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:50.990
 cards after applying it and on the other 

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:51.860
 the parties we and while lost their 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:54.440
 hardcore 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:57.710
 and coolness and now crayfish will cause 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:59.690
 it more often than before, and this in 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:01.840
 I all hope that this video is for
