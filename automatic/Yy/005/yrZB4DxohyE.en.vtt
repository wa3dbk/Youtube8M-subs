board<00:06:14.760> and<00:06:15.270> my<00:06:15.750> aunt<00:06:15.990> my<00:06:16.230> amp<00:06:16.410> is<00:06:16.590> a<00:06:16.620> Vox<00:06:17.100> 50

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:17.730 
board and my aunt my amp is a Vox 50

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:21.200 
board and my aunt my amp is a Vox 50
watts<00:06:17.910> I<00:06:18.270> believe<00:06:19.020> the<00:06:19.350> it's<00:06:19.620> like<00:06:19.800> VD<00:06:20.070> 50<00:06:20.940> tea

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:21.210 
watts I believe the it's like VD 50 tea

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:22.550 
watts I believe the it's like VD 50 tea
or<00:06:21.330> something<00:06:21.540> like<00:06:21.720> that<00:06:21.780> it's<00:06:22.230> like<00:06:22.350> the

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:22.560 
or something like that it's like the

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.400 
or something like that it's like the
model<00:06:22.860> number<00:06:23.100> and<00:06:23.280> in<00:06:23.940> a<00:06:24.150> physics<00:06:24.810> book<00:06:24.900> how

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:25.410 
model number and in a physics book how

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:28.190 
model number and in a physics book how
much<00:06:25.560> physics<00:06:26.330> which<00:06:27.330> isn't<00:06:27.630> too<00:06:27.870> hard<00:06:28.050> i'm

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:28.200 
much physics which isn't too hard i'm

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.150 
much physics which isn't too hard i'm
actually<00:06:28.320> just<00:06:28.530> taking<00:06:28.830> it<00:06:28.950> for<00:06:29.100> a

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:29.160 
actually just taking it for a

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.990 
actually just taking it for a
requirement<00:06:29.820> so<00:06:30.480> that's<00:06:31.040> that's<00:06:32.040> pretty<00:06:32.310> much

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:33.000 
requirement so that's that's pretty much

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.060 
requirement so that's that's pretty much
that<00:06:33.420> guys<00:06:33.720> this<00:06:34.020> is<00:06:34.170> just<00:06:34.410> yeah<00:06:34.590> this<00:06:34.740> is<00:06:34.860> just

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:35.070 
that guys this is just yeah this is just

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:37.160 
that guys this is just yeah this is just
where<00:06:35.190> I<00:06:35.280> dwell<00:06:35.460> often<00:06:36.330> when<00:06:36.480> i<00:06:36.540> play<00:06:36.840> my<00:06:37.020> video

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:37.170 
where I dwell often when i play my video

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:38.780 
where I dwell often when i play my video
actually<00:06:37.560> always<00:06:37.860> want<00:06:38.160> to<00:06:38.190> play<00:06:38.340> video<00:06:38.550> games

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:38.790 
actually always want to play video games

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:41.810 
actually always want to play video games
listen<00:06:39.150> listen<00:06:39.750> with<00:06:40.020> friends<00:06:40.380> the<00:06:40.650> base

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:41.820 
listen listen with friends the base

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:43.850 
listen listen with friends the base
it's<00:06:41.910> pretty<00:06:42.090> much<00:06:42.180> a<00:06:42.240> disaster<00:06:42.420> zone<00:06:42.810> I<00:06:43.230> hold

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:43.860 
it's pretty much a disaster zone I hold

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:45.770 
it's pretty much a disaster zone I hold
lands<00:06:44.460> probably<00:06:44.790> every<00:06:44.970> other<00:06:45.000> week<00:06:45.330> and<00:06:45.570> so<00:06:45.750> I

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:45.780 
lands probably every other week and so I

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.360 
lands probably every other week and so I
really<00:06:46.110> don't<00:06:46.230> clean<00:06:46.470> things<00:06:46.650> up<00:06:46.800> too<00:06:46.980> much<00:06:47.130> as

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:47.370 
really don't clean things up too much as

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:50.020 
really don't clean things up too much as
by<00:06:47.790> the<00:06:47.850> time<00:06:48.060> I<00:06:48.210> do<00:06:48.270> when<00:06:48.960> I<00:06:48.990> get<00:06:49.110> around<00:06:49.260> to<00:06:49.560> it

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:50.030 
by the time I do when I get around to it

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:52.100 
by the time I do when I get around to it
then<00:06:51.030> people<00:06:51.270> are<00:06:51.360> over<00:06:51.540> again<00:06:51.720> so<00:06:51.930> it's<00:06:52.050> just

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:52.110 
then people are over again so it's just

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:54.650 
then people are over again so it's just
like<00:06:52.200> what's<00:06:52.410> the<00:06:52.530> point<00:06:53.180> yeah<00:06:54.180> it's<00:06:54.360> closed

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:54.660 
like what's the point yeah it's closed

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:57.980 
like what's the point yeah it's closed

that I've talked about before Islam is
pretty<00:06:59.610> freaking<00:07:00.150> awesome<00:07:00.680> music<00:07:01.680> folder

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:02.040 
pretty freaking awesome music folder

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:04.160 
pretty freaking awesome music folder
random<00:07:02.490> stuff<00:07:02.730> printer<00:07:03.210> and<00:07:03.480> that's<00:07:03.960> going<00:07:04.110> to

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:04.170 
random stuff printer and that's going to

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:05.390 
random stuff printer and that's going to
be<00:07:04.260> it<00:07:04.350> oh<00:07:04.530> let's<00:07:04.740> see<00:07:04.830> if<00:07:04.920> we<00:07:04.980> can<00:07:05.130> see<00:07:05.280> into

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:05.400 
be it oh let's see if we can see into

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.280 
be it oh let's see if we can see into
the<00:07:05.550> end<00:07:05.670> of<00:07:05.790> oblivion<00:07:06.210> here<00:07:06.420> so<00:07:07.050> I<00:07:07.110> want<00:07:07.170> to

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:07.290 
the end of oblivion here so I want to

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:09.410 
the end of oblivion here so I want to
thank<00:07:07.350> you<00:07:07.590> guys<00:07:07.620> for<00:07:07.830> watching<00:07:08.190> I<00:07:08.730> will<00:07:09.210> see
