00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.660
 is everyone knows drac are to be 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.940
 found again on gamers 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.320
 for a tutorial where you'll understand 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.779
 directly in the title we are going 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.029
 learn to manage supply and demand 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.550
 in dofus and then also we will talk about 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.640
 bulk purchase in new us so we 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:30.060
 is found in the age of the runes 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.130
 so dofus to Bonta where we go all of 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.390
 Learn how to manage the wholesale purchase 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.520
 you will quickly understand that the 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.260
 principle so here we are going to sell 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.290
 finally we will do business on 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.450
 runes then the rings barely the 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.190
 principle it is simple is that for 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.809
 any street so there I am 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.730
 solar and the ugap for example we're going 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.780
 look to buy wholesale so we go 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:55.110
 see if if you buy by 100 or by 10 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.699
 is not it any less expensive to 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.420
 unity that if we finally want if we 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.559
 do not buy 1 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:04.799
 and if it turns out that yeah well we'll 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.650
 bought by 100 or by 10 then resell to 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.990
 unity so there on delight you go 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.110
 see that it's useless to buy 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:16.619
 since for one hundred units we will pay a 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.659
 million four hundred and thirty nine 1993 if 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:23.670
 we divide by 100 to have a unit 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:25.130
 we pay at 14 1399 so it comes back 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.970
 saves us a misery 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:32.070
 so there a rune raza costs 29 1995 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.630
 this is normal because there it is I who 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.140
 actually sells them I had bought a 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:42.750
 hundred rune some rune 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:44.850
 rassaa 1500000 which made sure that 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.450
 I earned a million five hundred thousand to 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.040
 resale 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:52.799
 since in contrast benef in total I 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.170
 had for 3 million - the one million 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.280
 five buying it made me a million 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.840
 five net profit 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.250
 you'll understand it's a trick when 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.729
 even quite profitable so there you see 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:05.399
 that it's not interesting because for 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:08.670
 200 miles invested we will pay 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.950
 if my calculations are good 2015 at the unit 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.680
 and we end up in negative profits 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:18.189
 so that's it 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:20.890
 Tom here is nothing like this here 

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:24.549
 we still lose here here it's the same 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:28.659
 thing or there is badly barred for the 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:35.230
 video what are we going to find something 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:42.760
 of nice to show you then so have 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:44.799
 still not always here not ok 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.159
 okay so here you can see by 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:49.389
 example for resale 

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:52.150
 yeah this is going to take this example there 

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:56.230
 ruins po we will pay 13 thousand 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:58.269
 qualities for how to say to buy 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.000
 our senses rune p o 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:02.919
 and we will sell them a million seven 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.219
 one hundred and four words the la what am I 

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:05.319
 can say 

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:11.019
 seventeen thousand nine hundred and four units 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:12.879
 or 10 180 thousand cases my part 10 so we 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:16.959
 go calculus is quickly done quickly 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:20.919
 done well so that's going to make us a 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:24.069
 million seven hundred and ninety thousand 

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:26.560
 less one million three hundred thousand 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:28.449
 we are going to make a total profit late in 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.799
 net profit about 500 miles 

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:32.290
 common so it's not huge compared 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:33.220
 to the 1 million 5 that I did with the 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.260
 streets thanks to you I must say that I 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.609
 was lucky you see that 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.189
 frankly false on the occasion 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:41.079
 have to see if the courses have not or finally 

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:42.370
 see if someone has not bought a lot 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:45.970
 a lot of ruins just before history 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:48.699
 that the unit price has exploded and is going 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:51.400
 return the next day to his his condition 

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:52.479
 normal when I mean resume a 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.060
 normal price 

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:57.340
 here we have a typical example with 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:04.900
 the runes pavie we will pay here not to 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:07.750
 the unit 3190 199 kid we go the 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:10.659
 sell 8000 to the unit we will have a 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:13.299
 benefit of about 500 miles not camin 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:15.220
 negligible after each one makes it to 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:15.970
 the scale he wants I mean if by 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.449
 against you have a lot of cases 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:21.070
 to invest me answer you like me 

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:23.440
 leaving 100 street thanks to a million 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.170
 five you will win more but if by 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.780
 example you are 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:28.820
 low level you have kind 200000 that at 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.500
 invest and take the smaller ones 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.180
 streets you will make less profit 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.220
 so you will win less quickly 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.750
 millions but that's a profit 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.820
 when we are low level who is when 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.380
 even so therefore should not need not 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.480
 neglect it 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:44.960
 good here I think I went around on 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:47.300
 on the room or in our chips 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.040
 now let's talk about the supply and the 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:53.270
 ask a trick anyway 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:54.700
 since this time we are going to go 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:57.910
 return to the age of resources 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:05:02.900
 here is that shot of the xsara 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:04.370
 it's a collection of peasants so we 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:06.350
 will look right now that's all 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:08.810
 the small resources that the 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:11.060
 people need for kraft and 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.560
 things when he when how to say when 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.810
 he rides trades as a tailor 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:19.370
 coordinate all his food leathers all 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:21.440
 Helen of food all that can come to 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:23.840
 finally the price can come to swell 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:27.260
 a lot like we're going to say that the 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:28.550
 usual price is around on the 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:31.070
 of anna torv nation on my server 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:34.340
 turn around the aisles we will say 9th 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:37.010
 as at the 1800 vouvoyer for 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:38.390
 white is a little more so here is the 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:40.100
 honestly it's a bit expensive 

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:41.900
 here the senses but when you see by 

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:43.820
 example on your server runs it in 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:47.150
 the normal course yes here I am not 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:50.060
 expressed of helene of food white tone 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:51.920
 for example is 2nd I mean fifteen 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:54.350
 a thousand hand case and you see them 

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:55.790
 days in 2015 that means there is no 

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:57.650
 not many people who need it 

00:05:55.790 --> 00:06:01.130
 so to a lot a lot of resale at this 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:03.290
 moment h they bought in kind 

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:05.480
 bah much as you can for example 

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:07.520
 the khl to you see that it comes 

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:10.550
 sale I think I have not noticed 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:13.520
 so I said bought in a lot but 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:17.120
 this is not just stop buying in 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:18.950
 a lot so kind 2000 we will say you 

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:21.320
 will pay a sum 

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:24.830
 help you see that the course of Helene 

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:26.420
 whit comes to explode and sell well 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:28.640
 and at that moment it's like 

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:30.200
 people for example the people who play 

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:32.480
 on the court by the shadow of gold or a 

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:34.040
 trick of the Corsican player and not expensive 

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:36.370
 buy when it's expensive revenge 

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:40.720
 it's just what you have to remember 

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:43.720
 on order on purchase and resale 

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:45.070
 in dofus must buy when it's not 

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:46.960
 expensive you have to sell when it's very 

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:48.850
 dear is the base it is the base of 

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:50.680
 dofus so there you see it works too 

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:52.540
 with leathers any leather that 

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:54.639
 walk as soon as a skin resource is needed 

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:56.530
 kraft babel in a trade is good 

00:06:54.639 --> 00:07:00.250
 often that's what's most 

00:06:56.530 --> 00:07:02.590
 profitable at the business level so good 

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:04.960
 here you can either not 

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:06.310
 badly of case but I mean with this 

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:08.290
 technique is not so not really a 

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:09.580
 technique that's what everyone 

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:11.949
 do not know our guns what everyone 

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:13.660
 often forget or say for 

00:07:11.949 --> 00:07:15.190
 2000 km I do not want to do it but must 

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:16.300
 to say that in opus 1 cammas and a 

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:18.460
 kama you must not neglect 

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:21.100
 so that's my dofus rise 

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:23.770
 it was difficult coup city drac 6
