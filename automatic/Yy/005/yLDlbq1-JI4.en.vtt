00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.259
 usually sport self we pass our 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.629
 time trying to make you hear 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.150
 the engine and to make the car sound 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.610
 there is a little bit complicated for any 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.590
 way there is no sport mode in 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.139
 this rolls royce wade there is no 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.580
 words of the exhaust opening and 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.690
 somewhere is still very 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.100
 different from the philosophy of the 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.449
 car 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.730
 we know that there is a motor there was 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.859
 twelve biturbo that is more than 630 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.289
 horses so at power level we have 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.630
 lack of anything on the other hand we are when 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.610
 even in the flying carpet philosophy and 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.930
 we are in a car precisely 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.820
 play the discretion 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.280
 there is a little quivering under the 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.480
 hood a very slight vibration that 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.420
 gives the impression that the car is in 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.219
 life that's what's interesting but we 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.840
 will not hear anything attic we will not 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.320
 to be able to make big demonstration to 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.760
 exhaust 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.760
 it's not the spirit of the car 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.940
 after it's a coupe it's a coupe of which 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.260
 we can say by looking at 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.610
 features a little way 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:05.430
 fast finally it's a car that 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.740
 is able to compete with the 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.060
 bentley continental gt speed one is at 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.040
 about the same level of power 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.600
 this one is probably a little bit 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.520
 heavier because we are two tons 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.000
 4 in bulk for condÃ© in the category 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:21.660
 heavy weights but the mind we have a coupe 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.420
 high class with a turbo v12 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:26.160
 compressed by more than 600 horses for 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.030
 we realize very quickly that it 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.780
 not related to 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:33.420
 the bentley plays the card of a car 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.700
 sporty despite his weight despite 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.550
 of his imbalance with a very nose 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.970
 loaded here the car is a lot more 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:45.090
 balanced we will say but extremely 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.950
 extremely soft soft very discreet and 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.660
 especially the management of the box is 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.360
 very particular is no manual mode 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.220
 there is no sport mode must be left 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.350
 to do the car you have to do it 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.880
 trust and so the idea is to have 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.550
 a dynamic car at rolls royce 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.900
 they do not want to talk about sports that's 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.120
 it seems to be a kind of taboo 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.470
 but a younger car more 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.390
 dynamic 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.810
 when we accelerate fully we hear well 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.810
 authors 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:15.880
 there is no outlines the dough 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.590
 my turn there is a reserve dial of 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.450
 power like on the ghosts falls 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.340
 on the bosses does not care 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.910
 directly things downright 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.830
 mechanical 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.360
 the key word probably of this 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.440
 car is the potential it is 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.370
 able to do a lot of things 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:32.380
 it does not mean that the pleasure of 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.250
 car is to go explore all 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.440
 the nights 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.720
 if not all done for the trip too 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.860
 good for the little road that for that 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.250
 long motorway journeys 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:44.170
 it remains excessively pleasant to 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.690
 cities even in the traffic jams that 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.700
 is still quite rare because the 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.950
 absolute silence and filtering 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:54.280
 suspensions is really fascinating 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:56.580
 then it pays if it is paid or persists 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:01.990
 leamy it is paid by a little precision 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:04.480
 but there is no one feels the weight of 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:06.410
 the car but eventually it makes 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.830
 part of philosophy 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.830
