know<00:00:14.910> why<00:00:15.059> they<00:00:15.210> do<00:00:15.360> that<00:00:15.389> and<00:00:15.750> this<00:00:15.840> time<00:00:16.080> of

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:16.200 
know why they do that and this time of

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.620 
know why they do that and this time of
the<00:00:16.260> year<00:00:16.379> but<00:00:16.590> now

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:19.630
