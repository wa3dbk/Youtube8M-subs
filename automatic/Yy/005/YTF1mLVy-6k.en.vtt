today I'd like to talk to you a little
bit<00:00:09.470> about<00:00:09.590> difference<00:00:10.130> between<00:00:10.340> derma

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:10.730 
bit about difference between derma

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.820 
bit about difference between derma
rollers<00:00:11.060> and<00:00:11.240> chemical<00:00:11.750> peels<00:00:11.930> now<00:00:12.590> we<00:00:12.680> get

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:12.830 
rollers and chemical peels now we get

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.040 
rollers and chemical peels now we get
access<00:00:12.980> a<00:00:13.220> lot<00:00:13.490> in<00:00:13.760> the<00:00:13.940> clinic<00:00:14.269> and<00:00:14.420> also<00:00:14.900> by

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:15.050 
access a lot in the clinic and also by

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:16.689 
access a lot in the clinic and also by
email<00:00:15.410> and<00:00:15.559> so<00:00:15.710> forth<00:00:15.980> people<00:00:16.490> trying<00:00:16.640> to

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:16.699 
email and so forth people trying to

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:18.310 
email and so forth people trying to
compare<00:00:17.119> and<00:00:17.330> choose<00:00:17.539> which<00:00:17.779> cosmetic

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:18.320 
compare and choose which cosmetic

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.800 
compare and choose which cosmetic
treatment<00:00:18.740> might<00:00:18.859> suit<00:00:19.099> them<00:00:19.339> okay<00:00:20.240> a<00:00:20.449> couple

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:20.810 
treatment might suit them okay a couple

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:22.720 
treatment might suit them okay a couple
of<00:00:20.869> things<00:00:21.019> first<00:00:21.289> of<00:00:21.529> all<00:00:21.589> how<00:00:22.009> do<00:00:22.070> they<00:00:22.279> work

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:22.730 
of things first of all how do they work

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:24.729 
of things first of all how do they work
now<00:00:22.999> both<00:00:23.359> derma<00:00:23.779> rollers<00:00:24.079> and<00:00:24.289> chemical

00:00:24.729 --> 00:00:24.739 
now both derma rollers and chemical

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:27.489 
now both derma rollers and chemical
peels<00:00:25.009> work<00:00:25.789> by<00:00:26.089> creating<00:00:26.569> trauma<00:00:26.929> in<00:00:27.319> the

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:27.499 
peels work by creating trauma in the

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:29.439 
peels work by creating trauma in the
dermis<00:00:27.859> level<00:00:28.159> of<00:00:28.279> skin<00:00:28.550> so<00:00:29.060> they<00:00:29.179> have<00:00:29.329> to

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:29.449 
dermis level of skin so they have to

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:31.089 
dermis level of skin so they have to
pass<00:00:29.659> through<00:00:29.989> the<00:00:30.199> epidermis<00:00:30.829> the<00:00:30.859> base

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:31.099 
pass through the epidermis the base

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:32.950 
pass through the epidermis the base
surface<00:00:31.550> out<00:00:31.730> of<00:00:31.759> the<00:00:31.849> skin<00:00:32.119> through<00:00:32.689> to<00:00:32.840> the

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:32.960 
surface out of the skin through to the

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.780 
surface out of the skin through to the
deeper<00:00:33.230> level<00:00:33.530> of<00:00:33.590> the<00:00:33.680> dermis<00:00:34.070> and<00:00:34.579> then

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790 
deeper level of the dermis and then

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:36.639 
deeper level of the dermis and then
create<00:00:35.090> trauma<00:00:35.480> in<00:00:35.660> that<00:00:35.840> area<00:00:36.170> of<00:00:36.230> the<00:00:36.410> skin

00:00:36.639 --> 00:00:36.649 
create trauma in that area of the skin

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:38.799 
create trauma in that area of the skin
just<00:00:36.949> a<00:00:37.100> tiny<00:00:37.370> amount<00:00:37.640> of<00:00:37.850> trauma<00:00:38.059> and<00:00:38.390> this

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:38.809 
just a tiny amount of trauma and this

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:41.049 
just a tiny amount of trauma and this
thing<00:00:39.079> crane<00:00:39.469> stimulates<00:00:40.219> the<00:00:40.579> body<00:00:40.760> to

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:41.059 
thing crane stimulates the body to

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:43.180 
thing crane stimulates the body to
create<00:00:41.329> an<00:00:41.510> entirely<00:00:41.929> new<00:00:42.109> layer<00:00:42.500> of<00:00:42.649> collagen

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
create an entirely new layer of collagen

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.340 
create an entirely new layer of collagen
in<00:00:43.309> that<00:00:43.429> area<00:00:43.850> now<00:00:44.510> before<00:00:44.840> I<00:00:44.870> proceed<00:00:45.050> I

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
in that area now before I proceed I

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.049 
in that area now before I proceed I
should<00:00:45.679> just<00:00:45.829> mention<00:00:45.980> quickly<00:00:46.609> if<00:00:46.699> anyone's

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:47.059 
should just mention quickly if anyone's

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:48.819 
should just mention quickly if anyone's

if<00:00:56.239> you<00:00:56.359> want<00:00:56.539> to<00:00:56.600> so<00:00:57.589> we've<00:00:57.769> established<00:00:57.920> that

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 
if you want to so we've established that

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:00.549 
if you want to so we've established that
both<00:00:58.699> the<00:00:59.059> chemical<00:00:59.300> peel<00:00:59.780> and<00:01:00.050> the<00:01:00.260> derma

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
both the chemical peel and the derma

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:02.229 
both the chemical peel and the derma
roller<00:01:00.769> can<00:01:01.280> create<00:01:01.670> your<00:01:01.820> body's<00:01:02.120> own

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
roller can create your body's own

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:04.119 
roller can create your body's own
natural<00:01:02.300> layer<00:01:02.929> of<00:01:03.019> collagen<00:01:03.469> and<00:01:03.620> enhance

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
natural layer of collagen and enhance

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.040 
natural layer of collagen and enhance
this<00:01:04.430> healing<00:01:04.790> effect<00:01:05.120> and<00:01:05.330> therefore<00:01:05.570> create

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.050 
this healing effect and therefore create

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.170 
this healing effect and therefore create
new<00:01:06.260> smoother<00:01:06.680> skin<00:01:06.800> so<00:01:07.550> therefore<00:01:07.910> they<00:01:08.030> can

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
new smoother skin so therefore they can

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.640 
new smoother skin so therefore they can
both<00:01:08.330> be<00:01:08.540> used<00:01:08.570> for<00:01:08.990> the<00:01:09.050> treatment<00:01:09.080> of

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
both be used for the treatment of

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.540 
both be used for the treatment of
wrinkles<00:01:10.330> patchy<00:01:11.330> skin<00:01:11.860> scars<00:01:12.860> and<00:01:13.430> other

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:13.550 
wrinkles patchy skin scars and other

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.790 
wrinkles patchy skin scars and other
lines<00:01:13.820> on<00:01:14.150> the<00:01:14.240> face<00:01:14.420> amongst<00:01:15.050> other<00:01:15.200> things

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:15.800 
lines on the face amongst other things

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.680 
lines on the face amongst other things
so<00:01:16.460> the<00:01:16.610> main<00:01:16.760> difference<00:01:17.150> between<00:01:17.210> the<00:01:17.510> two

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:17.690 
so the main difference between the two

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.470 
so the main difference between the two
then<00:01:17.930> the<00:01:18.740> chemical<00:01:19.190> peels<00:01:19.490> basically

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:20.480 
then the chemical peels basically

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.200 
then the chemical peels basically
removed<00:01:21.170> a<00:01:21.500> surface<00:01:21.980> layer<00:01:22.190> of<00:01:22.310> your<00:01:22.580> skin<00:01:22.640> and

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
removed a surface layer of your skin and

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.300 
removed a surface layer of your skin and
what<00:01:23.870> this<00:01:24.020> actually<00:01:24.260> means<00:01:24.500> is<00:01:24.920> they<00:01:25.070> remove

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
what this actually means is they remove

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:26.800 
what this actually means is they remove
very<00:01:25.550> surface<00:01:25.820> they<00:01:26.150> are<00:01:26.180> part<00:01:26.480> of<00:01:26.660> the

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
very surface they are part of the

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.660 
very surface they are part of the
stratum<00:01:27.350> corneum<00:01:27.410> which<00:01:28.220> is<00:01:28.310> actually<00:01:28.580> the

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
stratum corneum which is actually the

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.060 
stratum corneum which is actually the
waterproof<00:01:29.240> outer<00:01:29.420> layer<00:01:29.810> of<00:01:29.840> your<00:01:30.110> body<00:01:30.290> now

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
waterproof outer layer of your body now

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:32.680 
waterproof outer layer of your body now
because<00:01:31.490> of<00:01:31.610> this<00:01:31.730> what<00:01:32.000> you<00:01:32.090> actually<00:01:32.240> get<00:01:32.540> is

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:32.690 
because of this what you actually get is

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.770 
because of this what you actually get is
you<00:01:32.810> have<00:01:32.930> a<00:01:32.960> slightly<00:01:33.230> higher<00:01:33.560> rate<00:01:33.890> increase

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
you have a slightly higher rate increase

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.630 
you have a slightly higher rate increase
infection<00:01:35.780> risk<00:01:36.020> and<00:01:36.350> you<00:01:36.800> also<00:01:36.980> have<00:01:37.340> some

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
infection risk and you also have some

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.820 
infection risk and you also have some
smaller<00:01:37.940> risk<00:01:38.240> of<00:01:38.420> pigmentation<00:01:39.140> issues<00:01:39.500> and

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830 
smaller risk of pigmentation issues and

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
dehydration also becomes a bigger issue

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.000

a<00:01:51.380> comparison<00:01:52.250> derma<00:01:52.910> rollers<00:01:53.270> actually<00:01:53.660> work

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
a comparison derma rollers actually work

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.780 
a comparison derma rollers actually work
by<00:01:54.020> creating<00:01:54.440> punctures<00:01:54.980> through<00:01:55.550> that

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
by creating punctures through that

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.790 
by creating punctures through that
surface<00:01:56.030> level<00:01:56.510> through<00:01:56.750> the<00:01:56.780> epidermis<00:01:57.410> to

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
get down as the deeper dermis level

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.300 
get down as the deeper dermis level
where<00:01:59.540> that<00:01:59.660> can<00:01:59.780> stimulate<00:02:00.020> collagen<00:02:00.500> now

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
where that can stimulate collagen now

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.640 
where that can stimulate collagen now
these<00:02:01.520> puncture<00:02:01.970> holes<00:02:02.270> can<00:02:02.720> also<00:02:02.900> result<00:02:03.440> in

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:03.650 
these puncture holes can also result in

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.920 
these puncture holes can also result in
a<00:02:03.920> degree<00:02:04.340> of<00:02:04.370> dehydration<00:02:05.060> because

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
a degree of dehydration because

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:07.600 
a degree of dehydration because
obviously<00:02:06.080> the<00:02:06.560> body's<00:02:06.800> fluids<00:02:07.130> can<00:02:07.280> leak<00:02:07.460> out

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
obviously the body's fluids can leak out

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.309 
obviously the body's fluids can leak out
through<00:02:07.850> these<00:02:07.970> holes<00:02:08.030> but<00:02:08.720> it<00:02:08.840> tends<00:02:09.050> to<00:02:09.140> be

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
through these holes but it tends to be

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:11.020 
through these holes but it tends to be
rather<00:02:09.470> short<00:02:09.679> term<00:02:10.190> because<00:02:10.670> the<00:02:10.759> actual

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
rather short term because the actual

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.480 
rather short term because the actual
holes<00:02:11.270> formed<00:02:11.780> tend<00:02:12.230> to<00:02:12.320> completely<00:02:12.770> close<00:02:13.160> in

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
holes formed tend to completely close in

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.280 
holes formed tend to completely close in
about<00:02:13.730> eight<00:02:13.970> hours<00:02:14.210> after<00:02:14.630> the<00:02:14.870> train

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
about eight hours after the train

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.220 
about eight hours after the train
so<00:02:15.799> wait<00:02:15.950> hours<00:02:16.430> later<00:02:16.700> you're<00:02:17.390> basically

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
so wait hours later you're basically

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:19.509 
so wait hours later you're basically
there<00:02:18.439> completely<00:02:18.830> sealed<00:02:19.220> and<00:02:19.459> the

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:19.519 
there completely sealed and the

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:21.399 
there completely sealed and the
waterproof<00:02:19.970> barrier<00:02:20.180> is<00:02:20.540> back<00:02:20.720> intact<00:02:21.079> and<00:02:21.349> in

00:02:21.399 --> 00:02:21.409 
waterproof barrier is back intact and in

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:23.819 
waterproof barrier is back intact and in
place<00:02:21.620> okay<00:02:22.489> so<00:02:22.549> I<00:02:22.700> mentioned<00:02:22.819> briefly<00:02:23.269> that

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:23.829 
place okay so I mentioned briefly that

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:26.050 
place okay so I mentioned briefly that
importantly<00:02:24.829> when<00:02:25.400> you're<00:02:25.519> using<00:02:25.670> a<00:02:25.849> derma

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
importantly when you're using a derma

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.640 
importantly when you're using a derma
roller<00:02:26.420> they've<00:02:26.810> actually<00:02:26.959> shown<00:02:27.170> in

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
roller they've actually shown in

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.229 
roller they've actually shown in
scientific<00:02:28.099> studies<00:02:28.430> that<00:02:28.549> it's<00:02:28.700> quite<00:02:28.939> safe

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
scientific studies that it's quite safe

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:31.179 
scientific studies that it's quite safe

00:02:31.179 --> 00:02:31.189 
for all different skin types because it

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:33.670 
for all different skin types because it
has<00:02:31.310> no<00:02:31.519> effects<00:02:32.150> on<00:02:32.329> pigmentation<00:02:33.260> changes

has no effects on pigmentation changes

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.380 
has no effects on pigmentation changes
on<00:02:33.769> the<00:02:33.829> skin<00:02:34.040> it<00:02:34.280> doesn't<00:02:34.700> damage<00:02:35.000> the<00:02:35.239> little

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390

melanocytes which are produced melanin

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.099 
melanocytes which are produced melanin
and<00:02:39.409> control<00:02:39.799> the<00:02:39.920> pigmentation<00:02:40.370> of<00:02:40.670> the<00:02:40.730> skin

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:41.109 
and control the pigmentation of the skin

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:44.500 
and control the pigmentation of the skin
also<00:02:42.109> what<00:02:42.650> we<00:02:42.769> should<00:02:43.040> discuss<00:02:43.400> is<00:02:43.700> when

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
also what we should discuss is when

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.720 
also what we should discuss is when
you're<00:02:44.659> using<00:02:44.780> a<00:02:45.019> 0.5<00:02:45.739> millimeter<00:02:46.220> roller<00:02:46.519> as

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
easier to use than that the last thing I

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.420 
easier to use than that the last thing I
want<00:03:11.989> to<00:03:12.019> discuss<00:03:12.139> briefly<00:03:12.560> and<00:03:13.099> we<00:03:13.159> get<00:03:13.340> this

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
want to discuss briefly and we get this

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.940 
want to discuss briefly and we get this
question<00:03:13.670> a<00:03:13.970> lot<00:03:14.120> is<00:03:14.329> so<00:03:14.780> if<00:03:15.290> they<00:03:15.560> both<00:03:15.680> work

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
question a lot is so if they both work

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.009 
question a lot is so if they both work
on<00:03:16.099> the<00:03:16.159> same<00:03:16.250> mechanism<00:03:17.030> can<00:03:17.569> you<00:03:17.780> use

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:18.019 
on the same mechanism can you use

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:19.569 
on the same mechanism can you use
chemical<00:03:18.560> peels<00:03:18.799> and<00:03:18.980> derma<00:03:19.280> rolling

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:19.579 
chemical peels and derma rolling

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:22.750 
chemical peels and derma rolling
together<00:03:19.879> well<00:03:20.870> yes<00:03:21.199> and<00:03:21.379> no<00:03:21.459> you<00:03:22.459> wouldn't

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
together well yes and no you wouldn't

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.129 
together well yes and no you wouldn't
tend<00:03:22.940> to<00:03:23.060> use<00:03:23.239> them<00:03:23.419> together<00:03:23.569> at<00:03:23.840> the<00:03:23.930> same

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:24.139 
tend to use them together at the same

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:25.780 
tend to use them together at the same
time<00:03:24.500> many<00:03:24.799> years<00:03:24.919> ago<00:03:25.400> I<00:03:25.430> know<00:03:25.549> many

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
time many years ago I know many

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.369 
time many years ago I know many
practitioners<00:03:26.180> used<00:03:26.690> to<00:03:26.840> do<00:03:26.959> this<00:03:27.139> and

00:03:27.369 --> 00:03:27.379 
practitioners used to do this and

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:29.619 
practitioners used to do this and
actually<00:03:27.470> use<00:03:27.919> a<00:03:27.949> chemical<00:03:28.310> peel<00:03:28.819> and<00:03:29.090> the

00:03:29.619 --> 00:03:29.629 
actually use a chemical peel and the

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:31.539 
actually use a chemical peel and the
derma<00:03:29.810> roll<00:03:30.019> treatment<00:03:30.440> had<00:03:30.549> simultaneously

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549 
derma roll treatment had simultaneously

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:34.210 
derma roll treatment had simultaneously
I<00:03:32.359> definitely<00:03:33.230> wouldn't<00:03:33.530> recommend<00:03:33.859> that

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
I definitely wouldn't recommend that

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.009 
I definitely wouldn't recommend that
working<00:03:34.669> on<00:03:34.790> the<00:03:34.910> same<00:03:35.120> mechanism<00:03:35.780> it<00:03:35.900> can

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
working on the same mechanism it can

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:37.720 
working on the same mechanism it can
just<00:03:36.230> sort<00:03:36.379> of<00:03:36.410> over<00:03:36.739> stimulate<00:03:37.160> create<00:03:37.489> too

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
just sort of over stimulate create too

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.240 
just sort of over stimulate create too
much<00:03:37.940> trauma<00:03:38.449> in<00:03:38.930> the<00:03:39.169> skin<00:03:39.470> so<00:03:39.949> I<00:03:39.980> wouldn't

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
much trauma in the skin so I wouldn't

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.009 
much trauma in the skin so I wouldn't
recommend<00:03:40.489> that<00:03:40.819> so<00:03:41.419> then<00:03:41.569> the<00:03:41.690> next<00:03:41.840> question

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
recommend that so then the next question

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:43.869 
recommend that so then the next question
is<00:03:42.410> well<00:03:42.650> then<00:03:42.829> how<00:03:43.099> far<00:03:43.129> apart<00:03:43.459> do<00:03:43.819> you

00:03:43.869 --> 00:03:43.879 
is well then how far apart do you

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:46.509 
is well then how far apart do you
actually<00:03:44.030> do<00:03:44.299> them<00:03:44.540> well<00:03:45.139> my<00:03:45.440> golden<00:03:45.949> rule<00:03:46.160> is

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519 
actually do them well my golden rule is

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:49.270 
actually do them well my golden rule is
at<00:03:46.760> least<00:03:47.030> two<00:03:47.419> weeks<00:03:47.660> but<00:03:48.500> the<00:03:48.980> bigger<00:03:49.190> thing

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
at least two weeks but the bigger thing

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.920 
at least two weeks but the bigger thing
you<00:03:49.519> have<00:03:49.669> to<00:03:49.819> think<00:03:50.030> about<00:03:50.299> is<00:03:50.510> you<00:03:50.660> have<00:03:50.810> to

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
you have to think about is you have to

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:52.869 
you have to think about is you have to
wait<00:03:51.109> till<00:03:51.379> the<00:03:51.500> inflammation<00:03:51.949> from<00:03:52.639> one

00:03:52.869 --> 00:03:52.879 
wait till the inflammation from one

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:54.879 
wait till the inflammation from one
treatment<00:03:53.209> has<00:03:53.510> faded<00:03:53.780> before<00:03:54.560> you<00:03:54.680> can

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:54.889 
treatment has faded before you can

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:56.710 
treatment has faded before you can
consider<00:03:55.280> doing<00:03:55.459> the<00:03:55.699> second<00:03:56.090> treatment<00:03:56.359> and

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
consider doing the second treatment and

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.780 
consider doing the second treatment and
I'd<00:03:57.079> say<00:03:57.290> that's<00:03:57.440> usually<00:03:58.010> a<00:03:58.040> minimum<00:03:58.310> of<00:03:58.609> two

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
I'd say that's usually a minimum of two

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.309 
I'd say that's usually a minimum of two
weeks<00:03:59.030> but<00:03:59.239> in<00:03:59.359> some<00:03:59.599> cases<00:03:59.870> that<00:04:00.199> can

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 
weeks but in some cases that can

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:02.979 
weeks but in some cases that can
actually<00:04:00.620> be<00:04:00.739> quite<00:04:00.889> a<00:04:01.010> lot<00:04:01.310> longer<00:04:01.810> that's<00:04:02.810> it

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:02.989 
actually be quite a lot longer that's it

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:04.809 
actually be quite a lot longer that's it
