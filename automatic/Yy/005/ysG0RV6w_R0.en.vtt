once<00:01:32.510> you<00:01:32.600> get<00:01:32.690> to<00:01:32.750> an<00:01:32.960> edge<00:01:34.060> before<00:01:35.060> yet

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:02:00.899 

our<00:01:42.610> guys<00:01:42.910> got<00:01:42.940> a<00:01:43.210> wall<00:01:43.450> tractor<00:01:43.960> with<00:01:44.200> this

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:00.909 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:03.600 

when<00:02:01.210> you<00:02:01.330> put<00:02:01.509> it<00:02:01.600> onto<00:02:01.780> the<00:02:02.020> gas<00:02:02.460> against<00:02:03.460> a

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
when you put it onto the gas against a

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.440 
when you put it onto the gas against a
onto<00:02:03.940> the<00:02:04.060> B<00:02:04.210> layer<00:02:04.450> doesn't<00:02:05.080> matter<00:02:05.350> where

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.749 

and<00:02:08.840> then<00:02:09.020> jump<00:02:09.200> off<00:02:09.470> to<00:02:09.950> take<00:02:10.130> off<00:02:10.340> the<00:02:10.460> spread

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
and then jump off to take off the spread

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.240 
and then jump off to take off the spread
but<00:02:11.030> is<00:02:11.300> that<00:02:11.569> obviously<00:02:12.260> as<00:02:12.410> I<00:02:12.620> take<00:02:12.860> up<00:02:13.069> on

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
but is that obviously as I take up on

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.820 
but is that obviously as I take up on
the<00:02:13.430> system<00:02:13.910> I'm<00:02:14.540> pretty<00:02:14.780> stretch<00:02:15.140> putting

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
the system I'm pretty stretch putting

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.920 
the system I'm pretty stretch putting
more<00:02:16.040> reward<00:02:16.340> onto<00:02:16.760> my<00:02:16.940> system<00:02:17.000> a<00:02:17.510> third<00:02:17.690> one

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
more reward onto my system a third one
