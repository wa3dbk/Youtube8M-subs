 the asec it is his bottom of trade he is also but mainly by his passion 

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:08.160

 belgium francophone as stéphanie intermission and joffrey lequoy explain it 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.640
 she 

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:24.989
 and according to the slangest slang word but to be able to hear this 

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:27.649
 melody there is of course at the start launch 

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:31.489
 and to train in its manufacture there is now a school in this 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:35.719
 building in motion the creator these gauthier loupe himself luthier this 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:38.070
 school they have been thinking for years 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.380
 now thanks to the support of the city of march he crosses a new 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:42.740
 step in his life 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.510
 it's dassault 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.510
 but it's not big deal 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.630
 it takes a little empty of a man - how's it going but I think 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.240
 parties that is dedicated to learning 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.450
 particular link to carrying out the work and then he would have liked a 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.680
 third part that arose was the most interesting training on 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.360
 talks about passing on his knowledge and and that knowledge and there I think that 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.330
 it was for me important to 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.430
 from where to finish to transmit formed himself in italy the luthier 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.120
 autonews en opens the only school currently in community 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.009
 French 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.539
 and the demand is there since April to four young people are already in training 

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:28.020
 two french and belgacom as joanne a young arlon carpenter there is 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.000
 finalist here his first violin 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.750
 June 11 not at the bottom of the hole 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.360
 for the world cup 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.000
 warehouses 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.990
 emporiki lasted breaking everything 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.720
 hand in hand the first experience what is the most 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:42.450
 complex 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.850
 it is much more precise 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:45.900
 still missouri so for me 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.190
 his novels are all ministers 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.670
 open to everyone from 18 years old to school teaches the basics of the profession 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.939
 of luthier four days a week 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.299
 rémy and the French has made him increase towards this domain after 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.659
 scientific studies having already benefited from ten months of training 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.209
 before school he is a bit more advanced here he finishes making 

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:06.540
 his violent third 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.439
 it's about 80 pieces come together 

00:02:09.439 --> 00:02:12.569
 so obviously there needs to be a perfect fit between the pieces because of 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.010
 there derives all the quality of the instruments but also well its 

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:17.289
 visual qualities 

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:20.199
 that name is now that the first goal is still to make a 

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:23.399
 sounding instrument although it is pleasant to the sound 

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:26.599
 if in addition it is pleasant visually is even better to learn to manufacture 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:30.439
 a violin that sounds good to develop the sensitivity of students it's 

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:31.910
 the purpose of this school 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.900
 for that three years of races are proposed it is obvious that it is 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.609
 also development opportunities 

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:39.989
 he still has a lot to learn 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:43.439
 but it's not yet with three years that we are luthier and we must continue 

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:46.439
 his training as soon as it takes ten years to do a good job 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:50.259
 read it below the construction of the instruments and once take the 

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:51.789
 restoration of these still 

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:55.079
 as a major demand in major trades 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:57.909
 and then do internships with other teachers 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:01.909
 teaching but also interested in violin making is the philosophy of the project 

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:05.989
 of gauthier loupe this workshop he wants it as a living museum accessible to the 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:06.700
 public 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.830
 on the wall we can also see explanations and violins and this is 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.140
 not just next to the workshop in the medieval turret which 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.720
 Previously housed the lace museum there is a brand new 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.579
 museum dedicated to violin making 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:21.879
 here we discover instruments that are a little 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:23.099
 the motley a little 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:27.730
 the particular some are in crisis and goodville traditional music 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.300
 other folk are instruments a little more evolved 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.740
 and we start again from the base of the origin of the instruments which would be the 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:38.970
 rca from this point of view until launch more carbon the past but 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.700
 also the present and the future at the stage one can discover the 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.180
 gauthier loupe creations 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.870
 contemporary violins that come out of the traditional shackle from the point of view of 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.580
 the form but also the technique with here for example five-string violin and 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.080
 all this violence it rings of course and the best proof is still 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.460
 to listen to a piece and to be lulled by the magic of the place said
