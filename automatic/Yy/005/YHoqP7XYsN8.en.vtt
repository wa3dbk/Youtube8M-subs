of<00:01:04.619> honey<00:01:05.189> in<00:01:05.850> here<00:01:06.229> so<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.350> purpose<00:01:07.680> were<00:01:07.860> all

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
of honey in here so the purpose were all

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.440 
of honey in here so the purpose were all
the<00:01:08.130> reason<00:01:08.610> why<00:01:08.700> we're<00:01:08.850> doing<00:01:08.939> this<00:01:09.150> is<00:01:09.210> to

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
the reason why we're doing this is to

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.780 
the reason why we're doing this is to
sweeten<00:01:09.860> the<00:01:10.860> honey<00:01:11.070> so<00:01:11.310> if<00:01:11.400> you<00:01:11.490> don't<00:01:11.670> have

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
sweeten the honey so if you don't have

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.399 
sweeten the honey so if you don't have
honey<00:01:11.970> you<00:01:12.119> could<00:01:12.240> also<00:01:12.390> use<00:01:12.570> sugar<00:01:12.960> I<00:01:13.110> guess

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
honey you could also use sugar I guess

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.670 
honey you could also use sugar I guess
or<00:01:13.590> palm<00:01:13.799> sugar<00:01:14.040> but<00:01:14.990> most<00:01:15.990> people<00:01:16.380> have<00:01:16.470> honey

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680
