00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:08.800
 hello me I got there that there is room for a cup of europe all this 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.400
 in a large part of the Arcachon Basin to start I'm going 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.600
 to be interested in a six-year-old looks complicated and he is 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.869
 I do not even know the different arteries of the east 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.889
 the Basques knew what to do a growing number 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.400
 and for three years first we will project in along the roads more 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.509
 to catch the small tubes and then bleached by the department 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.020
 it's a value that are covered with drawings alone and that we're going to them 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.130
 recover after six months we will scratch circuit 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.560
 to go recover we will place them in gray plastic pockets 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.510
 aged we are going back to the floor where he was staying 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.600
 two and a half years more 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.350
 and at the end of these three years three-four years elsewhere we will bring back his 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.730
 % reminded and calibrated gimmicks and then place them in his life 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.850
 we stayed for a few days before being marketed 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:05.060
 then 18 all these delights all night the best times anyway if the 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:06.270
 US market 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.990
 it was eating nature what then with lemon it feints scene from 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.490
 so murder down a little appetizer before going to table 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.320
 if I can you are on some exciting hockey game 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.040
 asked about the preparation 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.550
 in the fall we are in the south-west we will make a parterre of 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:46.119
 duck 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:48.310
 with a carpaccio of foie gras floods 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.610
 so then audrey during a duck tartare with cheff attafen canaries 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.540
 over crowds even carpaccio of duck foie gras to salt it and 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.380
 pepper 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.370
 we put the most difficult 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:58.620
 with the sun 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.380
 the south-west still the truffle 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.690
 stone and emmaus rosÃ© in this artery of a hot broth 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.610
 with lemongrass 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.259
 here 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.749
 personal touch personal practice and all this is very nice 

00:02:11.749 --> 00:02:14.809
 to eat with them because when one is still in a note that in 

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:17.789
 the courtroom it was interesting to put with it's a 

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:21.079
 cereals parents tile that will bring a crunchy 

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:26.309
 the recovery of the blow eat it with it is very nice audrey dana welch thank you 

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:38.489
 after this duck tartare I propose to follow him everywhere

 ornithological teich is a preserved natural area and about 110 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:46.419
 hectares there will be more than 300 species of birds such as mirrors 

00:02:46.419 --> 00:02:50.229
 but if the constraint is easy to say there is a cabal of observation his 

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:53.229
 history 

00:02:55.429 --> 00:02:58.429
 5 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:16.359
 this place has kept one side 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:19.409
 maxim tissue that is traditional is actually a holiday resort 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:36.530
 moreover be calculated 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.469
