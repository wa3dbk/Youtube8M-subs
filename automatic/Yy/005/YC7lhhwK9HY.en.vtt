yeah<00:01:31.619> I<00:01:31.649> think<00:01:31.920> this<00:01:32.189> is<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.369> lot<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:32.880> recycling

00:01:33.529 --> 00:01:33.539 
yeah I think this is a lot and recycling

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:36.080 
yeah I think this is a lot and recycling
I<00:01:34.009> think<00:01:35.009> it<00:01:35.100> needs<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.369> continue<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:35.909> it's<00:01:36.030> a

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
I think it needs to continue and it's a

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.340 
I think it needs to continue and it's a
part<00:01:36.299> of<00:01:36.329> our<00:01:36.450> future<00:01:36.600> that<00:01:36.899> we<00:01:36.990> always<00:01:37.140> have
