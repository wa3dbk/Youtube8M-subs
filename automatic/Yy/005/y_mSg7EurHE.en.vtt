think<00:01:46.360> town<00:01:46.570> I<00:01:46.899> agree<00:01:47.140> with<00:01:47.290> what<00:01:47.890> we<00:01:48.009> found

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
think town I agree with what we found

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.630 
think town I agree with what we found
sticker<00:01:48.850> here<00:01:49.060> the<00:01:49.299> tone<00:01:50.140> is<00:01:50.560> in<00:01:50.979> the<00:01:51.250> middle<00:01:51.430> I

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
sticker here the tone is in the middle I

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.430 
sticker here the tone is in the middle I
would<00:01:51.790> say<00:01:51.970> it's<00:01:52.090> not<00:01:52.299> a<00:01:52.360> bright<00:01:52.630> normal<00:01:53.020> oh<00:01:53.049> I

would say it's not a bright normal oh I

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.200 
would say it's not a bright normal oh I
think<00:01:53.920> that<00:01:54.009> touches<00:01:54.310> a<00:01:54.340> little<00:01:54.670> bit<00:01:54.790> heavier

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
think that touches a little bit heavier

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.780 
think that touches a little bit heavier
than<00:01:55.240> 55<00:01:56.140> so<00:01:56.380> you<00:01:56.440> give<00:01:56.710> it<00:01:56.830> a<00:01:56.890> six<00:01:57.130> yeah<00:01:57.490> fine

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790
