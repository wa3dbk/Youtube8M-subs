00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.670 

with<00:00:07.760> the<00:00:07.880> advent<00:00:08.149> of<00:00:08.270> tribe<00:00:08.570> bikes<00:00:08.840> there<00:00:09.590> was

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:09.680 
with the advent of tribe bikes there was

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.680 
with the advent of tribe bikes there was
a<00:00:09.710> big<00:00:09.920> explosion<00:00:10.070> in<00:00:10.700> body<00:00:10.910> positions<00:00:11.540> and

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:11.690 
a big explosion in body positions and

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:13.150 
a big explosion in body positions and
the<00:00:11.780> explosion<00:00:12.290> was<00:00:12.440> is<00:00:12.620> that<00:00:12.650> a<00:00:12.800> lot<00:00:12.980> of<00:00:13.040> the

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:13.160 
the explosion was is that a lot of the

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.890 
the explosion was is that a lot of the
athletes<00:00:13.519> started<00:00:13.880> sliding<00:00:14.300> even<00:00:14.630> further

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:14.900 
athletes started sliding even further

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.990 
athletes started sliding even further
forward<00:00:15.590> on<00:00:15.740> their<00:00:16.189> try<00:00:16.460> bikes<00:00:16.700> well<00:00:16.849> let<00:00:16.939> me

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:17.000 
forward on their try bikes well let me

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.179 
forward on their try bikes well let me
just<00:00:17.060> explain<00:00:17.270> very<00:00:18.050> briefly<00:00:18.080> what<00:00:18.860> the<00:00:18.950> tri

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:19.189 
just explain very briefly what the tri

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:21.189 
just explain very briefly what the tri
bike<00:00:19.369> is<00:00:19.640> first<00:00:20.060> obviously<00:00:20.750> it's<00:00:20.930> the<00:00:21.050> Aero

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:21.199 
bike is first obviously it's the Aero

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:23.800 
bike is first obviously it's the Aero
bars<00:00:21.410> secondly<00:00:22.400> it's<00:00:22.640> the<00:00:22.940> seat<00:00:23.240> tube<00:00:23.270> angle

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:23.810 
bars secondly it's the seat tube angle

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.050 
bars secondly it's the seat tube angle
in<00:00:24.199> the<00:00:24.289> seat<00:00:24.529> tube<00:00:24.560> angle<00:00:25.070> runs<00:00:25.789> right<00:00:26.029> down

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:26.060 
in the seat tube angle runs right down

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.210 
in the seat tube angle runs right down
underneath<00:00:26.240> the<00:00:26.750> seat<00:00:26.960> post<00:00:27.199> that<00:00:27.800> angle

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
underneath the seat post that angle

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.790 
underneath the seat post that angle
became<00:00:28.550> more<00:00:28.789> forward<00:00:29.300> road<00:00:29.900> geometry<00:00:30.770> is

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800 
became more forward road geometry is

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.220 
became more forward road geometry is
typically<00:00:31.310> around<00:00:31.550> 73<00:00:32.150> degrees<00:00:32.510> and<00:00:32.750> try

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.230 
typically around 73 degrees and try

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.530 
typically around 73 degrees and try
bikes<00:00:33.500> around<00:00:33.680> 76<00:00:34.489> all<00:00:34.730> the<00:00:35.000> way<00:00:35.120> up<00:00:35.239> to<00:00:35.269> 80

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 
bikes around 76 all the way up to 80

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.840 
bikes around 76 all the way up to 80
degrees<00:00:35.960> so<00:00:36.260> it<00:00:36.290> effectively<00:00:36.890> pushes<00:00:37.700> your

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
degrees so it effectively pushes your

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.720 
degrees so it effectively pushes your
hips<00:00:38.059> further<00:00:38.450> forward<00:00:39.140> so<00:00:39.559> that<00:00:39.590> it<00:00:40.100> opens<00:00:40.579> up

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
hips further forward so that it opens up

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.150 
hips further forward so that it opens up
this<00:00:40.940> hip<00:00:41.210> angle<00:00:41.480> well<00:00:42.200> the<00:00:42.320> disadvantage<00:00:42.980> for

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 
this hip angle well the disadvantage for

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.979 
this hip angle well the disadvantage for
triathletes<00:00:43.610> in<00:00:43.790> doing<00:00:44.059> that<00:00:44.210> is<00:00:44.420> that<00:00:44.870> you

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
triathletes in doing that is that you

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:47.110 
triathletes in doing that is that you
cannot<00:00:45.469> generate<00:00:45.980> power<00:00:46.309> out<00:00:46.550> of<00:00:46.579> your<00:00:46.790> glutes

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
cannot generate power out of your glutes

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.660 
cannot generate power out of your glutes
and<00:00:47.390> so<00:00:48.020> my<00:00:48.170> recommendation<00:00:48.350> is<00:00:48.980> for<00:00:49.219> a<00:00:49.399> lot<00:00:49.550> of

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
and so my recommendation is for a lot of

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.369 
and so my recommendation is for a lot of
the<00:00:49.730> triathletes<00:00:50.270> if<00:00:50.420> you<00:00:50.600> don't<00:00:50.809> feel<00:00:51.110> any

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:51.379 
the triathletes if you don't feel any

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:54.040 
the triathletes if you don't feel any
glute<00:00:51.770> 42<00:00:52.250> your<00:00:52.790> rides<00:00:53.030> and<00:00:53.360> certainly<00:00:53.930> the

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
glute 42 your rides and certainly the

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:55.869 
glute 42 your rides and certainly the
offseason<00:00:54.680> that<00:00:54.800> you<00:00:55.160> want<00:00:55.399> to<00:00:55.460> consider

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:55.879 
offseason that you want to consider

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:58.330 
offseason that you want to consider
going<00:00:56.180> to<00:00:56.329> a<00:00:56.480> row<00:00:56.960> geometry<00:00:57.649> now<00:00:58.039> that<00:00:58.190> doesn't

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
going to a row geometry now that doesn't

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.010 
going to a row geometry now that doesn't
mean<00:00:58.460> that<00:00:58.550> you<00:00:58.730> have<00:00:58.789> to<00:00:58.940> buy<00:00:59.180> another<00:00:59.210> bike<00:00:59.719> a

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
mean that you have to buy another bike a

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:01.540 
mean that you have to buy another bike a
lot<00:01:00.469> of<00:01:00.559> the<00:01:00.620> seat<00:01:00.829> tubes<00:01:01.100> come<00:01:01.370> with<00:01:01.520> a

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
lot of the seat tubes come with a

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.430 
lot of the seat tubes come with a
two-way<00:01:02.000> seat<00:01:02.300> post<00:01:02.570> so<00:01:02.750> you<00:01:02.840> can<00:01:02.960> go<00:01:03.110> from<00:01:03.289> a

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:03.440 
two-way seat post so you can go from a

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.400 
two-way seat post so you can go from a
76<00:01:04.039> degree<00:01:04.369> to<00:01:04.940> a<00:01:04.970> 73<00:01:05.660> degree<00:01:05.960> just<00:01:06.229> by

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:06.410 
76 degree to a 73 degree just by

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.770 
76 degree to a 73 degree just by
shifting<00:01:06.470> the<00:01:07.039> seat<00:01:07.250> post<00:01:07.460> if<00:01:07.940> we<00:01:08.180> start<00:01:08.420> Julie

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
shifting the seat post if we start Julie

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.260 
shifting the seat post if we start Julie
in<00:01:08.960> the<00:01:09.319> typical<00:01:09.770> try<00:01:10.069> position<00:01:10.850> she's<00:01:11.060> in<00:01:11.090> a

in the typical try position she's in a
normal<00:01:11.600> position<00:01:11.720> she's<00:01:12.170> sitting<00:01:12.440> at<00:01:12.560> the

00:01:12.669 --> 00:01:12.679 
normal position she's sitting at the

this we want to make sure that her

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.969 
this we want to make sure that her
pelvis<00:01:17.450> is<00:01:17.600> set<00:01:17.750> so<00:01:17.899> we<00:01:17.990> rotate<00:01:18.350> her<00:01:18.410> pelvis<00:01:18.800> up

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
pelvis is set so we rotate her pelvis up

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:21.520 
pelvis is set so we rotate her pelvis up

are already in that position and we can

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:29.290 
are already in that position and we can
take<00:01:27.860> advantage<00:01:28.310> of<00:01:28.369> it<00:01:28.490> by<00:01:28.640> even<00:01:28.940> sliding

Julie<00:01:35.300> back<00:01:35.450> just<00:01:35.840> an<00:01:35.959> inch<00:01:36.170> or<00:01:36.349> so<00:01:36.590> and<00:01:36.800> that's

00:01:37.089 --> 00:01:37.099 
Julie back just an inch or so and that's

00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:39.279 
Julie back just an inch or so and that's
quite<00:01:37.250> a<00:01:37.340> bit<00:01:37.640> what<00:01:38.330> will<00:01:38.509> happen<00:01:38.869> is<00:01:38.990> that<00:01:39.140> it

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:39.289 
quite a bit what will happen is that it

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:41.290 
quite a bit what will happen is that it
will<00:01:39.380> help<00:01:39.590> innervate<00:01:40.039> her<00:01:40.190> glutes<00:01:40.520> on<00:01:40.789> that

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:41.300 
will help innervate her glutes on that

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.529 
will help innervate her glutes on that
down<00:01:41.569> pedal<00:01:42.229> stroke<00:01:42.500> of<00:01:42.740> her<00:01:42.950> pedal<00:01:43.250> cycle<00:01:43.729> we

happens is that the ball of the foot is

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.000 
happens is that the ball of the foot is
