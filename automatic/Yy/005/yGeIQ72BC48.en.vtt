all told they have to take your

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.469 
all told they have to take your
standardized<00:01:06.190> tests<00:01:06.610> that<00:01:06.729> learn<00:01:07.030> one<00:01:07.300> way

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:07.479 
standardized tests that learn one way

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:08.609 
standardized tests that learn one way
but<00:01:07.690> we<00:01:07.780> all<00:01:07.869> have<00:01:07.899> to<00:01:08.110> learn<00:01:08.229> differently

own<00:01:12.820> individuality<00:01:13.240> how<00:01:13.600> to<00:01:13.659> learn<00:01:13.840> how<00:01:14.080> I

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
own individuality how to learn how I

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.289 
own individuality how to learn how I
should<00:01:14.290> learn<00:01:14.619> individually<00:01:15.310> and<00:01:15.490> of<00:01:16.090> course

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:16.299 
should learn individually and of course
