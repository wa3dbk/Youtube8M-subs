00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.000
 the next to diego one with us 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.800
 short afk 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.779
 Nevertheless, crass Pusch looks extremely 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:26.669
 2 is aggressive fashion the flesh 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:28.230
 stairs leading to the second window 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:30.630
 played in the third game with 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.099
 pushed down and banal and through the 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:38.399
 they were able to play an extremely defensive game 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:40.670
 just do nothing then it's over 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.780
 if we now like normal steam or 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.430
 normal state played an injured 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.600
 Man in the middle tries channel 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.699
 then we would have the round 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.859
 definitely lost with the two flash 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:52.410
 is one just so blind one becomes from 

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:53.879
 Pushed both sides and that is one 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.170
 very big risk especially if the cd 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.620
 to have the good sport put this 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.039
 case may have had it all 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.239
 quickly get in the eye 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:05.160
 in this case, it's just wrong now 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.690
 Stake out with lekkerland stairs 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.690
 bit banana is often aggressive 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.409
 simply terrible about that 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.030
 banana a 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:16.350
 can from me from the beginning already 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.570
 much to 1 play speak on the 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.800
 small and four on the big one and we 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.630
 Focus on us first again 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.890
 house on the wallpaper try there the 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.700
 it is reason to push back opponents 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.740
 just like pistor and just slow 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.710
 this controls the building game over 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.060
 The wrong middle house and wallpaper gang 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.920
 and if we are taken all year 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.730
 will have is precisely the tactics 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.650
 what we try to do and then 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:42.840
 Doris take over again the smog is off 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.720
 keep the opponent and actually pulled 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.430
 23 to play for as long as the banana 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.570
 not with a person and then 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.290
 nothing can button what he told me the book 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.640
 can not do 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.330
 he could at most through this must 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.980
 button yes the thing is forced 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:00.470
 a second game otherwise you lose and 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:00.470
 we are now doing the picture on c bow 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.050
 rather threesome that was stupid now that 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.930
 that george danzer buchrain has run 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:14.810
 Were going to have a spot and be outside 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.790
 can play but and two next 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.400
 games you can already see the tactics of 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.810
 Six has played this construction is in 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.770
 It's such a departure in which we too 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:26.750
 like to play two times in the sandbox 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.520
 we could play 21 on the box 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:32.210
 a city ​​arch and the round you can 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.970
 actually only win 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:36.320
 if you just split over in the over 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:40.700
 Exercises also do what we did 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:42.590
 my problem was as I said that has 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.940
 the initiative rhine raced and then 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.680
 counts the best was killed by 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.390
 if he just goes through like yes 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:52.160
 all three of us through the spot 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:54.410
 back through and have the two players 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.360
 In the sandbox, you are virtually surrounded by one 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:01.090
 the action of one of the wallpapers like three 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.090
 Overlong, the cd overlaps more or less 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.390
 I took the first game outside the first game 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:05.810
 have a second from the game 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.510
 took 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:11.450
 when george is who wrote 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:14.750
 then we have, so to speak, 3 against 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.620
 there on the spot yes and then 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.150
 we on the athletic opponent 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.870
 move as you want then you can 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.970
 the round actually no longer 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.780
 Losing the mistake will make that mistake 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.780
 has cost us the round
