00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
made deflate of course because we've

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.349 
made deflate of course because we've
just<00:03:01.919> added<00:03:02.129> that<00:03:02.489> heavy<00:03:02.730> edition<00:03:03.239> of

chocolate in there that's normal

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.550 
chocolate in there that's normal
I'm<00:03:08.430> going<00:03:08.669> to<00:03:08.790> add<00:03:08.939> in<00:03:09.269> my<00:03:09.540> vanilla<00:03:10.049> with<00:03:10.349> my

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
I'm going to add in my vanilla with my

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.179 
I'm going to add in my vanilla with my
buttermilk<00:03:12.169> only<00:03:13.169> because<00:03:13.469> I<00:03:13.560> forgot<00:03:13.859> to<00:03:13.919> put

00:03:14.179 --> 00:03:14.189 
buttermilk only because I forgot to put

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:16.459 
buttermilk only because I forgot to put
it<00:03:14.310> in<00:03:14.400> with<00:03:14.549> the<00:03:14.699> chocolate<00:03:15.109> now<00:03:16.109> we're<00:03:16.290> going

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:16.469 
it in with the chocolate now we're going

00:03:16.469 --> 00:03:18.559 
it in with the chocolate now we're going
to<00:03:16.739> alternate<00:03:17.430> the<00:03:17.579> dry<00:03:17.879> with<00:03:18.150> the<00:03:18.299> buttermilk

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:18.569 
to alternate the dry with the buttermilk

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:45.940 
to alternate the dry with the buttermilk
and<00:03:18.930> then<00:03:19.139> we're<00:03:19.349> done

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.059 

so<00:03:46.459> this<00:03:46.910> is<00:03:47.090> actually<00:03:47.660> quite<00:03:47.900> a<00:03:48.020> liquid<00:03:48.680> mix

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:49.069 
so this is actually quite a liquid mix

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:51.880 
so this is actually quite a liquid mix

cupcakes but if you guys wanted to make
layer<00:03:59.390> cakes<00:03:59.780> then<00:04:00.050> you're<00:04:00.319> going<00:04:00.530> to<00:04:00.739> use<00:04:00.920> all

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
layer cakes then you're going to use all

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.070 
layer cakes then you're going to use all
of<00:04:01.190> this<00:04:01.489> powder<00:04:01.760> between<00:04:02.300> two<00:04:02.569> eight<00:04:02.810> inch

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 
of this powder between two eight inch

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.380 
of this powder between two eight inch
pans<00:04:03.500> and<00:04:03.800> you're<00:04:04.130> going<00:04:04.250> to<00:04:04.280> get<00:04:04.459> two<00:04:04.790> really

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.390 
pans and you're going to get two really

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:20.469 
pans and you're going to get two really
nice<00:04:05.600> thick<00:04:06.110> layers<00:04:18.700> so<00:04:19.700> I<00:04:19.729> have<00:04:20.150> my<00:04:20.299> oven

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:20.479 
nice thick layers so I have my oven

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:24.219 
nice thick layers so I have my oven
preheated<00:04:21.139> to<00:04:21.550> 350<00:04:22.550> degrees<00:04:22.580> and<00:04:23.300> if<00:04:24.020> you're

00:04:24.219 --> 00:04:24.229 
preheated to 350 degrees and if you're

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:26.469 
preheated to 350 degrees and if you're
making<00:04:24.410> the<00:04:24.740> 8-inch<00:04:25.340> layer<00:04:25.729> cakes<00:04:26.120> they're

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:28.270 
making the 8-inch layer cakes they're
probably<00:04:26.690> going<00:04:27.139> to<00:04:27.260> take<00:04:27.470> about<00:04:27.710> 40<00:04:28.250> minutes

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280
