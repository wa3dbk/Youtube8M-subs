00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:09.300
 ordinary people live a normal life 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.179
 successful people they live differently they 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:15.179
 live the inner life they live the same 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:19.039
 life in which nobody knows this life 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:22.320
 happens and during cooking 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:25.070
 or during work it happens early 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.199
 in the morning when ordinary people in the heart 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.939
 when early in the morning clearly scatter yandon 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.690
 why so fool woke up these lectures 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.969
 I heard enough to just go on sleeping 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:38.040
 less and lilac finish just this 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.379
 time to work or is intended to 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.540
 life you understand because our whole 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.149
 the work we do all our 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.910
 doing this in gray is just maintaining 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.309
 its existence no development in 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.739
 this is no you do not gain new experience 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.989
 who needs this new experience to win 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.140
 being acquired while you are not 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.270
 live a normal life and live another 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.719
 and so when a person is early in the morning 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:06.510
 rises and begins this prayer he in 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.340
 this time creates another 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.229
 space of life which is more 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.869
 powerful thousands of times 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.990
 something which he now has will come 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.890
 time his life dramatically 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.890
 will change without a doubt 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.270
 if you talk about me then I am a vivid example 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:28.880
 this situation was not at all hopeless 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.830
 that is, I even have my parents 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.530
 even had no higher education 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:36.230
 I even got to college was extremely 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.479
 difficult there are three people in place for 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:41.810
 I understand a lot nobody denezhek 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:46.040
 I could not pay for it and just 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:51.770
 internal strength I got there internally 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:53.450
 strength and there i am using inner strength 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.020
 did so i had a diploma with 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.500
 honors 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.780
 and then I did not act because I 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.460
 it was necessary to learn one subject so that 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.680
 get the top five then there were such 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.960
 rules of warmth with honors plus five 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:09.979
 on one subject all people entered 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.700
 I had no doubt that I received 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.239
 this top five 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:17.390
 that is, I taught physics, I just did 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:19.790
 parallel to self-improvement i 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.290
 did what i understand i understood that everything 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.850
 depends on it completely by itself 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.850
 some perfection gave me strength 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.910
 Adam did not pull out the first ticket right away to me 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.739
 had to prove 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:35.030
 several two or three ways 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:37.190
 Ohm's law I proved five when he 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:40.450
 asked me this teacher you here you 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:45.450
 see here are two ways and you get 5 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:48.220
 I took my deduced I did not give up even 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:53.019
 The following two questions are not answered, I 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:55.800
 answered only one question 1 1 exam 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:58.900
 got the top five went to college 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:03.430
 what it cost me huge internal 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:05.500
 effort preparing me was adamant 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.420
 faith that everything will turn out when I came and 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.780
 looked at him she had no doubt 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.760
 what will I do 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.470
 I have already arrived before I went there 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.330
 this one in this exam room 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.519
 try to understand it as a person 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.319
 should residents need to commit 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:23.880
 internal activity earlier than 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:23.880
 performed externally
