00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:13.410
 Came into my life 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:14.410
 Now, all is right. 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:15.410
 My dreams will be heard 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:16.410
 I will rise. 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.410
 [Chorus:] Cause I have this voice inside 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:18.410
 I can't do it 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:19.410
 I know what I can get through it. 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.410
 I'll reach for the stars 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:21.410
 Right from the start, I felt it in my heart 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:22.410
 I knew that deep inside We'll never be torn apart 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.410
 If I believe it 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:24.410
 I'll achieve it. 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:25.410
 I will be here today 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.410
 I won't be afraid. 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:27.410
 I lose my sound 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:28.410
 No I won't look down. 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.410
 [Chorus:] Cause I have this voice inside 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:30.410
 I can't do it 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:31.410
 I know that I can get through it. 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:01:11.110
 I'll reach for the stars 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:12.570
 Right from the start, I felt it in my heart 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.740
 I knew that deep inside We'll never be torn apart 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:14.800
 If I believe it 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:15.800
 I'll achieve it. 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:16.800
 Deep in my heart 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.560
 I knew that I would go far 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.247
 If I believe it, I will achieve it. 

00:01:24.247 --> 00:01:51.530
 I can reach the stars.
