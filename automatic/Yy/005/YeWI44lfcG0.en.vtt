00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:04.060
 Hi everyone of the world rubber market 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:06.040
 This theme is 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.959
 Two footwork that will be here 

00:00:08.959 --> 00:00:11.309
 I would like to introduce you 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.849
 In the practice of two two two fore two back two 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:20.060
 The three ways of practicing according to the play style 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:26.410
 I would like to introduce to you two two two fore 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.669
 Practice of these two books called back back 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:32.840
 It is a very versatile and versatile one 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.170
 Many of the top players almost all 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.580
 There has been no problem with players 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:46.530
 I think it is a method of practice The great part of this practice is 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.080
 One menu that balls are distributed 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.120
 If there is only one type, three ways 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.960
 It is in the place where you can choose 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.010
 It's good and we divide the three ways into a few minutes 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.930
 Or try it in combination 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.000
 It's good and it's great in many ways 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.240
 It's a great all-rounder way to practice 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.810
 Then I would like to introduce that method. 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:20.810
 First of all move to the distribution of these two 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.080
 Practice method is all-for-all 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.860
 The ball forehand came to the fore 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.030
 Go around a big forehand 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.170
 Forehand forehand 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.440
 It's a way to do it all the way 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.909
 Here is where the movement is big first 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:41.590
 All forefooted because it is all forehand 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:49.479
 If you want to wear it is a wraparound movement 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:52.400
 As we go from the fore side to the back side greatly 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.620
 Even for those who want to strengthen the wraparound movement 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.500
 I highly recommend it 

00:02:27.779 --> 00:02:34.620
 Next is the second method The second method is the foreground 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.400
 It is against two each of distribution by the thing called back 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.129
 It is a method of using the forehand and the backhand straightly 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:47.779
 This method is a switch-oriented method 

00:02:47.779 --> 00:02:50.959
 If you are doing this in the foreground 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:54.329
 Because it can be done at a distance close to a great close distance stand 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:56.849
 I want to learn fast pitch switching 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:59.909
 Or practice to shake more and more with both hand attacks 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:02.100
 It is highly recommended for those who want to 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:35.449
 Finally the third method The third method 

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:37.900
 It feels like I mixed the first and second 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:44.980
 I will wrap around last in the foreground 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.919
 It is a kind of movement Foreback wraparound 

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:52.760
 This is the practice of the order 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.949
 As a recommendation person, it is switch plus jump 

00:03:57.949 --> 00:04:00.519
 For those who want to remember the big jump to the fore 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:05.739
 It is very recommended what this movement is 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:08.870
 It is a place that is this jumping up 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.339
 I will wrap around after hitting this practice back 

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:17.109
 So it's easy to go around and get out of the body 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:20.129
 It is easy to escape outside 

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:22.470
 The move to the fore because it escapes outside 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.099
 Use it in reverse as it will be a bit tougher 

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:29.039
 It is a method of hitting when you train the jump 

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:33.020
 The foreback side is also in the movement of the foreground 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:37.000
 As I stop my legs once, I'm going to the next foremost 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.020
 It's easy to go, but with this move it's back with force 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.919
 I'm going to get bigger, so I'll take the next jump 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:46.169
 In that it can be trained reversely 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:49.000
 It is recommended way
