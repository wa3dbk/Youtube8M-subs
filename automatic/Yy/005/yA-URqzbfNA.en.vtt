going<00:00:07.350> to<00:00:07.470> do<00:00:07.620> a<00:00:07.649> little<00:00:07.890> demo<00:00:08.340> of<00:00:08.370> my<00:00:08.820> little

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:09.410 
going to do a little demo of my little

going to do a little demo of my little
miniature<00:00:10.410> indoor<00:00:11.210> model<00:00:12.210> of<00:00:12.450> a<00:00:13.639> American

signal T 128 outdoor warning siren this
is<00:00:20.160> a<00:00:20.189> little<00:00:20.490> model<00:00:20.850> i<00:00:20.939> construct<00:00:21.539> it<00:00:21.779> and<00:00:22.050> see

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
is a little model i construct it and see

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.769 
is a little model i construct it and see
the<00:00:22.500> little<00:00:22.650> speaker<00:00:23.250> there<00:00:23.510> still<00:00:24.510> got<00:00:24.630> to<00:00:24.689> do

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
the little speaker there still got to do

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.990 
the little speaker there still got to do
the<00:00:24.810> motorization<00:00:25.710> part<00:00:25.949> of<00:00:26.130> it<00:00:26.279> but<00:00:26.460> top<00:00:26.730> does

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
the motorization part of it but top does

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.910 
the motorization part of it but top does
rotate<00:00:27.529> but<00:00:28.529> anyway<00:00:29.099> I<00:00:29.390> made<00:00:30.390> this<00:00:30.740> you<00:00:31.740> can

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
rotate but anyway I made this you can

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.790 
rotate but anyway I made this you can
see<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.250> little<00:00:32.989> driver<00:00:33.989> circuitry<00:00:34.559> down

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
see the little driver circuitry down

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.389 
see the little driver circuitry down
here<00:00:35.250> that<00:00:35.700> switched<00:00:36.360> over<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:37.399> plug-in

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
here that switched over to a plug-in

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.160 
here that switched over to a plug-in
power<00:00:38.790> packed<00:00:39.210> as<00:00:39.540> I<00:00:39.780> was<00:00:39.899> going<00:00:40.050> through

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
power packed as I was going through

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.830 
power packed as I was going through
batteries<00:00:40.680> kind<00:00:40.920> of<00:00:41.010> quick<00:00:41.219> hence<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.120> empty

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
batteries kind of quick hence the empty

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.500 
batteries kind of quick hence the empty
battery<00:00:43.140> pack<00:00:43.620> but<00:00:44.250> basically<00:00:44.430> it<00:00:44.879> is<00:00:45.030> set<00:00:45.300> up

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
battery pack but basically it is set up

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.180 
battery pack but basically it is set up
so<00:00:45.750> that<00:00:46.079> when<00:00:46.649> this<00:00:47.250> weather<00:00:47.789> radio<00:00:48.270> is

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
so that when this weather radio is

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.389 
so that when this weather radio is
triggered<00:00:50.190> by<00:00:50.219> an<00:00:50.730> alert<00:00:51.090> signal<00:00:51.660> such<00:00:51.930> as<00:00:52.110> a

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:52.399 
triggered by an alert signal such as a

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:57.470 
triggered by an alert signal such as a
tornado<00:00:53.399> warning<00:00:54.390> or<00:00:54.690> watch<00:00:55.079> it<00:00:56.030> has<00:00:57.030> an<00:00:57.210> alarm

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
tornado warning or watch it has an alarm

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.119 
tornado warning or watch it has an alarm
output<00:00:58.140> which<00:00:58.710> turns<00:00:59.699> on<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.120> siren<00:01:00.390> and

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.129 
output which turns on the siren and

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:03.380 
output which turns on the siren and
basically<00:01:02.129> I<00:01:02.370> get<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:02.640> little<00:01:02.910> bit<00:01:03.030> of<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.120> sound

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
basically I get a little bit of a sound

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:25.450 
basically I get a little bit of a sound
like<00:01:03.840> this

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.670 

anyway<00:01:26.460> it's<00:01:26.700> got<00:01:26.909> about<00:01:27.150> a<00:01:27.210> 20<00:01:27.720> second<00:01:28.200> sample

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
anyway it's got about a 20 second sample

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.090 
anyway it's got about a 20 second sample
on<00:01:28.860> there<00:01:29.189> so<00:01:29.810> here's<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.990> other<00:01:31.170> sound<00:01:31.680> I

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
on there so here's the other sound I

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.460 
on there so here's the other sound I
kind<00:01:32.970> of<00:01:33.000> like<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.570> other<00:01:33.720> one<00:01:33.930> better<00:01:34.080> but

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
kind of like the other one better but

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:56.640 
kind of like the other one better but
here<00:01:34.830> it<00:01:34.979> goes

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.650 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.820 

and<00:01:57.650> there<00:01:58.400> you<00:01:58.580> have<00:01:58.790> it
