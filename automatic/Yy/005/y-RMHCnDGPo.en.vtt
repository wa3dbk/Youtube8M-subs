birthday on a single day well there's a
brand<00:00:07.319> new<00:00:07.440> table<00:00:07.919> salt<00:00:08.099> in<00:00:08.340> my<00:00:08.429> workshop

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:09.590 
brand new table salt in my workshop

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:11.629 
brand new table salt in my workshop
obviously<00:00:10.590> the<00:00:10.710> first<00:00:10.889> thing<00:00:11.190> to<00:00:11.340> do<00:00:11.460> is

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
obviously the first thing to do is

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:25.519 
obviously the first thing to do is
unpacked<00:00:12.450> it<00:00:12.660> and<00:00:12.840> put<00:00:13.259> it<00:00:13.380> together<00:00:24.529> last

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
unpacked it and put it together last

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.890 
unpacked it and put it together last
thing<00:00:25.769> to<00:00:25.920> do<00:00:26.070> was<00:00:26.400> hook<00:00:27.000> it<00:00:27.180> up<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:27.570> my<00:00:27.599> shock

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
thing to do was hook it up to my shock

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.349 
thing to do was hook it up to my shock
pack<00:00:28.170> that's<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.830> piece<00:00:29.099> that<00:00:29.340> goes<00:00:29.490> into<00:00:30.029> the

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
pack that's the piece that goes into the

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.580 
pack that's the piece that goes into the
table<00:00:30.689> saw<00:00:30.840> and<00:00:31.050> that's<00:00:31.890> my<00:00:32.099> short<00:00:32.279> Bank<00:00:32.579> and

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:33.590 
table saw and that's my short Bank and

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.979 
table saw and that's my short Bank and
well<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.950> shock<00:00:35.160> backhoes<00:00:35.579> is<00:00:35.850> much<00:00:36.660> smaller

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
well the shock backhoes is much smaller

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.080 
well the shock backhoes is much smaller
no<00:00:37.380> problem<00:00:37.829> I<00:00:38.120> will<00:00:39.120> use<00:00:39.780> one<00:00:40.079> of<00:00:40.110> my<00:00:40.320> adapters

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
no problem I will use one of my adapters

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.150 
no problem I will use one of my adapters
but<00:00:43.129> they<00:00:44.129> are<00:00:44.190> either<00:00:44.340> too<00:00:44.640> big<00:00:44.850> or<00:00:44.960> too<00:00:45.960> small

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160 
but they are either too big or too small

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.680 
but they are either too big or too small
let's<00:00:47.160> write<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.640> hardware<00:00:47.940> store<00:00:48.210> but

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
let's write to the hardware store but

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.770 
let's write to the hardware store but
bad<00:00:49.289> luck<00:00:49.559> I<00:00:49.860> tried<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.670> number<00:00:50.820> of<00:00:51.120> adapters

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
bad luck I tried the number of adapters

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.709 
bad luck I tried the number of adapters
and<00:00:52.110> PVC<00:00:52.559> fittings<00:00:53.219> but<00:00:53.670> none<00:00:53.969> of<00:00:54.000> them<00:00:54.300> solved

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
and PVC fittings but none of them solved

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.020 
and PVC fittings but none of them solved
the<00:00:54.840> problem<00:00:55.230> so<00:00:55.890> it<00:00:56.250> got<00:00:56.370> obvious<00:00:56.760> that<00:00:57.000> I

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
the problem so it got obvious that I

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.779 
the problem so it got obvious that I
have<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:57.420> build<00:00:57.600> something<00:00:57.989> myself<00:00:58.430> the<00:00:59.430> idea

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
have to build something myself the idea

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.170 
have to build something myself the idea
is<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.210> work<00:01:00.539> with<00:01:00.809> four<00:01:01.410> pieces<00:01:02.010> of<00:01:02.250> wood<00:01:02.579> the

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
is to work with four pieces of wood the

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.960 
is to work with four pieces of wood the
first<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.870> last<00:01:04.049> one<00:01:04.409> have<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.339> diameter

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
first and the last one have the diameter

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.560 
first and the last one have the diameter
of<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.540> table<00:01:07.110> saw<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.770> shopvac<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.610> in

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
of the table saw and the shopvac and in

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.649 
of the table saw and the shopvac and in
between<00:01:09.750> I'm<00:01:10.549> going<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.700> cut<00:01:11.909> out<00:01:12.090> tapered

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
between I'm going to cut out tapered

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:18.100 
between I'm going to cut out tapered
circles<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.530> bridge<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:14.150> diamonds

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:44.240 

you

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.770 

next<00:01:45.250> I<00:01:45.370> have<00:01:45.460> to<00:01:45.550> find<00:01:45.820> the<00:01:46.120> correct<00:01:46.570> angle

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
next I have to find the correct angle

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.470 
next I have to find the correct angle
for<00:01:47.140> the<00:01:47.230> taper<00:01:47.680> cuts<00:01:47.920> I'm<00:01:48.220> writing<00:01:48.910> down<00:01:48.940> all

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:49.480 
for the taper cuts I'm writing down all

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.410 
for the taper cuts I'm writing down all
the<00:01:50.110> dimensions<00:01:50.830> and<00:01:51.160> use<00:01:51.490> the<00:01:51.820> tangent

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
the dimensions and use the tangent

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.650 
the dimensions and use the tangent
function<00:01:52.650> to<00:01:53.650> find<00:01:53.890> that<00:01:54.220> I<00:01:54.280> have<00:01:54.640> to<00:01:54.940> set<00:01:55.450> the

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:55.660 
function to find that I have to set the

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.440 
function to find that I have to set the
scroll<00:01:55.960> saw<00:01:55.990> to<00:01:56.530> 14<00:01:57.010> degrees<00:01:57.370> if<00:01:58.090> you<00:01:58.240> don't

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
scroll saw to 14 degrees if you don't

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.050 
scroll saw to 14 degrees if you don't
like<00:01:58.660> the<00:01:58.840> mask<00:01:59.020> you<00:01:59.410> can<00:01:59.710> also<00:02:00.160> draw<00:02:00.550> a<00:02:00.580> one<00:02:00.790> by

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
like the mask you can also draw a one by

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.170 
like the mask you can also draw a one by
one<00:02:01.090> plan<00:02:01.630> and<00:02:01.990> just<00:02:02.860> measure<00:02:03.160> the<00:02:03.520> angle<00:02:03.940> with

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
one plan and just measure the angle with

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:54.830 
one plan and just measure the angle with
a<00:02:04.210> protractor

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.900 

to<00:02:55.840> get<00:02:55.989> the<00:02:56.110> diameter<00:02:56.739> of<00:02:56.770> the<00:02:57.280> second

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
to get the diameter of the second

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.960 
to get the diameter of the second
tapered<00:02:58.510> circle<00:02:59.020> I'm<00:02:59.230> transferring<00:03:00.069> it<00:03:00.640> from

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
tapered circle I'm transferring it from

00:03:00.970 --> 00:04:37.590 
tapered circle I'm transferring it from
the<00:03:01.150> first<00:03:01.420> one

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.850 

since<00:04:38.600> they're<00:04:38.840> like<00:04:38.960> very<00:04:39.230> much<00:04:39.440> out<00:04:39.710> is

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
since they're like very much out is

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.950 
since they're like very much out is
turned<00:04:40.100> out<00:04:40.310> I<00:04:40.340> made<00:04:40.730> a<00:04:40.760> second<00:04:41.180> one<00:04:41.330> for<00:04:41.780> my

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 
turned out I made a second one for my

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.740 
turned out I made a second one for my
bandsaw<00:04:42.350> and<00:04:42.830> finally<00:04:43.490> paint<00:04:43.850> them<00:04:44.180> red<00:04:44.210> which

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
bandsaw and finally paint them red which

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.810 
bandsaw and finally paint them red which
makes<00:04:45.080> it<00:04:45.230> easier<00:04:45.620> to<00:04:45.650> find<00:04:46.160> them<00:04:46.340> again<00:04:46.370> in

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820 
makes it easier to find them again in

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.880 
makes it easier to find them again in
the<00:04:46.940> workshop<00:04:47.360> the<00:04:47.630> big<00:04:47.780> party<00:04:48.200> had<00:04:48.500> to<00:04:48.710> wait
