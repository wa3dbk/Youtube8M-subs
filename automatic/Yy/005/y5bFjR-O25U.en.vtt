throughout<00:02:23.680> the<00:02:23.830> game<00:02:23.920> just<00:02:24.820> randomly<00:02:25.330> scary

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
throughout the game just randomly scary

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.750 
throughout the game just randomly scary
I<00:02:25.960> think<00:02:26.200> he's<00:02:26.320> just<00:02:26.410> randomly<00:02:26.920> scary<00:02:27.340> to<00:02:27.730> be

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
I think he's just randomly scary to be

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.130 
I think he's just randomly scary to be
honest<00:02:28.030> to<00:02:28.120> use<00:02:28.270> it<00:02:28.390> I<00:02:28.480> mean<00:02:28.630> it<00:02:28.780> does<00:02:28.930> look

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
honest to use it I mean it does look

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.930 
honest to use it I mean it does look
like<00:02:29.260> a<00:02:29.320> really<00:02:29.920> really<00:02:30.130> hungover<00:02:30.460> run<00:02:30.820> at

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
like a really really hungover run at

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.790 
like a really really hungover run at
Madonna<00:02:31.210> you<00:02:31.450> go<00:02:31.630> so<00:02:32.050> what<00:02:32.260> are<00:02:32.290> that<00:02:32.470> one<00:02:32.680> of

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
the criticisms from people's early

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.570 
the criticisms from people's early
perspective<00:02:35.560> early<00:02:35.980> views<00:02:36.190> on<00:02:36.310> this<00:02:36.400> game

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
perspective early views on this game

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.060 
perspective early views on this game
were<00:02:37.230> it's<00:02:38.230> just<00:02:38.350> a<00:02:38.410> series<00:02:38.590> of<00:02:38.740> quick<00:02:38.860> time

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
were it's just a series of quick time

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:40.920 
were it's just a series of quick time
events<00:02:39.460> and<00:02:39.490> so<00:02:40.090> far<00:02:40.390> it<00:02:40.510> looks<00:02:40.570> as<00:02:40.900> though

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
events and so far it looks as though

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.350 
events and so far it looks as though
that's<00:02:41.770> what<00:02:41.950> it<00:02:41.980> is<00:02:42.100> if<00:02:42.610> you<00:02:42.820> know<00:02:42.970> it's<00:02:43.270> very

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
that's what it is if you know it's very

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.820 
that's what it is if you know it's very
much<00:02:43.630> like<00:02:43.690> press<00:02:44.050> this<00:02:44.200> button<00:02:44.380> to<00:02:44.500> do<00:02:44.650> this

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
and from the early stages just before

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:47.790 
and from the early stages just before
this<00:02:46.750> there's<00:02:47.170> a<00:02:47.200> whole<00:02:47.320> section<00:02:47.470> when<00:02:47.710> you're

kind of like a good introduction to the
game<00:02:51.910> you<00:02:52.090> know<00:02:52.210> it<00:02:52.390> teaches<00:02:52.930> you<00:02:53.020> how<00:02:53.170> to<00:02:53.230> use

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
game you know it teaches you how to use

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:54.960 
game you know it teaches you how to use
all<00:02:53.590> these<00:02:53.710> quick<00:02:53.950> time<00:02:54.130> events<00:02:54.490> but<00:02:54.640> one<00:02:54.850> of

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
all these quick time events but one of

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.490 
all these quick time events but one of
the<00:02:55.030> things<00:02:55.090> is<00:02:55.480> there's<00:02:55.810> no<00:02:55.990> there's<00:02:56.470> no

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
the things is there's no there's no

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.350 
the things is there's no there's no
huddle<00:02:56.830> on<00:02:56.980> the<00:02:57.100> screen<00:02:57.370> there's<00:02:57.610> no<00:02:57.730> visible

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
huddle on the screen there's no visible

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.480 
huddle on the screen there's no visible
life<00:02:58.600> bar<00:02:58.930> or<00:02:59.140> anything<00:02:59.470> like<00:02:59.500> that<00:02:59.650> it<00:03:00.100> so<00:03:00.370> it

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:00.490 
life bar or anything like that it so it

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.040 
life bar or anything like that it so it
doesn't<00:03:00.550> take<00:03:00.970> you<00:03:01.120> out<00:03:01.270> from<00:03:01.480> the<00:03:01.540> cinematic

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
doesn't take you out from the cinematic

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.290 
doesn't take you out from the cinematic
experience<00:03:02.250> so<00:03:03.250> everything<00:03:03.760> is<00:03:03.820> overlaid

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
experience so everything is overlaid

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.110 
experience so everything is overlaid
onto<00:03:04.720> the<00:03:05.560> actual<00:03:05.920> shots<00:03:06.190> so<00:03:06.610> you<00:03:06.700> never

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
onto the actual shots so you never

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.790 
onto the actual shots so you never
distracts<00:03:07.690> you<00:03:07.810> so<00:03:08.230> do<00:03:08.320> you<00:03:08.350> think<00:03:08.440> that<00:03:08.590> this

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 
distracts you so do you think that this

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.580 
distracts you so do you think that this
is<00:03:08.980> like<00:03:09.250> the<00:03:09.430> beginning<00:03:09.760> of<00:03:10.320> virtual<00:03:11.320> movies

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
is like the beginning of virtual movies

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:12.990 
is like the beginning of virtual movies
I<00:03:11.620> mean<00:03:11.740> the<00:03:11.800> facial<00:03:12.190> animations<00:03:12.700> are<00:03:12.820> very

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
I mean the facial animations are very

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.330 
I mean the facial animations are very
good<00:03:13.210> idea<00:03:13.720> not<00:03:14.080> not<00:03:14.410> so<00:03:14.560> much<00:03:14.709> on<00:03:14.890> this

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
good idea not not so much on this

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.710 
good idea not not so much on this
character<00:03:15.610> I<00:03:15.730> played<00:03:16.239> a<00:03:16.270> little<00:03:16.390> bit<00:03:16.600> further

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
character I played a little bit further

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.440 
character I played a little bit further
in<00:03:16.989> it<00:03:17.110> and<00:03:17.320> the<00:03:17.470> kind<00:03:18.370> of<00:03:18.430> sort<00:03:18.640> of<00:03:18.730> beefier

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
in it and the kind of sort of beefier

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.600 
in it and the kind of sort of beefier
detective<00:03:20.080> so<00:03:20.620> he<00:03:20.830> looks<00:03:21.040> a<00:03:21.160> little<00:03:21.280> bit<00:03:21.489> more

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.610 
detective so he looks a little bit more

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.430 
detective so he looks a little bit more
lifelike<00:03:21.820> than<00:03:22.090> this<00:03:22.390> guy<00:03:22.570> absolutely<00:03:23.260> I

best thing to do now i think is we hung
over<00:04:03.500> this<00:04:03.590> balcony<00:04:04.570> should<00:04:05.570> be<00:04:05.780> able<00:04:05.870> to<00:04:06.020> see

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230

00:06:37.589 --> 00:06:37.599 
to it because of the detail in the

00:06:37.599 --> 00:06:38.939 
to it because of the detail in the
facial<00:06:37.930> animations<00:06:38.469> you<00:06:38.560> know<00:06:38.680> you<00:06:38.740> can

give<00:06:47.409> too<00:06:47.529> much<00:06:47.649> away<00:06:47.830> but<00:06:47.979> there<00:06:48.310> are<00:06:48.460> other

00:06:48.719 --> 00:06:48.729 
give too much away but there are other

00:06:48.729 --> 00:06:50.700 
give too much away but there are other
places<00:06:49.419> in<00:06:49.659> the<00:06:49.750> game<00:06:49.930> where<00:06:50.199> you<00:06:50.319> may<00:06:50.529> get

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:50.710
