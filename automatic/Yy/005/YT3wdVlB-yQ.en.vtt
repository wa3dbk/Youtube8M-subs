00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:06.839
 and then youtube personal I am a genius ps 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.420
 stock in samsung galaxy 3 thousand and today 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.860
 I'll tip is the battery saving 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.580
 folks 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.109
 I will not work miracles here 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.570
 demonstrate to you a miracle of 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.850
 economy so my battery will last 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.830
 a week is not no such thing 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.630
 only the battery is running very short 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.420
 You better trade for another date. 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.210
 for one hour only the battery and nothing 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.030
 Battery exchange is with a show on the scene. 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.820
 for you here is the battery in a state 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.780
 for example a day with 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:43.020
 normal functioning wifi bluetooth 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:44.730
 You're messing with playing. 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.930
 to make this economy a 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.870
 little bigger 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:55.250
 first we go here gps wifi 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:57.719
 bluetooth mobile data off 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.210
 activating power saving and 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.480
 sync does not need to be active 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.810
 here's the brightness you can 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.520
 at least in the environment with the 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.950
 controlled but you can leave it at 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.020
 minimum you are not going to have to 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.810
 chance yet to see what 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.939
 is on the screen so this here causes 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.790
 you the economy if anything if not 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.320
 want to leave in silent mode or vibrate 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.720
 or in silent mode 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:30.479
 okay if you leave the census you will not 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:33.329
 listen to the phone then play first 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:37.560
 step second step sts 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:39.840
 here is the energy savings when the 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.390
 device is inactive activates a quick 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:46.409
 connection every 30 minutes that is if 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.990
 you leave active wifi and bluetooth or 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:52.020
 3g every 30 minutes and will send a 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:59.729
 Wrist to know if everything is okay but 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:02:01.229
 so disconnect all this is one more an app 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.860
 to control the economy of 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.659
 energy 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:10.229
 So let's show you guys here now. 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:12.660
 the following we go here on the home button 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:16.850
 already in the manager 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.570
 and if the pain we have no application to 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.730
 active 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.580
 who will do for example will enter 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.890
 here in the fm 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.100
 I explained to you that we leave. 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.840
 by the man who leaves the application open 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.730
 depending on the application and is open and 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.150
 If you give when you return, you 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:40.100
 application then we'll go home 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.100
 We come here on the music player 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:47.370
 Yes, I rode fm and the same as you did. 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:50.570
 home leave by the home let's manager 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.570
 now here again 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:03:01.500
 they here they not so they are 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:06.090
 eating processing for sale 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:09.330
 hello cpu and gpu and ram 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:11.130
 so this here he also ends up doing 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.830
 that the battery lasts less because it 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.660
 is running the program in the background 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.300
 You're there to sign in. 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.459
 have it all but boring 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:25.520
 there is no automatic mode that can 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:32.450
 control this has pts exist 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:39.750
 configuration options developer 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:41.880
 rock at most one process but why 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.459
 you were running there was still a 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:47.910
 second open process and takes a while 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:50.070
 still to topple the other process 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:58.650
 Let's go back here for me. 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:04:01.220
 all zeroed fm is running home music 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.220
 player 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:08.280
 rome again burial 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:12.569
 certainly the two applications are 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:14.489
 running there or one depends on how much 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:17.459
 Time took for he released are still 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:20.310
 the two rounds but without waiting a while 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:22.979
 He will pick up and finish one here. 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.630
 in a moment so let's try to make 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:25.440
 here a citizen an example here another one 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:30.169
 example 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.169
 we go here in the calendar 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:41.539
 We left at 7 in beauty. 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:45.870
 let's a manager is not here 

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:47.990
 let's re-enter the calendar now 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:50.190
 go out for a man 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:57.330
 go out on the shoulder let's get into the 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:05:00.770
 open applications manager is 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:04.760
 for him to close two is only with one 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.760
 class is already set 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:16.470
 he has to shut another person out because 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:24.810
 it is only programmed for one 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:34.080
 application in the background a process in 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:37.169
 Max talking only stayed fm 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:42.539
 now then he closed the month of player 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:44.280
 and closed the agenda so very personal 

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:47.400
 be careful when you use the home button 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:51.960
 step home button it leaves oo 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:55.139
 open application and the back 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:57.680
 it closes the application the home it 

00:05:55.139 --> 00:06:02.610
 It maintains a background and this makes 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:07.380
 It's your battery she spends faster 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:09.599
 There is then another place here you 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:12.690
 Do you know where the battery is? 

00:06:09.599 --> 00:06:14.070
 consumed that all this is not new 

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:16.139
 For you guys, but I'm 

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:17.849
 passing it on to you to know 

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:20.340
 the power save mode 

00:06:17.849 --> 00:06:22.650
 you can control the CPU speed 

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:28.229
 Clicking here it will not use the peak 

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:31.380
 which is a jet and leaking 600 200 800 mhz 

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:35.159
 here's more on how you save 

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:37.949
 energy here is active to control 

00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:42.659
 screen brightness through the sensor here 

00:06:37.949 --> 00:06:44.849
 in front of the battery for example here 

00:06:42.659 --> 00:06:47.220
 is the other module is the time it is 

00:06:44.849 --> 00:06:49.139
 connected obviously that mine I left 

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:50.820
 on your computer when you were on the 

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:53.699
 work that's why he has all this 

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:56.190
 The first time I called the 

00:06:53.699 --> 00:06:58.680
 consumers the screen the system 

00:06:56.190 --> 00:07:02.130
 operating the environment they were coming 

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:04.139
 playing 14% and consumed devices 

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:07.440
 inactive and everything else there goes 

00:07:04.139 --> 00:07:12.060
 goes those who are consuming more 

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:13.650
 but the battery is out also that you 

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:16.710
 have the percentage of the battery you 

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:18.810
 you can control 60's look have 

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:20.490
 so much to hit and yet I can not 

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:21.540
 to charge 

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:25.710
 already the tip 

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:27.390
 would it be to never leave below 50% you 

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:30.840
 put it to charge until you reach 

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:32.310
 100% new touch to beat to beat 

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:34.710
 batteries nowadays there is no more that 

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:37.530
 memory effect but they say it would be 

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:40.530
 ideal you always leave above 50% and 

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:45.270
 charge the cell phone to increase the time 

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:45.960
 of battery life also right 

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:49.380
 folks 

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:51.330
 so here are tips to hit and 

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:52.170
 it as you save battery from your 

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:55.770
 cell phone 

00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:58.800
 It's good if you like people leave the 

00:07:55.770 --> 00:08:02.640
 joinha ayew forgetting you can take the 

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:05.220
 the sounds of for example you touch the 

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:07.380
 phone that return and vibration is 

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:09.570
 noise when you play too 

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:13.020
 can be all this also saves 

00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:15.530
 energy ok now yes if you liked 

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:19.550
