00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.880
 or welcome Salmonella and 27 

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:15.970
 well the first thing we are going to do is a 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:18.610
 split from ear to ear then a 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:20.680
 line to the center and with the hair that we 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:23.410
 subtraction in the back we will make a 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:26.980
 pigtail immediately with the hair of 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:30.070
 forward let's make a half 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:32.529
 circle on each side of the line and the 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:36.300
 hair that remains of that means 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.300
 we will leave it in 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.410
 we do the same with the other side of the 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.829
 hair is very important that we measure 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.949
 Where will each match go? I always 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.739
 I guide with my fingers I should always leave the 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.229
 same amount of space on one side and 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.540
 from another of that depends then that our 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:13.650
 hairstyle look good 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:17.010
 Well, once we did 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:20.580
 the half circle on the other side we're going to 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:23.880
 join the hair of the two half 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.010
 circles and we are going to join the queue 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.510
 it should be like the shape of a 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.640
 heart 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:33.130
 this change we brush them well and what 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.200
 We join the back 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.770
 with the hair from the front we are going to 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:41.289
 make an inverted French braid 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.600
 which we are only going to feed from 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:46.140
 one side that would be part of the 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.140
 front 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:53.630
 and we are going to do the same with hair 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.630
 that we have on each side of the line 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.020
 we continue tracing up to the height of 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:12.010
 the pigtail 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:12.010
 and we hold the two braids with a garter 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.870
 i 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:14.000
 the next step is to take a small 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:17.720
 tuft of hair from the bottom 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.380
 from the ponytail and mess up where the 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.660
 league 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:23.450
 this is to cover the league and what 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.310
 we hold with a pin right away we go 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:27.710
 to make a three-strand braid 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:30.290
 pretty loose and we're going to go 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:33.160
 feeding with the strands of hair 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:36.430
 from the back 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:39.550
 We are going to weave the braid 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:40.600
 If you notice, it's the 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.300
 weaving 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:47.380
 raised of the hair that is not no 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:48.870
 woven downwards but towards me this is 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.870
 in order that we stay enough 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.870
 loose 

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:10.449
 at the end of our leaf braid 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:10.449
 let's put a small list 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:15.490
 and now what we are going to do is that 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:19.319
 let's loosen up a little more 

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:19.319
 our braid is going to open 

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:25.969
 like who says lose the form of 

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:28.579
 simple braid 

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:32.539
 and then we're going to take the slice of 

00:06:28.579 --> 00:06:35.299
 center of the braid what 

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:39.160
 we get very good at doing this the tip 

00:06:35.299 --> 00:06:41.680
 of the braid is going to get like that 

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:43.720
 you may not need to hide the 

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:46.900
 tip of the braid where the liguita goes 

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:49.000
 it can be if you fix them very well on 

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:52.060
 center segment like I am 

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.880
 doing it automatically gets the 

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:57.550
 The tip of the braid is turned to 

00:06:54.880 --> 00:07:00.040
 down the braid and you do not see but in 

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:04.500
 if it looks you can put a 

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:04.500
 pin and nothing happens
