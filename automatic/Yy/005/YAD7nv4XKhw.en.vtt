00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:11.040
 welcome all subscribers to the channel here 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.710
 file with you walk in today's video i 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.780
 continue my story about the Swedish middle 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.960
 tanks and specifically in this video you 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:23.400
 learn about cars from level six to 10 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:25.199
 that is all the most delicious on the sixth 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.010
 level will be presented for further 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:31.140
 development there to page 42 with postscript m 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.019
 which says that this tank 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.210
 modernized around 1942 

00:00:34.019 --> 00:00:38.550
 Swedish engineer had the idea to create 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.519
 more modernized version of simple 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.859
 strv m42 immediately presented three 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:46.199
 possible options first with weighted 

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:48.420
 frontal booking a new tower and 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:50.639
 powerful albina barrels seventy five 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.039
 50mm long cannon 

00:00:50.639 --> 00:00:54.809
 calibers the second option is more oblique 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.149
 frontal booking but not 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.399
 weighted with an old type tower 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.019
 out of the park and the arms of the same 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.899
 seventy five millimeter cannon 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:05.550
 50 caliber long and 40 millimeter long 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.040
 automatic machine which is likely to be 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.960
 used as anti-aircraft well and finally 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.940
 the third option which is by the way less 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.400
 priority was inserted you exactly 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.710
 same as previous one without 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.270
 Sparki weapons from older 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.060
 seventy five millimeter cannon 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.250
 only 31 caliber long our game 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.590
 these three options are likely to combine 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.960
 in one full where all will be taken 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.580
 the best of each that is in the end 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.160
 we will have two different 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.110
 pumped towers and reinforced windshield 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.780
 booking two different weapons 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.150
 one of which is shorter and the other 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:43.980
 more and more long-barreled punch 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:45.690
 and they have good mobility 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.770
 reality unfortunately modernized 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.500
 version of 1 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.750
 m42 did not decide to use 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.150
 just beat him and all but not 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.190
 less it gave some experience swedish 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:59.100
 as an engineer and as a result they created such 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:01.290
 tank like strv-74 this car is 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.650
 the following tanks in our thread 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:07.320
 development of streets in 174 has already begun 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.909
 after the end of the second world war 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.050
 no less tank turned out enough 

00:02:08.909 --> 00:02:11.970
 fit 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.620
 and it fits into our game 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.930
 absolutely no problem 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.000
 smooth bone is not here and some imba 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.480
 characteristics are also not present 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.520
 created a tank based on the strv m42 that is 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.310
 our fifth level is swedish engineers 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.920
 managed to base on that little typewriter 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.720
 make full experience and tank though 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.880
 not as cool as any there 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.160
 merkava or leopard but nevertheless all 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.520
 Equally turned out good and the car that 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.650
 managed to stand on armament right up to 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:42.690
 84 years which is really cool by the way 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.700
 some are still used as 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.370
 training tanks probably you have planned 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.260
 the question is and what is it with this tank that 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.570
 he turned out so fit for so long 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.760
 standing on arms really nothing 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.920
 such top Pechersk in this tank 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.110
 no, he just reliable is simple 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.450
 operation and easy to assemble what 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.790
 the Swedes quite liked it but not 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.340
 says that tth u tank bad 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:08.190
 they are just quite average and full 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.410
 ammunition weighed think 24 tons at 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:13.110
 it had a rather weak engine 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.640
 capacity of only 170 horsepower 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.070
 and because of what a separate power is not 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.870
 exceeded 13 hostile forces per ton 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:20.880
 but meanwhile the maximum speed 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.640
 the tank will still be good enough 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:26.190
 45 kilometers per hour which is like for average 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.230
 Tank is quite a nice booking to 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.510
 Unfortunately did not exceed 80 millimeters 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.970
 the thickest part was in the forehead 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.310
 shells this is not the whole world there 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.380
 managed to skip places and 60 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.660
 millimeters so vld tank and 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.940
 naturally will not be so will save 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.280
 only some rare ricochets but 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.620
 a tower that looks like a tower 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.110
 poker bulldog will be at least there like that 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.540
 less talk about first there 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.970
 there is a good mask and second corners 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.040
 less less rational therefore there is 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.260
 a chance that the tower will be well at least somehow 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.270
 tank but in the form of weapons 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.340
 will be presented cool seventy 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:04.920
 five millimeter cannon which was 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.720
 powerful modern and for tabletop 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.700
 Let them be a great caliber but not 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.070
 less if its right for balance then 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.019
 it will be one of the best guns among st 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:15.420
 level seven in my opinion it turns out 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:17.370
 in a suitable car let them for but those not 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.830
 less this will be one of the most interesting 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:22.410
 and st and seventh level because there is 

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:24.690
 all sorts of t-43 which usually people pass 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:28.440
 just forget and this tank can become 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:32.160
 for many loved ones on the eighth level 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.510
 represented such a tank apis trv 81 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.640
 now on the screens you see 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:37.650
 ordinary centurion and probably 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.540
 ask yourself why this tank 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:43.020
 you are really on the screens 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:45.030
 just thatâ€™s what 81 is first 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.820
 simple centurion whom the Swedes bought 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:50.010
 and we decided to use for service well, 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:52.620
 chop finger and why create your tank 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:55.050
 if there is a successful centurion pro tth and 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:57.660
 Other things say it makes no sense but I note that 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:00.350
 maybe the tank will have its own 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.350
 features 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:06.450
 next place ninth level will take 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:08.370
 such a tank as p in 102 again you 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:10.110
 on the screens centurion and then you probably 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:12.030
 already think that I am in the astral but to 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:14.400
 Sorry, no, it's not like that 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:16.680
 their time the swedes really bought 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.200
 many different batches of centurions and 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.870
 once they bought mk3 centurions with 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.820
 guns 105 millimeters possible in 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:26.370
 tank something to upgrade but in fact 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:29.220
 it turns out the same centurion to 3 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:31.350
 as was in real life therefore from tth and here 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:33.180
 again, just nothing to celebrate it 

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:38.370
 will be the same clone with some of its own 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:41.280
 features at the tenth level will be 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:43.080
 presented such a machine as strv and to 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.000
 Fortunately, this is not another clone 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.400
 and the unique development of the Swedes 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.890
 especially for export to america in 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.690
 mid 50s while swedish 

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:54.120
 the military despaired of waiting to bring 

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:56.400
 prototypes heavy tank krv up 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:58.290
 serial production instructor was 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:02.550
 proposed to draft a modern 

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:06.360
 tank and so steamed three concepts with 1 a 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:08.550
 strv thousand th in this case, you should 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.930
 know only about version and which 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:11.040
 designed specifically for 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:13.020
 of americans 

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:15.270
 and the other versions, I'll tell you 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:17.730
 subsequent videos while developing and 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:20.760
 bitches and the Swedes were allowed to take 

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:22.860
 the basis of the krv tank chassis which was 

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:25.440
 heavy prize in the end we get 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:28.050
 medium tank made on base 

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:31.289
 which is based on the first drawings externally 

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:33.360
 dp ttx was very similar to m48 

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:34.320
 patton am unfortunately once u 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:37.440
 Americans by 

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:38.250
 yusi m60 swedes backed out and draft 

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.020
 was closed 

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:42.000
 but fortunately the documentation and drawings 

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:43.680
 preserved on the basis of which it is known 

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.080
 that this car turns out very 

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:48.300
 interesting and it fits perfectly into 

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:50.190
 our game is first worth noting 

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:52.080
 what our swedish patton will have 

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:54.660
 used almost exactly 

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:57.210
 same weaponry as the ordinary m48 

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:59.550
 patton and have all sorts of leopards 

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:02.550
 of all that stuff, that is, your own 

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:04.920
 swedish version of british cannon l7 

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:08.550
 the tank will also have a booking close 

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:10.740
 to m48 patton y and m60 that is not bad 

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:13.980
 forehead case well, so relative and 

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:16.470
 a fairly usable tower of about 150 in 

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:18.510
 the forehead of that and that but also the dynamics which 

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:20.760
 there will be just 10 out of 10 

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:22.740
 maximum speed is about 60 

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:25.260
 kilometers per hour and powerful diesel 

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:26.610
 800 horsepower engine i.e. 

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:29.190
 end up with us really 

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:32.370
 cool and unique tank level 10 

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:35.010
 which can and is similar to the m48 patton but the 

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:36.930
 no less will it be clearly better naturally 

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:39.300
 developers are likely to do it 

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:41.250
 there is a shitty look as possible 

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:44.100
 poor chassis turning speed but in 

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:46.230
 In general, anyway the tank will be better I hurry 

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:48.450
 grieve you on this note swedish 

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:51.210
 medium tanks finishing the price for them 

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:52.950
 we still have pt-shki art and a bunch of 

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:54.780
 just kind of actually we get 

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:57.630
 really cool big and 

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:59.640
 bulky thread your opinion about swedish 

00:07:57.630 --> 00:08:01.380
 medium tanks, be sure to write in 

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:03.330
 comments and also 

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:05.970
 ask questions and suggest 

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:08.070
 next topics for next videos 

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:10.140
 yourself were hamish do not forget to put 

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:11.760
 like a video subscribe to my channel 

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:14.760
