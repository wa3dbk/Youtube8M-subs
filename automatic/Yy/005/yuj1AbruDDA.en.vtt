it's<00:01:53.130> gonna<00:01:53.280> work<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.670> greatest<00:01:54.030> is<00:01:54.799> right

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
it's gonna work the greatest is right

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
here you can see all the way through the

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.030 
here you can see all the way through the
bait<00:01:59.250> it's<00:01:59.640> kind<00:01:59.850> of<00:01:59.880> like<00:02:00.000> little<00:02:00.240> ribs<00:02:00.509> in<00:02:00.689> it

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040

I'm<00:02:02.040> not<00:02:02.340> sure<00:02:02.579> how<00:02:02.759> that's<00:02:02.909> gonna<00:02:03.090> work<00:02:03.210> with

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
I'm not sure how that's gonna work with

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.539 
I'm not sure how that's gonna work with
water<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:04.140> I'm<00:02:04.649> assuming<00:02:05.070> it's<00:02:05.189> gonna<00:02:05.310> fill

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
water and I'm assuming it's gonna fill

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.690 
water and I'm assuming it's gonna fill
up<00:02:05.729> and<00:02:05.909> make<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.240> bait<00:02:06.860> swim<00:02:07.860> funky<00:02:08.250> I<00:02:08.429> don't
