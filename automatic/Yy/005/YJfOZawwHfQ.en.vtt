manual green light comes on and now
these<00:03:09.380> four<00:03:09.620> switches<00:03:09.860> down<00:03:10.070> here<00:03:10.310> bring<00:03:10.520> in

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
these four switches down here bring in

the me-80 so if I've got switch to on as
I<00:03:15.140> do<00:03:15.200> here<00:03:15.620> all<00:03:15.920> I'm<00:03:16.160> getting<00:03:16.250> is<00:03:16.460> the

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
overdrive if I turn on switch for I get

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
overdrive if I turn on switch for I get
to<00:03:20.960> delay

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:33.390 

switch<00:03:27.890> three<00:03:28.190> is<00:03:28.280> the<00:03:28.400> modulation<00:03:28.760> section

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.770 

it's<00:03:34.400> an<00:03:34.490> intense<00:03:34.760> modulation<00:03:35.240> effect<00:03:35.660> there

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
it's an intense modulation effect there

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.420 
it's an intense modulation effect there
kind<00:03:35.900> of<00:03:35.930> a<00:03:36.050> ring<00:03:36.200> modulation<00:03:36.620> effect<00:03:37.040> but<00:03:37.400> you

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
kind of a ring modulation effect but you

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.010 
kind of a ring modulation effect but you
can<00:03:37.610> see<00:03:37.760> how<00:03:37.850> this<00:03:37.970> works<00:03:38.210> just<00:03:38.450> like<00:03:38.570> using

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:39.020 
can see how this works just like using

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:40.660 
can see how this works just like using
individual<00:03:39.410> pedals<00:03:39.740> on<00:03:39.860> a<00:03:39.890> pedal<00:03:40.190> board<00:03:40.310> if
