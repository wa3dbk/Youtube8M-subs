video I do is that's my radiation
poisoning<00:00:18.840> I<00:00:19.289> guess<00:00:19.560> so<00:00:20.130> open<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:20.779> light

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
poisoning I guess so open the light

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:31.279 
poisoning I guess so open the light
glass<00:00:25.730> and<00:00:28.070> then<00:00:29.070> after<00:00:29.789> this<00:00:30.140> there's<00:00:31.140> only

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
glass and then after this there's only

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.850 
glass and then after this there's only
like<00:00:32.059> what<00:00:33.059> two<00:00:33.480> or<00:00:33.510> three<00:00:33.930> other<00:00:34.170> ways<00:00:34.410> to<00:00:34.680> die

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
like what two or three other ways to die

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.770 
like what two or three other ways to die
and<00:00:35.190> then<00:00:35.340> it's<00:00:36.180> also<00:00:36.329> a<00:00:36.510> way<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:36.829> lose<00:00:37.829> as<00:00:38.309> well

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
and then it's also a way to lose as well

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:01:00.840 

for<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.160> next<00:00:53.400> day<00:00:54.200> with<00:00:55.200> John<00:00:55.500> hockey

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:06.249 

okay<00:01:01.850> um<00:01:02.710> another<00:01:04.540> kind<00:01:05.540> of<00:01:05.570> an<00:01:05.689> obvious<00:01:05.840> death

00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:06.259 
okay um another kind of an obvious death

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:11.139 
okay um another kind of an obvious death
I<00:01:06.470> guess<00:01:06.530> is<00:01:07.040> if<00:01:07.970> you<00:01:08.619> let<00:01:09.619> the<00:01:10.130> time<00:01:10.640> run<00:01:10.670> out

00:01:11.139 --> 00:01:11.149 
I guess is if you let the time run out

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:14.560 
I guess is if you let the time run out
after<00:01:11.450> you<00:01:11.899> hit<00:01:12.580> after<00:01:13.580> you<00:01:14.030> set<00:01:14.450> the

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
after you hit after you set the

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.940 
after you hit after you set the
self-destruct<00:01:17.049> if<00:01:18.049> you<00:01:18.259> watch<00:01:18.409> the<00:01:18.680> intro

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
self-destruct if you watch the intro

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.080 
self-destruct if you watch the intro
video<00:01:19.220> to<00:01:19.310> my<00:01:19.789> let's<00:01:20.030> play<00:01:20.299> and<00:01:21.820> you'll<00:01:22.820> see

anything and not setting self-destruct
and<00:05:12.570> none<00:05:12.660> of<00:05:12.810> this<00:05:12.990> is<00:05:13.169> bug<00:05:13.410> we<00:05:13.620> need<00:05:13.650> to<00:05:14.010> test

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280 
and none of this is bug we need to test

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:17.689 
and none of this is bug we need to test
it<00:05:14.430> out<00:05:14.520> again<00:05:14.910> but<00:05:15.300> I<00:05:16.160> didn't<00:05:17.160> even<00:05:17.280> sets<00:05:17.550> up

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:17.699 
it out again but I didn't even sets up

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:20.240 
it out again but I didn't even sets up
destruct<00:05:18.240> but<00:05:18.389> I<00:05:18.419> got<00:05:18.599> the<00:05:18.780> log<00:05:19.020> tape<00:05:19.530> and<00:05:19.889> came

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
destruct but I got the log tape and came

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:23.420 
destruct but I got the log tape and came
back<00:05:20.280> and<00:05:20.970> got<00:05:21.150> rescued<00:05:21.539> and<00:05:22.320> it<00:05:22.860> still<00:05:23.310> gives

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 
back and got rescued and it still gives

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:30.740 
back and got rescued and it still gives
the<00:05:23.699> same<00:05:23.880> when<00:05:24.810> ending<00:05:26.120> if<00:05:27.120> you<00:05:28.220> didn't<00:05:29.479> or<00:05:30.479> if

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:30.750 
the same when ending if you didn't or if

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.719 
the same when ending if you didn't or if
he<00:05:30.900> did<00:05:31.110> set<00:05:31.349> self-destruct<00:05:32.010> and<00:05:32.250> blow<00:05:32.460> up<00:05:32.580> the

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:32.729 
he did set self-destruct and blow up the

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:35.000 
he did set self-destruct and blow up the
ship<00:05:32.789> so<00:05:33.330> apparently<00:05:34.289> you<00:05:34.380> don't<00:05:34.560> really<00:05:34.770> need

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.010 
ship so apparently you don't really need

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:38.270 
ship so apparently you don't really need
to<00:05:35.070> blow<00:05:35.340> up<00:05:35.460> the<00:05:35.669> ship<00:05:35.699> ah<00:05:36.210> I<00:05:37.010> guess<00:05:38.010> I<00:05:38.039> thought

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:38.280 
to blow up the ship ah I guess I thought

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.339 
to blow up the ship ah I guess I thought
that<00:05:38.340> maybe<00:05:38.820> test<00:05:39.180> that<00:05:39.389> out<00:05:39.539> and<00:05:39.750> see<00:05:40.080> if<00:05:40.199> it

00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:40.349 
that maybe test that out and see if it

00:05:40.349 --> 00:05:43.189 
that maybe test that out and see if it
was<00:05:40.500> just<00:05:40.560> a<00:05:41.159> glitch<00:05:41.970> or<00:05:42.180> something<00:05:42.240> but<00:05:42.900> I

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:43.199 
was just a glitch or something but I

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:45.469 
was just a glitch or something but I
kind<00:05:44.130> of<00:05:44.220> remember<00:05:44.610> from<00:05:44.789> when<00:05:44.909> a<00:05:44.940> kid<00:05:45.270> that

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:45.479 
kind of remember from when a kid that

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:48.170 
kind of remember from when a kid that
wasn't<00:05:46.080> the<00:05:46.260> case<00:05:46.470> but<00:05:46.889> couldn't<00:05:47.820> get<00:05:47.940> to<00:05:48.150> work

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.180 
wasn't the case but couldn't get to work

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:51.469 
wasn't the case but couldn't get to work
on<00:05:48.449> this<00:05:48.599> emulated<00:05:49.169> version<00:05:49.849> anyway<00:05:50.849> zom<00:05:51.270> I

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:51.479 
on this emulated version anyway zom I

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:53.480 
on this emulated version anyway zom I
think<00:05:51.930> I<00:05:52.169> might<00:05:52.470> go<00:05:52.770> ahead<00:05:52.860> and<00:05:53.070> try<00:05:53.220> to<00:05:53.250> add

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:53.490 
think I might go ahead and try to add

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:58.320 
think I might go ahead and try to add
one<00:05:53.520> more<00:05:53.970> thing<00:05:54.030> in<00:05:54.690> here<00:05:54.990> where<00:05:55.740> you<00:05:56.220> see

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:01.110 
what happens to Mary if you don't favor

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:03.390 
what happens to Mary if you don't favor

and you happen to be on the first level
okay<00:06:04.150> so<00:06:04.259> you<00:06:05.259> know<00:06:05.349> pause<00:06:05.560> the<00:06:05.710> video<00:06:05.949> and<00:06:06.159> try

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:06.370 
okay so you know pause the video and try

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:10.080 
okay so you know pause the video and try
that<00:06:06.639> out<00:06:07.680> actually<00:06:08.680> on<00:06:09.099> second<00:06:09.699> thought<00:06:09.849> I

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:10.090 
that out actually on second thought I

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:13.020 
that out actually on second thought I
think<00:06:10.479> what<00:06:10.780> I'm<00:06:10.870> gonna<00:06:10.960> do<00:06:11.229> is<00:06:11.969> make<00:06:12.969> a

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:13.030 
think what I'm gonna do is make a

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:15.420 
think what I'm gonna do is make a
separate<00:06:13.479> video<00:06:13.599> of<00:06:13.930> that<00:06:14.080> for<00:06:14.530> a<00:06:14.560> ways<00:06:14.889> for

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:15.430 
separate video of that for a ways for

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:18.059 
separate video of that for a ways for
Mary<00:06:15.969> to<00:06:16.270> die<00:06:16.419> in<00:06:16.719> project<00:06:17.050> five<00:06:17.199> sorry<00:06:17.560> this

00:06:18.059 --> 00:06:18.069 
Mary to die in project five sorry this

00:06:18.069 --> 00:06:20.580 
Mary to die in project five sorry this
is<00:06:18.310> not<00:06:18.460> really<00:06:18.729> a<00:06:18.759> way<00:06:19.180> to<00:06:19.210> lose<00:06:19.590> technically

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:20.590 
is not really a way to lose technically

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:22.950 
is not really a way to lose technically
in<00:06:20.889> the<00:06:20.919> game<00:06:21.189> I<00:06:21.490> guess<00:06:22.389> that's<00:06:22.569> up<00:06:22.659> to<00:06:22.870> the

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:22.960 
in the game I guess that's up to the

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:26.010 
in the game I guess that's up to the
person<00:06:23.139> but<00:06:23.590> uh<00:06:23.650> and<00:06:24.550> it's<00:06:25.419> not<00:06:25.599> really<00:06:25.840> a<00:06:25.870> way

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:26.020 
person but uh and it's not really a way

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:29.909 
person but uh and it's not really a way
for<00:06:26.050> you<00:06:26.409> to<00:06:26.439> die<00:06:26.680> either<00:06:26.710> so<00:06:27.460> or<00:06:28.120> lose<00:06:28.360> so<00:06:28.919> I'll

00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:29.919 
for you to die either so or lose so I'll

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:32.789 
for you to die either so or lose so I'll
do<00:06:30.069> that<00:06:30.099> next<00:06:30.460> video
