 archer eat high-precision sniper style 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.619
 games which is based on significant 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.810
 critical damage and kite enemies

 using arrows frosty eat skillfully 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.740
 keeps lane and control from enemies 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.420
 she is excellent at dealing damage 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.900
 imposing battlefield on enemies and help 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.759
 allies across the map 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.829
 passivka eat focus when she is not 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.780
 uses basic attacks go chance 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.910
 cause critical damage rises from 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.800
 time and reaches 100 percent on 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.050
 high levels of critical damage chance 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.719
 growing faster the very first basic attack 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.460
 the heroine absorbs the focus bonus at the same 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:51.090
 time it cannot be activated 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.079
 skills frost shock allows arrows to ash 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.420
 slow down enemies 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.699
 skill absorbs mana with every shot 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.079
 it allows you to effectively hold 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.059
 enemies at a distance or 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.370
 guarantee that the goal will not escape 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.789
 their deaths when using skills 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.430
 will 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.350
 ash shoots a hail of arrows each 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.049
 arrow when hit on target and deals 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.850
 damage and slows down the enemy just there every 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.189
 enemy target can only hit 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.200
 one arrow of all skills are distant 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.119
 goals can avoid hitting by passing 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.400
 between arrows or hiding behind others 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.110
 units as the effect of slowing down the will 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.570
 depends on frost sho then it won't 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.210
 slow down enemies if hundreds frost studied 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.280
 skill hulk shock has both passive 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.380
 active effect passive effect 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.570
 increases the amount of gold for the dead 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.400
 enemies by activating this skill ash 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.350
 sent to a given place hawk 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.689
 which accelerates for a few seconds 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.729
 the fog of war and looks bushes yet 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.299
 less can he not detect invisible 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.310
 objects 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.530
 skill is very long range 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.600
 which allows you to open key points 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.290
 card or warn of impending 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.750
 the threat 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.880
 Ulta already called Enchante crystal 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.219
 era shoots a huge boom in 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.659
 a certain direction an arrow flies on 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.759
 unlimited distance 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.719
 0 before colliding with the enemy or not yet 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.760
 will fly for the map 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:05.430
 if the arrow hits the target he 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.560
 breaks down causing damage and stunning itself 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.350
 target also slows down and deals damage 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.400
 gli enemy targets 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.440
 the duration of the stun depends on 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:17.730
 distances that have been covered by an arrow 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.800
 before the collision at the beginning of the game passivka 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.690
 Eat guarantees critical damage for now. 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.250
 she does not attack anyone on the way glue well 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.200
 this property makes 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.570
 already strong enough opponent in 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.100
 group battle on the first level here is ash 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.680
 uses wills and inflicts critical 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.720
 the damage at the same time leaves 300 not half 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.880
 health and this guarantees first blood 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.770
 in the early stages of the game precisely will 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.780
 is the main source of burst 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.970
 heroine and provides pressure on the line 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.920
 adversary since will not tied to 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.050
 basic attacks eat she uses it 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.370
 immediately after the shot in order to take and 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.590
 ripe from the wave of mobs 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.150
 as the burst of the will is clearly not enough 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.670
 frost shot will be the second most important 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.380
 tool in pressure on the enemy ash 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.270
 uses frost shock to scare 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.520
 graves who is in an attempt to escape 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:02.340
 gets some more shots in the back 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:05.490
 just shock a couple with the will create a powerful 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.980
 combo ash slows down and ripening preventing 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:10.320
 chasing after scary as soon as ezreal 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.300
 ran into the bushes ashe releases the will which 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.640
 slows down the enemy while the heroine cuts 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:17.580
 distance and kills him after which 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.200
 focuses on the dawn skill hukshot though 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.790
 and is used in most cases for 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.130
 intelligence can be applied as 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.170
 ambush and seam detection tool 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.550
 hides disguise blitz which is 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.650
 trying to hide in the bushes 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:31.200
 it allowed her to use in growth 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.150
 shot and continue chasing strong kiting 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.400
 potential allows her to play on the line 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.620
 more aggressively as soon as darius 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.330
 came to gang eat could get away from the fight and 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.580
 keep the enemy at a distance with 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.440
 using the will and phrases the score further she 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.330
 starts to play more aggressively and 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.769
 continues to apply frost shot at that 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.200
 the moment when darius went too 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:51.239
 deep into her territory eat helps 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.370
 kill darius with a hook 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:55.230
 trash then retreats immediately 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.090
 time flash on a conditionally safe 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.459
 distance h instantly uses 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.940
 frost and will that both hold and 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:04.940
 ripe before joining shine 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.590
 as soon as you eat reaches level 6 and and 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.900
 ulta becomes extremely serious 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.300
 danger even if it is only farmer 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.140
 like this, Ash turns the fight into two 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.390
 fight 3 on 2 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:16.640
 without even leaving your lane when boom 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.320
 catars overtake companions eat take 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.299
 easy kill and makes diana 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.190
 move to your tower every time 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:24.680
 returning to base check your 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:26.810
 mates staying at the base remember that 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.120
 im chant crystal era can fly along 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:31.010
 all three lane of while the tires 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.720
 ran away from vladimir eat your ulta 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:35.060
 label stuns the enemy under the tower 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.960
 duration of stunning allowed towers 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.970
 finish off Vladimir 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.010
 even despite his attempt to escape 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.050
 when the team eat is going to go on 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:44.570
 the dragon she checks the hulk sho area 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:47.180
 there in order to detect a potential threat 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.770
 detecting such a threat gives the team as much 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:51.200
 enough time to regroup 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.570
 this is followed by the destruction of enemies 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:56.120
 We start with the death of thrash from the crystal earl 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:58.190
 Oh, the effect of the crystal era slows down 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.260
 surrounding target opponents what does 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.910
 their ideal targets for will ash 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:04.790
 uses frost shock to prevent 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:08.540
 escape and applies will every time when 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:10.250
 the enemy is trying to get out of sight eat 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:12.680
 bumps into wayne in an attempt to steal 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:14.750
 enemy in any using frost shard 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.490
 to slow down her pursuer she 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:18.710
 Considers that Wayne will continue to chase 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.570
 season instead you on uses 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:22.010
 flash behind the wall and almost runs away 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:23.690
 using a hukshot 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:25.910
 and field vision minions ashe shoots 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:28.340
 crystal era to stun warrior and 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:30.650
 come closer to finish it closer to 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:32.930
 the end of the game and becomes almost elusive 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:34.310
 having a certain attack speed and 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:35.840
 will be able to keep the enemy at a distance 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:38.090
 almost endlessly 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.100
 here trandle makes a futile attempt 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:42.320
 chase ash and oriannu but achieves 

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:45.800
 0 success due to double word effect 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:46.610
 heroine dressing eat concentrate on 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.190
 mix damage 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:51.140
 attack speed and mobility remember that 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:53.630
 Eating passive guarantees you a critical 

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:55.669
 damage collect infinity edge as 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:58.400
 this increased critical damage he 

00:05:55.669 --> 00:06:00.860
 is a mandatory purchase among ru 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.840
 I recommend Markina A.D. armor silo 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.530
 family guesses magic resist and fifths 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:07.400
 lifestile 

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:09.560
 beat 2109 talents at speed still damage 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.240
 and bonus critical damage branch offense 

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:13.700
 and restore mana and decrease 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:15.950
 cooldown rare utility is the very world 

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:18.169
 spells choose lens barrier or flash

 they can avoid the difficult 

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:22.910
 situations or take yourself control
