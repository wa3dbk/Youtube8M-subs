when<00:01:51.160> you<00:01:51.250> are<00:01:51.400> cleaning<00:01:51.610> the<00:01:51.880> sensor<00:01:52.290> last

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
when you are cleaning the sensor last

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.830 
when you are cleaning the sensor last
thing<00:01:53.500> you<00:01:53.620> want<00:01:53.800> to<00:01:53.860> do<00:01:54.070> is<00:01:54.280> make<00:01:55.090> contact

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
thing you want to do is make contact

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.150 
thing you want to do is make contact
with<00:01:56.020> it<00:01:56.490> so<00:01:57.490> keep<00:01:57.700> that<00:01:57.730> in<00:01:57.970> mind<00:01:58.860> first<00:01:59.860> step

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:00.160 
with it so keep that in mind first step

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.060 
with it so keep that in mind first step
to<00:02:00.310> cleaning<00:02:00.670> one<00:02:01.620> you<00:02:02.620> have<00:02:02.800> to<00:02:02.920> put<00:02:03.040> the

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
to cleaning one you have to put the

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.450 
to cleaning one you have to put the
camera<00:02:03.400> on<00:02:04.320> go<00:02:05.320> into<00:02:05.530> the<00:02:05.620> menu<00:02:05.800> function<00:02:06.280> of

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
camera on go into the menu function of

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.380 
camera on go into the menu function of
the<00:02:06.610> camera<00:02:06.970> go<00:02:07.630> to<00:02:07.690> sensor<00:02:08.110> cleaning<00:02:08.349> and<00:02:09.390> all

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
the camera go to sensor cleaning and all

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:11.880 
the camera go to sensor cleaning and all
timers<00:02:10.810> pretty<00:02:11.019> much<00:02:11.200> will<00:02:11.379> allow<00:02:11.650> you<00:02:11.709> to

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
timers pretty much will allow you to

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.430 
timers pretty much will allow you to
lock<00:02:12.249> the<00:02:12.400> mirror<00:02:12.670> up<00:02:12.849> and<00:02:13.209> I

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
lock the mirror up and I

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
lock the mirror up and I
that's<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:13.830> sensor<00:02:14.720> select<00:02:15.720> ok<00:02:15.930> and<00:02:19.460> there

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
that's the sensor select ok and there

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.450 
that's the sensor select ok and there
you<00:02:20.610> go<00:02:21.170> sensors<00:02:22.170> now<00:02:22.320> exposed<00:02:22.650> now<00:02:22.950> it's<00:02:23.340> a

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
you go sensors now exposed now it's a

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:24.710 
you go sensors now exposed now it's a
misnomer<00:02:23.670> to<00:02:24.030> say<00:02:24.210> that<00:02:24.420> we're<00:02:24.540> actually

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
misnomer to say that we're actually

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.480 
misnomer to say that we're actually
cleaning<00:02:25.140> the<00:02:25.320> sensor<00:02:25.710> but<00:02:26.220> we're<00:02:26.370> really

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
cleaning the sensor but we're really

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.190 
cleaning the sensor but we're really
doing<00:02:26.760> is<00:02:27.030> cleaning<00:02:27.210> the<00:02:27.390> filter<00:02:27.600> in<00:02:27.840> front<00:02:28.110> of

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
doing is cleaning the filter in front of

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.560 
doing is cleaning the filter in front of
the<00:02:28.290> sensor<00:02:28.530> but<00:02:29.310> all<00:02:29.580> those<00:02:29.760> black<00:02:30.030> spots<00:02:30.210> in

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
the sensor but all those black spots in

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.050 
the sensor but all those black spots in
your<00:02:30.660> pictures<00:02:31.190> it<00:02:32.190> comes<00:02:32.640> out<00:02:32.760> to<00:02:32.910> the<00:02:32.940> same

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
your pictures it comes out to the same

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.180 
your pictures it comes out to the same
thing<00:02:33.270> what<00:02:34.140> you<00:02:34.260> really<00:02:34.440> want<00:02:34.770> to<00:02:34.830> do<00:02:34.980> is<00:02:35.160> just

get rid of them now the first thing you
want<00:02:37.530> to<00:02:37.590> do<00:02:37.740> is<00:02:37.940> check<00:02:38.940> out<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:39.420> sensor

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
want to do is check out the sensor

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.140 
want to do is check out the sensor
itself<00:02:40.410> see<00:02:41.190> if<00:02:41.280> you<00:02:41.370> can<00:02:41.490> spot<00:02:41.610> the<00:02:41.910> dust

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
itself see if you can spot the dust

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.300 
itself see if you can spot the dust
that's<00:02:42.330> on<00:02:42.540> it<00:02:42.720> a<00:02:42.870> good<00:02:43.380> tool<00:02:43.590> for<00:02:43.620> that<00:02:43.860> is

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
that's on it a good tool for that is

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.090 
that's on it a good tool for that is
something<00:02:44.760> like<00:02:44.970> this<00:02:45.180> the<00:02:45.740> belkin<00:02:46.740> sensor

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
something like this the belkin sensor

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.240 
something like this the belkin sensor
scope<00:02:47.340> and<00:02:47.520> all<00:02:48.360> it<00:02:48.510> is<00:02:48.600> lit<00:02:49.440> magnifying<00:02:50.070> loupe

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250

put it on once you press the button it

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.130 
put it on once you press the button it
will<00:02:56.460> shine<00:02:56.700> a<00:02:56.730> light<00:02:56.970> on<00:02:57.000> the<00:02:57.270> sensor<00:02:57.660> and

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
will shine a light on the sensor and

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.260 
will shine a light on the sensor and
you'll<00:02:58.380> get<00:02:58.590> a<00:02:58.620> good<00:02:58.770> idea<00:02:58.830> of<00:02:59.190> what<00:02:59.880> the<00:03:00.030> dust

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
you'll get a good idea of what the dust

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:05.030 
you'll get a good idea of what the dust
is<00:03:00.420> that<00:03:00.690> you're<00:03:00.810> looking<00:03:00.990> at<00:03:01.760> and<00:03:03.680> for<00:03:04.680> where

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
is that you're looking at and for where

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.500 
is that you're looking at and for where
I'm<00:03:05.220> seeing<00:03:05.580> here<00:03:05.820> it's<00:03:06.000> actually<00:03:06.360> pretty

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
I'm seeing here it's actually pretty

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:07.970 
I'm seeing here it's actually pretty
clean<00:03:06.900> but<00:03:07.260> I'm<00:03:07.350> still<00:03:07.560> going<00:03:07.650> to<00:03:07.770> show<00:03:07.920> you

clean but I'm still going to show you

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.050 
clean but I'm still going to show you
how<00:03:08.190> to<00:03:08.250> do<00:03:08.460> it<00:03:08.490> anyway<00:03:09.350> now<00:03:10.730> first<00:03:11.730> approach

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
sure the camera is aimed down put the

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.830 
sure the camera is aimed down put the
rocket<00:03:26.580> up<00:03:26.760> into<00:03:27.060> it<00:03:27.209> not<00:03:27.330> far<00:03:27.630> enough<00:03:27.720> to

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
rocket up into it not far enough to

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.930 
rocket up into it not far enough to
actually<00:03:28.110> make<00:03:28.410> contact<00:03:28.440> with<00:03:29.040> anything<00:03:29.370> a

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.940 

couple<00:03:32.940> of<00:03:33.150> good<00:03:33.330> shots<00:03:33.360> all<00:03:34.140> of<00:03:34.650> the<00:03:34.770> dust

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
couple of good shots all of the dust

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.660 
couple of good shots all of the dust
would<00:03:35.190> then<00:03:35.310> fall<00:03:35.580> out<00:03:35.850> of<00:03:35.880> the<00:03:36.090> camera<00:03:36.510> and

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
would then fall out of the camera and

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.120 
would then fall out of the camera and
you<00:03:38.670> end<00:03:38.880> up<00:03:39.060> with<00:03:39.570> a<00:03:39.630> fairly<00:03:40.080> clean<00:03:40.290> sensor<00:03:40.770> if

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
you end up with a fairly clean sensor if

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.940 
you end up with a fairly clean sensor if
you<00:03:41.489> find<00:03:41.790> that<00:03:41.880> that<00:03:42.330> doesn't<00:03:42.720> do<00:03:43.080> it<00:03:43.260> the

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
you find that that doesn't do it the

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.860 
you find that that doesn't do it the
next<00:03:44.100> approach<00:03:44.489> I<00:03:44.670> like<00:03:44.910> to<00:03:45.030> take<00:03:45.239> is

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
next approach I like to take is

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.020 
next approach I like to take is
something<00:03:46.350> in<00:03:46.530> a<00:03:46.620> dry<00:03:46.830> solution<00:03:47.459> like<00:03:47.850> the

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
something in a dry solution like the

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.350 
something in a dry solution like the
visible<00:03:48.390> dust<00:03:48.630> brush<00:03:49.220> this<00:03:50.220> is<00:03:50.370> their<00:03:50.519> 724

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
visible dust brush this is their 724

bright which actually has its own light
to<00:03:53.280> it<00:03:55.400> takes<00:03:56.400> triple<00:03:57.030> a<00:03:57.180> batteries<00:03:57.630> one

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
to it takes triple a batteries one

to it takes triple a batteries one
little<00:03:58.890> snap<00:03:59.670> of<00:03:59.850> the<00:04:00.000> brush<00:04:00.209> and<00:04:00.480> it<00:04:01.050> will

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
little snap of the brush and it will

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.310 
little snap of the brush and it will
actually<00:04:01.380> shake<00:04:01.800> all<00:04:02.010> of<00:04:02.160> the<00:04:02.250> dust<00:04:02.430> free<00:04:02.790> and

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:03.320 
actually shake all of the dust free and

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.900 
actually shake all of the dust free and
put<00:04:04.320> a<00:04:04.350> static<00:04:04.769> charge<00:04:04.800> into<00:04:05.310> the<00:04:05.400> brush<00:04:05.610> so

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
put a static charge into the brush so

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.110 
put a static charge into the brush so
that<00:04:06.060> you<00:04:06.209> can<00:04:06.390> then<00:04:06.510> get<00:04:06.750> in<00:04:06.930> there<00:04:07.200> and<00:04:08.120> very

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
that you can then get in there and very

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.080 
that you can then get in there and very
carefully<00:04:09.510> a<00:04:10.050> couple<00:04:10.890> passes<00:04:11.160> on<00:04:11.550> the<00:04:11.580> sensor

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
carefully a couple passes on the sensor

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.840 
carefully a couple passes on the sensor
will<00:04:12.870> get<00:04:13.019> it<00:04:13.140> nice<00:04:13.290> and<00:04:13.320> clean<00:04:13.709> for<00:04:13.739> you<00:04:14.190> and

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
will get it nice and clean for you and

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:18.440 
will get it nice and clean for you and
if<00:04:15.750> that<00:04:15.840> approach<00:04:16.830> doesn't<00:04:17.130> work<00:04:17.280> the<00:04:18.180> last

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
if that approach doesn't work the last

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.659 
if that approach doesn't work the last
step<00:04:18.720> I<00:04:18.959> recommend<00:04:19.470> to<00:04:19.590> anyone<00:04:19.919> and<00:04:20.280> this<00:04:20.519> is

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
step I recommend to anyone and this is

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:22.370 
step I recommend to anyone and this is
something<00:04:20.850> certainly<00:04:21.479> I<00:04:21.750> would<00:04:21.989> have<00:04:22.229> to

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
something certainly I would have to

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:23.690 
something certainly I would have to

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.230 

you<00:05:05.810> don't<00:05:05.960> have<00:05:06.110> to<00:05:06.230> saturate<00:05:06.770> it<00:05:06.890> but<00:05:07.880> just

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.240 
you don't have to saturate it but just

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.960 
you don't have to saturate it but just
get<00:05:08.420> a<00:05:08.450> couple<00:05:08.660> drops<00:05:08.930> in<00:05:09.200> there<00:05:09.380> and<00:05:09.730> it's<00:05:10.730> one

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:10.970 
get a couple drops in there and it's one

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:15.540 
get a couple drops in there and it's one
pass<00:05:11.270> and<00:05:12.190> then<00:05:13.190> one<00:05:13.400> pass<00:05:13.640> the<00:05:13.850> other<00:05:13.970> way<00:05:14.180> and

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:15.550 
pass and then one pass the other way and

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.550 
pass and then one pass the other way and
that<00:05:16.550> should<00:05:16.790> be<00:05:16.820> enough<00:05:17.080> just<00:05:18.080> to<00:05:18.170> take<00:05:18.350> off

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:18.560 
that should be enough just to take off

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.050 
that should be enough just to take off
anything<00:05:18.860> that<00:05:19.220> wouldn't<00:05:19.460> come<00:05:19.610> off<00:05:19.790> in<00:05:20.000> the

anything that wouldn't come off in the

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:24.490 
anything that wouldn't come off in the
first<00:05:20.240> two<00:05:20.720> tries<00:05:22.810> it<00:05:23.810> dries<00:05:24.050> very<00:05:24.380> quickly

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:24.500 
first two tries it dries very quickly
