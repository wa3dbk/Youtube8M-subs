00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:14.070
 document only knew that 33 550 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.470
 today years are found for a 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.650
 new video a beach on my flyer 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:24.300
 finally a fight that you all expect 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:27.720
 so it's all about age 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.480
 effect first so it looks like 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.189
 reindeer here salaf something she wants 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:37.469
 you make them there there 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:38.399
 here so when you did that we are 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.739
 not the drops 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.629
 we block earth precisely and you 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:47.190
 family of clicks that gilding rest at 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:49.550
 block and know-how develops 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.550
 diamonds 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.980
 it makes the diamond blocks 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:03.350
 so if you save the game 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:07.369
 had he therefore left direct to take the 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:14.720
 diamond blocks to have them on you 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:21.050
 so now so now you go 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:27.220
 do the same thing as that that the 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:27.220
 sorting so that's it 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.110
 I forgot to tell you that I'm going 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:36.010
 propose this video to click ac and 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:37.900
 to do in hoping that they accept me is 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:41.380
 what the other being patching and not 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:44.740
 accept so blister there that makes you 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:49.210
 not a current it's normal so there 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:50.759
 after the current is still there you 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:57.840
 go directly 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:57.840
 so wait i forgot here 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:05.009
 you take the rest we broke it 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.009
 you put him back teachers 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.450
 so I walked we broke everything 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.850
 here 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.270
 I put a diamond 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.800
 and I hope Bhutan 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.920
 it varies from a few earth cats and 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:33.950
 I hope the buttons click button 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:37.030
 right click and here we go 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.030
 just spam 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.060
 that's why go see I hope me and 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:49.550
 it makes me criteria and cubes in 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:52.190
 diamond that stops right here so 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:56.270
 that was the click and if you believe 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:03:02.320
 I did not know that after the non 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:02.320
 it's not that you know nothing because the part 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.460
 and they are no longer there 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:14.000
 there is more glaucous in diamonds 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:15.319
 I advise you to take but the 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.730
 take before looking at each other two 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:22.790
 parties otherwise you can not take 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:25.720
 to see diamond is limited so voila 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.200
 it was alex and 33 50 years old find themselves 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.879
 for the empty 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.879
 go ciao everyone
