now<00:01:36.690> what's<00:01:36.869> good<00:01:37.049> about<00:01:37.170> it<00:01:37.350> though<00:01:37.619> is<00:01:37.830> that

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150 
now what's good about it though is that

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.700 
now what's good about it though is that
it<00:01:39.150> gives<00:01:39.210> more<00:01:39.540> time<00:01:39.570> for<00:01:40.080> developers<00:01:40.560> make

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
it gives more time for developers make

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.950 
it gives more time for developers make

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
the game so if triac was thinking about

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.920 
the game so if triac was thinking about
selling<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:44.150> 2015<00:01:45.150> but<00:01:45.390> now<00:01:45.510> they<00:01:45.690> have<00:01:45.720> an
