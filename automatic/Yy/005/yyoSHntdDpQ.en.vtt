00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
exactly even like that I had somebody

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.700 
exactly even like that I had somebody
trim<00:02:08.740> it<00:02:08.860> for<00:02:09.010> me<00:02:09.190> I<00:02:09.550> usually<00:02:10.240> do<00:02:10.540> it<00:02:10.660> but<00:02:10.710> they

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
trim it for me I usually do it but they

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.710 
trim it for me I usually do it but they
were<00:02:11.770> like<00:02:11.980> oh<00:02:12.220> you<00:02:13.120> know<00:02:13.210> this<00:02:13.330> could<00:02:13.540> like

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
were like oh you know this could like

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.630 
were like oh you know this could like
bring<00:02:14.020> us<00:02:14.140> closer<00:02:14.410> hair<00:02:14.890> is<00:02:15.070> such<00:02:15.280> a<00:02:15.310> big<00:02:15.610> thing

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
bring us closer hair is such a big thing

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.450 
bring us closer hair is such a big thing
so<00:02:16.150> I<00:02:16.570> thought<00:02:16.960> why<00:02:17.230> not<00:02:17.260> give<00:02:17.680> her<00:02:17.800> a<00:02:17.920> try

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
so I thought why not give her a try

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.030 
so I thought why not give her a try
and<00:02:18.550> she<00:02:18.970> completely<00:02:19.690> messed<00:02:20.050> up<00:02:20.260> but<00:02:20.620> it's

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
and she completely messed up but it's

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.210 
and she completely messed up but it's
okay<00:02:21.460> I<00:02:21.490> guess<00:02:21.850> it's<00:02:22.720> not<00:02:22.810> that<00:02:22.870> bad<00:02:23.230> but<00:02:23.710> I

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
okay I guess it's not that bad but I

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.820 
okay I guess it's not that bad but I
usually<00:02:24.550> have<00:02:24.760> them<00:02:25.120> longer<00:02:25.960> to<00:02:26.410> the<00:02:26.530> point

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
usually have them longer to the point

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.910 
usually have them longer to the point
where<00:02:26.980> I<00:02:27.070> can<00:02:27.280> like<00:02:28.170> actually<00:02:29.170> style<00:02:29.590> a<00:02:29.740> with

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
where I can like actually style a with
