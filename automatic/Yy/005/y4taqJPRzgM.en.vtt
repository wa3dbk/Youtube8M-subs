separate<00:03:12.239> from<00:03:12.269> the<00:03:12.450> disk<00:03:12.660> so<00:03:12.810> they're

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
separate from the disk so they're

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.080

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
the same exact thing so and that's

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.009 
the same exact thing so and that's
basically<00:03:19.650> the<00:03:20.640> packaging<00:03:21.150> itself<00:03:21.480> one<00:03:21.780> thing

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019
