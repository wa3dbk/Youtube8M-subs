00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:06.940 
pasta shells I rinse them with cold
water<00:02:05.060> this<00:02:05.479> stops<00:02:05.929> any<00:02:06.140> additional<00:02:06.560> cooking

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
water this stops any additional cooking

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.040 
water this stops any additional cooking
and<00:02:07.189> it<00:02:07.429> also<00:02:07.549> makes<00:02:07.909> the<00:02:08.060> shells<00:02:08.330> just<00:02:08.479> easier

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
and it also makes the shells just easier

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.500 
and it also makes the shells just easier
to<00:02:09.110> handle<00:02:09.649> and<00:02:09.769> stuffing<00:02:10.069> I<00:02:10.429> also<00:02:10.879> added<00:02:11.239> a

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
to handle and stuffing I also added a

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.070 
to handle and stuffing I also added a
nice<00:02:11.690> thick<00:02:12.080> layer<00:02:12.110> probably<00:02:12.920> mmm<00:02:13.930> this<00:02:14.930> is

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
nice thick layer probably mmm this is

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.890 
nice thick layer probably mmm this is
about<00:02:15.319> a<00:02:15.379> half<00:02:15.620> an<00:02:15.920> inch<00:02:16.040> deep<00:02:16.489> of<00:02:16.760> sauce<00:02:17.569> and

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
about a half an inch deep of sauce and

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.410 
about a half an inch deep of sauce and
that<00:02:18.230> will<00:02:18.440> help<00:02:18.590> keep<00:02:18.950> the<00:02:19.310> pasta<00:02:20.180> shells

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
that will help keep the pasta shells

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.500 
that will help keep the pasta shells
from<00:02:20.750> sticking<00:02:21.200> on<00:02:21.349> the<00:02:21.500> bottom<00:02:22.120> okay<00:02:23.120> so<00:02:23.180> we

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
from sticking on the bottom okay so we

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.530 
from sticking on the bottom okay so we
