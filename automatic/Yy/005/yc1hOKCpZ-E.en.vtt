00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.490
 Hello everyone and welcome back about Italy 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.340
 maker go ahead with the heading 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.680
 started last week with the choice 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.779
 of the best lenses for reflex cameras 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.849
 last week they had taken care of 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.129
 the most professional ones therefore for full 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.780
 evolved frames and enthusiasts 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:35.519
 today let's talk instead of 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.960
 goals and for those approaching the world 

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:38.850
 of the reflex 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.540
 so he took the classic SLR with 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.449
 of 155 in kit and wants to change lens 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.949
 to have something more 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:50.219
 let's talk all today we'll talk 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:52.559
 of objectives only and for aps c 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.570
 specifics will persist psc then all 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.359
 measurements and mm that we will see you must 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.370
 consider them with a cross of 1.5 per 

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:02.370
 given precisely by the aps sensor c 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.100
 let's start with the wide angles the first 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:09.420
 wide angle as cheaper than 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:11.580
 we find is the canon 10 18 f 45 56 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.990
 a lens not very bright 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.210
 quite dark but equipped with 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.470
 optical stabilizer which presents itself 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:22.380
 price of 270 euros being a 10 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:24.479
 increases somewhat in appearance 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.970
 wide-angle compared to our 18 mm 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.979
 it allows more landscape photos 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.220
 if we want to spend a little more 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.830
 let's go to 10 22 always canon f 3 e 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.220
 half four and a half has a cost of 500 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:40.830
 euro is more expensive it is not stabilized but has 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.289
 a more solid construction and a sharpness 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.509
 definitely better and less vignetting 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:47.280
 distortions of his younger brother 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.099
 wanting to still go up in quality 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.039
 let's try the sigma 8 16 mm four e 

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:56.429
 half f 56 this goal costs almost 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:58.530
 600 euros but it is the biggest wide angle 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:01.160
 that we find on the market for aps co 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:05.369
 precisely being 18 mm it has really wide 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:08.429
 it has an excellent construction to an undergoes 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:11.330
 bit of vignette and distortions to 8 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:15.390
 mm but still the price that is not bad 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:18.300
 and it is certainly better than 10 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.129
 18 10 22 instead has a very good quality for 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.980
 the price he has for anyway for the 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:27.120
 sector where it is inserted passing to 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:29.909
 tamron 73 is an excellent goal 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.640
 100 ultrasonic stabilized occurs 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:32.890
 a fee 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.569
 350 is now there is a lot of respect just 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.060
 out we have already reviewed it because it is 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:39.760
 a goal that we have found in God 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.980
 in our previous videos a 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.319
 goal however stands out for a 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:47.050
 low price and a great excursion of 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:48.970
 focal length in fact reach 300 mm is not 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:52.690
 bad especially on aps c is really 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:54.490
 long to good sharpness at 300 mm 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:58.989
 loses a little bit but it's not bad 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:03:01.270
 the focus is not very fast but there 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:04.750
 still allows you to play sports 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:05.980
 recently has no strong entrance does not have 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.510
 big teeth problems for the price 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.910
 which is a great goal 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.680
 wanting to go up in quality we find the 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:15.459
 whites I did n't say bianchino that the 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.620
 canon 70 200 f 4 not stabilized is 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:18.910
 probably the best of the goal 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.550
 in terms of fidenza that can be found 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:24.190
 without going to the f4 stabilized the effe 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:26.860
 28 which rise in price in a manner 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:29.650
 very high this objective f 4 in fact 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.840
 over the entire focal length from 70 200 always f4 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.900
 not stabilized it costs 500 euros 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.840
 it's really the top in terms of 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.940
 vignetting sharpness is all passing by 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:44.760
 instead to the macro objectives we find the 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:48.970
 tamron 60 mm f 2 macro this lens 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:50.650
 1 will say a 60 mm macro is short 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.049
 precisely to white consider the crop 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.610
 factor therefore increases the focal like 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:56.079
 being a macro lens it stands out 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.600
 for a future enlargement one by 

00:03:56.079 --> 00:04:00.070
 therefore it is a mass a putting distance 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.329
 more reduced focus than others 

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:03.670
 goals allows us to take pictures 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:06.670
 close to the objects has a cost of 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.230
 350 euros and has excellent evidence as 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.519
 almost all the objectives but with a 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.690
 fee of superior race to others 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:12.459
 targets 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.230
 being designed to take photos 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:15.880
 close to the objects if we want 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.590
 spend a little more and get one 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.030
 the longest focal point is the sigma which 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.049
 we have already talked about it being the best 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.030
 price ratio as well for i 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:25.210
 professionals so it's okay to try 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:28.570
 very good for fans too 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:31.120
 starting which is the sigma 105 mm f 2 8 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:34.270
 stabilized and has a cost of 430 euros 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.950
 but a really incredible sharpness 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.470
 it's also the stabilizer that helps 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:40.419
 always the absolute goal instead 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.940
 cheaper than allows you to 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:44.139
 take pictures in any condition 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.759
 light 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:48.550
 to improve your composition 

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:51.129
 because it is a landline so if you are 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.990
 forced you do n't have you can't zoom 

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:54.719
 so summer still has changed 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:59.050
 composition once you move 

00:04:54.719 --> 00:05:02.020
 looking for the best light is canon 50 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:03.759
 mm f 18 a very light lens 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.460
 compact you can always carry around 

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:08.199
 in your pocket you want f18 so you can 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.659
 shoot at night with iso values 

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:12.939
 very low and still have photos anyway 

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:15.669
 bright costs 100 euros so it costs 

00:05:12.939 --> 00:05:17.650
 nothing is a little plasticy construction 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:19.569
 does not give a feeling solidity but for the 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:22.270
 price you really have for those who start 

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:23.500
 it's a must once and have because I was 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.969
 really fantastic goal 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.939
 especially for those who make video 

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:32.710
 very comfortable to be able to work f18 because 

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:36.099
 in fact, you keep very low ISO values 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:38.080
 furthermore f 1 and 8 allows us to have 

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:39.879
 that fantastic bokeh effect that much 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:42.759
 often economies are sought than with 

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:45.249
 targets like 18 55 building from 

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:48.430
 get then for the price he has 

00:05:45.249 --> 00:05:50.229
 really recommend it to everyone for 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:52.389
 this review on goals for 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:55.599
 who starts photography for those who do 

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:59.039
 approaching this world for aps c Ã¨ 

00:05:55.599 --> 00:05:59.039
 all this from a maker of italy
