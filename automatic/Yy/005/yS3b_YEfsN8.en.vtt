00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
this one also seems kind of stupid and

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.370 
this one also seems kind of stupid and
we<00:02:45.180> probably<00:02:45.360> seen<00:02:45.630> them<00:02:45.750> Twitter<00:02:46.020> but<00:02:46.290> it

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
we probably seen them Twitter but it

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:47.690 
we probably seen them Twitter but it
actually<00:02:46.500> does<00:02:46.770> work<00:02:46.920> like<00:02:47.100> it<00:02:47.250> does<00:02:47.460> actually

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
actually does work like it does actually

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.180 
actually does work like it does actually
that<00:02:47.970> motivate<00:02:48.390> you<00:02:48.420> to<00:02:48.540> learn<00:02:49.260> stuff<00:02:49.800> study

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
that motivate you to learn stuff study

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.160 
that motivate you to learn stuff study
so<00:02:50.610> basically<00:02:50.880> if<00:02:51.210> you<00:02:51.330> learn<00:02:51.600> an<00:02:51.780> essay<00:02:52.020> off

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
so basically if you learn an essay off

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.660 
so basically if you learn an essay off
as<00:02:52.380> we<00:02:52.470> all<00:02:52.590> laughed<00:02:52.770> in<00:02:52.890> our<00:02:52.950> essays<00:02:53.310> or<00:02:53.550> if

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
as we all laughed in our essays or if

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.580 
as we all laughed in our essays or if
it's<00:02:53.790> a<00:02:53.850> poem<00:02:54.090> or<00:02:54.390> whatever<00:02:54.690> it<00:02:54.840> is<00:02:54.960> after

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
it's a poem or whatever it is after

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.560 
it's a poem or whatever it is after
let's<00:02:55.800> say<00:02:55.920> either<00:02:56.550> each<00:02:56.820> paragraph<00:02:57.150> for<00:02:57.540> each

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
let's say either each paragraph for each

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.750 
let's say either each paragraph for each
a<00:02:57.780> few<00:02:57.959> lines<00:02:58.140> that<00:02:58.350> ever<00:02:58.470> put<00:02:59.130> a<00:02:59.160> suite<00:02:59.489> at<00:02:59.670> the

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
a few lines that ever put a suite at the

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.210 
a few lines that ever put a suite at the
end<00:03:00.090> of<00:03:00.270> each<00:03:00.390> thingy<00:03:01.230> so<00:03:01.620> you'll<00:03:02.130> be

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
end of each thingy so you'll be

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.949 
end of each thingy so you'll be
motivated<00:03:02.760> to<00:03:02.790> learn<00:03:02.970> it<00:03:03.180> I<00:03:03.420> realize<00:03:03.780> now<00:03:03.930> that

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
motivated to learn it I realize now that

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.479 
motivated to learn it I realize now that
this<00:03:04.350> might<00:03:04.620> not<00:03:04.770> work<00:03:04.830> for<00:03:05.160> people<00:03:05.400> because

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
this might not work for people because

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:06.680 
this might not work for people because
some<00:03:05.790> people<00:03:06.030> because<00:03:06.209> they<00:03:06.330> were<00:03:06.420> just<00:03:06.510> like

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
some people because they were just like

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.050 
some people because they were just like
eat<00:03:06.900> the<00:03:07.020> sweets<00:03:07.260> if<00:03:07.470> you<00:03:07.590> like<00:03:07.739> omnomnom<00:03:08.430> well
