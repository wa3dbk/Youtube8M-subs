outside and it's mating stock shim which
is<00:01:09.590> going<00:01:09.740> to<00:01:09.800> go<00:01:09.920> on<00:01:10.039> the<00:01:10.130> outside<00:01:10.630> along<00:01:11.630> with

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
is going to go on the outside along with

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:15.160 
is going to go on the outside along with
a<00:01:12.229> new<00:01:13.039> bolt<00:01:13.850> that's<00:01:14.390> going<00:01:14.479> to<00:01:14.630> go<00:01:14.750> on<00:01:14.780> the

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
a new bolt that's going to go on the

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.200 
a new bolt that's going to go on the
outside<00:01:15.320> the<00:01:15.979> came<00:01:16.190> of<00:01:16.340> the<00:01:16.399> bearing<00:01:16.729> kit<00:01:16.910> so

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
outside the came of the bearing kit so

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.339 
outside the came of the bearing kit so
our<00:01:17.770> carrier<00:01:18.770> and<00:01:19.009> our<00:01:19.750> pinion<00:01:20.750> are<00:01:20.929> ready<00:01:21.200> to

00:01:21.339 --> 00:01:21.349 
our carrier and our pinion are ready to

00:01:21.349 --> 00:01:27.699 
our carrier and our pinion are ready to
go<00:01:21.759> looking<00:01:22.759> good<00:01:25.539> and<00:01:26.539> so<00:01:27.229> with<00:01:27.470> our<00:01:27.500> new

00:01:27.699 --> 00:01:27.709 
go looking good and so with our new

00:01:27.709 --> 00:01:32.529 
go looking good and so with our new
races<00:01:28.190> in<00:01:28.369> place<00:01:29.740> in<00:01:30.740> goes<00:01:31.039> our<00:01:31.280> opinion<00:01:32.270> ready

00:01:32.529 --> 00:01:32.539 
races in place in goes our opinion ready

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:44.430 
races in place in goes our opinion ready
to<00:01:32.800> go<00:01:33.800> in<00:01:33.979> and<00:01:34.190> hopefully<00:01:34.580> have<00:01:35.330> a<00:01:35.360> long<00:01:35.690> life

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:44.440 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:51.630 

and<00:01:45.440> we<00:01:46.429> put<00:01:46.580> a<00:01:46.610> new<00:01:46.789> seal<00:01:47.090> on<00:01:47.420> the<00:01:47.569> front<00:01:47.840> side

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.320 

which<00:01:52.640> can<00:01:52.880> be<00:01:53.090> tapped<00:01:53.539> in<00:01:53.810> and<00:01:54.970> then<00:01:55.970> the

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
which can be tapped in and then the

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.900 
which can be tapped in and then the
pinion<00:01:57.050> flange<00:01:57.200> just<00:01:57.890> gets<00:01:58.099> tapped<00:01:58.369> back<00:01:58.640> on

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:58.910 
pinion flange just gets tapped back on

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.389 
pinion flange just gets tapped back on
lightly<00:01:59.360> to<00:01:59.630> position<00:02:00.080> it<00:02:00.200> and<00:02:00.399> then

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:01.399 
lightly to position it and then

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:03.550 
lightly to position it and then
ultimately<00:02:01.550> the<00:02:01.970> pinion<00:02:02.420> nut<00:02:02.450> will<00:02:02.840> suck<00:02:03.410> it

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
ultimately the pinion nut will suck it

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.480 
ultimately the pinion nut will suck it
in<00:02:03.709> when<00:02:04.520> we<00:02:04.640> tighten<00:02:04.940> that<00:02:05.000> down

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:08.490 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.390 

so<00:02:09.490> the<00:02:09.759> process<00:02:10.149> for<00:02:10.770> setting<00:02:11.770> the<00:02:11.980> pinion

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
so the process for setting the pinion

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.030 
so the process for setting the pinion
bearing<00:02:12.430> preload<00:02:13.360> is<00:02:13.750> a<00:02:14.370> slow<00:02:15.370> process<00:02:15.960> of

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
bearing preload is a slow process of

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.550 
bearing preload is a slow process of
locking<00:02:18.040> the<00:02:18.430> pinion<00:02:19.360> flange<00:02:19.510> in<00:02:19.870> place<00:02:20.140> in

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
locking the pinion flange in place in

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.350 
locking the pinion flange in place in
this<00:02:20.680> case<00:02:20.950> I<00:02:21.250> used<00:02:21.490> a<00:02:21.990> a<00:02:23.160> punch<00:02:24.160> that<00:02:24.790> went

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
this case I used a a punch that went

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.740 
this case I used a a punch that went
through<00:02:25.600> one<00:02:25.900> of<00:02:25.930> the<00:02:26.080> bolt<00:02:26.260> holes<00:02:26.590> and<00:02:27.750> locked

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
through one of the bolt holes and locked

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.449 
through one of the bolt holes and locked
itself<00:02:29.140> against<00:02:29.560> the<00:02:29.650> differential<00:02:30.340> housing

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
itself against the differential housing

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:32.400 
itself against the differential housing
and<00:02:30.910> you're<00:02:31.390> tightening<00:02:31.600> it<00:02:31.870> little<00:02:32.260> by

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
and you're tightening it little by

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.830 
and you're tightening it little by
little<00:02:32.440> about<00:02:33.430> an<00:02:33.580> eighth<00:02:33.700> of<00:02:33.880> a<00:02:33.970> turn<00:02:34.180> at<00:02:34.510> a

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
little about an eighth of a turn at a

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.250 
little about an eighth of a turn at a
time<00:02:35.200> and<00:02:35.560> checking<00:02:36.550> it<00:02:36.870> periodically<00:02:37.870> with

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
time and checking it periodically with

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.880 
time and checking it periodically with
your<00:02:38.709> inch<00:02:38.950> pound<00:02:39.280> torque<00:02:39.430> wrench<00:02:40.470> until<00:02:41.470> you

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
your inch pound torque wrench until you

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.880 
your inch pound torque wrench until you
start<00:02:42.190> to<00:02:42.280> get<00:02:42.630> some<00:02:43.630> drag<00:02:43.900> on<00:02:44.170> it<00:02:44.380> and<00:02:44.530> then

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
start to get some drag on it and then

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.280 
start to get some drag on it and then
you<00:02:44.980> want<00:02:45.160> to<00:02:45.220> look<00:02:45.370> for<00:02:45.989> getting<00:02:46.989> the<00:02:47.110> right

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
you want to look for getting the right

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.800 
you want to look for getting the right
amount<00:02:47.410> of<00:02:47.680> drag<00:02:47.950> or<00:02:48.280> preload<00:02:48.820> on<00:02:49.060> that<00:02:49.600> inch

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
amount of drag or preload on that inch

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.800 
amount of drag or preload on that inch
pound<00:02:50.110> torque<00:02:50.260> wrench<00:02:50.770> and<00:02:51.130> you<00:02:51.630> just<00:02:52.630> keep

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
pound torque wrench and you just keep

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.960 
pound torque wrench and you just keep
tightening<00:02:53.110> it<00:02:53.440> incrementally<00:02:54.220> a<00:02:54.430> little<00:02:54.850> bit

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
tightening it incrementally a little bit

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.240 
tightening it incrementally a little bit
at<00:02:55.090> a<00:02:55.180> time<00:02:55.209> you<00:02:55.660> never<00:02:55.810> want<00:02:56.170> to<00:02:56.260> go<00:02:56.680> too<00:02:56.739> far

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
at a time you never want to go too far

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.960 
at a time you never want to go too far
and<00:02:58.470> overdo<00:02:59.470> it<00:02:59.500> because<00:02:59.830> once<00:03:00.580> the<00:03:00.640> crush

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
and overdo it because once the crush

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.240 
and overdo it because once the crush
leave<00:03:01.270> reaches<00:03:01.810> the<00:03:01.959> right<00:03:02.140> preload<00:03:03.070> you

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
leave reaches the right preload you

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.370 
leave reaches the right preload you
don't<00:03:03.400> want<00:03:03.670> to<00:03:03.970> go<00:03:04.360> any<00:03:04.510> farther<00:03:04.870> you<00:03:05.170> can't

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
don't want to go any farther you can't

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.030 
don't want to go any farther you can't
back<00:03:05.590> it<00:03:05.800> off<00:03:05.980> if<00:03:06.280> you<00:03:06.790> go<00:03:07.060> too<00:03:07.120> far<00:03:07.770> so<00:03:08.770> you<00:03:08.800> go

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
back it off if you go too far so you go

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.130 
back it off if you go too far so you go
little<00:03:09.310> by<00:03:09.400> little<00:03:09.640> 1/8<00:03:10.180> of<00:03:10.330> a<00:03:10.450> turn<00:03:10.630> at<00:03:10.810> a<00:03:10.900> time

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
little by little 1/8 of a turn at a time

little by little 1/8 of a turn at a time
check<00:03:11.860> for<00:03:12.100> drag<00:03:12.340> when<00:03:13.000> you<00:03:13.090> start<00:03:13.360> to<00:03:13.480> feel

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
check for drag when you start to feel

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.570 
check for drag when you start to feel
the<00:03:13.900> drag<00:03:14.140> you<00:03:14.440> can<00:03:14.620> start<00:03:15.040> to<00:03:15.130> check<00:03:15.340> it<00:03:15.489> with

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
the drag you can start to check it with

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.640 
the drag you can start to check it with
your<00:03:15.640> inch<00:03:15.910> pound<00:03:16.180> torque<00:03:16.390> wrench<00:03:17.350> and<00:03:17.590> this

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
your inch pound torque wrench and this

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:23.670 
your inch pound torque wrench and this
is<00:03:17.799> a<00:03:17.830> beam-style<00:03:18.900> torque<00:03:19.900> wrench<00:03:20.340> and<00:03:22.680> you

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
is a beam-style torque wrench and you

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.440 
is a beam-style torque wrench and you
can<00:03:23.860> see<00:03:24.130> that<00:03:24.459> it<00:03:24.610> doesn't<00:03:24.910> start<00:03:25.090> to<00:03:25.239> turn

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
can see that it doesn't start to turn

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.990 
can see that it doesn't start to turn
until<00:03:25.870> I<00:03:25.900> hit<00:03:26.140> about<00:03:26.440> the<00:03:26.739> 24<00:03:27.280> inch<00:03:27.640> pound

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
until I hit about the 24 inch pound

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.110 
until I hit about the 24 inch pound
range<00:03:28.330> and<00:03:28.660> then<00:03:29.320> it<00:03:29.500> comes<00:03:29.739> along<00:03:30.100> nice<00:03:30.820> and

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
range and then it comes along nice and

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.600 
range and then it comes along nice and
easy<00:03:31.269> and<00:03:31.600> that's<00:03:32.530> exactly<00:03:32.950> what<00:03:33.280> we're<00:03:33.459> after

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
easy and that's exactly what we're after

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.320 
easy and that's exactly what we're after
so<00:03:34.480> I<00:03:34.799> think<00:03:35.799> our<00:03:36.040> pinion<00:03:36.430> preload<00:03:36.880> is<00:03:37.060> good

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
so I think our pinion preload is good

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.440 
so I think our pinion preload is good
our<00:03:38.049> new<00:03:38.320> pinion<00:03:39.040> is<00:03:39.190> in<00:03:39.340> there<00:03:39.580> if<00:03:39.940> you

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
our new pinion is in there if you

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.120 
our new pinion is in there if you
remember<00:03:40.870> when<00:03:41.019> we<00:03:41.049> started<00:03:41.590> there<00:03:41.799> was<00:03:41.890> a<00:03:41.920> lot

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
remember when we started there was a lot

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.940 
remember when we started there was a lot
of<00:03:42.160> play<00:03:42.459> in<00:03:42.489> this<00:03:42.820> whole<00:03:43.269> pinion<00:03:43.750> flange<00:03:43.950> it

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
of play in this whole pinion flange it

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.920 
of play in this whole pinion flange it
was<00:03:45.250> loose<00:03:45.610> you<00:03:45.940> could<00:03:46.120> actually<00:03:46.269> shake<00:03:46.720> this

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
was loose you could actually shake this

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.530 
was loose you could actually shake this
thing<00:03:46.989> and<00:03:47.410> wiggle<00:03:48.190> it<00:03:48.280> well<00:03:49.239> there's<00:03:49.420> no

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
thing and wiggle it well there's no

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.020 
thing and wiggle it well there's no
wiggle<00:03:49.870> in<00:03:49.989> it<00:03:50.019> now<00:03:50.290> and<00:03:50.560> the<00:03:51.190> preload<00:03:51.640> is<00:03:51.850> now

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
wiggle in it now and the preload is now

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.970 
wiggle in it now and the preload is now
set<00:03:52.470> to<00:03:53.470> the<00:03:53.650> correct<00:03:54.660> freeload<00:03:55.660> tolerance<00:03:56.230> so

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
set to the correct freeload tolerance so

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.140 
set to the correct freeload tolerance so
I<00:03:57.340> would<00:03:58.299> say<00:03:58.480> our<00:03:58.510> pinion<00:03:58.989> is<00:03:59.670> good<00:04:00.670> to<00:04:00.790> go<00:04:00.940> and

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
I would say our pinion is good to go and

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:18.699 
I would say our pinion is good to go and
we<00:04:01.660> can<00:04:01.690> put<00:04:01.989> in<00:04:02.079> the<00:04:02.370> carrier

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:23.780 

and<00:04:19.709> we<00:04:20.489> will<00:04:21.560> try<00:04:22.560> slipping<00:04:23.010> a<00:04:23.100> shim<00:04:23.400> in<00:04:23.610> on

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
and we will try slipping a shim in on

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:37.189 
and we will try slipping a shim in on
this<00:04:24.530> left<00:04:25.530> side<00:04:25.650> now<00:04:30.800> and

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:37.199 

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:53.530 

perhaps<00:04:37.979> one<00:04:38.400> more<00:04:40.069> persuaded

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:53.540 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:58.510 

and<00:04:55.270> so<00:04:56.270> we're<00:04:56.420> getting<00:04:56.600> a<00:04:57.010> series<00:04:58.010> of<00:04:58.040> shims

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
and so we're getting a series of shims

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.640 
and so we're getting a series of shims
on<00:04:58.910> the<00:04:59.060> left<00:04:59.270> side<00:04:59.540> that<00:04:59.570> we're<00:04:59.990> just<00:05:00.110> tucking

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
on the left side that we're just tucking

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:05.470 
on the left side that we're just tucking
in<00:05:01.360> just<00:05:02.360> to<00:05:02.600> get<00:05:02.780> it<00:05:02.930> until<00:05:03.110> it's<00:05:04.180> snug<00:05:05.180> in

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:05.480 
in just to get it until it's snug in

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:15.190 
in just to get it until it's snug in
there<00:05:05.690> and<00:05:05.900> happy<00:05:13.270> so<00:05:14.270> our<00:05:14.360> bearing<00:05:14.690> caps<00:05:14.930> go

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:15.200 
there and happy so our bearing caps go

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.730 
there and happy so our bearing caps go
back<00:05:15.410> on<00:05:15.680> same<00:05:16.430> side<00:05:16.700> they<00:05:16.910> came<00:05:17.150> from<00:05:17.740> arrows

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
back on same side they came from arrows

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:31.180 
back on same side they came from arrows
pointed<00:05:19.220> outward<00:05:29.590> so<00:05:30.590> I've<00:05:30.770> ended<00:05:31.010> up<00:05:31.130> with

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.190 
pointed outward so I've ended up with

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:34.660 
pointed outward so I've ended up with
the<00:05:31.580> combination<00:05:32.420> of<00:05:32.710> two<00:05:33.710> shims<00:05:34.130> on<00:05:34.490> each

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:34.670 
the combination of two shims on each

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:36.730 
the combination of two shims on each
side<00:05:35.300> of<00:05:35.330> the<00:05:35.870> carrier

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:36.740 
side of the carrier

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:40.300 
side of the carrier
the<00:05:37.520> original<00:05:38.000> shims<00:05:38.590> after<00:05:39.590> it<00:05:39.710> was<00:05:39.830> reburied

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:40.310 
the original shims after it was reburied

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:43.600 
the original shims after it was reburied
were<00:05:40.790> just<00:05:41.120> too<00:05:41.330> tight<00:05:41.600> and<00:05:42.160> luckily<00:05:43.160> I<00:05:43.190> was

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:43.610 
were just too tight and luckily I was

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:48.610 
were just too tight and luckily I was
able<00:05:43.640> to<00:05:44.030> access<00:05:44.240> a<00:05:46.300> collection<00:05:47.300> of<00:05:47.480> shims<00:05:48.110> and

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:48.620 
able to access a collection of shims and

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:51.190 
able to access a collection of shims and
I've<00:05:49.610> gone<00:05:49.820> through<00:05:49.880> the<00:05:50.270> process<00:05:50.510> of

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:51.200 
I've gone through the process of

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.500 
I've gone through the process of
switching<00:05:51.980> shims<00:05:52.550> back<00:05:52.850> and<00:05:53.090> forth<00:05:53.330> between

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:53.510 
switching shims back and forth between

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:55.060 
switching shims back and forth between
the<00:05:53.840> left<00:05:54.050> and<00:05:54.230> right<00:05:54.380> side<00:05:54.620> of<00:05:54.650> the<00:05:54.800> carrier

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:55.070 
the left and right side of the carrier

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:57.220 
the left and right side of the carrier
in<00:05:55.400> order<00:05:55.640> to<00:05:55.730> position<00:05:56.000> the<00:05:56.270> gears<00:05:56.540> properly

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:57.230 
in order to position the gears properly

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:00.730 
in order to position the gears properly
to<00:05:58.130> get<00:05:58.280> the<00:05:58.400> carrier<00:05:58.990> ring<00:05:59.990> gear<00:06:00.170> positioning

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:00.740 
to get the carrier ring gear positioning

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:02.980 
to get the carrier ring gear positioning
correct<00:06:01.070> and<00:06:01.370> I've<00:06:02.030> ended<00:06:02.270> up<00:06:02.360> with<00:06:02.420> two<00:06:02.750> shims

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:02.990 
correct and I've ended up with two shims

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:05.260 
correct and I've ended up with two shims
on<00:06:03.230> each<00:06:03.380> side<00:06:03.680> that<00:06:03.710> basically<00:06:04.550> have

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:05.270 
on each side that basically have

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:07.600 
on each side that basically have
provided<00:06:05.690> for<00:06:06.050> the<00:06:06.320> correct<00:06:06.680> gear

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:07.610 
provided for the correct gear

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:10.390 
provided for the correct gear
positioning<00:06:08.420> and<00:06:08.660> the<00:06:08.720> correct<00:06:09.170> pattern<00:06:09.500> once

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:10.400 
positioning and the correct pattern once

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:14.920 
positioning and the correct pattern once
we<00:06:10.610> have<00:06:10.910> a<00:06:10.940> look<00:06:11.260> at<00:06:12.260> the<00:06:12.500> gears<00:06:13.630> under<00:06:14.630> load

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:14.930 
we have a look at the gears under load

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:17.380 
we have a look at the gears under load
we<00:06:15.560> get<00:06:15.860> a<00:06:16.040> gear<00:06:16.400> pattern<00:06:16.790> which<00:06:16.970> has<00:06:17.180> been

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:17.390 
we get a gear pattern which has been

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:20.350 
we get a gear pattern which has been
painted<00:06:18.140> and<00:06:18.350> run<00:06:19.160> through<00:06:19.460> a<00:06:19.490> few<00:06:19.760> times<00:06:19.970> a

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:20.360 
painted and run through a few times a

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:23.040 
painted and run through a few times a
few<00:06:20.540> cycles<00:06:20.780> and<00:06:21.260> you<00:06:21.320> can<00:06:21.890> see<00:06:22.100> the<00:06:22.280> load

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:23.050 
few cycles and you can see the load

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:26.620 
few cycles and you can see the load
pattern<00:06:24.050> on<00:06:24.290> the<00:06:24.890> gears<00:06:25.220> there<00:06:25.610> through<00:06:26.480> the

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:26.630 
pattern on the gears there through the

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:32.040 
pattern on the gears there through the
paint<00:06:26.900> is<00:06:28.300> right<00:06:29.300> in<00:06:29.960> the<00:06:30.290> middle<00:06:30.560> area<00:06:30.950> it's

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:32.050 
paint is right in the middle area it's

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:34.870 
paint is right in the middle area it's
looks<00:06:33.050> like<00:06:33.140> a<00:06:33.230> very<00:06:33.500> good<00:06:33.770> pattern<00:06:34.250> so<00:06:34.610> that's

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:34.880 
looks like a very good pattern so that's

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.630 
looks like a very good pattern so that's
what<00:06:35.030> we're<00:06:35.150> after<00:06:35.300> and<00:06:36.160> it<00:06:37.160> looks<00:06:37.370> like<00:06:37.490> our

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:37.640 
what we're after and it looks like our

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:41.730 
what we're after and it looks like our
differential<00:06:38.270> is<00:06:38.770> just<00:06:39.770> about<00:06:39.950> ready<00:06:40.220> to<00:06:40.310> go

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:41.740 
differential is just about ready to go

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:46.840 
differential is just about ready to go
and<00:06:42.970> so<00:06:43.970> with<00:06:44.330> all<00:06:45.110> of<00:06:45.380> the<00:06:45.640> mechanical<00:06:46.640> work

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:46.850 
and so with all of the mechanical work

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:49.180 
and so with all of the mechanical work
done<00:06:47.180> you<00:06:47.210> can<00:06:47.780> replace<00:06:48.320> your<00:06:48.380> differential

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:49.190 
done you can replace your differential

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:52.450 
done you can replace your differential
cover<00:06:49.370> with<00:06:49.730> some<00:06:49.910> good<00:06:50.060> sealant<00:06:50.540> and<00:06:51.460> snug

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:52.460
