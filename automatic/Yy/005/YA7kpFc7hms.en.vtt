00:00:02.709 --> 00:00:03.740
 by men 

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.140
 because a man in this world perform 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.230
 its male function and the woman should 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:11.180

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:12.399

 and perform their female functions 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:18.550
 at home there is also a division of labor 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.750
 and segregation of duties and 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:22.900
 separation sorry even by physical 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:23.880

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.450
 unisex equals not only man 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.360
 a woman and a town with a village but then 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.420

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.580

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.870
 individuality by the way 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.770
 real it means to be yourself 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.440
 and each person is very strong 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.450
 different from other people 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.330

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.820
 individuality is manifested 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.540
 if we start hay city the same 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.700

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.700
 identical shirts identical hairstyles 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.380
 I do not know someone's bare skull of men now 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.690
 I understand fashionable if a man is completely bald 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:47.870
 of course maybe syria is worth shaving 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:49.290
 until the end but 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.050
 these are very short women 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.910
 haircuts which 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:57.490
 previously only slaves were worn so as not to 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.450
 an insect from excess 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.290
 quantities there yes 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.220
 I think it is not quite so to say 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.520
 right for women 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.649
 a woman can still be good 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.669
 so that she has 

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:12.829
 long hair 

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:16.209
 luxurious eyelashes elfimov

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:27.129
