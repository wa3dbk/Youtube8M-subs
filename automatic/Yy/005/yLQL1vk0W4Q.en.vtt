00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
state and then they get a chance to

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.749 
state and then they get a chance to
better<00:01:56.810> make<00:01:57.290> them<00:01:57.410> mark<00:01:58.040> on<00:01:58.280> what<00:01:58.490> they<00:01:58.610> need

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
defense which is great at an early age a

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:10.810 
defense which is great at an early age a
lot<00:02:09.530> of<00:02:09.679> them<00:02:09.770> don't<00:02:09.920> get<00:02:10.130> it<00:02:10.250> so<00:02:10.369> early<00:02:10.550> but

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:10.820 
lot of them don't get it so early but

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.910 
lot of them don't get it so early but
they're<00:02:10.970> so<00:02:11.150> talented<00:02:11.690> that<00:02:11.900> they<00:02:12.350> bypass

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
they're so talented that they bypass

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.890 
they're so talented that they bypass
those<00:02:13.190> things<00:02:13.550> and<00:02:13.850> then<00:02:14.330> later<00:02:14.570> on<00:02:14.690> in<00:02:14.840> the

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
those things and then later on in the

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.330 
those things and then later on in the
day<00:02:15.050> we'll<00:02:15.230> be<00:02:15.260> coaching<00:02:15.800> it<00:02:15.920> and<00:02:16.070> playing

day we'll be coaching it and playing
some<00:02:16.610> games<00:02:16.820> and<00:02:17.000> make<00:02:17.090> it<00:02:17.180> a<00:02:17.209> little<00:02:17.300> bit<00:02:17.450> more

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
some games and make it a little bit more

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.390 
some games and make it a little bit more
competitive<00:02:18.170> and<00:02:18.560> try<00:02:18.739> to<00:02:18.800> take<00:02:19.040> the<00:02:19.100> things

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
competitive and try to take the things

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.920 
competitive and try to take the things
that<00:02:19.610> we<00:02:19.700> taught<00:02:19.940> early<00:02:20.360> and<00:02:20.570> put<00:02:20.690> them<00:02:20.810> into

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
that we taught early and put them into

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.290 
that we taught early and put them into
the<00:02:21.080> game<00:02:21.320> during<00:02:22.160> a<00:02:22.310> multi-day<00:02:22.820> session

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
the game during a multi-day session

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.760 
the game during a multi-day session
these<00:02:23.480> kids<00:02:23.780> learned<00:02:24.050> a<00:02:24.170> little<00:02:24.320> bit<00:02:24.560> more

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
these kids learned a little bit more

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.920 
these kids learned a little bit more
than<00:02:24.950> just<00:02:24.980> basketball<00:02:25.370> they<00:02:26.360> learned<00:02:26.630> life

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
than just basketball they learned life

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.860 
than just basketball they learned life
skills<00:02:27.320> as<00:02:27.590> well<00:02:27.830> I<00:02:28.160> think<00:02:28.820> that<00:02:29.060> education<00:02:29.269> is

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
skills as well I think that education is

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.960 
skills as well I think that education is
key<00:02:30.110> number<00:02:30.650> one<00:02:30.860> but<00:02:31.160> I<00:02:31.190> also<00:02:31.430> think<00:02:31.910> that

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
key number one but I also think that

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.330 
key number one but I also think that
it's<00:02:32.180> important<00:02:32.660> for<00:02:32.690> them<00:02:32.870> to<00:02:32.930> own<00:02:33.230> it<00:02:33.470> and<00:02:33.739> so

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
it's important for them to own it and so

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.949 
it's important for them to own it and so
one<00:02:34.519> of<00:02:34.610> the<00:02:34.700> things<00:02:34.910> that<00:02:35.060> I<00:02:35.150> asked<00:02:35.420> them<00:02:35.690> to

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
one of the things that I asked them to

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.560 
one of the things that I asked them to
begin<00:02:36.200> the<00:02:36.320> session<00:02:36.560> I<00:02:37.430> asked<00:02:38.239> them<00:02:38.330> how<00:02:38.510> many

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
begin the session I asked them how many

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.350 
begin the session I asked them how many
of<00:02:38.840> them<00:02:38.989> like<00:02:39.230> to<00:02:39.440> read<00:02:39.650> and<00:02:40.519> of<00:02:40.850> course<00:02:41.120> that

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
of them like to read and of course that

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.570 
of them like to read and of course that
related<00:02:41.840> to<00:02:42.049> the<00:02:42.260> first<00:02:42.470> question<00:02:43.040> how<00:02:43.519> many

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
related to the first question how many

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.970 
related to the first question how many
of<00:02:43.730> them<00:02:43.910> wanted<00:02:44.209> to<00:02:44.239> be<00:02:44.330> successful<00:02:44.739> well<00:02:45.739> we

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
of them wanted to be successful well we

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.940 
of them wanted to be successful well we
certainly<00:02:46.220> after<00:02:46.940> we<00:02:47.299> got<00:02:47.540> to<00:02:47.690> talking<00:02:47.959> had

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
certainly after we got to talking had

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.220 
certainly after we got to talking had
that<00:02:49.250> understanding<00:02:49.670> together<00:02:50.480> that<00:02:51.080> in

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
that understanding together that in

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.410 
that understanding together that in
order<00:02:51.530> for<00:02:51.590> them<00:02:51.980> to<00:02:52.010> have<00:02:52.430> greater<00:02:52.850> success

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
order for them to have greater success

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.020 
order for them to have greater success
that<00:02:54.290> they<00:02:54.440> do<00:02:54.500> have<00:02:54.860> to<00:02:54.920> be<00:02:55.130> able<00:02:55.250> to<00:02:55.519> read<00:02:55.730> and

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
that they do have to be able to read and

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.970 
that they do have to be able to read and
so<00:02:56.540> we<00:02:56.720> put<00:02:56.930> it<00:02:57.019> in<00:02:57.079> the<00:02:57.170> context<00:02:57.829> of<00:02:57.920> looking

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
so we put it in the context of looking

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.280 
so we put it in the context of looking
at<00:02:58.400> education<00:02:59.120> and<00:02:59.299> there<00:02:59.450> are<00:02:59.540> ninth<00:02:59.780> graders

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
at education and there are ninth graders

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.990 
at education and there are ninth graders
rising<00:03:01.280> ninth<00:03:01.489> graders<00:03:01.970> and<00:03:02.360> they<00:03:03.320> are<00:03:03.470> also

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
rising ninth graders and they are also

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.150 
rising ninth graders and they are also
going<00:03:05.000> to<00:03:05.150> be<00:03:05.450> taking<00:03:05.900> their<00:03:06.049> SATs<00:03:06.650> most<00:03:07.040> of

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
going to be taking their SATs most of

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.650 
going to be taking their SATs most of
them<00:03:07.280> raised<00:03:07.459> their<00:03:07.700> hands<00:03:07.970> wanting<00:03:08.390> to<00:03:08.480> go<00:03:08.600> to

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
them raised their hands wanting to go to

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.110 
them raised their hands wanting to go to
college<00:03:09.170> and<00:03:09.560> so<00:03:10.130> now<00:03:10.459> it's<00:03:10.700> the<00:03:10.730> time<00:03:10.790> to

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
college and so now it's the time to

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.850 
college and so now it's the time to
begin<00:03:11.269> to<00:03:11.420> prepare<00:03:11.630> for<00:03:11.989> that<00:03:12.140> and<00:03:12.530> really<00:03:12.739> we

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
begin to prepare for that and really we

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.560 
begin to prepare for that and really we
talk<00:03:13.010> about<00:03:13.130> seventh<00:03:13.640> graders<00:03:13.970> beginning<00:03:14.390> to

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570
