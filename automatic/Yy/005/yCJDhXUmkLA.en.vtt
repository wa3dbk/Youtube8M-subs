00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.080
 first I covered with the 2b just touching 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.959
 the paper took the pencil in this way 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.639
 to avoid putting too much pressure 

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:17.220
 Then I blew it with a brush 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.990
 flat tip if you do not have a brush 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.760
 They can use paper or cotton to 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.140
 blur but do it in the same 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.310
 hair direction as if you 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.310
 they were caressing 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.000
 Y 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.820
 ah 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.330
 with the eraser very erasing in the form of 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.690
 hair and I'm erasing the parts where 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:46.730
 it looks more white where you see more light 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.559
 for this type of hair is very 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.219
 important to avoid making very streaks 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:51.219
 checked 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:58.490
 all the time I take on the track like this for 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.440
 make it soft everything you do 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:03.290
 I'm going to blur the pencils 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.510
 with the brush everything if the hair is more 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:08.950
 white you can make it softer or you can 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.950
 replace pencils 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.200
 to make hair or shadows 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.540
 that are not so dark I use the 2b and 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:20.130
 for the darkest I use the 4 ve 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.130
 always making it soft 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.570
 practically in each section of 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.110
 hair I'm doing the same 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.110
 Y 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.360
 yes 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.530
 yes 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.470
 i 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.330
 Y 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 Y 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 Y 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:21.639
 and that's all, guys, I hope that 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.639
 it is useful for you bye
