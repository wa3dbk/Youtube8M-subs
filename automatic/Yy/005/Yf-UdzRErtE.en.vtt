00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:20.180 
shockwave was kind of known for being a

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.170 
shockwave was kind of known for being a

inch impact driver right yeah yeah

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.220 
inch impact driver right yeah yeah
exactly<00:00:25.580> I<00:00:25.910> mean<00:00:25.939> impacts<00:00:26.510> are<00:00:26.720> so<00:00:26.930> they're

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.230 
exactly I mean impacts are so they're

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:28.450 
exactly I mean impacts are so they're
getting<00:00:27.349> a<00:00:27.500> last<00:00:27.650> stronger<00:00:28.039> nowadays<00:00:28.340> than

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460 
getting a last stronger nowadays than

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:29.859 
getting a last stronger nowadays than
there<00:00:28.580> were<00:00:28.670> even<00:00:28.849> three<00:00:29.060> four<00:00:29.269> years<00:00:29.449> ago<00:00:29.689> so

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:29.869 
there were even three four years ago so

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:31.330 
there were even three four years ago so
you<00:00:29.900> got<00:00:30.109> to<00:00:30.199> have<00:00:30.289> the<00:00:30.380> bit<00:00:30.650> to<00:00:30.679> actually<00:00:30.980> be

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.340 
you got to have the bit to actually be

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.400 
you got to have the bit to actually be
able<00:00:31.519> to<00:00:31.580> keep<00:00:31.730> up<00:00:31.910> with<00:00:31.970> the<00:00:32.210> impact<00:00:32.599> of<00:00:32.840> it

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.410 
able to keep up with the impact of it

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.939 
able to keep up with the impact of it
and<00:00:33.590> that's<00:00:33.680> what<00:00:33.920> these<00:00:34.670> beds<00:00:34.940> do<00:00:35.150> wow<00:00:35.949> that's

own kind of flare to their accessories I

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:50.200 
own kind of flare to their accessories I
know<00:00:48.470> makita's<00:00:49.129> got<00:00:49.309> the<00:00:49.400> gold<00:00:49.699> accessories

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
know makita's got the gold accessories

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.960 
know makita's got the gold accessories
yeah<00:00:50.869> you<00:00:51.470> know<00:00:51.589> these<00:00:51.949> ones<00:00:52.190> have<00:00:52.400> the<00:00:52.519> I

yeah you know these ones have the I

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.270 
yeah you know these ones have the I
always<00:00:53.570> want<00:00:53.780> to<00:00:53.809> say<00:00:53.930> torsion<00:00:54.470> but<00:00:54.650> whatever

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
always want to say torsion but whatever

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.660 
always want to say torsion but whatever
that<00:00:55.460> let<00:00:56.210> me<00:00:56.390> see<00:00:56.600> world's<00:00:57.110> first<00:00:57.369> shocks<00:00:58.369> own

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
that let me see world's first shocks own

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.180 
that let me see world's first shocks own
geometry<00:00:59.290> that's<00:01:00.290> what<00:01:00.500> it<00:01:00.589> is<00:01:00.680> the<00:01:00.890> shocks

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
geometry that's what it is the shocks

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:02.829 
geometry that's what it is the shocks
dome<00:01:01.430> geometry<00:01:02.000> so<00:01:02.330> that's<00:01:02.479> going<00:01:02.600> to<00:01:02.659> take

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:02.839 
dome geometry so that's going to take

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:05.679 
dome geometry so that's going to take
all<00:01:02.930> the<00:01:03.080> impact<00:01:03.500> kind<00:01:04.220> of<00:01:04.369> so<00:01:05.150> the<00:01:05.239> tools<00:01:05.479> not

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:05.689 
all the impact kind of so the tools not

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:07.390 
all the impact kind of so the tools not
going<00:01:05.869> to<00:01:05.930> break<00:01:06.110> on<00:01:06.320> you<00:01:06.470> the<00:01:06.799> 30<00:01:07.100> degree

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
going to break on you the 30 degree

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.770 
going to break on you the 30 degree
knuckle<00:01:07.760> we<00:01:07.850> actually<00:01:08.119> saw<00:01:08.330> at<00:01:08.479> one<00:01:08.600> of<00:01:08.720> the

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
knuckle we actually saw at one of the

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.210 
knuckle we actually saw at one of the
eventing<00:01:09.230> that<00:01:09.350> you<00:01:09.500> long<00:01:09.620> back<00:01:09.800> it's<00:01:10.130> gonna

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
eventing that you long back it's gonna

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:11.920 
eventing that you long back it's gonna
allow<00:01:10.370> you<00:01:10.520> to<00:01:10.670> get<00:01:10.760> the<00:01:10.910> kind<00:01:11.150> of<00:01:11.240> tight<00:01:11.420> areas

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
allow you to get the kind of tight areas

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.710 
allow you to get the kind of tight areas
and<00:01:12.200> all<00:01:12.290> that<00:01:12.530> with<00:01:12.920> an<00:01:13.070> impact<00:01:13.460> and<00:01:14.330> this

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
and all that with an impact and this

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.300 
and all that with an impact and this
stuff<00:01:14.900> is<00:01:15.050> heavy<00:01:15.290> duty<00:01:15.590> and<00:01:15.680> I<00:01:15.770> know<00:01:15.830> Eric<00:01:16.190> you

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
stuff is heavy duty and I know Eric you

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
stuff is heavy duty and I know Eric you
said<00:01:16.370> we're<00:01:16.640> saying<00:01:16.790> something<00:01:16.940> about<00:01:17.240> the

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
said we're saying something about the

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.150 
said we're saying something about the
magnetic<00:01:17.660> bit<00:01:18.020> holder<00:01:18.050> well<00:01:18.500> I<00:01:18.530> love<00:01:18.830> it<00:01:19.010> it's

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:19.160 
magnetic bit holder well I love it it's

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.800 
magnetic bit holder well I love it it's
strong<00:01:19.490> it's<00:01:19.910> you<00:01:20.210> know<00:01:20.300> it's<00:01:20.510> something<00:01:20.690> you

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
strong it's you know it's something you

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.570 
strong it's you know it's something you
can<00:01:20.990> just<00:01:21.170> dip<00:01:21.320> the<00:01:21.530> dip<00:01:21.890> it<00:01:22.040> down<00:01:22.190> and<00:01:22.460> get<00:01:22.550> a

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
can just dip the dip it down and get a

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.270 
can just dip the dip it down and get a
bucket<00:01:22.820> screws<00:01:23.180> or<00:01:23.330> screw<00:01:23.630> backs<00:01:24.010> so<00:01:25.010> what<00:01:25.250> I

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
bucket screws or screw backs so what I

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.000 
bucket screws or screw backs so what I
mean<00:01:25.430> if<00:01:26.270> the<00:01:26.780> magnet<00:01:27.170> the<00:01:27.380> magnet<00:01:27.740> on<00:01:27.860> this

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.010 
mean if the magnet the magnet on this

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:29.290 
mean if the magnet the magnet on this
I've<00:01:28.130> used<00:01:28.340> one<00:01:28.460> is<00:01:28.610> where<00:01:28.730> the<00:01:28.820> magnets<00:01:29.180> are

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:29.300 
I've used one is where the magnets are

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.030 
I've used one is where the magnets are
really<00:01:29.540> weak<00:01:29.750> but<00:01:30.170> that<00:01:30.410> picks<00:01:30.620> up<00:01:30.710> a<00:01:30.800> bunch<00:01:30.950> of

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
really weak but that picks up a bunch of

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.530 
really weak but that picks up a bunch of
screws<00:01:31.250> when<00:01:31.430> it<00:01:31.520> comes<00:01:31.700> out<00:01:31.880> well<00:01:32.270> yeah<00:01:32.360> it's

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
screws when it comes out well yeah it's

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.630 
screws when it comes out well yeah it's
a<00:01:32.600> strong<00:01:32.840> magnet<00:01:33.290> Wow<00:01:33.950> it's<00:01:34.159> great<00:01:34.340> I<00:01:34.370> like

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
a strong magnet Wow it's great I like

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.300 
a strong magnet Wow it's great I like
that<00:01:34.850> so<00:01:35.240> if<00:01:35.390> they<00:01:35.510> have<00:01:35.720> insert<00:01:36.409> magnetic<00:01:37.130> nut

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
that so if they have insert magnetic nut

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.130 
that so if they have insert magnetic nut
