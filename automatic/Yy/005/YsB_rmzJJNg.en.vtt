00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.580 
it was that other move it sounds kind of
ridiculous<00:02:24.000> and<00:02:24.180> maybe<00:02:24.480> it<00:02:24.570> is<00:02:24.690> but<00:02:25.170> it<00:02:25.380> did

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
ridiculous and maybe it is but it did

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.940 
ridiculous and maybe it is but it did
start<00:02:25.890> working<00:02:26.310> so<00:02:26.670> I<00:02:26.700> don't<00:02:26.910> know<00:02:27.000> why<00:02:27.800> if<00:02:28.800> it

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
start working so I don't know why if it

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.910 
start working so I don't know why if it
was<00:02:29.100> software<00:02:29.610> or<00:02:29.970> if<00:02:30.360> it<00:02:30.450> was<00:02:30.540> hardware<00:02:33.920> I

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
was software or if it was hardware I

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.250 
was software or if it was hardware I
don't<00:02:35.310> remember<00:02:35.640> it<00:02:36.600> off<00:02:36.750> a<00:02:36.780> couple<00:02:37.110> times

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
don't remember it off a couple times

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.410 
don't remember it off a couple times
because<00:02:37.920> I<00:02:37.950> had<00:02:38.190> out<00:02:38.460> of<00:02:38.490> necessity<00:02:38.970> because

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
because I had out of necessity because

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.080 
because I had out of necessity because
that's<00:02:39.720> the<00:02:39.810> only<00:02:39.930> way<00:02:40.260> that<00:02:40.620> I<00:02:41.550> could<00:02:41.820> get<00:02:41.940> it

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
that's the only way that I could get it

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.150 
that's the only way that I could get it
to<00:02:42.300> go<00:02:43.110> into<00:02:43.350> an<00:02:43.470> app<00:02:43.620> or<00:02:44.060> use<00:02:45.060> the<00:02:45.330> darn<00:02:45.510> thing

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
to go into an app or use the darn thing

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.560 
to go into an app or use the darn thing
so<00:02:47.160> I<00:02:47.220> don't<00:02:47.370> know<00:02:47.460> if<00:02:47.550> powering<00:02:48.030> it<00:02:48.150> off<00:02:48.330> had

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
so I don't know if powering it off had

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.310 
so I don't know if powering it off had
something<00:02:49.050> to<00:02:49.200> do<00:02:49.350> with<00:02:49.500> healing<00:02:49.860> it<00:02:50.300> I<00:02:51.320> don't

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
something to do with healing it I don't

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:57.680 
something to do with healing it I don't
know<00:02:52.410> if<00:02:52.530> I<00:02:52.940> ever<00:02:55.040> result<00:02:56.300> resync<00:02:57.300> it<00:02:57.450> to

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
know if I ever result resync it to

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.360 
know if I ever result resync it to
iTunes<00:02:58.350> if<00:02:59.720> something<00:03:00.720> like<00:03:00.870> that<00:03:01.140> healed<00:03:02.070> it

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
iTunes if something like that healed it

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.900 
iTunes if something like that healed it
so<00:03:03.020> anyway<00:03:04.020> that's<00:03:04.110> my<00:03:04.320> two<00:03:04.380> cents<00:03:04.860> all<00:03:05.640> I<00:03:05.700> can

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
so anyway that's my two cents all I can

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.870 
so anyway that's my two cents all I can
say<00:03:06.120> is<00:03:06.350> it<00:03:07.350> definitely<00:03:07.770> stopped<00:03:08.070> working<00:03:08.580> for

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
say is it definitely stopped working for

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.480 
say is it definitely stopped working for
me<00:03:09.030> for<00:03:09.060> a<00:03:09.330> couple<00:03:09.660> days<00:03:10.070> seemed<00:03:11.070> like<00:03:11.250> it<00:03:11.400> was

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.490 
me for a couple days seemed like it was

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.350 
me for a couple days seemed like it was
right<00:03:11.520> after<00:03:11.850> the<00:03:12.120> four<00:03:12.270> point<00:03:12.510> three<00:03:12.570> and

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
right after the four point three and

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.690 
right after the four point three and
then<00:03:15.360> it<00:03:15.390> started<00:03:15.840> working<00:03:16.230> so<00:03:16.709> you<00:03:17.250> can<00:03:17.430> try

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
then it started working so you can try

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:23.660 
then it started working so you can try
it<00:03:17.760> I<00:03:18.680> hope<00:03:19.680> I<00:03:20.190> hope<00:03:20.670> that<00:03:22.220> maybe<00:03:23.220> you<00:03:23.400> have<00:03:23.550> the

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
it I hope I hope that maybe you have the

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.940 
it I hope I hope that maybe you have the
same<00:03:23.880> luck<00:03:24.090> I<00:03:24.239> did<00:03:24.420> maybe<00:03:24.720> these<00:03:25.380> mooks<00:03:25.680> have

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
same luck I did maybe these mooks have

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.410 
same luck I did maybe these mooks have
something<00:03:26.340> to<00:03:26.430> do<00:03:26.550> with<00:03:26.670> it<00:03:26.850> maybe<00:03:27.060> they<00:03:27.209> don't

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
something to do with it maybe they don't

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.020 
something to do with it maybe they don't
but<00:03:27.810> I<00:03:28.050> don't<00:03:29.040> know<00:03:29.100> how<00:03:29.250> it<00:03:29.370> started<00:03:29.670> working

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
but I don't know how it started working

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.680 
but I don't know how it started working
again<00:03:30.269> but<00:03:30.300> I'm<00:03:30.600> glad<00:03:30.810> it<00:03:30.959> did<00:03:31.170> so<00:03:31.890> anyway

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690
