 if not diagnosed early lead to lead to death 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.110
 it is an extremely courageous disease 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.230
 in another way this is the right way to speak 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.860
 that such cases of dengue regions such as the forehead nose 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:22.890
 local port 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.650
 when more exposed they can be reversed south of smaller magnitude and

 We're going to win the election, they're usually right, you're saying. 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:32.970
 which is correct 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.810
 they usually did not cause me cups that reach to migrate other liza

 the rapporteur malignancy of them usually to the place 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.350
 and with early diagnosis you can treat without scarring either 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.150
 there are cases that we attend that really are amazing 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.579
 the person leaves leaves and then the destruction 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:56.299
 already in names already deepened it goes destroying 

00:00:56.299 --> 00:01:01.259
 part of it would be difficult because you will treat it but you will have it 

00:01:01.259 --> 00:01:02.870
 a deformity in the

 now its specialist in medical law and president of the association of

 which progressed more significant since internal medicine the subject of the surgery 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.460
 dermatological 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.950

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.950
 twenty years scoreboard it comes growing very fast cast 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.830
 the dermatology encounter in the laws a way to expand very ne ne pole 

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:31.710
 old fashioned shopkeeper 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.350
 he did very few interventions he at most took a pint chile 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.700
 he would have come to reread what I like to laser with today you 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.260
 can handle for example if in the game but 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:44.469
 you have that 

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:48.820
 that she neal benign formation you can treat blood 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.310
 you can treat was in this general area with 1 with the neck as if it were 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.009
 proliferation of various adversaries will be the Spanish assembled 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:58.840
 this of blood vessels 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.460
 you can deal with laws and you can treat tattoo make removal of 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.660
 tattoos and can make rejuvenation in women for example mild 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:08.649
 have access 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:14.320
 we have the same ones who want to get rid of hair is the nazak if they 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:19.920
 he told you and you can also treat rejuvenate g1 walked from 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.940
 maiduguru victor mercep very safe laws evolved a lot today we have 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.479
 pro-regime in that 

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:28.010
 the fractionated laser apparatus 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.750
 and that you have a much greater security you have the doctor has as 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.010
 control what he is doing the doctor really knew the technique 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.410
 well trained he is able to offer his patient 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.279
 really amazing results now you have to remember 

00:02:44.279 --> 00:02:47.459
 what laws and abin our legislation does not have 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:48.579
 and some 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:51.579
 one she still noticed is not very clear 

00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:53.849
 who can use laws 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:58.320
 in my opinion I do not know what the specialist may or may not be 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:03.460
 cluttered doctor I think any doctor the doctor not only to chaos the law 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.790
 tell 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.020
 you know it 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.780
 is with the doctor from the moment he has the diploma he can exercise 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.369
 any 

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:15.449
 any procedure of medicine as long as he judges but I do not open 

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:18.840
 to disclose this now is not prudent 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.680
 a person has nothing to go with are laws and people often by 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.070
 economic reasons 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.369
 What is surprising of the people 

00:03:27.369 --> 00:03:32.369
 people seek to deliver their opposite promo to non-medical use 

00:03:32.369 --> 00:03:36.339
 a laser I think this up measures this occurs with many hands ran to the court 

00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:37.350
 whereas legislation 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.780
 does not prohibit does not regulate this correctly but in the view is 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.440
 in charge of employment but I give it is something that is not yet 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.890
 and energy companies like any other business 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.900
 teresina losses in selling that we see in reality is if they are on paper 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:53.769
 their 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:56.879
 now that there should be a recovery 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:01.159
 calibration and a regulation says that laws and in my 

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:05.199
 opinion for medical use could only be used by a physician 

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:10.599
 no doctor should not use laws is just my opinion and I say this 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:13.650
 with president Brazilian society of laser in medicine 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.489
 and surgery in the Midwest 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:20.789
 every other day I participate in a leisure center with three other colleagues 

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:24.650
 dermatologist we are pioneers in this area here in brasilia 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.830
 we have a really complete leisure center because it's something else that 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:32.180
 people do not know you have to remember that a law 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:33.760
 every law is served 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.290
 to purpose thing is purpose is not kind of care of 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:41.280
 when they arrive at the doctor's office for the purpose of 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:41.940
 they entered 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:42.800
 treatment 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.280
 and what questions and should make you realize your middle star the dictatorship 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:51.110
 he has to look for know when he for example found a cure and training 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:52.979
 and when he came to a doctor 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:55.420
 an example to remove a tattoo 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:59.950
 it is very important that he knows what laws will be used in that 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.210
 procedure that there is a specific milk 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.900
 It is not with any laws and that you take tattoo 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:08.700
 For you tattoo strips have to use a laser that is what we are of that 

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:11.610
 only with hot and dry oil and means 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.240
 his pulse is very fast so you warm up the pd - 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.409
 of tattoo 

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:19.740
 without causing damage to the skin around understand the point has to be a law 

00:05:19.739 --> 00:05:20.460
 specific 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.650
 you can not take any leisure 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:24.620
 to get the feel of agepen are you gonna 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:26.010
 in the place of the tattoo 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:30.280
 leaves a tremendous scar now I wanted to ask the question that the course 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.839
 about important because it's the third time I speak in tattoo 

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:38.529
 itatiba we know that in any way gratitude to the body aggression to 

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:42.329
 skin is what evidently no one will get here and nobody else spoke 

00:05:42.329 --> 00:05:46.459
 makes tattoo almost impossible but what kind of care since the person goes 

00:05:46.459 --> 00:05:50.669
 for vanity to make an intervention in his own typical profile should be 

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:54.939
 done or when you should not undergo a tattoo during the tattoo 

00:05:54.939 --> 00:05:55.620
 She have to 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:59.589
 be careful if she decided to do this is clear to her 

00:05:59.589 --> 00:06:04.050
 look for a place where hygiene is adequate by hand do not 

00:06:04.049 --> 00:06:08.359
 club infection should win and I go and this is an opinion and 

00:06:08.359 --> 00:06:10.300
 exactly that she had an infection 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:13.300
 now I as a dermatologist 

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:17.949
 the errata tuajegue until my presence is to remove the tattoo 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:22.270
 is that the person made the repentant and repentant tattoo and she wants 

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:26.750
 eighth to enter the job market, she thinks that this is not the case. 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.860
 I do not exactly fit Talat comes to take 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:35.849
 and have to make it clear that even with laws and heavy word leisure was a partner of 

00:06:35.849 --> 00:06:38.000
 modernity looks magical 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.749
 and it's not magic she has to find a doctor who knows 

00:06:41.749 --> 00:06:44.070
 the technique and mainly 

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:45.419
 be clear 

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:46.930
 it will not be easy 

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:49.930
 who to withdraw that much action already of demand herd 

00:06:50.469 --> 00:06:52.539
 bye bye 

00:06:52.539 --> 00:06:55.139
 and that it is no magic and not always 

00:06:55.139 --> 00:06:58.909
 you can remove the tattoo with these aesthetic results 

00:06:58.909 --> 00:07:00.469
 so good so then 

00:07:00.469 --> 00:07:02.860
 Before I got a tattoo I used to be a doctor. 

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:07.489
 my orientation is to say think well if you want to live with it 

00:07:08.289 --> 00:07:10.889
 why tattoo one thing forever 

00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:14.659
