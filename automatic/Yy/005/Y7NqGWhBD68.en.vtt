anything<00:00:21.230> just<00:00:22.230> from<00:00:22.410> wall<00:00:22.680> to<00:00:23.660> obsidian

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
anything just from wall to obsidian

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.009 
anything just from wall to obsidian
would<00:00:25.699> just<00:00:26.699> anything<00:00:27.060> that's<00:00:27.689> all<00:00:27.869> the

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
would just anything that's all the

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.189 
would just anything that's all the
choices<00:00:28.260> you<00:00:28.500> can<00:00:28.590> have<00:00:28.859> and<00:00:29.099> are<00:00:30.090> high<00:00:30.510> really

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
choices you can have and are high really

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.749 
choices you can have and are high really
surprised<00:00:31.650> that<00:00:31.679> someone<00:00:32.160> actually<00:00:32.309> done

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
surprised that someone actually done

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.190 
surprised that someone actually done
this<00:00:32.910> because<00:00:33.120> not<00:00:33.510> many<00:00:33.600> people<00:00:33.930> would<00:00:34.020> do

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
this because not many people would do

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.049 
this because not many people would do
this<00:00:34.350> I'm<00:00:35.219> just<00:00:35.370> going<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.579> move<00:00:35.700> on<00:00:35.910> might

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
this I'm just going to move on might

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.490 
this I'm just going to move on might
because<00:00:36.390> it's<00:00:36.540> kind<00:00:36.719> of<00:00:36.750> interface<00:00:37.110> bit<00:00:37.350> and

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
because it's kind of interface bit and

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.619 
because it's kind of interface bit and
stairs<00:00:37.950> as<00:00:38.160> well<00:00:38.340> it's<00:00:38.610> been<00:00:38.790> made<00:00:39.360> out<00:00:39.390> of

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
stairs as well it's been made out of

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.250 
stairs as well it's been made out of
wall<00:00:41.239> anything<00:00:42.239> you<00:00:42.690> could<00:00:42.870> possibly<00:00:42.899> think

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
wall anything you could possibly think

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.209 
wall anything you could possibly think
of<00:00:43.590> that<00:00:43.829> will<00:00:44.280> make<00:00:44.520> it<00:00:44.789> it<00:00:45.239> will<00:00:45.420> do<00:00:46.219> mostly

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
of that will make it it will do mostly

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.029 
of that will make it it will do mostly
anyway<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:48.000> not<00:00:48.149> all<00:00:48.180> of<00:00:48.360> it<00:00:48.660> don't<00:00:49.530> think<00:00:49.860> so

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
anyway and not all of it don't think so

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.560 
anyway and not all of it don't think so
but<00:00:50.219> I<00:00:50.250> think<00:00:50.460> most<00:00:50.700> of<00:00:50.850> its<00:00:51.000> in<00:00:51.149> there<00:00:51.360> and

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
but I think most of its in there and

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.420 
but I think most of its in there and
it's<00:00:52.140> kind<00:00:52.410> of<00:00:52.530> good<00:00:52.770> if<00:00:52.949> you're<00:00:53.100> trying<00:00:53.309> to

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
it's kind of good if you're trying to

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.189 
it's kind of good if you're trying to
build<00:00:53.969> stuff<00:00:54.270> as<00:00:54.449> well<00:00:54.629> because<00:00:54.840> you<00:00:54.930> can<00:00:55.050> have

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
build stuff as well because you can have

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.290 
build stuff as well because you can have
more<00:00:55.410> colors<00:00:55.710> onto<00:00:56.070> it<00:00:56.309> make<00:00:56.520> it<00:00:56.640> more<00:00:56.760> stylish

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
more colors onto it make it more stylish

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.770 
more colors onto it make it more stylish
or<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.570> sector<00:00:58.199> etc<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:58.800> this<00:00:59.670> as<00:00:59.879> well<00:01:00.059> you<00:01:00.600> can

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
or a sector etc and this as well you can

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.500 
or a sector etc and this as well you can
actually<00:01:01.050> make<00:01:01.199> doors<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.949> traps<00:01:02.670> out<00:01:03.090> of<00:01:03.390> it

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
actually make doors and traps out of it

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.810 
actually make doors and traps out of it
and<00:01:03.719> these<00:01:04.589> are<00:01:04.650> all<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.010> selections<00:01:05.519> you

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
and these are all the selections you

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.520 
and these are all the selections you
care<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.210> you<00:01:06.270> can<00:01:06.570> use<00:01:06.750> them<00:01:06.930> like<00:01:07.200> that<00:01:07.439> as

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
care and you can use them like that as

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.859 
care and you can use them like that as
well<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:07.860> use<00:01:08.070> them<00:01:08.250> so<00:01:08.760> just<00:01:09.240> trap<00:01:09.420> doors<00:01:09.630> with

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
well to use them so just trap doors with

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.770 
well to use them so just trap doors with
which<00:01:10.470> you<00:01:10.860> know<00:01:10.979> just<00:01:11.250> different<00:01:12.000> skins<00:01:12.510> net

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
which you know just different skins net

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:13.789 
which you know just different skins net
which<00:01:12.930> will<00:01:13.140> make<00:01:13.229> it<00:01:13.409> even<00:01:13.470> more<00:01:13.590> helpful

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
which will make it even more helpful

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.080 
which will make it even more helpful
because<00:01:14.100> you<00:01:14.280> can<00:01:14.430> blend<00:01:14.580> that<00:01:14.760> into<00:01:14.909> the

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
because you can blend that into the

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.660 
because you can blend that into the
floor<00:01:15.330> really<00:01:15.630> easily<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.369> just<00:01:17.369> stuff<00:01:17.549> up

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
floor really easily and just stuff up

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.560 
floor really easily and just stuff up
there<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.240> same<00:01:18.450> offenses<00:01:19.080> it's<00:01:19.350> kind<00:01:20.340> of

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
there and the same offenses it's kind of

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.690 
there and the same offenses it's kind of
its<00:01:21.570> like<00:01:21.659> that<00:01:22.020> you<00:01:22.500> get<00:01:22.710> an<00:01:22.830> extra<00:01:22.920> bit<00:01:23.460> there

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
its like that you get an extra bit there

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.649 
its like that you get an extra bit there
because<00:01:23.909> you're<00:01:23.970> going<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.270> put<00:01:24.390> normal

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
because you're going to put normal

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.719 
because you're going to put normal
fences<00:01:25.049> in<00:01:25.080> then<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:25.439> can<00:01:25.560> do<00:01:25.650> that<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:26.070> it

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
fences in then you can do that and it

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.280 
fences in then you can do that and it
will<00:01:26.790> kind<00:01:26.970> of<00:01:27.119> open<00:01:27.479> up<00:01:27.570> so<00:01:27.780> you<00:01:27.900> don't<00:01:27.930> have

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
will kind of open up so you don't have

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.870 
will kind of open up so you don't have
to<00:01:28.470> put<00:01:28.650> a<00:01:28.680> door<00:01:28.979> there<00:01:29.220> or<00:01:29.340> anything<00:01:29.549> or<00:01:29.820> a

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
to put a door there or anything or a

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.050 
to put a door there or anything or a
trap<00:01:30.150> door<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:31.250> so<00:01:32.250> that<00:01:32.549> would<00:01:32.729> help<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:33.030> lot

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
trap door and so that would help a lot

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.880 
trap door and so that would help a lot
if<00:01:33.420> you're<00:01:33.659> just<00:01:33.810> trying<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.140> trap<00:01:34.320> things<00:01:34.619> you
