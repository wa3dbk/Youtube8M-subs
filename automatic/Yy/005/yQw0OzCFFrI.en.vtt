00:00:00.639 --> 00:00:04.819
 hello to all the radio atoms friends today we will go but review screws each 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.639
 utility that serves to test 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.639
 the protection of your network can do 

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:15.169
 available on appstore app for the price of 59 euros 

00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:20.469
 and it's like in the room so it works very well on both paypal and ita 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.210
 once the application has started 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.170
 this is its interface 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:29.920
 we have two options i robot ss id 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.640
 going to click 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.040
 on choose heroic 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.060
 for other 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.700
 we'll have 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.020
 all here a list 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.340
 to choose from 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.170
 for example alice 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.170
 and then obviously here where to send to insert the present code 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:52.890
 next to 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.460
 to the wi-fi network 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.360
 in this case me 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.360
 dad I found but not having one anyway 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:02.680
 not having alice but 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:03.620
 having 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.630
 password 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.830
 a modem in its own right I had to search the Internet for a code 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.450
 random 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.340
 that we will go now 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.340
 to insert 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.040
 then 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.040
 the code was 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.580
 card e 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.600
 15 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.150
 48 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.190
 25 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.350
 once entered 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.049
 all the 8 digits delice will suffice pattaya fine 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.960
 come on head 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.080
 and as you can see, I have the key 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.640
 precisely to test safety 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.700
 ours 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.860
 in our network you want to do 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.620
 once found 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.940
 the password 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.600
 we will have the possibility to export the e-mail pos white hours 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.949
 or just click 

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:13.949
 to the clipboard with saving it in the archive 

00:02:14.719 --> 00:02:16.379
 to then go to. 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:19.169
 to test it 

00:02:19.169 --> 00:02:22.489
 here instead we have 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:24.559
 na disclaimer by 

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:27.129
 of the developer ca. he says that 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:31.349
 m author cannot be held responsible for any stamps 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:34.619
 violations deriving from the own or own use of the application 

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:36.619
 so obviously this 

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:39.679
 this application only serves 

00:02:39.679 --> 00:02:40.929
 to test 

00:02:40.929 --> 00:02:44.429
 I repeat to see hi-fi TV denon for probar le 

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:46.419
 for 

00:02:46.419 --> 00:02:49.069
 as you well know 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:51.279
 it goes into the legal 

00:02:51.279 --> 00:02:54.289
 below is the developer's e-mail contact 

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:58.519
 and then let's go see 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:01.049
 in the archive we have. 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:06.619
 the password just saved here will be enough once 

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:09.619
 give only one step on the password for 

00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:13.849
 copy it directly to the clipboard and then go. 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:16.849
 I'll show you 

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:23.439
 for example in the night 

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:26.199
 massera do paste and as you can see 

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:29.199
 the password is directly copied 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:36.229
 so I repeat this is a great application really works the way 

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:37.449
 Dear 

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:38.550
 to test 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:42.080
 just luck to the security of your wi-fi network 

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:46.309
 I never did text in my house 

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:51.279
 and obviously this application calculates the key vp a 

00:03:51.869 --> 00:03:54.709
 if you want once installed 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:58.769
 a salad your bed room immediately the step by putting 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:02.009
 also that I know 1 2 3 4 ciaoo 

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:03.800
 obviously no one then 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.899
 can try to 

00:04:05.899 --> 00:04:09.749
 to enter since in any case the password for well know one 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:13.389
 it's just that 

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:16.389
 perfect no bread arrive notifications 

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:21.039
 I said everything 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:23.290
 yes I said everything 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.990
 I repeat, very good application, very little price, then one euro 50 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.990
 then I seem above all or universal act 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.279
 really really recommended 

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:36.279
 here I wanted to add something 

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:39.669
 going to choose 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:40.969
 router 

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:44.209
 just go to support to see 

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:49.169
 the ssd supported therefore here only shows values 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.680
 initials 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.699
 finely seed for example 

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:56.830
 we will have a network 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:00.129
 part of the first digits the first three digits a 

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:03.450
 7 5 8 cordially here does not appear therefore 

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:06.540
 at this time that network cannot be tested 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:11.300
 perfect 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.570
 the review ends here I greet you all bye
