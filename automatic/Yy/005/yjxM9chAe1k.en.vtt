you<00:02:29.220> look<00:02:29.370> closely<00:02:29.700> and<00:02:30.120> you<00:02:30.360> know<00:02:30.480> exactly

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
you look closely and you know exactly

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.540 
you look closely and you know exactly
what<00:02:31.020> you're<00:02:31.140> looking<00:02:31.380> for<00:02:31.710> you<00:02:32.400> can

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
what you're looking for you can

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:33.710 
what you're looking for you can
sometimes<00:02:33.000> tell<00:02:33.210> where<00:02:33.390> there<00:02:33.480> are<00:02:33.540> cars

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720

okay<00:02:45.420> if<00:02:45.660> we<00:02:45.990> take<00:02:46.140> a<00:02:46.200> look<00:02:46.410> up<00:02:46.590> at<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:46.830> chassis

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
okay if we take a look up at the chassis

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.990 
okay if we take a look up at the chassis
leg<00:02:47.400> here

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
leg here

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.870 
leg here
we<00:02:48.390> can<00:02:48.600> see<00:02:48.870> around<00:02:49.560> there<00:02:50.160> that<00:02:50.400> there's

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
we can see around there that there's

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.150 
we can see around there that there's
actually<00:02:51.210> a<00:02:51.240> well<00:02:51.510> that<00:02:51.780> we<00:02:51.900> can<00:02:52.080> see<00:02:52.350> that<00:02:52.710> the

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
actually a well that we can see that the

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.310 
actually a well that we can see that the
front<00:02:53.400> chassis<00:02:53.880> leg<00:02:54.030> has<00:02:54.180> been<00:02:54.360> changed<00:02:54.870> also

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
front chassis leg has been changed also

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.170 
front chassis leg has been changed also
the<00:02:55.740> main<00:02:55.950> concern<00:02:56.340> I<00:02:56.370> have<00:02:56.610> here<00:02:56.910> is<00:02:57.060> that

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
the main concern I have here is that

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.820 
the main concern I have here is that
looking<00:02:57.480> at<00:02:57.630> the<00:02:57.750> side<00:02:57.960> of<00:02:57.990> the<00:02:58.170> chassis<00:02:58.350> there

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
looking at the side of the chassis there

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.730 
looking at the side of the chassis there
it<00:02:59.310> looks<00:02:59.640> as<00:02:59.790> though<00:02:59.820> it's<00:03:00.360> been<00:03:00.780> repaired

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
it looks as though it's been repaired

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.350 
it looks as though it's been repaired
with<00:03:01.980> filler<00:03:02.250> which<00:03:02.610> is<00:03:02.760> obviously<00:03:03.090> not<00:03:03.330> a

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
with filler which is obviously not a

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.330 
with filler which is obviously not a
structural<00:03:03.870> repair<00:03:04.080> and<00:03:04.530> not<00:03:04.620> acceptable

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
structural repair and not acceptable

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.890 
structural repair and not acceptable
what<00:03:05.580> sort<00:03:05.850> of<00:03:05.880> accident<00:03:06.390> is<00:03:06.480> it<00:03:06.600> previously

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
what sort of accident is it previously

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.660 
what sort of accident is it previously
been<00:03:07.230> involved<00:03:07.470> oh<00:03:07.920> the<00:03:08.280> vehicle<00:03:08.580> has

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
been involved oh the vehicle has

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.220 
been involved oh the vehicle has
obviously<00:03:08.970> been<00:03:09.180> in<00:03:09.330> a<00:03:09.360> full-frontal

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
obviously been in a full-frontal

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.110 
obviously been in a full-frontal
accident<00:03:10.890> which<00:03:11.010> is<00:03:11.160> damaged<00:03:11.520> both<00:03:11.760> major

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
accident which is damaged both major

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.390 
accident which is damaged both major
chassis<00:03:12.600> legs<00:03:12.780> so<00:03:13.230> it's<00:03:13.380> crumpled<00:03:13.830> the

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
chassis legs so it's crumpled the

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.670 
chassis legs so it's crumpled the
crumple<00:03:14.820> zones<00:03:15.060> yes<00:03:15.690> and<00:03:16.140> they've<00:03:16.350> just<00:03:16.380> been

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
crumple zones yes and they've just been

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.740 
crumple zones yes and they've just been
torched<00:03:17.220> off<00:03:17.460> they've<00:03:17.940> basically<00:03:18.150> been<00:03:18.390> cut

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
torched off they've basically been cut

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.380 
torched off they've basically been cut
off<00:03:18.930> and<00:03:19.230> others<00:03:19.650> have<00:03:19.770> been<00:03:19.890> welded<00:03:20.100> on<00:03:20.400> which

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
off and others have been welded on which

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.260 
off and others have been welded on which
will<00:03:21.570> obviously<00:03:22.340> infringe<00:03:23.340> the<00:03:23.550> integrity

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
will obviously infringe the integrity

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.060 
will obviously infringe the integrity
the<00:03:24.660> integrity<00:03:25.050> of<00:03:25.170> the<00:03:25.320> vehicle<00:03:25.680> from<00:03:25.890> the

the integrity of the vehicle from the

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.800 
the integrity of the vehicle from the
top<00:03:26.250> it<00:03:26.430> is<00:03:26.490> absolutely<00:03:27.120> huge<00:03:27.210> isn't<00:03:27.630> very

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
top it is absolutely huge isn't very

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.170 
top it is absolutely huge isn't very
nice<00:03:28.020> so<00:03:28.560> tell<00:03:28.800> me<00:03:28.920> if<00:03:29.160> I<00:03:29.400> have<00:03:29.610> an<00:03:29.790> accident

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
nice so tell me if I have an accident

nice so tell me if I have an accident
now<00:03:30.420> with<00:03:30.870> the<00:03:30.959> car<00:03:31.170> as<00:03:31.320> it<00:03:31.470> is<00:03:31.650> what's<00:03:32.280> going

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
now with the car as it is what's going

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:33.770 
now with the car as it is what's going
to<00:03:32.550> happen<00:03:32.850> the<00:03:33.030> possibility<00:03:33.600> is<00:03:33.750> that

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
to happen the possibility is that

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.750 
to happen the possibility is that
they've<00:03:34.020> gone<00:03:34.170> a<00:03:34.230> crumple<00:03:34.680> too<00:03:34.860> early<00:03:35.160> they're

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
they've gone a crumple too early they're

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.370 
they've gone a crumple too early they're
supposed<00:03:36.030> to<00:03:36.090> crumple<00:03:36.480> in<00:03:36.570> a<00:03:36.630> set<00:03:36.840> manner<00:03:37.080> so

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
supposed to crumple in a set manner so

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.410 
supposed to crumple in a set manner so
that<00:03:37.590> the<00:03:37.770> occupants<00:03:38.520> in<00:03:38.850> the<00:03:39.120> in<00:03:39.300> the

are<00:03:41.940> protected<00:03:42.480> on<00:03:42.990> the<00:03:43.320> other<00:03:43.500> hand<00:03:43.709> if<00:03:43.890> it's

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
are protected on the other hand if it's

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.860 
are protected on the other hand if it's
been<00:03:44.160> over<00:03:44.550> engineered<00:03:45.060> and<00:03:45.300> it<00:03:45.510> doesn't

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
been over engineered and it doesn't

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.470 
been over engineered and it doesn't
crumple<00:03:46.260> then<00:03:46.590> these<00:03:46.890> both<00:03:47.430> of<00:03:47.640> these<00:03:47.670> chassis

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
crumple then these both of these chassis

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:49.880 
crumple then these both of these chassis
legs<00:03:48.690> will<00:03:48.870> actually<00:03:49.170> push<00:03:49.380> into<00:03:49.680> the

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
legs will actually push into the

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.380 
legs will actually push into the
passenger<00:03:50.250> compartment<00:03:50.280> and<00:03:50.850> injure<00:03:51.150> any

what<00:03:53.990> makes<00:03:54.260> this<00:03:54.500> tale<00:03:54.830> even<00:03:55.010> more<00:03:55.460> chilling

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
what makes this tale even more chilling

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.150 
what makes this tale even more chilling
is<00:03:56.030> that<00:03:56.270> just<00:03:56.540> a<00:03:56.660> couple<00:03:56.870> of<00:03:57.050> days<00:03:57.230> ago<00:03:57.440> two

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
is that just a couple of days ago two
