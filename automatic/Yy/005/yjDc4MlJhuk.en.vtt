00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:06.510
 Hello friends, I am with you again 

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:09.180
 Igor Prime and today you, as promised tell 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.800
 how to align the wheel 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.980
 for this we need: a marker and a spoke key 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.039
 the first thing we need to remove the rubber with 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.030
 wheels because the wheel is always 

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:20.670
 equals rim 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:48.570
 and put our wheel back 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.670
 so how we see the problem is that 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.220
 the wheel is clearly eight 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:56.730
 and eight it to the left 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.889
 take the marker and 

00:00:58.889 --> 00:01:01.150
 turning the wheel 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.990
 bring the marker to the rim, gradually 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:06.420
 and look where it ruses 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.300
 in this place we have a line 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.800
 we mark the rim and see which way 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.180
 beating occurs and throughout 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.270
 how many needles 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.409
 now we need to tighten 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:19.759
 knitting needles from the opposite side and loosen with 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:22.429
 the side that beats the wheel 

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:25.009
 We look, where the rim as much as possible adjoins 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:26.820
 a brake 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.580
 and find the needle from the opposite 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.190
 parties 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.240
 with it we will begin 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.830
 twist first 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.610
 2 or 3 turns, since 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.950
 curvature is very strong 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.760
 and then we'll see 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.040
 is it worth it to pull up or not 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.190
 and look 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.409
 well, much better 

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:12.930
 now you need to mark 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.230
 and align on the other side 

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:29.709
 the thread was broken on this needle 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.420
 on the nipple, so we will change it to a new one 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:33.840
 Thank you so much! 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.080
 Alexandru Doroshenko, for giving them 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.390
 alignment bike 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:39.450
 wheels
