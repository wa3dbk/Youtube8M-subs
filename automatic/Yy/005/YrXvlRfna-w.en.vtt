00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:13.049
 That recipe is inspired by the 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.089
 cars that accompany I think so much what 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.400
 call ravers leave the link here at 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.320
 low in wet history and mine is a 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.510
 animal husbandry way of preparing chicken 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.880
 leaves juicy cheesy and makes him stay 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.760
 my taste ordinate 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:30.119
 we want the chicken breast 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:35.750
 We'll open it and butterfly, then 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.750
 Calm people will take time to open it 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:45.950
 also that bad gala night and oh 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:53.090
 you basically doubled it in size 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:57.790
 get pvc movie a few layers three 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.790
 layers is enough to put the 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:06.590
 close with a half and emel can use 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.330
 one like pasta those marked with 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.130
 pan- fried I am seeing here a 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.690
 iron skillet that is very heavy 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.450
 The idea is basically the following goes 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.220
 hit the chicken for it will double 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.890
 size to look great and more 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.780
 thin and this will help the meat stay 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.729
 even more comments police will separate 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.830
 a little more all these fibers of the 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:27.320
 chicken breast muscle very careful 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.420
 at the time of opening for it do not divide in 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.950
 I sort of half-split but still 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.920
 people are going to make sure that I go 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:38.210
 make faces in I go in will have a 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:45.190
 little salt because the whole team comes and goes 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:49.310
 I'll use two fantastic slices. 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:52.630
 Italian ham can be parma 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:55.670
 it may be that they are serrano ham 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:58.539
 Spanish, whatever you want, man, it's going to be 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:01.929
 Success complete the Parmesan cheese 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:01.929
 always pink 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:12.420
 and then I have to work the closing 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:14.180
 this case close to the paper and a 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:18.330
 take it out 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:26.220
 and then picked up again at the bottom 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:28.140
 he is now able to play now that the 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.930
 folks will do with a bed of more era 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:36.360
 basically strong for him and her I will 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:45.560
 use parsley and I'll use ale a bed 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:45.560
 new and then I'm going to put our cap 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:55.709
 to make him catch as much as he 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:58.190
 got these herbs here closed the 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.190
 Crazy 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:10.860
 What we can do now is the crisis. 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:12.690
 each with the sausage on Saturday and then 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.700
 make sure that the water that we go 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.250
 cook his money he will not enter 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:23.510
 I'll get aluminum foil there. 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:23.510
 make one more and one more powder 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:40.940
 boiling water, very quiet for some 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:44.180
 25 minutes in half the time he will hear it 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:46.130
 just to make sure all sides 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:50.380

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.380

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.030
