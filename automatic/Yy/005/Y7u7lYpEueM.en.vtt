00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
want but I'm not sure this is entirely

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.800 
want but I'm not sure this is entirely
true<00:01:32.729> this<00:01:32.909> is<00:01:33.060> this<00:01:33.210> way<00:01:33.390> I'm<00:01:33.509> interpreting

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
true this is this way I'm interpreting

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.060 
true this is this way I'm interpreting
it<00:01:34.170> because<00:01:34.409> I<00:01:34.470> went<00:01:34.619> back<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:34.740> played<00:01:34.950> some

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
it because I went back and played some

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.580 
it because I went back and played some
reflex<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:35.880> it's<00:01:36.689> seriously<00:01:37.079> it's<00:01:37.290> like<00:01:37.350> they

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
reflex and it's seriously it's like they

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.130 
reflex and it's seriously it's like they
took<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:38.040> reflex<00:01:38.520> physics<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.210> then<00:01:39.840> put<00:01:40.049> it

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
took the reflex physics and then put it

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.340 
took the reflex physics and then put it
inside<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.650> alive<00:01:41.159> game<00:01:41.579> engine<00:01:42.320> the<00:01:43.320> engine

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
inside the alive game engine the engine

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.530 
inside the alive game engine the engine
is<00:01:43.740> what<00:01:43.920> is<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.700> game<00:01:44.880> pretty<00:01:45.119> much<00:01:45.210> how<00:01:45.509> it

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
is what is the game pretty much how it

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.420 
is what is the game pretty much how it
runs<00:01:45.840> how<00:01:46.290> it<00:01:46.409> reacts<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:46.920> have<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.220> way<00:01:47.369> you

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
runs how it reacts to have the way you

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.580 
runs how it reacts to have the way you
move<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.759> controllers<00:01:48.149> everything<00:01:48.600> it's<00:01:48.750> the

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.910 
move the controllers everything it's the
and<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:50.670> physics<00:01:51.000> are<00:01:51.179> stupid<00:01:51.780> yeah<00:01:52.109> okay<00:01:52.829> I'm

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.289 
then pin the gas into a back flip how
was<00:02:06.990> that<00:02:07.170> even<00:02:07.200> possible<00:02:07.619> that's<00:02:08.459> so<00:02:08.700> arcade

I had I don't know like I know why I did
that<00:02:23.700> and<00:02:24.120> that's<00:02:24.390> why<00:02:24.620> that<00:02:25.620> was<00:02:25.709> another

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
that and that's why that was another

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.370 
that and that's why that was another
reason<00:02:26.010> why<00:02:26.340> i<00:02:26.400> haven't<00:02:26.549> had<00:02:26.730> a<00:02:26.790> video<00:02:26.970> up<00:02:27.329> is<00:02:27.750> a

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
reason why i haven't had a video up is a

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.470 
reason why i haven't had a video up is a
because<00:02:29.370> i<00:02:29.430> don't<00:02:29.579> have<00:02:29.640> any<00:02:29.849> gameplay<00:02:30.120> to<00:02:30.269> use

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
because i don't have any gameplay to use
