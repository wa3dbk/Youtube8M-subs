Chapter 12
A church does not provide refuge for criminals

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.240
Finally! Fiiiiinally!

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:15.604
What has happened, Father Beto? 

00:00:15.604 --> 00:00:16.781
Why are you so happy?

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.040
Bishop Dagoberto Noguera has found a priest to help me in the parish church.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.740
Bishop Noguera has been involved in several scandals, Father Beto.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.240
I wouldn’t trust him. 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.974
Do you know who the priest is? Where is he from?

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.640
His name is Pedro Perez and he is from Puebla. 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:32.160
What was he doing in Puebla?

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.200
He was in charge of pastoral work with children. 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.380
This comes at just the right time. 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.360
Father Perez will arrive tomorrow and his bedroom is not ready yet. 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.920
Richi, Richi!

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.320
Sister Juana, Richi...

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.820
 I would like to introduce you to Pedro Perez.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.480
In nomine Patris et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.100
Amen. 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.100
Father Pedro speaks Latin, he is an expert in Canonic Law, and he even plays the organ!

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.913
But we do not have an organ, Father Beto.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.100
Well we will get one. 

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:07.500
We cannot let such talent go to waste.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.460
Father Perez, Martín, what are you doing?

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.300
We are announcing the next camping trip for children.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.380
I thought that Richi was going to organize it.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.760
No, I will take charge of it. 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.440
Well done Martín. You have earned yourself a chocolate, come with me.

00:01:28.634 --> 00:01:30.634
In an unprecedented act

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.280
the United Nations has requested that the Holy See 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.940
immediately dismiss all priests who have sexually abused children

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.760
and hand them over to the civil authorities.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.780
This is a historic day for the victims who have been called liars by the Vatican.

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.940
Finally their dignity has been recognized!

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.520
The United Nations are so partial in their statements, Sister Juana. 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:58.580
They are not neutral; they are full of human rights groups and NGOs that hate the Church.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:59.440
Father Perez

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.460
Don’t you consider it shameful that the Church is being used to provide refuge for criminals? 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.360
The questionable decision to declare itself a nation-state like any other country, 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.860
now has turned against the Vatican 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.820
because now it must be held accountable to other states for its non-compliance with treaties.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.480
The Church has survived worse attacks. 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.780
If you will excuse me, I am going to bed. 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.840
Miseratur vestri omnipotents Deus.

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.260
I think that Bishop Dagoberto transferred Father Perez here 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.280
to distance him from his parish because of problems with pedophilia.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.020
What? 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.500
Father Perez is an extremely refined person.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.980
That is why he wants to take the children on the camping trip.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.780
That news report has really given you some ridiculous ideas.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.380
What is ridiculous is watching you turning a blind eye 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.060
so that you can have another priest in the parish.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:54.920
The Catholic community is outraged and is demanding that the Vatican practice the values it preaches.

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.780
Being evasive and sheltering criminals is not Catholic.

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.180
We demand that the Holy See accept the recommendations 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.960
of the United Nations’ Human Rights Committee and implement them immediately.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.800
I will not dismiss a brilliant priest just because of your suspicions, Sister Juana.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.440
But the hardest part was when we discovered that the Church itself

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.000
paid the lawyers of the priest who raped me.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.520
Father Nicanor Aguilera… 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.600
Oh, my God! Nicanor Aguilera is the very Father Perez. Look at him!

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:24.340
What?

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:25.240
I knew it.

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:30.240
Father Nicanor Aguilera is currently in hiding, travelling from parish to parish. Please help us find him.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.020
What do you have to say now, Father Beto?

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.340
Hello… phone directory? 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.640
Could you please give me the number of the Police?

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:39.300
To be continued...
