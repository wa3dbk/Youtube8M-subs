00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.290
 It is the possibility that many people 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.780
 many like-minded people together 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.180
 meet can exchange themselves times 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.810
 getting to know each other was just sitting together 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.190
 what nice food maybe there is 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.380
 Also a few lectures who has fun 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.720
 lectures can then be held 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.649
 also like to report to me that we can 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.690
 like to deny 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:29.310
 otherwise I hope that you numerous 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.979
 it appears that many nice new ones 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.050
 getting to know people brings your tents with you 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.940
 I definitely have mine there 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.160
 video description look a registration 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.229
 on my homepage on the official 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.550
 website I have prepared the there 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.959
 can you then specify as well as many 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.179
 people you come like many children you 

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:47.340
 bring with you if you bring along 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:50.190
 which days would like to stay the whole 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.459
 namely on the fifth sixth and 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:55.440
 seventh place June so ranking from fifth 

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:56.220
 about 15 o'clock that's what I'll be 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:01.410
 announce 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:03.390
 until the 17 also about 15 o'clock june that 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:05.849
 means in the best case is easy for you 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.729
 two nights can be a tent here somewhere 

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:11.640
 hit 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:16.849
 So I guess that counted 25 here 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.849
 so fit in 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:28.170
 surely there will be some rules 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.150
 like, for example, that's not an open one 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.650
 In truth, I am allowed to do fire 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.840
 that is not very clear 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.570
 otherwise feel free to come over 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.740
 would be very happy 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.940
 that does not mean that all vegans or 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.740
 must be raw food 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.220
 I just hope for many 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.060
 like-minded many are for that 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.580
 live in harmony with nature 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.040
 caring for the vegan raw food and 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.110
 so on and yes the whole is 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.220
 be free 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.290
 I'm just likely to become one 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.150
 Donate box for a few 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.080
 expenses and generally defendants future 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.390
 would like to donate 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.800
 So I have to see if in dixie 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.550
 klo get and I have somehow 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.930
 do differently 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.490
 otherwise I will be a little bit too 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.270
 but prepare by and large 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:10.350
 As I said, it's free 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:12.060
 self-catering so bring yourself 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.320
 Eat and drink with that is clear 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.610
 then you can still with each other 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.880
 look that one from the other 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.410
 tried or something and yes we can too 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.240
 go search for wild herbs 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.830
 let's see what else is growing 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.830
 berries and so there you go 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.910
 certainly also find a lot here 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.260
