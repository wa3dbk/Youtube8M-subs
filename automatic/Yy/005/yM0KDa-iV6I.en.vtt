00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.440
 taste today is again the ideal moment 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.440
 to have a lesson 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.850
 Well first, they're going to apologize to my nose 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.980
 I have a cold so I love you while 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.080
 I speak I hope I do not die while doing this 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:29.100
 video but you're my best attempt to 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.690
 make it clear and concise and beautiful 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.430
 there are times when we think that 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:34.499
 We are making the purchase in our 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.120
 lives but when they spend a few days or 

00:00:34.499 --> 00:00:37.589
 we return to our house we give ourselves 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.479
 mind that it was not the purchase anymore 

00:00:37.589 --> 00:00:41.249
 smart we've done that's why not 

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:43.019
 I came up with nothing better to put together 

00:00:41.249 --> 00:00:44.819
 every day that I have to do very 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:48.140
 good purchases that in the end will bring us 

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:50.699
 more satisfaction than repentance 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.250
 this trick is for all the buyers 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:54.960
 bibliographies that are receiving only 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.609
 it works in some stores so it's 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.190
 question of thinking if you want to buy 

00:00:56.609 --> 00:01:01.530
 something that is a little more expensive than 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.789
 that they usually have in their budget 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.799
 I will find it in your shopping cart 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.200
 shopping on the website and leave it there 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.810
 for some days and magically 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.280
 will arrive a mail of the brand 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.470
 offering them a wonderful discount 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.720
 which is usually 20 or up to 30 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.729
 cent to encourage them to buy the 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.200
 product that you have from Huawei for days as 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.240
 I already told you it does not work in all 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.369
 web pages but they will not lose 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.259
 interesting this world tip is very useful 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.909
 If you are going to have a day of shopping I do not know 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.580
 if it has happened to you that you have ever gone 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.500
 to the mall to buy something and it 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.020
 have asked that pants that I have 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.119
 here flirts that I have in my closet that 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.470
 can make this pants a 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.360
 good purchase because I will be able to 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.819
 combine many ways we think and 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.369
 we think we break our heads in the 

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:47.080
 students does not fire and in the end 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.760
 we can remember exactly all 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.620
 that we have in our case in these 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.960
 cases he used an application that would be 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.970
 snap that sincerely guys is a 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.280
 fabulous app is an app that you 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:00.220
 allows you to document your clothes your products 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.380
 of beauty your makeup accessories and 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.000
 all that kind of thing is very easy to 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.220
 use you have spaces that are called 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.140
 jaws which means shelving or shelves 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.119
 and there you can start analyzing other 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.430
 products of category form for example 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.590
 you can organize them by putting a group of 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.600
 crowd tops or all kinds of plan with this 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.460
 perfume this lipsticks or what 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.320
 you want or you can also make a 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.940
 requisition with specific things that 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.160
 make up a look that you like a lot 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.280
 these are mine and for example I have 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.780
 cocktail dresses I have heels 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.580
 lipsticks perfumes and so they can go 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.290
 organizing their little things the idea is that 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.670
 little by little I will take pictures of all 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.200
 the things you have and the fences 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.150
 organizing I love this application 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.800
 because it helps me see everything I have 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.480
 my closet without the need to be in 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.100
 my house which facilitates any 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.840
 purchase decision you have to make 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.790
 the moment of 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.530
 buy makeup because you can put 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.030
 the specific information of each 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.740
 product that you have and so for example 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.720
 one commented on the purchase error 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.400
 the same lip color or the same 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.020
 color of enamel so if you like 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.090
 leave shopping can not stop 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.340
 try to be because I'm going to help them 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.680
 maximum and lack enough and you can see 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.280
 other ledges of other people other 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.380
 users 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.850
 inspire you with the things you have if 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.320
 you like something soon you have the 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.600
 necessary information so that also 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.310
 you can buy it I'll leave a link 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.350
 so they can download the app and another 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.240
 so that they visit my user and can see 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.710
 all the little things that I have my next 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.960
 thing although sure many of you 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:22.480
 are practicing is to go against 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.280
 only with cash sometimes having 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.920
 a card and make debit or 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.810
 credit does not allow us to realize 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.730
 really how much money are we spending 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.160
 instead when you have cash 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.810
 literally the money in your hand is going to 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.430
 be more aware of the budget that 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.710
 you have and you 're going to see what you're going to do 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.720
 much more judicious when buying 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:42.550
 something there are some opportunities find 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.100
 a garment that we like and literally 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.739
 I have a small letter here telling me 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:51.280
 to me 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:53.530
 and before I think it's one of the most 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.690
 despairing however I already learned to 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.819
 overcome these crises and the secret is 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:00.640
 leave the garment or whatever you want 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:02.410
 buy and it's not safe in hong and the 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.120
 question is that if I go and I continue 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.640
 thinking about the garment and I can not leave 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.769
 to think about a car even though returning to 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.989
 buying it means that you really 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:12.819
 like and deserves to buy it if all and 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:14.440
 It really is not a garment for you or 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:16.419
 you're even going to think about going back or you 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.400
 will give a lot of lazy good technique 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:21.040
 and not fill us with a lot of things that 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.560
 we do not need is to use a rule that I 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.330
 I call a support basically it's about 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.150
 donate a piece of clothing when I buy something 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:30.160
 new so I receive a new product to 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.020
 my family and I do not give the opportunity to 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.639
 someone to use something that maybe I do not 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.500
 I'm going to use when I'm in a center 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:38.290
 commercial and I want to go shopping but 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:40.270
 I do not know what to buy exactly tried to 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:43.060
 look for garments that are multifunctional 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:45.820
 and from multi stations I do not know if you can 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:48.100
 say multi seasonal 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:51.370
 let's say it's a garment that you can 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:53.320
 use 365 days a year for example if 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.330
 I'm walking through the store and I see a 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.340
 sweater that I like very much I make sure 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:59.470
 make it a neutral color to be able 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.660
 use it in winter and in summer in 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.790
 spring and autumn in any type 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.620
 of climate and it's also very important that 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:07.180
 do not have a very thick fabric more than 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:09.250
 it has to be something light because in 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.960
 summer what they use only has wind 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:13.090
 I can put the many fields on top 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.280
 to keep me chin so every 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:17.320
 once they see something, try to make it a 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.750
 neutral color or a basic color or nothing 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:21.730
 very complex and it is preferable that it be a 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:23.470
 thin garment it again because 

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:25.480
 if it is something thick everything you put it 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:26.980
 in summer some people believe that 

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:29.110
 find more fronts you have more 

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:31.780
 options of looks to not have and are 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:33.700
 very, very wrong in my opinion 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.740
 the accessories are the most 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:37.810
 important in a look because they appear 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:39.910
 you can wear black pants and 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:41.590
 a white blouse the five days of the 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:43.780
 week that you have to go to work or the 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:45.730
 school or at school water anywhere and 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:47.590
 if you handle accessories you can 

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:48.190
 achieve that every day no matter how hard you are 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:50.650
 using 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:52.600
 for clothes arrived as looks totally 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:54.520
 different that's why it's important to buy 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:57.340
 different styles of shoes 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:59.970
 collars wallets that stand out a lot or 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:02.620
 colorful skirts 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:04.930
 this trick is pretty practical but 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:07.810
 we should only use it in cases of life 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:10.630
 15 - lie and it does not have to be in a 

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:12.580
 case of life death but if in some 

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:15.160
 situation where you can not prove 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:18.250
 a trouser because if that or because in the 

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:20.140
 tester's tail is infinite leaves the 

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:22.210
 store and you'll probably spend hours 

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:24.880
 to know if a trouser run I do not 

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:26.440
 you can play it by the waistband and support you 

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:28.570
 those of the neck to see if it closes or not 

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:30.670
 if you close it means that if you have left and 

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:32.290
 if it does not close there is a very big chance 

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:34.060
 that the pants are not the size 

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:35.890
 suitable for how much they buy something 

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:38.010
 Make sure that you are finding for 

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:42.230
 the present or for a very near future 

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:45.260
 maximum 20 days do not buy thinking 

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:51.860
 It leads us to the birthday of my best 

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:53.870
 friend who is next year not now no 

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:55.460
 I'm telling you to buy you all 

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:57.590
 the cocktail dresses that you find 

00:06:55.460 --> 00:07:01.730
 a store but if you are walking around 

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:03.620
 there and see one that lets them buy it 

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:05.900
 because some time they are going to have some 

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:07.730
 special event an elegant event and already 

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:09.320
 they will be more than ready 

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:11.570
 guys, I hope this video has 

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:13.160
 liked whether you referred to me 

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:15.110
 female audience a lot in this video 

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:16.880
 but I'm sure these tips are also
