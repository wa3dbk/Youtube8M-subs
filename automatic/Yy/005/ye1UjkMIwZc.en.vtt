00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
a cappuccino that just simply fits on

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.020 
a cappuccino that just simply fits on
top<00:00:46.350> there's<00:00:47.100> two<00:00:47.399> embossed<00:00:49.190> levels<00:00:50.190> the

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
top there's two embossed levels the

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.830 
top there's two embossed levels the
first<00:00:51.270> level<00:00:51.949> is<00:00:52.949> for<00:00:53.460> about<00:00:53.820> 100<00:00:54.360> milk<00:00:54.629> and

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
first level is for about 100 milk and

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.200 
first level is for about 100 milk and
that's<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.739> level<00:00:55.920> you<00:00:56.160> need<00:00:56.340> for<00:00:56.699> frothing

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
that's the level you need for frothing

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.599 
that's the level you need for frothing
milk<00:00:59.780> that's<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.960> maximum<00:01:01.289> setting<00:01:01.829> if<00:01:02.460> you

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
milk that's the maximum setting if you

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.490 
milk that's the maximum setting if you
go<00:01:02.760> beyond<00:01:03.120> that<00:01:03.210> then<00:01:03.899> there's<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.229> chance

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
go beyond that then there's a chance

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.190 
go beyond that then there's a chance
that<00:01:04.769> it<00:01:04.860> could<00:01:05.010> actually<00:01:05.360> overflow<00:01:06.360> so<00:01:07.049> we

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
that it could actually overflow so we

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.460 
that it could actually overflow so we
put<00:01:07.409> our<00:01:07.500> lid<00:01:07.650> on<00:01:08.630> we've<00:01:09.630> got<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:09.810> spout<00:01:10.170> the

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
put our lid on we've got a spout the

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.460 
put our lid on we've got a spout the
front<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:10.920> then<00:01:11.520> for<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.540> froth<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.080> heated

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
front and then for the froth and heated

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.789 
front and then for the froth and heated
milk<00:01:13.619> we<00:01:14.070> just<00:01:14.280> simply<00:01:15.320> one<00:01:16.320> push<00:01:16.590> of<00:01:16.740> the

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
milk we just simply one push of the

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.929 
milk we just simply one push of the
button<00:01:17.180> now<00:01:18.180> while<00:01:18.420> that's<00:01:18.680> running<00:01:19.939> we're

is milk to be suitable for a flat white
so<00:02:16.489> we're<00:02:16.910> using<00:02:17.090> this<00:02:17.599> panel<00:02:18.190> one<00:02:19.190> without

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
so we're using this panel one without

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:25.690 
so we're using this panel one without
that<00:02:19.760> spring<00:02:21.550> sit<00:02:22.550> it<00:02:22.670> on<00:02:22.760> powers<00:02:23.450> on<00:02:24.489> now<00:02:25.489> this

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
that spring sit it on powers on now this

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.250 
that spring sit it on powers on now this
time<00:02:26.000> we<00:02:26.239> can<00:02:26.390> actually<00:02:26.540> fill<00:02:26.900> it<00:02:26.989> up<00:02:27.080> a<00:02:27.230> bit

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
time we can actually fill it up a bit

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.479 
time we can actually fill it up a bit
further<00:02:27.849> to<00:02:28.849> the<00:02:29.360> second<00:02:29.720> level<00:02:29.900> mark<00:02:30.489> it's

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
further to the second level mark it's

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:39.339 
further to the second level mark it's
about<00:02:31.670> 200<00:02:32.269> mils<00:02:35.200> now<00:02:36.200> lid<00:02:37.810> now<00:02:38.810> in<00:02:39.050> this<00:02:39.170> case

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:39.349 
about 200 mils now lid now in this case

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:42.759 
about 200 mils now lid now in this case
the<00:02:39.980> first<00:02:40.180> push<00:02:41.180> before<00:02:41.810> was<00:02:42.080> heat<00:02:42.319> and<00:02:42.560> froth

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
the first push before was heat and froth

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:45.729 
the first push before was heat and froth
this<00:02:43.760> time<00:02:44.000> where<00:02:44.180> any<00:02:44.330> want<00:02:44.510> it<00:02:44.600> to<00:02:44.810> heat<00:02:44.989> so<00:02:45.709> I

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
this time where any want it to heat so I

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:52.690 
this time where any want it to heat so I
just<00:02:45.980> simply<00:02:46.780> two<00:02:47.780> pushes<00:02:48.019> of<00:02:48.290> the<00:02:48.380> button<00:02:51.700> ok

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
just simply two pushes of the button ok

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.809 
just simply two pushes of the button ok
so<00:02:52.850> milk<00:02:53.780> is<00:02:54.019> being<00:02:54.230> heated<00:02:54.459> and<00:02:55.459> that's

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:55.819 
so milk is being heated and that's

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:03.360 
so milk is being heated and that's
without<00:02:56.299> the<00:02:56.870> frothing<00:02:57.799> paddle<00:02:58.750> you<00:02:59.750> can<00:02:59.900> see

it<00:04:24.200> out<00:04:24.350> to<00:04:24.950> start<00:04:25.250> with<00:04:27.790> take<00:04:28.790> out<00:04:28.970> the<00:04:29.120> paddle

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
it out to start with take out the paddle

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:38.590 
it out to start with take out the paddle
just<00:04:30.530> in<00:04:30.740> warm<00:04:31.130> water<00:04:33.550> the<00:04:34.550> leader<00:04:37.600> then

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:38.600 
just in warm water the leader then

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.760 
just in warm water the leader then
obviously<00:04:40.930> you<00:04:41.930> have<00:04:42.080> the<00:04:42.200> electrics<00:04:42.560> in<00:04:42.650> the

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
obviously you have the electrics in the

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.640 
obviously you have the electrics in the
base<00:04:42.920> so<00:04:43.790> you'd<00:04:44.480> never<00:04:44.690> miss<00:04:44.960> it<00:04:45.140> submerging

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
base so you'd never miss it submerging

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.890 
base so you'd never miss it submerging
any<00:04:45.770> more<00:04:46.040> it's<00:04:46.970> not<00:04:47.060> designed<00:04:47.480> for<00:04:47.600> that<00:04:47.780> at

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
any more it's not designed for that at

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.830 
any more it's not designed for that at
all<00:04:47.990> you<00:04:48.230> only<00:04:48.680> keep<00:04:49.640> the<00:04:49.850> water<00:04:50.480> in<00:04:50.570> the<00:04:50.690> top

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
all you only keep the water in the top

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.700 
all you only keep the water in the top
part<00:04:51.050> in<00:04:51.260> so<00:04:51.890> after<00:04:52.190> a<00:04:52.250> bit<00:04:52.370> of<00:04:52.460> a<00:04:52.550> rinse<00:04:53.710> just

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
part in so after a bit of a rinse just

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:59.580 
part in so after a bit of a rinse just
get<00:04:54.890> a<00:04:54.920> damp<00:04:55.820> cloth<00:04:57.040> simply<00:04:58.040> wipe<00:04:58.880> it<00:04:59.000> around

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
get a damp cloth simply wipe it around

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.660 
get a damp cloth simply wipe it around
and<00:05:00.590> this<00:05:00.710> should<00:05:00.860> always<00:05:00.980> really<00:05:01.430> be<00:05:01.520> done

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:01.670 
and this should always really be done

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:05.950 
and this should always really be done
after<00:05:02.590> after<00:05:03.590> using<00:05:03.950> it<00:05:04.070> because<00:05:04.910> milk<00:05:05.510> will

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:05.960 
after after using it because milk will

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:12.210 
after after using it because milk will
stick<00:05:06.230> and<00:05:06.500> all<00:05:07.310> go<00:05:07.550> hard<00:05:07.850> so<00:05:09.190> pretty<00:05:10.190> easy<00:05:10.930> and

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:12.220 
stick and all go hard so pretty easy and

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:15.040 
stick and all go hard so pretty easy and
let's<00:05:13.220> just<00:05:13.430> sit<00:05:13.580> us<00:05:13.670> back<00:05:13.850> on<00:05:14.030> top<00:05:14.210> push<00:05:14.840> that

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.050 
let's just sit us back on top push that

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:20.770 
let's just sit us back on top push that
down<00:05:16.180> put<00:05:17.180> the<00:05:17.300> lid<00:05:17.420> on<00:05:19.300> ready<00:05:20.300> for<00:05:20.390> the<00:05:20.540> next

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:20.780 
down put the lid on ready for the next
