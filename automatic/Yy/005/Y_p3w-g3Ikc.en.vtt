things<00:00:05.540> I've<00:00:06.540> got<00:00:06.720> my<00:00:06.870> floor<00:00:07.080> bolted<00:00:07.470> in<00:00:07.589> up<00:00:08.010> to

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
things I've got my floor bolted in up to

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.270 
things I've got my floor bolted in up to
the<00:00:08.340> park<00:00:08.900> we're<00:00:09.900> up<00:00:10.139> here<00:00:10.410> it<00:00:10.530> will<00:00:10.620> have<00:00:11.250> a

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
the park we're up here it will have a

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.770 
the park we're up here it will have a
hinge<00:00:11.580> on<00:00:11.730> it<00:00:11.880> for<00:00:12.030> the<00:00:12.059> battery<00:00:12.420> in<00:00:12.540> for<00:00:12.719> the

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
hinge on it for the battery in for the

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.950 
hinge on it for the battery in for the
brakes<00:00:13.019> and<00:00:13.259> my<00:00:13.650> seats<00:00:13.889> are<00:00:14.070> bolted<00:00:14.219> in<00:00:14.960> not

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
brakes and my seats are bolted in not

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.570 
brakes and my seats are bolted in not
permanently<00:00:16.289> both<00:00:16.650> of<00:00:16.830> everything's<00:00:17.220> both<00:00:17.400> in

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
permanently both of everything's both in

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.700 
permanently both of everything's both in
place<00:00:17.850> enough<00:00:18.270> so<00:00:18.570> that<00:00:18.600> I<00:00:18.810> can<00:00:18.869> kind<00:00:19.500> of<00:00:19.529> see

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
place enough so that I can kind of see

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.769 
place enough so that I can kind of see
what<00:00:19.859> it<00:00:19.949> feels<00:00:20.100> like<00:00:20.279> and<00:00:20.730> I<00:00:21.150> also<00:00:21.270> redesigned

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
what it feels like and I also redesigned

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.920 
what it feels like and I also redesigned
my<00:00:22.170> shifter<00:00:22.590> if<00:00:23.070> you'll<00:00:23.220> notice<00:00:23.630> from<00:00:24.630> back

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
my shifter if you'll notice from back

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.029 
my shifter if you'll notice from back
here<00:00:25.460> you<00:00:26.460> can<00:00:26.640> see<00:00:26.910> it<00:00:27.029> sticking<00:00:27.330> up<00:00:27.920> you<00:00:28.920> know

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
here you can see it sticking up you know

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.020 
here you can see it sticking up you know
when<00:00:29.220> you're<00:00:29.369> behind<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:30.119> car<00:00:30.359> and<00:00:30.689> I<00:00:32.000> when<00:00:33.000> I

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
when you're behind the car and I when I

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.420 
when you're behind the car and I when I
had<00:00:33.239> this<00:00:33.390> wrench<00:00:34.260> on<00:00:34.500> here<00:00:34.680> before<00:00:35.010> I<00:00:35.040> had<00:00:35.309> it

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
had this wrench on here before I had it

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.910 
had this wrench on here before I had it
on<00:00:35.550> so<00:00:36.149> that<00:00:36.270> it<00:00:36.420> came<00:00:36.660> off<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:37.200> went<00:00:37.380> down<00:00:37.620> and

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
on so that it came off and went down and

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.280 
on so that it came off and went down and
then<00:00:38.010> curl<00:00:38.309> back<00:00:38.610> up<00:00:38.750> and<00:00:39.750> what<00:00:39.840> I<00:00:39.870> did<00:00:40.110> was<00:00:40.140> I

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
then curl back up and what I did was I

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.260 
then curl back up and what I did was I
reversed<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.890> bend<00:00:41.160> in<00:00:41.370> it<00:00:41.399> so<00:00:41.730> when<00:00:42.000> it<00:00:42.120> comes

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
reversed the bend in it so when it comes

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.660 
reversed the bend in it so when it comes
off<00:00:42.510> it<00:00:42.690> comes<00:00:42.719> immediately<00:00:43.140> up<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:43.860> then<00:00:43.950> out

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
off it comes immediately up and then out

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.220 
off it comes immediately up and then out
to<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.879> side<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.450> when<00:00:45.870> this<00:00:46.250> when<00:00:47.250> this

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
to the side and when this when this

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.069 
to the side and when this when this
piston<00:00:49.230> sits<00:00:49.620> right<00:00:50.070> it's<00:00:50.460> it's<00:00:50.789> fairly<00:00:51.690> close

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
piston sits right it's it's fairly close

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.110 
piston sits right it's it's fairly close
to<00:00:52.289> level<00:00:52.680> which<00:00:52.860> is<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.190> look<00:00:53.399> I<00:00:53.550> wanted<00:00:53.969> you

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
to level which is the look I wanted you

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.330 
to level which is the look I wanted you
know<00:00:54.210> that's<00:00:54.390> that's<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.840> way<00:00:54.930> I<00:00:55.340> envisioned

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
know that's that's the way I envisioned

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.709 
know that's that's the way I envisioned
that<00:00:56.430> that<00:00:56.670> should<00:00:56.940> look<00:00:57.180> not<00:00:57.449> with<00:00:57.629> the

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
that that should look not with the

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.420 
that that should look not with the
Pistor<00:00:58.079> piston<00:00:58.590> all<00:00:58.739> hanging<00:00:59.039> off<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.309> the

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
Pistor piston all hanging off to the

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.349 
Pistor piston all hanging off to the
side<00:00:59.670> there<00:00:59.969> so<00:01:00.500> i'm<00:01:01.500> happy<00:01:01.800> i'm<00:01:02.370> i'm<00:01:03.090> very

side there so i'm happy i'm i'm very

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.990 
side there so i'm happy i'm i'm very
happy<00:01:03.510> i'm<00:01:03.780> gonna<00:01:04.260> have<00:01:05.189> it<00:01:05.339> jumped<00:01:05.640> in<00:01:05.729> it<00:01:05.760> yet

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
happy i'm gonna have it jumped in it yet

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.230 
happy i'm gonna have it jumped in it yet
i'm<00:01:06.270> about<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.780> first<00:01:07.740> time<00:01:08.010> with<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.000> seats

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
i'm about to first time with the seats

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.580 
i'm about to first time with the seats
bolted<00:01:09.630> down<00:01:09.780> getting<00:01:10.439> in<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.650> car<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.420> oh<00:01:12.590> I

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
bolted down getting in the car and oh I

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.410 
bolted down getting in the car and oh I
like<00:01:13.860> that<00:01:13.890> shifter<00:01:14.520> see<00:01:14.729> it<00:01:14.970> doesn't<00:01:15.299> know

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
like that shifter see it doesn't know

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.990 
like that shifter see it doesn't know
I'm<00:01:16.380> not<00:01:16.530> really<00:01:16.590> banging<00:01:17.009> my<00:01:17.250> leg<00:01:17.460> into<00:01:17.670> it<00:01:17.909> or

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
I'm not really banging my leg into it or

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.350 
I'm not really banging my leg into it or
anything<00:01:18.619> that's<00:01:19.619> neutral<00:01:20.220> there<00:01:20.490> so<00:01:21.210> let's

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
anything that's neutral there so let's

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.890 
anything that's neutral there so let's
just<00:01:21.509> try<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.780> gears<00:01:22.110> there's<00:01:22.380> first<00:01:22.830> second

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900 
just try the gears there's first second

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.390 
just try the gears there's first second
seconds<00:01:24.900> a<00:01:24.960> little<00:01:25.170> close<00:01:25.439> to<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:26.070> steering

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
seconds a little close to the steering

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.520 
seconds a little close to the steering
wheel<00:01:26.610> that's<00:01:26.820> something<00:01:27.150> I<00:01:27.240> ran<00:01:28.140> into<00:01:28.290> before

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
wheel that's something I ran into before

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.109 
wheel that's something I ran into before
because<00:01:29.009> when<00:01:29.220> you're<00:01:29.400> shifting<00:01:29.729> it<00:01:29.880> you<00:01:30.000> go

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
because when you're shifting it you go

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.490 
because when you're shifting it you go
to<00:01:30.180> turn<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:30.659> hit<00:01:30.750> your<00:01:30.900> knuckles<00:01:31.259> on<00:01:31.380> that

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
to turn and hit your knuckles on that

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.100 
to turn and hit your knuckles on that
that<00:01:31.680> doesn't<00:01:31.829> work<00:01:32.040> so<00:01:32.250> what<00:01:32.400> I<00:01:32.430> might<00:01:32.670> do<00:01:32.909> is

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
that doesn't work so what I might do is

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.810 
that doesn't work so what I might do is
put<00:01:34.110> another<00:01:34.350> put<00:01:34.890> another<00:01:35.100> been<00:01:35.460> dry<00:01:35.790> here

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
put another put another been dry here

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.330 
put another put another been dry here
and<00:01:36.380> then<00:01:37.380> get<00:01:37.590> this<00:01:37.740> out<00:01:37.950> this<00:01:38.100> little

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
and then get this out this little

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.130 
and then get this out this little
further<00:01:38.579> anyway<00:01:39.090> first<00:01:41.509> how<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.570> easier<00:01:42.960> I

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
further anyway first how the easier I

00:01:43.140 --> 00:02:13.280 
further anyway first how the easier I
crank<00:01:43.439> this<00:01:43.590> thing

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.450 

I'll<00:02:13.860> be<00:02:14.040> 34<00:02:14.819> now<00:02:15.480> this<00:02:15.510> year

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:23.790 

what<00:02:19.460> I'm<00:02:19.550> under<00:02:20.740> what<00:02:21.740> am<00:02:21.860> I<00:02:21.950> news<00:02:22.160> though

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
transmission it actually feels like it's

shift<00:03:02.040> pretty<00:03:02.250> good<00:03:02.490> up<00:03:02.640> there<00:03:02.670> I<00:03:02.880> thought<00:03:03.390> it

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
shift pretty good up there I thought it

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.210 
shift pretty good up there I thought it
would<00:03:03.600> be<00:03:03.750> big<00:03:03.960> awkward<00:03:04.200> darmiyan<00:03:04.800> in<00:03:05.010> the<00:03:05.100> way

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
would be big awkward darmiyan in the way

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.790 
would be big awkward darmiyan in the way
but<00:03:05.490> it<00:03:06.030> ain't<00:03:06.240> it<00:03:07.110> says<00:03:07.260> a<00:03:07.290> reason<00:03:07.590> why<00:03:07.680> they

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
but it ain't it says a reason why they

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.670 
but it ain't it says a reason why they
put<00:03:07.950> in<00:03:08.100> big<00:03:08.250> shifters<00:03:08.610> on<00:03:08.760> the<00:03:08.790> mold<00:03:09.030> cars

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
put in big shifters on the mold cars

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.220 
put in big shifters on the mold cars
anyway<00:03:10.680> I<00:03:11.450> think<00:03:12.450> the<00:03:12.540> next<00:03:12.570> thing<00:03:12.900> we<00:03:12.990> need<00:03:13.080> is

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
anyway I think the next thing we need is

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.770 
anyway I think the next thing we need is
a<00:03:13.290> test<00:03:13.530> drive<00:03:14.300> maybe<00:03:15.300> I'll<00:03:15.450> see<00:03:15.570> if<00:03:15.630> my

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
a test drive maybe I'll see if my

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.950 
a test drive maybe I'll see if my
sweetie<00:03:16.050> would<00:03:16.200> like<00:03:16.350> to<00:03:16.440> ride<00:03:16.590> along<00:03:16.860> and

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:17.960 
sweetie would like to ride along and

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.880 
sweetie would like to ride along and
even<00:03:18.960> though<00:03:19.050> I<00:03:19.080> haven't<00:03:19.290> finished<00:03:19.470> the<00:03:19.710> floor

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
even though I haven't finished the floor

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.180 
even though I haven't finished the floor
up<00:03:20.070> in<00:03:20.190> there<00:03:20.400> and<00:03:20.670> i<00:03:21.210> will<00:03:21.780> but<00:03:22.050> that<00:03:23.010> would<00:03:23.160> be

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
up in there and i will but that would be

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.860 
up in there and i will but that would be
easy<00:03:23.400> to<00:03:23.580> do<00:03:23.790> i'm<00:03:23.970> going<00:03:24.120> to<00:03:24.180> come<00:03:24.480> and<00:03:24.600> hinge

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
easy to do i'm going to come and hinge

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.050 
easy to do i'm going to come and hinge
some<00:03:25.110> pieces<00:03:25.320> to<00:03:25.560> go<00:03:25.680> in<00:03:25.770> there<00:03:25.920> but<00:03:26.670> i<00:03:26.850> think

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
some pieces to go in there but i think

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.970 
some pieces to go in there but i think
it<00:03:27.120> might<00:03:27.240> be<00:03:27.270> fun<00:03:27.540> to<00:03:27.570> take<00:03:27.870> a<00:03:27.930> ride<00:03:28.200> with<00:03:28.830> the

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
it might be fun to take a ride with the

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.350 
it might be fun to take a ride with the
new<00:03:29.100> shifter<00:03:29.490> and<00:03:29.520> with<00:03:29.700> the<00:03:29.790> seat<00:03:29.970> bolt<00:03:30.240> it

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
new shifter and with the seat bolt it

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.700 
new shifter and with the seat bolt it
down<00:03:30.510> so<00:03:30.810> I<00:03:30.960> could<00:03:31.140> see<00:03:31.320> if<00:03:31.380> she's<00:03:31.530> interested

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:31.710 
down so I could see if she's interested

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:34.280 
down so I could see if she's interested
in<00:03:32.040> a<00:03:32.130> ride
