 you can update via route 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:28.570
 ie the iff there was the pier personal touch 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:31.090
 if you try to upgrade and it 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:35.020
 do not allow your cellphone to error 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:41.650
 both via wifi and what would be the 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:45.820
 attack or o how every one to use samsung 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:49.900
 yoon bit is recommended for any 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:53.800
 use the utility that belongs to the 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:59.220
 samsung is the samsung pier and route the see of 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:03:02.380
 The truth is that it's what the so-called wifi 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.510
 right then you can do it through 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.820
 error message is because your 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.400
 device is with roth 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.620
 you did guti that when it is routed 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.350
 called routed you can not do 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.690
 updating it 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:21.400
 So, how do I do that? 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:27.040
 factory reset factor x factor 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:30.400
 7 the china is the hard core i7 i think you 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:33.310
 There are two types of signaling around you. 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.600
 it propagates to the factory default me 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.600
 rolling portuguese 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.610
 and then you can update it for ne 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.620
 one there you can put the roth again 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:43.930
 it's okay problem between 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.180
 the two that if you send him 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.670
 way to technical assistance you lose 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.130
 guarantee of good staff 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.950
