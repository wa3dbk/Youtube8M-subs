always a slight kind of lottery aspect
to<00:01:47.340> it<00:01:47.369> but<00:01:47.640> you<00:01:48.000> know<00:01:48.119> we've<00:01:48.509> got<00:01:48.659> some<00:01:48.840> really

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
to it but you know we've got some really

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.510 
to it but you know we've got some really
exciting<00:01:49.320> players<00:01:50.000> I<00:01:51.439> think<00:01:52.439> there's<00:01:53.340> a<00:01:53.430> lot

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
exciting players I think there's a lot

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.609 
exciting players I think there's a lot
of<00:01:53.579> confidence<00:01:54.030> in<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.360> group<00:01:54.570> still<00:01:54.899> from

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
of confidence in the group still from

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.050 
of confidence in the group still from
what<00:01:55.649> happened<00:01:55.920> in<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.040> last<00:01:56.189> 20<00:01:56.700> 20<00:01:56.909> World

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
what happened in the last 20 20 World

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.139 
what happened in the last 20 20 World
Cup<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:57.860> I<00:01:58.860> don't<00:01:59.490> see<00:01:59.670> any<00:01:59.790> reason<00:01:59.820> why<00:02:00.090> we

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
Cup and I don't see any reason why we

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.869 
Cup and I don't see any reason why we
can't<00:02:00.299> get<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.659> whole<00:02:00.780> way
