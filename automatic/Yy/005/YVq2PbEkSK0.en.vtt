00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.859
 welcome to the video with the 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.600
 theme the time 

00:00:03.859 --> 00:00:08.580
 this video shows you how to do that 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.929
 time in German colloquially 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.580
 expresses and gives you many examples 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:18.140
 note the big ones in all the examples 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:20.340
 and lowercase we begin 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.710
 First, let's see the full ones 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.869
 hours in the colloquial language 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.560
 Only the hours from one to 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:31.830
 Twelve uses the word clock will follow 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:37.399
 the time not used the 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:48.410
 full hours then simply 1 2 3 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:52.199
 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:53.160
 Attention to this time we say in 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.850
 the colloquial language 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.699
 it's 1 if we have additional clock 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:04.710
 So use officially specify the time 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:07.910
 then it is said it is a clock it is 1 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.380
 clock is wrong 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:12.750
 Let's see the times now 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.480
 more exactly how do we give in the 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.570
 colloquial the minutes 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:22.800
 For this we used the word for now 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.700
 First let's say the minutes after that and 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:30.990
 then the hours 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:33.350
 it is then one after 1 3 to 1 below 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:39.510
 five minutes you can say easy 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:44.910
 shortly after one comes 5 to 1 10 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:46.649
 after 1 and then quarter past one for 15 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:50.280
 minutes are said in the colloquial language 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:53.600
 almost always quarter and last 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.490
 time that is imitated with 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.440
 twenty to one 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:04.380
 analogously, the times before the 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:11.530
 full hour they made loud one before 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:14.280
 1341 or just before 15h 110 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:19.870
 before 1 quarter to one 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:22.690
 20 41 if it is exactly 30 minutes after the 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:26.280
 Full hour is used to the word 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:30.850
 Half and then calls the next hour 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:37.410
 These times are half past eleven 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:39.550
 one-two-two-thirty, and so on 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:43.440
 Let us now consider the area between 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:45.630

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.310

00:02:51.150 --> 00:03:00.430
 shortly before half past eleven half past twelve 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.880
 half past twelve 5 past half past 12 10 after half 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.560

 not we use the words before and 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.180

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:20.200
 the colloquial language used and can 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:25.990
 not with the official times 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:28.240
 be combined from 13 to 0 o'clock so 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.140
 that was then already everything currently in 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.600
 the colloquial language 

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:33.700
