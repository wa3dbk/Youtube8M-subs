00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
motorcycle on that first I think it's

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.999 
motorcycle on that first I think it's
the<00:01:31.860> first<00:01:32.009> time<00:01:32.130> he<00:01:32.280> wrote<00:01:32.430> a<00:01:32.460> bike<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:34.009> in

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
the first time he wrote a bike and in

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.760 
the first time he wrote a bike and in
response<00:01:35.310> than<00:01:35.789> I<00:01:35.850> got<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.060> drz<00:01:36.539> than<00:01:36.899> genelia

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
response than I got the drz than genelia

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.430 
response than I got the drz than genelia
fora

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:41.440 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.140 

I<00:01:41.530> actually<00:01:42.280> think<00:01:42.550> if<00:01:42.820> I<00:01:42.880> was<00:01:42.970> going<00:01:43.090> to

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.150 
I actually think if I was going to

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:44.820 
I actually think if I was going to
upgrade<00:01:43.300> to<00:01:43.480> anything<00:01:43.810> so<00:01:44.140> I'm<00:01:44.260> really<00:01:44.560> happy

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
upgrade to anything so I'm really happy

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.230 
upgrade to anything so I'm really happy
with<00:01:45.160> this<00:01:45.280> bike<00:01:45.490> and<00:01:45.640> they<00:01:45.700> don't<00:01:45.880> feel<00:01:46.030> any

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
with this bike and they don't feel any

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.900 
with this bike and they don't feel any
reason<00:01:46.510> to<00:01:46.540> get<00:01:46.660> rid<00:01:46.720> of<00:01:46.900> it<00:01:47.050> I<00:01:48.010> probably

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:48.910 
reason to get rid of it I probably

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.090 
reason to get rid of it I probably
honestly<00:01:49.390> I<00:01:49.690> probably<00:01:49.750> get<00:01:50.050> a<00:01:50.110> boost<00:01:50.290> at<00:01:50.440> 1,300

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
honestly I probably get a boost at 1,300

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.760 
honestly I probably get a boost at 1,300
just<00:01:51.520> because<00:01:51.790> it's<00:01:51.970> such<00:01:52.150> a<00:01:52.180> big<00:01:52.450> bike<00:01:52.770> that

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
just because it's such a big bike that

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.130 
just because it's such a big bike that
it's<00:01:54.160> something<00:01:54.550> you<00:01:55.270> know<00:01:55.390> I've<00:01:55.480> seen<00:01:55.930> the

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
it's something you know I've seen the

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.930 
it's something you know I've seen the
people<00:01:56.410> but<00:01:56.530> bar<00:01:56.770> risers<00:01:56.980> on<00:01:57.370> it<00:01:57.520> that<00:01:57.640> I<00:01:57.670> would

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940 
people but bar risers on it that I would

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:05.770 
people but bar risers on it that I would
make<00:01:58.120> it<00:01:58.300> a<00:01:58.330> large<00:01:59.080> touring<00:01:59.850> sport

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.560 

probably<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:06.870> grand<00:02:07.050> canyon<00:02:07.260> trip<00:02:08.420> may<00:02:09.420> if

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:09.570 
probably the grand canyon trip may if

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:11.030 
probably the grand canyon trip may if

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.040 
not maybe the strawberry trip because it

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.830 
not maybe the strawberry trip because it
was<00:02:11.130> a<00:02:11.190> few<00:02:11.340> days<00:02:11.460> longer<00:02:11.820> but<00:02:12.150> it<00:02:12.180> was<00:02:12.420> for

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
total distance I mean one point to

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.130
