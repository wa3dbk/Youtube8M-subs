00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:37.220 
the first real test of the cover we had

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.830 
the first real test of the cover we had
a<00:00:37.250> pretty<00:00:37.520> good<00:00:37.610> storm<00:00:37.970> last<00:00:38.239> night<00:00:39.640> and<00:00:40.840> this

cover

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.130 
cover
unlike<00:00:42.830> a<00:00:42.860> lot<00:00:43.070> of<00:00:43.190> covers<00:00:43.720> see<00:00:44.720> how<00:00:44.840> the<00:00:44.900> water

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
unlike a lot of covers see how the water

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.740 
unlike a lot of covers see how the water
just<00:00:45.530> kind<00:00:45.739> of<00:00:45.769> beads<00:00:46.070> up<00:00:46.309> on<00:00:46.489> it<00:00:49.450> it<00:00:50.450> just

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
just kind of beads up on it it just

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.340 
just kind of beads up on it it just
rolls<00:00:50.960> right<00:00:51.140> off<00:00:52.000> it<00:00:53.000> doesn't<00:00:53.239> sink<00:00:53.899> in<00:00:54.110> or

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
rolls right off it doesn't sink in or

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:02.910 
rolls right off it doesn't sink in or
absorb<00:00:54.739> into<00:00:54.980> the<00:00:55.130> cover

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.640 

and<00:01:03.479> the<00:01:04.479> cover<00:01:04.689> isn't<00:01:04.900> completely

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:05.650 
and the cover isn't completely

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:11.389 
and the cover isn't completely
waterproof

00:01:11.389 --> 00:01:11.399 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:13.440 

instead<00:01:12.399> it<00:01:12.580> lets<00:01:12.790> a<00:01:12.909> little<00:01:13.149> bit<00:01:13.240> of<00:01:13.330> water

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
instead it lets a little bit of water

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.240 
instead it lets a little bit of water
through<00:01:14.409> the<00:01:14.560> cover<00:01:14.799> I'm<00:01:15.159> told<00:01:16.770> because<00:01:17.770> it

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
through the cover I'm told because it

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:19.889 
through the cover I'm told because it
needs<00:01:18.729> to<00:01:18.850> be<00:01:18.909> breathable<00:01:19.570> because<00:01:19.720> they

00:01:19.889 --> 00:01:19.899 
needs to be breathable because they

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:21.029 
needs to be breathable because they
don't<00:01:20.049> want<00:01:20.170> moisture<00:01:20.560> to<00:01:20.680> get<00:01:20.830> trapped

00:01:21.029 --> 00:01:21.039 
don't want moisture to get trapped

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:22.770 
don't want moisture to get trapped
underneath<00:01:21.369> but<00:01:21.909> this<00:01:22.060> is<00:01:22.210> a<00:01:22.240> custom-fit

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
underneath but this is a custom-fit

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:28.260 
underneath but this is a custom-fit
cover<00:01:23.229> and<00:01:24.009> it<00:01:24.460> ran<00:01:24.700> about<00:01:25.630> 320<00:01:26.470> dollars<00:01:27.270> but

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
cover and it ran about 320 dollars but

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:29.490 
cover and it ran about 320 dollars but
since<00:01:28.539> the<00:01:28.659> car<00:01:28.810> is<00:01:28.840> going<00:01:28.990> to<00:01:29.049> be<00:01:29.170> outside

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
since the car is going to be outside

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.090 
since the car is going to be outside
most<00:01:29.799> the<00:01:29.950> time<00:01:30.130> now<00:01:31.530> that's<00:01:32.530> worth<00:01:32.740> it

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
most the time now that's worth it

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:38.359 
most the time now that's worth it
I<00:01:33.149> can't<00:01:34.149> use<00:01:34.299> this<00:01:34.450> garage<00:01:34.750> here<00:01:35.050> so<00:01:37.110> anyway

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
I can't use this garage here so anyway

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.160 
I can't use this garage here so anyway
it's<00:01:39.369> fitted<00:01:40.000> it<00:01:40.840> has<00:01:41.020> elastic<00:01:41.590> on<00:01:41.710> the<00:01:41.830> bottom

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
it's fitted it has elastic on the bottom

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.480 
it's fitted it has elastic on the bottom
you'll<00:01:44.170> see<00:01:44.350> there's<00:01:44.590> some<00:01:44.830> water<00:01:45.039> that<00:01:45.280> comes

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
you'll see there's some water that comes

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.660 
you'll see there's some water that comes
through<00:01:46.140> however<00:01:47.140> if<00:01:48.009> you<00:01:48.190> keep<00:01:48.340> the<00:01:48.459> car

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
through however if you keep the car

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.779 
through however if you keep the car
clean<00:01:49.409> it's<00:01:50.409> not<00:01:50.619> a<00:01:50.679> big<00:01:50.920> issue<00:01:50.950> because<00:01:51.640> the

00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:51.789 
clean it's not a big issue because the

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:57.920 
clean it's not a big issue because the
water<00:01:52.000> just<00:01:52.330> evaporates<00:01:53.200> out<00:01:55.080> super<00:01:56.080> can

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
water just evaporates out super can

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:09.230 
water just evaporates out super can
just<00:01:59.750> soften<00:02:00.750> this<00:02:00.900> edge<00:02:07.759> for<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:08.820> most<00:02:09.000> part

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
just soften this edge for the most part

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:25.510 
just soften this edge for the most part
stays<00:02:09.509> pretty<00:02:09.720> dry<00:02:11.030> pretty<00:02:12.030> happy<00:02:12.390> with<00:02:12.480> that

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.250 

one<00:02:26.330> thing<00:02:26.510> if<00:02:26.630> you're<00:02:26.720> ever<00:02:26.870> going<00:02:27.020> to<00:02:27.080> run<00:02:27.200> a

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
one thing if you're ever going to run a

one thing if you're ever going to run a
car<00:02:27.530> cover<00:02:27.740> though<00:02:27.950> don't<00:02:28.400> let<00:02:28.790> it<00:02:28.910> hit<00:02:29.030> the

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
car cover though don't let it hit the

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.170 
car cover though don't let it hit the
ground<00:02:29.830> if<00:02:30.830> you'll<00:02:31.010> scratch<00:02:31.370> your<00:02:31.580> paint<00:02:31.610> no

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
ground if you'll scratch your paint no

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.770 
ground if you'll scratch your paint no
time<00:02:33.490> you<00:02:34.490> see<00:02:34.700> there<00:02:34.880> is<00:02:35.000> water<00:02:35.270> that<00:02:35.420> came

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
time you see there is water that came

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:41.410 
time you see there is water that came
through<00:02:38.860> but<00:02:39.860> again<00:02:40.130> keep<00:02:40.640> the<00:02:40.820> car<00:02:40.970> clean<00:02:41.210> and

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
through but again keep the car clean and

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.540 
through but again keep the car clean and
it'll<00:02:41.540> be<00:02:41.630> fine<00:02:43.540> it'll<00:02:44.890> the<00:02:45.890> cover<00:02:46.220> supposed

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
it'll be fine it'll the cover supposed

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.420 
it'll be fine it'll the cover supposed
to<00:02:46.760> really<00:02:47.270> protect<00:02:47.480> from<00:02:47.870> the<00:02:48.140> Sun<00:02:48.860> as<00:02:49.280> well

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
to really protect from the Sun as well

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:58.990 
to really protect from the Sun as well
so

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.690 

but<00:03:00.380> it'll<00:03:01.380> work

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.240 

we<00:03:05.420> cover<00:03:05.630> a<00:03:05.720> little<00:03:05.900> bit<00:03:06.080> further<00:03:06.349> off<00:03:06.590> now<00:03:06.950> I

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
we cover a little bit further off now I

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.270 
we cover a little bit further off now I
forgot<00:03:08.240> to<00:03:08.390> mention<00:03:08.540> this<00:03:08.900> it<00:03:09.860> has<00:03:10.010> a<00:03:10.040> little

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
forgot to mention this it has a little

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.979 
forgot to mention this it has a little
cable<00:03:10.760> lock<00:03:10.910> somebody's<00:03:11.690> a<00:03:11.750> little<00:03:11.900> bit

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
cable lock somebody's a little bit

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:14.440 
cable lock somebody's a little bit
harder<00:03:12.260> for<00:03:12.440> the<00:03:12.560> cover<00:03:13.520> to<00:03:13.670> be<00:03:13.700> stolen<00:03:14.209> number

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
harder for the cover to be stolen number

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.400 
harder for the cover to be stolen number
one<00:03:14.630> but<00:03:14.989> also<00:03:15.110> it<00:03:15.410> makes<00:03:15.560> it<00:03:15.709> so<00:03:15.920> that<00:03:15.950> the<00:03:17.410> the

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
one but also it makes it so that the the

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:19.780 
one but also it makes it so that the the
cover<00:03:18.620> can't<00:03:18.890> blow<00:03:19.069> off<00:03:19.099> in<00:03:19.430> a<00:03:19.489> really<00:03:19.580> big

cover can't blow off in a really big

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.160 
cover can't blow off in a really big
windstorm<00:03:20.209> you<00:03:20.480> know<00:03:21.310> so<00:03:22.310> anyway<00:03:22.580> I<00:03:22.870> don't<00:03:23.870> see

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170
