00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
them it's flat surfaces but they are

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.560 
them it's flat surfaces but they are
really<00:01:55.890> cheap<00:01:56.159> you<00:01:56.340> made<00:01:56.520> because<00:01:56.939> they<00:01:57.420> just

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
really cheap you made because they just

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.109 
really cheap you made because they just
don't<00:01:57.750> stick<00:01:58.079> basically<00:01:59.030> especially<00:02:00.030> on

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
don't stick basically especially on

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.270 
don't stick basically especially on
these<00:02:00.240> lights<00:02:00.509> Cindric<00:02:00.960> all<00:02:01.110> kind<00:02:01.740> of<00:02:01.829> shapes

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
these lights Cindric all kind of shapes

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.219 
these lights Cindric all kind of shapes
I<00:02:02.579> just<00:02:03.390> pop<00:02:03.659> right<00:02:03.689> up<00:02:03.979> and<00:02:05.899> you<00:02:06.899> know<00:02:06.990> try

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
I just pop right up and you know try

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.600 
I just pop right up and you know try
sticking<00:02:07.500> it<00:02:07.649> down<00:02:07.799> but<00:02:08.039> like<00:02:08.160> five<00:02:08.399> minutes

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
sticking it down but like five minutes

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.780 
sticking it down but like five minutes
later<00:02:08.879> it<00:02:09.090> comes<00:02:09.390> off<00:02:10.280> so<00:02:11.280> that's<00:02:11.400> a<00:02:11.580> bit<00:02:11.700> of<00:02:11.730> a

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
later it comes off so that's a bit of a

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.830 
later it comes off so that's a bit of a
problem<00:02:12.030> really

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
problem really

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.960 
problem really
but<00:02:13.860> other<00:02:14.860> than<00:02:14.980> that<00:02:15.040> it's<00:02:15.280> cool<00:02:15.490> it'll<00:02:15.700> set

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
but other than that it's cool it'll set

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.320 
but other than that it's cool it'll set
I<00:02:16.270> think<00:02:16.780> it<00:02:16.960> quite<00:02:17.140> a<00:02:17.200> lot<00:02:17.260> it's<00:02:17.650> um<00:02:18.330> it's

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
I think it quite a lot it's um it's

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.300 
I think it quite a lot it's um it's
about<00:02:19.650> 15<00:02:20.650> pounds<00:02:21.430> sterling<00:02:22.890> see<00:02:23.890> us<00:02:24.070> not<00:02:24.280> a

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
about 15 pounds sterling see us not a

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:30.690 
about 15 pounds sterling see us not a
way<00:02:24.520> essentially<00:02:25.180> a<00:02:25.360> currency<00:02:28.500> yeah<00:02:29.670> sure<00:02:30.670> I

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
way essentially a currency yeah sure I

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.480 
way essentially a currency yeah sure I
guess<00:02:31.230> but<00:02:32.230> stickers<00:02:33.010> and<00:02:33.160> let<00:02:33.250> it<00:02:33.280> down

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
guess but stickers and let it down

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.820 
guess but stickers and let it down
really<00:02:33.990> you<00:02:34.990> get<00:02:35.140> some<00:02:35.260> cool<00:02:35.440> little<00:02:35.650> bits
