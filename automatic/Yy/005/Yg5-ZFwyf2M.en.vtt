do so okay after much ado we have the
little<00:01:00.539> v-dub<00:01:00.870> in<00:01:01.109> here<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:02.449> there's<00:01:03.449> our

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
little v-dub in here and there's our

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.840 
little v-dub in here and there's our
starter<00:01:04.250> right<00:01:05.250> down<00:01:05.460> there<00:01:06.290> and<00:01:07.340> the<00:01:08.340> new<00:01:08.549> one

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
starter right down there and the new one

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.230 
starter right down there and the new one
is<00:01:09.470> right<00:01:10.470> here<00:01:10.979> now<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.610> reason<00:01:12.090> we're

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
is right here now the reason we're

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.920 
is right here now the reason we're
replacing<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.960> starter<00:01:13.229> is<00:01:13.880> because<00:01:14.930> the

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
replacing the starter is because the

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.990 
replacing the starter is because the
starter<00:01:16.350> was<00:01:16.470> getting<00:01:16.770> weak<00:01:16.950> wasn't<00:01:17.759> able<00:01:17.939> to

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
starter was getting weak wasn't able to

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.480 
starter was getting weak wasn't able to
crank<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.360> car<00:01:18.540> over<00:01:18.840> fast<00:01:19.080> enough<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:19.560> that

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
crank the car over fast enough and that

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.660 
crank the car over fast enough and that
is<00:01:20.850> why<00:01:21.470> the<00:01:22.470> other<00:01:22.619> day<00:01:22.890> when<00:01:23.159> I<00:01:23.189> had<00:01:23.430> it<00:01:23.580> in

connection<00:02:08.429> so<00:02:08.849> it's<00:02:09.030> got<00:02:09.179> to<00:02:09.270> be<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.420> starter

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
connection so it's got to be the starter

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.410 
connection so it's got to be the starter
so<00:02:10.709> I've<00:02:11.670> had<00:02:11.819> this<00:02:11.970> happen<00:02:12.180> before

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
so I've had this happen before

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.900 
so I've had this happen before
on<00:02:13.480> the<00:02:14.050> ax<00:02:14.319> and<00:02:14.500> a<00:02:14.590> 97<00:02:15.100> powerstroke<00:02:15.610> where<00:02:15.819> it

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
on the ax and a 97 powerstroke where it

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.610 
on the ax and a 97 powerstroke where it
cranked<00:02:16.270> it<00:02:16.330> over<00:02:16.630> but<00:02:17.020> it<00:02:17.170> wouldn't<00:02:17.380> start

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
cranked it over but it wouldn't start

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.170 
cranked it over but it wouldn't start
and<00:02:17.830> it<00:02:18.069> turns<00:02:18.340> out<00:02:18.520> it<00:02:18.670> was<00:02:18.760> just<00:02:18.790> not

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
and it turns out it was just not

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.570 
and it turns out it was just not
cranking<00:02:19.780> fast<00:02:20.020> enough<00:02:20.400> sometimes<00:02:21.400> that

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
cranking fast enough sometimes that

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.699 
cranking fast enough sometimes that
happens<00:02:21.760> had<00:02:22.240> it<00:02:22.360> happened<00:02:22.660> before<00:02:22.750> on<00:02:23.290> other

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
happens had it happened before on other

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:25.559 
happens had it happened before on other
vehicles<00:02:24.220> too<00:02:24.370> mostly<00:02:24.730> its<00:02:24.940> diesels<00:02:25.390> though

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
vehicles too mostly its diesels though

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.500 
vehicles too mostly its diesels though
that<00:02:26.230> that'll<00:02:26.560> happen<00:02:26.709> on<00:02:27.060> so<00:02:28.060> we're<00:02:28.330> going<00:02:28.420> to

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
get to into service apparently kind of

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.990 
get to into service apparently kind of
liked<00:02:55.780> it<00:02:55.810> it's<00:02:56.140> pretty<00:02:56.470> nice<00:02:56.680> on<00:02:57.000> the

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
liked it it's pretty nice on the

liked it it's pretty nice on the
converse<00:02:58.480> side<00:02:58.830> they've<00:02:59.830> got<00:03:00.070> the<00:03:00.220> starter

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
bolted to the motor mount so which just

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.380 
bolted to the motor mount so which just
seems<00:03:06.250> a<00:03:06.430> little<00:03:06.550> odd<00:03:07.180> to<00:03:07.660> me<00:03:07.690> I<00:03:07.840> guess<00:03:08.940> so<00:03:09.970> when

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
seems a little odd to me I guess so when

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.290 
seems a little odd to me I guess so when
let's<00:03:10.720> take<00:03:11.050> the<00:03:11.230> starter<00:03:11.680> out<00:03:12.120> the<00:03:13.120> whole

let's take the starter out the whole

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.570 
let's take the starter out the whole
motor<00:03:13.570> and<00:03:13.810> everything<00:03:14.140> went<00:03:14.320> hood<00:03:14.709> and<00:03:15.010> to

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
motor and everything went hood and to

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.160 
motor and everything went hood and to
start<00:03:15.790> falling<00:03:16.060> down<00:03:16.330> I'm<00:03:16.480> like<00:03:16.600> why<00:03:16.810> the<00:03:16.870> hell

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
start falling down I'm like why the hell

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.630

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:10.620 
the other crafts the wallet replacing

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.440 
the other crafts the wallet replacing
the<00:06:10.680> bushings<00:06:11.160> actually<00:06:11.670> got<00:06:11.850> bushing<00:06:12.300> in

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:12.450 
the bushings actually got bushing in

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:14.330 
the bushings actually got bushing in
there<00:06:12.660> you<00:06:13.350> got<00:06:13.560> to<00:06:13.680> replace<00:06:13.920> when<00:06:14.280> you

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:14.340 
there you got to replace when you

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:17.180 
there you got to replace when you
replace<00:06:14.790> the<00:06:14.970> starter<00:06:15.590> which<00:06:16.590> is<00:06:16.800> actually

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:17.190 
replace the starter which is actually

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:18.800 
replace the starter which is actually
kind<00:06:17.400> of<00:06:17.430> nice<00:06:17.610> because<00:06:17.880> in<00:06:18.180> theory<00:06:18.570> it<00:06:18.780> should

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:18.810 
kind of nice because in theory it should

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:21.110 
kind of nice because in theory it should
make<00:06:19.230> the<00:06:19.380> starter<00:06:19.740> last<00:06:19.980> longer<00:06:20.340> because<00:06:20.940> the

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 
make the starter last longer because the

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.970 
make the starter last longer because the
starter<00:06:21.510> is<00:06:21.600> not<00:06:21.810> free<00:06:22.200> floating<00:06:22.800> out<00:06:22.950> there

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:22.980 
starter is not free floating out there

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:25.250 
starter is not free floating out there
when<00:06:23.370> it<00:06:23.460> is<00:06:23.610> start<00:06:24.000> the<00:06:24.060> vehicle<00:06:24.570> it's

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:25.260 
when it is start the vehicle it's

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.890 
when it is start the vehicle it's
actually<00:06:25.770> doweled<00:06:26.280> into<00:06:26.670> a<00:06:26.700> bushing<00:06:27.450> which

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:27.900 
actually doweled into a bushing which

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:31.370 
actually doweled into a bushing which
holds<00:06:28.290> it<00:06:28.380> steady<00:06:28.560> and<00:06:29.010> still<00:06:29.330> so<00:06:30.380> there's

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:31.380 
holds it steady and still so there's

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:35.450 
holds it steady and still so there's
more<00:06:31.590> excellent<00:06:32.310> German<00:06:32.790> designing<00:06:33.890> so<00:06:34.890> until

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:35.460 
more excellent German designing so until

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:37.580 
more excellent German designing so until
next<00:06:35.670> time<00:06:36.060> I<00:06:36.330> think<00:06:36.450> that's<00:06:36.810> enough<00:06:37.170> prop

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:37.590 
next time I think that's enough prop

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:40.280 
next time I think that's enough prop
work<00:06:37.860> for<00:06:38.130> tonight
