attack where fires out three balls very
very<00:01:48.810> easy<00:01:49.020> to<00:01:49.200> dodge<00:01:49.350> I'm<00:01:50.130> just<00:01:50.399> quite

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
very easy to dodge I'm just quite

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.969 
very easy to dodge I'm just quite
quickly<00:01:50.820> clean<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.210> ads<00:01:51.329> because<00:01:51.570> i<00:01:51.979> often

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
quickly clean the ads because i often

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.830 
quickly clean the ads because i often
find<00:01:53.310> that<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.610> ads<00:01:53.729> kill<00:01:54.090> me<00:01:54.240> faster<00:01:54.689> than

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
find that the ads kill me faster than

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.200 
find that the ads kill me faster than
him<00:01:55.079> so<00:01:55.530> i<00:01:55.710> tend<00:01:56.340> to<00:01:56.460> take<00:01:56.549> out<00:01:56.729> those<00:01:56.850> stray

away<00:01:57.469> now<00:01:58.469> as<00:01:58.850> well<00:01:59.850> as<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.210> five<00:02:00.420> stacks<00:02:00.750> i

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
away now as well as the five stacks i

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.260 
away now as well as the five stacks i
have<00:02:01.229> about<00:02:01.500> thirty<00:02:02.280> percent<00:02:02.670> magic<00:02:03.030> find

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
have about thirty percent magic find

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.359 
have about thirty percent magic find
which<00:02:04.020> really<00:02:04.259> helps<00:02:04.680> this<00:02:04.799> run<00:02:05.040> for<00:02:05.070> me

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
which really helps this run for me
