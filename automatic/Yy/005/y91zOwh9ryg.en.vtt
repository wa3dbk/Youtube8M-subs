00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:18.200
 hello dear hungry i do not know how 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.540
 which was created was definitely 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.130
 recently contaminated several times 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:24.170
 wish for a banana cake 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.119
 it is now expressed with bananas 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:31.039
 cake is about the same as apple pie 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:32.029
 there are about 47 1328 7 recipes and 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:34.700
 I have just for this 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.920
 american style variant none 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.110
 Combinations of peanut and banal 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.540
 decided and the whole thing works 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.400
 also without baking and I say 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.649
 you also quite honest this cake 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.420
 It is more of a cake is now 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:50.500
 not necessarily a slimming recipe 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:55.160
 but it really tastes very delicious 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:57.710
 we need sugar cream for that 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.870
 I say gelatin or magazine 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.510
 then later some oil for the 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:06.460
 vanilla flavor or vanilla sugar 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:09.610
 milk peanut butter or peanut cream 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:12.920
 Lemon juice of course bananas 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:15.619
 bittersweet chocolate caramel biscuits 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.000
 very important though, if necessary too 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:20.659
 through speculation or butter biscuits 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.850
 mother can be replaced something 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:24.850
 coconut fat and cream cheese 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.820
 in a baking pan we give some 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.880
 drip oil and paint the floor 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.800
 thin so that a 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:42.800
 The caramel biscuits come in one 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.800
 Freezer bag this is closed 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:49.920
 and then the biscuits will be first end 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.800
 crushed something and then with 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.090
 the rolling pin are crumbled and here 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.580
 A little care is needed 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.670
 because there really should not be any bigger ones 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.660
 kick pieces more then be present 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.580
 otherwise the bottom of me can 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.870
 tear down relatively quickly and at 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.720
 It's not necessarily serving 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:09.360
 pleasant we liquefy the butter in 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.300
 a bowl that crumbled 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:16.680
 biscuits in thoroughly stir everything 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:19.550
 with each other and fill with this 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:23.690
 Now mix the bottom of the cake pan 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.690
 distribute everything evenly 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.220
 then press the ground firmly with your hand 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.870
 and give now the forum for 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.470
 at least half an hour in the 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.540
 fridge 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.120
 In the meantime, we take care of it 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:41.400
 the filling we first count the 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:43.170
 Bananas cut the little ones 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.569
 They left the bowl in a bowl 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.840
 add lemon juice and puree now as 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:49.860
 Bananas and my note 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.330
 regarding the use of gelatine 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.769
 or magazine 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.870
 There are some fruits with those 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:57.420
 gelatin light works that is at 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:00.650
 the plant based magazine is different 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:03.989
 the only exception is lemon juice 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.819
 klartext who agar agar or agad him 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:07.260
 wants to use on the 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:10.769
 refrain from lemon juice 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.750
 otherwise the latina uses to 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:16.459
 bananas pury is now fresh 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:22.950
 seen as well as the peanut cream 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:24.510
 the sugar and the vanilla aroma around now 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.140
 everything to a smooth mass 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.269
 to lose 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.910
 I take for the beginning the kneading hook 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:31.319
 and then the whisk only 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.139
 add the gelatin 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:36.150
 I use her gelatin immediately but 

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:39.540
 You can also leaf gelatin or just 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:42.350
 Use agra and everything again 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:45.269
 mix thoroughly 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:47.340
 since the ground is cool and 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:50.630
 is confirmed, we only admit it 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.630
 wider mass on it 

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:58.640
 and before we get to the finals 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.769
 everything must be shut down again 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.620
 and this time for at least two 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:06.170
 Hours longer is better and the 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.939
 Ideal case would be even over night then 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.459
 we prepare whipped cream quite normally 

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:12.560
 So give it to a suitable vessel 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:16.930
 I still give a pinch of salt 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.930
 stir stiff ryan the cream 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:23.449
 while at the end towards cream laid a huge 

00:04:21.439 --> 00:04:25.520
 leave and continue to open it was 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:27.759
 a nice solid received his mass 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.759
 to have 

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:33.550
 We now give these to the 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:39.169
 performed distribute them evenly 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:40.909
 smooth it out and I'm going to finish 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:46.759
 again and again with a troop lift 

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:48.110
 about it briefly introduce cool only times 

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:50.810
 and we are still preparing the 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:56.120
 chocolate sauce to spread the tender 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:59.780
 Bitter chocolate to coarse and give 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:05.180
 then in a pot cream the coconut fat 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:07.940
 and the chopped chocolate everything 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:11.110
 is heated and stirred under the 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.110
 melted chocolate 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.970
 then we take it from the stove and let it 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:19.160
 cool them down a bit 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:21.260
 in the meantime, we are dedicated to the 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.060
 karl may biscuits and have to first 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:25.780
 do nothing more than this something 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:28.490
 bigger pieces to break 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:31.040
 and when this is done, we bet 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:33.520
 from it on the pie little biscuit 

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.520
 bunch together 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:42.320
 twelve pieces so pie also twelve biscuits 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:44.660
 Cottage was my plan and above 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:46.300
 Now every two spoons of the 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:48.980
 give chocolate sauce 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.840
 The chocolate sauce can be left over 

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:52.670
 you then by the way with this virus with it 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:55.520
 put on the table so that I afterwards 

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:57.170
 everyone can take it and thus 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.880
 The daughter also finds her center 

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:01.070
 so let's also put in the middle of the 

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:04.460
 cookies and complement with again 

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:06.980
 chocolate sauce and now it is 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:08.420
 accomplished i know i know it 

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:11.000
 no cake one just happens 

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:12.350
 but that makes it so complicated and so does 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.420
 not again and when he first enters 

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:15.050
 you have eaten some of it 

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:18.110
 see 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:20.570
 the effort was worth it I wish 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:23.360
 Have fun preparing your meal 

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:25.330
 succeed and then they let you 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.800
 taste 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:30.380
 but if you prefer other troops 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:33.110
 maybe without baking 

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:36.140
 a Swedish apple pie or one 

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:38.230
 fruity mascarpone pie then looks 

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:40.880
 but just into these videos 

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:44.620
 you still have to say until the 

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:44.620
 Next time bye
