glitches<00:02:43.849> here<00:02:44.120> so<00:02:44.510> again

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
glitches here so again

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.170 
glitches here so again
Squarespace<00:02:45.319> is<00:02:45.650> not<00:02:45.799> perfect<00:02:46.189> so<00:02:46.400> instead<00:02:47.120> of

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
Squarespace is not perfect so instead of

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.420 
Squarespace is not perfect so instead of
redoing<00:02:47.569> this<00:02:47.780> I'm<00:02:47.900> going<00:02:48.019> to<00:02:48.079> show<00:02:48.290> you<00:02:48.319> a<00:02:48.829> way

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
redoing this I'm going to show you a way

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.160 
redoing this I'm going to show you a way
to<00:02:49.489> just<00:02:49.639> kind<00:02:49.760> of<00:02:49.790> get<00:02:49.879> around<00:02:50.090> this<00:02:50.269> so<00:02:51.109> I'm

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
to just kind of get around this so I'm

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.239 
to just kind of get around this so I'm
assuming<00:02:51.349> there's<00:02:51.620> some<00:02:51.769> sort<00:02:51.950> of<00:02:52.040> glitch

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:52.249 
assuming there's some sort of glitch

00:02:52.249 --> 00:02:53.709 
assuming there's some sort of glitch
with<00:02:52.459> the<00:02:52.489> syncing<00:02:52.939> so<00:02:53.299> what<00:02:53.389> I'm<00:02:53.450> going<00:02:53.569> to<00:02:53.629> do

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:53.719 
with the syncing so what I'm going to do

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:57.970 
with the syncing so what I'm going to do
is<00:02:53.810> I'm<00:02:53.870> going<00:02:53.959> to<00:02:54.019> save<00:02:54.260> the<00:02:54.439> page<00:02:54.650> and<00:02:56.980> then

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
is I'm going to save the page and then

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:11.380 
is I'm going to save the page and then
I'm<00:02:58.069> going<00:02:58.189> to<00:02:58.250> hit<00:02:58.430> reload<00:02:58.879> up<00:02:59.120> here<00:03:03.670> and

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.110

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
let's see up there we go and now that we

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.870 
let's see up there we go and now that we
saved<00:03:15.630> and<00:03:15.900> reloaded<00:03:16.290> the<00:03:16.350> page<00:03:16.380> it<00:03:17.070> is<00:03:17.130> fixed

here to this design section and here you

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.030 
here to this design section and here you
actually<00:03:51.090> have<00:03:51.300> a<00:03:51.930> handful<00:03:52.440> of<00:03:52.470> ways<00:03:52.710> you<00:03:52.920> can

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
actually have a handful of ways you can

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.700 
actually have a handful of ways you can
present<00:03:53.430> this<00:03:53.840> so<00:03:54.840> right<00:03:55.200> now<00:03:55.320> it's<00:03:55.530> in<00:03:55.590> a

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:55.710 
present this so right now it's in a

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:58.880 
present this so right now it's in a
slideshow<00:03:55.980> format<00:03:57.110> but<00:03:58.110> we<00:03:58.350> could<00:03:58.500> also<00:03:58.620> make

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
slideshow format but we could also make

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.660 
slideshow format but we could also make
it<00:03:58.950> a<00:03:59.190> slider<00:04:00.830> which<00:04:01.830> slider<00:04:02.130> similar<00:04:02.550> to

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
it a slider which slider similar to

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.130 
it a slider which slider similar to
slideshow<00:04:03.090> but<00:04:03.330> you<00:04:03.480> actually<00:04:03.870> kind<00:04:03.990> of

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
slideshow but you actually kind of

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.270 
slideshow but you actually kind of
scroll<00:04:04.910> you<00:04:05.910> scroll<00:04:06.270> to<00:04:06.570> the<00:04:06.720> right<00:04:06.750> and<00:04:07.280> kind

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
scroll you scroll to the right and kind

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.700 
scroll you scroll to the right and kind
of<00:04:08.400> go<00:04:08.520> through<00:04:08.550> photos<00:04:09.000> that<00:04:09.120> way<00:04:09.560> you<00:04:10.560> can

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:10.710 
of go through photos that way you can

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:14.000 
of go through photos that way you can
make<00:04:10.860> it<00:04:10.950> a<00:04:11.010> grid<00:04:11.370> and<00:04:12.560> then<00:04:13.560> you<00:04:13.710> have<00:04:13.830> some

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
make it a grid and then you have some

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.400 
make it a grid and then you have some
options<00:04:14.220> here<00:04:14.489> that<00:04:15.000> appear<00:04:15.390> to<00:04:15.959> choose<00:04:16.200> how

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
options here that appear to choose how

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.060 
options here that appear to choose how
you<00:04:16.500> want<00:04:16.770> that<00:04:16.890> grid<00:04:17.130> layout<00:04:17.400> to<00:04:17.580> be<00:04:18.080> or<00:04:19.080> we

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
you want that grid layout to be or we

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.010 
you want that grid layout to be or we
can<00:04:20.220> stack<00:04:20.549> them<00:04:20.790> and<00:04:21.180> if<00:04:21.450> you<00:04:21.570> do<00:04:21.660> a<00:04:21.690> stacked

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:22.020 
can stack them and if you do a stacked

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:23.390 
can stack them and if you do a stacked
then<00:04:22.320> they're<00:04:22.440> basically<00:04:22.710> vertically<00:04:23.220> going

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
then they're basically vertically going

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.010 
then they're basically vertically going
to<00:04:23.460> stack<00:04:23.730> on<00:04:23.910> top<00:04:23.940> of<00:04:24.120> each<00:04:24.300> other<00:04:26.030> and<00:04:27.030> so

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
to stack on top of each other and so

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.120 
to stack on top of each other and so
