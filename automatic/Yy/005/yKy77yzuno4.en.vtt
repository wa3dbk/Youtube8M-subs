00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
notice that I mean this camera picks up

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.660 
notice that I mean this camera picks up
a<00:01:14.640> lot<00:01:14.969> of<00:01:15.270> detail<00:01:15.689> just<00:01:15.990> like<00:01:16.859> my<00:01:17.130> hands<00:01:17.579> and

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
a lot of detail just like my hands and

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.190 
a lot of detail just like my hands and
makes<00:01:17.820> them<00:01:17.939> look<00:01:18.060> all<00:01:18.179> wrinkly<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:18.899> they're

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
makes them look all wrinkly and they're

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.399 
makes them look all wrinkly and they're
actually<00:01:19.409> not<00:01:20.450> far<00:01:21.450> away<00:01:21.569> I<00:01:21.960> mean<00:01:22.140> they<00:01:22.259> look

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
actually not far away I mean they look

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:30.410 
actually not far away I mean they look
pretty<00:01:22.829> normal<00:01:23.600> up<00:01:24.600> close<00:01:28.670> there<00:01:29.670> we<00:01:29.789> go

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
pretty normal up close there we go

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:37.999 
pretty normal up close there we go
but<00:01:31.350> there's<00:01:31.920> Hot<00:01:32.130> Wheels<00:01:35.240> championed<00:01:37.009> pretty

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
but there's Hot Wheels championed pretty

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.889 
but there's Hot Wheels championed pretty
nice<00:01:38.219> detail<00:01:38.579> there<00:01:38.789> again<00:01:39.270> this<00:01:39.450> camera<00:01:39.749> just

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:39.899 
nice detail there again this camera just

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:43.010 
nice detail there again this camera just
picks<00:01:40.109> up<00:01:40.289> all<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:41.369> things<00:01:42.179> that<00:01:42.420> it<00:01:42.539> you

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
picks up all the things that it you

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.429

cannot<00:01:43.380> see<00:01:44.149> there's<00:01:45.149> a<00:01:45.240> 66<00:01:45.810> whose<00:01:46.020> are<00:01:46.259> there

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
cannot see there's a 66 whose are there

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.649 
cannot see there's a 66 whose are there
the<00:01:47.310> back<00:01:47.490> again<00:01:47.850> it'll<00:01:48.060> expect<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.479> lot<00:01:48.630> of

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
the back again it'll expect a lot of

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.949 
the back again it'll expect a lot of
detail<00:01:48.749> because<00:01:49.229> it<00:01:49.409> is<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:49.560> race<00:01:49.889> car<00:01:50.869> and<00:01:51.869> you

00:01:51.949 --> 00:01:51.959 
detail because it is a race car and you

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:54.109 
detail because it is a race car and you
do<00:01:52.079> have<00:01:52.289> got<00:01:52.979> red<00:01:53.159> interior<00:01:53.490> but<00:01:53.729> you<00:01:53.880> notice

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
do have got red interior but you notice

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.929 
do have got red interior but you notice
you<00:01:54.240> do<00:01:54.450> have<00:01:54.770> part<00:01:55.770> of<00:01:55.829> a<00:01:55.889> roll<00:01:56.069> bar<00:01:56.280> I<00:01:56.609> don't

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
you do have part of a roll bar I don't

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.849 
you do have part of a roll bar I don't
know<00:01:56.999> if<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.209> full<00:01:57.420> Katie's<00:01:57.840> in<00:01:58.139> a<00:01:58.170> second<00:01:58.590> I

00:01:58.849 --> 00:01:58.859 
know if the full Katie's in a second I

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:00.019 
know if the full Katie's in a second I
think<00:01:59.189> it<00:01:59.340> goes<00:01:59.459> to<00:01:59.609> the<00:01:59.700> front

00:02:00.019 --> 00:02:00.029 
think it goes to the front

00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:03.190 
think it goes to the front
yes<00:02:00.179> so<00:02:00.479> it's<00:02:00.600> got<00:02:00.719> a<00:02:00.749> full<00:02:00.959> cage<00:02:01.759> top

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
yes so it's got a full cage top

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.969 
yes so it's got a full cage top
everything<00:02:04.200> on<00:02:04.409> this<00:02:04.529> one<00:02:04.679> looks<00:02:04.889> pretty

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
everything on this one looks pretty

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.919 
everything on this one looks pretty
pretty<00:02:05.579> straight<00:02:05.909> as<00:02:06.060> far<00:02:06.240> as<00:02:06.329> tan<00:02:06.509> pose<00:02:06.719> or

00:02:06.919 --> 00:02:06.929 
pretty straight as far as tan pose or

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:10.309 
pretty straight as far as tan pose or
concerns<00:02:07.289> and<00:02:08.250> see<00:02:09.119> that<00:02:09.360> you<00:02:09.720> get<00:02:09.840> real<00:02:10.080> close

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
concerns and see that you get real close

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.550 
concerns and see that you get real close
there's<00:02:11.220> that<00:02:11.370> pain<00:02:11.640> again

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
there's that pain again

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:25.670 
there's that pain again
go<00:02:14.560> ahead<00:02:14.860> and<00:02:14.950> with<00:02:15.040> that<00:02:15.220> spin<00:02:15.760> up<00:02:15.940> there

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.420 

again<00:02:26.680> that's<00:02:26.800> probably<00:02:27.190> my<00:02:27.520> favorite<00:02:28.030> one

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
again that's probably my favorite one

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.890 
again that's probably my favorite one
I'm<00:02:30.430> probably<00:02:30.610> gonna<00:02:30.820> do<00:02:30.970> my<00:02:31.090> least<00:02:31.390> favorite

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900

I'm probably gonna do my least favorite
last<00:02:32.140> actually<00:02:32.650> I<00:02:32.680> probably<00:02:32.860> should<00:02:33.100> have<00:02:33.130> did

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
last actually I probably should have did

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.080 
last actually I probably should have did
this<00:02:33.400> one<00:02:33.610> first

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.600 
this one first
it's<00:02:34.660> in<00:02:34.810> a<00:02:34.840> long<00:02:35.080> gone<00:02:35.350> then<00:02:36.010> the<00:02:36.040> oil<00:02:36.160> zoom

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
it's in a long gone then the oil zoom

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.270 
it's in a long gone then the oil zoom
all<00:02:36.790> gone<00:02:37.710> decent<00:02:38.710> our<00:02:38.770> favorite<00:02:39.130> to<00:02:39.250> least

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
all gone decent our favorite to least

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:46.620 
all gone decent our favorite to least
favorite<00:02:44.520> but<00:02:45.520> I<00:02:45.550> really<00:02:45.880> like<00:02:46.030> the<00:02:46.180> stance<00:02:46.420> on

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
favorite but I really like the stance on

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:47.760 
favorite but I really like the stance on
that<00:02:46.780> I'm<00:02:46.870> gonna<00:02:46.990> like<00:02:47.170> everything<00:02:47.500> about

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
that I'm gonna like everything about

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:52.950 
that I'm gonna like everything about
that<00:02:47.830> one<00:02:51.450> looks<00:02:52.450> like<00:02:52.480> we<00:02:52.660> got<00:02:52.780> a<00:02:52.810> little

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:52.960 
that one looks like we got a little

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.670 
that one looks like we got a little
scuff<00:02:53.350> from<00:02:53.620> the<00:02:53.710> packaging<00:02:54.280> on<00:02:54.610> oops<00:02:55.390> on<00:02:56.200> the

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
scuff from the packaging on oops on the

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.030 
scuff from the packaging on oops on the
other<00:02:56.830> side<00:02:57.130> there<00:02:58.050> probably<00:02:59.050> see<00:02:59.230> that<00:02:59.410> it

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
other side there probably see that it

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.970 
other side there probably see that it
could<00:03:00.220> just<00:03:00.370> be<00:03:00.580> a<00:03:00.610> smudge<00:03:01.500> dirt<00:03:02.500> but<00:03:02.740> I<00:03:02.770> think

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
could just be a smudge dirt but I think

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.400 
could just be a smudge dirt but I think
it's<00:03:03.070> from<00:03:03.480> that<00:03:04.480> matte<00:03:04.750> finish<00:03:05.140> it<00:03:05.260> gets

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
it's from that matte finish it gets

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.530 
it's from that matte finish it gets
stretched<00:03:06.160> pretty<00:03:06.490> easily<00:03:06.760> so<00:03:09.210> that<00:03:10.210> will<00:03:10.360> do

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
stretched pretty easily so that will do

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.060 
stretched pretty easily so that will do
it<00:03:10.690> if<00:03:11.020> you<00:03:11.110> have<00:03:11.260> any<00:03:11.410> questions<00:03:11.770> or<00:03:11.890> comments
