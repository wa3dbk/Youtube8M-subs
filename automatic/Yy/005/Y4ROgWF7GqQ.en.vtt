00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:29.270 
has your score but say I had diagonal it

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.510 
has your score but say I had diagonal it
would<00:05:29.450> drop<00:05:29.720> them<00:05:29.990> out<00:05:30.140> and<00:05:30.410> the<00:05:30.770> other<00:05:31.040> box<00:05:31.280> on

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 
would drop them out and the other box on

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.150 
would drop them out and the other box on
top<00:05:31.550> would<00:05:31.850> drop<00:05:32.180> in<00:05:32.450> so<00:05:32.870> they<00:05:33.230> could<00:05:33.620> get<00:05:33.830> a

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:34.160 
top would drop in so they could get a

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.760 
top would drop in so they could get a
point<00:05:34.730> from<00:05:35.120> my<00:05:35.510> point<00:05:35.810> which<00:05:36.110> is<00:05:36.350> kind<00:05:36.710> of

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:36.770 
point from my point which is kind of

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:38.680 
point from my point which is kind of
annoying<00:05:36.950> but<00:05:37.400> it<00:05:37.580> does<00:05:37.850> add<00:05:37.880> an<00:05:38.240> extra

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:38.690 
annoying but it does add an extra

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:41.050 
annoying but it does add an extra
feature<00:05:38.960> to<00:05:39.380> the<00:05:39.500> game<00:05:39.680> which<00:05:40.430> I<00:05:40.550> find<00:05:40.760> cool

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:41.060 
feature to the game which I find cool

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:43.780 
feature to the game which I find cool
like<00:05:41.620> makes<00:05:42.620> it<00:05:42.800> a<00:05:42.860> bit<00:05:43.040> different<00:05:43.460> from<00:05:43.520> the

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:43.790 
like makes it a bit different from the

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:47.380 
like makes it a bit different from the
normal<00:05:44.150> connect<00:05:44.570> four<00:05:45.670> okay<00:05:46.670> so<00:05:46.760> pretty

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:47.390 
normal connect four okay so pretty

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:49.960 
normal connect four okay so pretty
simple<00:05:47.780> gameplay<00:05:47.990> but<00:05:48.650> like<00:05:49.070> I<00:05:49.220> say<00:05:49.460> really

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:49.970
