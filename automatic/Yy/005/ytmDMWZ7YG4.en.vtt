to<00:01:42.670> three<00:01:43.090> minutes<00:01:43.500> it<00:01:44.500> could<00:01:44.920> be<00:01:45.070> shorter<00:01:45.430> a

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
to three minutes it could be shorter a

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.280 
to three minutes it could be shorter a
town<00:01:46.479> that<00:01:46.509> takes<00:01:46.840> about<00:01:46.990> two<00:01:47.140> to<00:01:47.170> three

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
town that takes about two to three

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:55.100 
town that takes about two to three
minutes<00:01:48.300> so<00:01:49.300> I'll<00:01:49.600> just<00:01:49.659> beat<00:01:49.900> this<00:01:49.990> part<00:01:50.170> up

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.020 

and<00:01:56.110> there<00:01:56.380> we<00:01:56.500> have<00:01:56.530> it<00:01:56.729> since<00:01:57.729> it<00:01:57.820> took

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
and there we have it since it took

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.529 
and there we have it since it took
almost<00:01:58.210> forever<00:01:58.450> turn<00:01:58.990> 19<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:01.000> I<00:02:01.270> guess<00:02:01.390> it<00:02:01.509> is

00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:01.539 
almost forever turn 19 and I guess it is

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:03.060 
almost forever turn 19 and I guess it is
not<00:02:01.750> 23<00:02:02.080> minutes<00:02:02.380> I'm<00:02:02.619> pretty<00:02:02.800> sure<00:02:03.009> it

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
not 23 minutes I'm pretty sure it

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:04.469 
not 23 minutes I'm pretty sure it
depends<00:02:03.310> on<00:02:03.399> how<00:02:03.520> fast<00:02:03.670> computers<00:02:04.210> as<00:02:04.450> well

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 
depends on how fast computers as well

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:06.029 
depends on how fast computers as well
the<00:02:04.750> server<00:02:04.960> you're<00:02:05.200> on<00:02:05.320> if<00:02:05.530> you're<00:02:05.740> doing<00:02:05.920> all

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:06.039 
the server you're on if you're doing all

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:07.800 
the server you're on if you're doing all
server<00:02:06.399> but<00:02:07.000> yeah<00:02:07.119> this<00:02:07.240> is<00:02:07.390> fully<00:02:07.570> functional

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810
