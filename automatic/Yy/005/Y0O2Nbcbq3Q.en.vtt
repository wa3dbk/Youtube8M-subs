00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.819 

I'm<00:00:00.630> just<00:00:00.810> gonna<00:00:00.930> run<00:00:01.170> through<00:00:01.410> some<00:00:01.589> of<00:00:01.650> the

00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:01.829 
I'm just gonna run through some of the

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:03.619 
I'm just gonna run through some of the
new<00:00:02.010> modeling<00:00:02.399> changes<00:00:02.879> in<00:00:03.060> cinema<00:00:03.389> 4d

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
new modeling changes in cinema 4d

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:06.490 
new modeling changes in cinema 4d
version<00:00:04.110> 15<00:00:04.640> so<00:00:05.640> the<00:00:05.700> first<00:00:05.940> changes

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:06.500 
version 15 so the first changes

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.960 
version 15 so the first changes
hypernurbs<00:00:07.500> is<00:00:07.620> now<00:00:07.770> called<00:00:08.130> subdivision

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
hypernurbs is now called subdivision

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.390 
hypernurbs is now called subdivision
surfaces<00:00:09.420> because<00:00:10.260> basically<00:00:10.920> this<00:00:11.070> is<00:00:11.280> the

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
surfaces because basically this is the

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.180 
surfaces because basically this is the
industry<00:00:11.700> standard<00:00:11.849> word<00:00:12.450> also<00:00:13.440> you'll

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
industry standard word also you'll

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.919 
industry standard word also you'll
notice<00:00:14.400> that<00:00:14.759> the<00:00:14.910> word<00:00:15.030> NURBS<00:00:15.420> has<00:00:15.750> been

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
notice that the word NURBS has been

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.870 
notice that the word NURBS has been
removed<00:00:16.230> from<00:00:16.650> the<00:00:16.830> end<00:00:16.949> of<00:00:17.070> these<00:00:17.279> operations

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
removed from the end of these operations

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.510 
removed from the end of these operations
here<00:00:18.119> so<00:00:18.900> extrude<00:00:19.410> NURBS<00:00:19.439> is<00:00:19.830> now<00:00:20.010> just<00:00:20.220> simply

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
here so extrude NURBS is now just simply

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.540 
here so extrude NURBS is now just simply
called<00:00:20.730> extrude<00:00:21.180> a<00:00:22.020> great<00:00:22.830> addition<00:00:23.310> to<00:00:23.340> the

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
called extrude a great addition to the

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.000 
called extrude a great addition to the
modeling<00:00:23.880> tools<00:00:24.119> is<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.600> bevel<00:00:24.930> tool<00:00:25.140> and<00:00:25.380> the

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
modeling tools is the bevel tool and the

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.120 
modeling tools is the bevel tool and the
bevel<00:00:26.310> tools<00:00:26.519> been<00:00:26.760> completely<00:00:27.150> rewritten<00:00:28.130> so

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
bevel tools been completely rewritten so

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.500 
bevel tools been completely rewritten so
I'm<00:00:29.279> just<00:00:29.400> going<00:00:29.519> to<00:00:29.609> select<00:00:29.789> this<00:00:29.939> cube<00:00:30.269> and

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
I'm just going to select this cube and

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.170 
I'm just going to select this cube and
convert<00:00:30.960> it<00:00:31.140> to<00:00:31.170> an<00:00:31.349> editable<00:00:31.439> object<00:00:32.180> like

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
convert it to an editable object like

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.330 
convert it to an editable object like
this<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:33.920> I'm<00:00:34.920> gonna<00:00:35.100> go<00:00:35.280> into<00:00:35.550> line<00:00:35.820> mode<00:00:36.120> and

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
this and I'm gonna go into line mode and

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.069 
this and I'm gonna go into line mode and
I'm<00:00:38.340> just<00:00:38.489> gonna<00:00:38.579> select<00:00:38.790> all<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.390> edges<00:00:39.540> so

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
I'm just gonna select all the edges so

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.630 
I'm just gonna select all the edges so
I'm<00:00:40.170> just<00:00:40.290> going<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.530> turn<00:00:40.649> off<00:00:40.860> only<00:00:41.340> select

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
I'm just going to turn off only select

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.520 
I'm just going to turn off only select
visible<00:00:42.059> elements<00:00:42.510> so<00:00:42.750> it<00:00:42.870> says<00:00:43.079> select<00:00:43.290> in

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
visible elements so it says select in

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.610 
visible elements so it says select in
the<00:00:43.620> back<00:00:43.800> faces<00:00:44.219> as<00:00:44.370> well<00:00:45.200> so<00:00:46.200> that's<00:00:46.320> all<00:00:46.530> the

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
the back faces as well so that's all the

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.410 
the back faces as well so that's all the
edges<00:00:46.890> selected<00:00:47.010> now<00:00:47.940> I'm<00:00:48.030> going<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.239> right

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
edges selected now I'm going to right

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.380 
edges selected now I'm going to right
click<00:00:48.629> and<00:00:48.690> go<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:48.960> bevel<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:50.059> you'll<00:00:51.059> notice

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
click and go to bevel and you'll notice

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.170 
click and go to bevel and you'll notice
now<00:00:51.570> we've<00:00:51.750> got<00:00:51.899> these<00:00:51.989> control<00:00:52.410> handles

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180 
now we've got these control handles

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.130 
now we've got these control handles
whoops<00:00:54.180> I've<00:00:55.640> enabled<00:00:56.640> snapping<00:00:57.329> so<00:00:57.930> I'm<00:00:57.989> just

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
whoops I've enabled snapping so I'm just

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.380 
whoops I've enabled snapping so I'm just
going<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.289> turn<00:00:58.440> that<00:00:58.590> off<00:00:58.730> so<00:00:59.730> if<00:01:00.000> I<00:01:00.120> pull<00:01:00.359> on

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
going to turn that off so if I pull on

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.299 
going to turn that off so if I pull on
this<00:01:00.510> control<00:01:01.199> handle<00:01:01.559> I<00:01:01.859> can<00:01:02.039> basically

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
this control handle I can basically

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.539 
this control handle I can basically
adjust<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.030> amount<00:01:03.420> of<00:01:03.539> bevel<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:04.549> you'll

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
adjust the amount of bevel and you'll

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.480 
adjust the amount of bevel and you'll
notice<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.030> slider<00:01:06.330> reacting<00:01:07.200> over<00:01:07.439> here<00:01:08.299> and

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
notice the slider reacting over here and

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.539 
notice the slider reacting over here and
once<00:01:11.490> I'm<00:01:11.640> happy<00:01:11.909> with<00:01:12.030> my<00:01:12.210> bevel<00:01:12.420> I<00:01:13.400> can<00:01:14.400> add

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
once I'm happy with my bevel I can add

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.649 
once I'm happy with my bevel I can add
some<00:01:14.909> further<00:01:15.180> subdivisions<00:01:17.420> like<00:01:18.420> this

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
some further subdivisions like this

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:25.539 
some further subdivisions like this
which<00:01:19.439> is<00:01:19.590> really<00:01:19.860> cool<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:22.909> I<00:01:24.259> can<00:01:25.259> also

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:25.549 
which is really cool and I can also

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:32.300 
which is really cool and I can also
define<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:27.229> curvature<00:01:28.229> of<00:01:28.290> this<00:01:28.590> bevel<00:01:31.310> using

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
define the curvature of this bevel using

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.420 
define the curvature of this bevel using
a<00:01:32.369> curve<00:01:33.290> but<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.470> better<00:01:34.650> illustrate<00:01:34.979> this

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
a curve but to better illustrate this

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.130 
a curve but to better illustrate this
I'm<00:01:35.640> going<00:01:35.759> to<00:01:35.820> go<00:01:35.939> over<00:01:35.970> to<00:01:36.270> my<00:01:36.299> wall<00:01:36.689> object

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
I'm going to go over to my wall object

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.660 
I'm going to go over to my wall object
here<00:01:39.290> so<00:01:40.290> this<00:01:40.439> is<00:01:40.590> my<00:01:40.740> wall<00:01:40.979> object<00:01:41.400> which<00:01:41.579> I

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
here so this is my wall object which I

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.670 
here so this is my wall object which I
created<00:01:42.150> quickly<00:01:42.360> it's<00:01:43.079> just<00:01:43.140> like<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:43.409> simple

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
created quickly it's just like a simple

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.010 
created quickly it's just like a simple
corner<00:01:44.369> section<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:44.909> I'm<00:01:45.720> going<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:45.899> select

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
corner section and I'm going to select

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.740 
corner section and I'm going to select
these<00:01:46.290> two<00:01:46.560> edges<00:01:46.860> here<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:47.570> I'm<00:01:48.570> going<00:01:48.659> to

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
these two edges here and I'm going to

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.760 
these two edges here and I'm going to
right<00:01:48.930> click<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.439> go<00:01:49.470> to<00:01:49.590> bevel<00:01:50.329> and<00:01:51.680> I'm<00:01:52.680> just

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
right click and go to bevel and I'm just

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.039 
right click and go to bevel and I'm just
going<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:52.979> pull<00:01:53.220> my<00:01:53.340> bevel<00:01:53.579> out<00:01:53.880> slightly<00:01:54.210> to

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
going to pull my bevel out slightly to

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.190 
going to pull my bevel out slightly to
get<00:01:55.200> a<00:01:55.229> corner<00:01:56.149> so<00:01:57.149> basically<00:01:57.450> it's<00:01:57.750> instead

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
get a corner so basically it's instead

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.959 
get a corner so basically it's instead
of<00:01:58.290> going<00:01:58.560> with<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.860> default<00:01:59.070> option<00:01:59.640> here

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
of going with the default option here

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.420 
of going with the default option here
which<00:02:00.540> is<00:02:00.719> a<00:02:01.170> really<00:02:01.829> good<00:02:01.979> rounding

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
which is a really good rounding

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.530 
which is a really good rounding
basically<00:02:02.880> you<00:02:03.750> can<00:02:03.899> choose<00:02:04.110> your<00:02:04.259> own<00:02:05.540> custom

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
basically you can choose your own custom

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.469 
basically you can choose your own custom
curvature<00:02:07.079> if<00:02:08.009> you<00:02:08.129> go<00:02:08.220> to<00:02:08.280> user<00:02:08.610> and<00:02:09.149> then<00:02:09.390> we

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
curvature if you go to user and then we

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.240 
curvature if you go to user and then we
can<00:02:09.629> basically<00:02:09.720> edit<00:02:10.200> this<00:02:10.289> curve

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
can basically edit this curve

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:18.960 
can basically edit this curve
and<00:02:12.900> define<00:02:13.900> this<00:02:14.080> cross-section<00:02:17.730> like<00:02:18.730> that

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
and define this cross-section like that

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.030 
and define this cross-section like that
and<00:02:19.210> if<00:02:19.570> you<00:02:19.690> hold<00:02:20.080> down<00:02:20.230> control<00:02:20.650> and<00:02:20.830> click

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
and if you hold down control and click

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.240 
and if you hold down control and click
you<00:02:21.220> can<00:02:21.280> add<00:02:21.490> another<00:02:21.760> point<00:02:22.210> here<00:02:23.250> but

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
you can add another point here but

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.310 
you can add another point here but
obviously<00:02:25.180> now<00:02:25.420> I<00:02:25.450> need<00:02:25.780> more<00:02:25.960> subdivisions

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
obviously now I need more subdivisions

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.680 
obviously now I need more subdivisions
so<00:02:27.010> I'm<00:02:27.070> just<00:02:27.190> going<00:02:27.340> to<00:02:27.400> increase<00:02:27.700> those<00:02:27.910> and

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
so I'm just going to increase those and

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:35.040 
so I'm just going to increase those and
now<00:02:28.870> we<00:02:28.930> can<00:02:29.170> see<00:02:29.320> the<00:02:29.440> curve<00:02:33.240> and<00:02:34.240> I'm<00:02:34.930> just

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
now we can see the curve and I'm just

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.010 
now we can see the curve and I'm just
going<00:02:35.170> to<00:02:35.260> scale<00:02:35.470> this<00:02:35.650> up<00:02:36.600> now<00:02:37.600> you'll<00:02:37.810> notice

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
going to scale this up now you'll notice

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.180 
going to scale this up now you'll notice
that<00:02:38.380> this<00:02:39.220> can<00:02:39.760> go<00:02:39.910> beyond<00:02:40.180> the<00:02:40.300> limits<00:02:40.630> so<00:02:41.560> if

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
that this can go beyond the limits so if

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:43.440 
that this can go beyond the limits so if
you<00:02:42.340> don't<00:02:42.520> want<00:02:42.670> it<00:02:42.730> to<00:02:42.850> do<00:02:42.970> this<00:02:43.150> you<00:02:43.300> can

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
you don't want it to do this you can

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.020 
you don't want it to do this you can
basically<00:02:43.630> select<00:02:44.200> limit<00:02:44.470> here<00:02:44.830> and<00:02:45.030> then

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
basically select limit here and then

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.830 
basically select limit here and then
that<00:02:46.209> way<00:02:47.070> it<00:02:48.070> can<00:02:48.310> only<00:02:48.430> go<00:02:49.060> so<00:02:49.090> far

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
that way it can only go so far

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.540 
that way it can only go so far
it<00:02:49.959> can't<00:02:50.200> go<00:02:50.350> beyond<00:02:50.680> the<00:02:50.860> edges<00:02:53.520> which<00:02:54.520> is

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
it can't go beyond the edges which is

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.050 
it can't go beyond the edges which is
quite<00:02:54.850> useful<00:02:55.000> as<00:02:55.300> well

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
quite useful as well

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.120 
quite useful as well
and<00:02:58.060> we<00:02:58.180> can<00:02:58.300> even<00:02:58.420> define<00:02:58.840> a<00:02:58.870> spline<00:02:59.260> foot<00:02:59.920> for

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
and we can even define a spline foot for

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.650 
and we can even define a spline foot for
this<00:03:00.220> profile<00:03:00.700> here<00:03:00.970> so<00:03:01.330> if<00:03:01.420> you<00:03:01.510> go<00:03:01.600> to

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
this profile here so if you go to

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.160 
this profile here so if you go to
profile<00:03:02.200> and<00:03:03.480> I'm<00:03:04.480> just<00:03:04.660> going<00:03:04.780> to<00:03:04.810> create<00:03:05.140> a

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
profile and I'm just going to create a

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.890 
profile and I'm just going to create a
quick<00:03:05.650> spline<00:03:06.040> in<00:03:06.220> the<00:03:06.310> front<00:03:06.580> view<00:03:07.590> here<00:03:09.900> I'll

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
quick spline in the front view here I'll

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.780 
quick spline in the front view here I'll
just<00:03:10.959> do<00:03:11.260> something<00:03:11.470> freehand<00:03:12.480> like<00:03:13.480> that<00:03:14.790> so

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
just do something freehand like that so

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.070 
just do something freehand like that so
because<00:03:16.090> I<00:03:16.209> accidentally<00:03:16.660> clicked<00:03:16.930> away

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
because I accidentally clicked away

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.900 
because I accidentally clicked away
basically<00:03:17.769> the<00:03:17.890> bevel<00:03:18.190> operation<00:03:18.700> is<00:03:18.790> now

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
basically the bevel operation is now

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.030 
basically the bevel operation is now
committed<00:03:19.420> it's<00:03:19.810> basically<00:03:20.110> destructive<00:03:20.800> so

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
committed it's basically destructive so

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.570 
committed it's basically destructive so
once<00:03:21.310> you<00:03:22.500> once<00:03:23.500> you're<00:03:23.680> gonna<00:03:23.769> click<00:03:24.100> away<00:03:24.250> or

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
once you once you're gonna click away or

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.120 
once you once you're gonna click away or
hit<00:03:24.760> ok<00:03:25.150> that's<00:03:25.510> it<00:03:25.750> and<00:03:25.959> you<00:03:26.380> have<00:03:26.530> to<00:03:26.650> undo<00:03:26.950> to

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
hit ok that's it and you have to undo to

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.190 
hit ok that's it and you have to undo to
go<00:03:27.220> back<00:03:28.110> which<00:03:29.110> can<00:03:29.290> be<00:03:29.380> quite<00:03:29.530> frustrating

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
go back which can be quite frustrating

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.449 
go back which can be quite frustrating
so<00:03:32.200> I'm<00:03:32.470> just<00:03:32.590> gonna<00:03:32.709> select<00:03:32.860> those<00:03:33.100> edges

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
so I'm just gonna select those edges

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.440 
so I'm just gonna select those edges
again<00:03:34.410> they're<00:03:35.410> already<00:03:35.709> selected<00:03:36.010> and<00:03:36.450> I'm

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
again they're already selected and I'm

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.620 
again they're already selected and I'm
gonna<00:03:37.570> right-click<00:03:37.840> pebble<00:03:38.850> and<00:03:39.850> I'm<00:03:40.510> just

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
gonna right-click pebble and I'm just

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.090 
gonna right-click pebble and I'm just
gonna<00:03:40.720> give<00:03:40.959> it<00:03:40.989> some<00:03:42.360> bevel<00:03:43.360> like<00:03:43.540> that

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
gonna give it some bevel like that

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.590 
gonna give it some bevel like that
where<00:03:45.100> it<00:03:45.250> said<00:03:45.430> round<00:03:45.700> originally<00:03:46.269> I'm<00:03:46.450> going

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
where it said round originally I'm going

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.600 
where it said round originally I'm going
to<00:03:46.660> change<00:03:46.870> this<00:03:47.019> to<00:03:47.080> profile<00:03:47.620> and<00:03:47.860> then<00:03:48.340> drag

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.610 
to change this to profile and then drag

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:50.640 
to change this to profile and then drag
and<00:03:48.730> drop<00:03:48.910> my<00:03:49.060> spline<00:03:49.480> into<00:03:49.810> that<00:03:49.930> profile<00:03:50.380> and

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
and drop my spline into that profile and

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.020 
and drop my spline into that profile and
now<00:03:51.459> we're<00:03:51.880> basically<00:03:52.000> using<00:03:52.540> this<00:03:52.870> spline<00:03:53.260> as

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
now we're basically using this spline as

00:03:54.030 --> 00:04:00.650 
now we're basically using this spline as
the<00:03:55.030> profile<00:03:55.480> shape<00:03:57.120> you<00:03:58.120> can<00:03:58.239> see<00:03:58.450> it<00:03:58.540> there

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
the profile shape you can see it there

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.320 
the profile shape you can see it there
and<00:04:01.660> because<00:04:01.930> I've<00:04:02.019> got<00:04:02.140> limit<00:04:02.410> selected<00:04:03.330> it

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 
and because I've got limit selected it

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:05.640 
and because I've got limit selected it
doesn't<00:04:04.660> go<00:04:04.750> beyond<00:04:05.049> the<00:04:05.110> limits<00:04:05.440> of<00:04:05.590> the

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
doesn't go beyond the limits of the

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.509 
doesn't go beyond the limits of the
edges<00:04:07.290> so<00:04:08.290> this<00:04:08.440> can<00:04:08.590> be<00:04:08.620> very<00:04:08.709> useful<00:04:08.950> for<00:04:09.489> our

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:09.519 
edges so this can be very useful for our

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:14.930 
edges so this can be very useful for our
interior<00:04:10.180> design<00:04:11.459> architectural<00:04:12.459> projects

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.250 

lastly<00:04:15.940> we're<00:04:16.510> just<00:04:16.630> going<00:04:16.750> to<00:04:16.780> delete<00:04:17.049> these

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
lastly we're just going to delete these

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.449 
lastly we're just going to delete these
here<00:04:18.100> and<00:04:18.930> I'm<00:04:19.930> just<00:04:20.049> going<00:04:20.169> to<00:04:20.349> make<00:04:21.010> my<00:04:21.160> plane

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
here and I'm just going to make my plane

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.750 
here and I'm just going to make my plane
object<00:04:21.640> visible

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
object visible

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.930 
object visible
it's<00:04:24.060> h2<00:04:24.600> sensor<00:04:24.960> two<00:04:25.110> objects<00:04:25.710> in<00:04:25.770> a<00:04:25.830> viewport

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.250 

and<00:04:29.940> I'm<00:04:30.210> just<00:04:30.330> gonna<00:04:30.420> select<00:04:30.600> some<00:04:30.870> edges<00:04:31.140> in

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
and I'm just gonna select some edges in

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:36.290 
and I'm just gonna select some edges in
the<00:04:31.320> middle<00:04:31.590> here<00:04:31.800> so<00:04:33.350> this<00:04:34.350> one<00:04:35.300> something

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
the middle here so this one something

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:44.660 
the middle here so this one something
like<00:04:42.260> something<00:04:43.260> like<00:04:43.380> that<00:04:43.680> and<00:04:43.950> I'm<00:04:44.550> gonna

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:44.670 
like something like that and I'm gonna

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.510 
like something like that and I'm gonna
right<00:04:44.880> click<00:04:44.910> go<00:04:45.270> to<00:04:45.360> bevel<00:04:46.280> and<00:04:47.280> I'm<00:04:47.400> just

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
right click go to bevel and I'm just

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.910 
right click go to bevel and I'm just
gonna<00:04:47.640> pull<00:04:47.880> it<00:04:47.970> out<00:04:48.650> you're<00:04:49.650> used<00:04:49.860> to

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:49.920 
gonna pull it out you're used to

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:56.570 
gonna pull it out you're used to
subdivision<00:04:50.580> slightly<00:04:55.370> so<00:04:56.370> with<00:04:56.550> zero

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
subdivision slightly so with zero

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
subdivision slightly so with zero
subdivisions<00:04:57.540> the<00:04:57.750> this<00:04:58.320> is<00:04:58.470> a<00:04:58.500> shape<00:04:58.740> we<00:04:58.890> get

00:04:59.590 --> 00:04:59.600 
subdivisions the this is a shape we get

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.940 
subdivisions the this is a shape we get
it's<00:05:00.600> kind<00:05:00.780> of<00:05:00.810> a<00:05:00.960> very<00:05:01.110> sharp<00:05:01.560> kind<00:05:01.860> of

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:01.950 
it's kind of a very sharp kind of

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:06.290 
it's kind of a very sharp kind of
mitering<00:05:03.650> but<00:05:04.650> we<00:05:04.980> can<00:05:05.130> actually<00:05:05.250> even<00:05:05.730> define

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 
mitering but we can actually even define

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.840 
mitering but we can actually even define
how<00:05:06.660> these<00:05:06.840> edges<00:05:07.320> how<00:05:08.040> these<00:05:08.160> corner<00:05:08.610> points

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:08.850 
how these edges how these corner points

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:11.030 
how these edges how these corner points
kind<00:05:09.150> of<00:05:09.210> behave<00:05:09.510> so<00:05:10.110> if<00:05:10.200> I<00:05:10.290> go<00:05:10.410> to<00:05:10.470> my<00:05:10.590> Turing

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:11.040 
kind of behave so if I go to my Turing

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.180 
kind of behave so if I go to my Turing
and<00:05:11.460> set<00:05:11.700> it<00:05:11.820> to<00:05:11.850> uniform<00:05:12.590> now<00:05:13.590> we've<00:05:13.830> got<00:05:14.040> this

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.190 
and set it to uniform now we've got this

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:17.630 
and set it to uniform now we've got this
kind<00:05:14.370> of<00:05:14.520> sharp<00:05:15.330> corner<00:05:15.780> and<00:05:15.960> it's<00:05:16.650> using<00:05:16.980> four

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:17.640 
kind of sharp corner and it's using four

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.090 
kind of sharp corner and it's using four
sided<00:05:17.910> polygons<00:05:18.450> as<00:05:18.630> well<00:05:18.810> so<00:05:19.800> we<00:05:19.890> basically

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.100 
sided polygons as well so we basically

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:21.890 
sided polygons as well so we basically
have<00:05:20.400> some<00:05:20.550> really<00:05:20.790> good<00:05:20.910> control<00:05:21.360> over<00:05:21.570> the

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
have some really good control over the

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.710 
have some really good control over the
topology<00:05:22.470> of<00:05:22.500> things<00:05:22.860> and<00:05:23.430> we've<00:05:24.240> also<00:05:24.420> got

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 
topology of things and we've also got

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.860 
topology of things and we've also got
radial<00:05:25.430> which<00:05:26.430> splits<00:05:27.240> it<00:05:27.390> into<00:05:27.450> two

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:27.870 
radial which splits it into two

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:31.220 
radial which splits it into two
triangles<00:05:28.470> again<00:05:29.040> quite<00:05:29.460> handy<00:05:29.790> and<00:05:30.230> it's

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:31.230 
triangles again quite handy and it's

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:33.080 
triangles again quite handy and it's
using<00:05:31.440> four-sided<00:05:32.160> polygons<00:05:32.580> again<00:05:32.880> no

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.090 
using four-sided polygons again no

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.530 
using four-sided polygons again no
angles<00:05:33.540> there<00:05:33.810> and<00:05:34.280> then<00:05:35.280> finally<00:05:35.850> patch<00:05:36.150> and

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:36.540 
angles there and then finally patch and

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:39.290 
angles there and then finally patch and
the<00:05:37.290> patch<00:05:37.530> basically<00:05:38.190> strictly<00:05:38.760> follows<00:05:39.150> the

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 
the patch basically strictly follows the

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.830 
the patch basically strictly follows the
original<00:05:39.390> shape<00:05:39.960> and<00:05:40.230> then<00:05:41.070> the<00:05:41.910> the<00:05:42.570> corner

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:42.840 
original shape and then the the corner

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.990 
original shape and then the the corner
is<00:05:42.990> kind<00:05:43.200> of<00:05:43.320> conform<00:05:44.130> to<00:05:44.340> that<00:05:44.370> original

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000 
is kind of conform to that original

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.350 
is kind of conform to that original
shape<00:05:45.240> which<00:05:45.450> was<00:05:45.630> set<00:05:46.880> so<00:05:47.880> some<00:05:48.060> very<00:05:48.210> useful

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.360 
shape which was set so some very useful

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:52.400 
shape which was set so some very useful
tools<00:05:48.810> here<00:05:49.140> and<00:05:50.780> I<00:05:51.780> think<00:05:52.050> that's<00:05:52.170> enough<00:05:52.380> for

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:52.410 
tools here and I think that's enough for

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:54.440 
tools here and I think that's enough for
part<00:05:52.740> one<00:05:52.920> but<00:05:53.190> in<00:05:53.310> part<00:05:53.580> two<00:05:53.760> I'll<00:05:54.000> go<00:05:54.030> through

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:54.450 
part one but in part two I'll go through

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:56.900 
part one but in part two I'll go through
these<00:05:54.540> further<00:05:54.870> options<00:05:55.320> as<00:05:55.500> well<00:05:55.650> but<00:05:56.550> in

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:56.910 
these further options as well but in

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:58.460 
these further options as well but in
case<00:05:57.120> you<00:05:57.270> want<00:05:57.420> to<00:05:57.480> find<00:05:57.660> out<00:05:57.840> how<00:05:58.200> anything

00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:58.470 
case you want to find out how anything

00:05:58.470 --> 00:05:59.960 
case you want to find out how anything
works<00:05:58.830> you<00:05:59.100> just<00:05:59.130> simply<00:05:59.580> have<00:05:59.700> to<00:05:59.730> right

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.880 
get some very detailed help in cinema 4d
with<00:06:06.270> diagrams<00:06:06.900> and<00:06:07.350> it<00:06:07.530> pretty<00:06:07.740> much

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:07.890 
with diagrams and it pretty much

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:11.690
