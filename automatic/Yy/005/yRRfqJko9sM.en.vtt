thing<00:00:34.989> I<00:00:35.230> have<00:00:35.440> to<00:00:35.470> say<00:00:35.650> about<00:00:35.830> this<00:00:36.070> game<00:00:36.280> they

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:36.579 
thing I have to say about this game they

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:38.090 
thing I have to say about this game they
felt<00:00:36.610> the<00:00:36.910> combat<00:00:37.360> was<00:00:37.390> a<00:00:37.510> little<00:00:37.720> bit<00:00:37.809> clunky

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
felt the combat was a little bit clunky

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.290 
felt the combat was a little bit clunky
when<00:00:39.100> you<00:00:39.400> first<00:00:39.610> started<00:00:39.909> playing<00:00:40.059> the

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
when you first started playing the

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.819 
when you first started playing the
combat<00:00:40.629> feels<00:00:40.839> okay<00:00:41.290> it's<00:00:41.500> a<00:00:41.559> little<00:00:41.589> bit

00:00:41.819 --> 00:00:41.829 
combat feels okay it's a little bit

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:44.459 
combat feels okay it's a little bit
simplistic<00:00:42.570> but<00:00:43.570> as<00:00:43.750> you<00:00:43.899> get<00:00:44.020> farther<00:00:44.199> into

00:00:44.459 --> 00:00:44.469 
simplistic but as you get farther into

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:45.959 
simplistic but as you get farther into
the<00:00:44.559> game<00:00:44.739> the<00:00:44.890> comment<00:00:45.160> becomes<00:00:45.399> frustrating

00:00:45.959 --> 00:00:45.969 
the game the comment becomes frustrating

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:49.110 
the game the comment becomes frustrating
because<00:00:46.059> fights<00:00:46.420> takes<00:00:46.780> so<00:00:47.170> long<00:00:48.000> kind<00:00:49.000> of<00:00:49.030> a

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
because fights takes so long kind of a

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.569 
because fights takes so long kind of a
similar<00:00:49.300> character<00:00:49.750> maybe<00:00:49.870> like<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:51.160> batman

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:51.579 
similar character maybe like the batman

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:53.430 
similar character maybe like the batman
games<00:00:51.879> where<00:00:52.090> you<00:00:52.149> can<00:00:52.300> counter<00:00:52.660> attacks<00:00:53.020> and

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.440 
games where you can counter attacks and

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.979 
games where you can counter attacks and
dodge<00:00:53.800> roll<00:00:54.160> like<00:00:54.430> Dark<00:00:54.699> Souls<00:00:54.870> whatever<00:00:55.870> the

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
dodge roll like Dark Souls whatever the

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:58.170 
dodge roll like Dark Souls whatever the
camera<00:00:56.410> point<00:00:56.649> is<00:00:56.949> fixed<00:00:57.699> so<00:00:57.940> when<00:00:58.059> you're

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.180 
camera point is fixed so when you're

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.500 
camera point is fixed so when you're
dealing<00:00:58.300> with<00:00:58.510> 8<00:00:58.930> 9<00:00:58.960> 10<00:00:59.410> 12<00:00:59.890> enemies<00:01:00.510> the

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
dealing with 8 9 10 12 enemies the

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.540 
dealing with 8 9 10 12 enemies the
combat<00:01:01.870> becomes<00:01:02.140> quite<00:01:02.469> tedious<00:01:02.800> later<00:01:03.219> on<00:01:03.429> as

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:03.550 
combat becomes quite tedious later on as

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:04.889 
combat becomes quite tedious later on as
the<00:01:03.640> enemies<00:01:03.910> gain<00:01:04.119> more<00:01:04.420> and<00:01:04.479> more<00:01:04.690> health

00:01:04.889 --> 00:01:04.899 
the enemies gain more and more health

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:06.570 
the enemies gain more and more health
and<00:01:05.140> you<00:01:05.199> don't<00:01:05.379> really<00:01:05.470> become<00:01:05.830> powerful<00:01:06.310> at

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.580 
and you don't really become powerful at

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.820 
and you don't really become powerful at
the<00:01:06.670> start<00:01:06.910> of<00:01:07.000> your<00:01:07.030> run<00:01:07.320> that<00:01:08.320> being<00:01:08.560> said

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:08.830 
the start of your run that being said

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.650 
the start of your run that being said
that<00:01:08.890> is<00:01:09.039> a<00:01:09.130> small<00:01:09.640> negative<00:01:09.940> on<00:01:10.330> what<00:01:10.509> is<00:01:10.630> a

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:10.660 
that is a small negative on what is a

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.840 
that is a small negative on what is a
quite<00:01:11.440> well<00:01:11.590> polished<00:01:12.009> game<00:01:12.220> and<00:01:12.550> I<00:01:12.670> thought

feel the game was worth twenty-five

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:23.580 
feel the game was worth twenty-five
dollars<00:01:22.450> which<00:01:22.720> is<00:01:22.750> the<00:01:22.959> price<00:01:23.140> tag<00:01:23.410> and

we<00:01:28.160> didn't<00:01:28.340> even<00:01:28.430> delve<00:01:28.730> into<00:01:28.910> the<00:01:29.030> endless
