00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:13.129
 Welcome a ladies and will be in the Allianz Arena yes and also 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:16.880
 welcome to the champions league final 2012 yes me there 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:17.880
 They welcome 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.640
 as well as two billion spectators on the screens of the big FC Bayern 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.839
 plays against Manchester United 

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:27.689
 two teams are technically as well as personnel not at all 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.589
 take today meet each other the dream of Munich today 

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:34.880
 in the filling which own stadium the Shard Street win 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.760
 but it could also become a nightmare we are curious to see 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.990
 Rows as it starts immediately think the referee gives about each 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.260
 Moment 2 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.260
 of course stranded here with statistics toss around us 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.680
 There is a lot to say about both teams I do not even know if you are 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.390
 something in 90 minutes and brings but 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.620
 even the coaches are meeting the veteran Silex since 86 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.360
 Hasty Manchester United is already part of the inventory of every opportunity 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.990
 Fuerth 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:06.480
 Manchester United he is going really well going long throw it repeated 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.670
 similar 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.200
 then the girls start playing but now just was not there 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.650
 12 to load and keep the ball path locked 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.610
 and also the banks hung up 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.610
 which led authority did not come into play at all 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.230
 bad passes 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.210
 still and which now but the possibility with fast counter over 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.470
 Money is going to nail but since the couple so Schweinsteiger 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.970
 stands there really good faith 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.640
 and of course it does 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.640
 Manchester United's life hard 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.900
 Ulber thus arose the composer Villa 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.190
 not having people who think we are a good one 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.690
 Idea ad hoc Bator 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.880
 because he was cooling 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.220
 now it happened he did what they are doing just before half-time 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.700
 Uli 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.750
 with the first goal before the Chamis league final 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.790
 against the big Bayern Munich 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.520
 once dreamed once not paid attention 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.420
 André the deed for a victory I would say just against English 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.049
 Teams that really looked good in penalties unit-it 

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:13.089
 Schweinsteiger 

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:14.269
 Burgwedel 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:17.670
 you do not get to Sina i prefer to play Robert a 

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:20.890
 Boateng make sure 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.259
 and above the ball the pas 

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:27.259
 only on the ball 

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:32.169
 Luiz Gustavo 

00:02:32.169 --> 00:02:33.829
 the love of cattle 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:38.069
 very nice pass on Rob Green and if then either he's money we continue 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:38.709
 out 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.939
 according to the old custom Ladies 

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:46.879
 For 90 minutes, that's the thing for 99 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:48.759
 one does not know 

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:49.719
 madness 

00:02:49.719 --> 00:02:50.999
 Thomas Müller 

00:02:50.999 --> 00:02:53.129
 after flank by Arjen Robben 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:56.379
 It can not be more beautiful Scheiner Cottbus 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:57.989
 in the 90 minutes 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:02:59.589
 now changed 

00:02:59.589 --> 00:03:02.759
 Another author who comes in high certainly goes on the defensive 

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:05.759
 and Breno still a fourth man for the defense 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:09.269
 that can be irritated 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:12.730
 the English are not sitting on me until the Wersener that he at the Bayern 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.730
 Munich wins the Champions League my dear ladies like 

00:03:19.779 --> 00:03:22.790
 What she's dreaming about here comes true here 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:26.829
 Stoffels the leaders come today do not change me
