that<00:03:11.300> happened<00:03:11.600> in<00:03:11.660> the<00:03:11.750> theater<00:03:12.080> and<00:03:12.290> I

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:12.770 
that happened in the theater and I

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:14.410 
that happened in the theater and I
understand<00:03:13.460> cutting<00:03:13.790> that<00:03:13.880> and<00:03:14.060> getting<00:03:14.180> rid

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
understand cutting that and getting rid

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:15.550 
understand cutting that and getting rid
of<00:03:14.450> that<00:03:14.690> that's<00:03:14.810> a<00:03:14.930> little<00:03:15.080> too<00:03:15.320> coincidental

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
of that that's a little too coincidental

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.890 
of that that's a little too coincidental
and<00:03:16.160> might<00:03:16.520> bring<00:03:16.760> up<00:03:16.910> some<00:03:17.060> bad<00:03:17.240> memories<00:03:17.270> but

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
and might bring up some bad memories but

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.360 
and might bring up some bad memories but
what<00:03:18.260> they<00:03:18.380> did<00:03:18.590> is<00:03:18.620> they<00:03:18.770> replaced<00:03:19.220> it<00:03:19.310> with

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
what they did is they replaced it with

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.100 
what they did is they replaced it with
another<00:03:19.730> scene<00:03:20.000> in<00:03:20.120> this<00:03:20.209> movie<00:03:20.270> that<00:03:20.900> just

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
another scene in this movie that just

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.690 
another scene in this movie that just
doesn't<00:03:21.350> make<00:03:21.620> any<00:03:21.800> sense<00:03:22.100> and<00:03:22.340> I<00:03:22.430> could

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
doesn't make any sense and I could

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.670 
doesn't make any sense and I could
understand<00:03:23.090> replacing<00:03:23.660> the<00:03:23.780> scene<00:03:24.020> but<00:03:24.590> the

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
understand replacing the scene but the

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:25.810 
understand replacing the scene but the
thing<00:03:24.860> that<00:03:24.980> they<00:03:25.100> put<00:03:25.130> in<00:03:25.340> this<00:03:25.430> movie<00:03:25.670> just

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
thing that they put in this movie just

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.610 
thing that they put in this movie just
does<00:03:26.060> not<00:03:26.209> make<00:03:26.510> any<00:03:26.720> sense<00:03:26.930> at<00:03:27.110> all<00:03:27.200> watching

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
does not make any sense at all watching

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.530 
does not make any sense at all watching
it<00:03:28.040> I<00:03:28.280> was<00:03:28.580> just<00:03:28.760> like<00:03:28.880> that<00:03:29.090> feels<00:03:29.330> like<00:03:29.390> it

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
it I was just like that feels like it

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.720 
it I was just like that feels like it
was<00:03:29.660> tacked<00:03:29.959> in<00:03:30.200> there<00:03:30.380> they<00:03:30.709> shot<00:03:31.010> it<00:03:31.160> in<00:03:31.250> 48

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
was tacked in there they shot it in 48

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.370 
was tacked in there they shot it in 48
minutes<00:03:32.120> on<00:03:32.240> some<00:03:32.390> Hollywood<00:03:32.810> backlot

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
minutes on some Hollywood backlot

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.860 
minutes on some Hollywood backlot
and<00:03:33.560> it's<00:03:34.520> just<00:03:34.730> not<00:03:34.820> very<00:03:35.120> interesting<00:03:35.750> or

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
and it's just not very interesting or

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.020 
and it's just not very interesting or
good<00:03:36.110> or<00:03:36.350> make<00:03:36.560> any<00:03:36.770> logical<00:03:37.459> sense<00:03:37.520> what's

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
good or make any logical sense what's

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.180 
good or make any logical sense what's
happening<00:03:38.450> in<00:03:38.540> this<00:03:38.630> scene<00:03:38.900> and<00:03:39.200> its<00:03:39.890> really

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
happening in this scene and its really

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.100 
happening in this scene and its really
