cool<00:02:04.830> growing<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:06.380> just<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.650> left<00:02:07.860> of

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
cool growing and just to the left of

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.300 
cool growing and just to the left of
that<00:02:08.280> is<00:02:08.550> a<00:02:08.690> new<00:02:09.690> new<00:02:10.380> creature<00:02:10.649> that<00:02:10.920> I<00:02:10.979> added

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
that is a new new creature that I added

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.520 
that is a new new creature that I added
just<00:02:11.670> a<00:02:12.060> couple<00:02:12.240> days<00:02:12.480> ago<00:02:12.630> and<00:02:12.990> that<00:02:13.290> is<00:02:13.500> a

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
just a couple days ago and that is a

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.920 
just a couple days ago and that is a
feather<00:02:14.040> duster<00:02:14.280> worm<00:02:14.730> so<00:02:15.390> that's<00:02:15.540> actually<00:02:15.690> a

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
feather duster worm so that's actually a

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.230 
feather duster worm so that's actually a
worm<00:02:16.200> he<00:02:16.410> builds<00:02:16.800> builds<00:02:17.580> that<00:02:17.730> little<00:02:17.970> tube

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
worm he builds builds that little tube

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.640 
worm he builds builds that little tube
and<00:02:18.450> then<00:02:18.600> that's<00:02:18.750> his<00:02:18.930> head<00:02:19.170> that<00:02:19.320> he<00:02:19.410> sticks

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
and then that's his head that he sticks

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.040 
and then that's his head that he sticks
out<00:02:19.860> with<00:02:20.100> all<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:21.209> little<00:02:21.390> feathers<00:02:21.840> that

out with all the little feathers that

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.720 
out with all the little feathers that
actually<00:02:22.380> catch<00:02:22.590> particles<00:02:23.190> of<00:02:23.310> food<00:02:23.489> in<00:02:23.640> the

water<00:02:23.880> and<00:02:24.620> then<00:02:25.620> moving<00:02:25.830> around<00:02:26.130> to<00:02:26.520> the<00:02:26.970> side

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
water and then moving around to the side

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.729 
water and then moving around to the side
of<00:02:27.209> the<00:02:27.360> tank<00:02:27.540> here<00:02:27.900> this<00:02:28.080> is<00:02:28.170> another<00:02:28.440> thing

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.160 
neat
I'm<00:03:22.670> also<00:03:23.000> there's<00:03:23.180> a<00:03:23.239> pistol<00:03:23.600> shrimp<00:03:23.840> in<00:03:23.989> here

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
I'm also there's a pistol shrimp in here

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.140 
I'm also there's a pistol shrimp in here
but<00:03:24.380> he<00:03:24.560> stays<00:03:25.160> up<00:03:25.340> in<00:03:25.459> the<00:03:25.519> rocks<00:03:25.790> and<00:03:26.060> all

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
but he stays up in the rocks and all

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:27.520 
but he stays up in the rocks and all
that<00:03:26.269> comes<00:03:26.450> up<00:03:26.630> at<00:03:26.900> night<00:03:27.110> and<00:03:27.200> so<00:03:27.290> that's<00:03:27.440> the

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
that comes up at night and so that's the

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.699 
that comes up at night and so that's the
only<00:03:27.590> time<00:03:27.830> you<00:03:27.950> see<00:03:28.010> him<00:03:28.930> all<00:03:29.930> right<00:03:29.959> and<00:03:30.470> then

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
only time you see him all right and then

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:33.729 
only time you see him all right and then
so<00:03:31.580> just<00:03:31.819> right<00:03:32.060> of<00:03:32.209> both<00:03:32.360> my<00:03:32.810> scarlet<00:03:33.319> cleaner

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
so just right of both my scarlet cleaner

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:36.009 
so just right of both my scarlet cleaner
shrimp<00:03:34.160> is<00:03:34.459> another<00:03:34.880> mushroom<00:03:35.269> coral<00:03:35.660> growing

that's<00:03:36.950> an<00:03:37.069> orange<00:03:37.280> mushroom<00:03:38.000> coral<00:03:38.440> very

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
that's an orange mushroom coral very

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.500 
that's an orange mushroom coral very
pretty<00:03:39.830> and<00:03:40.130> that<00:03:40.430> is<00:03:40.790> also<00:03:41.150> starting<00:03:41.299> to

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
pretty and that is also starting to

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.330 
pretty and that is also starting to
expand<00:03:41.900> and<00:03:42.049> grow<00:03:42.080> in<00:03:42.290> the<00:03:42.380> tank<00:03:42.650> and<00:03:42.890> actually

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
expand and grow in the tank and actually

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.600 
expand and grow in the tank and actually
just<00:03:43.549> produced<00:03:44.030> its<00:03:44.239> first<00:03:44.510> little<00:03:44.930> offspring

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
just produced its first little offspring

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.860 
just produced its first little offspring
which<00:03:46.610> is<00:03:46.760> also<00:03:46.940> starting<00:03:47.360> to<00:03:47.450> grow<00:03:47.630> so

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
which is also starting to grow so

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:48.910 
which is also starting to grow so
that'll<00:03:48.080> be<00:03:48.170> really<00:03:48.290> cool<00:03:48.500> to<00:03:48.650> see<00:03:48.709> that

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
that'll be really cool to see that

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.699 
that'll be really cool to see that
expand<00:03:49.400> and<00:03:49.640> then<00:03:50.450> one<00:03:51.110> of<00:03:51.170> the<00:03:51.260> lot<00:03:51.380> or<00:03:51.410> the

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
expand and then one of the lot or the

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:54.039 
expand and then one of the lot or the
the<00:03:51.980> last<00:03:52.220> coral<00:03:52.610> in<00:03:52.730> the<00:03:52.819> tank<00:03:53.090> is<00:03:53.420> my<00:03:53.780> star

then the last thing I think I haven't
talked<00:04:08.780> about<00:04:08.900> yet<00:04:09.260> is<00:04:09.709> my<00:04:10.390> pygmy<00:04:11.390> angelfish

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:13.710 
talked about yet is my pygmy angelfish

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:16.550 
talked about yet is my pygmy angelfish
with<00:04:14.100> the<00:04:14.250> yellow<00:04:14.400> face<00:04:14.670> and<00:04:15.200> I<00:04:16.200> call<00:04:16.410> her

spaz

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:20.480 
spaz
kind<00:04:19.260> of<00:04:19.320> swims<00:04:19.590> all<00:04:19.740> over<00:04:20.010> the<00:04:20.130> tank<00:04:20.340> and

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:20.490 
kind of swims all over the tank and

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:23.480 
kind of swims all over the tank and
where<00:04:21.300> most<00:04:21.480> angelfish<00:04:22.080> get<00:04:22.500> over<00:04:22.950> a<00:04:22.980> footlong

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
where most angelfish get over a footlong

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.030 
where most angelfish get over a footlong
she'll<00:04:23.910> only<00:04:24.330> get<00:04:24.600> probably<00:04:25.020> about<00:04:25.500> two<00:04:25.860> and<00:04:25.980> a

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 
she'll only get probably about two and a

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.610 
she'll only get probably about two and a
half<00:04:26.070> or<00:04:26.460> three<00:04:26.490> inches<00:04:27.060> which<00:04:28.020> is<00:04:28.050> perfect

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
half or three inches which is perfect

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.500 
half or three inches which is perfect
for<00:04:28.650> a<00:04:28.800> smaller<00:04:29.070> tank<00:04:29.340> and<00:04:29.760> then<00:04:30.330> that's

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
for a smaller tank and then that's

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.210 
for a smaller tank and then that's
pretty<00:04:30.690> much<00:04:30.810> it<00:04:31.170> there's<00:04:31.410> a<00:04:31.470> you<00:04:31.980> know<00:04:32.100> the

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
pretty much it there's a you know the

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.100 
pretty much it there's a you know the
rocks<00:04:32.430> are<00:04:32.640> alive<00:04:32.730> so<00:04:33.540> there's<00:04:33.690> all<00:04:33.810> kinds<00:04:34.080> of

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
rocks are alive so there's all kinds of

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.260 
rocks are alive so there's all kinds of
stuff<00:04:34.350> growing<00:04:34.740> and<00:04:34.890> living<00:04:34.980> in<00:04:35.250> them<00:04:35.430> I've

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
stuff growing and living in them I've

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.470 
stuff growing and living in them I've
had<00:04:36.510> a<00:04:36.540> couple<00:04:36.750> small<00:04:37.170> starfish<00:04:37.800> appear

had a couple small starfish appear
randomly<00:04:39.480> it<00:04:39.840> probably<00:04:40.350> came<00:04:40.560> out<00:04:40.710> of<00:04:40.800> the

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:40.890 
randomly it probably came out of the

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:43.370 
randomly it probably came out of the
live<00:04:41.070> rock<00:04:41.480> and<00:04:42.480> then<00:04:42.630> also<00:04:42.780> there's<00:04:43.080> a<00:04:43.170> couple
