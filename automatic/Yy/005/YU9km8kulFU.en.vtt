00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:05.890 
what's the meaning
I<00:01:02.750> think<00:01:03.230> it's<00:01:03.320> like<00:01:03.469> Plaga<00:01:04.420> removal<00:01:05.420> laser

I think it's like Plaga removal laser
something<00:01:06.590> like<00:01:06.710> a

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
it's the only bad thing about it is it

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.180
