this is the problem all these traps

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.369 
this is the problem all these traps
pretty<00:00:55.420> soon<00:00:55.660> they're<00:00:55.930> going<00:00:56.020> to<00:00:56.110> be<00:00:56.230> out<00:00:56.350> on

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:51.549 
pass on the reef as you can't get the

pass on the reef as you can't get the
fish<00:01:51.759> on<00:01:51.970> the<00:01:52.119> reef<00:01:52.150> because<00:01:52.630> the<00:01:52.810> pots<00:01:53.020> are

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
fish on the reef because the pots are

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.520

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.670 
clogging the reason pot on the reefs are
an<00:01:56.680> issue<00:01:56.890> for<00:01:57.280> two<00:01:57.820> reasons<00:01:58.030> one<00:01:58.960> you<00:01:59.439> have

00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680 
an issue for two reasons one you have

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.730 
an issue for two reasons one you have
your<00:02:00.100> gear<00:02:00.549> on<00:02:00.729> the<00:02:00.759> bottom<00:02:01.299> the<00:02:01.899> gear<00:02:02.320> is<00:02:02.470> set

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
your gear on the bottom the gear is set

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.160 
your gear on the bottom the gear is set
up<00:02:02.920> in<00:02:03.100> long<00:02:03.399> strings<00:02:04.000> of<00:02:04.180> gear<00:02:04.570> so<00:02:04.810> while<00:02:04.990> the

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
up in long strings of gear so while the

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.430 
up in long strings of gear so while the
pots<00:02:05.409> themselves<00:02:05.740> are<00:02:06.310> relatively<00:02:06.880> small

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
pots themselves are relatively small

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.190 
pots themselves are relatively small
patrol<00:02:08.440> lines<00:02:08.860> span<00:02:09.729> long<00:02:10.239> distances<00:02:10.989> on<00:02:11.170> the

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
patrol lines span long distances on the

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.699 
patrol lines span long distances on the
bottom<00:02:11.769> secondly<00:02:12.700> you<00:02:13.180> have<00:02:13.209> the<00:02:13.750> surface

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
bottom secondly you have the surface

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:18.600 
bottom secondly you have the surface
gear<00:02:15.070> such<00:02:15.549> as<00:02:15.760> buoys<00:02:16.799> marking<00:02:17.799> the<00:02:18.010> gear<00:02:18.489> and

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
gear such as buoys marking the gear and

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.930 
gear such as buoys marking the gear and
if<00:02:19.360> that<00:02:19.750> gear<00:02:20.200> is<00:02:20.560> in<00:02:20.620> the<00:02:20.920> way<00:02:21.070> your<00:02:21.700> boat

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
if that gear is in the way your boat

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.240 
if that gear is in the way your boat
can't<00:02:22.269> drift<00:02:22.690> around<00:02:22.900> them<00:02:23.350> nor<00:02:23.920> can<00:02:24.220> you

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
can't drift around them nor can you

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.729
