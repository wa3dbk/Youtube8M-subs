00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.659 

now<00:00:00.960> I<00:00:01.020> would<00:00:01.319> do<00:00:01.500> this<00:00:01.650> video<00:00:01.829> with<00:00:02.129> my<00:00:02.280> canon

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
now I would do this video with my canon

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:04.249 
now I would do this video with my canon
powershot<00:00:02.879> but<00:00:03.540> I<00:00:03.570> don't<00:00:03.810> think<00:00:04.020> that<00:00:04.140> would

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
powershot but I don't think that would

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:05.720 
powershot but I don't think that would
work<00:00:04.440> really<00:00:04.620> well<00:00:04.890> with<00:00:05.100> this<00:00:05.310> because<00:00:05.580> of

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
work really well with this because of

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.589 
work really well with this because of
what<00:00:05.910> I'm<00:00:06.000> going<00:00:06.150> to<00:00:06.210> show<00:00:06.390> you<00:00:08.480> what<00:00:09.480> I'm

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
what I'm going to show you what I'm

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.570 
what I'm going to show you what I'm
going<00:00:09.719> to<00:00:09.809> show<00:00:10.080> you<00:00:10.110> is<00:00:10.410> my<00:00:10.440> monocular<00:00:11.250> and

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
going to show you is my monocular and

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:19.779 
going to show you is my monocular and
it's<00:00:11.820> here<00:00:12.030> in<00:00:12.150> this<00:00:12.269> case<00:00:15.289> I've<00:00:16.289> had<00:00:16.770> it<00:00:17.130> for<00:00:17.760> a

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:19.789 
it's here in this case I've had it for a

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:23.900 
it's here in this case I've had it for a
number<00:00:20.789> of<00:00:21.090> years<00:00:21.660> I<00:00:22.369> never<00:00:23.369> really<00:00:23.670> had<00:00:23.820> the

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
number of years I never really had the

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.830 
number of years I never really had the
opportunity<00:00:23.939> to<00:00:24.539> use<00:00:24.750> it<00:00:25.550> but<00:00:26.550> it's<00:00:27.539> always

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
opportunity to use it but it's always

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.179 
opportunity to use it but it's always
here<00:00:28.050> in<00:00:28.199> case<00:00:28.410> I<00:00:28.590> do<00:00:28.650> need<00:00:29.039> it<00:00:30.859> that's<00:00:31.859> caps

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
here in case I do need it that's caps

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:40.740 
here in case I do need it that's caps
fell<00:00:32.460> off

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:40.750 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:49.600 

okay<00:00:44.680> so<00:00:45.680> this<00:00:45.950> is<00:00:46.280> a<00:00:47.470> I<00:00:48.470> believe<00:00:49.190> this<00:00:49.340> is<00:00:49.400> an

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:49.610 
okay so this is a I believe this is an

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:57.850 
okay so this is a I believe this is an
Orion<00:00:55.270> yeah<00:00:56.270> this<00:00:56.450> is<00:00:56.570> an<00:00:56.720> Orion<00:00:57.200> monocular

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:57.860 
Orion yeah this is an Orion monocular

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:05.500 
Orion yeah this is an Orion monocular
and<00:00:59.470> I<00:01:00.470> have<00:01:00.920> had<00:01:01.190> this<00:01:01.460> monocular<00:01:02.210> since<00:01:04.510> well

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.510 
and I have had this monocular since well

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:15.340 
and I have had this monocular since well
I<00:01:05.750> don't<00:01:06.080> know<00:01:06.200> when<00:01:06.410> I<00:01:06.440> got<00:01:06.710> it<00:01:12.070> unwrapped<00:01:14.350> the

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
I don't know when I got it unwrapped the

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:23.310 
I don't know when I got it unwrapped the
strap<00:01:16.070> here<00:01:16.540> the<00:01:17.540> cause<00:01:20.110> the<00:01:21.110> strap<00:01:21.410> is<00:01:21.619> such

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
strap here the cause the strap is such

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.690 
strap here the cause the strap is such
that<00:01:24.320> you<00:01:24.440> can<00:01:24.590> wear<00:01:24.800> it<00:01:24.890> around<00:01:24.979> your<00:01:25.160> neck

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.140 

now<00:01:28.700> some<00:01:29.000> of<00:01:29.030> you<00:01:29.210> might<00:01:29.420> be<00:01:29.600> wondering<00:01:31.150> how

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 
now some of you might be wondering how

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.969 
now some of you might be wondering how
would<00:01:32.210> you<00:01:32.450> use<00:01:32.720> this<00:01:32.990> and<00:01:33.229> why<00:01:33.350> would<00:01:33.590> you<00:01:33.619> use

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
would you use this and why would you use

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:39.340 
would you use this and why would you use
it<00:01:34.330> well<00:01:36.580> if<00:01:37.580> you<00:01:37.880> have<00:01:38.149> visions<00:01:38.780> such<00:01:39.110> that

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
it well if you have visions such that

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.080 
it well if you have visions such that
you<00:01:39.440> cannot<00:01:39.740> effectively<00:01:40.190> see<00:01:40.580> across<00:01:40.910> an

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
you cannot effectively see across an

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.600 
you cannot effectively see across an
intersection<00:01:41.300> to<00:01:41.780> see<00:01:41.990> a<00:01:42.200> traffic<00:01:42.920> light<00:01:43.130> or<00:01:43.520> a

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
intersection to see a traffic light or a

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.610 
intersection to see a traffic light or a
sign<00:01:44.270> in<00:01:44.479> the<00:01:44.600> distance<00:01:47.080> that's<00:01:48.080> how<00:01:48.560> you

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:48.620 
sign in the distance that's how you

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.790 
sign in the distance that's how you
would<00:01:48.830> use<00:01:49.100> this<00:01:49.340> so<00:01:49.550> I'm<00:01:49.640> gonna<00:01:49.760> take<00:01:50.090> off

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:50.800 
would use this so I'm gonna take off

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:56.039 
would use this so I'm gonna take off
this<00:01:51.800> lens<00:01:52.100> cap<00:01:52.370> here<00:01:52.640> for<00:01:52.850> the<00:01:52.940> eyepiece<00:01:54.640> and

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:56.049 
this lens cap here for the eyepiece and

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:06.690 
this lens cap here for the eyepiece and
then<00:01:57.049> this<00:01:57.200> les<00:01:57.440> Gant<00:01:57.710> lens<00:01:57.920> cap<00:01:58.159> here<00:02:01.150> for<00:02:02.150> the

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:13.210 

for<00:02:07.700> the<00:02:07.760> actual<00:02:08.090> lens<00:02:08.299> itself

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.980 

and<00:02:13.760> you<00:02:13.940> would<00:02:14.090> essentially<00:02:14.480> look<00:02:14.720> through

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
and you would essentially look through

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:21.250 
and you would essentially look through
it<00:02:15.110> like<00:02:15.290> so<00:02:15.590> and<00:02:19.450> you<00:02:20.450> would<00:02:20.600> use<00:02:20.810> it<00:02:20.990> to<00:02:21.110> look

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
it like so and you would use it to look

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:31.030 
it like so and you would use it to look
off<00:02:21.440> into<00:02:21.650> the<00:02:21.800> distance<00:02:21.950> and<00:02:27.100> you<00:02:28.100> take<00:02:30.040> two

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
off into the distance and you take two

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.220 
off into the distance and you take two
halves<00:02:31.340> here<00:02:32.050> and<00:02:33.670> you<00:02:34.670> twist<00:02:35.060> this<00:02:35.450> to<00:02:35.720> focus

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
halves here and you twist this to focus

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.260 
halves here and you twist this to focus
it's<00:02:36.950> very<00:02:37.310> similar<00:02:37.820> in<00:02:39.010> operation<00:02:40.010> to<00:02:40.250> a<00:02:40.280> DSLR

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
it's very similar in operation to a DSLR

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:48.190 
it's very similar in operation to a DSLR
camera<00:02:41.680> lens<00:02:43.900> so<00:02:44.900> I<00:02:44.930> have<00:02:45.230> my<00:02:45.380> monocular<00:02:47.200> away

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
camera lens so I have my monocular away

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.380 
camera lens so I have my monocular away
from<00:02:48.440> my<00:02:48.560> eye<00:02:48.590> and<00:02:49.520> I<00:02:49.640> can<00:02:49.850> tell<00:02:50.060> that<00:02:50.090> there's

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
from my eye and I can tell that there's

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.900 
from my eye and I can tell that there's
a<00:02:50.450> cap<00:02:50.810> over<00:02:51.080> there<00:02:51.470> but<00:02:52.040> I<00:02:52.070> cannot<00:02:52.430> see<00:02:52.700> what's

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
a cap over there but I cannot see what's

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.390 
a cap over there but I cannot see what's
on<00:02:53.060> it<00:02:53.120> so<00:02:53.900> I'm<00:02:53.990> gonna<00:02:54.080> take<00:02:54.410> my<00:02:54.470> monocular<00:02:55.190> put

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
on it so I'm gonna take my monocular put

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.140 
on it so I'm gonna take my monocular put
it<00:02:55.490> in<00:02:55.580> front<00:02:55.790> of<00:02:55.850> my<00:02:56.000> eye

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
it in front of my eye

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.310 
it in front of my eye
aim<00:02:56.510> it<00:02:56.720> at<00:02:57.230> the<00:02:57.530> Hat<00:02:58.010> and<00:02:58.340> it<00:02:58.940> says<00:02:59.320> don't

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
aim it at the Hat and it says don't

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.160 
aim it at the Hat and it says don't
bother<00:03:00.590> me<00:03:01.010> and<00:03:01.790> I<00:03:02.300> can't<00:03:02.570> see<00:03:02.750> what<00:03:02.870> the<00:03:02.990> rest

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
bother me and I can't see what the rest

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.540 
bother me and I can't see what the rest
of<00:03:03.290> it<00:03:03.440> says<00:03:03.680> behind<00:03:04.520> that<00:03:04.760> clock<00:03:05.260> actually<00:03:06.550> it

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:07.550 
of it says behind that clock actually it

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.820 
of it says behind that clock actually it
says<00:03:07.760> don't<00:03:08.000> bother<00:03:08.180> me<00:03:08.420> I'm<00:03:08.510> crabby<00:03:08.870> but<00:03:09.260> you

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
says don't bother me I'm crabby but you

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:16.300 
says don't bother me I'm crabby but you
get<00:03:09.980> the<00:03:10.100> idea<00:03:10.130> if<00:03:10.640> you<00:03:11.620> cannot<00:03:12.620> see<00:03:14.500> very<00:03:15.500> well

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
get the idea if you cannot see very well

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.740 
get the idea if you cannot see very well
distance<00:03:17.239> wise<00:03:17.600> like<00:03:18.380> myself<00:03:19.060> this<00:03:20.060> is<00:03:20.420> what

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
distance wise like myself this is what

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:27.550 
distance wise like myself this is what
you<00:03:20.840> can<00:03:21.050> use<00:03:21.380> if<00:03:21.800> you<00:03:22.520> do<00:03:22.730> not<00:03:22.910> want<00:03:23.420> to<00:03:26.140> if<00:03:27.140> you

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
you can use if you do not want to if you

you<00:03:48.380> could<00:03:48.530> walk<00:03:48.709> across<00:03:48.860> the<00:03:49.280> street<00:03:49.730> but

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
you could walk across the street but

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.380 
you could walk across the street but
that<00:03:50.720> wastes<00:03:51.140> its<00:03:51.260> time<00:03:51.760> you<00:03:52.760> could<00:03:52.910> just<00:03:53.090> stop

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
that wastes its time you could just stop

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.380 
that wastes its time you could just stop
at<00:03:53.630> the<00:03:53.720> intersection<00:03:53.750> while<00:03:54.470> you're<00:03:54.620> waiting

at the intersection while you're waiting

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.780 
at the intersection while you're waiting
aim<00:03:56.390> it<00:03:56.570> over<00:03:56.660> towards<00:03:56.989> the<00:03:57.140> poster<00:03:57.680> and<00:03:57.890> take

aim it over towards the poster and take

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.770 
aim it over towards the poster and take
a<00:03:58.820> look<00:03:59.090> and<00:03:59.450> see<00:03:59.870> what<00:04:00.050> it<00:04:00.140> says<00:04:00.700> or<00:04:01.700> if<00:04:02.600> your

enough to see traffic lights you just

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.520 
enough to see traffic lights you just
put<00:04:16.730> it<00:04:16.850> up<00:04:16.940> here

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
put it up here

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:24.170 
put it up here
focus<00:04:19.530> in<00:04:19.799> on<00:04:20.790> the<00:04:21.540> traffic<00:04:21.780> light<00:04:22.199> and<00:04:23.180> then

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
focus in on the traffic light and then

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.640 
focus in on the traffic light and then
you<00:04:24.270> can<00:04:24.449> wait<00:04:24.600> till<00:04:24.780> it<00:04:24.900> turns<00:04:25.139> green<00:04:25.350> and

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
you can wait till it turns green and

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:26.810 
you can wait till it turns green and
then<00:04:25.740> you<00:04:25.860> can<00:04:25.980> make<00:04:26.130> your<00:04:26.160> way<00:04:26.370> across<00:04:26.490> the

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
then you can make your way across the

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.920 
then you can make your way across the
street<00:04:27.500> so<00:04:28.500> that's<00:04:29.340> basically<00:04:30.000> the<00:04:30.270> use<00:04:30.570> of

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
street so that's basically the use of

street so that's basically the use of
the<00:04:31.380> monocular<00:04:34.070> so<00:04:35.070> I'm<00:04:35.160> gonna<00:04:35.310> go<00:04:35.520> ahead<00:04:35.550> and

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
the monocular so I'm gonna go ahead and

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:42.920 
the monocular so I'm gonna go ahead and
put<00:04:38.580> these<00:04:39.410> ones<00:04:40.410> caps<00:04:40.860> back<00:04:41.220> on<00:04:41.750> and<00:04:42.750> while

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
put these ones caps back on and while

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.439 
put these ones caps back on and while
I'm<00:04:43.080> setting<00:04:44.010> it<00:04:44.070> away<00:04:44.340> go<00:04:44.850> into<00:04:45.120> a<00:04:45.150> little<00:04:45.360> bit

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:05.070 
ahead and and see and then use it to see

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:06.860 
ahead and and see and then use it to see
now<00:06:05.220> that<00:06:05.400> this<00:06:05.970> is<00:06:06.150> just<00:06:06.360> one<00:06:06.630> type<00:06:06.840> of

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:06.870 
now that this is just one type of

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:08.570 
now that this is just one type of
monocular<00:06:07.410> this<00:06:07.560> is<00:06:07.710> for<00:06:07.919> distance<00:06:08.280> they<00:06:08.430> also

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:08.580 
monocular this is for distance they also

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:13.460 
monocular this is for distance they also
make<00:06:08.910> binoculars<00:06:09.510> that<00:06:10.099> can<00:06:11.099> be<00:06:11.250> used<00:06:12.470> close

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:13.470 
make binoculars that can be used close

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:16.390 
make binoculars that can be used close
up<00:06:13.770> that<00:06:13.979> are<00:06:14.310> a<00:06:14.340> little<00:06:14.610> bit<00:06:14.729> more<00:06:14.880> compact

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:16.400 
up that are a little bit more compact

up that are a little bit more compact
i've<00:06:17.400> got<00:06:17.610> a<00:06:17.639> friend<00:06:18.000> who<00:06:18.389> has<00:06:18.780> the<00:06:19.110> pantech

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:21.560 
i've got a friend who has the pantech

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.469 
i've got a friend who has the pantech
c-130<00:06:22.560> the<00:06:23.010> really<00:06:23.760> really<00:06:23.970> tiny<00:06:24.300> little

phone and he cannot see the display

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:31.010 
phone and he cannot see the display
effectively<00:06:29.580> without<00:06:29.700> a<00:06:29.909> monocular<00:06:30.450> and<00:06:30.630> they

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:31.020 
effectively without a monocular and they

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:34.610 
effectively without a monocular and they
monoculars<00:06:31.819> for<00:06:32.819> that<00:06:33.150> purpose<00:06:33.780> for<00:06:34.080> close-up

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:34.620 
monoculars for that purpose for close-up

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:39.369 
monoculars for that purpose for close-up
viewing<00:06:35.389> so<00:06:36.389> if<00:06:36.509> you<00:06:36.629> cannot<00:06:36.900> see<00:06:37.199> well<00:06:37.410> enough

00:06:39.369 --> 00:06:39.379 
viewing so if you cannot see well enough

00:06:39.379 --> 00:06:44.990 
viewing so if you cannot see well enough
to<00:06:40.379> see<00:06:40.940> things<00:06:41.940> like<00:06:42.120> the<00:06:42.419> like<00:06:43.580> phone<00:06:44.580> screen

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:45.000 
to see things like the like phone screen

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.330 
to see things like the like phone screen
that's<00:06:45.690> for<00:06:46.169> that<00:06:46.259> that's<00:06:46.590> where<00:06:46.919> that<00:06:47.069> cyber

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:47.340 
that's for that that's where that cyber

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:49.700 
that's for that that's where that cyber
monocular<00:06:47.940> will<00:06:48.060> come<00:06:48.210> in<00:06:48.330> handy<00:06:48.509> but<00:06:49.440> that's

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:49.710 
monocular will come in handy but that's

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:51.170 
monocular will come in handy but that's
just<00:06:50.069> a<00:06:50.159> general<00:06:50.310> idea<00:06:50.639> of<00:06:50.879> what<00:06:51.030> the

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:51.180 
just a general idea of what the

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:52.850 
just a general idea of what the
monocular<00:06:51.569> is<00:06:51.840> it<00:06:52.020> just<00:06:52.199> helps<00:06:52.440> you<00:06:52.530> to<00:06:52.620> see

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:52.860 
monocular is it just helps you to see

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:54.379 
monocular is it just helps you to see
better<00:06:53.069> in<00:06:53.220> the<00:06:53.310> most<00:06:53.490> common<00:06:53.759> type<00:06:54.090> that<00:06:54.240> I've

00:06:54.379 --> 00:06:54.389 
better in the most common type that I've

00:06:54.389 --> 00:06:56.240 
better in the most common type that I've
seen<00:06:54.720> is<00:06:54.870> for<00:06:55.020> distant<00:06:55.440> objects<00:06:55.800> but<00:06:55.979> like<00:06:56.129> I

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:56.250 
seen is for distant objects but like I

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:58.850 
seen is for distant objects but like I
just<00:06:56.280> explained<00:06:56.879> they<00:06:56.970> also<00:06:57.120> have<00:06:57.419> them<00:06:57.860> if

00:06:58.850 --> 00:06:58.860 
just explained they also have them if

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:03.469 
just explained they also have them if
you<00:06:58.979> cannot<00:06:59.280> see<00:06:59.520> displays<00:07:00.110> and<00:07:01.940> if<00:07:02.940> you<00:07:03.150> don't

00:07:03.469 --> 00:07:03.479 
you cannot see displays and if you don't

00:07:03.479 --> 00:07:04.909 
you cannot see displays and if you don't
have<00:07:03.630> enough<00:07:03.870> vision<00:07:04.050> to<00:07:04.199> adequately<00:07:04.620> see

00:07:04.909 --> 00:07:04.919 
have enough vision to adequately see

00:07:04.919 --> 00:07:09.110 
have enough vision to adequately see
tiny<00:07:05.580> displays<00:07:07.340> that's<00:07:08.340> pretty<00:07:08.639> much<00:07:08.789> it

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:09.120 
tiny displays that's pretty much it

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:10.909 
tiny displays that's pretty much it
