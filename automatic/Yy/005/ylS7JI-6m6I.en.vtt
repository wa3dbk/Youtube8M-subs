00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.140
 the other episodes are already a plot 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.570

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.030
 the moment I keep you the surprise 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.470
 really until the day the video 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.950
 will come out so that should happen in no 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.049
 very long time I think that turn the 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.810
 video of tomorrow time to do the 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.399
 editing and all that surely will come a 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.659
 or two days later I'm not going I'm going 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.939
 not do it anyway 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.939
 I will not do for example the rfc d 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.530
 another video the same day I'm going I 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:59.110
 will keep it for a day where there is 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.720
 no video on the chain and neck 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.950
 gently I will resume a rhythm of 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.720
 videos anyway I'm going to do everything 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.020
 for 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:13.180
 and that's why I want to shoot and 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:15.280
 I have no idea validate the thing to do 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.080
 make you discover to test tried 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:21.040
 with you 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:24.480
 so no longer happy you then happy 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.709
 as for the rest 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.070
 for the rest of the stream 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:31.390
 Of course still on the game room this 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:34.630
 evening by the way I'm a stream have 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.370
 do the skyblog but team so we 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.739
 will be two will the planet team live this 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.500
 evening but it will be in team and will have 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:42.790
 several players several teams and I 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.100
 have understood that there will be 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.780
 challenge species to do and those who 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.610
 will have made the most challenges win 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.470
 trimmed there the trick 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.580
 from what I understood with that 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.340
 and rose told me just now I believe 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.680
 it's something like that 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.270
 you 're ok we'll see a little bit about it 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.670
 will give of course it's from 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.380
 20h always the same on my game chain 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.150
 therefore room moments dot tv slash 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:07.140
 sir billion you have now 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.130
 I think that's the habit so here 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.200
 it was especially that to warn you 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.790
 still that the chain of ming 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.430
 resumes service 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.680
 so here I did not make videos back 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.390
 ad chewing all that I think it 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.290
 is ultimately useless because the 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.220
 last time I made a video 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.989
 return youtube 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.340
 casually the video I made 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:28.150
 the year my faith any other youtube that 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:31.150
 is already eleven months eleven months almost a 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.370
 a year ago I was supposed to go back on 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.930
 youtube bah actually going to be demotivated 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.519
 very quickly because I still had 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.459
 troubles 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:41.230
 so here but in any case that's 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:44.489
 I was still full of 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.489
 projects in mind full of ideas 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:50.880
 that's ok so it's cool 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.050
 so I'm happy here I am 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.930
 happy but I have not fai videos 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:56.550
 back because I think it's used to 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.860
 nothing to make a pretense of redoing a 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.210
 video back while last time 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.440
 that I finished 2nd in the final return I 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:03.480
 not made videos for a long time 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.250
 so no I preferred it directly 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.670
 to leave again like that besides I was 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:10.350
 very surprised and very happy 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:13.110
 comments that I currently have 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:15.750
 any case for now on my video 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:18.959
 I was expecting a bit of as usual 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:21.209
 damage to a little bit and not a little bit 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.260
 jaded a little bit I'm not jealous 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.240
 all you can 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:27.330
 I do not really understand these people but 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.230
 which typical has each time crash in 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.940
 the comments of the cases a new 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.650
 video where anything but there I have not 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.480
 saw that I'm really very surprised and 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.020
 very happy anyway I hope it 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.430
 will last 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.630
 anyway this even if it's hard 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.880
 because I have people who are like that 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:41.850
 now I take my head over 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.260
 clearly I drink a comment to the 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:45.600
 con I mean when I say con con 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:48.840
 it's just a game by life and 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:50.460
 dead or the guy who remade videos 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:55.020
 for the tuque we will not be all 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:56.220
 two like that without meaning how to say 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.780
 non- constructive comments 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.240
 constructive does not necessarily mean 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.440
 positive but constructive I take myself 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.990
 not the head with these people there by that I 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:06.390
 you say I live abandons ban is in 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.590
 speak more we go to the next not me 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:08.520
 take the lead it's good I'm not here 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.050
 to take the lead I'm here to 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.150
 you make videos you go to do 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:14.850
 to spend a moment there I just wanted 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:17.310
 say one thing for the ftd everything is 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:18.890
 astonished the same night okay so you 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:21.540
 see some videos 

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:23.850
 especially the first ones are maybe 

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:25.500
 not how to say you may not have 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:27.680
 used to see it too much like that in 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:31.290
 video did you have to know two things 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:32.520
 the first being that it was already the 

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:34.940
 time savoyardes gerard moment 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:39.300
 frankly when we try to less 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:40.710
 three months easy at least so so 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:44.729
 I was in a moment where it was not going 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:48.060
 the ultra ouf in my personal life and more 

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:50.910
 of that I had to eat before turning 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.960
 so I was in full digestion and that 

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:54.449
 kicked me a bit 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.830
 So that's why some times 

00:05:54.449 --> 00:05:59.220
 you may have found what I 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:01.440
 make a little jaded or a little bit 

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:03.240
 I patrice all a little daddy at 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:05.430
 david jaud cleat you have the study 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:07.500
 our memories are just for that 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:09.810
 there's no worries worry about 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:11.099
 videos from after air stays and and 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:13.530
 after it's better 

00:06:11.099 --> 00:06:16.530
 already we feel that here we feel 

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:18.240
 ahead and that it's going better level of the blow 

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:20.400
 of bar of digestion in the sense that it 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:22.470
 go better so do not panic a step of 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.780
 worry the videos I'm going to turn 

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:25.169
 after that my hunger today the end 

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:28.289
 today 

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:30.630
 now tomorrow just like that I'll be 

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:32.729
 of course as usual at 

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:34.289
 know to cleat just as much as I can 

00:06:32.729 --> 00:06:35.430
 as much as possible is not it 

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:36.449
 so that's it for you 

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:38.159
 prevent because that's true when I have 

00:06:36.449 --> 00:06:40.020
 did the editing that found me a little 

00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:41.729
 a little bit dead a little bit 

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:43.500
 punctured and all a little bit here is not at 

00:06:41.729 --> 00:06:45.240
 cleat it's true that if it made me 

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:46.289
 a little weird I guess it 

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:48.120
 will make you a little weird also to 

00:06:46.289 --> 00:06:51.330
 you but do not panic 

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:53.280
 I just explained the reason 

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:55.770
 so people I'm going to tell you to 

00:06:53.280 --> 00:07:01.830
 tomorrow I make you from a coach 

00:06:55.770 --> 00:07:05.009
 pick it up there I do not know in 

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:05.250
 a box of iso full of rich of 

00:07:05.009 --> 00:07:07.770
 Swiss 

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:10.310
