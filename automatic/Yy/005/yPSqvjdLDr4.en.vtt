00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
episode episode there have been a bit

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.140 
episode episode there have been a bit
more<00:00:10.860> on<00:00:10.950> the<00:00:11.040> market<00:00:11.190> and<00:00:11.519> the<00:00:11.670> price<00:00:11.940> went

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
more on the market and the price went

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.900 
more on the market and the price went
down<00:00:12.300> so<00:00:13.290> I<00:00:13.320> managed<00:00:14.190> to<00:00:14.250> sell<00:00:14.519> them<00:00:14.639> on<00:00:14.759> and

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
down so I managed to sell them on and

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.340 
down so I managed to sell them on and
make<00:00:14.940> a<00:00:15.089> little<00:00:15.269> bit<00:00:15.420> of<00:00:15.450> profit<00:00:15.690> but<00:00:15.960> not<00:00:16.139> as

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
make a little bit of profit but not as

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.900 
make a little bit of profit but not as
much<00:00:16.680> because<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.520> market<00:00:17.789> got

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
much because the market got

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.849 
much because the market got
oversaturated<00:00:18.869> but<00:00:19.050> after<00:00:19.289> that<00:00:19.380> I<00:00:19.439> went<00:00:19.680> out

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
oversaturated but after that I went out

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.160 
oversaturated but after that I went out
and<00:00:20.070> bought<00:00:20.130> a<00:00:20.340> few<00:00:20.699> packs<00:00:21.090> because<00:00:21.750> I<00:00:21.900> had<00:00:22.140> a

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
and bought a few packs because I had a

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.779 
and bought a few packs because I had a
lot<00:00:22.350> of<00:00:22.410> FIFA<00:00:22.769> pods<00:00:22.980> remaining<00:00:23.550> from<00:00:23.730> the

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
lot of FIFA pods remaining from the

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.550 
lot of FIFA pods remaining from the
those<00:00:24.300> aboard<00:00:24.660> in<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:24.900> start<00:00:25.170> of<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.410> game

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
those aboard in the start of the game

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.349 
those aboard in the start of the game
and<00:00:25.740> I<00:00:25.800> never<00:00:26.010> went<00:00:26.189> on<00:00:26.340> to<00:00:26.490> use<00:00:26.670> them<00:00:26.910> so<00:00:27.330> I

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
and I never went on to use them so I

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.750 
and I never went on to use them so I
decided<00:00:27.660> I'd<00:00:27.930> be<00:00:28.109> using<00:00:28.380> opening<00:00:29.310> four<00:00:29.519> packs

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
decided I'd be using opening four packs

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.460 
decided I'd be using opening four packs
every<00:00:30.029> time<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.240> new<00:00:30.359> team<00:00:30.720> of<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.990> week<00:00:31.140> is<00:00:31.320> out

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
every time a new team of the week is out

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.290 
every time a new team of the week is out
and<00:00:31.769> until<00:00:32.340> all<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.610> points<00:00:32.880> are<00:00:32.969> used<00:00:33.090> up

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
and until all the points are used up

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.030 
and until all the points are used up
then<00:00:33.630> I<00:00:33.660> will<00:00:33.809> rely<00:00:34.200> on<00:00:34.230> trading<00:00:34.710> from<00:00:34.829> there

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
then I will rely on trading from there

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.920 
then I will rely on trading from there
on<00:00:35.219> so<00:00:35.850> as<00:00:35.910> you<00:00:36.000> can<00:00:36.059> see<00:00:36.120> here<00:00:36.450> I<00:00:36.630> do<00:00:36.690> not

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
on so as you can see here I do not

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.630 
on so as you can see here I do not
really<00:00:37.230> get<00:00:37.440> anything<00:00:37.920> good<00:00:38.250> from<00:00:38.399> these

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
really get anything good from these

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.660 
really get anything good from these
packs<00:00:39.000> and<00:00:39.590> that's<00:00:40.590> pretty<00:00:40.800> much<00:00:40.920> how<00:00:41.040> my<00:00:41.430> pack

and<00:00:57.570> you<00:00:57.989> can<00:00:58.020> probably<00:00:58.469> guess<00:00:58.739> what<00:00:58.949> is<00:00:59.070> going

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
and you can probably guess what is going

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.250 
and you can probably guess what is going
to<00:00:59.370> happen<00:00:59.609> i'm<00:00:59.879> going<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.359> build<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:00.750> new<00:01:00.930> team

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
to happen i'm going to build a new team

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.560 
to happen i'm going to build a new team
and<00:01:01.550> that<00:01:02.550> it's<00:01:02.760> going<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:03.030> be<00:01:03.210> around<00:01:03.420> the

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
and that it's going to be around the

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.299 
and that it's going to be around the
forefront<00:01:04.080> one<00:01:04.260> formation<00:01:04.739> because<00:01:04.979> i<00:01:05.010> wanted

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
forefront one formation because i wanted

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.190 
forefront one formation because i wanted
to<00:01:05.369> try<00:01:05.610> something<00:01:05.880> new<00:01:06.030> try<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.750> have<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:06.990> bit

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
to try something new try to have a bit

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.840 
to try something new try to have a bit
more<00:01:07.350> better<00:01:07.619> chemistry<00:01:08.189> on<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.340> team<00:01:08.640> and

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
more better chemistry on the team and

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.440 
more better chemistry on the team and
i'm<00:01:09.420> probably<00:01:09.780> not<00:01:09.990> going<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.439> buy<00:01:10.590> back<00:01:10.830> a

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
i'm probably not going to buy back a

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.250 
i'm probably not going to buy back a
ibrahimovic<00:01:12.450> because<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:12.960> have<00:01:13.110> to

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
ibrahimovic because you have to

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.289 
ibrahimovic because you have to
sacrifice<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:14.130> get<00:01:14.430> nine<00:01:14.640> chemistry<00:01:15.060> out<00:01:15.180> of

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
sacrifice to get nine chemistry out of

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.780 
sacrifice to get nine chemistry out of
him<00:01:15.509> so<00:01:16.020> you<00:01:16.080> see<00:01:16.470> yeah<00:01:16.680> i<00:01:16.799> bit<00:01:17.009> on<00:01:17.159> tumor<00:01:17.580> cells

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.580 
him so you see yeah i bit on tumor cells
which<00:01:18.150> go<00:01:18.390> up<00:01:18.540> for<00:01:18.990> too<00:01:19.140> much<00:01:19.290> for<00:01:19.470> my<00:01:19.560> liking

and then i pick up a cheaper one which
just<00:01:22.020> shows<00:01:22.110> if<00:01:22.470> you're<00:01:22.619> patient<00:01:22.860> you<00:01:23.130> can

and<00:04:19.419> I<00:04:20.019> thought<00:04:20.230> I<00:04:20.530> don't<00:04:20.950> know<00:04:21.220> I<00:04:21.280> do<00:04:21.489> not<00:04:21.640> have

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:21.700 
and I thought I don't know I do not have

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.969 
and I thought I don't know I do not have
pure<00:04:22.180> anymore<00:04:22.600> but<00:04:22.900> I<00:04:22.930> still<00:04:23.080> have<00:04:23.440> a<00:04:23.470> multi

so<00:04:26.770> he<00:04:27.070> steps<00:04:27.340> up<00:04:27.490> and<00:04:27.730> he<00:04:28.000> hits<00:04:28.240> it<00:04:28.450> not<00:04:29.290> the

up<00:05:25.120> one<00:05:25.390> too<00:05:25.660> but<00:05:26.350> I<00:05:26.410> still<00:05:26.470> felt<00:05:26.830> I<00:05:27.040> had<00:05:27.280> the

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:27.400 
up one too but I still felt I had the

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.430 
up one too but I still felt I had the
control<00:05:27.820> of<00:05:27.850> the<00:05:28.060> game<00:05:28.240> and<00:05:28.540> I<00:05:28.840> kept<00:05:29.170> on<00:05:29.260> doing

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:29.440 
control of the game and I kept on doing

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.920 
control of the game and I kept on doing
skill<00:05:29.890> moves<00:05:30.100> not<00:05:30.340> trying<00:05:30.700> to<00:05:30.880> to<00:05:31.510> score<00:05:31.780> when

it<00:05:31.960> never<00:05:32.350> had<00:05:32.620> the<00:05:32.770> chance<00:05:32.980> because<00:05:33.430> I<00:05:33.670> felt

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:34.450 
it never had the chance because I felt

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:36.330 
it never had the chance because I felt
if<00:05:34.630> he<00:05:34.780> he<00:05:35.050> got<00:05:35.260> another<00:05:35.530> goal<00:05:35.740> I<00:05:35.950> would<00:05:36.190> be

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:36.340 
if he he got another goal I would be

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.280 
if he he got another goal I would be
able<00:05:36.490> to<00:05:36.670> get<00:05:37.000> another<00:05:37.270> goal<00:05:37.510> as<00:05:37.690> well<00:05:37.870> because

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:38.290 
able to get another goal as well because

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:40.200 
able to get another goal as well because
I<00:05:38.500> felt<00:05:38.950> he<00:05:39.100> wasn't<00:05:39.280> the<00:05:39.460> strongest<00:05:39.520> guy<00:05:40.060> in

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:40.210 
I felt he wasn't the strongest guy in

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:42.570 
I felt he wasn't the strongest guy in
the<00:05:40.300> defense<00:05:40.630> so<00:05:41.170> I<00:05:41.500> just<00:05:41.710> kept<00:05:42.010> on<00:05:42.130> doing<00:05:42.220> all

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:42.580 
the defense so I just kept on doing all

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:43.890 
the defense so I just kept on doing all
those<00:05:42.730> skill<00:05:43.000> moves<00:05:43.150> and<00:05:43.300> you<00:05:43.360> see<00:05:43.510> me<00:05:43.600> here
