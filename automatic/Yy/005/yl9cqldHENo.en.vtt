and deflect puffs from coming up from
the<00:01:30.320> corners<00:01:30.770> you<00:01:31.100> can<00:01:31.160> make<00:01:31.640> a<00:01:31.670> save<00:01:31.910> from<00:01:32.030> a

the corners you can make a save from a
seated<00:01:32.390> position<00:01:32.480> so<00:01:33.410> there's<00:01:33.590> a<00:01:33.650> lot<00:01:33.740> more

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:33.800 
seated position so there's a lot more

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.590 
seated position so there's a lot more
stuff<00:01:34.310> that<00:01:34.520> you<00:01:34.580> can<00:01:34.700> do<00:01:34.850> that<00:01:35.060> would<00:01:35.450> give

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
stuff that you can do that would give

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.790 
stuff that you can do that would give
you<00:01:35.720> a<00:01:35.750> little<00:01:35.990> more<00:01:36.080> control<00:01:36.410> over<00:01:36.530> the

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:36.800 
you a little more control over the

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.890 
you a little more control over the
goalie<00:01:37.040> so<00:01:37.550> we<00:01:37.700> really<00:01:37.880> brought<00:01:38.330> that<00:01:38.390> out<00:01:38.600> and

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
goalie so we really brought that out and

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.570 
goalie so we really brought that out and
we<00:01:38.960> think<00:01:39.170> it's<00:01:39.290> going<00:01:39.410> to<00:01:39.470> be<00:01:39.530> a<00:01:39.680> huge<00:01:40.130> thing

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
we think it's going to be a huge thing

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:50.910 
we think it's going to be a huge thing
that<00:01:40.760> our<00:01:40.850> consumers<00:01:41.240> will<00:01:41.390> love

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920
