00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
right here this is where you can tell

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.390 
right here this is where you can tell
the<00:02:23.870> rounds<00:02:24.380> are<00:02:24.470> impacting<00:02:24.980> it's<00:02:25.160> kind<00:02:25.340> of

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
the rounds are impacting it's kind of

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.650 
the rounds are impacting it's kind of
got<00:02:25.520> only<00:02:25.640> a<00:02:25.670> little<00:02:25.910> bit<00:02:26.000> of<00:02:26.090> a<00:02:26.150> lighter<00:02:26.360> color

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
got only a little bit of a lighter color

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.010 
got only a little bit of a lighter color
here<00:02:26.960> but<00:02:27.860> uh<00:02:28.450> normally<00:02:29.450> that<00:02:29.600> would<00:02:29.720> be<00:02:29.750> your

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
here but uh normally that would be your

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.960 
here but uh normally that would be your
paint<00:02:30.290> it<00:02:30.470> would<00:02:30.590> be<00:02:30.680> basically<00:02:31.250> disappearing

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
paint it would be basically disappearing

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.870 
paint it would be basically disappearing
it's<00:02:32.450> this<00:02:32.570> mark<00:02:32.900> right<00:02:33.110> here<00:02:33.220> so<00:02:34.220> if<00:02:34.580> you<00:02:34.700> put

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
it's this mark right here so if you put

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.220 
it's this mark right here so if you put
on<00:02:34.970> the<00:02:35.180> velcro<00:02:35.330> obviously<00:02:35.870> you<00:02:35.960> don't<00:02:36.110> need

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
on the velcro obviously you don't need

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.930 
on the velcro obviously you don't need
to<00:02:36.320> do<00:02:36.440> this<00:02:36.590> strip<00:02:36.890> I<00:02:37.130> just<00:02:37.490> did<00:02:37.640> that<00:02:37.790> just

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
to do this strip I just did that just

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.670 
to do this strip I just did that just
for<00:02:38.150> you<00:02:38.360> know<00:02:38.480> looks<00:02:39.020> because<00:02:39.320> I<00:02:39.440> thought<00:02:39.590> it

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
for you know looks because I thought it

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.800 
for you know looks because I thought it
looked<00:02:39.800> a<00:02:39.890> little<00:02:39.980> cooler<00:02:40.310> but<00:02:41.240> honestly<00:02:41.660> if

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
looked a little cooler but honestly if

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.210 
looked a little cooler but honestly if
you<00:02:41.900> just<00:02:42.050> did<00:02:42.200> like<00:02:42.230> this<00:02:42.500> small<00:02:42.770> patch<00:02:42.980> right

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
you just did like this small patch right

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.460 
you just did like this small patch right
here<00:02:43.400> you'd<00:02:43.580> probably<00:02:43.610> be<00:02:44.030> like<00:02:44.960> perfectly

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
here you'd probably be like perfectly

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.110 
here you'd probably be like perfectly
fine<00:02:45.650> wouldn't<00:02:46.610> have<00:02:46.700> to<00:02:46.760> worry<00:02:46.880> about<00:02:46.970> the

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
fine wouldn't have to worry about the

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.300 
fine wouldn't have to worry about the
brass<00:02:47.300> hitting<00:02:47.600> it<00:02:47.720> some<00:02:48.620> people<00:02:48.800> say<00:02:49.100> there's

just<00:03:26.450> by<00:03:26.540> doing<00:03:26.570> that<00:03:26.870> you<00:03:27.140> might<00:03:27.290> save<00:03:27.590> some

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:27.800 
just by doing that you might save some

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.680 
just by doing that you might save some
time<00:03:27.980> and<00:03:28.010> on<00:03:28.580> denting<00:03:29.180> this<00:03:29.330> thing<00:03:29.480> if<00:03:29.600> you

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
time and on denting this thing if you

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.450 
time and on denting this thing if you
guys<00:03:29.840> are<00:03:30.080> one<00:03:30.350> of<00:03:30.440> those<00:03:30.560> reloading<00:03:31.280> type

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:31.460 
guys are one of those reloading type

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:34.120 
guys are one of those reloading type
people<00:03:31.780> but<00:03:32.780> this<00:03:33.380> was<00:03:33.560> fired<00:03:33.770> out<00:03:33.950> of<00:03:33.980> the

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
people but this was fired out of the

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.030 
people but this was fired out of the
sink<00:03:34.430> and<00:03:34.700> you<00:03:34.760> can<00:03:34.970> clearly<00:03:35.420> tell<00:03:35.890> because<00:03:36.890> of

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
sink and you can clearly tell because of

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.500 
sink and you can clearly tell because of
how<00:03:37.130> this<00:03:37.250> thing<00:03:37.430> is<00:03:37.460> dead<00:03:37.790> deformed<00:03:38.240> a<00:03:38.300> little

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
how this thing is dead deformed a little

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.990 
how this thing is dead deformed a little
bit<00:03:38.770> but<00:03:39.770> other<00:03:40.070> than<00:03:40.280> that<00:03:40.370> I<00:03:40.490> mean<00:03:40.670> there<00:03:40.910> was

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.050 
it's been meant to work for years but

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:08.050

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:11.240 
range report of how the thing performed

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:12.880 
range report of how the thing performed
off<00:04:11.420> its<00:04:11.630> first<00:04:11.900> shots<00:04:12.140> without<00:04:12.500> citing

that's<00:04:19.280> shooting<00:04:19.820> at<00:04:20.060> the<00:04:20.210> furthest<00:04:20.660> range<00:04:20.900> I

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:21.020 
that's shooting at the furthest range I

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:24.370 
that's shooting at the furthest range I
could<00:04:21.170> possibly<00:04:21.560> shoot<00:04:21.799> at<00:04:22.010> in<00:04:22.250> my<00:04:22.400> range<00:04:23.380> this

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
could possibly shoot at in my range this

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.060 
could possibly shoot at in my range this
one<00:04:24.590> that<00:04:25.400> was<00:04:25.580> me<00:04:25.790> I<00:04:25.970> jerked

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
one that was me I jerked

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.610 
one that was me I jerked
a<00:04:27.570> poll<00:04:28.570> a<00:04:28.600> little<00:04:28.870> bit<00:04:28.960> too<00:04:29.080> much<00:04:29.290> because<00:04:29.500> I

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
a poll a little bit too much because I

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.100 
a poll a little bit too much because I
was<00:04:29.740> trying<00:04:29.890> to<00:04:30.040> transition<00:04:30.520> from<00:04:30.550> using<00:04:31.110> my

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
was trying to transition from using my

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.340 
was trying to transition from using my
hand<00:04:32.350> right<00:04:32.590> here<00:04:32.890> to<00:04:33.460> here<00:04:33.730> and<00:04:34.060> obviously<00:04:35.050> I

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
hand right here to here and obviously I

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:36.960 
hand right here to here and obviously I
accidentally<00:04:35.800> popped<00:04:35.980> one<00:04:36.160> so<00:04:36.550> that's<00:04:36.790> my

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
accidentally popped one so that's my

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.540 
accidentally popped one so that's my
fault<00:04:37.110> but<00:04:38.110> these<00:04:38.530> ones<00:04:38.620> up<00:04:38.800> here<00:04:38.860> the<00:04:39.400> reason

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
fault but these ones up here the reason

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.220 
fault but these ones up here the reason
they're<00:04:39.760> so<00:04:39.910> spread<00:04:40.180> out<00:04:40.210> because<00:04:40.600> I<00:04:40.990> just

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:41.230 
they're so spread out because I just

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:42.120 
they're so spread out because I just
wanted<00:04:41.410> to<00:04:41.530> see<00:04:41.680> where<00:04:41.800> they<00:04:41.890> were<00:04:41.980> hitting

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
wanted to see where they were hitting

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:44.460 
wanted to see where they were hitting
and<00:04:42.480> obviously<00:04:43.480> with<00:04:43.660> red<00:04:43.870> targets<00:04:44.200> a<00:04:44.260> little

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
and obviously with red targets a little

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:45.900 
and obviously with red targets a little
easier<00:04:44.740> to<00:04:44.890> see<00:04:45.340> where<00:04:45.460> you're<00:04:45.550> hitting<00:04:45.700> from

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
easier to see where you're hitting from

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:49.710 
easier to see where you're hitting from
far<00:04:46.380> but<00:04:47.380> this<00:04:48.220> is<00:04:48.370> where<00:04:48.550> all<00:04:49.000> the<00:04:49.480> shots

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
far but this is where all the shots

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.300 
far but this is where all the shots
count<00:04:49.960> where<00:04:50.290> I<00:04:50.320> actually<00:04:50.530> try<00:04:50.830> to<00:04:50.890> sit<00:04:51.130> there

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
count where I actually try to sit there

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.330 
count where I actually try to sit there
and<00:04:51.520> put<00:04:52.210> them<00:04:52.390> here<00:04:52.690> and<00:04:53.650> this<00:04:53.950> is<00:04:54.040> obviously

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
and put them here and this is obviously

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.010 
and put them here and this is obviously
doing<00:04:54.580> it<00:04:54.760> from<00:04:54.880> a<00:04:54.970> standing<00:04:55.300> position<00:04:55.360> not<00:04:55.990> a

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
doing it from a standing position not a

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.040 
doing it from a standing position not a
prone<00:04:56.380> or<00:04:56.410> a<00:04:56.770> kneeling<00:04:57.610> position<00:04:57.760> this<00:04:58.480> is<00:04:58.690> all

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
prone or a kneeling position this is all

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.590 
prone or a kneeling position this is all
unsupported<00:04:59.860> and<00:05:00.010> you<00:05:00.910> know<00:05:01.000> obviously<00:05:01.270> the

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:01.600 
unsupported and you know obviously the

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.810 
unsupported and you know obviously the
natural<00:05:02.560> breathing<00:05:03.040> pattern<00:05:03.400> you<00:05:03.490> could<00:05:03.640> tell

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
natural breathing pattern you could tell

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:07.500 
natural breathing pattern you could tell
but<00:05:04.860> that's<00:05:05.860> without<00:05:06.310> sighting<00:05:06.850> anything<00:05:07.330> in

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:07.510 
but that's without sighting anything in

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:10.500 
but that's without sighting anything in
so<00:05:08.310> obviously<00:05:09.310> if<00:05:09.490> I<00:05:09.640> ever<00:05:09.790> take<00:05:10.030> it<00:05:10.150> out<00:05:10.240> again

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:10.510 
so obviously if I ever take it out again

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:11.940 
so obviously if I ever take it out again
I'm<00:05:10.690> probably<00:05:10.840> gonna<00:05:11.020> bring<00:05:11.140> like<00:05:11.260> a<00:05:11.380> bipod<00:05:11.800> or

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:11.950 
I'm probably gonna bring like a bipod or

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:13.770 
I'm probably gonna bring like a bipod or
something<00:05:12.310> or<00:05:12.400> arrest<00:05:12.760> and<00:05:13.090> definitely<00:05:13.660> try

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:13.780 
something or arrest and definitely try

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:15.060 
something or arrest and definitely try
to<00:05:13.840> Susie<00:05:14.200> rode<00:05:14.350> him<00:05:14.470> a<00:05:14.500> little<00:05:14.830> bit<00:05:14.920> better

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:15.070 
to Susie rode him a little bit better

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:18.060 
to Susie rode him a little bit better
but<00:05:15.930> being<00:05:16.930> that<00:05:17.020> that<00:05:17.170> was<00:05:17.260> that<00:05:17.440> I<00:05:17.800> think<00:05:18.010> it

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:18.070 
but being that that was that I think it

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:23.310 
but being that that was that I think it
was<00:05:18.160> 75<00:05:18.880> feet<00:05:19.210> with<00:05:20.170> just<00:05:20.830> the<00:05:20.980> EOTech<00:05:21.340> and<00:05:22.320> no

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:23.320 
was 75 feet with just the EOTech and no

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.410 
was 75 feet with just the EOTech and no
sighting<00:05:23.740> it<00:05:23.860> in<00:05:24.010> that's<00:05:24.490> pretty<00:05:25.000> much<00:05:25.150> how<00:05:25.300> it

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:25.420 
sighting it in that's pretty much how it

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:28.020 
sighting it in that's pretty much how it
performed<00:05:25.870> you<00:05:26.770> know<00:05:26.920> I'll<00:05:27.280> just<00:05:27.580> grow<00:05:28.000> a

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.030 
performed you know I'll just grow a

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:29.280 
performed you know I'll just grow a
little<00:05:28.270> bit<00:05:28.450> so<00:05:28.570> you<00:05:28.690> can<00:05:28.720> kind<00:05:29.020> of<00:05:29.050> see<00:05:29.200> it

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:29.290 
little bit so you can kind of see it

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:32.630 
little bit so you can kind of see it
more<00:05:29.850> but<00:05:30.850> I<00:05:31.180> would<00:05:31.630> definitely<00:05:31.960> say<00:05:32.110> that

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:32.640 
more but I would definitely say that

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.130 
more but I would definitely say that
being<00:05:33.640> that<00:05:33.730> I<00:05:33.910> didn't<00:05:34.120> have<00:05:34.240> to<00:05:34.360> zero<00:05:34.750> this<00:05:34.930> in

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:35.140 
being that I didn't have to zero this in

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:37.140 
being that I didn't have to zero this in
at<00:05:35.380> all<00:05:35.530> I<00:05:35.800> would<00:05:36.370> definitely<00:05:36.700> say<00:05:36.880> that's

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:37.150 
at all I would definitely say that's

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.480 
at all I would definitely say that's
probably<00:05:37.330> the<00:05:37.960> best<00:05:38.140> performance<00:05:38.560> I've<00:05:38.710> got<00:05:39.190> I

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.490 
probably the best performance I've got I

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:42.960 
probably the best performance I've got I
did<00:05:40.390> try<00:05:40.630> and<00:05:40.690> shoot<00:05:40.960> my<00:05:41.340> my<00:05:42.340> new<00:05:42.490> Smith<00:05:42.910> &amp;

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:42.970 
did try and shoot my my new Smith &amp;

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:46.320 
did try and shoot my my new Smith &amp;
Wesson<00:05:43.390> that<00:05:43.510> I<00:05:43.570> got<00:05:43.750> in<00:05:44.290> a<00:05:44.410> trade<00:05:44.710> and<00:05:45.070> I<00:05:45.490> mean

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:46.330 
Wesson that I got in a trade and I mean

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.720 
Wesson that I got in a trade and I mean
it<00:05:46.420> was<00:05:46.510> a<00:05:46.570> little<00:05:46.810> a<00:05:47.050> little<00:05:47.980> too<00:05:48.130> low<00:05:48.340> and<00:05:48.640> to

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:48.730 
it was a little a little too low and to

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:50.340 
it was a little a little too low and to
the<00:05:48.760> left<00:05:49.030> so<00:05:49.420> that<00:05:49.600> one's<00:05:49.720> got<00:05:49.900> to<00:05:49.990> be<00:05:50.020> sighted

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:50.350 
the left so that one's got to be sighted

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:53.460 
the left so that one's got to be sighted
in<00:05:50.470> but<00:05:50.740> the<00:05:51.670> man<00:05:51.850> before<00:05:52.030> me<00:05:52.330> he<00:05:52.870> only<00:05:53.140> cited

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:53.470 
in but the man before me he only cited

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:56.280 
in but the man before me he only cited
in<00:05:53.590> the<00:05:53.680> EOTech<00:05:53.920> not<00:05:54.430> the<00:05:54.580> AR<00:05:55.240> so<00:05:55.690> obviously

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:56.290 
in the EOTech not the AR so obviously

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:58.020 
in the EOTech not the AR so obviously
the<00:05:56.890> irons<00:05:57.160> are<00:05:57.280> gonna<00:05:57.370> be<00:05:57.550> a<00:05:57.580> little<00:05:57.670> bit<00:05:57.880> off

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:58.030
