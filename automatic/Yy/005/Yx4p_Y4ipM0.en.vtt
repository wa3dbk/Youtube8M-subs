something<00:00:43.570> I<00:00:45.270> found<00:00:46.270> this<00:00:46.540> and<00:00:46.809> I<00:00:46.960> bought<00:00:47.290> it

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
something I found this and I bought it

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.000

knowing<00:00:48.730> that<00:00:48.910> piece<00:00:49.480> of<00:00:49.809> but<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:50.920> be

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010 
knowing that piece of but to be

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.280 
knowing that piece of but to be

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:00.540 
blue blue and the gray is tolerable but

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.780 
blue blue and the gray is tolerable but
but<00:01:01.540> we<00:01:01.690> all<00:01:01.839> know<00:01:02.050> what<00:01:02.320> this<00:01:02.470> thing<00:01:02.800> is<00:01:02.829> most

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:03.790 
but we all know what this thing is most

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.870
