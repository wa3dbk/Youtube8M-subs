00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420 
traditional lair of a sound and brings a

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:47.789 
traditional lair of a sound and brings a
little<00:00:46.629> bit<00:00:46.720> more<00:00:46.870> of<00:00:46.930> that<00:00:46.989> openness<00:00:47.530> that

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:47.799 
little bit more of that openness that

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:49.530 
little bit more of that openness that
you<00:00:47.920> get<00:00:48.070> from<00:00:48.220> a<00:00:48.309> vintage<00:00:48.640> guitar

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:49.540 
you get from a vintage guitar

you get from a vintage guitar
let's<00:00:50.170> also<00:00:50.350> play<00:00:50.680> with<00:00:50.860> a<00:00:50.890> flat<00:00:51.159> pick<00:00:51.400> and<00:00:51.580> can

00:00:51.689 --> 00:00:51.699 
let's also play with a flat pick and can

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:53.670 
let's also play with a flat pick and can
I<00:00:51.729> see<00:00:51.940> what<00:00:52.089> that<00:00:52.239> sounds<00:00:52.570> like<00:00:52.629> I'm<00:00:53.470> going<00:00:53.589> to

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:53.680 
I see what that sounds like I'm going to

00:00:53.680 --> 00:01:02.250 
I see what that sounds like I'm going to
strum<00:00:54.129> it<00:00:54.250> a<00:00:54.309> little<00:00:54.489> bit

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:15.940 

you

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.990 

you<00:01:16.950> can<00:01:17.070> probably<00:01:17.160> tell<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.580> guitar<00:01:17.850> gets

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
you can probably tell the guitar gets

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.840 
you can probably tell the guitar gets
quite<00:01:18.270> loud<00:01:18.540> really<00:01:19.160> if<00:01:20.160> you<00:01:20.340> haven't<00:01:20.640> played

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
quite loud really if you haven't played

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.910 
quite loud really if you haven't played
small<00:01:21.780> bodied<00:01:22.080> guitars<00:01:22.410> like<00:01:22.650> there's<00:01:22.830> a

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
small bodied guitars like there's a

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.220 
small bodied guitars like there's a
medium<00:01:23.190> sized<00:01:23.400> body<00:01:23.700> guitars<00:01:24.120> you<00:01:24.990> might<00:01:25.110> be

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:25.230 
medium sized body guitars you might be

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:26.780 
medium sized body guitars you might be
surprised<00:01:25.590> by<00:01:25.740> how<00:01:25.860> much<00:01:25.980> volume<00:01:26.220> you<00:01:26.430> can<00:01:26.610> get

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
surprised by how much volume you can get

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.730 
surprised by how much volume you can get
not<00:01:27.000> so<00:01:27.030> much<00:01:27.330> dynamic<00:01:27.570> range<00:01:28.110> some<00:01:28.500> of<00:01:28.620> that

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
not so much dynamic range some of that

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.770 
not so much dynamic range some of that
really<00:01:29.010> is<00:01:29.220> attributed<00:01:30.150> to<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.300> fact<00:01:30.660> that

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
really is attributed to the fact that

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.230 
really is attributed to the fact that
Larry's<00:01:31.260> really<00:01:31.500> designed<00:01:31.890> this<00:01:32.100> guitar<00:01:32.520> with

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
Larry's really designed this guitar with

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.090 
Larry's really designed this guitar with
that<00:01:33.720> kind<00:01:33.930> of<00:01:33.960> dynamic<00:01:34.170> range<00:01:34.710> and

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
that kind of dynamic range and

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.170 
that kind of dynamic range and
versatility<00:01:35.790> in<00:01:36.120> mind<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:37.380> neck<00:01:37.800> is<00:01:38.730> fairly
