writer's block and those are two things

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.569 
writer's block and those are two things
that<00:00:51.120> I<00:00:51.239> think<00:00:51.329> about<00:00:51.690> a<00:00:51.840> lot<00:00:52.140> so<00:00:52.530> that's<00:00:53.340> what

I'm<00:00:53.670> going<00:00:53.820> to<00:00:53.850> be<00:00:53.969> talking<00:00:54.300> about<00:00:54.390> this<00:00:54.629> week

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
I'm going to be talking about this week

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.849 
I'm going to be talking about this week
so<00:00:55.710> I<00:00:56.120> write<00:00:57.120> several<00:00:57.809> different<00:00:58.230> styles<00:00:58.710> of

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
so I write several different styles of

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.740 
so I write several different styles of
things<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.460> the<00:01:00.120> ones<00:01:00.329> that<00:01:00.480> are<00:01:00.570> most

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
things and the ones that are most

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.130 
things and the ones that are most
visible<00:01:00.899> online<00:01:01.530> are<00:01:02.309> my<00:01:02.670> poetry<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.449> my<00:01:03.870> rap

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
visible online are my poetry and my rap

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.649 
visible online are my poetry and my rap
and<00:01:04.439> I<00:01:05.159> approach<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.970> two<00:01:06.150> sort<00:01:06.600> of

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
and I approach the two sort of

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.550 
and I approach the two sort of
differently<00:01:07.049> because<00:01:07.820> in<00:01:08.820> my<00:01:09.000> poetry<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:09.840> in

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
differently because in my poetry and in

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.740 
differently because in my poetry and in
spoken<00:01:10.830> word<00:01:11.100> in<00:01:11.280> general<00:01:11.760> I<00:01:12.030> think<00:01:12.479> that

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
spoken word in general I think that

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.649 
spoken word in general I think that
there's<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.700> gravitation<00:01:14.700> towards<00:01:14.939> pieces

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
there's a gravitation towards pieces

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.600 
there's a gravitation towards pieces
that<00:01:16.080> are<00:01:16.320> centered<00:01:16.890> around<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:17.189> message

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
that are centered around a message

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.690 
that are centered around a message
and/or<00:01:18.140> a<00:01:19.140> premise<00:01:19.680> of<00:01:19.890> some<00:01:20.189> sort<00:01:20.460> and

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
and/or a premise of some sort and

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.880 
and/or a premise of some sort and
sometimes<00:01:21.570> my<00:01:21.720> songs<00:01:22.020> are<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:22.409> little<00:01:22.650> bit<00:01:22.860> more

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
sometimes my songs are a little bit more

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.700 
sometimes my songs are a little bit more
free-flowing<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:23.909> they<00:01:24.570> can<00:01:24.720> hop<00:01:24.930> from<00:01:24.960> one

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
free-flowing and they can hop from one

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.039 
free-flowing and they can hop from one
idea<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.159> next<00:01:26.280> but<00:01:26.880> with<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.060> poem<00:01:27.360> I<00:01:27.630> have

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
idea to the next but with a poem I have

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.690 
idea to the next but with a poem I have
a<00:01:28.080> strong<00:01:28.409> premise<00:01:28.829> before<00:01:29.130> I<00:01:29.159> even<00:01:29.340> sit<00:01:29.670> down

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
a strong premise before I even sit down

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.050 
a strong premise before I even sit down
to<00:01:30.090> write<00:01:30.240> for<00:01:31.049> instance<00:01:31.439> my<00:01:32.100> list<00:01:32.369> poem<00:01:32.729> I

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
to write for instance my list poem I

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.420 
to write for instance my list poem I
know<00:01:33.270> that<00:01:33.750> I<00:01:33.960> want<00:01:34.259> to<00:01:34.350> attack<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.979> subject

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
know that I want to attack the subject

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.359 
know that I want to attack the subject
of<00:01:35.840> my<00:01:36.840> Lisp<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.350> I<00:01:37.500> know<00:01:37.560> that<00:01:37.860> I<00:01:37.890> want<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.220> do

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
of my Lisp and I know that I want to do

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.520 
of my Lisp and I know that I want to do
it<00:01:38.520> in<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:38.759> way<00:01:38.970> that<00:01:39.270> draws<00:01:39.960> it<00:01:40.140> where<00:01:40.439> the

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
it in a way that draws it where the

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.590 
it in a way that draws it where the
forum<00:01:40.860> draws<00:01:41.130> attention<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:42.180> subject

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
forum draws attention to the subject

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.539 
forum draws attention to the subject
matter<00:01:42.659> so<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.710> idea<00:01:43.950> of<00:01:44.009> using<00:01:44.100> alliteration

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
matter so the idea of using alliteration

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.560 
matter so the idea of using alliteration
isn't<00:01:45.390> just<00:01:45.659> a<00:01:45.950> coincidence<00:01:46.950> it's<00:01:47.399> also<00:01:47.640> built

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
isn't just a coincidence it's also built

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.630 
isn't just a coincidence it's also built
into<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.899> message<00:01:49.259> of<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.439> piece<00:01:49.619> so<00:01:50.250> once<00:01:50.490> I

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
into the message of the piece so once I

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.910 
into the message of the piece so once I
know<00:01:50.700> that<00:01:50.850> I<00:01:51.329> wanted<00:01:51.780> that's<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.530> function

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
know that I wanted that's the function

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.789 
know that I wanted that's the function
of<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.100> piece<00:01:53.340> then<00:01:53.700> I<00:01:54.000> start<00:01:54.869> what's<00:01:55.619> called

you<00:02:07.740> possibly<00:02:08.310> can<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:09.050> it's<00:02:10.050> great<00:02:10.349> for<00:02:10.560> a

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
you possibly can and it's great for a

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.680 
you possibly can and it's great for a
couple<00:02:10.830> of<00:02:11.009> reasons<00:02:11.220> first<00:02:12.000> of<00:02:12.209> all<00:02:12.300> it<00:02:12.480> deals

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
couple of reasons first of all it deals

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.880 
couple of reasons first of all it deals
with<00:02:12.780> writer's<00:02:13.200> block

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
with writer's block

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.760 
with writer's block
because<00:02:14.250> once<00:02:14.940> you<00:02:15.180> have<00:02:15.780> embraced<00:02:16.380> free

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
because once you have embraced free

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:17.120 
because once you have embraced free
writing

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
writing

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.160 
writing
you<00:02:17.340> never<00:02:17.580> have<00:02:17.790> writer's<00:02:18.120> block<00:02:18.150> again<00:02:18.720> and

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
you never have writer's block again and

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.670 
you never have writer's block again and
I<00:02:19.860> think<00:02:20.670> a<00:02:20.730> lot<00:02:20.880> of<00:02:20.910> times<00:02:21.210> people<00:02:21.680> believe

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
I think a lot of times people believe

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.620 
I think a lot of times people believe
they<00:02:22.830> have<00:02:22.980> writer's<00:02:23.280> block<00:02:23.310> but<00:02:24.180> what<00:02:24.420> they

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
they have writer's block but what they

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.510 
they have writer's block but what they
are<00:02:24.660> doing<00:02:24.870> is<00:02:25.470> censoring<00:02:25.980> themselves

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
are doing is censoring themselves

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.700 
are doing is censoring themselves
because<00:02:27.240> they<00:02:27.420> think<00:02:27.480> that<00:02:27.750> the<00:02:28.020> ideas<00:02:28.470> that

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
because they think that the ideas that

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.170 
because they think that the ideas that
they're<00:02:28.830> getting<00:02:29.070> on<00:02:29.160> the<00:02:29.250> page<00:02:29.460> aren't<00:02:29.940> good

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
they're getting on the page aren't good

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.110 
they're getting on the page aren't good
enough<00:02:30.210> and<00:02:30.690> the<00:02:31.650> fact<00:02:31.860> of<00:02:31.950> the<00:02:32.040> matter<00:02:32.070> is<00:02:32.400> you

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
enough and the fact of the matter is you

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.180 
enough and the fact of the matter is you
know<00:02:33.240> you<00:02:33.570> can't<00:02:33.780> sit<00:02:33.960> down<00:02:33.990> and<00:02:34.170> say<00:02:34.500> I<00:02:34.740> want

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
know you can't sit down and say I want

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.620 
know you can't sit down and say I want
the<00:02:35.310> next<00:02:35.430> line<00:02:35.730> that<00:02:35.910> I<00:02:35.940> write<00:02:36.210> to<00:02:36.420> be<00:02:36.540> the

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
the next line that I write to be the

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.420 
the next line that I write to be the
most<00:02:36.750> genius<00:02:37.020> best<00:02:37.530> line<00:02:37.770> that<00:02:37.950> I<00:02:37.980> ever<00:02:38.160> write

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
most genius best line that I ever write

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.480 
most genius best line that I ever write
in<00:02:38.640> the<00:02:38.880> world<00:02:39.060> because<00:02:39.840> that's<00:02:40.620> not<00:02:40.860> a<00:02:41.070> great

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
in the world because that's not a great

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.760 
in the world because that's not a great
way<00:02:41.790> to<00:02:41.820> come<00:02:42.300> up<00:02:42.420> with<00:02:42.510> good<00:02:42.690> material<00:02:43.260> but

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
way to come up with good material but

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.680 
way to come up with good material but
what's<00:02:43.920> great<00:02:44.070> about<00:02:44.130> a<00:02:44.250> free<00:02:44.520> write<00:02:44.700> is<00:02:44.880> it

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
what's great about a free write is it

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.600 
what's great about a free write is it
doesn't<00:02:45.930> matter<00:02:46.110> if<00:02:46.320> you're<00:02:46.440> if<00:02:46.650> your<00:02:46.860> ideas

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
doesn't matter if you're if your ideas

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.000 
doesn't matter if you're if your ideas
are<00:02:47.730> good<00:02:47.970> or<00:02:48.209> if<00:02:48.420> they're<00:02:48.570> bad<00:02:49.010> you're

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
are good or if they're bad you're

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.640 
are good or if they're bad you're
allowing<00:02:50.700> yourself<00:02:50.910> Elaine<00:02:51.660> to<00:02:51.989> get<00:02:52.170> to<00:02:52.290> ideas

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
allowing yourself Elaine to get to ideas

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.199 
allowing yourself Elaine to get to ideas
that<00:02:52.680> might<00:02:53.100> be<00:02:53.250> good<00:02:53.430> by<00:02:53.730> going<00:02:54.060> through

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
that might be good by going through

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.540 
that might be good by going through
ideas<00:02:54.390> that<00:02:54.900> might<00:02:55.200> not<00:02:55.410> be<00:02:55.560> so<00:02:55.739> good<00:02:55.920> but<00:02:56.430> the

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
ideas that might not be so good but the

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.430 
ideas that might not be so good but the
thing<00:02:56.730> is<00:02:56.760> you<00:02:57.480> don't<00:02:57.570> have<00:02:57.690> to<00:02:57.930> share<00:02:58.110> a<00:02:58.170> work

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
thing is you don't have to share a work

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.840 
thing is you don't have to share a work
with<00:02:58.650> people<00:02:58.830> just<00:02:59.190> because<00:02:59.430> you<00:02:59.550> write<00:02:59.730> it

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
with people just because you write it

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.479 
with people just because you write it
down<00:03:00.000> and<00:03:00.300> so<00:03:00.540> when<00:03:01.170> I<00:03:01.200> write<00:03:01.440> my<00:03:01.650> first

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
down and so when I write my first

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.180 
down and so when I write my first
initial<00:03:03.150> free<00:03:03.540> write<00:03:03.690> on<00:03:03.930> a<00:03:03.989> poem<00:03:04.440> I<00:03:04.650> might

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
initial free write on a poem I might

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:06.740 
initial free write on a poem I might
come<00:03:05.340> up<00:03:05.400> with<00:03:05.430> eight<00:03:05.700> pages<00:03:05.970> in<00:03:06.300> like<00:03:06.420> three

lines<00:03:06.989> of<00:03:07.140> it<00:03:07.260> might<00:03:07.380> get<00:03:07.530> used<00:03:07.770> I<00:03:08.130> toss

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
lines of it might get used I toss

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.280 
lines of it might get used I toss
everything<00:03:09.120> else<00:03:09.390> that<00:03:09.660> I<00:03:09.690> don't<00:03:09.900> like<00:03:10.080> out

and it's not like that makes you a bad

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.300 
and it's not like that makes you a bad
writer<00:03:12.570> making<00:03:13.200> what<00:03:13.830> makes<00:03:13.980> you<00:03:14.070> a<00:03:14.130> good

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
writer is knowing what's good and then

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:17.930 
writer is knowing what's good and then

whole piece whatever I get that I like I
keep<00:03:27.450> and<00:03:27.840> I<00:03:27.900> cut<00:03:28.200> everything<00:03:28.680> else<00:03:28.830> that<00:03:29.040> I

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
keep and I cut everything else that I

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.430 
keep and I cut everything else that I
don't<00:03:29.250> feel<00:03:29.430> like<00:03:29.580> is<00:03:29.760> a<00:03:30.000> strong<00:03:30.450> idea<00:03:30.840> I<00:03:31.080> want

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
don't feel like is a strong idea I want

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.130 
don't feel like is a strong idea I want
every<00:03:31.739> line<00:03:31.980> to<00:03:32.640> have<00:03:32.760> a<00:03:32.820> strong<00:03:33.209> idea<00:03:33.420> in<00:03:33.810> it<00:03:33.959> I

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
every line to have a strong idea in it I

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.440 
every line to have a strong idea in it I
wouldn't<00:03:35.010> keep<00:03:35.160> a<00:03:35.310> line<00:03:35.489> as<00:03:35.640> filler<00:03:35.910> I<00:03:36.209> would

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
wouldn't keep a line as filler I would

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.590 
wouldn't keep a line as filler I would
only<00:03:36.630> keep<00:03:36.720> a<00:03:36.959> line<00:03:37.140> if<00:03:37.410> it's<00:03:38.450> part<00:03:39.450> of<00:03:39.540> the

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
only keep a line if it's part of the

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.449 
only keep a line if it's part of the
framework<00:03:39.840> of<00:03:40.110> the<00:03:40.200> piece<00:03:40.410> for<00:03:40.860> instance<00:03:41.190> it's

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
framework of the piece for instance it's

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:44.030 
framework of the piece for instance it's
sets<00:03:41.910> up<00:03:42.030> a<00:03:42.090> beginning<00:03:42.420> and<00:03:42.720> end<00:03:42.989> a<00:03:43.380> crucial

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
sets up a beginning and end a crucial

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.460 
sets up a beginning and end a crucial
turning<00:03:44.310> point<00:03:44.610> in<00:03:44.730> the<00:03:44.790> piece<00:03:45.080> so<00:03:46.080> it's<00:03:46.290> like

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
turning point in the piece so it's like

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.140 
turning point in the piece so it's like
the<00:03:46.650> framework<00:03:47.040> or<00:03:47.280> if<00:03:47.519> it's<00:03:47.700> a<00:03:47.820> line<00:03:48.120> that's

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
the framework or if it's a line that's

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.130 
the framework or if it's a line that's
so<00:03:48.660> great

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
so great

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.170 
so great
that<00:03:49.320> I<00:03:49.560> just<00:03:49.799> can't<00:03:50.040> throw<00:03:50.340> it<00:03:50.519> out<00:03:50.640> and<00:03:50.820> so

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
that I just can't throw it out and so

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.570 
that I just can't throw it out and so
once<00:03:51.420> I<00:03:51.540> have<00:03:51.690> those<00:03:51.870> those<00:03:52.620> tentpoles

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
once I have those those tentpoles

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.340 
once I have those those tentpoles
for<00:03:53.880> the<00:03:53.940> piece<00:03:54.120> I<00:03:54.330> usually<00:03:54.720> come<00:03:55.110> up<00:03:55.140> with<00:03:55.320> a

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
for the piece I usually come up with a

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.110 
for the piece I usually come up with a
beginning<00:03:55.769> and<00:03:55.980> end<00:03:56.220> I<00:03:56.610> know

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
beginning and end I know

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.550 
beginning and end I know
two-thirds<00:03:57.750> of<00:03:57.900> the<00:03:57.959> way<00:03:58.049> through<00:03:58.230> the<00:03:58.350> piece

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
two-thirds of the way through the piece

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.039 
two-thirds of the way through the piece
it's<00:03:58.799> gonna<00:03:58.950> shift<00:03:59.250> in<00:03:59.430> some<00:03:59.640> way<00:03:59.820> then<00:04:00.480> I<00:04:00.750> have

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
it's gonna shift in some way then I have

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:03.560 
it's gonna shift in some way then I have
my<00:04:01.350> outline<00:04:01.709> and<00:04:02.010> then<00:04:02.760> I<00:04:02.850> start<00:04:03.120> filling<00:04:03.390> it

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
my outline and then I start filling it

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:06.229 
my outline and then I start filling it
in<00:04:03.660> with<00:04:04.010> transitions<00:04:05.010> I<00:04:05.340> smooth<00:04:05.700> things<00:04:05.970> out

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
in with transitions I smooth things out

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:08.900 
in with transitions I smooth things out
I<00:04:06.540> see<00:04:06.840> if<00:04:06.959> it's<00:04:07.140> you<00:04:07.769> know<00:04:07.890> heavy<00:04:08.519> on<00:04:08.670> one

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
I see if it's you know heavy on one

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.550 
I see if it's you know heavy on one
section<00:04:09.390> or<00:04:09.660> if<00:04:09.870> I<00:04:09.930> haven't<00:04:10.200> addressed<00:04:10.350> a

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
section or if I haven't addressed a

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.410 
section or if I haven't addressed a
point<00:04:10.799> on<00:04:10.980> another<00:04:11.250> and<00:04:11.519> so<00:04:11.940> then<00:04:12.060> I<00:04:12.120> start

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
point on another and so then I start

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.330 
point on another and so then I start
filling<00:04:12.690> it<00:04:12.840> up<00:04:12.959> and<00:04:13.140> making<00:04:13.290> sure<00:04:13.590> that<00:04:13.829> it's

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
filling it up and making sure that it's

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.270 
filling it up and making sure that it's
cohesive<00:04:15.209> and<00:04:15.660> then<00:04:15.989> I<00:04:16.290> have<00:04:16.650> a<00:04:16.680> second<00:04:17.100> draft

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
cohesive and then I have a second draft

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.789 
cohesive and then I have a second draft
and<00:04:17.640> that<00:04:18.479> has<00:04:18.690> most<00:04:18.959> of<00:04:19.049> the<00:04:19.140> lines<00:04:19.320> and<00:04:19.500> ideas

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
and that has most of the lines and ideas

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:21.349 
and that has most of the lines and ideas
that<00:04:19.919> I<00:04:19.979> want<00:04:20.250> and<00:04:20.370> then<00:04:20.459> I<00:04:20.519> do<00:04:20.579> a<00:04:20.640> polish<00:04:21.120> and

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
that I want and then I do a polish and

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:23.750 
that I want and then I do a polish and
then<00:04:21.930> I<00:04:22.200> start<00:04:22.620> practicing<00:04:23.130> the<00:04:23.220> performance

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
then I start practicing the performance

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.450 
then I start practicing the performance
of<00:04:23.940> it<00:04:24.090> and<00:04:24.470> then<00:04:25.470> I<00:04:25.500> work<00:04:25.860> in<00:04:26.039> all<00:04:26.190> of<00:04:26.220> the

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
of it and then I work in all of the

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:27.650 
of it and then I work in all of the
gestures<00:04:26.940> and<00:04:27.240> our<00:04:27.300> ticket

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
gestures and our ticket

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.710 
gestures and our ticket
oceans<00:04:27.990> and<00:04:29.030> stuff<00:04:30.030> might<00:04:30.210> change<00:04:30.450> a<00:04:30.630> little

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
oceans and stuff might change a little

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.200 
oceans and stuff might change a little
bit<00:04:31.020> I<00:04:31.200> might<00:04:31.770> update<00:04:31.950> it<00:04:32.250> later<00:04:32.280> but<00:04:33.120> that's

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
bit I might update it later but that's

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.090 
bit I might update it later but that's
my<00:04:33.450> general<00:04:33.630> process<00:04:34.260> for<00:04:34.530> writing<00:04:34.650> a<00:04:34.860> poem

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 
my general process for writing a poem

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.090 
my general process for writing a poem
for<00:04:36.000> writing<00:04:36.750> rap<00:04:37.080> it's<00:04:37.560> a<00:04:37.710> little<00:04:37.920> different

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
for writing rap it's a little different

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.370 
for writing rap it's a little different
because<00:04:38.400> I<00:04:39.060> almost<00:04:39.300> always<00:04:39.630> have<00:04:39.900> the<00:04:40.050> music

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380 
because I almost always have the music

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.160 
because I almost always have the music
first<00:04:40.650> and<00:04:40.980> I<00:04:41.790> have<00:04:42.090> a<00:04:42.120> file<00:04:42.780> on<00:04:42.990> my<00:04:43.140> computer

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:43.170 
first and I have a file on my computer

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:46.730 
first and I have a file on my computer
that's<00:04:44.160> my<00:04:44.340> idea<00:04:44.790> graveyard<00:04:45.390> that<00:04:45.840> has<00:04:46.050> all<00:04:46.410> of

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
that's my idea graveyard that has all of

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.980 
that's my idea graveyard that has all of
the<00:04:46.830> subjects<00:04:47.520> for<00:04:47.850> songs<00:04:48.270> and<00:04:48.540> poems<00:04:48.720> that<00:04:48.960> I

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
the subjects for songs and poems that I

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:50.270 
the subjects for songs and poems that I
want<00:04:49.260> to<00:04:49.350> write<00:04:49.470> but<00:04:49.710> haven't<00:04:49.980> gotten<00:04:50.130> around

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
want to write but haven't gotten around

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.060 
want to write but haven't gotten around
to<00:04:50.490> yet<00:04:50.610> so<00:04:50.820> I'm<00:04:51.630> never<00:04:51.930> at<00:04:52.440> a<00:04:52.500> loss<00:04:52.620> for<00:04:53.040> ideas

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
to yet so I'm never at a loss for ideas

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.940 
to yet so I'm never at a loss for ideas
I've<00:04:53.580> always<00:04:53.760> got<00:04:53.910> six<00:04:54.210> things<00:04:54.450> that<00:04:54.710> I'd<00:04:55.710> like

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:55.950 
I've always got six things that I'd like

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:58.550 
I've always got six things that I'd like
to<00:04:55.980> write<00:04:56.370> but<00:04:56.580> don't<00:04:56.760> have<00:04:56.910> time<00:04:57.150> for<00:04:57.180> and<00:04:57.720> so

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
to write but don't have time for and so

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.320 
to write but don't have time for and so
maybe<00:04:58.740> I<00:04:58.800> get<00:04:59.010> a<00:04:59.040> beat<00:04:59.250> and<00:04:59.460> I<00:04:59.730> think<00:05:00.000> and<00:05:00.150> I<00:05:00.180> go

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
maybe I get a beat and I think and I go

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:01.790 
maybe I get a beat and I think and I go
through<00:05:00.480> my<00:05:00.600> idea<00:05:00.930> graveyard<00:05:01.410> and<00:05:01.500> I<00:05:01.590> say<00:05:01.770> oh

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
through my idea graveyard and I say oh

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.820 
through my idea graveyard and I say oh
wow<00:05:02.040> this<00:05:02.630> this<00:05:03.630> beat<00:05:03.900> really<00:05:04.200> fits<00:05:04.410> perfectly

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830 
wow this this beat really fits perfectly

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:06.080 
wow this this beat really fits perfectly
with<00:05:05.040> this<00:05:05.160> thing<00:05:05.430> that<00:05:05.580> I<00:05:05.610> wanted<00:05:05.880> to<00:05:05.940> write

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
with this thing that I wanted to write

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:09.320 
with this thing that I wanted to write
for<00:05:06.300> a<00:05:06.330> while<00:05:06.510> and<00:05:07.250> sometimes<00:05:08.250> I<00:05:08.550> listen<00:05:09.030> to<00:05:09.300> a

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
for a while and sometimes I listen to a

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.840 
for a while and sometimes I listen to a
beat<00:05:09.600> and<00:05:09.840> I<00:05:10.380> know<00:05:10.830> immediately<00:05:11.160> what<00:05:11.580> I<00:05:11.610> want

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:11.850 
beat and I know immediately what I want

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:13.190 
beat and I know immediately what I want
to<00:05:11.910> write<00:05:12.000> about<00:05:12.060> the<00:05:12.510> feeling<00:05:12.900> that<00:05:12.990> it<00:05:13.080> gives

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:13.200 
to write about the feeling that it gives

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.820 
to write about the feeling that it gives
me<00:05:13.500> and<00:05:13.890> then<00:05:14.550> I<00:05:14.640> just<00:05:14.790> start<00:05:15.390> freestyling<00:05:16.380> and

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
me and then I just start freestyling and

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.980 
me and then I just start freestyling and
seeing<00:05:17.460> what<00:05:17.610> works<00:05:17.850> seeing<00:05:18.300> what<00:05:18.480> flow<00:05:18.720> works

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990 
seeing what works seeing what flow works

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.230 
seeing what works seeing what flow works
on<00:05:19.200> top<00:05:19.380> of<00:05:19.560> the<00:05:19.620> beat<00:05:19.770> and<00:05:20.010> I<00:05:20.430> just<00:05:21.060> start

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
on top of the beat and I just start

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.580 
on top of the beat and I just start
trying<00:05:21.480> to<00:05:21.540> come<00:05:21.720> up<00:05:21.750> with<00:05:21.960> lines<00:05:22.260> and

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:22.590 
trying to come up with lines and

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.500 
trying to come up with lines and
couplets<00:05:23.130> and<00:05:23.340> different<00:05:24.000> rhyme<00:05:24.150> schemes

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:24.510 
couplets and different rhyme schemes

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:27.980 
couplets and different rhyme schemes
that<00:05:24.690> work<00:05:24.810> on<00:05:24.960> top<00:05:25.170> of<00:05:25.350> it<00:05:25.470> and<00:05:26.900> you<00:05:27.900> know

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:27.990 
that work on top of it and you know

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.170 
that work on top of it and you know
unlike<00:05:28.650> a<00:05:28.710> poem<00:05:29.040> where<00:05:29.490> I<00:05:29.520> have<00:05:29.940> a<00:05:29.970> word

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 
unlike a poem where I have a word

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.690 
unlike a poem where I have a word
document<00:05:30.390> where<00:05:30.870> stuff<00:05:31.200> can<00:05:31.440> move<00:05:31.680> and<00:05:32.100> I<00:05:32.520> take

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:32.700 
document where stuff can move and I take

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.370 
document where stuff can move and I take
a<00:05:32.730> line<00:05:32.970> and<00:05:33.240> I<00:05:33.270> put<00:05:33.480> it<00:05:33.570> up<00:05:33.660> I<00:05:33.900> put<00:05:33.930> it<00:05:34.170> down<00:05:34.350> I

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:34.380 
a line and I put it up I put it down I

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:36.650 
a line and I put it up I put it down I
shift<00:05:35.130> things<00:05:35.310> around<00:05:35.490> it<00:05:36.270> doesn't<00:05:36.450> really

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:36.660 
shift things around it doesn't really

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.240 
shift things around it doesn't really
work<00:05:36.900> that<00:05:36.930> way<00:05:37.260> from<00:05:37.440> my<00:05:37.590> process<00:05:38.070> with

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.250 
work that way from my process with

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:40.580 
work that way from my process with
writing<00:05:38.550> hip-hop<00:05:38.910> because<00:05:39.450> it's<00:05:40.200> so<00:05:40.410> much

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:40.590 
writing hip-hop because it's so much

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.590 
writing hip-hop because it's so much
about<00:05:40.620> the<00:05:40.920> continuity<00:05:41.280> and<00:05:41.760> the<00:05:41.820> flow<00:05:42.060> of<00:05:42.090> 16

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:42.600 
about the continuity and the flow of 16

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.440 
about the continuity and the flow of 16
bars<00:05:42.870> that<00:05:43.560> you<00:05:43.890> can't<00:05:44.250> really<00:05:44.790> you<00:05:45.090> can<00:05:45.210> sort

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:45.450 
bars that you can't really you can sort

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:46.730 
bars that you can't really you can sort
of<00:05:45.480> get<00:05:45.630> away<00:05:45.720> with<00:05:45.900> mixing<00:05:46.170> matchin<00:05:46.530> lines

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.740 
of get away with mixing matchin lines

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.400 
of get away with mixing matchin lines
but<00:05:47.070> you<00:05:47.790> I<00:05:48.120> really<00:05:48.540> like<00:05:48.690> to<00:05:48.840> write<00:05:48.930> it<00:05:49.080> top<00:05:49.260> to

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:49.410 
but you I really like to write it top to

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:51.170 
but you I really like to write it top to
bottom<00:05:49.530> so<00:05:50.010> from<00:05:50.280> the<00:05:50.370> beginning<00:05:50.730> of<00:05:50.910> the

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:51.180 
bottom so from the beginning of the

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.210 
bottom so from the beginning of the
verse<00:05:51.330> to<00:05:51.570> the<00:05:51.660> end<00:05:51.870> of<00:05:52.020> the<00:05:52.110> verse<00:05:52.290> and<00:05:52.650> so<00:05:52.950> I

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:53.220 
verse to the end of the verse and so I

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:56.660 
verse to the end of the verse and so I
just<00:05:53.640> sit<00:05:53.820> down<00:05:53.850> and<00:05:54.510> I<00:05:54.600> I<00:05:54.930> figure<00:05:55.590> out<00:05:55.740> I<00:05:56.010> don't

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:56.670 
just sit down and I I figure out I don't

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:57.920 
just sit down and I I figure out I don't
have<00:05:56.760> a<00:05:56.790> really<00:05:56.970> quick<00:05:57.150> writing<00:05:57.390> process<00:05:57.840> I

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:57.930 
have a really quick writing process I

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:59.600 
have a really quick writing process I
don't<00:05:58.050> just<00:05:58.230> jot<00:05:58.410> it<00:05:58.440> down<00:05:58.590> I<00:05:58.710> still<00:05:59.040> sit<00:05:59.340> for

00:05:59.600 --> 00:05:59.610 
don't just jot it down I still sit for

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:03.080 
don't just jot it down I still sit for
you<00:06:00.090> know<00:06:00.180> minutes<00:06:00.630> and<00:06:00.780> hours<00:06:01.080> and<00:06:02.060> wrack<00:06:03.060> my

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:03.090 
you know minutes and hours and wrack my

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:05.000 
you know minutes and hours and wrack my
brain<00:06:03.570> about<00:06:03.750> what<00:06:04.020> line<00:06:04.200> to<00:06:04.380> come<00:06:04.530> next<00:06:04.740> but

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:05.010 
brain about what line to come next but

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:07.040 
brain about what line to come next but
it's<00:06:05.340> not<00:06:05.520> like<00:06:05.730> the<00:06:06.180> spoken<00:06:06.570> word<00:06:06.720> where<00:06:06.930> it's

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.050 
it's not like the spoken word where it's

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:09.470 
it's not like the spoken word where it's
all<00:06:07.170> moving<00:06:07.530> around<00:06:07.620> I<00:06:08.040> hope<00:06:08.940> that<00:06:09.120> addressed

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:09.480 
all moving around I hope that addressed

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.120 
all moving around I hope that addressed
some<00:06:10.110> of<00:06:10.230> your<00:06:10.350> concerns<00:06:10.650> about<00:06:10.740> writer's

block I will say that you know it's not

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:17.780

people your deepest darkest secrets but
there's<00:06:31.230> no<00:06:31.410> shame<00:06:31.650> in<00:06:31.680> writing<00:06:32.040> them<00:06:32.130> down

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:32.160 
there's no shame in writing them down
