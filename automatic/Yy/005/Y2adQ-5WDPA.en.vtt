now<00:00:12.960> it's<00:00:13.110> undergone<00:00:13.560> revisions<00:00:14.220> over<00:00:14.400> that

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
now it's undergone revisions over that

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.170 
now it's undergone revisions over that
time<00:00:15.059> but<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.330> last<00:00:15.360> time<00:00:15.900> we<00:00:16.529> did<00:00:16.680> so<00:00:16.920> was

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:17.180 
time but the last time we did so was

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.960 
time but the last time we did so was
1991<00:00:18.590> we<00:00:19.590> all<00:00:19.740> know<00:00:19.890> how<00:00:20.099> much<00:00:20.279> health<00:00:20.670> care

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
1991 we all know how much health care

1991 we all know how much health care
and<00:00:21.210> medicine<00:00:21.690> have<00:00:21.930> changed<00:00:22.440> since<00:00:22.590> then<00:00:22.860> we

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
and medicine have changed since then we

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.640 
and medicine have changed since then we
felt<00:00:23.850> it<00:00:24.029> was<00:00:24.119> time<00:00:24.180> to<00:00:24.420> take<00:00:24.750> a<00:00:24.779> deep<00:00:25.080> look<00:00:25.140> at

felt it was time to take a deep look at
the<00:00:26.010> MCAT<00:00:26.490> what<00:00:27.270> it<00:00:27.420> assessed<00:00:27.900> so<00:00:28.289> that<00:00:28.500> we

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
the MCAT what it assessed so that we

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.740 
the MCAT what it assessed so that we
could<00:00:28.949> be<00:00:29.250> confident<00:00:29.910> that<00:00:30.180> it<00:00:30.270> was<00:00:30.420> helping

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
future for example we understand that

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.209 
future for example we understand that
there<00:00:57.539> are<00:00:57.739> psychological<00:00:58.739> social

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
there are psychological social

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.610 
there are psychological social
behavioral<00:01:00.149> factors<00:01:00.360> that<00:01:01.200> really<00:01:01.469> are<00:01:01.590> very

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
behavioral factors that really are very

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.340 
behavioral factors that really are very
central<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:03.030> determining<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.870> health<00:01:04.050> of<00:01:04.199> an

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
individual so that one of the key

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.559 
individual so that one of the key
changes<00:01:07.020> is<00:01:07.410> to<00:01:07.440> build<00:01:07.920> on<00:01:08.340> those<00:01:08.850> foundations

00:01:09.559 --> 00:01:09.569 
changes is to build on those foundations

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:12.109 
changes is to build on those foundations
in<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.929> natural<00:01:10.410> sciences<00:01:10.619> we<00:01:11.610> still<00:01:11.880> need

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
in the natural sciences we still need

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.139 
in the natural sciences we still need
those<00:01:12.360> but<00:01:13.289> to<00:01:13.440> add<00:01:13.590> some<00:01:13.979> emphasis<00:01:14.550> on<00:01:14.759> those

00:01:15.139 --> 00:01:15.149 
those but to add some emphasis on those

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:18.410 
those but to add some emphasis on those
basic<00:01:15.660> principles<00:01:16.289> of<00:01:16.740> psychology<00:01:17.420> behavior

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
basic principles of psychology behavior

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.219 
basic principles of psychology behavior
sociology<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:20.149> actually<00:01:21.149> underpin<00:01:21.720> human

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
sociology that actually underpin human

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.160 
sociology that actually underpin human
health<00:01:22.490> in<00:01:23.490> addition<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.149> that<00:01:24.360> being<00:01:24.929> a

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
health in addition to that being a

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.089 
health in addition to that being a
physician<00:01:25.679> in<00:01:26.250> today's<00:01:26.640> world<00:01:27.410> requires<00:01:28.410> real

00:01:29.089 --> 00:01:29.099 
physician in today's world requires real

00:01:29.099 --> 00:01:31.550 
physician in today's world requires real
skills<00:01:29.670> of<00:01:30.030> critical<00:01:30.509> thinking<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:31.200> analysis

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
skills of critical thinking and analysis

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.330 
skills of critical thinking and analysis
and<00:01:32.280> so<00:01:32.849> the<00:01:33.000> design<00:01:33.420> of<00:01:33.660> the<00:01:33.750> exam<00:01:34.200> will<00:01:34.470> be<00:01:34.500> to

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
and so the design of the exam will be to

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.760 
and so the design of the exam will be to
really<00:01:35.670> test<00:01:35.970> not<00:01:36.599> just<00:01:36.660> what<00:01:37.050> an<00:01:37.170> individual

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
really test not just what an individual

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.529 
really test not just what an individual
knows<00:01:38.009> but<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.849> way<00:01:38.970> they<00:01:39.119> think<00:01:39.420> about

00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:39.539 
knows but the way they think about

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:42.109 
knows but the way they think about
problems<00:01:40.229> not<00:01:40.740> just<00:01:40.800> scientific<00:01:41.459> problems

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
problems not just scientific problems

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.809 
problems not just scientific problems
but<00:01:42.750> problems<00:01:43.259> that<00:01:43.500> are<00:01:43.619> social<00:01:44.009> ethical

00:01:44.809 --> 00:01:44.819 
but problems that are social ethical

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:48.260 
but problems that are social ethical
perhaps<00:01:45.470> we<00:01:46.470> think<00:01:46.740> this<00:01:46.920> will<00:01:47.160> provide<00:01:47.700> us<00:01:48.090> a

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
perhaps we think this will provide us a

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.719 
perhaps we think this will provide us a
much<00:01:48.479> broader<00:01:48.750> picture<00:01:49.140> of<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:50.280> person<00:01:50.640> who

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
much broader picture of the person who

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.710 
much broader picture of the person who
seeks<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.119> go<00:01:51.239> to<00:01:51.300> medical<00:01:51.539> school<00:01:53.509> the<00:01:54.509> goal

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
seeks to go to medical school the goal

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.469 
seeks to go to medical school the goal
of<00:01:54.929> the<00:01:55.020> AMC<00:01:55.590> in<00:01:55.890> all<00:01:56.280> of<00:01:56.520> this<00:01:56.729> is<00:01:56.970> to<00:01:57.360> help

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
of the AMC in all of this is to help

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.510 
of the AMC in all of this is to help
medical<00:01:58.050> schools<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:58.679> their<00:01:58.979> admissions

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
medical schools and their admissions

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.300 
medical schools and their admissions
committees<00:02:00.149> find<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:01.020> best<00:02:01.319> possible<00:02:02.099> people

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
committees find the best possible people

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.960 
committees find the best possible people
to<00:02:02.970> be<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.270> doctors<00:02:03.690> of<00:02:03.929> the<00:02:04.050> future<00:02:04.550> the<00:02:05.550> MCAT

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
to be the doctors of the future the MCAT

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.150 
to be the doctors of the future the MCAT
especially<00:02:06.630> as<00:02:06.750> we've<00:02:06.989> improved<00:02:07.500> it<00:02:07.770> we<00:02:07.950> think

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
especially as we've improved it we think

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.240 
especially as we've improved it we think
will<00:02:08.459> help<00:02:08.670> tell<00:02:09.450> us<00:02:09.630> a<00:02:09.780> lot<00:02:09.959> about<00:02:10.319> what<00:02:11.069> not

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
will help tell us a lot about what not

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.160 
will help tell us a lot about what not
just<00:02:11.459> what<00:02:11.640> students<00:02:12.090> know<00:02:12.270> but<00:02:12.870> how<00:02:12.989> they

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
just what students know but how they

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.559 
just what students know but how they
think<00:02:13.430> but<00:02:14.430> there's<00:02:14.610> so<00:02:14.730> much<00:02:14.849> more<00:02:15.150> than<00:02:15.390> that

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
think but there's so much more than that

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.000 
think but there's so much more than that
that<00:02:15.599> goes<00:02:15.989> into

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
that goes into

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.820 
that goes into
to<00:02:17.370> being<00:02:17.640> a<00:02:17.939> good<00:02:18.180> doctor<00:02:18.390> at<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:19.110> bedside<00:02:19.290> or

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
to being a good doctor at the bedside or

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.250 
to being a good doctor at the bedside or
in<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.099> clinic<00:02:20.480> so<00:02:21.480> we're<00:02:21.750> trying<00:02:21.959> to<00:02:22.079> develop

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
in the clinic so we're trying to develop

in the clinic so we're trying to develop
other<00:02:22.680> tools<00:02:23.040> that<00:02:24.030> admissions<00:02:24.629> committees

other tools that admissions committees

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.869 
other tools that admissions committees
could<00:02:25.470> use<00:02:25.739> in<00:02:26.040> their<00:02:26.189> assessment<00:02:26.760> of

changes to the application itself we're

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.649

to interview applicants we're helping

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.550 
to interview applicants we're helping
them<00:02:44.459> think<00:02:44.790> about<00:02:44.909> new<00:02:45.239> approaches<00:02:45.840> to

new MCAT in 2015 but that means that

2012 will need to be thinking about how

sociology will probably be more

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.960 
sociology will probably be more

determinants of health some schools will

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.390 
determinants of health some schools will
offer<00:03:39.680> interdisciplinary<00:03:40.680> courses<00:03:41.040> that

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
offer interdisciplinary courses that

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.089 
offer interdisciplinary courses that
might<00:03:41.579> draw<00:03:41.910> together<00:03:42.500> different<00:03:43.500> elements

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:44.099 
might draw together different elements

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
of these disciplines that will be very

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:48.860 
of these disciplines that will be very
appealing<00:03:46.410> to<00:03:47.010> pre-medical<00:03:47.370> students<00:03:48.090> but<00:03:48.840> I

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
appealing to pre-medical students but I

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.390 
appealing to pre-medical students but I
think<00:03:49.169> the<00:03:49.349> thing<00:03:49.650> that<00:03:49.680> I<00:03:49.859> would<00:03:50.190> emphasize

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
think the thing that I would emphasize

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.009 
think the thing that I would emphasize
is<00:03:51.239> that<00:03:52.190> there's<00:03:53.190> so<00:03:53.519> much<00:03:53.699> value<00:03:54.060> in<00:03:54.599> a<00:03:54.780> broad

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
is that there's so much value in a broad

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:58.369 
is that there's so much value in a broad
education<00:03:55.319> and<00:03:56.389> the<00:03:57.389> undergraduate<00:03:57.840> years

00:03:58.369 --> 00:03:58.379 
education and the undergraduate years

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:00.770 
education and the undergraduate years
are<00:03:58.680> the<00:03:58.799> years<00:03:58.980> to<00:03:59.280> pursue<00:03:59.669> that<00:03:59.879> I've<00:04:00.569> had<00:04:00.750> a

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
are the years to pursue that I've had a

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.050 
are the years to pursue that I've had a
wonderful<00:04:01.379> career<00:04:01.620> in<00:04:01.949> medicine<00:04:02.280> but<00:04:03.030> I

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
wonderful career in medicine but I

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.490 
wonderful career in medicine but I
wouldn't<00:04:03.359> give<00:04:03.540> up<00:04:03.569> the<00:04:03.720> fact<00:04:04.109> that<00:04:04.260> my

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
wouldn't give up the fact that my

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.670 
wouldn't give up the fact that my
undergraduate<00:04:05.310> major<00:04:05.549> was<00:04:05.849> in<00:04:06.030> philosophy<00:04:06.680> it

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
undergraduate major was in philosophy it

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.699 
undergraduate major was in philosophy it
taught<00:04:07.919> me<00:04:07.949> how<00:04:08.129> to<00:04:08.310> read<00:04:09.150> carefully<00:04:09.709> think

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
taught me how to read carefully think

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:14.689 
taught me how to read carefully think
critically<00:04:11.489> there<00:04:12.480> are<00:04:12.599> so<00:04:12.900> many<00:04:13.049> pathways<00:04:13.769> to

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:14.699 
critically there are so many pathways to

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:16.399 
critically there are so many pathways to
the<00:04:14.819> kind<00:04:15.030> of<00:04:15.120> mental<00:04:15.510> skills<00:04:15.900> that<00:04:16.260> will

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:16.409 
the kind of mental skills that will

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:18.229 
the kind of mental skills that will
contribute<00:04:16.799> to<00:04:17.010> making<00:04:17.310> a<00:04:17.549> good<00:04:17.729> doctor

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
contribute to making a good doctor

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.270 
contribute to making a good doctor
so<00:04:18.840> most<00:04:19.049> of<00:04:19.199> all<00:04:19.349> we<00:04:19.530> want<00:04:19.739> students<00:04:20.190> to

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
so most of all we want students to

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.520 
so most of all we want students to
realize<00:04:21.269> that<00:04:21.510> there<00:04:21.720> are<00:04:21.750> breadth<00:04:22.229> of
