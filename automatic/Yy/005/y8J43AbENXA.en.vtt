the<00:00:16.350> roller<00:00:16.529> cam<00:00:17.180> some<00:00:18.180> people<00:00:18.390> out<00:00:18.480> there

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
the roller cam some people out there

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.820 
the roller cam some people out there
might<00:00:18.750> not<00:00:18.840> be<00:00:18.900> sure<00:00:19.109> on<00:00:19.230> what<00:00:19.260> a<00:00:19.380> roller<00:00:19.619> cam

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
might not be sure on what a roller cam

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.609 
might not be sure on what a roller cam
is<00:00:20.010> versa<00:00:20.310> a<00:00:20.430> traditional-style<00:00:21.000> cam<00:00:21.619> the

is versa a traditional-style cam the

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.620 
is versa a traditional-style cam the
lifter<00:00:23.100> rides<00:00:23.609> on<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:23.910> surface<00:00:24.240> of<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.420> cam

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
lifter rides on the surface of the cam

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.420 
lifter rides on the surface of the cam
as<00:00:25.470> you<00:00:25.740> can<00:00:25.859> see<00:00:25.980> right<00:00:26.099> here<00:00:26.160> and<00:00:26.369> the

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
as you can see right here and the

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.400 
as you can see right here and the
lifters<00:00:26.670> gonna<00:00:26.849> ride<00:00:27.060> right<00:00:27.300> here<00:00:27.330> if<00:00:28.199> it's<00:00:28.349> a

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
lifters gonna ride right here if it's a

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.019 
lifters gonna ride right here if it's a
roller<00:00:28.650> type<00:00:28.920> it's<00:00:29.070> got<00:00:29.189> a<00:00:29.220> roller<00:00:29.490> bearing<00:00:29.880> on

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
roller type it's got a roller bearing on

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.550 
roller type it's got a roller bearing on
there<00:00:30.240> it's<00:00:30.449> like<00:00:30.539> a<00:00:30.599> wheel<00:00:30.900> definitely<00:00:31.470> more

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
there it's like a wheel definitely more

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.200 
there it's like a wheel definitely more
efficient<00:00:31.980> that's<00:00:32.130> why<00:00:32.219> we<00:00:32.399> all<00:00:32.669> drive<00:00:32.940> cars

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
efficient that's why we all drive cars

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.790 
efficient that's why we all drive cars
with<00:00:33.300> wheels<00:00:33.600> instead<00:00:33.930> of<00:00:34.050> having<00:00:34.200> slaves<00:00:34.590> you

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
with wheels instead of having slaves you

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.100 
with wheels instead of having slaves you
know<00:00:34.829> so<00:00:35.520> in<00:00:35.610> an<00:00:35.700> old<00:00:35.820> flat<00:00:36.059> tappet<00:00:36.300> slides<00:00:36.930> on

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
know so in an old flat tappet slides on

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.240 
know so in an old flat tappet slides on
there<00:00:37.260> a<00:00:37.290> lot<00:00:37.440> of<00:00:37.469> friction<00:00:37.680> you<00:00:37.950> don't<00:00:38.100> want

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
there a lot of friction you don't want

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.500 
there a lot of friction you don't want
that<00:00:38.370> so<00:00:38.550> definitely<00:00:38.940> good<00:00:39.059> choice<00:00:39.239> of<00:00:39.420> the

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
that so definitely good choice of the

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.569 
that so definitely good choice of the
roller<00:00:39.719> a<00:00:40.290> few<00:00:40.860> things<00:00:41.070> we're<00:00:41.190> gonna<00:00:41.280> need<00:00:41.370> to

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
roller a few things we're gonna need to

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:42.950 
roller a few things we're gonna need to
know<00:00:41.730> is<00:00:41.879> that<00:00:41.969> you<00:00:42.059> know<00:00:42.149> compression<00:00:42.629> ratio

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
know is that you know compression ratio

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.450 
know is that you know compression ratio
of<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.140> engine<00:00:43.260> what<00:00:43.710> heads<00:00:43.950> you<00:00:44.100> went<00:00:44.280> with

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
of the engine what heads you went with

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.220 
of the engine what heads you went with
how<00:00:44.940> those<00:00:45.120> heads<00:00:45.390> flow<00:00:45.690> whether<00:00:45.989> they're

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
how those heads flow whether they're

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.869 
how those heads flow whether they're
iron<00:00:46.440> or<00:00:46.680> aluminum<00:00:46.710> you<00:00:47.550> know<00:00:47.640> a<00:00:47.670> lot<00:00:47.850> of

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
iron or aluminum you know a lot of

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.459 
iron or aluminum you know a lot of
technical<00:00:48.360> data<00:00:48.480> that<00:00:48.719> usually<00:00:48.960> I<00:00:49.050> mean<00:00:49.350> if

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
technical data that usually I mean if

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:50.600 
technical data that usually I mean if
you're<00:00:49.649> building<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:49.980> car<00:00:50.160> you<00:00:50.460> should

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
you're building the car you should

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:51.830 
you're building the car you should
really<00:00:50.789> know<00:00:50.850> what's<00:00:51.090> in<00:00:51.210> your<00:00:51.329> engine<00:00:51.629> you

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
really know what's in your engine you

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:52.819 
really know what's in your engine you
know<00:00:51.930> you<00:00:52.020> don't<00:00:52.170> want<00:00:52.289> it<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.469> be<00:00:52.530> buying<00:00:52.710> the

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
know you don't want it to be buying the

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:53.840 
know you don't want it to be buying the
crate<00:00:53.010> engine<00:00:53.309> if<00:00:53.399> you're<00:00:53.489> gonna<00:00:53.579> be<00:00:53.670> putting

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
crate engine if you're gonna be putting

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.330 
crate engine if you're gonna be putting
a<00:00:53.910> custom<00:00:54.210> cam<00:00:54.390> in<00:00:54.539> it<00:00:54.600> anyways<00:00:54.989> so<00:00:55.250> you<00:00:56.250> know

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
a custom cam in it anyways so you know

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.189 
a custom cam in it anyways so you know
definitely<00:00:56.660> want<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.719> know<00:00:57.809> how<00:00:57.960> you're<00:00:58.109> going

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
definitely want to know how you're going

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.229 
definitely want to know how you're going
to<00:00:58.289> be<00:00:58.350> driving<00:00:58.590> it<00:00:58.859> rear<00:00:59.250> rear<00:00:59.609> gear<00:00:59.820> ratio<00:01:00.180> of

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
to be driving it rear rear gear ratio of

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.510 
to be driving it rear rear gear ratio of
the<00:01:00.329> vehicle<00:01:00.719> tire<00:01:01.079> size<00:01:01.520> transmission

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
the vehicle tire size transmission

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.310 
the vehicle tire size transmission
choice<00:01:02.789> like<00:01:03.059> that<00:01:03.270> but<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.899> biggest<00:01:04.140> factor

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
choice like that but the biggest factor

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.320 
choice like that but the biggest factor
is<00:01:04.680> how<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:04.949> plan<00:01:05.369> on<00:01:05.430> driving<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.939> vehicle

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
is how you plan on driving the vehicle

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.120 
is how you plan on driving the vehicle
what<00:01:06.869> you<00:01:06.990> want<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.290> vehicle<00:01:07.619> do<00:01:07.770> it's<00:01:07.890> you

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
what you want the vehicle do it's you

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.380 
what you want the vehicle do it's you
know<00:01:08.220> how<00:01:08.490> you<00:01:08.549> want<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:08.790> perform<00:01:08.970> what<00:01:09.330> you

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
know how you want to perform what you

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.760 
know how you want to perform what you
expect<00:01:09.780> out<00:01:09.930> of<00:01:09.960> it<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.290> that's<00:01:10.350> basically

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
expect out of it and that's basically

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:11.990 
expect out of it and that's basically
what<00:01:11.189> I'm<00:01:11.280> gonna<00:01:11.369> need<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.640> know

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
what I'm gonna need to know

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.490 
what I'm gonna need to know
so<00:01:12.510> Kevin<00:01:12.720> I<00:01:12.840> see<00:01:12.930> we<00:01:13.020> got<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.170> couple<00:01:13.350> different

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
so Kevin I see we got a couple different

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.870 
so Kevin I see we got a couple different
cams<00:01:13.890> here<00:01:14.130> on<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.340> counter<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:14.729> some

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
cams here on the counter and some

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.820 
cams here on the counter and some
lifters<00:01:15.210> what's<00:01:15.470> what's<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.590> difference

between<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.130> two<00:01:17.280> well<00:01:18.119> earlier<00:01:18.540> I<00:01:18.570> was

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
between the two well earlier I was

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.210 
between the two well earlier I was
talking<00:01:18.900> a<00:01:18.960> little<00:01:19.020> bit<00:01:19.200> about<00:01:19.350> flat<00:01:20.040> tappet

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
talking a little bit about flat tappet

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.399 
talking a little bit about flat tappet

is going to travel along the surface
like<00:01:36.689> this<00:01:36.869> as<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:38.130> lifter<00:01:38.430> moves<00:01:38.640> up<00:01:38.820> and

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
like this as the lifter moves up and

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.539 
like this as the lifter moves up and
down<00:01:39.619> according<00:01:40.619> to<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.799> duration<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.400> the

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
lift on the cam two things we need to

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.109 
lift on the cam two things we need to
talk<00:01:43.170> about<00:01:43.520> that's<00:01:44.520> going<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:44.820> move<00:01:44.939> the

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
talk about that's going to move the

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.149 
talk about that's going to move the
valve<00:01:45.329> open<00:01:45.869> or<00:01:45.990> it's<00:01:46.079> gonna<00:01:46.170> move<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.560> the

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
valve open or it's gonna move the the

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.920 
valve open or it's gonna move the the
rocker<00:01:47.430> and<00:01:47.759> turn<00:01:47.909> push<00:01:48.210> rod<00:01:48.450> in<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.720> valve

rocker and turn push rod in the valve
open<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:49.320> close<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:49.770> that's<00:01:50.189> going<00:01:50.340> to

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
open and close and that's going to

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.010 
open and close and that's going to
determine<00:01:50.610> how<00:01:50.790> much<00:01:50.939> fuel<00:01:51.270> goes<00:01:51.509> in<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:51.960> out

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
determine how much fuel goes in and out

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.670 
determine how much fuel goes in and out
of<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.259> engine

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
of the engine

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.800 
of the engine
how<00:01:53.280> much<00:01:53.430> fuel<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:53.790> air<00:01:53.970> in<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:54.600> how<00:01:54.689> much

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
how much fuel and air in and how much

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.959 
how much fuel and air in and how much
exhaust<00:01:55.200> out<00:01:55.439> and<00:01:55.740> ultimate<00:01:56.579> you<00:01:56.640> know<00:01:56.670> an

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
exhaust out and ultimate you know an

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.609 
exhaust out and ultimate you know an
engine<00:01:57.270> is<00:01:57.329> basically<00:01:57.479> a<00:01:57.689> big<00:01:57.840> air<00:01:57.990> pump<00:01:58.200> the

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
engine is basically a big air pump the

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.080 
engine is basically a big air pump the
more<00:01:58.829> fuel<00:01:59.070> that<00:01:59.189> goes<00:01:59.310> in<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.729> more<00:01:59.880> power

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
more fuel that goes in the more power

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.490 
more fuel that goes in the more power
it's<00:02:00.329> going<00:02:00.420> to<00:02:00.540> make<00:02:00.689> and<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:00.960> more<00:02:01.170> exhaust

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
it's going to make and the more exhaust

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.499 
it's going to make and the more exhaust
that's<00:02:01.740> then<00:02:01.979> going<00:02:02.219> to<00:02:02.280> need<00:02:02.399> to<00:02:02.460> go<00:02:02.579> out<00:02:02.729> here

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
that's then going to need to go out here

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:04.609 
that's then going to need to go out here
with<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.689> roller<00:02:03.930> again<00:02:04.320> we<00:02:04.409> were<00:02:04.469> talking

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
with the roller again we were talking

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:05.899 
with the roller again we were talking
about<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:04.799> efficiency<00:02:05.189> these<00:02:05.670> are<00:02:05.790> both

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
about the efficiency these are both

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.789 
about the efficiency these are both
small-block<00:02:06.299> Chevy<00:02:06.719> camshafts<00:02:07.200> by<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.439> way<00:02:07.590> I

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
small-block Chevy camshafts by the way I

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.219 
small-block Chevy camshafts by the way I
chose<00:02:08.789> a<00:02:08.849> two<00:02:09.209> of<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.390> exact<00:02:09.660> same<00:02:09.869> a<00:02:09.929> flat

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
chose a two of the exact same a flat

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.479 
chose a two of the exact same a flat
tappet<00:02:10.410> or<00:02:10.649> roller<00:02:10.800> just<00:02:10.950> so<00:02:11.069> you<00:02:11.129> can<00:02:11.220> see<00:02:11.370> the

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
tappet or roller just so you can see the

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.430 
tappet or roller just so you can see the
difference<00:02:11.819> here's<00:02:12.510> a<00:02:12.569> factory<00:02:13.230> roller

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
difference here's a factory roller

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.820 
difference here's a factory roller

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
here aftermarket ones these lifters are

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.260 
here aftermarket ones these lifters are
gonna<00:02:17.940> slide<00:02:18.570> along<00:02:18.990> this<00:02:19.170> so<00:02:19.530> as<00:02:20.120> you<00:02:21.120> can<00:02:21.210> see

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
gonna slide along this so as you can see

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.780 
gonna slide along this so as you can see
it's<00:02:21.510> going<00:02:21.600> to<00:02:21.690> roll<00:02:21.960> here<00:02:22.350> and<00:02:22.640> that's<00:02:23.640> gonna

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
it's going to roll here and that's gonna

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.460 
it's going to roll here and that's gonna
reduce<00:02:23.940> friction<00:02:24.540> therefore<00:02:24.930> adding<00:02:25.260> power

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
reduce friction therefore adding power

with<00:02:42.540> going<00:02:42.780> with<00:02:42.900> a<00:02:42.990> roller<00:02:43.170> then<00:02:43.410> than<00:02:43.770> they

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
with going with a roller then than they

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.710 
with going with a roller then than they
do<00:02:43.950> with<00:02:44.250> a<00:02:44.310> flat<00:02:44.550> tappet<00:02:44.760> as<00:02:45.090> far<00:02:45.330> as<00:02:45.510> like<00:02:45.690> the

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
do with a flat tappet as far as like the

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.990 
do with a flat tappet as far as like the
performance<00:02:46.110> and<00:02:46.410> all<00:02:46.470> that<00:02:46.650> oh<00:02:46.830> I'd<00:02:47.220> say<00:02:47.250> it's

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
performance and all that oh I'd say it's

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.320 
performance and all that oh I'd say it's
a<00:02:48.740> exponentially<00:02:49.740> different<00:02:50.130> with<00:02:50.610> with<00:02:51.300> a

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
a exponentially different with with a

a exponentially different with with a
roller<00:02:51.630> type<00:02:51.810> tap<00:02:52.080> it<00:02:52.260> again<00:02:52.440> you're<00:02:52.800> not

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
roller type tap it again you're not

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.850 
roller type tap it again you're not
limited<00:02:53.520> by<00:02:53.550> lift<00:02:53.940> I<00:02:54.120> mean<00:02:54.410> like<00:02:55.410> with<00:02:55.650> a

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
limited by lift I mean like with a

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.850 
limited by lift I mean like with a
because<00:02:56.220> of<00:02:56.630> with<00:02:57.630> the<00:02:57.750> old<00:02:57.900> flat<00:02:58.410> tab<00:02:58.650> it's

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
because of with the old flat tab it's

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.699 
because of with the old flat tab it's
the<00:02:59.040> lifter<00:02:59.430> here<00:02:59.930> excuse<00:03:00.930> me<00:03:01.050> the<00:03:01.410> lifter

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
the lifter here excuse me the lifter

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.350 
the lifter here excuse me the lifter
here<00:03:01.920> will<00:03:02.040> ride<00:03:02.310> and<00:03:02.640> if<00:03:02.820> you<00:03:02.970> have<00:03:03.090> too<00:03:03.240> much

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
here will ride and if you have too much

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.760 
here will ride and if you have too much
lift<00:03:03.660> or<00:03:03.810> duration<00:03:04.110> or<00:03:04.410> rather<00:03:04.530> too<00:03:04.740> much

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
on the edge of the load so you need to

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.360 
on the edge of the load so you need to
run<00:03:12.870> a<00:03:12.930> really<00:03:13.320> big<00:03:13.500> lifter<00:03:13.950> in<00:03:14.040> order<00:03:14.190> to<00:03:14.250> make

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
run a really big lifter in order to make

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.150 
run a really big lifter in order to make
that<00:03:14.520> work<00:03:14.580> now<00:03:15.360> with<00:03:15.840> a<00:03:15.870> with<00:03:16.500> a<00:03:16.530> roller<00:03:16.860> type

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
that work now with a with a roller type

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.370 
that work now with a with a roller type
you<00:03:17.550> don't<00:03:17.670> have<00:03:17.940> that<00:03:18.180> it's<00:03:18.780> just<00:03:18.959> gonna<00:03:19.080> ride

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
you don't have that it's just gonna ride

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:20.449 
you don't have that it's just gonna ride
throughout<00:03:19.739> the<00:03:19.890> earth<00:03:19.980> for<00:03:20.160> the<00:03:20.220> entire

throughout the earth for the entire

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:22.580 
throughout the earth for the entire
range<00:03:20.700> so<00:03:20.880> you<00:03:20.910> and<00:03:21.180> we<00:03:21.300> have<00:03:21.420> people<00:03:21.600> with<00:03:22.440> you

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
range so you and we have people with you

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.130 
range so you and we have people with you
know<00:03:22.620> very<00:03:22.950> very<00:03:23.190> short<00:03:23.610> duration<00:03:23.820> cams<00:03:24.510> so

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
know very very short duration cams so

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.680 
know very very short duration cams so
running<00:03:25.530> lots<00:03:25.800> and<00:03:26.010> lots<00:03:26.130> of<00:03:26.280> lifts<00:03:26.519> so<00:03:26.910> before

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
running lots and lots of lifts so before

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:28.940 
running lots and lots of lifts so before
you<00:03:27.780> couldn't<00:03:27.989> do<00:03:28.140> that<00:03:28.170> with<00:03:28.290> a<00:03:28.410> flat<00:03:28.530> top<00:03:28.769> but

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
you couldn't do that with a flat top but

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.470 
you couldn't do that with a flat top but
it's<00:03:29.070> it's<00:03:29.310> really<00:03:29.370> nice<00:03:29.730> and<00:03:30.090> it<00:03:30.180> makes<00:03:30.360> it

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
it's it's really nice and it makes it

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.810 
it's it's really nice and it makes it
convenient<00:03:30.780> for<00:03:30.930> a<00:03:31.019> lot<00:03:31.140> of<00:03:31.230> people<00:03:31.440> to<00:03:31.560> get

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:31.820 
convenient for a lot of people to get

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.190 
convenient for a lot of people to get
exactly<00:03:32.820> the<00:03:32.940> cam<00:03:33.150> they<00:03:33.390> want<00:03:33.660> whereas<00:03:34.019> with<00:03:34.170> a

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
exactly the cam they want whereas with a

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.380 
exactly the cam they want whereas with a
flat<00:03:34.470> tablet<00:03:34.739> they<00:03:34.830> would<00:03:34.950> be<00:03:35.040> limited<00:03:35.190> so<00:03:35.580> can

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
flat tablet they would be limited so can

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.090 
flat tablet they would be limited so can
you<00:03:36.480> actually<00:03:36.630> spin<00:03:37.019> higher<00:03:37.230> rpms<00:03:37.650> in<00:03:37.860> with<00:03:38.070> a

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
you actually spin higher rpms in with a

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.770 
you actually spin higher rpms in with a
roller<00:03:38.580> can<00:03:38.880> than<00:03:39.060> you<00:03:39.150> can't<00:03:39.330> a<00:03:39.390> regular<00:03:39.600> flat

you know that the camshaft type doesn't

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.030 
you know that the camshaft type doesn't
really<00:03:42.630> determine<00:03:42.959> the<00:03:43.019> RPM<00:03:43.350> range<00:03:43.530> but<00:03:43.860> there

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
really determine the RPM range but there

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.050 
really determine the RPM range but there
is<00:03:44.160> some<00:03:44.370> truth<00:03:44.580> to<00:03:44.610> that

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
with that you get high rpm range I mean

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.880 
with that you get high rpm range I mean
I<00:04:20.220> have<00:04:20.340> friends<00:04:20.910> and<00:04:21.060> associates<00:04:22.049> that<00:04:22.590> they

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
in order to have the inch and survived

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.220 
in order to have the inch and survived
up<00:04:28.890> to<00:04:28.920> that<00:04:29.130> point<00:04:29.310> but<00:04:29.670> yeah<00:04:30.510> I<00:04:30.540> mean<00:04:30.690> it's

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:31.230 
up to that point but yeah I mean it's

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:32.420 
up to that point but yeah I mean it's
definitely<00:04:31.380> possible<00:04:31.770> we're<00:04:32.070> worse<00:04:32.250> with<00:04:32.400> a

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
definitely possible we're worse with a

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.010 
definitely possible we're worse with a
hydraulic<00:04:32.910> roller<00:04:33.090> which<00:04:33.330> is<00:04:33.360> what<00:04:33.840> I

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.260 
driving my car I put a hydraulic roller

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.290 
driving my car I put a hydraulic roller
in<00:04:40.500> there<00:04:40.680> and<00:04:40.950> I<00:04:41.580> don't<00:04:41.820> really<00:04:42.090> plan<00:04:42.240> on

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
in there and I don't really plan on

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.910 
in there and I don't really plan on
Revenue<00:04:42.690> past<00:04:42.900> sixty-five<00:04:43.410> hundred<00:04:43.440> and<00:04:43.860> I'm

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:43.920 
Revenue past sixty-five hundred and I'm

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.200 
Revenue past sixty-five hundred and I'm
okay<00:04:44.160> with<00:04:44.190> that<00:04:44.430> so<00:04:44.610> it<00:04:44.700> all<00:04:44.790> depends<00:04:45.120> on

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
okay with that so it all depends on

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.330 
okay with that so it all depends on
again<00:04:45.750> how<00:04:46.200> you<00:04:46.260> plan<00:04:46.560> on<00:04:46.590> driving<00:04:46.830> your<00:04:47.130> car

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
again how you plan on driving your car

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.450 
again how you plan on driving your car
and<00:04:47.550> what<00:04:47.820> you<00:04:47.940> want<00:04:48.120> out<00:04:48.210> of<00:04:48.270> it
