00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
high commitment track in other a lot of

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.200 
high commitment track in other a lot of
commitment<00:00:59.340> involved<00:00:59.550> in<00:00:59.730> those<00:00:59.820> corners

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
commitment involved in those corners

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.029 
commitment involved in those corners
high-speed<00:01:00.660> technical<00:01:01.260> sections<00:01:01.680> with<00:01:01.859> some

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
high-speed technical sections with some

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.100 
high-speed technical sections with some
slower<00:01:02.250> speed<00:01:02.550> sections<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.660> best<00:01:03.870> bit<00:01:04.080> about

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
slower speed sections the best bit about

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.870 
slower speed sections the best bit about
it<00:01:04.320> I<00:01:04.470> think<00:01:04.530> is<00:01:04.830> that<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.100> fans<00:01:05.549> are<00:01:05.670> gonna<00:01:05.729> be

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
it I think is that the fans are gonna be

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
it I think is that the fans are gonna be
able<00:01:05.939> to<00:01:06.090> sit<00:01:06.240> right<00:01:06.360> there<00:01:06.390> in<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.630> stands

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
able to sit right there in the stands

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.300 
able to sit right there in the stands
and<00:01:07.049> see<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.290> whole<00:01:07.439> thing<00:01:07.650> it<00:01:07.799> reminds<00:01:08.130> me<00:01:08.280> a

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
and see the whole thing it reminds me a

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.880 
and see the whole thing it reminds me a
lot<00:01:08.400> of<00:01:08.460> Cleveland<00:01:08.970> in<00:01:09.060> many<00:01:09.479> ways<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:09.960> we

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
lot of Cleveland in many ways and we

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.260 
lot of Cleveland in many ways and we
know<00:01:11.070> on<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.250> old<00:01:11.400> airport<00:01:11.549> circuit<00:01:12.119> when<00:01:12.240> you

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
know on the old airport circuit when you

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.630

everything<00:01:52.110> from<00:01:53.040> that<00:01:53.250> main<00:01:53.579> grandstand

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
everything from that main grandstand

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.550
