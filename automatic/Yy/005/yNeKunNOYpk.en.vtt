oh hi guys and welcome to our
knuckleball<00:00:13.710> tutorial<00:00:14.250> today<00:00:14.880> we<00:00:15.210> will<00:00:15.360> be

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
knuckleball tutorial today we will be

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.670 
knuckleball tutorial today we will be
going<00:00:15.660> through<00:00:15.839> the<00:00:16.109> steps<00:00:16.350> on<00:00:16.529> how<00:00:16.650> to

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
going through the steps on how to

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.320 
going through the steps on how to
achieve<00:00:16.920> an<00:00:17.190> operable<00:00:17.460> and<00:00:17.609> what<00:00:17.880> you<00:00:18.060> can<00:00:18.210> do

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
achieve an operable and what you can do

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.540 
achieve an operable and what you can do
to<00:00:18.480> get<00:00:18.570> better<00:00:18.630> and<00:00:19.020> quicker<00:00:19.380> but<00:00:20.220> first

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
to get better and quicker but first

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.130 
to get better and quicker but first
let's<00:00:20.820> start<00:00:20.939> off<00:00:21.240> with<00:00:21.420> some<00:00:21.600> examples<00:00:22.080> of

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
let's start off with some examples of

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:46.650 
let's start off with some examples of
our<00:00:22.260> best<00:00:22.470> knuckle<00:00:22.680> do

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:46.660 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.700 

so<00:00:47.660> before<00:00:47.990> we<00:00:48.080> can<00:00:48.230> teach<00:00:48.440> you<00:00:48.590> this

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
so before we can teach you this

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.440 
so before we can teach you this
technique<00:00:49.160> it<00:00:49.400> is<00:00:49.550> most<00:00:49.760> important<00:00:50.330> to

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:50.450 
technique it is most important to

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.990 
technique it is most important to
understand<00:00:50.840> what<00:00:50.990> I'm<00:00:51.110> a<00:00:51.200> fool<00:00:51.470> is<00:00:51.970> unlockable

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
understand what I'm a fool is unlockable

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.280 
understand what I'm a fool is unlockable
is<00:00:53.150> where<00:00:53.330> you<00:00:53.450> were<00:00:53.540> trying<00:00:53.690> to<00:00:53.930> create<00:00:54.140> as

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:54.290 
is where you were trying to create as

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.650 
is where you were trying to create as
little<00:00:54.320> spin<00:00:54.890> on<00:00:55.070> the<00:00:55.190> ball<00:00:55.310> as<00:00:55.580> possible<00:00:55.660> this

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 
little spin on the ball as possible this

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.120 
little spin on the ball as possible this
can<00:00:56.900> be<00:00:56.990> achieved<00:00:57.080> by<00:00:57.410> hitting<00:00:57.650> the<00:00:57.830> ball<00:00:57.980> in

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:58.130 
can be achieved by hitting the ball in

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:59.710 
can be achieved by hitting the ball in
the<00:00:58.220> right<00:00:58.340> contact<00:00:58.790> areas<00:00:59.120> but<00:00:59.330> we<00:00:59.450> will<00:00:59.570> go

00:00:59.710 --> 00:00:59.720 
the right contact areas but we will go

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.340 
the right contact areas but we will go
on<00:00:59.870> to<00:01:00.020> this<00:01:00.110> later<00:01:01.510> it's<00:01:02.510> important<00:01:03.080> to<00:01:03.200> have

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
on to this later it's important to have

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:04.870 
on to this later it's important to have
a<00:01:03.380> little<00:01:03.800> spin<00:01:04.010> on<00:01:04.040> the<00:01:04.160> ball<00:01:04.340> because<00:01:04.730> when

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:04.880 
a little spin on the ball because when

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:06.820 
a little spin on the ball because when
the<00:01:04.970> ball<00:01:05.150> is<00:01:05.180> in<00:01:05.420> flight<00:01:05.630> the<00:01:06.170> aerodynamics

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
the ball is in flight the aerodynamics

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.500 
the ball is in flight the aerodynamics
won't<00:01:07.070> be<00:01:07.220> able<00:01:07.340> to<00:01:07.550> play<00:01:07.730> pass<00:01:08.000> the<00:01:08.180> ball<00:01:08.360> in

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
won't be able to play pass the ball in

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.600 
won't be able to play pass the ball in
an<00:01:08.600> evil<00:01:08.900> way<00:01:09.130> therefore<00:01:10.130> when<00:01:10.280> the<00:01:10.370> ball<00:01:10.580> is

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
an evil way therefore when the ball is

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.640 
an evil way therefore when the ball is
at<00:01:10.850> its<00:01:11.000> highest<00:01:11.180> points<00:01:11.690> gravity<00:01:12.170> kicks<00:01:12.410> in

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
at its highest points gravity kicks in

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.110 
at its highest points gravity kicks in
choosing<00:01:12.950> the<00:01:13.160> aerodynamics<00:01:13.820> to<00:01:13.910> get

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:14.120 
choosing the aerodynamics to get

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.760 
choosing the aerodynamics to get
underneath<00:01:14.420> the<00:01:14.630> ball<00:01:14.660> suddenly<00:01:15.050> and<00:01:15.470> this<00:01:15.620> is

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
underneath the ball suddenly and this is

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.530 
underneath the ball suddenly and this is
what<00:01:15.920> causes<00:01:16.190> some<00:01:16.520> dramatic<00:01:17.000> movement<00:01:17.420> and

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
what causes some dramatic movement and

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.670 
what causes some dramatic movement and
insane<00:01:17.869> gets<00:01:18.110> burned<00:01:18.380> up<00:01:18.500> the<00:01:18.650> ball<00:01:20.500> so<00:01:21.500> the

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
insane gets burned up the ball so the

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:22.930 
insane gets burned up the ball so the
understanding<00:01:21.890> of<00:01:22.280> the<00:01:22.340> nothing<00:01:22.640> will<00:01:22.760> fade

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:22.940 
understanding of the nothing will fade

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:28.240 
understanding of the nothing will fade
up<00:01:23.090> let's<00:01:23.330> move<00:01:23.540> on<00:01:23.690> to<00:01:23.720> the<00:01:23.930> tutorial<00:01:27.250> first

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
up let's move on to the tutorial first

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.880 
up let's move on to the tutorial first
off<00:01:28.520> we<00:01:28.729> have<00:01:28.760> a<00:01:28.910> run-up<00:01:29.300> our<00:01:29.660> typical<00:01:30.350> run-up

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
off we have a run-up our typical run-up

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.700 
off we have a run-up our typical run-up
is<00:01:31.040> about<00:01:31.250> 67<00:01:32.030> steps<00:01:32.210> back<00:01:32.540> at<00:01:32.750> a<00:01:32.810> 45-degree

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
is about 67 steps back at a 45-degree

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:34.930 
is about 67 steps back at a 45-degree
angle<00:01:33.740> from<00:01:34.100> the<00:01:34.250> ball<00:01:34.430> and<00:01:34.640> where<00:01:34.790> you're

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:34.940 
angle from the ball and where you're

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.240 
angle from the ball and where you're
aiming<00:01:35.740> approaching<00:01:36.740> the<00:01:36.830> ball<00:01:37.010> should<00:01:37.190> be

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
aiming approaching the ball should be

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.790 
aiming approaching the ball should be
quick<00:01:37.550> and<00:01:37.700> direct<00:01:37.910> not<00:01:38.810> too<00:01:38.990> much<00:01:39.140> hesitation

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:39.800 
quick and direct not too much hesitation

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.050 
quick and direct not too much hesitation
but<00:01:40.010> as<00:01:40.160> you<00:01:40.310> learn<00:01:40.460> a<00:01:40.490> knuckleball<00:01:41.030> you

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
but as you learn a knuckleball you

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.670 
but as you learn a knuckleball you
develop<00:01:41.690> your<00:01:41.840> own<00:01:41.869> technique<00:01:42.350> which<00:01:42.530> is

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
develop your own technique which is

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.580 
develop your own technique which is
comfortable<00:01:43.100> for<00:01:43.160> you<00:01:44.410> finally<00:01:45.410> your

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
comfortable for you finally your

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.200 
comfortable for you finally your
standing<00:01:45.979> foot<00:01:46.220> should<00:01:46.430> land<00:01:46.580> about<00:01:46.820> 20

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
standing foot should land about 20

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.240 
standing foot should land about 20
centimeters<00:01:47.810> away<00:01:47.930> from<00:01:48.050> the<00:01:48.320> ball<00:01:48.500> facing

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
centimeters away from the ball facing

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.010 
centimeters away from the ball facing
where<00:01:49.400> you<00:01:49.490> are<00:01:49.580> aiming<00:01:49.760> this<00:01:50.540> will<00:01:50.720> be<00:01:50.870> the

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
where you are aiming this will be the

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.060 
where you are aiming this will be the
prime<00:01:51.230> position<00:01:51.380> for<00:01:51.710> a<00:01:51.920> knuckleball

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
prime position for a knuckleball

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.410 
prime position for a knuckleball
secondly<00:01:55.070> we<00:01:55.280> have<00:01:55.460> the<00:01:55.490> contact<00:01:56.000> areas<00:01:56.270> of

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
secondly we have the contact areas of

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.780 
secondly we have the contact areas of
both<00:01:56.600> your<00:01:56.780> foot<00:01:57.050> and<00:01:57.200> the<00:01:57.350> ball<00:01:57.530> the<00:01:58.340> contact

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
both your foot and the ball the contact

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.220 
both your foot and the ball the contact
barrier<00:01:59.090> you're<00:01:59.240> looking<00:01:59.540> for<00:01:59.810> is<00:01:59.960> on<00:02:00.080> your

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:00.230 
barrier you're looking for is on your

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.170 
barrier you're looking for is on your
foot<00:02:00.500> is<00:02:00.710> a<00:02:00.740> cross<00:02:01.040> between<00:02:01.250> the<00:02:01.460> instep<00:02:01.940> and

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
foot is a cross between the instep and

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.210 
foot is a cross between the instep and
your<00:02:02.270> laces<00:02:02.659> this<00:02:03.440> way<00:02:03.680> you're<00:02:03.860> generating

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
your laces this way you're generating

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.010 
your laces this way you're generating
lots<00:02:04.610> of<00:02:04.730> power<00:02:04.970> from<00:02:05.150> the<00:02:05.240> hardest<00:02:05.630> point<00:02:05.870> in

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
lots of power from the hardest point in

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.340 
lots of power from the hardest point in
your<00:02:06.110> foot<00:02:07.239> the<00:02:08.239> contact<00:02:08.720> area<00:02:08.989> of<00:02:09.019> the<00:02:09.110> ball

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
your foot the contact area of the ball

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.170 
your foot the contact area of the ball
is<00:02:09.530> crucial<00:02:09.980> and<00:02:10.130> needs<00:02:10.280> to<00:02:10.369> be<00:02:10.489> very<00:02:10.730> precise

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
is crucial and needs to be very precise

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.210 
is crucial and needs to be very precise
you<00:02:11.480> should<00:02:12.290> aim<00:02:12.410> to<00:02:12.440> be<00:02:12.650> kicking<00:02:12.980> the<00:02:13.070> ball

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
you should aim to be kicking the ball

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.890 
you should aim to be kicking the ball
slightly<00:02:13.550> under<00:02:13.910> center<00:02:14.300> of<00:02:14.420> the<00:02:14.480> ball<00:02:14.690> as

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
slightly under center of the ball as

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.770 
slightly under center of the ball as
this<00:02:15.110> reduces<00:02:15.500> the<00:02:15.769> risk<00:02:15.980> of<00:02:16.070> backspin<00:02:16.570> it<00:02:17.570> can

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
this reduces the risk of backspin it can

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.509 
this reduces the risk of backspin it can
help<00:02:17.930> to<00:02:18.019> put<00:02:18.290> a<00:02:18.320> logo<00:02:18.590> from<00:02:18.950> the<00:02:19.040> ball<00:02:19.220> in<00:02:19.370> that

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:19.519 
help to put a logo from the ball in that

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:26.680 
help to put a logo from the ball in that
position<00:02:19.700> so<00:02:20.180> you<00:02:20.269> know<00:02:20.420> where<00:02:20.600> to<00:02:20.750> hit<00:02:20.900> it

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.180 

the<00:02:26.810> contact<00:02:27.290> between<00:02:27.410> your<00:02:27.770> foot<00:02:28.010> in<00:02:28.130> the

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
the contact between your foot in the

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.770 
the contact between your foot in the
ball<00:02:28.370> should<00:02:28.610> be<00:02:28.730> minimal<00:02:29.090> and<00:02:29.420> it<00:02:29.570> should<00:02:29.690> be

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
ball should be minimal and it should be

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:42.070 
ball should be minimal and it should be
a<00:02:29.810> quick<00:02:30.050> and<00:02:30.290> direct<00:02:30.530> hit

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.080 

the<00:02:42.620> third<00:02:42.830> step<00:02:43.130> is<00:02:43.310> the<00:02:43.340> most<00:02:43.550> important

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
the third step is the most important

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:45.820 
the third step is the most important
step<00:02:44.300> to<00:02:44.510> another<00:02:44.720> ball<00:02:45.020> which<00:02:45.290> of<00:02:45.440> course<00:02:45.470> is

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
step to another ball which of course is

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.740 
step to another ball which of course is
the<00:02:45.860> follow<00:02:46.160> through<00:02:46.420> the<00:02:47.420> follow-through

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
the follow through the follow-through

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.420 
the follow through the follow-through
ensures<00:02:48.200> that<00:02:48.230> the<00:02:48.440> ball<00:02:48.620> will<00:02:48.770> not<00:02:48.950> spin<00:02:49.220> and

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
ensures that the ball will not spin and

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.730 
ensures that the ball will not spin and
therefore<00:02:49.730> create<00:02:50.000> an<00:02:50.120> ethical<00:02:50.480> effect<00:02:50.780> it<00:02:51.020> is

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:51.740 
therefore create an ethical effect it is

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.620 
therefore create an ethical effect it is
a<00:02:51.770> complete<00:02:52.220> opposite<00:02:52.700> to<00:02:52.880> a<00:02:52.940> power<00:02:53.180> free-kick

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
a complete opposite to a power free-kick

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.240 
a complete opposite to a power free-kick
