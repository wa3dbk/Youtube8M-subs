get the bulb of fat one which connects I
mean<00:00:32.759> um<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.210> there's<00:00:33.840> this<00:00:33.960> base<00:00:34.230> that<00:00:34.969> it

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
mean um and there's this base that it

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.549 
mean um and there's this base that it
comes<00:00:36.210> with<00:00:36.390> this<00:00:36.510> figure<00:00:36.899> that<00:00:37.110> you<00:00:37.200> can<00:00:37.230> have

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
comes with this figure that you can have

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.319 
comes with this figure that you can have
both<00:00:37.800> of<00:00:37.860> them<00:00:38.070> standing<00:00:38.579> with<00:00:40.190> so<00:00:41.329> yeah

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
both of them standing with so yeah

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.170 
both of them standing with so yeah
that's<00:00:42.540> pretty<00:00:42.660> much<00:00:42.780> it<00:00:43.140> for<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.379> box<00:00:44.180> and

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
that's pretty much it for the box and

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.330 
that's pretty much it for the box and
let's<00:00:45.780> get<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.860> statue<00:00:47.160> itself<00:00:48.050> hmm<00:00:49.340> this

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
let's get to the statue itself hmm this

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.209 
let's get to the statue itself hmm this
is<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.640> base<00:00:50.820> I<00:00:51.030> was<00:00:51.149> talking<00:00:51.570> about<00:00:52.219> here's

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
is the base I was talking about here's

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.930 
is the base I was talking about here's
the<00:00:53.340> peg<00:00:53.610> for<00:00:54.239> Darth<00:00:54.690> Vader<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.789> here's<00:00:56.789> the

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
the peg for Darth Vader and here's the

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.090 
the peg for Darth Vader and here's the
one<00:00:57.149> for<00:00:57.180> Boba<00:00:58.140> Fett<00:00:58.379> if<00:00:58.530> you<00:00:58.680> were<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:58.949> have

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
one for Boba Fett if you were to have

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.750 
one for Boba Fett if you were to have
them<00:00:59.309> standing<00:00:59.760> next<00:00:59.910> to<00:01:00.000> each<00:01:00.120> other<00:01:01.699> but<00:01:02.699> you

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
them standing next to each other but you

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.149 
them standing next to each other but you
can<00:01:03.059> have<00:01:03.239> him<00:01:03.420> by<00:01:03.600> himself<00:01:03.960> because<00:01:04.890> he

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
can have him by himself because he

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.980 
can have him by himself because he
pretty<00:01:05.880> well<00:01:06.090> balanced<00:01:06.510> you<00:01:06.630> don't<00:01:06.780> have<00:01:06.869> to

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
pretty well balanced you don't have to

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.320 
pretty well balanced you don't have to
worry<00:01:07.170> about<00:01:07.290> them<00:01:07.470> falling<00:01:08.060> there's<00:01:09.060> also

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
worry about them falling there's also

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.280 
worry about them falling there's also
this<00:01:09.780> alternative<00:01:10.560> base<00:01:10.830> they<00:01:11.189> can<00:01:11.400> use<00:01:11.670> and

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
this alternative base they can use and

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.200 
this alternative base they can use and
it's<00:01:13.290> basically<00:01:13.799> this<00:01:14.070> solid<00:01:14.670> matte<00:01:15.630> black

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
it's basically this solid matte black

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.999 
it's basically this solid matte black
base<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.240> what's<00:01:18.869> cool<00:01:19.140> about<00:01:19.170> this<00:01:19.590> if<00:01:19.799> you

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
base and what's cool about this if you

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.109 
base and what's cool about this if you
notice<00:01:20.340> there's<00:01:20.520> no<00:01:20.640> peg<00:01:20.909> holes<00:01:21.619> it's

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
notice there's no peg holes it's

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:26.660 
notice there's no peg holes it's
magnetic<00:01:24.119> so<00:01:24.150> you<00:01:24.720> can<00:01:25.439> just<00:01:25.650> have<00:01:25.950> there's

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
magnetic so you can just have there's

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.880 
magnetic so you can just have there's
magnets<00:01:27.150> on<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.540> end<00:01:27.869> of<00:01:28.020> Darth<00:01:28.320> Vader's<00:01:28.680> feet

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
magnets on the end of Darth Vader's feet

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.030 
magnets on the end of Darth Vader's feet
and<00:01:29.369> you<00:01:30.329> can<00:01:30.540> just<00:01:30.810> have<00:01:30.990> him<00:01:31.020> place<00:01:31.710> there

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
and you can just have him place there

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.609 
and you can just have him place there
and<00:01:32.369> you<00:01:32.579> don't<00:01:32.670> have<00:01:32.820> to<00:01:32.939> worry<00:01:33.119> about<00:01:33.210> him

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
and you don't have to worry about him

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:35.899 
and you don't have to worry about him
falling<00:01:34.619> over<00:01:35.070> tipping<00:01:35.430> over<00:01:35.549> or<00:01:35.790> anything

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
falling over tipping over or anything

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.920 
falling over tipping over or anything
and<00:01:36.689> this<00:01:36.930> is<00:01:37.110> actually<00:01:37.439> what<00:01:37.560> I<00:01:37.590> use<00:01:38.009> for<00:01:38.040> my

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
and this is actually what I use for my

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.760 
and this is actually what I use for my
display<00:01:40.220> it's<00:01:41.220> a<00:01:41.310> lot<00:01:41.520> more<00:01:41.729> secure<00:01:42.119> and<00:01:42.770> the

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
display it's a lot more secure and the

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.469 
display it's a lot more secure and the
magnet<00:01:44.189> is<00:01:44.310> not<00:01:44.490> that<00:01:44.729> strong<00:01:45.090> but<00:01:45.149> it's

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
magnet is not that strong but it's

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.440 
magnet is not that strong but it's
strong<00:01:45.720> enough<00:01:45.890> see<00:01:46.890> as<00:01:47.009> you<00:01:47.130> can<00:01:47.250> see<00:01:47.490> it<00:01:48.149> can

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
strong enough see as you can see it can

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.319 
strong enough see as you can see it can
pick<00:01:48.869> up<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.290> base<00:01:49.610> just<00:01:50.610> by<00:01:50.790> lifting<00:01:51.000> Darth

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
pick up the base just by lifting Darth

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.940 
pick up the base just by lifting Darth
Vader<00:01:52.820> this<00:01:53.820> is<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.530> alternate<00:01:55.530> hand<00:01:55.770> that

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
Vader this is the alternate hand that

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.209 
Vader this is the alternate hand that
you<00:01:56.040> could<00:01:56.159> have<00:01:56.310> him<00:01:56.490> with<00:01:56.670> I<00:01:57.950> kind<00:01:58.950> of<00:01:59.009> like

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
you could have him with I kind of like

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.389 
you could have him with I kind of like
him<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.700> way<00:01:59.729> he<00:02:00.000> is<00:02:00.030> right<00:02:00.299> now<00:02:00.500> but<00:02:01.500> if<00:02:02.250> you

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
him the way he is right now but if you

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.050 
him the way he is right now but if you
can<00:02:02.579> imagine<00:02:02.820> him<00:02:03.299> he'd<00:02:03.840> be<00:02:03.990> like<00:02:04.170> this

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
can imagine him he'd be like this

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.730 
can imagine him he'd be like this
pointing<00:02:06.060> I<00:02:06.240> don't<00:02:06.810> really<00:02:06.960> remember<00:02:07.320> this

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
pointing I don't really remember this

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.140 
pointing I don't really remember this
gesture<00:02:08.629> but<00:02:09.629> I<00:02:10.310> guess<00:02:11.310> it<00:02:11.520> was<00:02:11.640> in<00:02:11.790> Empire

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
gesture but I guess it was in Empire

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.100 
gesture but I guess it was in Empire
Strikes<00:02:12.209> Back

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
Strikes Back

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:19.070 
Strikes Back

hard<00:02:36.780> plastic<00:02:36.930> cape<00:02:37.620> and<00:02:37.980> it's<00:02:38.850> supposed<00:02:39.180> to

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
hard plastic cape and it's supposed to

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.630 
hard plastic cape and it's supposed to
look<00:02:39.480> like<00:02:39.720> a<00:02:39.750> statue<00:02:40.080> it's<00:02:41.070> not<00:02:41.250> supposed<00:02:41.580> to

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
look like a statue it's not supposed to

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.880 
look like a statue it's not supposed to
be<00:02:41.820> a<00:02:41.850> figure<00:02:42.230> otherwise<00:02:43.230> I<00:02:43.410> think<00:02:43.470> they<00:02:43.740> would

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
be a figure otherwise I think they would

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.690 
be a figure otherwise I think they would
go<00:02:44.070> with<00:02:44.250> the<00:02:44.370> cloth<00:02:44.640> cape<00:02:46.130> but<00:02:47.130> it<00:02:47.430> looks

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
go with the cloth cape but it looks

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.350 
go with the cloth cape but it looks
really<00:02:48.030> well<00:02:48.300> done<00:02:48.570> if<00:02:49.640> you<00:02:50.640> were<00:02:50.820> to<00:02:51.000> see<00:02:51.180> this

really well done if you were to see this

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.500 
really well done if you were to see this
figure<00:02:51.600> from<00:02:52.140> like<00:02:53.100> 10<00:02:53.340> feet<00:02:53.580> away<00:02:53.700> it<00:02:54.150> would

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
figure from like 10 feet away it would

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.330 
figure from like 10 feet away it would
look<00:02:54.750> like<00:02:54.930> a<00:02:54.990> miniature<00:02:55.440> version<00:02:55.590> of<00:02:56.130> the
