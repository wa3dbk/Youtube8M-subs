 Hi everyone, guys, welcome to this 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.350

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.019
 here on the fifa plaza canal for 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.099
 bring you the third episode of the squads 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.200
 builder 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.389
 first of all thank you for the success 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.670
 who had the last discounts from that 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.350
 last week than if you haven't 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.960
 visa invitation to see 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.590
 today, however, I am here to present you one 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:28.710
 team I have form 4 3 1 2 from 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.810
 total cost of about 40,000 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.390
 credits in this team are present 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.149
 even four players upgrade 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.160
 but let's go immediately to discover the porter 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.770
 of this team that the goalkeeper of 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:45.870
 real madrid iker casillas 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:47.280
 here it is 84 of 185 overall height 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.710
 then I must say that I expected 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.600
 a little bit more is not as bad as 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.530
 goalkeeper but we all know that i 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.350
 goalkeepers 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.270
 in this game they are a little go moments 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.190
 in short, sometimes they make great buildings 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.350
 at other times they make ducks 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:05.070
 incredible, however, a good goalkeeper 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.229
 casillas 5,200 credits its price a 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.340
 right we try the back of the paris 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.939
 saint germain 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.460
 wishes here it is here 77 of overall warcraft 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.439
 high high really very important for 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.600
 this player who is one of the best 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.210
 players of this team because it gives you 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.310
 truly an offensive contribution 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.170
 but also really in defense 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.590
 unbelievable I didn't expect it like that 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.680
 strong this player 750 believe his 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.180
 price and I must say that it is really worth it 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.890
 everyone next to him we find another 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.350
 player from real madrid and we are 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:41.790
 speaking of the French central defender 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:46.079
 raphaël varane 81 overall 191 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.909
 speed 76 high 80 defenses 76 of 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.640
 physical and ritual the spectacular player 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.310
 which I use very often in mine 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.520
 teams because it's really incredible 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.020
 next to him we find the first player 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.540
 upgrade of this team 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.700
 and I'm talking about nicolas otamendi 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.380
 here is the former central defender of the 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.649
 port 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:09.270
 183 of height 71 of speed 85 of 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.940
 defense 81 of life 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:14.640
 physical values ​​really good for 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.900
 a player that costs only 700 credits 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.490
 in game 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.220
 I must say that I was expecting something 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:23.010
 more but still remains a good defender 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.140
 central to the left we pass in the 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.640
 Italian league and we find the 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.120
 Juventus fullback 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:33.090
 patrice evra 80 of 79 overall 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.980
 physical defense speed 79 at 79 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.260
 how can we see statistics 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.080
 fairly homogeneous for this player 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.340
 who does his homework and as a fullback 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.110
 sinister is more than good 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.990
 passing through the midfield we find a 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.520
 right back to paris and we find 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:51.090
 Matuidi 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:55.020
 here it is 83 of overall high on the team 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:58.440
 working for him 78 of speed 84 of 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:00.300
 82 defense of physique and also a good 76 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.670
 passing a player really 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:05.550
 very complete that really knows how to do 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.140
 so everything will be great this 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.120
 French midfielder who surely 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.680
 you will know in the midst of this 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.320
 midfield we find another player 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:16.190
 upgrade and I'm talking 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:19.650
 enzo pérez a player really 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:21.900
 amazing and surprising 81 over 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.510
 look here for statistics on this 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:27.180
 really very complete player 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.160
 normal high the world trade so there 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.530
 also ensures good coverage in 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.030
 defensive phase 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.790
 1620 its price is at home reach 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.830
 an amazing player on the left dc 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:41.190
 this midfield we return to the 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:43.830
 juventus that we find roberto for eva 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.320
 that despite being a co there is fine 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:49.770
 in this position of mezzala seen i 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:52.530
 its warcraft high high 4 star pd 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:54.870
 weak 400 credits its price 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:57.390
 a truly incredible player who 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:00.390
 in game it really turns out to be a player 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.640
 amazing behind the tips we find a 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.890
 other player upgrades he received 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.800
 also an upgrade regarding the 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:10.650
 star skill and I'm talking about isco un 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:13.290
 player who finally becomes a 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.060
 excellent playmaker since he already had 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.010
 excellent statistics but the 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.120
 these four were missing 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.180
 stars move 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:23.449
 who sells a player really 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:27.630
 interesting 1,700 injured its price 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:30.900
 77 speed at 77 withdrawal 84 of 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:33.120
 passage and bale 87 in a player 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:36.360
 that goes forward seeing his 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:38.460
 low warcraft high so perfect in 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.660
 this module to support the maneuver 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.639
 offensive 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:44.100
 in attack guys we find two 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:46.979
 truly incredible French players 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:49.020
 on the one hand the real striker 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:51.570
 madrid karim benzema 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:54.300
 here it is guys the player more 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:56.699
 expensive than this normal low team 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:05:00.990
 in word trade 4 full weak stars 4 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:03.479
 stars move truth 84 of speed 84 of 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:06.930
 pass 75 pass 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:09.330
 82 of thrilling and 74 of physical one 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:11.789
 incredible attacker I used 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:14.460
 often in an attack that included one 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:16.590
 single tip but I have to say that with next 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.810
 another tip definitely much more 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:21.120
 effective aside we find him 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.720
 the last player upgrades this one 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.620
 team 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:27.510
 and I'm talking about alexander the little house 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:29.940
 82 more cutted overall than the 

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:33.690
 its previous high normal version 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:38.010
 work race 4 stars mobility 88 of 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:41.280
 speed 83 of god 72 of passage 85 of 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:43.440
 dribbling and 75 of physical a player 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.090
 really very complete in five 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.460
 matches but scored only one goal 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:48.620
 and two assists but I must say that anyway 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.520
 a player with potential 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:52.830
 unbelievable 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:55.470
 you will see the facts then in the clips a goal 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:58.080
 really amazing that he did 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:59.970
 so a really incredible attack 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.590
 for this team formed precisely 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:03.870
 from benzema and the cottage 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:05.789
