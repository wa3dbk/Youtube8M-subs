00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.950
 4 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:05.460
 at the same time 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.940
 we bet that we did not consider ourselves at the beginning 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.500
 nor form a band in the hotel ac 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.230
 psoe spokesman in the drag the next days the Andean region 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.660
 i the families of our monsa company 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:20.930
 do it like that 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.830
 I made that I had songs of mine in her songs, we started playing 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.590
 the weather ccoo 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.120
 the on track 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.560
 in journals and through friends of yours knowing others 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.070
 it was happening, we started playing in small rooms in Madrid 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.100
 and people do not let renÃ© beat that we recorded a demo 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.520
 with these issues i 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.660
 i agreed internet 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.660
 and from there we became a group created 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.720
 a whole without without thinking about how to do it lupo how it came out 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.170
 instinctively or unconsciously 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.499
 and the question I think that very little 

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:10.529
 towers gave modesty 

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:12.419
 with the members of the soundtrack 

00:02:12.419 --> 00:02:15.089
 pancho de venezuela namibia chile 

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:17.919
 we are from madrid but we like more of the bunch of types of music 

00:02:17.919 --> 00:02:19.189
 different 

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:21.789
 so 

00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:25.649
 the navratil musical anger because suddenly it is to say everything that is not precise 

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:47.929
 everything emerged canteca 

00:02:47.929 --> 00:02:49.569
 in a thousand times 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:51.949
 very curious also has not been repeated 

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:53.729
 after her that I 

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:57.519
 that were like a period of time when people were on the street 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:01.689
 early sharing music after the law they got very cute very 

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:04.689
 restrictive with respect makes music to the street 

00:03:05.469 --> 00:03:07.149
 despite closing rooms 

00:03:07.149 --> 00:03:09.509
 in fact I could share not even 

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:12.399
 and aranjuez every time there is less cultural movement 

00:03:12.399 --> 00:03:16.259
 like at that time but when we started it was easy 

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:19.499
 let's do yesterday attended the morning and see what we stayed we are not a square 

00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:21.699
 and there were people there who take 

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:24.699
 three instruments then network 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:26.619
 Guitar 

00:03:26.619 --> 00:03:29.689
 and the juggler saravia people also that around 7 

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:35.789
 that music is juggling different things and so on 

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:39.039
 and that's why he was also in the band because it represents a little 

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:43.679
 that moment what will live hilti the way we have to live it 

00:03:43.679 --> 00:03:47.029
 They wanted to go on stage to share with the people 

00:03:47.029 --> 00:03:48.489
 how do you think 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:51.909
 and in a few months later we continue as a band and a little 

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:52.949
 movement 

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:55.019
 it was disappearing 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:58.749
 we have come back to the truth that from youtube or private to the laws and 

00:03:58.749 --> 00:04:00.479
 restrictions no longer 

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:01.949
 next to kanasin 

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:04.949
 maybe we were lucky 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:33.020
