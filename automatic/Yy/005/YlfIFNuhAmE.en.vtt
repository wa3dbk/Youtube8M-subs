on<00:00:28.410> Jacoby<00:00:28.680> Jones<00:00:28.880> we<00:00:29.880> would<00:00:30.029> have<00:00:30.119> been<00:00:30.210> up<00:00:30.359> by

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
on Jacoby Jones we would have been up by

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.459 
on Jacoby Jones we would have been up by
13<00:00:31.489> how<00:00:32.489> is<00:00:32.640> it<00:00:32.759> offensive<00:00:33.059> pass<00:00:33.360> interference

00:00:33.459 --> 00:00:33.469 
13 how is it offensive pass interference

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:37.459 
13 how is it offensive pass interference
when<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:35.219> cornerback<00:00:35.880> has<00:00:36.480> his<00:00:36.750> back<00:00:37.079> to<00:00:37.440> the

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
when the cornerback has his back to the

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.770 
when the cornerback has his back to the
ball<00:00:37.770> in<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.129> end<00:00:38.489> zone<00:00:38.610> giving<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.600> wide

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
ball in the end zone giving the wide

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.500 
ball in the end zone giving the wide
receiver<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.320> bear<00:00:40.800> hug<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.940> wide<00:00:42.090> receiver

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
receiver a bear hug the wide receiver

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.270 
receiver a bear hug the wide receiver
manages<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.140> jump<00:00:43.440> up<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:43.710> catch<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:43.890> ball

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
manages to jump up and catch the ball

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.490 
manages to jump up and catch the ball
yet<00:00:44.520> I<00:00:44.760> think<00:00:45.420> they<00:00:45.570> thought<00:00:45.809> that<00:00:45.870> Jacoby

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
yet I think they thought that Jacoby

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.500 
yet I think they thought that Jacoby
Jones<00:00:46.649> was<00:00:47.039> on<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.309> defense<00:00:47.700> because<00:00:48.390> at

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
Jones was on the defense because at

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.639 
Jones was on the defense because at
first<00:00:48.660> all<00:00:48.899> they<00:00:49.079> call<00:00:49.260> it<00:00:49.320> was<00:00:49.410> pass

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
first all they call it was pass

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.200 
first all they call it was pass
interference<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:50.430> then<00:00:50.489> I<00:00:50.760> think<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.090> guy

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
interference and then I think the guy

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.639 
interference and then I think the guy
felt<00:00:51.539> like<00:00:51.660> an<00:00:51.780> idiot<00:00:51.989> when<00:00:52.320> he<00:00:52.440> said

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
felt like an idiot when he said

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.229 
felt like an idiot when he said
offensive<00:00:53.340> pass<00:00:53.489> interference<00:00:53.780> and<00:00:54.890> I<00:00:56.239> mean

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
offensive pass interference and I mean

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.389 
offensive pass interference and I mean
that<00:00:57.570> that<00:00:57.840> right<00:00:58.050> there<00:00:58.079> killed<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.070> game<00:00:59.219> we

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
that that right there killed the game we

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.250 
that that right there killed the game we
would<00:00:59.520> have<00:00:59.609> been<00:00:59.699> up<00:00:59.820> by<00:00:59.969> 13<00:01:00.480> instead<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:00.989> six

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
would have been up by 13 instead of six

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.609 
would have been up by 13 instead of six
with<00:01:01.469> like<00:01:01.649> four<00:01:02.070> minutes<00:01:02.399> left<00:01:02.550> um<00:01:03.619> another

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
with like four minutes left um another

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.649 
with like four minutes left um another
play<00:01:04.920> Torrey<00:01:05.610> Smith<00:01:05.939> streaking<00:01:06.479> down<00:01:06.510> the
