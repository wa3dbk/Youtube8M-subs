00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:08.120
 it seems that the wave of manufactured cars 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:11.910
 in Brazil just how much sports frost 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:14.460
 So, anyway, who chooses a 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:18.320
 car also wants performance 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.320
 like the brave 1.4 t jet 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:23.880
 in him however one must look closely 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.680
 to suspect that has a motor 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.189
 nervous temperament hidden underneath 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.320
 Front Spoiler Mini Skirts 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.960
 wheels that show the 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.440
 brake painted red airfoil 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.780
 dual exhaust and new side and rear 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.880
 are the differentials from the version 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.770
 normal inside the story is another 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:49.190
 The whole environment has a 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:52.250
 sporting panel finish painting 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:56.030
 steering wheel lever tools 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.830
 investment bank and even support 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.050
 to the left foot to help the 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:02.510
 driver to steady the body in curves 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:06.740
 Now, let's go to what matters. Look at the 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:09.580
 motorzinho good motorzinho if you take 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:14.479
 in account that he is a cult 4 with turbo 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:17.479
 will say motorzÃ£o the so-called kosovo concept 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:21.920
 because small more consumption and much 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:24.560
 power and 152 horses in 2010 11 pounds 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.320
 torque by pressing the overboost button on the 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.330
 panel the good future of this pressure and he 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.880
 passes to 23 pounds 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:34.490
 at the same time as the programming of the 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.550
 engine electronics respond faster 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.770
 and the steering is more vivid ideal for a 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:42.590
 played more sportive since the brave t 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:46.009
 jet at this time arrives in a little more 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:48.259
 eight seconds that exceeds 205 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:52.340
 per hour and do not forget the consumption 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:55.039
 Look at the bomb Everything is orchestrated by a 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.380
 six-speed manual transmission as well as 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:59.600
 allows you to take advantage of the 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:03.110
 any situation but the couplings 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:05.780
 could be softer with wheels rim 17 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.179
 and wider tires and a longer suspension. 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.520
 low and kirm than the normal model but 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.940
 does not compromise comfort because it already 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.020
 Curves very well. 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.420
 is also one of the rare models 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:22.730
 Brazilians tending series controls 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:24.500

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.630

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.180
