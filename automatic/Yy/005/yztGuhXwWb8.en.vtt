things<00:01:30.360> we'll<00:01:30.540> look<00:01:30.630> at<00:01:30.810> what<00:01:30.960> we're<00:01:31.110> back

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
things we'll look at what we're back

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.550 
things we'll look at what we're back
here<00:01:31.560> is<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:32.520> rear<00:01:32.700> brake<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.810> brute<00:01:34.049> forces

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
here is the rear brake the brute forces

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.249 
here is the rear brake the brute forces
if<00:01:34.770> you'll<00:01:34.920> notice<00:01:35.130> there's<00:01:36.119> no<00:01:36.390> break<00:01:36.689> in

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
if you'll notice there's no break in

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.429 
if you'll notice there's no break in
here<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:37.799> then<00:01:38.610> there's<00:01:38.820> no<00:01:38.970> break<00:01:39.240> in<00:01:39.990> here

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
here and then there's no break in here

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.060 
here and then there's no break in here
the<00:01:40.650> brake<00:01:40.920> is<00:01:41.310> actually<00:01:42.030> right<00:01:42.180> in<00:01:42.210> here<00:01:42.630> and

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
the brake is actually right in here and

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.620 
the brake is actually right in here and
it's<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.220> multi-disc<00:01:44.850> wet<00:01:45.119> rear<00:01:45.299> brake<00:01:45.600> and

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
it's a multi-disc wet rear brake and

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.530 
it's a multi-disc wet rear brake and
what<00:01:46.439> that<00:01:46.590> means<00:01:46.740> is<00:01:47.040> is<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.939> wet<00:01:48.119> part<00:01:48.420> of

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
what that means is is the wet part of

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.210 
what that means is is the wet part of
that<00:01:48.659> is<00:01:48.840> that<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.170> brake<00:01:49.409> actually<00:01:49.829> rides<00:01:50.040> in

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
that is that the brake actually rides in

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.960 
that is that the brake actually rides in
the<00:01:50.280> same<00:01:50.490> oil<00:01:50.850> that<00:01:51.180> these<00:01:51.750> gears<00:01:52.079> right<00:01:52.350> in

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
the same oil that these gears right in

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.249 
the same oil that these gears right in
the<00:01:53.970> brake<00:01:54.180> is<00:01:54.360> on<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.540> drive<00:01:54.750> shaft<00:01:55.049> coming

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
the brake is on the drive shaft coming

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.560 
the brake is on the drive shaft coming
back<00:01:55.500> it's<00:01:55.710> multi<00:01:56.070> disc<00:01:56.340> because<00:01:57.210> that<00:01:57.360> keeps

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
back it's multi disc because that keeps

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.289 
back it's multi disc because that keeps
a<00:01:57.719> small<00:01:58.020> diameter<00:01:58.530> I<00:01:58.950> mean<00:01:59.729> if<00:01:59.820> you<00:01:59.909> had<00:02:00.000> a<00:02:00.030> big

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
a small diameter I mean if you had a big

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.050 
a small diameter I mean if you had a big
brake<00:02:00.750> big<00:02:01.290> diameter<00:02:01.500> brake

well<00:02:28.019> I<00:02:28.050> I<00:02:28.170> don't<00:02:28.860> believe<00:02:29.190> we've<00:02:29.370> replaced<00:02:29.700> a

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
well I I don't believe we've replaced a

well I I don't believe we've replaced a

yet<00:02:32.250> they<00:02:32.489> just<00:02:32.519> do<00:02:32.849> very<00:02:33.090> very<00:02:33.150> well<00:02:33.360> so<00:02:34.200> I

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
yet they just do very very well so I

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.050 
yet they just do very very well so I
just<00:02:35.069> love<00:02:35.280> it<00:02:35.430> and<00:02:35.549> it<00:02:35.670> works<00:02:35.850> good<00:02:36.060> too

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
just love it and it works good too

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.920 
just love it and it works good too

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
750 just and the less displacement these

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.259 
750 just and the less displacement these
are<00:02:45.299> carbureted<00:02:45.930> instead<00:02:46.170> of<00:02:46.290> fuel-injected

again<00:02:48.269> it<00:02:48.480> kind<00:02:48.690> of<00:02:48.750> helps<00:02:48.989> the<00:02:49.080> price<00:02:49.290> point<00:02:49.620> a

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
again it kind of helps the price point a

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.000 
again it kind of helps the price point a
little<00:02:49.799> bit<00:02:50.360> 650<00:02:51.360> CC<00:02:51.720> v-twin<00:02:52.010> full

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:56.780 
other thing I like about this solid rear
axle<00:03:53.489> bike<00:03:54.440> is<00:03:55.440> with<00:03:56.069> the<00:03:56.190> swingarm<00:03:56.579> rear

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
axle bike is with the swingarm rear

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.309 
axle bike is with the swingarm rear
suspension<00:03:57.269> I<00:03:57.450> think<00:03:57.720> it<00:03:57.840> gives<00:03:57.930> the<00:03:58.109> bike<00:03:58.290> a

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
suspension I think it gives the bike a

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:01.400 
suspension I think it gives the bike a
little<00:03:58.470> sporty<00:03:59.010> or<00:03:59.040> feel<00:03:59.400> to<00:03:59.670> it<00:04:00.230> the<00:04:01.230> lower

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
little sporty or feel to it the lower

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:02.990 
little sporty or feel to it the lower
center<00:04:01.769> of<00:04:01.829> gravity<00:04:01.889> and<00:04:02.400> because<00:04:02.609> I<00:04:02.700> like<00:04:02.850> to

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
center of gravity and because I like to

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.190 
center of gravity and because I like to
kind<00:04:03.389> of<00:04:03.420> ride<00:04:03.630> trails<00:04:03.959> fast<00:04:04.310> I<00:04:06.019> suits<00:04:07.019> me

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
kind of ride trails fast I suits me

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.430 
kind of ride trails fast I suits me
