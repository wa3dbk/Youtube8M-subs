in a clockwise fashion and it should be

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.760 
in a clockwise fashion and it should be
increasing<00:01:24.550> in<00:01:24.820> speed<00:01:24.940> if<00:01:25.390> it<00:01:25.539> is<00:01:25.720> not<00:01:25.959> just

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
increasing in speed if it is not just

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.160 
increasing in speed if it is not just
simply<00:01:27.220> remove<00:01:27.490> the<00:01:28.330> wires<00:01:28.600> that<00:01:28.929> go<00:01:28.990> to

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
simply remove the wires that go to

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.889 
simply remove the wires that go to
terminal<00:01:29.770> 10<00:01:30.160> and<00:01:30.429> terminal<00:01:31.330> 5<00:01:31.600> and<00:01:31.810> you<00:01:31.869> can

we<00:01:57.310> went<00:01:57.459> ahead<00:01:57.550> and<00:01:57.849> put<00:01:58.090> the<00:01:58.209> cover<00:01:58.240> back<00:01:58.750> on

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
we went ahead and put the cover back on

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.859 
we went ahead and put the cover back on
and<00:01:59.319> we<00:01:59.470> plugged<00:02:00.220> in<00:02:00.399> the<00:02:00.580> parameter<00:02:01.330> unit<00:02:01.569> and

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
and we plugged in the parameter unit and

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:04.050 
and we plugged in the parameter unit and
of<00:02:02.649> course<00:02:02.830> I've<00:02:02.979> got<00:02:03.009> the<00:02:03.130> power<00:02:03.429> on<00:02:03.610> it<00:02:03.910> this

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
of course I've got the power on it this

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.669 
of course I've got the power on it this
time<00:02:04.330> and<00:02:04.569> I'm<00:02:04.990> going<00:02:05.020> to<00:02:05.200> go<00:02:05.319> ahead<00:02:05.440> and

00:02:05.669 --> 00:02:05.679 
time and I'm going to go ahead and

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:07.440 
time and I'm going to go ahead and
reiterate<00:02:06.220> what<00:02:06.340> I<00:02:06.369> talked<00:02:06.670> about<00:02:06.970> we<00:02:07.209> have<00:02:07.420> a

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
reiterate what I talked about we have a

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.480 
reiterate what I talked about we have a
little<00:02:07.840> toggle<00:02:08.200> switch<00:02:08.619> this<00:02:09.009> one<00:02:09.190> in<00:02:09.340> this

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:09.490 
little toggle switch this one in this

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.690 
little toggle switch this one in this
particular<00:02:09.910> case<00:02:10.360> is<00:02:10.599> going<00:02:11.230> to<00:02:11.470> stf<00:02:12.099> and<00:02:12.340> SD

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
particular case is going to stf and SD

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.670 
particular case is going to stf and SD
and<00:02:12.940> that<00:02:13.390> will<00:02:13.540> give<00:02:13.720> the<00:02:13.870> start<00:02:14.170> command<00:02:14.530> I

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
and that will give the start command I

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.830 
and that will give the start command I
will<00:02:14.740> apply<00:02:15.099> it<00:02:15.160> now<00:02:15.430> and<00:02:15.700> our<00:02:16.450> motor<00:02:16.720> is

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
will apply it now and our motor is

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.600 
will apply it now and our motor is
starting<00:02:17.290> to<00:02:17.380> run<00:02:17.590> and<00:02:17.830> you<00:02:17.920> can<00:02:18.069> see<00:02:18.280> that<00:02:18.489> our

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
starting to run and you can see that our

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.479 
starting to run and you can see that our
speed<00:02:18.910> pot<00:02:19.180> as<00:02:19.390> I<00:02:20.080> turn<00:02:20.319> it<00:02:20.349> up<00:02:20.620> the<00:02:20.830> wheel<00:02:21.069> or

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
speed pot as I turn it up the wheel or

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:23.430 
speed pot as I turn it up the wheel or
the<00:02:21.550> motor<00:02:21.940> is<00:02:22.090> increasing<00:02:22.720> in<00:02:22.840> fashion<00:02:23.319> and

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
the motor is increasing in fashion and

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.540 
the motor is increasing in fashion and
starting<00:02:24.430> to<00:02:24.550> speed<00:02:24.790> up<00:02:24.970> and<00:02:25.560> as<00:02:26.560> I<00:02:26.739> take<00:02:27.370> the

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
starting to speed up and as I take the

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.760 
starting to speed up and as I take the
speed<00:02:27.790> pod<00:02:28.030> back<00:02:28.300> down<00:02:28.599> in<00:02:28.840> the<00:02:29.230> counter<00:02:29.560> clock

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
speed pod back down in the counter clock

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.550 
speed pod back down in the counter clock
direction<00:02:30.090> you'll<00:02:31.090> notice<00:02:31.390> the<00:02:31.570> motor<00:02:31.780> comes

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
direction you'll notice the motor comes

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.010 
direction you'll notice the motor comes
back<00:02:32.860> and<00:02:33.190> starts<00:02:34.030> to<00:02:34.120> begin<00:02:34.390> to<00:02:34.510> slow<00:02:34.720> and

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
back and starts to begin to slow and

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.950 
back and starts to begin to slow and
again<00:02:35.260> the<00:02:35.530> start<00:02:35.800> command<00:02:36.100> STF<00:02:36.910> TSD<00:02:37.450> by<00:02:37.780> go

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:37.960 
again the start command STF TSD by go

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.480 
again the start command STF TSD by go
ahead<00:02:38.200> and<00:02:38.290> apply<00:02:38.470> that<00:02:38.560> it<00:02:38.950> takes<00:02:39.130> away<00:02:39.370> the

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
ahead and apply that it takes away the

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.390 
ahead and apply that it takes away the
total<00:02:39.820> star<00:02:40.000> command
