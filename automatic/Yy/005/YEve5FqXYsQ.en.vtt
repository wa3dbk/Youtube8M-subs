sometimes used for radiator covers but I

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.210 
sometimes used for radiator covers but I
wanted<00:04:00.660> to<00:04:00.750> try<00:04:00.930> something<00:04:01.140> different<00:04:01.440> and<00:04:01.920> I

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
wanted to try something different and I

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.070 
wanted to try something different and I
love<00:04:02.460> the<00:04:02.670> look<00:04:02.820> of<00:04:02.970> cane<00:04:03.270> webbing<00:04:03.810> so<00:04:04.050> I

wanted to give that a try I did up

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.090 
wanted to give that a try I did up
getting<00:04:06.450> mine<00:04:06.630> online<00:04:07.140> and<00:04:07.500> I'll<00:04:07.620> have<00:04:07.800> a<00:04:07.830> link

details<00:04:11.580> this<00:04:12.360> was<00:04:12.510> a<00:04:12.540> bit<00:04:12.720> of<00:04:12.750> an<00:04:12.930> experiment

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 
details this was a bit of an experiment

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.350 
details this was a bit of an experiment
because<00:04:13.590> I<00:04:13.740> never<00:04:13.890> use<00:04:14.160> cane<00:04:14.610> webbing<00:04:14.970> before

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 
because I never use cane webbing before

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.110 
because I never use cane webbing before
but<00:04:15.660> I<00:04:15.840> love<00:04:16.049> the<00:04:16.260> way<00:04:16.380> it<00:04:16.440> turned<00:04:16.650> out<00:04:16.940> first<00:04:17.940> I

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
but I love the way it turned out first I

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.000 
but I love the way it turned out first I
had<00:04:18.270> to<00:04:18.420> soak<00:04:18.630> the<00:04:18.810> cane<00:04:19.020> webbing<00:04:19.440> in<00:04:19.650> lukewarm

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
had to soak the cane webbing in lukewarm

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.700 
had to soak the cane webbing in lukewarm
water<00:04:20.310> for<00:04:20.670> about<00:04:21.030> 2<00:04:21.450> hours<00:04:21.480> to<00:04:22.020> make<00:04:22.410> it<00:04:22.470> more

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
water for about 2 hours to make it more

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.370 
water for about 2 hours to make it more
supple<00:04:23.010> and<00:04:23.340> then<00:04:24.180> I<00:04:24.270> stapled<00:04:24.690> it<00:04:24.810> to<00:04:25.020> the<00:04:25.140> back

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
supple and then I stapled it to the back

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.000 
supple and then I stapled it to the back
of<00:04:25.680> the<00:04:26.070> frame<00:04:26.280> tapping

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
of the frame tapping

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:28.650 
of the frame tapping
the<00:04:27.190> staples<00:04:27.640> to<00:04:27.850> make<00:04:28.000> sure<00:04:28.150> that<00:04:28.300> they're<00:04:28.480> in

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
the staples to make sure that they're in

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.230 
the staples to make sure that they're in
all<00:04:28.900> the<00:04:29.050> way<00:04:29.550> you'll<00:04:30.550> want<00:04:30.760> to<00:04:30.820> put<00:04:31.000> in<00:04:31.090> as

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
all the way you'll want to put in as

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.810 
all the way you'll want to put in as
many<00:04:31.450> staples<00:04:31.840> as<00:04:32.200> possible<00:04:32.800> because<00:04:33.070> as<00:04:33.490> the

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
many staples as possible because as the

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.090 
many staples as possible because as the
King<00:04:34.030> dries<00:04:34.420> it<00:04:34.870> shrinks<00:04:34.900> and<00:04:35.620> that<00:04:35.800> creates

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100 
King dries it shrinks and that creates

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.100 
King dries it shrinks and that creates
tension<00:04:36.250> around<00:04:36.820> the<00:04:36.970> frame<00:04:37.300> so<00:04:37.660> if<00:04:37.780> you<00:04:37.900> don't

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
tension around the frame so if you don't

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.260 
tension around the frame so if you don't
have<00:04:38.260> enough<00:04:38.530> staples<00:04:39.040> evenly<00:04:39.550> distributed

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
have enough staples evenly distributed

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.360 
have enough staples evenly distributed
it<00:04:40.480> might<00:04:40.840> cause<00:04:41.110> your<00:04:41.350> frame<00:04:41.680> to<00:04:41.860> warp

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
it might cause your frame to warp

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.850 
it might cause your frame to warp
I<00:04:42.400> let<00:04:42.970> the<00:04:43.120> Caine<00:04:43.360> dry<00:04:43.600> overnight<00:04:44.020> and<00:04:44.230> settle

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
I let the Caine dry overnight and settle

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.860 
I let the Caine dry overnight and settle
and<00:04:45.100> then<00:04:45.430> I<00:04:45.460> poured<00:04:45.850> some<00:04:45.910> wood<00:04:46.360> glue<00:04:46.390> around

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
and then I poured some wood glue around

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.410 
and then I poured some wood glue around
the<00:04:47.200> edges<00:04:47.440> covering<00:04:48.160> the<00:04:48.310> staples<00:04:48.790> just<00:04:49.300> to

the edges covering the staples just to

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:51.300
