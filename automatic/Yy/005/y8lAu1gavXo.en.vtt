00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
magnets kind of hold them in place and

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.830 
magnets kind of hold them in place and
then<00:04:08.400> a<00:04:08.430> g-force<00:04:09.030> just<00:04:09.300> holds<00:04:09.510> them<00:04:09.600> on<00:04:09.720> as

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
then a g-force just holds them on as

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.900 
then a g-force just holds them on as
they<00:04:09.930> spin<00:04:10.170> all<00:04:10.860> right<00:04:11.040> so<00:04:11.280> now<00:04:11.430> it<00:04:11.489> sounded

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
they spin all right so now it sounded

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.670 
they spin all right so now it sounded
this<00:04:12.030> I<00:04:12.300> gotta<00:04:12.720> fast<00:04:12.989> forward<00:04:13.350> a<00:04:13.410> little<00:04:13.560> bit
