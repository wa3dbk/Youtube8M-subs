00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
is really nice the only problem with

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.039 
is really nice the only problem with
that<00:01:05.070> is<00:01:05.460> that<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:06.240> tomato<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.810> Chiefs

ponds<00:01:07.380> every<00:01:07.830> minutes<00:01:08.220> which<00:01:08.460> i'm<00:01:08.580> not<00:01:08.729> sure

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
ponds every minutes which i'm not sure

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.450 
ponds every minutes which i'm not sure
why<00:01:09.090> it<00:01:09.150> takes<00:01:09.479> so<00:01:09.570> long<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:09.869> spawn<00:01:10.290> but<00:01:11.100> it

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
why it takes so long to spawn but it

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.160 
why it takes so long to spawn but it
takes<00:01:11.700> quite<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.030> while<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.270> make<00:01:12.540> pizzas<00:01:12.810> and

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
takes quite a while to make pizzas and

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.380 
takes quite a while to make pizzas and
also<00:01:13.500> they<00:01:13.650> burn<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:14.189> lot<00:01:14.369> of<00:01:14.520> time<00:01:14.729> so<00:01:15.060> it<00:01:15.240> took

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
also they burn a lot of time so it took

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.359 
also they burn a lot of time so it took
me<00:01:15.450> like<00:01:15.689> i<00:01:15.930> believe<00:01:16.470> over<00:01:16.619> an<00:01:16.860> hour<00:01:16.979> just<00:01:17.159> to

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
me like i believe over an hour just to

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.390 
me like i believe over an hour just to
get<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:17.580> full<00:01:18.270> inventory<00:01:18.570> of<00:01:18.930> pizzas<00:01:19.290> but<00:01:20.070> it

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
get a full inventory of pizzas but it

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.219 
get a full inventory of pizzas but it
was<00:01:20.580> totally<00:01:20.939> worth<00:01:21.210> it<00:01:21.509> because<00:01:21.689> i<00:01:21.869> went<00:01:22.110> back

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
was totally worth it because i went back

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.990 
was totally worth it because i went back
to<00:01:22.380> lava<00:01:22.590> dragons<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.250> it's<00:01:23.430> much<00:01:23.610> easier<00:01:23.640> to

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
to lava dragons and it's much easier to

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.820 
to lava dragons and it's much easier to
get<00:01:24.330> away<00:01:24.450> from<00:01:24.570> p<00:01:24.869> cares<00:01:25.110> if<00:01:25.350> you<00:01:25.470> have<00:01:25.560> full

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
get away from p cares if you have full

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.399 
get away from p cares if you have full
inventory<00:01:26.070> of<00:01:26.340> pizzas<00:01:26.659> now<00:01:27.659> i'm<00:01:28.140> getting

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
pretty close to 55 mage which is going

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.390 
pretty close to 55 mage which is going
to<00:01:31.020> be<00:01:31.079> really<00:01:31.380> helpful<00:01:31.560> so<00:01:31.860> i<00:01:31.920> can<00:01:32.070> hide<00:01:32.250> out

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
to be really helpful so i can hide out

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.219 
to be really helpful so i can hide out
because<00:01:32.700> most<00:01:33.450> of<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.570> jobs<00:01:33.750> that<00:01:33.930> i<00:01:34.020> get<00:01:34.200> i

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
because most of the jobs that i get i

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.440 
because most of the jobs that i get i
have<00:01:34.439> two<00:01:34.560> low<00:01:34.799> alcohol<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.400> times<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:36.030> I

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
have two low alcohol the times and I

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.510 
have two low alcohol the times and I
still<00:01:36.659> get<00:01:37.079> a<00:01:37.140> decent<00:01:37.200> amount<00:01:37.560> of<00:01:37.770> money<00:01:38.009> but

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
still get a decent amount of money but

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.950 
still get a decent amount of money but
it'll<00:01:38.880> be<00:01:38.939> much<00:01:39.090> better<00:01:39.270> if<00:01:39.420> I<00:01:39.509> can<00:01:39.659> high<00:01:39.810> out

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
it'll be much better if I can high out

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.810 
it'll be much better if I can high out
because<00:01:40.740> most<00:01:40.979> of<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.159> money<00:01:41.340> I<00:01:41.430> guess<00:01:41.640> I

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
because most of the money I guess I

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.880 
because most of the money I guess I
spend<00:01:42.119> them<00:01:42.240> all<00:01:42.360> back<00:01:42.630> on<00:01:42.689> runes<00:01:43.110> so<00:01:43.710> I<00:01:43.770> pretty

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
spend them all back on runes so I pretty

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.560 
spend them all back on runes so I pretty
much<00:01:44.009> almost<00:01:44.310> have<00:01:44.640> nothing<00:01:45.119> left<00:01:45.299> in<00:01:45.479> the

start picking a bit more for supply

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:14.309 
start picking a bit more for supply
because<00:02:13.180> I<00:02:13.299> really<00:02:13.510> want<00:02:13.689> to<00:02:13.780> raise<00:02:13.900> my<00:02:14.079> range

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:17.729 
but the reason why I'm not really
working<00:02:16.209> on<00:02:16.480> it<00:02:16.659> is<00:02:16.840> because<00:02:17.170> the<00:02:17.379> only<00:02:17.530> way<00:02:17.709> I

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
working on it is because the only way I

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:19.920 
working on it is because the only way I
can<00:02:17.859> do<00:02:18.010> it<00:02:18.099> right<00:02:18.189> now<00:02:18.249> is<00:02:18.609> I<00:02:18.879> had<00:02:19.540> to<00:02:19.689> pick<00:02:19.840> up

and<00:02:21.969> it's<00:02:22.359> digsby<00:02:22.749> is<00:02:22.989> just<00:02:23.230> way<00:02:23.439> too<00:02:23.499> slow

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:23.889 
and it's digsby is just way too slow

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:27.179 
and it's digsby is just way too slow
with<00:02:24.099> it<00:02:24.129> so<00:02:24.790> I<00:02:24.849> decided<00:02:25.209> to<00:02:25.859> work<00:02:26.859> more<00:02:27.129> on

00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:27.189

they<00:02:29.200> hit<00:02:29.349> six<00:02:29.530> th<00:02:29.889> i'm<00:02:30.370> going<00:02:30.579> to<00:02:30.639> start<00:02:30.849> PK<00:02:31.209> a

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
they hit six th i'm going to start PK a

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:32.550 
they hit six th i'm going to start PK a
much<00:02:31.450> more<00:02:31.689> because<00:02:32.049> it's<00:02:32.170> going<00:02:32.260> to<00:02:32.319> be<00:02:32.439> much

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
much more because it's going to be much

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.649 
much more because it's going to be much
better<00:02:32.769> with<00:02:33.040> the<00:02:33.129> gods<00:02:33.340> bills<00:02:33.700> it's<00:02:34.540> not

00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:34.659 
better with the gods bills it's not

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:35.910 
better with the gods bills it's not
going<00:02:34.780> to<00:02:34.870> be<00:02:34.959> that<00:02:34.989> easy<00:02:35.139> to<00:02:35.349> kill<00:02:35.469> people

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
going to be that easy to kill people

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.830 
going to be that easy to kill people
because<00:02:36.040> the<00:02:36.579> god<00:02:36.760> spells<00:02:37.030> do<00:02:37.209> hit<00:02:37.450> a<00:02:37.480> decent

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
because the god spells do hit a decent

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.830 
because the god spells do hit a decent
amount<00:02:37.900> but<00:02:38.889> i<00:02:38.919> also<00:02:39.159> don't<00:02:39.790> really<00:02:40.510> have<00:02:40.629> good
