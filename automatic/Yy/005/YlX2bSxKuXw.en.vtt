understand because of course when you

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.440 
understand because of course when you

always<00:01:18.540> end<00:01:18.990> up<00:01:19.080> hating<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:19.680> like<00:01:20.060> four<00:01:21.060> days

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
always end up hating it like four days

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.730 
always end up hating it like four days
later<00:01:21.689> you<00:01:21.990> know<00:01:22.080> what<00:01:22.200> I'm<00:01:22.290> saying

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
later you know what I'm saying

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.240 
later you know what I'm saying
so<00:01:23.040> it's<00:01:23.220> like<00:01:23.430> it<00:01:24.420> took<00:01:24.750> almost<00:01:24.990> like<00:01:25.439> I'm<00:01:26.070> not

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
so it's like it took almost like I'm not

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.649 
so it's like it took almost like I'm not
even<00:01:26.369> if<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.700> whole<00:01:26.880> week<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.479> only

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
even if the whole week and the only

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.780 
even if the whole week and the only
reason<00:01:27.930> I<00:01:28.020> even<00:01:28.049> let<00:01:28.530> it<00:01:28.560> stay<00:01:28.829> in<00:01:28.860> a<00:01:29.040> week<00:01:29.250> was

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
reason I even let it stay in a week was

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.910 
reason I even let it stay in a week was
because<00:01:30.119> I<00:01:30.360> was<00:01:30.600> just<00:01:30.780> being<00:01:30.990> lazy<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.710> I

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
because I was just being lazy and I

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.069 
because I was just being lazy and I
didn't<00:01:32.280> feel<00:01:32.460> like<00:01:32.520> you<00:01:33.270> know<00:01:33.390> taking<00:01:33.840> it<00:01:33.900> out

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
didn't feel like you know taking it out

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.510 
didn't feel like you know taking it out
because<00:01:34.380> I<00:01:34.560> just<00:01:34.740> sold<00:01:34.890> it<00:01:35.040> in<00:01:35.189> and<00:01:35.340> you<00:01:35.400> know

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
because I just sold it in and you know

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.300 
because I just sold it in and you know
that<00:01:35.700> take<00:01:35.850> hours<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.210> do<00:01:36.540> but<00:01:37.350> it<00:01:38.250> was

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
that take hours to do but it was

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.230 
that take hours to do but it was
horrible

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
horrible

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.789 
horrible
after<00:01:39.869> around<00:01:41.420> I'd<00:01:42.420> say<00:01:42.479> like<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.140> fourth<00:01:43.500> day

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
after around I'd say like the fourth day

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.460
