00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.950
 to grant this interview to the Gazette 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.670
 from fennec we are in milan at the club was 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.160
 imposed 1 0 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.349
 what will tell us about this match 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:12.690
 there a victory of porto steve wallace has 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.160
 did that make a few matches we are 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.529
 although it feels on the ground 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.699
 what they do in training for the 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.650
 selected project will be running and then I 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.539
 be rank with 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.200
 according to the newspaper 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:27.630
 this is the opinion of 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:28.980
 thing we lived on while on a 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.290
 personal plan you made your entry into 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.290
 end of the match then eventually yes 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.780
 the atmosphere is so that's how 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:44.070
 monitor 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.070
 pretty strong mozy 2 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.020
 the situation will say you will need them 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.920
 that because there is a pretty dense with 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.610
 the fact that you played a match 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.800
 international 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:57.510
 but when I did I laughed where one 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.670
 then cross with this choice of evil 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.660
 chosen because here I wanted to progress 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.339
 I feel very strong but there the most 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.760
 great than four months because we have 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:16.670
 necessarily still 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:18.400
 days will be so much I had more 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.420
 of products at the beginning of the season 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.920
 right now there are so many 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.440
 it's something normal 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:33.860
 at your age or in a club like 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:40.240
 unitary how do you live there there are 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:40.240
 things the same normal rules 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.070
 we have it 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.530
 I assure to sell as much at home 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:50.280
 even on a thomas le Breton his titles 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.930
 most important and not needed 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.650
 he will hear show in general are in 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.650
 train to redo greenhouse 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.470
 stewards 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:02.490
 you imagine an ambitious player 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.510
 have not yet in stature to say of 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.310
 indisputable holder 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:08.660
 what is difficult to bombay was 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.660
 confident in his abilities 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:17.020
 our productivity thanks so much the noise 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.020
 which are indisputable 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.320
 see 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:26.610
 atmosphere to our qualities 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.450
 I propose to make his work 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.140
 simple 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.459
 to be honest then comes back to the inter 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.810
 it's the one he wanted for a 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.519
 moment he follow you and the coach 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.129
 mazzarri also made sure that you 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:39.450
 come on a season start you do we go 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:41.340
 to say that you are a player who counts in 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.739
 the mazzarri plans I register in 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:47.260
 a future project with akin term on 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:49.599
 imagine of course his relatives who 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.480
 when you did not want to 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:55.510
 wallonia around five months I 'm for 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.069
 also possible to stay very long 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.939
 go win 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:59.939
 the limit is to separate you 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:06.010
 2 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.629
 I'm here for you necessarily when a 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.159
 player does not play what we talk about 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:12.159
 transfers right now maybe you 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:13.780
 heard talk about tottenham the 

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:17.439
 club like that it's rumors 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:21.909
 good after that talk a lot I stay 

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:24.780
 focused on what I need to do on 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:24.780
 the training ground 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:30.750
 not at all I noticed a player 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:36.300
 do not hesitate I practically have a 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:37.590
 passion we will finish a little bit by a 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.090
 little word about the national team this 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.440
 week was a beautiful week wearing 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:50.489
 facing slovenia 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:57.209
 a goal a go wrong why a good 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:04:00.480
 match a clerk for that we managed to 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:06.500
 to make the match go things to 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:06.500
 work it's normal to move forward 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.920
 of what we called we also procured 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:14.430
 public so 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.280
 we can taste cash and we have 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.760
 bossed for 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.710
 do together 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:28.320
 this team from slovenia is a good 

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:30.780
 test for you danowicz not marked you 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.670
 brings a guard also to the rooms to 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.450
 the end me I remain discreet because 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:37.530
 it's not my thing 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:40.380
 so here it is my team with good 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:44.280
 players and quality but we have the 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:46.200
 hand on this land bordelais what is it 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.850
 that I can say about the evils that have 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:50.060
 started with the selection why 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:51.930
 is called calais more and recently said 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.930
 what can you tell us a word 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.060
 on their benefit 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.460
 not really 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:01.210
 very good start I'm happy for them 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:07.250
 it's not so bad to handle the pressure 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:09.139
 so my business has frankly 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:10.970
 these good players for the national team 

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:13.370

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:15.800
 I give good clubs and they have the 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:18.040
 luck from day to day which continues 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:20.630
 like that to see 

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:22.390

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:30.010

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:32.569

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:40.789

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:42.499
