it's<00:03:01.350> more<00:03:01.830> worthwhile<00:03:02.130> for<00:03:02.519> me<00:03:02.580> to<00:03:02.820> salvage

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
it's more worthwhile for me to salvage

now then once you're at level 50 it's

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.470 
now then once you're at level 50 it's
time<00:03:12.760> to<00:03:12.940> make<00:03:13.060> filigrees<00:03:15.000> so<00:03:16.000> go<00:03:16.150> ahead<00:03:16.390> and
