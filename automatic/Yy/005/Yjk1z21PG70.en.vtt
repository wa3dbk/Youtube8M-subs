00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.420
 I really love you guys. I loved it

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:36.120
 tax 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.649
 mom my boys that the hulk phenomenon the 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.660
 strongest player ever 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.420
 tried on this game is to 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.550
 sure i liked it more and so 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.520
 right from the start I tell you this 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.140
 player is a must try 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.949
 so try it you know the credits 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:55.260
 try it or buy them from fifa.com 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:57.210
 covert advertising for absolutely 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.219
 at least try it once in your 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.430
 life on this game you have to 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:06.180
 you know maybe maybe not ok is 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.770
 in short, I love the nif version of 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.530
 this player to the version fans not 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.350
 I tried it but the milo version 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.840
 I love it there really love to 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.909
 overwhelming perhaps in the unlikely 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.670
 to put precisely that agility is one of the 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.700
 against hulk I always remember that 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.740
 this player at 13 was really 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:28.829
 person who was strong was slow 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.689
 clumsy sipontino but two star foot 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.340
 weak is in fact the first against is 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.500
 the only one of this player is precisely 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.799
 those the two stars weak foot because 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:41.729
 if this player has either 4 stars 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:44.460
 weak foot I believe I would lower myself 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:48.180
 and I would do it now joking 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:52.409
 obviously though phenomenal guys 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:54.149
 phenomenal indeed the meeting and the 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.189
 against is the only stars are 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.750
 the two stars weak foot ok 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.000
 fortunately we have a player who 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.220
 he is a right-handed outsider and can be 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.230
 to center just pull with the left 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.150
 thank goodness because if we had had 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:08.410
 a sinister exterior would have been 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.590
 really a problem 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:14.890
 and since it is in my style of play 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.660
 return to the fact that maybe I go with 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.220
 one player is skillful and then mine 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.410
 centers and pitches 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.730
 here you have understood in short this is 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.640
 the only counter I found in 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.920
 hulk because others do not really have none 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.610
 found in general I will talk about 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.250
 this player 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.350
 starting now however from the prof because the 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.480
 first pro that we note in this 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.580
 player is obviously the speed la 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.680
 speed that tell you the truth do not miss 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.350
 it didn't seem 88 to me it seemed like a lot 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:44.770
 more and by much more I mean 92 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:46.780
 fateful fuck but this played 92 al 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:49.030
 93 speed then I look at the 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.630
 food card and and I realize only now 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.920
 which has 88 so the speed is 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.600
 absolutely absolutely promoted 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.580
 this player has a 91 of 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.470
 acceleration not 88 of sprint speed 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.050
 so you can understand this 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:05.500
 player takes the ball and then mom is the 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:07.120
 freccia is an arrow if it goes exposed 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.970
 all that is if we put 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.560
 the combined speed and strength we have 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.330
 the perfect player for this game 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.850
 because I really consider him the hulk 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:19.299
 perfect player par excellence of 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:21.160
 cheer 14 because of the features 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:23.049
 fundamentals of a player on the topic 14 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.780
 what must be or speed 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:28.239
 now strength because the speed then never 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:32.100
 stent this player to both for 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:32.100
 strangely I mean physical strength 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:39.360
 physical force 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:42.150
 we all have this player 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:45.380
 two all and two calls on both e 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:52.110
 so you can understand that it is my god 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:53.850
 second, however, it is the shot, the shot is the 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:57.270
 highest statistic in this player 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:04:00.420
 what could I put sticazzi that is not 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:07.100
 missing shot I had it with sniper 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:10.860
 then 93 of piro mai goodness then 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:14.160
 let's start with a list of the statistics 91 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.420
 shooting per lap perfect shot turns 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.730
 really great 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.680
 great excellent I don't have to add anything else 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:25.080
 when you shoot with a spin there it went 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:26.880
 at zero then 97 longshot and you can 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.160
 having noticed it even in the first clips that 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.640
 I made those absurd shots with this 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.790
 player 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:37.639
 because if we add long shot 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:37.639
 shooting power 90 997 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:46.350
 I'm really stucco putty's 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:48.210
 stone rock boys there is 99 of power 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:51.510
 shooting this player shoots from the half court 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:55.229
 and marks and marks and scores 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:58.560
 I have to say a note against the long 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:05:01.169
 shot is a little inaccurate in precise though 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.240
 still fantastic fantastic then 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:05.100
 add the volley that I believe 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.500
 that it is the most useless cunt in 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:10.800
 at least more useless less important shot 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:12.840
 and ok dribbling is really but 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.460
 really good we have a 89 against 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.930
 ball is a dream 90 in this 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.490
 player the man skips that a pleasure 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:20.010
 we also add the four stars 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:22.700
 disgusting skill skips that is a pleasure 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:25.380
 that is, if it leaves, it leaves you there 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:28.410
 if necessary but some skills 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:30.990
 fiction some non lo so ronaldo shop e 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:33.090
 if he goes away he leaves and if you go 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:35.880
 try to get there 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:38.610
 no no you will not go in for it 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:40.470
 this player at 92 of physical strength 82 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:42.450
 balancing so it's a wagon 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:43.500
 armed living this player really 

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:45.990
 a wagon 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.760
 armed living dreaming promoted mo the 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:50.460
 passage that is very important in 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:52.980
 a wing even if I used it as a striker 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:54.540
 hotter right has no right 

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:57.720
 however always a more important the 

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:59.850
 cross maybe rather than shooting though 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:01.560
 it is precisely born of must have 

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:03.630
 mainly shooting more than at 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.860
 passage at least I think it's for me 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:08.160
 it is so 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:12.420
 in short 86 very good passage 

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:15.740
 this player crosses to a very good 

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:18.900
 an excellent short passage and that counts 88 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:20.070
 in short, a good view on 76 e 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:22.919
 however the passage is really 

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:24.720
 good cross is great is really great 

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:27.390
 if you put on a hooked wedding rondo 

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:29.310
 even there we speak now of the 

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:29.880
 strength and balance then how 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:32.669
 i have gen 

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:34.890
 I have already mentioned this I believe 

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:36.450
 player is really monstrous because not 

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:39.270
 the sporting of a comma 

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:41.010
 so the perfect 92 and the balance 

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:42.510
 what would be so many of you maybe not 

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:45.210
 they do but the balancing is obviously 

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:48.330
 the balancing of the player who is 

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:51.620
 standing the balance is not higher 

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:54.210
 this statistic minus the player falls 

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:56.310
 the coupled strength shooting speed 

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:58.440
 pass for kids enough 

00:06:56.310 --> 00:07:00.270
 I said everything then the aggression the 

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:02.610
 positioning aggression is that 

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:05.130
 that is what statistics anyway 

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:07.169
 serves to maybe catch more ball 

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:08.940
 easily respect maybe it's a 

00:07:07.169 --> 00:07:12.330
 this player has little aggression 

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:15.479
 positioning player 91 85 e 

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:17.760
 excellent work aid mediums for a 

00:07:15.479 --> 00:07:20.520
 I'm really good at it guys 

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:22.050
 I think I was the clearest 

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:24.660
 possible for his player for that 

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:29.820
 what can I say besides that it is perfect 

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:33.150
 it costs 300 thousand on the playstation 3 145 thousand 

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:34.350
 on xbox and 580 thousand 16 boys at least one 

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:36.570
 Once the reveal approved 

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:38.160
 recommended that stronger power than 

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:40.890
 have you ever tried this game myself 

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:43.560
 product ronaldo and messi and ibra no well 

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:45.449
 maybe ibra is strong but oh well they are 

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:47.819
 leave father 

00:07:45.449 --> 00:07:49.889
 I recommend you leave a nice me 

00:07:47.819 --> 00:07:51.659
 like it's a nice comment and let me know 

00:07:49.889 --> 00:07:54.409
 your only one you tried in 

00:07:51.659 --> 00:07:54.409
 comments bye bye
