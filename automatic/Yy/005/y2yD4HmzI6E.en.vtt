00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
find that connection and keep the

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.020 
find that connection and keep the
role-playing<00:03:38.100> going<00:03:38.490> off<00:03:38.640> them<00:03:38.820> to<00:03:38.880> talk

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
role-playing going off them to talk

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.000 
role-playing going off them to talk
about<00:03:39.180> the<00:03:39.420> game<00:03:39.630> but<00:03:39.930> here<00:03:40.140> is<00:03:40.320> chance<00:03:40.680> to

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
about the game but here is chance to

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.630 
about the game but here is chance to
perhaps<00:03:42.110> facilitate<00:03:43.110> a<00:03:43.140> few<00:03:43.380> games<00:03:43.640> coming

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
perhaps facilitate a few games coming

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.490 
perhaps facilitate a few games coming
together<00:03:44.910> and<00:03:45.270> I<00:03:45.750> think<00:03:45.780> that's<00:03:46.110> a<00:03:46.200> really<00:03:46.410> an

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
together and I think that's a really an

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.610 
together and I think that's a really an
awesome<00:03:46.590> thing<00:03:47.010> when<00:03:47.640> you<00:03:47.790> can<00:03:47.970> do<00:03:48.090> that<00:03:48.120> and

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
awesome thing when you can do that and

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.380 
awesome thing when you can do that and
running<00:03:49.620> a<00:03:49.710> game<00:03:49.830> over<00:03:50.100> Skype<00:03:50.370> is<00:03:50.640> a<00:03:50.820> great<00:03:51.150> way

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
running a game over Skype is a great way

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.660 
running a game over Skype is a great way
to<00:03:51.710> experience<00:03:52.710> fine<00:03:53.130> with<00:03:53.280> people<00:03:53.460> you<00:03:53.550> could

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
to experience fine with people you could

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.850 
to experience fine with people you could
never<00:03:53.820> play<00:03:54.090> with<00:03:54.120> in<00:03:54.510> real<00:03:54.780> life<00:03:55.020> and<00:03:55.260> while

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
never play with in real life and while

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.710 
never play with in real life and while
it<00:03:55.980> does<00:03:56.130> have<00:03:56.250> some<00:03:56.400> drawbacks<00:03:56.640> the<00:03:57.180> upsides

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
it does have some drawbacks the upsides

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.420 
it does have some drawbacks the upsides
of<00:03:57.960> getting<00:03:58.530> to<00:03:58.620> play<00:03:58.770> with<00:03:58.920> those<00:03:59.010> people<00:03:59.190> all

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
of getting to play with those people all

of getting to play with those people all
around<00:03:59.550> the<00:03:59.670> world<00:03:59.760> can<00:04:00.150> really<00:04:01.110> help

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
around the world can really help

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.040 
around the world can really help
compensate<00:04:02.010> for<00:04:02.580> that<00:04:02.720> particular<00:04:03.720> if<00:04:03.990> you

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 
compensate for that particular if you

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:05.510 
compensate for that particular if you
find<00:04:04.290> people<00:04:04.590> who<00:04:04.620> are<00:04:04.710> look<00:04:05.010> very<00:04:05.220> like

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
mindset to you and that can be quite

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:08.930 
mindset to you and that can be quite
difficult<00:04:07.590> depending<00:04:07.950> on<00:04:08.250> what<00:04:08.400> your<00:04:08.520> mindset

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
difficult depending on what your mindset

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.410 
difficult depending on what your mindset
is<00:04:09.120> for<00:04:09.720> RPGs<00:04:10.470> so<00:04:10.890> let's<00:04:11.790> see<00:04:11.970> if<00:04:12.120> anyone

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420

it<00:04:16.500> up<00:04:16.710> as<00:04:16.830> a<00:04:16.859> failure<00:04:17.130> but<00:04:17.880> I<00:04:18.350> think<00:04:19.350> this

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
it up as a failure but I think this

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.580 
it up as a failure but I think this
