guys<00:02:14.560> what<00:02:14.770> I've<00:02:14.890> done<00:02:14.980> to<00:02:15.130> that<00:02:15.160> throttle

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
guys what I've done to that throttle

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:24.930 
guys what I've done to that throttle
linkage<00:02:20.430> this<00:02:22.920> this<00:02:23.920> is<00:02:24.070> the<00:02:24.190> throttle<00:02:24.400> cable

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
linkage this this is the throttle cable

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.690 
linkage this this is the throttle cable
and<00:02:25.120> I<00:02:26.580> put<00:02:27.580> this<00:02:27.700> bracket<00:02:28.090> right<00:02:28.690> here<00:02:29.110> and

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
and I put this bracket right here and

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.140 
and I put this bracket right here and
this<00:02:30.700> is<00:02:30.760> the<00:02:31.980> throttle<00:02:32.980> cable<00:02:33.250> of<00:02:33.550> a<00:02:33.670> gas

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
this is the throttle cable of a gas

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.420 
this is the throttle cable of a gas
engine<00:02:34.480> I<00:02:34.810> had<00:02:35.200> to<00:02:35.290> take<00:02:35.470> the<00:02:35.590> 6-2<00:02:36.040> diesel

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
engine I had to take the 6-2 diesel

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:37.890 
engine I had to take the 6-2 diesel
throttle<00:02:36.790> cable<00:02:37.120> out<00:02:37.240> because<00:02:37.510> it<00:02:37.660> wouldn't

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
throttle cable out because it wouldn't

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.500 
throttle cable out because it wouldn't
work<00:02:38.230> out<00:02:38.470> and<00:02:39.280> it<00:02:39.460> was<00:02:39.550> about<00:02:39.730> 2<00:02:39.970> miles<00:02:40.150> long

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
work out and it was about 2 miles long

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.050 
work out and it was about 2 miles long
and<00:02:40.690> it<00:02:40.810> had<00:02:40.900> a<00:02:40.930> different<00:02:41.200> end<00:02:41.560> on<00:02:41.710> it<00:02:41.940> so<00:02:42.940> this

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
and it had a different end on it so this

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.080 
and it had a different end on it so this
is<00:02:43.120> the<00:02:43.420> throttle<00:02:43.660> cable<00:02:43.960> I<00:02:44.170> come<00:02:44.380> up<00:02:44.530> with<00:02:45.090> and

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
is the throttle cable I come up with and

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.560 
is the throttle cable I come up with and
the<00:02:47.220> brake<00:02:48.220> line<00:02:48.460> I<00:02:48.490> got<00:02:48.760> the<00:02:48.910> brake<00:02:49.120> line<00:02:49.390> off

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
the brake line I got the brake line off

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.950 
the brake line I got the brake line off
the<00:02:49.920> short<00:02:50.920> bed<00:02:51.100> Chevy<00:02:51.370> I<00:02:51.460> had<00:02:51.700> out<00:02:51.850> there<00:02:52.030> so<00:02:52.570> I

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:52.960 
the short bed Chevy I had out there so I

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.770 
the short bed Chevy I had out there so I
didn't<00:02:53.380> have<00:02:53.470> to<00:02:53.650> splice<00:02:53.920> the<00:02:53.980> brake<00:02:54.310> line<00:02:54.550> or

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
didn't have to splice the brake line or

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.360 
didn't have to splice the brake line or
do<00:02:55.780> anything<00:02:55.990> other<00:02:56.320> than<00:02:56.530> just<00:02:56.890> pull<00:02:57.130> the<00:02:57.250> one

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
do anything other than just pull the one

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:58.710 
do anything other than just pull the one
off<00:02:57.490> the<00:02:57.670> short<00:02:57.910> bed<00:02:58.060> Chevy<00:02:58.330> you<00:02:58.450> head<00:02:58.600> out

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
off the short bed Chevy you head out

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.290 
off the short bed Chevy you head out
there<00:02:58.870> and<00:02:58.930> bolt<00:02:59.200> the<00:02:59.320> right<00:02:59.500> up<00:02:59.880> and<00:03:00.880> see<00:03:01.090> what

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
there and bolt the right up and see what

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.650 
there and bolt the right up and see what
else

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660

oh<00:03:02.280> my<00:03:03.280> fuel<00:03:03.520> tanks<00:03:04.170> I'm<00:03:05.170> not<00:03:05.410> going<00:03:05.620> to<00:03:05.680> be

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:05.770 
oh my fuel tanks I'm not going to be

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.580 
oh my fuel tanks I'm not going to be
able<00:03:05.860> to<00:03:06.540> have<00:03:07.540> fuel<00:03:07.840> thanks<00:03:08.170> for<00:03:08.350> a<00:03:08.410> little

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
able to have fuel thanks for a little

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.470 
able to have fuel thanks for a little
while<00:03:08.740> because<00:03:09.640> I<00:03:09.970> don't<00:03:10.150> have<00:03:10.270> anything

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
while because I don't have anything

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.260 
while because I don't have anything
that's<00:03:10.570> really<00:03:11.170> worth<00:03:11.350> a<00:03:11.500> dang<00:03:11.680> so<00:03:12.130> I'm<00:03:13.090> going

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:13.270 
that's really worth a dang so I'm going

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.860 
that's really worth a dang so I'm going
to<00:03:13.330> order<00:03:13.480> a<00:03:13.600> couple<00:03:13.900> of<00:03:14.080> new<00:03:14.170> fuel<00:03:14.440> tanks<00:03:15.870> and

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
to order a couple of new fuel tanks and

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.600 
to order a couple of new fuel tanks and
the<00:03:17.590> transfer<00:03:18.520> transfer<00:03:19.240> case<00:03:19.450> linkage<00:03:20.610> it

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.610 
the transfer transfer case linkage it

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:26.790 
the transfer transfer case linkage it
bolted<00:03:22.000> right<00:03:22.060> up<00:03:22.360> no<00:03:22.840> problem<00:03:23.350> and<00:03:23.970> then<00:03:25.800> the

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:26.800 
bolted right up no problem and then the

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.070 
bolted right up no problem and then the
gearshift<00:03:27.280> I'm<00:03:27.610> going<00:03:27.790> to<00:03:27.850> have<00:03:27.940> to<00:03:28.090> make<00:03:29.050> a

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
gearshift I'm going to have to make a

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.449 
gearshift I'm going to have to make a
different<00:03:29.470> kind<00:03:29.620> of<00:03:29.680> a<00:03:29.800> linkage<00:03:30.160> for<00:03:30.340> this

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
different kind of a linkage for this

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:33.479 
different kind of a linkage for this
gearshift<00:03:31.000> because<00:03:31.239> it's<00:03:31.390> got<00:03:31.540> this<00:03:31.770> rod<00:03:32.770> that

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
gearshift because it's got this rod that

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:37.140 
gearshift because it's got this rod that
sits<00:03:33.760> right<00:03:33.880> here<00:03:34.650> it<00:03:35.650> goes<00:03:35.830> down<00:03:36.070> there<00:03:36.340> well

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
sits right here it goes down there well

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.490 
sits right here it goes down there well
that's<00:03:37.330> not<00:03:37.480> going<00:03:37.600> to<00:03:37.660> quite<00:03:37.870> work<00:03:38.050> out<00:03:38.230> so

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
that's not going to quite work out so

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.050 
that's not going to quite work out so
I've<00:03:38.590> got<00:03:38.770> to<00:03:38.890> design<00:03:39.040> something<00:03:39.700> a<00:03:39.790> little

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
I've got to design something a little

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.640 
I've got to design something a little
bit<00:03:40.180> different<00:03:40.570> on<00:03:40.660> the<00:03:40.780> gear<00:03:41.200> shift<00:03:41.470> linkage

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
bit different on the gear shift linkage

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.400 
bit different on the gear shift linkage
and<00:03:42.070> then<00:03:42.450> that's<00:03:43.450> about<00:03:43.540> it<00:03:43.900> we'll<00:03:44.050> be<00:03:44.200> ready

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
and then that's about it we'll be ready

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:45.960 
and then that's about it we'll be ready
to<00:03:44.500> take<00:03:44.620> it<00:03:44.890> for<00:03:45.040> a<00:03:45.070> test<00:03:45.280> drive<00:03:45.340> after<00:03:45.640> get

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
to take it for a test drive after get

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.949 
to take it for a test drive after get
this<00:03:46.320> shifting<00:03:47.320> linkage<00:03:47.709> changed<00:03:48.130> out<00:03:48.340> and

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
this shifting linkage changed out and

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:52.440 
this shifting linkage changed out and
for<00:03:49.959> a<00:03:49.989> fuel<00:03:50.260> tank<00:03:50.560> I'll<00:03:50.770> just<00:03:51.000> stick<00:03:52.000> me<00:03:52.120> a<00:03:52.180> 5

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
for a fuel tank I'll just stick me a 5

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.630 
for a fuel tank I'll just stick me a 5
gallon<00:03:52.630> gas<00:03:52.930> can<00:03:53.170> on<00:03:53.290> the<00:03:53.380> back<00:03:53.560> for<00:03:53.770> now<00:03:53.920> so<00:03:54.580> I

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 
gallon gas can on the back for now so I

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.510 
gallon gas can on the back for now so I
can<00:03:54.790> have<00:03:54.940> some<00:03:55.150> way<00:03:55.270> to<00:03:55.300> run<00:03:55.810> this<00:03:55.959> truck<00:03:56.520> and

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:57.520 
can have some way to run this truck and

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.520 
can have some way to run this truck and
then<00:03:57.640> get<00:03:57.820> this<00:03:57.970> bodywork<00:03:58.660> started<00:03:59.260> on<00:03:59.350> this

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
then get this bodywork started on this

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.520 
then get this bodywork started on this
thing<00:03:59.739> so<00:03:59.890> I<00:03:59.950> can<00:03:59.980> paint<00:04:00.340> it<00:04:01.260> so<00:04:02.260> that's<00:04:02.410> the

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
thing so I can paint it so that's the

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.100 
thing so I can paint it so that's the
update<00:04:02.650> guys<00:04:03.239> if<00:04:04.239> you<00:04:04.390> subscribe<00:04:04.900> get
