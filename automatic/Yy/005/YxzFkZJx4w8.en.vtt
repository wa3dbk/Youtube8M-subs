00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.830
 he repeated the clip I can say one thing 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.410
 you should already be a very good base 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.250
 back flip 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:09.450
 and 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:12.269
 Erik said this we are of course where he is 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:16.070
 To remove about a certain point of departure I do not 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.789
 need to fill up the body so 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.950
 wait for your knees 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.610
 the English 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:25.910
 important it is very good help new 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.910
 clip 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.950
 must be striking no one . 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.920
 then we 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:36.300
 for these palettes of shoulder 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:40.260
 of this 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.829
 at the same time the head should be thrown if 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.600
 you won't have a good beat 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:46.820
 sure to leave boring tales want 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.530
 recognizing you will be feasting either on a gainer 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:52.329
 you will do in the wall with your head when 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:55.329
 I’ve driven the principle I’ll show waffles 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:55.329
 of 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.560
 but 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.159
 Now I will explain how to make flips sound 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.510
 steps 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:30.610
 same principle on the first 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.690
 steps you should not be on having beaten 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.460
 somewhere we have to 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:39.640
 using the first step 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.640
 above push to put step 2 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.640
 this moment 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.170
 shorter trenches 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.170
 also do more in three steps 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:52.980
 same principle 5 4 till you can 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.980
 Shesha conjure is not for this dream Spock 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.500
 all the same nothing new principle 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:58.500
 no 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.360
 after how to learn very well 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.040
 do a magic equestrian wall though in 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.830
 principle you could not study on the sloping 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:15.550
 do immediately on a on a vertical wall 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:17.220
 everything is the same there is much here 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.520
 easier to get used to 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.520
 king 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:28.220
 talkative can still be done without grouping 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:30.830
 big here you already do 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.560
 hand due to the fact that boys 1 to fight 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:37.030
 which on the wall you have to choose 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:40.580
 here as if to throw out and due to this 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:44.150
 how to get on twisting and also 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.290
 breastfeed back your back but 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.690
 this is the maximum. 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.170
 confident steps she must remain so 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:54.690
 same as on facebook 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.690
 fuck and the first step is not you donkey 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:01.140
 Yes 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.230
 but 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:06.580
 with a stroke legs are much better twists and 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.390
 communicate day 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.390
 it's true so eagle 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.319
 just like we did oblique 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.510
 the wall was 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:27.180
 flocked here not all the same 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:31.250
 sure step on the wall max fire died 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.250
 we will feed the eye and all that 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.620
 both turned out okay
