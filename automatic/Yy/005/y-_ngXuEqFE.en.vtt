00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:06.170 
about is the left hook now personally
the<00:00:05.100> left<00:00:05.279> hook<00:00:05.370> is<00:00:05.520> one<00:00:05.640> of<00:00:05.730> my<00:00:05.819> favorite

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.230 
the left hook is one of my favorite
punches<00:00:07.010> the<00:00:08.010> reason<00:00:08.400> why<00:00:08.550> is<00:00:08.610> because<00:00:08.760> it

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
punches the reason why is because it

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.430 
punches the reason why is because it
takes<00:00:09.360> a<00:00:09.510> lot<00:00:09.630> of<00:00:09.780> technique<00:00:10.050> to<00:00:10.080> be<00:00:10.170> left<00:00:10.349> over

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
J's got to go back into his one two

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.330 
J's got to go back into his one two
position<00:00:15.570> here<00:00:15.750> his<00:00:15.839> boxing<00:00:16.170> stance<00:00:16.379> and

position here his boxing stance and
you're<00:00:17.460> gonna<00:00:17.580> see<00:00:17.820> once<00:00:18.119> you<00:00:18.210> through<00:00:18.390> was

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
you're gonna see once you through was

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.620 
you're gonna see once you through was

were twisted he's now torqued to his
opposite<00:00:24.750> side<00:00:25.050> so<00:00:25.289> what<00:00:25.410> that<00:00:25.529> means<00:00:25.769> is<00:00:25.980> once

left hook a left hook is again not a
pledge<00:00:40.320> you<00:00:40.469> have<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.739> feel<00:00:40.920> aggressively<00:00:41.460> to

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
pledge you have to feel aggressively to

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.670 
pledge you have to feel aggressively to
punching<00:00:42.000> out<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.180> door<00:00:42.360> cleanly<00:00:42.870> loosely

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
punching out the door cleanly loosely

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.920 
punching out the door cleanly loosely
and<00:00:43.950> effectively<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:45.149> really<00:00:45.420> make<00:00:45.600> it<00:00:45.629> work

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
and effectively to really make it work

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.080 
and effectively to really make it work
so<00:00:46.680> you<00:00:46.770> can<00:00:46.920> see<00:00:47.039> what<00:00:47.219> he's<00:00:47.340> doing<00:00:47.640> is<00:00:47.789> he's

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
so you can see what he's doing is he's

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.270 
so you can see what he's doing is he's
going<00:00:48.530> popping<00:00:49.530> that<00:00:49.620> shoulder<00:00:49.829> back<00:00:50.039> on<00:00:50.219> the

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
going popping that shoulder back on the

going popping that shoulder back on the
right<00:00:50.489> popping<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.850> back<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.149> left<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:51.539> then

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
right popping the back the left and then

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.600 
right popping the back the left and then
rolling<00:00:52.079> it<00:00:52.140> around<00:00:52.230> throw<00:00:52.800> that<00:00:53.039> hook<00:00:53.250> on<00:00:53.489> the

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
rolling it around throw that hook on the

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.389 
rolling it around throw that hook on the
left<00:00:53.850> side<00:00:54.120> so<00:00:54.390> that's<00:00:54.570> as<00:00:54.750> one<00:00:54.989> two<00:00:55.350> three<00:00:55.949> two

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
left side so that's as one two three two

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.900 
left side so that's as one two three two
three<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.899> impact<00:00:58.320> point<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:59.579> make<00:00:59.760> this

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
three and the impact point to make this

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.549 
three and the impact point to make this
you<00:01:00.120> be<00:01:00.239> really<00:01:00.449> clear<00:01:00.690> on<00:01:00.719> this<00:01:00.930> impact<00:01:01.320> point

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
you be really clear on this impact point

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.709 
you be really clear on this impact point
over<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.800> hand<00:01:01.980> pad<00:01:02.190> is<00:01:02.430> you<00:01:03.329> got<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.570> make

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
sure those knuckles really hit in there

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.179 
sure those knuckles really hit in there
in<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.720> right<00:01:06.900> spot<00:01:07.409> on<00:01:07.650> that<00:01:07.680> left<00:01:08.040> hook

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 
time he throws that left hook that left

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.020 
time he throws that left hook that left
hand<00:02:02.530> comes<00:02:02.740> right<00:02:03.010> back<00:02:03.220> to<00:02:03.400> the<00:02:03.520> chin<00:02:03.790> he's
