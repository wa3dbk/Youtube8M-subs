hours prior to your competition

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.770 
hours prior to your competition
and<00:00:54.770> have<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.800> glass<00:00:55.980> of<00:00:56.250> water<00:00:56.399> with<00:00:56.699> that<00:00:56.969> why

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
and have a glass of water with that why

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.680 
and have a glass of water with that why
would<00:00:57.989> I<00:00:58.020> suggest<00:00:58.530> this<00:00:58.879> because<00:00:59.879> if<00:01:00.629> you

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690

sandwich<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:02.940> if<00:01:03.420> you<00:01:03.539> put<00:01:03.750> in<00:01:03.840> a<00:01:03.930> glass<00:01:04.140> of

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
sandwich and if you put in a glass of

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.490 
sandwich and if you put in a glass of
water<00:01:04.619> in<00:01:05.119> two<00:01:06.119> hours<00:01:06.720> what<00:01:07.080> does<00:01:07.170> that<00:01:07.350> going

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
water in two hours what does that going

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.330 
water in two hours what does that going
to<00:01:07.590> look<00:01:07.710> like<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:08.220> bunch<00:01:09.060> of<00:01:09.210> mush<00:01:10.159> but<00:01:11.159> if<00:01:11.250> you

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
to look like a bunch of mush but if you

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.310 
to look like a bunch of mush but if you
had<00:01:11.549> a<00:01:11.580> piece<00:01:11.909> of<00:01:11.939> chicken<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.869> you<00:01:12.930> put<00:01:13.110> in<00:01:13.200> a

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
what would that look like

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.330 
what would that look like
you<00:01:18.000> see<00:01:18.270> in<00:01:18.780> order<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.229> succeed<00:01:19.650> in<00:01:19.710> athletics

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
so much blood to try to digest that and
