which is kind of like a sea salt spray

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.930 
which is kind of like a sea salt spray
it<00:02:11.860> just<00:02:11.890> helps<00:02:12.280> give<00:02:12.340> your<00:02:12.580> hair<00:02:12.730> some<00:02:12.760> volume

it just helps give your hair some volume
and<00:02:13.420> hold<00:02:14.730> and<00:02:15.730> then<00:02:16.270> I<00:02:16.390> spray<00:02:16.630> a<00:02:16.660> little<00:02:16.870> bit

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
and hold and then I spray a little bit

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.230 
and hold and then I spray a little bit
of<00:02:17.140> that<00:02:17.320> our<00:02:17.650> route<00:02:17.860> to<00:02:18.130> because<00:02:18.430> again<00:02:18.460> helps

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
of that our route to because again helps

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:25.350 
of that our route to because again helps
us<00:02:19.410> volume

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.000 

I'm<00:02:25.840> just<00:02:26.050> going<00:02:26.170> to<00:02:26.230> be<00:02:26.320> drying<00:02:26.500> my<00:02:26.710> hair<00:02:26.860> with

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
I'm just going to be drying my hair with

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.190 
I'm just going to be drying my hair with
a<00:02:27.040> diffuser<00:02:27.520> I<00:02:27.940> just<00:02:28.360> flip<00:02:28.570> it<00:02:28.690> upside<00:02:28.990> down

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
a diffuser I just flip it upside down

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.420 
a diffuser I just flip it upside down
turn<00:02:29.590> on<00:02:29.740> hot<00:02:30.130> air<00:02:30.810> and<00:02:31.810> low-velocity<00:02:32.650> say

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
turn on hot air and low-velocity say

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:39.059 
turn on hot air and low-velocity say
yeah

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:03:02.470 

you

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:09.870 

you

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.740 

you

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:27.390 

you

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.580 

so<00:03:28.400> this<00:03:28.580> is<00:03:28.760> just<00:03:29.030> what<00:03:29.240> my<00:03:29.270> natural<00:03:29.900> curl<00:03:30.140> is

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
so this is just what my natural curl is

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.460 
so this is just what my natural curl is
just<00:03:31.100> with<00:03:31.220> a<00:03:31.250> diffuser<00:03:31.690> and<00:03:32.690> the<00:03:32.810> crow<00:03:33.050> stuff

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
just with a diffuser and the crow stuff

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.900 
just with a diffuser and the crow stuff
so<00:03:34.250> I<00:03:34.580> would<00:03:34.790> say<00:03:35.000> hi<00:03:35.240> but<00:03:35.390> probably<00:03:35.750> like<00:03:36.910> 90

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
so I would say hi but probably like 90

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.420 
so I would say hi but probably like 90
to<00:03:38.330> 95<00:03:38.810> percent<00:03:38.840> draw<00:03:39.470> right<00:03:39.830> now<00:03:40.010> I<00:03:40.040> guess

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
to 95 percent draw right now I guess

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.780 
to 95 percent draw right now I guess
almost<00:03:41.080> pretty<00:03:42.080> draw<00:03:42.350> so<00:03:43.340> then<00:03:43.550> I'm<00:03:43.670> just

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
almost pretty draw so then I'm just

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.050 
almost pretty draw so then I'm just
going<00:03:43.940> to<00:03:44.000> go<00:03:44.150> on<00:03:44.300> into<00:03:44.690> my<00:03:44.810> makeup<00:03:45.100> um<00:03:46.100> and<00:03:46.400> now

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
going to go on into my makeup um and now

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.230 
going to go on into my makeup um and now
that<00:03:47.270> I<00:03:47.300> cut<00:03:47.720> bangs<00:03:48.050> because<00:03:48.560> before<00:03:49.190> I<00:03:49.520> think

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:50.240 
that I cut bangs because before I think

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.430 
that I cut bangs because before I think
this<00:03:50.360> is<00:03:50.510> actually<00:03:50.750> the<00:03:50.990> first<00:03:51.110> time<00:03:51.290> I've

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
this is actually the first time I've

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:52.900 
this is actually the first time I've
worn<00:03:51.530> my<00:03:51.710> hair<00:03:51.740> curly<00:03:52.100> now<00:03:52.370> that<00:03:52.520> I<00:03:52.550> have<00:03:52.700> bangs

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:31.700 
the root and then I like to flip my

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.909 
the root and then I like to flip my
bangs<00:04:31.910> backwards<00:04:32.450> to<00:04:32.780> get<00:04:33.020> a<00:04:33.080> nice<00:04:33.500> sweep

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:33.919 
bangs backwards to get a nice sweep

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:37.000 
bangs backwards to get a nice sweep
across<00:04:34.220> my<00:04:34.460> forehead<00:04:35.110> if<00:04:36.110> you<00:04:36.320> don't<00:04:36.530> do<00:04:36.830> this

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010 
across my forehead if you don't do this

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:41.080 
across my forehead if you don't do this
step<00:04:37.400> it<00:04:37.730> will<00:04:38.300> just<00:04:38.540> kind<00:04:38.720> of<00:04:39.070> um<00:04:40.070> lay<00:04:40.640> on<00:04:40.940> the

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
step it will just kind of um lay on the

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:44.350 
step it will just kind of um lay on the
side<00:04:41.270> of<00:04:41.300> your<00:04:41.479> face<00:04:41.690> like<00:04:42.080> a<00:04:42.110> big<00:04:42.380> chunk<00:04:42.820> um<00:04:43.820> so

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
side of your face like a big chunk um so

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.360 
side of your face like a big chunk um so
the<00:04:44.960> ends<00:04:45.290> might<00:04:45.470> flip<00:04:45.680> out<00:04:45.830> a<00:04:45.860> little<00:04:46.040> funny

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
the ends might flip out a little funny

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:47.770 
the ends might flip out a little funny
but<00:04:46.580> you're<00:04:46.729> really<00:04:47.000> just<00:04:47.150> working<00:04:47.390> on<00:04:47.630> that

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
but you're really just working on that

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.659 
basically just do the top layer and this
just<00:05:26.449> helps<00:05:26.660> make<00:05:27.530> the<00:05:27.710> curl<00:05:28.010> look<00:05:28.340> a<00:05:28.460> little

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:28.669 
just helps make the curl look a little

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:31.719 
just helps make the curl look a little
bit<00:05:28.820> more<00:05:29.000> defined<00:05:30.070> it<00:05:31.070> gives<00:05:31.250> you<00:05:31.370> a<00:05:31.400> little

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:31.729 
bit more defined it gives you a little

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:39.269 
bit more defined it gives you a little
bit<00:05:31.850> more<00:05:32.000> volume

00:05:39.269 --> 00:05:39.279 

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:46.559

I don't really worry about the

00:05:46.569 --> 00:05:51.179 
I don't really worry about the
underneath<00:05:46.989> um<00:05:47.549> because<00:05:48.549> my<00:05:48.609> curl<00:05:49.769> is<00:05:50.769> already

00:05:51.179 --> 00:05:51.189 
underneath um because my curl is already

00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:52.739 
underneath um because my curl is already
defined<00:05:51.609> enough<00:05:51.999> and<00:05:52.209> they're<00:05:52.359> there<00:05:52.509> I'm
