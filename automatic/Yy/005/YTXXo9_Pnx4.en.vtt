00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.210
 positions with bari and more 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.589
 they are usually used for 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.900
 move to create new positions 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.900
 are those that therefore arise from the mi 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:17.130
 major and from the minor and those who 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:19.750
 they are born from the major and the minor 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.070
 so the same reasoning that 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.080
 we did for the agreement mi 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.230
 moving it forward we can do it 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:28.150
 for the agreement the and the minor moving it 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.800
 forward keeping in mind that though 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:33.370
 this time the sixth string does not have to 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:37.059
 then play if this is the change 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:39.489
 fingering to free the index e 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:41.290
 maintaining the form of the agreement mi 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:44.370
 move forward 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:48.700
 then after I will have the church is B flat 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:51.880
 then I'll have yes no etcetera etc. 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.800
 same thing with the minor I release 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.080
 the index then slightly changes the 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.300
 exposed position ahead begins to 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.670
 to shift 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:03.530
 the minor after cell sharp minor yes 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:06.240
 B flat minor if C minor 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.460
 sharp minor or D flat minor 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.470
 etc. etc. then you will understand 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.140
 very well that the first thing you should 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.940
 make and learn the notes as soon as possible 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.680
 on the head and on the fifth string for 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.140
 be able to use more freely the 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.210
 chords with bari dictates this thing 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.640
 one last detail remains to be explained 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.960
 how to make it sound good because 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.899
 then this is one of the main problems 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.520
 after understanding how it works 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:32.789
 then I suggest you first of all 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.610
 do not practice it at the beginning of the handle for 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:37.350
 the least when just approaching with the 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.700
 cheats because here the hands for harder and 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.979
 more difficult to make it play then 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.810
 starting from the third or even from the 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:47.190
 fifth key and remember one thing 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.050
 also in this case the must bar 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.539
 try to keep it as close as possible 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:54.450
 to the key the strength that will have to 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:56.789
 exercise will be less then not 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.740
 claim to keep the finger plate does not 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:02.160
 that is how it works indeed if you fear it 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:05.239
 flat with the rest of the fingers but 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:08.399
 try to keep it a little more on the edge 

00:02:05.239 --> 00:02:12.150
 on the outside of the finger doing one 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:16.620
 a kind of rotation and then concentrated 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:19.050
 on one thing this life is playing the 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.150
 the sixth is the first and the second so 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.190
 useless completely useless that you 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.860
 make strength in the center because in the center 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:29.220
 these firms that are in front play 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:31.770
 then turn to the side later 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.510
 try to help by changing the 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.959
 position as I told you for all 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.959
 other agreements 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:43.940
 and adjust the height of the index to do 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.730
 so that all the strings sound 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.350
 because one of the cases one of the reasons for 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.930
 which the agreement with the Bari are not 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:55.160
 always immediately and that sometimes the rope goes 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:57.230
 to position itself in the fold of the 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.520
 phalanx and then dampens them 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.820
 automatically the sound is one 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.820
 storytelling
