they<00:01:58.860> sound<00:01:59.100> a<00:01:59.190> little<00:01:59.280> bit<00:01:59.490> better<00:01:59.640> but<00:02:00.150> they

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.300 
they sound a little bit better but they

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.480 
they sound a little bit better but they
cancel<00:02:00.750> too<00:02:00.930> much<00:02:01.080> noise<00:02:01.350> around<00:02:01.500> around<00:02:02.070> me<00:02:02.280> I
