00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 hello good morning youtube people to whom 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.000
 auroux in a minecraft gameplay and 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.870
 well you will say what you do on the screen 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.680
 title and I say therefore the following 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.540
 ok you are watching a tutorial more than 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:19.770
 world no more province I want you to see 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:21.840
 that there are no tricks there is nothing worth 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.480
 made diamonds is a tutorial of how 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.720
 find diamonds now it will take a 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.189
 I am in charge of loading the world, 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.279
 I know if it will take a long time to make a cut and 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:35.220
 I'm going to leave you with the loaded world 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.110
 it's already going silly good I hope that 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.030
 you will say why nonsense because my mother 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.680
 I have cut myself and generated it is that 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:45.180
 It usually takes a long time to generate 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:47.600
 and well, we are here 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.910
 and you will say what you are going to do here 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.250
 show you the basic way of how 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.360
 find diamonds and a moment that I am 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.610
 fool and what he had done to the 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.530
 this was the beginning and you will say why it is 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.570
 doing this this is not good because 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.190
 I have no peak I do not have anything simply 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.629
 is for you to see that I have nothing but 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.710
 I do not have anything mounted 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:12.900
 I'm not going to catch a peak and it's already peak 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:17.250
 of diamond this is not 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:20.670
 be there and good then the first thing 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:25.740
 we have to do is not like this not a this 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:27.610
 down so I advise this and do 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.130
 A) Yes 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.320
 low insurance 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.659
 and yes but good as I am in 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.470
 creative, nothing bad will happen to me 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:40.280
 I guess to see 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:42.050
 layer 11 ok we 're going to the layer 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.390
 where you are listening to water is worth here 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:47.690
 layer 11 will surely look bad and not 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:51.770
 find diamonds but it's just 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:54.370
 the most efficient method a moment I'm going to 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.370
 go down a little 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.450
 I will leave 15 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:03.920
 and I will remove the music music 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:05.150
 sound still but the music does not 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.560
 listen to water I suppose you 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:15.110
 also to see then this must be done 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:17.750
 so the rest is worth it now because 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.810
 I need a little thing like that 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:23.670
 more or less now I'm going to catch torch x 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:26.310
 good night vision 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:29.670
 You can not do this but I 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.530
 if I'm deciding sancor and good 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.580
 you will say which is the most efficient method 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:37.920
 to find diamonds and I will tell you 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:40.100
 let's see, let's do a little bit to 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.880
 here 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:47.300
 I'm going to make sure layer 11 is 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:49.520
 yes, well, what you have to do is 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.140
 the next thing that would have to peak if 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.600
 itchy it with you and with your hand 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.010
 well I'm going to lower the lumens a little 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.360
 serious seats guys is that I do not 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:02.870
 listen to my moments and it 's a bit 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:04.610
 uncomfortable is worth here 1 1 2 and 3 of 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:12.710
 separation you will say 3 separation of 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:14.210
 separation 1 2 and 3 other 1 2 and 3 other 1 2 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:23.350
 3 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:26.360
 another 1 2 and 3 wait 1 2 and 3 others 123 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:30.050
 other 1 2 3 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:32.770
 another one and this one to take for ass you'll say 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:36.410
 because 13 separations will say a lot 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:39.560
 Well, not really 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:42.630
 well doing these tunnels we are 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:46.170
 seeing all this area 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:48.480
 but the easiest way picÃ¡ndolo the 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:53.069
 less stone and less 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:58.680
 possible thing you will say why because the 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:04:00.870
 Diamonds are generated are generated in two 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.489
 in two wide it can not always be one 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.010
 wide because it could not be generated in 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:07.859
 this cube would only have to be generated in 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.510
 this and in this for example I'm going to take 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:13.379
 a diamond 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:15.630
 I want you to see him see diamond 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:17.540
 diamond is worth 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:21.160
 for example if there was a diamond here 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:24.730
 here I would find it ending up here 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:27.190
 if there was a diamond here as always 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:28.690
 are generated with two width here would have 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.190
 another diamond then this melon 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:34.070
 contrary and this one would find me 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:35.750
 and the same with this voucher would find me 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.940
 I would like this crazy style contrary to 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:41.510
 this way over there then basically 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:42.849
 is that I suppose you have understood is 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:46.100
 easy 

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:47.870
 Well, I 'm going to cut 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:50.600
 and what I usually do is do 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:53.480
 this I will explain first this where 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.800
 puts x but x is the one that moves if x 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.130
 you see that it moves backwards and for 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:00.230
 ahead 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:05:03.500
 we are in x equal to 10 and it is worth 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:06.500
 let's take this corridor up to x 50 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:11.390
 and all up to x 50 then all up to x 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:14.990
 100 all up to x 150 all up to x 200 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:17.420
 and so on 50 and 50 little by little and we're going to 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:21.200
 explore this whole area layer 11 yo 

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:24.530
 well I found 23 diamonds in two 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:27.290
 hours that is very good is my record 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:28.220
 I mean that the following method or 

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:32.330
 can make a cut and I'll see 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:35.270
 reaching up to the layer until the 200th 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:38.030
 see how many diamonds I am now 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:39.110
 I'm telling you, chao and good guys, 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:41.030
 I just found this just 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:44.450
 finish all the tunnels I found 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:47.060
 this is that you do not know the amount of 

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:49.639
 diamonds that I found is that 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:51.409
 I have also left in an area 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:53.719
 full of lava you know that next to 

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:57.379
 the lava is usually generated more diamond 

00:05:53.719 --> 00:06:00.830
 but at no time did I wait for 

00:05:57.379 --> 00:06:03.979
 nothing but not at all get to such 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:05.389
 amount of diamond so now 

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:07.460
 I'll pick it up in survival 

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:10.279
 I hope not to die I'm going to take all the 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:11.810
 diamond of all the corridors this is 

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:13.590
 a nonsense that I have done I said look 

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:17.910
 what's left or am I going 

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:20.100
 that is, good things that happen and good 

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:22.410
 Well that's basically what I wanted 

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:24.990
 say now and well then now I'm going to 

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:28.680
 pick up the diamonds now I go back 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:31.680
 I hope it's about 20 I do not know one 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:33.480
 barbarity guys now I return mother of mine 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:40.410
 as I finished I was spending up 

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:43.260
 potion is 36 diamonds 36 so so 

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:45.990
 easy I hope because many Greeks has 

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:47.430
 used the creative I have not used the 

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:49.530
 creative used the creative for 

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:51.630
 do it faster but what has made me 

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:54.000
 found is that this is my 

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:55.290
 record cojones man I do not know how much 

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.720
 he would have done it in his rival that 

00:06:55.290 --> 00:07:00.210
 it's like I did with the 23 

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:02.400
 demands that I found but 36 

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:06.449
 diamonds 

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:09.599
 half an hour I will have been 

00:07:06.449 --> 00:07:11.529
 in creative and collecting minerals 

00:07:09.599 --> 00:07:14.649
 in 

00:07:11.529 --> 00:07:19.749
 in your survival you do not see here the 

00:07:14.649 --> 00:07:21.099
 experience here is a barbarity and 

00:07:19.749 --> 00:07:22.899
 Well that's what I wanted you 

00:07:21.099 --> 00:07:25.379
 teach now with your permission I'm going to 

00:07:22.899 --> 00:07:25.379
 do this 

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:31.500
 and good guys if you liked to give him the 

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:32.730
 you have to subscribe and if it has not 

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:35.370
 liked you can also like 

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:37.730
 subscribe good guys until the 

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:37.730
 next
