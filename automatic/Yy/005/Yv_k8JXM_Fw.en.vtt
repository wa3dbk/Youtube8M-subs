from your hands to graveyard attacking
of<00:00:43.800> your<00:00:44.219> monster<00:00:44.730> becomes<00:00:45.090> double<00:00:45.510> its

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
of your monster becomes double its

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.150 
of your monster becomes double its
original<00:00:45.899> time<00:00:46.050> during<00:00:46.350> that<00:00:46.559> damage<00:00:46.920> count

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
original time during that damage count

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.770 
original time during that damage count
only<00:00:47.430> so<00:00:48.360> in<00:00:49.230> this<00:00:49.440> scenario<00:00:50.270> pushing<00:00:51.270> painful

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
only so in this scenario pushing painful

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.410 
only so in this scenario pushing painful
actually<00:00:51.989> double<00:00:52.469> its<00:00:52.680> original<00:00:53.160> it<00:00:53.420> makes

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
actually double its original it makes

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.840 
actually double its original it makes
the<00:00:54.719> monsters<00:00:55.170> original<00:00:55.800> attack<00:00:55.980> become<00:00:56.699> it's

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
the monsters original attack become it's

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.670 
the monsters original attack become it's
a<00:00:56.910> real<00:00:57.059> double<00:00:57.480> its<00:00:57.570> original<00:00:57.899> attack<00:00:57.960> so

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
a real double its original attack so

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.619 
a real double its original attack so
does<00:00:58.770> that<00:00:58.829> mean<00:00:59.039> what<00:00:59.820> does<00:00:59.850> that<00:00:59.940> mean<00:01:00.180> it

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
does that mean what does that mean it

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.359 
does that mean what does that mean it
means<00:01:00.690> that<00:01:01.609> any<00:01:02.609> thing<00:01:03.210> that<00:01:03.239> tap

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
means that any thing that tap

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:07.160 
means that any thing that tap
modifications<00:01:05.369> would<00:01:05.820> be<00:01:06.210> negated<00:01:06.360> but<00:01:07.049> will

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
modifications would be negated but will

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.460 
modifications would be negated but will
be<00:01:07.260> obsolete<00:01:07.670> so<00:01:08.670> people<00:01:09.360> think<00:01:09.720> that<00:01:10.260> when

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
be obsolete so people think that when

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.649 
be obsolete so people think that when
booting<00:01:10.920> Canaan<00:01:11.250> but<00:01:11.430> mustard<00:01:12.330> bhushan

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
booting Canaan but mustard bhushan

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.050 
booting Canaan but mustard bhushan
attacks<00:01:12.960> into<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.740> monster<00:01:14.159> they<00:01:14.850> acted

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
attacks into a monster they acted

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.810 
attacks into a monster they acted
wouldn't<00:01:15.390> crane<00:01:16.070> before<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.310> active<00:01:17.490> in<00:01:17.610> pain

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
wouldn't crane before the active in pain

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.219 
wouldn't crane before the active in pain
and<00:01:18.030> damage<00:01:18.090> stuff<00:01:18.450> they<00:01:18.630> activate<00:01:18.930> glance

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
and damage stuff they activate glance

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.200 
and damage stuff they activate glance
they<00:01:19.680> think<00:01:19.890> that<00:01:19.920> it<00:01:20.189> would<00:01:20.280> actually<00:01:20.520> change

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
they think that it would actually change

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.149 
they think that it would actually change
its<00:01:21.420> attack<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:21.960> only<00:01:22.229> make<00:01:22.350> it<00:01:22.530> let's<00:01:23.070> say

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
its attack and only make it let's say

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.359 
its attack and only make it let's say
your<00:01:23.340> motto<00:01:23.490> make<00:01:24.479> it<00:01:24.509> only<00:01:24.780> 1000<00:01:25.770> attack<00:01:25.830> so

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
your motto make it only 1000 attack so

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.130 
your motto make it only 1000 attack so
you<00:01:26.490> think<00:01:26.670> that<00:01:26.700> way<00:01:26.850> only<00:01:27.000> 2000<00:01:27.630> Howard

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
you think that way only 2000 Howard

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.289 
you think that way only 2000 Howard
that's<00:01:28.200> not<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.500> case<00:01:28.790> we<00:01:29.790> can<00:01:29.939> create<00:01:30.090> makes

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
that's not the case we can create makes

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.719 
that's not the case we can create makes
to<00:01:30.360> look<00:01:30.540> at<00:01:30.630> its<00:01:30.780> original<00:01:31.200> attack<00:01:31.549> and<00:01:32.549> then

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
to look at its original attack and then

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.319 
to look at its original attack and then
doubles<00:01:33.329> that<00:01:33.509> so<00:01:33.810> 1800<00:01:34.650> so<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.790> gates<00:01:36.000> the

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
doubles that so 1800 so the gates the

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.760 
doubles that so 1800 so the gates the
one<00:01:37.290> out<00:01:37.439> 800<00:01:37.979> deduction<00:01:38.549> it<00:01:38.850> makes<00:01:39.030> it<00:01:39.770> 3600

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
one out 800 deduction it makes it 3600

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.109 
one out 800 deduction it makes it 3600
because<00:01:41.130> if<00:01:41.250> it<00:01:41.400> reads<00:01:41.549> its<00:01:41.729> original<00:01:42.060> attack

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
because if it reads its original attack

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.039 
because if it reads its original attack
at<00:01:42.299> 1800<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:43.560> it's<00:01:43.799> very<00:01:44.130> very<00:01:44.220> huge<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:45.049> tip

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
at 1800 and it's very very huge a tip

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.330 
at 1800 and it's very very huge a tip
that<00:01:46.350> a<00:01:46.590> lot<00:01:46.799> people<00:01:46.829> have<00:01:47.130> been<00:01:47.250> talking

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
that a lot people have been talking

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.719 
that a lot people have been talking
about<00:01:47.579> is<00:01:48.079> activating<00:01:49.189> honest<00:01:50.189> as<00:01:50.340> chain-link

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
about is activating honest as chain-link

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.520 
about is activating honest as chain-link
one<00:01:50.939> damaged<00:01:51.360> calc<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:51.720> then<00:01:51.899> Boojum<00:01:52.229> crane

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
one damaged calc and then Boojum crane

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.950 
one damaged calc and then Boojum crane
as<00:01:52.770> chain<00:01:53.159> link<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.520> which<00:01:54.270> would<00:01:54.509> then

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
as chain link to which would then

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.639 
as chain link to which would then
doubles<00:01:55.619> attack<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.610> then<00:01:56.850> increases<00:01:57.649> attack

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
doubles attack and then increases attack

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.709 
doubles attack and then increases attack
with<00:01:59.040> honest<00:01:59.460> you<00:01:59.969> do<00:02:00.090> it<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.240> other<00:02:00.270> way<00:02:00.450> we

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
with honest you do it the other way we

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.300 
with honest you do it the other way we
didn't<00:02:00.869> pay<00:02:00.990> and<00:02:01.110> what<00:02:01.170> would<00:02:01.350> happen<00:02:01.649> honest

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
didn't pay and what would happen honest

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.069 
didn't pay and what would happen honest
with<00:02:02.430> double<00:02:02.670> increases<00:02:03.390> attack<00:02:03.689> and<00:02:03.960> then

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
with double increases attack and then

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.850 
with double increases attack and then
crane<00:02:04.560> will<00:02:04.710> reduce<00:02:04.979> it<00:02:05.100> back<00:02:05.280> to<00:02:05.490> it<00:02:05.579> so

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
crane will reduce it back to it so

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.740 
crane will reduce it back to it so
tional<00:02:06.100> double<00:02:06.400> its<00:02:06.490> original<00:02:06.760> attack<00:02:06.820> making
