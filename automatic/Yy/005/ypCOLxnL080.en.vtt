00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
bike it has three cells the two cells on

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.030 
bike it has three cells the two cells on
the<00:00:27.630> right<00:00:27.930> were<00:00:28.320> almost<00:00:29.279> empty<00:00:30.679> you<00:00:31.679> can<00:00:31.859> see

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
the right were almost empty you can see

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.479 
the right were almost empty you can see
from<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.430> upper<00:00:32.969> and<00:00:33.120> lower<00:00:33.270> marks<00:00:34.309> this<00:00:35.309> is

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
from the upper and lower marks this is

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.530 
from the upper and lower marks this is
not<00:00:35.700> bad<00:00:35.940> news<00:00:35.969> when<00:00:36.420> you're<00:00:36.510> trying<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:38.540> get

not bad news when you're trying to get

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.760 
not bad news when you're trying to get
it<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.780> charge<00:00:40.079> I<00:00:40.469> have<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.399> charger<00:00:41.879> on<00:00:42.770> what

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
it to charge I have the charger on what

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.750 
it to charge I have the charger on what
I'm<00:00:43.890> showing<00:00:44.129> in<00:00:44.430> some<00:00:45.140> 0<00:00:46.140> it's<00:00:47.070> not<00:00:47.190> charging

I'm showing in some 0 it's not charging

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.130 
I'm showing in some 0 it's not charging
that<00:00:48.690> means<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.620> battery<00:00:50.010> is<00:00:50.070> probably<00:00:51.140> shot

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
that means the battery is probably shot

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.260 
that means the battery is probably shot
I'm<00:00:53.100> gonna<00:00:53.309> try<00:00:53.520> something<00:00:53.789> else<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.180> then

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
I'm gonna try something else and then

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
jump the battery circuit with the

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.880 
jump the battery circuit with the
battery<00:00:57.870> in<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.140> bike<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:59.100> see<00:00:59.340> if<00:00:59.489> I<00:00:59.609> can<00:01:00.890> get

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
battery in the bike and see if I can get

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.899 
battery in the bike and see if I can get
5<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.309> charge<00:01:02.550> ducks

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.850 

I'll<00:01:06.479> jump<00:01:06.750> up<00:01:06.900> with<00:01:07.049> this<00:01:07.200> other<00:01:07.380> bike<00:01:07.650> over

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
I'll jump up with this other bike over

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:15.289 
I'll jump up with this other bike over
here<00:01:11.240> that's<00:01:12.240> next<00:01:12.540> thing<00:01:13.400> I've<00:01:14.400> bypassed<00:01:14.790> the

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
here that's next thing I've bypassed the

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.180 
here that's next thing I've bypassed the
battery<00:01:17.030> from<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.090> townie<00:01:18.680> I've<00:01:19.680> used<00:01:20.009> some

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.190 
battery from the townie I've used some

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.789 
battery from the townie I've used some
ignition<00:01:20.939> cables<00:01:21.330> all<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.780> way<00:01:21.869> over<00:01:22.290> from<00:01:22.500> my

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
ignition cables all the way over from my

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.010 
ignition cables all the way over from my
bike<00:01:23.040> with<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.310> good<00:01:23.549> battery<00:01:23.940> all<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.810> way

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
bike with the good battery all the way

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.160 
bike with the good battery all the way
over<00:01:25.320> to<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.619> county<00:01:25.979> leads<00:01:26.390> here<00:01:27.390> what<00:01:28.080> I'm

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
over to the county leads here what I'm

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.960 
over to the county leads here what I'm
going<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:28.440> do<00:01:28.590> is<00:01:28.770> I'm<00:01:28.950> use<00:01:29.190> my<00:01:29.399> battery<00:01:29.850> to

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
going to do is I'm use my battery to

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.499 
going to do is I'm use my battery to
tune<00:01:30.180> up<00:01:30.590> this<00:01:31.590> Tony<00:01:32.580> but<00:01:33.000> I'm<00:01:33.119> afraid<00:01:33.240> that

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
tune up this Tony but I'm afraid that

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.580 
tune up this Tony but I'm afraid that
the<00:01:34.280> if<00:01:35.280> I<00:01:35.610> can't<00:01:35.970> bypass<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.350> put<00:01:37.500> the

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
the if I can't bypass and put the

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.719 
the if I can't bypass and put the
battery<00:01:37.770> back<00:01:37.979> in<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.580> box<00:01:38.819> and<00:01:40.190> have<00:01:41.190> it<00:01:41.369> self

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
battery back in the box and have it self

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.990 
battery back in the box and have it self
charged<00:01:42.179> which<00:01:43.110> may<00:01:43.530> be<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.710> possibility<00:01:44.220> then

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
charged which may be a possibility then

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.639 
charged which may be a possibility then
a<00:01:45.390> new<00:01:45.569> batteries<00:01:45.899> gonna<00:01:46.080> have<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.259> be<00:01:46.380> bought

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
a new batteries gonna have to be bought

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.590 
a new batteries gonna have to be bought
because<00:01:47.190> it's<00:01:47.340> this<00:01:47.819> batteries<00:01:48.240> probably

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
because it's this batteries probably

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.410 
because it's this batteries probably
came<00:01:48.960> with<00:01:49.170> it<00:01:49.319> and<00:01:49.890> there<00:01:50.670> are<00:01:50.789> very<00:01:51.060> good<00:01:51.119> old

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
came with it and there are very good old

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.880 
came with it and there are very good old
batteries<00:01:51.840> but<00:01:52.369> sometimes<00:01:53.369> they<00:01:53.569> they<00:01:54.890> they

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
batteries but sometimes they they they

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.120 
batteries but sometimes they they they
just<00:01:55.920> go<00:01:56.159> bad<00:01:56.340> and<00:01:56.550> that's<00:01:56.670> it<00:01:56.929> so<00:01:57.950> I'm<00:01:58.950> gonna

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
just go bad and that's it so I'm gonna

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.620 
just go bad and that's it so I'm gonna
see<00:01:59.399> if<00:01:59.429> I<00:01:59.549> can<00:01:59.700> start<00:01:59.909> this<00:02:00.060> up<00:02:00.240> tune<00:02:00.479> it<00:02:00.569> up

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
see if I can start this up tune it up

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.050 
see if I can start this up tune it up
see<00:02:00.840> what<00:02:00.990> you<00:02:01.049> do<00:02:01.200> I<00:02:04.459> can't<00:02:05.459> seem<00:02:05.549> to<00:02:05.729> get<00:02:05.909> it

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
see what you do I can't seem to get it

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.609 
see what you do I can't seem to get it
to<00:02:06.179> start<00:02:06.479> that<00:02:06.990> could<00:02:07.170> be<00:02:07.259> a<00:02:07.289> number<00:02:07.440> of

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
to start that could be a number of

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.090 
to start that could be a number of
reasons

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.710 

I'm<00:02:11.100> leaning<00:02:11.459> towards<00:02:11.700> bad<00:02:11.880> battery<00:02:12.299> but<00:02:12.420> I've

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
I'm leaning towards bad battery but I've

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.850 
I'm leaning towards bad battery but I've
also<00:02:12.989> found<00:02:13.440> a<00:02:13.820> wire<00:02:14.820> here<00:02:16.730> this<00:02:17.730> wire<00:02:18.030> goes<00:02:18.329> to

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
also found a wire here this wire goes to

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.729 
also found a wire here this wire goes to
this<00:02:19.860> coupling<00:02:21.200> evidence<00:02:22.200> shows<00:02:22.440> that<00:02:22.620> the

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
this coupling evidence shows that the

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.720 
this coupling evidence shows that the
wire<00:02:24.109> let's<00:02:25.109> just<00:02:25.320> rot<00:02:25.530> it<00:02:25.680> off<00:02:25.829> from<00:02:26.549> this

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
wire let's just rot it off from this

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.170 
wire let's just rot it off from this
area<00:02:27.090> right<00:02:27.269> here<00:02:28.670> so<00:02:29.670> I'm<00:02:29.760> going<00:02:29.880> to<00:02:29.910> connect

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
area right here so I'm going to connect

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.289 
area right here so I'm going to connect
that<00:02:30.239> back<00:02:30.359> up<00:02:31.130> it<00:02:32.130> hasn't<00:02:32.430> been<00:02:32.519> cut<00:02:32.760> it<00:02:33.060> just

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 
that back up it hasn't been cut it just

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:36.530 
that back up it hasn't been cut it just
wore<00:02:34.049> out<00:02:34.230> over<00:02:34.829> the<00:02:34.920> years<00:02:35.359> so<00:02:36.359> I'm<00:02:36.450> gonna

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
wore out over the years so I'm gonna

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.060
