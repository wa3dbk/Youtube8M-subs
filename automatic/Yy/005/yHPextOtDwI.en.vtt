00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.360
 and good to everyone that one tells them 

00:00:02.679 --> 00:00:06.070
 media I bring a new gameplay of 

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:07.870
 whites all with a lot of 

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:10.360
 information that will interest you 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:11.769
 and is that it already has date seems to be that 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:15.309
 an image that has been filtered 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:16.930
 it almost seems 100% real and 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:18.490
 it really is what we said had to 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.160
 be practically already by the dates and 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:23.080
 good these days have been pulling 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.730
 let's say any have enjoyed 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.520
 things the name was practically already 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:30.910
 Of course it was prising and good can 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.619
 be that the new tlc will not include 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.720
 new weapons I'm going to put the image here 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.910
 that it has come out and this is what 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.360
 will include a new good dlc of 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.500
 moment it seems that they are going to put maps 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.020
 multiplayer that to look like they are 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:47.140
 four the map of vertigo the map of 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.879
 encore the magma map that you have 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.290
 an incredible desire to brush it 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:52.750
 how is it really going to be a call in 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.950
 magma jowell of study the one of vertigo 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.899
 it seems that there is a kind of like 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:58.329
 of heliport imagine that the best 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:00.370
 you can do something so spectacular 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:02.860
 You can jump from the upper area of the 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.649
 of sport and others but especially if 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:08.079
 you look at the mode mod of the 

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:11.439
 dead that is the zombie map is like 

00:01:08.079 --> 00:01:13.539
 super I not really know if you look not 

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:15.609
 It really looks like super-gloomy 

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:17.200
 super tenebrous not like the rest of 

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:20.139
 zombie maps this seems really 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.969
 as I do not know too much death really 

00:01:20.139 --> 00:01:23.170
 as the name says and especially if the 

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:24.759
 magma map 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.219
 I do not know how you think the map can come out 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:29.829
 of magma what what I feel face 

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:32.380
 to the multiplayer that they will put equal 

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:34.539
 that the way to the best of town not of the 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.279
 zombie town map that you can 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:39.609
 burn with some things and with others 

00:01:36.279 --> 00:01:41.349
 I really do not understand it I do not know how 

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:43.060
 may be able to do something 

00:01:41.349 --> 00:01:44.499
 practically like that but good can be 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.560
 that the image is quite true and 

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:49.810
 quite real if you see the comparison and 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.639
 you remember the previous image is 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.560
 practically the same so it seems to be 

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:54.729
 that was indeed true for another 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.999
 record is that a couple of days ago 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:59.919
 it also leaked the image that they were going 

00:01:57.999 --> 00:02:01.239
 and quite that I had already come out of this 

00:01:59.919 --> 00:02:03.159
 because they had found some codes in 

00:02:01.239 --> 00:02:04.959
 the official call of duty page and 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:06.429
 practically then four or five days 

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:08.979
 after this picture has come out that 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:11.049
 It is practically 12 hours 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.480
 dawn image output means that 

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:16.569
 I think it's pretty news 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.360
 you know it leaves on April 16 for 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:21.310
 xbox a month later as always for 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.080
 the other platforms and personally 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.120
 I think that to be a map a pack of 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.129
 maps that can fly a lot of people are 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.230
 complained that they say that weapons like 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:31.090
 example the peacekeeper is super good and 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.069
 other people who obviously do not have 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.510
 monkeys you do not have the right and really 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.910
 I can say that it is not normal at all 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.069
 that is good indeed we are going to me 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.620
 personally I do not like it then 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:43.659
 there are a lot of things that have been left 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.920
 as well as in the air because maybe 

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:47.019
 it turns out that a lot of people masters can 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.910
 have complained about having put a 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:50.590
 weapon of a new dlc or else I wanted to 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.329
 put them simply at the beginning of 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:56.079
 game so that everyone would buy the 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:58.569
 again let's say the season pass this 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:00.099
 that costs 50 dollars 150 euros and of 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:01.959
 this way, let's say you think 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:03.310
 to draw on all the maps in all 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:04.480
 the times are going to get a new weapon and 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.579
 do not believe I know how many is what is 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.400
 I thought and suddenly here it seems that 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:11.410
 there is no new weapon maybe the 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.000
 picture let's say that hiding it was not a 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.890
 placed either directly or not is 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.069
 there's going to be a new weapon sincerely 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:20.290
 I have not the remotest idea but good 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:21.730
 seen what has been seen it seems that the maps 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.159
 study seem like it's obviously going to 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.460
 be located in the angels that you know 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:29.340
 that is the whole film industry 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:30.810
 in this area in the angels then 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.460
 good in the face of what has been the 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.490
 multiplayer as I tell you the Europe of 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:37.650
 magma that really does not fit in my head 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:40.080
 how can you make it easier because you 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.420
 sees everything as a lot of fire and so on 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.530
 study map as you have seen me 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.350
 I imagine it will be something like 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.700
 studies here from the angels good of 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:52.500
 here of the angels I say from there of the 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:53.700
 angels also on the encore map that 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.140
 seems to be something like a little 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.870
 more green I do not want to really 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:00.180
 in maps and with shrubs and so on 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.650
 as a bit like more of nature and 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.540
 then there is also the vertigo side 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.640
 vertigo that is how you have 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:09.150
 seen as with a helipad I do not know 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.980
 really how is going to be the map of the move 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.410
 of the dead many people say in the 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:16.260
 comments that was going to be based on the 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:18.450
 mission 1 of the mission of whites a 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.970
 call of cultured monkey go from vorkutÃ¡ 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.500
 when you go out there running and that the boss 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.420
 final was going to be the beast that consumed 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.220
 our company an uncle and super homes 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.930
 just when opening the door but good 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.850
 I really do not have the remotest idea 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.850
 as soon as I know anything else 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.449
 I'll tell you about it and nothing tempted me 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.520
 especially 

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:36.960
 especially twitter because I can see 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.819
 things that will interest you 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.050
 obviously I can not tell you so 

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:41.849
 nothing said what I hope you liked 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.620
 the video likes the video vote it where 

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:44.999
 I do not think I have put any weapons 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.339
 or what do you think it's going to be with the map 

00:04:44.999 --> 00:04:51.110
 this magma of the multiplayer and nothing not 

00:04:47.339 --> 00:04:51.110
 we just all see each other bye bye
