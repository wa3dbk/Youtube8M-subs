00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.720
 briefly mecca 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.130
 mike mike creative vice president 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.869
 disney television animation 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.490
 go out on him and some time ago u 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.080
 we were asked to create a new animated 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.500
 mickey mouse product 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.270
 this is not an easy task but you are very 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.329
 You can often make mistakes in pursuit 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:39.719
 relevance when trying to modernize 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:42.390
 characters you lose their essence we understood 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.040
 that we need to die a terrific dish 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.739
 artist and big fan 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.260
 disney classic animation we decided 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.930
 it would be great if he worked on 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.100
 plots and new fiction 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.100
 the interpretation of the mickey mouse 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.360
 the goal was to move away from a little tired 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.340
 traditions of the fifties and impart 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.500
 a certain fresh straw in terms of 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.900
 dynamics and scenarios and design 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:20.159
 but the main thing we managed to keep the balance 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.950
 of course I drew inspiration from 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.320
 classics I wanted to plunge into 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.220
 the atmosphere of those years when mickey is on my 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.829
 look was the coolest it is somewhere 30 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:34.020
 the regiment is one of the greatest artists 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:35.930
 animators of our time he managed 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.400
 put together a like-minded team 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:43.799
 progressive artists experiencing 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:46.159
 classics disney respect and love every 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.340
 of them bring their voice to the cartoon 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:50.040
 of course 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.009
 character same well too common 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.649
 direction but so interesting to observe 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:59.610
 how different directors add to 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.420
 picture some kind of its zest pretty 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.439
 long 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.340

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:07.619
 mood locations 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.229

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.120
 unlimited possibilities 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:14.180
 This is the most amazing when the group 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.310
 artists working on one project 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:20.550

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.500
 multiply as disney fans we can't 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.810
