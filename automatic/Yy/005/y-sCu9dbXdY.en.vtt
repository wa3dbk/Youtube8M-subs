00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
or Batman who has a butler but I guess

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.190 
or Batman who has a butler but I guess
it's<00:01:17.909> not<00:01:18.060> too<00:01:18.210> bad<00:01:18.390> because<00:01:18.689> for<00:01:18.990> every

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
it's not too bad because for every

it's not too bad because for every
strength<00:01:19.560> it<00:01:20.000> stop<00:01:21.000> making<00:01:21.330> noise<00:01:21.479> cat<00:01:23.540> you're

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
strength it stop making noise cat you're

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.280 
strength it stop making noise cat you're
making<00:01:24.840> noise<00:01:25.020> cat<00:01:26.689> but<00:01:27.689> I<00:01:27.720> guess<00:01:27.869> is<00:01:27.990> not<00:01:28.110> too

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
making noise cat but I guess is not too

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.929 
making noise cat but I guess is not too
bad<00:01:28.439> because<00:01:28.680> forever<00:01:29.070> power<00:01:29.310> that<00:01:29.520> he<00:01:29.610> has<00:01:29.759> he

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
bad because forever power that he has he

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.249 
bad because forever power that he has he
comes<00:01:30.119> with<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.299> new<00:01:30.420> weakness<00:01:30.810> like

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
comes with a new weakness like

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.330 
comes with a new weakness like
kryptonite<00:01:31.829> dork

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
kryptonite dork

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.870 
kryptonite dork
duh<00:01:33.530> kryptonite<00:01:34.530> yeah<00:01:35.460> that's<00:01:35.670> pretty<00:01:35.759> much

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
duh kryptonite yeah that's pretty much

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.670 
duh kryptonite yeah that's pretty much
it<00:01:36.000> from<00:01:36.960> Krypton<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:37.680> planet<00:01:38.460> that<00:01:38.610> blew<00:01:38.759> up

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
it from Krypton a planet that blew up

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.560 
it from Krypton a planet that blew up
cat<00:01:40.680> did<00:01:40.979> you<00:01:41.070> shut<00:01:41.430> up<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:41.850> I<00:01:42.119> guess<00:01:42.299> if<00:01:42.479> you

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
cat did you shut up and I guess if you

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.179 
cat did you shut up and I guess if you
want<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.780> get<00:01:42.869> technical<00:01:43.079> about<00:01:43.500> it<00:01:43.560> he<00:01:44.009> gets

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
want to get technical about it he gets

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.710 
want to get technical about it he gets
his<00:01:44.369> power<00:01:44.520> from<00:01:44.670> our<00:01:44.909> Yellow<00:01:45.119> Sun<00:01:45.390> so<00:01:45.570> if<00:01:45.630> he

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
his power from our Yellow Sun so if he

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.630 
his power from our Yellow Sun so if he
isn't<00:01:45.840> near<00:01:46.140> it<00:01:46.259> he<00:01:46.680> should<00:01:46.740> lose<00:01:47.040> his<00:01:47.250> powers

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
isn't near it he should lose his powers

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.120 
isn't near it he should lose his powers
so<00:01:48.149> basically<00:01:48.720> he<00:01:49.140> has<00:01:49.259> two<00:01:49.500> weaknesses<00:01:50.009> and

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
so basically he has two weaknesses and

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.190 
so basically he has two weaknesses and
neither<00:01:50.610> of<00:01:50.820> them<00:01:50.970> naturally<00:01:51.630> occur<00:01:51.930> in<00:01:51.960> our

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
neither of them naturally occur in our

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.499 
neither of them naturally occur in our
galaxy<00:01:52.470> cuz<00:01:53.250> nothing's<00:01:53.850> more<00:01:54.060> entertaining

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
galaxy cuz nothing's more entertaining

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:55.969 
galaxy cuz nothing's more entertaining
than<00:01:54.750> a<00:01:54.780> superhero<00:01:55.110> that<00:01:55.409> can't<00:01:55.590> possibly

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
than a superhero that can't possibly

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.999 
than a superhero that can't possibly
lose<00:01:56.520> oh<00:01:57.020> I<00:01:58.020> forgot<00:01:58.380> about<00:01:58.560> magic

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
lose oh I forgot about magic

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.030 
lose oh I forgot about magic
he's<00:01:59.340> also<00:01:59.520> vulnerable<00:01:59.790> to<00:02:00.060> magic<00:02:00.320> which<00:02:01.320> by

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
he's also vulnerable to magic which by

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.240 
he's also vulnerable to magic which by
definition<00:02:02.100> is<00:02:02.700> not<00:02:02.909> naturally<00:02:03.540> occurring<00:02:03.840> if

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
definition is not naturally occurring if

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.190 
definition is not naturally occurring if
it<00:02:05.250> were<00:02:05.369> it<00:02:05.670> would<00:02:05.790> be<00:02:05.820> called<00:02:06.030> science<00:02:06.479> or

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
it were it would be called science or

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.619 
it were it would be called science or
nature<00:02:07.680> okay<00:02:08.369> so<00:02:08.429> has<00:02:08.700> too<00:02:08.879> many<00:02:09.000> powers<00:02:09.420> and
