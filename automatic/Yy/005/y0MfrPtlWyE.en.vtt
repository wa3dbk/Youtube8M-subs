it's a touchscreen device so I'll start
with<00:00:06.960> thought<00:00:07.589> functionality<00:00:08.280> first<00:00:09.080> for<00:00:10.080> me

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200

with thought functionality first for me
the<00:00:10.500> most<00:00:10.620> important<00:00:11.160> thing<00:00:11.309> about<00:00:11.460> a<00:00:11.610> phone

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
the most important thing about a phone

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.330 
the most important thing about a phone
is<00:00:12.120> that<00:00:12.570> it<00:00:12.750> acts<00:00:12.990> like<00:00:13.170> a<00:00:13.320> phone<00:00:13.620> and<00:00:13.950> the

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
is that it acts like a phone and the

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.279 
is that it acts like a phone and the
problem<00:00:14.730> with<00:00:14.849> this<00:00:14.969> particular<00:00:15.210> one<00:00:15.839> was

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
problem with this particular one was

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.640 
problem with this particular one was
that<00:00:16.770> it<00:00:17.490> was<00:00:17.760> very<00:00:18.090> difficult<00:00:18.750> to<00:00:19.080> get<00:00:19.320> to<00:00:19.350> the

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
that it was very difficult to get to the

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.099 
that it was very difficult to get to the
actual<00:00:19.949> phone<00:00:20.279> part<00:00:20.670> I'm<00:00:21.000> very<00:00:21.810> used<00:00:22.020> to

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
actual phone part I'm very used to

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.929 
actual phone part I'm very used to
having<00:00:22.170> my<00:00:22.619> numbers<00:00:23.010> there<00:00:23.100> straight<00:00:23.730> away

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
having my numbers there straight away

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.089 
having my numbers there straight away
because<00:00:24.359> it's<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.320> phone<00:00:25.500> and<00:00:25.769> that's<00:00:25.920> what

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
because it's the phone and that's what

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.089 
because it's the phone and that's what
it<00:00:26.189> does<00:00:26.369> once<00:00:27.150> you<00:00:27.300> get<00:00:27.510> there<00:00:28.099> the

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
it does once you get there the

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.980 
it does once you get there the
touchscreen<00:00:29.429> itself<00:00:29.939> is<00:00:30.150> clunky<00:00:30.599> it's<00:00:30.779> not

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
touchscreen itself is clunky it's not

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.139 
touchscreen itself is clunky it's not
particularly<00:00:31.349> sensitive<00:00:31.769> it<00:00:32.579> takes<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:33.000> while

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
particularly sensitive it takes a while

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.700 
particularly sensitive it takes a while
to<00:00:33.210> dial<00:00:33.719> it<00:00:33.899> there<00:00:34.140> are<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.230> couple<00:00:34.350> of<00:00:34.500> cool

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
to dial it there are a couple of cool

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.080 
to dial it there are a couple of cool
things<00:00:34.739> like<00:00:35.100> when<00:00:35.340> you<00:00:35.399> start<00:00:35.670> dialing<00:00:36.030> a

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
things like when you start dialing a

things like when you start dialing a
number<00:00:36.120> that<00:00:36.510> you<00:00:36.660> frequently<00:00:37.110> dial<00:00:37.410> it<00:00:38.040> comes

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
number that you frequently dial it comes

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.010 
number that you frequently dial it comes
up<00:00:38.579> at<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.790> top<00:00:39.059> and<00:00:39.270> you<00:00:39.329> can<00:00:39.480> you<00:00:39.690> can<00:00:39.719> just

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
up at the top and you can you can just

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.490 
up at the top and you can you can just
click<00:00:40.200> on<00:00:40.320> it<00:00:40.500> there<00:00:41.340> was<00:00:41.460> one<00:00:42.079> problem<00:00:43.079> that<00:00:43.260> I

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
click on it there was one problem that I

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.430 
click on it there was one problem that I
had<00:00:43.739> when<00:00:44.129> I<00:00:44.300> use<00:00:45.300> phone<00:00:45.510> banking<00:00:45.930> quite<00:00:46.170> a<00:00:46.200> lot

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
had when I use phone banking quite a lot

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.529 
had when I use phone banking quite a lot
so<00:00:47.100> when<00:00:47.399> I<00:00:47.430> was<00:00:47.610> going<00:00:47.730> through<00:00:47.969> that<00:00:48.059> it

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
so when I was going through that it

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.299 
so when I was going through that it
would<00:00:48.750> actually<00:00:48.899> phone<00:00:49.530> would<00:00:49.680> lock<00:00:49.860> during

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
would actually phone would lock during

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.069 
would actually phone would lock during
the<00:00:50.399> call<00:00:50.579> so<00:00:50.820> I<00:00:50.850> would<00:00:51.000> have<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.239> unlock<00:00:51.600> it<00:00:51.840> go

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
the call so I would have to unlock it go

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.369 
the call so I would have to unlock it go
back<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.500> sometimes<00:00:53.399> that<00:00:53.850> would<00:00:54.149> result<00:00:55.020> in

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
back and sometimes that would result in

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.049 
back and sometimes that would result in
my<00:00:55.620> pressing<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.070> number<00:00:56.340> that<00:00:56.520> I<00:00:56.640> didn't<00:00:56.940> mean

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
my pressing a number that I didn't mean

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.819 
my pressing a number that I didn't mean
to<00:00:57.149> press<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.960> entire<00:00:58.199> phone<00:00:58.440> banking

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
to press and the entire phone banking

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.849 
to press and the entire phone banking
process<00:00:59.250> were<00:00:59.489> tough<00:01:00.120> so<00:01:00.840> there<00:01:01.559> were<00:01:01.680> things

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
process were tough so there were things

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.250 
process were tough so there were things
like<00:01:02.010> that<00:01:02.370> that<00:01:02.609> are<00:01:02.850> super<00:01:03.390> important<00:01:03.930> for

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
like that that are super important for

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.500 
like that that are super important for
me<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:05.309> other<00:01:05.430> problem<00:01:05.820> was<00:01:05.909> with<00:01:06.060> texting

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
me the other problem was with texting

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.480 
me the other problem was with texting
again<00:01:06.990> because<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.740> screen<00:01:08.010> wasn't

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
again because the screen wasn't

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.910 
again because the screen wasn't
particularly<00:01:08.939> sensitive<00:01:09.600> it<00:01:10.380> took<00:01:10.619> a<00:01:10.650> while

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
particularly sensitive it took a while

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.429 
particularly sensitive it took a while
someone<00:01:11.310> had<00:01:11.640> pulled<00:01:11.880> down<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.360> key<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:12.869> also

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
someone had pulled down the key and also

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.830 
someone had pulled down the key and also
because<00:01:13.920> we<00:01:14.130> were<00:01:14.280> you<00:01:14.790> know<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.180> letters

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
because we were you know the letters

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:16.700 
because we were you know the letters
were<00:01:16.049> grouped<00:01:16.290> together

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
were grouped together

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.590 
were grouped together
it<00:01:16.860> wasn't<00:01:17.189> like<00:01:17.310> buttons<00:01:17.820> it<00:01:18.090> had<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.390> wait

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
it wasn't like buttons it had to wait

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.270 
it wasn't like buttons it had to wait
until<00:01:19.290> it<00:01:19.380> went<00:01:19.560> on<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.860> next<00:01:20.100> letter

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
until it went on to the next letter

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.770 
until it went on to the next letter
which<00:01:20.549> meant<00:01:20.790> that<00:01:20.880> I<00:01:21.000> couldn't<00:01:21.240> text<00:01:21.570> pretty

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
which meant that I couldn't text pretty

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.570 
which meant that I couldn't text pretty
quickly<00:01:22.020> another<00:01:22.380> very<00:01:22.590> fast<00:01:22.830> texter<00:01:23.340> on

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
quickly another very fast texter on

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.609 
quickly another very fast texter on
normal<00:01:23.939> phones<00:01:24.150> so<00:01:24.750> that<00:01:24.780> was<00:01:25.080> that<00:01:25.470> was<00:01:25.590> a

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
normal phones so that was that was a

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.530 
normal phones so that was that was a
real<00:01:25.860> problem

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:28.540 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.200 

one<00:01:29.320> problem<00:01:29.680> for<00:01:29.920> me<00:01:30.040> was<00:01:30.250> definitely<00:01:30.850> the

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
one problem for me was definitely the

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.860 
one problem for me was definitely the
calendar<00:01:31.780> I<00:01:32.020> would<00:01:32.830> tend<00:01:33.340> to<00:01:33.520> have<00:01:33.840> three<00:01:34.840> or

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:34.870 
calendar I would tend to have three or

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:36.240 
calendar I would tend to have three or
four<00:01:35.020> different<00:01:35.380> things<00:01:35.710> that<00:01:35.890> I<00:01:35.950> really

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
four different things that I really

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:37.710 
four different things that I really
would<00:01:36.400> want<00:01:36.580> to<00:01:36.670> have<00:01:36.790> in<00:01:36.910> my<00:01:36.940> calendar<00:01:37.450> for<00:01:37.480> a

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.100 
would want to have in my calendar for a
day<00:01:37.930> and<00:01:38.370> I<00:01:39.370> really<00:01:40.000> do<00:01:40.150> rely<00:01:40.420> on<00:01:40.450> my<00:01:40.690> phone<00:01:40.900> to

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.080 
day and I really do rely on my phone to
organize<00:01:41.440> my<00:01:41.650> life<00:01:41.830> and<00:01:42.130> I<00:01:42.490> think<00:01:42.550> that<00:01:42.880> a<00:01:42.910> lot

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
organize my life and I think that a lot

I<00:04:20.410> would<00:04:20.590> give<00:04:20.769> this<00:04:20.890> a<00:04:20.950> four<00:04:21.190> out<00:04:21.220> of<00:04:21.340> ten
