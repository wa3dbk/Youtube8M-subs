subtracting<00:00:01.890> with<00:00:02.190> teens<00:00:02.610> I<00:00:03.350> can<00:00:04.350> decompose

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
subtracting with teens I can decompose

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.249 
subtracting with teens I can decompose
which<00:00:05.490> is<00:00:05.640> a<00:00:05.670> fancy<00:00:06.180> word<00:00:06.330> for<00:00:06.390> take<00:00:06.810> apart

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
which is a fancy word for take apart

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.259 
which is a fancy word for take apart
attend<00:00:08.069> to<00:00:08.429> subtract<00:00:10.130> if<00:00:11.130> I<00:00:11.370> subtract<00:00:11.940> the<00:00:12.090> red

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
attend to subtract if I subtract the red

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.599 
attend to subtract if I subtract the red
chips<00:00:12.599> how<00:00:12.929> many<00:00:13.110> are<00:00:13.320> left<00:00:13.500> with<00:00:14.219> ten<00:00:14.960> minus<00:00:15.960> e

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:16.609 
chips how many are left with ten minus e

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:22.460 
chips how many are left with ten minus e
equals<00:00:17.609> two<00:00:20.180> let's<00:00:21.180> subtract<00:00:21.750> eight<00:00:22.080> again

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
equals two let's subtract eight again

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:29.330 
equals two let's subtract eight again
this<00:00:23.100> time<00:00:23.430> we<00:00:23.580> have<00:00:23.730> 11<00:00:24.619> minus<00:00:25.619> 8<00:00:27.019> and<00:00:28.019> now<00:00:28.340> we

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
this time we have 11 minus 8 and now we

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.200 
this time we have 11 minus 8 and now we
have<00:00:29.460> three<00:00:31.489> another<00:00:32.489> way<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:32.820> think<00:00:33.059> about

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
have three another way to think about

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.600 
have three another way to think about
this<00:00:33.690> is<00:00:33.989> to<00:00:34.170> think<00:00:34.200> one<00:00:34.649> addition<00:00:35.130> sentence

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
this is to think one addition sentence

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.750 
this is to think one addition sentence
puts<00:00:35.940> those<00:00:36.120> three<00:00:36.540> yellow<00:00:36.840> objects<00:00:37.380> together

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
puts those three yellow objects together

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.830 
puts those three yellow objects together
so<00:00:38.760> if<00:00:38.850> I<00:00:38.940> take<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.780> eight<00:00:41.090> away<00:00:42.090> from<00:00:42.300> this<00:00:42.480> 10

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
so if I take the eight away from this 10

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.799 
so if I take the eight away from this 10
what<00:00:43.290> do<00:00:43.410> I<00:00:43.500> have<00:00:43.710> left<00:00:43.770> I<00:00:44.399> have<00:00:45.390> two<00:00:46.879> plus<00:00:47.879> one

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
what do I have left I have two plus one

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.040 
what do I have left I have two plus one
yellow<00:00:49.620> chip<00:00:49.920> left

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
yellow chip left

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.020 
yellow chip left
what<00:00:52.050> subtraction<00:00:52.739> sentence<00:00:53.219> is<00:00:53.370> modeled<00:00:53.820> now

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
what subtraction sentence is modeled now

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:01.130 
what subtraction sentence is modeled now
now<00:00:54.750> I<00:00:54.780> have<00:00:55.289> 12<00:00:56.420> minus<00:00:57.420> 8<00:00:58.039> I<00:00:59.359> have<00:01:00.359> four<00:01:00.809> yellow

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
now I have 12 minus 8 I have four yellow

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.270 
now I have 12 minus 8 I have four yellow
chips<00:01:01.559> left

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
chips left

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.969 
chips left
what<00:01:03.180> addition<00:01:03.690> sentence<00:01:04.170> put<00:01:04.500> those<00:01:04.680> yellow

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
what addition sentence put those yellow

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.100 
what addition sentence put those yellow
objects<00:01:05.640> together<00:01:06.110> well<00:01:07.110> when<00:01:07.350> I<00:01:07.380> had<00:01:07.740> 10<00:01:09.110> and

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
objects together well when I had 10 and

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.300 
objects together well when I had 10 and
I<00:01:10.200> took<00:01:10.530> my<00:01:10.799> 8<00:01:11.700> away<00:01:12.090> from<00:01:12.330> 10<00:01:12.720> I<00:01:13.140> had<00:01:13.650> two<00:01:13.950> left

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
I took my 8 away from 10 I had two left

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.760 
I took my 8 away from 10 I had two left
and<00:01:15.299> then<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:15.420> had<00:01:15.659> these<00:01:15.810> other<00:01:16.049> two<00:01:16.470> that<00:01:16.680> were

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
and then I had these other two that were

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.700 
and then I had these other two that were
left<00:01:17.009> over<00:01:17.220> on<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.850> side<00:01:18.170> so<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.290> addition

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
left over on the side so the addition

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.620 
left over on the side so the addition
sentence<00:01:20.159> that<00:01:20.340> put<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.640> yellow<00:01:20.970> objects

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
sentence that put the yellow objects

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:28.219 
sentence that put the yellow objects
together<00:01:21.780> is<00:01:22.409> 2<00:01:22.939> plus<00:01:23.939> 2<00:01:26.180> but<00:01:27.180> I<00:01:27.240> think<00:01:27.630> of<00:01:27.780> 12

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
together is 2 plus 2 but I think of 12

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.520 
together is 2 plus 2 but I think of 12
minus<00:01:28.770> 8<00:01:28.979> I<00:01:29.520> can<00:01:29.970> also<00:01:30.119> think<00:01:30.479> about<00:01:30.600> 2<00:01:30.930> plus<00:01:31.229> 2

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
minus 8 I can also think about 2 plus 2

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.249 
minus 8 I can also think about 2 plus 2
because<00:01:32.520> I<00:01:32.610> took<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.000> 8<00:01:33.180> away<00:01:33.509> from<00:01:33.780> my<00:01:33.900> 10

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
because I took the 8 away from my 10

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:42.289 
because I took the 8 away from my 10
leaving<00:01:35.130> me<00:01:35.250> 2<00:01:35.549> &amp;<00:01:36.299> 2<00:01:36.900> left<00:01:37.229> over<00:01:37.409> from<00:01:37.740> 12<00:01:41.299> 14

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
leaving me 2 &amp; 2 left over from 12 14

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.929 
leaving me 2 &amp; 2 left over from 12 14
minus<00:01:42.899> 3<00:01:43.259> do<00:01:43.710> I<00:01:43.799> have<00:01:44.009> enough<00:01:44.310> ones<00:01:44.640> to

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
minus 3 do I have enough ones to

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.499 
minus 3 do I have enough ones to
subtract<00:01:45.360> from<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.720> ones<00:01:45.979> yep<00:01:46.979> I<00:01:47.189> have<00:01:47.520> 4<00:01:47.880> 1<00:01:48.149> so

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
subtract from the ones yep I have 4 1 so

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.340 
subtract from the ones yep I have 4 1 so
I<00:01:48.570> can<00:01:48.600> take<00:01:48.930> my<00:01:49.170> 3<00:01:49.649> away<00:01:50.579> from<00:01:50.610> that<00:01:51.350> that's

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
I can take my 3 away from that that's

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.780 
I can take my 3 away from that that's
like<00:01:52.560> what<00:01:52.680> we<00:01:52.710> did<00:01:52.950> yesterday<00:01:54.890> now<00:01:55.890> I<00:01:55.920> have<00:01:56.280> 14

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
like what we did yesterday now I have 14

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.359 
like what we did yesterday now I have 14
minus<00:01:56.969> 8<00:01:57.450> do<00:01:58.079> I<00:01:58.140> have<00:01:58.380> enough<00:01:58.680> ones<00:01:59.009> to

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
minus 8 do I have enough ones to

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.999 
minus 8 do I have enough ones to
subtract<00:01:59.850> from<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.180> ones<00:02:00.590> no<00:02:01.590> I<00:02:01.619> only<00:02:01.920> have

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
subtract from the ones no I only have

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.480 
subtract from the ones no I only have
four<00:02:02.549> ones<00:02:03.380> so<00:02:04.380> what<00:02:04.590> will<00:02:04.710> I<00:02:04.799> need<00:02:05.009> to<00:02:05.159> do<00:02:05.280> now

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
four ones so what will I need to do now

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.920 
four ones so what will I need to do now
I'll<00:02:05.909> need<00:02:06.180> to<00:02:06.329> subtract<00:02:06.780> from<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.229> 10

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:09.930 

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:16.950 

so<00:02:10.930> with<00:02:11.520> 14-8<00:02:12.520> i<00:02:13.000> can<00:02:13.570> think<00:02:13.750> of<00:02:13.930> 14<00:02:14.670> as<00:02:15.960> ten

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:16.960 
so with 14-8 i can think of 14 as ten

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.360 
so with 14-8 i can think of 14 as ten
and<00:02:17.380> four<00:02:18.660> and<00:02:19.660> I<00:02:19.870> can<00:02:20.080> take<00:02:20.350> the<00:02:20.560> eight<00:02:20.830> away

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
and four and I can take the eight away

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.810 
and four and I can take the eight away
from<00:02:21.610> ten<00:02:21.880> so<00:02:22.450> I<00:02:22.510> have<00:02:22.690> eight<00:02:22.960> and<00:02:22.990> two<00:02:23.670> so<00:02:24.670> what

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
from ten so I have eight and two so what

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.230 
from ten so I have eight and two so what
do<00:02:24.880> I<00:02:24.940> have<00:02:25.030> left<00:02:25.380> two<00:02:26.380> and<00:02:26.740> four<00:02:27.040> let's<00:02:28.000> look

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
do I have left two and four let's look

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.480 
do I have left two and four let's look
at<00:02:28.360> that<00:02:28.600> I<00:02:28.780> take<00:02:29.410> eight<00:02:29.770> away<00:02:30.510> from<00:02:31.510> the<00:02:31.690> ten<00:02:31.990> I

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
at that I take eight away from the ten I

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:39.450 
at that I take eight away from the ten I
have<00:02:33.490> two<00:02:33.880> and<00:02:34.410> four<00:02:35.410> left<00:02:37.500> with<00:02:38.500> 13<00:02:39.100> minus

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:39.460 
have two and four left with 13 minus

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.930 
have two and four left with 13 minus
eight

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
eight

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.650 
eight
I<00:02:39.970> also<00:02:40.270> need<00:02:40.630> to<00:02:40.660> subtract<00:02:41.200> from<00:02:41.380> the<00:02:41.530> tens

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
I also need to subtract from the tens

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.020 
I also need to subtract from the tens
because<00:02:43.660> I<00:02:43.690> can't<00:02:44.050> take<00:02:44.350> eight<00:02:44.790> away<00:02:45.790> from

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
because I can't take eight away from

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.720 
because I can't take eight away from
these<00:02:46.210> three<00:02:46.570> ones<00:02:47.310> so<00:02:48.310> I'm<00:02:48.370> going<00:02:48.520> to<00:02:48.580> come

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
these three ones so I'm going to come

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.700 
these three ones so I'm going to come
over<00:02:48.820> to<00:02:48.970> my<00:02:49.180> tents<00:02:49.510> and<00:02:49.930> take<00:02:50.110> away<00:02:50.290> eight

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:50.710 
over to my tents and take away eight

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:54.690 
over to my tents and take away eight
there's<00:02:51.370> five<00:02:51.760> and<00:02:52.480> three<00:02:52.900> more<00:02:53.550> and<00:02:54.550> that

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
there's five and three more and that

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.180 
there's five and three more and that
leaves<00:02:54.910> me<00:02:55.090> with<00:02:55.330> two<00:02:55.660> and<00:02:56.020> three<00:02:56.440> let's<00:02:56.710> look

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
leaves me with two and three let's look

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.460 
leaves me with two and three let's look
at<00:02:57.310> that<00:02:57.490> with<00:02:57.610> number<00:02:57.940> bonds<00:02:59.940> 13-8<00:03:00.970> I<00:03:01.470> can

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
at that with number bonds 13-8 I can

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.810 
at that with number bonds 13-8 I can
break<00:03:02.680> thirteen<00:03:03.310> into<00:03:03.820> ten<00:03:04.150> and<00:03:04.810> three<00:03:05.700> and<00:03:06.700> I

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
break thirteen into ten and three and I

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.780 
break thirteen into ten and three and I
can<00:03:06.850> take<00:03:07.030> my<00:03:07.390> eight<00:03:07.660> away<00:03:08.140> from<00:03:08.380> the<00:03:08.500> ten

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
can take my eight away from the ten

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.630 
can take my eight away from the ten
which<00:03:09.790> leaves<00:03:10.120> me<00:03:10.360> two<00:03:10.630> and<00:03:11.500> three<00:03:11.890> there<00:03:12.430> they

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
which leaves me two and three there they

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.170 
which leaves me two and three there they
are<00:03:12.850> two<00:03:13.510> and<00:03:13.540> three<00:03:14.370> that's<00:03:15.370> the<00:03:15.550> same<00:03:15.820> two

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
are two and three that's the same two

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.580 
are two and three that's the same two
and<00:03:16.390> three<00:03:16.600> that<00:03:16.840> I<00:03:16.870> have<00:03:17.170> here<00:03:17.410> in<00:03:17.470> this

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
and three that I have here in this

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.750 
and three that I have here in this
picture<00:03:19.739> here<00:03:20.739> are<00:03:20.830> some<00:03:21.010> more<00:03:21.130> problems<00:03:21.430> that

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
picture here are some more problems that

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.930 
picture here are some more problems that
we<00:03:22.060> can<00:03:22.239> use<00:03:22.390> our<00:03:22.510> basic<00:03:22.660> facts<00:03:23.350> to<00:03:23.470> help<00:03:23.650> us

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
we can use our basic facts to help us

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.290 
we can use our basic facts to help us
for<00:03:24.989> 11-2<00:03:25.989> do<00:03:26.500> I<00:03:26.530> subtract<00:03:27.070> from<00:03:27.280> the<00:03:27.400> tens<00:03:27.730> or

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:28.300 
for 11-2 do I subtract from the tens or

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.390 
for 11-2 do I subtract from the tens or
the<00:03:28.420> ones<00:03:28.739> well<00:03:29.739> let's<00:03:29.860> look<00:03:29.980> at<00:03:30.130> the<00:03:30.190> ones

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
the ones well let's look at the ones

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.430 
the ones well let's look at the ones
there's<00:03:30.850> only<00:03:31.000> one<00:03:31.360> one<00:03:31.660> so<00:03:32.050> I<00:03:32.080> need<00:03:32.290> to

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
there's only one one so I need to

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.550 
there's only one one so I need to
subtract<00:03:32.830> from<00:03:33.010> the<00:03:33.160> tens<00:03:33.540> so<00:03:34.540> I<00:03:34.570> can<00:03:34.840> break<00:03:35.020> 11

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
subtract from the tens so I can break 11

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.840 
subtract from the tens so I can break 11
into<00:03:35.860> 10<00:03:35.890> and<00:03:36.520> one<00:03:37.860> and<00:03:38.860> I<00:03:39.040> can<00:03:39.250> take<00:03:39.430> the<00:03:39.580> two

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
into 10 and one and I can take the two

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.040 
into 10 and one and I can take the two
away<00:03:40.209> from<00:03:40.480> 10<00:03:40.810> which<00:03:41.680> leaves<00:03:42.010> me<00:03:42.220> with<00:03:42.250> eight

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
away from 10 which leaves me with eight

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:50.360 
away from 10 which leaves me with eight
so<00:03:44.050> my<00:03:44.200> answer<00:03:44.830> would<00:03:45.430> be<00:03:45.489> 8<00:03:45.850> and<00:03:46.150> 1<00:03:46.480> which<00:03:47.170> is<00:03:47.380> 9

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:55.890 

for<00:03:51.370> this<00:03:51.550> problem<00:03:52.120> I<00:03:52.330> have<00:03:52.750> 15<00:03:53.530> minus<00:03:54.520> 2<00:03:54.900> this

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
for this problem I have 15 minus 2 this

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.750 
for this problem I have 15 minus 2 this
time<00:03:56.230> I<00:03:56.290> can<00:03:56.650> take<00:03:56.860> away<00:03:57.190> from<00:03:57.220> the<00:03:57.550> ones

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
time I can take away from the ones

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.720 
time I can take away from the ones
because<00:03:58.330> there's<00:03:58.540> five<00:03:58.810> of<00:03:58.840> them<00:03:59.370> so<00:04:00.370> I<00:04:00.400> can

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
because there's five of them so I can

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:07.350 
because there's five of them so I can
think<00:04:00.970> of<00:04:01.120> 15<00:04:02.850> as<00:04:03.850> 10<00:04:04.420> and<00:04:04.810> five<00:04:06.090> and<00:04:07.090> I<00:04:07.180> can

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 
think of 15 as 10 and five and I can

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.970 
think of 15 as 10 and five and I can
take<00:04:07.540> that<00:04:07.570> two<00:04:09.209> away<00:04:10.209> from<00:04:10.480> the<00:04:10.600> five<00:04:10.980> leaving

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980 
take that two away from the five leaving

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.990 
take that two away from the five leaving
me<00:04:12.130> three<00:04:12.720> so<00:04:13.720> 15<00:04:14.260> minus<00:04:14.470> 2<00:04:14.980> is<00:04:15.250> the<00:04:15.280> same<00:04:15.400> as<00:04:15.610> 10

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
me three so 15 minus 2 is the same as 10

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.580 
me three so 15 minus 2 is the same as 10
plus<00:04:16.239> 3<00:04:16.660> or<00:04:17.350> 13

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
plus 3 or 13

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.520 
plus 3 or 13
with<00:04:20.590> this<00:04:20.799> problem<00:04:21.930> 15-7<00:04:22.930> I<00:04:23.080> don't<00:04:23.319> have

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
with this problem 15-7 I don't have

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.850 
with this problem 15-7 I don't have
enough<00:04:23.800> ones<00:04:24.270> so<00:04:25.270> I'm<00:04:25.389> gonna<00:04:25.539> take<00:04:25.810> 15<00:04:26.050> and

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
enough ones so I'm gonna take 15 and

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.869 
enough ones so I'm gonna take 15 and
decompose<00:04:27.490> it<00:04:27.729> into<00:04:27.909> ten<00:04:28.360> and<00:04:28.990> five<00:04:29.889> and<00:04:30.759> I'm

00:04:30.869 --> 00:04:30.879 
decompose it into ten and five and I'm

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:33.920 
decompose it into ten and five and I'm
going<00:04:31.090> to<00:04:31.120> take<00:04:31.270> that<00:04:31.479> seven<00:04:32.080> away<00:04:32.680> from<00:04:32.949> ten

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
going to take that seven away from ten

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.619 
going to take that seven away from ten
seven<00:04:34.930> and<00:04:35.080> three<00:04:35.439> make<00:04:35.680> ten<00:04:36.210> and<00:04:37.210> I'm<00:04:37.330> left

00:04:37.619 --> 00:04:37.629 
seven and three make ten and I'm left

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:43.980 
seven and three make ten and I'm left
with<00:04:37.870> five<00:04:38.110> plus<00:04:38.530> three<00:04:38.580> which<00:04:39.580> is<00:04:39.610> e<00:04:42.360> with<00:04:43.360> 16

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
with five plus three which is e with 16

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.909 
with five plus three which is e with 16
minus<00:04:44.409> four<00:04:44.740> I<00:04:45.159> have<00:04:45.580> enough<00:04:45.849> ones<00:04:46.180> this<00:04:46.479> time

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:46.919 
minus four I have enough ones this time

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:49.830 
minus four I have enough ones this time
so<00:04:47.919> I<00:04:47.979> have<00:04:48.099> six<00:04:48.400> ones<00:04:48.699> I<00:04:49.000> need<00:04:49.060> to<00:04:49.330> take<00:04:49.509> far

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
so I have six ones I need to take far

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.980 
so I have six ones I need to take far
away<00:04:50.159> so<00:04:51.159> I<00:04:51.189> can<00:04:51.460> break<00:04:51.639> 16<00:04:52.300> into<00:04:52.810> 10<00:04:52.840> and<00:04:53.699> six

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
away so I can break 16 into 10 and six

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:59.070 
away so I can break 16 into 10 and six
then<00:04:55.990> I<00:04:56.110> can<00:04:56.289> break<00:04:56.529> 6<00:04:56.979> into<00:04:57.639> 4<00:04:58.000> and<00:04:58.719> what<00:04:58.900> would

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
then I can break 6 into 4 and what would

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.670 
then I can break 6 into 4 and what would
be<00:04:59.199> left<00:04:59.409> to<00:05:00.090> so<00:05:01.090> I<00:05:01.150> can<00:05:01.360> think<00:05:01.509> of<00:05:01.689> 10<00:05:01.960> plus<00:05:02.289> 2

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 
be left to so I can think of 10 plus 2

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.709 
be left to so I can think of 10 plus 2

facts<00:05:14.139> we<00:05:14.409> can<00:05:14.439> use<00:05:14.740> to<00:05:14.949> subtract<00:05:15.840> so<00:05:16.840> for<00:05:17.259> 11

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 
facts we can use to subtract so for 11

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:22.709 
facts we can use to subtract so for 11
minus<00:05:18.159> 8<00:05:18.400> I<00:05:19.000> can<00:05:19.719> think<00:05:20.199> about<00:05:21.360> taking<00:05:22.360> the<00:05:22.449> 8

00:05:22.709 --> 00:05:22.719 
minus 8 I can think about taking the 8

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:28.439 
minus 8 I can think about taking the 8
away<00:05:23.199> from<00:05:23.500> 10<00:05:24.870> 11<00:05:25.870> is<00:05:25.960> 10<00:05:26.319> and<00:05:26.560> 1<00:05:27.150> when<00:05:28.150> I<00:05:28.180> take

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:28.449 
away from 10 11 is 10 and 1 when I take

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:33.570 
away from 10 11 is 10 and 1 when I take
the<00:05:28.599> 8<00:05:28.839> away<00:05:29.229> from<00:05:29.469> 10<00:05:29.800> I<00:05:30.190> have<00:05:30.759> two<00:05:31.210> left<00:05:31.870> so<00:05:32.580> 11

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580 
the 8 away from 10 I have two left so 11

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:39.510 
the 8 away from 10 I have two left so 11
minus<00:05:33.610> 8<00:05:34.089> is<00:05:34.330> the<00:05:34.360> same<00:05:34.839> as<00:05:35.259> 2<00:05:35.740> plus<00:05:36.219> 1<00:05:37.979> 4<00:05:38.979> 16

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 
minus 8 is the same as 2 plus 1 4 16

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.959 
minus 8 is the same as 2 plus 1 4 16
minus<00:05:39.909> 9<00:05:39.940> I<00:05:40.690> can't<00:05:41.139> take<00:05:41.379> 9<00:05:41.680> away<00:05:41.710> from<00:05:42.279> the<00:05:42.400> 6<00:05:42.729> 1

00:05:42.959 --> 00:05:42.969 
minus 9 I can't take 9 away from the 6 1

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:46.439 
minus 9 I can't take 9 away from the 6 1
so<00:05:43.360> I'm<00:05:43.449> gonna<00:05:43.599> break<00:05:43.900> it<00:05:44.050> into<00:05:44.199> 10<00:05:44.650> and<00:05:45.270> 6

00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:46.449 
so I'm gonna break it into 10 and 6

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:50.339 
so I'm gonna break it into 10 and 6
I'll<00:05:47.169> take<00:05:47.439> my<00:05:47.650> 9<00:05:47.949> away<00:05:48.430> from<00:05:48.699> 10<00:05:49.020> which<00:05:50.020> leaves

00:05:50.339 --> 00:05:50.349 
I'll take my 9 away from 10 which leaves

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:54.149 
I'll take my 9 away from 10 which leaves
me<00:05:50.529> with<00:05:50.680> 1<00:05:50.919> left<00:05:51.479> and<00:05:52.479> 16<00:05:53.080> minus<00:05:53.529> 9<00:05:53.560> is<00:05:54.129> the

00:05:54.149 --> 00:05:54.159 
me with 1 left and 16 minus 9 is the

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:58.320 
me with 1 left and 16 minus 9 is the
same<00:05:54.279> as<00:05:54.669> 1<00:05:54.969> plus<00:05:55.719> 6<00:05:56.080> I<00:05:56.469> can<00:05:57.069> use<00:05:57.370> my<00:05:57.580> basic<00:05:57.789> fact

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:58.330 
same as 1 plus 6 I can use my basic fact

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.990 
same as 1 plus 6 I can use my basic fact
style<00:05:58.689> we<00:05:58.900> think<00:05:59.199> about<00:05:59.339> subtracting<00:06:00.339> with

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.000 
style we think about subtracting with

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.479 
style we think about subtracting with
the<00:06:01.180> teens
