 the human 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.590
 by virtue of its large dimensions 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:11.730
 the project anticipated from the beginning 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.039
 that the tunnels of the pines station would be excavated by the method 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:18.189
 amy arthur m 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:22.310
 this method widely used in the whole world and in the construction of the subway 

00:00:22.309 --> 00:00:27.009
 SÃ£o Paulo allows the tunneling of your 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:29.539
 adjusting during the excavation itself 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:32.689
 according to the characteristics of the massif found 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.910
 because it is a process that allows permanent adjustments during the excavation. 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.820
 amy atm method 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.030
 is that pain from the observations 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.030
 mapping and field instrumentation 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.970
 an instrumentation program includes a set of instruments that measure 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.970
 the displacements of the terrain surface 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.680
 the displacements of surrounding buildings 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.500
 the level and pressure of groundwater 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.990
 the movements of the mass between the tunnel and the surface 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.110
 and the movement of the tunnel mainly convergence and repression 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.530
 this practice allows monitoring the behavior of the tunnel 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.530
 and neighboring structures during excavation 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.640
 in an excavation so controlled 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.470
 instrumentation shows that there was a downswing as 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.420
 front of excavation is approaching 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.780
 and then usually shows a stabilizing trend when the 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.950
 in front of the instrument 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.960
 according to the project the sequence of excavations would be as follows 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.469
 first 

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:50.060
 the capri pit 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.719
 then the station tunnels would be scaled from the well 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.580
 and in parallel would also be excavated the correction tunnels of the station 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.580
 with the line of urban trains 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.570
 the station tunnels would be excavated in three stages 

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:11.719
 carlota which is the upper part 

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:15.829
 first the recess or workbench 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.389
 and second recessed or inverted arch 

00:02:20.389 --> 00:02:23.489
 the tunnel floor 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:27.930
 in all of these stages of excavation the direction predicted in the project 

00:02:28.669 --> 00:02:31.669
 capri well for the season would do file 

00:02:33.149 --> 00:02:37.009
 each step has its own temporary structural support system 

00:02:37.669 --> 00:02:42.669
 in the case of the calotte this system is formed by pine row twins injected 

00:02:42.669 --> 00:02:44.959
 and crankshaft 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:48.970
 which are metallic structures that together with the projected concrete 

00:02:50.279 --> 00:02:53.279
 a protection frame for excavation 

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:59.709
 the project foresees the first and second recesses to excavate first the 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:00.569
 center 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:01.569
 and then 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:05.009
 alternately the left and right sides 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:10.169
 a ramp would be constructed to allow access to the station tunnel 

00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:12.889
 to the road tunnel 

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:17.279
 after completion of the excavation of the second demolition, the project 

00:03:17.279 --> 00:03:21.099
 application of the waterproofing system after the 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:23.519
 execution of final structural concrete '
