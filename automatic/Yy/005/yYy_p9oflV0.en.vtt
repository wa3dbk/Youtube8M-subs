straightaway and I thought about doing

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.470 
straightaway and I thought about doing
something<00:00:11.250> else<00:00:11.550> be<00:00:11.759> a<00:00:11.790> bit<00:00:11.910> more<00:00:12.059> original

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
something else be a bit more original

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
way you want but I chose to use red

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.590

white<00:01:36.160> dark<00:01:36.640> green<00:01:36.970> in<00:01:37.150> the<00:01:37.240> green<00:01:37.420> that's

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
white dark green in the green that's

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.020 
white dark green in the green that's
already<00:01:37.780> on<00:01:37.870> the<00:01:37.960> nail<00:01:38.310> because<00:01:39.310> the<00:01:39.760> green

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
already on the nail because the green

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:41.730 
already on the nail because the green
underneath<00:01:40.510> is<00:01:40.810> darker<00:01:41.140> than<00:01:41.170> the<00:01:41.260> red<00:01:41.530> I

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
underneath is darker than the red I

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.410 
underneath is darker than the red I
actually<00:01:41.890> made<00:01:42.250> a<00:01:42.280> black<00:01:42.520> stripe<00:01:42.940> and<00:01:43.120> applied

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
actually made a black stripe and applied

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:44.910 
actually made a black stripe and applied
the<00:01:43.600> red<00:01:43.780> over<00:01:44.050> top<00:01:44.260> of<00:01:44.320> the<00:01:44.410> white<00:01:44.590> stripe

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
the red over top of the white stripe

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.480 
the red over top of the white stripe
sort<00:01:45.640> of<00:01:45.700> stand<00:01:45.910> out<00:01:46.060> more

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.399 

then<00:01:51.360> add<00:01:51.540> in<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.689> dark<00:01:51.930> green<00:01:52.140> where<00:01:52.350> you

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
then add in the dark green where you

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.590 
then add in the dark green where you
think<00:01:52.590> it'll<00:01:52.710> look<00:01:52.860> nice<00:01:53.100> I<00:01:56.509> decided<00:01:57.509> to

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
think it'll look nice I decided to

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.450 
think it'll look nice I decided to
emphasize<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:58.229> black<00:01:58.439> more<00:01:58.680> on<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.890> snail<00:01:59.130> by

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
emphasize the black more on the snail by

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.130 
emphasize the black more on the snail by
going<00:01:59.759> over<00:01:59.970> the<00:02:00.060> white<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:00.570> adding<00:02:00.960> another

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
going over the white and adding another

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.020 
going over the white and adding another
stripe<00:02:01.470> you<00:02:02.189> might<00:02:02.369> not<00:02:02.520> need<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:02.729> do<00:02:02.850> this

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
stripe you might not need to do this

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.520 
stripe you might not need to do this
