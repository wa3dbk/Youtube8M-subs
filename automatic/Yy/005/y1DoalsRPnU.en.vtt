00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
you I'm so I think that's a pretty cool

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.280 
you I'm so I think that's a pretty cool
idea<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.640> yet<00:01:42.420> she's<00:01:42.689> for<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.869> front<00:01:43.049> and<00:01:43.170> the

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
idea and yet she's for the front and the

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.980 
idea and yet she's for the front and the
back<00:01:43.380> so<00:01:43.770> you<00:01:43.829> can't<00:01:44.130> do<00:01:44.369> dual<00:01:44.729> video<00:01:44.880> but<00:01:45.810> you

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
back so you can't do dual video but you

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.749 
back so you can't do dual video but you
can<00:01:46.020> get<00:01:46.320> some<00:01:46.530> good<00:01:46.710> front<00:01:47.159> facing<00:01:47.490> cameras

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
can get some good front facing cameras

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.490 
can get some good front facing cameras
as<00:01:47.850> well<00:01:47.880> as<00:01:48.060> back<00:01:48.210> facing<00:01:48.600> camera<00:01:48.899> now<00:01:49.380> who's

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
as well as back facing camera now who's

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.870 
as well as back facing camera now who's
the<00:01:49.649> soil<00:01:49.950> lens<00:01:50.189> which<00:01:50.340> is<00:01:50.460> again<00:01:50.850> a
