that<00:01:10.310> of<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.460> whole<00:01:11.640> box<00:01:11.850> pan<00:01:12.750> over<00:01:12.990> there<00:01:13.170> and

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
that of the whole box pan over there and

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.450 
that of the whole box pan over there and
see<00:01:13.729> what<00:01:14.729> came<00:01:14.939> out<00:01:15.290> it's<00:01:16.290> almost<00:01:16.470> Oh<00:01:16.830> Bruce

the ones you did get but they're purple

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:33.020 
the ones you did get but they're purple
is<00:01:30.119> even<00:01:30.600> less<00:01:30.810> we<00:01:31.280> soon<00:01:32.280> as<00:01:32.400> I<00:01:32.520> started<00:01:32.850> with

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
is even less we soon as I started with

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.030 
is even less we soon as I started with
your<00:01:33.930> supposed<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.259> get<00:01:34.380> ten<00:01:34.560> times<00:01:34.829> the

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
your supposed to get ten times the

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.230 
your supposed to get ten times the
amount

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
amount

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.450 
amount
so<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:36.900> started<00:01:37.229> with<00:01:37.380> how<00:01:37.530> many<00:01:37.590> three

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
so you started with how many three

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.660 
so you started with how many three
pounds<00:01:38.790> of<00:01:38.880> seed<00:01:39.030> potatoes<00:01:40.430> we<00:01:41.430> can<00:01:41.549> go

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
pounds of seed potatoes we can go

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.020 
pounds of seed potatoes we can go
through<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:42.030> do<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.270> math<00:01:42.860> this<00:01:43.860> time<00:01:44.130> for

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
through and do the math this time for

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.870 
through and do the math this time for
the<00:01:45.119> money<00:01:45.330> say<00:01:46.320> roughly<00:01:47.130> spent<00:01:47.430> twenty<00:01:47.700> bucks

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
the money say roughly spent twenty bucks

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.570 
the money say roughly spent twenty bucks
on<00:01:48.149> seed<00:01:49.110> potatoes<00:01:49.939> 30<00:01:50.939> on<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.210> box<00:01:51.509> a<00:01:52.580> hundred

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580 
on seed potatoes 30 on the box a hundred

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.149 
on seed potatoes 30 on the box a hundred
on<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.759> soil<00:01:54.000> yes<00:01:54.720> but<00:01:55.289> you'll<00:01:55.439> be<00:01:55.530> reusing

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
on the soil yes but you'll be reusing

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.340 
on the soil yes but you'll be reusing
all<00:01:56.310> of<00:01:56.460> this<00:01:56.670> I'll<00:01:56.970> reuse<00:01:57.330> it<00:01:57.509> somehow<00:01:57.750> we<00:01:58.170> use

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
all of this I'll reuse it somehow we use

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:05.600 
all of this I'll reuse it somehow we use
the<00:01:58.470> soil<00:01:58.740> potting<00:01:59.549> mix<00:02:01.759> well<00:02:04.310> obviously<00:02:05.310> I

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
the soil potting mix well obviously I

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.880 
the soil potting mix well obviously I
didn't<00:02:05.850> do<00:02:05.939> something<00:02:06.179> right<00:02:06.479> but<00:02:06.899> it's<00:02:07.830> an

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
didn't do something right but it's an

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.100 
didn't do something right but it's an
experiment<00:02:08.479> one<00:02:09.479> that<00:02:09.660> didn't<00:02:09.899> really<00:02:09.989> work

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
experiment one that didn't really work

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.340 
experiment one that didn't really work
