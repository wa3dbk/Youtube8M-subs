00:00:08.999 --> 00:00:14.849
 The corn crisis in Mexico is a result of the federal governments 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.849
 from 1982 to date 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:19.820
 decided 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.820
 bet on corn imports 

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:28.490
 from the United States will meet the demand for this basic grain for the 

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:30.180
 feeding the Mexicans 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.550
 after buying cheaper corn 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.550
 united states on the subject said rangel 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:39.960
 children of the world 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.840
 2 that passes our field of what we are going to live together in the case of the many 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.609
 the state is that the world is what moves the entire region 

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:56.890
 all goals by bojan with pedro sevcec 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.190
 when there is no harvest who buys there seems to be nobody 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:02.230
 the only pointer 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.610
 with which we have this field 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.270
 we do not have more 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.450
 how I think it's my age 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.940
 where we can work the imports are not having as 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.310
 effect what was preached to in that act the free trade pope 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.830
 that we were going to have cheap food today we have very expensive food 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.770
 but at the same time we have time 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.950
 rural unemployment loss of profitability to producers and a 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.750
 abandonment of the plots 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.440
 About our products 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.090
 but the reasons are not explained 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.640
 the investment 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.750
 if 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.750
 We keep waiting, it's not like that 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.850
 I no longer is not worth 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:45.950
 because the time 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.070
 urtasÃºn who sell roots 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.850
 besides leading all ferriz who 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.030
 this 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.910
 the lieutenant general 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:58.850
 the very sad that is not the reverse of how we need competition action 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.230
 the merval has a horse and ngo 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:05.350
 for the the Mexican government has not supported 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.520
 the agriculture of the grains specifically the network 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:11.569
 trias has how many do not zapopan 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:16.340
 subsidy percent the 3 points 5 percent when Americans 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.579
 they give 28% 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:20.109
 we meet 

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:23.289
 actor and notorious in uncertainty 

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:25.510
 because on day 9 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:26.889
 we have come with 

00:02:26.889 --> 00:02:28.639
 with the new model 

00:02:28.639 --> 00:02:29.809
 country 

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:31.419
 that supports its producers 

00:02:31.419 --> 00:02:34.469
 strongly 

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:35.859
 now 

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:36.829
 please 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:37.830
 beautifully 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.629
 a tremendous advantage 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:43.119
 from near possible state 

00:02:43.119 --> 00:02:45.569
 this option by the government 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:48.749
 despite that her box office to work the field 

00:02:48.749 --> 00:02:50.359
 return 

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:53.219
 I another works otherwise 

00:02:53.219 --> 00:02:57.439
 everyone demands on the other hand because green 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:02:59.929
 when we were also told 

00:02:59.929 --> 00:03:02.929
 the free trade agreement 

00:03:02.929 --> 00:03:05.769
 Its purpose was to stop the migration 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:07.969
 so he sold them to salinas 

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:10.969
 and so it was announced 

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:16.779
 today we have 80% that is already 

00:03:16.779 --> 00:03:17.999
 but united states 

00:03:17.999 --> 00:03:20.679
 so it was 

00:03:20.679 --> 00:03:22.429
 because many neighbors 

00:03:22.429 --> 00:03:24.849
 nothing more here nothing good 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:28.719
 with which almost nothing remained pending and says that the music is very old 

00:03:28.719 --> 00:03:30.709
 as underlines 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:32.019
 the people who 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:37.059
 this dictator is also not older than 50 people because we were 

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:38.839
 Young people or Spain 

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:41.839
 they are not interested in their own phenomena 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:48.349
 that is the future that as a country we are giving to 30 million Mexicans 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.919
 that year forced to grandmothers that the Galicians 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:57.980
 who are being deported because the license plate was once 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:58.840
 lazio 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.569
 I do not know what I'm going on because of the conflict 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:04.909
 well as we go and if you do not apply the resource without light 

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:13.299
 fernando sit down half 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:16.299
 each one like 

00:04:18.559 --> 00:04:21.180
 thirteen of the sixteen thousand pesos 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.220
 if we have three pesos of profit per year my little one coming from the 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.169
 playgrounds against the family 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:30.179
 has a thousand hectares are giving more than one million pesos of procampo 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.050
 when that 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:33.779
 receipt 2000 

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:37.270
 four sets 3% procampo 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:38.800
 what is the difference 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.800
 and there is in the trap it is evident that they call us at the waist 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.460
 the figures millionaire losses 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.990
 for that reason the experts who take 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.669
 Ford sold 2 to 0 in favor of the copay the new attack 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:54.669
 I do not have another one 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:55.930
 like little 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:57.710
 make me a web 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:59.560
 Of course I'm like them 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:04.169
 in these 13 years they have become world-class companies like maseca 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:07.349
 as bimbo as bachoco 

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:10.259
 night comes day 

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:11.879
 I have to think 

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:14.180
 without fear of being wrong that 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.710
 a person without if they gave us 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:19.710
 40 pesos 50 pesos since I would be happy 

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:23.969
 20 that in front of them from the east 

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:26.900
 after a week a month to move 2005 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.719
 the state can no longer follow 

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:32.719
 being an accomplice 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:38.850
 agent of the minority interests and of the large companies that dominate and 

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:40.499
 monopolize the sector 

00:05:40.499 --> 00:05:43.499
 per food sack 

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:55.849
 one hundred billion that could be 

00:05:55.849 --> 00:06:01.309
 a lever of regional development of rural development national development 

00:06:01.309 --> 00:06:03.189
 we are taking them year by year 

00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:04.860
 what will happen to the first of January 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:07.089
 that producers will not know 

00:06:07.089 --> 00:06:10.520
 whether or not they can sell their crops and at what price 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.129
 Consumers will not know 

00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:16.069
 if you can for having ohno tortillas 

00:06:16.069 --> 00:06:19.289
 bread 1 and other products and at what price 

00:06:27.689 --> 00:06:29.349
 that's why we have security 

00:06:29.349 --> 00:06:32.400
 beckeles we were going today we are going to do 

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.400
 acts you feel to sustain a month 

00:06:39.089 --> 00:06:41.019
 we already saw that the government does not understand us
