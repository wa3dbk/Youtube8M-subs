the fight that I was most interested in

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.730 
the fight that I was most interested in
because<00:00:55.880> I<00:00:55.970> didn't<00:00:56.420> know<00:00:56.540> exactly<00:00:57.140> where<00:00:57.590> was

00:00:59.350 --> 00:00:59.360 
going to go both of these guys have a

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.420 
going to go both of these guys have a
lot<00:00:59.720> know<00:00:59.990> and<00:01:00.320> they're<00:01:00.620> each<00:01:00.950> and<00:01:01.220> their

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
lot know and they're each and their

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.460 
lot know and they're each and their
skill<00:01:01.820> set<00:01:02.150> that<00:01:02.180> they're<00:01:02.480> good<00:01:02.690> at<00:01:02.900> but<00:01:03.200> it

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
skill set that they're good at but it

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.170 
skill set that they're good at but it
was<00:01:03.620> a<00:01:03.650> great<00:01:04.009> fight<00:01:04.280> i<00:01:04.309> think<00:01:04.640> that<00:01:04.820> fight<00:01:05.030> of

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
the night if Johnny Hendricks who pretty

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.819 
the night if Johnny Hendricks who pretty
much<00:01:07.280> for<00:01:07.670> in<00:01:07.790> this<00:01:08.000> fight<00:01:08.270> used<00:01:08.780> went<00:01:09.470> back<00:01:09.680> to

the face of his wrestling look looks
like<00:01:11.899> he<00:01:12.020> hurt<00:01:12.229> his<00:01:12.380> hand<00:01:12.590> or<00:01:12.920> something<00:01:12.950> like

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:47.140 
tried to get back to his feet and most
of<00:01:45.560> the<00:01:45.619> time<00:01:45.830> did<00:01:46.190> get<00:01:46.430> back<00:01:46.580> on<00:01:46.790> the<00:01:46.909> scheme

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:47.150 
of the time did get back on the scheme

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:48.940 
of the time did get back on the scheme
so<00:01:47.450> Johnny<00:01:47.810> Hendricks<00:01:48.049> would<00:01:48.350> get<00:01:48.500> the<00:01:48.619> next

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
so Johnny Hendricks would get the next

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.520 
so Johnny Hendricks would get the next
shot<00:01:49.130> at<00:01:49.340> GSP<00:01:49.510> Carlos<00:01:50.510> Condit<00:01:50.960> will<00:01:51.170> probably

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
shot at GSP Carlos Condit will probably

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.710 
shot at GSP Carlos Condit will probably
kill<00:01:51.799> against<00:01:52.280> Lloyd<00:01:52.640> McDonald<00:01:53.270> whenever<00:01:53.510> Roy

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
kill against Lloyd McDonald whenever Roy

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.370 
kill against Lloyd McDonald whenever Roy
gets<00:01:54.020> Hilda<00:01:54.439> then<00:01:54.619> we<00:01:54.799> have<00:01:55.090> ESP<00:01:56.090> vs<00:01:56.750> Nick<00:01:57.170> Diaz

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
gets Hilda then we have ESP vs Nick Diaz

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.039 
gets Hilda then we have ESP vs Nick Diaz
this<00:01:58.310> pipe<00:01:58.520> was<00:01:58.729> quite<00:01:59.000> interesting<00:01:59.630> but<00:01:59.930> we

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.049 
this pipe was quite interesting but we

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:01.070 
this pipe was quite interesting but we
all<00:02:00.200> knew<00:02:00.350> I<00:02:00.380> was<00:02:00.650> going<00:02:00.770> to

all knew I was going to

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.020 
all knew I was going to
now<00:02:01.230> the<00:02:01.530> SP<00:02:01.920> isn't<00:02:02.280> going<00:02:02.400> to<00:02:02.460> stand<00:02:02.700> up<00:02:02.790> the

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
now the SP isn't going to stand up the

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.970 
now the SP isn't going to stand up the
guy<00:02:03.180> who<00:02:03.240> is<00:02:03.600> probably<00:02:04.020> better<00:02:04.230> than<00:02:04.620> him<00:02:04.950> in

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:04.980 
guy who is probably better than him in

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
has a great job but the funny thing

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.800 
has a great job but the funny thing
about<00:02:10.290> it<00:02:10.619> it<00:02:10.710> was<00:02:10.740> is<00:02:11.190> that<00:02:11.220> ESP<00:02:12.150> even<00:02:12.660> when

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
about it it was is that ESP even when

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.540 
about it it was is that ESP even when
they<00:02:12.900> did<00:02:13.110> stand-up<00:02:13.530> seem<00:02:13.800> to<00:02:13.950> get<00:02:14.070> the<00:02:14.220> better

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
they did stand-up seem to get the better

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.750 
they did stand-up seem to get the better
of<00:02:14.910> big<00:02:15.570> BS<00:02:15.930> standing<00:02:16.410> up<00:02:16.590> but<00:02:17.130> that<00:02:17.280> I<00:02:17.310> believe

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
of big BS standing up but that I believe

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.460 
of big BS standing up but that I believe
that<00:02:17.790> was<00:02:18.060> because<00:02:18.120> Nick<00:02:18.990> Diaz<00:02:19.170> was

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
that was because Nick Diaz was

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.320 
that was because Nick Diaz was
threatened<00:02:19.980> by<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:20.100> takedown<00:02:20.700> he<00:02:20.850> got<00:02:21.030> taken

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
threatened by the takedown he got taken

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.450 
threatened by the takedown he got taken
