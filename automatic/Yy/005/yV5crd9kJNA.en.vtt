then<00:04:11.930> you<00:04:11.959> will<00:04:12.170> get<00:04:12.290> really<00:04:12.620> really<00:04:12.829> nice

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
then you will get really really nice

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:14.920 
then you will get really really nice
meringue<00:04:13.430> so<00:04:14.299> the<00:04:14.390> next<00:04:14.540> thing<00:04:14.750> we're<00:04:14.870> gonna

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
meringue so the next thing we're gonna

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:16.330 
meringue so the next thing we're gonna
do<00:04:15.170> we're<00:04:15.290> just<00:04:15.470> going<00:04:15.620> to<00:04:15.650> incorporate<00:04:15.860> two

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
do we're just going to incorporate two

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.400 
do we're just going to incorporate two
ingredients<00:04:16.820> together<00:04:17.000> so<00:04:17.870> we<00:04:17.989> don't<00:04:18.109> want<00:04:18.320> to

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
ingredients together so we don't want to

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.170 
ingredients together so we don't want to
knock<00:04:18.560> out<00:04:18.769> too<00:04:19.039> much<00:04:19.160> here<00:04:19.459> so<00:04:19.489> first<00:04:19.940> we're

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
knock out too much here so first we're

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.270 
knock out too much here so first we're
going<00:04:20.299> to<00:04:20.389> do<00:04:20.539> just<00:04:20.840> a<00:04:20.989> large<00:04:21.470> spoon<00:04:21.799> into<00:04:22.190> the

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
going to do just a large spoon into the

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.939 
going to do just a large spoon into the
mixture<00:04:22.580> and<00:04:22.880> just<00:04:23.780> you<00:04:24.020> can<00:04:24.050> roughly<00:04:24.560> mix<00:04:24.740> it

00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:24.949 
mixture and just you can roughly mix it

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:26.740 
mixture and just you can roughly mix it
in<00:04:25.070> and<00:04:25.340> that's<00:04:25.850> just<00:04:26.060> to<00:04:26.180> loosen<00:04:26.570> the<00:04:26.660> mixture

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
in and that's just to loosen the mixture

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:28.960 
in and that's just to loosen the mixture
here<00:04:27.199> and<00:04:27.530> then<00:04:28.160> we're<00:04:28.550> going<00:04:28.669> to<00:04:28.760> incorporate

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
here and then we're going to incorporate

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:30.879 
here and then we're going to incorporate
the<00:04:29.419> rest<00:04:29.510> of<00:04:29.750> the<00:04:29.840> mixture<00:04:30.110> very<00:04:30.380> very<00:04:30.590> slowly

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:30.889 
the rest of the mixture very very slowly

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:33.400 
the rest of the mixture very very slowly
just<00:04:31.580> moving<00:04:31.940> this<00:04:32.030> natural<00:04:32.449> up<00:04:32.539> and<00:04:32.750> down<00:04:32.870> you

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
just moving this natural up and down you

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:35.430 
just moving this natural up and down you
don't<00:04:33.650> want<00:04:33.860> to<00:04:33.919> have<00:04:34.130> any<00:04:34.430> white<00:04:34.760> patches

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
don't want to have any white patches

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.080 
don't want to have any white patches
because<00:04:36.440> they<00:04:36.710> will<00:04:36.949> appear<00:04:37.280> in<00:04:37.310> your<00:04:37.490> souffle

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
because they will appear in your souffle

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.689 
because they will appear in your souffle
so<00:04:38.750> and<00:04:39.260> you<00:04:39.440> don't<00:04:39.650> obviously<00:04:39.830> knock<00:04:40.340> out<00:04:40.520> too

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:40.699 
so and you don't obviously knock out too

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:42.250 
so and you don't obviously knock out too
much<00:04:40.820> air<00:04:41.060> so<00:04:41.360> if<00:04:41.449> one<00:04:41.630> of<00:04:41.720> those<00:04:41.840> delicate

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.260 
much air so if one of those delicate

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.439 
much air so if one of those delicate
things<00:04:42.470> we<00:04:42.680> have<00:04:42.860> to<00:04:42.979> be<00:04:43.070> patient<00:04:43.280> and<00:04:43.699> do<00:04:44.360> it

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:44.449 
things we have to be patient and do it

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:51.250 
things we have to be patient and do it
quite<00:04:44.660> slowly<00:04:49.510> so<00:04:50.510> you<00:04:50.570> can<00:04:50.750> see<00:04:50.900> the<00:04:51.020> mixture

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:51.260 
quite slowly so you can see the mixture

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.860 
quite slowly so you can see the mixture
is<00:04:51.380> nice<00:04:51.560> and<00:04:51.949> airy<00:04:52.389> incorporate<00:04:53.389> it<00:04:53.570> together

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:53.870 
is nice and airy incorporate it together

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.350 
is nice and airy incorporate it together
we<00:04:54.020> don't<00:04:54.260> want<00:04:54.440> to<00:04:54.530> mix<00:04:54.949> it<00:04:55.130> too<00:04:55.310> much<00:04:55.340> more<00:04:55.729> so

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
we don't want to mix it too much more so

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:57.490 
we don't want to mix it too much more so
we're<00:04:56.510> going<00:04:56.630> to<00:04:56.690> do<00:04:56.870> now<00:04:57.020> we're<00:04:57.229> just<00:04:57.349> going

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
we're going to do now we're just going

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.779 
we're going to do now we're just going
to<00:04:57.560> put<00:04:57.830> it<00:04:57.919> into<00:04:58.160> our<00:04:58.340> piping<00:04:59.000> bag<00:05:00.550> and<00:05:01.550> just

00:05:01.779 --> 00:05:01.789 
to put it into our piping bag and just

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:04.110 
to put it into our piping bag and just
fill<00:05:01.940> that<00:05:01.970> up

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
fill that up

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.090 
fill that up
I<00:05:04.150> guess<00:05:04.750> once<00:05:05.050> you<00:05:05.199> filled<00:05:05.410> your<00:05:05.470> piping<00:05:05.889> bags

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:06.100 
I guess once you filled your piping bags

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:07.800 
I guess once you filled your piping bags
actually<00:05:06.580> a<00:05:06.610> lot<00:05:06.820> of<00:05:06.910> a<00:05:06.970> mixture<00:05:07.270> then<00:05:07.570> I

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:07.810 
actually a lot of a mixture then I

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:09.870 
actually a lot of a mixture then I
expected<00:05:08.650> I<00:05:08.740> think<00:05:08.770> because<00:05:09.250> the<00:05:09.370> egg<00:05:09.520> whites

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:09.880 
expected I think because the egg whites

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.540 
expected I think because the egg whites
were<00:05:10.090> a<00:05:10.120> lot<00:05:10.360> more<00:05:10.570> and<00:05:10.900> sort<00:05:11.800> of<00:05:11.830> got<00:05:12.160> along<00:05:12.430> my

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550 
were a lot more and sort of got along my

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.490 
were a lot more and sort of got along my
earring<00:05:13.030> so<00:05:13.510> I'm<00:05:13.780> going<00:05:13.960> to<00:05:14.020> use<00:05:14.139> the<00:05:14.290> fancy

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:14.500 
earring so I'm going to use the fancy

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.080 
earring so I'm going to use the fancy
round<00:05:14.800> things<00:05:15.100> here<00:05:15.310> but<00:05:15.520> I'm<00:05:15.610> also<00:05:15.760> going<00:05:16.030> to

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:21.810 
the souffle so the next thing I'm going
to<00:05:20.440> do<00:05:20.530> we<00:05:20.620> don't<00:05:20.800> need<00:05:20.949> any<00:05:21.190> nozzle<00:05:21.580> which<00:05:21.699> is

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:21.820 
to do we don't need any nozzle which is

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.960 
to do we don't need any nozzle which is
going<00:05:21.970> to<00:05:22.030> cut<00:05:22.150> that<00:05:22.270> off<00:05:22.449> and<00:05:22.600> fold<00:05:23.320> them<00:05:23.440> in

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:23.970 
going to cut that off and fold them in

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:30.180 
going to cut that off and fold them in
so<00:05:25.410> take<00:05:26.410> the<00:05:26.560> scissors<00:05:28.680> and<00:05:29.680> we<00:05:29.770> just<00:05:29.949> pull

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:30.190 
so take the scissors and we just pull

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:34.020 
so take the scissors and we just pull
them<00:05:30.310> in<00:05:31.620> just<00:05:32.620> like<00:05:32.800> that<00:05:33.040> and<00:05:33.370> you<00:05:33.580> want<00:05:33.760> them

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:34.030

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:36.700 
quite full but just leave some space

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:38.190 
quite full but just leave some space
because<00:05:36.880> they<00:05:37.090> are<00:05:37.240> going<00:05:37.419> to<00:05:37.510> rise<00:05:37.720> right

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:38.200

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:42.130 
there okay so once for your souffles

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:45.120 
there okay so once for your souffles
lined<00:05:42.400> up<00:05:42.580> we're<00:05:42.820> going<00:05:42.970> to<00:05:43.060> fill<00:05:43.300> um<00:05:43.540> our<00:05:44.139> tray

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:45.130 
lined up we're going to fill um our tray

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:47.280 
lined up we're going to fill um our tray
with<00:05:45.400> hot<00:05:45.700> water<00:05:46.050> okay

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:47.290 
with hot water okay

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:49.290 
with hot water okay
and<00:05:47.470> we<00:05:47.740> want<00:05:47.919> to<00:05:47.979> do<00:05:48.160> it<00:05:48.280> about<00:05:48.400> half<00:05:49.030> way

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:49.300 
and we want to do it about half way

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:54.830 
and we want to do it about half way
through<00:05:49.350> so<00:05:50.350> just<00:05:51.130> enough<00:05:51.490> to<00:05:52.120> cover<00:05:52.330> it<00:05:52.479> I

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:54.840 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:58.350 

would<00:05:55.840> say<00:05:56.050> just<00:05:56.380> about<00:05:56.500> there<00:05:56.919> so<00:05:57.190> and<00:05:57.729> that

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:58.360 
would say just about there so and that

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.390 
would say just about there so and that
goes<00:05:58.539> straight<00:05:58.720> into<00:05:59.110> the<00:05:59.320> oven<00:05:59.350> for<00:05:59.830> about<00:05:59.919> 20

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:00.400 
goes straight into the oven for about 20

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:05.690 
goes straight into the oven for about 20
to<00:06:00.520> 25<00:06:00.850> minutes
