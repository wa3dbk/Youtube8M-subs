new center barrel along with other parts
of<00:01:58.720> the<00:01:58.840> aircraft<00:01:58.990> we'll<00:01:59.770> put<00:01:59.920> the<00:02:00.040> aircraft

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159 
of the aircraft we'll put the aircraft

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:02.430

back<00:02:00.550> together<00:02:00.970> in<00:02:01.149> the<00:02:01.240> fixture<00:02:01.600> go<00:02:02.140> test

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 
back together in the fixture go test

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.200 
back together in the fixture go test
flight<00:02:02.710> and<00:02:02.979> that's<00:02:03.220> pretty<00:02:03.580> much<00:02:03.700> sums<00:02:04.390> it<00:02:04.630> up
