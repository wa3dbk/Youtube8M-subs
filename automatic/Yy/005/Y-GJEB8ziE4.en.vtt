mods<00:00:10.750> basically<00:00:11.260> the<00:00:11.410> sense<00:00:11.620> in<00:00:11.740> a<00:00:11.799> wand<00:00:12.010> that

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:12.129 
mods basically the sense in a wand that

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:14.839 
mods basically the sense in a wand that
lets<00:00:12.879> you<00:00:13.120> copy<00:00:13.450> things<00:00:13.780> and<00:00:13.960> paste<00:00:14.170> it<00:00:14.379> and

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
lets you copy things and paste it and

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.940 
lets you copy things and paste it and
this<00:00:15.849> would<00:00:16.000> be<00:00:16.150> very<00:00:16.330> cheap<00:00:17.080> if<00:00:17.290> it's<00:00:17.500> like<00:00:17.740> in

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:17.950 
this would be very cheap if it's like in

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:19.350 
this would be very cheap if it's like in
survival<00:00:18.490> but<00:00:18.520> you<00:00:18.669> can't<00:00:18.849> get<00:00:18.970> in<00:00:19.060> trial

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:19.360 
survival but you can't get in trial

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:20.790 
survival but you can't get in trial
because<00:00:19.660> there's<00:00:19.810> no<00:00:19.900> crime<00:00:20.169> recipe<00:00:20.500> which<00:00:20.650> is

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:20.800 
because there's no crime recipe which is

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.729 
because there's no crime recipe which is
good<00:00:21.570> so<00:00:22.570> it's<00:00:22.689> meant<00:00:23.050> for<00:00:23.140> creative<00:00:23.559> purposes

00:00:23.729 --> 00:00:23.739 
good so it's meant for creative purposes

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:26.159 
good so it's meant for creative purposes
and<00:00:24.369> this<00:00:25.119> is<00:00:25.210> kind<00:00:25.360> of<00:00:25.390> like<00:00:25.540> the<00:00:25.689> mod<00:00:25.899> that<00:00:26.140> i

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:26.169 
and this is kind of like the mod that i

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:27.839 
and this is kind of like the mod that i
reviewed<00:00:26.439> called<00:00:26.680> the<00:00:26.739> duplicating<00:00:27.309> mod<00:00:27.489> but

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:27.849 
reviewed called the duplicating mod but

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:29.580 
reviewed called the duplicating mod but
it<00:00:27.939> adds<00:00:28.059> that<00:00:28.540> the<00:00:28.689> duplicated<00:00:29.140> mod<00:00:29.320> had<00:00:29.500> to

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:29.590 
it adds that the duplicated mod had to

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.069 
it adds that the duplicated mod had to
block<00:00:29.770> and<00:00:30.070> this<00:00:30.189> one<00:00:30.340> and<00:00:30.460> so<00:00:30.579> on<00:00:31.079> seems

00:00:32.069 --> 00:00:32.079 
block and this one and so on seems

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:34.020 
block and this one and so on seems
easier<00:00:32.439> to<00:00:32.500> work<00:00:32.649> with<00:00:32.710> so<00:00:32.920> you<00:00:33.160> can<00:00:33.760> neck

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.030 
easier to work with so you can neck

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.619 
easier to work with so you can neck
select<00:00:34.390> things<00:00:34.630> yourself<00:00:34.840> and<00:00:36.239> yet<00:00:37.239> so<00:00:37.540> you

00:00:37.619 --> 00:00:37.629 
select things yourself and yet so you

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:40.140 
select things yourself and yet so you
get<00:00:37.750> the<00:00:37.870> punt<00:00:38.110> and<00:00:38.290> in<00:00:38.950> order<00:00:39.190> to<00:00:39.370> suck<00:00:39.790> blocks

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:40.150 
get the punt and in order to suck blocks

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.180 
get the punt and in order to suck blocks
you<00:00:40.510> right-click<00:00:40.780> as<00:00:41.170> you<00:00:41.500> usually<00:00:41.680> would<00:00:41.920> in

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.190 
you right-click as you usually would in

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.500 
you right-click as you usually would in
mods<00:00:42.420> and<00:00:44.579> you<00:00:45.579> can't<00:00:45.850> and<00:00:46.030> you<00:00:46.270> can<00:00:46.450> either

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510 
mods and you can't and you can either

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.090 
mods and you can't and you can either
right-click<00:00:46.810> or<00:00:47.110> shift<00:00:47.410> right-click

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 
right-click or shift right-click

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.250 
right-click or shift right-click
I<00:00:48.130> find<00:00:48.579> shift<00:00:48.910> right-clicking<00:00:49.600> better<00:00:49.900> like

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.260 
I find shift right-clicking better like

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.270 
I find shift right-clicking better like
when<00:00:50.440> it's<00:00:50.620> just<00:00:50.890> doing<00:00:51.280> specific<00:00:51.910> blocks<00:00:52.270> and

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
when it's just doing specific blocks and

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.410 
when it's just doing specific blocks and
right<00:00:54.280> clicks<00:00:54.520> were<00:00:54.820> just<00:00:55.060> like<00:00:55.180> what<00:00:55.360> it

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420 
right clicks were just like what it

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.860 
right clicks were just like what it
makes<00:00:55.540> random<00:00:55.870> bigger<00:00:56.530> blocks<00:00:56.860> but<00:00:57.850> I<00:00:58.239> think

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:58.870 
makes random bigger blocks but I think

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.900 
makes random bigger blocks but I think
it's<00:00:59.020> really<00:00:59.320> the<00:00:59.380> same<00:00:59.649> thing<00:00:59.680> to<00:01:00.550> be<00:01:00.640> honest

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:00.910 
it's really the same thing to be honest

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.109 
it's really the same thing to be honest
and<00:01:01.530> once<00:01:02.530> you<00:01:02.680> have<00:01:02.829> some<00:01:03.130> blocks<00:01:03.430> selected

00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:04.119 
and once you have some blocks selected

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:06.389 
and once you have some blocks selected
that<00:01:04.629> you<00:01:04.750> they<00:01:05.110> want<00:01:05.379> you<00:01:05.649> hit<00:01:05.799> C<00:01:06.189> on<00:01:06.369> your

00:01:06.389 --> 00:01:06.399 
that you they want you hit C on your

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:09.749 
that you they want you hit C on your
keyboard<00:01:06.549> and<00:01:07.090> then<00:01:07.680> you<00:01:08.680> can<00:01:08.860> paste<00:01:09.520> it

00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:09.759 
keyboard and then you can paste it

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:11.399 
keyboard and then you can paste it
wherever<00:01:09.909> you<00:01:10.149> like<00:01:10.389> but<00:01:10.659> it<00:01:11.049> doesn't<00:01:11.319> really

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:11.409 
wherever you like but it doesn't really

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:13.349 
wherever you like but it doesn't really
paste<00:01:11.770> in<00:01:11.979> the<00:01:12.100> location<00:01:12.729> where<00:01:12.759> you'd<00:01:13.060> want

00:01:13.349 --> 00:01:13.359 
paste in the location where you'd want

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:17.370 
paste in the location where you'd want
it<00:01:13.479> to<00:01:13.630> oh<00:01:14.789> I<00:01:15.789> would<00:01:16.389> copy<00:01:16.569> that<00:01:16.869> and<00:01:17.020> then<00:01:17.139> copy

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
it to oh I would copy that and then copy

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.200 
it to oh I would copy that and then copy
like<00:01:17.619> whatever<00:01:17.950> anything<00:01:18.130> see<00:01:18.789> there<00:01:18.939> we<00:01:19.060> go

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
like whatever anything see there we go

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.379 
like whatever anything see there we go
so<00:01:20.109> copy<00:01:20.530> and<00:01:20.859> paste

00:01:22.379 --> 00:01:22.389 
so copy and paste

00:01:22.389 --> 00:01:24.120 
so copy and paste
yeah<00:01:22.869> it<00:01:22.990> doesn't<00:01:23.139> just<00:01:23.740> kind<00:01:23.920> of<00:01:23.950> hard<00:01:24.069> to

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
yeah it doesn't just kind of hard to

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:25.620 
yeah it doesn't just kind of hard to
place<00:01:24.429> it<00:01:24.549> where<00:01:24.700> you<00:01:24.729> wherever<00:01:25.060> you'd<00:01:25.329> want

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
place it where you wherever you'd want

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.770 
place it where you wherever you'd want
it<00:01:25.749> to<00:01:25.869> be<00:01:26.020> but<00:01:26.679> whatever<00:01:27.329> still<00:01:28.329> works<00:01:28.539> out

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
it to be but whatever still works out

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.810 
it to be but whatever still works out
quite<00:01:29.350> fairly<00:01:29.709> Oh<00:01:29.979> times

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.950 

so<00:01:33.820> yeah<00:01:34.060> it's<00:01:34.240> pretty<00:01:34.270> cool<00:01:34.630> like<00:01:34.780> how<00:01:34.900> you

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960
