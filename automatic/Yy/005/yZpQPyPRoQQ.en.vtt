 4 What products are you going to introduce now? 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:14.520
 Sony Alpha 77 is a product like this 

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:18.960
 35.8 35mm f1.8 lens with the purchase will be 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:19.949
 Just brightly in the mountains old film camera quiz increasing signs last week that about 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.730
 afoot 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:27.480
 Bok-da is now a diversion file of iris. 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:33.420
 I was able to buy it with the same good one I could use. 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:41.190
 The portrait is up. Yes, and once in the case of Alpha 77 , 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:45.359
 As in the example junggeupgi from the lineup and what ads are now many other examples I 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.410
 I am talking about companies as the most powerful midrange. 

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:49.970
 Look 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:54.460
 It's not wrong. Yeah. 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:01:00.050
 Whether gatchwoya what language seems to have what is tolerable gun Titus 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:05.000
 It is made of aluminum, dustproof and moisture proof, it is color-resistant and waterproof to support 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:07.070
 Because the bird itself is actually the basis for some evaluation, 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.570
 As gatgoyo will get pretty close affected 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:16.870
 Yeah, now I'm using Alpha 55, 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:21.860
 Alpha 55 is really just a camera rather than just a real camera 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:24.680
 I felt like a digital toy, but I want it on the second floor. 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:27.740
 It's a lot bigger than 55. 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:32.090
 About 1.5 times as much 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:34.820
 Much in the past, so now only the really long lines when Nikon Canon Camera 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.659
 I feel a lot like that. 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:40.329
 Yes 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:43.659
 Well vivo sing something 

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:47.439
 The most distinctive now is the transparent push 1 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:52.720
 Translucent Mirror No Difficulty In Transferring To The Transfer Maze 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:56.289
 A number of special features resulting from the projection can be found in the Alpha series 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:02:01.509
 Awesome 5 7 7 7 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:06.909
 What is the biggest feature of these guys is that when you take real-time video 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:11.319
 Phase difference or focus, or 12 speakers now 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:14.790
 These are the biggest features that come from that part 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:19.980
 Yes. 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:24.209
 Once the internal device performance is also quite a lot faster raguyo floating example 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:28.290
 r4 When I was dressed, it was actually a bit stuffy. 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:29.630
 Yeah, there's a blackout out there that's been filmed since. 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:34.160
 Yes 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:39.440
 Now, if you take the fact now, it'll be Mary so you can take another shot right away . 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:43.520
 But when you laugh more, the performance inside the device is actually a bit lacking. 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:48.350
 Take a long piece of writing two others a little bit delay time is enormous dissatisfaction on the part of 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:49.820
 Once I've had 77 cases, too little control in that part 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:55.610
 I feel a lot easier. 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:56.900
 And now something like a Chinese word itguyo given the fact that just two buttons missing 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:01.190
 What 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.090
 Gamdolah the paper or something even know what such compensation etc missed word 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:07.010
 This is all. 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:09.940
 Integration function t etc. So you can make various adjustments within the top button 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.940
 When I was there 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:17.360
 I think that's a lot different. 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:21.980
 It's a little different than just dialing. Yes . 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:26.930
 It has been designed to make you feel luxurious, 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:33.620
 I think I can use it because it looks or functions satisfactorily . 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:36.740
 55 5 7 More than this series, we have a little more weight, 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:42.530
 Except for the best price 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:43.750
 Yeah, actually , there are some people who put out more Marys by that part . 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:50.579
 Yes 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:50.579
 I've just looked at Alpha 77 like this .
