 technical they just need her exo and 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.660

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.309
 other match substitutions but only in the case 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.040
 getting it did not affect the results 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.050

 dynamics and composition already shows 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.010
 Dolphins do better 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.140
 dragons in the first week 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.690
 the most important thing is not to change players and

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.570
 cider among them 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.930
 difficult to distinguish 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.270
 last week and 125 champions were 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.950
 nicked or banned 37 and 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.020
 the only champion who never did

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.820
 only twice 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.310
 the most sought after champions would be

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.530
 other regions 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.420
 so nothing surprising here 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.250
 upset only hekarim who did 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.680
 did not realize myself when finally 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.189
 I came out of the dream team bans last 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.250

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:03.030
 things being equal when eating was higher 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.740

 match against solar and 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.500
 but played without death and with great when 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.469
 separately but already to note that immortality

 on new sedzhuani played symfony lex to 

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:21.730
 Unfortunately, the playpen was not dead 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.680
 only in one of the matches last 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.569

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:31.000
 playing a very aggressive midlaner building 1 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.280
 just got a shot from the tower than and 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.859
 used flash to take kill 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.620
 however zamza cancer also did not sleep and almost 

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:40.329
 instantly equalized the score at the latest 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.519
 but at the same time the most beautiful he's glad 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:44.829

 take years tekkyl opposite the sound of the sea 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.720
 but dodging we hear from the ultimate 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.159
 smurf not only survived we killed the enemy 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.430
 on the turn when he continued 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:59.829
 chase it under t2 highest kill 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.319

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:04.090
 last week is also an adkeri then just 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:05.769
 his grace showed what it means to play 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.109
 aggressively when the opponent tries 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:10.269
 impose you battle counterpart satio from 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:12.340
 morgans allowed to strike back at 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:14.290
 beginning on victor street and then on 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.629
 poppy who decided to win fight on 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.729
 a couple of sex and all this time intern 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:20.799

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:23.049
 attacks distance completely sure 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:25.209
 that the team will not abandon him looking 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:26.979
 how freely he moved around the map like 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:29.109
 played on the line in teamfight involuntarily 

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:30.459
 think that the cis scene lost 

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:33.129
 excellent shooter 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:35.709
 Still record for bis 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:37.629
 belongs to lexu adakeri hargie us in 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:39.760
 all three games he showed great 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:41.829
 using yourself and tristan but him 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.139
 the only triplkill was made the most 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:45.760
 the first game against the dragon 

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:47.650
 the moment became rather final 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.599
 a chord of victory ashirov and once again 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.269
 stressed how in front of opponents 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:54.099
 they were in that match however cordy us 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:55.720
 distinguished themselves last week not only 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:57.939
 performance of individual players 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.500
 usher and statistically fastest and 

00:03:57.939 --> 00:04:01.419
 starseriya team played 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.970
 they took from the very early dragon and 

00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:05.889
 Baron's earliest 1 tower and the most 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.049
 Early inhibitor stand firmly 

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:09.669
 object oriented in gameplay also 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:12.459
 allowed to be their only team 

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:14.199
 which took 5 dragons like the case with 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:16.209
 triple kill em Lex and this was hardly 

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:18.269
 so necessary but allowed 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.560
 complete the game confidently and beautifully 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:22.960
 perfect control of objects can 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.849
 brag 7 just this is the only one 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.880
 star team a series which for the first 

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:27.950
 week did not give 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.020
 not one dragon or baron 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:30.950
 opponents even being a minority 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.810
 an hour we managed 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:34.640
 and in the zone of the enemy or play out 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:36.410
 the situation on the map so that 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.750
 the enemies just did not have time to come on time 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:40.580
 similar control of dragons possess 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.500
 dolphins but it did not save them from 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:45.080
 defeat in the match against rocks off 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.270
 Precisely Foresters degrees last week 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.610
 guaranteed her team 2 barons 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:52.100
 stealing them right from under the nose 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.380
 Alexey is one of the strongest homework peaks 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.900
 spring split did not let him down in the match 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:58.910
 v. corp 1 where he dipped me twice 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.730
 forester carp when they arrogantly and 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:04.160
 the ward took the baron this week on 

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:06.290
 are waiting for another nine matches can anyone 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.450
 interrupt a series of victories ashirov recover 

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:10.610
 Do exit and dragon from defeat and how 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:13.160
 will affect patch 5 10 at peak bank 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:15.530
 I'll tell you more about this then trl 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.450
 Sior Well, I advise you to pay attention to

 match correspondent trend ask swingers 

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:21.320
 great opportunity to confirm 

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:23.210
 championship title for one team or 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.930
 revenge for second place in the grand final 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:27.910
