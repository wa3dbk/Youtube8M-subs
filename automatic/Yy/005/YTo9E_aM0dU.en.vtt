00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:27.740 
point one point five so that one and

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.669 
point one point five so that one and
first<00:00:28.740> we<00:00:29.070> need<00:00:29.220> Forge<00:00:29.580> to<00:00:30.240> make<00:00:30.420> it<00:00:30.539> work<00:00:30.720> so

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
first we need Forge to make it work so

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.120 
first we need Forge to make it work so
we<00:00:31.920> need<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.340> download<00:00:32.700> forge<00:00:33.800> so<00:00:34.800> get<00:00:34.980> the

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
we need to download forge so get the

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.010 
we need to download forge so get the
universal<00:00:35.969> version<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:37.700> it's<00:00:38.700> an<00:00:38.820> ad<00:00:38.969> fly<00:00:39.239> we

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
universal version and it's an ad fly we

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.229 
universal version and it's an ad fly we
also<00:00:40.170> need<00:00:40.290> winrar<00:00:41.100> as<00:00:42.530> well<00:00:43.530> up<00:00:43.829> and<00:00:44.090> when<00:00:45.090> r

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
also need winrar as well up and when r

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:51.020 
also need winrar as well up and when r
is<00:00:45.270> not<00:00:45.629> working<00:00:45.960> at<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.050> moment<00:00:46.110> so<00:00:50.030> we'll

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
is not working at the moment so we'll

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.139 
is not working at the moment so we'll
find<00:00:51.420> it<00:00:51.570> over<00:00:51.809> here<00:00:52.399> and<00:00:53.399> somewhere<00:00:53.760> else<00:00:53.910> if

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
find it over here and somewhere else if

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.600 
find it over here and somewhere else if
you<00:00:54.629> have<00:00:54.780> 32-bit<00:00:55.260> windows<00:00:55.739> you<00:00:55.920> get<00:00:56.039> 32<00:00:56.309> bit

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
you have 32-bit windows you get 32 bit

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.139 
you have 32-bit windows you get 32 bit
because<00:00:56.820> 64-bit<00:00:57.570> windows<00:00:57.809> hit<00:00:57.989> 42<00:00:59.149> 64-bit

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
because 64-bit windows hit 42 64-bit

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.779 
because 64-bit windows hit 42 64-bit
here<00:01:00.480> we<00:01:00.600> go<00:01:00.690> so<00:01:01.530> I'm<00:01:01.649> 64<00:01:02.160> bit<00:01:02.309> windows<00:01:02.460> I'll

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
here we go so I'm 64 bit windows I'll

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:08.390 
here we go so I'm 64 bit windows I'll
get<00:01:02.910> that<00:01:03.799> download<00:01:06.290> and<00:01:07.290> start<00:01:07.799> downloading

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
get that download and start downloading

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.030 
get that download and start downloading
so<00:01:09.270> save<00:01:09.510> it<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:09.930> add<00:01:10.320> fly<00:01:10.530> as<00:01:10.590> well<00:01:11.240> skip<00:01:12.240> ad

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
so save it and add fly as well skip ad

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:19.640 
so save it and add fly as well skip ad
save<00:01:15.470> back<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.799> instructions<00:01:18.380> we<00:01:19.380> also

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650
