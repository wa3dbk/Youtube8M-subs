00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 hello how are you I am the one and welcome 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.270
 to this little bit to the channel I hope that 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.859
 find the day of 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.870
 today I want to show you what my routine 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.940
 of reading what do I do when I go 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.009
 to think a book how I choose posts 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.690
 among other things and well I hope 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.690
 that you like it a lot and let's start 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.620
 The first thing I do is choose the 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.600
 book I'm going to read for that I'm going to my strip 

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:30.870
 of books that are pending to read 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.610
 omit the tibia and choose some titles 

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.290
 I read what comes in the back 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.270
 to give me no idea what the 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.370
 book in case I do not know much about him 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.890
 persistence I'm leaving at that moment 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.170
 or better some other title my choice 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.930
 almost always depends on the last book 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.330
 that you have read for example if my last 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.239
 book was a dystopia I like to change 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:53.100
 of airs choosing some classic or if 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.770
 it was a book of romance tends to choose 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.780
 some fantasy once you have 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.570
 chosen which is the book that I am going to read 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.989
 what I do is write down on the second page 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.880
 when you start reading that book this is 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.340
 in my opinion a very nice way of 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.649
 customize your book and remember how much 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.630
 time have you read an example of 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:14.550
 a book that I have written down is harry 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.560
 potter and the order of the phoenix that is a 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:19.259
 book to which I am very fond of this 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.630
 I started reading it on June 27, 2006 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.670
 and I finished it on July 6 of the same year 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.070
 but sometimes he did not remember he had 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.710
 left this note and when you see him again 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.479
 I was very excited another example is the book 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.760
 of dawn that by the way I do not 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.920
 he remembered how huge it is and good here 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.770
 I only put the date that was 13 of 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.350
 June 2009 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.179
 The next thing I do is use a 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.530
 application that I really like and that I 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:47.130
 help keep my readings 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.570
 organized this application is shabby and 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.340
 I'm going to leave you here in the 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.470
 box what is my user if they want 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.080
 add me 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:58.340
 What I do next is go to the little button 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.340
 which says scan 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.810
 we will see a rectangle that is 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.840
 with which we are going to scan the code 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.240
 This isbn code is international 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.730
 standard book name is an identifier 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.130
 only for books this way is going to 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.650
 appear exactly the book in the 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.540
 edition that you are reading I do this 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.940
 so that by adding it in my reading 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.560
 current on wifi have the same number of 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.450
 pages of the book that I'm 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.550
 reading and going to update my progress 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.040
 the percentage that I carry is correct 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.260
 before when I did not scan it happened to me that 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.090
 added the book of another edition and 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.010
 I had fewer pages than the book that I 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.930
 I was reading then it appeared to me that 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.450
 I had already finished it when I really 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.640
 it was not like that and the time has come for 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.620
 make a refreshing drink because 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.810
 lately been making a lot of heat 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.900
 so I like to add water in this 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:53.030
 Little boy, I put a sachet of tea and 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.790
 be it green tea lemon tea or tea 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.280
 chamomile I add a little bit of 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.110
 sugar and I start it revolver very very 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.690
 well until the water feel to put 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:06.850
 of green color and so that the drink is 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.850
 more refreshing I add some crimes 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.769
 and our drink has been ready and 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.870
 It is perfect to accompany it with a 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:18.569
 reading in this summer 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.280
 now it's time to choose the separator 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:20.819
 which I will use for my reading 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.950
 current 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:24.510
 I have these little separators that 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.549
 are magnets the truth is that they are very 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.440
 pretty and very practical and I like it 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:30.780
 use it mostly in books that are 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.060
 delgaditos but when the books are a 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.829
 little prettier I like to use these 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.780
 traditional dividers that are more 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:38.640
 long let me down here in the 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.680
 comments what are your separators 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.290
 favorites 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:46.069
 and now it's time to enjoy 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.069
 our reading 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.170
 as I have a memory not very good 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:03.690
 let's say to remember things 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:08.030
 important books what I do is 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:08.030
 create a text file on my ipad 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:13.110
 Y 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.990
 at the top I put when 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:18.150
 I started reading books abajito given a 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:20.340
 small summary of each chapter for 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.350
 that I do not forget or what it is about 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.990
 I put the phrases that I liked the most 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:28.460
 book and finally the new words 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.460
 I do not know about that book 

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:40.089
 once I have finished reading the 

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:42.279
 book it 's time to put the posters in 

00:04:40.089 --> 00:04:44.049
 our favorite phrases to me I like 

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:46.179
 put them until you have finished the 

00:04:44.049 --> 00:04:48.519
 book because I feel that mistreating and 

00:04:46.179 --> 00:04:50.439
 I put them before the question that I 

00:04:48.519 --> 00:04:53.259
 be a lot when you start using the 

00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:55.539
 Post-it is what kind of post-it used 

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:57.669
 they have many types there are ones that are 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:59.649
 of plastic like these here and there 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:01.749
 others that are paper like these by 

00:04:59.649 --> 00:05:04.209
 here to show you what the 

00:05:01.749 --> 00:05:06.609
 difference between using a type of post-it 

00:05:04.209 --> 00:05:08.919
 and others I will use of various types here 

00:05:06.609 --> 00:05:11.019
 and so good to choose the color what 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:13.299
 I do is see the cover of the book and deal 

00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:15.429
 to combine the colors for example this 

00:05:13.299 --> 00:05:17.709
 it's like purple with pink then I'm going to 

00:05:15.429 --> 00:05:20.049
 choose from that tone and well let's 

00:05:17.709 --> 00:05:22.449
 start with our first post and in 

00:05:20.049 --> 00:05:24.009
 this case is one of plastic and if you 

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:26.079
 they fix has a part that is 

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:27.639
 transparent why this is one of my 

00:05:26.079 --> 00:05:29.799
 favorites and those that most 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:32.619
 I recommend because when you paste it 

00:05:29.799 --> 00:05:34.659
 it's not for the letters we're going to put 

00:05:32.619 --> 00:05:36.729
 that other purple post-it that is also 

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:39.670
 transparent as you can see it is very 

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:42.370
 very well in the book 

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:44.409
 now we are going to use this post-it that 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:47.019
 it's paper 

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:49.569
 how are these post-its a bit wide 

00:05:47.019 --> 00:05:51.510
 What I do is remind you a bit of the 

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:54.030
 shore 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:56.250
 at the time of pasting them like we can not 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:58.980
 put them over the letters because if not 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:02.160
 the cover is already necessary to trim it from 

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:05.160
 the edge the advantage of the poles of 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:08.510
 role is that they are much cheaper and 

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:11.360
 there is more variety of colors 

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:13.220
 now we are going to use these post-its of 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:16.280
 plastic that are like an arrow shape 

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:17.930
 the truth is they are very very beautiful the 

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:19.550
 problem is that when sticking 

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:22.040
 as they do not have the transparent part 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:24.020
 as the first ones cover a little 

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:26.170
 letters but in the same way if it is reached 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:26.170
 to see 

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:31.410
 and well this has been all for this video 

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:33.780
 I hope you liked my routine 

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:35.730
 reading do not forget to share it because I 

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:37.830
 would help a lot and give me a little hand 

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:41.000
 up if you liked them I see them in the 

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:41.000
 next video bye 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:46.900
