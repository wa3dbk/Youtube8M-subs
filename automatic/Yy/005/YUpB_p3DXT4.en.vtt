00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.180
 Declaration on the construction of chambers 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:14.650
 silencers and absorption 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.910
 mufflers and the disadvantages 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:21.610
 from kammerscheid received 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:23.320
 turbocharged engines are the exhaust gases in one 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.060
 kammerscheid a few like the name already 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:29.440
 says through one can be led around the so 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:31.119
 reduce the noise level of the exhaust gas flow 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.739
 is like the construction shown here 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:35.430
 through several areas of the damper 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:35.430
 directed 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.559
 through the chambers construction it comes in the 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.760
 silencer to swirl out of it 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:48.230
 results in a high thermal 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:54.530
 stress and it builds log 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:56.809
 exhaust gas back pressure on an exhaust gas back pressure 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.180
 is wanted with suction motors as well 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:01.219
 necessary with tuned turbo engines can 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.839
 However, to hear this exhaust temperatures 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:05.379
 and a winner's performance 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:05.379
 guided 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:31.180
 Let us now come to the construction of one 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.180
 pullbacks absorption switches 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:41.780
 rolex absorption schalker fan tutte 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:43.280
 exhaust stream can not be by individual 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:47.350
 but led by a not under 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.350
 part of the largest part dedicated 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.159
 Thus, there is no tangle in the 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:59.439
 Dante and the exhaust gases of turbocharged engines 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:59.439
 can be transported unhindered into the free 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:10.270
 In the following we show in brackets one 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.270
