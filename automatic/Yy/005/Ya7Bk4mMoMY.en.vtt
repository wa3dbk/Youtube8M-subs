00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
hello this is an update to my Radio

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.550 
hello this is an update to my Radio
Shack<00:00:04.230> black<00:00:04.560> phantom<00:00:05.160> RC<00:00:05.700> project<00:00:06.560> I've

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
Shack black phantom RC project I've

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.089 
Shack black phantom RC project I've
taken<00:00:07.890> it<00:00:08.099> apart

00:00:10.089 --> 00:00:10.099 
taken it apart

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:16.490 
taken it apart
taking<00:00:11.099> the<00:00:11.190> motors<00:00:11.550> out<00:00:14.330> as<00:00:15.330> my<00:00:15.660> first<00:00:15.960> goal

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
taking the motors out as my first goal

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.320 
taking the motors out as my first goal
was<00:00:16.800> just<00:00:16.859> to<00:00:17.250> do<00:00:17.490> that<00:00:18.199> because<00:00:20.210> you<00:00:21.210> know<00:00:21.300> I

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
was just to do that because you know I

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.689 
was just to do that because you know I
wanted<00:00:21.720> to<00:00:21.810> really<00:00:22.350> put<00:00:22.650> some<00:00:22.680> good<00:00:23.070> motors<00:00:23.460> in

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
wanted to really put some good motors in

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:30.230 
wanted to really put some good motors in
here<00:00:24.470> so<00:00:25.470> I<00:00:25.500> decided<00:00:26.220> on<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:27.289> lrp<00:00:29.240> micro

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
here so I decided on the lrp micro

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.850 
here so I decided on the lrp micro
modified<00:00:31.460> 380<00:00:32.460> high<00:00:32.880> torque<00:00:33.270> and<00:00:33.590> the<00:00:34.590> part

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
modified 380 high torque and the part

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.810 
modified 380 high torque and the part
number<00:00:35.219> for<00:00:35.250> that<00:00:35.489> is<00:00:36.530> five<00:00:37.530> two<00:00:37.950> zero<00:00:37.980> three

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
number for that is five two zero three

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:45.139 
number for that is five two zero three
zero<00:00:40.879> so<00:00:41.879> I've<00:00:41.940> got<00:00:42.120> two<00:00:42.329> of<00:00:42.480> those<00:00:43.850> and<00:00:44.850> that's

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
zero so I've got two of those and that's

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.290 
zero so I've got two of those and that's
what<00:00:45.360> they<00:00:45.629> look<00:00:45.809> like<00:00:46.110> they're<00:00:46.710> real<00:00:46.890> shiny

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
what they look like they're real shiny

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.760 
what they look like they're real shiny

steel one with a 2.3 millimeter bore
shaft<00:01:18.720> size<00:01:20.720> but<00:01:21.720> I<00:01:21.810> did<00:01:22.110> find<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.860> three<00:01:23.189> point

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490

one<00:01:23.670> seven<00:01:24.030> millimeter<00:01:24.600> bore<00:01:26.390> which<00:01:27.390> is

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
one seven millimeter bore which is

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.370 
one seven millimeter bore which is
pretty<00:01:28.860> much<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.250> standard<00:01:29.780> what<00:01:30.780> I<00:01:30.810> did<00:01:31.110> was

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
pretty much the standard what I did was

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.890 
pretty much the standard what I did was
I<00:01:31.799> took<00:01:32.640> some<00:01:32.850> stainless<00:01:33.600> steel<00:01:34.040> rod<00:01:35.689> just<00:01:36.689> got

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
I took some stainless steel rod just got

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.480 
I took some stainless steel rod just got
a<00:01:36.930> hole<00:01:37.170> in<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.439> center<00:01:39.110> the<00:01:40.110> 1/8<00:01:40.500> outside

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
a hole in the center the 1/8 outside

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.609 
a hole in the center the 1/8 outside
diameter<00:01:41.759> which<00:01:42.390> is<00:01:42.420> pretty<00:01:42.810> equivalent<00:01:43.439> to

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
diameter which is pretty equivalent to

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.249 
diameter which is pretty equivalent to
three<00:01:43.950> point<00:01:44.280> one<00:01:44.460> seven<00:01:44.759> millimeter<00:01:45.299> took<00:01:46.140> a

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
three point one seven millimeter took a

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.359 
three point one seven millimeter took a
vise<00:01:46.470> I<00:01:47.479> cut<00:01:48.479> a<00:01:48.509> piece<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:49.079> pressed<00:01:49.590> it<00:01:49.770> in<00:01:49.920> the

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
vise I cut a piece and pressed it in the

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.950 
vise I cut a piece and pressed it in the
pinion<00:01:50.700> with<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:50.909> vise<00:01:51.090> I<00:01:51.329> pressed<00:01:51.689> it<00:01:51.840> in

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
pinion with the vise I pressed it in

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.800 
pinion with the vise I pressed it in
this<00:01:52.110> pinion<00:01:52.790> I've<00:01:53.790> got<00:01:54.000> it<00:01:54.149> I<00:01:54.240> got<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.450> drill

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
this pinion I've got it I got a drill

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.130 
this pinion I've got it I got a drill
bit<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.229> I've<00:01:55.380> drilled<00:01:55.680> it<00:01:55.890> out<00:01:56.689> back<00:01:57.689> sava

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
bit and I've drilled it out back sava

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.679 
bit and I've drilled it out back sava
finished<00:01:58.710> it<00:01:58.979> it's<00:01:59.670> about<00:01:59.909> halfway<00:02:00.149> drilled

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
finished it it's about halfway drilled

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.179 
finished it it's about halfway drilled
out<00:02:00.840> but<00:02:01.020> it's<00:02:01.140> going<00:02:01.259> to<00:02:01.320> work<00:02:01.469> fine<00:02:01.770> that<00:02:02.040> my

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
out but it's going to work fine that my

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.899 
out but it's going to work fine that my
drill<00:02:02.460> bit<00:02:02.700> broke<00:02:02.939> I<00:02:03.360> just<00:02:04.170> got<00:02:04.409> through

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
drill bit broke I just got through

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:07.310 
drill bit broke I just got through
tapping<00:02:05.909> it<00:02:06.030> getting<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.450> broken<00:02:06.840> piece<00:02:07.049> out

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
tapping it getting the broken piece out

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.749 
tapping it getting the broken piece out
but<00:02:08.069> it's<00:02:08.190> going<00:02:08.340> to<00:02:08.399> work<00:02:08.459> fine

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
but it's going to work fine

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.290 
but it's going to work fine
this<00:02:10.149> particular<00:02:10.929> pinion<00:02:11.560> is<00:02:11.800> a<00:02:12.250> double<00:02:13.060> group

so<00:02:29.670> I<00:02:30.670> just<00:02:31.239> got<00:02:31.420> to<00:02:31.450> finish<00:02:32.260> drilling<00:02:32.709> it<00:02:32.950> out

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:33.099 
so I just got to finish drilling it out

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:37.589 
so I just got to finish drilling it out
and<00:02:33.430> then<00:02:34.330> I'll<00:02:34.450> have<00:02:34.629> to<00:02:35.910> do<00:02:36.910> the<00:02:37.030> same<00:02:37.269> thing

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 
and then I'll have to do the same thing

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:41.640 
and then I'll have to do the same thing
to<00:02:37.900> the<00:02:38.019> other<00:02:38.049> one<00:02:38.410> I've<00:02:38.590> got<00:02:38.620> to<00:02:40.200> but<00:02:41.200> I<00:02:41.230> just

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
to the other one I've got to but I just

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:48.780 
to the other one I've got to but I just
I<00:02:41.920> don't<00:02:42.790> have<00:02:42.940> a<00:02:42.970> drill<00:02:43.360> bits<00:02:43.569> right<00:02:43.870> now<00:02:47.790> so

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
I don't have a drill bits right now so

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.089 
I don't have a drill bits right now so
that's<00:02:48.970> kind<00:02:49.569> of<00:02:49.599> been<00:02:49.780> my<00:02:49.959> progress<00:02:50.319> I<00:02:50.829> was

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:51.099 
that's kind of been my progress I was

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:52.650 
that's kind of been my progress I was
drilling<00:02:51.370> that<00:02:51.670> out<00:02:51.879> this<00:02:52.060> morning<00:02:52.510> was

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
drilling that out this morning was

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.460 
drilling that out this morning was
working<00:02:53.049> really<00:02:53.290> good<00:02:53.500> but<00:02:54.870> that's<00:02:55.870> about<00:02:56.410> as

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
working really good but that's about as

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.960 
working really good but that's about as
far<00:02:56.560> as<00:02:56.920> I've<00:02:57.069> gotten<00:02:58.170> my<00:02:59.170> next<00:02:59.640> move<00:03:00.640> will<00:03:00.940> be

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
far as I've gotten my next move will be

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.589 
far as I've gotten my next move will be
to<00:03:01.500> order<00:03:02.500> some<00:03:02.769> ball<00:03:03.010> bearings<00:03:03.459> and<00:03:03.760> take

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:04.599 
to order some ball bearings and take

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:07.289 
to order some ball bearings and take
apart<00:03:04.930> the<00:03:05.079> gearboxes<00:03:05.859> and<00:03:06.000> replace<00:03:07.000> those

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:07.299 
apart the gearboxes and replace those

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:09.599 
apart the gearboxes and replace those
plastic<00:03:07.959> bushings<00:03:08.440> with<00:03:08.620> ball<00:03:08.859> bearings<00:03:09.340> and

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:09.609 
plastic bushings with ball bearings and

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:14.250 
plastic bushings with ball bearings and
get<00:03:10.450> some<00:03:10.920> ceramic<00:03:12.540> gear<00:03:13.540> grease<00:03:13.900> for<00:03:14.200> the

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
get some ceramic gear grease for the

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.300 
get some ceramic gear grease for the
plastic<00:03:14.500> gears<00:03:15.040> rebuild<00:03:15.639> the<00:03:15.790> gearboxes<00:03:17.310> so

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
plastic gears rebuild the gearboxes so

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.830 
plastic gears rebuild the gearboxes so
once<00:03:18.970> I<00:03:19.150> get<00:03:19.209> the<00:03:19.540> motors<00:03:19.900> in<00:03:20.169> there<00:03:21.660> which<00:03:22.660> I

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
once I get the motors in there which I

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:29.670 
once I get the motors in there which I
found<00:03:24.209> that<00:03:26.609> is<00:03:27.609> plastic<00:03:28.000> motor<00:03:28.660> mounts<00:03:29.139> they

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
found that is plastic motor mounts they

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.159 
found that is plastic motor mounts they
will<00:03:29.950> they<00:03:30.519> will<00:03:30.549> work<00:03:31.060> with<00:03:31.090> these<00:03:31.480> lrp

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:32.169 
will they will work with these lrp

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:36.030 
will they will work with these lrp
motors<00:03:32.560> except<00:03:33.209> there's<00:03:34.209> a<00:03:34.419> little<00:03:35.040> right

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
motors except there's a little right

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.409 
motors except there's a little right
there<00:03:36.069> where<00:03:36.400> my<00:03:36.519> finger<00:03:36.880> might<00:03:37.060> be<00:03:37.180> hard<00:03:37.329> to

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:37.419 
there where my finger might be hard to

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:41.599 
there where my finger might be hard to
see<00:03:37.530> it's<00:03:38.530> like<00:03:38.799> it's<00:03:39.280> like<00:03:39.370> a<00:03:39.459> plastic<00:03:40.560> pin

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:41.609 
see it's like it's like a plastic pin

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:45.420 
see it's like it's like a plastic pin
that<00:03:42.609> lines<00:03:43.359> up<00:03:43.660> with<00:03:43.720> the<00:03:44.049> original<00:03:44.430> mabushii

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
that lines up with the original mabushii

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.670 
that lines up with the original mabushii
motors<00:03:45.880> off<00:03:46.120> to<00:03:46.419> trim<00:03:46.720> those<00:03:46.900> off<00:03:47.169> but<00:03:47.500> the

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
motors off to trim those off but the

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.699 
motors off to trim those off but the
motor<00:03:48.310> mount<00:03:48.959> location<00:03:49.959> the<00:03:50.139> screw<00:03:50.500> holes

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
motor mount location the screw holes

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.240 
motor mount location the screw holes
they're<00:03:51.370> perfect<00:03:52.139> so<00:03:53.139> I<00:03:53.169> believe<00:03:53.739> that<00:03:54.069> that's

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
they're perfect so I believe that that's

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.330 
they're perfect so I believe that that's
going<00:03:54.700> to<00:03:54.819> work<00:03:54.910> fine<00:03:56.010> aren't<00:03:57.010> going<00:03:57.190> to<00:03:57.250> be

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
going to work fine aren't going to be

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.879 
going to work fine aren't going to be
any<00:03:57.370> problems<00:03:58.950> so<00:04:01.079> this<00:04:02.079> one<00:04:02.319> I<00:04:02.349> haven't<00:04:02.709> taken

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:02.889 
any problems so this one I haven't taken

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:04.530 
any problems so this one I haven't taken
apart<00:04:03.310> yet<00:04:03.549> what<00:04:03.700> I<00:04:03.730> did<00:04:04.030> when<00:04:04.209> the<00:04:04.389> other

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
apart yet what I did when the other

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.460 
apart yet what I did when the other
motor<00:04:04.840> is<00:04:05.079> I<00:04:05.319> simply<00:04:06.160> took<00:04:06.750> vice<00:04:07.750> grips<00:04:08.230> and<00:04:08.440> I

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
motor is I simply took vice grips and I

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.559 
motor is I simply took vice grips and I
bent<00:04:08.769> the<00:04:08.829> shaft<00:04:09.190> back<00:04:09.489> and<00:04:09.760> forth<00:04:10.000> I'll<00:04:10.239> bust

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:10.569 
bent the shaft back and forth I'll bust

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:13.379 
bent the shaft back and forth I'll bust
it<00:04:10.780> off<00:04:11.040> and<00:04:12.040> then<00:04:12.280> I<00:04:12.459> just<00:04:12.699> took<00:04:12.970> the<00:04:13.180> motor

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:13.389 
it off and then I just took the motor

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:18.690 
it off and then I just took the motor
out<00:04:14.250> that's<00:04:15.250> how<00:04:15.370> I<00:04:15.489> did<00:04:16.000> this<00:04:16.209> one<00:04:17.579> so<00:04:18.579> I'm<00:04:18.669> not

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
out that's how I did this one so I'm not

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.509 
out that's how I did this one so I'm not
going<00:04:19.060> to<00:04:19.150> spend<00:04:20.079> a<00:04:20.169> lot<00:04:20.289> of<00:04:20.349> time<00:04:20.709> trying<00:04:21.039> to

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 
going to spend a lot of time trying to

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.920 
going to spend a lot of time trying to
that<00:04:21.849> pinion<00:04:23.310> they're<00:04:24.310> just<00:04:24.520> cheap<00:04:25.090> brass<00:04:25.449> I

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
that pinion they're just cheap brass I

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.629 
that pinion they're just cheap brass I
wanted<00:04:26.680> to<00:04:26.740> go<00:04:26.830> with<00:04:26.979> something<00:04:27.430> a<00:04:27.520> little

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 
wanted to go with something a little

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:35.149 
wanted to go with something a little
heavier<00:04:28.150> stuff<00:04:28.690> these<00:04:28.990> are<00:04:29.169> steel<00:04:29.530> pinions<00:04:30.099> so

00:04:35.149 --> 00:04:35.159 

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:38.420 

that's<00:04:36.159> first<00:04:36.580> things<00:04:36.849> first<00:04:36.940> motor<00:04:37.539> and

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
that's first things first motor and

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:42.839 
that's first things first motor and
gearbox<00:04:39.430> being<00:04:40.330> rebuilt<00:04:40.810> then<00:04:41.560> then<00:04:42.550> I'll<00:04:42.669> go

00:04:42.839 --> 00:04:42.849 
gearbox being rebuilt then then I'll go

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:45.420 
gearbox being rebuilt then then I'll go
to<00:04:42.909> the<00:04:43.090> steering<00:04:43.360> servo<00:04:43.690> after<00:04:44.199> that<00:04:44.400> but<00:04:45.400> I

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
to the steering servo after that but I

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.159 
to the steering servo after that but I
want<00:04:45.699> to<00:04:45.789> give<00:04:45.909> everybody<00:04:46.120> I'm<00:04:46.389> an<00:04:46.539> update<00:04:46.990> so
