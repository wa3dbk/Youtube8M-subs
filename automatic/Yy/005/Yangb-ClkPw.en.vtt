00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
I'm curious to find out if there's a

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.820 
I'm curious to find out if there's a
special<00:02:14.950> Swedish<00:02:15.490> ability<00:02:15.970> in<00:02:16.150> the<00:02:16.180> game<00:02:16.830> well

special Swedish ability in the game well

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.260 
special Swedish ability in the game well
we're<00:02:18.040> going<00:02:18.430> to<00:02:18.489> make<00:02:18.640> sure<00:02:18.790> that's<00:02:18.970> when<00:02:19.150> n

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
we're going to make sure that's when n

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.270 
we're going to make sure that's when n
is<00:02:19.330> even<00:02:19.480> more<00:02:19.720> neutral<00:02:20.170> or<00:02:20.380> we<00:02:20.950> couldn't<00:02:21.220> make

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
is even more neutral or we couldn't make

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.130 
is even more neutral or we couldn't make
them<00:02:21.430> overpowered<00:02:22.060> that's<00:02:22.390> what<00:02:22.750> everyone

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
them overpowered that's what everyone

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.339 
them overpowered that's what everyone
says<00:02:23.170> that<00:02:23.440> we<00:02:23.800> do<00:02:23.980> so<00:02:24.520> let's<00:02:25.060> make<00:02:25.270> a<00:02:25.349> bility

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:26.349 
says that we do so let's make a bility

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:29.220 
says that we do so let's make a bility
where<00:02:26.530> Sweden<00:02:27.130> wins<00:02:27.970> by<00:02:28.330> pressing<00:02:28.690> a<00:02:28.750> button<00:02:28.780> I

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
where Sweden wins by pressing a button I

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.800 
where Sweden wins by pressing a button I
think<00:02:29.620> I<00:02:29.739> think<00:02:29.980> the<00:02:30.100> ability<00:02:30.550> that<00:02:31.420> Sweden

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
think I think the ability that Sweden

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.330 
think I think the ability that Sweden
should<00:02:31.959> have<00:02:32.110> is<00:02:32.290> the<00:02:32.440> ability<00:02:32.500> to<00:02:33.010> sort<00:02:33.280> of

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
should have is the ability to sort of

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.180 
should have is the ability to sort of
appear<00:02:34.150> neutral<00:02:34.630> but<00:02:34.840> then<00:02:35.050> side<00:02:35.950> with

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
appear neutral but then side with

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.600 
appear neutral but then side with
whoever<00:02:36.550> is<00:02:36.670> more<00:02:37.600> powerful<00:02:37.840> at<00:02:38.230> the<00:02:38.260> time

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
whoever is more powerful at the time

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.460 
whoever is more powerful at the time
well<00:02:39.610> that<00:02:40.209> sounds<00:02:40.510> like<00:02:40.660> a<00:02:40.720> good<00:02:40.900> idea<00:02:41.050> it

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
well that sounds like a good idea it

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.330 
well that sounds like a good idea it
describes<00:02:41.890> Sweden<00:02:42.340> no<00:02:42.519> then<00:02:42.910> ran<00:02:43.480> forever<00:02:44.340> so

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
describes Sweden no then ran forever so

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.729 
describes Sweden no then ran forever so

that<00:03:01.450> is<00:03:02.970> small<00:03:03.970> enough<00:03:04.000> because<00:03:04.720> it's<00:03:04.870> so

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049 
that is small enough because it's so

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:07.199 
that is small enough because it's so
huge<00:03:05.350> but<00:03:05.860> it<00:03:05.950> will<00:03:06.010> have<00:03:06.190> Afrika<00:03:06.640> Korps<00:03:06.670> well

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
huge but it will have Afrika Korps well

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:08.850 
huge but it will have Afrika Korps well

dlcs for every sold copy of a game we
think<00:03:42.760> yes<00:03:43.510> people<00:03:44.049> want<00:03:44.380> DLC<00:03:45.100> and<00:03:45.310> then<00:03:46.269> if

you<00:03:46.780> play<00:03:46.959> a<00:03:46.989> game<00:03:47.079> for<00:03:47.290> a<00:03:47.530> long<00:03:47.650> time<00:03:47.920> you<00:03:48.190> want

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
you play a game for a long time you want

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.280 
you play a game for a long time you want
to<00:03:48.430> freshen<00:03:48.609> it<00:03:48.790> up<00:03:48.940> you've<00:03:49.750> paid<00:03:49.989> for<00:03:50.019> the

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
to freshen it up you've paid for the

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.710 
to freshen it up you've paid for the
full<00:03:50.500> game<00:03:50.680> so<00:03:51.070> it<00:03:51.609> makes<00:03:51.820> sense<00:03:51.940> to<00:03:52.239> if<00:03:52.600> you

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
full game so it makes sense to if you

full game so it makes sense to if you
enjoyed<00:03:53.049> it<00:03:53.079> why<00:03:53.950> not<00:03:54.130> get<00:03:54.280> a<00:03:54.340> little<00:03:54.670> bit<00:03:54.790> more

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
enjoyed it why not get a little bit more

convenient<00:04:21.970> at<00:04:22.360> all<00:04:22.539> times<00:04:22.870> we're<00:04:23.500> aiming<00:04:23.710> for

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:24.950 
convenient at all times we're aiming for

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.300 
convenient at all times we're aiming for
having<00:04:25.220> a<00:04:26.440> logical<00:04:27.440> hot<00:04:27.800> joinable

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.120 
having a logical hot joinable
multiplayer<00:04:29.300> game<00:04:29.780> like<00:04:30.050> when<00:04:30.290> if<00:04:30.650> you<00:04:30.920> drop

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
multiplayer game like when if you drop

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:32.920 
multiplayer game like when if you drop
out<00:04:31.310> because<00:04:31.580> sometimes<00:04:32.390> your<00:04:32.570> internet

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
out because sometimes your internet

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.020 
out because sometimes your internet
connection<00:04:33.070> drops<00:04:34.070> you<00:04:34.310> should<00:04:34.490> be<00:04:34.670> able<00:04:34.760> to

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
connection drops you should be able to

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:36.670 
connection drops you should be able to
get<00:04:35.450> back<00:04:35.630> into<00:04:35.840> the<00:04:36.050> game<00:04:36.200> without<00:04:36.410> the

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
get back into the game without the

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.530 
get back into the game without the
rehost<00:04:37.100> that's<00:04:37.700> one<00:04:37.910> of<00:04:38.000> the<00:04:38.060> things<00:04:38.120> we<00:04:38.420> aim

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:38.540 
rehost that's one of the things we aim

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:40.690 
rehost that's one of the things we aim
to<00:04:38.750> do<00:04:38.870> with<00:04:39.050> this<00:04:39.200> game<00:04:39.500> and<00:04:40.220> now<00:04:40.370> I'm<00:04:40.490> hoping

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:40.700 
to do with this game and now I'm hoping

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.220 
to do with this game and now I'm hoping
that<00:04:40.850> the<00:04:41.030> programmers<00:04:41.510> will<00:04:41.630> not<00:04:41.780> kill<00:04:42.050> me

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:42.230 
that the programmers will not kill me

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:46.060 
that the programmers will not kill me
because<00:04:42.380> I<00:04:42.590> promise<00:04:43.010> this<00:04:43.510> so<00:04:44.510> so<00:04:44.930> well<00:04:45.710> I<00:04:45.740> mean

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:47.570 
that means they have a little bit of

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:51.070 
that means they have a little bit of
extra<00:04:47.750> motivation<00:04:48.350> from<00:04:48.620> the<00:04:48.800> forums<00:04:49.480> yes<00:04:50.480> you

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:53.570 
better do this well actually going to

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:55.510 
better do this well actually going to
start<00:04:53.780> working<00:04:53.930> on<00:04:54.230> it<00:04:54.440> very<00:04:54.470> soon<00:04:54.830> but<00:04:55.040> it

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 
start working on it very soon but it

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.060 
start working on it very soon but it
should<00:04:55.910> be<00:04:56.030> no<00:04:56.180> problem<00:04:56.210> and<00:04:56.720> you're<00:04:57.710> aiming

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
should be no problem and you're aiming

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:01.810 
should be no problem and you're aiming
for<00:04:58.250> an<00:04:58.340> early<00:04:58.610> summer<00:04:58.880> release<00:04:59.210> yeah<00:04:59.960> its<00:05:00.820> q2

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820 
for an early summer release yeah its q2

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.810 
for an early summer release yeah its q2
probably<00:05:02.780> June<00:05:03.020> I'm<00:05:03.860> look<00:05:04.040> entirely<00:05:04.340> sure<00:05:04.640> it

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:04.820 
probably June I'm look entirely sure it

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.790 
probably June I'm look entirely sure it
depends<00:05:05.120> on<00:05:05.300> where<00:05:05.510> release<00:05:05.960> lots<00:05:06.230> it<00:05:06.410> will<00:05:06.590> be

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
depends on where release lots it will be

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.670 
depends on where release lots it will be
but<00:05:07.010> it<00:05:07.160> should<00:05:07.340> be<00:05:07.370> early<00:05:07.730> summer<00:05:07.940> and<00:05:08.680> that's

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 
but it should be early summer and that's

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.860 
but it should be early summer and that's
the<00:05:09.830> second<00:05:10.250> expansion<00:05:10.820> of<00:05:11.150> our<00:05:11.360> hearts<00:05:11.780> of

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:11.870 
the second expansion of our hearts of

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:14.740 
the second expansion of our hearts of
iron<00:05:11.960> 3<00:05:12.380> and<00:05:12.760> fans<00:05:13.760> can<00:05:13.970> expect<00:05:14.060> more<00:05:14.450> after

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.750 
iron 3 and fans can expect more after

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:18.730 
iron 3 and fans can expect more after
that<00:05:14.780> or<00:05:16.000> depends<00:05:17.000> on<00:05:17.150> we<00:05:17.510> have<00:05:17.660> a<00:05:17.740> expansion

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
that or depends on we have a expansion

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.620 
that or depends on we have a expansion
team<00:05:18.920> running<00:05:19.280> all<00:05:19.610> the<00:05:19.790> time<00:05:19.820> we<00:05:20.600> have

team running all the time we have

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:23.080 
team running all the time we have
multiple<00:05:21.350> titles<00:05:21.800> doing<00:05:22.220> but<00:05:22.610> the

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.090 
multiple titles doing but the

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:25.540 
multiple titles doing but the
probability<00:05:23.780> of<00:05:23.810> of<00:05:24.020> us<00:05:24.440> doing<00:05:24.800> more<00:05:25.130> on<00:05:25.370> our

probability of of us doing more on our
iron<00:05:26.000> is<00:05:27.160> quite<00:05:28.160> make<00:05:29.060> I<00:05:29.300> expect<00:05:29.900> we<00:05:30.530> think<00:05:30.830> if

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:31.100 
iron is quite make I expect we think if

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.970 
iron is quite make I expect we think if
the<00:05:31.460> fans<00:05:31.640> buy<00:05:31.910> them<00:05:32.150> we<00:05:32.570> will<00:05:32.690> make<00:05:33.080> them<00:05:33.290> do

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:33.980 
the fans buy them we will make them do

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:35.620 
the fans buy them we will make them do
you<00:05:34.040> think<00:05:34.310> that<00:05:34.430> you'll<00:05:34.580> revisit<00:05:34.820> Victoria

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:35.630 
you think that you'll revisit Victoria

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:39.340 
you think that you'll revisit Victoria
to<00:05:35.810> any<00:05:36.110> time<00:05:36.350> soon<00:05:36.940> I<00:05:37.940> think<00:05:38.930> it's<00:05:39.080> a<00:05:39.200> high

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:39.350 
to any time soon I think it's a high

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:41.380 
to any time soon I think it's a high
probability<00:05:39.590> that<00:05:40.160> we<00:05:40.460> will<00:05:40.610> make<00:05:40.640> an<00:05:40.970> victory

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:41.390
