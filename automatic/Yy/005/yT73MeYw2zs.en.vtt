up<00:02:23.069> some<00:02:23.280> of<00:02:23.310> my<00:02:23.430> own<00:02:23.730> collectors<00:02:24.180> I<00:02:24.390> wasn't

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
up some of my own collectors I wasn't

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.259 
up some of my own collectors I wasn't
actually<00:02:25.260> active<00:02:25.829> for<00:02:26.310> about<00:02:26.459> 12<00:02:26.819> hours<00:02:26.940> guys

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
actually active for about 12 hours guys

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:28.670 
actually active for about 12 hours guys
so<00:02:27.510> some<00:02:27.690> of<00:02:27.720> these<00:02:27.840> collectors<00:02:28.260> do<00:02:28.440> have<00:02:28.650> a

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
so some of these collectors do have a

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.990 
so some of these collectors do have a
bit<00:02:28.829> of<00:02:28.860> loot<00:02:29.129> inside<00:02:29.280> of<00:02:29.579> them<00:02:29.700> they're<00:02:29.849> only

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
like level 9 and 10 collectors so

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.890 
like level 9 and 10 collectors so
they're<00:02:32.370> not<00:02:32.459> that<00:02:32.610> good<00:02:32.819> to<00:02:32.879> be<00:02:33.090> fair<00:02:33.360> so<00:02:33.780> he

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
they're not that good to be fair so he

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.509 
they're not that good to be fair so he
hasn't<00:02:34.200> really<00:02:34.349> dropped<00:02:34.560> anything<00:02:34.799> else<00:02:35.129> yet

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
apart from a couple of troops maybe he's

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.259 
apart from a couple of troops maybe he's
going<00:02:37.409> for<00:02:37.590> the<00:02:37.650> 50%<00:02:38.340> which<00:02:38.489> is<00:02:38.640> why<00:02:38.760> spawning

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
going for the 50% which is why spawning

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:40.610 
going for the 50% which is why spawning
his<00:02:39.480> things<00:02:39.689> around<00:02:39.959> the<00:02:40.049> outside<00:02:40.379> that

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
his things around the outside that

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.619 
his things around the outside that
elixir<00:02:41.430> drill<00:02:41.670> there<00:02:41.819> has<00:02:42.030> quite<00:02:42.359> a<00:02:42.390> lot<00:02:42.569> of

elixir drill there has quite a lot of

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:44.330 
elixir drill there has quite a lot of
loot<00:02:42.870> in<00:02:42.900> it<00:02:43.109> as<00:02:43.230> well<00:02:43.440> I<00:02:43.470> didn't<00:02:43.859> just<00:02:44.040> noticed

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
loot in it as well I didn't just noticed

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.759 
loot in it as well I didn't just noticed
that<00:02:44.400> and<00:02:45.090> the<00:02:45.299> storage<00:02:45.840> itself<00:02:46.260> has<00:02:46.440> quite<00:02:46.739> a

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
that and the storage itself has quite a

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:48.080 
that and the storage itself has quite a
lot<00:02:46.920> of<00:02:47.010> loot<00:02:47.190> probably<00:02:47.489> about<00:02:47.609> thousand

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
lot of loot probably about thousand

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.300 
lot of loot probably about thousand
inside<00:02:48.389> of<00:02:48.540> the<00:02:48.599> d<00:02:48.750> storage<00:02:49.170> so<00:02:49.680> I<00:02:49.709> would<00:02:50.069> be

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
inside of the d storage so I would be

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:51.920 
inside of the d storage so I would be
surprised<00:02:50.909> if<00:02:51.090> he<00:02:51.150> didn't<00:02:51.389> actually<00:02:51.480> go<00:02:51.750> for

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
surprised if he didn't actually go for

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.180 
surprised if he didn't actually go for
it<00:02:51.989> he's<00:02:52.079> dropped<00:02:52.290> quite<00:02:52.500> a<00:02:52.530> few<00:02:52.769> troops<00:02:52.950> down

she<00:05:15.300> is<00:05:15.750> and<00:05:15.990> the<00:05:16.560> guys<00:05:16.740> actually<00:05:16.919> able<00:05:17.220> to<00:05:17.340> get

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
she is and the guys actually able to get

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.370 
she is and the guys actually able to get
right<00:05:17.699> into<00:05:17.880> the<00:05:18.060> center<00:05:18.330> of<00:05:18.389> my<00:05:18.599> dark<00:05:19.169> elixir

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.380 
right into the center of my dark elixir

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.830 
right into the center of my dark elixir
storage<00:05:19.650> area<00:05:20.250> and<00:05:20.460> in<00:05:20.940> fact<00:05:21.180> the<00:05:21.330> Queen<00:05:21.570> does

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 
storage area and in fact the Queen does

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.659 
storage area and in fact the Queen does
look<00:05:22.110> onto<00:05:22.380> the<00:05:22.500> townhall<00:05:22.919> at<00:05:23.099> a<00:05:23.130> later<00:05:23.400> point

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:23.669 
look onto the townhall at a later point

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:25.879 
look onto the townhall at a later point
but<00:05:24.330> it<00:05:24.449> doesn't<00:05:24.840> manage<00:05:25.050> to<00:05:25.080> take<00:05:25.349> it<00:05:25.470> out

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:25.889 
but it doesn't manage to take it out

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:27.890 
but it doesn't manage to take it out
I<00:05:25.919> think<00:05:26.849> they<00:05:26.970> end<00:05:27.120> the<00:05:27.240> game<00:05:27.449> a<00:05:27.479> little<00:05:27.690> bit

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
I think they end the game a little bit

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.629 
I think they end the game a little bit
early<00:05:28.229> just<00:05:28.800> because<00:05:29.039> they're<00:05:29.160> not<00:05:29.190> after<00:05:29.550> the

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:29.639 
early just because they're not after the

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:31.370 
early just because they're not after the
victory<00:05:29.940> but<00:05:30.210> that<00:05:30.389> means<00:05:30.570> the<00:05:30.780> base<00:05:30.960> is<00:05:31.169> still

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:31.380 
victory but that means the base is still

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:33.379 
victory but that means the base is still
on<00:05:31.530> the<00:05:31.650> feared<00:05:32.010> guys<00:05:32.220> so<00:05:32.789> no<00:05:33.030> one<00:05:33.210> has

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:33.389 
on the feared guys so no one has

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:35.990 
on the feared guys so no one has
actually<00:05:33.599> used<00:05:34.050> the<00:05:34.260> value<00:05:34.530> of<00:05:34.620> death<00:05:34.860> in<00:05:35.130> any

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 
actually used the value of death in any

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.339 
actually used the value of death in any
of<00:05:36.180> the<00:05:36.270> replays<00:05:36.630> that<00:05:36.810> I've<00:05:36.900> been<00:05:37.050> able<00:05:37.169> to

00:05:37.339 --> 00:05:37.349 
of the replays that I've been able to

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:39.850 
of the replays that I've been able to
show<00:05:37.650> because<00:05:37.919> the<00:05:38.159> the<00:05:38.490> traps<00:05:38.789> were<00:05:39.060> already

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:39.860 
show because the the traps were already

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:42.260 
show because the the traps were already
activated<00:05:40.860> previously<00:05:41.610> as<00:05:41.729> I<00:05:41.820> said<00:05:42.030> I<00:05:42.060> was

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 
activated previously as I said I was

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:43.670 
activated previously as I said I was
literally<00:05:42.539> out<00:05:42.720> the<00:05:42.840> game<00:05:42.990> for<00:05:43.199> about<00:05:43.289> 12

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 
literally out the game for about 12

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.680 
literally out the game for about 12
hours<00:05:43.860> and<00:05:44.099> eight<00:05:44.699> people<00:05:44.940> attacked<00:05:45.419> me<00:05:45.570> in

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:45.690 
hours and eight people attacked me in

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:47.810 
hours and eight people attacked me in
that<00:05:45.810> amount<00:05:46.020> of<00:05:46.139> time<00:05:46.430> Queens<00:05:47.430> now<00:05:47.610> locked

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:47.820 
that amount of time Queens now locked

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:49.370 
that amount of time Queens now locked
onto<00:05:48.000> the<00:05:48.180> tunnel<00:05:48.539> even<00:05:48.840> if<00:05:48.900> they<00:05:49.020> didn't<00:05:49.229> end

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:49.380 
onto the tunnel even if they didn't end

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:50.990 
onto the tunnel even if they didn't end
it<00:05:49.500> here<00:05:49.710> she<00:05:50.310> still<00:05:50.490> would<00:05:50.639> have<00:05:50.669> been<00:05:50.880> able

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.000 
it here she still would have been able

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.670 
it here she still would have been able
