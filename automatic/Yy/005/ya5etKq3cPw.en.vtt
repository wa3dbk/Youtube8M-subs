00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
think I'm wear them I guess now we know

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.090 
think I'm wear them I guess now we know
where<00:03:14.540> Assassin's<00:03:15.110> Creed<00:03:15.380> got<00:03:15.650> there<00:03:15.830> a<00:03:15.860> day

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
where Assassin's Creed got there a day

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:21.870

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
I guess Assassin's Creed should be

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:30.540
