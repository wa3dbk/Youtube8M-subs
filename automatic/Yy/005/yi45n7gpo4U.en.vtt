00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:24.410 
have the cpu 350 now it may seem like

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.310 
have the cpu 350 now it may seem like
it's<00:00:24.619> not<00:00:25.099> much<00:00:25.310> of<00:00:25.340> an<00:00:25.610> upgrade<00:00:25.869> but<00:00:26.869> I<00:00:26.900> needed

another<00:00:27.380> water<00:00:27.859> block<00:00:28.130> anyways<00:00:28.519> because<00:00:28.670> I'm

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:28.849 
another water block anyways because I'm

another water block anyways because I'm
think<00:00:29.089> I'm<00:00:29.240> changing<00:00:29.720> the<00:00:30.170> water<00:00:30.349> block<00:00:30.650> out

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:30.830 
think I'm changing the water block out

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.150 
think I'm changing the water block out
of<00:00:30.949> my<00:00:31.039> son's<00:00:31.310> computer<00:00:31.629> so<00:00:32.629> I<00:00:33.290> read<00:00:33.890> some

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160

reviews on the 360 and it does look like

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.670 
reviews on the 360 and it does look like
it's<00:00:37.510> significantly<00:00:38.510> better<00:00:38.720> than<00:00:38.839> the<00:00:39.019> 350

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.680 
it's significantly better than the 350

cool ants I think is unmatched when it
comes<00:01:45.320> to<00:01:45.909> machining<00:01:46.909> I<00:01:47.440> don't<00:01:48.440> know<00:01:48.530> if<00:01:48.620> they

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
comes to machining I don't know if they

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.680 
comes to machining I don't know if they
have<00:01:48.950> their<00:01:49.159> own<00:01:49.190> facility<00:01:49.909> or<00:01:50.150> they<00:01:50.270> send<00:01:50.570> it

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
have their own facility or they send it

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.890 
have their own facility or they send it
out<00:01:50.920> but<00:01:51.920> I'm<00:01:52.070> telling<00:01:52.460> you<00:01:52.610> this<00:01:53.570> thing<00:01:53.630> is

heavy too it's not like by any means and

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.730 
heavy too it's not like by any means and
take<00:02:00.979> it<00:02:01.130> out<00:02:01.220> of<00:02:01.280> plastic<00:02:01.820> and<00:02:02.350> it<00:02:03.350> comes<00:02:03.620> with

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
take it out of plastic and it comes with

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.600 
take it out of plastic and it comes with
a<00:02:04.010> cover<00:02:04.340> on<00:02:05.140> the<00:02:06.140> plate<00:02:06.890> for<00:02:07.159> the<00:02:07.250> back<00:02:07.400> foot

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
a cover on the plate for the back foot

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
accidentally touching it and then not

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.420 
accidentally touching it and then not
being<00:02:11.209> able<00:02:11.360> to<00:02:11.720> get<00:02:12.590> your<00:02:12.799> fingerprints<00:02:13.190> off

you can see a little plate there so it

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.229 
you can see a little plate there so it
comes<00:02:15.470> already<00:02:15.709> on<00:02:15.920> there<00:02:16.159> but<00:02:16.909> look<00:02:17.060> at<00:02:17.150> that

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
comes already on there but look at that

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:18.160 
comes already on there but look at that
I'm<00:02:17.299> going<00:02:17.390> to<00:02:17.450> see<00:02:17.569> if<00:02:17.599> I<00:02:17.719> can<00:02:17.840> get<00:02:17.959> you<00:02:18.139> a

it's easy to read it's easy to
understand<00:02:48.209> a<00:02:49.130> caveman<00:02:50.130> could<00:02:50.489> do<00:02:50.610> it<00:02:50.730> I<00:02:50.790> guess

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
understand a caveman could do it I guess

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.340 
understand a caveman could do it I guess
you<00:02:51.150> could<00:02:51.300> say<00:02:52.849> and<00:02:53.849> then<00:02:54.000> you<00:02:54.090> have<00:02:54.269> a<00:02:54.720> rubber

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
you could say and then you have a rubber

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.410 
you could say and then you have a rubber
piece<00:02:55.739> that<00:02:55.980> goes<00:02:56.010> between<00:02:56.310> the<00:02:56.880> deck<00:02:57.180> of<00:02:57.209> the

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
piece that goes between the deck of the

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.740 
piece that goes between the deck of the
back<00:02:57.660> plate<00:02:57.989> and<00:02:58.260> the<00:02:59.120> cpu<00:03:00.120> water<00:03:00.330> block<00:03:00.600> on

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
back plate and the cpu water block on

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.410 
back plate and the cpu water block on
the<00:03:00.840> front<00:03:01.110> then<00:03:01.650> you<00:03:01.799> have<00:03:02.010> for<00:03:02.340> AMD<00:03:02.850> sockets

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
the front then you have for AMD sockets

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:04.640 
the front then you have for AMD sockets
which<00:03:03.600> I<00:03:03.780> don't<00:03:03.959> know<00:03:04.019> why<00:03:04.110> anyone<00:03:04.260> would<00:03:04.470> want

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
which I don't know why anyone would want

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.620 
which I don't know why anyone would want
those<00:03:05.390> and<00:03:06.390> this<00:03:07.170> is<00:03:07.350> for<00:03:07.500> the<00:03:07.560> AMD<00:03:08.540> and<00:03:09.540> then

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
those and this is for the AMD and then

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.240 
those and this is for the AMD and then
you<00:03:09.720> have<00:03:09.870> one<00:03:10.110> for<00:03:10.410> it<00:03:10.530> it's<00:03:11.040> for<00:03:11.280> LGA<00:03:12.209> 775

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
you have one for it it's for LGA 775

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:18.170 
you have one for it it's for LGA 775
1156<00:03:14.250> and<00:03:14.780> 1366<00:03:15.780> so<00:03:16.410> basically<00:03:16.910> it'll<00:03:17.910> fit

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
1156 and 1366 so basically it'll fit

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.570 
1156 and 1366 so basically it'll fit
anything<00:03:18.510> and<00:03:19.049> you<00:03:19.440> get<00:03:19.590> all<00:03:19.830> the<00:03:20.010> accessories

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
anything and you get all the accessories

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.009 
anything and you get all the accessories
it's<00:03:20.760> not<00:03:20.880> like<00:03:21.060> some<00:03:21.360> companies<00:03:21.810> where<00:03:21.989> you

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
it's not like some companies where you

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:24.530 
it's not like some companies where you
buy<00:03:22.340> their<00:03:23.340> water<00:03:23.819> block<00:03:24.060> and<00:03:24.239> gotta<00:03:24.390> buy

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
buy their water block and gotta buy

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.330 
buy their water block and gotta buy
adapters<00:03:25.110> I<00:03:27.560> mean<00:03:28.560> what<00:03:28.709> can<00:03:28.829> you<00:03:28.890> say<00:03:29.100> I<00:03:29.130> think

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
adapters I mean what can you say I think

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.300 
adapters I mean what can you say I think
this<00:03:29.579> is<00:03:29.760> just<00:03:30.150> one<00:03:30.630> heck<00:03:30.870> of<00:03:31.019> a<00:03:31.310> the

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
this is just one heck of a the

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.400 
this is just one heck of a the
waterblock<00:03:32.730> what<00:03:33.660> I'm<00:03:33.750> going<00:03:33.870> to<00:03:33.900> do<00:03:34.079> is<00:03:34.290> I'm

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
waterblock what I'm going to do is I'm

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.020 
waterblock what I'm going to do is I'm
going<00:03:34.530> to<00:03:34.590> taking<00:03:35.400> temperatures<00:03:35.820> right<00:03:36.000> now

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
going to taking temperatures right now

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.110 
going to taking temperatures right now
my<00:03:36.390> cpu<00:03:37.200> 350<00:03:37.950> and<00:03:38.190> then<00:03:38.700> I'm<00:03:38.790> going<00:03:38.910> to<00:03:38.940> take

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
my cpu 350 and then I'm going to take

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.030 
my cpu 350 and then I'm going to take
temperatures<00:03:39.840> using<00:03:40.200> this<00:03:40.470> and<00:03:40.709> see<00:03:40.859> if<00:03:40.890> I

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
temperatures using this and see if I

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.069 
temperatures using this and see if I
actually<00:03:41.130> get<00:03:41.400> anything<00:03:41.640> from<00:03:41.970> it<00:03:42.030> ok<00:03:42.989> I'm

my<00:03:46.859> current<00:03:47.329> cpu<00:03:48.329> 350<00:03:49.370> so

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
my current cpu 350 so

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:56.050 
my current cpu 350 so
there<00:03:51.530> it<00:03:51.650> is<00:03:51.739> in<00:03:52.010> there<00:03:54.430> my<00:03:55.430> computer's<00:03:55.909> been

00:04:06.429 --> 00:04:06.439 
look an hour and 41 minutes so the cpu

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:11.470 
look an hour and 41 minutes so the cpu
is<00:04:06.650> idling<00:04:06.950> at<00:04:07.430> pacifica<00:04:08.030> CA<00:04:08.060> 42<00:04:09.049> c<00:04:10.299> which<00:04:11.299> that

really<00:04:17.810> warm<00:04:18.139> this<00:04:18.410> room<00:04:18.739> though<00:04:18.919> again<00:04:19.370> I<00:04:19.459> got

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609 
really warm this room though again I got

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:22.230 
really warm this room though again I got
two<00:04:19.789> computers<00:04:20.269> and<00:04:20.419> all<00:04:20.479> kinds<00:04:20.810> of<00:04:20.870> lights<00:04:21.079> on

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
two computers and all kinds of lights on

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.170 
two computers and all kinds of lights on
we<00:04:23.240> are<00:04:23.360> clocked<00:04:23.780> there's<00:04:24.530> my<00:04:24.800> 980x<00:04:25.580> we<00:04:26.060> are

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
we are clocked there's my 980x we are

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:33.129 
we are clocked there's my 980x we are
clocked<00:04:26.539> at<00:04:29.349> 4.4<00:04:30.349> gigahertz<00:04:30.650> basically<00:04:31.430> and<00:04:32.139> i

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:33.139 
clocked at 4.4 gigahertz basically and i

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:35.620 
clocked at 4.4 gigahertz basically and i
have<00:04:33.349> it<00:04:33.590> i<00:04:33.620> think<00:04:34.160> it's<00:04:34.310> 1<00:04:34.550> point<00:04:34.849> 4<00:04:35.599> volts

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
have it i think it's 1 point 4 volts

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.040 
have it i think it's 1 point 4 volts
maybe<00:04:36.349> and<00:04:37.250> it's<00:04:37.340> showing<00:04:37.520> up<00:04:37.759> at<00:04:37.910> 1.39<00:04:38.599> too

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
maybe and it's showing up at 1.39 too

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:41.650 
maybe and it's showing up at 1.39 too
I'm<00:04:39.860> get<00:04:40.099> a<00:04:40.130> little<00:04:40.220> bit<00:04:40.610> lower<00:04:41.090> on<00:04:41.240> it<00:04:41.479> but<00:04:41.599> I

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
I'm get a little bit lower on it but I

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.450 
I'm get a little bit lower on it but I
keep<00:04:41.840> it<00:04:42.050> one<00:04:42.259> point<00:04:42.500> 4<00:04:42.710> volts<00:04:42.740> and<00:04:43.130> I<00:04:43.190> want<00:04:43.400> to

keep it one point 4 volts and I want to

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.240 
keep it one point 4 volts and I want to
go<00:04:43.580> up<00:04:43.669> some<00:04:44.539> what<00:04:45.320> I'm<00:04:45.440> going<00:04:45.560> to<00:04:45.590> do<00:04:45.770> now<00:04:45.979> is

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.220 

probably<00:05:08.480> what<00:05:08.570> I'm<00:05:08.660> going<00:05:08.810> to<00:05:08.840> do<00:05:08.930> is<00:05:09.110> I'm

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:09.230 
probably what I'm going to do is I'm

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:12.070 
probably what I'm going to do is I'm
just<00:05:09.260> going<00:05:09.440> to<00:05:09.560> run<00:05:09.740> it<00:05:09.860> for<00:05:10.070> say<00:05:10.750> one<00:05:11.750> minute

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
just going to run it for say one minute

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.580 
just going to run it for say one minute
and<00:05:12.260> then<00:05:13.010> we'll<00:05:13.070> check<00:05:13.490> on<00:05:13.730> there<00:05:13.970> and<00:05:14.120> see

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:14.590 
and then we'll check on there and see

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:21.900 
and then we'll check on there and see
what<00:05:15.590> the<00:05:15.680> temperature<00:05:16.070> is

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:21.910 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:30.730 

there's<00:05:22.510> what<00:05:22.870> a<00:05:24.180> portent<00:05:25.180> beta<00:05:25.420> showing

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:39.870 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:41.990 

let's<00:05:40.260> go<00:05:40.380> ahead<00:05:40.470> and<00:05:40.590> look<00:05:40.740> temperature<00:05:41.310> I'm

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.000 
let's go ahead and look temperature I'm

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.030 
let's go ahead and look temperature I'm
not<00:05:42.180> going<00:05:42.450> to<00:05:42.510> use<00:05:42.690> the<00:05:42.930> reading<00:05:43.260> from<00:05:43.500> core

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:44.040 
not going to use the reading from core

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:48.830 
not going to use the reading from core
temp<00:05:44.310> data<00:05:45.290> because<00:05:47.150> it<00:05:48.150> could<00:05:48.330> be<00:05:48.420> hard<00:05:48.660> for

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:48.840 
temp data because it could be hard for

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.300 
temp data because it could be hard for
me<00:05:48.870> to<00:05:48.960> decipher<00:05:49.530> what<00:05:49.710> the<00:05:49.800> heck<00:05:49.920> it<00:05:50.040> same<00:05:50.280> as

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:50.310 
me to decipher what the heck it same as

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:52.880 
me to decipher what the heck it same as
so<00:05:50.640> many<00:05:50.760> figures<00:05:51.330> on<00:05:51.660> there<00:05:51.930> so<00:05:52.680> what<00:05:52.800> I'm

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:52.890 
so many figures on there so what I'm

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:53.810 
so many figures on there so what I'm
going<00:05:52.980> to<00:05:53.040> do<00:05:53.130> is<00:05:53.220> I'm<00:05:53.340> just<00:05:53.370> going<00:05:53.520> to<00:05:53.700> take

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:53.820 
going to do is I'm just going to take

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:55.040 
going to do is I'm just going to take
the<00:05:53.970> reading<00:05:54.240> from<00:05:54.360> the<00:05:54.480> motherboard<00:05:54.900> I

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.050 
the reading from the motherboard I

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:57.040 
the reading from the motherboard I
figure<00:05:55.380> if<00:05:55.500> I<00:05:55.590> go<00:05:55.770> ahead<00:05:56.010> run<00:05:56.250> this<00:05:56.400> benchmark

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:57.050 
figure if I go ahead run this benchmark

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:59.930 
figure if I go ahead run this benchmark
and<00:05:58.050> take<00:05:58.650> the<00:05:58.770> reading<00:05:59.070> from<00:05:59.190> the<00:05:59.310> same<00:05:59.490> spot

00:05:59.930 --> 00:05:59.940 
and take the reading from the same spot

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:05.240 
and take the reading from the same spot
and<00:06:00.530> I<00:06:01.530> can<00:06:01.740> compare<00:06:02.130> the<00:06:02.250> results<00:06:04.190> kind<00:06:05.190> of

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:05.250 
and I can compare the results kind of

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:08.510 
and I can compare the results kind of

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:47.030 
my colon is now at 34 c yeah I've been

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:49.900 
my colon is now at 34 c yeah I've been
running<00:06:47.210> a<00:06:47.360> minute<00:06:47.419> 45<00:06:47.960> seconds<00:06:48.680> go<00:06:49.250> ahead<00:06:49.699> and

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:49.910 
running a minute 45 seconds go ahead and

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:55.719 
running a minute 45 seconds go ahead and
let<00:06:50.300> it<00:06:50.330> run<00:06:50.539> the<00:06:51.910> two<00:06:52.910> minutes<00:06:53.210> I<00:06:53.300> guess<00:06:54.729> okay

00:06:55.719 --> 00:06:55.729 
let it run the two minutes I guess okay

00:06:55.729 --> 00:06:57.189 
let it run the two minutes I guess okay
we're<00:06:55.910> coming<00:06:56.060> up<00:06:56.300> on<00:06:56.449> three<00:06:56.780> minutes<00:06:56.870> I

00:06:57.189 --> 00:06:57.199 
we're coming up on three minutes I

00:06:57.199 --> 00:07:00.189 
we're coming up on three minutes I
decided<00:06:57.530> to<00:06:57.620> do<00:06:57.710> it<00:06:57.830> for<00:06:57.949> three<00:06:58.220> minutes<00:06:59.199> you

00:07:00.189 --> 00:07:00.199 
decided to do it for three minutes you

00:07:00.199 --> 00:07:01.659 
decided to do it for three minutes you
think<00:07:00.440> I'd<00:07:00.530> I<00:07:00.560> had<00:07:00.740> it<00:07:00.860> figured<00:07:01.039> out<00:07:01.250> before<00:07:01.639> i

00:07:01.659 --> 00:07:01.669 
think I'd I had it figured out before i

00:07:01.669 --> 00:07:06.850 
think I'd I had it figured out before i
started<00:07:02.120> the<00:07:02.210> video<00:07:02.479> so<00:07:03.289> here<00:07:03.319> we<00:07:03.590> go<00:07:04.240> 56<00:07:05.240> 57<00:07:05.870> 58

and<00:07:37.200> we'll<00:07:37.740> go<00:07:37.890> ahead<00:07:38.010> and<00:07:38.400> see<00:07:38.580> if<00:07:38.640> we<00:07:38.730> can

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:38.880 
and we'll go ahead and see if we can

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:42.050
