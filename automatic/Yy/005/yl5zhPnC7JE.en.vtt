nice thing to have to because I have

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.290 
nice thing to have to because I have
forty-nine<00:00:40.559> percent<00:00:40.739> crit<00:00:41.219> chance<00:00:41.250> so<00:00:42.149> it's

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
forty-nine percent crit chance so it's

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.200 
forty-nine percent crit chance so it's
