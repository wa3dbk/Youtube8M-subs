00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.700 

the<00:00:04.240> the<00:00:05.240> course<00:00:05.450> is<00:00:05.630> obviously<00:00:05.899> a<00:00:05.960> 60k<00:00:06.439> course

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:06.710 
the the course is obviously a 60k course

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.660 
the the course is obviously a 60k course
because<00:00:06.920> there's<00:00:07.100> three<00:00:07.310> lips<00:00:07.780> and<00:00:08.980> the<00:00:09.980> the

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:10.670 
because there's three lips and the the

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:11.980 
because there's three lips and the the
only<00:00:10.850> change<00:00:11.209> I<00:00:11.299> think<00:00:11.360> this<00:00:11.539> year<00:00:11.750> is<00:00:11.840> that

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:11.990 
only change I think this year is that

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:13.299 
only change I think this year is that
they're<00:00:12.110> going<00:00:12.230> to<00:00:12.289> be<00:00:12.440> riding<00:00:12.860> in<00:00:13.070> and<00:00:13.219> out

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:13.309 
they're going to be riding in and out

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:16.029 
they're going to be riding in and out
through<00:00:13.580> town<00:00:13.789> or<00:00:14.779> turning<00:00:15.469> around<00:00:15.529> in<00:00:15.830> town

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:16.039 
through town or turning around in town

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:21.310 
through town or turning around in town
so<00:00:16.250> I<00:00:16.279> think<00:00:16.460> there's<00:00:16.640> a<00:00:19.870> town<00:00:20.870> might<00:00:21.050> be<00:00:21.140> more

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.320 
so I think there's a town might be more

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.870 
so I think there's a town might be more
involved<00:00:21.560> I<00:00:22.040> haven't<00:00:22.370> actually<00:00:22.460> seen<00:00:22.640> that

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:22.880 
involved I haven't actually seen that

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.130 
involved I haven't actually seen that
mind<00:00:23.270> you<00:00:23.360> sure<00:00:23.510> of<00:00:23.600> the<00:00:23.690> course<00:00:24.460> in<00:00:25.460> any<00:00:25.610> case

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:26.140 
mind you sure of the course in any case

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.290 
mind you sure of the course in any case
it's<00:00:27.140> actually<00:00:27.440> not<00:00:27.620> dissimilar<00:00:28.039> to<00:00:28.300> the

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.300 
it's actually not dissimilar to the

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.690 
it's actually not dissimilar to the
foster<00:00:29.539> course<00:00:29.930> in<00:00:30.170> terms<00:00:30.380> of<00:00:30.619> the<00:00:31.070> Becky

Boulevard<00:00:34.160> then<00:00:34.730> it's<00:00:34.940> not<00:00:35.150> dissimilar<00:00:35.450> to

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:35.750

Boulevard then it's not dissimilar to
that<00:00:35.870> again<00:00:36.290> so<00:00:37.280> the<00:00:37.910> very<00:00:38.180> first<00:00:39.550> what's

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
that again so the very first what's

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.850 
that again so the very first what's
called<00:00:40.790> eight<00:00:41.060> kilometers<00:00:41.690> of<00:00:41.810> the<00:00:41.899> course<00:00:42.140> is

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860 
called eight kilometers of the course is

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.889 
called eight kilometers of the course is
almost<00:00:43.460> like<00:00:43.700> riding<00:00:43.850> on<00:00:44.000> cue<00:00:44.239> ball<00:00:44.390> about<00:00:44.630> so

00:00:44.889 --> 00:00:44.899 
almost like riding on cue ball about so

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:49.360 
almost like riding on cue ball about so
it's<00:00:45.640> there<00:00:46.640> rollers<00:00:47.090> rather<00:00:47.690> than<00:00:48.370> actually

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
it's there rollers rather than actually

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.610 
it's there rollers rather than actually
being<00:00:49.600> the<00:00:50.600> vast<00:00:50.809> majority<00:00:51.260> of<00:00:51.290> rollers

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
being the vast majority of rollers

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.190 
being the vast majority of rollers
anyway<00:00:52.010> so<00:00:52.070> the<00:00:52.730> sort<00:00:52.940> of<00:00:53.000> climb<00:00:53.239> where<00:00:53.600> you

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:54.200 
anyway so the sort of climb where you

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.530 
anyway so the sort of climb where you
can<00:00:54.350> get<00:00:54.530> out<00:00:54.739> of<00:00:54.770> the<00:00:54.920> saddle<00:00:55.130> and<00:00:55.460> still<00:00:56.030> sort

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:56.540 
can get out of the saddle and still sort

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.260 
can get out of the saddle and still sort
of<00:00:56.600> strength<00:00:56.899> over<00:00:57.260> it<00:00:57.320> I<00:00:57.920> would<00:00:58.850> recommend

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
of strength over it I would recommend

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.209 
of strength over it I would recommend
highly<00:00:59.630> that<00:00:59.809> for<00:01:00.230> all<00:01:00.380> the<00:01:00.530> climbs<00:01:00.829> in<00:01:01.129> the

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:01.219 
highly that for all the climbs in the

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:03.040 
highly that for all the climbs in the
very<00:01:01.460> first<00:01:01.730> lap<00:01:02.000> that<00:01:02.540> you<00:01:02.660> sit<00:01:02.870> in<00:01:02.960> the

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.050 
very first lap that you sit in the

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:04.959 
very first lap that you sit in the
saddle<00:01:03.230> and<00:01:03.530> you<00:01:03.770> drop<00:01:04.070> it<00:01:04.100> into<00:01:04.309> a<00:01:04.369> small<00:01:04.729> gear

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:04.969 
saddle and you drop it into a small gear

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:06.910 
saddle and you drop it into a small gear
and<00:01:05.210> try<00:01:05.780> and<00:01:05.930> ride<00:01:06.110> at<00:01:06.259> 100<00:01:06.560> ribs

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
and try and ride at 100 ribs

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.580 
and try and ride at 100 ribs
I<00:01:07.039> think<00:01:07.969> athletes<00:01:08.780> get<00:01:08.990> any<00:01:09.109> other<00:01:09.170> settled

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
I think athletes get any other settled

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.639 
I think athletes get any other settled
so<00:01:09.829> well<00:01:10.039> it<00:01:10.219> just<00:01:10.429> rips<00:01:11.299> a<00:01:11.420> lot<00:01:11.659> of<00:01:11.780> oxygen<00:01:12.259> and

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:12.649 
so well it just rips a lot of oxygen and

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:14.830 
so well it just rips a lot of oxygen and
glycogen<00:01:13.009> from<00:01:13.249> your<00:01:13.429> legs<00:01:13.689> you<00:01:14.689> should

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
glycogen from your legs you should

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.120 
glycogen from your legs you should
always<00:01:15.109> in<00:01:15.590> a<00:01:15.649> race

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
always in a race

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.709 
always in a race
the<00:01:17.649> the<00:01:18.649> seeing<00:01:19.429> in<00:01:19.520> the<00:01:19.579> saddle<00:01:19.909> for<00:01:20.029> for<00:01:20.659> the

00:01:20.709 --> 00:01:20.719 
the the seeing in the saddle for for the

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:22.929 
the the seeing in the saddle for for the
climbs<00:01:20.990> if<00:01:21.200> you<00:01:21.289> can<00:01:21.579> there's<00:01:22.579> a<00:01:22.639> certain

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:22.939 
climbs if you can there's a certain

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:24.429 
climbs if you can there's a certain
amount<00:01:23.029> of<00:01:23.149> stretching<00:01:23.420> you<00:01:23.659> need<00:01:23.869> to<00:01:24.049> do<00:01:24.170> to

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:24.439 
amount of stretching you need to do to

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:26.469 
amount of stretching you need to do to
give<00:01:25.009> you<00:01:25.100> back<00:01:25.279> a<00:01:25.310> rest<00:01:25.670> but<00:01:26.270> for<00:01:26.420> the

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
give you back a rest but for the

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:27.910 
give you back a rest but for the
majority<00:01:26.810> of<00:01:26.990> time<00:01:27.229> you<00:01:27.409> should<00:01:27.560> be<00:01:27.590> doing<00:01:27.859> a

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
majority of time you should be doing a

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.529 
majority of time you should be doing a
hundred<00:01:28.069> reps<00:01:28.399> just<00:01:28.729> taking<00:01:29.060> your<00:01:29.179> legs<00:01:29.329> over

00:01:29.529 --> 00:01:29.539 
hundred reps just taking your legs over

hundred reps just taking your legs over
not<00:01:30.350> mashing<00:01:30.770> a<00:01:30.829> bit<00:01:31.009> gear<00:01:31.219> you'll<00:01:31.459> see<00:01:31.639> lots

00:01:31.839 --> 00:01:31.849 
not mashing a bit gear you'll see lots

00:01:31.849 --> 00:01:32.980 
not mashing a bit gear you'll see lots

the first six to eight K quietly then

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.209 
the first six to eight K quietly then
comes<00:01:47.389> into<00:01:47.599> a<00:01:47.630> nice<00:01:47.869> flat<00:01:48.409> section<00:01:48.889> for

comes into a nice flat section for

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:53.500 
comes into a nice flat section for
probably<00:01:49.819> fifteen<00:01:50.749> to<00:01:50.869> twenty<00:01:51.109> K

after the turn around already probably
10k<00:01:56.730> and<00:01:57.600> then<00:01:57.900> there's<00:01:58.380> some<00:01:58.530> more<00:01:58.740> rollers

light<00:02:05.060> cattle<00:02:06.060> I<00:02:06.090> think<00:02:06.390> they<00:02:06.510> say<00:02:06.720> it<00:02:07.650> wants

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:07.980 
light cattle I think they say it wants

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:12.710 
light cattle I think they say it wants
to<00:02:08.070> say<00:02:08.220> Kathy<00:02:11.120> when<00:02:12.120> you<00:02:12.180> turn<00:02:12.330> off<00:02:12.420> onto<00:02:12.570> that

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
to say Kathy when you turn off onto that

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.170 
to say Kathy when you turn off onto that
road<00:02:12.960> it's<00:02:13.380> actually<00:02:13.800> it's<00:02:14.250> more<00:02:14.580> rollers

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
road it's actually it's more rollers

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.330 
road it's actually it's more rollers
than<00:02:15.570> the<00:02:15.660> first<00:02:15.870> section<00:02:16.260> so<00:02:16.470> there's<00:02:17.010> not<00:02:17.160> so

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
than the first section so there's not so

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.150 
than the first section so there's not so
many<00:02:17.400> pinches<00:02:18.110> but<00:02:19.110> again<00:02:19.410> stay<00:02:19.980> in<00:02:20.010> the

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
many pinches but again stay in the

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.310 
many pinches but again stay in the
saddle<00:02:20.460> and<00:02:20.610> just<00:02:21.090> tick<00:02:21.240> away<00:02:21.330> it's<00:02:21.720> really

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
saddle and just tick away it's really

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.530 
saddle and just tick away it's really
crucial<00:02:22.730> and<00:02:23.730> all<00:02:23.850> obviously<00:02:24.240> once<00:02:24.390> you've

seen the first 30k you know the course

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.950 
seen the first 30k you know the course
the<00:02:29.550> probably<00:02:30.030> the<00:02:30.090> most<00:02:30.150> important<00:02:30.870> thing

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
the probably the most important thing

out of the saddle if you're worried
about<00:02:49.920> it<00:02:50.100> take<00:02:50.430> a<00:02:50.459> 25<00:02:51.090> or<00:02:51.420> 27<00:02:51.900> you're<00:02:52.680> much

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
about it take a 25 or 27 you're much

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.320 
about it take a 25 or 27 you're much
better<00:02:53.220> off<00:02:53.280> bound<00:02:53.610> to<00:02:53.760> get<00:02:53.850> up<00:02:53.970> there<00:02:54.120> there's

better off bound to get up there there's

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:55.640 
better off bound to get up there there's
people<00:02:54.510> who<00:02:54.690> end<00:02:54.810> up<00:02:54.870> walking<00:02:55.110> up<00:02:55.320> the<00:02:55.440> hill

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
people who end up walking up the hill

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.590 
people who end up walking up the hill
and<00:02:55.860> sister<00:02:56.430> disaster<00:02:57.030> getting<00:02:57.300> off<00:02:57.420> and

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
walking up a hill in your cleats will

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.430 
walking up a hill in your cleats will
try<00:03:00.150> and<00:03:00.239> run<00:03:00.390> up<00:03:00.480> the<00:03:00.510> hill<00:03:00.600> because<00:03:01.200> it's

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
try and run up the hill because it's

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.170 
try and run up the hill because it's
even<00:03:01.680> hard<00:03:01.860> to<00:03:01.920> run<00:03:02.100> up<00:03:02.220> and<00:03:02.340> cleats<00:03:02.670> but<00:03:03.060> it's

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
even hard to run up and cleats but it's

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.210 
even hard to run up and cleats but it's
actually<00:03:03.480> easier<00:03:03.959> ride<00:03:04.170> in<00:03:04.410> a<00:03:04.500> small<00:03:04.739> gear<00:03:04.950> so

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
actually easier ride in a small gear so

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.430 
actually easier ride in a small gear so
just<00:03:05.400> be<00:03:05.910> prepared<00:03:06.090> drop<00:03:07.020> it<00:03:07.110> down<00:03:07.200> and<00:03:07.380> you

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
just be prepared drop it down and you

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.990 
just be prepared drop it down and you
smooth<00:03:07.739> gear<00:03:08.040> you'll<00:03:08.280> need<00:03:08.340> your<00:03:08.760> smaller

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
smooth gear you'll need your smaller

smooth gear you'll need your smaller
skier<00:03:09.360> are<00:03:10.140> in<00:03:10.500> a<00:03:10.739> 23<00:03:11.340> and<00:03:11.700> I<00:03:12.330> found<00:03:12.690> I<00:03:12.750> had<00:03:12.780> to

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
skier are in a 23 and I found I had to

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.560 
skier are in a 23 and I found I had to
gather<00:03:13.080> the<00:03:13.230> saddle<00:03:13.560> so<00:03:13.800> I'd<00:03:14.220> run<00:03:14.459> a<00:03:14.489> 25<00:03:15.000> or<00:03:15.180> 27

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
gather the saddle so I'd run a 25 or 27

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:20.509 
gather the saddle so I'd run a 25 or 27
for<00:03:15.900> sure<00:03:18.590> the<00:03:19.590> last<00:03:19.800> half<00:03:20.100> of<00:03:20.220> the<00:03:20.310> course

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
for sure the last half of the course

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.750 
for sure the last half of the course
will<00:03:21.180> last<00:03:21.560> 25<00:03:22.560> percent<00:03:22.950> of<00:03:23.070> course<00:03:23.220> be

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
will last 25 percent of course be

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.540 
will last 25 percent of course be
extremely<00:03:24.750> conservative<00:03:25.230> because<00:03:25.800> it's<00:03:25.980> it's

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
extremely conservative because it's it's

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.970 
extremely conservative because it's it's
a<00:03:26.700> really<00:03:27.180> difficult<00:03:27.390> thing<00:03:27.870> to<00:03:28.320> ride<00:03:28.620> when

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
a really difficult thing to ride when

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.820 
a really difficult thing to ride when
you<00:03:29.100> tie<00:03:29.310> it<00:03:29.370> especially<00:03:29.730> that<00:03:29.910> last<00:03:30.180> hill

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
you tie it especially that last hill

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.080 
you tie it especially that last hill
before<00:03:31.830> you<00:03:31.890> get<00:03:32.040> back<00:03:32.160> to<00:03:32.250> the<00:03:32.340> rollers<00:03:32.760> going

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
before you get back to the rollers going

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.780 
before you get back to the rollers going
back<00:03:33.239> into<00:03:33.420> town<00:03:33.600> so<00:03:34.160> really<00:03:35.160> take<00:03:35.610> it

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
back into town so really take it

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.449 
back into town so really take it
conservatively<00:03:36.480> in<00:03:36.840> the<00:03:37.019> last<00:03:37.250> in<00:03:38.250> the<00:03:38.340> last

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
conservatively in the last in the last

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.790 
conservatively in the last in the last
two<00:03:38.730> decades
