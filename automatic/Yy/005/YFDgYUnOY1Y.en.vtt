correctly<00:01:14.909> like<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.630> first<00:01:15.869> thing<00:01:16.259> I<00:01:16.409> used<00:01:16.710> to

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
correctly like the first thing I used to

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.350 
correctly like the first thing I used to
draw<00:01:17.490> was<00:01:17.909> probably<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:19.259> touchpad<00:01:20.220> in<00:01:20.549> a<00:01:21.180> laptop

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
draw was probably a touchpad in a laptop

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.050 
draw was probably a touchpad in a laptop
because<00:01:21.780> that<00:01:22.560> was<00:01:22.710> all<00:01:22.950> I<00:01:23.009> had<00:01:23.280> I<00:01:23.490> had<00:01:23.700> a<00:01:23.729> tiny

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.300 
because that was all I had I had a tiny
little<00:01:24.540> laptop<00:01:25.790> to<00:01:26.790> work<00:01:27.119> on<00:01:27.600> Photoshop<00:01:28.500> six<00:01:29.009> I
