that's the first bit okay so and on this

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:03.720 
that's the first bit okay so and on this
bit<00:01:02.379> you<00:01:02.410> want<00:01:02.679> to<00:01:02.800> carry<00:01:03.160> on<00:01:03.339> along<00:01:03.550> this

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 
bit you want to carry on along this

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.880 
bit you want to carry on along this
track<00:01:04.030> and<00:01:04.300> it<00:01:04.660> gets<00:01:04.870> pretty<00:01:05.050> overgrown<00:01:05.320> along

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
track and it gets pretty overgrown along

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.760 
track and it gets pretty overgrown along
there<00:01:06.100> so<00:01:06.700> you<00:01:07.060> have<00:01:07.270> to<00:01:07.510> sort<00:01:08.140> of<00:01:08.230> fight<00:01:08.500> away

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
there so you have to sort of fight away

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.860 
there so you have to sort of fight away
the<00:01:08.980> bushes<00:01:09.909> but<00:01:10.240> if<00:01:10.480> you<00:01:10.570> keep<00:01:10.720> on<00:01:10.840> going

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:10.870 
the bushes but if you keep on going

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.350 
the bushes but if you keep on going
along<00:01:11.140> runs<00:01:11.770> directly<00:01:12.250> parallel<00:01:12.850> to<00:01:13.030> the<00:01:13.210> air

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 
along runs directly parallel to the air

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.270 
along runs directly parallel to the air
the<00:01:13.659> dual<00:01:13.810> carriageway<00:01:14.320> so<00:01:14.890> you're<00:01:15.040> not<00:01:15.100> going

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
the dual carriageway so you're not going

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.000
