00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:47.510 
away because you don't need them I'd
like<00:04:45.150> to<00:04:45.300> hear<00:04:45.419> what<00:04:45.539> they<00:04:45.659> are<00:04:45.860> well<00:04:46.860> I<00:04:47.159> made

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
like to hear what they are well I made

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.850 
like to hear what they are well I made
adjustments<00:04:48.210> to<00:04:48.360> your<00:04:48.389> accelerator<00:04:49.080> so<00:04:49.830> I

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
adjustments to your accelerator so I

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.469 
adjustments to your accelerator so I
thought<00:04:50.220> you<00:04:50.370> might<00:04:50.400> have<00:04:50.610> trouble<00:04:51.180> with<00:04:51.330> your

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:51.479 
thought you might have trouble with your

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:53.390 
thought you might have trouble with your
speed<00:04:51.750> regulator<00:04:52.289> for<00:04:52.560> a<00:04:52.620> little<00:04:52.949> while<00:04:53.130> and

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
speed regulator for a little while and

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.100 
speed regulator for a little while and
quite<00:04:53.789> possibly<00:04:53.970> experienced<00:04:54.870> higher

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
quite possibly experienced higher

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.610 
quite possibly experienced higher
acceleration<00:04:55.650> I<00:04:56.810> wanted<00:04:57.810> to<00:04:57.930> let<00:04:58.110> you<00:04:58.139> know<00:04:58.289> it

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
acceleration I wanted to let you know it

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:13.430 
acceleration I wanted to let you know it
would<00:04:58.800> write<00:04:59.009> itself<00:04:59.520> I<00:05:12.139> think<00:05:13.139> you<00:05:13.199> switched

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 
would write itself I think you switched

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.180 
would write itself I think you switched
AC<00:05:13.949> to<00:05:14.219> DC<00:05:14.750> I<00:05:15.750> did<00:05:16.139> nothing<00:05:16.289> of<00:05:16.530> the<00:05:16.590> kind

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:17.190 
AC to DC I did nothing of the kind

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:20.570 
AC to DC I did nothing of the kind
how<00:05:17.580> dare<00:05:17.789> you<00:05:17.819> say<00:05:18.150> that<00:05:18.590> I'm<00:05:19.590> sorry<00:05:19.919> it's

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:32.600 

he<00:05:30.270> could<00:05:30.450> use<00:05:30.480> some<00:05:30.810> time<00:05:31.020> alone<00:05:31.250> yeah<00:05:32.250> you're

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:32.610
