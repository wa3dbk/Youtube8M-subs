crevice<00:01:02.250> tool<00:01:02.399> is<00:01:02.520> nice<00:01:02.699> but<00:01:03.239> I<00:01:03.830> mean<00:01:05.360> it's

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
crevice tool is nice but I mean it's

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.070

just too wide to be really used so now I
will<00:01:10.380> convert<00:01:10.680> it<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:10.830> lift<00:01:11.040> way<00:01:11.280> mode<00:01:11.490> will

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
will convert it to lift way mode will

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.200 
will convert it to lift way mode will
show<00:01:11.939> you<00:01:12.000> some<00:01:12.240> attachment<00:01:12.720> use<00:01:13.970> okay<00:01:14.970> I

like that now if you want a shorter

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.370 
like that now if you want a shorter
crevice<00:02:13.360> tool<00:02:13.630> to<00:02:14.320> get<00:02:14.410> into<00:02:14.680> tighter<00:02:14.890> spaces

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
crevice tool to get into tighter spaces

cool<00:02:29.440> so<00:02:29.800> its<00:02:29.980> first<00:02:30.310> it's<00:02:30.520> 180<00:02:31.060> degree<00:02:31.330> angle

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
cool so its first it's 180 degree angle

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.810 
cool so its first it's 180 degree angle
you<00:02:32.440> rotate<00:02:32.800> it<00:02:32.920> and<00:02:33.010> as<00:02:33.160> a<00:02:33.190> 90<00:02:33.490> degree<00:02:33.790> angle

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:02.569 
do this on this probably is not the best

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:04.030
