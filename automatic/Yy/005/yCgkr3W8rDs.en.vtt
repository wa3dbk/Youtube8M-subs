when applying eyelashes to use tweezers
and<00:02:30.720> if<00:02:31.050> you<00:02:31.380> just<00:02:31.620> peel<00:02:31.980> them<00:02:32.010> off<00:02:32.310> from<00:02:33.260> the

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
and if you just peel them off from the

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.199 
and if you just peel them off from the
little<00:02:34.530> sticky<00:02:34.830> bits<00:02:35.070> and<00:02:35.400> just<00:02:35.730> hold<00:02:35.940> them<00:02:36.060> in

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
little sticky bits and just hold them in

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.750 
little sticky bits and just hold them in
the<00:02:36.239> corner<00:02:36.480> and<00:02:36.959> then<00:02:37.530> you<00:02:37.680> can<00:02:37.890> run<00:02:38.130> your

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
the corner and then you can run your

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.560 
the corner and then you can run your
glue<00:02:39.860> you<00:02:40.860> just<00:02:41.010> want<00:02:41.190> to<00:02:41.250> put<00:02:41.519> quite<00:02:42.510> a

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
glue you just want to put quite a

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.600 
glue you just want to put quite a
generous<00:02:43.050> amount<00:02:43.230> of<00:02:43.590> glue<00:02:43.650> all<00:02:44.220> the<00:02:44.459> way

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
generous amount of glue all the way

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.420 
generous amount of glue all the way
along<00:02:45.200> especially<00:02:46.200> in<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:46.709> corners<00:02:47.190> because

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
along especially in the corners because

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:53.990 
along especially in the corners because
that's<00:02:47.700> where<00:02:47.910> they<00:02:48.030> can<00:02:48.500> lift<00:02:49.500> slightly<00:02:53.000> and

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
that's where they can lift slightly and

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.750 
that's where they can lift slightly and
you<00:02:54.900> just<00:02:55.140> want<00:02:55.440> to<00:02:55.560> leave<00:02:55.860> that<00:02:55.890> for<00:02:56.430> a<00:02:56.489> couple

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
you just want to leave that for a couple

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.260 
you just want to leave that for a couple
of<00:02:56.820> seconds<00:02:57.950> just<00:02:58.950> for<00:02:59.220> it<00:02:59.280> to<00:02:59.430> start

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 
of seconds just for it to start

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.590 
of seconds just for it to start
to<00:03:02.170> try<00:03:02.550> this<00:03:03.550> one<00:03:03.610> is<00:03:03.850> white<00:03:04.120> so<00:03:04.150> it's<00:03:04.480> quite

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
to try this one is white so it's quite

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.330 
to try this one is white so it's quite
good<00:03:04.810> because<00:03:04.930> you<00:03:05.110> can<00:03:05.170> see<00:03:05.530> where<00:03:05.890> you<00:03:06.160> need

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
good because you can see where you need

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.700 
good because you can see where you need
to<00:03:06.490> apply<00:03:06.730> the<00:03:06.820> glue<00:03:07.240> and<00:03:07.450> then<00:03:08.020> when<00:03:08.260> it<00:03:08.380> dries

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:08.710 
to apply the glue and then when it dries

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.640 
to apply the glue and then when it dries
it<00:03:08.980> dries<00:03:09.010> clear<00:03:09.610> so<00:03:10.050> you<00:03:11.050> will<00:03:11.200> have<00:03:11.350> loads<00:03:11.530> of

it dries clear so you will have loads of

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.720 
it dries clear so you will have loads of
white<00:03:12.340> bits<00:03:12.900> everywhere<00:03:14.250> what<00:03:15.250> I<00:03:15.280> like<00:03:15.430> to<00:03:15.580> do
