00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 hello to all I come back with a 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.400
 new anti tau of flowers because 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:06.990
 I love flowers and I have never 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.849
 did that one on my youtube channel 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.960
 it's an orchid that I made in 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.960
 one stroock technique 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.800
 I realized this capsule during a 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:19.000
 training at my home in pau and I wanted 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.680
 do it on size nails 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.509
 normal so I first applied the 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.189
 nice navy blue polish and kohler club 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:26.500
 I love to thiviers with the top coat 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:28.390
 tami taylor the structure of the orchid 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.579
 is simple enough you really have to leave 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:33.219
 from a central point have made a first 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:35.680
 small petals then two very very very 

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:37.899
 big in the center and then two more 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.760
 little ones underneath so you really have to 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:40.270
 that all come together in one point if not 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.010
 it missed 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.190
 here is the range of colors that I have 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:47.530
 chosen I will start by taking 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.870
 half navy and half blue 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.640
 clear I'm degrading and I'm going to do the 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.409
 first little petals so who is in 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.329
 makes a form of drops 

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:56.949
 if it is not successful it is not 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:58.749
 serious since in any case both 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:01.210
 petals of the sides will come totally 

00:00:58.749 --> 00:01:03.039
 the case at almost then I take 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.080
 navy blue and white game 

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:07.300
 grades and then I take a little 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.310
 touch of turquoise and I add it is 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.170
 like that we have a tricolor group that 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.540
 incidentally looks very bad at the camera 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.970
 we see nothing I put in my brush at 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.610
 inside the first petal and I'm going 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.770
 realize so a big petals very very 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.500
 open then it is absolutely necessary to rotate 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.270
 the brush on him even the end of 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.219
 navy blue brush the point of the brush 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.509
 navy blue must not move he must 

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:30.509
 stay at the central point 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.310
 I take two thirds of blue 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:38.049
 navy and a third of white game 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.329
 grades and I'm going to realize the petals 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:42.609
 from below so I put my brush a 

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:45.189
 little bit inside the petals of 

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:47.560
 sides and I realize a little comma 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:50.649
 just below in fact the other two 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:53.649
 and always who plays m feint who is 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:55.869
 well connected to the central point of the flower 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:58.119
 current that everything everything concentrates 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:59.829
 on this point there then I redo the 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.740
 degrade sides ie blue 

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:04.810
 white with a touch of turquoise and I 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.520
 will redo the second layer of 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.780
 petals of the sides since in fact the 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.820
 petals on the sides if you look at 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.520
 pictures of orchids on google images in 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.300
 does they go over the three 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.580
 who has behind 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.700
 so here I redo the second layer of 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:21.220
 petals on the sides you will also notice 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:23.349
 that the whole flower was made in one 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.440
 only layer apart these two petals there 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:26.150
 and does not need 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.400
 at these two layers it's a very hard job 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.710
 careful and you may miss that 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.600
 it's not accurate then with the same 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:35.510
 color as the base so navy blue 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.940
 I will not trace the outlines but 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.470
 in fact I will delimited my flower of 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.960
 way that they really stand out 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.820
 much more as you see I'm going 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.710
 also serve me to correct the 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.270
 flaws that's it's very very 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:49.040
 convenient 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:51.860
 then I'll take some white and I 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.110
 redo only the rounded duo of the 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.460
 flower to always do the same for 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.080
 bring out to make light 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.790
 I then trace two small 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.190
 parentheses a bit like a coffee bean 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.440
 in the middle with a little walleye and a 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.750
 little point young and for the decor all 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.220
 around I took 1.2 timpul very very 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.500
 hungry finally here it's not a drop of 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.720
 tim soul is a needle that is used to 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.520
 make drawings in clay them I 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.440
 believe in you have given it and so I 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.570
 make small dots from the 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.250
 center down and center towards 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.780
 the other side I hope that the tutorial 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.980
 this flower will have pleased you and bags 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.810
 for the girls who come with me in 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.100
 one-stop level 2 training that she is 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.990
 in the program so you can 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.489
 train to do it in the meantime 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:30.470
 meet or even try on my page 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:32.000
 facebook and I will be really happy 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.870
 to see what you have done soon 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.870
 next friday
