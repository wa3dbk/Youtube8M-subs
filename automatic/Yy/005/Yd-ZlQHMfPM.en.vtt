00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:30.979 
then you will see this box come up so

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:35.529 
then you will see this box come up so
this<00:04:31.159> is<00:04:31.189> left<00:04:31.610> and<00:04:31.849> left<00:04:32.240> is<00:04:32.509> on<00:04:33.370> the<00:04:34.370> x<00:04:34.669> so<00:04:35.479> you

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:35.539 
this is left and left is on the x so you

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:38.950 
this is left and left is on the x so you
want<00:04:35.750> minus<00:04:36.439> 4<00:04:36.919> for<00:04:37.490> X<00:04:37.729> make<00:04:38.539> sure<00:04:38.780> that's

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
want minus 4 for X make sure that's

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.260 
want minus 4 for X make sure that's
relative<00:04:39.590> and<00:04:39.830> you<00:04:40.310> can<00:04:40.430> copy<00:04:40.699> and<00:04:40.849> paste<00:04:40.909> this

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
relative and you can copy and paste this

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:49.300 
relative and you can copy and paste this
and<00:04:41.539> up<00:04:42.229> is<00:04:44.409> minus<00:04:45.409> 4<00:04:45.949> for<00:04:46.219> y<00:04:48.009> make<00:04:49.009> sure<00:04:49.189> that's

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
and up is minus 4 for y make sure that's

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:53.709 
and up is minus 4 for y make sure that's
relative<00:04:49.819> right<00:04:50.659> is<00:04:50.960> 4<00:04:51.469> for<00:04:51.680> X<00:04:52.569> make<00:04:53.569> sure

00:04:53.709 --> 00:04:53.719 
relative right is 4 for X make sure

00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:56.890 
relative right is 4 for X make sure
that's<00:04:53.870> relative<00:04:54.379> and<00:04:54.650> down<00:04:55.310> isn't<00:04:55.699> 4<00:04:56.419> for<00:04:56.689> y

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900 
that's relative and down isn't 4 for y

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.659 
that's relative and down isn't 4 for y
so<00:04:57.400> make<00:04:58.400> sure<00:04:58.430> that<00:04:58.759> is<00:04:58.879> relative<00:05:00.129> now<00:05:01.129> the

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:01.669 
so make sure that is relative now the

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:03.550 
so make sure that is relative now the
higher<00:05:01.909> number<00:05:02.360> see<00:05:02.750> I've<00:05:02.930> had<00:05:03.229> four<00:05:03.529> and

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 
higher number see I've had four and

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.429 
higher number see I've had four and
everyone<00:05:04.189> but<00:05:04.550> the<00:05:04.669> high<00:05:04.819> number<00:05:05.210> so<00:05:05.449> say<00:05:05.689> six

00:05:06.429 --> 00:05:06.439 
everyone but the high number so say six

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:09.159 
everyone but the high number so say six
it<00:05:06.949> will<00:05:07.159> go<00:05:07.279> faster<00:05:07.789> the<00:05:08.360> lower<00:05:08.569> number<00:05:08.930> go

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:09.169 
it will go faster the lower number go

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:12.249 
it will go faster the lower number go
slow<00:05:09.469> pretty<00:05:10.460> basic<00:05:10.729> okay<00:05:11.599> so<00:05:11.659> now<00:05:11.960> you<00:05:12.020> want

00:05:12.249 --> 00:05:12.259 
slow pretty basic okay so now you want

00:05:12.259 --> 00:05:14.050 
slow pretty basic okay so now you want
to<00:05:12.379> create<00:05:12.710> a<00:05:12.770> collision<00:05:13.370> so<00:05:13.580> when<00:05:13.759> it<00:05:13.849> hits

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:14.060 
to create a collision so when it hits

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.140 
to create a collision so when it hits
the<00:05:14.240> wall<00:05:14.449> it<00:05:15.199> won't<00:05:15.710> move<00:05:15.889> slow<00:05:16.250> cook<00:05:16.939> other

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:17.150 
the wall it won't move slow cook other

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.740 
the wall it won't move slow cook other
then<00:05:17.419> collision<00:05:18.319> and<00:05:18.770> then<00:05:18.889> cut<00:05:19.069> the<00:05:19.250> wall<00:05:19.430> and

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:19.750 
then collision and then cut the wall and

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:23.740 
then collision and then cut the wall and
then<00:05:21.099> click<00:05:22.099> this<00:05:22.370> jump<00:05:22.909> to<00:05:23.060> position<00:05:23.509> again

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:23.750 
then click this jump to position again

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:26.260 
then click this jump to position again
the<00:05:23.990> X<00:05:24.490> with<00:05:25.490> an<00:05:25.610> arrow<00:05:25.759> pointing<00:05:25.849> to<00:05:26.150> another

the X with an arrow pointing to another

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:29.619 
the X with an arrow pointing to another
X<00:05:27.069> and<00:05:28.069> click<00:05:28.279> OK<00:05:28.789> and<00:05:29.000> just<00:05:29.180> leave<00:05:29.360> the<00:05:29.449> owl<00:05:29.599> is
