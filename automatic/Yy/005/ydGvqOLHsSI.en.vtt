00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:08.360
 lassec on the entities produced 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:11.820
 by intestinal epithelial cells 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:13.640
 they act on the brush edge and also 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:18.110
 inside 

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:20.600
 of the cells themselves the amines 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:24.560
 peptidases located on the border in 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:26.300
 brush cleaves amino acids one to one 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.660
 at the terminal minute minute of the 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:32.509
 peptides intracellular peptidases 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:35.600
 act on the small peptides that 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:37.720
 the action is absorbed by the cells 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.579
 concerted proteolytic enzymes 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:44.180
 produced by stomach cells 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:47.020
 the pancreas and the intestine splits 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:51.180
 amino acid feed proteins 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:53.370
 digestive enzymes are digested 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.920
 digested themselves and the 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.010
 food proteins also 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.840
 digest intestinal cells 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:04.710
 dead that are likely to be emptied to the 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:07.080
 light these cells are replaced by 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:11.130
 others that mature from cells 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:13.170
 precursors of the duodenal crypts the 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.850
 amount of digested proteins and 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.640
 absorbed every day of the juices 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.280
 digestive and from the released cells to 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.740
 the intestinal lumen may be the same 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.259
 or greater than the amount of proteins 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:29.360
 consumed in the diet that usually 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.360
 be approximately 50 to 100 grams 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:36.620
 we have the following question a 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:39.830
 clinical issue a young girl 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:44.830
 with cystic fibrosis has had 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.830
 repeated episodes of bronchitis 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:52.760
 produced by pseudomonas 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:56.050
 aeruginosa in each of 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.050
 the infections 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.659
 your response to antibiotics 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.080
 administered in aerosol form has 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:10.050
 been good 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:13.270
 despite this the patient continues 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.860
 presenting a low absorption 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.710
 of the modern ways of the 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:20.200
 feeding what has caused the 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:23.540
 presence of voluminous stools and 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:26.540
 bright and stink 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:29.260
 growth studies of grams of 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:32.569
 growth shows a slow decline 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:35.390
 this development 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:38.180
 the patient is then in the 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.930
 present and 24 in size and in 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.090
 20th percentile in weight 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:46.209
 is often apathetic and 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.830
 irritable and tires easily with 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:52.670
 moderate physical activity 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:54.410
 when his pediatrician discovered that the 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:58.130
 Serum protein concentration 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:59.960
 albumin transfer transferrin and pre 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:05.150
 hormone transporting albumin 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:07.120
 thyroid trans trans and retina were 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.750
 below normal levels 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.250
 indicating therefore in the 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:16.000
 protein malnutrition grÃ cia everything so yes 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.000
 enteric microspheres 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:22.580
 coated with pancreatic enzymes almost 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.190
 immediately to the appearance of the stool 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:27.800
 say if they normalized and started to 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.870
 get fat in the next six months in 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.480
 their growth curves showed a 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:36.040
 improvement and seemed more awake more 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.040
 active and less true 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:43.670
 we now have the following medical note 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:47.920
 the cups 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.920
 It is also found in neutrophils 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.200
 the leukocytes that take care of 

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:55.720
 encompass and destroy bacteria 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.900
 invasive neutrophils act 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:01.180
 frequently in the lungs and the 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:06.520
 the rates over sometimes is 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:10.120
 released while these neutrophils 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:13.510
 are active within the 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:16.200
 normal people the action of the enzyme 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:19.200
 alpha 1 antitrypsin 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.200
 circulating 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:23.710
 which is in turn an inhibitor of 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:27.460
 proteases that is of degree by the liver 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:29.530
 and prevents the cup 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:33.039
 destroys the cells themselves 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:35.110
 lungs certain people possess 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:38.490
 a genetic mutation that causes 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:41.740
 production of an alpha 1 antitrypsin 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:44.289
 inactive that is to say they present a 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:47.139
 Alpha 1 enzyme deficiency 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:50.080
 antitrypsin activated this causes the 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:52.090
 emphysema formation produced by the 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.400
 Proteolytic destruction of cells 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:56.110
 lungs which results in a 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:00.090
 reduction of expansion capacity 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.090
 contraction of the lungs 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:08.519
 another medical note 

00:05:03.249 --> 00:05:12.389
 patients with cystic fibrosis 

00:05:08.519 --> 00:05:12.389
 they have a genetic defect 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:19.550
 of the role of chlorine channels in 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.860
 the secretory ducts is pancreatic 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.990
 that carry the pancreatic enzymes to the 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:26.180
 light of the small intestine 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.860
 this effect causes dryness and 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.710
 thickening where the secretions 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:32.840
 pancreatic exocrine what in turn 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:36.050
 finally leads to the obstruction of 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:38.090
 those conduits one of the consequences 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:40.370
 of this problem is the inability to 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:42.680
 pancreatic enzymes to enter 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:46.870
 the intestinal light to digest the 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.870
 food proteins
