00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
whole repertoire today and I would tend

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.620 
whole repertoire today and I would tend
to<00:01:07.469> doubt<00:01:07.649> it<00:01:07.909> because<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.060> other<00:01:09.179> thing<00:01:09.450> is

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
to doubt it because the other thing is

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.690 
to doubt it because the other thing is
that<00:01:09.659> birds<00:01:10.649> don't<00:01:10.829> always<00:01:11.009> do<00:01:11.249> what<00:01:11.399> you<00:01:11.520> want

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
that birds don't always do what you want

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.340 
that birds don't always do what you want
them<00:01:11.819> to<00:01:11.909> do<00:01:12.030> they<00:01:12.210> seem<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.600> exercise<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.049> fair

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
them to do they seem to exercise a fair

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.330 
them to do they seem to exercise a fair
amount<00:01:13.439> of<00:01:13.649> freewill

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
amount of freewill

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.039 
amount of freewill
so<00:01:14.819> if<00:01:14.969> you<00:01:15.060> ever<00:01:15.240> seen<00:01:15.479> what<00:01:15.630> someone

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
so if you ever seen what someone

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.840 
so if you ever seen what someone
performing<00:01:16.829> with<00:01:17.039> a<00:01:17.069> bird<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.609> bird<00:01:17.729> is

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
performing with a bird and the bird is

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.239 
performing with a bird and the bird is
talking<00:01:18.240> quite<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:18.450> bit<00:01:18.719> that<00:01:19.590> means<00:01:19.889> probably

00:01:20.239 --> 00:01:20.249 
talking quite a bit that means probably

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:22.190 
talking quite a bit that means probably
that<00:01:20.429> the<00:01:20.520> bird<00:01:20.670> is<00:01:20.789> happy<00:01:21.179> and<00:01:21.450> that<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.020> bird

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
that the bird is happy and that the bird

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.590

is<00:01:22.409> very<00:01:22.469> well<00:01:22.859> focused<00:01:23.369> it's<00:01:23.880> very<00:01:24.149> difficult

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
is very well focused it's very difficult

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.270 
is very well focused it's very difficult
to<00:01:24.780> get<00:01:24.869> a<00:01:24.929> bird<00:01:25.139> to<00:01:25.319> perform<00:01:25.770> in<00:01:25.920> front<00:01:25.950> of<00:01:26.159> an

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
attention I guess when when they talk

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.679 
attention I guess when when they talk
and<00:01:58.679> they<00:01:58.740> do<00:01:58.829> it<00:01:59.099> for<00:01:59.249> that<00:01:59.340> reason<00:01:59.549> so<00:02:00.389> let's

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
and they do it for that reason so let's

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.529 
and they do it for that reason so let's
