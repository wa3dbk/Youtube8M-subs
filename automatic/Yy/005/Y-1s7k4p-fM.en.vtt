00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120
 Hi everyone, here I am finally 

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:09.750
 returned with a new excuse tutorial 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.550
 the absence but also October turned out 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.670
 a very busy month 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:18.300
 today I propose a recipe that I and 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:21.600
 noemi we recently approved ed 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.150
 it is therefore a rolon sore in cream 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.119
 you need a pack of 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.160
 these with the patrol and lina but not 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.099
 worry if it's okay 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.210
 also any other container 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:36.000
 possibly not put on the hand e 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.550
 then apply it is very simple to 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.770
 to carry out only requires use 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.469
 also of the pdp me for how to do the 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.719
 but there are no exciting creams 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.329
 inside the blender will serve ad 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.820
 mix everything then we will use 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:54.629
 specific active also odor that there 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.129
 I will also indicate jojoba oil and acid 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.710
 hyaluronic that you can easily 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:02.160
 replace also with aloe vera gel 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.489
 so now let's move on to the recipe is a 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.489
 method 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.009
 let's take a container and pecchia mall 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:12.009
 demineralized water 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.880
 we hope our thickener is the 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:26.340
 carrÃ  geleen has already had it seen 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.530
 how to use it in another video vi 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.500
 I leave the link in the information boxes e 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:35.190
 as I have already told you about the characteristic 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.800
 to be silicone this will confer 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:42.200
 a very professional and non-professional texture 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.200
 sticky to our hard and during 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:55.909
 we are in our water 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:02:01.030
 demineralized and now let's try with the 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:01.030
 blender to make our gel form 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.569
 now it's time to weigh 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:11.560
 one of our active anti odor ie the 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:11.560
 potassium lamp 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:24.750
 we are going to pour into ours 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.750
 genius 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.850
 are given that the potassium cloud does 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:36.010
 melt in the heat we go to warm up 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:39.220
 slightly in the microwave for some 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:42.040
 second after heating in the microwave 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.959
 for a few seconds and then vi 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.730
 blended with the blender then mi 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:49.959
 recommend given another tap 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.739
 Minipimer will become a sort of granita 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.360
 of gel 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.860
 as you can see there are many 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.239
 little bits of twins but not there 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.709
 worried because then in the second 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:59.560
 part of the provision 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:01.810
 everything will change now let's put this one 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.400
 becker in the fridge and we take care of the 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.010
 second phase 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:09.489
 first of all let's weigh ours 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:12.930
 soluble I am using bios 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:16.150
 or1 sol using totally echo 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:18.069
 compatible but you can also use 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.310
 another just using as ad 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:23.680
 example the polysorbate which is not 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:26.410
 reserved 20 which is not biological echo 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:29.410
 so we go there to weigh the only one 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:32.920
 using it will serve to disperse the phase 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:38.100
 fat within the aqueous phase 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:38.100
 without the use of emulsifiers 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:45.430
 add the second anti-odor active 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:48.160
 the thrill citrate and is fat for 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.940
 this is dispersed within the sole 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.940
 utilizing 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.379
 let's add our fragrance myself 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:02.480
 I use a neutral fragrance at 

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:05.030
 talcum powder that I purchased from the site 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.550
 vernile but they sell almost all 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.500
 sites online however you can also not 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:12.530
 put a vacation even if a 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.870
 it is not painful without a fragrance 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:17.419
 or you can buy it in others 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:19.930
 shops or herbalist shops that are located 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:19.930
 in the city 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:26.620
 I add three drops of essential oil 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.620
 titles 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:33.380
 finally to make even more so many already 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:35.800
 and our nutritious during will go to 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:41.330
 also use jojoba oil 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:43.759
 organic and now let's go mix 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:49.250
 all our oils within the soul 

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:51.229
 using mix well for now 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.120
 that our water phase is 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:56.240
 cooled we can go to 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:05:00.169
 reach our active anti-odor 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:02.150
 together with the perfume it is only using and 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:11.479
 we give a first mixed with the 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:13.550
 teaspoon and now we go to give one 

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:15.110
 blended with the blender to make 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:18.050
 mix everything together 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:19.940
 now after giving a first smoothie 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:22.820
 like the blender as you already see it is 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:26.360
 everything is amalgamating I go to 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:29.199
 add the hyaluronic acid you can 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:31.940
 replace with aggregating gel 

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:33.710
 I could even do it before just that 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:35.780
 I was forgotten so I add it 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:38.169
 now and then I'm going to reform with the 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.169
 blender 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:48.360
 therefore they are born and then I go to brake of 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:50.580
 new with rights as you see later 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:54.150
 have blended everything with the blender 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:57.210
 comes a kind of very very foam 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:59.670
 foamy the foam will go away after a few 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:02.910
 days because given simply by the 

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:05.790
 strength of the blender and also of the soul 

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:09.240
 however, after a short time it will go 

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:11.670
 away and it will become a totally gel 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:15.230
 transparent now there is nothing else 

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:15.230
 which add the preservative 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:24.580
 given another pass of blender after 

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:26.430
 have added the preservative like 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:30.310
 you can see the whole thing has become 

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:31.360
 even more smoky it looks like a cream 

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:33.130
 mounted 

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:40.420
 so now let's go and check the 

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:44.320
 our ph as you can see the ph e 

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:47.920
 very acid indeed is found at 3 and 5 

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:50.140
 we must take it between 4 and 5 and 5 

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:53.920
 so I'm going to add some 

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:57.550
 base solution of hydroxide of 

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:59.050
 sodium just a maximum of two drops and then 

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:01.750
 I'm going to whisk again with the 

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:03.880
 pH measuring minipimer 

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:06.340
 now all I have to do is go to 

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:08.410
 pack my big I am 

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:11.230
 using a round pack 

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:14.050
 recycled but you can also use them 

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:17.290
 a new one they sell in almost all 

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:19.720
 online sites of raw materials such as vi 

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:22.210
 I said the compound later 

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:25.270
 will become completely transparent 

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:27.130
 then fill your package on 

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:29.860
 compound they advance put into a 

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:33.970
 container as a refill then we hope 

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:36.550
 the ball in this way 

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:39.280
 and behold our aching rolon is 

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:42.190
 therefore ready for use has boys 

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:43.750
 this is all true that the tutorial vi 

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:46.450
 both liked I hope you too 

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:49.090
 make your rolon deodorant in 

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:51.960
 homemade cream a big kiss is at 

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:51.960
 next hello
