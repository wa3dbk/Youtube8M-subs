00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
getting shot from the back I thought my

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.670 
getting shot from the back I thought my
teammate<00:03:18.750> was<00:03:18.900> already<00:03:19.170> over<00:03:19.260> there<00:03:19.470> so<00:03:19.650> I

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
teammate was already over there so I

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.680 
teammate was already over there so I
thought<00:03:19.860> it<00:03:19.980> was<00:03:20.040> okay<00:03:20.370> and<00:03:20.610> I<00:03:21.269> figured<00:03:21.570> the

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
thought it was okay and I figured the

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.240 
thought it was okay and I figured the
last<00:03:21.900> couple<00:03:22.110> guys<00:03:22.290> are<00:03:22.530> down<00:03:22.650> there<00:03:22.709> on<00:03:23.190> the

bottom<00:03:23.400> of<00:03:23.700> the<00:03:23.760> hill<00:03:23.910> so<00:03:24.480> I<00:03:24.510> chased<00:03:24.900> them<00:03:24.989> down

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
bottom of the hill so I chased them down

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:27.170

which<00:03:25.410> is<00:03:25.500> kind<00:03:25.709> of<00:03:25.739> stupid<00:03:25.920> on<00:03:26.160> my<00:03:26.280> part<00:03:26.310> but

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180
