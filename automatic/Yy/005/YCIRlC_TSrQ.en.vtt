00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
aftermarket things but it does the job

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.479 
aftermarket things but it does the job
it's<00:03:31.609> very<00:03:31.910> dense<00:03:32.239> it's<00:03:32.720> very<00:03:32.959> big<00:03:33.400> and<00:03:34.400> I

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
it's very dense it's very big and I

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:37.150 
it's very dense it's very big and I
would<00:03:34.670> say<00:03:34.850> does<00:03:35.060> a<00:03:35.090> great<00:03:35.329> job<00:03:35.739> in<00:03:36.739> his

would say does a great job in his

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.910 
would say does a great job in his
function<00:03:37.639> as<00:03:38.450> far<00:03:39.109> as<00:03:39.230> the<00:03:39.380> headphones

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
function as far as the headphones

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.849 
function as far as the headphones
themselves<00:03:40.160> are<00:03:40.670> concerned<00:03:41.180> I<00:03:41.420> found<00:03:42.380> them<00:03:42.620> to

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:42.859 
themselves are concerned I found them to

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:47.440 
themselves are concerned I found them to
be<00:03:42.889> very<00:03:43.840> articulate<00:03:44.840> and<00:03:44.989> very<00:03:46.000> defined<00:03:47.000> for

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
be very articulate and very defined for

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.289 
be very articulate and very defined for
the<00:03:47.569> $300<00:03:48.410> price<00:03:48.680> range<00:03:49.040> so<00:03:49.579> if<00:03:49.670> this<00:03:49.790> ever<00:03:50.030> was

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:50.299 
the $300 price range so if this ever was

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:53.110 
the $300 price range so if this ever was
$100<00:03:51.139> it<00:03:51.319> far<00:03:51.590> exceeds<00:03:52.010> that<00:03:52.220> and<00:03:52.670> I<00:03:52.760> think<00:03:53.000> it

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
$100 it far exceeds that and I think it

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.390 
$100 it far exceeds that and I think it
really<00:03:53.510> competes<00:03:54.260> well<00:03:54.530> with<00:03:55.190> other

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
really competes well with other

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.780 
really competes well with other
headphones<00:03:55.910> in<00:03:56.150> terms<00:03:56.329> of<00:03:56.540> clarity<00:03:57.170> in<00:03:57.790> the

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
headphones in terms of clarity in the

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.940 
headphones in terms of clarity in the
three<00:03:58.970> hundred<00:03:59.209> dollar<00:03:59.389> range<00:03:59.690> now<00:04:00.620> the<00:04:00.680> one

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
three hundred dollar range now the one

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:02.259 
three hundred dollar range now the one
thing<00:04:01.130> to<00:04:01.250> remember<00:04:01.280> about<00:04:01.639> this<00:04:02.030> headphone

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:02.269 
thing to remember about this headphone

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:05.080 
thing to remember about this headphone
is<00:04:02.450> that<00:04:02.660> it<00:04:02.750> is<00:04:02.870> a<00:04:02.900> closed<00:04:03.470> back<00:04:03.799> style<00:04:04.400> so<00:04:05.030> you

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
is that it is a closed back style so you

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.740 
is that it is a closed back style so you
do<00:04:05.540> have<00:04:05.569> some<00:04:06.170> of<00:04:06.290> the<00:04:06.609> tonality<00:04:07.609> 's<00:04:08.120> and<00:04:08.389> the

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
do have some of the tonality 's and the

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.900 
do have some of the tonality 's and the
airiness<00:04:09.079> that<00:04:09.380> our<00:04:09.650> company<00:04:10.280> a<00:04:10.310> closed<00:04:10.669> back

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
airiness that our company a closed back

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.120 
airiness that our company a closed back
headphone<00:04:11.359> and<00:04:11.569> sometimes<00:04:12.319> it's<00:04:12.560> not<00:04:12.650> quite

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.130 
headphone and sometimes it's not quite

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:17.440 
headphone and sometimes it's not quite
as<00:04:13.310> airy<00:04:13.700> or<00:04:14.030> light<00:04:14.690> or<00:04:15.519> extended<00:04:16.519> as<00:04:16.760> an<00:04:17.150> open

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
as airy or light or extended as an open

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:18.849 
as airy or light or extended as an open
back<00:04:17.660> I<00:04:17.959> think<00:04:18.079> that's<00:04:18.380> one<00:04:18.560> of<00:04:18.620> the<00:04:18.709> major

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859 
back I think that's one of the major

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:21.129 
back I think that's one of the major
benefits<00:04:19.130> of<00:04:19.459> going<00:04:19.880> that<00:04:20.030> route<00:04:20.269> but<00:04:20.750> for<00:04:21.019> our

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:21.139 
benefits of going that route but for our

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:23.170 
benefits of going that route but for our
clothes<00:04:21.410> back<00:04:21.440> it<00:04:22.099> excels<00:04:22.520> at<00:04:22.700> almost<00:04:22.909> all

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
clothes back it excels at almost all

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.640 
clothes back it excels at almost all
things<00:04:24.820> very<00:04:25.820> well-balanced<00:04:26.780> not<00:04:27.110> overly

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
things very well-balanced not overly

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:28.510 
things very well-balanced not overly
bassy

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 
bassy

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.219 
bassy
but<00:04:28.610> it<00:04:28.669> does<00:04:28.849> have<00:04:29.090> that<00:04:29.270> low-end<00:04:29.720> thump<00:04:30.080> that

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:30.229 
but it does have that low-end thump that

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:32.469 
but it does have that low-end thump that
is<00:04:30.410> kind<00:04:30.650> of<00:04:30.740> synonymous<00:04:31.430> with<00:04:31.610> closed<00:04:32.240> back

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:32.479 
is kind of synonymous with closed back

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:34.150 
is kind of synonymous with closed back
headphones<00:04:32.870> so<00:04:32.990> it's<00:04:33.110> got<00:04:33.289> it<00:04:33.680> can<00:04:33.860> get<00:04:33.979> a<00:04:34.039> lot

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
headphones so it's got it can get a lot

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.640 
headphones so it's got it can get a lot
of<00:04:34.310> punch<00:04:34.610> and<00:04:34.970> a<00:04:35.270> lot<00:04:35.389> of<00:04:35.419> push<00:04:35.750> on<00:04:36.020> the<00:04:36.440> very

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
of punch and a lot of push on the very

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.149 
of punch and a lot of push on the very
low<00:04:36.889> end<00:04:37.159> but<00:04:38.060> it's<00:04:38.870> not<00:04:39.020> overly<00:04:39.379> bloated<00:04:39.889> I

00:04:40.149 --> 00:04:40.159 
low end but it's not overly bloated I

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:42.219 
low end but it's not overly bloated I
think<00:04:40.520> it's<00:04:40.639> very<00:04:40.879> well<00:04:41.060> balanced<00:04:41.900> if<00:04:42.020> not

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:42.229 
think it's very well balanced if not

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:45.580 
think it's very well balanced if not
slightly<00:04:43.039> leaning<00:04:43.310> towards<00:04:44.289> more<00:04:45.289> of<00:04:45.470> a

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
slightly leaning towards more of a

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.640 
slightly leaning towards more of a
treble<00:04:46.240> forward<00:04:47.240> signature<00:04:47.870> now<00:04:48.080> not<00:04:48.319> heavy

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
treble forward signature now not heavy

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.399 
treble forward signature now not heavy
not<00:04:49.039> really<00:04:49.729> like<00:04:49.970> sparkly<00:04:50.690> or<00:04:50.870> anything<00:04:51.110> too

00:04:51.399 --> 00:04:51.409 
not really like sparkly or anything too

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:53.110 
not really like sparkly or anything too
much<00:04:51.440> in<00:04:51.680> fact<00:04:51.889> I<00:04:52.009> enjoyed<00:04:52.460> the<00:04:52.610> signature

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 
much in fact I enjoyed the signature

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.809 
much in fact I enjoyed the signature
quite<00:04:53.870> a<00:04:53.900> bit<00:04:54.229> it<00:04:55.039> just<00:04:55.069> leans<00:04:55.520> that<00:04:55.699> way<00:04:55.789> a

00:04:55.809 --> 00:04:55.819 
quite a bit it just leans that way a

00:04:55.819 --> 00:04:58.210 
quite a bit it just leans that way a
hair<00:04:56.270> more<00:04:56.539> than<00:04:56.599> let's<00:04:57.349> say<00:04:57.560> the<00:04:57.770> Sennheiser

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.220 
hair more than let's say the Sennheiser

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.100 
hair more than let's say the Sennheiser
Momentum's<00:04:58.819> which<00:04:59.000> I<00:04:59.150> think<00:04:59.389> kind<00:04:59.659> of<00:04:59.780> strike

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.110 
Momentum's which I think kind of strike

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:08.499 
Momentum's which I think kind of strike
a<00:05:00.139> very<00:05:00.590> nice<00:05:01.750> balanced<00:05:04.030> signature<00:05:05.199> so<00:05:06.610> as<00:05:07.610> far

00:05:08.499 --> 00:05:08.509 
a very nice balanced signature so as far
