here is a new thing for the English
wheel<00:00:23.990> and<00:00:24.590> I<00:00:24.770> think<00:00:24.950> this<00:00:25.100> could<00:00:25.340> be<00:00:25.370> very

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:25.670 
wheel and I think this could be very

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:27.640 
wheel and I think this could be very
useful<00:00:25.730> for<00:00:26.360> you<00:00:26.540> guys<00:00:26.570> out<00:00:27.170> there<00:00:27.200> that<00:00:27.440> have

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:27.650 
useful for you guys out there that have

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.920 
useful for you guys out there that have
the<00:00:28.010> English<00:00:28.250> wheel<00:00:28.430> already<00:00:28.910> but<00:00:29.600> you<00:00:29.720> want

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:29.930 
the English wheel already but you want

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:31.810 
the English wheel already but you want
the<00:00:30.050> tube<00:00:30.290> bender<00:00:30.620> and<00:00:30.830> you<00:00:31.400> can<00:00:31.610> make

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:31.820 
the tube bender and you can make

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.020 
the tube bender and you can make
something<00:00:32.480> like<00:00:32.660> this<00:00:32.930> up<00:00:33.370> that<00:00:34.370> fits<00:00:34.760> your

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.030 
something like this up that fits your

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.780 
something like this up that fits your
English<00:00:35.360> wheel<00:00:35.570> too<00:00:35.900> so<00:00:36.860> this<00:00:37.010> one<00:00:37.310> is<00:00:37.550> made

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:37.790 
English wheel too so this one is made

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:43.240 
English wheel too so this one is made
for<00:00:38.060> my<00:00:38.240> English<00:00:38.570> wheel<00:00:40.630> and<00:00:41.829> I<00:00:42.829> turn<00:00:43.100> that

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
for my English wheel and I turn that

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.850 
for my English wheel and I turn that
down<00:00:43.520> and<00:00:43.790> just<00:00:44.660> hook<00:00:44.960> that<00:00:44.989> over<00:00:45.500> there<00:00:45.680> and

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
down and just hook that over there and

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.910 
down and just hook that over there and
now<00:00:46.700> we<00:00:46.760> have<00:00:47.030> two<00:00:47.300> rollers<00:00:47.720> there<00:00:47.960> and<00:00:48.200> we

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
now we have two rollers there and we

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.889 
now we have two rollers there and we
have<00:00:49.070> the<00:00:49.220> big<00:00:49.399> one<00:00:49.579> on<00:00:49.610> the<00:00:49.760> top<00:00:50.030> and<00:00:50.390> here<00:00:50.870> I

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:50.899 
have the big one on the top and here I

00:00:50.899 --> 00:01:00.549 
have the big one on the top and here I
can<00:00:51.079> adjust<00:00:51.470> this<00:00:51.710> one<00:00:58.000> so<00:00:59.000> for<00:00:59.750> four<00:01:00.260> round

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
can adjust this one so for four round

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:03.280 
can adjust this one so for four round
tubing<00:01:01.250> I<00:01:01.489> need<00:01:01.910> to<00:01:02.120> have<00:01:02.270> a<00:01:02.300> groove<00:01:02.690> on<00:01:02.989> each

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290 
tubing I need to have a groove on each

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.830 
tubing I need to have a groove on each
of<00:01:03.590> those<00:01:03.770> rollers<00:01:04.399> so<00:01:05.149> this<00:01:05.329> is<00:01:05.509> just<00:01:05.659> a

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
of those rollers so this is just a

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.520 
of those rollers so this is just a
prototype<00:01:06.080> turn<00:01:06.710> yes<00:01:07.220> right<00:01:07.460> now<00:01:07.640> and<00:01:08.140> I<00:01:09.140> tried

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
prototype turn yes right now and I tried

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.719 
prototype turn yes right now and I tried
it<00:01:09.710> with<00:01:09.890> the<00:01:09.950> two<00:01:10.250> round<00:01:10.700> tube<00:01:11.030> on<00:01:11.330> this<00:01:12.729> but

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
it with the two round tube on this but

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:15.610 
it with the two round tube on this but
it<00:01:13.850> moves<00:01:14.060> it<00:01:14.270> needs<00:01:14.479> to<00:01:14.690> be<00:01:14.840> in<00:01:15.020> a<00:01:15.110> groove<00:01:15.380> on

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:15.620 
it moves it needs to be in a groove on

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.310 
it moves it needs to be in a groove on
both<00:01:16.610> of<00:01:16.850> those<00:01:16.970> then<00:01:17.330> indeed<00:01:17.690> it<00:01:17.960> will<00:01:18.110> work

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
both of those then indeed it will work

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.649 
both of those then indeed it will work
but<00:01:18.650> it<00:01:18.860> works<00:01:19.100> great<00:01:19.430> for<00:01:19.460> four<00:01:20.180> rectangular

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:20.659 
but it works great for four rectangular

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:25.960 
but it works great for four rectangular
tube<00:01:21.970> so<00:01:22.970> if<00:01:23.390> you<00:01:23.570> want<00:01:23.810> to<00:01:23.960> make<00:01:24.200> a<00:01:24.970> lamp

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.630 
bending but for long radius with justly
little<00:02:19.020> radius<00:02:19.440> on<00:02:19.620> it<00:02:19.670> but<00:02:20.670> low<00:02:21.030> over<00:02:21.330> a<00:02:21.360> long

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
little radius on it but low over a long

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.450 
little radius on it but low over a long
area<00:02:23.870> it's<00:02:24.870> pretty<00:02:25.230> can<00:02:25.560> be<00:02:25.680> a<00:02:25.710> pretty<00:02:25.980> hard<00:02:26.250> to

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
area it's pretty can be a pretty hard to

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.690 
area it's pretty can be a pretty hard to
bend<00:02:27.410> at<00:02:28.410> least<00:02:28.710> they'll<00:02:28.950> have<00:02:29.130> been<00:02:29.280> that<00:02:29.460> for

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
bend at least they'll have been that for

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:40.460 
bend at least they'll have been that for
me<00:02:29.820> so<00:02:30.780> here<00:02:31.350> I'm<00:02:31.620> rolling<00:02:32.550> this<00:02:39.080> and<00:02:40.080> you<00:02:40.230> can

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
me so here I'm rolling this and you can

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.550 
me so here I'm rolling this and you can
see<00:02:40.710> that<00:02:41.040> this<00:02:41.220> one<00:02:41.550> already<00:02:42.030> start<00:02:42.560> bending

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
see that this one already start bending

00:02:43.560 --> 00:03:15.510 
see that this one already start bending
now

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:15.520 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.490 

so<00:03:16.520> if<00:03:16.820> you<00:03:17.000> look<00:03:17.180> from<00:03:17.360> the<00:03:17.450> side<00:03:17.570> view<00:03:18.170> here

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
so if you look from the side view here

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.320 
so if you look from the side view here
now<00:03:20.890> so<00:03:21.890> here<00:03:22.070> you<00:03:22.190> can<00:03:22.400> see<00:03:22.700> how<00:03:23.090> this

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 
now so here you can see how this

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.840 
now so here you can see how this
actually<00:03:23.440> bends<00:03:24.440> more<00:03:24.500> and<00:03:24.980> more<00:03:25.190> when<00:03:25.490> I<00:03:25.520> move

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
actually bends more and more when I move

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:40.270 
actually bends more and more when I move
this<00:03:26.030> back<00:03:26.300> and<00:03:26.480> forth<00:03:38.500> so<00:03:39.500> it<00:03:39.620> actually<00:03:40.040> works

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
this back and forth so it actually works

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.340 
this back and forth so it actually works
pretty<00:03:40.520> good<00:03:40.820> so<00:03:41.570> here<00:03:41.780> you<00:03:41.930> see<00:03:41.960> you<00:03:42.140> have

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 
pretty good so here you see you have

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:46.960 
pretty good so here you see you have
another<00:03:42.880> example<00:03:43.880> of<00:03:44.450> a<00:03:44.870> lamp<00:03:45.140> but<00:03:46.070> I<00:03:46.100> actually

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
another example of a lamp but I actually

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:52.270 
another example of a lamp but I actually
need<00:03:47.300> more<00:03:47.690> on<00:03:47.930> this<00:03:48.140> one<00:03:48.410> now<00:03:50.590> so<00:03:51.590> let's<00:03:51.800> roll

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
need more on this one now so let's roll

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.280 
need more on this one now so let's roll
this<00:03:52.520> and<00:03:52.820> see<00:03:52.970> if<00:03:53.090> I<00:03:53.210> can<00:03:53.420> bend<00:03:53.690> this<00:03:53.930> little

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
this and see if I can bend this little

00:03:54.290 --> 00:04:39.930 
this and see if I can bend this little
more<00:03:54.640> on<00:03:55.640> this<00:03:55.850> one<00:03:56.150> this<00:03:56.510> part

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:45.400 

see<00:04:41.710> so<00:04:42.710> here<00:04:42.919> you<00:04:43.010> have<00:04:43.160> a<00:04:43.190> nice<00:04:43.610> design<00:04:44.410> over

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
see so here you have a nice design over

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.800 
see so here you have a nice design over
lamp<00:04:45.680> if<00:04:45.980> you<00:04:46.130> want<00:04:46.340> a<00:04:46.580> reading<00:04:47.270> lamp<00:04:47.450> in<00:04:47.690> the

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
lamp if you want a reading lamp in the

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:50.730 
lamp if you want a reading lamp in the
living<00:04:48.080> room<00:04:48.400> you<00:04:49.400> can<00:04:49.580> put<00:04:49.730> the<00:04:49.820> wire<00:04:50.000> inside

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
living room you can put the wire inside

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.100 
living room you can put the wire inside
anyway<00:04:51.740> it's<00:04:52.639> a<00:04:52.820> niche<00:04:53.150> and<00:04:53.360> you<00:04:53.450> think<00:04:53.810> for

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 
anyway it's a niche and you think for

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.879 
anyway it's a niche and you think for
for<00:04:54.139> the<00:04:54.830> English<00:04:55.250> wheel<00:04:55.460> that<00:04:56.380> you<00:04:57.380> if<00:04:57.770> you

00:04:57.879 --> 00:04:57.889 
for the English wheel that you if you

00:04:57.889 --> 00:04:59.170 
for the English wheel that you if you
already<00:04:58.040> have<00:04:58.370> an<00:04:58.490> English<00:04:58.760> wheel<00:04:58.910> you<00:04:59.150> can

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
already have an English wheel you can

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.870 
already have an English wheel you can
make<00:04:59.450> your<00:04:59.630> own<00:04:59.660> brackets<00:05:00.290> and<00:05:00.500> you<00:05:01.310> can<00:05:01.730> make

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 
make your own brackets and you can make

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.219 
make your own brackets and you can make
up<00:05:02.060> some<00:05:02.290> some<00:05:03.290> rollers<00:05:03.740> of<00:05:03.919> mild<00:05:04.130> steel<00:05:04.280> and

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:05.229 
up some some rollers of mild steel and

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:07.450 
up some some rollers of mild steel and
always<00:05:06.229> have<00:05:06.380> bearings<00:05:06.830> in<00:05:06.979> it<00:05:07.130> you<00:05:07.310> can

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.460 
always have bearings in it you can

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:11.310 
always have bearings in it you can
probably<00:05:07.700> use<00:05:08.229> bronze<00:05:09.229> bushing<00:05:10.160> if<00:05:10.370> you<00:05:10.490> want

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:11.320 
probably use bronze bushing if you want

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.990 
probably use bronze bushing if you want
but<00:05:12.320> it's<00:05:12.500> very<00:05:12.650> simple<00:05:13.100> thing<00:05:13.310> that<00:05:13.340> you<00:05:13.580> can

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
but it's very simple thing that you can

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.879 
but it's very simple thing that you can
make<00:05:14.540> for<00:05:14.780> yourself<00:05:14.870> for<00:05:15.320> your<00:05:15.440> English<00:05:15.590> wheel

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:15.889

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900 
and then you have a tube bender that you

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.990 
and then you have a tube bender that you
can<00:05:18.080> use<00:05:18.229> for<00:05:18.440> something<00:05:18.800> so<00:05:19.490> that<00:05:19.639> was<00:05:19.850> the
