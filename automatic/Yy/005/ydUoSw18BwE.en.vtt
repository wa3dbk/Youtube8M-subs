fix it first of all you're going to want
a<00:00:51.140> piece<00:00:51.320> of<00:00:51.470> sheet<00:00:51.710> metal<00:00:51.890> that's<00:00:52.220> going<00:00:52.430> to

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:52.490 
a piece of sheet metal that's going to

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.480 
a piece of sheet metal that's going to
be<00:00:52.610> a<00:00:52.640> little<00:00:53.090> bit<00:00:53.240> bigger<00:00:53.690> than<00:00:54.590> the<00:00:55.160> rust

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:55.490 
be a little bit bigger than the rust

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.460 
be a little bit bigger than the rust
spot<00:00:55.790> that<00:00:56.060> you're<00:00:56.180> trying<00:00:56.540> to<00:00:56.750> protect<00:00:57.200> here

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
now we've moved some of this sand back

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.460 
now we've moved some of this sand back
in<00:01:01.010> the<00:01:01.130> cove<00:01:01.430> we're<00:01:02.330> going<00:01:02.510> to<00:01:02.630> put<00:01:02.900> our<00:01:03.170> piece

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
in the cove we're going to put our piece

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.800 
in the cove we're going to put our piece
of<00:01:03.500> sheet<00:01:03.920> metal<00:01:03.950> covering<00:01:04.820> these<00:01:05.000> holes<00:01:05.390> and

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
of sheet metal covering these holes and

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.440 
of sheet metal covering these holes and
then<00:01:06.500> we're<00:01:06.710> going<00:01:06.920> to<00:01:07.040> cover<00:01:07.369> the<00:01:07.700> edges<00:01:08.000> of

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
then we're going to cover the edges of

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.690 
then we're going to cover the edges of
the<00:01:08.570> sheet<00:01:08.900> metal<00:01:08.930> up<00:01:09.470> with<00:01:09.770> a<00:01:09.799> several<00:01:10.520> layers

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
the sheet metal up with a several layers

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.390 
the sheet metal up with a several layers
of<00:01:11.000> duct<00:01:11.240> tape<00:01:11.270> to<00:01:12.229> basically<00:01:12.650> protect<00:01:13.009> those

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
of duct tape to basically protect those

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.910 
of duct tape to basically protect those
corners<00:01:13.850> from<00:01:14.030> the<00:01:14.090> liner<00:01:14.470> now<00:01:15.470> here's<00:01:15.770> the

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
corners from the liner now here's the

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.849 
corners from the liner now here's the
thing<00:01:16.159> we're<00:01:16.729> not<00:01:16.970> really<00:01:17.360> fixing<00:01:18.229> this<00:01:18.530> wall

00:01:18.849 --> 00:01:18.859 
thing we're not really fixing this wall

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:22.330 
thing we're not really fixing this wall
what<00:01:19.640> we're<00:01:19.819> doing<00:01:20.210> is<00:01:20.479> we're<00:01:21.039> covering<00:01:22.039> it<00:01:22.159> up

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
what we're doing is we're covering it up

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.719 
what we're doing is we're covering it up
so<00:01:22.759> that<00:01:22.789> those<00:01:23.210> rusty<00:01:23.659> holes<00:01:24.280> don't<00:01:25.280> get<00:01:25.579> on

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
so that those rusty holes don't get on

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:27.940 
so that those rusty holes don't get on
our<00:01:25.909> liner<00:01:26.210> and<00:01:26.630> rub<00:01:26.929> on<00:01:27.109> our<00:01:27.259> liner<00:01:27.499> and<00:01:27.740> put<00:01:27.799> a

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
our liner and rub on our liner and put a

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.069 
our liner and rub on our liner and put a
hole<00:01:28.189> in<00:01:28.399> our<00:01:28.520> liner<00:01:28.819> okay<00:01:29.420> that's<00:01:29.719> what<00:01:29.929> this

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:30.079 
hole in our liner okay that's what this

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:30.609 
hole in our liner okay that's what this
is<00:01:30.289> about

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
is about

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:33.730 
is about
once<00:01:31.340> that<00:01:31.609> wall<00:01:31.909> starts<00:01:32.420> rust<00:01:32.810> and<00:01:33.350> the<00:01:33.469> rust

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
once that wall starts rust and the rust

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.980 
once that wall starts rust and the rust
starts<00:01:34.130> coming<00:01:34.549> through<00:01:34.579> the<00:01:34.850> wall<00:01:35.240> there

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
starts coming through the wall there

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.660 
starts coming through the wall there
really<00:01:36.380> isn't<00:01:36.799> a<00:01:37.189> great<00:01:37.609> repair<00:01:39.249> now<00:01:40.249> you<00:01:40.310> can

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
really isn't a great repair now you can

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.270 
really isn't a great repair now you can
spray<00:01:40.939> it<00:01:40.969> with<00:01:41.600> rust-oleum<00:01:42.200> to<00:01:42.709> keep<00:01:42.950> it<00:01:43.100> from

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
spray it with rust-oleum to keep it from

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.989 
spray it with rust-oleum to keep it from
getting<00:01:43.490> worse<00:01:43.929> but<00:01:44.929> you<00:01:45.139> can't<00:01:45.469> necessarily

00:01:45.989 --> 00:01:45.999 
getting worse but you can't necessarily

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:49.209 
getting worse but you can't necessarily
repair<00:01:46.999> the<00:01:47.240> wall<00:01:47.479> but<00:01:47.899> what<00:01:48.139> you<00:01:48.319> can<00:01:48.649> do<00:01:48.979> is

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:49.219 
repair the wall but what you can do is

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:52.149 
repair the wall but what you can do is
cover<00:01:49.670> the<00:01:49.909> wall<00:01:50.149> up<00:01:50.420> so<00:01:51.200> that<00:01:51.409> it<00:01:51.590> doesn't<00:01:52.069> end

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
cover the wall up so that it doesn't end

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:54.699 
cover the wall up so that it doesn't end
up<00:01:52.369> affecting<00:01:52.609> your<00:01:53.179> liner<00:01:53.539> you<00:01:54.380> know<00:01:54.499> we've

00:01:54.699 --> 00:01:54.709 
up affecting your liner you know we've

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:56.620 
up affecting your liner you know we've
seen<00:01:54.740> it<00:01:55.159> before<00:01:55.189> where<00:01:55.700> you<00:01:55.880> get<00:01:56.090> these<00:01:56.299> holes

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
seen it before where you get these holes

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.749 
seen it before where you get these holes
in<00:01:56.929> the<00:01:57.049> side<00:01:57.289> they<00:01:57.529> puncture<00:01:58.009> your<00:01:58.159> liner<00:01:58.459> and

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
in the side they puncture your liner and

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:01.389 
in the side they puncture your liner and
then<00:01:58.880> water<00:01:59.119> starts<00:01:59.829> squirting<00:02:00.829> out<00:02:01.100> of<00:02:01.310> the

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:01.399 
then water starts squirting out of the

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:04.090 
then water starts squirting out of the
hole<00:02:01.639> in<00:02:01.939> the<00:02:02.029> wall<00:02:02.499> so<00:02:03.499> you<00:02:03.560> want<00:02:03.859> to<00:02:03.950> make

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
hole in the wall so you want to make

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.069 
hole in the wall so you want to make

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:06.079 
sure you cover it up with something and

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:07.870 
sure you cover it up with something and
we're<00:02:06.259> using<00:02:06.649> a<00:02:06.709> big<00:02:06.889> piece<00:02:07.130> of<00:02:07.159> sheet<00:02:07.520> metal

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
we're using a big piece of sheet metal

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.089 
we're using a big piece of sheet metal
here<00:02:08.149> because<00:02:08.600> there<00:02:09.410> was<00:02:09.560> you<00:02:09.679> know<00:02:09.709> four<00:02:10.069> or

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:10.099 
here because there was you know four or

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:11.980 
here because there was you know four or
five<00:02:10.399> little<00:02:10.729> holes<00:02:11.000> right<00:02:11.330> there<00:02:11.390> together

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
five little holes right there together

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.620 
five little holes right there together
and<00:02:12.260> this<00:02:12.349> one<00:02:12.680> piece<00:02:12.950> of<00:02:13.130> sheet<00:02:13.370> metal<00:02:13.630> covers

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
and this one piece of sheet metal covers

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.250 
and this one piece of sheet metal covers
that<00:02:14.840> whole<00:02:15.110> thing<00:02:15.440> up<00:02:16.599> so<00:02:17.599> you<00:02:17.660> see<00:02:17.930> us<00:02:18.050> here

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
that whole thing up so you see us here

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.870 
that whole thing up so you see us here
we're<00:02:18.440> putting<00:02:18.709> this<00:02:18.800> duct<00:02:19.099> tape<00:02:19.310> on<00:02:19.520> it<00:02:19.700> this

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
we're putting this duct tape on it this

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.880 
we're putting this duct tape on it this
is<00:02:20.120> protecting<00:02:20.690> the<00:02:20.780> edges<00:02:21.200> we<00:02:21.349> like<00:02:21.530> to<00:02:21.680> put<00:02:21.860> a

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
is protecting the edges we like to put a

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.190 
is protecting the edges we like to put a
couple<00:02:22.100> layers<00:02:22.460> of<00:02:22.790> duct<00:02:22.970> tape<00:02:23.000> on<00:02:23.570> not<00:02:23.900> just

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
couple layers of duct tape on not just

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.770 
couple layers of duct tape on not just
one<00:02:24.470> because<00:02:25.250> if<00:02:25.490> you<00:02:25.580> only<00:02:25.730> put<00:02:26.030> on<00:02:26.180> one<00:02:26.510> that

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
one because if you only put on one that

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:27.040 
one because if you only put on one that
the

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
the

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.980 
the
the<00:02:27.140> edge<00:02:27.320> of<00:02:27.560> the<00:02:27.850> sheet<00:02:28.850> metal<00:02:29.090> might<00:02:29.600> cut

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
the edge of the sheet metal might cut

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.140 
the edge of the sheet metal might cut
through<00:02:30.440> so<00:02:31.130> you<00:02:31.190> want<00:02:31.490> to<00:02:31.580> put<00:02:31.730> a<00:02:31.760> couple

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
through so you want to put a couple

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.210 
through so you want to put a couple
layers<00:02:32.360> on<00:02:32.690> there<00:02:32.990> and<00:02:33.170> and<00:02:33.410> then<00:02:33.890> of<00:02:34.010> course

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
layers on there and and then of course

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.950 
layers on there and and then of course
as<00:02:34.400> you<00:02:34.520> fill<00:02:34.760> the<00:02:34.940> pool<00:02:35.120> up<00:02:35.480> the<00:02:35.630> way<00:02:35.780> the

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:35.960 
as you fill the pool up the way the

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.870 
as you fill the pool up the way the
water<00:02:36.140> is<00:02:36.380> going<00:02:36.560> to<00:02:36.710> you<00:02:37.130> know<00:02:37.160> push<00:02:37.580> that

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
water is going to you know push that

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.900 
water is going to you know push that
sheet<00:02:38.270> metal<00:02:38.300> against<00:02:39.080> the<00:02:39.230> wall<00:02:39.470> and<00:02:39.910> it's

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
sheet metal against the wall and it's

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.940 
sheet metal against the wall and it's
not<00:02:41.180> going<00:02:41.540> to<00:02:41.660> the<00:02:41.900> sheet<00:02:42.440> metal<00:02:42.620> is<00:02:42.770> not

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
not going to the sheet metal is not

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.350 
not going to the sheet metal is not
going<00:02:43.220> to<00:02:43.280> move<00:02:43.430> once<00:02:43.760> you<00:02:43.850> start<00:02:44.090> getting

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
going to move once you start getting

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.090 
going to move once you start getting
some<00:02:44.420> water<00:02:44.690> in<00:02:44.990> it<00:02:45.020> this<00:02:45.290> is<00:02:45.470> basically<00:02:45.830> going

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
some water in it this is basically going

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.860 
some water in it this is basically going
to<00:02:46.190> hold<00:02:46.400> it<00:02:46.520> real<00:02:46.760> good<00:02:46.970> until<00:02:47.390> that<00:02:47.420> time

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
to hold it real good until that time

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.740 
to hold it real good until that time
comes<00:02:48.400> and<00:02:49.400> then<00:02:49.640> once<00:02:49.850> we've<00:02:50.090> covered<00:02:50.390> it<00:02:50.600> up

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
comes and then once we've covered it up

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.480 
comes and then once we've covered it up
at<00:02:51.050> this<00:02:51.260> point<00:02:51.560> we're<00:02:51.770> just<00:02:51.800> going<00:02:52.070> to<00:02:52.160> smooth
