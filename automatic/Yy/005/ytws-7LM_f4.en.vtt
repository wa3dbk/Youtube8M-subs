00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.980 

I<00:00:09.860> think<00:00:10.860> basically<00:00:11.040> if<00:00:11.790> you<00:00:12.330> don't<00:00:12.540> turn<00:00:12.750> up

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
I think basically if you don't turn up

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.870 
I think basically if you don't turn up
and<00:00:13.259> work<00:00:13.799> hard<00:00:13.830> enough<00:00:14.370> in<00:00:14.549> any<00:00:14.639> given

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
and work hard enough in any given

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.910 
and work hard enough in any given
tournament<00:00:15.540> you<00:00:15.660> won't<00:00:15.839> get<00:00:16.020> any<00:00:16.139> success<00:00:16.619> and

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
tournament you won't get any success and

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.010 
tournament you won't get any success and
that<00:00:16.949> was<00:00:17.460> a<00:00:17.490> was<00:00:18.029> typical<00:00:18.449> of<00:00:18.510> today<00:00:18.840> in

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
that was a was typical of today in

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.859 
that was a was typical of today in
probably<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.439> two<00:00:19.680> games<00:00:19.920> prior<00:00:20.250> to<00:00:20.430> that<00:00:20.580> I

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:20.869 
probably the two games prior to that I

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:23.599 
probably the two games prior to that I
think<00:00:21.869> probably<00:00:22.470> disappointing<00:00:23.310> I<00:00:23.430> mean

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
think probably disappointing I mean

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.439 
think probably disappointing I mean
there<00:00:23.820> I<00:00:25.430> honestly<00:00:26.430> don't<00:00:26.849> believe<00:00:26.970> I<00:00:27.150> shall

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
there I honestly don't believe I shall

I<00:03:54.920> don't<00:03:55.920> think<00:03:56.129> so<00:03:56.340> i<00:03:56.370> think<00:03:56.519> we<00:03:56.849> got<00:03:57.000> players

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
I don't think so i think we got players

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:59.839 
I don't think so i think we got players
here<00:03:57.599> that<00:03:57.629> have<00:03:57.870> not<00:03:58.049> performed<00:03:58.549> you<00:03:59.549> know<00:03:59.670> it

00:03:59.839 --> 00:03:59.849 
here that have not performed you know it

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:03.470 
here that have not performed you know it
i<00:04:00.090> think<00:04:00.980> barring<00:04:01.980> maybe<00:04:02.459> Andre<00:04:02.909> wisdom<00:04:03.120> i

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
i think barring maybe Andre wisdom i

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.750 
i think barring maybe Andre wisdom i
would<00:04:03.870> say<00:04:04.110> his<00:04:04.409> performance<00:04:04.980> tonight<00:04:05.310> that's

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
would say his performance tonight that's

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.490 
would say his performance tonight that's
why<00:04:05.939> i<00:04:05.970> was<00:04:06.209> made<00:04:06.390> captain<00:04:06.629> I<00:04:06.989> think<00:04:07.019> he<00:04:07.319> should

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
why i was made captain I think he should

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.179 
why i was made captain I think he should
be<00:04:07.590> the<00:04:07.709> captain<00:04:07.920> for<00:04:08.250> the<00:04:08.310> next<00:04:08.579> two<00:04:08.730> years<00:04:08.760> I

00:04:10.179 --> 00:04:10.189 
be the captain for the next two years I

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:14.300 
be the captain for the next two years I
think<00:04:11.189> he<00:04:11.310> led<00:04:11.549> by<00:04:11.760> example<00:04:12.030> but<00:04:12.989> in<00:04:13.799> regard<00:04:14.159> to

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
think he led by example but in regard to

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:15.770 
think he led by example but in regard to
players<00:04:14.549> not<00:04:14.760> being<00:04:15.000> here<00:04:15.150> I<00:04:15.180> think<00:04:15.329> blares

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
players not being here I think blares

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.659 
players not being here I think blares
