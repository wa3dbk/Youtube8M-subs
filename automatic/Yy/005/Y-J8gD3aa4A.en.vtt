clamp<00:01:42.680> you<00:01:43.680> simply<00:01:44.040> take<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.460> metal<00:01:44.670> insert

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
clamp you simply take the metal insert

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:47.240 
clamp you simply take the metal insert
through<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.320> hole<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:46.829> you're<00:01:47.040> going<00:01:47.189> to

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
through the hole and you're going to

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.340 
through the hole and you're going to
face<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:48.180> tip<00:01:48.390> of<00:01:48.540> this<00:01:48.659> towards<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.140> back<00:01:49.320> of

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:06.709 

after<00:02:05.369> you're<00:02:05.490> done<00:02:05.579> with<00:02:05.759> this<00:02:05.909> you're

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
after you're done with this you're

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.559 
after you're done with this you're
sawing<00:02:07.020> will<00:02:07.469> all<00:02:07.710> happen<00:02:07.950> right<00:02:08.220> here<00:02:08.550> on<00:02:08.759> the

end of this bench pin one more thing to

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.559 
end of this bench pin one more thing to
think<00:02:12.420> about<00:02:12.480> when<00:02:12.810> you<00:02:12.900> are<00:02:12.930> setting<00:02:13.319> up

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
think about when you are setting up

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.440 
think about when you are setting up
bench<00:02:13.749> pin<00:02:14.019> is<00:02:14.219> whether<00:02:15.219> or<00:02:15.400> not<00:02:15.489> your<00:02:15.819> left<00:02:16.120> or

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
bench pin is whether or not your left or

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.530 
bench pin is whether or not your left or
right-handed<00:02:17.249> if<00:02:18.249> you're<00:02:18.700> right-handed<00:02:18.909> set

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540

your bench pin off to the left just a

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:23.699 
your bench pin off to the left just a
little<00:02:21.849> bit<00:02:21.999> the<00:02:22.689> reason<00:02:22.810> for<00:02:23.079> that<00:02:23.139> is<00:02:23.499> when

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
little bit the reason for that is when

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:25.860 
little bit the reason for that is when
you<00:02:23.829> hold<00:02:24.040> your<00:02:24.189> hand<00:02:24.519> up<00:02:24.670> naturally<00:02:24.909> it'll

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
you hold your hand up naturally it'll

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.410 
you hold your hand up naturally it'll
want<00:02:26.109> to<00:02:26.349> angle<00:02:26.709> off<00:02:26.920> to<00:02:27.219> the<00:02:27.310> left<00:02:27.549> if<00:02:27.819> you're

and<00:02:37.840> it'll<00:02:38.500> allow<00:02:38.680> you<00:02:38.829> to<00:02:39.090> saw<00:02:40.090> much<00:02:40.389> more

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:40.419 
and it'll allow you to saw much more

00:02:40.419 --> 00:02:42.780 
and it'll allow you to saw much more
naturally<00:02:41.079> without<00:02:41.799> having<00:02:41.980> to<00:02:42.370> force<00:02:42.609> your

body off to one side or the other so
I've<00:02:46.419> taken<00:02:46.629> my<00:02:46.930> a<00:02:47.049> permanent<00:02:47.469> marker<00:02:47.769> and

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
I've taken my a permanent marker and

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.959 
I've taken my a permanent marker and
I've<00:02:48.129> made<00:02:48.430> a<00:02:48.459> quick<00:02:49.120> little<00:02:49.659> design<00:02:50.019> on<00:02:50.049> here

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:50.969 
I've made a quick little design on here

00:02:50.969 --> 00:02:53.189 
I've made a quick little design on here
double<00:02:51.969> check<00:02:52.180> to<00:02:52.329> make<00:02:52.359> sure<00:02:52.480> that<00:02:53.019> you've

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:53.199 
double check to make sure that you've

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:56.970 
double check to make sure that you've
used<00:02:53.739> some<00:02:53.949> beeswax<00:02:54.459> on<00:02:54.790> the<00:02:55.719> saw<00:02:55.900> blade<00:02:56.169> the

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
used some beeswax on the saw blade the

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.250 
used some beeswax on the saw blade the
reminder<00:02:57.489> this<00:02:57.819> reduces<00:02:58.389> friction<00:02:58.629> so<00:02:59.019> at<00:02:59.109> any

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260

perpendicular to the silver sheet and
then<00:03:17.530> start<00:03:17.889> sawing<00:03:27.299> now<00:03:28.299> you'll<00:03:28.540> notice<00:03:28.810> that

00:03:29.369 --> 00:03:29.379 
then start sawing now you'll notice that

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:31.530 
then start sawing now you'll notice that
as<00:03:29.680> I'm<00:03:29.859> trying<00:03:30.069> to<00:03:30.220> make<00:03:30.430> this<00:03:30.669> turn<00:03:31.030> I'm

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
as I'm trying to make this turn I'm

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.319 
as I'm trying to make this turn I'm
turning<00:03:32.259> the<00:03:32.470> sheet<00:03:32.739> and<00:03:33.099> not<00:03:33.489> the<00:03:33.759> saw<00:03:33.939> the

turning the sheet and not the saw the

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:37.080 
turning the sheet and not the saw the
sheet<00:03:35.290> you<00:03:35.319> can<00:03:35.769> move<00:03:35.979> and<00:03:36.310> then<00:03:36.729> just<00:03:36.939> have

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
sheet you can move and then just have

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:45.149 
sheet you can move and then just have
the<00:03:37.269> saw<00:03:37.449> blade<00:03:37.750> follow<00:03:38.229> along<00:03:44.009> now<00:03:45.009> when

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:55.359 
sawing and move a little bit slower just

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:57.869 
sawing and move a little bit slower just
like<00:03:55.540> that<00:03:55.720> if<00:03:56.620> at<00:03:56.739> any<00:03:56.859> point<00:03:56.949> in<00:03:57.250> time<00:03:57.280> your

simply<00:04:01.599> unscrew<00:04:01.780> one<00:04:02.739> of<00:04:02.859> the<00:04:02.949> wing<00:04:03.099> nuts<00:04:03.419> that

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:04.419 
simply unscrew one of the wing nuts that

00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:06.479 
simply unscrew one of the wing nuts that
will<00:04:04.569> release<00:04:04.840> the<00:04:04.870> saw<00:04:05.319> blade<00:04:05.739> and<00:04:06.040> just

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489 
will release the saw blade and just

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:11.129 
will release the saw blade and just
release<00:04:06.790> it<00:04:07.139> from<00:04:08.139> the<00:04:08.349> sheet<00:04:09.599> have<00:04:10.599> a<00:04:10.870> small

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:11.139 
release it from the sheet have a small

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:13.080 
release it from the sheet have a small
brush<00:04:11.349> sitting<00:04:12.099> off<00:04:12.250> to<00:04:12.400> the<00:04:12.519> sides<00:04:12.729> that<00:04:13.060> you

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
brush sitting off to the sides that you

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:14.640 
brush sitting off to the sides that you
can<00:04:13.329> whisk<00:04:13.569> away<00:04:13.840> some<00:04:14.109> of<00:04:14.139> these<00:04:14.289> metal

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
can whisk away some of these metal

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.170 
can whisk away some of these metal
shavings<00:04:14.859> it's<00:04:15.250> never<00:04:15.459> a<00:04:15.519> really<00:04:15.789> good<00:04:15.909> idea

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
shavings it's never a really good idea

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.129 
shavings it's never a really good idea
just<00:04:16.389> to<00:04:16.509> inhale<00:04:16.870> and<00:04:17.139> blow<00:04:18.690> you<00:04:19.690> might<00:04:19.870> spread

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:20.139 
just to inhale and blow you might spread

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:21.509 
just to inhale and blow you might spread
those<00:04:20.380> shavings<00:04:20.769> someplace<00:04:21.130> and<00:04:21.250> that's<00:04:21.370> not

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 
those shavings someplace and that's not

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:23.820 
those shavings someplace and that's not
a<00:04:21.579> good<00:04:21.729> idea<00:04:21.900> so<00:04:22.900> this<00:04:23.139> is<00:04:23.440> what<00:04:23.590> we're<00:04:23.710> left

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
a good idea so this is what we're left

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.730 
a good idea so this is what we're left
with<00:04:24.000> and<00:04:25.000> as<00:04:25.240> you<00:04:25.360> can<00:04:25.510> see<00:04:25.690> the<00:04:26.139> edges<00:04:26.500> are<00:04:26.680> a

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
with and as you can see the edges are a

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.820 
with and as you can see the edges are a
little<00:04:26.979> bit<00:04:27.370> rough<00:04:27.960> so<00:04:28.960> simply<00:04:29.320> take<00:04:29.560> your

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
little bit rough so simply take your

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.360 
little bit rough so simply take your
flat<00:04:30.279> file<00:04:30.520> right<00:04:30.849> here<00:04:31.710> and<00:04:32.710> you'll<00:04:32.860> hold<00:04:33.159> it

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
flat file right here and you'll hold it

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.279 
flat file right here and you'll hold it
again<00:04:33.940> onto<00:04:34.449> the<00:04:34.539> bench<00:04:34.690> pin<00:04:34.900> now<00:04:35.050> you<00:04:35.110> can

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:35.289 
again onto the bench pin now you can

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:37.050 
again onto the bench pin now you can
hold<00:04:35.469> it<00:04:35.560> over<00:04:35.740> here<00:04:36.070> or<00:04:36.310> over<00:04:36.490> here<00:04:36.520> you<00:04:36.909> can

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
hold it over here or over here you can

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:38.430 
hold it over here or over here you can
work<00:04:37.210> in<00:04:37.330> the<00:04:37.449> center<00:04:37.659> it's<00:04:37.930> completely

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
work in the center it's completely

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.200 
work in the center it's completely
whatever<00:04:38.770> makes<00:04:39.340> you<00:04:39.430> more<00:04:39.580> comfortable<00:04:40.029> and
