00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
reviewing a lot of this hardware so i'm

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.110 
reviewing a lot of this hardware so i'm
not<00:00:13.530> going<00:00:13.679> to<00:00:13.740> be<00:00:13.860> talking<00:00:14.160> about<00:00:14.400> it<00:00:14.730> too

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
much also a lot of this hardware is for

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.220 
much also a lot of this hardware is for
a<00:00:19.380> client<00:00:19.859> build<00:00:20.600> alright<00:00:21.600> so<00:00:21.810> i'll<00:00:21.930> start

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
a client build alright so i'll start

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.330 
a client build alright so i'll start
with<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.380> case<00:00:22.650> so<00:00:23.460> this<00:00:23.760> is<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.090> silverstone

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:25.340 
with the case so this is the silverstone

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.429 
with the case so this is the silverstone
tempting<00:00:26.340> TJ<00:00:27.000> 08<00:00:27.269> E<00:00:27.449> and<00:00:27.960> it's<00:00:28.920> an<00:00:29.039> M<00:00:29.220> ATX<00:00:29.730> case
