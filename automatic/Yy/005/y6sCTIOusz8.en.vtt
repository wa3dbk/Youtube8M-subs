00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
that now you're on second as the season

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.180 
that now you're on second as the season
here<00:02:27.700> so<00:02:27.940> how<00:02:28.450> was<00:02:28.630> the<00:02:28.900> first<00:02:29.200> time<00:02:29.830> you<00:02:30.010> came

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
here so how was the first time you came

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.040 
here so how was the first time you came
here<00:02:30.430> and<00:02:30.670> this<00:02:30.880> is<00:02:31.030> different<00:02:31.210> than<00:02:31.480> you<00:02:31.780> come

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
here and this is different than you come

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.230 
here and this is different than you come
second<00:02:32.410> time<00:02:32.530> um<00:02:32.830> it<00:02:33.550> might<00:02:33.730> it<00:02:33.910> might<00:02:34.060> be

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
second time um it might it might be

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.640 
second time um it might it might be
better<00:02:34.450> I<00:02:34.540> think<00:02:34.810> every<00:02:35.020> time<00:02:35.170> I<00:02:35.230> come<00:02:35.500> back
