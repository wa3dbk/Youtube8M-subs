00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.049
 amazing 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.670
 I'm going to go around the town a little 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.610
 that you can see what is each 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:09.640
 one 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.640
 wonderful town very beautiful 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:19.439
 two years ago I was here identified 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:21.719
 and this station he was a playground 

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:24.120
 trucks and look how I change 

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:27.959
 what is all this 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:30.200
 if we look at the picana video of 15 ago 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.200
 2 years 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:37.640
 from the service station 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:41.560
 I came with my eyes closed ready 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:43.180
 to camp in this place 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.300
 and I find that the beach does not 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.650
 I was more and good and gaming was not 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:50.520
 so I had to camp where they 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.520
 I showed a little while ago 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:04:01.140
 I'm going on that route 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:01.140
 looking to cross the border to bolivia 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.520
 every time you cross the border to 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:09.540
 I am a 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:11.520
 like a delivery because good I had the 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:15.230
 feeling that you know I could not 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.230
 cross for ushuaia 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.620
 I'm going to walk a little bit first 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:23.350
 this town 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.410
 Every night you see all lights and you're in 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:29.060
 the mountain 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.060
 last night a villager told me 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.500
 that I could camp next to the river - 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:36.870
 mansion he did I forgot the 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.860
 rivers by her the night grow 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:43.169
 and you imagine 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:43.169
 sleeping in the tent and blow 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:50.360
 that water comes over 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.490
 it would be terrible not 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:55.009
 they are details that one out there not being 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:58.370
 every day been the same forget 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:05:01.129
 but it 's important not to camp on the shores 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:02.810
 in rivers or streams look what 

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:05.300
 beautiful view that has everything is full 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:08.500
 of houses but it's amazing how 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.500
 grown this town 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:15.090
 a beauty 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:17.789
 and surprising the great growth that 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:19.940
 had everything surrounded by mountain measures everything 

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:19.940
 around 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:26.410
 beautiful the landscape to come here 

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:29.970
 Route 9 has glorious moments on 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:32.230
 step by jump step because I and 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:36.419
 will maimarÃ¡ all these places are 

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:36.419
 very beautiful 

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:52.339
 once is this good place makes me 

00:05:48.779 --> 00:05:52.339
 remember what they have to leave 

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:57.810
 this is the tilcara river 

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:07.810
 one of the graces of this place is 

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:09.930
 prepare the mountain so we have places 

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:13.490
 as 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:13.490
 the throat of the devil 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:19.830
 there is no way 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.860
 and others
