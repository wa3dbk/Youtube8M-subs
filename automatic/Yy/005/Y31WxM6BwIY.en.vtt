00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:46.860 
robots ears in those days so yeah you

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.730 
robots ears in those days so yeah you
came<00:05:47.130> out<00:05:47.400> and<00:05:47.699> you<00:05:47.760> were<00:05:48.750> battering<00:05:49.500> that

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 
came out and you were battering that

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:54.469 
came out and you were battering that
robot<00:05:50.190> and<00:05:50.490> then<00:05:51.449> one<00:05:52.370> well<00:05:53.370> I<00:05:53.400> lost<00:05:53.490> a<00:05:53.669> belt

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:54.479

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:56.330 
robot and then one well I lost a belt
they'd<00:05:54.990> obvious<00:05:55.410> lost<00:05:55.650> the<00:05:55.770> drive<00:05:55.979> to<00:05:56.190> their

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:56.340 
they'd obvious lost the drive to their

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:57.980 
they'd obvious lost the drive to their
disk<00:05:56.610> as<00:05:56.790> well<00:05:56.970> but<00:05:57.150> we<00:05:57.300> probably<00:05:57.449> should<00:05:57.690> try

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:57.990 
disk as well but we probably should try

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:59.150 
disk as well but we probably should try
to<00:05:58.050> cut<00:05:58.290> them<00:05:58.380> in<00:05:58.440> half<00:05:58.590> before<00:05:58.800> then<00:05:59.100> I

00:05:59.150 --> 00:05:59.160 
to cut them in half before then I

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.780 
to cut them in half before then I
suppose<00:05:59.370> yeah<00:05:59.699> even<00:06:00.419> a<00:06:01.050> bit<00:06:01.889> like<00:06:02.160> it<00:06:02.520> was<00:06:02.610> like

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:02.790 
suppose yeah even a bit like it was like

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:04.159 
suppose yeah even a bit like it was like

and though there were there in the next

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:11.240 
and though there were there in the next
bit<00:06:09.449> before<00:06:09.720> the<00:06:09.840> belt<00:06:10.020> wins<00:06:10.199> so<00:06:10.440> all<00:06:11.040> right

yeah I mean it's like what you proved in
Robot<00:06:26.330> Wars<00:06:26.360> extreme<00:06:27.050> you've<00:06:27.830> got<00:06:28.040> such<00:06:28.370> a

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:28.700 
Robot Wars extreme you've got such a

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:30.910 
Robot Wars extreme you've got such a
good<00:06:28.940> motor<00:06:29.330> in<00:06:29.780> that<00:06:30.050> robot<00:06:30.410> it<00:06:30.560> just<00:06:30.710> keeps

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:30.920 
good motor in that robot it just keeps

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:33.970 
good motor in that robot it just keeps
going<00:06:31.070> on<00:06:31.400> and<00:06:31.460> on<00:06:31.820> and<00:06:32.450> on<00:06:32.840> well<00:06:33.500> that's<00:06:33.740> got<00:06:33.950> a

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:33.980 
going on and on and on well that's got a

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:35.680 
going on and on and on well that's got a
long<00:06:34.130> long<00:06:34.580> life<00:06:34.850> and<00:06:35.180> I<00:06:35.240> suppose<00:06:35.540> that's

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:35.690 
long long life and I suppose that's

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:37.270 
long long life and I suppose that's
where<00:06:35.900> he<00:06:35.960> picks<00:06:36.170> up<00:06:36.290> the<00:06:36.410> points<00:06:36.830> afterwards

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:37.280 
where he picks up the points afterwards

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.440 
where he picks up the points afterwards
because<00:06:37.430> they're<00:06:37.550> the<00:06:37.670> merely<00:06:37.880> gave<00:06:38.120> us<00:06:38.300> a

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:38.450 
because they're the merely gave us a

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:40.960 
because they're the merely gave us a
beating<00:06:38.810> at<00:06:38.900> the<00:06:38.930> beginning<00:06:39.440> hopefully<00:06:40.310> we

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:40.970 
beating at the beginning hopefully we

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:42.280 
beating at the beginning hopefully we
keep<00:06:41.120> on<00:06:41.390> going<00:06:41.570> to<00:06:41.810> the<00:06:41.930> end<00:06:42.110> okay

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:42.290 
keep on going to the end okay
