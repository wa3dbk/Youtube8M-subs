see that that's metal though that's
metal<00:02:30.170> so<00:02:31.170> you<00:02:31.260> put<00:02:31.620> these<00:02:31.799> weights<00:02:32.129> you

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
metal so you put these weights you

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.880 
metal so you put these weights you
actually<00:02:32.760> put<00:02:33.390> the<00:02:33.510> weights<00:02:33.690> on<00:02:33.900> you<00:02:34.530> can<00:02:34.709> put

hamid / wait how much weights you want
actually<00:02:38.610> out<00:02:38.730> there<00:02:39.140> depends<00:02:40.140> are<00:02:40.440> you<00:02:40.950> know

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:41.129 
actually out there depends are you know

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:43.849 
actually out there depends are you know

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
actually and this basically makes it a

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.360 
actually and this basically makes it a
little<00:02:48.599> bit<00:02:48.810> more<00:02:49.079> stable<00:02:49.349> for<00:02:49.890> like<00:02:50.040> those

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
little bit more stable for like those

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.349 
little bit more stable for like those
heavy<00:02:50.640> computer<00:02:51.209> gamers<00:02:51.660> that<00:02:51.840> are<00:02:51.989> right<00:02:53.359> so

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:54.359 
heavy computer gamers that are right so

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:56.509 
heavy computer gamers that are right so
if<00:02:54.930> you<00:02:55.019> put<00:02:55.200> on<00:02:55.379> more<00:02:55.680> it's<00:02:56.190> going<00:02:56.310> to<00:02:56.430> move

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
if you put on more it's going to move

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.430 
if you put on more it's going to move
slower<00:02:57.090> if<00:02:57.450> you<00:02:57.540> put<00:02:57.690> unless<00:02:58.019> it's<00:02:58.230> going<00:02:58.379> to

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
slower if you put unless it's going to

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.890 
slower if you put unless it's going to
move<00:02:58.530> faster<00:02:59.250> he<00:02:59.849> put<00:03:00.060> on<00:03:00.150> just<00:03:00.359> enough<00:03:00.690> it's

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
move faster he put on just enough it's

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.770 
move faster he put on just enough it's
going<00:03:01.049> to<00:03:01.109> be<00:03:01.200> just<00:03:01.739> great<00:03:02.159> and<00:03:02.700> I<00:03:03.390> just<00:03:03.599> put

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
is metal and stuff if you drop it it

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.740 
is metal and stuff if you drop it it
won't<00:04:36.040> nothing<00:04:36.520> will<00:04:36.640> happen<00:04:36.940> to<00:04:36.970> it<00:04:37.120> this

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
won't nothing will happen to it this

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.980 
won't nothing will happen to it this
goes<00:04:37.990> a<00:04:38.020> page<00:04:38.440> forward<00:04:39.270> here<00:04:40.270> you<00:04:40.390> can<00:04:40.540> scroll

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 
goes a page forward here you can scroll

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.770 
goes a page forward here you can scroll
and<00:04:41.260> what<00:04:41.500> this<00:04:41.650> does<00:04:41.710> is<00:04:42.250> that<00:04:43.090> it<00:04:43.150> it

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
and what this does is that it it

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.440 
and what this does is that it it
actually<00:04:44.230> changes<00:04:44.770> your<00:04:45.550> weapons<00:04:46.000> and<00:04:46.270> stuff

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:46.450 
actually changes your weapons and stuff

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:48.860 
actually changes your weapons and stuff
like<00:04:46.630> that<00:04:46.690> so<00:04:47.050> it's<00:04:47.170> a<00:04:47.200> little<00:04:47.380> bit<00:04:47.530> faster

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
like that so it's a little bit faster

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.360 
like that so it's a little bit faster
and<00:04:49.870> like<00:04:50.080> call<00:04:50.350> of<00:04:50.380> duty<00:04:50.770> and<00:04:51.130> like<00:04:51.160> that

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
and like call of duty and like that

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.180 
and like call of duty and like that
here<00:04:52.090> is<00:04:52.240> a<00:04:52.270> red<00:04:52.870> wire<00:04:53.110> I<00:04:53.140> don't<00:04:53.740> know<00:04:53.860> if<00:04:54.040> you

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
here is a red wire I don't know if you

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:56.730 
here is a red wire I don't know if you
see<00:04:54.400> that<00:04:54.580> yeah<00:04:55.120> so<00:04:55.660> that<00:04:56.050> is<00:04:56.260> a<00:04:56.290> red<00:04:56.530> wire

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:56.740 
see that yeah so that is a red wire

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.950 
see that yeah so that is a red wire
actually<00:04:57.310> so<00:04:58.090> it's<00:04:58.240> just<00:04:58.420> a<00:04:58.540> little<00:04:58.690> bit

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
actually so it's just a little bit

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.690 
actually so it's just a little bit
faster<00:04:59.320> because<00:04:59.470> of<00:04:59.650> that<00:04:59.770> wire<00:05:00.010> transfers

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:00.700 
faster because of that wire transfers

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.970 
faster because of that wire transfers
the<00:05:00.850> movement<00:05:01.330> to<00:05:01.630> hear<00:05:02.320> the<00:05:02.470> electrical

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:02.980 
the movement to hear the electrical

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:06.120 
the movement to hear the electrical
movement<00:05:03.630> land<00:05:04.630> here<00:05:05.200> if<00:05:05.500> you<00:05:05.620> can<00:05:05.800> see

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.130 
movement land here if you can see

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:08.850 
movement land here if you can see
there's<00:05:06.520> actually<00:05:07.150> four<00:05:07.540> LED<00:05:08.200> lights<00:05:08.470> there's

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:08.860 
there's actually four LED lights there's

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.340 
there's actually four LED lights there's
two<00:05:09.070> right<00:05:09.280> now<00:05:09.460> here<00:05:10.450> is<00:05:10.570> a<00:05:10.600> button<00:05:10.900> for

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:11.350 
two right now here is a button for

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:16.860 
two right now here is a button for
increasing<00:05:11.950> 3<00:05:12.940> 4<00:05:13.890> 3<00:05:14.890> 2<00:05:15.550> 1<00:05:16.060> and<00:05:16.300> what<00:05:16.510> that<00:05:16.540> is

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:16.870 
increasing 3 4 3 2 1 and what that is

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.670 
increasing 3 4 3 2 1 and what that is
one<00:05:17.170> is<00:05:17.410> that<00:05:17.830> the<00:05:18.130> mouse<00:05:18.310> goes<00:05:18.580> really<00:05:18.970> slow

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 
one is that the mouse goes really slow

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.190 
one is that the mouse goes really slow
to<00:05:20.680> its<00:05:20.950> average<00:05:21.570> three<00:05:22.570> it's<00:05:22.720> a<00:05:22.780> little<00:05:23.050> bit

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:23.200 
to its average three it's a little bit

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:30.960 
to its average three it's a little bit
fast<00:05:23.470> and<00:05:23.680> then<00:05:23.830> 4<00:05:26.100> so<00:05:27.100> 4<00:05:28.080> is<00:05:29.080> just<00:05:29.410> insane<00:05:30.010> it

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:30.970 
fast and then 4 so 4 is just insane it

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:34.830 
fast and then 4 so 4 is just insane it
will<00:05:31.240> go<00:05:31.450> super<00:05:32.380> fast<00:05:32.430> detection<00:05:33.690> around<00:05:34.690> the

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:34.840 
will go super fast detection around the

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.350 
will go super fast detection around the
screen<00:05:35.110> whatever<00:05:35.470> i<00:05:36.040> like<00:05:36.580> to<00:05:36.730> use<00:05:36.790> to<00:05:37.120> since

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 
screen whatever i like to use to since

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.010 
screen whatever i like to use to since
its<00:05:37.540> average<00:05:37.690> and<00:05:38.170> that<00:05:38.860> is<00:05:39.010> for<00:05:39.280> like<00:05:39.490> again

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020 
its average and that is for like again

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.690 
its average and that is for like again
aiming<00:05:41.020> down<00:05:41.560> your<00:05:41.800> sights<00:05:42.070> and<00:05:42.370> like<00:05:42.460> call<00:05:42.670> of
