00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
you're going to want to draw the last

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.270 
you're going to want to draw the last
petal<00:01:10.290> which<00:01:11.100> is<00:01:11.280> just<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:12.590> curved<00:01:13.590> line<00:01:13.800> there

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
petal which is just a curved line there

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.380 
petal which is just a curved line there
like<00:01:14.520> that<00:01:16.580> then<00:01:17.580> you're<00:01:18.000> going<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.180> want<00:01:18.300> to

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
like that then you're going to want to

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.800 
like that then you're going to want to
draw<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.630> stem<00:01:19.100> which<00:01:20.100> is<00:01:20.400> between<00:01:21.360> these<00:01:21.600> two

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
draw the stem which is between these two

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:31.150 
draw the stem which is between these two
petals<00:01:22.020> here<00:01:22.320> off<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.800> the<00:01:22.920> side<00:01:27.590> and<00:01:29.000> then

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:31.160 
petals here off to the side and then

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
petals here off to the side and then
after<00:01:32.160> that<00:01:32.280> you're<00:01:32.550> going<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.729> want<00:01:32.910> to<00:01:32.970> draw

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
after that you're going to want to draw

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.749 
after that you're going to want to draw
a<00:01:33.390> leaf<00:01:34.250> which<00:01:35.250> is<00:01:35.280> just<00:01:35.820> a<00:01:37.160> line<00:01:38.160> there<00:01:38.550> and

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
a leaf which is just a line there and

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.530 
a leaf which is just a line there and
then<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.360> bottom<00:01:39.720> line<00:01:39.900> and<00:01:40.910> this<00:01:41.910> first<00:01:42.240> line

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
then the bottom line and this first line

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.290 
then the bottom line and this first line
is<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:43.100> little<00:01:44.100> longer<00:01:44.340> than<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.820> second<00:01:45.180> line

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:45.300 
is a little longer than the second line

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.850 
is a little longer than the second line
and<00:01:45.540> then<00:01:45.690> you<00:01:45.810> can<00:01:45.840> just<00:01:46.110> connect<00:01:46.410> the<00:01:46.530> second

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
and then you can just connect the second

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.190 
and then you can just connect the second
line<00:01:46.979> there<00:01:48.080> then<00:01:49.080> you<00:01:49.410> draw<00:01:49.619> another<00:01:49.830> line

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
line there then you draw another line

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.170 
line there then you draw another line
that's<00:01:52.200> in<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.649> line<00:01:52.860> with<00:01:53.340> this<00:01:53.550> line<00:01:53.610> so

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
that's in the line with this line so

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.359 
that's in the line with this line so
it's<00:01:54.330> the<00:01:54.509> same<00:01:54.750> curve<00:01:55.080> as<00:01:55.320> that<00:01:55.560> first<00:01:56.070> line

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
it's the same curve as that first line

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.400 
it's the same curve as that first line
there<00:01:57.200> then<00:01:58.200> you<00:01:58.770> just<00:01:59.009> add<00:01:59.310> two<00:02:00.410> smaller

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:01.410 
there then you just add two smaller

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.740 
there then you just add two smaller
lines<00:02:01.740> on<00:02:02.009> each<00:02:02.130> side<00:02:02.460> and<00:02:02.700> that<00:02:02.759> is<00:02:03.570> how<00:02:03.600> you

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
lines on each side and that is how you

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.080 
lines on each side and that is how you
draw<00:02:03.990> a<00:02:04.050> cartoon<00:02:04.320> flower<00:02:04.970> thanks<00:02:05.970> for
