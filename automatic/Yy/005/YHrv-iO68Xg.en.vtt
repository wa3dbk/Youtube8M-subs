the<00:01:13.540> end<00:01:13.750> case<00:01:13.990> which<00:01:14.290> is<00:01:14.470> a<00:01:14.500> very<00:01:14.650> similar

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.010 
the end case which is a very similar

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:16.680 
the end case which is a very similar
case<00:01:15.220> to<00:01:15.400> this<00:01:15.580> that<00:01:16.030> sells<00:01:16.240> for<00:01:16.390> the<00:01:16.510> same

I<00:01:19.420> didn't<00:01:19.720> like<00:01:19.840> about<00:01:19.870> the<00:01:20.110> in<00:01:20.290> case<00:01:20.500> and<00:01:20.680> I

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
I didn't like about the in case and I

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.649 
I didn't like about the in case and I
immediately<00:01:20.890> went<00:01:21.250> over<00:01:21.490> and<00:01:21.700> got<00:01:21.729> this<00:01:22.060> now

that<00:01:29.439> in<00:01:29.560> a<00:01:29.680> minute<00:01:29.770> but<00:01:29.920> that<00:01:30.130> that<00:01:30.640> does<00:01:30.820> come

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
that in a minute but that that does come

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.050 
that in a minute but that that does come
with<00:01:31.119> it<00:01:31.270> for<00:01:31.420> 3499<00:01:32.049> this<00:01:32.740> this<00:01:33.460> case<00:01:33.670> as<00:01:33.939> you

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
with it for 3499 this this case as you
