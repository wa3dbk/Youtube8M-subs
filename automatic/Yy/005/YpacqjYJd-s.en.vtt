00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500 
look at it it's identical so it's like a

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.890

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.470 
i'm glad they don't give those little
cheap<00:04:40.660> ones<00:04:41.130> so<00:04:42.130> what<00:04:42.280> you<00:04:42.400> do<00:04:42.520> is<00:04:42.550> you<00:04:43.180> take

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:43.480 
cheap ones so what you do is you take

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:48.000 
cheap ones so what you do is you take
the<00:04:43.690> brow<00:04:45.780> you<00:04:46.780> can't<00:04:47.050> see<00:04:47.260> the<00:04:47.380> powder<00:04:47.590> at<00:04:47.860> all

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.010 
the brow you can't see the powder at all

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:50.490 
the brow you can't see the powder at all
because<00:04:48.220> I<00:04:48.490> put<00:04:48.760> it<00:04:48.850> over<00:04:49.030> the<00:04:49.360> liner<00:04:49.750> and<00:04:50.020> i

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
because I put it over the liner and i

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.240 
because I put it over the liner and i
also<00:04:50.710> put<00:04:51.070> it<00:04:51.190> on<00:04:52.380> next<00:04:53.380> to<00:04:53.440> you<00:04:53.560> can<00:04:53.710> kind<00:04:54.100> of

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
also put it on next to you can kind of

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:57.330 
also put it on next to you can kind of
see<00:04:54.460> it<00:04:54.810> it's<00:04:55.810> really<00:04:56.260> light<00:04:56.500> I<00:04:56.800> wouldn't
