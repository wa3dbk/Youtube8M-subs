Rev<00:00:20.820> um<00:00:21.260> so<00:00:22.260> I<00:00:22.500> usually<00:00:23.250> don't<00:00:23.340> play<00:00:23.519> my<00:00:23.670> heavy

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
Rev um so I usually don't play my heavy

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.730 
Rev um so I usually don't play my heavy
assault<00:00:24.150> that<00:00:24.300> much<00:00:24.510> but<00:00:24.869> when<00:00:25.050> I<00:00:25.109> do<00:00:25.230> is

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
assault that much but when I do is

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.679 
assault that much but when I do is
usually<00:00:26.400> only<00:00:26.550> to<00:00:26.760> use<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.060> rocket<00:00:27.359> launchers

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
usually only to use the rocket launchers

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.419 
usually only to use the rocket launchers
that's<00:00:28.260> really<00:00:28.680> about<00:00:28.769> it<00:00:29.130> I<00:00:29.250> don't

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
that's really about it I don't

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.490 
that's really about it I don't
particularly<00:00:29.789> like<00:00:30.119> heavy<00:00:30.750> assault<00:00:31.019> nor<00:00:31.289> do<00:00:31.439> I

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
particularly like heavy assault nor do I

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.340 
particularly like heavy assault nor do I
play<00:00:31.679> that<00:00:31.859> much<00:00:32.009> but<00:00:32.250> today<00:00:32.550> um<00:00:32.820> I<00:00:33.719> ended<00:00:34.290> up

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
play that much but today um I ended up

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.920 
play that much but today um I ended up
trying<00:00:34.590> out<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:35.040> NC<00:00:35.370> 15<00:00:35.730> Phoenix<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.239> I<00:00:36.719> gotta

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
trying out the NC 15 Phoenix and I gotta

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.660 
trying out the NC 15 Phoenix and I gotta
say<00:00:37.079> I<00:00:37.110> liked<00:00:37.469> it<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:37.680> lot<00:00:37.829> so<00:00:38.219> much<00:00:38.280> that<00:00:38.430> I'm

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
say I liked it a lot so much that I'm

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.160 
say I liked it a lot so much that I'm
probably<00:00:38.850> going<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.180> end<00:00:39.210> up<00:00:39.420> saving<00:00:39.690> up<00:00:39.870> certs

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
probably going to end up saving up certs

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.310 
probably going to end up saving up certs
to<00:00:40.379> get<00:00:40.559> it<00:00:40.710> um<00:00:41.420> so<00:00:42.420> right<00:00:42.690> away<00:00:42.780> you<00:00:42.899> can<00:00:43.140> tell

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
to get it um so right away you can tell

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.830 
to get it um so right away you can tell
that<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.710> NC<00:00:44.100> 15<00:00:44.610> is<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:44.910> rocket<00:00:45.480> guided

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
that the NC 15 is a rocket guided

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.350 
that the NC 15 is a rocket guided
missile<00:00:46.289> you<00:00:47.250> guide<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.670> rocket<00:00:47.969> yourself

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
missile you guide the rocket yourself

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.690 
missile you guide the rocket yourself
which<00:00:48.510> i<00:00:48.600> think<00:00:48.690> is<00:00:48.930> pretty<00:00:49.500> cool<00:00:49.649> I<00:00:49.920> mean<00:00:50.100> it's

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
which i think is pretty cool I mean it's

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.490 
which i think is pretty cool I mean it's
probably<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:51.030> best<00:00:51.180> part<00:00:51.390> about<00:00:51.480> it<00:00:51.840> uh<00:00:51.989> you

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
probably the best part about it uh you

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.170 
probably the best part about it uh you
don't<00:00:52.590> miss<00:00:52.829> very<00:00:52.860> often<00:00:53.520> as<00:00:53.640> long<00:00:53.789> as<00:00:53.969> you

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
don't miss very often as long as you

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.470 
don't miss very often as long as you
cannot<00:00:54.860> direct<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.070> rocket<00:00:56.910> towards<00:00:57.149> the

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
cannot direct the rocket towards the

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.590 
cannot direct the rocket towards the
actual<00:00:57.629> target<00:00:58.199> uh<00:00:58.430> but<00:00:59.430> so<00:00:59.699> far<00:00:59.910> I've<00:01:00.210> loved

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
actual target uh but so far I've loved

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.869 
actual target uh but so far I've loved
it<00:01:00.750> I<00:01:00.899> used<00:01:01.649> it<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:01.890> take<00:01:02.039> out<00:01:02.250> a<00:01:02.280> bunch<00:01:02.670> of

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
it I used it to take out a bunch of

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.660 
it I used it to take out a bunch of
freaking<00:01:03.320> thunders<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.739> prowlers<00:01:05.339> while<00:01:05.580> we

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
freaking thunders and prowlers while we

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.480 
freaking thunders and prowlers while we
were<00:01:05.729> fighting<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.090> TR<00:01:06.590> during<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.680> alert<00:01:07.920> so

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
were fighting the TR during the alert so

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.310 
were fighting the TR during the alert so
compared<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:08.970> some<00:01:09.150> of<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.270> other<00:01:09.330> rocket

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
compared to some of the other rocket

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.960 
compared to some of the other rocket
launchers<00:01:10.710> that<00:01:10.920> we<00:01:11.040> have<00:01:11.220> over<00:01:11.250> in<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.670> NC

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
launchers that we have over in the NC

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.750 
launchers that we have over in the NC
the<00:01:12.869> Phoenix<00:01:13.650> has<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:13.890> relatively<00:01:14.310> lower

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
the Phoenix has a relatively lower

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.420 
the Phoenix has a relatively lower
damage<00:01:15.750> rate<00:01:16.110> which<00:01:16.530> isn't<00:01:16.830> too<00:01:16.950> bad<00:01:17.100> if<00:01:17.310> you

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
damage rate which isn't too bad if you

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.499 
damage rate which isn't too bad if you
get<00:01:17.549> a<00:01:17.580> couple<00:01:17.909> of<00:01:18.000> them<00:01:18.119> lined<00:01:18.270> up<00:01:18.360> together

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
get a couple of them lined up together

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.060 
get a couple of them lined up together
and<00:01:18.720> you'll<00:01:19.020> hit<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.259> same<00:01:19.470> target<00:01:19.860> you'll

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
and you'll hit the same target you'll

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.469 
and you'll hit the same target you'll
end<00:01:20.220> up<00:01:20.280> taking<00:01:20.549> it<00:01:20.640> down<00:01:20.790> relatively<00:01:21.180> quickly

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
end up taking it down relatively quickly

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.560 
end up taking it down relatively quickly
so<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.350> reload<00:01:22.650> speed<00:01:22.920> in<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.580> fire<00:01:24.060> rate<00:01:24.360> R

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
so the reload speed in the fire rate R

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.060 
so the reload speed in the fire rate R
is<00:01:24.840> pretty<00:01:25.110> much<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.290> same<00:01:25.560> as<00:01:25.770> every<00:01:26.040> other

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
is pretty much the same as every other

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.490 
is pretty much the same as every other
rocket<00:01:26.549> that<00:01:26.670> we<00:01:26.820> have<00:01:27.000> but<00:01:27.659> uh<00:01:27.720> I<00:01:28.110> think<00:01:28.229> the

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
rocket that we have but uh I think the

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.050 
rocket that we have but uh I think the
thing<00:01:28.680> that<00:01:28.740> sets<00:01:29.040> us<00:01:29.159> apart<00:01:29.280> from<00:01:29.549> every

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
thing that sets us apart from every

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.550 
thing that sets us apart from every
other<00:01:30.119> rocket<00:01:30.540> launcher<00:01:30.810> we<00:01:30.960> have<00:01:31.110> is<00:01:31.320> the

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
other rocket launcher we have is the

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.340 
other rocket launcher we have is the
fact<00:01:31.740> that<00:01:31.799> you<00:01:32.130> can<00:01:32.310> get<00:01:32.490> it<00:01:32.670> yourself<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:33.350> if

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
fact that you can get it yourself and if

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.130 
fact that you can get it yourself and if
you<00:01:34.409> end<00:01:35.040> up<00:01:35.189> you<00:01:35.340> know<00:01:35.570> missing<00:01:36.570> your<00:01:36.780> target

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
you end up you know missing your target

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.410 
you end up you know missing your target
by<00:01:37.290> just<00:01:37.860> that<00:01:38.130> little<00:01:38.340> bit<00:01:38.490> you<00:01:39.119> can<00:01:39.299> adjust

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
by just that little bit you can adjust

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.920 
by just that little bit you can adjust
and<00:01:40.140> end<00:01:41.009> up<00:01:41.369> hitting<00:01:41.520> your<00:01:41.700> target<00:01:41.729> it's<00:01:42.689> not

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
and end up hitting your target it's not

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.719 
and end up hitting your target it's not
that<00:01:42.990> hard<00:01:43.320> or<00:01:43.560> right<00:01:43.770> here<00:01:43.950> where<00:01:44.250> I<00:01:44.280> went

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
that hard or right here where I went

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.039 
that hard or right here where I went
over<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.090> mountain<00:01:45.149> and<00:01:45.420> hit<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.720> Prowler

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
over the mountain and hit the Prowler
