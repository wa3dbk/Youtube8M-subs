00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:45.740 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.890 

I<00:00:45.830> try<00:00:46.580> to<00:00:46.610> find<00:00:47.150> out<00:00:47.330> when<00:00:47.570> we're<00:00:47.720> having

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:47.900 
I try to find out when we're having

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.840 
I try to find out when we're having
those<00:00:48.140> flyovers<00:00:48.890> because<00:00:49.250> if<00:00:49.400> you<00:00:49.520> don't<00:00:49.640> know

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
those flyovers because if you don't know

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:55.220 
those flyovers because if you don't know
they<00:00:50.030> can<00:00:50.240> scare<00:00:50.540> the<00:00:50.660> hell<00:00:50.810> out<00:00:51.020> of<00:00:51.050> you

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.380 

in<00:00:56.230> a<00:00:56.410> game<00:00:56.590> known<00:00:56.920> for<00:00:57.250> its<00:00:57.340> complex<00:00:57.850> passing

00:01:00.599 --> 00:01:00.609 
patterns and crossing routes it only

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:03.270 
patterns and crossing routes it only
makes<00:01:00.969> sense<00:01:01.269> that<00:01:01.480> a<00:01:01.660> good<00:01:01.960> flyover<00:01:02.680> can<00:01:03.039> give

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 
makes sense that a good flyover can give

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.600 
makes sense that a good flyover can give
inspiration

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.850 

yeah<00:01:08.240> there<00:01:08.450> are<00:01:08.570> flyovers<00:01:09.260> and<00:01:09.500> then<00:01:09.620> there

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
yeah there are flyovers and then there

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.540 
yeah there are flyovers and then there
are<00:01:09.920> different<00:01:10.340> flyovers

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:12.550 
are different flyovers

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:14.760 
are different flyovers
I<00:01:12.700> can<00:01:13.150> remember<00:01:13.300> being<00:01:13.600> in<00:01:13.840> Kansas<00:01:14.260> City<00:01:14.440> and

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:19.480 
Vietnam and the flyover was always

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.930 
Vietnam and the flyover was always
special<00:01:19.930> to<00:01:19.960> him<00:01:20.290> whenever<00:01:20.920> we'd<00:01:21.340> have<00:01:21.610> one

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:21.940 
special to him whenever we'd have one

a<00:01:37.659> precise<00:01:38.659> flyover<00:01:39.380> is<00:01:39.409> much<00:01:39.799> like<00:01:40.070> a

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
a precise flyover is much like a

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.090 
a precise flyover is much like a
fine-tuned<00:01:40.939> offense<00:01:41.540> in<00:01:41.780> that<00:01:42.439> it<00:01:42.590> requires

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
fine-tuned offense in that it requires

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.050

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
things that our biggest factor for us is

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.070 
things that our biggest factor for us is
this<00:02:03.950> building<00:02:04.429> be<00:02:04.850> well<00:02:05.630> above<00:02:05.780> this
