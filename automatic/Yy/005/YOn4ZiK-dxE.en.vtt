non-restricted<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.350> other<00:02:04.469> thing<00:02:04.710> is<00:02:04.890> is

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
non-restricted the other thing is is

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.410 
non-restricted the other thing is is
even<00:02:05.399> though<00:02:05.490> it<00:02:05.610> has<00:02:05.759> a<00:02:05.790> short<00:02:06.090> barrel<00:02:06.299> it's

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
even though it has a short barrel it's

even though it has a short barrel it's
still<00:02:06.570> over<00:02:06.750> 26<00:02:07.320> inches<00:02:07.770> in<00:02:07.829> total<00:02:08.520> length

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
still over 26 inches in total length

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.029 
still over 26 inches in total length
there's<00:02:09.869> a<00:02:09.929> metric<00:02:10.229> equivalent<00:02:10.679> but<00:02:10.800> I<00:02:10.860> keep

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
there's a metric equivalent but I keep

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.250 
there's a metric equivalent but I keep
forgetting<00:02:11.430> it<00:02:11.520> but<00:02:11.700> over<00:02:12.300> 26<00:02:12.690> inches<00:02:12.930> in<00:02:12.989> full

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
forgetting it but over 26 inches in full

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.030 
forgetting it but over 26 inches in full
length

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
length

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.400 
length
so<00:02:14.489> that<00:02:14.670> keeps<00:02:15.060> us<00:02:15.239> under<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:15.510> limit<00:02:15.750> the

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
so that keeps us under the limit the

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.080 
so that keeps us under the limit the
shotgun<00:02:16.830> itself<00:02:17.190> comes<00:02:17.430> with<00:02:17.550> ghost<00:02:17.879> ring

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
shotgun itself comes with ghost ring

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.970 
shotgun itself comes with ghost ring
sights<00:02:18.390> on<00:02:18.599> it<00:02:18.750> ghost<00:02:19.349> ring<00:02:19.530> sites<00:02:19.800> are

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
sights on it ghost ring sites are

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.530 
sights on it ghost ring sites are
basically<00:02:20.099> an<00:02:20.580> aperture<00:02:20.849> sight<00:02:21.180> or<00:02:21.300> a<00:02:21.330> peep

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
basically an aperture sight or a peep

basically an aperture sight or a peep
sight<00:02:21.810> I<00:02:22.019> guess<00:02:22.470> they<00:02:22.590> call<00:02:22.739> them<00:02:22.860> ghost<00:02:23.040> rings

that knows what this this little rod in
here<00:05:27.720> is<00:05:27.810> called<00:05:28.020> so<00:05:28.320> you<00:05:28.530> can<00:05:28.830> put<00:05:29.100> that<00:05:29.190> down

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.490 
here is called so you can put that down
below<00:05:29.580> also<00:05:29.850> so<00:05:30.720> yeah<00:05:30.900> those<00:05:31.080> are<00:05:31.140> the<00:05:31.320> two

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:31.500 
below also so yeah those are the two

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.380 
below also so yeah those are the two
advantages<00:05:32.370> and<00:05:32.520> disadvantages<00:05:33.090> of<00:05:33.150> the

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:33.390 
advantages and disadvantages of the

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:35.270 
advantages and disadvantages of the
magazine-fed<00:05:33.870> version<00:05:34.440> versus<00:05:34.890> a<00:05:34.920> tubular

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 
magazine-fed version versus a tubular

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.400 
magazine-fed version versus a tubular
one<00:05:35.970> other<00:05:36.120> thing<00:05:36.390> I<00:05:36.630> mean<00:05:36.960> this<00:05:37.080> isn't<00:05:37.350> a

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:37.410 
one other thing I mean this isn't a

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:39.320 
one other thing I mean this isn't a
video<00:05:37.620> about<00:05:37.890> tubular<00:05:38.310> versus<00:05:38.730> magazine<00:05:39.150> but

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:39.330 
video about tubular versus magazine but

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.270 
video about tubular versus magazine but
I<00:05:39.540> just<00:05:39.810> thought<00:05:39.930> I'd<00:05:40.080> pass<00:05:40.260> it<00:05:40.410> on<00:05:40.530> with<00:05:41.250> a

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 
I just thought I'd pass it on with a

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.160 
I just thought I'd pass it on with a
tubular<00:05:41.610> magazine<00:05:42.150> you<00:05:42.330> can<00:05:42.450> keep<00:05:42.630> topping<00:05:43.050> up

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:43.170 
tubular magazine you can keep topping up

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:44.750 
tubular magazine you can keep topping up
so<00:05:43.710> if<00:05:43.800> you've<00:05:43.920> ever<00:05:44.070> done<00:05:44.250> a<00:05:44.280> tactical

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:44.760 
so if you've ever done a tactical

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:47.150 
so if you've ever done a tactical
shotgun<00:05:45.240> course<00:05:45.720> what's<00:05:46.410> cool<00:05:46.590> about<00:05:46.620> that<00:05:46.830> is

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.160 
shotgun course what's cool about that is

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.410 
shotgun course what's cool about that is
you<00:05:47.310> take<00:05:47.490> two<00:05:47.520> shots<00:05:47.940> and<00:05:48.120> you're<00:05:48.240> always

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:48.420 
you take two shots and you're always

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:50.330 
you take two shots and you're always
feeding<00:05:48.810> this<00:05:49.020> thing<00:05:49.080> you're<00:05:49.800> never<00:05:50.130> going<00:05:50.310> to

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:50.340 
feeding this thing you're never going to

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.850

reliable gun I have never pulled the

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:15.830 
reliable gun I have never pulled the
trigger<00:06:14.460> expecting<00:06:15.180> this<00:06:15.270> thing<00:06:15.420> to<00:06:15.510> fire<00:06:15.690> in

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:15.840 
trigger expecting this thing to fire in

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:20.030 
trigger expecting this thing to fire in
it<00:06:15.960> not<00:06:16.110> fire<00:06:18.110> the<00:06:19.110> action<00:06:19.470> as<00:06:19.590> I<00:06:19.710> said<00:06:19.920> is

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:20.040 
it not fire the action as I said is

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.770 
it not fire the action as I said is
absolutely<00:06:20.430> perfect<00:06:21.060> the<00:06:21.090> price<00:06:21.330> was<00:06:21.570> good<00:06:21.720> I

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:21.780 
absolutely perfect the price was good I

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:23.870 
absolutely perfect the price was good I
think<00:06:21.930> I<00:06:22.200> got<00:06:22.410> them<00:06:22.590> a<00:06:22.800> little<00:06:23.490> bit<00:06:23.580> earlier

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:23.880 
think I got them a little bit earlier

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.000 
think I got them a little bit earlier
when<00:06:23.940> I<00:06:24.120> think<00:06:24.510> I<00:06:24.570> paid<00:06:24.780> three<00:06:25.680> hundred<00:06:25.740> and

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:26.010 
when I think I paid three hundred and

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:28.640 
when I think I paid three hundred and
nine<00:06:26.160> dollars<00:06:26.330> for<00:06:27.330> this<00:06:27.420> for<00:06:27.990> this<00:06:28.110> shotgun

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:28.650 
nine dollars for this for this shotgun

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:30.590 
nine dollars for this for this shotgun
so<00:06:29.430> I<00:06:29.670> think<00:06:29.910> they've<00:06:30.000> gone<00:06:30.120> up<00:06:30.270> in<00:06:30.390> price<00:06:30.420> a

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:30.600 
so I think they've gone up in price a

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.000 
so I think they've gone up in price a
little<00:06:30.780> bit<00:06:30.930> rightly<00:06:31.350> so<00:06:31.560> they're<00:06:31.740> a<00:06:31.770> great

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:32.010 
little bit rightly so they're a great

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:33.710 
little bit rightly so they're a great
gun<00:06:32.220> so<00:06:32.460> I<00:06:32.490> would<00:06:32.670> recommend<00:06:32.820> them<00:06:33.180> if<00:06:33.300> you

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:33.720 
gun so I would recommend them if you

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:35.180 
gun so I would recommend them if you
have<00:06:33.930> the<00:06:34.080> opportunity<00:06:34.320> to<00:06:34.740> grab<00:06:34.890> one<00:06:35.100> of

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:35.190
