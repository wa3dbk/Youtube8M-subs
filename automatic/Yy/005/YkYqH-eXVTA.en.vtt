00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
alright guys so we have the Infernus on

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.849 
alright guys so we have the Infernus on
road<00:00:12.570> handling<00:00:12.900> and<00:00:15.080> basically<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.289> Infernus

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
road handling and basically the Infernus

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.760 
road handling and basically the Infernus
is<00:00:17.090> pretty<00:00:18.090> clean<00:00:18.779> in<00:00:18.810> terms<00:00:19.289> of<00:00:19.590> on<00:00:19.740> road

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
is pretty clean in terms of on road

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.790 
is pretty clean in terms of on road
handling<00:00:20.189> it's<00:00:20.609> very<00:00:21.510> nice<00:00:21.900> it's<00:00:22.439> I<00:00:22.740> never

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
handling it's very nice it's I never

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.970 
handling it's very nice it's I never
felt<00:00:23.400> out<00:00:23.580> of<00:00:23.640> control<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.720> only<00:00:24.900> time<00:00:25.320> I<00:00:25.710> felt

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
felt out of control the only time I felt

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.570 
felt out of control the only time I felt
out<00:00:26.250> of<00:00:26.279> control<00:00:26.910> is<00:00:27.240> when<00:00:28.230> you're<00:00:28.439> going<00:00:29.010> very

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
out of control is when you're going very

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.269 
out of control is when you're going very
very<00:00:29.760> fast<00:00:30.150> on<00:00:30.869> road<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:31.650> then<00:00:31.859> you<00:00:31.980> try<00:00:32.219> to

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
very fast on road and then you try to

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.880 
very fast on road and then you try to
make<00:00:32.489> a<00:00:32.520> turn<00:00:32.880> and<00:00:32.910> you<00:00:33.239> kind<00:00:33.570> of<00:00:33.719> lose<00:00:34.469> a<00:00:34.530> lot

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
make a turn and you kind of lose a lot

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.250 
make a turn and you kind of lose a lot
of<00:00:34.920> control<00:00:35.370> but<00:00:36.239> other<00:00:36.420> than<00:00:36.630> that<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:37.020> it

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
of control but other than that and it

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.560 
of control but other than that and it
may<00:00:37.440> be<00:00:37.500> it's<00:00:37.739> just<00:00:37.920> because<00:00:38.250> also<00:00:38.610> I<00:00:38.879> turn

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
may be it's just because also I turn

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.010 
may be it's just because also I turn
with<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:41.059> emergency<00:00:42.059> brake<00:00:42.090> so<00:00:42.540> I<00:00:42.570> can<00:00:42.809> kind

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
with the emergency brake so I can kind

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.600 
with the emergency brake so I can kind
of<00:00:43.110> drift<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.559> little<00:00:43.800> bit<00:00:43.950> it's<00:00:44.129> just<00:00:44.190> kind<00:00:44.520> of

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
of drift a little bit it's just kind of

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.930 
of drift a little bit it's just kind of
become<00:00:45.210> a<00:00:45.239> habit<00:00:45.510> for<00:00:45.719> me<00:00:45.930> so<00:00:46.829> yeah<00:00:47.489> I<00:00:47.520> mean<00:00:47.820> I

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
become a habit for me so yeah I mean I

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.510 
become a habit for me so yeah I mean I
brake<00:00:48.239> with<00:00:48.450> both<00:00:48.719> and<00:00:49.050> I<00:00:49.379> go<00:00:49.800> backwards<00:00:50.370> and

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
brake with both and I go backwards and

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.970 
brake with both and I go backwards and
stuff<00:00:50.820> but<00:00:50.969> you<00:00:51.120> know<00:00:51.320> most<00:00:52.320> of<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.590> time<00:00:52.800> I'll

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
stuff but you know most of the time I'll

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.180 
stuff but you know most of the time I'll
use<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.370> emergency<00:00:54.239> brake<00:00:54.449> so<00:00:54.600> I<00:00:54.660> can<00:00:54.840> drift

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
use the emergency brake so I can drift

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.420 
use the emergency brake so I can drift
so<00:00:56.190> anyway<00:00:56.520> um<00:00:57.199> yeah<00:00:58.199> this<00:00:58.379> car<00:00:58.739> besides<00:00:59.219> the

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
so anyway um yeah this car besides the

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.979 
so anyway um yeah this car besides the
end<00:00:59.609> part<00:00:59.969> because<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.390> end<00:01:00.539> part<00:01:00.809> was<00:01:00.930> very

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
end part because the end part was very

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.229 
end part because the end part was very
close<00:01:01.620> in<00:01:01.890> close<00:01:02.309> quarters<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:02.789> kind<00:01:03.149> of

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
close in close quarters and kind of

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.990 
close in close quarters and kind of
claustrophobic<00:01:04.010> besides<00:01:05.010> that<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.460> Infernus

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
claustrophobic besides that the Infernus

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.700 
claustrophobic besides that the Infernus
did<00:01:06.210> extremely<00:01:06.900> well<00:01:07.260> in<00:01:07.710> terms<00:01:07.920> of<00:01:08.100> pan<00:01:08.280> toy

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.640 

alright<00:01:12.430> guys<00:01:12.640> now<00:01:12.930> we<00:01:13.930> are<00:01:14.080> on<00:01:14.260> to<00:01:14.620> the

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:14.650 
alright guys now we are on to the

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.510 
alright guys now we are on to the
cheetah<00:01:15.280> on<00:01:15.550> road<00:01:15.940> handling<00:01:16.180> so<00:01:17.520> basically

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
cheetah on road handling so basically

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.800 
cheetah on road handling so basically
the<00:01:18.880> cheetah<00:01:19.950> it's<00:01:20.950> okay<00:01:21.490> it's<00:01:21.880> you<00:01:22.390> know<00:01:22.510> I

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
the cheetah it's okay it's you know I

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.410 
the cheetah it's okay it's you know I
feel<00:01:23.560> that<00:01:23.770> it's<00:01:23.980> on<00:01:24.190> the<00:01:24.340> same<00:01:24.370> level<00:01:25.060> of<00:01:25.210> the

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
feel that it's on the same level of the

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.560 
feel that it's on the same level of the
Infernus<00:01:25.990> it<00:01:26.590> really<00:01:27.390> doesn't<00:01:28.390> have<00:01:28.540> that

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
Infernus it really doesn't have that

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.440 
Infernus it really doesn't have that
many<00:01:28.930> differences<00:01:29.380> it<00:01:29.830> like<00:01:30.250> I<00:01:30.400> said<00:01:30.670> again

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
many differences it like I said again

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.890 
many differences it like I said again
has<00:01:31.840> very<00:01:32.590> clear-cut<00:01:33.150> handling<00:01:34.150> on<00:01:34.450> the

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:34.900 
has very clear-cut handling on the

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.180 
has very clear-cut handling on the
handling<00:01:35.530> a<00:01:35.979> tiny<00:01:36.490> bit<00:01:36.760> more<00:01:37.030> sturdier<00:01:37.930> on<00:01:38.290> our

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.190 
handling a tiny bit more sturdier on our

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.750 
handling a tiny bit more sturdier on our
more<00:01:39.430> sturdy<00:01:39.790> excuse<00:01:40.240> me<00:01:40.420> on<00:01:40.600> a<00:01:41.160> road<00:01:42.160> it's

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:42.760 
more sturdy excuse me on a road it's

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:48.240 
more sturdy excuse me on a road it's
just<00:01:42.910> it's<00:01:43.360> a<00:01:43.690> lot<00:01:43.869> better<00:01:45.180> for<00:01:46.770> how<00:01:47.770> do<00:01:47.830> I<00:01:47.920> say

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
just it's a lot better for how do I say

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.639 
just it's a lot better for how do I say
this<00:01:48.399> for<00:01:48.640> high<00:01:48.880> speed<00:01:49.390> handling<00:01:49.869> as<00:01:50.200> the

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:50.649 
this for high speed handling as the

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:54.270 
this for high speed handling as the
Infernus<00:01:51.490> is<00:01:51.640> better<00:01:51.880> for<00:01:52.530> handling<00:01:53.530> if<00:01:54.040> that

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
Infernus is better for handling if that

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.710 
Infernus is better for handling if that
makes<00:01:54.460> any<00:01:54.580> sense<00:01:54.729> so<00:01:55.030> if<00:01:55.240> you're<00:01:55.360> going<00:01:55.509> high

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
makes any sense so if you're going high

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.359 
makes any sense so if you're going high
speeds<00:01:56.110> the<00:01:56.259> cheetah<00:01:56.649> is<00:01:56.770> kind<00:01:57.040> of<00:01:57.130> more

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
speeds the cheetah is kind of more

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:01.440 
speeds the cheetah is kind of more
durable<00:01:57.940> and<00:01:58.000> terrorism<00:01:58.509> handling<00:01:59.500> so<00:02:00.450> but

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
durable and terrorism handling so but

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:02.969 
durable and terrorism handling so but
when<00:02:01.600> it<00:02:01.690> comes<00:02:01.869> down<00:02:02.050> to<00:02:02.110> this<00:02:02.410> test<00:02:02.740> I'm

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
when it comes down to this test I'm

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:05.730 
when it comes down to this test I'm
going<00:02:03.280> to<00:02:03.369> have<00:02:03.520> to<00:02:03.700> say<00:02:03.880> guys<00:02:04.119> that<00:02:04.420> both<00:02:05.320> cars

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
going to have to say guys that both cars

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:12.510 
going to have to say guys that both cars
actually<00:02:06.399> performed<00:02:06.820> equally

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.699

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
alright guys we are on to the Infernus

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.199 
alright guys we are on to the Infernus
off-road<00:02:16.490> handling

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
off-road handling

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:20.199 
off-road handling
now<00:02:17.450> the<00:02:18.080> Infernus<00:02:18.709> is<00:02:19.209> actually

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
now the Infernus is actually

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:23.500 
now the Infernus is actually
surprisingly<00:02:21.140> well<00:02:21.620> off-road<00:02:22.310> it's<00:02:22.520> it<00:02:23.060> does

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
surprisingly well off-road it's it does

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.430 
surprisingly well off-road it's it does
well<00:02:23.900> it's<00:02:24.260> just<00:02:25.220> a<00:02:25.400> very<00:02:25.820> good<00:02:26.240> off-road<00:02:26.780> car

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
well it's just a very good off-road car

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.470 
well it's just a very good off-road car
I<00:02:27.800> mean<00:02:28.160> even<00:02:28.459> though<00:02:28.550> it's<00:02:28.580> a<00:02:28.790> supercar<00:02:29.120> I

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
I mean even though it's a supercar I

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.810 
I mean even though it's a supercar I
just<00:02:29.690> find<00:02:29.900> that<00:02:29.990> funny<00:02:30.290> how<00:02:30.560> most<00:02:31.550> of<00:02:31.730> the

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
just find that funny how most of the

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.940 
just find that funny how most of the
off-road<00:02:32.270> vehicles<00:02:32.780> on<00:02:32.990> our<00:02:33.260> series<00:02:33.680> we're

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
off-road vehicles on our series we're

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.340 
off-road vehicles on our series we're
actually<00:02:34.220> that<00:02:34.820> good<00:02:35.209> for<00:02:35.540> offroad<00:02:36.080> which

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
actually that good for offroad which

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.949 
actually that good for offroad which
just<00:02:36.860> boggles<00:02:37.130> my<00:02:37.640> mind<00:02:37.670> I<00:02:38.150> don't<00:02:38.360> understand

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
just boggles my mind I don't understand

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:43.500 
just boggles my mind I don't understand
why<00:02:39.230> but<00:02:39.620> apparently<00:02:40.010> is<00:02:40.360> is<00:02:41.360> what<00:02:41.750> it<00:02:41.840> is<00:02:41.959> guys

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
why but apparently is is what it is guys

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.600 
why but apparently is is what it is guys
um<00:02:44.510> but<00:02:44.959> anyway<00:02:45.290> yeah<00:02:45.560> as<00:02:45.950> you<00:02:46.070> can<00:02:46.190> see<00:02:46.370> it

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
um but anyway yeah as you can see it

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.030 
um but anyway yeah as you can see it
clearly<00:02:47.030> cuts<00:02:47.420> the<00:02:47.660> turns<00:02:47.959> it<00:02:48.380> really<00:02:48.769> doesn't

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
clearly cuts the turns it really doesn't

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.400 
clearly cuts the turns it really doesn't
have<00:02:49.130> any<00:02:49.340> trouble<00:02:49.910> navigating<00:02:50.120> the<00:02:50.720> hole<00:02:50.900> I

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
have any trouble navigating the hole I

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.130 
have any trouble navigating the hole I
was<00:02:51.800> about<00:02:52.130> to<00:02:52.280> say<00:02:52.489> the<00:02:52.670> worse<00:02:52.880> the<00:02:53.630> course

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
was about to say the worse the course

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.979 
was about to say the worse the course
guys<00:02:54.410> um<00:02:54.739> it<00:02:55.519> does<00:02:55.820> not<00:02:55.970> have<00:02:56.269> any<00:02:56.510> trouble

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
guys um it does not have any trouble

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:00.970 
guys um it does not have any trouble
doing<00:02:57.320> so<00:02:57.560> it's<00:02:58.100> really<00:02:58.700> really<00:02:59.150> a<00:02:59.980> really

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
doing so it's really really a really

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.820 
doing so it's really really a really
really<00:03:01.220> good<00:03:01.400> off-road<00:03:01.880> uh<00:03:02.620> although<00:03:03.620> the

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
really good off-road uh although the

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.070 
really good off-road uh although the
Turismo<00:03:04.250> R<00:03:04.430> is<00:03:04.730> definitely<00:03:05.540> the<00:03:05.750> best

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
Turismo R is definitely the best

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.620 
Turismo R is definitely the best
off-road<00:03:06.709> vehicle<00:03:07.190> even<00:03:08.090> though<00:03:08.239> it's<00:03:08.390> not<00:03:08.570> a

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
off-road vehicle even though it's not a

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.080 
off-road vehicle even though it's not a
health<00:03:09.050> road<00:03:09.320> vehicle<00:03:09.860> like<00:03:10.610> I<00:03:10.760> said<00:03:10.940> guys

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
health road vehicle like I said guys

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.140 
health road vehicle like I said guys
that<00:03:11.300> cracks<00:03:11.600> me<00:03:11.780> up<00:03:11.810> every<00:03:12.019> time<00:03:12.380> but<00:03:13.130> uh<00:03:13.160> the

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
that cracks me up every time but uh the

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.910 
that cracks me up every time but uh the
Infernus<00:03:15.079> is<00:03:15.350> just<00:03:15.880> very<00:03:16.880> very<00:03:17.170> cool<00:03:18.170> but<00:03:18.590> it's

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
Infernus is just very very cool but it's

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.710 
Infernus is just very very cool but it's
good<00:03:19.340> at<00:03:19.640> what<00:03:19.880> it<00:03:19.910> does<00:03:20.030> for<00:03:20.720> offroad<00:03:21.290> so<00:03:21.980> I

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
good at what it does for offroad so I

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.470 
good at what it does for offroad so I
use<00:03:23.720> this<00:03:23.870> example<00:03:24.160> frequently<00:03:25.160> if<00:03:26.060> you<00:03:26.329> are

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
use this example frequently if you are

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.039 
use this example frequently if you are
in<00:03:26.750> a<00:03:27.019> high<00:03:27.620> speed<00:03:28.160> police<00:03:28.459> chase<00:03:28.780> off-road<00:03:29.780> in

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:30.049 
in a high speed police chase off-road in

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:33.370 
in a high speed police chase off-road in
the<00:03:30.170> deserts<00:03:30.530> of<00:03:30.680> sandy<00:03:31.220> shores<00:03:31.549> or<00:03:31.790> even<00:03:32.120> here

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
the deserts of sandy shores or even here

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.530 
the deserts of sandy shores or even here
this<00:03:33.709> car<00:03:34.010> would<00:03:34.220> most<00:03:34.549> definitely<00:03:34.670> have<00:03:35.329> your

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
this car would most definitely have your

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.460 
this car would most definitely have your
back<00:03:35.780> there's<00:03:36.260> no<00:03:36.560> way<00:03:36.769> that<00:03:36.950> it<00:03:37.070> would<00:03:37.220> not<00:03:38.470> so

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
back there's no way that it would not so

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.640 
back there's no way that it would not so
I<00:03:39.500> think<00:03:39.620> that<00:03:40.160> would<00:03:40.400> be<00:03:41.079> it<00:03:42.079> for<00:03:42.140> the

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
I think that would be it for the

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.490 
I think that would be it for the
Infernus<00:03:43.420> like<00:03:44.420> I<00:03:44.570> said<00:03:44.780> guys<00:03:44.930> it's<00:03:45.200> very

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
Infernus like I said guys it's very

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.400 
Infernus like I said guys it's very
top-notch<00:03:46.130> handling<00:03:46.760> offroad<00:03:47.239> and<00:03:47.540> I<00:03:47.900> enjoy

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
top-notch handling offroad and I enjoy

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:53.130 
top-notch handling offroad and I enjoy

get it to steer clear enough so I could

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.340 
get it to steer clear enough so I could
actually<00:04:12.820> hit<00:04:13.330> the<00:04:13.510> ramp<00:04:13.750> and<00:04:14.020> that<00:04:14.080> was

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
cut those other two turns pretty well

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.030 
cut those other two turns pretty well
but<00:04:38.320> as<00:04:38.710> you<00:04:39.010> can<00:04:39.070> see<00:04:39.130> guys<00:04:39.520> it<00:04:39.940> will<00:04:40.210> mess<00:04:40.870> up

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 
but as you can see guys it will mess up

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.470 
but as you can see guys it will mess up
especially<00:04:42.040> on<00:04:42.340> these<00:04:42.490> jumps<00:04:42.970> it<00:04:43.090> does<00:04:43.240> hit<00:04:43.450> a

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:43.480 
especially on these jumps it does hit a

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.540 
especially on these jumps it does hit a
sign<00:04:43.870> that<00:04:43.900> just<00:04:44.350> randomly<00:04:44.650> spawned<00:04:45.220> so<00:04:45.490> I'm

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
sign that just randomly spawned so I'm

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.180 
sign that just randomly spawned so I'm
like<00:04:45.730> why<00:04:45.970> did<00:04:46.180> that<00:04:46.300> exist<00:04:46.750> but<00:04:47.110> other<00:04:48.010> than

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.190 
like why did that exist but other than

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.340 
like why did that exist but other than
that<00:04:48.310> I<00:04:48.460> mean<00:04:48.669> look<00:04:49.090> it's<00:04:49.330> it<00:04:49.810> handles<00:04:50.200> the

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.350 
that I mean look it's it handles the

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:54.870 
that I mean look it's it handles the
jump<00:04:50.620> pretty<00:04:51.040> well<00:04:51.570> BAM<00:04:52.600> it's<00:04:53.110> a<00:04:53.350> sign<00:04:53.650> I<00:04:54.040> can't

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
jump pretty well BAM it's a sign I can't

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.070 
jump pretty well BAM it's a sign I can't
even<00:04:55.000> get<00:04:55.360> it<00:04:55.510> to<00:04:56.280> turn<00:04:57.280> correctly<00:04:58.030> for<00:04:58.300> me<00:04:58.510> I'm

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
even get it to turn correctly for me I'm

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.350 
even get it to turn correctly for me I'm
always<00:04:59.400> struggling<00:05:00.400> and<00:05:00.640> trying<00:05:00.669> to<00:05:01.000> keep<00:05:01.210> it

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 
always struggling and trying to keep it

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.969 
always struggling and trying to keep it
on<00:05:01.450> the<00:05:01.660> track<00:05:01.960> I<00:05:01.990> mean<00:05:02.169> I<00:05:02.380> understand<00:05:02.800> it's<00:05:02.919> a

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:02.979 
on the track I mean I understand it's a

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:05.250 
on the track I mean I understand it's a
supercar<00:05:03.370> it's<00:05:03.669> not<00:05:03.790> built<00:05:04.240> for<00:05:04.479> this<00:05:04.630> but<00:05:04.990> I

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:05.260 
supercar it's not built for this but I

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.860 
supercar it's not built for this but I
mean<00:05:05.440> hey<00:05:06.070> I<00:05:06.610> mean<00:05:06.940> it's<00:05:07.120> still<00:05:07.300> very<00:05:07.630> key

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
mean hey I mean it's still very key

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:11.550 
mean hey I mean it's still very key
factor<00:05:08.380> and<00:05:08.560> as<00:05:09.310> we<00:05:09.669> can<00:05:09.850> see<00:05:10.390> here<00:05:10.690> the

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560 
factor and as we can see here the

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.920 
factor and as we can see here the
cheetah<00:05:11.830> is<00:05:12.040> now<00:05:12.310> kind<00:05:12.729> of<00:05:12.850> you<00:05:13.030> know<00:05:13.150> leveling

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 
cheetah is now kind of you know leveling

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:15.360 
cheetah is now kind of you know leveling
out<00:05:14.110> and<00:05:14.350> this<00:05:14.440> is<00:05:14.590> because<00:05:14.919> the<00:05:15.100> track<00:05:15.340> is

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
out and this is because the track is

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.310 
out and this is because the track is
mostly<00:05:16.000> getting<00:05:16.180> straight<00:05:16.720> now<00:05:16.900> and<00:05:16.930> it's<00:05:17.200> not

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:17.320 
mostly getting straight now and it's not

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.650 
mostly getting straight now and it's not
very<00:05:17.530> bumpy<00:05:18.010> oh<00:05:18.190> there's<00:05:18.850> even<00:05:18.970> a<00:05:19.210> road<00:05:19.419> in<00:05:19.600> the

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:19.660 
very bumpy oh there's even a road in the

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.990 
very bumpy oh there's even a road in the
middle<00:05:19.720> so<00:05:20.260> now<00:05:20.440> it'll<00:05:20.650> make<00:05:20.860> the<00:05:20.979> turn<00:05:21.250> it

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 
middle so now it'll make the turn it

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.900 
middle so now it'll make the turn it
actually<00:05:22.450> almost<00:05:22.600> lost<00:05:23.140> its<00:05:23.500> uh<00:05:23.910> stability

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:24.910 
actually almost lost its uh stability

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:27.360 
actually almost lost its uh stability
there<00:05:25.120> but<00:05:25.810> other<00:05:25.960> than<00:05:26.140> that<00:05:26.200> guys<00:05:26.620> cheetahs

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 
there but other than that guys cheetahs

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:29.700 
there but other than that guys cheetahs
pretty<00:05:27.640> bad<00:05:27.880> and<00:05:28.210> the<00:05:28.300> inference<00:05:28.840> definitely

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.710 
pretty bad and the inference definitely

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:33.570 
pretty bad and the inference definitely
performed<00:05:30.250> better<00:05:31.800> alright<00:05:32.800> guys<00:05:33.070> so<00:05:33.340> now<00:05:33.370> we

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580 
performed better alright guys so now we

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.940 
performed better alright guys so now we
are<00:05:33.760> doing<00:05:33.970> the<00:05:34.240> infernus<00:05:34.930> damage<00:05:35.380> resistance

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:35.950 
are doing the infernus damage resistance

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:38.880 
are doing the infernus damage resistance
test<00:05:36.250> and<00:05:36.669> the<00:05:37.630> Infernus<00:05:38.200> did<00:05:38.470> pretty

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:38.890 
test and the Infernus did pretty

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:41.010 
test and the Infernus did pretty
decently<00:05:39.460> it's<00:05:39.910> not<00:05:40.150> the<00:05:40.330> best<00:05:40.540> car<00:05:40.810> we've

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:41.020 
decently it's not the best car we've

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:42.870 
decently it's not the best car we've
seen<00:05:41.290> but<00:05:41.530> it's<00:05:41.650> not<00:05:41.800> the<00:05:41.919> worst<00:05:42.100> and<00:05:42.430> it

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:42.880 
seen but it's not the worst and it

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.940 
seen but it's not the worst and it
actually<00:05:43.060> came<00:05:43.479> out<00:05:43.660> to<00:05:43.720> resisting<00:05:44.350> a<00:05:44.440> hundred

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:44.950 
actually came out to resisting a hundred

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:49.610 
actually came out to resisting a hundred
and<00:05:45.100> sixty<00:05:45.490> four<00:05:45.640> bullets

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:49.620 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.140 

all<00:05:50.620> right<00:05:50.949> guys<00:05:51.129> now<00:05:51.340> we<00:05:51.400> have<00:05:51.669> the<00:05:51.879> cheetah

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:52.150 
all right guys now we have the cheetah

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:55.439 
all right guys now we have the cheetah
damage<00:05:52.539> resistance<00:05:53.110> test<00:05:53.409> and<00:05:53.800> I<00:05:54.610> do<00:05:54.909> have<00:05:55.300> to

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:55.449 
damage resistance test and I do have to

00:05:55.449 --> 00:05:57.510 
damage resistance test and I do have to
say<00:05:55.659> that<00:05:55.689> it<00:05:56.139> did<00:05:56.349> resist<00:05:56.740> a<00:05:56.889> lot<00:05:57.009> more<00:05:57.280> it

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:57.520 
say that it did resist a lot more it

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.939 
say that it did resist a lot more it
resisted<00:05:57.909> 183<00:05:58.810> bullets<00:05:59.139> making<00:05:59.560> the<00:05:59.680> cheetah

00:05:59.939 --> 00:05:59.949 
resisted 183 bullets making the cheetah

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:03.360 
resisted 183 bullets making the cheetah
better<00:06:00.270> all<00:06:01.270> right<00:06:01.509> guys<00:06:01.719> so<00:06:02.020> now<00:06:02.169> we<00:06:02.229> have<00:06:03.069> the

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:03.370 
better all right guys so now we have the

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:05.459 
better all right guys so now we have the
Infernus<00:06:04.240> speed<00:06:04.780> test

00:06:05.459 --> 00:06:05.469 
Infernus speed test

00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:08.219 
Infernus speed test
so<00:06:06.009> the<00:06:06.370> Infernus<00:06:06.969> as<00:06:07.180> you<00:06:07.389> guys<00:06:07.539> can<00:06:07.780> tell<00:06:07.840> is

00:06:08.219 --> 00:06:08.229 
so the Infernus as you guys can tell is

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:12.089 
so the Infernus as you guys can tell is
a<00:06:08.259> supercar<00:06:08.860> so<00:06:09.639> it<00:06:10.210> went<00:06:11.080> pretty<00:06:11.379> fast<00:06:11.830> and

00:06:12.089 --> 00:06:12.099 
a supercar so it went pretty fast and

00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:14.040 
a supercar so it went pretty fast and
actually<00:06:12.819> I'm<00:06:13.030> gonna<00:06:13.180> give<00:06:13.780> you<00:06:13.900> guys<00:06:13.990> a

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:14.050 
actually I'm gonna give you guys a

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:15.300 
actually I'm gonna give you guys a
little<00:06:14.259> preview<00:06:14.650> of<00:06:14.889> what's<00:06:15.069> gonna<00:06:15.219> happen

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:15.310 
little preview of what's gonna happen

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:20.640 
little preview of what's gonna happen
next<00:06:17.340> the<00:06:18.340> times<00:06:18.939> between<00:06:19.449> the<00:06:19.990> cheetah<00:06:20.379> and

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:20.650 
next the times between the cheetah and

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:23.159 
next the times between the cheetah and
the<00:06:20.740> Infernus<00:06:21.370> are<00:06:21.580> so<00:06:22.060> close<00:06:22.389> I<00:06:22.690> think<00:06:22.990> they

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:23.169 
the Infernus are so close I think they

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:25.290 
the Infernus are so close I think they
are<00:06:23.229> the<00:06:23.379> closest<00:06:23.949> I<00:06:24.099> have<00:06:24.129> ever<00:06:24.460> seen<00:06:24.849> on<00:06:24.969> car

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:25.300 
are the closest I have ever seen on car

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.350 
are the closest I have ever seen on car
versus<00:06:25.780> it<00:06:26.110> really<00:06:26.800> tops<00:06:27.129> the<00:06:27.430> 4way<00:06:27.879> episode

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:28.360 
versus it really tops the 4way episode

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:41.470 
alright guys now we're on the cheetah

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:44.220 
alright guys now we're on the cheetah
speed<00:06:41.860> test<00:06:42.190> and<00:06:42.430> what<00:06:43.120> I<00:06:43.150> do<00:06:43.270> have<00:06:43.570> to<00:06:43.630> say<00:06:43.900> is

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:44.230 
speed test and what I do have to say is

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:48.480 
speed test and what I do have to say is
the<00:06:44.590> difference<00:06:45.390> came<00:06:46.390> within<00:06:47.490> 51

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:48.490 
the difference came within 51

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:51.450 
the difference came within 51
milliseconds<00:06:49.330> which<00:06:49.570> is<00:06:49.600> really<00:06:50.430> really<00:06:51.430> a

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:51.460 
milliseconds which is really really a

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:54.450 
milliseconds which is really really a
short<00:06:51.820> difference<00:06:52.480> it's<00:06:52.810> I<00:06:53.170> guess<00:06:53.830> it<00:06:54.160> does

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:54.460 
short difference it's I guess it does

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:56.760 
short difference it's I guess it does
come<00:06:54.820> down<00:06:54.850> to<00:06:55.180> personal<00:06:55.360> preference<00:06:56.110> I<00:06:56.320> mean

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:56.770 
come down to personal preference I mean

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:58.170 
come down to personal preference I mean
the<00:06:56.860> funny<00:06:57.100> thing<00:06:57.340> is<00:06:57.370> the<00:06:57.580> Infernus<00:06:58.060> is

00:06:58.170 --> 00:06:58.180 
the funny thing is the Infernus is

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:02.100 
the funny thing is the Infernus is
actually<00:06:58.690> cheaper<00:06:58.990> so<00:06:59.800> I<00:07:00.810> don't<00:07:01.810> know<00:07:01.900> it

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:02.110 
actually cheaper so I don't know it

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:03.450 
actually cheaper so I don't know it
really<00:07:02.380> just<00:07:02.530> comes<00:07:02.680> down<00:07:02.800> to<00:07:02.920> personal

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:03.460 
really just comes down to personal

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:05.010 
really just comes down to personal
preference<00:07:03.910> if<00:07:04.270> you're<00:07:04.420> a<00:07:04.450> big<00:07:04.660> guy<00:07:04.690> for

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:05.020 
preference if you're a big guy for

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:06.660 
preference if you're a big guy for
customization<00:07:05.440> I<00:07:05.950> don't<00:07:06.130> know<00:07:06.220> both<00:07:06.430> of<00:07:06.460> the

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:06.670 
customization I don't know both of the

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:08.790 
customization I don't know both of the
cheetah<00:07:06.910> it<00:07:07.390> really<00:07:07.660> it<00:07:07.930> really<00:07:08.170> depends<00:07:08.710> on

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:08.800 
cheetah it really it really depends on

five point eight seconds making the

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:17.280
