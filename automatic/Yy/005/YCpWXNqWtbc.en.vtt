something inside the memory ball you

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.560 
something inside the memory ball you
just<00:03:18.170> slide<00:03:18.350> it<00:03:18.470> in<00:03:18.590> right<00:03:18.950> here<00:03:19.030> so<00:03:20.030> that<00:03:20.180> slot

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
just slide it in right here so that slot

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.479 
just slide it in right here so that slot
you<00:03:20.959> can<00:03:20.989> take<00:03:21.350> this<00:03:21.590> shut<00:03:21.890> so<00:03:22.100> it<00:03:22.130> doesn't

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
you can take this shut so it doesn't

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:24.430 
you can take this shut so it doesn't
fall<00:03:22.670> out<00:03:22.730> because<00:03:23.209> it<00:03:23.390> does<00:03:23.570> come<00:03:24.080> out<00:03:24.170> fairly

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
fall out because it does come out fairly

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.740 
fall out because it does come out fairly
easily<00:03:24.560> and<00:03:25.250> then<00:03:25.730> this<00:03:25.910> peg<00:03:26.180> right<00:03:26.360> here<00:03:26.540> goes

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
easily and then this peg right here goes

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.100 
easily and then this peg right here goes
into<00:03:27.110> fears<00:03:28.100> a<00:03:28.190> left<00:03:28.610> palm<00:03:29.000> and<00:03:29.360> you<00:03:29.720> just<00:03:29.840> plug

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
into fears a left palm and you just plug

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.470 
into fears a left palm and you just plug
that<00:03:30.140> in<00:03:30.440> right<00:03:30.620> here<00:03:30.860> the<00:03:31.850> memory<00:03:32.150> ball<00:03:32.330> is

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
that in right here the memory ball is

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.449 
that in right here the memory ball is
kind<00:03:32.750> of<00:03:32.900> heavy<00:03:33.080> so<00:03:33.350> it<00:03:33.380> weighs<00:03:33.709> down<00:03:33.980> the<00:03:34.040> arm

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
kind of heavy so it weighs down the arm

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:37.300 
kind of heavy so it weighs down the arm
and<00:03:34.730> it<00:03:35.420> makes<00:03:35.570> it<00:03:35.660> kind<00:03:35.870> of<00:03:35.930> difficult<00:03:36.650> for

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
and it makes it kind of difficult for

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:47.860 
and it makes it kind of difficult for
fear<00:03:37.700> to<00:03:37.730> hold<00:03:38.540> it<00:03:38.690> up<00:03:38.810> but<00:03:43.540> but<00:03:44.540> yeah<00:03:46.870> that's

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
fear to hold it up but but yeah that's

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.699 
fear to hold it up but but yeah that's
what<00:03:48.140> it<00:03:48.170> looks<00:03:48.260> like<00:03:48.530> in<00:03:48.860> the<00:03:50.170> fears<00:03:51.170> hand<00:03:51.380> so

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
what it looks like in the fears hand so

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:53.590 
what it looks like in the fears hand so
overall<00:03:52.130> I<00:03:52.160> like<00:03:52.430> fears<00:03:52.760> phrases<00:03:53.450> you<00:03:53.570> can
