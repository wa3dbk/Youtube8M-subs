00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.620 
basically it is full of cedar bedding
like<00:00:59.820> you'd<00:01:00.000> use<00:01:00.030> for<00:01:00.180> animals<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:04.009> peat<00:01:05.009> moss

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
like you'd use for animals and peat moss

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.780 
like you'd use for animals and peat moss
which<00:01:06.630> we<00:01:06.930> understand<00:01:07.470> that<00:01:07.770> coconut

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.859 

derivatives<00:01:11.790> some<00:01:11.970> coconut<00:01:12.479> derivative

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
derivatives some coconut derivative

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.730 
derivatives some coconut derivative
works<00:01:13.470> that<00:01:14.189> as<00:01:14.399> good<00:01:14.759> as<00:01:15.079> peat<00:01:16.079> not<00:01:16.259> peat<00:01:16.619> moss

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
works that as good as peat not peat moss

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.080 
works that as good as peat not peat moss
and<00:01:17.130> is<00:01:18.499> produced<00:01:19.499> in<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.829> friendlier<00:01:20.639> manner

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
and is produced in a friendlier manner

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.550 
and is produced in a friendlier manner
so<00:01:21.420> we're<00:01:21.840> gonna<00:01:21.929> get<00:01:22.049> some<00:01:22.170> of<00:01:22.229> that<00:01:22.319> and<00:01:22.469> give

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
so we're gonna get some of that and give

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.959 
so we're gonna get some of that and give
it<00:01:22.590> a<00:01:22.679> whirl<00:01:22.829> but<00:01:22.889> we<00:01:23.189> have<00:01:23.340> it<00:01:23.460> we<00:01:23.549> had<00:01:23.639> a<00:01:23.670> brick

00:01:23.959 --> 00:01:23.969 
it a whirl but we have it we had a brick

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:27.410 
it a whirl but we have it we had a brick

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
ratio that we usually mix this up that

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:35.359

may even be illegal uh and it may be

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.590 
may even be illegal uh and it may be
actually<00:04:01.730> I<00:04:02.000> think<00:04:02.090> it<00:04:02.390> I<00:04:02.570> think<00:04:02.630> it<00:04:02.840> is<00:04:03.020> oh<00:04:04.600> and
