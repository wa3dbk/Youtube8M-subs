00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:05.320
 two 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.930
 the wooden house of the Swiss architect 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.480
 Pascal Flama is in the middle of a 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:22.100
 meadow from any stay is 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.100
 enjoy the wonderful views 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.140
 the only construction that can be seen at 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.210
 far is a farm to which 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.570
 This traditional cabin belongs to 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.570
 wood 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.120
 you are welcome 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:49.530
 this is the room and how can you see 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:52.970
 it's quite low it's not built by 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:56.250
 below ground level 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:59.070
 you do not look at the landscape 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:02.829
 part of it the vegetation is 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:05.170
 practically at eye level 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:07.799
 The furniture that surrounds the living room 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.390
 wardrobe and desk shelf 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:13.030
 It can also be used as a seat for 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.189
 way that you save a lot of furniture and 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.830
 the kitchen disappears practically between 

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:20.289
 wooden walls 186 meters 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.729
 squares of living space the 

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:24.640
 landscape that we see through the 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:27.119
 Windows look infinite the wood is 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.119
 Pine 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:33.720
 and I was interested in the whole building the 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.420
 construction and all surfaces 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.880
 were of the same material 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.280
 I think that's how you can transmit a 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.380
 feeling of calm and allows the 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.250
 surrounding nature copper 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.250
 leadership 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:02.490
 we are in the hallway of the 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.740
 first floor is small has the 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.650
 size needed to access the 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.190
 four rooms and go up and down the 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.190
 stairs 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:22.069
 this is the first floor 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.010
 and here the four rooms are the 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:27.620
 Same size unlike the plant 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:32.500
 Low ceilings are very high up 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.500
 six meters and we have views of the valley 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.709
 all rooms are connected 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.329
 through sliding doors and the bathroom 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.329
 It is entirely made of wood 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.050
 the windows of the upper floor 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:53.670
 they reach the ground to enjoy 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.670
 the wide views in each room 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:02.629
 we do not feel observed because 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:05.930
 we are surrounded by nature and it does not happen 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:08.090
 a lot of people around here from time to time 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.579
 some hiker to a cow but not 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.950
 they bother us besides we spend the biggest 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:14.750
 part of the day on the ground floor and if 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.519
 someone looks at nothing happens in the 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:20.439
 superior rooms we closed the 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:20.439
 curtains at night and nobody sees us 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.000
 Pascal Flama had no plans to build 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:29.980
 the house for your family but at 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.530
 finish its construction it occurred to him 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.390
 rent it for your personal use now 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.090
 he is convinced that he has found the 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:39.690
 ideal home for your family 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.690
 ah
