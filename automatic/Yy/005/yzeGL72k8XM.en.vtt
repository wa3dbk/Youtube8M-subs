anyways here we go this is what my wife
does<00:00:32.809> in<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:34.050> jar<00:00:37.460> this<00:00:38.460> container<00:00:38.910> I<00:00:39.059> liked

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
does in the jar this container I liked

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.940 
does in the jar this container I liked
it<00:00:39.480> because<00:00:39.629> it's<00:00:39.899> easy<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.230> clean<00:00:40.590> out<00:00:40.680> as

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
it because it's easy to clean out as

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.610 
it because it's easy to clean out as
opposed<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:42.739> the<00:00:43.739> other<00:00:43.920> taller<00:00:44.820> ones<00:00:45.620> from

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
opposed to the other taller ones from

00:00:46.620 --> 00:01:04.640 
opposed to the other taller ones from
the<00:00:46.770> other<00:00:46.920> company<00:00:47.460> and<00:01:03.019> then<00:01:04.019> we<00:01:04.379> put<00:01:04.559> it

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
the other company and then we put it

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:13.290 
the other company and then we put it
back<00:01:04.680> into<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:05.189> fridge

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:13.300 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.270 

so<00:01:14.300> we<00:01:14.420> can<00:01:14.600> safely<00:01:14.810> say<00:01:15.050> there<00:01:15.500> is<00:01:15.620> what<00:01:15.860> this

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
so we can safely say there is what this

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.580 
so we can safely say there is what this
is<00:01:16.340> what<00:01:16.550> 10<00:01:16.790> ounces<00:01:17.210> no<00:01:17.630> this<00:01:17.870> is<00:01:18.020> less<00:01:18.200> of<00:01:18.230> it

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.420 

you<00:01:21.590> know<00:01:21.650> I<00:01:21.800> think<00:01:22.040> is<00:01:22.220> 10<00:01:22.880> ounces<00:01:23.300> I

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
you know I think is 10 ounces I

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:34.470 
you know I think is 10 ounces I
originally<00:01:25.430> I<00:01:25.460> put<00:01:25.820> 4<00:01:26.150> cups<00:01:26.180> of<00:01:28.150> almonds<00:01:29.150> in

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:34.480 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.600 

and<00:01:35.480> it's<00:01:35.810> good<00:01:36.080> to<00:01:36.320> put<00:01:36.560> that<00:01:36.800> amount<00:01:36.980> because

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
and it's good to put that amount because

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:47.080 
and it's good to put that amount because
then<00:01:39.280> it<00:01:40.280> becomes<00:01:40.640> less<00:01:41.650> and<00:01:42.650> then<00:01:45.790> the<00:01:46.790> stick

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
then it becomes less and then the stick

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.690 
then it becomes less and then the stick
doesn't<00:01:48.430> reach<00:01:49.430> it<00:01:49.730> then<00:01:50.030> it's<00:01:50.300> hard<00:01:50.630> to<00:01:51.700> find

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
doesn't reach it then it's hard to find

00:01:52.700 --> 00:02:02.950 
doesn't reach it then it's hard to find
it<00:01:58.660> good<00:01:59.660> I<00:01:59.900> think<00:02:00.110> that's<00:02:00.380> it<00:02:00.820> this<00:02:01.820> is<00:02:01.960> this

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
it good I think that's it this is this

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.080 
it good I think that's it this is this
much<00:02:03.230> left<00:02:03.650> in<00:02:03.890> there<00:02:04.040> and<00:02:04.340> my<00:02:04.580> wife<00:02:04.730> is<00:02:04.880> gonna
