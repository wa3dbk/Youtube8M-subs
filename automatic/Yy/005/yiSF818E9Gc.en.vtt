00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:07.880
 Thoughts 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.880
 I want to get married early 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:18.199
 The other party is weak 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.440
 I have not caught up once 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.440
 Let's offer multiple stories 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.880
 To bring out a beautiful country 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.880
 It's only a little thing 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.640
 flower 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.080
 this 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.780
 With 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.129
 Naoki Takiwaki 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:58.620
 Appeal to Yunnan 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.200
 I'm stuck in returning home 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.200
 Live back at once until the release 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.440
 Specially invited 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.830
 It's like traveling now 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.980
 Some people don't know what age they are here 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.380
 Now 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.740
 It is said that even when I go to Japan 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.650
 What a job 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.290
 But is it okay? 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.290
 This chaos is 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.040
 Nothing 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.150
 No longer 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.979
 The high range of the US Democratic Party rules violation also shines 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.270
 Only 5 consecutive losses 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.100
 One party was united 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.230
 Yanagida Michiyoshi 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:08.829
 It was over again 

00:02:08.829 --> 00:02:11.829
 cafp 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:22.909
 Also 

00:02:23.749 --> 00:02:26.749
 It is too fast 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:29.409
 this time 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:30.299
 Mountain 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:33.299
 There is a place where I want to go, but it seems to be a muddy comfort 

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:38.089
 I expanded to 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:47.129
 Hasegawa power 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:54.849
 That's right 

00:02:57.469 --> 00:03:00.469
 This is often seen 

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:05.229
 31-49 yen on the ball 

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:11.299
 Jal forum for many people booking 

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:19.479
 First of all 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:21.460
 During that 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:24.460
 To original text 

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:31.429
 I understood 

00:03:31.429 --> 00:03:34.429
 as its name suggests 

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:39.279
 Hakata city exhibition 

00:03:39.279 --> 00:03:40.080
 Yes 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.069
 Takashi Ishida 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:43.019
 Nikkei average falls back 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:44.800
 Expectations spread further 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.919
 2101 

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:49.919
 Conducted in 1981 

00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:02.449
 to go 

00:04:15.119 --> 00:04:15.729
 is that so
