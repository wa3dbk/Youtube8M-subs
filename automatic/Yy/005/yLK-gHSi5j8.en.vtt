Capture so don't think that I would just

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.539 
Capture so don't think that I would just
keep<00:02:03.990> this<00:02:04.229> and<00:02:04.469> like<00:02:04.680> try<00:02:05.040> to<00:02:05.100> sell<00:02:05.340> it<00:02:05.369> or

keep this and like try to sell it or

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:06.889 
keep this and like try to sell it or
something<00:02:05.939> but<00:02:06.119> it<00:02:06.270> would<00:02:06.360> definitely<00:02:06.390> go<00:02:06.840> to
