00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.360
 well now let's start with the 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:09.139
 connections 

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:11.850
 tutorials that we are going to do now of 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:14.790
 this guy first start doing 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:17.490
 connections with 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:24.020
 rca cables with coaxial cables with 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:27.650
 component cables hdmi dvi vga cables 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:30.090
 connecting for example how would it be now 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.400
 Cablevision is the first thing I 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.830
 it happened so well let's start 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.700
 with the basics that it would be to connect it via 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.700
 desired 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.400
 the grace is this cable d 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:48.900
 like antenna casting the cable forgiveness 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:52.710
 spraying us coaxial cable 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:56.490
 as also known as antenna 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:01:00.150
 how good are we going to start this cable that 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:03.690
 Have you got our car as a box or 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:05.620
 receiver is a cable that already comes from 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.280
 our service d 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:11.820
 pay television 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.760
 it is in that the signal is in 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.040
 that is going to enter this receiver and is and 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.780
 we from this receiver are going to have 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:25.110
 to get the signal to a television 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:27.810
 call yourself any kind of receiver 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.750
 of transmitter forgiveness has a 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.420
 television a monitor up to a 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.180
 recorder and then we're always going to 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.020
 have to connect the one that goes to the TV 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.020
 output that is out 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.520
 if you have a little trouble 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:48.130
 introduce this cable 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.740
 I recommend you buy another cable not 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.689
 I remember the name I will see if I 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:56.770
 I met him at a fair 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:02:01.030
 of technology that nothing else is you 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:03.740
 they take out this do not go do not put it in and give a 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:08.950
 click and it's all 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.950
 now let's connect our little box 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:15.240
 we turn it around and we're going to connect it 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.240
 here in which 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.670
 and in the same way the cable that I tell you 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.210
 in addition it is likewise in the 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.210
 two extremes 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.820
 if you were to break the 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:37.640
 cable or head 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:40.830
 try to change it by talking to your 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:43.530
 pay television pay system 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.210
 so that those who change them but 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.300
 also they are understanding they can not click 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:54.800
 It is very difficult because obviously buying 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:54.800
 the cable in the cutter and the puncture 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:05.300
 now here we see is already 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:10.220
 we're going to have to put it on channel 3 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:11.450
 on TV or on the air depending on the 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.510
 TV you would like 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:19.070
 next me good antenna on channel 3 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:21.620
 one gains 4 which is the channel that the 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:25.190
 program you 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:29.349
 and well now let's try the 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.349
 rca cable which is our colors
