want them but I think the real issue
here<00:03:04.110> is<00:03:04.380> acceptance<00:03:05.280> I<00:03:05.519> think<00:03:05.820> you<00:03:05.970> want<00:03:06.239> them

to accept you for who you are and it's

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.660 
to accept you for who you are and it's
nothing<00:03:08.850> wrong<00:03:09.030> with<00:03:09.090> that<00:03:10.280> and<00:03:11.280> the<00:03:11.430> fact

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
nothing wrong with that and the fact

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.160 
nothing wrong with that and the fact
that<00:03:11.760> you<00:03:11.970> love<00:03:12.180> their<00:03:12.450> daughter<00:03:12.720> I<00:03:12.870> think
