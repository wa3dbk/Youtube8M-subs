00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
when they first came here because you

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:08.979 
when they first came here because you
know<00:02:08.179> there's<00:02:08.390> a<00:02:08.450> lot<00:02:08.600> of<00:02:08.690> coaches<00:02:08.899> out<00:02:08.959> there

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:10.330 
know there's a lot of coaches out there
that<00:02:09.170> aren't<00:02:09.350> like<00:02:09.440> that<00:02:09.500> that<00:02:09.830> don't<00:02:09.890> expect

so<00:02:10.489> much<00:02:10.610> out<00:02:10.760> of<00:02:10.790> his<00:02:10.910> players<00:02:11.090> but<00:02:11.330> I<00:02:11.360> think

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
so much out of his players but I think

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.150 
so much out of his players but I think
that's<00:02:12.170> one<00:02:12.320> of<00:02:12.350> the<00:02:12.470> reason<00:02:12.739> this<00:02:12.830> club<00:02:13.070> is

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160
