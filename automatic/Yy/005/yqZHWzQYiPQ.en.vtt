00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.779
 hello to all guys and welcome back to 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.520
 canters exhibitions dc today I take 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.550
 the chance of this daisy gameplay 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.140
 shot from dark crowds to talk about 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.449
 of this new title of this new 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.000
 game what it is about is about 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.560
 an openworld survival horror multiplayer 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.840
 all these big words to say that it 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.079
 main purpose is to survive in a 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.610
 enormously exterminated place 225 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.160
 square kilometers we are talking more 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.350
 or not this surface in which precisely 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.270
 our purpose is to survive 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.309
 avoid dying for deaver or deaver 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.079
 for killings by others 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.420
 opponents that can be of different types 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.719
 types can be barrel we have seen 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.610
 first the zombies killed or the more 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.219
 natural pvp and therefore characters 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.809
 precisely controlled by natural persons 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:02.789
 in a clash precisely between the two 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.400
 you will wonder what the difference is 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.500
 among this gameplay this game that 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.710
 however the survival as much as horror 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.240
 so with zombies and rast to say that it is 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.310
 however that is a survival 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.020
 well you can also notice it from the first 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.880
 from the write from the first glimpse that gives you 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.610
 this video is talking first 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.650
 size really a different rasta 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.150
 map that as far as it may seem 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.890
 at the beginning a bit tricky to memorize 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.869
 however it is not huge 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.259
 these guys we're talking to 250 here 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.610
 actual square kilometers in quotation marks 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:34.680
 explorable completely passable 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.460
 so they are very different sizes 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.049
 different 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.490
 they also give a different approach there are 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.740
 vehicles there are possibilities of 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.140
 moving even faster and but 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.430
 we say that these are minutiae the point 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.960
 of fact the fact of the 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.909
 simulation of the fact that the 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.430
 survival is really difficult and not 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.860
 is the fact of looking after an hour of 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:57.990
 I play 2 pants and then we run immediately 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:02:00.270
 to build or get a great pvp with with 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.460
 snipers and anything else then 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.810
 I repeat on rast the weapons are not made 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.850
 still very well 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.799
 as I repeat and we are talking 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.020
 of alpha phase games as mentioned is 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.180
 noticed now the super-paid killing 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.200
 of the zombie therefore we are word cure 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.950
 of two alpha games 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:19.680
 however this game here compared to rast a 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.090
 a depth we say much greater and 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.540
 above all it allows a typology of 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.849
 game even more emphasized then 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.310
 even more thrust than the appearance of 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:30.900
 survival for express text messages 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.360
 quite correctly though what 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.790
 I wanted to tell you about the project 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.310
 mine and dark is to let you see 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.650
 a little to give you a glimpse of all the 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.420
 phases of different types that can be done 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.920
 do in this game so they go 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.900
 from the raid to the killing of this 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.670
 poor man you want to see with and half 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.489
 vagato osta continue bloody though 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.989
 instead you are dead or not or that 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:54.360
 go from the simple note to capture 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:56.060
 people can really do things that 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.989
 still dominates I don't even know 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.450
 absolutely designed neither 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.680
 absolutely achievable for this 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.420
 moment as they are in alpha 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.480
 both of you guys now I leave you 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.380
 and look at the final part for a moment 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.840
 of this gameplay 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:12.299
 I leave you just foreshortening a 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.410
 what will be then is a very project 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:15.390
 wider this if clearly 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.459
 just an intro I hope you enjoy it 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.510
 leave in the comments of you what 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.579
 think 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.440
 and clearly reminds you to visit 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:24.389
 the dark crazy channel that then the author of 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.600
 I remember this video kindly 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:30.530
 granted thanks again and the next 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.530
