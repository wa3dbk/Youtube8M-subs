00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:28.880 
sixteenth notes on one time that's kind
of<00:02:26.879> the<00:02:27.000> signature<00:02:27.569> of<00:02:27.599> the<00:02:28.170> merengue<00:02:28.500> and

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
of the signature of the merengue and

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.710 
of the signature of the merengue and
it's<00:02:29.340> going<00:02:29.489> to<00:02:29.549> sound<00:02:29.790> like<00:02:29.879> this<00:02:30.000> it's<00:02:30.629> very

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
it's going to sound like this it's very

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:48.470 
it's going to sound like this it's very
slow<00:02:45.860> and<00:02:46.860> that's<00:02:47.340> it<00:02:47.579> this<00:02:47.730> is<00:02:47.879> probably<00:02:48.239> one

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
slow and that's it this is probably one

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.240 
slow and that's it this is probably one
of<00:02:48.510> the<00:02:48.780> the<00:02:49.019> most<00:02:49.200> simple<00:02:49.620> rhythms<00:02:49.920> that<00:02:50.040> I'm

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
of the the most simple rhythms that I'm

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.460 
of the the most simple rhythms that I'm
going<00:02:50.430> to<00:02:50.519> show<00:02:50.670> you<00:02:50.989> but<00:02:51.989> you<00:02:52.109> need<00:02:52.200> to<00:02:52.260> have

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
going to show you but you need to have

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.440 
going to show you but you need to have
it<00:02:52.620> in<00:02:52.680> your<00:02:52.769> toolbox<00:02:53.069> in<00:02:53.730> case<00:02:53.879> it's<00:02:54.090> called

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
it in your toolbox in case it's called

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.589 
it in your toolbox in case it's called
so<00:02:55.140> I'll<00:02:55.290> put<00:02:55.470> that<00:02:55.500> in<00:02:55.650> there<00:02:55.920> bring<00:02:56.129> it<00:02:56.190> out

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:56.599 
so I'll put that in there bring it out

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:58.670 
so I'll put that in there bring it out
fresh<00:02:57.599> in<00:02:57.720> your<00:02:57.780> memory<00:02:57.959> with<00:02:58.260> it<00:02:58.379> every<00:02:58.530> once

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
fresh in your memory with it every once

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.009 
fresh in your memory with it every once
in<00:02:58.799> a<00:02:58.890> while<00:02:58.920> and<00:02:59.340> then<00:02:59.489> move<00:02:59.700> on<00:02:59.819> over<00:03:00.810> the

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
in a while and then move on over the

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:02.690 
in a while and then move on over the
next<00:03:01.200> couple<00:03:01.799> of<00:03:01.920> weeks<00:03:01.980> we're<00:03:02.310> going<00:03:02.430> to<00:03:02.489> stay

here and Seward with with some more

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.069 
here and Seward with with some more
rhythms<00:03:05.280> kind<00:03:05.489> of<00:03:05.579> at<00:03:05.730> you<00:03:05.910> stay<00:03:06.660> tuned<00:03:06.900> and
