00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
peppers that I got before the frost

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.640 
peppers that I got before the frost
because<00:00:29.820> once<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.210> frost<00:00:30.449> comes<00:00:30.750> then<00:00:31.470> it's

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
because once the frost comes then it's

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.319 
because once the frost comes then it's
game<00:00:31.890> over<00:00:31.920> these<00:00:32.399> things<00:00:32.640> shrivel<00:00:33.059> up<00:00:33.149> and

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
game over these things shrivel up and

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.380 
game over these things shrivel up and
disappear<00:00:33.840> like<00:00:33.870> nothing<00:00:34.559> so<00:00:34.950> I<00:00:35.219> have<00:00:36.180> more

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
disappear like nothing so I have more

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.630 
disappear like nothing so I have more
than<00:00:36.570> what<00:00:36.719> I<00:00:36.750> need<00:00:37.050> as<00:00:37.739> far<00:00:37.800> as<00:00:38.010> ghost<00:00:38.280> peppers

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
than what I need as far as ghost peppers

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.510 
than what I need as far as ghost peppers
there<00:00:38.820> aren't<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.120> ton<00:00:39.420> of<00:00:39.710> the<00:00:40.710> scorpions<00:00:41.370> but

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
there aren't a ton of the scorpions but

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.639 
there aren't a ton of the scorpions but
there's<00:00:41.730> there's<00:00:41.969> a<00:00:42.090> few<00:00:42.360> in<00:00:42.480> here<00:00:42.510> so<00:00:42.960> I<00:00:43.200> think

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
there's there's a few in here so I think

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.560 
there's there's a few in here so I think
I'll<00:00:43.770> do<00:00:43.920> ok<00:00:44.280> it's<00:00:44.879> going<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.120> give<00:00:45.300> me<00:00:45.329> more

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
I'll do ok it's going to give me more

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.100 
I'll do ok it's going to give me more
seeds<00:00:45.899> than<00:00:46.680> what<00:00:46.890> I<00:00:46.920> need<00:00:47.219> but<00:00:48.149> it's<00:00:48.719> ok<00:00:49.079> for

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
seeds than what I need but it's ok for

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.660 
seeds than what I need but it's ok for
two<00:00:49.379> reasons<00:00:49.739> because<00:00:49.860> one<00:00:50.100> it's<00:00:50.280> easier<00:00:50.550> to

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
two reasons because one it's easier to

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.000 
two reasons because one it's easier to
get<00:00:50.820> more<00:00:51.210> seeds<00:00:51.480> than<00:00:51.570> I<00:00:51.690> want<00:00:51.899> now<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:52.920> then

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
get more seeds than I want now and then

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.470 
get more seeds than I want now and then
I'm<00:00:53.160> have<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.370> look<00:00:53.610> around<00:00:53.730> for<00:00:54.059> them<00:00:54.180> in<00:00:54.329> the

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
I'm have to look around for them in the

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.110 
I'm have to look around for them in the
spring<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:55.710> other<00:00:55.829> benefit<00:00:56.250> is<00:00:56.280> you<00:00:56.969> can

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
spring the other benefit is you can

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.729 
spring the other benefit is you can
plant<00:00:57.360> as<00:00:57.449> many<00:00:57.629> seeds<00:00:57.870> as<00:00:58.020> you<00:00:58.170> want<00:00:58.379> but<00:00:58.620> it's

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
plant as many seeds as you want but it's

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.260 
plant as many seeds as you want but it's
up<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:58.890> mother<00:00:59.100> nature<00:00:59.520> decide<00:00:59.910> I'm<00:01:00.120> going<00:01:00.210> to

of coward actually needs gloves to cut
apart<00:01:48.750> of<00:01:49.020> pepper<00:01:49.200> you<00:01:49.470> should<00:01:49.860> watch<00:01:49.979> that

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
what kind of coward I am

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.749 
what kind of coward I am
because<00:01:54.810> I'm<00:01:55.020> fully<00:01:55.439> aware<00:01:55.829> of<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.369> power<00:01:56.610> of

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
because I'm fully aware of the power of

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.240 
because I'm fully aware of the power of
the<00:01:57.149> ghost<00:01:57.360> pepper<00:01:57.689> did<00:01:58.259> a<00:01:58.350> deep<00:01:58.560> cut<00:01:58.860> inside

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
the ghost pepper did a deep cut inside

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.179 
the ghost pepper did a deep cut inside
just<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.759> get<00:01:59.939> a<00:01:59.969> kind<00:02:00.509> of<00:02:00.600> how<00:02:00.719> many<00:02:00.869> seeds<00:02:01.229> are

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
just to get a kind of how many seeds are

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.910 
just to get a kind of how many seeds are
in<00:02:02.399> there<00:02:02.640> and<00:02:02.850> you<00:02:03.420> know<00:02:03.509> some<00:02:03.750> ghost<00:02:04.469> peppers

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
in there and you know some ghost peppers

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.639 
in there and you know some ghost peppers
or<00:02:05.390> some<00:02:06.390> peppers<00:02:06.719> are<00:02:06.899> just<00:02:07.140> completely

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
or some peppers are just completely

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.040 
or some peppers are just completely
overwhelmed<00:02:08.550> with<00:02:09.119> seeds<00:02:09.450> where<00:02:09.750> once<00:02:09.959> you

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
overwhelmed with seeds where once you

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.360 
overwhelmed with seeds where once you
get<00:02:10.200> in<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.379> middle<00:02:10.500> part<00:02:10.770> is<00:02:10.890> just<00:02:11.039> seed

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
get in the middle part is just seed

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.560 
get in the middle part is just seed
after<00:02:11.580> seed<00:02:11.970> after<00:02:12.150> seed<00:02:12.510> but<00:02:12.720> you<00:02:12.780> can<00:02:12.930> see

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
after seed after seed but you can see

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.690 
after seed after seed but you can see
it<00:02:13.810> is<00:02:14.320> a<00:02:14.350> little<00:02:14.650> bit<00:02:14.800> more<00:02:14.950> sparse<00:02:15.370> I<00:02:15.580> mean

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
it is a little bit more sparse I mean

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.100 
it is a little bit more sparse I mean
it's<00:02:15.820> a<00:02:15.910> lot<00:02:16.060> of<00:02:16.120> seeds<00:02:16.450> this<00:02:16.600> would<00:02:16.780> be<00:02:16.870> a<00:02:16.900> lot

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
it's a lot of seeds this would be a lot

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.230 
it's a lot of seeds this would be a lot
of<00:02:17.290> plants<00:02:17.650> if<00:02:17.800> these<00:02:17.980> all<00:02:18.160> grew<00:02:18.430> but<00:02:18.940> it's<00:02:19.090> not

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
of plants if these all grew but it's not

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.000 
of plants if these all grew but it's not
like<00:02:19.420> a<00:02:19.450> traditional<00:02:19.690> you<00:02:20.290> know<00:02:20.380> green<00:02:20.680> pepper

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
like a traditional you know green pepper

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.680 
like a traditional you know green pepper
that<00:02:21.250> you<00:02:21.280> would<00:02:21.430> find<00:02:21.670> that's<00:02:22.480> just

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
that you would find that's just

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.480 
that you would find that's just
completely<00:02:23.140> overwhelmed<00:02:23.830> those<00:02:23.950> seeds<00:02:24.250> so

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
completely overwhelmed those seeds so

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.280 
completely overwhelmed those seeds so
that's<00:02:24.700> why<00:02:24.880> I<00:02:25.180> do<00:02:25.450> pick<00:02:25.750> more<00:02:25.930> than<00:02:26.110> what<00:02:26.260> I

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
that's why I do pick more than what I

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.890 
that's why I do pick more than what I
need<00:02:26.760> because<00:02:27.760> of<00:02:28.000> these<00:02:28.300> how<00:02:28.600> many<00:02:28.780> are

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
need because of these how many are

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:29.730 
need because of these how many are
actually<00:02:28.990> going<00:02:29.290> to<00:02:29.350> grow

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
actually going to grow

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.520 
actually going to grow
who's<00:02:30.400> to<00:02:30.670> say<00:02:30.700> so<00:02:31.390> just<00:02:31.690> got<00:02:32.050> to<00:02:32.080> get<00:02:32.260> as<00:02:32.380> many

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
who's to say so just got to get as many

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.520 
who's to say so just got to get as many
as<00:02:32.650> you<00:02:32.800> can<00:02:32.830> that<00:02:33.660> is<00:02:34.660> about<00:02:34.900> one<00:02:35.110> peppers

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
as you can that is about one peppers

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.400 
as you can that is about one peppers
worth<00:02:35.740> of<00:02:35.980> seeds<00:02:36.360> it's<00:02:37.360> about<00:02:37.600> fifty<00:02:38.110> seeds

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
worth of seeds it's about fifty seeds

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.060 
worth of seeds it's about fifty seeds
roughly<00:02:39.370> give<00:02:40.120> or<00:02:40.150> take<00:02:40.450> so<00:02:40.930> that's<00:02:41.590> a<00:02:41.740> lot<00:02:41.920> of

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
roughly give or take so that's a lot of

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.160 
roughly give or take so that's a lot of
plants<00:02:42.430> but<00:02:42.610> I<00:02:42.850> got<00:02:43.330> a<00:02:43.360> lot<00:02:43.510> more<00:02:43.570> peppers<00:02:44.050> to

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
plants but I got a lot more peppers to

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.290 
plants but I got a lot more peppers to
go<00:02:44.320> there's<00:02:45.220> probably<00:02:45.430> a<00:02:45.520> lot<00:02:45.640> of<00:02:45.670> theories

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
go there's probably a lot of theories

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.760 
go there's probably a lot of theories
about<00:02:46.510> the<00:02:46.600> best<00:02:46.780> way<00:02:46.930> to<00:02:46.960> get<00:02:47.140> seeds<00:02:47.440> out<00:02:47.620> of

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
about the best way to get seeds out of

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.620 
about the best way to get seeds out of
here<00:02:47.980> and<00:02:48.160> I've<00:02:48.370> got<00:02:48.430> what<00:02:48.880> works<00:02:49.120> best<00:02:49.360> for<00:02:49.480> me

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
here and I've got what works best for me

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.170 
here and I've got what works best for me
which<00:02:49.960> is<00:02:50.170> you<00:02:50.920> just<00:02:51.130> cut<00:02:51.310> one<00:02:51.520> end<00:02:51.550> off<00:02:51.850> and

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
which is you just cut one end off and

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.680 
which is you just cut one end off and
then<00:02:53.400> once<00:02:54.400> you<00:02:54.520> cut<00:02:54.700> the<00:02:54.910> end<00:02:55.030> off<00:02:55.120> just<00:02:55.390> slid

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
then once you cut the end off just slid

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.040 
then once you cut the end off just slid
it<00:02:55.720> down<00:02:56.050> the<00:02:56.890> side<00:02:57.540> being<00:02:58.540> careful<00:02:58.870> not<00:02:58.900> to

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
it down the side being careful not to

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:00.480 
it down the side being careful not to
cut<00:02:59.320> open<00:02:59.440> your<00:02:59.680> gloves<00:02:59.950> that's<00:03:00.220> the<00:03:00.340> last

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:00.490 
cut open your gloves that's the last

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.790 
cut open your gloves that's the last
mistake<00:03:00.820> you<00:03:01.060> want<00:03:01.209> to<00:03:01.270> make<00:03:01.420> then<00:03:02.320> when<00:03:02.680> you

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
mistake you want to make then when you

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.610 
mistake you want to make then when you
peel<00:03:03.100> it<00:03:03.160> apart<00:03:03.400> now<00:03:04.360> it's<00:03:04.959> a<00:03:05.110> little<00:03:05.290> bit<00:03:05.440> of

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
peel it apart now it's a little bit of

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.620 
peel it apart now it's a little bit of
luck<00:03:05.860> on<00:03:06.190> this<00:03:06.790> part<00:03:07.060> but<00:03:07.209> when<00:03:07.330> you<00:03:07.390> peel<00:03:07.600> it

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
luck on this part but when you peel it

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.600 
luck on this part but when you peel it
apart<00:03:07.840> usually<00:03:08.590> you<00:03:08.650> can<00:03:08.800> pull<00:03:09.070> the<00:03:09.280> center

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
apart usually you can pull the center

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:14.250 
apart usually you can pull the center
section<00:03:09.940> out<00:03:10.810> of<00:03:11.550> the<00:03:12.550> pepper<00:03:12.820> ooh<00:03:13.209> this<00:03:14.050> one

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
section out of the pepper ooh this one

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.380 
section out of the pepper ooh this one
might<00:03:14.410> cooperate<00:03:14.650> and<00:03:15.220> then<00:03:15.850> once<00:03:16.000> you<00:03:16.090> pull

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
might cooperate and then once you pull

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.170 
might cooperate and then once you pull
the<00:03:16.420> center<00:03:16.900> out<00:03:17.140> the<00:03:18.010> pepper<00:03:18.250> itself<00:03:18.700> then<00:03:19.000> is

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
the center out the pepper itself then is

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.840 
the center out the pepper itself then is
absolutely<00:03:19.989> clean<00:03:20.430> well<00:03:21.430> I<00:03:21.459> guess<00:03:21.610> there's

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
absolutely clean well I guess there's

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.060 
absolutely clean well I guess there's
two<00:03:22.150> seeds<00:03:22.690> in<00:03:22.959> there<00:03:23.140> I'll<00:03:23.290> just<00:03:23.440> shake<00:03:23.860> those

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
two seeds in there I'll just shake those

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.370 
two seeds in there I'll just shake those
out<00:03:24.340> but<00:03:24.910> now<00:03:25.060> that<00:03:25.420> part<00:03:25.690> is<00:03:25.810> out<00:03:25.930> of<00:03:26.110> your<00:03:26.200> way

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
out but now that part is out of your way

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.460 
out but now that part is out of your way
who<00:03:26.739> needs<00:03:27.040> it<00:03:27.280> and<00:03:27.459> then<00:03:27.670> all<00:03:27.820> the<00:03:28.090> pieces

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
who needs it and then all the pieces

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.650 
who needs it and then all the pieces
just<00:03:29.470> stay<00:03:29.739> inside<00:03:30.220> and<00:03:31.030> then<00:03:31.209> once<00:03:31.390> all<00:03:31.540> the

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
just stay inside and then once all the

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.630 
just stay inside and then once all the
pieces<00:03:31.810> are<00:03:32.140> separated<00:03:32.680> or<00:03:32.769> all<00:03:33.250> the<00:03:33.400> seeds

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
pieces are separated or all the seeds

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.430 
pieces are separated or all the seeds
are<00:03:33.790> separated<00:03:34.209> out<00:03:34.300> it's<00:03:34.930> just<00:03:35.019> a<00:03:35.200> matter<00:03:35.350> of

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
are separated out it's just a matter of

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.949 
are separated out it's just a matter of
pulling<00:03:35.709> the<00:03:35.950> seeds<00:03:36.220> out<00:03:36.459> as<00:03:37.390> you<00:03:37.630> can<00:03:37.810> see

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
pulling the seeds out as you can see

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:40.229 
pulling the seeds out as you can see
from<00:03:38.080> the<00:03:38.260> refuse<00:03:38.620> pile<00:03:38.890> underneath<00:03:39.370> I'm<00:03:40.060> not

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
from the refuse pile underneath I'm not

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:42.090 
from the refuse pile underneath I'm not
doing<00:03:40.510> a<00:03:40.570> perfect<00:03:40.959> job<00:03:41.110> of<00:03:41.170> separating<00:03:41.530> seed

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
doing a perfect job of separating seed

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.400 
doing a perfect job of separating seed
from<00:03:42.519> pepper<00:03:43.709> but<00:03:44.709> I<00:03:44.890> can<00:03:45.130> refine<00:03:45.489> this<00:03:45.790> later

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
from pepper but I can refine this later

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
from pepper but I can refine this later
honestly<00:03:47.410> when<00:03:47.560> I'm<00:03:47.650> doing<00:03:47.890> this<00:03:48.010> part<00:03:48.250> I'm

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
honestly when I'm doing this part I'm

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.009 
honestly when I'm doing this part I'm
trying<00:03:48.610> to<00:03:48.790> get<00:03:48.910> it<00:03:49.000> done<00:03:49.150> as<00:03:49.330> fast<00:03:49.360> as

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
trying to get it done as fast as

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:52.949 
trying to get it done as fast as
possible<00:03:50.459> because<00:03:51.459> you<00:03:51.580> can<00:03:51.760> feel<00:03:52.330> and<00:03:52.660> it

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
possible because you can feel and it

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:54.750 
possible because you can feel and it
shouldn't<00:03:53.290> be<00:03:53.380> this<00:03:53.680> way<00:03:53.890> but<00:03:54.160> you<00:03:54.310> can<00:03:54.459> feel

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
shouldn't be this way but you can feel

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.330 
shouldn't be this way but you can feel
the<00:03:54.970> actual<00:03:55.120> pepper<00:03:55.560> trying<00:03:56.560> to<00:03:56.739> burn<00:03:57.010> through

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
the actual pepper trying to burn through

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.490 
the actual pepper trying to burn through
your<00:03:57.489> gloves<00:03:57.820> and<00:03:58.150> that's<00:03:58.480> not<00:03:58.810> right

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
your gloves and that's not right

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.009 
your gloves and that's not right
it's<00:03:59.680> just<00:03:59.980> not<00:04:00.190> fair<00:04:00.640> so<00:04:01.570> you<00:04:01.660> can<00:04:01.780> do<00:04:01.870> that

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
it's just not fair so you can do that

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:04.140 
it's just not fair so you can do that
plus<00:04:02.260> the<00:04:02.320> whole<00:04:02.769> time<00:04:02.980> I<00:04:03.190> honestly<00:04:03.640> am<00:04:03.910> now

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
plus the whole time I honestly am now

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.340 
plus the whole time I honestly am now
thinking<00:04:04.480> I<00:04:04.570> should<00:04:04.750> have<00:04:04.840> put<00:04:04.989> on<00:04:05.080> goggles

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350 
thinking I should have put on goggles

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.040 
thinking I should have put on goggles
because<00:04:06.160> my<00:04:06.400> eyes<00:04:06.610> have<00:04:06.820> been<00:04:06.910> watering<00:04:07.480> this

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:08.050 
because my eyes have been watering this

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:12.000 
because my eyes have been watering this
whole<00:04:08.350> time<00:04:08.709> so<00:04:10.260> just<00:04:11.260> can<00:04:11.500> this<00:04:11.680> done<00:04:11.890> as

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
whole time so just can this done as

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:13.530 
whole time so just can this done as
quick<00:04:12.220> as<00:04:12.340> possible<00:04:12.370> because<00:04:12.760> I<00:04:13.030> can<00:04:13.180> always

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
quick as possible because I can always

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.130 
quick as possible because I can always
sort<00:04:14.470> that<00:04:14.650> out<00:04:14.709> later<00:04:14.860> these<00:04:15.760> then<00:04:16.660> are<00:04:16.690> my

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:17.140 
sort that out later these then are my

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.880 
sort that out later these then are my
scorpions<00:04:17.859> and<00:04:18.690> this<00:04:19.690> is<00:04:19.959> my<00:04:20.200> first<00:04:20.500> year<00:04:20.650> for

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:20.890 
scorpions and this is my first year for

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:22.140 
scorpions and this is my first year for
two<00:04:21.010> things<00:04:21.220> with<00:04:21.430> the<00:04:21.520> Scorpion<00:04:21.910> it's<00:04:22.060> the

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
two things with the Scorpion it's the

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:23.610 
two things with the Scorpion it's the
first<00:04:22.360> year<00:04:22.510> of<00:04:22.570> growing<00:04:22.780> them<00:04:23.050> and<00:04:23.320> then<00:04:23.470> it's

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
first year of growing them and then it's

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:24.930 
first year of growing them and then it's
the<00:04:23.770> first<00:04:23.979> year<00:04:24.130> trying<00:04:24.340> to<00:04:24.430> harvest<00:04:24.610> the

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
the first year trying to harvest the

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.460 
the first year trying to harvest the
seeds<00:04:25.240> so<00:04:25.780> I<00:04:25.810> don't<00:04:25.990> really<00:04:26.110> know<00:04:26.260> what<00:04:26.440> to

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
seeds so I don't really know what to

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:27.270 
seeds so I don't really know what to
expect

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
expect

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.010 
expect
I<00:04:27.310> mean<00:04:27.550> it's<00:04:27.820> a<00:04:27.940> pepper<00:04:28.180> and<00:04:28.480> it<00:04:28.540> has<00:04:28.720> seeds

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
I mean it's a pepper and it has seeds

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.390 
I mean it's a pepper and it has seeds
inside<00:04:29.410> so<00:04:29.680> that's<00:04:29.800> not<00:04:30.070> going<00:04:30.190> to<00:04:30.280> surprise

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
inside so that's not going to surprise

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.800 
inside so that's not going to surprise
me<00:04:30.550> all<00:04:30.850> but<00:04:31.060> I<00:04:31.090> don't<00:04:31.270> really<00:04:31.450> know<00:04:31.600> how<00:04:31.750> many

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
me all but I don't really know how many

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.930 
me all but I don't really know how many
is<00:04:32.530> what<00:04:32.710> I'm<00:04:32.800> using<00:04:33.010> these<00:04:33.190> for<00:04:33.430> a<00:04:33.460> recipe<00:04:33.910> or

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
is what I'm using these for a recipe or

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.910 
is what I'm using these for a recipe or
whatever<00:04:34.420> I<00:04:34.480> you<00:04:34.600> just<00:04:35.020> don't<00:04:35.200> pay<00:04:35.350> attention

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:35.920 
whatever I you just don't pay attention

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.010 
whatever I you just don't pay attention
but<00:04:36.550> I<00:04:36.730> assume<00:04:37.090> the<00:04:37.240> harvest<00:04:37.570> is<00:04:37.690> going<00:04:37.780> to<00:04:37.900> be

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
but I assume the harvest is going to be

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:44.730 
but I assume the harvest is going to be
good<00:04:38.170> so<00:04:38.470> time<00:04:39.100> to<00:04:39.220> find<00:04:39.400> out<00:04:43.200> yeah<00:04:44.200> it<00:04:44.470> looks

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
good so time to find out yeah it looks

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.500 
good so time to find out yeah it looks
like<00:04:44.950> they're<00:04:45.130> all<00:04:45.160> just<00:04:45.760> about<00:04:46.060> the<00:04:46.270> same

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:46.510 
like they're all just about the same

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.310 
like they're all just about the same
these<00:04:46.750> are<00:04:46.900> pretty<00:04:47.170> little<00:04:47.500> peppers<00:04:47.980> so<00:04:49.320> just

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 
these are pretty little peppers so just

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.010 
these are pretty little peppers so just
another<00:04:50.530> you<00:04:51.460> know<00:04:51.550> fair<00:04:52.240> number<00:04:52.540> of<00:04:52.690> seeds

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
another you know fair number of seeds

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.380 
another you know fair number of seeds
and<00:04:53.500> you<00:04:54.310> know<00:04:54.430> how<00:04:54.670> many<00:04:54.850> people<00:04:55.180> are<00:04:55.270> going

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:55.390 
and you know how many people are going

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:57.780 
and you know how many people are going
to<00:04:55.450> need<00:04:55.690> this<00:04:55.900> many<00:04:56.170> probably<00:04:57.130> not<00:04:57.370> too<00:04:57.610> many

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
it is hard to speak right now I got I

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.170 
it is hard to speak right now I got I
breathed<00:05:08.260> in<00:05:08.530> just<00:05:09.070> as<00:05:09.220> I<00:05:09.310> cut<00:05:09.520> it<00:05:09.640> open<00:05:09.760> I<00:05:10.030> made

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:10.180 
breathed in just as I cut it open I made

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.120 
breathed in just as I cut it open I made
the<00:05:10.270> mistake<00:05:10.570> of<00:05:10.600> breathing<00:05:11.110> in<00:05:11.350> and<00:05:11.620> I<00:05:11.770> will

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:12.130 
the mistake of breathing in and I will

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.220 
the mistake of breathing in and I will
not<00:05:12.460> be<00:05:12.640> making<00:05:12.820> that<00:05:13.060> mistake<00:05:13.270> again<00:05:13.630> so<00:05:14.080> no

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:14.230 
not be making that mistake again so no

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:16.020 
not be making that mistake again so no
more<00:05:14.410> breathing<00:05:14.950> while<00:05:15.190> I'm<00:05:15.310> doing<00:05:15.640> this<00:05:15.760> I

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030 
more breathing while I'm doing this I

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:19.350 
more breathing while I'm doing this I
didn't<00:05:16.390> have<00:05:16.660> I<00:05:17.110> only<00:05:17.620> grew<00:05:17.920> the<00:05:18.280> one<00:05:18.550> plant

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 
didn't have I only grew the one plant

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.910 
didn't have I only grew the one plant
because<00:05:19.750> this<00:05:19.900> one<00:05:20.080> was<00:05:20.200> new<00:05:20.410> to<00:05:20.560> me<00:05:20.710> so<00:05:20.890> I

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:20.920 
because this one was new to me so I

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.830 
because this one was new to me so I
don't<00:05:21.010> really<00:05:21.340> have<00:05:21.490> a<00:05:21.640> ton<00:05:21.940> of<00:05:22.000> to<00:05:22.270> spare<00:05:22.660> and

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840 
don't really have a ton of to spare and

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.690 
don't really have a ton of to spare and
the<00:05:23.350> plant<00:05:23.590> just<00:05:23.860> didn't<00:05:24.130> do<00:05:24.280> very<00:05:24.310> well

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:24.700 
the plant just didn't do very well

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:27.390 
the plant just didn't do very well
either<00:05:25.660> but<00:05:26.590> I'm<00:05:26.800> going<00:05:26.950> to<00:05:26.980> have<00:05:27.160> way<00:05:27.370> more

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:27.400 
either but I'm going to have way more

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.720 
either but I'm going to have way more
seeds<00:05:27.970> so<00:05:28.870> I<00:05:29.320> can<00:05:29.620> experiment<00:05:30.190> a<00:05:30.400> little<00:05:30.610> bit

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:30.730 
seeds so I can experiment a little bit

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:33.300 
seeds so I can experiment a little bit
more<00:05:30.940> with<00:05:31.210> the<00:05:31.510> different<00:05:31.920> weather<00:05:32.920> types

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:33.310 
more with the different weather types

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:34.830 
more with the different weather types
how<00:05:33.610> much<00:05:33.790> Sun<00:05:34.030> I'm<00:05:34.150> going<00:05:34.300> to<00:05:34.360> let<00:05:34.510> it<00:05:34.540> have

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:34.840 
how much Sun I'm going to let it have

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.570 
how much Sun I'm going to let it have
because<00:05:35.710> at<00:05:35.860> first<00:05:36.070> I<00:05:36.190> thought<00:05:36.340> it<00:05:36.490> was

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:36.580 
because at first I thought it was

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:38.220 
because at first I thought it was
getting<00:05:36.670> too<00:05:36.970> much<00:05:37.150> Sun<00:05:37.510> and<00:05:37.810> then<00:05:37.930> it<00:05:38.020> turned

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:38.230 
getting too much Sun and then it turned

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:39.990 
getting too much Sun and then it turned
out<00:05:38.320> I<00:05:38.380> was<00:05:38.440> getting<00:05:38.650> not<00:05:38.950> enough<00:05:39.280> Sun<00:05:39.670> and

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000 
out I was getting not enough Sun and

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.900 
out I was getting not enough Sun and
then<00:05:40.960> it<00:05:41.380> was<00:05:41.560> getting<00:05:41.710> too<00:05:41.980> much<00:05:42.130> water<00:05:42.190> and

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:42.910 
then it was getting too much water and

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:44.910 
then it was getting too much water and
then<00:05:43.030> I<00:05:43.060> think<00:05:43.240> about<00:05:43.360> enough<00:05:43.720> water<00:05:44.020> so<00:05:44.470> I<00:05:44.680> can

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:44.920 
then I think about enough water so I can

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:48.330 
then I think about enough water so I can
have<00:05:45.220> quite<00:05:45.490> the<00:05:45.520> experiment<00:05:46.390> next<00:05:46.720> year<00:05:46.960> as<00:05:47.920> I

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:48.340 
have quite the experiment next year as I

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.100 
have quite the experiment next year as I
try<00:05:48.610> and<00:05:48.640> figure<00:05:48.880> out<00:05:49.000> the<00:05:49.120> really<00:05:49.750> the<00:05:49.960> best

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
try and figure out the really the best

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:51.420 
try and figure out the really the best
way<00:05:50.350> to<00:05:50.380> grow<00:05:50.590> these<00:05:50.800> because<00:05:51.040> I<00:05:51.130> think<00:05:51.190> I<00:05:51.400> got

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:51.430 
way to grow these because I think I got

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:53.850 
way to grow these because I think I got
the<00:05:51.700> ghost<00:05:51.880> pepper<00:05:52.150> down<00:05:52.390> pretty<00:05:52.690> good<00:05:52.860> so

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:53.860 
the ghost pepper down pretty good so

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:55.260 
the ghost pepper down pretty good so
feel<00:05:54.070> free<00:05:54.130> to<00:05:54.310> ask<00:05:54.460> questions<00:05:54.910> about<00:05:55.000> growing

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:55.270 
feel free to ask questions about growing

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:56.700 
feel free to ask questions about growing
ghost<00:05:55.660> peppers<00:05:56.050> I<00:05:56.170> think<00:05:56.350> I've<00:05:56.470> tried

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:56.710 
ghost peppers I think I've tried

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:00.480 
ghost peppers I think I've tried
everything<00:05:57.180> but<00:05:58.180> the<00:05:58.420> scorpions<00:05:59.080> I<00:05:59.490> still

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:00.490 
everything but the scorpions I still

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:02.820 
everything but the scorpions I still
have<00:06:00.610> a<00:06:00.640> lot<00:06:00.940> to<00:06:01.210> learn<00:06:01.510> so<00:06:02.050> this<00:06:02.320> is<00:06:02.500> the<00:06:02.650> last

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:02.830 
have a lot to learn so this is the last

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:06.420 
have a lot to learn so this is the last
one<00:06:03.330> last<00:06:04.330> batch<00:06:04.630> of<00:06:04.870> seeds<00:06:05.110> so<00:06:05.350> much<00:06:06.100> easier

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:06.430 
one last batch of seeds so much easier

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:08.580 
one last batch of seeds so much easier
getting<00:06:06.610> these<00:06:06.850> seeds<00:06:07.120> out<00:06:07.330> I<00:06:07.630> could<00:06:08.320> do<00:06:08.440> this

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:08.590 
getting these seeds out I could do this

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:10.110 
getting these seeds out I could do this
all<00:06:08.830> day<00:06:08.860> long<00:06:09.040> compared<00:06:09.760> to<00:06:09.850> the<00:06:09.940> ghost

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:10.120 
all day long compared to the ghost

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.960 
all day long compared to the ghost
pepper<00:06:10.420> it's<00:06:10.990> just<00:06:11.170> so<00:06:11.380> much<00:06:11.650> easier<00:06:11.850> to<00:06:12.850> get

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:12.970 
pepper it's just so much easier to get

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:13.980 
pepper it's just so much easier to get
them<00:06:13.090> all<00:06:13.150> so<00:06:13.300> much<00:06:13.420> more<00:06:13.600> like<00:06:13.750> a<00:06:13.780> traditional

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:13.990 
them all so much more like a traditional

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:18.420 
them all so much more like a traditional
pepper<00:06:15.180> this<00:06:16.180> is<00:06:16.330> the<00:06:16.480> pile<00:06:16.720> of<00:06:16.870> refuse<00:06:17.440> if<00:06:18.280> I

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:18.430 
pepper this is the pile of refuse if I

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:20.520 
pepper this is the pile of refuse if I
really<00:06:18.970> didn't<00:06:19.270> like<00:06:19.420> myself<00:06:19.720> I<00:06:20.200> would<00:06:20.350> just

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:20.530 
really didn't like myself I would just

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:21.930 
really didn't like myself I would just
get<00:06:20.680> a<00:06:20.710> fork<00:06:21.190> and<00:06:21.400> I<00:06:21.460> would<00:06:21.580> just<00:06:21.730> start

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:21.940 
get a fork and I would just start

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:24.690 
get a fork and I would just start
digging<00:06:22.420> in<00:06:22.660> I<00:06:22.920> you<00:06:23.920> know<00:06:24.010> it's<00:06:24.160> amazing<00:06:24.370> when

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:24.700 
digging in I you know it's amazing when

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:27.330 
digging in I you know it's amazing when
you<00:06:25.630> first<00:06:25.840> start<00:06:26.140> out<00:06:26.260> how<00:06:26.530> when<00:06:27.070> you<00:06:27.160> leave

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:27.340 
you first start out how when you leave

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:28.890 
you first start out how when you leave
like<00:06:27.490> four<00:06:27.820> or<00:06:27.910> five<00:06:27.970> seeds<00:06:28.390> behind

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:28.900 
like four or five seeds behind

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:31.260 
like four or five seeds behind
it's<00:06:29.290> like<00:06:29.470> I<00:06:29.590> got<00:06:29.890> to<00:06:30.010> get<00:06:30.100> each<00:06:30.250> one<00:06:30.550> but<00:06:31.120> then

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:31.270 
it's like I got to get each one but then

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:35.760 
it's like I got to get each one but then
in<00:06:31.510> the<00:06:31.690> end<00:06:31.720> when<00:06:32.080> you<00:06:32.110> have<00:06:33.870> this<00:06:34.870> many<00:06:35.170> ghost

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:35.770 
in the end when you have this many ghost

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:38.050 
in the end when you have this many ghost
peppers<00:06:36.220> and<00:06:36.460> you<00:06:37.120> have

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:38.060 
peppers and you have

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:41.050 
peppers and you have
this<00:06:38.270> many<00:06:38.570> scorpions<00:06:39.550> yeah<00:06:40.550> you<00:06:40.820> know<00:06:40.940> what

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:41.060 
this many scorpions yeah you know what
