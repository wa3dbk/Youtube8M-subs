it's a really amazing charity and it's
one<00:01:45.960> that<00:01:46.140> I<00:01:46.259> wanted<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:46.770> use<00:01:46.920> for<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:47.159> while<00:01:47.310> but

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
one that I wanted to use for a while but

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.030 
one that I wanted to use for a while but
like<00:01:48.030> I<00:01:48.119> said<00:01:48.180> really<00:01:48.869> small<00:01:49.229> channel<00:01:49.590> not

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
like I said really small channel not

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.980 
like I said really small channel not
that<00:01:50.310> many<00:01:50.490> viewers<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.270> it's<00:01:51.420> hard<00:01:51.689> to<00:01:51.810> do

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
that many viewers and it's hard to do

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.080 
that many viewers and it's hard to do
but<00:01:52.290> hopefully<00:01:53.009> we<00:01:53.189> can<00:01:53.369> still<00:01:53.579> make<00:01:53.759> a<00:01:53.790> lot<00:01:54.030> of
