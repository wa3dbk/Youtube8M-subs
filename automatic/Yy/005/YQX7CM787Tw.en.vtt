00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:03.269 
you possibly can just got a bug by just

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:06.100 
you possibly can just got a bug by just
sticking<00:01:03.449> it<00:01:03.570> just<00:01:03.870> like<00:01:03.960> that<00:01:04.460> you<00:01:05.460> pull<00:01:05.730> down

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
sticking it just like that you pull down

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.220 
sticking it just like that you pull down
keep<00:01:07.110> dragging<00:01:07.500> it<00:01:07.590> down<00:01:08.210> so<00:01:09.210> it's<00:01:09.360> about<00:01:09.630> now

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:10.230 
keep dragging it down so it's about now

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:11.930 
keep dragging it down so it's about now
you're<00:01:10.350> probably<00:01:10.380> going<00:01:10.770> down<00:01:11.010> about<00:01:11.280> half<00:01:11.790> an

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:11.940 
you're probably going down about half an

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.020 
you're probably going down about half an
inch<00:01:12.120> and<00:01:12.690> then<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:12.900> pull<00:01:13.080> it<00:01:13.170> out

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
inch and then you pull it out

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.150 
inch and then you pull it out
just<00:01:15.030> like<00:01:15.150> that<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.570> then<00:01:16.500> you<00:01:16.590> thread<00:01:16.980> all

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:17.160 
just like that and then you thread all

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.820 
just like that and then you thread all
the<00:01:17.190> way<00:01:17.310> up<00:01:17.520> so<00:01:18.300> now<00:01:18.420> you<00:01:18.480> have<00:01:18.720> that<00:01:18.930> make

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
the way up so now you have that make

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.560 
the way up so now you have that make
sure<00:01:20.010> it's<00:01:20.130> completely<00:01:20.490> straight<00:01:21.000> so<00:01:21.450> it

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
sure it's completely straight so it

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.420 
sure it's completely straight so it
doesn't<00:01:21.810> kill<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:21.990> action<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:22.650> if<00:01:23.220> you<00:01:23.280> look

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
doesn't kill the action and if you look

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.940 
doesn't kill the action and if you look
in<00:01:23.550> the<00:01:23.640> water<00:01:23.790> right<00:01:24.300> here<00:01:24.530> I'm<00:01:25.530> not<00:01:25.710> sure<00:01:25.860> if

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
in the water right here I'm not sure if

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.710 
in the water right here I'm not sure if
you<00:01:26.010> can<00:01:26.130> see<00:01:26.280> that<00:01:26.520> but<00:01:27.180> you'll<00:01:27.330> see<00:01:27.510> what<00:01:27.630> it

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
you can see that but you'll see what it

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:28.100 
you can see that but you'll see what it
does

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
does

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
each time I bounce my rod tip it's

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.460 
each time I bounce my rod tip it's
kicking<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.420> worm<00:01:30.570> up<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:30.960> down<00:01:31.080> like<00:01:31.260> that

you exactly how to use them

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.120 
you exactly how to use them
you<00:01:38.689> pretty<00:01:38.869> much<00:01:38.960> have<00:01:39.109> the<00:01:39.350> same<00:01:39.469> technique

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
you pretty much have the same technique

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.330 
you pretty much have the same technique
for<00:01:41.229> same<00:01:42.229> technique<00:01:42.560> jigging<00:01:42.979> as<00:01:43.100> you<00:01:43.219> do

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
for same technique jigging as you do

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.370 
for same technique jigging as you do
with<00:01:43.549> a<00:01:43.579> drop<00:01:44.270> shot<00:01:44.479> or<00:01:44.509> the<00:01:44.840> split<00:01:45.020> shots<00:01:45.259> as

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
with a drop shot or the split shots as

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.350 
with a drop shot or the split shots as
well<00:01:45.530> they<00:01:46.520> just<00:01:46.549> thought<00:01:46.820> they'd<00:01:47.030> catch<00:01:47.179> that

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
well they just thought they'd catch that

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.029 
well they just thought they'd catch that
big<00:01:47.539> fish'<00:01:47.869> shot<00:01:48.110> he<00:01:48.289> used<00:01:48.469> to<00:01:48.560> travel<00:01:48.710> or<00:01:48.920> me

00:01:49.029 --> 00:01:49.039 
big fish' shot he used to travel or me

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:52.230 
big fish' shot he used to travel or me
so<00:01:49.189> whole<00:01:49.369> one<00:01:49.549> but<00:01:49.850> but<00:01:50.390> this<00:01:50.630> split<00:01:50.960> shot<00:01:51.170> it

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
so whole one but but this split shot it

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.380 
so whole one but but this split shot it
tough<00:01:53.240> it<00:01:53.390> out<00:01:53.479> there<00:01:54.819> you<00:01:55.819> know<00:01:55.909> let<00:01:56.090> it<00:01:56.119> seek

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
tough it out there you know let it seek

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:57.850 
tough it out there you know let it seek
near<00:01:56.569> the<00:01:56.719> bottom<00:01:56.869> now<00:01:57.259> that<00:01:57.439> there's<00:01:57.619> a<00:01:57.709> lot

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
near the bottom now that there's a lot

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.859 
near the bottom now that there's a lot
of<00:01:57.890> if<00:01:58.850> you<00:01:58.939> look<00:01:59.090> in<00:01:59.179> this<00:01:59.299> water<00:01:59.569> I'm<00:01:59.750> gonna

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
of if you look in this water I'm gonna

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:02.770 
of if you look in this water I'm gonna
see<00:02:00.289> it<00:02:00.380> but<00:02:00.590> there's<00:02:01.219> a<00:02:01.280> lot<00:02:01.369> of<00:02:01.520> branches<00:02:02.450> and

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
see it but there's a lot of branches and

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.199 
see it but there's a lot of branches and
grass<00:02:02.840> and<00:02:03.049> you<00:02:03.979> don't<00:02:04.130> want<00:02:04.310> it<00:02:04.399> to<00:02:04.640> actually

00:02:05.199 --> 00:02:05.209 
grass and you don't want it to actually

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:06.999 
grass and you don't want it to actually
hit<00:02:05.479> the<00:02:05.539> bottom<00:02:05.929> so<00:02:06.079> get<00:02:06.259> stuck<00:02:06.469> in<00:02:06.619> that<00:02:06.649> so

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
hit the bottom so get stuck in that so

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:09.550 
hit the bottom so get stuck in that so
let<00:02:07.729> it<00:02:07.819> sink<00:02:08.030> a<00:02:08.090> couple<00:02:08.360> seconds<00:02:08.690> and<00:02:08.899> if<00:02:09.530> you

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
let it sink a couple seconds and if you

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.610 
let it sink a couple seconds and if you
look<00:02:10.540> down<00:02:11.540> see<00:02:11.690> my<00:02:11.810> rod<00:02:12.019> tip<00:02:12.230> up<00:02:12.319> and<00:02:12.440> down

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
look down see my rod tip up and down

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.970 
look down see my rod tip up and down
real<00:02:13.400> slow<00:02:13.670> and<00:02:14.480> really<00:02:15.290> lean<00:02:15.530> just<00:02:15.709> fast

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
real slow and really lean just fast

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.350 
real slow and really lean just fast
enough<00:02:16.099> to<00:02:16.370> keep<00:02:16.489> all<00:02:16.640> the<00:02:16.760> slack<00:02:17.000> out<00:02:17.180> of<00:02:17.239> my

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
enough to keep all the slack out of my

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.970 
enough to keep all the slack out of my
mind

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
mind

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.339

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
what your what your worms doing over

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:25.020 
what your what your worms doing over
there<00:02:22.390> at<00:02:22.480> all<00:02:22.599> times<00:02:22.840> a<00:02:23.790> real<00:02:24.790> lightweight

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
there at all times a real lightweight

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.140 
there at all times a real lightweight
rod

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.899 

a<00:02:30.180> lot<00:02:30.780> of<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:30.930> higher-end<00:02:31.140> rods<00:02:31.560> -<00:02:31.860> I<00:02:32.069> mean<00:02:32.459> he

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:32.909 
a lot of the higher-end rods - I mean he

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:34.160 
a lot of the higher-end rods - I mean he
looks<00:02:33.150> a<00:02:33.239> lot<00:02:33.390> more<00:02:33.540> fish<00:02:33.750> with<00:02:33.780> the<00:02:34.049> higher

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
looks a lot more fish with the higher

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.369 
looks a lot more fish with the higher
end<00:02:34.409> rods<00:02:35.209> you<00:02:36.209> just<00:02:36.390> have<00:02:36.540> so<00:02:36.750> much<00:02:36.900> more<00:02:37.110> fill

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379 
end rods you just have so much more fill

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:45.860 
end rods you just have so much more fill
so<00:02:38.010> let's<00:02:38.190> see

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.309 

a<00:02:46.019> lot<00:02:46.500> of<00:02:46.530> times<00:02:46.799> you<00:02:46.980> want<00:02:47.190> to<00:02:47.340> a<00:02:48.080> lot<00:02:49.080> of<00:02:49.170> time

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
a lot of times you want to a lot of time

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:51.470 
a lot of times you want to a lot of time
for<00:02:49.530> fish<00:02:49.709> when<00:02:50.099> the<00:02:50.220> real<00:02:50.370> finicky<00:02:50.819> they'll

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
for fish when the real finicky they'll

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.119 
for fish when the real finicky they'll
just<00:02:51.690> kind<00:02:51.870> of<00:02:51.989> they'll<00:02:52.440> hit<00:02:52.650> it<00:02:52.680> and<00:02:52.980> they'll

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:53.129 
just kind of they'll hit it and they'll

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:56.240 
just kind of they'll hit it and they'll
sit<00:02:53.340> there<00:02:54.200> or<00:02:55.200> sometimes<00:02:55.709> they<00:02:55.860> hit<00:02:55.980> it<00:02:56.129> and

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
sit there or sometimes they hit it and

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.830 
sit there or sometimes they hit it and
run<00:02:56.280> with<00:02:56.370> it<00:02:56.610> but<00:02:56.819> as<00:02:57.000> you're<00:02:57.510> bouncing<00:02:57.780> the

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
run with it but as you're bouncing the

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.630 
run with it but as you're bouncing the
rod<00:02:57.959> tip<00:02:58.140> you<00:02:58.260> can't<00:02:58.470> really<00:02:58.650> feel<00:02:58.890> it<00:02:58.950> so

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
rod tip you can't really feel it so

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.759 
rod tip you can't really feel it so
what's<00:03:00.209> a<00:03:00.330> good<00:03:00.450> tip<00:03:00.720> is<00:03:00.870> to<00:03:00.930> watch<00:03:01.409> your<00:03:01.560> line

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
what's a good tip is to watch your line

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:03.979 
what's a good tip is to watch your line
if<00:03:02.430> you<00:03:02.579> see<00:03:02.730> your<00:03:02.849> line<00:03:03.090> doing<00:03:03.299> anything<00:03:03.720> but

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
if you see your line doing anything but

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:05.420 
if you see your line doing anything but
we're<00:03:04.530> going<00:03:04.739> up<00:03:04.890> and<00:03:05.040> down<00:03:05.159> in<00:03:05.340> a<00:03:05.400> straight

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
we're going up and down in a straight

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.059 
we're going up and down in a straight
line<00:03:05.819> that<00:03:06.060> means<00:03:06.209> you're<00:03:06.360> getting<00:03:06.480> bit<00:03:07.069> like

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
line that means you're getting bit like

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:09.649 
line that means you're getting bit like
your<00:03:08.220> line<00:03:08.370> will<00:03:08.549> shoot<00:03:08.760> left<00:03:09.060> real<00:03:09.269> quick<00:03:09.510> or

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:09.659 
your line will shoot left real quick or

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:13.339 
your line will shoot left real quick or
shoot<00:03:09.840> right<00:03:10.049> so<00:03:10.230> just<00:03:10.379> drill<00:03:10.590> down<00:03:12.140> one<00:03:13.140> more

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349 
shoot right so just drill down one more

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:16.069 
shoot right so just drill down one more
test<00:03:13.590> I<00:03:13.920> went<00:03:14.670> on<00:03:14.760> what<00:03:15.030> I'm<00:03:15.150> doing<00:03:15.180> is<00:03:15.659> I'm

test I went on what I'm doing is I'm

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:17.869 
test I went on what I'm doing is I'm

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
definitely wanna switch keep switching

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:49.740

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
which was it was probably hot for good

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.119 
which was it was probably hot for good
probably<00:03:55.390> get<00:03:55.510> 10<00:03:55.689> minutes<00:03:55.870> then<00:03:56.260> the<00:03:56.920> fish

00:03:57.119 --> 00:03:57.129 
probably get 10 minutes then the fish

00:03:57.129 --> 00:03:58.830 
probably get 10 minutes then the fish
just<00:03:57.370> kind<00:03:57.640> of<00:03:57.730> completely<00:03:58.390> went<00:03:58.540> off<00:03:58.659> that

orange silver trout worm it's nailing
them<00:04:06.579> and<00:04:07.150> then<00:04:07.359> you<00:04:07.569> know<00:04:07.599> the<00:04:07.780> bike<00:04:07.959> shut

them and then you know the bike shut

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:09.750 
them and then you know the bike shut
down<00:04:08.349> so<00:04:08.620> we<00:04:08.769> switched<00:04:09.010> over<00:04:09.159> the<00:04:09.370> new<00:04:09.489> color
