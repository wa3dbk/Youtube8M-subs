26 inches because I wanted to try a full
bundle<00:00:32.880> install<00:00:33.360> because<00:00:33.870> I've<00:00:34.170> never<00:00:34.200> done

that<00:00:34.829> before<00:00:35.010> so<00:00:35.489> I<00:00:35.910> thought<00:00:36.360> let<00:00:36.630> me<00:00:36.750> just

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
that before so I thought let me just

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.380 
that before so I thought let me just
purchase<00:00:37.350> an<00:00:37.500> extra<00:00:37.860> bundle<00:00:38.190> of<00:00:38.309> 26<00:00:38.879> inches

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
and this is the hair so I believe this

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.799

is<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.510> 22<00:00:43.020> inch<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:43.980> as<00:00:44.340> you<00:00:44.610> can<00:00:44.789> see<00:00:44.820> it's

is the 22 inch and as you can see it's

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.520 
is the 22 inch and as you can see it's
quite<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.590> nice<00:00:47.010> decent<00:00:47.489> length<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.530> the

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
quite a nice decent length and the

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.380 
quite a nice decent length and the
colors<00:00:49.890> they<00:00:50.070> sent<00:00:50.399> me<00:00:50.579> are<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.180> natural

colors they sent me are the natural

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.540 
colors they sent me are the natural
black<00:00:51.780> because<00:00:52.350> I<00:00:52.469> requested<00:00:53.010> that<00:00:53.190> obviously

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
black because I requested that obviously

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.689 
black because I requested that obviously
for<00:00:53.850> blending<00:00:54.390> purposes<00:00:55.079> I<00:00:55.289> want<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.340> try<00:00:56.579> and

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
for blending purposes I want to try and

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.490 
for blending purposes I want to try and
keep<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.030> hair<00:00:57.300> in<00:00:57.629> its<00:00:57.780> virgin<00:00:58.170> state<00:00:58.469> I

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
keep the hair in its virgin state I

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.369 
keep the hair in its virgin state I
don't<00:00:58.800> want<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:59.010> diet<00:00:59.309> because<00:01:00.270> I<00:01:00.600> think<00:01:01.199> it's

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
don't want to diet because I think it's

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.950 
don't want to diet because I think it's
a<00:01:01.530> huge<00:01:01.770> difference<00:01:02.370> when<00:01:02.489> you<00:01:02.879> die<00:01:03.210> virgin

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
a huge difference when you die virgin

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.050 
a huge difference when you die virgin
hair<00:01:04.229> obviously<00:01:04.439> as<00:01:05.010> opposed<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.549> keeping<00:01:05.909> it

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
hair obviously as opposed to keeping it

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.420 
hair obviously as opposed to keeping it
in<00:01:06.210> its<00:01:06.360> natural<00:01:06.540> state<00:01:06.780> so<00:01:07.619> this<00:01:07.950> is<00:01:08.189> the

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
in its natural state so this is the

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.679 
in its natural state so this is the
first<00:01:08.700> bundle<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:11.150> this<00:01:12.150> is<00:01:12.330> how<00:01:12.479> it<00:01:12.659> comes

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.180 
still going still going and that's the
end<00:02:05.189> so<00:02:05.939> as<00:02:06.210> you<00:02:06.450> can<00:02:06.630> see<00:02:06.899> you<00:02:07.229> get<00:02:07.469> quite<00:02:07.920> a

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
end so as you can see you get quite a

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.330 
end so as you can see you get quite a
lot<00:02:08.220> of<00:02:08.520> hair<00:02:08.940> on<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.629> weft<00:02:09.929> and<00:02:10.319> this<00:02:11.039> is<00:02:11.190> the

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
lot of hair on the weft and this is the

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.440 
lot of hair on the weft and this is the
22<00:02:11.730> inch

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
22 inch

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.839 
22 inch
even<00:02:12.870> in<00:02:12.989> the<00:02:13.140> longer<00:02:13.560> length<00:02:13.770> you're<00:02:14.489> getting

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 
even in the longer length you're getting

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:16.369 
even in the longer length you're getting
quite<00:02:15.090> a<00:02:15.120> lot<00:02:15.360> of<00:02:15.480> hair<00:02:15.690> which<00:02:15.720> is<00:02:16.020> really

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299 
this is the 14-inch bundle and once

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:42.050 
this is the 14-inch bundle and once
again<00:02:39.540> as<00:02:39.989> you<00:02:40.170> can<00:02:40.349> see<00:02:40.620> the<00:02:40.830> wedding<00:02:41.340> is<00:02:41.670> very

again as you can see the wedding is very

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.740 
again as you can see the wedding is very
very<00:02:42.390> nice<00:02:42.750> it's<00:02:43.200> neat<00:02:44.299> so<00:02:45.299> that's<00:02:45.510> what<00:02:45.720> that

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
very nice it's neat so that's what that

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.920 
very nice it's neat so that's what that
looks<00:02:46.200> like<00:02:46.319> and<00:02:46.799> this<00:02:47.150> is<00:02:48.150> a<00:02:48.180> nice<00:02:48.450> thick

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
looks like and this is a nice thick

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.270 
looks like and this is a nice thick
bundle<00:02:49.610> also<00:02:50.610> as<00:02:50.880> you<00:02:51.120> can<00:02:51.360> see<00:02:51.690> and<00:02:52.040> I<00:02:53.040> will

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
bundle also as you can see and I will

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.610 
bundle also as you can see and I will
say<00:02:53.489> this<00:02:53.760> luster<00:02:54.450> is<00:02:55.730> low<00:02:56.730> to<00:02:56.810> medium<00:02:57.810> it<00:02:58.380> does

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
say this luster is low to medium it does

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.530 
say this luster is low to medium it does
look<00:02:58.650> a<00:02:58.950> lot<00:02:59.099> shiny<00:02:59.489> because<00:02:59.970> I've<00:03:00.120> got<00:03:00.329> my

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
look a lot shiny because I've got my

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.210 
look a lot shiny because I've got my
light<00:03:00.810> directly<00:03:01.489> on<00:03:02.489> me<00:03:02.910> but<00:03:04.069> it's<00:03:05.069> definitely

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
light directly on me but it's definitely

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.000 
light directly on me but it's definitely
not<00:03:06.060> as<00:03:06.329> silky<00:03:06.900> as<00:03:06.989> I'm<00:03:07.230> sure<00:03:07.260> what<00:03:07.680> it<00:03:07.799> looks

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
not as silky as I'm sure what it looks

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.400 
not as silky as I'm sure what it looks
like<00:03:08.190> on<00:03:08.430> camera<00:03:08.970> so<00:03:09.690> yeah<00:03:09.840> I<00:03:09.870> shouldn't<00:03:10.290> have

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
like on camera so yeah I shouldn't have

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.280 
like on camera so yeah I shouldn't have
too<00:03:10.620> much<00:03:10.650> problems<00:03:11.430> with<00:03:11.700> the<00:03:11.910> blending<00:03:12.450> so

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
too much problems with the blending so

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.430 
too much problems with the blending so
that's<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:13.799> 14<00:03:14.340> and<00:03:14.700> actually<00:03:15.569> my<00:03:15.959> mistake

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
that's the 14 and actually my mistake

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.190 
that's the 14 and actually my mistake
this<00:03:16.709> seems<00:03:17.010> to<00:03:17.220> be<00:03:17.250> the<00:03:17.579> 22<00:03:18.150> because<00:03:18.660> it's<00:03:18.989> a

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
this seems to be the 22 because it's a

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.400 
this seems to be the 22 because it's a
lot<00:03:19.440> shorter<00:03:19.730> than<00:03:20.730> this<00:03:21.299> bundle<00:03:21.660> here<00:03:22.139> which

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
lot shorter than this bundle here which

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:28.220 
lot shorter than this bundle here which
is<00:03:22.709> the<00:03:23.150> 26<00:03:24.150> so<00:03:25.019> that's<00:03:25.319> a<00:03:25.500> 22<00:03:26.190> there<00:03:26.519> and<00:03:27.230> 26

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
is the 26 so that's a 22 there and 26

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.360 
is the 26 so that's a 22 there and 26
let's<00:03:28.500> check<00:03:28.799> the<00:03:29.010> length<00:03:29.220> difference<00:03:31.370> okay

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
let's check the length difference okay

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.199 
let's check the length difference okay
so<00:03:32.430> the<00:03:32.910> 22<00:03:33.230> finishes<00:03:34.230> there<00:03:34.560> and<00:03:34.799> the<00:03:35.489> 26

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
so the 22 finishes there and the 26

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:41.960 
so the 22 finishes there and the 26
finishes<00:03:36.989> down<00:03:37.260> there<00:03:38.569> now<00:03:39.569> the<00:03:39.630> ends<00:03:40.620> are<00:03:40.970> not

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
finishes down there now the ends are not

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.990 
finishes down there now the ends are not
too<00:03:42.630> bad<00:03:43.049> they're<00:03:43.709> not<00:03:43.739> too<00:03:44.160> scraggly<00:03:44.579> so

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
too bad they're not too scraggly so

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.449 
too bad they're not too scraggly so
that's<00:03:45.209> a<00:03:45.389> good<00:03:45.600> thing<00:03:46.130> that's<00:03:47.130> what<00:03:47.310> they

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
that's a good thing that's what they

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.160 
that's a good thing that's what they
look<00:03:47.639> like<00:03:47.700> i'll<00:03:48.030> probably<00:03:48.239> trim<00:03:48.720> a<00:03:48.870> little

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
look like i'll probably trim a little

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.650 
look like i'll probably trim a little
bit<00:03:49.530> of<00:03:49.709> that<00:03:49.799> off<00:03:50.220> but<00:03:50.609> I'm<00:03:50.850> not<00:03:51.090> too<00:03:51.329> fussed

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
bit of that off but I'm not too fussed

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.530 
bit of that off but I'm not too fussed
about<00:03:51.930> that<00:03:52.440> so<00:03:53.250> just<00:03:53.549> running<00:03:53.940> my<00:03:54.120> hands

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
about that so just running my hands

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.620 
about that so just running my hands
through<00:03:54.569> the<00:03:54.840> other<00:03:55.200> 26<00:03:55.920> and<00:03:56.280> my<00:03:57.060> fingers<00:03:57.510> are

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
through the other 26 and my fingers are

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.690 
through the other 26 and my fingers are
running<00:03:57.930> through<00:03:58.230> very<00:03:58.530> smoothly<00:03:59.010> very

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
running through very smoothly very

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:05.330 
running through very smoothly very
easily<00:04:01.940> no<00:04:02.940> snags<00:04:03.420> it's<00:04:03.870> not<00:04:04.079> tangling<00:04:04.769> so

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
easily no snags it's not tangling so

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.640 
easily no snags it's not tangling so
that's<00:04:05.609> a<00:04:05.790> good<00:04:06.030> thing<00:04:06.269> as<00:04:06.480> well<00:04:06.720> so<00:04:07.319> that's

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
that's a good thing as well so that's

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.229 
that's a good thing as well so that's
one<00:04:08.609> of<00:04:08.819> the<00:04:08.970> 26<00:04:09.419> a--'s<00:04:10.079> and<00:04:11.030> like<00:04:12.030> i<00:04:12.180> said

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
one of the 26 a--'s and like i said

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:15.259 
one of the 26 a--'s and like i said
before<00:04:12.510> my<00:04:12.840> mistake<00:04:13.260> this<00:04:13.470> is<00:04:13.739> the<00:04:14.190> 22<00:04:14.579> so<00:04:15.060> once

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
before my mistake this is the 22 so once

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:17.839 
before my mistake this is the 22 so once
again<00:04:15.450> running<00:04:16.079> my<00:04:16.200> fingers<00:04:16.620> through<00:04:16.650> it<00:04:16.919> no

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:17.849 
again running my fingers through it no
