00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.290
 hello dear friends today 

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:09.460
 I will tell you how to charge the battery at 

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:15.540
 machines us a switch like this 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:15.540
 This is in my opinion 60 amp charger times such 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:24.250
 611 I will show the connection process to 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:27.420
 we charge the battery accordingly 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:37.319
 on the case should not have connected be 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:39.850
 connecting the plug will pass by stick our 

00:00:37.319 --> 00:00:44.710
 here we are looking to be exposed 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:46.139
 12 volts here we are only 6 and 12 is 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:53.139
 switch between 

00:00:46.139 --> 00:00:56.670
 connect minus first then 

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:59.979
 we connect plus 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.629
 yes even forgot to say that if you are from 

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:02.829
 meters kneading for a while 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:05.950
 keep warm 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:08.410
 that he could defrost inside 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:11.110
 insert a basin with warm water not because 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:13.120
 hot with warm water to put in to 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.460
 he warmed up but in no case 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.350
 burn and because hot can everything 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.230
 released for something can body 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.150
 burst all we hooked follow me 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:24.150
 showed you 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.590
 accordingly, the internal display 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:30.240
 when will i burn 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:33.940
 1 you maximum 10 cheek got a number 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.920
 starting minimum but fifty percent 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.290
 percent 75100 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.300
 and maximum, respectively, when 1 pack 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.440
 your battery will burn 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:45.310
 charged 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.210
 Here is another thing in my opinion that the charger allows 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.480
 support 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.080
 at the maximum it just doesnâ€™t support 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.480
 charges 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.640
 let's say so support on the same 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:57.400
 level 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:00.430
 battery all battery each have current 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.950
 self discharge discharge and compliance 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:06.730
 charger helps keep this charge 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:10.590
 I want to finish the maximum 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.590
 to the outsiders see you soon
