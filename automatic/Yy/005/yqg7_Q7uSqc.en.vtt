00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.910 
past month probably on on to air and
social<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.630> social<00:01:21.930> networking<00:01:22.259> sites<00:01:22.619> and

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
social and social networking sites and

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.760 
social and social networking sites and
obviously<00:01:23.700> I<00:01:23.759> know<00:01:23.909> I<00:01:24.330> tried<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.229> ignore<00:01:25.590> that

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
obviously I know I tried to ignore that

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.560 
obviously I know I tried to ignore that
but<00:01:25.979> obviously<00:01:26.280> it<00:01:26.520> was<00:01:26.580> it<00:01:26.939> was<00:01:27.060> so<00:01:27.210> much<00:01:27.360> I

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
but obviously it was it was so much I

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.450 
but obviously it was it was so much I
thought<00:01:27.750> maybe<00:01:27.990> maybe<00:01:28.439> this<00:01:28.710> this<00:01:29.189> could<00:01:29.369> be

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
thought maybe maybe this this could be

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.039 
thought maybe maybe this this could be
my<00:01:29.579> chance<00:01:29.790> I<00:01:30.030> could<00:01:30.090> get<00:01:30.329> a<00:01:30.390> cool<00:01:30.630> up<00:01:30.810> but

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
my chance I could get a cool up but

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.080 
my chance I could get a cool up but
until<00:01:31.290> until<00:01:32.130> I<00:01:32.189> got<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.670> got<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.880> phone<00:01:33.060> call

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
until until I got and got the phone call

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.300 
until until I got and got the phone call
I<00:01:33.299> didn't<00:01:33.659> I<00:01:33.810> didn't<00:01:34.470> think<00:01:34.710> of<00:01:34.829> it<00:01:34.920> as<00:01:35.070> I<00:01:35.189> was

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
I didn't I didn't think of it as I was

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.160 
I didn't I didn't think of it as I was
going<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.490> get<00:01:35.610> a<00:01:35.640> call<00:01:35.820> up<00:01:35.850> but<00:01:36.210> but<00:01:36.869> like<00:01:37.049> I

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
going to get a call up but but like I

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.350 
going to get a call up but but like I
said<00:01:37.380> I<00:01:37.470> got<00:01:37.619> a<00:01:37.680> call<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.130> I'm<00:01:38.909> so<00:01:39.180> proud

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
said I got a call and I'm so proud

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.969 
said I got a call and I'm so proud
equally<00:01:40.140> that<00:01:40.259> I<00:01:40.290> mean<00:01:40.439> obviously<00:01:40.560> it<00:01:40.829> was

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
equally that I mean obviously it was

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.319 
equally that I mean obviously it was
spoken<00:01:41.159> about<00:01:41.400> before<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.820> last<00:01:42.000> friend<00:01:42.240> he

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
spoken about before the last friend he

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.910 
spoken about before the last friend he
wasn't<00:01:42.600> it<00:01:42.750> didn't<00:01:42.990> happen<00:01:43.259> so<00:01:43.380> I<00:01:43.439> guess<00:01:43.649> that

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
wasn't it didn't happen so I guess that

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.139 
wasn't it didn't happen so I guess that
was<00:01:44.009> perhaps<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.399> reason<00:01:44.610> why<00:01:44.820> you<00:01:44.880> had<00:01:45.060> to

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
was perhaps the reason why you had to

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.130 
was perhaps the reason why you had to
try<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.420> keep<00:01:45.479> your<00:01:45.630> feet<00:01:45.750> on<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:45.930> ground

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
try and keep your feet on the ground

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.020 
try and keep your feet on the ground
over<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.439> last<00:01:46.560> month<00:01:46.770> or<00:01:46.920> so<00:01:46.950> yeah<00:01:47.520> I<00:01:47.549> got<00:01:47.880> um

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
when obviously Adam Jay and Ricky got

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.429 
when obviously Adam Jay and Ricky got
that<00:01:50.640> call<00:01:50.850> I<00:01:51.450> got<00:01:51.899> told<00:01:52.079> that<00:01:52.170> I<00:01:52.290> was<00:01:52.380> on

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
like this do you start thinking about

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.630 
like this do you start thinking about
the<00:02:10.200> people<00:02:10.500> who<00:02:10.619> played<00:02:11.129> a<00:02:11.160> part<00:02:11.459> in<00:02:11.580> your

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
the people who played a part in your

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.280 
the people who played a part in your
career<00:02:12.030> and

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
career and

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.619 
career and
experiences<00:02:12.799> you've<00:02:12.920> had<00:02:13.430> yeah<00:02:14.000> mass<00:02:14.269> Olivia

experiences you've had yeah mass Olivia

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:17.110 
experiences you've had yeah mass Olivia
and<00:02:14.750> I<00:02:15.140> think<00:02:15.530> a<00:02:15.620> big<00:02:15.799> part<00:02:15.829> of<00:02:16.099> it<00:02:16.280> is<00:02:16.400> maybe<00:02:16.909> on

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
and I think a big part of it is maybe on

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.089 
and I think a big part of it is maybe on
the<00:02:17.450> pitches<00:02:17.810> the<00:02:17.930> coaches<00:02:18.319> and<00:02:18.439> stuff<00:02:18.620> but<00:02:18.890> I

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:19.099 
the pitches the coaches and stuff but I

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:21.580 
the pitches the coaches and stuff but I
think<00:02:19.730> I<00:02:19.939> think<00:02:20.120> the<00:02:20.450> main<00:02:20.599> reason<00:02:20.629> is<00:02:21.049> is<00:02:21.349> my

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
think I think the main reason is is my

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.860 
think I think the main reason is is my
family<00:02:21.920> you<00:02:22.010> know<00:02:22.129> my<00:02:22.370> mom<00:02:22.819> and<00:02:22.849> dad<00:02:23.030> spent<00:02:23.719> a
