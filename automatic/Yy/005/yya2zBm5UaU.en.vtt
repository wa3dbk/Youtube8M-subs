00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:05.009
 yes guys that's because 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:09.050
 today we find ourselves for 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:11.070
 the episode life of the king of tournai marc is 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:13.679
 good we will start directly 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.049
 so I was a little late and I 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:20.699
 excuse I had some problems of 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:23.220
 connection it's pretty boring 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.560
 coke problems and I had arrived 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.019
 not to porthole of my video every time 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.980
 flexible to debate the connection planted and 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:34.910
 my computer with so I do not know but 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.290
 now I hope it will work 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.870
 I did I started all over again 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.450
 editing all that I hope this video 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.969
 will succeed in sup the aude so the time when 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.300
 I make this video it is 19:30 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:51.390
 so I let you blind me lose the 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.829
 gameplay does not sing too much that's 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.690
 just the technique it's just the 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.090
 technical to shred media so yes I 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:02.340
 said I make the video it is 19:30 on the 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:04.890
 Tuesday the 26th so here is these songs 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.020
 and so that's good we can see that I 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.299
 not badly invested in the teeth the 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.650
 players to make the purchase resale 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:13.229
 so we can see that I had diakité 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.400
 defensive mileu 11 miles to 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.990
 try to romance a little bit more 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.229
 expensive 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:22.710
 ms we always continue with them today 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:27.060
 there that is basic since the beginning lola 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.290
 so do not forget 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.180
 lyon players also it does not hurt 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:35.100
 year vercoutre lacazette clement attic 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:38.009
 mvuemba also 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.140
 it's called dabo which is not bad it's 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.060
 really not bad 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.700
 this player the lions players they are 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.079
 really not bad for the charming 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.840
 so here we continue to always 8th 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.670
 so let's mls I try to do it at 5 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.189
 hundred of profits so it's always 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.439
 That's it, we're going to say paul tieleman 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.990
 the oci a magnificent player for the purchase 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.250
 resale 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.570
 I'm really keen I think 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.990
 it was with him that I made the most of 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.369
 more profit it seems to me I can 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.280
 see who is a very complete guardian 1 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.680
 for a Jan janitor it is very complete 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:14.730
 and 75 dive 

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:16.380
 77 of reflexes and that's seventy of 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.670
 clearance and everything else at cias 70 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.060
 its share the speed such map that me 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:26.490
 seems so here she is she back to me too no 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:28.710
 badly 4606 go away try so here we go 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.990
 start I'm not going too much 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:34.530
 make the profits to dead you see 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:36.210
 what I mean is like you 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.310
 want to say I prefer to take my time 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:39.570
 advanced quietly and not me 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:46.920
 rush like crazy 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:49.860
 so here we count so here's all 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.280
 sold separately a year end only you 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:55.440
 see in a few seconds 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:58.590
 So here is diakité gone to 13000 all that 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.330
 also left so a paul parent 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.980
 tieleman who is not gone yet but 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:05.010
 I think you'll see that after going 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.630
 go away so here I accelerate this moment 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.700
 because it was long enough and for 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.110
 rendering is passed and not enough 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.660
 powerful let's say do not let that 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.160
 I did I forgot 2 g / t on sky 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.470
 then I forgot the joystick actually 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:19.620
 I was disturbed we will say a 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:22.920
 trill so here's a movie on I'm going 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:26.690
 7900 put one white 8100 1100 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:29.580
 I think I did right away 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:32.160
 yeah gt gt intrigued by skype there I 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:35.670
 talk is a buddy so yeah 8100 I 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:38.820
 believe I'm going to master it then 7900 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:41.810
 final another point of tillman you 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.810
 see that it works really well 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:50.209
 I invested quite a lot of credit 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:54.360
 on a lot of bpl players 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:57.260
 so here is mbbl npower chain and the d1 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:59.520
 Belgian with call me back too 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:04.200
 after that there is still a lot of credit 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:06.780
 so I wanted to still closed 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.459
 after if I did for example 20000 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.620
 profits in a single episode 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:11.430
 was not funny we'll say it was going 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.770
 move too fast 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:17.310
 so here I prefer to take my time 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:19.850
 advanced quietly so here it is 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.850
 the best we will say 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:23.139
 told you that I was thinking about a 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.880
 project king you pay bremen at the beach with 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:27.330
 a buddy 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.330
 so here we go 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:40.810
 where there was a little bug sorry there is 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:42.070
 had a little bug I do not know if it's going to 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.020
 see in the montage but there was a 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:47.050
 little bug 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:50.880
 so that's it then I accelerate I accelerated 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:53.320
 all this moment all those moments sorry 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:55.510
 so sorry for the little white everything to 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.160
 the time I thought I had to say 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:01.690
 planted mingling done second he took over 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:04.600
 so it's hard to do a round of 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:08.590
 game with a pretty old pc i'm going 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:09.270
 invest in a big pc we will say good 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.770
 pc 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:13.030
 I hope he's made that front pretty 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:16.300
 quickly because it's starting 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:18.640
 really to annoy parents made of 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:23.950
 nine minutes takes three hours two 

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:26.830
 hours but 2h 2h30 it's pretty boring 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:28.930
 so here is where we can see that 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:30.790
 I have 33000 credit so here I could 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.440
 even do a lot more with 33 but I 

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:35.400
 could still do a lot more 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:37.620
 profits but I preferred to stop there 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:41.790
 plus there was a little bit of 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:44.380
 delay to the episode I did just after 

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:45.970
 just after three days and normally 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:49.360
 I had to like the upe say it 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:51.460
 but when you explain them there was 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:54.700
 I had connection problems so 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:59.130
 So here that is all sold and I 

00:05:54.700 --> 00:06:04.360
 am at 60 1955 credit which is not bad 

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:08.170
 which is very good even ok so that's 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:10.000
 really very well so that's it 

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:11.830
 approaches the end of the video while 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.300
 sold themselves there will be a little bug that 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:14.440
 I think you'll see there will be 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.990
 a little bit that it gives me the players 

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.890
 I do not know why you do not want it 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:19.780
 did not want to take off I do not know 

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:21.010
 why did that make me thank you for having 

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:24.210
 watched in the video we end up 

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:24.210
 very very soon to eca auto -
