It is they who hold the

00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.703 
wisdom of generations.

00:00:07.707 --> 00:00:07.773
They understand what it takes
to make medicine the old way.

Sione is a father

who knows the old ways.

00:00:17.683 --> 00:00:17.750 
He learned from his
parents, grandparents

00:00:20.853 --> 00:00:20.920 
and local healers [background

&gt;&gt; These men and women
are but a few of those

00:03:05.918 --> 00:03:05.985 
who [background noise]
maintain a medicinal garden.

00:03:08.988 --> 00:03:09.055 
These are the ones who
have the knowledge of where

00:03:11.924 --> 00:03:11.991 
to locate medicinal
plants found in the bush.

00:03:14.226 --> 00:03:14.293 line:92%
In the numerous market places

00:03:16.562 --> 00:03:16.629 
around our islands can
be seen a wide variety

00:03:18.397 --> 00:03:18.464 line:92%
of healing plants and medicines.

00:03:21.633 --> 00:03:21.700
Although these medicinal plants
were once abundant in the bush,

00:03:25.771 --> 00:03:25.838 
they are becoming
scarce with the expansion

00:03:27.773 --> 00:03:27.840 size:81% position:41% line:92%
of farming for cash crops.

[Pause] When one among us dies,

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.217 
the women must gather
together to cry and to mourn.

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.887 
It is a good thing to
mourn for the departed.

00:03:44.824 --> 00:03:44.891
Traditions surrounding death
and burial express our respect

00:03:47.627 --> 00:03:47.693 
for the deceased and
strengthen family ties.

[Mourning and chanting] As
night falls in our islands,

00:03:52.631 --> 00:03:52.698 
the sounds of mourning
are heard.

00:03:55.868 --> 00:03:55.935 
A respected woman of
the village has died.

00:04:00.707 --> 00:04:00.773
In spite of the best efforts
of the healers and the doctors

00:04:05.878 --> 00:04:05.945 
in the hospital, we
must all die some time.

00:04:11.884 --> 00:04:11.951 
Following time honored
traditions, her body is prepared

00:04:14.721 --> 00:04:14.787

laid to rest.

&gt;&gt; And so, our lives go on day
and night, birth and death.

00:04:57.062 --> 00:04:57.129 
As the elders move
on to the next life,

00:04:59.932 --> 00:04:59.999 
the little ones continue
to come.

00:05:02.668 --> 00:05:02.735 
As one old mother
leaves this existence,

00:05:04.904 --> 00:05:04.970 
a young mother will
continue to rely

00:05:06.806 --> 00:05:06.872 line:92%
on the skills of the midwife.

00:05:09.142 --> 00:05:09.208 
The cycles that govern
our lives continue

00:05:11.877 --> 00:05:11.944 line:92%
on generation after generation.

00:05:17.016 --> 00:05:17.082

or "the wheel goes around."

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.486 
As we stand at the dawn
of a new millennium,

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:24.656 size:84% position:42% line:92%
the world is changing fast.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:27.326
Even our remote island kingdom
cannot escape the influences

00:05:29.962 --> 00:05:30.029 
of the outside world
yet in spite of change,

00:05:33.766 --> 00:05:33.833 
our tradition seemed
to have found a way

00:05:36.068 --> 00:05:36.135 
of existing alongside
of the new.

00:05:39.104 --> 00:05:39.171
Perhaps it is our kinship and
our respect for our ancestors

00:05:43.542 --> 00:05:43.609 
that carries over to a respect
for the old ways and maybe

00:05:47.546 --> 00:05:47.613 size:78% position:39%
that the new ways do not
satisfy all of our needs.

00:05:50.749 --> 00:05:50.816 
Whatever the reason,
it is certain

00:05:54.753 --> 00:05:54.820 
that our traditional kau faito'o
healers are as much a part

00:05:57.556 --> 00:05:57.623 size:88% position:44% line:92%
of our culture as the ocean.

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:00.826 
And like our ocean, it
is hard to imagine life

without our kau faito'o.
