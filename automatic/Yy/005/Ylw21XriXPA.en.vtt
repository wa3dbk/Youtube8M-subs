around<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:00.960> perimeter<00:02:01.140> actually<00:02:02.100> but<00:02:02.250> it's

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
around the perimeter actually but it's

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.020 
around the perimeter actually but it's
hard<00:02:02.579> to<00:02:02.759> separate<00:02:03.240> it<00:02:03.420> when<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.659> whole<00:02:03.750> thing

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
hard to separate it when the whole thing

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.969 
hard to separate it when the whole thing
still<00:02:04.330> straight<00:02:04.690> so<00:02:06.030> anyhow<00:02:07.030> I<00:02:07.649> cut<00:02:08.649> it<00:02:08.830> in

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
still straight so anyhow I cut it in
