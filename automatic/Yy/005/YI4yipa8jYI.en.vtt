00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:11.350 
gives teams like us a chance to really

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:15.339 
gives teams like us a chance to really
make<00:00:12.350> the<00:00:12.500> chase<00:00:13.599> that<00:00:14.599> allows<00:00:14.809> more<00:00:15.050> team

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:15.349 
make the chase that allows more team

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:17.410 
make the chase that allows more team
more<00:00:16.189> teams<00:00:16.430> opportunity<00:00:16.910> to<00:00:16.970> make<00:00:17.090> the<00:00:17.180> chase

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:17.420 
more teams opportunity to make the chase

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.810 
more teams opportunity to make the chase
so<00:00:18.230> I<00:00:18.259> like<00:00:18.740> it<00:00:18.920> I<00:00:19.040> like<00:00:19.099> the<00:00:19.400> way<00:00:19.520> it's<00:00:19.700> going

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:19.820 
so I like it I like the way it's going

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.300 
so I like it I like the way it's going
to<00:00:19.880> go<00:00:19.970> down<00:00:20.390> and<00:00:20.619> we<00:00:21.619> would<00:00:21.800> certainly<00:00:21.980> make

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:22.310 
to go down and we would certainly make

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.460 
to go down and we would certainly make
the<00:00:22.430> chase<00:00:22.669> to<00:00:23.119> our<00:00:23.419> last<00:00:23.689> three<00:00:23.960> years<00:00:24.140> if

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:24.470 
the chase to our last three years if

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:25.990 
the chase to our last three years if
these<00:00:24.980> rules<00:00:25.250> that<00:00:25.399> have<00:00:25.489> been<00:00:25.610> in<00:00:25.880> effect

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.000 
these rules that have been in effect

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.690 
these rules that have been in effect
earlier<00:00:26.540> so<00:00:27.439> we<00:00:27.470> like<00:00:27.770> we<00:00:28.040> like<00:00:28.220> the<00:00:28.399> fact<00:00:28.430> that

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:28.700 
earlier so we like we like the fact that

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.549 
earlier so we like we like the fact that
the<00:00:28.880> new<00:00:29.029> rules<00:00:29.239> are<00:00:29.390> being<00:00:29.480> changed<00:00:29.869> it's

00:00:30.549 --> 00:00:30.559 
the new rules are being changed it's

00:00:30.559 --> 00:00:37.660 
the new rules are being changed it's
going<00:00:30.710> to<00:00:30.800> help<00:00:30.860> teams<00:00:31.130> like<00:00:31.309> ours<00:00:31.430> no<00:00:31.669> doubt

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.090 

it's<00:00:38.570> going<00:00:38.690> to<00:00:38.750> change<00:00:38.809> really<00:00:39.589> if<00:00:39.769> you<00:00:39.949> get

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
it's going to change really if you get

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.590 
it's going to change really if you get
locked<00:00:40.280> in<00:00:40.429> early<00:00:40.730> if<00:00:40.879> you<00:00:40.940> want<00:00:41.030> a<00:00:41.210> razor<00:00:41.420> in

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
locked in early if you want a razor in

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.229 
locked in early if you want a razor in
the<00:00:41.870> first<00:00:42.109> say<00:00:42.350> ten<00:00:42.980> races<00:00:43.190> you<00:00:43.940> can<00:00:44.059> really

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
the first say ten races you can really

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:46.270 
the first say ten races you can really
use<00:00:44.329> the<00:00:44.629> next<00:00:44.870> twenty<00:00:45.230> odd<00:00:45.350> races<00:00:45.829> just<00:00:46.159> to

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
use the next twenty odd races just to

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.819 
use the next twenty odd races just to
develop<00:00:46.670> and<00:00:46.789> test<00:00:46.940> and<00:00:47.210> get<00:00:47.300> team<00:00:47.629> ready<00:00:47.899> for

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:48.829 
develop and test and get team ready for

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:52.599 
develop and test and get team ready for
that<00:00:49.039> chase<00:00:49.570> so<00:00:50.570> if<00:00:51.199> you<00:00:51.379> do<00:00:51.530> win<00:00:51.829> you're<00:00:52.489> going

00:00:52.599 --> 00:00:52.609 
that chase so if you do win you're going

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:54.880 
that chase so if you do win you're going
to<00:00:52.670> become<00:00:52.760> very<00:00:53.210> desperate<00:00:53.780> to<00:00:54.559> win<00:00:54.680> more

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
to become very desperate to win more

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.770 
to become very desperate to win more
races<00:00:55.280> once<00:00:55.460> the<00:00:55.579> chase<00:00:55.789> starts<00:00:56.210> I<00:00:56.360> think

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
races once the chase starts I think

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.180 
races once the chase starts I think
leading<00:00:57.079> up<00:00:57.199> to<00:00:57.350> the<00:00:57.469> chase<00:00:57.680> it's<00:00:57.920> going<00:00:58.039> to<00:00:58.100> be

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
leading up to the chase it's going to be

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:59.950 
leading up to the chase it's going to be
kind<00:00:58.309> of<00:00:58.430> normal<00:00:58.789> but<00:00:59.390> once<00:00:59.629> you<00:00:59.809> actually

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
kind of normal but once you actually

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.389 
kind of normal but once you actually
you're<00:01:00.409> in<00:01:00.589> the<00:01:00.680> chase<00:01:00.890> it's<00:01:01.129> going<00:01:01.250> to<00:01:01.309> become

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:01.399 
you're in the chase it's going to become

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:03.549 
you're in the chase it's going to become
quite<00:01:01.760> desperate<00:01:02.269> because<00:01:02.719> it's<00:01:03.289> going<00:01:03.439> to<00:01:03.500> be

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
quite desperate because it's going to be

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:05.679 
quite desperate because it's going to be
really<00:01:03.739> easy<00:01:03.859> to<00:01:04.159> get<00:01:04.309> you<00:01:05.180> know<00:01:05.269> get<00:01:05.420> pushed

more<00:02:52.870> interesting<00:02:53.440> we've<00:02:54.070> got<00:02:54.190> to<00:02:54.220> be<00:02:54.340> mindful

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
more interesting we've got to be mindful

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:55.920 
more interesting we've got to be mindful
we're<00:02:55.210> spending<00:02:55.390> a<00:02:55.510> lot<00:02:55.660> of<00:02:55.690> time<00:02:55.780> thinking

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
we're spending a lot of time thinking

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.350 
we're spending a lot of time thinking
about<00:02:56.320> the<00:02:56.590> qualifying<00:02:57.040> format<00:02:57.460> and<00:02:58.060> it

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
about the qualifying format and it

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.550 
about the qualifying format and it
really<00:02:58.540> doesn't<00:02:58.870> make<00:02:58.930> any<00:02:59.140> difference<00:02:59.320> in

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
really doesn't make any difference in

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.920 
really doesn't make any difference in
the<00:02:59.620> race<00:02:59.800> outcome<00:03:00.220> so<00:03:00.610> I<00:03:00.880> think<00:03:01.270> you<00:03:01.660> know<00:03:01.690> we

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
the race outcome so I think you know we

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.720 
the race outcome so I think you know we
all<00:03:02.050> have<00:03:02.080> to<00:03:02.320> just<00:03:02.530> treat<00:03:02.980> Friday<00:03:03.310> as<00:03:03.610> an

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
all have to just treat Friday as an

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.150 
all have to just treat Friday as an
individual<00:03:04.150> day<00:03:04.360> and<00:03:04.660> then<00:03:05.530> work<00:03:05.740> on<00:03:05.890> our<00:03:06.010> race

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
individual day and then work on our race

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.890

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
it's going to make it more exciting for

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.150 
it's going to make it more exciting for
the<00:03:10.600> fans<00:03:10.660> more<00:03:11.500> interesting<00:03:11.980> for<00:03:12.070> the

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
the fans more interesting for the

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.460 
the fans more interesting for the
drivers<00:03:12.580> and<00:03:12.820> certainly<00:03:13.200> you<00:03:14.200> know<00:03:14.230> there's

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
drivers and certainly you know there's

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:15.810 
drivers and certainly you know there's
going<00:03:14.590> to<00:03:14.680> be<00:03:14.740> a<00:03:14.800> lot<00:03:14.980> of<00:03:15.010> strategy<00:03:15.520> that<00:03:15.700> goes

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
going to be a lot of strategy that goes

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.330 
going to be a lot of strategy that goes
down<00:03:16.120> and<00:03:16.510> as<00:03:16.930> the<00:03:17.080> season<00:03:17.470> done<00:03:17.590> lines<00:03:17.890> and

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
down and as the season done lines and

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.670 
down and as the season done lines and
and<00:03:18.760> comes<00:03:19.390> into<00:03:19.630> its<00:03:19.750> own<00:03:19.870> you're<00:03:20.500> going<00:03:20.620> to

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
and comes into its own you're going to

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.040 
and comes into its own you're going to
see<00:03:20.830> that<00:03:20.860> strategy<00:03:21.310> change<00:03:21.670> what<00:03:22.630> works<00:03:22.780> one

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050 
see that strategy change what works one

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:30.789 
see that strategy change what works one
week<00:03:23.260> won't<00:03:23.440> won't<00:03:23.980> work<00:03:24.250> the<00:03:24.370> next

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:30.799 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:33.410 

you<00:03:31.799> could<00:03:31.980> be<00:03:32.069> really<00:03:32.280> mindful<00:03:32.549> off<00:03:32.819> and<00:03:33.150> so<00:03:33.390> I

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
you could be really mindful off and so I

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.449 
you could be really mindful off and so I
think<00:03:33.540> that<00:03:33.750> protecting<00:03:34.709> your<00:03:34.860> spot<00:03:35.159> for<00:03:35.400> the

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
think that protecting your spot for the

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:37.789 
think that protecting your spot for the
first<00:03:35.700> round<00:03:35.939> get<00:03:36.930> you<00:03:37.049> in<00:03:37.140> the<00:03:37.260> game<00:03:37.470> four

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
first round get you in the game four

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:39.380 
first round get you in the game four
rounds<00:03:38.159> two<00:03:38.310> and<00:03:38.340> three<00:03:38.670> of<00:03:38.730> qualifying<00:03:39.180> and

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
rounds two and three of qualifying and

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:40.940 
rounds two and three of qualifying and
that's<00:03:39.959> what<00:03:40.140> I'm<00:03:40.260> really<00:03:40.470> thinking<00:03:40.590> about

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
that's what I'm really thinking about

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.210 
that's what I'm really thinking about
the<00:03:41.370> most<00:03:41.579> is<00:03:41.909> you<00:03:42.750> know<00:03:42.840> not<00:03:42.870> not<00:03:43.769> making<00:03:44.189> a

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
the most is you know not not making a
