00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
steady aim pro so i'm taking an unusual

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.080 
steady aim pro so i'm taking an unusual
route<00:00:25.380> away<00:00:25.980> from<00:00:26.189> spawn<00:00:26.519> because<00:00:26.849> it<00:00:26.970> lets

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
route away from spawn because it lets

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.249 
route away from spawn because it lets
you<00:00:27.240> see<00:00:27.480> over<00:00:27.929> the<00:00:28.019> top<00:00:28.199> of<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.380> map<00:00:29.509> to<00:00:30.509> try

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:31.259 
you see over the top of the map to try

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:35.300 
you see over the top of the map to try
and<00:00:31.380> see<00:00:31.529> where<00:00:31.650> they<00:00:31.769> spawn<00:00:33.830> so<00:00:34.830> I<00:00:34.890> come

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:35.310 
and see where they spawn so I come

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:36.980 
and see where they spawn so I come
around<00:00:35.430> here<00:00:35.610> with<00:00:35.640> my<00:00:35.850> shotgun<00:00:36.060> because<00:00:36.810> it's

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:36.990 
around here with my shotgun because it's

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:38.420 
around here with my shotgun because it's
quite<00:00:37.260> close<00:00:37.500> this<00:00:37.680> is<00:00:37.890> this<00:00:38.100> is<00:00:38.280> actually

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
quite close this is this is actually

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.090 
quite close this is this is actually
where<00:00:38.700> they<00:00:38.850> spawn<00:00:39.180> so<00:00:39.690> I<00:00:39.720> make<00:00:40.530> a<00:00:40.560> mental<00:00:41.040> note

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
where they spawn so I make a mental note

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.750 
where they spawn so I make a mental note
of<00:00:41.280> that<00:00:41.840> I'm<00:00:43.190> hope<00:00:44.190> everyone<00:00:44.490> had<00:00:44.580> a<00:00:44.610> good

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
shotgun so I just basically do laps of

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.680 
shotgun so I just basically do laps of
these<00:02:18.080> oil<00:02:18.470> drums<00:02:18.950> their<00:02:19.459> spawn<00:02:19.910> and<00:02:20.239> the<00:02:20.510> two

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.720 
warehouses back there's quite a good way
to<00:02:23.150> go<00:02:23.480> because<00:02:24.190> especially<00:02:25.190> if<00:02:25.430> you've<00:02:25.550> got<00:02:25.700> a

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
to go because especially if you've got a

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.140 
to go because especially if you've got a
UAV<00:02:26.060> it<00:02:26.360> lights<00:02:26.600> up<00:02:26.840> nice<00:02:27.700> so<00:02:28.700> you<00:02:28.790> can<00:02:28.940> see

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
UAV it lights up nice so you can see

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.840 
UAV it lights up nice so you can see
where<00:02:29.330> everyone<00:02:29.930> is<00:02:30.190> unless<00:02:31.190> they<00:02:31.370> using<00:02:31.640> cold

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:03.890 
basically the key to doing well on this

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:06.520 
basically the key to doing well on this
map<00:05:04.130> I<00:05:04.280> find<00:05:04.580> is<00:05:04.760> to<00:05:04.910> keep<00:05:05.120> moving<00:05:05.390> like<00:05:06.230> make

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530 
map I find is to keep moving like make

map I find is to keep moving like make
yourself<00:05:07.040> a<00:05:07.220> route<00:05:07.490> obviously<00:05:08.120> well<00:05:08.660> not

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:08.870 
yourself a route obviously well not

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:12.520 
yourself a route obviously well not

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:18.380 
the middle or stay all the way around

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.950 
the middle or stay all the way around
the<00:05:18.710> outside<00:05:18.820> or<00:05:19.820> maybe<00:05:20.030> you<00:05:20.300> just<00:05:20.330> want<00:05:20.720> to<00:05:20.810> go

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:22.970 
straight through the middle hide in the

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:24.010 
straight through the middle hide in the
middle<00:05:23.180> or<00:05:23.270> go<00:05:23.450> in<00:05:23.540> one<00:05:23.690> of<00:05:23.720> the<00:05:23.840> houses

middle or go in one of the houses

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:25.900 
middle or go in one of the houses
because<00:05:24.770> I<00:05:24.920> mean<00:05:25.070> you<00:05:25.160> could<00:05:25.340> just<00:05:25.370> patrol

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:25.910 
because I mean you could just patrol

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:27.700 
because I mean you could just patrol
these<00:05:26.090> houses<00:05:26.630> you'd<00:05:26.810> still<00:05:27.110> get<00:05:27.230> a<00:05:27.290> good<00:05:27.440> few

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:27.710 
these houses you'd still get a good few

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:34.810 
these houses you'd still get a good few
kills<00:05:29.710> so<00:05:30.710> like<00:05:30.980> I<00:05:31.130> said<00:05:32.680> throw<00:05:33.680> grenade<00:05:34.550> into

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:34.820 
kills so like I said throw grenade into

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:36.880 
kills so like I said throw grenade into
that<00:05:35.120> place<00:05:35.330> this<00:05:35.660> is<00:05:35.870> a<00:05:36.050> good<00:05:36.320> place<00:05:36.530> to<00:05:36.740> throw

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:36.890

lot of people try to go down through it

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:47.560 
lot of people try to go down through it
and<00:05:45.410> it's<00:05:45.860> especially<00:05:46.520> if<00:05:46.790> they<00:05:46.910> spawn<00:05:47.270> near

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:47.570 
and it's especially if they spawn near

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:49.240 
and it's especially if they spawn near
there<00:05:47.870> that's<00:05:48.200> really<00:05:48.770> the<00:05:49.010> route<00:05:49.220> that

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.250 
there that's really the route that

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:52.690 
there that's really the route that
everyone<00:05:49.790> seems<00:05:50.060> to<00:05:50.210> take<00:05:50.510> there<00:05:51.230> they<00:05:51.350> go<00:05:51.700> and

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:52.700 
everyone seems to take there they go and

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:54.190 
everyone seems to take there they go and
look<00:05:52.850> for<00:05:52.910> your<00:05:53.120> majority<00:05:53.360> of<00:05:53.570> people<00:05:53.900> go<00:05:54.020> that

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:54.200 
look for your majority of people go that

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.560 
look for your majority of people go that
way<00:05:54.410> and<00:05:54.650> only<00:05:55.520> if<00:05:55.610> you<00:05:55.820> go<00:05:56.030> the<00:05:56.180> other<00:05:56.210> way<00:05:56.360> or

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:56.570 
way and only if you go the other way or

way and only if you go the other way or
so<00:05:56.780> I've<00:05:56.990> seen<00:05:57.410> from<00:05:58.060> playing<00:05:59.060> this<00:05:59.990> map<00:06:00.230> a<00:06:00.260> lot

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.560 
so I've seen from playing this map a lot

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.200 
so I've seen from playing this map a lot
I<00:06:00.740> mean<00:06:00.770> this<00:06:01.070> is<00:06:01.130> probably<00:06:01.400> my<00:06:01.610> favorite<00:06:01.640> map

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:02.210

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:19.580 
this because I recorded a while ago did

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.610 
this because I recorded a while ago did
a<00:06:19.610> commentary<00:06:20.180> they're<00:06:20.900> screwed<00:06:21.200> up<00:06:21.380> on<00:06:21.530> it

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:21.620

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:26.900 
haven't read done it sooner because I

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:28.960

winning kill here so I gets it again in
slow<00:06:30.620> motion<00:06:31.180> with<00:06:32.180> my<00:06:32.330> shotgun<00:06:32.570> I<00:06:32.930> wasn't

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:33.470 
slow motion with my shotgun I wasn't

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:35.320 
slow motion with my shotgun I wasn't
even<00:06:33.650> aware<00:06:33.770> it<00:06:34.280> was<00:06:34.400> just<00:06:34.729> a<00:06:34.820> lucky<00:06:35.030> winning

kill<00:06:35.600> to<00:06:35.780> be<00:06:35.810> honest<00:06:36.280> so<00:06:37.280> get<00:06:37.490> him<00:06:37.669> and<00:06:38.570> I<00:06:38.630> think

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:38.990 
kill to be honest so get him and I think
