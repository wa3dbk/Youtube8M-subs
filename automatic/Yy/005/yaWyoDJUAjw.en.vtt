00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
we're going to do in polymer clay

we're going to do in polymer clay
classroom<00:00:43.469> is<00:00:43.559> we're<00:00:43.680> going<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:43.860> show<00:00:44.040> how<00:00:44.309> you

classroom is we're going to show how you
can<00:00:44.789> work<00:00:45.000> with<00:00:45.059> cabochon<00:00:45.809> with<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.230> clay<00:00:46.440> and

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
can work with cabochon with the clay and

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.819 
can work with cabochon with the clay and
this<00:00:47.579> is<00:00:47.700> an<00:00:47.820> example<00:00:48.149> right<00:00:48.450> here<00:00:48.829> the

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
this is an example right here the

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.939 
this is an example right here the
cabochon<00:00:50.399> and<00:00:50.870> what<00:00:51.870> it<00:00:51.960> did<00:00:52.140> with<00:00:52.260> this<00:00:52.500> is<00:00:52.800> I

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
cabochon and what it did with this is I

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.549 
cabochon and what it did with this is I
used<00:00:53.129> one<00:00:53.309> of<00:00:53.340> Lisa<00:00:53.610> Pavelka<00:00:54.210> rubber<00:00:55.110> stamps

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
used one of Lisa Pavelka rubber stamps

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.799 
used one of Lisa Pavelka rubber stamps
and<00:00:55.649> this<00:00:55.770> one<00:00:55.920> is<00:00:56.010> called<00:00:56.190> five<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:56.969> you<00:00:57.690> can

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
and this one is called five and you can

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.330 
and this one is called five and you can
find<00:00:57.989> them<00:00:58.109> at<00:00:58.199> her<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.590> her<00:00:58.800> site<00:00:59.039> we'll<00:00:59.219> put

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
find them at her and her site we'll put

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.819 
find them at her and her site we'll put
a<00:00:59.399> link<00:00:59.579> up<00:00:59.760> there<00:00:59.969> and<00:01:00.600> what<00:01:01.350> I<00:01:01.379> did<00:01:01.559> was<00:01:01.710> I

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
a link up there and what I did was I

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.090 
a link up there and what I did was I
stamped<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.640> then<00:01:02.699> I<00:01:03.210> used<00:01:03.570> actually<00:01:04.559> Cernik

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
stamped and then I used actually Cernik

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.140 
stamped and then I used actually Cernik
brand<00:01:05.369> clay<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:06.390> they<00:01:07.320> have<00:01:07.939> clay<00:01:08.939> that

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
brand clay and they have clay that

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.050 
brand clay and they have clay that
already<00:01:09.450> has<00:01:09.630> inclusions<00:01:10.619> in<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:10.979> so<00:01:11.820> let<00:01:11.970> me

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
already has inclusions in it so let me

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.929 
already has inclusions in it so let me
show<00:01:12.240> you<00:01:12.299> that<00:01:12.600> clay<00:01:13.049> or<00:01:13.560> D<00:01:13.680> comes<00:01:13.939> included

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
show you that clay or D comes included

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.080 
show you that clay or D comes included
let<00:01:15.570> me<00:01:15.630> see<00:01:15.780> if<00:01:15.840> you<00:01:15.900> can<00:01:16.020> see<00:01:16.259> that<00:01:16.640> I<00:01:17.640> think

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
let me see if you can see that I think

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.109 
let me see if you can see that I think
this<00:01:18.630> is<00:01:18.689> very<00:01:19.080> different<00:01:19.619> from<00:01:20.070> some<00:01:20.939> of<00:01:21.030> the

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
this is very different from some of the

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.670 
this is very different from some of the
other<00:01:21.270> brands<00:01:21.780> on<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:21.960> market<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.590> the

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
other brands on the market and the

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.060 
other brands on the market and the
reason<00:01:22.799> I<00:01:23.040> say<00:01:23.250> that<00:01:23.280> is<00:01:23.580> it's<00:01:24.270> just<00:01:24.659> a

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
reason I say that is it's just a

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.920 
reason I say that is it's just a
different<00:01:26.070> blend<00:01:26.310> of<00:01:26.790> inclusions<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:27.630> I<00:01:27.750> just

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
different blend of inclusions and I just

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.530 
different blend of inclusions and I just
really<00:01:28.229> like<00:01:28.439> it<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:29.189> only<00:01:29.369> thing<00:01:29.460> is<00:01:29.880> is<00:01:30.240> it

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
really like it the only thing is is it

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.090 
really like it the only thing is is it
was<00:01:30.630> a<00:01:30.659> little<00:01:30.930> difficult<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.439> cut<00:01:31.799> with<00:01:32.070> a

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
was a little difficult to cut with a

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.370 
was a little difficult to cut with a
blade<00:01:32.189> so<00:01:33.030> you<00:01:33.119> have<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.329> consider<00:01:33.630> that<00:01:33.750> and

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
blade so you have to consider that and

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.510 
blade so you have to consider that and
you<00:01:34.590> know<00:01:34.710> it'll<00:01:34.920> just<00:01:34.979> take<00:01:35.220> you<00:01:35.369> a<00:01:35.400> little

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
you know it'll just take you a little

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.819 
you know it'll just take you a little
extra<00:01:35.820> time<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.840> again<00:01:37.140> this<00:01:37.290> is<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.560> surnicc

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
extra time and again this is the surnicc

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.020 
extra time and again this is the surnicc
brand<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:39.770> it's<00:01:40.770> I<00:01:40.979> really<00:01:41.400> like<00:01:41.549> this<00:01:41.729> clay

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
brand and it's I really like this clay

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.880 
brand and it's I really like this clay
I'm<00:01:42.299> having<00:01:42.930> fun<00:01:43.079> with<00:01:43.229> it<00:01:43.259> there's<00:01:43.560> a<00:01:43.619> lot<00:01:43.770> of

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
I'm having fun with it there's a lot of

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.920 
I'm having fun with it there's a lot of
different<00:01:44.159> colors<00:01:44.430> so<00:01:45.360> definitely<00:01:45.689> check<00:01:45.899> it

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
different colors so definitely check it

even come in copper you can find them on

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.050 
even come in copper you can find them on
eBay<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.360> some<00:01:57.630> of<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.780> online<00:01:58.350> stores<00:01:59.060> this

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
eBay and some of the online stores this

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.490 
eBay and some of the online stores this
one<00:02:00.270> here<00:02:00.659> I<00:02:00.810> used<00:02:01.680> one<00:02:02.070> a<00:02:02.899> studio<00:02:03.899> by<00:02:04.049> sculpey

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
one here I used one a studio by sculpey

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.520 
one here I used one a studio by sculpey
line<00:02:05.180> texture<00:02:06.180> sheets<00:02:06.659> I<00:02:06.960> think<00:02:07.170> they're

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
line texture sheets I think they're

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.699

called<00:02:07.710> texture<00:02:08.069> plates<00:02:09.289> and<00:02:10.289> that<00:02:10.470> I<00:02:10.530> just

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
called texture plates and that I just
