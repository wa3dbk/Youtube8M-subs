00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.720 
these little things that look just like
little<00:03:25.020> pointing<00:03:25.440> arrows<00:03:25.739> those<00:03:26.400> show<00:03:26.670> you

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
little pointing arrows those show you

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.550 
little pointing arrows those show you
where<00:03:27.030> obstacles<00:03:27.570> are<00:03:27.690> such<00:03:27.870> as<00:03:28.020> ramps<00:03:28.440> or

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
where obstacles are such as ramps or

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.550 
where obstacles are such as ramps or
rails<00:03:29.180> so<00:03:30.180> if<00:03:30.300> you<00:03:30.420> put<00:03:30.780> your<00:03:30.840> two<00:03:31.170> fingers<00:03:31.200> on

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
rails so if you put your two fingers on

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.050 
rails so if you put your two fingers on
this<00:03:31.950> end<00:03:32.160> your<00:03:32.310> board<00:03:32.520> will<00:03:32.670> obviously<00:03:32.880> go

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
this end your board will obviously go

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.880 
this end your board will obviously go
that<00:03:33.239> way<00:03:33.390> if<00:03:33.810> you<00:03:34.110> put<00:03:34.290> your<00:03:34.320> two<00:03:34.500> fingers<00:03:34.530> on

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
that way if you put your two fingers on

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.380 
that way if you put your two fingers on
this<00:03:35.070> end<00:03:35.280> your<00:03:35.580> board<00:03:35.790> Ravi<00:03:35.970> should<00:03:36.180> go<00:03:36.239> that

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
this end your board Ravi should go that

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.090 
this end your board Ravi should go that
way<00:03:36.540> and<00:03:36.690> through<00:03:37.260> the<00:03:37.440> most<00:03:37.650> simple<00:03:37.890> trick

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
way and through the most simple trick

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.290 
way and through the most simple trick
which<00:03:38.250> is<00:03:38.370> the<00:03:38.520> owl<00:03:38.640> you<00:03:38.850> put<00:03:39.030> two<00:03:39.270> fingers

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
which is the owl you put two fingers

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.850 
which is the owl you put two fingers
down<00:03:39.780> here<00:03:40.110> the<00:03:40.920> least<00:03:41.100> the<00:03:41.160> first<00:03:41.280> one<00:03:41.550> and

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860 
down here the least the first one and

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.350 
down here the least the first one and
then<00:03:43.860> release<00:03:44.340> the<00:03:44.489> second<00:03:44.670> one<00:03:44.760> so<00:03:44.850> watch<00:03:45.000> go

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
then release the second one so watch go

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.680 
then release the second one so watch go
there<00:03:46.040> and<00:03:47.040> you<00:03:47.190> do<00:03:47.310> a<00:03:47.340> simple<00:03:47.610> that's<00:03:48.510> not

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
there and you do a simple that's not

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:55.870 
there and you do a simple that's not
simple<00:03:48.959> alley<00:03:49.110> but<00:03:49.350> there<00:03:49.500> we<00:03:49.620> go<00:03:49.739> on
