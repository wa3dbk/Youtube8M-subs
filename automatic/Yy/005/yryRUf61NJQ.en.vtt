you up close the blue one in just a

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:23.660 
you up close the blue one in just a
moment<00:00:22.859> here<00:00:22.980> i'm<00:00:23.039> going<00:00:23.130> to<00:00:23.220> put<00:00:23.340> that<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:23.640> the

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
moment here i'm going to put that to the

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.210 
moment here i'm going to put that to the
side<00:00:23.789> i've<00:00:24.210> already<00:00:24.359> put<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.750> phone<00:00:24.990> in<00:00:25.199> it<00:00:25.380> it

side i've already put the phone in it it

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.189 
side i've already put the phone in it it
is<00:00:26.490> coming<00:00:26.820> in<00:00:26.939> two<00:00:27.119> parts<00:00:27.510> so<00:00:27.720> it<00:00:27.869> is<00:00:27.960> a<00:00:27.990> hybrid

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
is coming in two parts so it is a hybrid

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.080 
is coming in two parts so it is a hybrid
case<00:00:28.560> because<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.070> internal<00:00:29.670> part<00:00:29.880> is<00:00:30.060> a

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
case because the internal part is a

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.810 
case because the internal part is a
silicone<00:00:30.840> material<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:31.769> it's<00:00:31.980> all<00:00:32.130> black<00:00:32.579> on

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
silicone material and it's all black on

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.420 
silicone material and it's all black on
all<00:00:33.059> of<00:00:33.239> these<00:00:33.360> cases<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:34.410> external<00:00:35.010> piece<00:00:35.190> is

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
all of these cases the external piece is

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.370 
all of these cases the external piece is
a<00:00:35.460> polycarbonate<00:00:36.390> shell<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:37.050> that's<00:00:37.200> going

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
a polycarbonate shell and that's going

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.560 
a polycarbonate shell and that's going
to<00:00:37.440> be<00:00:37.590> kind<00:00:37.770> of<00:00:37.920> your<00:00:38.100> color<00:00:38.670> splash<00:00:39.149> on<00:00:39.420> these

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
to be kind of your color splash on these

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.420 
to be kind of your color splash on these
cases<00:00:40.079> so<00:00:40.200> we've<00:00:40.350> got<00:00:40.500> it<00:00:40.649> in<00:00:40.739> black<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.040> black

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
cases so we've got it in black and black

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.850 
cases so we've got it in black and black
as<00:00:41.700> you<00:00:41.820> see<00:00:42.030> right<00:00:42.059> here<00:00:42.660> it's<00:00:43.350> also<00:00:43.559> going<00:00:43.800> to

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
as you see right here it's also going to

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.260 
as you see right here it's also going to
come<00:00:44.070> in<00:00:44.340> yellow<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.300> black<00:00:46.460> white<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:47.700> black

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
come in yellow and black white and black

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.450 
come in yellow and black white and black
now<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.750> thing<00:00:49.110> about<00:00:49.140> these<00:00:49.500> lighter<00:00:49.829> cases

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
now the thing about these lighter cases

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.979 
now the thing about these lighter cases
when<00:00:50.700> we<00:00:50.820> deal<00:00:51.000> with<00:00:51.239> things<00:00:51.420> like<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.809> white

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
when we deal with things like the white

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.540 
when we deal with things like the white
ones<00:00:52.260> they<00:00:52.500> are<00:00:52.530> going<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.860> show<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.100> little<00:00:53.370> bit

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
ones they are going to show a little bit

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.400 
ones they are going to show a little bit
more<00:00:53.730> dirt<00:00:54.000> over<00:00:54.390> time<00:00:54.600> so<00:00:54.870> you<00:00:54.960> have<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.199> work

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
more dirt over time so you have to work

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.990 
more dirt over time so you have to work
a<00:00:55.530> little<00:00:55.559> bit<00:00:55.829> harder<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.160> keep<00:00:56.370> those<00:00:56.579> clean

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
a little bit harder to keep those clean

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.180 
a little bit harder to keep those clean
this<00:00:57.960> one's<00:00:58.289> kind<00:00:58.590> of<00:00:58.649> somewhere<00:00:59.010> in<00:00:59.100> between

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
this one's kind of somewhere in between

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.970 
this one's kind of somewhere in between
a<00:00:59.460> white<00:01:00.180> and<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.539> pink<00:01:00.840> it's<00:01:01.079> not<00:01:01.260> fully<00:01:01.559> white

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980

but it's also not fully pink so
somewhere<00:01:04.860> in<00:01:04.920> between<00:01:05.100> as<00:01:05.549> you<00:01:05.670> can<00:01:05.820> see<00:01:06.060> here

somewhere in between as you can see here

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.270 
somewhere in between as you can see here
a<00:01:06.360> hint<00:01:06.659> of<00:01:06.840> pink<00:01:07.080> to<00:01:07.350> it<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.680> then<00:01:08.100> this<00:01:08.220> one

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
a hint of pink to it and then this one

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.990 
a hint of pink to it and then this one
is<00:01:08.460> fuchsia<00:01:08.939> now<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.740> installation<00:01:11.610> of<00:01:11.760> this

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
is fuchsia now the installation of this

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.450 
is fuchsia now the installation of this
it's<00:01:12.750> not<00:01:12.900> overly<00:01:13.350> tricky<00:01:13.799> but<00:01:14.100> basically

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
it's not overly tricky but basically

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.530

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.620 
this and then you're going to work the
outer<00:01:19.650> shell<00:01:20.100> over<00:01:20.670> starting<00:01:21.390> with<00:01:21.540> the

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
outer shell over starting with the

outer shell over starting with the
buttons<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.290> then<00:01:22.380> you<00:01:22.740> do<00:01:22.920> have<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.189> use<00:01:23.369> kind

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
buttons and then you do have to use kind

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.390 
buttons and then you do have to use kind
of<00:01:23.670> a<00:01:23.729> nail<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.360> massage<00:01:25.170> this<00:01:25.470> into<00:01:25.710> place<00:01:26.130> now

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
of a nail to massage this into place now

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.340 
of a nail to massage this into place now
I've<00:01:26.549> done<00:01:26.729> this<00:01:26.909> off-camera<00:01:27.180> just<00:01:27.960> because

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
I've done this off-camera just because

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.530 
I've done this off-camera just because
with<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.070> camera<00:01:29.430> in<00:01:29.610> front<00:01:29.820> it's<00:01:30.150> very

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
with the camera in front it's very

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.240 
with the camera in front it's very
difficult<00:01:30.810> to<00:01:31.079> do<00:01:31.320> so<00:01:31.350> I<00:01:31.560> kind<00:01:31.829> of<00:01:31.890> did<00:01:32.040> it<00:01:32.070> off

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
difficult to do so I kind of did it off

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.640 
difficult to do so I kind of did it off
camera<00:01:32.549> but<00:01:32.970> it's<00:01:33.360> really<00:01:33.720> not<00:01:33.930> that<00:01:33.990> hard<00:01:34.200> to

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
camera but it's really not that hard to

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.740 
camera but it's really not that hard to
install<00:01:35.159> let's<00:01:35.790> take<00:01:36.000> a<00:01:36.030> look<00:01:36.299> at<00:01:36.420> this<00:01:36.509> up

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
install let's take a look at this up

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.109 
install let's take a look at this up
close<00:01:37.009> right<00:01:38.009> where<00:01:38.189> my<00:01:38.310> thumb<00:01:38.579> is<00:01:38.640> you<00:01:38.820> are

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
close right where my thumb is you are

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.090 
close right where my thumb is you are
going<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.479> get<00:01:39.630> a<00:01:39.840> level<00:01:40.290> of<00:01:40.530> lay<00:01:40.770> on<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.070> table

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
going to get a level of lay on the table

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.580 
going to get a level of lay on the table
design<00:01:41.759> with<00:01:41.970> this<00:01:42.150> one<00:01:42.390> which<00:01:43.079> is<00:01:43.229> also<00:01:43.380> going

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
design with this one which is also going

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.319 
design with this one which is also going
to<00:01:43.649> provide<00:01:44.009> screen<00:01:44.460> protection<00:01:44.880> in<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.240> form

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
to provide screen protection in the form

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.469 
to provide screen protection in the form
of<00:01:45.810> if<00:01:46.020> you<00:01:46.140> drop<00:01:46.439> it<00:01:46.619> like<00:01:46.770> that<00:01:47.159> your<00:01:48.149> case<00:01:48.420> is

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
of if you drop it like that your case is

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.960 
of if you drop it like that your case is
going<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:48.930> be<00:01:49.049> touching<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.829> flat<00:01:50.369> surface

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
going to be touching the flat surface

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.850 
going to be touching the flat surface
not<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.600> screen<00:01:51.960> so<00:01:52.229> it<00:01:52.290> gives<00:01:52.409> you<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.619> good

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
not the screen so it gives you a good

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.819 
not the screen so it gives you a good
level<00:01:53.369> of<00:01:53.640> protection<00:01:53.850> there<00:01:54.540> down<00:01:55.350> along<00:01:55.680> the

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
level of protection there down along the

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.069 
level of protection there down along the
bottom<00:01:56.040> we've<00:01:56.610> got<00:01:56.850> cutouts<00:01:57.270> for<00:01:57.420> everything

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
bottom we've got cutouts for everything

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.440 
bottom we've got cutouts for everything
that<00:01:58.259> needs<00:01:58.469> to<00:01:58.590> be<00:01:58.799> cut<00:01:59.040> out<00:01:59.070> it<00:01:59.399> aligns<00:01:59.790> just

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
that needs to be cut out it aligns just

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.870 
that needs to be cut out it aligns just
fine<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:01.049> then<00:02:01.619> you've<00:02:01.829> got<00:02:02.070> button<00:02:02.460> coverage

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
fine and then you've got button coverage

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.700 
fine and then you've got button coverage
along<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.420> side<00:02:03.659> and<00:02:03.960> these<00:02:04.170> should<00:02:04.200> be<00:02:04.409> very

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
along the side and these should be very

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.139 
along the side and these should be very
responsive<00:02:05.100> because<00:02:05.399> we're<00:02:05.700> talking<00:02:06.000> about

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
responsive because we're talking about

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.960 
responsive because we're talking about
silicon<00:02:06.869> here<00:02:07.200> up<00:02:08.069> along<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.520> top<00:02:08.729> we've<00:02:08.940> got

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
silicon here up along the top we've got

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.609 
silicon here up along the top we've got
cutouts<00:02:09.450> where<00:02:09.690> they<00:02:09.810> need<00:02:09.989> to<00:02:10.020> be<00:02:10.170> and<00:02:10.289> again

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
cutouts where they need to be and again

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.080 
cutouts where they need to be and again
everything<00:02:11.039> is<00:02:11.160> going<00:02:11.310> to<00:02:11.370> align<00:02:11.670> just<00:02:12.030> fine

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
everything is going to align just fine

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.580 
everything is going to align just fine
and<00:02:13.180> we've<00:02:13.330> got<00:02:13.510> button<00:02:13.870> coverage<00:02:14.230> on<00:02:14.410> this

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
and we've got button coverage on this

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.229 
and we've got button coverage on this
side<00:02:14.800> as<00:02:14.980> well<00:02:15.010> now<00:02:15.550> along<00:02:15.879> the<00:02:16.030> back<00:02:16.209> side

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
side as well now along the back side

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:19.050 
side as well now along the back side
we've<00:02:16.810> got<00:02:16.840> to<00:02:17.080> cut<00:02:17.260> out<00:02:17.379> down<00:02:17.650> below<00:02:17.890> you<00:02:18.879> can

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
we've got to cut out down below you can

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.509 
we've got to cut out down below you can
kind<00:02:19.209> of<00:02:19.330> see<00:02:19.510> this<00:02:19.720> almost<00:02:20.170> polka<00:02:20.560> dot<00:02:20.860> design

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:21.519 
kind of see this almost polka dot design

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:24.150 
kind of see this almost polka dot design
and<00:02:22.120> then<00:02:22.239> there<00:02:22.480> is<00:02:22.510> your<00:02:22.750> camera<00:02:23.080> cut<00:02:23.530> out<00:02:23.709> so

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
and then there is your camera cut out so

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.820 
and then there is your camera cut out so
it's<00:02:24.970> going<00:02:25.209> to<00:02:25.269> add<00:02:25.450> some<00:02:25.720> bulk<00:02:26.260> as<00:02:26.500> you<00:02:26.650> can

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
see here it's also going to add a little

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.960 
see here it's also going to add a little
bit<00:02:28.989> of<00:02:29.050> weight<00:02:29.349> but<00:02:29.620> it's<00:02:30.040> going<00:02:30.370> to<00:02:30.610> give<00:02:30.819> you

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
bit of weight but it's going to give you

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.690 
bit of weight but it's going to give you
a<00:02:31.000> great<00:02:31.540> level<00:02:31.840> of<00:02:32.110> protection<00:02:32.700> against

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
a great level of protection against

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.080 
a great level of protection against
