00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
been doing a lot of reading lot of

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.770 
been doing a lot of reading lot of
studying<00:01:13.420> on<00:01:13.540> their<00:01:13.870> horns<00:01:14.229> the<00:01:14.860> ram's<00:01:15.130> horns

studying on their horns the ram's horns
grow<00:01:16.780> about<00:01:17.290> from<00:01:17.799> inch<00:01:18.159> a<00:01:18.549> month<00:01:18.940> so<00:01:19.390> that

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
grow about from inch a month so that

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.029 
grow about from inch a month so that
would<00:01:19.719> be<00:01:19.840> about<00:01:20.020> right<00:01:20.079> his<00:01:20.560> horns<00:01:20.920> have

00:01:21.029 --> 00:01:21.039 
would be about right his horns have

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:23.100 
would be about right his horns have
curled<00:01:21.520> in<00:01:21.700> there<00:01:21.880> about<00:01:21.969> 10<00:01:22.750> inches<00:01:23.079> long

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
curled in there about 10 inches long

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.880 
curled in there about 10 inches long
probably<00:01:23.619> might<00:01:23.829> be<00:01:23.920> 12<00:01:25.350> but<00:01:26.350> anyway<00:01:26.710> they're

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
probably might be 12 but anyway they're

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.149 
probably might be 12 but anyway they're
getting<00:01:27.250> together<00:01:27.780> just<00:01:28.780> famously<00:01:29.439> I've<00:01:29.920> got

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.120 

hopefully<00:02:20.790> I'll<00:02:20.910> have<00:02:21.060> some<00:02:21.330> babies<00:02:22.130> this

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130

be<00:02:27.780> bred<00:02:28.310> and<00:02:29.310> I<00:02:30.000> could<00:02:30.750> start<00:02:30.960> raising<00:02:31.260> some

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
be bred and I could start raising some

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.560 
be bred and I could start raising some
more<00:02:31.950> used<00:02:32.900> but<00:02:33.900> we'll<00:02:34.140> leave<00:02:34.590> on<00:02:34.800> him<00:02:35.180> if<00:02:36.180> she

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
more used but we'll leave on him if she

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:41.590 
more used but we'll leave on him if she
is<00:02:36.750> bred<00:02:37.050> it<00:02:37.260> should<00:02:37.500> not<00:02:37.770> be<00:02:38.010> his<00:02:39.920> offspring

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
is bred it should not be his offspring

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.940 
is bred it should not be his offspring
because<00:02:42.600> the<00:02:43.020> big<00:02:43.200> Ram<00:02:43.410> that<00:02:43.620> was<00:02:43.740> in<00:02:43.860> the
