00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.990
 Good people, I'm being asked to teach. 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.480
 how it was to the stage of 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.599
 set these things down 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.759
 It's all with enough now you can 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.580
 follow on youtube channel of 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.690
 online trainer is with a trainer 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.090
 I think if I'm not mistaken, they're 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.150
 paulo that I take pio 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.310
 it's all what I have learned these by 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.980
 neighbors and thing and such in his channel is 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.939
 very good very didactic in much for 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.610
 beginners 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.190
 can do practically all those 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:39.480
 our desire that we have dwarf dog 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.579
 not only does not it bite the hand is do not 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.789
 the gate as a parcel is all there in the 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.379
 channel date is I think it would be very 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.860
 Unfair to post something with your 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.719
 authorship but in reality it's all 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.280
 His work and I'm just copying it. 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.930
 I'm showing here because of the 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.399
 stage to show how you are 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.570
 here I play something and such 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.410
 Do you know what that thing is? 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:05.060
 proud to speak for today are 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.110
 basically today I'm going to teach and then 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:09.090
 to show you is not easy because you 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.490
 You know it's going to be a little complicated. 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.729
 show some moment you but it is 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.340
 and most of the time 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:21.390
 tricks such as well 60 of shorty 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:24.720
 rolls are based on a cover of yours 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:28.110
 tidbit for the dog and you handle that 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.150
 disk and mobile keeping your hand to 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.070
 involving a movement that wants 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.250
 Do you understand that you're trying to keep looking 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.140
 With your mouth, the snack you will not give 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.360
 and when it arrives at the one in opposition 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:43.140
 in that movement told him to do 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.450
 you release to discover the great 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.790
 trump is on your goal with your hand 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.030
 it's in case here I'm using a 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.640
 overalls club is the stadium really likes 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.770
 and I held it in the palm of my hand so 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.860
 that 's what he presses with his big toe 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.810
 I do not let them get there, it's going to stay 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.610
 biting around here and not let him 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.120
 will take until the moment he is in the 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.300
 position 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:08.600
 I want it in the case of the center that will do 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.220
 If you 're going to give him a treat like that 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:14.100
 and you 're pushing back the 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.810
 trend he sit deal was the 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.710
 specific panel is thus pushing 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.870
 behind 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.840
 the tendency he would sit when he was 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.430
 on the floor of his authority and went to pick up 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.650
 in it the leg which is part of 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.480
 departure served to provide a dog 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.580
 that is so and I will not let see who 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.430
 It will stay or dial back and we will 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.560
 put apathy in your hand to try 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.090
 take your thumb off what you do 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.070
 when he puts the little picture in his 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.590
 memory number in the companies will hit 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:43.620
 here and there finally will try to take your 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:46.050
 the thumb of the disc when he does 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:50.190
 that you provide over time you will 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:52.320
 producing the branches commanded the San Jose 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.970
 the sits down hall 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.490
 let's see in practice then how 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.070
 works right, this is going to be 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:01.470
 complicated to teach because they already 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:03.480
 Do you know what it was you wanted to do to me? 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:08.340
 he knows I'm competing in the 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:11.370
 hand has already gone through a massive 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.650
 if that's the case he would be standing 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.690
 reginho so who wants to see hold the 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:23.820
 Snack with the party as well 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:24.780
 sits pushing home when at his 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:32.450
 greeting 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:34.860
 here you do not go wrong except pepper 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:39.930
 raised the front parts which is what 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:46.200
 I want you to do it for him 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:48.390
 do not sit down to the floor 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:52.380
 I never promised to play this wrong game. 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:54.540
 I'll shoot him when the 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:57.360
 Seeing it, I really want to see it. 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.430
 good, very good boy always praises year and 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.530
 this to him, right? 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.970
 ball like the ball would be and all that is 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.080
 here does not know will be easier to 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.610
 explain you isolate 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:10.230
 in doing so it lies and rolls by turning and 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:15.630
 giving rise to the team behind 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:20.609
 lie lie all right party 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:24.930
 centrist then sat tried to hold 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:28.980
 optical disc game behind here 3rd trend 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:30.810
 then yes, if you do not give 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:33.150
 they have been wrong this is how it works 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:36.330
 Do you keep nibbling until you do? 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:38.430
 right has to exist there must be the 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.110
 axa stadium sit and share some 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:51.900
 jokes with the ball I go 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:53.220
 show another video sit down and 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:56.520
 Gotta get the party can not 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:58.440
 happen is in the case of noodles killed 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.850
 using screw noodles and gives a 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.970
 had in him because he can not 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:04.590
 You can not catch it with your teeth. 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:07.290
 pulling forward will pulling for 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:09.240
 down to bed lying down benefices 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:12.570
 right disk 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:16.350
 the sharing how does the paw plus one 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:22.500
 request that he had to do and try to leave 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:24.450
 sit or very well you will meet 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.760
 for him at the breast height and go 

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:29.510
 Nadal secure hold when it should not 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:32.040
 continue on the next button you can 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:35.790
 miss the big toe and leave and get a 

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:38.630
 right cookie knot from the platinum 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:40.830
 Pratincha, can you give it to him? 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:44.010
 basically it's a mechanic you go 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:45.720
 supply the disk out there will ask you to 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.729
 he does something you have provided 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:50.760
 in the right positions I recommend 

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:52.740
 that you see the video of dodo but not 

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.660
 it's just that I said little that he 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:58.740
 have puppies that have not been taught to 

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:59.520
 wash the people away though he had and hence 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:01.530
 the dog 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.000
 to do that there when you do that 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:05.639
 What are you trying to do? 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.099
 Give him a cookie, will not you? 

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:08.970
 another example the length is in 

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:12.509
 default 

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:15.180
 Look here, you understand. I pushed it underneath. 

00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:18.449
 it were to rise well back 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:19.979
 if the dog also likes 

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:21.659
 toy you can also use 

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:23.610
 toy had that only gives a link between 

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:25.590
 time that does what it wants 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:27.810
 It's important the dog is interested. 

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:33.900
 to play with you and work with you 

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:37.380
 at that moment is the most expensive one 

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:39.840
 It's very secret so it 's patience is 

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:41.250
 they are stubborn transmission from 

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.990
 pretty stubborn 

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:45.210
 they are very inattentive then sometimes 

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:48.720
 You will be in the field of petism to 

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:50.969
 he and he may be wanting to look at the street 

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:54.479
 and not pick up a song or even want 

00:06:50.969 --> 00:06:55.949
 to play with you, so I never said 

00:06:54.479 --> 00:06:57.060
 that he likes a lot in the first half 

00:06:55.949 --> 00:07:02.490
 I think a lot 

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:03.719
 It's really worth it, but spend this 

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:06.240
 time with your field 

00:07:03.719 --> 00:07:08.550
 I understand, you will see that you will have 

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:10.409
 much less protests and this kind of 

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:12.180
 It's okay, folks. 

00:07:10.409 --> 00:07:13.650
 this is the first time I record 

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:15.979
 video of that kind, so I do not know if it 

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:20.360
 Good and apologize and anything. 

00:07:15.979 --> 00:07:20.360
 that I was already at the edge of town 

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:27.670
 the house
