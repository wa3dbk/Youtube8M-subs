00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:13.940 

got<00:00:06.360> a<00:00:06.390> new<00:00:06.600> idea<00:00:06.930> for<00:00:06.960> Peru<00:00:12.740> thinking<00:00:13.740> about

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
got a new idea for Peru thinking about

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.689 
got a new idea for Peru thinking about
is<00:00:14.160> taking<00:00:15.500> what<00:00:16.500> you<00:00:16.619> see<00:00:16.860> here<00:00:17.160> building<00:00:17.580> the

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
is taking what you see here building the

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.939 
is taking what you see here building the
skeleton<00:00:18.000> so<00:00:18.770> far<00:00:19.770> I<00:00:19.800> got<00:00:19.890> maybe<00:00:21.740> two<00:00:22.740> hours

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
skeleton so far I got maybe two hours

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.779 
skeleton so far I got maybe two hours
working<00:00:23.429> this<00:00:23.670> most<00:00:24.060> of<00:00:24.300> it<00:00:24.420> figuring<00:00:24.869> it<00:00:24.960> out

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:25.789 
working this most of it figuring it out

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.259 
working this most of it figuring it out
probably<00:00:26.789> do<00:00:26.880> this<00:00:27.029> in<00:00:27.089> a<00:00:27.330> lot<00:00:27.480> less<00:00:27.630> time

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:29.269 
probably do this in a lot less time

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:33.200 
probably do this in a lot less time
depending<00:00:30.269> on<00:00:31.579> you<00:00:32.579> know<00:00:32.669> now<00:00:32.820> that<00:00:32.850> I<00:00:33.030> got

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
depending on you know now that I got

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.840 
depending on you know now that I got
some<00:00:33.270> patterns<00:00:33.870> I<00:00:34.250> just<00:00:35.250> kind<00:00:35.430> of<00:00:35.460> took<00:00:35.640> one<00:00:35.820> of

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
some patterns I just kind of took one of

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:42.619 
some patterns I just kind of took one of
my<00:00:36.030> other<00:00:37.309> other<00:00:39.289> heroes<00:00:40.289> right<00:00:40.649> here<00:00:41.180> is<00:00:42.180> how

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
my other other heroes right here is how

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.660 
my other other heroes right here is how
it<00:00:42.780> worked<00:00:43.020> out<00:00:43.260> started<00:00:43.859> using<00:00:44.100> some<00:00:44.430> of<00:00:44.489> our

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
it worked out started using some of our

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:51.020 
it worked out started using some of our
measurements<00:00:46.160> to<00:00:47.809> get<00:00:48.809> an<00:00:48.930> idea<00:00:49.379> how<00:00:50.030> to

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
measurements to get an idea how to

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.619 
measurements to get an idea how to
better<00:00:52.579> be<00:00:53.579> able<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:53.850> want<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.180> have<00:00:54.390> right

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
better be able to want to have right

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.229 
better be able to want to have right
here<00:00:55.160> so<00:00:56.160> I<00:00:56.190> kind<00:00:56.489> of<00:00:56.579> already<00:00:56.910> know<00:00:58.579> the<00:00:59.579> beam

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
here so I kind of already know the beam

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:06.350 
here so I kind of already know the beam
and<00:01:01.670> the<00:01:03.230> limits<00:01:04.230> that<00:01:04.350> I<00:01:04.620> can<00:01:05.030> be<00:01:06.030> in<00:01:06.210> this

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
and the limits that I can be in this

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.610 
and the limits that I can be in this
plywood<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:07.320> this<00:01:07.710> is<00:01:08.630> OSB<00:01:09.660> right<00:01:10.260> here<00:01:10.440> by

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:10.620 
plywood and this is OSB right here by

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.900 
plywood and this is OSB right here by
the<00:01:10.680> way<00:01:11.450> it's<00:01:12.450> all<00:01:13.160> not<00:01:14.160> fit<00:01:14.430> for<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.700> water

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:14.910 
the way it's all not fit for the water

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:21.050 
the way it's all not fit for the water
without<00:01:15.360> being<00:01:16.970> painted<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:20.060> covered

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
without being painted and covered

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.500 
without being painted and covered
properly<00:01:21.330> so<00:01:21.930> it<00:01:22.320> is<00:01:22.710> just<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.420> just<00:01:24.420> the

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:24.510 
properly so it is just the just the

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.380 
properly so it is just the just the
bones<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:25.170> skeleton<00:01:25.710> now<00:01:26.640> it's<00:01:26.880> a<00:01:27.000> matter<00:01:27.180> of

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
bones the skeleton now it's a matter of

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:34.160 
bones the skeleton now it's a matter of
all<00:01:28.760> placing<00:01:30.530> the<00:01:32.090> panels<00:01:33.090> on<00:01:33.300> it<00:01:33.510> the<00:01:33.900> side

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
all placing the panels on it the side

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.780 
all placing the panels on it the side
panels<00:01:34.620> I<00:01:34.710> think<00:01:34.890> I'm<00:01:34.980> gonna<00:01:35.100> go<00:01:35.220> with<00:01:35.400> luan

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
panels I think I'm gonna go with luan

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:42.170 
panels I think I'm gonna go with luan
and<00:01:39.890> just<00:01:40.890> paint<00:01:41.220> it<00:01:41.340> heavily<00:01:41.670> depending<00:01:42.090> on

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
and just paint it heavily depending on

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.720 
and just paint it heavily depending on
how<00:01:42.270> sturdy<00:01:42.540> it<00:01:42.780> is<00:01:43.190> because<00:01:44.190> what<00:01:44.400> I'll<00:01:44.550> do

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:44.730 
how sturdy it is because what I'll do

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.690 
how sturdy it is because what I'll do
here<00:01:45.030> is<00:01:45.180> I'll<00:01:45.810> put<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.080> kill<00:01:46.380> on<00:01:46.680> it<00:01:46.890> and

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
here is I'll put a kill on it and

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.620 
here is I'll put a kill on it and
probably<00:01:48.090> put<00:01:48.240> a<00:01:49.580> attach<00:01:50.580> some<00:01:50.820> reinforcement

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
probably put a attach some reinforcement

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.110 
probably put a attach some reinforcement
to<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.650> bottom<00:01:53.070> of<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.310> plywood<00:01:53.550> and

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:54.120 
to the bottom of the plywood and

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.990 
to the bottom of the plywood and
sandwich<00:01:55.040> sandwich<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.310> plywood<00:01:56.670> between

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
sandwich sandwich the plywood between

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.570 
sandwich sandwich the plywood between
the<00:01:57.120> key<00:01:57.330> or<00:01:57.510> on<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.690> bottom<00:01:58.050> brace<00:01:58.410> maybe<00:01:59.400> do

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
the key or on the bottom brace maybe do

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.110 
the key or on the bottom brace maybe do
a<00:01:59.610> little<00:01:59.730> more<00:01:59.970> bracing<00:02:01.220> to<00:02:02.220> these<00:02:02.460> cross

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:03.120 
a little more bracing to these cross

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.670 
a little more bracing to these cross
members<00:02:04.490> from<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.760> keel<00:02:06.240> support<00:02:06.810> put

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
members from the keel support put

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.260 
members from the keel support put
something<00:02:07.980> in<00:02:08.099> the<00:02:08.190> floor<00:02:08.429> just<00:02:08.729> to<00:02:08.849> keep<00:02:09.060> it

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
something in the floor just to keep it

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.390 
something in the floor just to keep it
not<00:02:09.479> add<00:02:09.690> a<00:02:09.720> lot<00:02:09.869> of<00:02:10.020> weight<00:02:10.200> but<00:02:10.500> then<00:02:11.129> all<00:02:11.280> we

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
not add a lot of weight but then all we

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.220 
not add a lot of weight but then all we
got<00:02:11.550> to<00:02:11.610> do<00:02:11.700> is<00:02:11.790> put<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.060> skin<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.959> side

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
got to do is put the skin the side

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.069 
got to do is put the skin the side
panels<00:02:13.709> on<00:02:13.859> it<00:02:14.099> run<00:02:14.879> rub<00:02:15.180> rails<00:02:15.510> around<00:02:15.750> the

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:16.079 
panels on it run rub rails around the

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:17.309 
panels on it run rub rails around the
top

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
top

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:21.420 
top
oh<00:02:19.019> maybe<00:02:20.019> put<00:02:20.439> something<00:02:20.650> a<00:02:20.769> little<00:02:20.950> fancier

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
oh maybe put something a little fancier

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.259 
oh maybe put something a little fancier
here<00:02:21.640> after<00:02:21.939> I<00:02:21.969> sand<00:02:22.359> it<00:02:22.510> down<00:02:22.569> flatten<00:02:23.230> it<00:02:23.290> out

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
here after I sand it down flatten it out

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:27.360 
here after I sand it down flatten it out
but<00:02:25.269> otherwise<00:02:25.689> I<00:02:26.260> think<00:02:26.859> this<00:02:27.069> one's<00:02:27.280> going

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
but otherwise I think this one's going

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.339 
but otherwise I think this one's going
to<00:02:27.430> come<00:02:27.640> together<00:02:27.790> they<00:02:28.480> are<00:02:28.510> about<00:02:28.989> got<00:02:29.319> it

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:29.349 
to come together they are about got it

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:35.970 
to come together they are about got it
down<00:02:29.650> to<00:02:31.439> four<00:02:32.439> or<00:02:32.680> five<00:02:32.890> hour<00:02:33.129> process<00:02:34.980> that's

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
down to four or five hour process that's

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.189 
down to four or five hour process that's
it
