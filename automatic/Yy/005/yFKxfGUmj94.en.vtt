00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120
 Hello to you, I Vova and Tishinskiy 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.830
 while my aimak is being updated I decided 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:12.000
 share with you first impressions 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:15.680
 about the smartphone meizu m1 but now 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.820
 a day have passed since i took it and 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:22.230
 I want to say that he is big and massive 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:26.039
 slippery he is really slippery therefore 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:29.730
 immediately advise with this device if 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.650
 you are potential buyers 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.020
 this unit or want it 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.910
 to acquire to buy some case 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.870
 it must be done because 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:44.489
 he will have you slide off very and 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:46.379
 much further from those moments that to me 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.289
 liked well here in particular in this 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:52.230
 the device I like the color it is real 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:55.170
 cool color is very cool here plus ko 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.059
 everything looks well assembled too 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.989
 good quality no backlash 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:03.570
 no creaking is also available 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.640
 Pleases minimal speaker such here he 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:11.220
 modest little there will be dust 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:13.710
 there is no bulge here 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.140
 or goodies here are cameras that too 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.140
 a big plus, too, there is no mud 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.549
 baths will not take in general 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.290
 the fact that I really liked what 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.170
 just one speaker I would still 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.659
 I would like two speakers button on top 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:31.020
 is located but you can unlock 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:34.740
 just swipe up from here 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:37.680
 center buttons up to some one-off 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.619
 unlock or clamp off 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.960
 before or maybe because well yes 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.119
 because I'm just uncomfortable here and 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.479
 plus everything goes immediately blue wallpaper 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:51.360
 On and in general, in principle, everything is fine 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:54.780
 fotkaet shustrenko well because footage 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.420
 I'll show the shell as in meizu 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.759
 mx4 everything is as usual familiar 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.939
 nothing supernatural from this 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:05.200
 top curtain all right 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:09.459
 further what else do i carry 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:11.400
 everyone liked the SIM slot shorter 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:17.140
 this is a plastic thing that 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:19.599
 Well, in short, where the hole is he so 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.900
 a little dangles when she gets her 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:25.360
 and you need to shorter here and and 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.599
 specifically I donâ€™t know how to 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.920
 this is pure as this unit was 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:31.630
 moment but it seems to me that it is in all 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.250
 smartphones that is, there will need to be 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.730
 just a little bit like that moment 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:40.540
 there is but you will not be constantly sim cards 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:43.209
 get out and put them in there put it in 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.730
 the more there is no memory card so 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:47.560
 also they will not need to be changed 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:51.819
 installed two sims and use 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:54.880
 apparatus for autonomy now believe for 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:58.329
 a few hours now I even look 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:01.959
 how much time is it on battery 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:05.670
 and he two hours from battery than what they 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:09.700
 even two hours at the tree stick two hours 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:12.400
 display was on and 80 percent 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.350
 battery time remaining 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.959
 I did not understand the use if 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:18.310
 honest but oh yeah too two hours all the time 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:21.310
 was included in principle yes I am 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:24.700
 installed games that is from zero and 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:27.190
 Now I installed the bridge of the guy I became 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:30.250
 modern combat i installed blitz i will become 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:34.120
 fifu champions i'da gin hunt again all 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:36.760
 This, too, I will test and see where 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.760
 then 2 3 maybe four games I'll post 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.470
 on the channel show how the games go on this 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.750
 machine 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.160
 Well, in general, then your money 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.069
 first impressions he really 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:53.410
 Of course I would have looked more closely 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:54.010
 maple to 50 to 30 is also potential 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.370
 competitor 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:59.440
 on in principle by competitiveness 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.269
 have as it pulls up 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.170
 j3 competitiveness 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:05.420
 but he falls short of not 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:08.239
 it will cover cheaper but I would certainly all 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:10.910
 the same jay lawyer would have finished the corps 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:14.270
 a little bit and the screen is still matrices 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:16.549
 the display would put another here better 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:19.340
 imagine here better here 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:22.930
 principle all friends write your questions 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:25.970

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.810
 review there are some moments some 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.360
 features 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:31.550
 I'll tell you about autonomy about cameras 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.530
 I will say about the sound I will say about the game in general 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:36.830
