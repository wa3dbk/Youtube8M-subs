so<00:00:00.539> with<00:00:00.690> all<00:00:00.780> this<00:00:00.930> great<00:00:01.140> new<00:00:01.319> technology

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:01.979 
so with all this great new technology

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:03.830 
so with all this great new technology
like<00:00:02.159> green<00:00:02.460> roofs<00:00:02.730> and<00:00:03.000> green<00:00:03.179> walls<00:00:03.480> and

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
like green roofs and green walls and

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.930 
like green roofs and green walls and
urban<00:00:04.110> meadows<00:00:04.440> we<00:00:05.040> all<00:00:05.160> know<00:00:05.370> that<00:00:05.640> they<00:00:05.759> have

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
urban meadows we all know that they have

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.760 
urban meadows we all know that they have
great<00:00:06.270> environmental<00:00:06.930> benefits<00:00:07.410> but<00:00:07.620> they

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
great environmental benefits but they

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.140 
great environmental benefits but they
don't<00:00:07.980> seem<00:00:08.130> to<00:00:08.189> be<00:00:08.340> getting<00:00:08.490> enough<00:00:08.880> traction

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
don't seem to be getting enough traction

now<00:00:11.849> why<00:00:12.030> is<00:00:12.090> that<00:00:12.240> is<00:00:12.630> a<00:00:12.660> public<00:00:13.049> perception

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
now why is that is a public perception

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.860 
now why is that is a public perception
public<00:00:14.130> complacency<00:00:14.849> or<00:00:15.000> simply<00:00:15.570> a<00:00:15.599> lack<00:00:15.809> of
