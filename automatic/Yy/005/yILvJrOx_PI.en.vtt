we've<00:00:00.960> raised<00:00:01.290> the<00:00:01.500> vehicle<00:00:01.890> up<00:00:02.010> on<00:00:02.190> a<00:00:02.220> lift

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
we've raised the vehicle up on a lift

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.220 
we've raised the vehicle up on a lift
but<00:00:02.850> you<00:00:03.030> could<00:00:03.149> do<00:00:03.240> the<00:00:03.419> same<00:00:03.659> thing<00:00:03.990> by

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
but you could do the same thing by

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.980 
but you could do the same thing by
jacket<00:00:04.799> and<00:00:04.920> vehicle<00:00:05.250> up<00:00:05.400> with<00:00:06.390> a<00:00:06.420> floor<00:00:06.720> jack

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
jacket and vehicle up with a floor jack

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.169 
jacket and vehicle up with a floor jack
but<00:00:07.620> I<00:00:07.649> always<00:00:08.160> remember<00:00:08.580> that<00:00:08.610> you<00:00:09.090> know

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
but I always remember that you know

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.120 
but I always remember that you know
safety<00:00:09.570> first<00:00:09.599> so<00:00:10.200> make<00:00:10.650> sure<00:00:10.679> that<00:00:10.860> you

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
safety first so make sure that you

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.150 
safety first so make sure that you
support<00:00:11.610> the<00:00:11.759> vehicle<00:00:12.320> with<00:00:13.320> jack<00:00:13.590> stands<00:00:13.889> so

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
support the vehicle with jack stands so

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.460 
support the vehicle with jack stands so
that<00:00:14.490> you<00:00:14.730> can<00:00:15.210> reduce<00:00:15.509> the<00:00:15.750> possibility<00:00:15.960> of

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
that you can reduce the possibility of

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.820 
that you can reduce the possibility of
being<00:00:16.920> injured<00:00:17.490> or<00:00:17.970> killed<00:00:18.000> by<00:00:18.779> a<00:00:19.140> vehicle

role rod thing so we were able to lift

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.020 
role rod thing so we were able to lift
up<00:00:31.040> the<00:00:33.590> drain<00:00:34.590> so<00:00:35.130> that<00:00:35.430> we<00:00:35.610> can<00:00:35.790> get<00:00:35.940> it

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
up the drain so that we can get it

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.020 
up the drain so that we can get it
closer<00:00:36.270> to<00:00:36.719> where<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.530> drain<00:00:37.890> plug<00:00:38.129> is<00:00:38.460> and

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
closer to where the drain plug is and

spend<00:02:38.860> the<00:02:39.100> filter<00:02:39.459> on<00:02:39.640> until<00:02:40.090> it<00:02:40.239> touches<00:02:40.390> and

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
spend the filter on until it touches and

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.660 
spend the filter on until it touches and
then<00:02:41.319> turn<00:02:41.590> it<00:02:41.620> and<00:02:41.890> an<00:02:42.069> additional<00:02:42.459> three

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
then turn it and an additional three

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.320 
then turn it and an additional three
quarters<00:02:43.030> of<00:02:43.060> a<00:02:43.239> turn<00:02:43.480> so<00:02:44.230> what<00:02:44.260> we'll<00:02:44.470> do<00:02:45.330> so

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
quarters of a turn so what we'll do so

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:51.289 
quarters of a turn so what we'll do so
I'll<00:02:46.390> take<00:02:46.510> a<00:02:46.569> little<00:02:46.870> bit<00:02:47.019> of<00:02:47.080> new<00:02:47.620> motor<00:02:48.370> oil

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:54.810 

pour<00:02:52.299> that<00:02:52.480> on<00:02:52.510> there<00:02:53.220> and<00:02:54.220> take<00:02:54.459> a<00:02:54.489> little<00:02:54.700> of

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
pour that on there and take a little of

00:02:54.820 --> 00:03:00.650 
pour that on there and take a little of
that<00:02:54.880> and<00:02:55.299> actually<00:02:56.940> lubricate<00:02:57.940> the<00:02:58.120> gasket

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
that and actually lubricate the gasket

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:06.870 
that and actually lubricate the gasket
it's<00:03:01.660> important<00:03:02.170> to<00:03:04.530> tighten<00:03:05.530> the<00:03:06.130> filter

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
it's important to tighten the filter

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.800 
it's important to tighten the filter
just<00:03:07.450> the<00:03:07.630> right<00:03:07.840> amount<00:03:09.329> in<00:03:10.329> this<00:03:10.390> case<00:03:10.600> I've

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
just the right amount in this case I've

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.630 
just the right amount in this case I've
just<00:03:10.930> made<00:03:11.049> contact<00:03:12.090> now<00:03:13.090> I'll<00:03:13.480> turn<00:03:13.750> that<00:03:14.109> and

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
just made contact now I'll turn that and

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.449 
just made contact now I'll turn that and
additional<00:03:15.640> three<00:03:16.299> quarters<00:03:16.600> of<00:03:16.630> a<00:03:16.780> turn<00:03:16.989> and

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
additional three quarters of a turn and

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.710 
additional three quarters of a turn and
that<00:03:18.459> should<00:03:18.640> be<00:03:18.670> good<00:03:18.910> if<00:03:19.120> we<00:03:19.209> were<00:03:19.329> to<00:03:19.450> over

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
that should be good if we were to over

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.030 
that should be good if we were to over
tighten<00:03:19.930> that<00:03:20.140> it<00:03:20.319> could<00:03:20.440> actually<00:03:20.500> squeeze

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
tighten that it could actually squeeze

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.610 
tighten that it could actually squeeze
out<00:03:21.250> all<00:03:21.280> the<00:03:21.609> oil<00:03:21.810> and<00:03:22.810> either<00:03:22.959> cause<00:03:23.260> a<00:03:23.290> leak

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
out all the oil and either cause a leak

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.949 
out all the oil and either cause a leak
or<00:03:23.950> make<00:03:24.459> it<00:03:24.609> very<00:03:24.790> difficult<00:03:25.060> to<00:03:25.450> change<00:03:25.720> the

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
or make it very difficult to change the

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:29.099 
or make it very difficult to change the
next<00:03:26.200> time<00:03:26.700> we've<00:03:27.700> lowered<00:03:28.180> the<00:03:28.450> vehicle<00:03:28.900> back

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:29.109 
next time we've lowered the vehicle back

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:32.129 
next time we've lowered the vehicle back
down<00:03:29.410> to<00:03:29.590> the<00:03:29.620> ground<00:03:29.819> remove<00:03:30.819> the<00:03:31.090> oil<00:03:31.540> filler

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:32.139 
down to the ground remove the oil filler

down to the ground remove the oil filler
and<00:03:32.260> install<00:03:32.889> the<00:03:33.069> funnel<00:03:33.459> and<00:03:33.670> then<00:03:34.510> what<00:03:34.660> we

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
and install the funnel and then what we

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.870 
and install the funnel and then what we
need<00:03:34.930> to<00:03:35.019> do<00:03:35.200> is<00:03:35.470> to<00:03:35.889> refill<00:03:36.370> the<00:03:36.549> crankcase

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
need to do is to refill the crankcase

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.009 
need to do is to refill the crankcase
with<00:03:37.840> the<00:03:38.799> proper<00:03:39.190> quantity<00:03:39.459> and<00:03:40.000> grade<00:03:40.780> of

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
motor oil for the vehicle in question so

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.020 
motor oil for the vehicle in question so
in<00:03:44.380> this<00:03:44.470> case<00:03:44.680> I'm<00:03:45.190> going<00:03:45.280> to<00:03:45.430> start<00:03:45.790> filling

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
in this case I'm going to start filling

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.599 
in this case I'm going to start filling
the<00:03:46.150> oil<00:03:46.739> when<00:03:47.739> you're<00:03:47.829> doing<00:03:48.040> an<00:03:48.130> oil<00:03:48.220> change

the oil when you're doing an oil change

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:51.030 
the oil when you're doing an oil change
it's<00:03:49.329> also<00:03:49.510> a<00:03:49.660> great<00:03:49.840> idea<00:03:50.260> to<00:03:50.319> check<00:03:50.739> all

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
it's also a great idea to check all

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.500 
it's also a great idea to check all
other<00:03:51.489> fluids<00:03:52.030> in<00:03:52.150> the<00:03:52.239> car<00:03:52.479> to<00:03:53.489> fluid<00:03:54.489> levels

other fluids in the car to fluid levels
tire<00:03:56.049> pressure<00:03:58.140> why<00:03:59.140> you're<00:03:59.379> doing<00:03:59.500> all<00:03:59.769> that

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
tire pressure why you're doing all that

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.399 
tire pressure why you're doing all that
and<00:04:00.220> also<00:04:00.390> do<00:04:01.390> things<00:04:01.569> like<00:04:01.780> lubricate<00:04:02.260> the

00:04:02.399 --> 00:04:02.409 
and also do things like lubricate the

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:04.619 
and also do things like lubricate the

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
the funnel drain just a little bit

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.110 
the funnel drain just a little bit
remove<00:04:16.539> that<00:04:16.720> and<00:04:17.850> don't<00:04:18.850> forget<00:04:18.940> to

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
remove that and don't forget to

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.240 
remove that and don't forget to
reinstall<00:04:19.810> the<00:04:20.079> oil<00:04:20.260> filler<00:04:20.560> cap<00:04:20.650> it<00:04:21.039> can<00:04:21.160> make

reinstall the oil filler cap it can make

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:22.800 
reinstall the oil filler cap it can make
quite<00:04:21.459> a<00:04:21.519> mess<00:04:21.609> if<00:04:21.970> you<00:04:22.090> forget<00:04:22.360> to<00:04:22.479> put<00:04:22.510> that
