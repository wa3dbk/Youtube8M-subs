absolutely<00:02:06.299> true<00:02:06.979> you<00:02:07.979> score<00:02:08.190> more<00:02:08.340> points<00:02:08.399> if

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
absolutely true you score more points if

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.140 
absolutely true you score more points if
you're<00:02:09.479> born<00:02:09.780> earlier<00:02:10.289> in<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.860> year<00:02:10.890> we<00:02:11.489> could

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
you're born earlier in the year we could

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.610 
you're born earlier in the year we could
also<00:02:12.300> see<00:02:12.480> information<00:02:12.870> by<00:02:13.349> other

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
variables like the birthplace and you

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.199 
variables like the birthplace and you
can<00:02:18.510> see<00:02:18.780> here<00:02:19.709> that<00:02:19.739> it's<00:02:20.610> actually<00:02:20.819> people
