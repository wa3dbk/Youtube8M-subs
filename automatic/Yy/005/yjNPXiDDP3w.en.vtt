00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
my rod my curtain rod and I actually

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.750 
my rod my curtain rod and I actually
when<00:02:35.850> I<00:02:35.880> saw<00:02:36.210> sticking<00:02:36.600> all<00:02:36.930> me<00:02:37.080> in<00:02:37.140> there<00:02:37.320> I

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
when I saw sticking all me in there I

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.630 
when I saw sticking all me in there I
managed<00:02:38.760> to<00:02:38.820> feel<00:02:39.209> like<00:02:39.989> a<00:02:40.020> plastic<00:02:40.640> guy

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
managed to feel like a plastic guy

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.610 
managed to feel like a plastic guy
impact<00:02:41.940> at<00:02:42.090> the<00:02:42.180> bottom<00:02:42.540> and<00:02:43.110> I<00:02:43.230> think<00:02:43.440> that's

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
impact at the bottom and I think that's

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:44.990 
impact at the bottom and I think that's
the<00:02:43.800> part<00:02:43.950> is<00:02:44.130> getting<00:02:44.400> blocked<00:02:44.580> with<00:02:44.820> all

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
the part is getting blocked with all

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.760 
the part is getting blocked with all
these<00:02:45.090> leaves<00:02:45.300> so<00:02:45.989> what<00:02:46.290> actually<00:02:46.560> opens<00:02:46.739> the

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
these leaves so what actually opens the

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.600 
these leaves so what actually opens the
water<00:02:47.010> runs<00:02:47.310> in<00:02:47.610> it<00:02:48.480> runs<00:02:48.660> into<00:02:48.900> the<00:02:49.020> car<00:02:49.610> from

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
water runs in it runs into the car from

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.090 
water runs in it runs into the car from
the<00:02:50.730> rain<00:02:50.910> or<00:02:51.660> any<00:02:52.080> kind<00:02:52.320> of<00:02:52.380> water<00:02:52.620> and<00:02:52.890> runs

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
the rain or any kind of water and runs

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.600 
the rain or any kind of water and runs
in<00:02:53.340> and<00:02:53.550> then<00:02:53.910> what<00:02:54.390> happens<00:02:54.780> that<00:02:55.070> holiday<00:02:56.070> is

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
in and then what happens that holiday is

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.320 
in and then what happens that holiday is
blocked<00:02:57.000> up<00:02:57.150> and<00:02:58.340> yeah<00:02:59.340> that<00:02:59.550> holidays<00:02:59.880> gets

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
blocked up and yeah that holidays gets

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.080 
blocked up and yeah that holidays gets
blocked<00:03:00.570> up<00:03:00.780> so<00:03:00.989> the<00:03:01.080> water<00:03:01.260> rises<00:03:01.890> and<00:03:02.090> it

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
blocked up so the water rises and it

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.570 
blocked up so the water rises and it
rises<00:03:03.780> into<00:03:03.930> this<00:03:04.140> Avenger<00:03:04.830> and<00:03:05.040> they<00:03:05.310> trans

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
rises into this Avenger and they trans

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.699 
rises into this Avenger and they trans
into<00:03:05.850> the<00:03:05.940> car<00:03:06.180> so<00:03:06.750> that's<00:03:06.900> our<00:03:07.050> problem<00:03:07.230> so<00:03:07.590> I

into the car so that's our problem so I

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.120 
into the car so that's our problem so I
kinda<00:03:08.070> was<00:03:08.700> able<00:03:09.090> to<00:03:09.120> unplug<00:03:09.989> the<00:03:10.200> whole<00:03:10.920> day

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130

another<00:03:58.450> idea<00:03:58.569> that<00:03:58.780> I<00:03:58.930> got<00:03:59.440> to<00:04:00.190> because<00:04:00.489> you

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:00.550 
another idea that I got to because you

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:01.830 
another idea that I got to because you
can't<00:04:00.730> really<00:04:00.879> get<00:04:01.060> your<00:04:01.209> hands<00:04:01.390> in<00:04:01.569> it<00:04:01.690> so

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.630 
can't really get your hands in it so
what<00:04:01.959> you<00:04:02.080> do<00:04:02.200> just<00:04:02.680> take<00:04:02.890> this<00:04:03.040> this<00:04:03.400> rather

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.640 
what you do just take this this rather

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.220 
what you do just take this this rather
