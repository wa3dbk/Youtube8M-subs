to pull the bow back that's too much

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.859

form<00:01:31.860> too<00:01:32.130> much<00:01:32.340> poundage<00:01:32.909> so<00:01:33.509> when<00:01:33.689> they<00:01:33.810> do

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
form too much poundage so when they do

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.039 
form too much poundage so when they do
that<00:01:34.579> they'll<00:01:35.579> still<00:01:35.909> be<00:01:36.570> in<00:01:36.630> their<00:01:36.840> t

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
that they'll still be in their t

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.140 
that they'll still be in their t
position<00:01:37.619> they'll<00:01:37.799> start<00:01:38.100> out<00:01:38.280> this<00:01:38.520> way<00:01:38.790> and

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
position they'll start out this way and

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.950 
position they'll start out this way and
then<00:01:40.079> because<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.560> bow<00:01:40.740> is<00:01:40.920> too<00:01:41.100> heavy<00:01:41.340> form
