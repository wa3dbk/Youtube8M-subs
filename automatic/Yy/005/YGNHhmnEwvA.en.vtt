00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 welcome dear friends in this video 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.910
 I will tell about such remarkable utility 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.560
 as a loop the nir sockliner is a utility for 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.420
 cleaning the system from a variety of garbage 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.070
 that is, deletes cookies history 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.870
 site visits delete temporary 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.030
 of files 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.770
 the first and most important 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.449
 the function of this utility is cleaning 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.670
 system registry and troubleshooting 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.570
 i.e 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.119
 optimizes performance 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.070
 computer's second most important is 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.550
 remove unnecessary from startup 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.740
 of programs 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.199
 that is, when you start the computer I'm sure 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.380
 what takes you a long time it takes like 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.870
 at least there 45 minutes by my standards it 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.790
 a lot because i personally example because 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.640
 what loads right away I start 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.200
 to work respecting sure it is installed 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.420
 a lot of things and you just simply 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.520
 wait though you could come in and immediately 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.079
 programs in this will help you and the third 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.020
 what does the program do? 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.399
 eliminating all sorts of different unnecessary 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.800
 files left by programs 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.600
 which you delete or do not delete everything 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.940
 but do not leave a trace and the program that 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.670
 doing this prolonging work 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.140
 computer or even reanimates 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.850
 With the installation of the program, I do not see any 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.530
 problems and difficulties therefore install 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.510
 it quickly weighs about four 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.970
 meters and it starts up very quickly and 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.979
 set to the first tab cleaning 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.280
 we see two linings that is it 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.409
 windows and application in 1 lining i 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.259
 I see an internet explorer and spend in 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:25.200
 In general, all that that puts the right silence 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.640
 on what ticks put the program here 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.579
 and do not touch anything go to the second 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.200
 here i see browsers ie in these 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.549
 browsers leave everything as it is but 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.470
 pay attention to 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.210
 saved passwords because in 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.820
 different versions of the partings program 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.680
 likes to put a tick here and so 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.240
 most by choosing this option all 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.020
 saved passwords browsers will be 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.320
 lost so look carefully and 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:51.720
 remove the check marks here 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.369
 will clean this program the same skype 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.189
 cleaned of any unnecessary time 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:59.189
 mihailov and so on see how it is 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.750
 works that is, we press the analysis and here 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.719
 what I have found since i use 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.479
 It took me a lot of time regularly. 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:09.100
 quickly and click cleaning press ok and 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.650
 here it is a little load 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:14.890
 all i numbers that is bring a look 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.510
 one more time here cleaning and as you see here 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.790
 will be but nothing is found 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.610
 everything is fine with the programs go 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.740
 the second tab is the registry most important 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.420
 then for what fall is the program then here I am 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:28.270
 leave by default because 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.790
 the program knows better and click search 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:33.850
 problems when looking for problems 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:36.070
 the program is looking for all the problems 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.560
 Well, I repeat that I use 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:41.910
 the program regularly find me 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:45.370
 just one problem i click fix 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.830
 when such a window appears, then all stored 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.840
 backups or not what is 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.390
 backup copy i.e. 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.070
 each application is what its 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.020
 connects with computer that is if you 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:59.170
 Something will be removed 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:01.750
 problem catastrophe disaster 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.780
 that is, I advise you to save but personally I 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.640
 I'm not worried about it and not saving the house 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.460
 it warms my soul 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.260
 and after rebooting the computer you 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:15.370
 notice how windows really is 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:17.850
 will be much more smoothly somehow 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.860
 work go to the third tab 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:23.620
 service here immediately click 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:27.070
 autoload and as you see here we are 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:29.470
 find programs that are visible and not 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:31.270
 visible but not all will be shown here 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.090
 same pita switcher here it will be shown 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:35.470
 that he is in autoload 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:39.220
 what can I remove here that is let's say 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:41.140
 not here all that realtek let's say there 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.300
 dresser this is my antivirus and firewall 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.100
 I need everything here so I don’t do anything 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.680
 deleted let's say if you want something 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:52.510
 delete just click delete 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:53.860
 are yes no don't choose ok let you down 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.020
 the program weighs very little 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.420
 runs fast and cleans the computer 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:00.460
 optimizing the system I advise her 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.740
 use about once a week and you don't 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:04.420
 will notice any problems with your windows 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.700
 that is, no errors will cause 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:09.760
 reboots that open 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.870
 suddenly no problem and just that you 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.120
 there is something swinging 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.090
 Internet or play the program 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.680
 absolutely free and does not require any 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.040
 difficulties and so it is extra 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.870
 shopping 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.120
 let's say i use this program on 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.950
 throughout half a year and actually mine 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.060
 Windows lives already half a year I did not change 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.670
 windows as soon as i found out 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.350
 the program I immediately set myself and here 

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:32.150
 for sometime sometimes forget but 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:33.830
 I still use it regular and 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:36.380
 windows I have no problems 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.330
 no errors of their lags all runs 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.040
 quickly, I follow everything, that is, no 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.890
 additional in autoload me nothing 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.810
 not worth it and nothing bothers me as well 

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:46.010
 because a little tip after that 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.140
 reinstall windows 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:50.680
 be sure to install this first 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:53.780
 program and clean the registry because 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:56.240
 you will find a very, very, very sea of ​​mistakes 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:59.530
 with you was over bronson subscribe and 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.530
 put the husks bye
