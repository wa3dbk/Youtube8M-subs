00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
different things for example I've had

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:58.930 
different things for example I've had
athletes<00:03:57.890> before<00:03:58.010> who<00:03:58.310> are<00:03:58.400> like<00:03:58.550> man<00:03:58.760> I

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
athletes before who are like man I

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.270 
athletes before who are like man I
weighed<00:03:59.390> in<00:03:59.600> and<00:03:59.780> I'm<00:04:00.440> up<00:04:00.590> to<00:04:00.770> pounds<00:04:00.950> and

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
weighed in and I'm up to pounds and

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.920 
weighed in and I'm up to pounds and
they're<00:04:01.850> so<00:04:01.970> used<00:04:02.150> to<00:04:02.270> losing<00:04:02.390> a<00:04:02.630> pound<00:04:02.750> and<00:04:02.870> a

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
they're so used to losing a pound and a

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.900 
they're so used to losing a pound and a
half<00:04:02.959> to<00:04:03.200> pounds<00:04:03.470> per<00:04:03.530> week<00:04:03.650> or<00:04:03.980> somewhere<00:04:04.850> in

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
half to pounds per week or somewhere in

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:06.370 
half to pounds per week or somewhere in
that<00:04:04.940> ballpark<00:04:05.030> let's<00:04:05.540> say<00:04:05.720> just<00:04:05.900> as<00:04:06.260> an

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
that ballpark let's say just as an

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.080 
that ballpark let's say just as an
example<00:04:06.470> they're<00:04:06.980> like<00:04:07.100> man<00:04:07.280> I<00:04:07.610> have<00:04:07.880> a<00:04:07.910> lost

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
example they're like man I have a lost

weight this week they're going to be so

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:10.720 
weight this week they're going to be so
many<00:04:09.290> different<00:04:09.470> things<00:04:09.680> one<00:04:10.280> their<00:04:10.580> body
