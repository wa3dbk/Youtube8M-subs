when<00:00:00.210> we<00:00:00.329> think<00:00:00.450> of<00:00:00.630> the<00:00:00.719> hallmarks<00:00:01.170> of<00:00:01.260> aging

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:01.650 
when we think of the hallmarks of aging

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.269 
when we think of the hallmarks of aging
people<00:00:02.159> think<00:00:02.520> of<00:00:02.669> gray<00:00:02.879> hair<00:00:03.149> wrinkled<00:00:03.600> skin

00:00:04.269 --> 00:00:04.279 
people think of gray hair wrinkled skin

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:07.280 
people think of gray hair wrinkled skin
poor<00:00:05.279> bone<00:00:05.549> health<00:00:05.810> they<00:00:06.810> think<00:00:07.020> about<00:00:07.259> a

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
poor bone health they think about a

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:08.890 
poor bone health they think about a
failing<00:00:07.620> cardiovascular<00:00:08.460> system

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:08.900 
failing cardiovascular system

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.150 
failing cardiovascular system
Alzheimer's<00:00:09.900> disease<00:00:10.230> but<00:00:10.860> when<00:00:11.040> the

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
Alzheimer's disease but when the

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.100 
Alzheimer's disease but when the
earliest<00:00:11.610> hallmarks<00:00:12.059> of<00:00:12.120> aging<00:00:12.540> is<00:00:12.660> a<00:00:12.690> loss<00:00:12.929> of

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
earliest hallmarks of aging is a loss of

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.560 
earliest hallmarks of aging is a loss of
skeletal<00:00:13.440> muscle<00:00:13.469> so<00:00:14.309> unfortunately<00:00:15.000> we

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
skeletal muscle so unfortunately we

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.810 
skeletal muscle so unfortunately we
achieve<00:00:15.870> peak<00:00:16.170> muscle<00:00:16.529> mass<00:00:16.710> by<00:00:17.340> our<00:00:17.490> early

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
achieve peak muscle mass by our early

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.820 
achieve peak muscle mass by our early
40s<00:00:18.270> and<00:00:18.510> after<00:00:19.170> that<00:00:19.320> point<00:00:19.500> we<00:00:19.650> have<00:00:19.800> a

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
40s and after that point we have a

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.099 
40s and after that point we have a
progressive<00:00:20.039> deterioration<00:00:20.490> and<00:00:21.270> some<00:00:21.960> that

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
progressive deterioration and some that

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.650 
progressive deterioration and some that
might<00:00:22.260> equal<00:00:22.529> up<00:00:22.619> to<00:00:22.650> 50<00:00:23.070> percent<00:00:23.460> by<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.359> time

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
might equal up to 50 percent by the time

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.259 
might equal up to 50 percent by the time
they<00:00:24.810> reached<00:00:24.990> their<00:00:25.260> 80s<00:00:25.500> or<00:00:25.650> 90s<00:00:25.910> so<00:00:26.910> most<00:00:27.150> of

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
they reached their 80s or 90s so most of

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.000 
they reached their 80s or 90s so most of
us<00:00:27.390> will<00:00:27.570> lose<00:00:27.689> about<00:00:27.869> 30%<00:00:28.170> of<00:00:28.650> our<00:00:28.710> muscle

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
us will lose about 30% of our muscle

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.710 
us will lose about 30% of our muscle
mass<00:00:29.039> over<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.550> course<00:00:29.730> of<00:00:29.849> our<00:00:30.000> lifetime<00:00:30.179> and

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
mass over the course of our lifetime and

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.560 
mass over the course of our lifetime and
that's<00:00:31.320> really<00:00:31.590> a<00:00:31.790> shocking<00:00:32.790> figure<00:00:33.329> in<00:00:33.510> a

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
that's really a shocking figure in a

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.319 
that's really a shocking figure in a
striking<00:00:33.840> figure<00:00:34.610> part<00:00:35.610> of<00:00:35.700> it<00:00:35.790> is<00:00:35.880> a<00:00:35.910> loss<00:00:36.149> of

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
striking figure part of it is a loss of

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.180 
striking figure part of it is a loss of
muscle<00:00:36.540> volume<00:00:36.989> so<00:00:37.170> we<00:00:37.200> see<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.469> decrease<00:00:37.860> in

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
muscle volume so we see a decrease in

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.639 
muscle volume so we see a decrease in
size<00:00:38.399> of<00:00:38.640> our<00:00:38.730> individual<00:00:39.149> muscles<00:00:39.649> and

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
size of our individual muscles and

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.170 
size of our individual muscles and
that's<00:00:40.860> particularly<00:00:41.460> concerning<00:00:41.790> but<00:00:42.090> in

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
that's particularly concerning but in

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.030 
that's particularly concerning but in
addition<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.629> that<00:00:42.809> we<00:00:43.350> see<00:00:43.379> a<00:00:43.530> change<00:00:43.829> in<00:00:43.950> the

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
addition to that we see a change in the

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.799 
addition to that we see a change in the
composition<00:00:44.219> so<00:00:45.180> instead<00:00:45.420> of<00:00:45.510> just<00:00:45.660> having

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
composition so instead of just having

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.229 
composition so instead of just having
very<00:00:46.170> healthy<00:00:46.530> muscle<00:00:46.920> in<00:00:47.129> our<00:00:47.489> legs<00:00:47.760> we<00:00:48.059> see

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
very healthy muscle in our legs we see

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.930 
very healthy muscle in our legs we see
that<00:00:48.450> fat<00:00:48.750> tissue<00:00:49.379> is<00:00:49.770> starting<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.730> surround

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
that fat tissue is starting to surround

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.119 
that fat tissue is starting to surround
the<00:00:51.210> muscles<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:51.719> actually<00:00:51.960> even<00:00:52.129> developing

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
the muscles and actually even developing

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.380 
the muscles and actually even developing
and<00:00:53.340> building<00:00:53.430> up<00:00:53.699> within<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:54.059> muscles

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
and building up within the muscles

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.720 
and building up within the muscles
themselves<00:00:54.510> so<00:00:55.500> we're<00:00:56.460> particularly

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
themselves so we're particularly

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.540 
themselves so we're particularly
interested<00:00:57.210> in<00:00:58.070> emphasizing<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.129> importance

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
interested in emphasizing the importance

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.479 
interested in emphasizing the importance
of<00:00:59.670> skeletal<00:01:00.030> muscle<00:01:00.059> health<00:01:00.449> as<00:01:00.690> we<00:01:01.020> age<00:01:01.309> in<00:01:02.309> a

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
of skeletal muscle health as we age in a

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.609 
of skeletal muscle health as we age in a

few different contexts one is muscle is

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.530 
few different contexts one is muscle is
a<00:01:04.710> very<00:01:04.890> fundamental<00:01:05.309> organ<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.000> maintaining

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
a very fundamental organ and maintaining

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
aging and disease and those are simple

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.730 
aging and disease and those are simple
things<00:01:10.710> like<00:01:11.210> our<00:01:12.210> mobility<00:01:12.510> our<00:01:13.260> ability<00:01:13.710> to

a person's ability to live independently

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.660 
a person's ability to live independently
the<00:01:22.439> second<00:01:22.770> element<00:01:22.860> of<00:01:23.189> muscle<00:01:23.490> health

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
the second element of muscle health

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.370 
the second element of muscle health
that's<00:01:23.850> important<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.420> emphasize<00:01:24.810> are<00:01:25.200> the

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
that's important to emphasize are the

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.010 
that's important to emphasize are the
metabolic<00:01:25.710> implications<00:01:26.460> of<00:01:26.790> having<00:01:27.659> healthy

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
metabolic implications of having healthy

metabolic implications of having healthy
skeletal<00:01:28.439> muscle<00:01:28.790> so<00:01:29.790> we<00:01:29.939> think<00:01:30.090> of<00:01:30.270> the

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
skeletal muscle so we think of the

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.620 
skeletal muscle so we think of the
burden<00:01:31.770> of<00:01:31.860> obesity<00:01:32.310> in<00:01:32.430> today's<00:01:32.670> society<00:01:32.880> the

burden of inactivity and type 2 diabetes

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.020 
burden of inactivity and type 2 diabetes
is<00:01:37.049> a<00:01:37.079> very<00:01:37.350> prevalent<00:01:37.619> problem<00:01:38.490> that<00:01:38.880> we're

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
is a very prevalent problem that we're

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.370 
is a very prevalent problem that we're
thinking<00:01:39.210> about<00:01:39.450> ways<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:39.930> counter<00:01:40.259> and

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
thinking about ways to counter and

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.410 
thinking about ways to counter and
address<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:40.950> we<00:01:41.579> think<00:01:41.820> that<00:01:42.000> skeletal

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
address and we think that skeletal

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.510 
address and we think that skeletal
muscle<00:01:42.689> is<00:01:42.750> a<00:01:42.810> primary<00:01:43.200> organ<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.590> target<00:01:43.979> in

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
muscle is a primary organ to target in

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.510 
muscle is a primary organ to target in
that<00:01:44.610> situation<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:46.290> third<00:01:46.530> element<00:01:47.250> that<00:01:47.280> we

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
that situation the third element that we

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.330 
that situation the third element that we
will<00:01:47.939> emphasize<00:01:48.119> in<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:49.500> context<00:01:49.920> of<00:01:50.009> muscle

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
will emphasize in the context of muscle

there's<00:03:37.100> a<00:03:37.160> stigma<00:03:37.550> to<00:03:37.580> exercise<00:03:38.150> where<00:03:38.390> you

there's a stigma to exercise where you
automatically<00:03:38.900> think<00:03:38.959> of<00:03:39.290> bright<00:03:39.530> lights<00:03:39.800> and

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070 
automatically think of bright lights and

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:42.610

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
truth of the matter is right now we know

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.900

we<00:04:12.380> can<00:04:12.500> do<00:04:12.680> so<00:04:12.890> much<00:04:13.100> now<00:04:13.340> without<00:04:14.170> exerting

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170

elevator but even simpler things we're
just<00:04:24.550> making<00:04:25.030> more<00:04:25.510> and<00:04:25.570> more<00:04:26.370> industrialized

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
just making more and more industrialized

patients that we see at the clinic might

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.750 
patients that we see at the clinic might
be<00:05:16.840> bed<00:05:17.050> bound<00:05:17.230> for<00:05:17.650> a<00:05:17.680> number<00:05:18.070> of<00:05:18.100> reasons<00:05:18.190> and

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:18.760 
be bed bound for a number of reasons and

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.700 
be bed bound for a number of reasons and
finding<00:05:19.660> ways<00:05:19.780> to<00:05:19.810> improve<00:05:20.020> the<00:05:20.440> health<00:05:20.530> of

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710 
finding ways to improve the health of

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:22.140 
finding ways to improve the health of
their<00:05:20.830> skeletal<00:05:21.160> muscle<00:05:21.430> is<00:05:21.520> very<00:05:21.580> important

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.150 
their skeletal muscle is very important

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:24.140 
their skeletal muscle is very important
to<00:05:22.270> us<00:05:22.390> so<00:05:22.630> we're<00:05:23.140> looking<00:05:23.380> at<00:05:23.530> ways

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
to us so we're looking at ways

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.880 
to us so we're looking at ways
pharmacological<00:05:25.150> therapies<00:05:25.570> to<00:05:26.470> disrupt

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:26.890 
pharmacological therapies to disrupt

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:29.810 
pharmacological therapies to disrupt
muscle<00:05:27.790> loss<00:05:27.970> or<00:05:28.210> to<00:05:28.330> augment<00:05:28.720> muscle<00:05:29.200> growth

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 
muscle loss or to augment muscle growth

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.580 
muscle loss or to augment muscle growth
so<00:05:30.820> there's<00:05:31.120> a<00:05:31.210> couple<00:05:31.390> of<00:05:31.570> therapies<00:05:32.440> that

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:32.590 
so there's a couple of therapies that

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:35.010 
so there's a couple of therapies that
are<00:05:32.650> particularly<00:05:33.430> promising<00:05:33.910> right<00:05:34.150> now<00:05:34.300> one

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.020 
are particularly promising right now one

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:36.510 
are particularly promising right now one
that<00:05:35.140> we<00:05:35.260> spend<00:05:35.560> a<00:05:35.590> lot<00:05:35.620> of<00:05:35.770> time<00:05:35.980> studying<00:05:36.160> and

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:36.520 
that we spend a lot of time studying and

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.390 
that we spend a lot of time studying and
showing<00:05:36.790> the<00:05:36.940> merits<00:05:37.270> of<00:05:37.740> targeting<00:05:38.740> is<00:05:38.890> a

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:39.400 
showing the merits of targeting is a

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.210 
showing the merits of targeting is a
protein<00:05:39.790> called<00:05:39.940> myostatin<00:05:40.690> and<00:05:41.220> myostatin

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:42.220 
protein called myostatin and myostatin

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:43.740 
protein called myostatin and myostatin
is<00:05:42.280> a<00:05:42.310> negative<00:05:42.730> regulator<00:05:43.060> of<00:05:43.150> muscle<00:05:43.600> mass

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:43.750 
is a negative regulator of muscle mass

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:45.900 
is a negative regulator of muscle mass
so<00:05:44.110> the<00:05:44.620> idea<00:05:44.920> is<00:05:45.040> that<00:05:45.100> if<00:05:45.310> we<00:05:45.430> can<00:05:45.550> disrupt

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:45.910 
so the idea is that if we can disrupt

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:48.800 
so the idea is that if we can disrupt
mile<00:05:46.750> statin<00:05:47.260> in<00:05:47.470> the<00:05:47.590> body<00:05:47.800> through<00:05:48.190> a<00:05:48.250> drug

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:48.810 
mile statin in the body through a drug

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:51.720 
mile statin in the body through a drug
we<00:05:49.810> can<00:05:49.930> have<00:05:50.080> a<00:05:50.110> powerful<00:05:50.470> effect<00:05:51.040> on<00:05:51.400> muscle

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:51.730 
we can have a powerful effect on muscle

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:53.910 
we can have a powerful effect on muscle
health
