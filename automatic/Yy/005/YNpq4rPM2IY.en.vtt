00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:07.380 
rolled hem to get different looks of

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.560 
rolled hem to get different looks of
stitches<00:00:07.890> but<00:00:08.460> let's<00:00:08.670> say<00:00:08.910> you<00:00:08.969> actually<00:00:09.420> have

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
stitches but let's say you actually have

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:10.970 
stitches but let's say you actually have
different<00:00:10.019> weights<00:00:10.230> of<00:00:10.410> thread<00:00:10.470> on<00:00:10.800> your

different weights of thread on your

different weights of thread on your
serger<00:00:11.550> that<00:00:12.030> would<00:00:12.180> be<00:00:12.330> one<00:00:12.570> like<00:00:12.780> a<00:00:12.900> mixing

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
serger that would be one like a mixing

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.540 
serger that would be one like a mixing
and<00:00:13.440> matching<00:00:13.590> to<00:00:13.980> make<00:00:14.190> sure<00:00:14.370> that

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:14.550 
and matching to make sure that

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:16.160 
and matching to make sure that
everything's<00:00:15.330> looking<00:00:15.480> good<00:00:15.780> I<00:00:15.840> maybe<00:00:16.019> I've

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
everything's looking good I maybe I've

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.109 
everything's looking good I maybe I've

and a different brand over there you

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.550 
and a different brand over there you
might<00:00:20.190> not<00:00:20.490> be<00:00:20.820> balanced<00:00:21.480> notice<00:00:22.080> that<00:00:22.410> your

guess what all you have to do is reset
them<00:00:35.670> back<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:36.149> four<00:00:36.600> so<00:00:36.989> it's<00:00:37.110> no<00:00:37.440> big<00:00:37.470> deal<00:00:37.980> if

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
them back to four so it's no big deal if

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.740 
them back to four so it's no big deal if
you've<00:00:38.430> got<00:00:38.610> people<00:00:39.000> playing<00:00:39.329> with<00:00:39.540> your

something I'm going to loosen the needle
tension

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.700 

yes<00:00:59.820> now<00:01:00.150> I<00:01:00.180> know<00:01:00.390> this<00:01:00.630> is<00:01:00.810> yellow<00:01:01.140> so<00:01:01.320> let<00:01:01.560> you

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
yes now I know this is yellow so let you

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.130 
yes now I know this is yellow so let you
zoom<00:01:01.740> in<00:01:02.070> really<00:01:02.220> really<00:01:02.820> hard<00:01:03.180> here<00:01:03.420> what's

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
zoom in really really hard here what's

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.680 
zoom in really really hard here what's
gonna<00:01:04.290> happen<00:01:04.830> when<00:01:05.190> you<00:01:05.400> usually<00:01:06.180> it's

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:06.690 
gonna happen when you usually it's

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.210 
gonna happen when you usually it's
because<00:01:06.990> people<00:01:07.229> don't<00:01:07.380> get<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.680> thread<00:01:07.979> in

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
because people don't get the thread in

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.280 
because people don't get the thread in
the<00:01:08.580> tension<00:01:08.820> disks<00:01:09.240> remember<00:01:09.570> that's<00:01:09.720> one<00:01:10.140> of

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
the tension disks remember that's one of

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.010 
the tension disks remember that's one of
them<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.950> two<00:01:10.979> that<00:01:11.790> are<00:01:11.850> tightly<00:01:12.330> strung<00:01:12.870> so

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
them the two that are tightly strung so

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.510 
them the two that are tightly strung so
you<00:01:13.110> really<00:01:13.530> need<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:13.740> make<00:01:13.950> sure<00:01:14.010> that<00:01:14.369> either

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
you really need to make sure that either

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.250 
you really need to make sure that either
your<00:01:14.760> presser<00:01:15.119> foot<00:01:15.150> is<00:01:15.360> up<00:01:15.479> when<00:01:15.900> you<00:01:15.990> thread

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:16.260 
your presser foot is up when you thread

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.890 
your presser foot is up when you thread
these<00:01:16.470> or<00:01:17.100> make<00:01:17.610> sure<00:01:17.640> you<00:01:17.850> lay<00:01:18.270> those<00:01:18.479> in<00:01:18.720> and

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
these or make sure you lay those in and

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.690 
these or make sure you lay those in and
give<00:01:19.020> them<00:01:19.110> a<00:01:19.170> little<00:01:19.290> tug<00:01:19.619> tug<00:01:19.860> at<00:01:20.190> the<00:01:20.310> bottom

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
give them a little tug tug at the bottom

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.850 
give them a little tug tug at the bottom
while<00:01:20.880> holding<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.300> top<00:01:21.510> but<00:01:22.110> sometimes<00:01:22.560> the

tensions<00:01:24.479> look<00:01:24.900> at<00:01:25.050> what<00:01:25.170> you<00:01:25.290> get<00:01:25.500> see<00:01:26.010> those

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.190 
tensions look at what you get see those

tensions look at what you get see those
loops<00:01:26.640> you<00:01:26.970> don't<00:01:27.150> have<00:01:27.330> that<00:01:27.450> straight<00:01:28.170> line

want a flat lock which is a whole nother

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.249 
want a flat lock which is a whole nother
stitch<00:01:41.369> but<00:01:41.640> we're<00:01:41.759> not<00:01:41.910> there<00:01:42.149> yet<00:01:42.180> so<00:01:42.990> we

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
stitch but we're not there yet so we

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.029 
stitch but we're not there yet so we
have<00:01:43.289> a<00:01:44.009> issue<00:01:44.700> that<00:01:44.970> seam<00:01:45.509> is<00:01:45.720> not<00:01:46.020> holding<00:01:46.350> to

00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:47.039 
have a issue that seam is not holding to

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:49.010 
have a issue that seam is not holding to
our<00:01:47.310> liking<00:01:47.610> and<00:01:48.030> you<00:01:48.360> would<00:01:48.539> want<00:01:48.780> to

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
our liking and you would want to

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.590 
our liking and you would want to
increase<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:50.130> top<00:01:50.310> tension<00:01:50.789> to<00:01:50.910> close<00:01:51.270> that

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
increase the top tension to close that

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.660 
increase the top tension to close that
up<00:01:51.630> so<00:01:52.229> if<00:01:52.320> you<00:01:52.410> were<00:01:52.530> at<00:01:52.680> 4<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.250> you<00:01:53.340> had<00:01:53.520> that

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
up so if you were at 4 and you had that

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.219 
up so if you were at 4 and you had that
result<00:01:54.060> you<00:01:54.210> need<00:01:54.330> to<00:01:54.450> probably<00:01:54.600> look<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:55.080> see

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
result you need to probably look to see

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.779 
result you need to probably look to see
number<00:01:55.560> one<00:01:55.590> make<00:01:55.979> sure<00:01:56.009> everything<00:01:56.490> else<00:01:56.610> is

00:01:56.779 --> 00:01:56.789 
number one make sure everything else is

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:59.540 
number one make sure everything else is
threaded<00:01:57.149> properly<00:01:57.410> there's<00:01:58.410> no<00:01:58.530> extra<00:01:59.009> hooks

00:01:59.540 --> 00:01:59.550 
threaded properly there's no extra hooks

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.910 
threaded properly there's no extra hooks
around<00:01:59.850> loops<00:02:00.509> around<00:02:00.930> other<00:02:01.140> guides<00:02:01.440> but

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
around loops around other guides but

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.050 
around loops around other guides but
that<00:02:02.100> would<00:02:02.250> be<00:02:02.280> one<00:02:02.580> thing<00:02:02.760> you<00:02:02.880> could

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
that would be one thing you could

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.670 
that would be one thing you could
tighten<00:02:03.510> that<00:02:03.600> up<00:02:03.659> a<00:02:03.869> little<00:02:04.049> bit<00:02:04.260> to<00:02:04.530> make

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
tighten that up a little bit to make

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.359 
tighten that up a little bit to make
that<00:02:04.920> not<00:02:05.549> be<00:02:06.060> loopy<00:02:06.869> on<00:02:07.020> this<00:02:07.350> side<00:02:07.590> let<00:02:08.130> me<00:02:08.220> do

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
that not be loopy on this side let me do

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.100 
that not be loopy on this side let me do
another<00:02:08.399> one<00:02:08.729> let's<00:02:09.060> go<00:02:09.179> ahead<00:02:09.209> and<00:02:09.750> let's

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
another one let's go ahead and let's

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.590 
another one let's go ahead and let's
just<00:02:10.260> loosen<00:02:10.769> for<00:02:11.250> example<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.730> lower<00:02:11.940> the

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
just loosen for example the lower the

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.570 
just loosen for example the lower the
upper<00:02:12.870> looper<00:02:13.320> the<00:02:13.620> green<00:02:13.860> one<00:02:14.040> I'm<00:02:14.160> losing

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
upper looper the green one I'm losing

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:20.190 
upper looper the green one I'm losing
that<00:02:14.730> loosening<00:02:15.269> means<00:02:15.540> a<00:02:15.750> smaller<00:02:16.380> number

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.870 

now<00:02:20.800> I'm<00:02:20.860> not<00:02:20.980> gonna<00:02:21.099> probably<00:02:21.340> see<00:02:21.670> much

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
now I'm not gonna probably see much

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.260 
now I'm not gonna probably see much
change<00:02:22.270> here<00:02:22.750> but<00:02:23.410> just<00:02:23.849> got<00:02:24.849> a<00:02:24.880> little<00:02:25.150> bit

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
change here but just got a little bit

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.170 
change here but just got a little bit
front<00:02:25.540> side<00:02:25.750> looks<00:02:26.200> fine<00:02:26.470> backside<00:02:27.130> it<00:02:27.880> looks

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
front side looks fine backside it looks

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.390 
front side looks fine backside it looks
fine<00:02:28.420> and<00:02:28.660> it<00:02:28.870> actually<00:02:29.319> this<00:02:29.620> seam<00:02:29.890> will<00:02:30.099> hold

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
fine and it actually this seam will hold

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.580 
fine and it actually this seam will hold
but<00:02:31.030> look<00:02:31.330> where<00:02:31.540> your<00:02:31.690> loopers<00:02:32.110> are<00:02:32.290> meeting

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
but look where your loopers are meeting

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.229 
but look where your loopers are meeting
see<00:02:32.800> how<00:02:32.920> they're<00:02:33.069> meeting<00:02:33.459> kind<00:02:33.940> of<00:02:34.030> on<00:02:34.120> the

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
see how they're meeting kind of on the

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:36.570 
see how they're meeting kind of on the
backside<00:02:34.870> so<00:02:35.410> they're<00:02:35.530> not<00:02:35.650> as<00:02:35.860> pretty<00:02:36.280> now

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
backside so they're not as pretty now

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.370 
backside so they're not as pretty now
here's<00:02:37.120> the<00:02:37.300> thing<00:02:37.480> when<00:02:37.630> you<00:02:37.660> have<00:02:37.810> four

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
here's the thing when you have four

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.680 
here's the thing when you have four
matching<00:02:38.950> threads<00:02:39.250> like<00:02:39.489> four<00:02:39.880> white<00:02:40.270> threads

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
matching threads like four white threads

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.170 
matching threads like four white threads
this<00:02:41.230> is<00:02:41.410> not<00:02:41.590> going<00:02:41.739> to<00:02:41.830> be<00:02:41.980> as<00:02:42.160> noticeable<00:02:42.730> as

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
this is not going to be as noticeable as

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.670 
this is not going to be as noticeable as
when<00:02:43.450> we<00:02:43.569> have<00:02:43.780> two<00:02:44.020> different<00:02:44.530> threads

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
when we have two different threads

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.140 
when we have two different threads
meeting<00:02:45.250> we're<00:02:45.370> going<00:02:45.580> oh<00:02:45.730> it's<00:02:45.940> on<00:02:46.060> the

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
meeting we're going oh it's on the

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.210 
meeting we're going oh it's on the
backside<00:02:46.330> but<00:02:47.140> I<00:02:47.170> will<00:02:47.440> tell<00:02:47.650> you<00:02:47.830> if<00:02:47.980> you<00:02:48.130> are

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
backside but I will tell you if you are

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.550 
backside but I will tell you if you are
helping<00:02:48.430> somebody<00:02:48.790> with<00:02:48.970> a<00:02:49.090> 4-h<00:02:49.599> project<00:02:49.630> that

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
helping somebody with a 4-h project that

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.340 
helping somebody with a 4-h project that
4-h<00:02:50.980> judge<00:02:51.310> will<00:02:51.550> dock<00:02:51.790> you<00:02:52.060> and<00:02:52.360> the<00:02:52.989> young

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
4-h judge will dock you and the young

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.580 
4-h judge will dock you and the young
person<00:02:53.620> for<00:02:54.280> not<00:02:54.519> having<00:02:54.970> your<00:02:55.090> serger<00:02:55.660> set<00:02:56.350> up

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
person for not having your serger set up

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.610 
person for not having your serger set up
for<00:02:57.100> a<00:02:57.370> proper<00:02:57.880> balance<00:02:58.480> tent<00:02:58.780> so<00:02:59.019> yes<00:02:59.440> this

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
for a proper balance tent so yes this

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:00.990 
for a proper balance tent so yes this
will<00:02:59.830> work<00:03:00.010> if<00:03:00.340> you're<00:03:00.459> just<00:03:00.640> getting<00:03:00.910> it<00:03:00.970> done

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
will work if you're just getting it done

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.090 
will work if you're just getting it done
but<00:03:01.810> you<00:03:01.900> probably<00:03:02.290> want<00:03:02.530> to<00:03:02.590> balance<00:03:02.950> that

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
but you probably want to balance that

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.580 
but you probably want to balance that
out<00:03:03.160> so<00:03:03.700> here's<00:03:03.970> the<00:03:04.120> thing<00:03:04.330> we<00:03:04.569> could<00:03:04.840> tighten

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
out so here's the thing we could tighten

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.900 
out so here's the thing we could tighten
the<00:03:06.489> green<00:03:06.790> one<00:03:07.090> or<00:03:07.440> if<00:03:08.440> the<00:03:08.739> blue<00:03:09.100> one<00:03:09.430> the

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
the green one or if the blue one the

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.509 
the green one or if the blue one the
lower<00:03:10.239> looper<00:03:10.810> we<00:03:11.739> could<00:03:11.920> loosen<00:03:12.430> that

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
lower looper we could loosen that

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:13.800 
lower looper we could loosen that
because<00:03:12.700> right<00:03:12.880> now<00:03:13.030> it's<00:03:13.209> pulled<00:03:13.569> to<00:03:13.720> the

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
because right now it's pulled to the

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.420 
because right now it's pulled to the
backside<00:03:14.019> it's<00:03:14.470> really<00:03:14.769> really<00:03:14.980> tight<00:03:15.130> so<00:03:15.370> if

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
backside it's really really tight so if

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.280 
backside it's really really tight so if
we<00:03:15.519> loosen<00:03:16.060> that<00:03:16.209> lower<00:03:16.450> looper<00:03:16.870> we<00:03:16.989> would<00:03:17.200> get

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
we loosen that lower looper we would get

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.199 
we loosen that lower looper we would get
the<00:03:17.470> same<00:03:17.680> results<00:03:18.160> sometimes<00:03:18.910> I've<00:03:19.060> been

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
the same results sometimes I've been

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:20.490 
the same results sometimes I've been
known<00:03:19.330> to<00:03:19.450> actually<00:03:19.569> do<00:03:19.810> a<00:03:19.840> little<00:03:20.140> of<00:03:20.319> both

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
known to actually do a little of both

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.680 
known to actually do a little of both
now<00:03:20.769> yes<00:03:21.160> I<00:03:21.340> had<00:03:21.700> loosened<00:03:22.120> the<00:03:22.239> green<00:03:22.450> one<00:03:22.660> so

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
now yes I had loosened the green one so

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.660 
now yes I had loosened the green one so
that<00:03:22.900> does<00:03:23.200> make<00:03:23.380> the<00:03:23.560> blue<00:03:23.739> one<00:03:23.920> tighter<00:03:24.190> and

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
that does make the blue one tighter and

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.370 
that does make the blue one tighter and
I<00:03:24.850> will<00:03:25.030> just<00:03:25.180> put<00:03:25.359> it<00:03:25.450> back<00:03:25.570> to<00:03:25.780> normal<00:03:26.109> but<00:03:26.230> we

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
I will just put it back to normal but we

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.080 
I will just put it back to normal but we
could<00:03:26.530> kind<00:03:26.709> of<00:03:26.769> do<00:03:26.890> a<00:03:26.920> little<00:03:27.220> of<00:03:27.400> both<00:03:27.430> loosen

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
could kind of do a little of both loosen

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.970 
could kind of do a little of both loosen
one<00:03:28.120> tighten<00:03:28.720> the<00:03:28.810> other<00:03:28.840> or<00:03:29.260> vice<00:03:29.320> versa

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
one tighten the other or vice versa

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.610 
one tighten the other or vice versa
depending<00:03:30.370> on<00:03:30.730> which<00:03:30.880> way<00:03:31.090> we<00:03:31.690> need<00:03:31.959> that<00:03:32.380> edge

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
depending on which way we need that edge

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.289 
depending on which way we need that edge
to<00:03:32.920> roll<00:03:33.130> so<00:03:33.579> just<00:03:33.790> make<00:03:33.940> sure<00:03:33.970> you<00:03:34.150> have<00:03:34.269> a

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
to roll so just make sure you have a

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:35.789 
to roll so just make sure you have a
nice<00:03:34.480> pretty<00:03:34.720> edge<00:03:34.959> once<00:03:35.260> again<00:03:35.530> I'm<00:03:35.650> looking

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799 
nice pretty edge once again I'm looking

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:39.390 
nice pretty edge once again I'm looking
more<00:03:36.250> for<00:03:37.120> that<00:03:37.269> blue<00:03:37.780> straight<00:03:38.500> line<00:03:38.890> of<00:03:39.370> the

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
more for that blue straight line of the

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.330 
more for that blue straight line of the
lower<00:03:40.359> looper<00:03:40.930> to<00:03:41.530> be<00:03:41.680> straight<00:03:42.100> at<00:03:42.250> the

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
lower looper to be straight at the

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.400 
lower looper to be straight at the
bottom<00:03:42.700> because<00:03:42.880> that<00:03:43.329> is<00:03:43.660> what's<00:03:43.959> holding

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
bottom because that is what's holding

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.640 
bottom because that is what's holding
the<00:03:44.650> seam<00:03:44.950> all<00:03:45.280> together<00:03:45.880> all<00:03:46.870> right<00:03:46.930> when<00:03:47.530> we

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650
