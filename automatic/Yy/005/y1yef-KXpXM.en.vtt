sure how that worked but obviously use
the<00:01:39.479> touchscreen<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:40.380> you<00:01:40.680> had<00:01:40.829> instead<00:01:41.100> of

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
the touchscreen and you had instead of

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.609 
the touchscreen and you had instead of
just<00:01:41.400> identifying<00:01:42.060> knows<00:01:42.750> that<00:01:42.990> match<00:01:43.140> w<00:01:43.530> Ed's

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
just identifying knows that match w Ed's

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.350 
just identifying knows that match w Ed's
are<00:01:43.710> kind<00:01:43.860> of<00:01:43.920> just<00:01:44.640> like<00:01:44.670> drag<00:01:45.030> your<00:01:45.210> finger

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
are kind of just like drag your finger

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.870 
are kind of just like drag your finger
around<00:01:45.630> or<00:01:46.079> trace<00:01:46.320> it<00:01:46.530> like<00:01:46.740> yeah<00:01:47.280> like<00:01:47.460> find<00:01:47.759> a

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
around or trace it like yeah like find a

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.429 
around or trace it like yeah like find a
password<00:01:48.390> but<00:01:48.570> then<00:01:48.600> like<00:01:48.750> avoid<00:01:49.140> this

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
password but then like avoid this

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.370 
password but then like avoid this
scanner<00:01:49.829> that<00:01:50.100> was<00:01:50.280> going<00:01:50.579> across<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:51.380> it's

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
scanner that was going across and it's

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.200 
scanner that was going across and it's
probably<00:01:52.500> pretty<00:01:52.740> cool<00:01:53.040> yeah<00:01:53.460> so<00:01:53.490> what<00:01:53.850> a<00:01:53.880> lot

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
probably pretty cool yeah so what a lot

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.550 
probably pretty cool yeah so what a lot
of<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.390> additions<00:01:54.689> were<00:01:54.750> basically<00:01:55.079> there

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
of the additions were basically there

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.160 
of the additions were basically there
just<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:56.100> a<00:01:56.340> lot<00:01:56.700> of<00:01:56.729> its<00:01:56.909> menu<00:01:57.270> ish<00:01:57.479> stuff<00:01:57.840> but

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
just to a lot of its menu ish stuff but

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.240 
just to a lot of its menu ish stuff but
yeah<00:01:58.350> there's<00:01:58.530> a<00:01:58.590> little<00:01:58.680> bit<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:58.950> gameplay

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
yeah there's a little bit the gameplay

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.620 
yeah there's a little bit the gameplay
stuff<00:01:59.460> as<00:01:59.579> you<00:01:59.670> mentioned<00:02:00.030> one<00:02:00.329> of<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.479> things

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
stuff as you mentioned one of the things

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:01.880 
stuff as you mentioned one of the things
that<00:02:00.689> I<00:02:00.810> actually<00:02:00.960> liked<00:02:01.259> about<00:02:01.409> it<00:02:01.530> is<00:02:01.680> I

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
that I actually liked about it is I

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.440 
that I actually liked about it is I
believe<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:02.759> you<00:02:02.850> mentioned<00:02:02.969> this<00:02:03.299> briefly

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
believe and you mentioned this briefly

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.389 
believe and you mentioned this briefly
was<00:02:03.810> just<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.140> sonar<00:02:04.500> thing<00:02:04.770> what<00:02:04.979> I<00:02:05.009> think<00:02:05.280> is

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
was just the sonar thing what I think is

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.910 
was just the sonar thing what I think is
cool<00:02:05.610> too<00:02:06.000> is<00:02:06.180> that<00:02:06.299> you<00:02:06.450> can<00:02:06.630> hold<00:02:07.290> up<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:07.740> wii

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
cool too is that you can hold up the wii

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.710 
cool too is that you can hold up the wii
u<00:02:08.129> gamepad<00:02:08.550> like<00:02:08.819> you<00:02:08.910> do<00:02:09.030> in<00:02:09.119> other<00:02:09.270> games<00:02:09.450> and

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
u gamepad like you do in other games and

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.360 
u gamepad like you do in other games and
kind<00:02:09.899> of<00:02:09.959> scan<00:02:10.289> and<00:02:10.619> look<00:02:10.739> around<00:02:10.860> like<00:02:11.220> that

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
kind of scan and look around like that

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.280 
kind of scan and look around like that
which<00:02:11.700> may<00:02:12.300> get<00:02:12.480> old<00:02:12.690> i<00:02:12.840> don't<00:02:13.020> know

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
which may get old i don't know

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.390 
which may get old i don't know
it's<00:02:13.469> kind<00:02:13.709> of<00:02:13.739> a<00:02:13.829> core<00:02:14.010> use<00:02:14.189> of<00:02:14.310> the

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
it's kind of a core use of the

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.339 
it's kind of a core use of the
technology<00:02:14.549> and<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.120> fact<00:02:15.299> that<00:02:15.390> you<00:02:15.540> can<00:02:15.689> you

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
technology and the fact that you can you

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:17.720 
technology and the fact that you can you
know<00:02:16.439> you<00:02:16.500> can<00:02:16.590> kind<00:02:16.890> of<00:02:16.920> use<00:02:16.980> it<00:02:17.250> outside<00:02:17.430> the

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
know you can kind of use it outside the

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.640 
know you can kind of use it outside the
game<00:02:17.909> space<00:02:18.209> right<00:02:18.810> and<00:02:19.079> then<00:02:19.319> they<00:02:19.439> have<00:02:19.560> the

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
game space right and then they have the

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.770 
game space right and then they have the
evidence<00:02:19.819> thing<00:02:20.819> on<00:02:21.060> there<00:02:21.269> as<00:02:21.390> well<00:02:21.569> right

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
evidence thing on there as well right

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.149 
evidence thing on there as well right
with<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.260> bits<00:02:22.469> in<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:22.709> game<00:02:22.859> where<00:02:23.040> your

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:23.159 
with the bits in the game where your

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:24.589 
with the bits in the game where your
track<00:02:23.370> you<00:02:23.640> know<00:02:23.700> looking<00:02:23.879> for<00:02:24.090> pools<00:02:24.480> of

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
track you know looking for pools of

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:25.940 
track you know looking for pools of
blood<00:02:24.629> and<00:02:24.989> that<00:02:25.079> kind<00:02:25.319> of<00:02:25.349> stuff<00:02:25.409> you<00:02:25.680> kind<00:02:25.829> of

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
blood and that kind of stuff you kind of

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.470 
blood and that kind of stuff you kind of
moving<00:02:26.189> the<00:02:26.370> thing<00:02:26.579> around<00:02:26.819> which<00:02:27.060> was<00:02:27.239> cool

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
moving the thing around which was cool

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.209 
moving the thing around which was cool
they<00:02:28.319> also<00:02:28.469> had<00:02:28.650> a<00:02:28.680> thing<00:02:28.829> which<00:02:28.980> actually

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:29.219 
they also had a thing which actually

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:30.800 
they also had a thing which actually
doesn't<00:02:29.519> really<00:02:29.879> relate<00:02:30.329> to<00:02:30.569> the<00:02:30.689> new

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
doesn't really relate to the new

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.979 
doesn't really relate to the new
hardware<00:02:31.140> so<00:02:31.319> much<00:02:31.439> but<00:02:31.650> that<00:02:31.769> new<00:02:31.920> will<00:02:32.459> be<00:02:32.760> 80

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
hardware so much but that new will be 80

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:35.839 
hardware so much but that new will be 80
knows<00:02:33.989> the<00:02:34.409> be<00:02:34.560> 80<00:02:34.709> mode<00:02:35.189> so<00:02:35.519> you<00:02:35.579> basically

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
knows the be 80 mode so you basically

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:38.390 
knows the be 80 mode so you basically
it's<00:02:36.599> an<00:02:36.720> acronym<00:02:36.959> for<00:02:37.230> something<00:02:37.409> as<00:02:37.950> I<00:02:38.010> don't

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
it's an acronym for something as I don't

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
it's an acronym for something as I don't
know<00:02:38.519> maybe<00:02:39.769> badass<00:02:41.090> something<00:02:42.090> probably

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
know maybe badass something probably

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.050

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
that's all I know that oh and this

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.280 
that's all I know that oh and this
totally<00:02:45.389> missed<00:02:45.569> that<00:02:45.659> never<00:02:45.930> thought<00:02:46.109> that

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
totally missed that never thought that

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.289

yes its lucky you're here G so you
basically<00:02:48.450> charge<00:02:49.079> up<00:02:49.260> your<00:02:49.319> meet<00:02:49.530> this<00:02:49.650> meter

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
basically charge up your meet this meter

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.500 
basically charge up your meet this meter
right<00:02:50.250> and<00:02:50.400> it<00:02:50.459> looks<00:02:50.609> like<00:02:50.670> yeah<00:02:51.030> it's<00:02:51.419> like

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
right and it looks like yeah it's like

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.899 
right and it looks like yeah it's like
as<00:02:51.750> you're<00:02:51.959> fighting<00:02:52.379> you<00:02:52.590> just<00:02:53.459> charging

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:53.909 
as you're fighting you just charging

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:55.399 
as you're fighting you just charging
something<00:02:54.239> up<00:02:54.359> I<00:02:54.450> guess<00:02:54.629> maybe<00:02:54.810> by<00:02:55.019> just<00:02:55.230> not

00:02:55.399 --> 00:02:55.409 
something up I guess maybe by just not

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:57.500 
something up I guess maybe by just not
getting<00:02:55.620> here<00:02:55.859> or<00:02:56.099> by<00:02:56.220> fish<00:02:56.519> and<00:02:56.760> dudes<00:02:56.939> off<00:02:57.180> or

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
getting here or by fish and dudes off or

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.059 
getting here or by fish and dudes off or
like<00:02:57.629> through<00:02:57.959> combos<00:02:58.409> and<00:02:58.439> then<00:02:58.769> you<00:02:58.859> press<00:02:59.010> a

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
like through combos and then you press a

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:00.530 
like through combos and then you press a
button<00:02:59.220> on<00:02:59.609> the<00:02:59.700> wii<00:02:59.819> u<00:03:00.000> screen<00:03:00.299> and<00:03:00.480> it

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
button on the wii u screen and it

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.179 
button on the wii u screen and it
basically<00:03:00.659> launches<00:03:01.409> Batman<00:03:01.829> into<00:03:02.069> this

00:03:02.179 --> 00:03:02.189 
basically launches Batman into this

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
look like it was about on par with what

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.039 
look like it was about on par with what
you've<00:03:20.340> seen<00:03:20.489> from<00:03:20.549> the<00:03:20.760> 360<00:03:21.269> and<00:03:21.389> ps3<00:03:21.510> virgin
