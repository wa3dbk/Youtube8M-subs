solving<00:00:02.490> compound<00:00:02.850> inequalities<00:00:03.540> there<00:00:04.140> are

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
solving compound inequalities there are

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.130 
solving compound inequalities there are
two<00:00:04.410> types<00:00:04.710> of<00:00:04.859> compound<00:00:05.310> inequalities<00:00:06.140> the

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
two types of compound inequalities the

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.720 
two types of compound inequalities the
first<00:00:07.379> type<00:00:07.589> is<00:00:07.620> the<00:00:07.830> type<00:00:08.010> where<00:00:08.280> inequality

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
first type is the type where inequality

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.790 
first type is the type where inequality
has<00:00:09.300> three<00:00:09.599> sections<00:00:10.080> separated<00:00:10.320> by<00:00:10.740> two

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
has three sections separated by two

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.839 
has three sections separated by two
inequality<00:00:11.670> symbols<00:00:12.590> the<00:00:13.590> second<00:00:14.040> is<00:00:14.250> the<00:00:14.670> or

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
inequality symbols the second is the or

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.970 
inequality symbols the second is the or
type<00:00:15.240> where<00:00:15.750> there<00:00:16.020> are<00:00:16.260> two<00:00:16.440> inequality

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
type where there are two inequality

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.000 
type where there are two inequality
separated<00:00:17.490> by<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:17.670> word<00:00:17.880> or<00:00:18.740> let's<00:00:19.740> look<00:00:19.890> at

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
separated by the word or let's look at

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.950 
separated by the word or let's look at
the<00:00:20.100> end<00:00:20.340> type<00:00:20.939> first<00:00:21.410> with<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:23.840> variables<00:00:24.840> in

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
the end type first with the variables in

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.710 
the end type first with the variables in
the<00:00:25.019> middle<00:00:25.849> we<00:00:26.849> can<00:00:27.000> solve<00:00:27.180> this<00:00:27.449> two

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
the middle we can solve this two

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.359 
the middle we can solve this two
different<00:00:28.019> ways<00:00:28.170> we<00:00:28.410> can<00:00:28.529> separate<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.160> three

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
different ways we can separate the three

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:30.710 
different ways we can separate the three
elements<00:00:29.550> in<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.029> two<00:00:30.179> separate

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
elements in the two separate

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.810 
elements in the two separate
inequalities<00:00:31.050> then<00:00:31.800> graph<00:00:32.070> them<00:00:32.369> both<00:00:32.579> and

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
inequalities then graph them both and

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.139 
inequalities then graph them both and
see<00:00:32.940> what<00:00:33.120> happens<00:00:33.480> on<00:00:33.570> a<00:00:33.630> number<00:00:33.899> line<00:00:33.930> or

see what happens on a number line or

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:37.310 
see what happens on a number line or
we<00:00:36.149> can<00:00:36.300> solve<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.660> three<00:00:36.840> expression

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
we can solve the three expression

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.229 
we can solve the three expression
simultaneously<00:00:38.160> giving<00:00:38.309> us<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.760> unknown<00:00:39.090> in

to<00:00:54.030> Halloween<00:00:54.480> I<00:00:54.690> think<00:00:54.870> it's<00:00:54.989> fun<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.230> think

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
to Halloween I think it's fun to think

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:03.529 
to Halloween I think it's fun to think
about<00:01:00.170> now<00:01:01.170> in<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:02.489> middle<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.940> seven<00:01:03.270> minus

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
about now in the middle the seven minus

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.510 
about now in the middle the seven minus
seven<00:01:03.690> cancels<00:01:06.860> we<00:01:07.860> bring<00:01:08.070> everything<00:01:08.310> else

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
seven cancels we bring everything else

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.280 
seven cancels we bring everything else
down<00:01:09.170> so<00:01:10.170> we<00:01:10.290> have<00:01:10.670> six<00:01:11.670> is<00:01:11.939> less<00:01:12.180> than<00:01:12.479> 2x

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
down so we have six is less than 2x

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.640 
down so we have six is less than 2x
which<00:01:13.860> is<00:01:13.890> less<00:01:14.520> than<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.760> traitor<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.150> 10<00:01:15.650> we

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
which is less than a traitor to 10 we

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:17.960 
which is less than a traitor to 10 we
need<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.830> divide<00:01:17.130> everything<00:01:17.430> by<00:01:17.820> the

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
need to divide everything by the

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.240 
need to divide everything by the
coefficient<00:01:18.570> of<00:01:18.600> x<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:18.900> get<00:01:19.080> x<00:01:19.350> isolated<00:01:19.950> so<00:01:20.100> we

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
coefficient of x to get x isolated so we

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.630 
coefficient of x to get x isolated so we
divide<00:01:20.549> everything<00:01:20.850> by<00:01:21.180> two<00:01:22.310> the<00:01:23.310> two<00:01:23.460> over

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
divide everything by two the two over

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.510 
divide everything by two the two over
two<00:01:23.790> in<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:23.939> middle<00:01:24.180> cancel<00:01:25.220> and<00:01:26.220> we<00:01:26.340> bring

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
two in the middle cancel and we bring

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.999 
two in the middle cancel and we bring
down<00:01:26.670> what's<00:01:27.000> left<00:01:27.090> 3<00:01:27.750> is<00:01:27.990> less<00:01:28.200> than<00:01:28.259> X<00:01:28.799> which

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
down what's left 3 is less than X which

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.520 
down what's left 3 is less than X which
is<00:01:29.400> less<00:01:29.430> than<00:01:29.820> or<00:01:31.130> equal<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.280> five<00:01:33.470> now<00:01:34.470> we

really<00:02:02.899> is<00:02:03.899> two<00:02:04.350> separate<00:02:04.740> problems<00:02:05.009> that

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
really is two separate problems that

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.010 
really is two separate problems that

the open boundary point goes here at
negative<00:02:44.070> one<00:02:44.930> and<00:02:45.930> since<00:02:46.170> the<00:02:46.260> symbol<00:02:46.620> is

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
negative one and since the symbol is

to the right for the other problem of
the<00:02:55.140> or<00:02:55.260> we<00:02:55.680> first<00:02:56.040> draw<00:02:56.310> the<00:02:56.340> salt<00:02:56.820> point<00:02:57.090> at

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
the or we first draw the salt point at

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.250 
the or we first draw the salt point at
negative<00:02:57.300> seven<00:02:57.930> and<00:02:59.090> since<00:03:00.090> symbol<00:03:00.480> is<00:03:01.020> to

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
negative seven and since symbol is to

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.130 
negative seven and since symbol is to
the<00:03:01.350> left<00:03:01.530> we<00:03:01.680> draw<00:03:01.860> the<00:03:01.920> arrow<00:03:02.160> to<00:03:02.280> the<00:03:02.400> left

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
the left we draw the arrow to the left

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.800 
the left we draw the arrow to the left
and<00:03:04.140> so<00:03:05.070> this<00:03:05.250> is<00:03:05.460> what<00:03:05.670> the<00:03:05.850> ore<00:03:06.000> looks<00:03:06.570> like

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
and so this is what the ore looks like

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.630 
and so this is what the ore looks like
and<00:03:07.080> it's<00:03:07.230> with<00:03:07.530> arrows<00:03:07.920> going<00:03:08.160> in<00:03:08.370> opposite

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
and it's with arrows going in opposite

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.080 
and it's with arrows going in opposite
