00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:06.779
 Hello dear fans 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.290
 here, Andreas finds the next wish 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:13.920
 fight duel mode 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:16.529
 Here you see I have four new arenas 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.430
 to get what is new is from the 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.250
 first series 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.340
 So if you are the kite world ice world 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.930
 pirate world and the spirit world have 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:29.240
 could those on it could put this 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:33.059
 unlock additional arenas 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:35.219
 but we want the new figures times 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.300
 on our favorite arena the 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:41.640
 necropolis arena fight 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:44.780
 Now the city ​​and you have 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:53.120
 certainly it was already read above 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:53.120
 against robert ley choir 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:01.219
 place and destroy dia 

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:16.460
 against robot looks quite different 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.719
 as from the series 1 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.640
 the skeletons are standing up there that was 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:27.640
 not before 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.020
 graphic is much better but 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:41.850
 friendly now let's go or already 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:47.730
 Two of the harm I have been playing 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:50.190
 to be robert line robot 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:54.290
 a bit more agile than me but for that 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.290
 I can fly the goad place 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.890
 Yes, oh, now I can do it 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:08.560
 not the damage is cool 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.890
 but the best attack is not 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.890
 raised 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.060
 almost on par 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:24.920
 also the advantage of 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.590
 green 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:31.580
 fly 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:33.940
 although I'm on my person fighter though 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:37.670
 I can shoot the rockets 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:41.330
 who won think robot has 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:45.190
 won but very close was hornier 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.190
 So fight makes thumbs up
