out<00:00:23.519> name<00:00:23.820> for<00:00:24.210> example<00:00:26.810> and<00:00:28.460> if<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.760> line<00:00:30.000> is

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
out name for example and if the line is

out name for example and if the line is
red<00:00:30.630> and<00:00:30.990> it<00:00:31.590> means<00:00:31.830> that<00:00:34.820> GPS<00:00:35.820> signal<00:00:36.180> is<00:00:36.300> not

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
red and it means that GPS signal is not

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.590 
red and it means that GPS signal is not
available<00:00:36.930> now<00:00:37.140> you've<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.950> right<00:00:38.420> the<00:00:39.420> line

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
available now you've the right the line

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.110 
available now you've the right the line
is<00:00:39.750> green<00:00:40.530> then<00:00:41.149> GPS<00:00:42.149> signal<00:00:42.510> is<00:00:42.660> available<00:00:43.100> we

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120 
is green then GPS signal is available we

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.020 
is green then GPS signal is available we
suggest<00:00:45.120> that<00:00:45.360> you<00:00:46.320> save<00:00:46.559> applicate<00:00:47.190> you<00:00:47.789> save

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
suggest that you save applicate you save

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.369 
suggest that you save applicate you save
coordinates<00:00:48.629> only<00:00:49.559> with<00:00:50.399> GPS<00:00:51.090> detected

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:59.150 

location<00:00:55.379> for<00:00:56.340> example<00:00:56.730> you<00:00:57.390> saw<00:00:57.890> just<00:00:58.890> for<00:00:59.129> a

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
location for example you saw just for a

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.039 
location for example you saw just for a
moment<00:00:59.489> and<00:01:00.559> accuracy<00:01:01.559> is<00:01:01.620> low<00:01:02.059> it's<00:01:03.059> 100

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
moment and accuracy is low it's 100

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.429 
moment and accuracy is low it's 100
meters

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
meters

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.950 
meters
that's<00:01:05.100> why<00:01:05.339> application<00:01:06.270> will<00:01:06.420> warn<00:01:06.720> you

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
that's why application will warn you

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.390 
that's why application will warn you
that<00:01:09.110> it<00:01:10.110> would<00:01:10.590> be<00:01:10.619> better<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:11.189> wait<00:01:11.340> until

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
that it would be better to wait until

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.219 
that it would be better to wait until
it's<00:01:12.240> safe<00:01:12.780> it<00:01:13.560> get<00:01:13.799> better<00:01:14.100> coordinate<00:01:15.110> ok<00:01:16.110> we

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
it's safe it get better coordinate ok we

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.130 
it's safe it get better coordinate ok we
say<00:01:17.210> we<00:01:18.210> save<00:01:18.479> with<00:01:18.869> accuracy<00:01:19.560> 27<00:01:20.400> meters<00:01:20.759> and

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
say we save with accuracy 27 meters and

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.429 
say we save with accuracy 27 meters and
go<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.200> location<00:01:22.770> list<00:01:23.360> now<00:01:24.360> you<00:01:24.420> can<00:01:24.780> find<00:01:25.320> it

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
go to location list now you can find it

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.950 
go to location list now you can find it
here<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:27.829> for<00:01:28.829> example<00:01:29.369> you<00:01:29.520> can<00:01:29.909> choose<00:01:30.390> any

this is a screen with navigation once
GPS<00:01:45.479> once<00:01:46.259> coordinate<00:01:46.799> will<00:01:47.100> be<00:01:47.130> detected<00:01:48.229> you

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
GPS once coordinate will be detected you

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.830 
GPS once coordinate will be detected you
will<00:01:49.470> be<00:01:49.649> navigated<00:01:49.799> to<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:51.020> to<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.170> chosen
