00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
will see why at the very end but this is

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.920 
will see why at the very end but this is
a<00:00:26.369> pretty<00:00:26.640> tough<00:00:26.910> map<00:00:27.210> for<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.539> most<00:00:27.720> part

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
a pretty tough map for the most part

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.500 
a pretty tough map for the most part
this<00:00:28.380> map<00:00:28.680> there<00:00:29.189> really<00:00:29.429> aren't<00:00:29.730> any<00:00:30.029> good

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
this map there really aren't any good

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.540 
this map there really aren't any good
areas<00:00:31.050> where<00:00:31.199> you<00:00:31.260> can<00:00:31.320> stay<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.830> entire<00:00:31.949> game

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
areas where you can stay the entire game

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.700 
areas where you can stay the entire game
you're<00:00:33.450> gonna<00:00:33.540> have<00:00:33.719> to<00:00:33.780> run<00:00:34.020> around<00:00:34.200> quite<00:00:34.680> a

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
you're gonna have to run around quite a

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.080 
you're gonna have to run around quite a
bit<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:35.100> that's<00:00:35.370> what<00:00:35.520> I<00:00:35.579> do<00:00:35.640> throughout<00:00:35.969> this

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
bit and that's what I do throughout this

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.690 
bit and that's what I do throughout this
entire<00:00:36.270> game<00:00:36.630> play<00:00:36.870> it's<00:00:37.469> very

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:37.700 
entire game play it's very

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.580 
entire game play it's very
uncharacteristic<00:00:38.700> of<00:00:38.820> how<00:00:39.270> I<00:00:39.300> play<00:00:39.930> infected

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
uncharacteristic of how I play infected

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.830 
uncharacteristic of how I play infected
and<00:00:40.739> it's<00:00:41.550> very<00:00:41.879> very<00:00:42.120> difficult<00:00:42.180> for<00:00:42.600> me

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
and it's very very difficult for me

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.369 
and it's very very difficult for me
because<00:00:42.960> my<00:00:43.379> my<00:00:44.340> rushing<00:00:44.879> aggression<00:00:45.600> you

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
because my my rushing aggression you

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.920 
because my my rushing aggression you
know<00:00:46.500> my<00:00:46.980> brushing<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:47.640> aggression<00:00:47.969> type<00:00:48.780> of

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
know my brushing and aggression type of

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.350 
know my brushing and aggression type of
gameplay<00:00:49.140> kind<00:00:49.559> of<00:00:49.620> kicks<00:00:49.860> in<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.270> for<00:00:51.270> the

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
gameplay kind of kicks in and for the

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.150 
gameplay kind of kicks in and for the
most<00:00:51.570> part<00:00:51.719> I'm<00:00:52.140> a<00:00:52.170> little<00:00:52.469> bit<00:00:52.649> too

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
most part I'm a little bit too

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.610 
most part I'm a little bit too
aggressive<00:00:53.910> when<00:00:54.570> it<00:00:54.660> comes<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:55.199> playing<00:00:55.469> in

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
aggressive when it comes to playing in

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.099 
aggressive when it comes to playing in
fact<00:00:55.800> you<00:00:55.890> I<00:00:55.980> have<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.160> run<00:00:56.309> around<00:00:56.780> it's<00:00:57.780> it's

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
fact you I have to run around it's it's

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.770 
fact you I have to run around it's it's
tough<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:58.800> this<00:00:58.949> map<00:00:59.190> never<00:00:59.910> really<00:01:00.270> gets<00:01:00.510> a

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
tough and this map never really gets a

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.110 
tough and this map never really gets a
plate<00:01:01.440> on<00:01:01.620> it<00:01:01.649> always<00:01:01.980> gets<00:01:02.100> it<00:01:02.879> never<00:01:03.000> gets

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
plate on it always gets it never gets

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.149 
plate on it always gets it never gets
voted<00:01:03.390> so<00:01:04.019> you<00:01:04.080> really<00:01:04.470> don't<00:01:04.860> have<00:01:05.100> that

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
voted so you really don't have that

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.940 
voted so you really don't have that
opportunity<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:06.270> play<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.170> lot<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.619> get<00:01:07.890> the

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
opportunity to play a lot and get the

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.679 
opportunity to play a lot and get the
practice<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:08.549> figure<00:01:08.820> out<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.060> map<00:01:09.240> so<00:01:09.659> I

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
practice and figure out the map so I

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.210 
practice and figure out the map so I
think<00:01:09.990> that's<00:01:10.290> why<00:01:10.470> this<00:01:10.530> was<00:01:10.770> a<00:01:10.799> little<00:01:11.100> bit

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
think that's why this was a little bit

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.340 
think that's why this was a little bit
tough<00:01:11.400> for<00:01:11.430> me<00:01:11.760> for<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.720> most<00:01:12.900> part<00:01:13.020> though

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
tough for me for the most part though

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.800 
tough for me for the most part though
I'm<00:01:13.560> going<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.220> stay<00:01:14.490> in<00:01:14.820> in<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.240> back<00:01:15.420> part<00:01:15.750> of

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
I'm going to stay in in the back part of

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.480 
I'm going to stay in in the back part of
the<00:01:15.900> map<00:01:16.080> where<00:01:16.229> I<00:01:16.290> was<00:01:16.470> very<00:01:16.830> start<00:01:17.220> of<00:01:17.340> this

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
the map where I was very start of this

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.880 
the map where I was very start of this
game<00:01:17.700> um<00:01:17.909> I'll<00:01:18.900> go<00:01:19.080> back<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.290> it<00:01:19.560> here<00:01:19.680> in<00:01:19.770> just

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
game um I'll go back to it here in just

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.380 
game um I'll go back to it here in just
a<00:01:19.979> bit<00:01:20.100> but<00:01:20.250> this<00:01:20.400> area<00:01:20.640> right<00:01:20.790> here<00:01:20.850> is<00:01:21.000> kind

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
a bit but this area right here is kind

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.149 
a bit but this area right here is kind
of<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.570> hot<00:01:21.720> spot<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.170> danger<00:01:22.470> zone<00:01:22.500> this<00:01:23.070> is

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
of the hot spot the danger zone this is

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.620 
of the hot spot the danger zone this is
where<00:01:23.310> a<00:01:23.340> majority<00:01:23.460> infected<00:01:24.240> will<00:01:24.390> come

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
where a majority infected will come

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.660 
where a majority infected will come
after<00:01:24.930> they<00:01:25.049> just<00:01:25.080> spawn<00:01:25.650> just<00:01:26.189> because<00:01:26.490> they

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
after they just spawn just because they

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:27.800 
after they just spawn just because they
all<00:01:26.790> try<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:27.000> get<00:01:27.119> in<00:01:27.240> that<00:01:27.270> building<00:01:27.689> back

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
all try to get in that building back

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.499 
all try to get in that building back
there<00:01:27.840> and<00:01:28.759> it's<00:01:29.759> just<00:01:29.909> one<00:01:30.030> thing<00:01:30.150> to<00:01:30.210> keep<00:01:30.360> an

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
there and it's just one thing to keep an

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:31.760 
there and it's just one thing to keep an
eye<00:01:30.630> out<00:01:30.659> if<00:01:30.900> you're<00:01:31.020> trying<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.290> pick<00:01:31.470> up<00:01:31.500> two

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
eye out if you're trying to pick up two

00:02:58.159 --> 00:02:58.169 
like that so I was rushing around I was

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:00.110 
like that so I was rushing around I was
trying<00:02:58.469> to<00:02:58.500> pick<00:02:58.650> up<00:02:58.799> the<00:02:58.919> kills<00:02:59.129> but<00:02:59.639> I<00:02:59.969> also
