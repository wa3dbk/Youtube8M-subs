00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:39.079 
while and a lot of bands have tried to

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:42.190 
while and a lot of bands have tried to
you<00:02:39.859> know<00:02:39.889> revive<00:02:40.519> it<00:02:40.790> but<00:02:41.450> they<00:02:41.780> really

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
you know revive it but they really

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.490 
you know revive it but they really
really<00:02:42.409> have<00:02:42.859> been<00:02:42.950> missing<00:02:43.010> the<00:02:43.459> point<00:02:43.700> in

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
really have been missing the point in

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.319 
really have been missing the point in
the<00:02:45.500> production<00:02:45.919> department<00:02:46.370> even<00:02:46.970> you<00:02:47.299> know

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:47.329 
the production department even you know

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:49.210 
the production department even you know
if<00:02:47.659> they'll<00:02:47.900> even<00:02:47.930> go<00:02:48.319> a<00:02:48.560> lot<00:02:48.769> of<00:02:48.859> bands<00:02:49.040> I'll

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
if they'll even go a lot of bands I'll

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.720 
if they'll even go a lot of bands I'll
even<00:02:49.400> go<00:02:49.639> analog<00:02:50.629> and<00:02:50.989> try<00:02:51.709> to<00:02:51.769> capture<00:02:52.069> it<00:02:52.310> but

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
even go analog and try to capture it but

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.129 
even go analog and try to capture it but
it's<00:02:52.879> still<00:02:53.120> too<00:02:53.359> polished<00:02:53.629> and<00:02:54.019> I<00:02:54.049> think

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:54.139 
it's still too polished and I think

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:57.580 
it's still too polished and I think
these<00:02:54.349> guys<00:02:54.560> have<00:02:54.950> just<00:02:55.189> nailed<00:02:55.760> it<00:02:56.060> and<00:02:56.590> just

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590
