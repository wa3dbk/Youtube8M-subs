00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 Hello everyone and welcome to the second one 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.259
 episode of a manga school today 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.500
 we will learn to draw male face 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.240
 you are ready we start again as we have 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.670
 done last time with the face 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.130
 feminine also in this case we leave 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.560
 drawing an oval on this occasion 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.840
 but we should emphasize much more 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.150
 the lower part thus making the 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.580
 mandible much more square and manly 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.140
 we must remember that when 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.420
 we make a male character 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.120
 all its elements will be more 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.460
 angular dry compared to those of 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.620
 a female character as always 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.360
 we draw guidelines for the eyes 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.640
 I prefer to draw it in this one 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.100
 way to give more volume to the skull 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.410
 alternatively they can be drawn 2 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.059
 to have a more precise air in which 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.950
 go and position the eyes 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.399
 we design our guideline 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.160
 vertical for the nose and mouth now 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.379
 we will create the neck this time but being 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.320
 that of a boy will not be done 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.820
 thin but broad and muscular and with the 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.559
 Adam's apple in full view 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.110
 also the collarbones will be more 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.850
 pronounced now let's define the 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.369
 our face and right here 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.920
 without my noticing the 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.720
 camcorder has stopped shooting 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.970
 always my usual bad luck 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:22.140
 when I noticed that I decided 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.970
 to redo another video starting at 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.009
 where it left off 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.540
 superimposed a white sheet on the drawing 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.189
 that we ended up making that 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.320
 it was the same as the original 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.689
 at this point we are going to draw the 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.450
 ears we need to position them a 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.860
 a little below the guideline 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.159
 for the eyes we had designed 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:44.220
 at the beginning remember to do enough 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.290
 big never minute for one guy the other 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.390
 time I started with drawing i 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.610
 these eyes because there is no order 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.380
 precise in accomplishing something that 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.390
 that we can't wait to draw it 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.149
 we draw at the bottom is fun 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.189
 absolute ok now let's start drawing 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.530
 hair one of the parts I like 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.180
 more I decided to brush him 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.950
 therefore you will struggle a lot 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.439
 attach the locks that they will make 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.420
 part of the hairline will be a lot 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.009
 nearby 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.500
 while the others will be much more 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.450
 distant to give the idea of â€‹â€‹movement 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.760
 of course you can do them like 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.680
 you want so many ways to 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.930
 draw hair both as a boy and 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.430
 the girl that I will explain to you in the next 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.440
 hair tutorial 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.720
 in fact I also designed the goatee 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.270
 which is not the goatee but the fly 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.540
 for a specific reason and reality 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.400
 eating and my trust other than us 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.620
 i can do i am in desperate case 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.390
 we begin to make eyes that to 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.930
 contrary to the female ones will be 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:44.300
 much smaller and angular in 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:47.180
 Drawing below I had made very 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:49.459
 larger because I had spent too much 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.860
 of my style and it was not good then 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:54.380
 in this case the golds made in 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.209
 as general as possible here is here 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.430
 I just finished drawing the 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:00.200
 eyelids and now we begin to trace 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.260
 eyebrows as opposed to those 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.209
 female will be very thick and thick 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.090
 even the biggest nose is 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:09.860
 pronounced obviously even more pointed 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.030
 we can say that in the case of 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.959
 male character 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:16.519
 we must do the opposite or almost to 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:18.320
 what we do in the character 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:20.780
 female of the female character 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:23.209
 we must always try to make everything 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.370
 very small and pretty while in the case 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:27.859
 of the male one we must 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.549
 try to enlarge and render 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:33.440
 rough let's say what we design 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:36.680
 we begin to create the eyeballs e 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:40.160
 we insert our light points which they are 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.739
 simply the reflection of the 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:45.549
 light on our eye 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:49.670
 we draw the pupils and less reflexes e 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:54.079
 we put more glitter on it 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:56.329
 look will be masculine masculine now 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:04:00.730
 we create the mouth I wanted to give him a 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:04:04.390
 expression from cool to and ebay bea 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:06.790
 here is also check the teeth and we have 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.780
 finished guys because now we move on to 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.909
 finishing touches 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:12.909
 always remember to give many 

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:15.310
 eye shadows so as to 

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:17.680
 liven up the look so as not to do it 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.540
 look vacant these days i have 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:23.290

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:26.440
