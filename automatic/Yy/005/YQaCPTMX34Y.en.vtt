and<00:01:58.290> what<00:01:58.409> that<00:01:58.530> does<00:01:58.649> is<00:01:58.710> when<00:01:58.860> it's<00:01:58.979> activate

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
and what that does is when it's activate

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:00.530 
and what that does is when it's activate
it<00:01:59.520> allows<00:01:59.729> them<00:01:59.850> sort<00:02:00.090> of<00:02:00.149> like<00:02:00.329> pay

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
it allows them sort of like pay

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.880 
it allows them sort of like pay
