tile<00:01:58.060> and<00:01:58.360> so<00:01:58.600> this<00:01:58.750> is<00:01:58.869> going<00:01:59.020> to<00:01:59.080> continue<00:01:59.410> as

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
tile and so this is going to continue as

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.190 
tile and so this is going to continue as
players<00:02:00.490> will<00:02:00.759> look<00:02:00.970> at<00:02:01.210> the<00:02:01.690> tiles<00:02:02.050> that

players will look at the tiles that

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.590 
players will look at the tiles that
they're<00:02:02.380> on<00:02:02.530> and<00:02:02.800> move<00:02:03.490> based<00:02:04.030> on<00:02:04.179> those<00:02:04.330> tiles

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
they're on and move based on those tiles

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.279 
they're on and move based on those tiles

could pay any tile and move anywhere on
the<00:02:47.890> map<00:02:48.040> so<00:02:48.250> if<00:02:48.340> you<00:02:48.430> can<00:02:48.580> move<00:02:48.700> to<00:02:48.880> the<00:02:49.000> middle

it<00:03:29.380> reminded<00:03:29.980> me<00:03:30.040> very<00:03:30.160> much<00:03:30.490> of<00:03:30.640> another<00:03:31.060> game

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
it reminded me very much of another game

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.810 
it reminded me very much of another game
called<00:03:31.660> hey<00:03:31.990> that's<00:03:32.320> my<00:03:32.530> fish<00:03:32.920> and<00:03:33.160> hey<00:03:33.580> that's

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:33.820 
called hey that's my fish and hey that's

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.130 
called hey that's my fish and hey that's
my<00:03:33.940> fish<00:03:34.180> you<00:03:34.210> have<00:03:34.420> penguins<00:03:34.840> that<00:03:34.990> move

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
my fish you have penguins that move

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.070 
my fish you have penguins that move
around<00:03:35.290> the<00:03:35.590> board<00:03:35.830> and<00:03:36.070> are<00:03:36.910> collecting<00:03:37.780> fish

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080 
around the board and are collecting fish

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.930 
around the board and are collecting fish
tiles<00:03:38.500> but<00:03:38.740> the<00:03:38.860> fish<00:03:39.070> tiles<00:03:39.370> it<00:03:39.490> breaks<00:03:39.760> up

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
tiles but the fish tiles it breaks up

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.330 
tiles but the fish tiles it breaks up
the<00:03:40.090> board<00:03:40.300> and<00:03:40.420> ice<00:03:40.540> floes<00:03:40.810> and<00:03:40.840> so<00:03:41.140> on<00:03:41.340> this

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
the board and ice floes and so on this

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.640 
the board and ice floes and so on this
game<00:03:42.580> has<00:03:42.700> a<00:03:42.730> similar<00:03:43.120> feel<00:03:43.330> to<00:03:43.510> that<00:03:43.600> so<00:03:43.900> I<00:03:43.930> did

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
game has a similar feel to that so I did

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.440 
game has a similar feel to that so I did
do<00:03:44.950> some<00:03:45.130> comparisons<00:03:45.760> but<00:03:45.850> I<00:03:45.910> have<00:03:46.150> to<00:03:46.270> say<00:03:46.420> I

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
do some comparisons but I have to say I

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:47.940 
do some comparisons but I have to say I
like<00:03:46.870> this<00:03:47.200> one<00:03:47.410> better

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
like this one better

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.670 
like this one better
now<00:03:48.910> taking<00:03:49.450> out<00:03:49.570> the<00:03:49.690> comparisons<00:03:50.260> to<00:03:50.470> hey

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
now taking out the comparisons to hey

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.620 
now taking out the comparisons to hey
that's<00:03:50.860> my<00:03:51.010> fish<00:03:51.250> I<00:03:51.460> just<00:03:51.910> looking<00:03:52.420> at<00:03:52.510> this

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
that's my fish I just looking at this

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.350 
that's my fish I just looking at this
game<00:03:52.840> as<00:03:53.050> its<00:03:53.350> as<00:03:53.530> its<00:03:53.890> own<00:03:54.100> it<00:03:54.730> was<00:03:54.910> a<00:03:54.940> really

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 
game as its as its own it was a really

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.420 
game as its as its own it was a really
entertaining<00:03:55.750> little<00:03:56.440> game<00:03:56.680> because<00:03:57.160> it<00:03:57.370> was

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
entertaining little game because it was

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.670 
entertaining little game because it was
just<00:03:57.640> so<00:03:57.790> simple<00:03:58.000> you<00:03:58.600> move<00:03:58.870> and<00:03:59.110> so<00:03:59.440> as<00:03:59.560> you

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
just so simple you move and so as you

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.380 
just so simple you move and so as you
move<00:03:59.890> you're<00:04:00.070> basically<00:04:00.520> trying<00:04:00.880> to<00:04:01.030> move<00:04:01.210> to

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
move you're basically trying to move to

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.180 
move you're basically trying to move to
get<00:04:01.480> the<00:04:01.630> best<00:04:01.840> fruits<00:04:02.230> but<00:04:02.500> you<00:04:02.620> also<00:04:02.800> want<00:04:03.130> to

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
get the best fruits but you also want to

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.700 
get the best fruits but you also want to
move<00:04:03.520> to<00:04:04.150> get<00:04:04.300> into<00:04:04.570> position<00:04:05.170> to<00:04:05.290> take<00:04:05.440> those

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:05.710 
move to get into position to take those

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:07.620 
move to get into position to take those
better<00:04:05.950> fruits<00:04:06.310> and<00:04:06.580> I<00:04:06.970> really<00:04:07.300> like<00:04:07.480> the

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.630 
better fruits and I really like the

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.990 
better fruits and I really like the
aspect<00:04:07.750> that<00:04:08.110> you<00:04:08.380> could<00:04:08.680> just<00:04:09.400> take<00:04:09.640> the<00:04:09.700> tile

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
aspect that you could just take the tile

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.020 
aspect that you could just take the tile
you're<00:04:10.240> on<00:04:10.390> and<00:04:10.690> then<00:04:11.470> discard<00:04:12.250> another<00:04:12.400> tile

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
you're on and then discard another tile

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.330 
you're on and then discard another tile
and<00:04:13.330> move<00:04:13.630> that<00:04:13.810> many<00:04:14.020> spaces<00:04:14.380> so<00:04:14.800> those<00:04:14.980> one

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
and move that many spaces so those one

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.670 
and move that many spaces so those one
tiles<00:04:15.640> that<00:04:15.850> you<00:04:15.910> take<00:04:16.239> can<00:04:16.780> be<00:04:16.810> very<00:04:17.080> handy<00:04:17.560> if

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
tiles that you take can be very handy if

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.890 
tiles that you take can be very handy if
you<00:04:17.770> can<00:04:17.950> position<00:04:18.250> yourself<00:04:18.520> you<00:04:19.420> might<00:04:19.600> take

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
you can position yourself you might take

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.800 
you can position yourself you might take
a<00:04:19.960> four<00:04:20.320> tile<00:04:20.560> and<00:04:20.890> then<00:04:21.520> not<00:04:22.300> move<00:04:22.570> at<00:04:22.720> all

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
a four tile and then not move at all

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.930 
a four tile and then not move at all
just<00:04:23.140> stay<00:04:23.440> there<00:04:23.710> and<00:04:23.770> then<00:04:24.130> pay<00:04:24.370> a<00:04:24.400> one<00:04:24.670> tile

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
just stay there and then pay a one tile

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.150 
just stay there and then pay a one tile
move<00:04:25.240> right<00:04:25.870> next<00:04:26.170> to<00:04:26.230> it<00:04:26.290> take<00:04:26.500> a<00:04:26.530> five<00:04:26.830> and<00:04:27.070> if

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
move right next to it take a five and if

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.710 
move right next to it take a five and if
you're<00:04:27.310> good<00:04:27.730> you<00:04:27.880> can<00:04:27.910> trade<00:04:28.270> in<00:04:28.390> several

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
you're good you can trade in several

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.020 
you're good you can trade in several
smaller<00:04:29.050> tiles<00:04:29.350> for<00:04:30.190> several<00:04:30.490> larger<00:04:30.820> ones

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
smaller tiles for several larger ones

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.780 
smaller tiles for several larger ones
this<00:04:31.540> isn't<00:04:31.870> a<00:04:31.930> game<00:04:32.110> of<00:04:32.320> great<00:04:32.590> strategy<00:04:33.430> and

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:33.790 
this isn't a game of great strategy and

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:35.430 
this isn't a game of great strategy and
