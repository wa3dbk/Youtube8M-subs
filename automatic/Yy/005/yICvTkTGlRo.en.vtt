to talk about a couple of things one
using<00:00:16.200> pure<00:00:16.470> nickel<00:00:16.800> strings<00:00:17.190> and<00:00:17.610> number<00:00:18.390> two

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600

if you have a strat trying out fenders
bullet<00:00:21.630> in<00:00:21.810> strings<00:00:22.789> so<00:00:23.789> I'll<00:00:23.880> start<00:00:24.090> off

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
bullet in strings so I'll start off

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.540 
bullet in strings so I'll start off
talking<00:00:24.599> about<00:00:24.990> pure<00:00:25.289> nickel<00:00:25.679> strings<00:00:26.099> and

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
talking about pure nickel strings and

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.019 
talking about pure nickel strings and
here<00:00:27.090> I<00:00:27.150> have<00:00:27.470> D<00:00:28.470> are<00:00:28.679> pure<00:00:29.070> blues<00:00:29.400> which<00:00:29.849> is<00:00:30.000> a

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
here I have D are pure blues which is a

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.120 
here I have D are pure blues which is a
pure<00:00:30.330> nickel<00:00:30.689> string<00:00:31.019> now<00:00:31.800> what<00:00:32.009> does<00:00:32.099> that

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
pure nickel string now what does that

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:32.980 
pure nickel string now what does that
mean

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:32.990 
mean

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.840 
mean
generally<00:00:33.990> electric<00:00:34.590> guitar<00:00:34.890> strings<00:00:35.309> the

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
generally electric guitar strings the

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.060 
generally electric guitar strings the
treble<00:00:36.270> strings<00:00:36.480> one<00:00:37.170> two<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:37.530> three<00:00:37.800> are

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
treble strings one two and three are

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.369 
treble strings one two and three are
going<00:00:38.190> to<00:00:38.250> be<00:00:38.370> just<00:00:38.640> regular<00:00:39.059> plain<00:00:39.510> steel<00:00:40.020> and

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
going to be just regular plain steel and

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.700 
going to be just regular plain steel and
then<00:00:41.210> usually<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.629> fourth<00:00:43.079> to<00:00:43.289> the<00:00:43.320> sixth

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
then usually the fourth to the sixth

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.250 
then usually the fourth to the sixth
strings<00:00:44.010> are<00:00:44.250> going<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.550> be<00:00:44.610> wound<00:00:45.030> with<00:00:45.930> some

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
strings are going to be wound with some

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.069 
strings are going to be wound with some
sort<00:00:46.500> of<00:00:46.559> material<00:00:47.030> generally<00:00:48.030> some<00:00:48.809> sort<00:00:49.050> of

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
sort of material generally some sort of

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.160 
sort of material generally some sort of
a<00:00:49.199> steel<00:00:49.530> alloy<00:00:50.100> now<00:00:50.820> there's<00:00:51.390> nickel-plated

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
a steel alloy now there's nickel-plated

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.779 
a steel alloy now there's nickel-plated
steel<00:00:52.320> which<00:00:52.770> is<00:00:52.949> a<00:00:52.980> little<00:00:53.219> bit<00:00:53.370> warmer<00:00:53.760> than

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
steel which is a little bit warmer than

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.880 
steel which is a little bit warmer than
steel<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.629> then<00:00:54.840> there<00:00:55.020> is<00:00:55.109> pure<00:00:55.500> nickel

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
steel and then there is pure nickel

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.430 
steel and then there is pure nickel
which<00:00:56.160> is<00:00:56.190> what<00:00:56.489> these<00:00:56.699> are<00:00:56.969> so<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.230> bass

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
which is what these are so the bass

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.369 
which is what these are so the bass
strings<00:00:58.739> are<00:00:59.340> wound<00:00:59.699> with<00:01:00.269> pure<00:01:00.719> nickel<00:01:01.170> which

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
strings are wound with pure nickel which

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.020 
strings are wound with pure nickel which
sounds<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:02.010> lot<00:01:02.160> warmer<00:01:02.609> than<00:01:03.510> other<00:01:04.140> alloys

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
sounds a lot warmer than other alloys

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.370 
sounds a lot warmer than other alloys
basically<00:01:06.030> this<00:01:06.300> was<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.630> way<00:01:06.750> strings<00:01:07.170> were

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
basically this was the way strings were

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.520 
basically this was the way strings were
made<00:01:07.590> back<00:01:08.010> in<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.280> 50s<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:08.970> 60s<00:01:09.030> at<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:10.320> dawn

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
made back in the 50s and 60s at the dawn

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.470 
made back in the 50s and 60s at the dawn
of<00:01:10.560> rock<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.160> roll<00:01:11.340> so<00:01:11.760> you<00:01:11.820> get<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.270> really

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:12.480 
of rock and roll so you get a really

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.110 
of rock and roll so you get a really
nice<00:01:12.750> warm<00:01:13.170> kind<00:01:14.040> of<00:01:14.220> vintage<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:14.880> classic

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:15.120 
nice warm kind of vintage and classic

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.520 
nice warm kind of vintage and classic
rock<00:01:15.690> blues<00:01:16.170> tone<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:17.900> they're<00:01:18.900> also<00:01:19.140> great

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
rock blues tone and they're also great

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.080 
rock blues tone and they're also great
if<00:01:19.800> you<00:01:19.920> have<00:01:20.010> really<00:01:20.310> bright<00:01:20.550> sounding

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
if you have really bright sounding

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.760 
if you have really bright sounding
guitar<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:21.870> want<00:01:22.050> to<00:01:22.140> warm<00:01:22.350> it<00:01:22.500> up<00:01:22.620> a

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
guitar and you want to warm it up a

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.980 
guitar and you want to warm it up a
little<00:01:22.950> bit<00:01:23.160> so<00:01:23.490> if<00:01:24.150> you're<00:01:24.390> playing<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.780> single

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
little bit so if you're playing a single

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.560 
little bit so if you're playing a single
coil<00:01:25.410> like<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:25.800> strat<00:01:26.220> or<00:01:26.430> a<00:01:26.460> tele<00:01:26.730> and<00:01:27.120> it's

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
coil like a strat or a tele and it's

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.390 
coil like a strat or a tele and it's
just<00:01:27.750> a<00:01:27.840> little<00:01:27.990> too<00:01:28.230> bright<00:01:28.500> using<00:01:29.130> pure

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
just a little too bright using pure

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.480 
just a little too bright using pure
nickel<00:01:29.700> strings<00:01:30.410> is<00:01:31.410> a<00:01:31.470> really<00:01:31.860> great<00:01:32.190> way<00:01:32.460> to

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
nickel strings is a really great way to

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.050 
nickel strings is a really great way to
warm<00:01:33.300> the<00:01:33.540> guitar<00:01:33.900> up<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:34.230> little<00:01:34.410> bit<00:01:35.060> so

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
warm the guitar up a little bit so

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.030 
warm the guitar up a little bit so
speaking<00:01:36.570> of<00:01:36.690> strats<00:01:37.020> I<00:01:37.290> also<00:01:37.440> have<00:01:37.830> these

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
speaking of strats I also have these

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.250 
speaking of strats I also have these
these<00:01:38.460> are<00:01:38.730> fender<00:01:39.150> bullet<00:01:39.630> in<00:01:39.810> strings

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:40.260 
these are fender bullet in strings

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.100 
these are fender bullet in strings
they're<00:01:40.710> pure<00:01:41.100> nickel<00:01:41.660> but<00:01:42.660> I<00:01:42.690> should<00:01:42.960> also

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
they're pure nickel but I should also

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.740 
they're pure nickel but I should also
note<00:01:43.530> that<00:01:43.640> fender<00:01:44.640> makes<00:01:44.910> non<00:01:45.270> bullet

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
note that fender makes non bullet

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.660 
note that fender makes non bullet
strings<00:01:46.170> just<00:01:46.500> like<00:01:46.740> with<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.040> regular<00:01:47.190> ball

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
strings just like with the regular ball

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.080 
strings just like with the regular ball
end<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.450> they<00:01:48.570> also<00:01:48.750> make<00:01:49.580> you<00:01:50.580> know<00:01:50.730> other

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
end and they also make you know other

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.880 
end and they also make you know other
kinds<00:01:51.660> of<00:01:51.750> strings<00:01:52.110> that<00:01:52.290> are<00:01:52.410> not<00:01:52.590> pure

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
kinds of strings that are not pure

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.420 
kinds of strings that are not pure
nickel<00:01:53.250> like<00:01:53.460> nickel<00:01:53.820> plated<00:01:54.240> or<00:01:54.510> steel<00:01:55.020> wrap

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
nickel like nickel plated or steel wrap

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.170 
nickel like nickel plated or steel wrap
so<00:01:56.430> anyway<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.540> bullets<00:01:58.020> are<00:01:58.290> designed

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
so anyway the bullets are designed

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.290 
so anyway the bullets are designed
specifically<00:02:00.180> for<00:02:00.330> use<00:02:00.720> with<00:02:01.040> Stratocaster

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.300 
specifically for use with Stratocaster

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.440 
specifically for use with Stratocaster
tail<00:02:03.300> pieces<00:02:03.810> they<00:02:04.050> have<00:02:04.080> a<00:02:04.290> bullet-shaped

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
tail pieces they have a bullet-shaped

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.719 
tail pieces they have a bullet-shaped
string<00:02:06.450> end<00:02:06.750> that<00:02:07.590> fits<00:02:08.099> into<00:02:08.750> the

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
string end that fits into the

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.649 
string end that fits into the
it<00:02:11.300> fits<00:02:11.599> snugly<00:02:11.989> into<00:02:12.440> the<00:02:12.739> tremolo<00:02:13.659> routing

00:02:14.649 --> 00:02:14.659 
it fits snugly into the tremolo routing

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:18.970 
it fits snugly into the tremolo routing
in<00:02:14.959> strats<00:02:15.739> so<00:02:16.670> the<00:02:17.480> idea<00:02:17.870> is<00:02:18.140> that<00:02:18.170> the<00:02:18.680> snug

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
in strats so the idea is that the snug

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.270 
in strats so the idea is that the snug
fit<00:02:19.310> of<00:02:19.580> the<00:02:19.760> bullet<00:02:20.060> in<00:02:20.209> makes<00:02:20.629> the<00:02:20.840> strings

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
fit of the bullet in makes the strings

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.789 
fit of the bullet in makes the strings
more<00:02:22.280> stable<00:02:23.000> in<00:02:23.239> terms<00:02:23.299> of<00:02:23.840> tuning<00:02:24.140> you<00:02:24.590> get<00:02:24.769> a

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:24.799 
more stable in terms of tuning you get a

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:27.039 
more stable in terms of tuning you get a
little<00:02:25.069> bit<00:02:25.159> better<00:02:25.370> sustain<00:02:25.730> and<00:02:26.420> they're

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:27.049 
little bit better sustain and they're

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:29.250 
little bit better sustain and they're
supposed<00:02:27.379> to<00:02:27.500> be<00:02:27.620> less<00:02:27.830> likely<00:02:28.129> to<00:02:28.310> break<00:02:28.549> in

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
supposed to be less likely to break in

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.900 
supposed to be less likely to break in
general<00:02:30.260> I<00:02:30.440> found<00:02:30.799> that<00:02:31.190> the<00:02:31.430> bullet<00:02:31.580> end

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
general I found that the bullet end

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.800 
general I found that the bullet end
strings<00:02:32.830> mostly<00:02:33.830> do<00:02:34.069> what<00:02:34.340> they<00:02:34.519> say<00:02:34.849> you<00:02:35.629> do

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
strings mostly do what they say you do

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.050 
strings mostly do what they say you do
get<00:02:36.019> some<00:02:36.260> more<00:02:36.440> tuning<00:02:36.829> stability<00:02:37.069> you<00:02:37.879> do

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
get some more tuning stability you do

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.229 
get some more tuning stability you do
get<00:02:38.269> a<00:02:38.299> little<00:02:38.599> bit<00:02:38.750> more<00:02:38.989> sustained<00:02:39.680> I<00:02:40.519> never

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 
get a little bit more sustained I never

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:43.500 
get a little bit more sustained I never
really<00:02:41.510> broke<00:02:41.690> a<00:02:41.750> lot<00:02:41.959> of<00:02:42.019> strings<00:02:42.440> anyway<00:02:42.920> but

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
really broke a lot of strings anyway but

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.210 
really broke a lot of strings anyway but
you<00:02:44.510> know<00:02:44.660> I<00:02:44.690> can<00:02:45.019> see<00:02:45.200> how<00:02:45.349> they<00:02:45.530> would<00:02:45.769> be<00:02:45.980> a

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
you know I can see how they would be a

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.220 
you know I can see how they would be a
little<00:02:46.760> less<00:02:46.879> likely<00:02:47.299> to<00:02:47.329> break<00:02:47.569> because<00:02:48.049> they

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
little less likely to break because they

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.610 
little less likely to break because they
feel<00:02:48.500> a<00:02:48.829> little<00:02:49.400> bit<00:02:49.519> stiffer<00:02:50.150> so<00:02:51.079> the

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
feel a little bit stiffer so the

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.470 
feel a little bit stiffer so the
flipside<00:02:51.859> is<00:02:52.310> is<00:02:52.609> that<00:02:52.819> they're<00:02:53.000> not<00:02:53.150> quite<00:02:53.359> as

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
flipside is is that they're not quite as

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.210 
flipside is is that they're not quite as
loose<00:02:53.930> if<00:02:54.319> you<00:02:54.440> really<00:02:54.680> like<00:02:54.859> a<00:02:54.890> loose

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
loose if you really like a loose

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.030 
loose if you really like a loose
sounding<00:02:55.940> string<00:02:56.180> feeling<00:02:57.079> string<00:02:57.440> if<00:02:57.769> you're

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
sounding string feeling string if you're

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.000 
sounding string feeling string if you're
doing<00:02:58.160> a<00:02:58.310> lot<00:02:58.430> of<00:02:58.549> bends<00:02:59.079> I<00:03:00.079> don't<00:03:00.739> know<00:03:00.859> that

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
doing a lot of bends I don't know that

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.740 
doing a lot of bends I don't know that
that<00:03:01.190> necessarily<00:03:01.370> makes<00:03:01.970> them<00:03:02.209> harder<00:03:02.629> to

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
that necessarily makes them harder to

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.589 
that necessarily makes them harder to
bend<00:03:02.959> it's<00:03:03.319> just<00:03:03.530> kind<00:03:04.160> of<00:03:04.220> a<00:03:04.310> feel<00:03:04.640> thing<00:03:05.030> the

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:05.599 
bend it's just kind of a feel thing the

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:08.140 
bend it's just kind of a feel thing the
flipside<00:03:05.989> of<00:03:06.049> that<00:03:06.230> is<00:03:06.590> is<00:03:06.920> that<00:03:07.700> they<00:03:07.879> seem<00:03:08.120> to

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
flipside of that is is that they seem to

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.940 
flipside of that is is that they seem to
stay<00:03:08.540> in<00:03:08.690> tune<00:03:08.900> a<00:03:08.930> little<00:03:09.230> bit<00:03:09.440> better<00:03:09.650> and

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
stay in tune a little bit better and

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.039 
stay in tune a little bit better and
like<00:03:10.489> I<00:03:10.609> say<00:03:10.819> you<00:03:10.879> do<00:03:11.180> get<00:03:11.359> a<00:03:11.420> little<00:03:11.629> bit<00:03:11.840> more

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.049 
like I say you do get a little bit more

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:15.640 
like I say you do get a little bit more
sustain<00:03:13.060> the<00:03:14.060> flipside<00:03:14.480> of<00:03:14.690> the<00:03:14.810> sustain<00:03:15.260> is

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
sustain the flipside of the sustain is

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.289 
sustain the flipside of the sustain is
that<00:03:16.010> it<00:03:16.190> seems<00:03:16.430> like<00:03:16.639> they're<00:03:16.910> a<00:03:16.940> little<00:03:17.030> bit

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
that it seems like they're a little bit

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:20.199 
that it seems like they're a little bit
less<00:03:17.480> dynamic<00:03:17.810> because<00:03:18.530> of<00:03:18.859> that<00:03:19.040> so<00:03:19.459> it's

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
less dynamic because of that so it's

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:22.809 
less dynamic because of that so it's
kind<00:03:20.510> of<00:03:20.540> a<00:03:20.690> mixed<00:03:20.959> package<00:03:21.440> you<00:03:21.769> have<00:03:22.280> some

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:22.819 
kind of a mixed package you have some

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:24.670 
kind of a mixed package you have some
benefits<00:03:23.359> and<00:03:23.599> some<00:03:23.870> things<00:03:24.109> that<00:03:24.230> you<00:03:24.349> give

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
benefits and some things that you give

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.420 
benefits and some things that you give
up<00:03:24.889> with<00:03:25.700> the<00:03:25.910> Bulacan<00:03:26.480> strings<00:03:26.989> but<00:03:27.530> if<00:03:27.769> you

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
up with the Bulacan strings but if you

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.849 
up with the Bulacan strings but if you
have<00:03:28.579> a<00:03:28.609> strat<00:03:29.060> then<00:03:29.569> you<00:03:30.079> should<00:03:30.349> probably

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:30.859 
have a strat then you should probably

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:32.979 
have a strat then you should probably
try<00:03:31.310> them<00:03:31.489> out<00:03:31.669> at<00:03:31.819> one<00:03:32.000> point<00:03:32.269> just<00:03:32.569> to<00:03:32.720> see<00:03:32.900> if

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
try them out at one point just to see if

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:34.659 
try them out at one point just to see if
you<00:03:33.109> like<00:03:33.319> them<00:03:33.500> or<00:03:33.650> not<00:03:33.709> you<00:03:34.130> may<00:03:34.280> decide<00:03:34.609> that

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:34.669 
you like them or not you may decide that

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:37.449 
you like them or not you may decide that
you<00:03:34.849> do<00:03:35.150> if<00:03:35.989> you<00:03:36.169> don't<00:03:36.440> have<00:03:36.680> a<00:03:36.709> strat<00:03:37.130> you

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
you do if you don't have a strat you

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:39.339 
you do if you don't have a strat you
should<00:03:37.639> also<00:03:37.790> note<00:03:38.209> that<00:03:38.239> the<00:03:38.630> fender<00:03:38.959> bullet

00:03:39.339 --> 00:03:39.349 
should also note that the fender bullet

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:42.190 
should also note that the fender bullet
strings<00:03:39.940> will<00:03:40.940> not<00:03:41.359> work<00:03:41.660> and<00:03:41.900> your<00:03:42.019> guitar

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
strings will not work and your guitar

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.080 
strings will not work and your guitar
you<00:03:42.590> should<00:03:42.829> just<00:03:43.010> use<00:03:43.190> regular<00:03:43.430> ball<00:03:43.849> and

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
you should just use regular ball and

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.539 
you should just use regular ball and
strings<00:03:44.510> because<00:03:45.019> the<00:03:45.169> bullets<00:03:45.500> will<00:03:45.680> be<00:03:45.829> too

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
strings because the bullets will be too

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:49.509 
strings because the bullets will be too
big<00:03:46.849> to<00:03:47.150> go<00:03:47.299> through<00:03:47.660> most<00:03:48.319> tale<00:03:48.709> pieces<00:03:49.220> like

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 
big to go through most tale pieces like

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:52.150 
big to go through most tale pieces like
if<00:03:49.669> you<00:03:49.819> have<00:03:49.940> a<00:03:49.970> Gibson<00:03:50.660> style<00:03:51.169> tail<00:03:51.440> piece<00:03:51.769> or

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
if you have a Gibson style tail piece or

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.539 
if you have a Gibson style tail piece or
like<00:03:52.549> the<00:03:53.260> string<00:03:54.260> through<00:03:54.500> body<00:03:54.739> telly<00:03:55.190> or

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:55.549 
like the string through body telly or

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:57.280 
like the string through body telly or
anything<00:03:55.790> like<00:03:56.090> that<00:03:56.150> and<00:03:56.690> may<00:03:56.870> not<00:03:57.049> work<00:03:57.109> for

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
anything like that and may not work for

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.220 
anything like that and may not work for
you<00:03:57.590> so<00:03:57.919> like<00:03:58.579> I<00:03:58.639> say<00:03:58.879> fender<00:03:59.239> makes<00:03:59.480> ball<00:03:59.959> ends

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
you so like I say fender makes ball ends

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.030 
you so like I say fender makes ball ends
in<00:04:00.650> bullet<00:04:01.010> in<00:04:01.129> strings<00:04:01.519> both<00:04:02.620> so<00:04:03.620> these<00:04:03.769> days

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
in bullet in strings both so these days
