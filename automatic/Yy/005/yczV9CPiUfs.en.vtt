00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
with maybe it was the formation I played

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.060 
with maybe it was the formation I played
I<00:01:39.450> played<00:01:39.479> it<00:01:39.900> I<00:01:40.020> believe<00:01:40.229> four<00:01:40.590> three<00:01:40.829> two<00:01:41.040> one

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
I played it I believe four three two one

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.760 
I played it I believe four three two one
back<00:01:41.490> then<00:01:41.700> but<00:01:41.850> still<00:01:42.119> he<00:01:42.659> played<00:01:42.899> so<00:01:43.439> very

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
back then but still he played so very

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.740 
back then but still he played so very
back<00:01:44.100> there<00:01:44.369> but<00:01:44.579> his<00:01:44.790> Barcelona<00:01:45.240> version<00:01:45.600> is

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
back there but his Barcelona version is

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.510 
back there but his Barcelona version is
extremely<00:01:46.530> good<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:46.950> I<00:01:47.009> believe<00:01:47.250> he<00:01:47.340> got<00:01:47.460> a

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
extremely good and I believe he got a

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.249 
extremely good and I believe he got a
one<00:01:47.759> goal<00:01:47.970> a<00:01:48.030> game<00:01:48.299> that<00:01:48.540> is<00:01:48.600> kind<00:01:48.930> of<00:01:48.990> go<00:01:49.200> to

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
one goal a game that is kind of go to

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.319 
one goal a game that is kind of go to

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
game ratio at the moment which is a

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.719 
game ratio at the moment which is a
quite<00:01:51.780> good<00:01:52.140> almost<00:01:52.380> as<00:01:52.680> good<00:01:52.860> as<00:01:52.920> Abraham<00:01:53.700> a

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
I went into the file and it was just a

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.600 
I went into the file and it was just a
