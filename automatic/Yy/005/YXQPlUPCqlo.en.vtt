00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.410
 hello now i'm on the map 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.500
 Altai Range 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.719
 where we discuss the illusions of battlefield 4 i 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.759
 just captured point b and in the process 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.190
 capture hiding from the enemy behind this 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.350
 blue barrel of water she will not stop 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.600
 bullets but provide visual cover for 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.939
 so that the enemy did not notice me 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.890
 I think you agree with me because 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:29.369
 now let's see how it is 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:30.960
 looks from the other player no 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.120
 this is not a tricky installation how you can 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.100
 seem at first glance just like that 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.920
 looks like my hideout for another player 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.960
 not only the water barrel disappeared but also 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:45.750
 my player's model is looked perfectly in 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:48.350
 the other side let's see what 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.850
 happens if i open fire 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.309
 after that my player promptly 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.469
 turns in the right direction even 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.789
 given that the body still has 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.829
 wrong position 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.149
 another player now at least knows which 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.430
 i'm looking 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.799
 but what happens to the water barrel 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.200
 as you can see she is right in front 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.990
 me but it is not on the screen of the enemy 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.939
 maybe it will become visible if you try 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:19.140
 move it in order to update 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:21.950
 the physical model is not still just me 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.950
 I can see her 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:26.759
 when I compared the point of view of another 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.680
 player with mine 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.600
 noticed that a barrel of water in his case 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.110
 is in the original position on 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.329
 map 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.790
 if he decides to hide behind one of these 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.130
 barrels his model will be visible to me for a hundred 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:43.020
 percent at a time when he thinks that 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.759
 took cover well as you have already noticed 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.710
 the third player ran through the water 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.079
 barrels and this has changed them 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.880
 provisions how is it that I 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:54.020
 I see these barrels completely in others 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.810
 places compared to other players 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.340
 this happens because other players 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.530
 joined the server after 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.020
 I changed the position of the barrels on the map and 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.210
 new position of the object is updated to me 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.289
 only on clients of players who 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.910
 joined later 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.470
 we can assume that if we start 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.630
 round together all the objects will be 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.640
 synchronized correctly because 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.590
 our clients will receive information 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.080
 how do barrels move throughout 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.720
 round theoretically yes but let's 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.790
 check 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.950
 we are near the above mentioned barrels 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.650
 which are located on their starting 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.720
 positions at the start of the next round as 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.480
 see both players see a barrel in one and 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.610
 same place after the barrel was 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.769
 moved by the map it should 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:45.540
 appear on my screen right in front 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:50.100
 me but she is not from my point of view she 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:52.500
 is located to the right, even considering that 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.769
 barrels initially visible to both players 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.209
 were moved by one of the players 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:58.380
 the end result is different for each 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.450
 player on server 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.670
 this happens because the client 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.769
 performs physical simulations locally 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:09.030
 and does not sync with others 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:10.890
 customers for small objects who 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.400
 serve only for scenery this is not 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:16.829
 the problem is no need for them 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.930
 sync on all clients but for 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:21.180
 objects the size of a water barrel or 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.840
 tree which can be used as 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.269
 shelter 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.370
 this is a real problem since you 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:28.980
 sure that they are well hidden from the eyes 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.720
 the enemy but from his point of view the model 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:35.609
 your player clearly 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:38.069
 and so we got two lessons 1 

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:40.260
 if you want to remove a token from a player 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:42.120
 who doesn't move and shoots no 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.130
 believe the visual orientation of the model 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.620
 the enemy you see on your own 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.430
 the screens are more likely that he is watching 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.940
 your side 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.329
 when your screen shows the opposite 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.160
 second 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:55.230
 never hide behind objects 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.630
 who were part of the other destroyed 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.910
 objects such as trees or parts 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.440
 exploded technology or other 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.930
 objects that are exposed 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.880
 physical simulation some kind of barrel 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.190
 if you see yourself behind one of these 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:11.250
 objects this does not mean that other players 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:14.359
 on the server see you also thanks to all 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.359
 for your attention for now
