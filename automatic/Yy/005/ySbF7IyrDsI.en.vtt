00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.460
 This is probably one of my favorite chalk art pieces.

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.480
Sometimes I get a little carried away,

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.800
but if want to see a really cool fast forward version of this.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.180
Make sure you check me out on instagram (@RayPajar)

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:12.180
#TimeLapseThursday

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.740
or #TimeLapseTuesday is theres a bonus chalk art.

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:16.620
Starry Night, starry marble.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.200
Time lapse, check it out!!

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.780
Hey guys Ray Pajar from Get Crafty Crafty!!

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.620
and today I'm going to show you guys how to use

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.160
our left over nail polish

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:35.020
from our DIY water color mug project,

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:36.800
and us the same technique

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.800
 to create some water marbling,

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.500
to turn these flat glass marble pieces

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.770
into a cool little designed galaxy piece.

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.440
Not really sure what to call it,

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.620
but we're just going to be doing the same water marbling technique

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.890
to make it look like, we have this fun little galaxy

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.700
trapped inside this marble.

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.410
Let go ahead and get started with todays project!!

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.090
The items that you need for todays project include:

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100
a disposable bowl,
The items that you need for todays project include:

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.300
a disposable bowl,

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:04.120
toothpicks,

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.130
blue painters tape,

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:06.460
flat glass marbles,

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:07.940
I got these from Michaels,

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.280
Sharpie paint markers,

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.890
and assorted nail polish.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.520
First take your blue tape and cover up the sides of your glass marble.

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.740
You want to have the flat side of your marble still exposed.

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.040
Next take your silver Sharpie

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.170
and use it to draw little designs and patterns on the back of your marble.

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.100
For todays galaxy project I'm going to use this to draw a few

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.100
shooting stars

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.490
and a moon.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.180
You could also use your toothpick

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.180
to help make smaller details

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:40.640
on your design.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.530
After your silver sharpie has dried

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.620
you want to use your heavy glitter nail polish

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.490
to add a little bit of detail

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.490
to the back of your design.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.050
I'm only adding a small amount of

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.320
design here and there,

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.770
just because I don't want the glitter to be over bearing.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.600
As you could see in this one,

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.540
there was too much glitter and you really couldn't see any of the marbling we did later on.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.090
Set your marble aside and let it completely dry before moving on to the next step.

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.720
While your marble is drying,

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.920
take a bowl and fill it up with water.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.770
To create the water marble design

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.940
It's going to be a little different compared to our previous nail polish video.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.320
Instead of making a bunch of different designs

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.530
what you're going to do

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.880
is you're going to take you nail polish

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.570
and you're going to gently

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.060
add it to the top of your water

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.920
and the major difference between the previous project and this project

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:35.920
is instead of

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.680
putting them is different places

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.680
you're going to take you nail polish,

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:46.210
and you're going to gently place it right on top of the previous color.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.700
You have to be a little more careful compared to the other project.

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.580
Since you want to have it as one giant blob

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.900
and you want to use about 2 to 3 different colors.

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.600
We're using the same nail polish from our last project.

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.370
You'll notice as you do this the nail polish starts to spread out and thin.

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.680
You want to get these ripples going

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.460
so that you have a really cool design for your marble.

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.060
Take your toothpick and then just gently

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.000
swirl it around

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.320
and then just set that aside.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.900
Take your marble and

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:36.130
you're just going to dip it carefully into the design

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.930
catch it onto your marble

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.140
pull it out,

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.360
 and you notice you caught it onto

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.690
the back of the marble.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.800
You can continue to do this with the remaining design

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.480
or if you want to keep it simple,

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.480
just do this once.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.240
I'm going to repeat it one more time just to get a

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.620
a little bit more detail on this project.

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.320
After you've dipped your marble

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.400
gently remove the blue tape and pat it dry

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.400
carefully with a paper towel.

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:06.400
You want to make sure that it's completely dry

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:07.880
before moving onto the next step.

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.160
Once the back of your marble has dried

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.900
use either black or any other colored nail polish

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:14.900
to cover up the back of your marble.

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.880
You might end up using one to two coats

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.170
depending on how thick your nail polish dries up.

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.260
Once the nail polish has dried on the back

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.260
you are done with this project.

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.170
Hopefully you guys had fun making this project!!

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.850
If you have the attachment pieces

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.400
you could either turn it into a necklace or a ring

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.400
or you could leave it as is.

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.490
Depending on how you use your water marbling to

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:39.840
create the design

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.440
it could look anything like a small little galaxy

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:43.970
inside your marble

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.280
or it could look like a Starry Night

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.730
depending on what technique you actually end up using.

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.340
