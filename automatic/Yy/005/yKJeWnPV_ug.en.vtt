00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
I first received them so it's been a

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.720 
I first received them so it's been a
couple<00:00:28.289> of<00:00:28.410> months<00:00:28.619> now<00:00:28.920> that<00:00:28.949> I've<00:00:29.250> had<00:00:29.429> them

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
couple of months now that I've had them

and<00:00:29.970> honestly<00:00:30.599> at<00:00:30.779> first<00:00:30.990> I<00:00:31.260> was<00:00:31.470> hesitant<00:00:31.619> to

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
and honestly at first I was hesitant to

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.400 
and honestly at first I was hesitant to
even<00:00:32.189> make<00:00:32.520> this<00:00:32.669> video<00:00:33.000> because<00:00:33.270> I<00:00:33.480> just<00:00:33.570> felt

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
even make this video because I just felt

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.690 
even make this video because I just felt
like<00:00:34.440> it<00:00:34.620> was<00:00:34.710> really<00:00:34.920> unnecessary

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
like it was really unnecessary

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.010 
like it was really unnecessary
considering<00:00:36.180> how<00:00:36.270> many<00:00:36.329> questions<00:00:36.600> I<00:00:36.870> get

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020

about<00:00:37.050> them<00:00:37.469> lately<00:00:37.829> I<00:00:37.860> figured<00:00:38.399> let<00:00:39.270> me<00:00:39.360> just

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
about them lately I figured let me just

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.900 
about them lately I figured let me just
put<00:00:39.899> something<00:00:40.140> out<00:00:40.410> there<00:00:40.550> so<00:00:41.550> we<00:00:41.670> don't<00:00:41.850> have

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
put something out there so we don't have

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.900 
put something out there so we don't have
to<00:00:42.090> keep<00:00:42.329> answering<00:00:43.370> individual<00:00:44.370> questions

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
and these don't match at all they're not

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:24.880 
and these don't match at all they're not
even<00:01:17.520> close<00:01:17.610> but<00:01:19.070> I<00:01:20.070> was<00:01:20.729> wearing<00:01:21.240> them<00:01:21.659> for

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.030 

how<00:01:25.890> I<00:01:26.159> want<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.490> say<00:01:26.580> like<00:01:26.790> three<00:01:27.210> months

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 
how I want to say like three months

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.460 
how I want to say like three months
consistently<00:01:29.040> I<00:01:29.310> was<00:01:29.880> wearing<00:01:30.390> them<00:01:30.570> almost

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
consistently I was wearing them almost

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.630 
consistently I was wearing them almost
every<00:01:31.799> single<00:01:31.950> day<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:33.500> honestly<00:01:34.500> I<00:01:35.220> don't

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
every single day and honestly I don't

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.670 
every single day and honestly I don't
think<00:01:35.880> three<00:01:36.360> months<00:01:36.720> is<00:01:36.900> very<00:01:37.350> long

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
think three months is very long

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.580 
think three months is very long
especially<00:01:38.310> for<00:01:38.970> me<00:01:39.150> anyway<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:40.110> experience

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.020

different<00:03:07.459> at<00:03:08.060> all<00:03:08.269> from<00:03:08.840> when<00:03:08.989> I<00:03:09.019> first<00:03:09.290> got

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
different at all from when I first got

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.120 
different at all from when I first got
them<00:03:09.739> back<00:03:10.430> in<00:03:10.480> June<00:03:11.480> or<00:03:11.840> July<00:03:11.870> and<00:03:12.530> the<00:03:12.980> only

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
them back in June or July and the only

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.490 
them back in June or July and the only
reason<00:03:13.549> why<00:03:13.670> I<00:03:13.700> haven't<00:03:14.150> gotten<00:03:14.329> a<00:03:14.750> second<00:03:15.200> set

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
reason why I haven't gotten a second set

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.830 
reason why I haven't gotten a second set
of<00:03:15.530> them<00:03:15.950> to<00:03:16.910> match<00:03:17.120> my<00:03:17.329> current<00:03:17.359> hair<00:03:17.810> color

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
of them to match my current hair color

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.580 
of them to match my current hair color
it's<00:03:18.680> because<00:03:19.069> I<00:03:19.630> just<00:03:20.630> have<00:03:21.049> not<00:03:21.230> really<00:03:21.560> been

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
it's because I just have not really been

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.559 
it's because I just have not really been
feeling<00:03:22.040> like<00:03:22.459> super<00:03:22.819> super<00:03:23.299> long<00:03:23.510> hair

a possibility that you did get a bad set

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:10.180 
a possibility that you did get a bad set
um<00:04:04.910> I<00:04:06.250> I<00:04:07.250> guess<00:04:07.700> I<00:04:07.940> don't<00:04:08.030> know<00:04:08.560> but<00:04:09.560> more<00:04:10.010> than

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
um I I guess I don't know but more than

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:12.670 
um I I guess I don't know but more than
likely<00:04:10.459> I<00:04:10.730> think<00:04:11.359> you<00:04:12.049> might<00:04:12.319> just<00:04:12.470> not<00:04:12.650> be

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
likely I think you might just not be

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.069 
likely I think you might just not be
taking<00:04:13.130> care<00:04:13.340> of<00:04:13.370> them<00:04:13.730> properly<00:04:13.760> um<00:04:14.660> you<00:04:14.930> do

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:15.079 
taking care of them properly um you do

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:16.620 
taking care of them properly um you do
have<00:04:15.290> to<00:04:15.380> be<00:04:15.500> gentle<00:04:15.829> with<00:04:15.889> hair<00:04:16.070> extension

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
have to be gentle with hair extension

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.870 
have to be gentle with hair extension
obviously<00:04:17.170> if<00:04:17.320> you<00:04:17.410> just<00:04:17.590> let<00:04:18.400> them<00:04:18.610> lay

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
obviously if you just let them lay

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.210 
obviously if you just let them lay
around<00:04:19.030> and<00:04:19.750> you<00:04:20.050> aren't<00:04:20.290> brushing<00:04:20.770> them<00:04:20.920> the

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
around and you aren't brushing them the

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.670 
around and you aren't brushing them the
correct<00:04:21.490> way<00:04:21.900> they<00:04:22.900> could<00:04:23.170> get<00:04:23.320> tangles<00:04:23.650> that

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
correct way they could get tangles that

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.290 
correct way they could get tangles that
may<00:04:23.830> be<00:04:23.950> just<00:04:24.190> like<00:04:24.220> your<00:04:24.400> real<00:04:24.610> hair<00:04:24.880> what<00:04:25.120> you

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
may be just like your real hair what you

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.180 
may be just like your real hair what you
know<00:04:25.450> if<00:04:25.630> you're<00:04:25.780> not<00:04:25.900> taking<00:04:26.710> good<00:04:26.830> care<00:04:26.890> of

it
it's<00:04:28.330> gonna<00:04:28.780> get<00:04:29.050> kind<00:04:29.770> of<00:04:29.890> gross<00:04:30.490> and<00:04:30.850> not<00:04:30.970> be

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
it's gonna get kind of gross and not be

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.300 
it's gonna get kind of gross and not be
as<00:04:31.480> good<00:04:31.780> of<00:04:31.900> quality<00:04:32.110> if<00:04:32.650> you're<00:04:32.830> being

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
as good of quality if you're being

as good of quality if you're being
really<00:04:33.580> rough<00:04:33.790> when<00:04:33.940> you're<00:04:34.090> brushing<00:04:34.270> yet

really rough when you're brushing yet

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
obviously hairs are gonna come out and

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:37.920 
obviously hairs are gonna come out and
they're<00:04:36.520> gonna<00:04:36.610> thin<00:04:36.940> out<00:04:36.970> over<00:04:37.450> time<00:04:37.630> if

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
they're gonna thin out over time if

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.230 
they're gonna thin out over time if

you're washing them really frequently

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.970 
you're washing them really frequently
it's<00:04:40.810> gonna<00:04:41.080> shorten<00:04:41.380> the<00:04:41.530> life<00:04:41.680> of<00:04:41.860> the

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:41.980 
it's gonna shorten the life of the

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:45.450 
it's gonna shorten the life of the
extensions<00:04:42.550> so<00:04:42.910> I<00:04:43.150> am<00:04:43.570> planning<00:04:44.050> on<00:04:44.470> doing<00:04:44.770> a
