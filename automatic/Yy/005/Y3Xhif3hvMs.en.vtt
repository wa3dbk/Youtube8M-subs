dried<00:03:46.290> into<00:03:46.470> my<00:03:46.530> hand<00:03:46.710> but<00:03:46.860> i'm<00:03:46.950> just<00:03:47.100> going<00:03:47.220> to

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
dried into my hand but i'm just going to

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.560 
dried into my hand but i'm just going to
go<00:03:47.370> in<00:03:47.400> and<00:03:47.640> stipple<00:03:48.000> that<00:03:48.180> and<00:03:49.010> I<00:03:50.010> to<00:03:50.220> my<00:03:50.640> face

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
go in and stipple that and I to my face

00:03:51.570 --> 00:04:01.490 
go in and stipple that and I to my face
I<00:03:51.840> always<00:03:52.260> start<00:03:52.470> on<00:03:52.560> this<00:03:52.710> side<00:03:52.770> another<00:03:53.310> one

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.230 

I<00:04:01.620> think<00:04:02.190> it<00:04:02.280> has<00:04:02.340> kind<00:04:02.550> of<00:04:02.670> draw<00:04:02.820> it<00:04:02.880> up<00:04:03.000> in<00:04:03.150> my

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:03.240 
I think it has kind of draw it up in my

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.320 
I think it has kind of draw it up in my
own<00:04:03.270> so<00:04:04.260> next<00:04:05.100> time<00:04:05.370> you<00:04:05.640> want<00:04:06.060> to<00:04:06.120> try<00:04:06.270> this

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
own so next time you want to try this

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.390 
own so next time you want to try this
technique<00:04:06.690> don't<00:04:07.140> let<00:04:07.410> it<00:04:07.500> dry<00:04:07.680> in<00:04:08.130> your<00:04:08.250> hand

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.230 
good thing that I would say biome is one
of<00:04:10.560> my<00:04:10.620> prose<00:04:10.860> is<00:04:11.160> that<00:04:11.430> price<00:04:11.850> is<00:04:12.060> really

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:12.240

of my prose is that price is really
really<00:04:12.450> good<00:04:12.660> I<00:04:12.840> think<00:04:13.200> it's<00:04:13.350> like<00:04:13.530> it's

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:42.590 
this one this one's a little bit it's
medium<00:04:41.610> to<00:04:41.730> heavy<00:04:41.850> coverage<00:04:42.180> which<00:04:42.330> is<00:04:42.480> the

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
medium to heavy coverage which is the

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.780
