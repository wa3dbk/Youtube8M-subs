00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.929
 welcome at sea because the rooms 

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:15.969
 Love is born creativity I am face corral 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:17.890
 and today I'm going to show you how 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:20.770
 make these marks in the center of their 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:24.460
 towels then this is before putting together 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:27.100
 the pieces is right after putting him 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.560
 the absorbent part to the part that is going to 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:32.250
 go touching their skin can make them 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.930
 simply straight can do 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.430
 decorative can make them like in this 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.250
 case that I tried to make them like 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.739
 little hearts is your decision as 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.600
 they are going to mark them, they are simply 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:45.310
 lines in the center of the towel for 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.980
 to better guide the flow of your 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:50.920
 menstruation so that it does not get out of the 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.600
 towel well actually I did not do it to 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.579
 none of my towels this is a 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.050
 tutorial that I'm doing because I saw 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:59.809
 that some rules wanted it 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:02.120
 I do not feel the need to do it 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:04.460
 I had no problem with my towels without 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.580
 this then if you want to do some 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.710
 with them so they can try and 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.869
 let's see how it is done 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.630
 here the channel market that I'm going to 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:16.760
 use I was wrong in the bottom 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:20.500
 so let's ignore the last ray 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:22.330
 then I will use these channels 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.610
 drawn 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.580
 I have drawn them with a marker 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.500
 Crayon gel because this comes out very 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.780
 easily in the washing machine but of all 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.600
 ways this part is not going to see 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:38.410
 then I did as heart shapes 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:42.070
 is the most common is to make a streak 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:45.550
 or two straight stripes but as this is a 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:50.330
 towel that makes me look like a little 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:55.130
 boring I'll have it with veil 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:59.480
 gray or dark and then a little bit of 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:03.420
 silver on the outside I'm going to lighten a 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:05.780
 little bit with these shapes of hearts 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:09.060
 well here the coil thread is already 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:12.780
 ready to combine with the fabric of the 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:17.489
 outside then let's see that 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:22.920
 we also leave this I will place a 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:24.720
 straight tip in the center and more or less 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.520
 short I think I 'm going to have a 2 and 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.020
 half I remember that my machine has 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:32.960
 from 0 to 4 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:35.340
 in case you have doubts about how much to put 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.110
 your 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:41.510
 Y 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.510
 I'm going to start by stitching back 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.400
 for him 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:55.570
 Of course they can do it as I told them 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:55.570
 straight but good you know 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:01.709
 a good challenge 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.830
 and I'm going to give it to you 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:14.070
 and 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:17.030
 fast motion I'll give more play 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:19.770
 to the video so they do not have to see 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:23.480
 where will I go around 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.480
 tiny but 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.270
 I want to 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:33.240
 realize that it's not really 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:36.360
 so complicated if they make one more figure 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:40.660
 great that I'm realizing the 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:42.430
 truth would be a little easier 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.150
 but the point of this is so that 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.989
 you see we can see it 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.989
 something funny 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.110
 d 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.290
 do not 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.699
 Y 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:36.590
 good coincided that when I was finishing 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.590
 here the piece is over 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:42.910
 and what about the coil then I'll go back 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.910
 lets start 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.130
 the bottom part 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.840
 Now that we have reached the end, they are not 

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:19.840
 forget 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:30.490
 back and forward again then 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:30.490
 we can take out to cut our children 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:36.280
 we can talk about the stitch 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:38.560
 d 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:42.070
 and there it was 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:44.470
 I stay more in our channel 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:45.790
 right now it does not look very good but I'm going to 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:48.040
 to show 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:51.849
 here an approach 

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:54.310
 here we are in the approach 

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:58.660
 we can clearly see the 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:06:02.100
 forms of hearts and down I thought 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:04.940
 that was going to be noticed more because it's more 

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:07.550
 fluffy cloth 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:12.500
 but I do not have here another sample that 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:15.020
 I did that they have the channels marked 

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:18.830
 also this is simply what 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:21.260
 I did is that it was a channel guided through 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:25.010
 of a centimeter inside where I 

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:28.010
 I had made the original little bank say 

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:29.630
 some women that this helps them in 

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:33.710
 special the channels that go in the 

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:35.990
 center that this helps them stay 

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:40.190
 here it is better absorbed in the part of the 

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:42.590
 center so it's like guiding the blood 

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:43.970
 then your registration is now 

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:47.200
 they want to do as you saw in 

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:50.990
 all the samples that the video show 

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:54.500
 in the first video of the car with 

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:59.330
 I really did not feel the need 

00:06:54.500 --> 00:07:01.470
 to make these little pipes but it remains and 

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:03.210
 description of you 

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:04.920
 I hope you liked this 

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:07.110
 tutorial to see how simple it is 

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:10.470
 it is simply to put a step 

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:12.960
 additional to what we are already doing 

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:14.730
 if you liked this video as much as they 

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:16.430
 do them please follow us in the others 

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:18.990
 social networks follow me on Instagram 

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:21.780
 wrapped up in love so they can see 

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:23.550
 everything I do everything I go 

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:24.090
 doing that maybe I still do not upload 

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:26.670
 the blog 

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:28.860
 sometimes I ask opinions about what is it 

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:30.780
 that we should add in some of 

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:33.600
 the projects then I hope that I 

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:36.780
 still out there also enter the first 

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:39.540
 video of this series of things with each 

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:42.690
 menstrual authors and see how low 

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:45.450
 there is still a draw for them to win 

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:48.150
 five towels of which I did that 

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:50.940
 they were new and with free shipping to 

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:52.710
 mexico or usa and if you want to participate in 

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:54.810
 another country can gladly 

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:56.640
 only participate that the shipment 

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:59.490
 he would run on his own 

00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:01.230
 then participate see also that 

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:03.540
 they can earn the towel pattern 

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:07.610
 menstrual in this same 

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:07.610
 See you later
