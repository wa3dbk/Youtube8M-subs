00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:23.740
 completely obsessed because it was not 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:26.140
 able to take out this maximum challenge 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.910
 is that I have this streak of 25 without dying 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.470

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.210

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.890

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.230

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:58.750
 they took out this 25- pound streak with the weapon without 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.390
 die 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.880

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.160

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:09.070

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.910
 minutes but you know me no 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.450

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.010

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.680

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.640
 of the fastest I've seen so 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.690
 now without counting what some do 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.690
 Americans out there that are 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:33.310
 exaggeratedly good and they are always the 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.020
 first to do everything but good the 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.660
 In the case of kids that finally took me out 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.490

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:42.369

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.920
 future advised to you of how 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:52.840
 remove them also the first advice that 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.119
 I can give you that is an advice that I have 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.940

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:03.420
 We are a new call of duty and kids 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:05.490
 nobody knows anything we're all 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.039
 seeing what is happening watching and 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.470
 knowing and trying to learn how 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.780
 this game works then the first 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.959
 advice that I can give you to get out 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:18.120

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.310
 Once you die in jazz was assembled that 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.100
 they call the same every time you die 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.319
 where he responded was to look at what flags 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.989
 you have what flags the enemy has and 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:30.090
 Always look where you answer eyes because 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:31.980
 that way you are able to know where 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.750
 answer the enemy if they can do you 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.610
 behind a do in front what 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.430
 possibilities there are that people and 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.680
