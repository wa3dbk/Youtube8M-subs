00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:16.510
 Intertek is the leading company in 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.690
 Control inspection services 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.750
 audits 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:24.610
 product certification analysis and 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.610
 food safety programs 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:30.030
 for this, it has state- of-the-art technology 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.880
 thus ensuring that your products and 

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:35.990
 services meet the requirements of 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.990
 quality established 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:45.210
 all the staff or visitor of intertek 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.520
 must use the mandatory 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.210
 biosecurity clothing that 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.210
 consists in 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.870
 white apron in good condition 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.870
 cleaning and conservation 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.680
 hair protector or touches 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.650
 nasal masks or mouth guard 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.650
 disposable 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:19.260
 first- use disposable gloves 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:23.100
 now if we can enter the 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:26.930
 laboratories today we will know the service 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.930
 of agri laboratory 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.810
 received the service request by 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:43.049
 part of the certifications area either 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.780
 via email or email 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:48.540
 laboratory supervisor derives the 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.520
 request to the analyst and the assistants 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.570
 for the preparation of the media 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.810
 requested 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:58.549
 previously the laboratory supervisor 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:01.909
 coordinates with the operations area 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:05.659
 agree the amount of material that is going 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:09.470
 to need all this material that is 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:12.500
 prepares is for taking samples of 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:15.650
 food also for surfaces and 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:18.500
 also for environments within this 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:22.459
 material we have for example material of 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:24.849
 glass for sampling is 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:29.480
 they use metallic structures like 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:33.019
 scoops spatulas or forks this is 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:36.459
 Steam sterilized fluently at 121 degrees 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:36.459
 centigrade for 15 minutes 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.920
 for taking samples they are going to 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:44.680
 require plastic or tupper containers 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.920
 plastics which are sterilized with 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:52.270
 ultraviolet radiation these is by 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:54.460
 exposure for a time of 15 minutes 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.319
 the plastic bags that are used 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:58.540
 to cover 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:01.230
 or tightly wrap the 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.540
 Plastic containers 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.989
 and those used to perform the test 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:10.850
 of washing hands are washed and rinsed 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:13.440
 with brain brain broth 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:16.710
 subsequently the interior of 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.680
 the bag with this culture medium is 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:21.660
 closes and is placed on a stove 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:24.240
 applying an incubation to a 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:27.480
 temperature of 35 degrees centigrade 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:28.850
 approximately for a time of 24 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.730
 hours 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:34.460
 after this period of time they are taken out 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.110
 the bags and they are observed if there are any 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:39.650
 turbidity 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:42.830
 if this turbidity did not exist, they are released 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:45.200
 the matte roll bags to be 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:47.890
 already used in the final sampling of 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.890
 the food 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:53.410
 for the case of surfaces is used 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:56.920
 a sponge is covered with paper 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:04:00.459
 kraft and then sterilized at 121 degrees 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:02.800
 for 15 minutes and finally sterilized 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:07.390
 All the material requested for the 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:11.680
 service is stored is deposited in about 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:13.569
 thermal cooler is already transported to 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.230
 where you are going to carry out the 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:16.230
 taking samples 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:39.500
 intertek inspectors arrive at 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:41.720
 place of service and quickly 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:44.480
 presented to the store technologist 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:47.660
 and communicates to those responsible for this 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:49.940
 to proceed formally the start of the 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:53.360
 microbiological sampling service 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:56.290
 food surfaces and monitoring 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.290
 environment 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:01.110
 the containers arrive completely 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.070
 protected and free of agents 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:06.130
 contaminants 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:08.740
 we proceed to the opening of each of 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:11.180
 them with extreme care for making 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:15.370
 each sample 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.370
 It starts with the utensils 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:30.680
 then continue with meals 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:30.680
 prepared meat fish and others 

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:38.030
 Sampling is also carried out 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:40.669
 of inert surfaces and also 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:44.560
 living surfaces like the hands of 

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:44.560
 manipulators from different areas 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:54.590
 For each sampling , a 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:57.030
 new pair of surgical gloves 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:59.340
 thus avoiding contamination of the 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:01.949
 same 

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:05.100
 when taking the samples you take the 

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:07.710
 product temperature of the environment or 

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:09.710
 showcase and note the temperature and the 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:12.000
 complete data of those samples 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:14.330
 including supplies for products 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.330
 final 

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:20.770
 this procedure obliges to respect the 

00:06:18.039 --> 00:06:23.110
 Sampling conditions indicated 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:25.570
 in the listing 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:27.610
 the environment is monitored in each 

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:30.280
 place and products are extracted 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:33.300
 belonging to sections chosen as 

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:37.170
 the meat sausage areas fish 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:37.170
 and confectionery 

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:43.410
 The samples are placed 

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:46.170
 carefully inside the boxes 

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:49.650
 thermal sensors with refrigerants 

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:52.350
 as synthetic ice to maintain 

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:55.740
 the interior at a lower temperature or 

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:58.110
 equal to 10 degrees centigrade 

00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:00.060
 this thermal box is placed 

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:03.120
 temporarily in a camera 

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:06.560
 refrigeration until its withdrawal at the moment 

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:09.620
 of the culmination of the service 

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:11.810
 finished these tasks proceed to 

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:14.060
 write the report or sampling act 

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:17.660
 which will be signed by the boss or the 

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:20.120
 shop technologist with this report he 

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:21.830
 directs to merchandise reception and is 

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:24.260
 delivery to the manager so that this 

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:28.150
 proceed in time to download the 

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:28.150
 physical products from your inventory 

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:33.009
