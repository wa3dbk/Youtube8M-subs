 roman that a lettuce between more or less 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.010
 let's say between bitter but one more point 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.050
 sweet than the others and this one we're going to 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.550
 mix when mixed in the kitchen 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.360
 We know her as a month 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.829
 club ok ok perfect we got here a 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.949
 we're going to bind all of them because 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.379
 ok escarole lettuce does not have one 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.760
 little bit of dickey because it's because the 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.190
 ra dickey a radicó is to give it color 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.370
 eye candy 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:12.770
 the showiness at the beginning when the 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.900
 person will come to the table and be 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.960
 serves as the salad the people 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:20.180
 really we all beings 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.820
 humans eat by sight also jon 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.950
 and it is also important to wash the 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.970
 milk 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:30.050
 comes in the kitchen with taking care of the health 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.900
 important for all lettuces 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.250
 come and pre wash with water and vinegar or 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.810
 Frei then they become hydra too 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.030
 water and they stay there totally 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.330
 clean that yeah well here we go to 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.650
 Mix all the lettuces ok 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:48.070

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:53.790
 We are going to present it on the plate 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:53.790
 ok to give height to the plate as such 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.010
 and 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:03.990

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.240
 dressing that we are going to place we have here 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.420
 a yellow egg ok does not clarify 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:12.270
 a yellow egg we have here can 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.640
 be a two tablespoons of honey ok and a 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.500
 mustard touch in my personal case 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.530
 and I use dijon mustard which is a mustard 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.520
 totally not so bitter is not so 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.410
 powerful its flavor 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.910
 ok we can be very careful about 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.100
 everything with that ok 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:31.340
 here we are going to mix a little bit of 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:33.750
 of the small dijon mustard spoon 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:37.560
 challenge 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:39.990
 and let's add the honey ok 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.390
 all the honey that can be added rich 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:44.610
 if it's a dressing that because I add it 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.810
 honey honey especially to take away a 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:51.330
 little the bitter taste that have the 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:54.680
 mustard and we started to mix all this 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.680
 preparation ok 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:00.670

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.200
 a candy as if it were making a 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.450
 ordinary candy as a 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.340
 candy to do this is that if I what 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.709
 well so power add water add the 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:33.280

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:35.440
 once said that this was milky in 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:39.310
 a cheat is that was because the question is 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:42.280
 that create that when starting that as 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:44.080
 I tell you here is uncertainty that the 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.180
 securities this be that because 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.670

 simple easy to do at home 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:01.890
 as such 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.680

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:10.230
 the dressing is placed by the part 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:12.420
 above the delicious besides the 

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:15.090
 you're preparing and presenting if you go 

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:16.770
 is that the idea is that I'm going to win 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:17.760
 time the time the phone is very 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:20.190
 short 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.850
 ok but it 's an easy little dish 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:22.320
 do 

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:26.479
 we can place a little more will come 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:29.220
 by the sides and more like ok 

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:31.440
 you can also put carrot what 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:34.370
 you like or what to like to observe 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:36.979
 a simple salad very easy 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:39.080
 let's say it more expensive than that temptation 

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:40.699
 but if I calculate as 200 grams of 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.949
 lift is enough for a plate 

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:45.440
 for a trade besides that people 

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:48.139
 at home in this case that today they want 

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:50.150
 make is salad and do not get the cheese 

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:52.010
 temptation can also be done to 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:57.340
 Llaneras with a bit of it 

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:57.340
 gender or also how will I use side I'm 

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:04.850
 rich is that the question is not only 

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:06.740
 the cheese can play with the cheese that 

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:07.669
 it can be any type of cheese that 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:11.030
 get on hand at the moment 

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:13.520
 wonderful you have to be very creative in 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:15.229
 the kitchen and the kitchen is how you have 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:18.620
 said several chefs that form 

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:21.080
 teachers that is one is an art the 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:23.539

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:26.419
 salad I used for a delicious dinner 

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:28.610
 and if served in a small portion it could be 

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:30.919
 an entrance preferably an entrance 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:32.360
 I would do it in my personal case I would 

00:06:30.919 --> 00:06:34.070
 would like the case in an entry like 

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:36.919

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:38.930

00:06:36.919 --> 00:06:40.729
 little thing they prepare their salad and they 

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:42.080
 they can eat at the moment 

00:06:40.729 --> 00:06:44.360
