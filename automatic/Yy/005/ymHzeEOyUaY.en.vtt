i<00:01:29.850> think<00:01:30.229> looking<00:01:31.229> at<00:01:31.350> reference<00:01:31.710> pictures

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
i think looking at reference pictures

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.280 
i think looking at reference pictures
and<00:01:32.280> videos<00:01:32.579> on<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.939> web<00:01:33.090> that<00:01:33.780> do<00:01:33.960> appear<00:01:34.259> to

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
and videos on the web that do appear to

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.990 
and videos on the web that do appear to
be<00:01:34.560> quite<00:01:35.040> a<00:01:35.130> lot<00:01:35.310> of<00:01:35.400> different<00:01:35.790> color

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
be quite a lot of different color

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.760 
be quite a lot of different color
schemes<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:36.540> different<00:01:36.869> variations<00:01:37.049> of<00:01:37.650> the

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
schemes and different variations of the

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.160 
schemes and different variations of the
base<00:01:37.950> color<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.520> but<00:01:39.299> this<00:01:39.420> looks<00:01:39.720> as<00:01:39.869> close

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
base color and but this looks as close

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.620 
base color and but this looks as close
to<00:01:40.380> sort<00:01:40.560> of<00:01:40.650> Sinai<00:01:41.189> desert<00:01:41.579> gray<00:01:42.150> as<00:01:42.210> I<00:01:42.450> can

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
to sort of Sinai desert gray as I can

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.889 
to sort of Sinai desert gray as I can
get<00:01:42.840> it<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:43.439> I've<00:01:44.250> also<00:01:44.490> heard<00:01:44.939> I'm<00:01:45.600> yet<00:01:45.869> to

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
get it and I've also heard I'm yet to

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.670 
get it and I've also heard I'm yet to
try<00:01:46.290> it<00:01:46.350> myself<00:01:46.610> but<00:01:47.610> I<00:01:47.640> believe<00:01:48.090> that<00:01:48.570> a<00:01:48.930> mix

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
try it myself but I believe that a mix

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:56.899 
try it myself but I believe that a mix
of<00:01:50.689> XF<00:01:51.689> 57<00:01:52.470> both<00:01:53.270> 50%<00:01:54.270> -<00:01:54.689> 50<00:01:54.899> %<00:01:55.439> xf<00:01:55.950> 49<00:01:56.549> works

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
of XF 57 both 50% - 50 % xf 49 works

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.780 
of XF 57 both 50% - 50 % xf 49 works
really<00:01:57.210> well<00:01:57.420> as<00:01:57.600> well<00:01:58.280> what<00:01:59.280> I'm<00:01:59.399> hoping<00:01:59.549> for

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
really well as well what I'm hoping for

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.609 
really well as well what I'm hoping for
is<00:02:00.000> is<00:02:00.329> is<00:02:00.570> somebody<00:02:00.960> can<00:02:01.200> give<00:02:01.380> me<00:02:01.439> some

is is is somebody can give me some
advice<00:02:01.680> though<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:02.570> basically<00:02:03.570> I'm<00:02:04.079> happy

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
advice though and basically I'm happy

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.100 
advice though and basically I'm happy
with<00:02:04.530> this<00:02:04.680> color<00:02:04.979> on<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.549> modern<00:02:05.939> stuff<00:02:06.270> but

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
with this color on the modern stuff but

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.979 
with this color on the modern stuff but
I've<00:02:07.290> noticed<00:02:07.530> that<00:02:07.799> a<00:02:07.920> lot<00:02:08.099> of<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.280> older

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
I've noticed that a lot of the older

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:10.699 
I've noticed that a lot of the older
vehicles<00:02:09.989> and<00:02:10.110> certainly<00:02:10.379> some<00:02:10.590> of<00:02:10.619> the

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
vehicles and certainly some of the

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.860 
vehicles and certainly some of the
mercury<00:02:11.069> as<00:02:11.220> well<00:02:11.489> they're<00:02:12.030> doing<00:02:12.180> it

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
mercury as well they're doing it

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.050 
mercury as well they're doing it
more<00:02:13.080> green<00:02:13.470> than<00:02:13.799> gray<00:02:14.099> I'm<00:02:14.670> thinking

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
more green than gray I'm thinking

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.180 
more green than gray I'm thinking
particularly<00:02:15.480> of<00:02:15.659> my<00:02:15.870> next<00:02:16.200> project<00:02:16.650> which<00:02:16.890> is

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
particularly of my next project which is

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.410 
particularly of my next project which is
the<00:02:18.120> Tehran<00:02:19.019> five<00:02:19.549> and<00:02:20.549> certainly<00:02:21.000> looking<00:02:21.269> at

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
the Tehran five and certainly looking at

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.570 
the Tehran five and certainly looking at
reference<00:02:21.840> shots<00:02:22.110> as<00:02:22.980> you<00:02:23.040> can<00:02:23.250> see<00:02:23.400> probably

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
reference shots as you can see probably

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.850 
reference shots as you can see probably
from<00:02:23.849> the<00:02:23.940> box<00:02:24.180> art<00:02:24.480> it<00:02:24.959> is<00:02:25.290> sort<00:02:25.590> of<00:02:25.620> more<00:02:25.830> a

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
from the box art it is sort of more a

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.759 
from the box art it is sort of more a
green<00:02:26.340> than<00:02:26.940> a<00:02:26.970> gray<00:02:27.299> and<00:02:28.049> certainly<00:02:28.409> not<00:02:28.709> a

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
green than a gray and certainly not a

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.670 
green than a gray and certainly not a
desert<00:02:29.069> sandy<00:02:29.849> killer<00:02:30.200> so<00:02:31.200> he's<00:02:31.470> got<00:02:31.590> any

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
desert sandy killer so he's got any

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.130 
desert sandy killer so he's got any
suggestions<00:02:32.159> or<00:02:32.250> advice<00:02:32.310> on<00:02:32.909> the<00:02:33.659> best<00:02:33.690> color

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
suggestions or advice on the best color

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.080 
suggestions or advice on the best color
scheme<00:02:34.440> today<00:02:34.620> this<00:02:34.890> in<00:02:35.159> or<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.459> best<00:02:35.670> mix<00:02:35.940> of

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
scheme today this in or the best mix of

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.640 
scheme today this in or the best mix of
paints<00:02:36.480> then<00:02:36.720> I'd<00:02:36.840> be<00:02:36.959> really<00:02:37.409> really

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
paints then I'd be really really

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.309 
paints then I'd be really really
grateful<00:02:38.420> hoping<00:02:39.420> to<00:02:39.540> go<00:02:39.690> for<00:02:39.900> something<00:02:40.260> a

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
grateful hoping to go for something a

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:44.390 
grateful hoping to go for something a
bit<00:02:40.349> more<00:02:40.579> green<00:02:41.579> than<00:02:41.849> gray<00:02:42.379> but<00:02:43.379> not<00:02:43.860> really

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
bit more green than gray but not really

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.880 
bit more green than gray but not really
not<00:02:44.940> too<00:02:45.180> dark<00:02:45.510> I<00:02:45.840> think<00:02:46.290> it<00:02:46.530> needs<00:02:46.739> to<00:02:46.829> be

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
not too dark I think it needs to be

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.660 
not too dark I think it needs to be
pretty<00:02:47.129> faded<00:02:47.459> down<00:02:47.819> as<00:02:48.090> well<00:02:48.650> and<00:02:49.670> hopefully

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
pretty faded down as well and hopefully

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.059 
pretty faded down as well and hopefully
