00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:06.050 
take that as a bad as a negative not at
all<00:03:02.970> of<00:03:03.180> us<00:03:03.359> but<00:03:04.019> there's<00:03:04.260> a<00:03:04.379> plus<00:03:04.680> I<00:03:05.040> see<00:03:05.760> it<00:03:05.939> as

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
all of us but there's a plus I see it as

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.229 
all of us but there's a plus I see it as
a<00:03:06.120> pure<00:03:06.750> form<00:03:07.200> of<00:03:07.409> art<00:03:07.739> of<00:03:08.099> self<00:03:09.060> expression

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
a pure form of art of self expression

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:12.199 
a pure form of art of self expression
and<00:03:10.049> and<00:03:10.319> this<00:03:10.769> particular<00:03:11.099> examples<00:03:12.090> I<00:03:12.180> gave

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
and and this particular examples I gave

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.559 
and and this particular examples I gave
you<00:03:12.569> to<00:03:12.870> me<00:03:12.900> these<00:03:13.440> pieces<00:03:13.970> scream<00:03:14.970> happy

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569

happy unless you're a pretty pepper so

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.039 
happy unless you're a pretty pepper so
here's<00:03:18.959> my<00:03:19.049> theory<00:03:19.729> we<00:03:20.729> give<00:03:20.940> colors<00:03:21.389> Emilian

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
here's my theory we give colors Emilian

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:24.979 
here's my theory we give colors Emilian
right<00:03:22.260> without<00:03:23.129> really<00:03:23.609> thinking<00:03:24.030> about<00:03:24.449> it<00:03:24.810> I

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
right without really thinking about it I

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:28.189 
right without really thinking about it I
know<00:03:25.139> and<00:03:25.590> it<00:03:26.430> makes<00:03:26.879> a<00:03:27.150> very<00:03:27.180> you<00:03:27.870> know<00:03:27.900> from

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:28.199 
know and it makes a very you know from

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:32.569 
know and it makes a very you know from
culture<00:03:28.829> to<00:03:28.859> culture<00:03:29.040> and<00:03:30.319> time<00:03:31.319> and<00:03:32.069> arrive

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579 
culture to culture and time and arrive

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:36.099 
culture to culture and time and arrive
name<00:03:33.209> it<00:03:33.389> but<00:03:33.989> overall<00:03:34.470> you<00:03:35.010> know<00:03:35.069> the<00:03:35.220> idea

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:36.109 
name it but overall you know the idea

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:40.059 
name it but overall you know the idea
that<00:03:37.109> we<00:03:37.709> see<00:03:38.040> red<00:03:38.340> and<00:03:38.639> we<00:03:38.819> think<00:03:39.150> of<00:03:39.299> love<00:03:39.629> or

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:40.069 
that we see red and we think of love or

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:44.300 
that we see red and we think of love or
excitement<00:03:41.239> but<00:03:42.239> with<00:03:42.479> see<00:03:43.169> yellow<00:03:43.680> and<00:03:44.010> we

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
excitement but with see yellow and we

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.349 
excitement but with see yellow and we
think<00:03:44.579> of<00:03:44.849> happy<00:03:45.359> or<00:03:45.930> you<00:03:45.989> and<00:03:46.470> we<00:03:46.650> think<00:03:46.979> of

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:47.359 
think of happy or you and we think of

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:51.349 
think of happy or you and we think of
water<00:03:48.359> clouds<00:03:49.049> or<00:03:49.620> the<00:03:49.949> ocean<00:03:50.459> is<00:03:50.879> that<00:03:51.120> just

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:51.359 
water clouds or the ocean is that just

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:52.970 
water clouds or the ocean is that just
because<00:03:51.419> I<00:03:52.199> don't<00:03:52.709> think

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
because I don't think

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.360 
because I don't think
so<00:03:53.129> so<00:03:54.120> my<00:03:54.330> point<00:03:54.540> is<00:03:54.810> that<00:03:55.050> this<00:03:55.470> type<00:03:55.860> of<00:03:55.890> art

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
so so my point is that this type of art

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.899 
so so my point is that this type of art
works<00:03:57.090> because<00:03:57.750> it<00:03:58.409> connects<00:03:58.860> without<00:03:59.610> some

00:03:59.899 --> 00:03:59.909 
works because it connects without some

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:05.809 
works because it connects without some
one<00:04:00.720> is<00:04:00.900> that<00:04:01.110> other<00:04:01.769> art<00:04:02.450> cans<00:04:04.220> exam<00:04:05.220> it's

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 
one is that other art cans exam it's

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:10.070 
one is that other art cans exam it's
