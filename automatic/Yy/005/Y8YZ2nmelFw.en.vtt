00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:41.610 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.659 

I'm<00:05:42.610> using<00:05:42.909> that<00:05:43.059> in<00:05:43.419> a<00:05:43.479> string<00:05:43.929> and<00:05:44.489> this<00:05:45.489> high

I'm using that in a string and this high

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:47.669 
I'm using that in a string and this high
strength<00:05:46.059> and<00:05:46.239> these<00:05:46.329> low<00:05:46.509> strings<00:05:46.809> muting

strength and these low strings muting

00:05:47.679 --> 00:05:48.719 
strength and these low strings muting
them<00:05:47.769> because<00:05:47.919> I<00:05:47.949> don't<00:05:48.189> want<00:05:48.249> them<00:05:48.429> to<00:05:48.519> ring

00:05:48.729 --> 00:06:01.139 
them because I don't want them to ring
out<00:05:56.909> same<00:05:57.909> as<00:05:59.339> can<00:06:00.339> see<00:06:00.519> how<00:06:00.639> that's<00:06:00.849> the

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:01.149 
out same as can see how that's the

00:06:01.149 --> 00:06:03.119 
out same as can see how that's the
equivalent<00:06:01.389> but<00:06:01.989> just<00:06:02.199> in<00:06:02.349> different<00:06:02.619> set<00:06:03.039> of

00:06:03.119 --> 00:06:03.129 
equivalent but just in different set of

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:27.810 
equivalent but just in different set of
strings<00:06:03.399> a<00:06:03.639> different<00:06:03.999> version<00:06:04.360> of<00:06:04.599> the<00:06:04.689> cord

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:27.820 

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:31.500 

I<00:06:28.440> cool<00:06:29.440> thing<00:06:29.620> to<00:06:29.650> do<00:06:29.830> is<00:06:29.980> combine<00:06:30.190> these<00:06:31.150> two

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:31.510 
I cool thing to do is combine these two

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:34.380 
I cool thing to do is combine these two
voicings<00:06:32.380> together<00:06:32.830> so<00:06:33.490> for<00:06:34.060> instance<00:06:34.090> i

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:34.390 
voicings together so for instance i

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:35.880 
voicings together so for instance i
might<00:06:34.540> start<00:06:34.840> off<00:06:35.020> using<00:06:35.320> the<00:06:35.560> first

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:35.890 
might start off using the first

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:38.520 
might start off using the first
variation<00:06:36.310> on<00:06:36.670> the<00:06:36.940> a<00:06:37.180> and<00:06:37.870> when<00:06:38.020> i<00:06:38.050> go<00:06:38.200> to<00:06:38.230> a<00:06:38.350> d

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:38.530 
variation on the a and when i go to a d

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:41.100 
variation on the a and when i go to a d
I<00:06:38.830> might<00:06:39.280> use<00:06:39.460> the<00:06:39.580> second<00:06:40.000> variation<00:06:40.300> and

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:41.110 
I might use the second variation and

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:43.140 
I might use the second variation and
you'll<00:06:41.650> see<00:06:41.890> why<00:06:42.070> but<00:06:42.280> this<00:06:42.400> allows<00:06:42.880> me<00:06:42.910> to

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:43.150 
you'll see why but this allows me to

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:44.910 
you'll see why but this allows me to
stay<00:06:43.390> in<00:06:43.630> the<00:06:43.750> same<00:06:43.960> position<00:06:44.470> roughly<00:06:44.830> in<00:06:44.890> the

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:44.920 
stay in the same position roughly in the

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.260 
stay in the same position roughly in the
guitar<00:06:45.100> neck<00:06:45.310> I<00:06:45.550> don't<00:06:45.760> have<00:06:45.850> to<00:06:45.940> run<00:06:46.150> around

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:46.270 
guitar neck I don't have to run around

00:06:46.270 --> 00:07:07.800 
guitar neck I don't have to run around
so<00:06:46.720> much<00:06:46.870> all<00:06:47.260> over<00:06:47.320> the<00:06:47.710> place<00:06:47.920> check<00:06:48.730> it<00:06:48.850> out
