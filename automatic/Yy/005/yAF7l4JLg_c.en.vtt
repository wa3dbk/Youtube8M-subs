00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.369

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.740
 security at the front of the war with igil 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.890
 without protection just no bag 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.079

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.559
 turning on mosul on i think we 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.530
 will be able to advance kilometers on 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.899
 twenty and heading to the front line point 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.070
 of our destination, our city has makhanul 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.960
 fellow travelers whole branch of machine gunners 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.390
 on the left side of the refinery 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:56.030
 the plant the other day near its gate occurred 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.030
 an explosion here they thunder daily 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.920
 war here it is already very close seems 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:08.040
 anti-aircraft installation at roadblocks almost 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.040
 don't check and here's an unexpected stop 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.000
 our guards pray and arrange 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.050
 halt right in the temple 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.950
 we were let straight into the mosque this one 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.370
 elder for which he thanks a lot 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.960
 the fact is that in the afternoon here 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:26.940
 unbearable heat sometimes needs to be done 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:29.670
 such are the pauses and here we are 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:32.950
 stronghold of the Iraqi Kurdistan army 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.410
 these warriors call themselves peshmerga something 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.840
 like our territorial defense forces 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:40.119
 they are designed to protect the Kursk autonomy 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.180
 from the invasion of the Icelandic mercenaries 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:44.830
 the states we did not believe would come 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.869
 war when four years ago it 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.390
 started in neighboring syria it seemed that 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:52.360
 it is somewhere far but now our dying 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:55.410
 brothers and sisters and we are forced to protect 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:58.259
 his native land and the river 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:02.590
 later cold here already unsafe 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:04.930
 snipers work are traces of bullets and to 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.060
 I tried to get but armored 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.100
 the glass weathered 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.200
 technique american but weapon to pain 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.930
 familiar 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:17.430
 Hammer army of Iraqi Kurdistan we 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:20.140
 we see it is equipped with a Diskek machine gun 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:23.019
 such machine guns are used in 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:25.950
 including the Ukrainian army and 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:28.800
 Hummers we have similar 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.989
 but the tactics of fighting are noticeable 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.840
 differ in that which applies to 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.530
 Ukraine horde or and tank battles for 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.510
 these places 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.069
 great rarity main weapon 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.010
 terrorist attacks 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:44.130
 we go to the front line 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.530
 from here to the positions of igil militants 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:50.099
 it remains 9 kilometers and now on 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:52.590
 try to overcome them we are not afraid 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:57.450
 their is our land and we need it 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:03:01.530
 protect be unsafe yesterday 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:03.540

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.670

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.410
 same hummer but succeeded 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.400
 eliminate in just a few 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.170
 meters before the collision an explosion occurred 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.400
 parts all 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:18.380
 Levan who survived dozens 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:21.260
 I don't like something there is some smoke 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.420
 let's take the right for our loyalty 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.330
 the driver is wearing a hard hat is accelerating and 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.390
 changing the route ahead the hardest it 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.470
