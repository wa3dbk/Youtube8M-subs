00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.250
 device with version 8.1 in this 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.900
 case I will use my iphone 6 but 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.960
 this method works for any ipad 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.490
 ipod or iphone running a version 8.1 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.930
 before starting, you can mention the 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.910
 best three reasons to do the 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.580
 jailbreak 1 you can customize your 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.869
 iphone to any style you want 200 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.880
 of new functions and applications 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:33.650
 will be available and number 3 you can 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.420
 download any application I decided 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.800
 not only from the app store before 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.750
 do the jailbreak we must prepare 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.850
 our device there are four things that 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.710
 we must do first make sure 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.720
 disable any auto password 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.610
 side and second in the settings of your 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.680
 iphone make sure you unplug icloud and 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.540
 find my iphone third active in mode 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.920
 plane and finally we will make a copy of 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.480
 security to make a copy of 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.520
 security only open itunes and do 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.140
 click where it says in Baku or make a copy 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.790
 of security this is simply because 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.010
 security to have a copy of all the 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.809

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:26.450
