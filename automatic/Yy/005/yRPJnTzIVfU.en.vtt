00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:17.880
 the clear 20 fast mirror does not make for 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:20.609
 you 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.130
 then don't write love poems right away 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.989
 they are the most difficult waiting for them 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.680
 at least eighty years and write about 

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:30.960
 a topic that usually the sea the 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.809
 wind a radiator and for those who arise 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.010
 a tram the delay here that does not exist 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.010
 a more poetic theme 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:43.030
 you understand the poetry is not outside and you 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.640
 what poetry is, don't ask me again 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:48.339
 look in the mirror at the poem yes and 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.850
 manage the beautiful poems look well 

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:50.760
 words 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.410
 you have to choose 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.469
 sometimes it takes 8 months to find 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.539
 a word that beauty has begun 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.000
 when someone is going to choose 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.440
 the corpse but you know it but how much it has 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.539
 put before choosing the leaf of 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.309
 fig company mixed this with this one 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:09.140
 this is not looking at me here 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.140
 all the children but the vision stops 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.920
 you owe yourself love 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:21.060
 everything becomes alive everything moves away 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:23.189
 joy and joy be sad and 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.510
 been shifts with hope but of 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.710
 blow the slaughterhouse 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.710
 nothing you see 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.100
 this is what you have to do 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.150
 to convey happiness it is necessary 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.790
 be happy 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.920
 and this stop where you need to be 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:45.800
 happy 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:48.050
 be happy I had to and feel bad 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.930
 suffer nonostate buskers offer everything 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:53.240
 the world suffers and if they don't leave me 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.190
 see the media don't worry so much 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.090
 to make poetry only one necessary thing 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.090
 all 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.590
 you got it right I looked for the news 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.060
 the novelty is the most beautiful thing there is and 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.080
 he is lost envy him by this 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:11.350
 position from this is so 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.350
 put yourself like that 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.190
 the same even of the sky but not the 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.830
 beauty because I was promised near 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.500
 before you understood poetry with the outside 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:24.240
 and it is 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:27.750
 not of the events let you offer from 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:30.140
 words fall in love 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.140
 that's all 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.830
 meanwhile, everything moves and is alive 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.830

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.490
 well 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.239

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:03.659
 which I want them to stay there 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:03.659
