anyways<00:00:48.500> I<00:00:51.050> found<00:00:52.050> that<00:00:52.590> I<00:00:53.010> had<00:00:53.610> given<00:00:53.940> my

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
anyways I found that I had given my

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.209 
anyways I found that I had given my
throttle<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.840> pitch<00:00:55.079> curve<00:00:55.410> settings<00:00:55.980> out

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
throttle and pitch curve settings out

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.189 
throttle and pitch curve settings out
and<00:00:57.469> I<00:00:58.850> had<00:00:59.850> basically<00:01:00.420> said<00:01:00.690> they<00:01:00.840> were<00:01:00.930> good

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
and I had basically said they were good

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.950 
and I had basically said they were good
for<00:01:01.410> all<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.129> t-rex<00:01:02.550> models<00:01:03.090> you<00:01:03.539> know<00:01:03.660> with

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
for all the t-rex models you know with

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.170 
for all the t-rex models you know with
the<00:01:04.350> exception<00:01:04.799> of<00:01:04.860> nitros<00:01:07.250> but<00:01:08.250> I<00:01:08.280> think<00:01:08.790> I

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
the exception of nitros but I think I

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.630 
the exception of nitros but I think I
haven't<00:01:09.869> flown<00:01:10.020> this<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:10.740> I<00:01:10.770> think<00:01:11.310> the

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
haven't flown this and I think the

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.670 
haven't flown this and I think the
settings<00:01:12.060> that<00:01:12.150> I<00:01:12.270> gave<00:01:12.510> out<00:01:12.750> were<00:01:13.020> very<00:01:13.380> good

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
settings that I gave out were very good

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.980 
settings that I gave out were very good

for the 450 promo
now<00:01:17.090> the<00:01:18.090> settings<00:01:18.540> were<00:01:18.720> good<00:01:18.990> for<00:01:19.229> all<00:01:19.409> of

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
now the settings were good for all of

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.100 
now the settings were good for all of
them<00:01:19.799> guys<00:01:20.009> but<00:01:20.909> I<00:01:20.939> don't<00:01:21.330> think<00:01:21.600> that's<00:01:21.900> right

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
them guys but I don't think that's right

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.929 
them guys but I don't think that's right
will<00:01:22.350> curve<00:01:23.090> the<00:01:24.090> main<00:01:24.330> throttle<00:01:24.869> curve

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 
will curve the main throttle curve

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:28.580 
will curve the main throttle curve
settings<00:01:26.939> I<00:01:27.270> don't<00:01:27.750> think<00:01:27.990> they<00:01:28.140> they<00:01:28.530> were

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
settings I don't think they they were

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.740 
settings I don't think they they were

wrap<00:02:48.459> it<00:02:48.730> up<00:02:48.820> the<00:02:49.150> new<00:02:49.330> settings<00:02:49.870> guys<00:02:50.200> are<00:02:50.620> 0

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
wrap it up the new settings guys are 0

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:58.350 
wrap it up the new settings guys are 0
okay<00:02:52.300> 70<00:02:53.080> 80<00:02:53.950> 90<00:02:54.400> 100<00:02:55.799> and<00:02:56.799> that<00:02:57.489> got<00:02:57.790> this<00:02:58.000> bird

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
okay 70 80 90 100 and that got this bird

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.860 
okay 70 80 90 100 and that got this bird
handling<00:02:59.019> a<00:02:59.170> lot<00:02:59.350> better<00:02:59.830> it<00:03:00.730> was<00:03:01.000> no<00:03:01.209> blogging

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
handling a lot better it was no blogging

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.979 
handling a lot better it was no blogging
it<00:03:02.080> was<00:03:02.260> more<00:03:02.560> responsive<00:03:03.750> throughout<00:03:04.750> the

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
it was more responsive throughout the

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:11.039 
it was more responsive throughout the
throttle<00:03:05.470> band<00:03:05.769> and<00:03:08.070> so<00:03:09.070> I<00:03:09.100> do<00:03:09.340> think<00:03:09.610> that<00:03:10.239> the

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
throttle band and so I do think that the

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:15.289 
throttle band and so I do think that the
bigger<00:03:11.489> helicopters<00:03:12.489> need<00:03:12.760> more<00:03:13.720> oomph<00:03:13.900> okay

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
bigger helicopters need more oomph okay

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:19.020 
bigger helicopters need more oomph okay
so<00:03:16.299> I<00:03:16.900> think<00:03:17.620> that<00:03:17.980> those<00:03:18.160> settings<00:03:18.610> were<00:03:18.790> good

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
so I think that those settings were good

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.259 
so I think that those settings were good
for<00:03:19.239> the<00:03:19.299> 450<00:03:20.400> but<00:03:21.400> I<00:03:21.430> don't<00:03:21.730> think<00:03:21.970> that<00:03:22.120> they

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
for the 450 but I don't think that they

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:24.420 
for the 450 but I don't think that they
were<00:03:22.330> good<00:03:22.630> for<00:03:22.840> the<00:03:22.900> 500<00:03:23.590> I<00:03:23.680> know<00:03:23.920> so<00:03:24.370> I

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
were good for the 500 I know so I

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.520 
were good for the 500 I know so I
apologize<00:03:25.120> for<00:03:25.360> those<00:03:25.510> settings<00:03:26.019> guys<00:03:26.260> it's

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
apologize for those settings guys it's

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.800 
apologize for those settings guys it's
