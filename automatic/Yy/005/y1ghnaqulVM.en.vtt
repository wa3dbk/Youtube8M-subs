00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:16.810
I ...  opened my mouth it all rushed out, spoken

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.330
Though I never meant you to know it

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:27.400
I ...  caught myself, but I'm scared that we're broken

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.200
My feelings are showing

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.600
I stopped and got lost in my mind

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:41.970
I never felt so unraveled in my whole life

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.570
I said I love you, I love you, I love you

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.070
but now I regret it

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.830
Said I love you, I love you, I love you

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.570
but I'm sorry I said it

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.570
But what's done is done, I can't undo what's done

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.270
Don't wanna hurt this thing, we've just begun

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.800
I know I've said it, but can we forget this

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:08.900
Now, Iâ€™m hoping your hearts open

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:13.770
words unfolding, now you know

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.600
And I couldn't hold it all inside,

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.370
push it back into rewind

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:28.230
Now my secret's spoken... 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.470
All I hear is raindrops, falling on the rooftop

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.470
Oh baby, tell me why'd you have to go

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:42.670
'Cause this pain I feel, it won't go away

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:49.670
And today, I'm officially missing you

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:55.570
I thought that from this heartache, I could escape

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.500
But I fronted long enough to know

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.960
there ain't no way

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:10.230
And today, I'm officially missing you

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:17.200
Ooh... can't nobody do it like you

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.320
Said every little thing you do

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.330
Hey baby, say it stays on my mind

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:31.370
And I, I'm officially missing you

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:38.630
Ooh... can't nobody do it like you

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.200
Said every little thing you do

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.730
Hey baby, say it stays on my mind

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:52.570
And I, I'm officially missing you

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.330
I said I love you, I love you, I love you

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.730
but now I regret it

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.670
Said I love you, I love you, I love you

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.330
but I'm sorry I said it

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.400
But what's done is done, I can't undo what's done

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.130
Don't wanna hurt this thing, we've just begun

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:15.230
I know I've said it, can we forget this

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.330
...it's official
