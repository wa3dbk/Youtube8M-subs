pieces<00:01:43.350> well<00:01:43.649> when<00:01:44.070> this<00:01:44.250> random<00:01:44.759> thing

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
pieces well when this random thing

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.639 
pieces well when this random thing
happens<00:01:45.450> you<00:01:45.600> will<00:01:45.720> do<00:01:45.869> five<00:01:46.110> percent<00:01:46.470> more

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
happens you will do five percent more

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.679 
happens you will do five percent more
damage<00:01:47.070> that's<00:01:47.970> boring<00:01:48.299> for<00:01:48.630> me

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
damage that's boring for me

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.020 
damage that's boring for me
unfortunately<00:01:48.899> I'm<00:01:49.590> sorry<00:01:49.860> but<00:01:50.100> it<00:01:50.340> really<00:01:50.759> is

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
unfortunately I'm sorry but it really is

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.780 
unfortunately I'm sorry but it really is
boring<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:52.350> boomkin<00:01:52.590> trinkets<00:01:53.280> does

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
boring and the boomkin trinkets does

this<00:01:54.060> star<00:01:54.689> surge<00:01:54.990> is<00:01:55.200> a<00:01:55.320> twenty-seven

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
this star surge is a twenty-seven

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.039 
this star surge is a twenty-seven
percent<00:01:56.130> chance<00:01:56.520> to<00:01:56.820> also<00:01:57.180> trigger<00:01:57.509> star<00:01:57.780> fall

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
percent chance to also trigger star fall

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.350 
percent chance to also trigger star fall
now<00:01:58.619> I<00:01:58.680> know<00:01:58.799> this<00:01:59.189> is<00:01:59.310> a<00:01:59.340> damage<00:01:59.790> increase<00:02:00.149> but

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
now I know this is a damage increase but

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.780 
now I know this is a damage increase but
how<00:02:00.930> weird<00:02:02.149> right<00:02:03.149> so<00:02:04.159> when<00:02:05.159> you<00:02:05.219> press<00:02:05.460> star

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
how weird right so when you press star

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.309 
how weird right so when you press star
search<00:02:06.119> it<00:02:06.450> might<00:02:07.399> might<00:02:08.399> cost<00:02:09.360> star<00:02:09.869> fall<00:02:10.140> as

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
search it might might cost star fall as

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.500 
search it might might cost star fall as
well<00:02:10.560> so<00:02:11.340> you<00:02:11.400> will<00:02:11.610> be<00:02:11.640> star<00:02:11.970> falling<00:02:12.239> on

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
well so you will be star falling on

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.460 
well so you will be star falling on
single<00:02:12.870> target<00:02:13.230> with

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
single target with

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.460 
single target with
this<00:02:13.640> sometimes<00:02:14.640> I<00:02:15.090> just<00:02:15.750> I<00:02:16.020> don't<00:02:16.260> know<00:02:16.410> it's

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
this sometimes I just I don't know it's

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.000 
this sometimes I just I don't know it's
kind<00:02:16.770> of<00:02:17.010> weird<00:02:17.280> I<00:02:17.460> think<00:02:17.730> and<00:02:18.410> yeah<00:02:19.410> so<00:02:19.800> that's

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
kind of weird I think and yeah so that's

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.310 
kind of weird I think and yeah so that's
the<00:02:20.130> boomkin<00:02:20.370> stuff<00:02:20.910> now<00:02:21.540> the<00:02:21.600> Pharaoh<00:02:21.960> stuff

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
the boomkin stuff now the Pharaoh stuff

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.800 
the boomkin stuff now the Pharaoh stuff
the<00:02:23.100> two<00:02:23.340> pieces<00:02:23.550> increases<00:02:24.210> your<00:02:24.300> oment<00:02:24.690> of

the two pieces increases your oment of

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.930 
the two pieces increases your oment of

clarity proc chance by 2 percent which

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.780 
clarity proc chance by 2 percent which
well<00:02:27.390> ha<00:02:27.690> I<00:02:27.990> think<00:02:28.590> I<00:02:28.800> just<00:02:28.860> creamed<00:02:29.310> my<00:02:29.460> pants

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
well ha I think I just creamed my pants

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.600 
well ha I think I just creamed my pants
2%<00:02:30.570> oh<00:02:30.690> my<00:02:30.930> goodness<00:02:31.440> you<00:02:31.680> know<00:02:31.770> that's<00:02:32.040> just

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
2% oh my goodness you know that's just

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.120 
2% oh my goodness you know that's just
not<00:02:32.940> not<00:02:33.210> not<00:02:33.510> much<00:02:33.780> and<00:02:34.110> it<00:02:34.650> also<00:02:34.830> increases

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
not not not much and it also increases

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.670 
not not not much and it also increases
your<00:02:35.400> energy<00:02:35.460> by<00:02:36.060> 10<00:02:36.450> that's<00:02:37.110> actually<00:02:37.500> pretty

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
your energy by 10 that's actually pretty

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.490 
your energy by 10 that's actually pretty
good<00:02:37.980> because<00:02:38.430> as<00:02:38.610> feral<00:02:39.120> you<00:02:39.630> are<00:02:39.810> pulling

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
good because as feral you are pulling

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.350 
good because as feral you are pulling
energy<00:02:40.770> quite<00:02:41.280> a<00:02:41.310> bit<00:02:41.550> so<00:02:41.700> you<00:02:41.790> can<00:02:41.820> explode

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
energy quite a bit so you can explode

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.170 
energy quite a bit so you can explode
with<00:02:42.600> blood<00:02:42.840> talons<00:02:43.200> and<00:02:43.320> bleeds<00:02:43.590> so<00:02:44.400> this<00:02:45.000> is

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
with blood talons and bleeds so this is

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.810 
with blood talons and bleeds so this is
pretty<00:02:45.390> good<00:02:45.720> and<00:02:45.990> the<00:02:46.709> four<00:02:46.950> piece<00:02:47.160> is<00:02:47.370> during

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
pretty good and the four piece is during

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.400 
pretty good and the four piece is during

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
as the cat 2 piece but now I'm pretty

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:00.350 
as the cat 2 piece but now I'm pretty
sure<00:03:58.830> that's<00:03:59.100> not<00:03:59.310> how<00:03:59.700> it's<00:03:59.880> supposed<00:03:59.940> to<00:04:00.209> be

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
sure that's not how it's supposed to be

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
but the four piece is here so sandwich

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.190 
but the four piece is here so sandwich
defense<00:04:02.850> also<00:04:03.090> reduces<00:04:03.630> the<00:04:03.750> cost<00:04:04.019> of

yeah<00:04:08.370> I<00:04:08.580> don't<00:04:08.880> think<00:04:09.180> guardian<00:04:09.540> droids<00:04:09.780> will

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:09.990

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:12.800 
yeah I don't think guardian droids will
be<00:04:10.130> really<00:04:11.130> excited<00:04:11.730> by<00:04:11.880> that<00:04:11.910> because<00:04:12.360> frenzy

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
be really excited by that because frenzy

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.140 
be really excited by that because frenzy
regeneration<00:04:13.230> is<00:04:13.530> bad<00:04:13.830> and<00:04:14.190> you<00:04:14.819> do<00:04:15.000> have

enough rage to use two thin cloth so oh
okay<00:04:21.750> I<00:04:22.380> don't<00:04:23.370> think<00:04:23.400> already<00:04:23.669> androids<00:04:24.060> will

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570

bloom decides to bloom or tick it's
