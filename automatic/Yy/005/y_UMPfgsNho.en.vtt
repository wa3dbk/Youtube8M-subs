the season he said we have to know what

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.470 
the season he said we have to know what
we're<00:00:52.500> doing<00:00:52.829> so<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.610> players<00:00:53.879> particularly

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
we're doing so the players particularly

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.670 
we're doing so the players particularly
if<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.840> deal<00:00:55.020> is<00:00:55.140> going<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.320> get<00:00:55.469> worse<00:00:55.649> for

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
if the deal is going to get worse for

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.720 
if the deal is going to get worse for
them<00:00:56.039> as<00:00:56.160> time<00:00:56.340> goes<00:00:56.460> on<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.480> owners

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
them as time goes on and the owners

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.430 
them as time goes on and the owners
almost<00:00:59.730> half<00:01:00.030> of<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.300> owners<00:01:00.690> didn't<00:01:01.289> like

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
almost half of the owners didn't like

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.470 
almost half of the owners didn't like
the<00:01:01.590> fifty-fifth<00:01:02.329> either

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
the fifty-fifth either

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.660 
the fifty-fifth either
so<00:01:03.899> what<00:01:04.199> I<00:01:04.229> think<00:01:04.619> is<00:01:04.739> going<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:05.100> happen<00:01:05.489> is

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
so what I think is going to happen is

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.420 
so what I think is going to happen is
we're<00:01:06.450> gonna<00:01:06.600> miss<00:01:06.930> this<00:01:07.170> season<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:07.890> I<00:01:08.400> think

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
we're gonna miss this season and I think

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.320 
we're gonna miss this season and I think
they<00:01:09.150> will<00:01:09.360> start<00:01:10.040> renegotiating<00:01:11.040> in<00:01:11.330> the

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330

spring<00:01:12.720> or<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.110> summer<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:14.369> then<00:01:14.580> they'll

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
spring or the summer and then they'll

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.490 
spring or the summer and then they'll
play<00:01:15.000> next<00:01:15.240> season<00:01:15.420> I<00:01:15.600> hope<00:01:15.840> I'm<00:01:16.020> wrong<00:01:16.229> okay

felt like wizard you can't be so naive

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.539 
felt like wizard you can't be so naive
where<00:01:58.020> you<00:01:58.170> walk<00:01:58.439> away<00:01:58.649> from<00:01:58.950> two<00:01:59.189> billion

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
where you walk away from two billion

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.130 
where you walk away from two billion
dollars<00:01:59.939> when<00:02:00.119> you<00:02:00.149> have<00:02:00.479> no<00:02:00.689> leverage<00:02:00.930> I've

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
dollars when you have no leverage I've

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.630 
dollars when you have no leverage I've
never<00:02:01.409> said<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.740> players<00:02:01.950> were<00:02:02.189> wrong<00:02:02.399> what<00:02:02.610> I

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
never said the players were wrong what I

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.280 
never said the players were wrong what I
said<00:02:02.939> is<00:02:03.060> they<00:02:03.149> don't<00:02:03.329> have<00:02:03.479> any<00:02:03.719> leverage<00:02:03.930> and

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
said is they don't have any leverage and

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.010
