00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 it's the world knows that these tutorials and 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.120
 since I noticed that the first 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.309
 video how to choose a pc gamer has good 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.420
 market I want to say we do not change 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:18.000
 not a team that wins 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:20.910
 alan compare gamer ok mice for 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.789
 this little comparative one can not 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.519
 to miss out on actually they are 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.949
 very very good level of gaming equipment 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:32.430
 and the mice are part by name 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:36.000
 gold gold from their blinds their 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.910
 market what's it so I want to 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.710
 to say there is a small panel of mice so 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:46.489
 both mmo and fps know that the 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:51.809
 even especially that which is a lot of 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:54.600
 two buttons there on the side that's after 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.309
 good for a mouse between ea games so 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.180
 at razer because 40 euros for a 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.359
 mouse is still not bad 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.010
 there is this one one must know that all 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.769
 the mice that are present hoist her 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.159
 Good quality for gaming 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.260
 certain we can not say otherwise it is 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.750
 really the top of the top what are these 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.040
 really very good mice here I am 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.820
 do you really recommend razer mice? 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.080
 we will go to logitech for logitech 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.790
 it will be 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.040
 a little bit different because 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.240
 actually it will have to sort because 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.890
 that logitech does not have that and mice 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:33.260
 extremely good quality they also have 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.820
 of work so are you entitled 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.240
 they make smiles a little gaming 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.890
 like those who are really good 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.560
 Also do not hesitate to inform you 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.600
 if I had to go inform you of 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.670
 every notice on every mouse that I 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.990
 will introduce you that would really put 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.990
 very very very very long 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.090
 but hey there I let you look at me 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.300
 advise you anyway 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:02:00.860
 this mouse there that is 40 euros the one 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:01.880
 this one is then the 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.750
 others have me to see 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:08.510
 we must still see more 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:11.600
 to inquire to be sure of not 

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:13.100
 not to be wrong and to have a bad 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.720
 surprise 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:19.760
 why go to ldlc maintain 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:24.520
 so at ldlc we really have a 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.520
 wide a lot a lot of mice 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.930
 so it's the same at logitech 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.260
 still a little bit watched because 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:36.560
 that it is 10 euros says it takes 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:39.189
 watch a little bit I advise you 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.870
 like the subway bloody had 5 17 

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:43.549
 they are very good mice and v7 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.950
 is not necessarily more expensive than v3 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:47.439
 and you see that they look like 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:53.120
 really very ergonomic 

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:58.040
 so that's really really great 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:03:00.920
 super mouse you see my dad 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:04.730
 necessarily super expensive and who are at the 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:07.639
 times beautiful and in my opinion efficient 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:10.220
 so here we see again so that 

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:12.950
 it was rather a grouping of 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.870
 mouse with the gigabyte the genuis and 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.419
 so here we are reviewing the repositories 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:20.620
 this time a little more gaming than 

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:20.620
 did not see in our site 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:26.250
 like those that are made for 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:30.620
 the erm the mmo and of course the mad catz 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:33.989
 who are the best smiles her 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:36.480
 super mouse but really we can 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:39.359
 can put peas etc let you 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:44.220
 to watch one of these mice 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:44.819
 really really amazing what so 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.290
 here 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:47.670
 these are really super rebel smiles 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.730
 I give you three sites they are in 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:54.239
 the description and do not hesitate 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.079
 to go see here you can see all 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:57.359
 marks 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:59.579
 but there is a lot I can not 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:01.470
 you always show them the 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:03.400
 main brands I hope you 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:07.599
 understand 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:11.610
 and yeah really really great 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:14.860
 great evening you can try filtered 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:19.870
 for example, with 40 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:22.060
 euros this way and you can 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.699
 filter to have with the mouse unless 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.979
 40 euros 

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:28.990
 and so that's all right, it's over for this 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:33.039
 little comparative it's true that it was 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:34.750
 shorter than that of the pc gamer but this 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:36.820
 are mice that are a little less 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.270
 important that the pc soon the 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.670
 keyboard 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.500
 so I hope you expect it he'll 

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:45.140
 go out in the next week we 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.910
 let's see how it goes back to school 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.720
 if I have a lot of work or what in 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:49.460
 any case I wish you 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.950
 if I do not make a good video 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:54.260

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.670
 fall on the after we understand you the 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.350
 Pamela you can see we are 

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:58.430

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:59.330

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:03.970
