00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.840
 good afternoon how to determine the quality of fish 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:17.789
 the first is the smell the smell should be 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:22.260
 normal pleasant in a pinch 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:25.019
 if the fish smell of the river but no slime in 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.810
 basis and everything else that is not 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:31.800
 there must be a bad smell 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:35.010
 the second is where the foot is done kill the fish we 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:38.010
 pay attention to the eyes on these eyes 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.960
 see you can not see that they are not living eyes 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.800
 a little stand here and we need 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.620
 pour in 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.469
 they are a little bit they are bright 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.020
 clearly visible behind dude they're not wet 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.059
 retracted plush if the fish is not himself he 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.129
 would he be drawn in 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.230
 reference nothing here is visible it 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.719
 see lively good protective enchantment 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.899
 fresh eyes 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:04.530
 we checked ok and then what we 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.869
 do next we check if it will 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.100
 not fresh here like a knife on legs yes 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.530
 be dent 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.600
 just like we check for swelling 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.580
 hands do not need if there is swelling in the heat and 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.710
 there was an apple for purity 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.460
 in the same way and on the fish if left 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:24.390
 dent means fish mean not 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.460
 fresh and and not worth taking this river in 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:31.829
 this case is good now what 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:33.930
 scales scales tightly here 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:37.079
 too shiny scales 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:40.890
 wet scales look at fins 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:44.549
 fins too wet not dry all 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:47.640
 fins it says fresh and 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:52.799
 fresh fish we all looked 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:57.390
 checked now let's see what 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:02:02.579
 gills what let's see they should 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:04.829
 be either pink here or such here too 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:09.330
 may be but from pink to 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:11.520
 bright red again too not dry here 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:15.710
 no there is nothing such a knight 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:20.100
 I, Zhenya, are a good man who say that 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:22.350
 we have a fresh fish 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.990
 can do if he is even poor 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.270
 mouth opened the cashier or what else can we do 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:30.630
 to make 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:34.200
 fresh fish she drowns in the water populate 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:37.170
 pour into the pot a big risk if 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:40.680
 want to check the turnip here lower if 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:43.170
 fungus sinking means she is not fresh 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:48.060
 such a fish is not worth buying these 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:51.170
 all the main signs of freshness of fish 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:55.130
 I think every woman should know 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.130
 all the best to you
