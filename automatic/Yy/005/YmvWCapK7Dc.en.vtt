00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
think that's what it is they might have

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.090 
think that's what it is they might have
changed<00:01:20.729> that<00:01:20.970> but<00:01:21.630> in<00:01:21.869> like<00:01:22.110> 4.3<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:22.830> needed

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
changed that but in like 4.3 you needed

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.310 
changed that but in like 4.3 you needed
to<00:01:23.189> heal<00:01:23.369> someone<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:23.970> what<00:01:24.570> that<00:01:24.600> does<00:01:25.020> is

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
to heal someone and what that does is

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.160 
to heal someone and what that does is
that<00:01:25.439> opens<00:01:26.130> up<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.490> chakra<00:01:26.880> state<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:27.420> it's

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
that opens up a chakra state and it's

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.230 
that opens up a chakra state and it's
called<00:01:28.380> serenity<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:28.979> every<00:01:29.670> time<00:01:29.880> you<00:01:30.060> put<00:01:30.210> a
