00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.929
 I love crayfish and how much we are with you 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:10.450
 they ate them and we ate them of course 

00:00:07.929 --> 00:00:12.400
 and in Moscow and we ate them in Rostov-on-Don 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.919
 with you in general i know that you are real 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.900
 you know my such comrade better than me 

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:20.529
 probably also ok ok I'm better 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:22.269
 the part in the crayfish is a cancerous neck and 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:24.730
 for example 

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:27.220
 number of cancerous necks all fingers will be 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.470
 and chipped it needs a lot of kilos 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.439
 I therefore use crayfish for salad 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.880
 discovered an amazing product 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.350
 meridian cancer cervix do you understand 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.670
 understand and on someone's labels when you 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.899
 buy something, you can immediately understand 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.879
 to entrust the product or not here 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:41.620
 just brine and just 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:44.469
 boiled cancer above these as if we are with 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.660
 they cooked you gentle they just 

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:48.399
 they are natural taste well, just like 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.680
 as if a crayfish was brought to us from the estuary 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:52.120
 fine so here we cut small 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.469
 the number of tomatoes is important to 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.629
 they were sweet it is not fundamental 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:57.280
 so that they were the main thing so that they 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:01.629
 were sweet not watery 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:07.090
 And here such juicy pieces six olives 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:11.430
 can you take green can you take black 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:16.170
 the main thing that they were pitted 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:18.670
 so add olives to tomatoes 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.960
 olives they are called i know black 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:24.540
 for some reason, not everyone wants to call them 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:26.350
 alikom so young potatoes already 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.450

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.700

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.600
 be sure to scald or boiling water or 

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:01.119
 pickle briefly in vinegar
