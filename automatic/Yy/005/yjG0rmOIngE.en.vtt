Halloween<00:00:02.070> is<00:00:02.280> one<00:00:02.460> of<00:00:02.610> the<00:00:02.700> doodles<00:00:03.000> that

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
Halloween is one of the doodles that

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:04.579 
Halloween is one of the doodles that
we've<00:00:03.270> done<00:00:03.389> every<00:00:03.659> year<00:00:03.720> usually<00:00:04.440> it's<00:00:04.560> just

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
we've done every year usually it's just

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:06.499 
we've done every year usually it's just
an<00:00:04.799> illustration<00:00:05.160> or<00:00:05.580> like<00:00:05.910> a<00:00:05.940> few<00:00:06.210> years<00:00:06.390> ago

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
an illustration or like a few years ago

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.000 
an illustration or like a few years ago
we<00:00:06.750> did<00:00:06.899> sort<00:00:07.140> of<00:00:07.170> like<00:00:07.230> a<00:00:07.350> click<00:00:07.589> through<00:00:07.770> with

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
we did sort of like a click through with

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.680 
we did sort of like a click through with
candy<00:00:08.340> unwrapping<00:00:08.670> this<00:00:09.090> is<00:00:09.240> the<00:00:09.330> first<00:00:09.540> time

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
candy unwrapping this is the first time

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.900 
candy unwrapping this is the first time
we've<00:00:09.840> done<00:00:09.990> like<00:00:10.110> an<00:00:10.230> actual<00:00:10.530> shoot<00:00:10.950> carving

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
we've done like an actual shoot carving

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.299 
we've done like an actual shoot carving
actual<00:00:12.300> pumpkins<00:00:12.900> the<00:00:13.440> largest<00:00:13.889> one<00:00:14.040> here<00:00:14.280> I

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
actual pumpkins the largest one here I

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.220 
actual pumpkins the largest one here I
think<00:00:14.460> is<00:00:14.910> twelve<00:00:15.480> hundred<00:00:15.690> and<00:00:15.960> ninety<00:00:16.199> eight

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
think is twelve hundred and ninety eight

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.980 
think is twelve hundred and ninety eight
pounds<00:00:16.740> so<00:00:17.100> that's<00:00:17.220> pretty<00:00:17.640> big<00:00:17.850> and<00:00:18.330> moving

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
pounds so that's pretty big and moving

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.510 
pounds so that's pretty big and moving
on<00:00:19.080> is<00:00:19.170> a<00:00:19.199> really<00:00:19.439> arduous<00:00:19.619> process<00:00:19.980> not<00:00:20.310> only

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
on is a really arduous process not only

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.800 
on is a really arduous process not only
because<00:00:20.760> they're<00:00:20.880> huge<00:00:21.150> and<00:00:21.359> heavy<00:00:21.449> but<00:00:21.689> also

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
because they're huge and heavy but also

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.509 
because they're huge and heavy but also
because<00:00:22.109> they're<00:00:22.260> pretty<00:00:22.410> fragile<00:00:22.590> if<00:00:23.279> we

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
because they're pretty fragile if we

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.220 
because they're pretty fragile if we
aren't<00:00:23.760> careful<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.480> whole<00:00:24.660> thing<00:00:24.869> could

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
aren't careful the whole thing could

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.170 
aren't careful the whole thing could
collapse<00:00:25.410> so<00:00:26.099> we<00:00:26.430> want<00:00:26.640> to<00:00:26.760> make<00:00:26.880> sure<00:00:27.029> that

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
collapse so we want to make sure that

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.939 
collapse so we want to make sure that
they're<00:00:27.330> creative<00:00:27.900> and<00:00:28.199> it's<00:00:28.320> beautiful<00:00:28.920> and

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
they're creative and it's beautiful and

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.980 
they're creative and it's beautiful and
artistic<00:00:29.279> we<00:00:30.269> also<00:00:30.449> need<00:00:30.720> to<00:00:30.810> make<00:00:30.960> sure

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
artistic we also need to make sure

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.780 
artistic we also need to make sure
they're<00:00:31.289> structurally<00:00:31.890> valid<00:00:32.340> taking

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
they're structurally valid taking

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.150 
they're structurally valid taking
something<00:00:33.180> this<00:00:33.300> large<00:00:33.600> and<00:00:34.079> then<00:00:34.530> knowing

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
something this large and then knowing

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.680 
something this large and then knowing
that<00:00:35.430> you<00:00:35.520> can<00:00:35.640> possibly<00:00:35.820> screw<00:00:36.270> it<00:00:36.360> up<00:00:36.450> in

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
that you can possibly screw it up in

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.510 
that you can possibly screw it up in
front<00:00:37.079> of<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.380> entire<00:00:37.469> world<00:00:37.680> or<00:00:38.190> whoever's

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
front of the entire world or whoever's

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.160 
front of the entire world or whoever's
going<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.730> see<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:38.969> doodle<00:00:39.270> is<00:00:39.480> a<00:00:39.780> little

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
going to see the doodle is a little

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.040 
going to see the doodle is a little
intimidating<00:00:40.800> I'm<00:00:41.550> carving<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.030> big<00:00:42.180> G<00:00:42.420> which

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
intimidating I'm carving the big G which

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.690 
intimidating I'm carving the big G which
is<00:00:43.079> a<00:00:43.230> lot<00:00:43.320> of<00:00:43.440> responsibility<00:00:43.649> if<00:00:44.399> you<00:00:44.520> can't

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
is a lot of responsibility if you can't

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.100 
is a lot of responsibility if you can't
read<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.940> big<00:00:45.090> G<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.480> rest<00:00:45.660> of<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.840> logo

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
read the big G the rest of the logo

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.260 
read the big G the rest of the logo
isn't<00:00:46.289> really<00:00:46.500> readable<00:00:46.770> at<00:00:46.950> all<00:00:47.070> I'm<00:00:47.910> doing

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
isn't really readable at all I'm doing

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.060 
isn't really readable at all I'm doing
the<00:00:48.360> first<00:00:48.539> Oh<00:00:48.809> with<00:00:49.469> a<00:00:49.500> little<00:00:49.710> less<00:00:49.800> pressure

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
the first Oh with a little less pressure

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.580 
the first Oh with a little less pressure
on<00:00:50.190> me<00:00:50.430> because<00:00:50.730> it's<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.360> one<00:00:51.570> one<00:00:52.350> set<00:00:52.500> of

on me because it's the one one set of

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.760 
on me because it's the one one set of
difficult<00:00:52.980> letters<00:00:53.219> I<00:00:53.430> have<00:00:54.289> really<00:00:55.289> begun<00:00:55.710> to

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
difficult letters I have really begun to

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.340 
difficult letters I have really begun to
create<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.460> fangs<00:00:56.850> that<00:00:57.329> will<00:00:58.550> mark<00:00:59.550> my<00:00:59.969> oh<00:01:00.350> my

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
my monster oh it's been pretty

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.939 
my monster oh it's been pretty
challenging<00:01:03.359> I<00:01:03.750> spent<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.350> first<00:01:04.379> part<00:01:04.920> of

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
challenging I spent the first part of

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.440 
challenging I spent the first part of
the<00:01:05.040> morning<00:01:05.220> figuring<00:01:05.729> out<00:01:05.850> which<00:01:06.000> side<00:01:06.360> of

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
the morning figuring out which side of

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.620 
the morning figuring out which side of
the<00:01:06.540> knife<00:01:06.720> was<00:01:06.930> sharp<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:08.390> now<00:01:09.390> that<00:01:09.600> I

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
the knife was sharp and now that I

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.080 
the knife was sharp and now that I
figured<00:01:10.080> that<00:01:10.229> out<00:01:10.260> it's<00:01:10.650> been<00:01:11.310> playing

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
figured that out it's been playing

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.670 
figured that out it's been playing
catch-up<00:01:12.299> with<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.630> rest<00:01:12.780> of<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:12.960> game<00:01:13.140> I'm

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
catch-up with the rest of the game I'm

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.469 
catch-up with the rest of the game I'm
working<00:01:13.740> on<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.280> letter<00:01:14.460> L<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.180> Google

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
working on the letter L of the Google

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.260 
working on the letter L of the Google
logo<00:01:15.950> and<00:01:16.950> I<00:01:17.250> wanted<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.729> do<00:01:17.880> kind<00:01:18.150> of<00:01:18.210> a

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
logo and I wanted to do kind of a

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.789 
logo and I wanted to do kind of a
straightforward<00:01:18.570> type<00:01:19.200> of<00:01:19.320> graphical<00:01:19.619> L

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
straightforward type of graphical L

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.410 
straightforward type of graphical L
pretty<00:01:20.130> close<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.820> one<00:01:20.939> that<00:01:21.090> actually

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
pretty close to the one that actually

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.460 
pretty close to the one that actually
appears<00:01:21.689> in<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.869> homepage

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
appears in the homepage

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.230 
appears in the homepage
I<00:01:22.500> am<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:23.040> e<00:01:23.720> so<00:01:24.720> this<00:01:24.869> guy<00:01:25.080> right<00:01:25.290> here<00:01:25.320> is<00:01:26.240> 900

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
I am the e so this guy right here is 900

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.990 
I am the e so this guy right here is 900
pounds<00:01:27.750> I<00:01:27.960> think<00:01:28.710> that<00:01:29.130> biggest<00:01:29.490> pumpkin<00:01:29.700> I've

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
pounds I think that biggest pumpkin I've

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.359 
pounds I think that biggest pumpkin I've
ever<00:01:30.210> carved<00:01:30.570> I<00:01:31.530> didn't<00:01:31.829> know<00:01:31.890> was<00:01:32.070> gonna<00:01:32.220> be

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
ever carved I didn't know was gonna be

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.609 
ever carved I didn't know was gonna be
like<00:01:32.520> this<00:01:32.700> solid<00:01:33.210> so<00:01:33.840> it's<00:01:33.990> pretty<00:01:34.229> difficult

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
like this solid so it's pretty difficult

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.690 
like this solid so it's pretty difficult
to<00:01:34.950> carve<00:01:35.100> into<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:36.240> walls<00:01:36.829> at<00:01:37.829> least<00:01:38.070> mine<00:01:38.310> is

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
to carve into the walls at least mine is

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.450 
to carve into the walls at least mine is
like<00:01:38.939> six<00:01:39.360> inches<00:01:39.570> deep<00:01:40.110> so<00:01:40.950> I<00:01:40.979> actually<00:01:41.130> had

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
like six inches deep so I actually had

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.520 
like six inches deep so I actually had
to<00:01:41.610> work<00:01:41.759> with<00:01:41.970> this<00:01:42.360> big<00:01:42.600> saw<00:01:42.840> like<00:01:43.170> this<00:01:43.320> big

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
to work with this big saw like this big

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.410 
to work with this big saw like this big
eventually<00:01:43.950> to<00:01:44.280> get<00:01:44.430> this<00:01:44.549> hole<00:01:45.000> out<00:01:45.240> of<00:01:45.270> the

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
eventually to get this hole out of the

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.450 
eventually to get this hole out of the
pumpkin<00:01:45.720> because<00:01:46.229> of<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.619> regular<00:01:47.100> pumpkins

about<00:01:47.610> human<00:01:47.909> head<00:01:48.090> size<00:01:48.329> and<00:01:48.659> this<00:01:49.290> is<00:01:49.439> much

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
about human head size and this is much

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.740 
about human head size and this is much

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
much larger the power dynamic is sort of

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.780 
much larger the power dynamic is sort of

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
look like until yesterday we basically

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.559 
look like until yesterday we basically
started<00:02:16.050> by<00:02:16.140> drawing<00:02:16.200> out<00:02:16.650> the<00:02:16.800> letter<00:02:16.980> and

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
started by drawing out the letter and

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:20.809 
started by drawing out the letter and
cutting<00:02:18.569> into<00:02:18.720> it<00:02:18.870> and<00:02:19.200> just<00:02:19.350> slowly<00:02:19.819> carving

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
cutting into it and just slowly carving

I'm<00:02:22.680> just<00:02:23.000> kind<00:02:24.000> of<00:02:24.530> sculpting<00:02:25.530> it<00:02:25.650> I<00:02:25.740> guess

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
I'm just kind of sculpting it I guess
