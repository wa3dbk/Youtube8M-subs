00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:03.570
 2011 ladies and gentlemen and how they can see change radically we can 

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:07.119

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:09.200
 of the blue oval as well as the new headlights 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.900
 conesa the vote cen that Indian sandoval much more aggressive and apart the 

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:17.770
 led technology that is already included in front with these lines that 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.969
 divide the front facia that will be pretty good even when we go in the 

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:25.979
 day the children are already 18 inches which 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.799
 we are much more sporting they give him a presence than what can I be the 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:34.079

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.170
 skulls the double exit of escape and of course the pobles what was it that 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.740
 distinguished the first generation now yes we are already in this 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.860
 strong chut 2011 and what can I say has changed everything completely but 

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:49.179
 follow the community that we have for the five passengers the great capacity of 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:53.369
 load that this has been characteristic of the works pross and of course ap 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.119
 changed all the central panel there is them on the screen tell me you 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:01.840
 8-inch sales is where we can have all the information of the car and 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.600
 this system has been renewed and has passed to the next generation plaza san 

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:11.250
 frames o and thank you obviously ashford now the this system is called mahik 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.279
 strong 

00:02:12.279 --> 00:02:16.189
 what does this mean that we can have this screen where we can control 

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:20.009
 navigation with all Ford technology we can control the system 

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:23.879
 gross by cell phones we can control the audio clip system what 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:27.629
 good hate and we can also have all those who go through the details of 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:31.809
 car in the technical aspect but that does not end there because in the panel 

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:35.209
 that we found behind the steering wheel 5 sections two small screens 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:39.930
 pond framing so to speak to the speedometer where we can is to divide 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.840
 the entertainment of the technicians and where we can control by the 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.230
 flyer all the aspects that we want to know about the truck without having to 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.269
 flip photo karla central screen but simply that is to control the arrows 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:55.380
 that we have in the arms of the wheel and thus be able to go 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.110
 from one person to another in addition to this the camera and reversing sensors very 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.669
 you need the post the blind spot monitoring that your small mirror 

00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:08.139
 it's not like we know it with a hundred with colin that is the luxury brand of 

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:12.139
 ford if not that here we can have a much wider vision but in this 

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:14.699
 small box that you have to get used to is not so easy 

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:19.449
 have to be these two visions all this is what this new 

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:21.769
 technology after txistus 1011 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:26.840
 now if the cherry on the cake is this 6-point 6-liter 5-liter engine 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.970
 with a power of 285 horsepower the cut 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.660
 from 253 foot pounds at 4 thousand revolutions per minute transmission 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.700
 it's six-speed automatic with the equipment modes and of course the 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.470
 front-wheel drive with independent suspension on all four wheels 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.600
 we can say of this crossover what he has done is a sporty handling 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:52.110
 We found it a bit heavy but it has been improving read the address of 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:53.640
 psa hardens a little more 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.560
 and of course the suspension is still the best thing about this truck as 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.000
 I told them we can percent and transit by the lawyer 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.590
 correcalles very affected by the bumps and potholes that there are few in the city of 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.390
 mexico say out there then for a hundred then 100 it becomes a it's trip 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:13.260
 completely nice difference the handling of the truck that is 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.359
 comfortable is stable is dynamic is safe and that is what can offer 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:21.130
 strong shock 2011 and it is already on sale in our country in this version 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.810
 limited that was the one we had in test here in which he explores
