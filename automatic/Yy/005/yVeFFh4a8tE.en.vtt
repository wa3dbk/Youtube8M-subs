00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:08.970
 these spring chicks are 

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:11.190
 fed with cat food 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.240
 the cat food we put in a 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.240
 vessel like this 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.180
 we give him a little boiled water 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:25.790
 He says 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.790
 that puree 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:29.070
 after 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:35.190
 we use a syringe like this and the 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.190
 we fill a food 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:49.280
 this element allows us to give it to him 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:52.309
 directly to the bird to feed it 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.550
 just tap the one on the 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:54.550
 nest 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:01.090
 is the one that automatically opens your mouth and 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.090
 there we give directly to the peak 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.580
 and 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.259
 very much 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.509
 in this way we can feed very 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.010
 easily 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.010
 the spring chicks 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.939
 good or any other type of bird 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.330
 it's important you lose me the physical 

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:52.260
 because if you do not stay a little bit 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.909
 massage 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.260
 I brought them by hand but you can 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:57.260
 clean with a napkin species 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:05.890
 your positions already have this little one 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:08.700
 has 10 days this to have as if this one 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.700
 to have like 3 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.770
 we realize because this already has 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.090
 all the pens 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.090
 it lacks a bit in the tail 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.319
 well this pigeon cited 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:28.640
 it's my little
