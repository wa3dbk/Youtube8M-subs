00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 what struck me more than eternity 

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:07.020
 good question also because I am 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.910
 lots of items to build on 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.000
 to judge this masterpiece by 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.049
 oesterheld and only need to start 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.870
 from the script of the same 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.580
 oesterheld which features that almost 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.470
 perfect safety has a rhythm 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:24.720
 really commendable narrative because 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.939
 is perhaps even emphasized in the 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.439
 reassembly carried out in the first 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.960
 Italian editions and also in editions 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.210
 economic printed in this volume on 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.280
 number 29 of the cartoon classics of 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:39.360
 republic could be designs of 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.809
 lopez sleep that are terrible 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:46.950
 while in the sense they are splendid but they are 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:50.430
 terribly distressing in their 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.559
 dazzling black and white in which black 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.850
 of corpses but will punch with white 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:01:00.899
 the whiteness of real snow snowfall 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:05.030
 deadly frames are almost given that 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:07.350
 they are made with excellent realism 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.740
 almost photogram frames of a film 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.720
 but where the actors didn't come 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.299
 very well are the frames in short 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.729
 caught while the actor is showing the 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.670
 his most human vein 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.560
 we can say this could be i 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:27.270
 topics covered for example the invasion 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:31.860
 alien that invades just listen to the 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:35.520
 repeat the land where we have them 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.320
 the race of invaders whose whose 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.540
 behavior is very reminiscent of that of 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.899
 totalitarian regimes in totalitarian regimes 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:46.110
 which we remember are formed by beings 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:50.280
 humans so it would remain practically does 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.570
 a parallelism presents the aliens to us 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.549
 that behave as they are 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.530
 really behaved human beings 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.820
 so how human being can be 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:02.310
 alien on the same planet for example 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:04.140
 topics covered psychological investigation which 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.290
 western and act in his characters 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.489
 present there is a human humanity without 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.550
 a shadow of a doubt presents us all 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.520
 nuances of character from heroism 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.760
 to cowardice 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.980
 and we also see characters acting a 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.850
 all round characters real characters 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.790
 credible 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:24.400
 I don't doubt they are even once 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.380
 were had I need to resort to 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.500
 suspension of disbelief 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.270
 during this reading because it is 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.460
 absolutely crude punch 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.390
 stomach 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.670
 it could also be that he has me 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.400
 hit the prophetic abilities 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:45.210
 in fact, all that is eternalized 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:48.460
 it happens it will mirror with surprising 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:51.930
 fidelity what will happen in the same 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:54.490
 argentina by oesterheld and solano lÃ³pez 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.630
 almost twenty years later 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:03:00.160
 hence a truly prophetic novel 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.930
 they could be serving lots of things 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.290
 they are all elements that make the 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.760
 returned to that masterpiece that but not 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.650
 his of these is the thing that has me 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:12.100
 hit the thing that struck me most 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:15.130
 more eyes were eyes 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:18.880
 the eyes of the eternal the eyes of 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:21.190
 human galvez the eternal in the first 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.750
 pages that appear to go in front 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:26.080
 to the series of the scriptwriter of 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:31.060
 comics therefore at the beginning because why 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:34.959
 they are proven eyes, they are destroyed eyes 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:37.930
 they are eyes that have seen something 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:39.459
 I am also absolutely indescribable 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.910
 that starting a person who lived 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:45.340
 something terrible that saw what 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:49.560
 terrible and already just see those eyes 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:52.720
 in the first pages it was really 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:55.810
 a special emotion because it is me 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:04:00.120
 absolutely pushed to dive mine 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:04.000
 reading the novel to know what 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:08.790
 that man who may have happened 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.790
 what could have caused eyes like that 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:15.190
 tried in those eyes 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:18.040
 at the end of the reading of the novel there is 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:21.549
 I saw all that I am then 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:23.700
 read and just looking at those eyes 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:26.310
 at the beginning of the novel 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:29.760
 I could retrace all the events 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:32.730
 and those same eyes had seen and 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:35.550
 nothing short this video a little a 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:37.400
 delirium, however, I wanted to tell you about it 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.690
 because it was really an emotion 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.370
 great immerses in the reading of 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:44.520
 this novel that I think is something 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:47.040
 absolutely not essential 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:49.020
 may not have read it then a greeting a 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:51.570
 all and good continuation of holidays there 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.550
 we see September with the barks project 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:56.100
 Hi everyone 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:58.380
 boys last thing they had 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.640
 said they advised me not to 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.220
 buy the returned in this edition 

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:07.070
 but to take the final editions 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:10.140
 among which I mention that of the 001 editions 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:12.570
 guys is bullshit because me 

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:16.140
 however it is true that those respect 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:18.480
 fully the original work but I if not 

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:21.090
 had bought and read the eternity here 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:24.660
 that anyway I paid 5 euros price for 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:27.210
 cover bleed I would be really a lot 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:30.710
 poorer then I think in front 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:30.710
 works of this stature 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:34.350
 the edition becomes an accessory 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.940
 the edition becomes something that can 

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:37.890
 pass the second floor very well 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:41.040
 condition becomes as important as janko 

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:43.140
 in dragonball then boys the eternal 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:45.210
 fuck yourself in the buy almost to edition of 

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:48.780
 you come within range without looking for 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:51.720
 once that fucking edition vi 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:55.200
 hello hello to all 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:06:01.130
 commendable and that comes according to me 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:01.130
 even in the case it is said
