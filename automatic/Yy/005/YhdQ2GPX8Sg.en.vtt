00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.420
 I will not hold the box too much because she 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.520
 will not give much information as 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.680
 We 're opening up here, seeing that you have 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.990

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.750
 everything with platinum who I'm opening 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.610
 here was a curiosity for you guys 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.510
 for now this keyboard has not yet 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.890
 has arrived 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.960
 there is here in the Brazilian market but 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:23.490
 information some information that the 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:26.130
 his box the box information everything 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.619
 but they're already coming in Portuguese 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.310
 I found it a bit strange is that the 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:34.710
 Layout of keyboard layout is not bnt 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:39.680
 it 's not the Brazilian layout 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:42.119
 I do not have a sidlei and have no 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.649
 I seat the places that we are 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.689
 accustomed but has how to do a little 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.479
 you can swap in windows was the model 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:52.750
 to bnt you can use the american model 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:55.330
 Even though it's going to hit the middle is for you. 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:02:02.200
 his box then turned the line 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:04.150
 within this beauty here is our 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.150
 tekoha linen such sensitive keyboard 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:09.670
 take it before I talk about it in itself 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:12.430
 I'm going to take everything I have first. 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:17.080
 I would like you to see better. 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:19.290
 give a look quickly saw them are 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:23.560
 looking suitable 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.880
 I'll take it all right here and see 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.709
 every thing I remember, then the 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:33.900
 people talk specifically about the keyboard 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:33.900
 Here're usb 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.780
 just tougher than imagined 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:44.580
 He is very heavy, by the way, it 's more 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:47.860
 heavy than normal 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:54.400
 let's go here too, why are you coming? 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:57.850
 here the highlight is the guide that the start 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:01.050
 and his rapid without further information 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:04.690
 everything we already know the boss aside 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:08.640
 the right color guarantee some 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.640
 warranty information and quito do march 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:15.370
 paperback that gives assurance that I left 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:16.390
 to fall, the president guaranteed nothing much 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:25.860
 different from what we're used to 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:30.250
 to see the box below we do not have anything else 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:32.470
 we have only our supporter here 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.870
 wrist that it is detachable from the keyboard 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:38.560
 here he is a wrist support of the 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:40.420
 keyboard can dock on front keyboard 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.180
 the pulse appears while you are 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:45.400
 typing or when you are playing 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.350
 I have not tested with the then not 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.990
 Can I evaluate if I'm going to use it like this? 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.670
 He's going to have it so it does not have it. 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:54.160
 option to draw so I use it 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.900
 Let's see what it's like, I'll always get it. 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.700
 that the keyboard back to you 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.730
 Good. I'm going to have to leave the box. 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:05.170
 side just to finish our boxing 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:07.960
 here only to highlight here and can 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:10.360
 with two usb is if I'm not mistaken 

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:14.200
 one to logically connect a keyboard 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:16.330
 and the other is to connect a friend with a frog 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.470
 What is behind if I'm not mistaken? 

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:19.480
 I'm sure 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.910
 The keyboard cable seems to me a lot 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:24.360
 resistant because it is flexible that 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:28.270
 same time is not too much 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:32.080
 It is not very good and is not fragile but at 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:34.420
 same time it is not rigid understands and 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.520
 flexible when it needs to be and looks 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.330
 very sturdy clothing looks very 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.270
 resistant 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:45.340
 there that leap noise here we have 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:48.220
 the keys are maculam after custom 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.870
 and the 18 customizable screens within the 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.490
 software with saw that explains 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.280
 so cute on the river 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:57.340
 we anticipate a detail and details in 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.780
 aluminum brushed the edges of the 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:02.050
 keyboard 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.640
 from the upper side in the whole 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.220
 brushed aluminum 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:08.890
 here we also have control of 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:13.420
 volume of the next one here for you 

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:15.550
 better see the volume control the 

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:17.350
 volume control is good here in focus if 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:20.290
 can see the brushed aluminum here is 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:23.470
 very beautiful, we also have a 

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:29.380
 multimedia control over the ipad has 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:32.350
 a multimedia control only highlighting 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:35.110
 here all the keys are sheri shwed 

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:38.350
 as I said before and clothes already 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:42.130

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:45.840

 focus again let's go 

00:05:46.489 --> 00:05:52.139
 here we have it 

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:53.429
 The drawing I said I think 

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:56.429
 It's an honor and I do not know 

00:05:53.429 --> 00:06:00.089
 and we have here also the time selector 

00:05:56.429 --> 00:06:03.629

 2000 and seconds and 46 seconds and 86 

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:08.699
 seconds and here has risen are still in the 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:10.709
 is proper to an amendment and I do not 

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:21.079
 being what this bios option is for 

00:06:10.709 --> 00:06:25.139
