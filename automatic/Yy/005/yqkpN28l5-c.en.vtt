 hello today I bring you another tutorial this 

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:07.789
 It will be Smurfette and the materials 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:11.430
 cold porcelain paints white glue 

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:14.460
 modeling tools and a 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:16.980
 and the procedure we're going to make mass of 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.630
 blue color and let's make a sphere the 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.000
 which are we going to crush a bit of this 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:25.700
 way to get what would be his nose 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.700
 and the cheeks to the head 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.309
 and we would have something like that in the part of 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:39.070
 where is chubby we are going to do the 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:39.070
 mouth with a star or a blade 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:45.190
 and is not doing something like that 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.110
 let's make a little ball 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.370
 little one and we're going to put it down for 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.079
 simulate the neck 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.210
 the dress with white monzÃ³ 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:55.500
 let's make a kind of cone no 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.500
 let's crush a little bit 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.390
 and I 'm going to match the bottom part 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.390
 I'm going to cut it 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.630
 and with a wire so that this is 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:14.329
 well united 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.329
 let's stick it to your head 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.000
 let's make her legs 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:25.330
 and the foot we are going to take a little 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.530
 let's make the shoe is like a 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.170
 droplet let's crush white 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:48.290
 and with a tool we are going to sink a 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.920
 little to put the foot that we had 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:54.890
 fact 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.890
 and we are going to put the heel with a ball 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.229
 we would have something like that let's do the 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.740
 two and we're going to paste them with the friend to 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:02.740
 dress 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.470
 let's bend the foot a little 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.500
 or the leg 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.030
 and we are going to put a ball in the 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.160
 face to simulate the nose now 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.790
 we will do in the skirt we will crush 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:26.879
 good mass of white color 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.659
 let's match the one we have left in 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:29.659
 rectangular shape 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.420
 and let's go 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:48.370
 will begin to make the feet to the dress 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.370
 it's like bending in a zigzag 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.490
 at the top and we will go 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.490
 crushing 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:59.300
 to match 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:01.070
 and we are going to go zigzagging all the 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.580
 dress and crushing the single part of 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.680
 above 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:09.800
 so that it forms you ask in the dress 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.800
 that's what we're going to do with the whole strip 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.430
 and we would be something we will 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.820
 match the top part and we're going 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.820
 to paste 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.739
 and on the top 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:29.650
 in front and behind the union lo y os 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:31.800
 I'm going to do it back so it does not stop 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.930
 less noticeable 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.460
 you're just going to cut the leftovers and 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:39.140
 let's do the arms and almost the same 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:39.140
 that two legs the rings 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:45.040
 let's take out the palm and let's do 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:47.780
 three cuts to form four of them 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.480
 and we're going to stick it to the sides 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.760
 Now to make the hair with dough 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.900
 yellow color let's make kind of 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:59.879
 little worms 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:01.620
 and we are going to crush and color this ko 

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:03.629
 a stick can be just going to 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.840
 make it as uncut hairlines 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:09.180
 just mark it so it looks like 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.640
 if it were real hair 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.270
 and we are going to peel this I am very 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:16.000
 long but good 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:17.639
 and we're going to fix it and let's go 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.219
 hitting 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:22.250
 of these appointments by up to cover all the 

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:25.450
 head 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.450
 we would have something like that 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:31.949
 and I would be almost ready now 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:34.590
 simply missing the hat that 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:36.050
 It is a droplet with the most bent tip 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.670
 down 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:41.210
 White color 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:43.550
 not only are we going to have it in our heads 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:46.900
 Now you paint your eyes, you put a 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.900
 Haitian and it would be ready 

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:59.259
