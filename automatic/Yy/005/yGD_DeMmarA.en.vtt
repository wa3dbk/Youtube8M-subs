00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:06.649
 accident caused by gases 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.400
 pollutants that cause 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:12.190
 global warming 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.219
 from that moment your life will change for

 charles arturo energy resources 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:23.470
 of the earth are rapidly depleting and 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:26.439
 the planet is chaos its mission 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:31.629
 It will increase energy efficiency 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:36.270
 from now on you will be your dog recharged on 

00:00:31.629 --> 00:00:36.270
 champion of sustainable energy 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:43.100
 teacher I have the recipe ready 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:46.310
 will revolutionize seafood gastronomy 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.500
 gray wing chicken legs in sauce 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:50.540
 of pepper more to me do not tell me more 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.210
 silver and hands to the pot what 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:56.420
 ingredients we need we need 3 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.900
 pounds of chicken legs 5 peppers 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:03.379
 amazonians a radish of sibundoy 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:07.600
 Siberian coriander coriander we do not have 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.600
 none of that do market promptly 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.830
 to version already did the school tasks 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.420
 I always have nothing to do 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.370
 perhaps he has an exciting mission for me 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.110
 I must save the world to disarm a bomb 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.940
 nuclear travel into a volcano 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.860
 what this has for me will be the most 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.320
 exciting of his missions to nelson 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.420
 I need the restaurant to be well 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.850
 clean and bright for the launch 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:32.500
 of the new dish for supposedly profess 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.500
 what an exciting mission 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.640
 for you teacher I already have the peppers 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:45.290
 Amazonian although the truth is expensive 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.290
 it must be that they are not in harvest 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.790
 everything is to prepare the best legs 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:56.070
 de gallina wings grayales attention 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.810
 teacher we have an emergency it's about 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.520
 of the superheroes who under his identity 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.190
 secret are committing a case 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.840
 energetic attack that is inconceivable 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:06.540
 jÃ¡milson where are those 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.850
 very great miscreants to stop them 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.700
 immediately professed the most serious thing is 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.100
 that the miscreants are not there but if 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.120
 We are only buying food 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.709
 precisely to professor as we see that 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.450
 does not understand save to let it 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.239
 transform you must make a trip to 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.190
 seville hamilton informs us that we are 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:25.290
 making an error when making the market 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:29.820
 we must investigate this is a mission 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:35.300
 for the professor xu but recharged and the 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:35.300
 sevillista with alacrity to the cebiche but 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.599
 teacher to read the some duties 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.189
 more in a long journey from the 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:43.170
 grow up your table and this represents 

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:44.879
 a great energy expenditure so that I 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.489
 understand it is necessary that you would say 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:48.959
 catch each of the Amazonian pepper and 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.030
 talk to is each of your 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:53.670
 growers 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.560
 Professor farming methods vary 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.930
 according to the vegetable that was sown 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.000
 but in general terms first 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.400
 let's make the land then sow the 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.740
 seeds that should be watered so that 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.930
 grow with the help of the sun as it appears 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.330
 in said these must be fumigated for 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.580
 that do not eat the magical ones and finally 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.610
 we harvest up here I do not see any 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.739
 poor energetic spending professor not yet 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.050
 ends the vichy process after the 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:21.120
 harvest we must pack the vegetables and 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.440
 upload them to the truck observe all the 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.450
 energy that has been consumed has been 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.950
 grace still missing more teacher follow in 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.930
 that truck when they reach their destination 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.430
 the supplies are stored and 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.410
 refrigerated these contents 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.239
 increasing the energy expenditure in the 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.430
 products that you buy have 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:37.260
 the whole reason for good I already understood 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.150
 our mistake then the customer buys 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.100
 The food is transported to your home 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.989
 and refrigerate them again until 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.640
 finally consume them is a lot 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:47.400
 energy that is spent to carry a 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.410
 products to the jÃ¡milson table we need 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.959
 solutions we can not keep wasting 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.190
 energy in this quiet way mom already 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:56.280
 I'm investigating a 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:58.410
 alternative we are in contact 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.510
 the solution to not spend so much energy 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.640
 with the acquisition of food 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.500
 it is very easy to be quiet because of its appearance 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.050
 emaciated it seems to me that their solutions 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:10.080
 stop eating teacher are wrong 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:13.410
 every healthy organism needs to feed 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:16.139
 that is why I propose a diet rich in 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:18.660
 Nail-based iron nails are 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:21.269
 they get very easily magic in 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:29.540
 any part so do not lose 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:29.540
 energy look for it are also very rich 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:34.790
 teacher we need an alternative 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.890
 would be if we do not get food that 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:39.320
 demand little energy expenditure until 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:41.150
 it could be the end of seafood attention 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.680
 teacher go to three black moscow's 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.600
 elephant to the southeast of its position 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.640
 there you will find and say a child who has 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:50.330
 a great solution to fight for 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:53.270
 energy efficiency 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:56.780
 teacher in my house we have a small 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:57.830
 vegetable garden where we grow carrots and 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.810
 peas 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:02.360
 in this way we consume these 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:05.030
 fresh foods and spending the minimum 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:07.129
 of energy but as well boy Cyril 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:10.099
 you only eat carrots 

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:12.289
 garlic and peas a silver already also 

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:14.810
 we buy other foods in the market 

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:16.580
 but we buy those that are grown 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:18.560
 in near our city and they are 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.930
 in season so we know that no 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:24.530
 they require higher transport costs and 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:26.360
 storage and great idea to Cyril and 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:28.099
 girl we must change the menu of the 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.409
 seafood to offer food from 

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:32.930
 season so for the moment the 

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:35.750
 crows feet were canceled to 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:37.729
 not that we throw the vegetables in 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:40.099
 our garden but if we do not 

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:43.569
 we have a teacher garden we will have it 

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:43.569
 Semitic we will have it 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:49.680
 it looks girl as we go we have increased 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:53.750
 the energy efficiency indices a 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.750
 we have met
