00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.759
 work and worth it 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.859
 Today I will give you real ones 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.029
 Tibetan practices we have them today all 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.520
 together we will do 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.680
 and then see how much life 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.529
 you guys will change when you get tired 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.869
 at work what you need to do here 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.760
 look i'm tired very much at work 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.340
 and me after that read a seminar not 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.290
 want it right if i don't want 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.270
 seminar people do not want to read it 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.460
 listen if people don't want it 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.410
 listen then people are the second time no one 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.290
 will lead and will not come agree with 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.660
 by this it will naturally affect 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.000
 bad my business until tomorrow people are not 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.090
 will come when a person gets into conditions 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.680
 when it is hard for him to do business 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.989
 falls or that's what happens 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.690
 a vicious circle which is somewhere connected here 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.090
 what can I not do my business 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.940
 but I need it because i need 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.339
 i'm big i make myself do it 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.770
 much faster right this is the 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.979
 the main mistake if you're tired of your 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:14.189
 business pause and take a break from it 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.350
 and that's why full hockey was shown 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.470
 a man who smiles and keeps on 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.659
 the hands of children have seen yes why is he in theory 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.790
 should bring money because 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.460
 man must never forget that 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.740
 he should enjoy life 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.360
 because his face is absolutely human 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.000
 who received already from life 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.670
 the pleasure of a fat big buddha 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.920
 who sits and stroked the children and his rushing 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.950
 from all pokemon frank loud 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.540
 laughs properly if you teach life 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.369
 your so and so just getting 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.130
 pleasure and tie it 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.140
 pleasure and happiness to the state of money 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.360
 then money will be attracted by 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.850
 to give pleasure guys 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.189
 when it's not only left that itches 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.860
 hand write have fun pasa 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.140
 any manifestation of pleasure if it has 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.119
 binding to money will bring life 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.369
 money today I have to tell 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:08.399
 before i start giving techniques 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.619
 such a general energy energy it can 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.290
 to be united what is it well here 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.019
 roughly i have a state 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.420
 depressed my depression state she 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:19.760
 rude tortures me in the middle from where she is 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.799
 is taken you know but Buddhists or those 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.069
 people who are engaged in energy they 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:27.980
 believed that the energy is faceless she 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:31.010
 out of control and look 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.840
 energy electricity is in the sky she 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.390
 there is in the sky it is created as 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.310
 discharges there are fields of water and right but 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.319
 we can't manage it why 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.620
 fallen, we can not take it in volume 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:43.760
 some kind of right but if this energy 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.430
 run or somehow work out and 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.829
 run it as semiconductors there 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.349
 then she can manage it already 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:53.540
 so to start working with 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:54.799
 certain energy you need to take it in 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.169
 some kind of shell 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:59.689
 understand why I tell you all this 

00:02:57.169 --> 00:03:02.000
 today we will perform practices 

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:04.489
 which are called practice yaman taki 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.250
 what is this practice yaman taki 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:10.609
 according to the Tibetan tradition this practice 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:13.250
 when a man invokes an angry deity 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:15.470
 further during the second practice that we 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.840
 should make we present ourselves yaman 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.819
 so after this make ritual 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.180
 practice and imagine matt 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:24.739
 angry deity what i will say 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.799
 after when we do this we 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:30.169
 must change the image we present ourselves 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:32.750
 next angry deity who 

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:35.650
 called manjushri we will have to 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.849
 present yourself as a very handsome man 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.919
 after that when we imagine 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:42.440
 manjushri we will have to submit 

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:45.229
 yourself father of all money which is called 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.030
 deputy was a practice which we will 

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:50.000
 do so ontaku arranged according to the principle 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:53.060
 how can i fear my mom if she 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.500
 my mom how can I fear my hand 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.319
 if she is my hand 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.510
 that is, we make it part of us you 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:01.489
 understand you say now will not attract 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.379
 Is it in our life and this problem 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:06.760
 guys are you so wrong 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:09.919
 we live in a position where all energy is equal 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:12.859
 at the same time if you already have this then you 

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:14.870
 from this calm down understand this 

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:16.220
 practice ontaku schemes will allow forever 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:19.459
 get rid of fear 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:21.269
 and also get rid of indecision he 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.819

00:04:23.819 --> 00:04:29.639
 shareholders and hum hum hum for now 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.229
 pronounced very softly and easily but 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:35.370
 when you say it in your head 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:37.740
 clicks it can be read 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:40.620
 separately because it is a mantra 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:43.949
 forever saves a person from feeling 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:45.650
 hunger fear and turns u seagull 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:48.539
 state of courage and determination 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:51.780
 after that when I read it I must 

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:54.389
 imagine my face was young 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:57.630
 that is, I transformed and my body 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:05:00.750
 also became young and in my hand 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:03.030
 a sword of fire appeared I imagine 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:05.039
 like i fiery such a deity 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:07.500

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:26.789
 as well as there practice that you 

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:29.009
 now it looks like this 

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:31.259
 that is, it is the end result of this 

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:33.930
 practitioners see a creature that 

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:36.870
 is here a description of this practice 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:39.960

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:42.029
 also symbols there are symbols of success and so 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.279
 further there like here everywhere given 

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:47.099
 explanations of how to do this in the form of 

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:49.349
 ritual practice us ritual he himself is not 

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:52.319
 needed because we work it through 

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:54.120
 connection which i give lung yes and this 

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:56.759

 the result is what we have to present ourselves 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:14.330
 You see such an angry deity 

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:17.219
