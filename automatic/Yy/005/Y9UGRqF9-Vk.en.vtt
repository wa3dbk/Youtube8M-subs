00:00:00.659 --> 00:00:02.620
 and so leaders with comment 

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:03.900
 what it is 

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:05.040
 attachments with comment 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.110
 allows the driver to train himself 

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.430
 recognize hazards and risks by 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:11.179
 road early 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:14.579
 How does this happen 

00:00:14.579 --> 00:00:17.240
 we begin movement including transfer 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.519
 but rear-view mirrors 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:21.509
 I see that allowed me to go 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:23.849
 Tymoshenko is easy to turn on 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:26.289
 necessarily control high 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:28.359
 he was counted and begins his 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:31.489
 motion 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:33.179
 on the winter road the most important factor 

00:00:33.179 --> 00:00:34.500
 of success 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.240
 correct analysis 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.240
 paving ratio 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.250
 all monkey snow standards 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.480
 I'm pretty dangerous and slippery 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.730
 before leaving for your chances for me was 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:47.630
 the most important is that 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.440
 to move the car only 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.900
 after that i start to look left 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.570
 there is in the absence of transport from the first 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.210
 which can not prevent 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.890
 we leave immediately all the places to build 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.160
 in the left lane because it is more 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.140
 rationally cars ahead 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.750
 It serves me as a danger 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.010
 hides a lot of information from where 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.010
 drivers may appear 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.730
 pedestrian annually and so on 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.030
 Now I try for them as much as possible 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.980
 away to appreciate your 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.800
 position on the road place for me yet 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.800
 this ancient self enough 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.820
 national perplexity prevents them 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.440
 Coast of the house hall Chanel with speed 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:30.500
 flow 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.650
 ahead I see a stop at which 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.360
 there are people the idea of ​​the one who is what I 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.200
 noticed that it is very important 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.610
 after that there will be little back 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.250
 i'm not rearranging i turn on 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:44.780
 I estimate the situation right mirror 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.880
 overseas bewilderment did not fit between me 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.180
 moves pedestrians in front who suddenly 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.190
 appeared slowing down before opening 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.290
 same road narrowing and snow verges 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.940
 which narrowed her 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.870
 This is a very important point because we are with 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.310
 work schedule and not necessarily bandera 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.980
 car handling can 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:04.940
 to threaten 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.330
 ahead I see a sharp turnaround 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.229
 descent passed descent down especially in winter 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.700
 it is extremely dangerous because as 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.600
 the rule here are legs 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.760
 you can't even count 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.040
 expect that the road will be 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.070
 everywhere car reagents where day 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.260
 insuring yourself in advance personal right and how 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.700
 possible earlier so that not only 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.690
 stop however these machines which 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.340
 changed and by the way I see it and 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.089
 suspend his control 

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:34.659
 motorway stop on 

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:37.009
 where we are somewhere else sweden nobody 

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:38.800
 postwar exists 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.109
 in its absence 

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:43.539
 now it is not there, I think that the movement 

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:46.539
 farther 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:50.230
 trees where they said no to the left and 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.559
 for a long time apparently she sings on the rights 

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:53.660
 behind 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.040
 and the curb of the world was to make a comedy 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.639
 standing pedestrian 

00:02:57.639 --> 00:02:59.419
 photo he's right 

00:02:59.419 --> 00:03:00.699
 I see a pedestrian who 

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:02.909
 he is moving far enough 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:04.809
 nevertheless reducing the speed of the bureau a little 

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:07.269
 to the left in order to be trusted that we tell him 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:09.739
 I will not see him in front 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:12.999
 traffic lights leaving cars in reverse 

00:03:12.999 --> 00:03:15.779
 dimensions me or not so I do not accept 

00:03:15.779 --> 00:03:18.339
 gambling zones caution action 

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:20.489
 conversation workshop I drive up and 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:21.609
 counting on the green signal 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:24.819
 traffic light i will drop but nevertheless i am ready 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:27.479
 if it does not catch fire and tourism on yellow 

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:30.039
 red stay benefits for this i was 

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:32.289
 happy as early as possible ooo rosar 

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:33.509
 we will go to hell
