00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
valve for my washing machine now there's

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.680 
valve for my washing machine now there's
been<00:00:08.490> a<00:00:08.550> lot<00:00:08.730> of<00:00:08.760> water<00:00:09.179> damage

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
been a lot of water damage

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.190 
been a lot of water damage
the<00:00:09.960> previous<00:00:10.679> owner<00:00:11.120> rigs<00:00:12.120> some<00:00:12.509> lying

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
the previous owner rigs some lying

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.110 
the previous owner rigs some lying
together<00:00:13.500> that<00:00:13.740> was<00:00:13.830> made<00:00:13.980> out<00:00:14.009> of<00:00:14.160> the

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
together that was made out of the

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.529 
together that was made out of the
natural<00:00:15.960> gas<00:00:16.190> type<00:00:17.190> piping<00:00:17.760> so<00:00:17.970> it<00:00:18.090> rusted

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
natural gas type piping so it rusted

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.890 
natural gas type piping so it rusted
corroded<00:00:18.779> plenty<00:00:19.770> of<00:00:19.859> water<00:00:20.130> damage<00:00:21.119> to<00:00:21.779> the

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
corroded plenty of water damage to the

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.370 
corroded plenty of water damage to the
drywall<00:00:22.550> so<00:00:23.550> I<00:00:23.609> replaced<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.180> valve<00:00:24.210> once<00:00:24.660> and

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
drywall so I replaced the valve once and

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.820 
drywall so I replaced the valve once and
not<00:00:25.590> quite<00:00:25.800> a<00:00:25.890> year<00:00:25.949> ago<00:00:26.340> but<00:00:27.260> it<00:00:28.260> started

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
not quite a year ago but it started

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.130 
not quite a year ago but it started
leaking<00:00:29.070> so<00:00:29.849> I'm<00:00:30.300> going<00:00:30.449> to<00:00:30.480> go<00:00:30.599> ahead<00:00:30.689> and

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
leaking so I'm going to go ahead and

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.870 
leaking so I'm going to go ahead and
replace<00:00:31.529> it<00:00:31.800> wasn't<00:00:32.099> leaking<00:00:32.399> where<00:00:32.730> it

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
replace it wasn't leaking where it

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.750 
replace it wasn't leaking where it
connects<00:00:33.390> but<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.750> actual<00:00:34.079> valve<00:00:34.260> itself<00:00:34.760> was

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
connects but the actual valve itself was

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.450 
connects but the actual valve itself was
leaking<00:00:36.360> so<00:00:36.690> I've<00:00:37.320> gone<00:00:37.440> ahead<00:00:37.590> I've<00:00:38.280> actually

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
leaking so I've gone ahead I've actually

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.040 
leaking so I've gone ahead I've actually
taken<00:00:38.730> it<00:00:38.940> off<00:00:39.059> once<00:00:39.329> already<00:00:39.450> but<00:00:39.809> I<00:00:39.840> thought

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
taken it off once already but I thought

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.680 
taken it off once already but I thought
I<00:00:40.200> might<00:00:40.469> as<00:00:40.590> well<00:00:40.680> do<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:40.950> video<00:00:41.190> on<00:00:41.309> it<00:00:41.510> so<00:00:42.510> I've

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
I might as well do a video on it so I've

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:43.130 
I might as well do a video on it so I've
gone<00:00:42.840> ahead

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
gone ahead

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.610 
gone ahead
I've<00:00:43.320> taken<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.770> hose<00:00:43.950> off<00:00:45.050> just<00:00:46.050> for<00:00:46.559> the

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
I've taken the hose off just for the

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.420 
I've taken the hose off just for the
water<00:00:46.800> line<00:00:47.129> into<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.090> washing<00:00:48.510> machine<00:00:48.539> and

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:49.430 
water line into the washing machine and

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.950 
water line into the washing machine and
I'm<00:00:50.430> going<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:50.610> be<00:00:50.730> using<00:00:50.879> I<00:00:51.300> have<00:00:51.660> a<00:00:51.719> pipe

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
I'm going to be using I have a pipe

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.740 
I'm going to be using I have a pipe
wrench<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.620> then<00:00:54.140> my<00:00:55.160> channel<00:00:56.160> locks<00:00:56.660> kind<00:00:57.660> of

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
wrench and then my channel locks kind of

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.729 
wrench and then my channel locks kind of
the<00:00:57.809> blue<00:00:58.039> nice<00:00:59.039> big<00:00:59.370> ones<00:01:00.320> and<00:01:01.320> you<00:01:01.500> want<00:01:01.680> to

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
the blue nice big ones and you want to

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.980 
the blue nice big ones and you want to
use<00:01:01.859> two<00:01:04.010> and<00:01:05.090> I<00:01:06.090> ended<00:01:06.270> up<00:01:06.390> putting<00:01:06.630> one<00:01:06.960> on

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
use two and I ended up putting one on

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.120 
use two and I ended up putting one on
the<00:01:07.770> right<00:01:08.640> side<00:01:09.020> then<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.530> channel<00:01:10.950> lock

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
the right side then the channel lock

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:19.340 
the right side then the channel lock
would<00:01:11.400> go<00:01:11.880> on<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.150> left<00:01:16.189> and<00:01:18.080> righty<00:01:19.080> tighty

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
would go on the left and righty tighty

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.690 
would go on the left and righty tighty
lefty<00:01:19.530> loosy<00:01:20.220> holding<00:01:21.030> this<00:01:21.180> down<00:01:21.479> spinning

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
lefty loosy holding this down spinning

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.210 
lefty loosy holding this down spinning
so<00:01:23.700> then<00:01:23.850> you<00:01:24.030> can<00:01:24.210> go<00:01:24.390> ahead<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.960> unscrew<00:01:25.220> the

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
so then you can go ahead and unscrew the

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.319 
so then you can go ahead and unscrew the
defective<00:01:27.470> valve<00:01:28.470> so<00:01:29.400> now<00:01:29.579> I<00:01:29.610> have<00:01:29.970> some<00:01:30.180> blue

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
defective valve so now I have some blue

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.120

recommend<00:01:42.420> using<00:01:42.899> one<00:01:43.049> or<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:44.070> other<00:01:44.220> either

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
recommend using one or the other either

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.819 
recommend using one or the other either
weighs<00:01:45.060> fine<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.750> goal<00:01:45.899> is<00:01:46.110> for<00:01:46.140> it<00:01:46.500> not<00:01:46.530> to

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
weighs fine the goal is for it not to

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.179 
weighs fine the goal is for it not to
leak<00:01:47.780> I've<00:01:48.780> used<00:01:49.170> both<00:01:49.380> I've<00:01:49.740> had<00:01:50.009> other

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
leak I've used both I've had other

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.160 
leak I've used both I've had other
plumbers<00:01:50.490> say<00:01:50.759> these<00:01:50.970> both<00:01:51.360> it's<00:01:51.930> all

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
plumbers say these both it's all

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.340 
plumbers say these both it's all
preference<00:01:53.479> you<00:01:54.479> know<00:01:54.509> one<00:01:54.899> will<00:01:55.049> say<00:01:55.200> the

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
preference you know one will say the

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.100 
preference you know one will say the
other<00:01:55.380> is<00:01:55.680> right<00:01:55.950> or<00:01:56.130> wrong<00:01:56.310> so<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:57.689> goal<00:01:57.869> for

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
other is right or wrong so the goal for

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.080 
other is right or wrong so the goal for
it<00:01:58.619> not<00:01:58.710> to<00:01:58.770> leak<00:01:59.009> I've<00:01:59.189> had<00:01:59.399> success<00:01:59.759> doing<00:01:59.790> it

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
it not to leak I've had success doing it

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.539 
it not to leak I've had success doing it
this<00:02:00.210> way<00:02:00.710> so<00:02:01.710> that's<00:02:01.890> how<00:02:02.009> I'm<00:02:02.130> going<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.369> do
