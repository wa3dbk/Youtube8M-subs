level<00:00:19.680> ground<00:00:19.710> right<00:00:20.250> now<00:00:20.660> just<00:00:21.660> get<00:00:21.810> them

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
level ground right now just get them

level ground right now just get them
over<00:00:22.109> here<00:00:22.260> and<00:00:22.680> then<00:00:23.430> I'm<00:00:24.269> going<00:00:24.630> to<00:00:24.779> start<00:00:25.529> it

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
over here and then I'm going to start it

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.970 
over here and then I'm going to start it
up<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:25.980> then<00:00:26.279> I'm<00:00:26.490> going<00:00:26.880> to<00:00:27.439> stop<00:00:28.439> on<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.859> way

down the hill and then try to start it

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.650 
down the hill and then try to start it
again<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.489> demonstrate<00:00:33.120> what's<00:00:33.270> going<00:00:33.510> on

again to demonstrate what's going on
with<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:33.870> gages<00:00:41.540> try<00:00:42.540> that<00:00:42.750> again<00:00:42.840> without

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
with the gages try that again without

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:53.939 
with the gages try that again without
pumping<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.739> gas<00:00:48.559> yes<00:00:49.559> well

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:58.560 

all<00:00:54.399> right<00:00:54.640> and<00:00:54.910> it's<00:00:55.059> going<00:00:55.300> to<00:00:55.449> stall<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:58.329> I

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
all right and it's going to stall and I

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.889 
all right and it's going to stall and I
come<00:00:58.809> down<00:00:59.019> this<00:00:59.289> hill<00:00:59.829> in<00:01:00.190> a<00:01:00.280> moment<00:01:00.899> it

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:01.899 
come down this hill in a moment it

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:05.189 
come down this hill in a moment it
breaks<00:01:02.350> on<00:01:02.909> your<00:01:03.909> installed<00:01:04.420> I'm<00:01:04.689> still<00:01:04.960> level

breaks on your installed I'm still level
ground<00:01:06.000> coast<00:01:07.000> a<00:01:07.149> little<00:01:07.180> bit

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.260 

we're<00:01:21.229> just<00:01:21.590> nudging<00:01:22.100> just<00:01:22.610> a<00:01:22.790> little<00:01:23.119> bit

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
we're just nudging just a little bit

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.300 
we're just nudging just a little bit
downhill<00:01:23.540> so<00:01:24.229> we'll<00:01:24.380> continue<00:01:24.560> on<00:01:25.009> a<00:01:25.040> little

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
downhill so we'll continue on a little

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.910 
downhill so we'll continue on a little

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
bit in neutral and what I've gotten used

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.770 
bit in neutral and what I've gotten used
to<00:01:31.039> doing<00:01:31.250> a<00:01:31.399> little<00:01:31.610> bit<00:01:31.820> giving<00:01:32.240> it<00:01:32.329> a<00:01:32.420> little

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
to doing a little bit giving it a little

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.950 
to doing a little bit giving it a little
fuel<00:01:33.170> little<00:01:33.560> throttle<00:01:34.000> see<00:01:35.000> about<00:01:35.329> what's

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
fuel little throttle see about what's

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.020 
fuel little throttle see about what's
going<00:01:36.289> on<00:01:36.409> here<00:01:36.590> now<00:01:36.799> try<00:01:37.220> to<00:01:37.250> start<00:01:37.729> it<00:01:37.820> we're

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
going on here now try to start it we're

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.800 
going on here now try to start it we're
probably<00:01:38.750> at<00:01:38.929> about<00:01:39.140> a<00:01:39.429> 10<00:01:40.429> maybe<00:01:40.939> 15<00:01:41.240> degree

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810

probably at about a 10 maybe 15 degree
downhill<00:01:42.259> probably<00:01:42.590> closer<00:01:42.799> to<00:01:42.979> 10<00:01:46.119> nothing

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
downhill probably closer to 10 nothing

downhill probably closer to 10 nothing
you<00:01:47.270> can<00:01:47.450> see<00:01:47.689> that<00:01:47.990> the<00:01:48.140> tack<00:01:48.380> is<00:01:48.679> starting<00:01:49.100> to

00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:49.539 
you can see that the tack is starting to

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:56.830 
you can see that the tack is starting to
to<00:01:50.539> go<00:01:50.720> about<00:01:50.929> 200<00:01:51.500> rpm<00:01:55.030> okay<00:01:56.030> now<00:01:56.630> I'm<00:01:56.720> going

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
to go about 200 rpm okay now I'm going

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.559 
to go about 200 rpm okay now I'm going
to<00:01:56.959> give<00:01:57.110> it<00:01:57.200> a<00:01:57.259> little<00:01:57.670> fuel<00:01:58.670> while<00:01:59.209> I<00:01:59.270> try<00:01:59.509> to

00:01:59.559 --> 00:01:59.569 
to give it a little fuel while I try to

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:04.870 
to give it a little fuel while I try to
start<00:02:02.170> still<00:02:03.170> nothing<00:02:03.560> there<00:02:04.189> Coast<00:02:04.580> down<00:02:04.850> a

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
start still nothing there Coast down a

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.490 
start still nothing there Coast down a
little<00:02:05.179> bit<00:02:05.390> here<00:02:05.689> carefully<00:02:08.049> I'm<00:02:09.049> trying<00:02:09.380> to

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
little bit here carefully I'm trying to

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.380 
little bit here carefully I'm trying to
steer<00:02:09.830> almost<00:02:10.789> down<00:02:11.000> the<00:02:11.180> hill<00:02:11.360> here<00:02:13.360> make<00:02:14.360> a

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
steer almost down the hill here make a

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:26.949 
steer almost down the hill here make a
little<00:02:14.690> bit<00:02:15.140> of<00:02:15.170> a<00:02:15.349> turn<00:02:18.069> even<00:02:19.069> level<00:02:19.610> out<00:02:25.959> and

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
little bit of a turn even level out and

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:28.660 
little bit of a turn even level out and
leveled<00:02:27.410> out<00:02:27.530> try<00:02:28.130> it<00:02:28.160> again

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
leveled out try it again

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:34.220 
leveled out try it again
no<00:02:29.420> fuel<00:02:31.989> starts<00:02:32.989> right<00:02:33.170> up

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
no fuel starts right up

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:44.789 
no fuel starts right up
so<00:02:35.819> something<00:02:41.610> it's<00:02:42.610> my<00:02:42.819> boy<00:02:43.060> in<00:02:43.239> the<00:02:43.360> back<00:02:43.799> so

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:44.799 
so something it's my boy in the back so

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:47.940 
so something it's my boy in the back so
something<00:02:45.370> definitely<00:02:45.849> has<00:02:46.629> to<00:02:46.930> do<00:02:47.140> with<00:02:47.440> the

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
something definitely has to do with the

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:53.290 
something definitely has to do with the
angle

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:54.880 

so

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
so

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.160 
so
see<00:02:55.400> we<00:02:55.640> can<00:02:55.790> find<00:02:56.090> out<00:02:56.300> I<00:02:56.330> did<00:02:56.690> capture<00:02:56.960> some

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
see we can find out I did capture some

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.250 
see we can find out I did capture some
auto<00:02:57.680> ingenuity<00:02:58.370> see<00:02:59.360> if<00:02:59.480> I<00:02:59.630> can<00:02:59.810> get<00:03:00.050> anything

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
auto ingenuity see if I can get anything

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.470 
auto ingenuity see if I can get anything
that's<00:03:00.740> stalled<00:03:01.160> going<00:03:01.580> a<00:03:01.670> little<00:03:02.150> bit<00:03:02.270> of<00:03:02.390> an

that's stalled going a little bit of an

that's stalled going a little bit of an
incline<00:03:02.750> just<00:03:03.260> as<00:03:03.380> I<00:03:03.500> was<00:03:03.590> coming<00:03:03.800> up<00:03:04.040> to<00:03:04.220> a

incline just as I was coming up to a

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.930 
incline just as I was coming up to a
stop<00:03:04.520> oh<00:03:04.820> we<00:03:05.780> go
