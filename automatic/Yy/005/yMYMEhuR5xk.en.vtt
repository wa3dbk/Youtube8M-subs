00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.260
 structure where it was happening and 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.000

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.890
 and invest all the money we had 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.230
 saved to be able to have the

 thanks to the goals that I got the 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.950

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.570
 little as an investment and now then to 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.400

 made work with the Germans to 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.370
 principle was not easy we have 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:08.670
 very adapted to his way of working 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:12.360
 they are very professional they are very strict 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:16.380
 in your in your thoughts and there's only 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:19.220
 to see that they are people who have a level 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:22.160
 very high at the business level and that 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.990
 Really 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.640
 they have a lot of organization to do 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:27.440
 things and that's positive for 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.480
 we also because you always learn 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.520
 things the team offers me the possibility 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.490
 to bring me to my technical team my 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.080
 mechanics and so on so I feel myself 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:39.900
 I feel at home and the truth is that 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:42.689
 very comfortable in Spain 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.120
 and we have reached a bit to a limit not 

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:46.739
 we are the truth is that we are many 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.709
 Spaniards who are ahead of us in all 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:53.080
 the international championships so much 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:54.340
 motogp moto3 moto2 like 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.770
 as the championship of spain 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.330
 obviously and good at the end you have 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:01.870
 to look for your life outside you have to 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:04.590
 you have to show that you adapt to 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:07.099
 all kinds of circumstances 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.330
 even change brands not me 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:12.390
 debugging ducati when nobody 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.709
 I trusted the panigale and the truth is 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.519
 that is going very well I am very 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.890
 happy 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:18.810
 they have also trusted me a lot and 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.660
 in fact 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.849
 We work very closely with the 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:27.569
 factory on the subject of development of the 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:29.700
 motorcycle and that I'm glad they trust 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:32.670
 in me as much as I do as much as I in 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:35.459
 they motorcycle the most positive part that 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.500
 you have the motorcycle very handy 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:40.290
 allows to warm up very soon and brakes very 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.590
 late that is one of the points 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:46.560
 strong that I 've always wanted 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:49.170
 take advantage and are working hard what 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.930
 I know with the theme of dynamics and theme 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.549
 of the engine to be more competitive in 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.980
 especially in the superbike world 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:58.110
 but from this year or from last year to 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.790
 this one has improved a lot and it shows 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:02.010
 note quite considering that I 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.440
 championship game with my partner with 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.780
 max 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.870
 say that we have always been very 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:11.750
 cordial with each other we have 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:14.120
 laughed a lot together and in fact this 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:18.139
 paragraph that you see we share the three 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:21.169
 and then the arrival of lorenzo has 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:23.360
 added a touch of joy to the team 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:27.710
 because he is undoubtedly a very nice guy 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:29.389
 and if it does not stop making you laugh I do not 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.980
 like to be tied to the marked 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:34.710
 for many years 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:37.140
 and I think that for them it would also be 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:40.350
 a great idea I do not think there's 

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:42.810
 contributed a lot to much 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:45.060
 positivity the development of the motorcycle and 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:47.790
 I think they have also helped me 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.500
 much in my sports career because in 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.450
 these two years 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:54.650
 that is to say that the most victories I have 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:57.330
 got and where I have been most comfortable 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.560
 and closer to the factory I have felt 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.750
 so 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:04.139
 when you have that feeling with the brand and 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:06.719
 them with you then the truth 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:09.629
 it's not worth changing things today 

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:11.550
 in day they are very bad and when you have a 

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:13.439
 thing if you have to talk a lot and be 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:15.509
 very aware that not every day 

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:19.909
 opportunities like this are presented 

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:19.909
 that I will try to be for many years 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:43.429
