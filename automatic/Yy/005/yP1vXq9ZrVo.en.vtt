00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
to specify a range of displacements so

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.650 
to specify a range of displacements so
here<00:02:32.400> I've<00:02:32.520> specified<00:02:33.150> a<00:02:33.180> range<00:02:33.480> of

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
here I've specified a range of

here I've specified a range of

our<00:02:42.450> setup<00:02:42.840> we<00:02:42.870> can<00:02:42.990> see<00:02:43.290> there's<00:02:43.470> no<00:02:43.620> other

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
our setup we can see there's no other

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.400 
our setup we can see there's no other
menu<00:02:44.370> items<00:02:44.700> under<00:02:45.030> that<00:02:45.150> menu<00:02:45.420> so<00:02:45.750> we<00:02:46.110> would

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
menu items under that menu so we would

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.500 
menu items under that menu so we would
run<00:02:46.620> this<00:02:46.860> stability<00:02:47.280> analysis<00:02:47.580> in<00:02:48.360> the

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
run this stability analysis in the

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.870 
run this stability analysis in the
normal<00:02:48.840> way<00:02:49.020> it<00:02:49.800> takes<00:02:49.980> quite<00:02:50.220> some<00:02:50.520> time<00:02:50.850> to

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
normal way it takes quite some time to

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.060 
normal way it takes quite some time to
run<00:02:51.330> large<00:02:51.540> angle<00:02:51.960> stability<00:02:52.500> at<00:02:52.740> all<00:02:52.890> of

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
run large angle stability at all of

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.590 
run large angle stability at all of
those<00:02:53.190> different<00:02:53.640> displacements<00:02:54.390> and

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
those different displacements and

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.900 
those different displacements and
repeatedly<00:02:55.290> ranging<00:02:56.100> the<00:02:56.280> vertical<00:02:56.700> center

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910

repeatedly ranging the vertical center
of<00:02:57.030> gravity<00:02:57.510> so<00:02:58.200> I've<00:02:58.350> already<00:02:58.770> run<00:02:58.980> that<00:02:59.220> and

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
of gravity so I've already run that and

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.610 
of gravity so I've already run that and
we<00:02:59.700> can<00:02:59.880> now<00:03:00.000> move<00:03:00.240> to<00:03:00.300> the<00:03:00.510> results<00:03:00.990> table<00:03:01.260> and

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
we can now move to the results table and

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.340 
we can now move to the results table and
see<00:03:01.890> the<00:03:02.040> results<00:03:02.600> what<00:03:03.600> we'll<00:03:03.750> get<00:03:03.990> is<00:03:04.140> one

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
see the results what we'll get is one

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.440 
see the results what we'll get is one
row<00:03:04.590> on<00:03:04.620> the<00:03:04.860> table<00:03:05.280> for<00:03:05.460> each<00:03:05.580> displacement

row on the table for each displacement

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.020 
row on the table for each displacement
and<00:03:06.630> then<00:03:07.170> within<00:03:07.410> each<00:03:07.680> row<00:03:08.010> and<00:03:08.550> we'll<00:03:08.820> show

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
and then within each row and we'll show

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.240 
and then within each row and we'll show
the<00:03:09.180> results<00:03:09.630> of<00:03:09.750> the<00:03:09.840> analysis<00:03:10.410> so<00:03:10.920> we'll

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
the results of the analysis so we'll

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.520 
the results of the analysis so we'll
show<00:03:11.580> the<00:03:12.120> maximum<00:03:12.600> vertical<00:03:12.780> center<00:03:13.500> of

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
show the maximum vertical center of

show the maximum vertical center of
gravity<00:03:14.100> that<00:03:14.280> was<00:03:14.820> achieved<00:03:15.330> and<00:03:15.660> still<00:03:15.900> past

our kg varies or the lemon in kg varies

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.979 
our kg varies or the lemon in kg varies
at<00:03:41.010> the<00:03:41.160> range<00:03:41.400> of<00:03:41.580> displacements<00:03:42.420> and<00:03:42.870> you

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
at the range of displacements and you

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:44.180 
at the range of displacements and you
can<00:03:43.140> see<00:03:43.320> here<00:03:43.530> as<00:03:43.650> the<00:03:43.800> displacement

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
can see here as the displacement

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.540 
can see here as the displacement
increases<00:03:44.880> the<00:03:45.810> limiting<00:03:46.290> kg<00:03:46.830> decreases

somewhat<00:03:49.250> one<00:03:50.250> thing<00:03:50.459> you<00:03:50.550> should<00:03:50.790> note<00:03:51.090> is

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
somewhat one thing you should note is

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:52.940 
somewhat one thing you should note is
that<00:03:51.360> when<00:03:51.750> you<00:03:51.870> look<00:03:52.080> at<00:03:52.200> the<00:03:52.440> criteria

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
that when you look at the criteria

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.100 
that when you look at the criteria
results<00:03:53.760> window<00:03:53.970> you'll<00:03:54.360> actually<00:03:54.510> see<00:03:54.959> that

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
results window you'll actually see that

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.380 
results window you'll actually see that
the<00:03:55.230> criteria<00:03:55.830> results<00:03:56.310> say<00:03:56.580> not<00:03:56.880> analyzed

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
the criteria results say not analyzed

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.170 
the criteria results say not analyzed
and<00:03:57.780> that's<00:03:57.989> because<00:03:58.440> the<00:03:58.650> final<00:03:59.180> analysis

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
and that's because the final analysis

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.510 
and that's because the final analysis
run<00:04:00.480> may<00:04:00.780> not<00:04:00.959> necessarily<00:04:01.110> be<00:04:01.739> the<00:04:02.040> one<00:04:02.250> that

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:02.520 
run may not necessarily be the one that

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.080 
run may not necessarily be the one that
causes<00:04:02.850> the<00:04:03.720> limiting<00:04:04.620> kg<00:04:05.130> to<00:04:05.430> be<00:04:05.610> triggered

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
causes the limiting kg to be triggered

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.350 
causes the limiting kg to be triggered
so<00:04:06.840> if<00:04:07.200> you<00:04:07.350> want<00:04:07.650> to<00:04:07.890> take<00:04:08.520> your<00:04:08.670> results<00:04:09.180> and

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
so if you want to take your results and

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.510 
so if you want to take your results and
then<00:04:09.510> compare<00:04:10.170> them<00:04:10.380> to<00:04:10.410> a<00:04:10.560> normal<00:04:10.950> stability

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:11.520 
then compare them to a normal stability

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.300 
then compare them to a normal stability
analysis<00:04:11.760> an<00:04:12.570> easy<00:04:12.959> way<00:04:13.230> to<00:04:13.290> do<00:04:13.590> that<00:04:13.800> is<00:04:14.070> to

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
analysis an easy way to do that is to

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.039 
analysis an easy way to do that is to
choose<00:04:14.580> a<00:04:14.610> particular<00:04:14.880> displacement<00:04:15.570> and

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
choose a particular displacement and

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:17.479 
choose a particular displacement and
let's<00:04:16.169> say<00:04:16.350> there's<00:04:16.590> three<00:04:16.799> thousand<00:04:17.280> tons

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
let's say there's three thousand tons

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:21.190 
let's say there's three thousand tons
and<00:04:17.940> select<00:04:18.870> the<00:04:19.320> CG<00:04:19.799> values<00:04:20.280> in<00:04:20.549> this<00:04:20.730> table

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
and select the CG values in this table

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.600 
and select the CG values in this table
then<00:04:22.200> you<00:04:22.320> can<00:04:22.470> switch<00:04:22.710> over<00:04:23.130> to<00:04:23.160> the<00:04:23.430> load

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
then you can switch over to the load

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.110 
then you can switch over to the load
case<00:04:23.880> window<00:04:24.470> create<00:04:25.470> a<00:04:25.530> new<00:04:25.800> load<00:04:26.039> case<00:04:26.370> and

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
case window create a new load case and

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.480 
case window create a new load case and
it'd<00:04:27.330> be<00:04:27.720> a<00:04:27.750> load<00:04:28.050> group<00:04:28.380> that<00:04:28.680> means<00:04:28.860> no<00:04:29.070> tanks

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
it'd be a load group that means no tanks

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:30.800 
it'd be a load group that means no tanks
