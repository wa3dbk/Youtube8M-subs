00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:02.040 
if you could pack all of human history

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.400 
if you could pack all of human history
into<00:00:02.700> one<00:00:02.909> year<00:00:03.240> we've<00:00:03.480> only<00:00:03.659> been<00:00:03.929> farming

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
into one year we've only been farming

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.710 
into one year we've only been farming
and<00:00:04.589> eating<00:00:04.920> grain<00:00:05.250> since<00:00:05.670> about<00:00:05.940> yesterday

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
and eating grain since about yesterday

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.330 
and eating grain since about yesterday
which<00:00:07.170> is<00:00:07.319> when<00:00:07.470> we<00:00:07.589> become<00:00:07.859> shorter<00:00:08.309> and

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
which is when we become shorter and

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.580 
which is when we become shorter and
fatter<00:00:08.700> we<00:00:09.599> only<00:00:09.750> started<00:00:10.230> consuming

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
fatter we only started consuming

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.860 
fatter we only started consuming
processed<00:00:11.340> vegetable<00:00:11.639> oils<00:00:12.269> about<00:00:12.540> 10

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
processed vegetable oils about 10

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.900 
processed vegetable oils about 10
minutes<00:00:13.110> ago<00:00:13.530> which<00:00:13.920> is<00:00:14.099> when<00:00:14.280> heart<00:00:14.549> disease

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
minutes ago which is when heart disease

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.150 
minutes ago which is when heart disease
became<00:00:15.330> our<00:00:15.509> number<00:00:15.780> one<00:00:15.960> killer<00:00:16.230> so<00:00:16.980> after

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
became our number one killer so after

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.700 
became our number one killer so after
examining<00:00:17.970> all<00:00:18.180> this<00:00:18.570> human<00:00:19.020> history<00:00:19.500> the

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
examining all this human history the

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.150 
examining all this human history the
experts<00:00:20.340> came<00:00:20.670> to<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.060> obvious<00:00:21.480> conclusion

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.160 
experts came to the obvious conclusion

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.040 
experts came to the obvious conclusion
we<00:00:23.160> need<00:00:23.400> to<00:00:23.519> eat<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:23.760> lot<00:00:24.090> more<00:00:24.330> of<00:00:24.480> these<00:00:24.660> and

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
we need to eat a lot more of these and

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.439 
we need to eat a lot more of these and
so<00:00:25.650> they<00:00:25.830> convinced<00:00:26.310> us<00:00:26.430> that<00:00:26.490> human<00:00:27.000> health

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
so they convinced us that human health

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.929 
so they convinced us that human health
depends<00:00:27.960> on<00:00:28.140> foods<00:00:28.470> we<00:00:28.830> didn't<00:00:29.250> eat<00:00:29.490> for<00:00:29.670> more

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
depends on foods we didn't eat for more
