then I was looking at it again I was

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.150 
then I was looking at it again I was
like<00:02:11.340> that's<00:02:11.580> not<00:02:11.790> 1.5<00:02:12.720> million

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
like that's not 1.5 million

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.710 
like that's not 1.5 million
there's<00:02:14.430> like<00:02:14.640> two<00:02:14.940> four<00:02:15.660> six<00:02:16.260> zeros<00:02:17.010> and<00:02:17.280> one

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
there's like two four six zeros and one

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.650 
there's like two four six zeros and one
one<00:02:18.720> and<00:02:18.870> a<00:02:18.990> five<00:02:19.290> that's<00:02:19.790> 15<00:02:20.790> million<00:02:21.150> and

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
one and a five that's 15 million and

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.450 
one and a five that's 15 million and
then<00:02:21.780> I<00:02:21.900> did<00:02:22.110> the<00:02:22.230> calculation<00:02:22.950> I'm<00:02:23.130> not<00:02:23.280> sure

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
then I did the calculation I'm not sure

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.640 
then I did the calculation I'm not sure
if<00:02:23.580> I<00:02:23.640> did<00:02:23.820> it<00:02:23.940> right<00:02:24.120> but<00:02:24.720> throughout<00:02:25.020> the<00:02:25.320> six

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
if I did it right but throughout the six

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.370 
if I did it right but throughout the six
or<00:02:26.010> seven<00:02:26.460> day<00:02:26.640> of<00:02:26.850> this<00:02:27.000> event<00:02:27.390> each<00:02:27.840> player

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
or seven day of this event each player

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.940 
or seven day of this event each player
from<00:02:28.680> a<00:02:28.830> thirty<00:02:30.020> member<00:02:31.020> Alliance<00:02:31.440> all<00:02:31.620> thirty

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
from a thirty member Alliance all thirty

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.390 
from a thirty member Alliance all thirty
players<00:02:32.450> each<00:02:33.450> 30<00:02:33.900> players<00:02:34.230> need<00:02:34.590> to<00:02:34.620> have<00:02:35.070> at

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
players each 30 players need to have at

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.640 
players each 30 players need to have at
least<00:02:38.240> 500,000<00:02:39.240> points<00:02:39.930> that's<00:02:40.110> half<00:02:40.470> a

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
least 500,000 points that's half a

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.310 
least 500,000 points that's half a
million<00:02:40.890> so<00:02:41.850> that's<00:02:42.030> if<00:02:42.330> all<00:02:42.660> of<00:02:42.870> your<00:02:43.020> players

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
million so that's if all of your players

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.180 
million so that's if all of your players
fly<00:02:43.680> and<00:02:44.540> then<00:02:45.540> that<00:02:45.750> wouldn't<00:02:46.020> mean<00:02:46.200> that<00:02:46.230> so

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
fly and then that wouldn't mean that so

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.420 
fly and then that wouldn't mean that so
let's<00:02:47.580> say<00:02:47.730> half<00:02:48.000> a<00:02:48.120> million<00:02:48.360> divided<00:02:49.170> by

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
let's say half a million divided by

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.680 
let's say half a million divided by
seven<00:02:50.430> days<00:02:50.640> I'm<00:02:50.880> gonna<00:02:50.970> calculate<00:02:51.270> that

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
seven days I'm gonna calculate that

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.810 
seven days I'm gonna calculate that
you're<00:02:52.260> gonna<00:02:52.410> need<00:02:52.560> about<00:02:55.310> 72,000<00:02:56.310> points

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
you're gonna need about 72,000 points

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.680 
you're gonna need about 72,000 points
per<00:02:57.300> day<00:02:57.630> if<00:02:57.930> you<00:02:58.290> want<00:02:58.500> to<00:02:58.590> get<00:02:58.739> this<00:02:59.690> anyway

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
per day if you want to get this anyway

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.150 
per day if you want to get this anyway
so<00:03:00.750> let<00:03:01.200> me<00:03:01.260> get<00:03:01.410> back<00:03:01.530> out<00:03:01.739> of<00:03:01.770> here<00:03:01.950> and<00:03:02.010> then

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
so let me get back out of here and then

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.979 
so let me get back out of here and then
we'll<00:03:02.340> go<00:03:02.520> into<00:03:02.670> the<00:03:02.820> Ultron<00:03:03.330> battle<00:03:03.750> and<00:03:03.900> then
