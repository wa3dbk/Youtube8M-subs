00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.850
 pablo picasso had to be named 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:08.610
 make up for this quite a bit 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.429
 abstract automobile artwork of the 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.620
 citroÃ«n grand c4 picasso is the first 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:17.490
 waves of the psa group on the 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.170
 new platform gmp 2 based this is supposed to 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.750
 especially many in terms of design 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.939
 Opportunities offer at a glance 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.460
 and in the waves you could say that 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.279
 designers would have absolutely no possibility 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.019
 exploited over taste and over whether 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.969
 something art is possible 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.570
 not known to quarrel 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:39.090
 one thing is for sure the grand c4 picasso 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:42.870
 unusual he usually looks 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:46.500
 on technical data 150 hp works 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:50.879
 consumes 4.3 liters of diesel topspeed 210 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.739
 km h the price is around 27,000 euros there 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.059
 so many people say there are even 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.180
 no real to do 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.280
 the last real father xm is not right 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.989
 that's a real one here has citroÃ«n 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.489
 finally the courage proved the car 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.729
 hosts a wonderful service 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.890
 chaos it drives comfortably easily and it 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.479
 is synonymous in the whole appearance 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.479
 French as a car can only be 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.530
 that means above all soft and comfortable 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.790
 I would like him during the 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:24.549
 say something about the operation 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:26.979
 explain something but it does not work 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:28.420
 the whole region is so complicated that 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:30.850
 you should only stop it 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.680
 everything else puts you in safe death 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.540
 They drive in a tree for one 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.950
 other cars you can use this car 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.259
 do not operate while driving 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.000
 Do not do that you should too 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:41.530
 do not get enticed by the steering wheel buttons 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.880
 let's try something 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.080
 they are mostly so bad 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.810
 labeled that one does not know what 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.040
 that means first home 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.170
 try what works there how 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.310
 just accept that much 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.509
 it does not work that you never 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.950
 will understand why the 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:55.360
 change instruments on my mind 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.590
 loupe tarot there instead of the 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.330
 round instruments why at once 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.720
 foto is displayed where you have all 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.280
 that's a real citroen that would like 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.399
 you have to accept it and frankly 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.420
 That's exactly how we want it or 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.700
 typical citroen is also the 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:13.330
 two-part A-pillar for a good 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.560
 Room feeling takes care of compact vans 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.680
 Of course it's about space and variability 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:20.380
 and to guarantee both has citroen 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.660
 the foremost kassow with the backseat 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.730
 plant of the bishop 1008 furnished in 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.230
 There are then three single seats in row two 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.549
 each can be lengthwise 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.070
 move in the leaning inclination 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:32.440
 vary fold and all three have 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:33.640
 also arrive isofix and then there 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.480
 Of course there is the third row of seats 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:41.459
 the way you own it in the trunk 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:44.579
 it hides but very quickly 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.579
 fold 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.560
 Overall, the picasso can be up to so 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.180
 bring seven people from a to b 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.069
 that she sees at the whole thing 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.690
 even Kompaktvan have it right on it 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:00.270
 is shown on many small details 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.670
 Example that the big stocks have it 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:05.070
 There are two USB ports but there are 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.959
 Also very comfortable armrest for a long distance 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.580
 stretch and overall the car is very 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.570
 thoughtful though not in each 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.570
 detail perfect
