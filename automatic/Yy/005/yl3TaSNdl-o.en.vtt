00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:16.800
 hello and welcome for this test this 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.570
 times outside of 998 v2 so 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.000
 as you can see the battery 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.550
 just below it is a small 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.619
 quadri, but not too small and 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.949
 so you'll be able to see how they 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.929
 evolve outdoors go it's gone 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.050
 for the test let's see what he 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.050
 worth 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:44.990
 very pleasant evening to ride a very 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.990
 friendly very close stable 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.860
 with which one can 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.670
 practically make everything evolve in a 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.670
 pocket-handkerchief 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:02.609
 the youtube years beauty really very very 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.609
 very responsive and j10 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:09.950
 and so, but I'm in the mode 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:13.310
 beginner in this second part of 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:15.590
 998 veto test we will see 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.800
 how it behaves in the wind so 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.600
 I cut the sound of the camera for you 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.640
 save wind noise in the microphone 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.400
 and as you can see so there is a 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.590
 slight oscillations of the small quadri 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.630
 it resists really well and we can 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.990
 leave without problem as I like it 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:35.360
 to do there by raising the wind in this 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.710
 second part we can see so 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.820
 the quadri in advanced mode 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:42.560
 so just push the joysticks 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.360
 in any sense and so at 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.070
 maximum and he performed pirouettes 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.960
 all alone so even with the wind 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.300
 so it's destabilizing it a little bit 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.140
 catch him like that but they evolve 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.140
 without problem 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.810
 who is the kick this fund that pays 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:26.620
 every week an art of which all 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:26.620
 tents a little goal against hunger 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.400
 in fact it's the advanced mode for calling 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.960
 but after the surprise of the screams 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:44.910
 model it's really the very very 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:47.140
 great ease of flight the impression that 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:52.660
 it steals people koi thank 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:54.010
 electronics towards losses after 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:58.000
 regulate electronics ie 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:01.080
 that we can not take too much can not 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.080
 Too much rocking have been 1 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:09.780
 and if you get there too much you can lose a 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.780
 little electronic parts 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:19.960
 but to return to the balanced kg 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:25.720
 it's worth being helped and told me 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:27.760
 that it is legal to leave very quickly and 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.510
 very far from papeete the door but 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:35.970
 maybe not much of the contagions 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:41.800
 revise the trash 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:44.739
 I really had a negative opinion about these 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:47.860
 quads jimenez rally surprise when 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:50.560
 a beginner to get out a amount 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.830
 first two big reach a peak 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:04:00.550
 in fact to teach you rotors 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:04:03.550
 even to start maybe since 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:06.370
 quadri and can read it does not take 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:09.760
 Place that is not being very old 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.810
 so we have time to compensate 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:15.670
 is what can give great 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:23.389
 languages ​​the helicopter it allows 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:29.150
 just to order them samu to 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:32.120
 we do I cross with two pests and 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.529
 this is the test is over if he has you 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.259
 it's up to you 

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:39.189
 go to my partner's website 

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:39.189
