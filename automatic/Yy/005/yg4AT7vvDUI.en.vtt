00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:12.150
 hello and welcome to evo kieffer 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.519
 gelled very great pleasure of you 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.710
 present a sensational novelty 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.410
 decoration that makes the man 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.020
 you know it can live 30 days without 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.970
 eat three days without drinking but 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.550
 only three minutes are breathing 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.130
 ego who does rebuild windows 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.779
 waterproof and after other insulation that 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.850
 nevertheless lets breathe the 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.760
 construction and the people who live 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.160
 ego who do is the only manufacturer of 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.160
 windows that proposes a strategy 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.320
 decentralized ventilation system complies with 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.809
 standard minergie strategy 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.510
 aeration i go fresh is a solution 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.760
 attractive to avoid the systems 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.270
 centralized ventilation and 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.370
 silent and energy-efficient 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:59.510
 for modernizations and your cool 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.309
 represents a practical global solution 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.140
 advantageous is consistent with the standard 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.850
 minergie 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.549
 the regular replacement of air to 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.560
 the interior of the houses is a subject 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.200
 which continues to grow in importance 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.040
 why since the standard minergie 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.659
 was between us more than 15 years ago 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.700
 energy efficiency and comfort 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.610
 of habitat have become requirements 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.290
 very when the needs france metal of 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.710
 the man to have fresh air reduced 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.610
 could finally be taken into consideration at its 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.829
 just measure 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.750
 thanks to modern insulation techniques 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.540
 leaks in the envelop of the 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.340
 building and energy losses 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.380
 uncontrolled belong to the past 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.750
 but this positive evolution of the 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.329
 quality of construction also has its 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.520
 setback on quality buildings 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.820
 the systematic renewal of the air 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.100
 is an absolute priority for that he 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.439
 requires intelligent aeration systems 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.450
 today more than 100000 system 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.640
 are in use in Switzerland 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.049
 for that people is always enough 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.409
 fresh air in their dwelling 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:06.840
 day and night summer and winter what about 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.330
 new construction is obvious and 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.430
 contrast not obvious with respect 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.000
 projects renovations or words 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.670
 latest 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.920
 with a cool igo aeration strategy 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.440
 developed by the partner number 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.840
 in minergie the consumer disposes 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.360
 for the first time a solution 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.130
 practicable and economically attractive 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.950
 for modernization projects 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.080
 energetic and go fresh solves the 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.330
 problem of air renewal with 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.860
 heat recovery at the same time 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.840
 that replacing old 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.300
 windows which helps to avoid 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.490
 expensive driving facilities for 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.770
 centralized ventilation with the 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:46.080
 Ricoh solution Frêche renewal 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:48.300
 automatic air becomes for the 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:51.090
 first time really competitive 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:53.250
 especially since the device comes from 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.650
 benefit from further improvements 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.500
 today and go fresh offer of 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.780
 many benefits first show themselves 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.989
 very discreetly on the window 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:06.120
 the parts thus ventilated are protected the 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:08.040
 noise from the outside which allows you 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.200
 to have quiet nights with 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.390
 fresh milk and that's important because anr 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.400
 breast during the night increases the 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.380
 performance during the day 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.780
 air brought from outside and from 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.130
 other filtered what is important for 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.920
 allergic people 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.900
 security is also increased physical the 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.209
 windows remain closed this is where 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.700
 so much more for your health and 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:32.190
 your well being how does it work 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.709
 fresh so that you also save money 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:37.019
 heating cost ecofresh has a 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:39.420
 heat recuperator that is without 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:42.299
 doubt his main asset of airflow 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.549
 crosses the heat exchanger in winter 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:47.790
 the air coming from outside and 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:49.739
 preheat by the air coming out in the summer 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.959
 the exchanger works in the direction 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:53.720
 reverse and drop the temperature of 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:56.430
 air coming from outside 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.950
 the new and go fresh offered 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.019
 many advantages 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.470
 electricity consumption is very 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:03.900
 wide 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:06.680
 it is possible to use it up to 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:09.769
 temperature of -15 degrees 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:12.319
 its protection against freezing ego 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:14.959
 can be optionally equipped with a sensor 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:17.389
 of co2 or moisture and can be 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:20.479
 integrated in a home automation system case 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:22.850
 indicates this ego fresh and very 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:23.300
 Quiet is ideal for rooms with 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.669
 sleep 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:28.160
 all these assets make it possible 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:31.330
 to build according to the minergie standard 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:34.370
 with aeration strategy i go fresh 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:37.160
 the aeration strategy and go fresh or 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:40.360
 protect protects your home and 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.360
 protect our climate 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.330
 and the advantage with the folds doing 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.490
 is that you only have one 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:03.900
 interlocutor for windows 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:06.180
 aeration and maintenance just throw a 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.940
 look at our website and ask 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:10.650
 advice at one of our branches 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:13.110
 we also present the strategy 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:14.240
 ego frêche aeration of which many 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:17.370
 hopes 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:19.610
 a big thank you for your input and to 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.610
 soon
