00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
walk away from the town and then I can

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.180 
walk away from the town and then I can
teleport<00:02:14.819> home<00:02:15.319> so<00:02:16.319> there's<00:02:16.500> a<00:02:16.560> fast<00:02:16.830> movement

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
teleport home so there's a fast movement

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.130 
teleport home so there's a fast movement
system<00:02:17.520> you<00:02:17.640> basically<00:02:17.910> can<00:02:18.630> fast<00:02:18.900> move

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
system you basically can fast move

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.360 
system you basically can fast move
wherever<00:02:20.780> the<00:02:21.780> major<00:02:22.290> city<00:02:22.800> hub<00:02:22.980> is<00:02:23.130> you<00:02:23.280> can

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
wherever the major city hub is you can

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.490 
wherever the major city hub is you can
see<00:02:23.459> going<00:02:23.640> to<00:02:23.700> that<00:02:23.910> building<00:02:24.290> and<00:02:25.290> you<00:02:25.380> can

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
see going to that building and you can

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.690 
see going to that building and you can
also<00:02:25.620> teleport<00:02:26.069> your<00:02:26.190> house<00:02:26.310> when<00:02:26.489> you<00:02:26.550> build

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
also teleport your house when you build

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.970 
also teleport your house when you build
a<00:02:26.760> house<00:02:26.910> which<00:02:27.239> I<00:02:27.569> haven't<00:02:28.080> yet<00:02:28.230> actually

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
a house which I haven't yet actually

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.410 
a house which I haven't yet actually
wasn't<00:02:29.220> able<00:02:29.430> to<00:02:29.550> figure<00:02:30.060> how<00:02:30.209> to<00:02:30.270> grab

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420

wasn't able to figure how to grab
supplies<00:02:30.630> I<00:02:31.080> think<00:02:31.350> you<00:02:31.410> have<00:02:31.500> to<00:02:31.530> get<00:02:31.650> away

supplies I think you have to get away
from<00:02:31.800> the<00:02:31.950> city<00:02:32.069> because<00:02:32.370> everything<00:02:32.819> is

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
from the city because everything is

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.690 
from the city because everything is
locked<00:02:33.120> down<00:02:33.270> in<00:02:33.540> the<00:02:33.630> city<00:02:33.870> it<00:02:34.860> reminds<00:02:35.459> me<00:02:35.610> a

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
ocean over here and looks sort of like a

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.210 
ocean over here and looks sort of like a
waterfall<00:02:55.830> though<00:02:57.769> you<00:02:58.769> can<00:02:58.980> see<00:02:59.069> when<00:02:59.190> you

use it all up already it doesn't seem to

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.620 
use it all up already it doesn't seem to
regenerate<00:03:53.100> naturally<00:03:53.820> maybe<00:03:54.120> if<00:03:54.239> I<00:03:54.299> have<00:03:54.600> a

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630

throughout<00:03:59.549> the<00:03:59.730> entire<00:03:59.970> video<00:04:00.420> you'll<00:04:00.959> see

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
throughout the entire video you'll see

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:04.880 
throughout the entire video you'll see
that<00:04:01.290> it<00:04:01.440> never<00:04:01.680> fills<00:04:02.040> up<00:04:02.190> again<00:04:03.620> I'm<00:04:04.620> not

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
that it never fills up again I'm not

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.650 
that it never fills up again I'm not
sure<00:04:05.160> what<00:04:05.549> there<00:04:05.700> isn't<00:04:05.790> the<00:04:05.940> way<00:04:06.030> of<00:04:06.120> combat

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
sure what there isn't the way of combat

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.020 
sure what there isn't the way of combat
it<00:04:07.109> couldn't<00:04:07.920> I<00:04:08.040> could<00:04:08.280> not<00:04:08.400> find<00:04:08.609> anything<00:04:08.790> to

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
it couldn't I could not find anything to

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:10.789 
it couldn't I could not find anything to
fight<00:04:09.389> you<00:04:09.959> also<00:04:10.079> have<00:04:10.290> to<00:04:10.319> be<00:04:10.440> careful<00:04:10.709> you

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 
fight you also have to be careful you

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:12.800 
fight you also have to be careful you
had<00:04:11.100> cantley<00:04:11.489> you<00:04:11.519> can<00:04:12.180> stuck<00:04:12.389> on<00:04:12.480> objects

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
had cantley you can stuck on objects

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.840 
had cantley you can stuck on objects
pretty<00:04:12.959> quickly<00:04:13.139> so<00:04:13.319> just<00:04:14.280> walk<00:04:14.370> around<00:04:14.549> them

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
pretty quickly so just walk around them

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:18.620 
pretty quickly so just walk around them
that<00:04:16.340> would<00:04:17.340> be<00:04:17.459> an<00:04:17.519> example<00:04:17.609> of<00:04:18.030> using<00:04:18.150> WASD

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
that would be an example of using WASD

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.320 
that would be an example of using WASD
instead<00:04:19.049> of<00:04:19.200> click<00:04:19.650> to<00:04:19.739> move

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.110 

so<00:04:22.840> you<00:04:22.900> can<00:04:22.990> talk<00:04:23.110> to<00:04:23.229> npc<00:04:23.620> is<00:04:23.770> that<00:04:24.060> to<00:04:25.060> the

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
so you can talk to npc is that to the

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.670 
so you can talk to npc is that to the
top<00:04:25.300> and<00:04:25.449> left<00:04:25.599> of<00:04:25.720> me<00:04:25.810> that<00:04:26.020> little<00:04:26.259> wagon

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
top and left of me that little wagon

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.080

see<00:04:44.590> here<00:04:44.830> I<00:04:44.860> just<00:04:46.979> kind<00:04:47.979> of<00:04:48.099> trained<00:04:48.550> in<00:04:48.699> that

00:04:48.839 --> 00:04:48.849 
see here I just kind of trained in that

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:50.249 
see here I just kind of trained in that
skill<00:04:49.240> which<00:04:49.449> that's<00:04:49.719> the<00:04:49.900> one's<00:04:50.110> going<00:04:50.199> to

00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:50.259 
skill which that's the one's going to

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:52.860 
skill which that's the one's going to
let<00:04:50.409> me<00:04:50.530> teleport<00:04:51.310> home<00:04:51.490> so<00:04:52.240> I<00:04:52.270> got<00:04:52.419> some<00:04:52.599> twigs

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
let me teleport home so I got some twigs

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.029 
let me teleport home so I got some twigs
on<00:04:53.020> the<00:04:53.050> ground<00:04:53.139> and<00:04:53.530> trying<00:04:53.710> to<00:04:53.770> pick<00:04:53.830> them<00:04:53.949> up

00:04:54.029 --> 00:04:54.039 
on the ground and trying to pick them up

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:57.689 
on the ground and trying to pick them up
but<00:04:55.710> don't<00:04:56.710> think<00:04:56.830> I<00:04:56.860> could<00:04:57.009> do<00:04:57.099> it<00:04:57.129> so<00:04:57.490> you<00:04:57.550> can

00:04:57.689 --> 00:04:57.699 
but don't think I could do it so you can

00:04:57.699 --> 00:04:58.950 
but don't think I could do it so you can
see<00:04:57.849> right<00:04:57.879> there<00:04:58.180> in<00:04:58.270> the<00:04:58.330> bottom<00:04:58.449> left<00:04:58.719> I<00:04:58.810> am

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
see right there in the bottom left I am

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.320 
see right there in the bottom left I am
or<00:04:59.409> bottom<00:04:59.740> right<00:04:59.949> I<00:05:00.159> am<00:05:00.310> picking<00:05:00.580> through<00:05:01.180> my

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:01.330 
or bottom right I am picking through my

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.369 
or bottom right I am picking through my
little<00:05:01.629> action<00:05:02.080> sequence<00:05:02.620> I<00:05:03.030> think<00:05:04.030> you<00:05:04.150> can

00:05:04.369 --> 00:05:04.379 
little action sequence I think you can

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:06.600 
little action sequence I think you can
take<00:05:05.379> your<00:05:05.530> favorite<00:05:05.949> actions<00:05:06.250> upon<00:05:06.520> the

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
take your favorite actions upon the

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.640 
take your favorite actions upon the
quick<00:05:06.759> bar<00:05:06.969> in<00:05:07.090> the<00:05:07.180> bottom<00:05:07.479> left<00:05:08.229> down<00:05:08.440> there

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:08.650 
quick bar in the bottom left down there

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.309 
quick bar in the bottom left down there
I<00:05:08.889> actually<00:05:09.669> didn't<00:05:10.539> end<00:05:10.719> up<00:05:10.840> trying<00:05:11.050> that

00:05:11.309 --> 00:05:11.319 
I actually didn't end up trying that

00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:13.909 
I actually didn't end up trying that
because<00:05:11.590> I<00:05:11.620> just<00:05:11.979> noticed<00:05:12.280> a<00:05:12.370> quick<00:05:12.520> bar<00:05:12.810> but

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:13.919 
because I just noticed a quick bar but

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:19.680 
because I just noticed a quick bar but
if<00:05:14.919> so<00:05:15.340> that<00:05:15.759> is<00:05:15.969> pretty<00:05:16.240> handy<00:05:16.449> it<00:05:16.779> does<00:05:18.690> make

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:19.690 
if so that is pretty handy it does make

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:21.059 
if so that is pretty handy it does make
things<00:05:19.719> a<00:05:19.990> little<00:05:20.110> easier<00:05:20.289> because<00:05:20.830> there's

00:05:21.059 --> 00:05:21.069 
things a little easier because there's

00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:22.110 
things a little easier because there's
only<00:05:21.159> a<00:05:21.250> handful<00:05:21.490> of<00:05:21.550> actions<00:05:21.849> are<00:05:21.909> going<00:05:22.029> to

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120 
only a handful of actions are going to

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:26.219 
only a handful of actions are going to
do<00:05:22.180> completely<00:05:24.210> regularly<00:05:25.210> you<00:05:25.960> can<00:05:26.080> see<00:05:26.199> I

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:26.229 
do completely regularly you can see I

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:27.540 
do completely regularly you can see I
just<00:05:26.379> teleported<00:05:26.800> back<00:05:26.860> to<00:05:27.009> town<00:05:27.190> so<00:05:27.400> that's
