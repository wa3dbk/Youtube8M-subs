a<00:00:00.740> problem<00:00:01.740> that<00:00:01.920> plagues<00:00:02.070> many<00:00:02.490> jealous

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
a problem that plagues many jealous

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:04.990 
a problem that plagues many jealous
both<00:00:03.360> beginning<00:00:03.899> and<00:00:04.080> more<00:00:04.319> advanced<00:00:04.830> is

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:05.000 
both beginning and more advanced is

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.179 
both beginning and more advanced is
squeezing<00:00:06.000> with<00:00:06.330> the<00:00:06.480> left<00:00:06.690> hand<00:00:06.960> thumb<00:00:07.259> and<00:00:08.099> I

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
squeezing with the left hand thumb and I

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:09.890 
squeezing with the left hand thumb and I
can<00:00:08.370> understand<00:00:08.849> why<00:00:08.940> people<00:00:09.059> are<00:00:09.420> tempted<00:00:09.780> to

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
can understand why people are tempted to

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.870 
can understand why people are tempted to
do<00:00:10.019> this<00:00:10.139> because<00:00:10.440> it<00:00:10.590> may<00:00:10.740> seem<00:00:11.070> like<00:00:11.099> you

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
do this because it may seem like you

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.999 
do this because it may seem like you
need<00:00:12.210> to<00:00:12.420> squeeze<00:00:12.630> with<00:00:12.840> the<00:00:12.900> thumb<00:00:13.200> in<00:00:13.380> order

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
need to squeeze with the thumb in order

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.820 
need to squeeze with the thumb in order
to<00:00:14.250> get<00:00:14.429> the<00:00:14.610> string<00:00:14.910> down<00:00:15.320> but<00:00:16.320> I<00:00:16.350> am<00:00:16.470> here<00:00:16.800> to

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
to get the string down but I am here to

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.470 
to get the string down but I am here to
assure<00:00:17.010> you<00:00:17.310> that<00:00:17.340> that<00:00:17.580> is<00:00:17.730> indeed<00:00:18.000> not<00:00:18.210> the

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
assure you that that is indeed not the

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.689 
assure you that that is indeed not the
case<00:00:18.720> that<00:00:19.260> there<00:00:19.470> is<00:00:19.619> an<00:00:19.770> alternative<00:00:20.490> and

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
case that there is an alternative and

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.670 
case that there is an alternative and
better<00:00:21.060> way<00:00:21.359> to<00:00:21.420> get<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:21.930> string<00:00:22.199> down<00:00:22.380> and

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
better way to get the string down and

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.580 
better way to get the string down and
that<00:00:23.250> is<00:00:23.430> by<00:00:23.609> using<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:24.570> natural<00:00:24.840> weight<00:00:25.380> of

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
that is by using the natural weight of

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.460 
that is by using the natural weight of
your<00:00:25.740> arm<00:00:25.949> and<00:00:26.939> perhaps<00:00:27.510> a<00:00:27.630> little<00:00:27.869> bit<00:00:27.990> the

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
your arm and perhaps a little bit the

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.690 
your arm and perhaps a little bit the
muscles<00:00:29.160> in<00:00:29.369> your<00:00:29.429> back<00:00:29.929> and<00:00:30.929> upper<00:00:31.410> arm<00:00:31.700> so

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
muscles in your back and upper arm so

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.220 
muscles in your back and upper arm so
when<00:00:33.210> you<00:00:33.300> first<00:00:33.510> start<00:00:33.630> playing<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:34.050> cello

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
when you first start playing the cello

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.260 
when you first start playing the cello
your<00:00:35.070> teacher<00:00:35.309> may<00:00:35.579> have<00:00:35.610> had<00:00:35.910> you're<00:00:36.059> doing

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
your teacher may have had you're doing

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.479 
your teacher may have had you're doing
some<00:00:36.450> kind<00:00:36.630> of<00:00:36.690> exercise<00:00:37.200> like<00:00:37.260> this<00:00:37.770> where

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
some kind of exercise like this where

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.790 
some kind of exercise like this where
are<00:00:38.610> you<00:00:38.700> were<00:00:38.850> essentially<00:00:39.719> throwing<00:00:40.170> the

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
are you were essentially throwing the

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.979 
are you were essentially throwing the
weight<00:00:40.980> of<00:00:41.100> your<00:00:41.129> arm<00:00:41.399> into<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.850> string<00:00:42.210> and

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
weight of your arm into the string and

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.560 
weight of your arm into the string and
you<00:00:43.050> can<00:00:43.260> both<00:00:43.410> do<00:00:43.620> this<00:00:43.800> with<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.430> fist<00:00:44.820> or<00:00:45.210> with

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
you can both do this with a fist or with

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.479 
you can both do this with a fist or with
kind<00:00:45.840> of<00:00:45.930> a<00:00:46.020> more<00:00:46.260> open<00:00:47.360> cello<00:00:48.360> hand<00:00:48.660> position

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
kind of a more open cello hand position

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:53.090 
kind of a more open cello hand position
you<00:00:50.489> may<00:00:50.640> have<00:00:50.760> also<00:00:50.879> tried<00:00:51.390> this<00:00:51.719> version<00:00:52.100> it

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
you may have also tried this version it

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.279 
you may have also tried this version it
which<00:00:53.250> is<00:00:53.399> essentially<00:00:53.910> working<00:00:54.120> on<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:55.020> same

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
which is essentially working on the same

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.340 
which is essentially working on the same
thing<00:00:55.680> just<00:00:56.090> throwing<00:00:57.090> your<00:00:57.300> weight<00:00:57.539> onto<00:00:57.870> the

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
thing just throwing your weight onto the

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.049 
thing just throwing your weight onto the
string<00:00:58.590> and<00:00:58.739> you'll<00:00:58.829> notice<00:00:59.100> that<00:00:59.489> there's

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
string and you'll notice that there's

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.479 
string and you'll notice that there's
quite<00:01:00.270> a<00:01:00.300> bit<00:01:00.510> of<00:01:00.600> weight<00:01:00.719> there<00:01:01.309> alright<00:01:02.309> so

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
quite a bit of weight there alright so

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.460 
quite a bit of weight there alright so
what<00:01:02.850> we've<00:01:02.969> got<00:01:03.210> here<00:01:03.449> is<00:01:03.629> essentially<00:01:04.140> a

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
what we've got here is essentially a

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.340 
what we've got here is essentially a
hook<00:01:05.250> onto<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:06.180> cello<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.720> if<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.200> were<00:01:07.260> to

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
hook onto the cello and if you were to

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.170 
hook onto the cello and if you were to
imagine<00:01:07.409> that<00:01:07.860> you<00:01:08.010> know<00:01:08.100> your<00:01:08.310> hand<00:01:08.640> is<00:01:08.970> like

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
imagine that you know your hand is like

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.210 
imagine that you know your hand is like
a<00:01:09.420> let's<00:01:09.869> say<00:01:10.049> a<00:01:10.080> clothes<00:01:10.409> hanger<00:01:10.860> you<00:01:11.100> know

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
a let's say a clothes hanger you know

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.580 
a let's say a clothes hanger you know
you've<00:01:11.430> got<00:01:11.580> this<00:01:11.760> hook<00:01:11.970> shape<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.560> then<00:01:13.560> you

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
you've got this hook shape and then you

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.969 
you've got this hook shape and then you
were<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:13.890> just<00:01:14.670> latch<00:01:15.150> on<00:01:15.540> well<00:01:16.530> you've<00:01:16.710> got

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
were to just latch on well you've got

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.149 
were to just latch on well you've got
you<00:01:17.369> know<00:01:17.460> even<00:01:17.729> just<00:01:17.909> with<00:01:18.030> gravity<00:01:18.890> quite<00:01:19.890> a

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
you know even just with gravity quite a

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.090 
you know even just with gravity quite a
lot<00:01:20.729> of<00:01:21.030> force<00:01:21.390> there<00:01:21.720> okay<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.290> you<00:01:22.560> can<00:01:22.770> know

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
lot of force there okay and you can know

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.010 
lot of force there okay and you can know
if<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:23.880> have<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.030> friend<00:01:24.299> you<00:01:24.570> can<00:01:24.720> hold<00:01:24.869> on<00:01:24.990> to

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
if you have a friend you can hold on to

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.530 
if you have a friend you can hold on to
their<00:01:25.290> arm<00:01:25.500> or<00:01:25.860> you<00:01:26.340> could<00:01:26.549> they<00:01:27.150> could<00:01:27.330> hold

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
their arm or you could they could hold

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.270 
their arm or you could they could hold
the<00:01:27.689> cello<00:01:27.930> up<00:01:28.170> for<00:01:28.409> you<00:01:28.530> don't<00:01:28.860> do<00:01:29.009> this<00:01:29.159> by

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
the cello up for you don't do this by

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.859 
the cello up for you don't do this by
yourself<00:01:29.430> what<00:01:30.150> I'm<00:01:30.240> doing<00:01:30.450> right<00:01:30.540> now<00:01:30.600> is<00:01:30.750> not

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
yourself what I'm doing right now is not

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.590 
yourself what I'm doing right now is not
very<00:01:31.020> smart<00:01:31.579> you<00:01:32.579> could<00:01:32.700> hook<00:01:32.909> on<00:01:33.119> this<00:01:33.360> way<00:01:33.540> so

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
very smart you could hook on this way so

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.109 
very smart you could hook on this way so
you<00:01:33.750> can<00:01:33.869> really<00:01:34.049> feel<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.920> gravity<00:01:35.189> aspect

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
you can really feel the gravity aspect

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.859 
you can really feel the gravity aspect
of<00:01:36.360> just<00:01:36.990> letting<00:01:37.259> your<00:01:37.380> arm<00:01:37.590> hang<00:01:38.009> there<00:01:38.869> now

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
of just letting your arm hang there now

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.020 
of just letting your arm hang there now
when<00:01:40.049> we<00:01:40.170> do<00:01:40.290> it<00:01:40.409> on<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.799> string<00:01:41.159> it's<00:01:41.549> the

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
when we do it on the string it's the

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.359 
when we do it on the string it's the
same<00:01:42.270> basic<00:01:42.540> idea<00:01:42.840> but<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.740> angle<00:01:44.159> is

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
same basic idea but the angle is

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.100 
same basic idea but the angle is
slightly<00:01:44.759> different<00:01:45.090> so<00:01:45.420> there's<00:01:45.570> an

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
slightly different so there's an

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.929 
slightly different so there's an
exercise<00:01:46.649> that<00:01:46.979> I<00:01:47.040> saw<00:01:47.250> just<00:01:47.520> a<00:01:47.579> couple<00:01:47.790> of

Hardy did this and I thought it was

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.630 
Hardy did this and I thought it was
really<00:01:51.869> quite<00:01:52.110> excellent<00:01:52.439> so<00:01:53.399> I'm<00:01:53.460> going<00:01:53.579> to

left arm or left her hand rather was

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.490 
left arm or left her hand rather was
just<00:02:00.719> sort<00:02:00.899> of<00:02:01.219> waiting<00:02:02.219> right<00:02:03.030> above<00:02:03.299> that<00:02:03.500> so

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
just sort of waiting right above that so

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.440 
just sort of waiting right above that so
she<00:02:04.560> let<00:02:05.070> her<00:02:05.189> right<00:02:05.549> arm<00:02:05.790> start<00:02:06.090> floating

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:08.210 
away and the left arm would pull it

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.300 
away and the left arm would pull it
back<00:02:08.300> into<00:02:08.540> the<00:02:08.630> body<00:02:08.810> the<00:02:09.620> right<00:02:09.860> arm<00:02:10.040> starts

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
back into the body the right arm starts

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:11.680

floating<00:02:10.670> away<00:02:10.790> left<00:02:11.090> arm<00:02:11.270> pulls<00:02:11.510> it<00:02:11.660> back

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
floating away left arm pulls it back

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.040 
floating away left arm pulls it back
into<00:02:11.990> the<00:02:12.140> vine<00:02:12.320> and<00:02:12.650> as<00:02:13.550> you<00:02:13.670> do<00:02:13.850> this<00:02:14.090> I<00:02:14.330> think

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
into the vine and as you do this I think

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.950 
into the vine and as you do this I think
you'll<00:02:15.380> feel<00:02:15.740> that<00:02:16.100> those<00:02:16.760> muscles<00:02:17.540> back<00:02:17.900> here

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:28.460 
more aggressive than you'd really need

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.400 
more aggressive than you'd really need
to<00:02:28.580> do<00:02:28.700> if<00:02:28.850> you<00:02:28.940> were<00:02:29.060> using<00:02:29.240> your<00:02:29.420> cello<00:02:29.660> but

force I've got on this is far more than

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:03.670 
force I've got on this is far more than
you<00:03:02.480> would<00:03:02.600> actually<00:03:02.840> need<00:03:03.290> to<00:03:03.440> get<00:03:03.530> the

you would actually need to get the

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.560 
you would actually need to get the
strings<00:03:03.950> down<00:03:04.160> please<00:03:04.850> keep<00:03:05.090> in<00:03:05.210> mind<00:03:05.240> that

strings down please keep in mind that

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.120 
strings down please keep in mind that
the<00:03:05.690> strings<00:03:05.960> are<00:03:06.080> only<00:03:06.230> really<00:03:06.500> about<00:03:06.770> that

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
the strings are only really about that

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.310

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
a very small change from here to here

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.270 
a very small change from here to here
and<00:03:29.450> if<00:03:29.900> you<00:03:30.260> go<00:03:30.410> any<00:03:30.590> further<00:03:30.800> than<00:03:31.130> that

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
and if you go any further than that

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.380 
and if you go any further than that
you're<00:03:31.520> just<00:03:31.670> playing<00:03:31.880> working<00:03:32.210> too<00:03:32.360> hard

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
you're just playing working too hard

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.150 
you're just playing working too hard
okay<00:03:32.960> that's<00:03:33.350> going<00:03:33.470> to<00:03:33.530> slow<00:03:33.650> your<00:03:33.830> fingers

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
okay that's going to slow your fingers

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.920 
okay that's going to slow your fingers
down<00:03:34.310> so<00:03:34.640> you<00:03:34.730> want<00:03:34.910> to<00:03:35.000> find<00:03:35.210> that<00:03:35.390> spot<00:03:35.720> where

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
down so you want to find that spot where

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.170 
down so you want to find that spot where
you've<00:03:36.080> just<00:03:36.110> got<00:03:36.620> the<00:03:36.770> strings<00:03:37.070> down<00:03:37.310> and<00:03:37.670> no

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
you've just got the strings down and no

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.240 
you've just got the strings down and no
further<00:03:38.510> and<00:03:38.870> that's<00:03:39.410> all<00:03:39.650> the<00:03:40.070> weight<00:03:40.220> you

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
further and that's all the weight you

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.070 
further and that's all the weight you
need<00:03:40.550> on<00:03:40.670> the<00:03:40.760> strings<00:03:41.000> and<00:03:41.180> I<00:03:41.510> bet<00:03:41.720> you<00:03:41.930> can

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 
need on the strings and I bet you can

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.750 
need on the strings and I bet you can
still<00:03:42.290> do<00:03:42.440> that<00:03:42.590> with<00:03:43.220> keeping<00:03:43.490> your<00:03:43.580> thumb

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
still do that with keeping your thumb

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.720 
still do that with keeping your thumb
loose<00:03:44.000> now<00:03:44.720> if<00:03:44.990> you<00:03:45.140> are<00:03:45.410> finding<00:03:46.010> that<00:03:46.370> you

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
loose now if you are finding that you

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.060 
loose now if you are finding that you
just<00:03:47.660> can't<00:03:47.960> get<00:03:48.110> it<00:03:48.230> down<00:03:48.470> well<00:03:48.680> that<00:03:48.860> might

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:49.070 
just can't get it down well that might

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:51.250 
just can't get it down well that might
mean<00:03:49.310> that<00:03:49.580> you<00:03:49.880> are<00:03:50.210> a<00:03:50.240> candidate<00:03:50.780> for<00:03:51.050> some

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
mean that you are a candidate for some

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.680 
mean that you are a candidate for some
finger<00:03:51.740> strengthening<00:03:52.370> exercises<00:03:52.940> all<00:03:53.570> right

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
finger strengthening exercises all right

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:55.120 
finger strengthening exercises all right
especially<00:03:53.870> if<00:03:54.200> you<00:03:54.320> are<00:03:54.470> young<00:03:54.740> and<00:03:54.770> you<00:03:55.100> have

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130 
especially if you are young and you have

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.910 
especially if you are young and you have
small<00:03:55.550> hands<00:03:55.880> that<00:03:56.720> haven't<00:03:57.500> had<00:03:57.590> a<00:03:57.620> lot<00:03:57.800> of

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
small hands that haven't had a lot of

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.610 
small hands that haven't had a lot of
experience<00:03:58.400> grabbing<00:03:59.180> onto<00:03:59.330> things<00:03:59.720> you

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
experience grabbing onto things you

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.260 
experience grabbing onto things you
might<00:04:00.800> just<00:04:00.950> need<00:04:01.160> to<00:04:01.220> strengthen<00:04:01.760> them<00:04:02.090> and

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:02.270 
might just need to strengthen them and

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:04.240 
might just need to strengthen them and
so<00:04:02.660> some<00:04:02.900> things<00:04:03.080> you<00:04:03.200> can<00:04:03.320> do<00:04:03.440> you<00:04:03.560> can<00:04:03.710> do<00:04:03.830> for

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:05.990 
example finger flicks like this you'll

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:07.990 
example finger flicks like this you'll
notice<00:04:06.140> that<00:04:06.350> that<00:04:06.560> moment<00:04:07.070> right<00:04:07.610> before<00:04:07.670> I

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
notice that that moment right before I

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.960 
notice that that moment right before I
flick<00:04:08.360> well<00:04:08.840> there's<00:04:09.050> a<00:04:09.110> lot<00:04:09.260> of<00:04:09.380> muscle

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
flick well there's a lot of muscle

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.250 
flick well there's a lot of muscle
engagement<00:04:10.970> in<00:04:11.120> there<00:04:11.300> can<00:04:11.870> you<00:04:11.930> even<00:04:12.020> do<00:04:12.140> the

engagement in there can you even do the
opposite<00:04:12.890> which<00:04:13.340> then<00:04:13.550> works<00:04:13.850> the<00:04:14.000> muscle

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:14.460 
opposite which then works the muscle

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:16.580 
opposite which then works the muscle
on<00:04:14.520> the<00:04:14.670> other<00:04:14.850> side<00:04:14.970> of<00:04:15.240> my<00:04:15.480> hand<00:04:15.660> okay<00:04:16.530> so

flicks know those other squeezy things

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.270 
flicks know those other squeezy things
work<00:04:40.080> but<00:04:40.350> they<00:04:40.440> don't<00:04:40.590> work<00:04:40.680> quite<00:04:40.890> as<00:04:41.130> well

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
work but they don't work quite as well

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.650 
work but they don't work quite as well
as<00:04:41.370> the<00:04:41.460> power<00:04:41.610> putty<00:04:41.940> which<00:04:42.120> gives<00:04:42.360> you<00:04:42.480> some

different types of exercises to do okay

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.590 
different types of exercises to do okay
but<00:04:46.230> the<00:04:46.620> moral<00:04:46.920> of<00:04:46.980> the<00:04:47.100> story<00:04:47.130> is<00:04:47.640> we<00:04:48.180> are<00:04:48.300> not

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:48.600 
but the moral of the story is we are not

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.840 
but the moral of the story is we are not
pushing<00:04:48.990> the<00:04:49.230> string<00:04:49.440> down<00:04:49.620> by<00:04:50.160> using<00:04:50.640> the

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
pushing the string down by using the

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:52.670 
pushing the string down by using the
poseable<00:04:51.210> motion<00:04:51.480> of<00:04:51.570> the<00:04:51.660> thumb<00:04:51.870> we<00:04:52.530> are

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
poseable motion of the thumb we are

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.520 
poseable motion of the thumb we are
using<00:04:52.860> our<00:04:53.070> arm<00:04:53.430> weight<00:04:53.700> and<00:04:54.060> with<00:04:55.050> that<00:04:55.200> hug

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
using our arm weight and with that hug

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.710 
using our arm weight and with that hug
feeling<00:04:56.100> and<00:04:56.310> perhaps<00:04:56.970> a<00:04:57.330> little<00:04:57.570> engagement

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
feeling and perhaps a little engagement

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.740 
feeling and perhaps a little engagement
of<00:04:58.290> these<00:04:58.470> muscles<00:04:58.920> back<00:04:59.070> here<00:04:59.130> but<00:05:00.030> we<00:05:00.510> don't

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
of these muscles back here but we don't

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:02.570 
of these muscles back here but we don't
really<00:05:01.050> need<00:05:01.320> the<00:05:01.530> string<00:05:01.770> to<00:05:01.920> go<00:05:02.070> down<00:05:02.310> all

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
really need the string to go down all

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.510 
really need the string to go down all
that<00:05:02.910> far<00:05:03.210> so<00:05:03.750> don't<00:05:04.440> go<00:05:04.620> overboard<00:05:04.950> on<00:05:05.310> it

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
that far so don't go overboard on it

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.620 
that far so don't go overboard on it
okay<00:05:06.500> good<00:05:07.500> luck
