hello and welcome to the fourth Tekkit

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:04.430 
hello and welcome to the fourth Tekkit
tutorial<00:00:02.520> this<00:00:03.210> one<00:00:03.419> is<00:00:03.540> regarding<00:00:03.899> power<00:00:04.140> of

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
tutorial this one is regarding power of

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.799 
tutorial this one is regarding power of
infinity<00:00:04.920> MC<00:00:05.810> by<00:00:06.810> the<00:00:06.870> power<00:00:07.259> of<00:00:07.410> light<00:00:07.770> lava

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:08.809 
infinity MC by the power of light lava

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:13.669 
infinity MC by the power of light lava
we<00:00:09.809> shall<00:00:10.080> make<00:00:10.230> energy<00:00:11.599> by<00:00:12.599> that<00:00:12.840> I<00:00:13.019> mean<00:00:13.320> we

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
we shall make energy by that I mean we

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.589 
we shall make energy by that I mean we
were<00:00:13.710> making<00:00:14.250> larvae<00:00:14.610> cells<00:00:14.849> directly<00:00:15.299> from

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
were making larvae cells directly from

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.790 
were making larvae cells directly from
sunlight<00:00:16.340> and<00:00:17.340> we<00:00:17.550> shall<00:00:17.730> be<00:00:17.789> making<00:00:18.300> energy

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:18.800 
sunlight and we shall be making energy

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:26.960 
sunlight and we shall be making energy
from<00:00:19.800> lava<00:00:21.859> make<00:00:22.859> sense<00:00:23.189> but<00:00:25.910> right<00:00:26.910> now

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
from lava make sense but right now

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.910 
from lava make sense but right now
there's<00:00:27.420> a<00:00:27.449> lot<00:00:27.660> of<00:00:27.689> trouble<00:00:28.380> trying<00:00:28.859> to

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
there's a lot of trouble trying to

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.939 
there's a lot of trouble trying to
rebuild<00:00:29.220> this<00:00:29.490> because<00:00:30.590> as<00:00:31.590> you<00:00:31.740> probably

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
rebuild this because as you probably

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.799 
rebuild this because as you probably
have<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.189> spend<00:00:32.309> other<00:00:32.640> stupid<00:00:33.120> sense<00:00:33.450> of<00:00:33.660> our

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
have to spend other stupid sense of our

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.520 
have to spend other stupid sense of our
peers<00:00:34.140> whenever<00:00:34.380> I<00:00:34.530> style<00:00:34.890> stop<00:00:35.309> reporting

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:36.530 
peers whenever I style stop reporting

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.889 
peers whenever I style stop reporting
that's<00:00:37.530> because<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.550> key<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:39.090> recourse<00:00:39.450> on

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
that's because the key to recourse on

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.430 
that's because the key to recourse on
the<00:00:40.350> fraps<00:00:40.620> is<00:00:40.920> f9<00:00:41.750> so<00:00:42.750> I<00:00:42.780> thought<00:00:42.989> okay<00:00:43.320> I'll

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
the fraps is f9 so I thought okay I'll

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.220 
the fraps is f9 so I thought okay I'll
remap<00:00:43.800> my<00:00:43.980> controls<00:00:44.460> in<00:00:44.850> Tekkit<00:00:45.510> which<00:00:46.079> I

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
remap my controls in Tekkit which I

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.750 
remap my controls in Tekkit which I
thought<00:00:46.379> would<00:00:46.469> be<00:00:46.530> easier<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.280> moon<00:00:47.460> rapping

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
thought would be easier the moon rapping

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.459 
thought would be easier the moon rapping
control<00:00:48.120> fraps<00:00:48.570> I<00:00:50.360> ended<00:00:51.360> up<00:00:51.480> making<00:00:52.140> it<00:00:52.350> so

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
control fraps I ended up making it so

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.080 
control fraps I ended up making it so
that<00:00:52.500> every<00:00:52.800> time<00:00:52.920> I<00:00:52.980> click<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.550> center<00:00:53.940> that

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
that every time I click the center that

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.020 
that every time I click the center that
would<00:00:54.210> appear<00:00:54.539> so<00:00:54.980> I<00:00:55.980> just<00:00:56.129> come<00:00:56.309> in<00:00:56.520> father<00:00:56.730> to

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
would appear so I just come in father to

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.389 
would appear so I just come in father to
try<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.360> fix<00:00:57.539> it's<00:00:57.870> just<00:00:58.530> every<00:00:59.100> time<00:00:59.129> i

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
try and fix it's just every time i

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.819 
try and fix it's just every time i
clicked<00:00:59.699> i<00:00:59.879> get<00:01:00.090> a<00:01:00.120> sensor<00:01:00.480> net<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:00.930> there's

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
clicked i get a sensor net and there's

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.119 
clicked i get a sensor net and there's
rings<00:01:02.039> all<00:01:02.219> tickets<00:01:03.080> and<00:01:04.080> thats<00:01:04.260> fine<00:01:04.559> texture

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
rings all tickets and thats fine texture

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.630 
rings all tickets and thats fine texture
pack<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:05.820> so<00:01:06.330> everything<00:01:07.110> went<00:01:07.290> wrong

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
pack and so everything went wrong

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.649 
pack and so everything went wrong
basically<00:01:08.640> what<00:01:08.729> i'm<00:01:08.820> doing<00:01:09.090> is<00:01:09.150> i'm<00:01:09.210> making

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
basically what i'm doing is i'm making

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.240 
basically what i'm doing is i'm making
it<00:01:09.750> servants<00:01:10.340> as<00:01:11.340> you<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:11.990> these<00:01:12.990> pipes<00:01:13.710> will

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
it servants as you and these pipes will

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.120 
it servants as you and these pipes will
automatically<00:01:14.909> live<00:01:15.180> alarm<00:01:15.450> cells<00:01:15.780> into<00:01:16.650> the

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
automatically live alarm cells into the

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.820 
automatically live alarm cells into the
geothermal<00:01:17.640> generator<00:01:18.000> so<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.600> dam<00:01:18.869> which

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
geothermal generator so the dam which

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.210 
geothermal generator so the dam which
generate<00:01:20.280> energy<00:01:20.790> from<00:01:21.000> them<00:01:21.920> this<00:01:22.920> is<00:01:23.040> the

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
generate energy from them this is the

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.450 
generate energy from them this is the
automating<00:01:23.850> of<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.299> production<00:01:24.570> marma<00:01:25.110> cells

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
automating of the production marma cells

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.100 
automating of the production marma cells
we're<00:01:26.460> just<00:01:26.549> using<00:01:26.790> as<00:01:27.030> you<00:01:27.270> can<00:01:27.360> answer<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.990> a

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
we're just using as you can answer and a

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.590 
we're just using as you can answer and a
few<00:01:28.320> energy<00:01:28.950> collectors<00:01:29.460> i'm<00:01:30.030> using<00:01:30.240> mark

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
few energy collectors i'm using mark

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.780 
few energy collectors i'm using mark
threes<00:01:31.020> but<00:01:31.320> other<00:01:31.470> side<00:01:31.950> other<00:01:32.220> ones<00:01:32.549> will

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
threes but other side other ones will

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.249 
threes but other side other ones will
work<00:01:33.030> because<00:01:33.180> of<00:01:33.329> their<00:01:33.509> mark<00:01:33.780> trees<00:01:34.110> are

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
work because of their mark trees are

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.230 
work because of their mark trees are
very<00:01:34.530> expensive<00:01:37.640> this<00:01:38.640> is<00:01:38.790> definitely<00:01:39.180> my

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
very expensive this is definitely my

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.560 
very expensive this is definitely my
favorite<00:01:39.780> way<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:39.930> make<00:01:40.470> energy<00:01:41.270> what<00:01:42.270> you<00:01:42.360> do

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
favorite way to make energy what you do

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.569 
favorite way to make energy what you do
on<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.840> survival<00:01:43.590> service<00:01:44.009> just<00:01:44.220> make<00:01:44.369> like

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
on the survival service just make like

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.660 
on the survival service just make like
one<00:01:44.850> mark<00:01:45.240> two<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:45.990> just<00:01:46.649> slowly<00:01:47.130> produce

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
one mark two and just slowly produce

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.649 
one mark two and just slowly produce
energy<00:01:47.880> on<00:01:48.149> time<00:01:48.920> but<00:01:49.920> either<00:01:50.790> way<00:01:51.030> works<00:01:51.240> it's

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
energy on time but either way works it's

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.819 
energy on time but either way works it's
just<00:01:51.840> one<00:01:51.990> voice<00:01:52.200> quickly<00:01:54.590> see<00:01:55.590> I<00:01:55.619> forgot

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
just one voice quickly see I forgot

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.399 
just one voice quickly see I forgot

finds you keep machines topped up but

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.440 
finds you keep machines topped up but
for<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.659> first<00:02:03.869> initial<00:02:04.350> filling<00:02:05.000> we<00:02:06.000> need<00:02:06.240> to

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
for the first initial filling we need to

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.260 
for the first initial filling we need to
have<00:02:06.630> more<00:02:06.930> so<00:02:07.680> yeah<00:02:08.310> just<00:02:08.610> pretty<00:02:08.879> much<00:02:09.000> over
