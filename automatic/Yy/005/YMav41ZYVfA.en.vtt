00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
the Champions League final because they

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.109

in<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.270> same<00:01:24.509> position<00:01:25.020> for<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.560> bail<00:01:25.740> goal

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
in the same position for the bail goal

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.760

he's proved himself last season and he

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.410 
he's proved himself last season and he
ended<00:01:29.100> up<00:01:29.189> being<00:01:29.549> very<00:01:29.579> very<00:01:30.030> good<00:01:30.210> for
