as<00:01:50.569> I<00:01:50.899> mentioned<00:01:51.319> in<00:01:51.409> previous<00:01:51.770> guide<00:01:52.399> to<00:01:53.060> do

00:01:53.169 --> 00:01:53.179 
as I mentioned in previous guide to do

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:57.950 
as I mentioned in previous guide to do
this<00:01:53.420> method<00:01:54.020> and<00:01:54.289> kind<00:01:54.950> of<00:01:55.009> thing<00:01:55.280> so<00:01:56.049> yeah

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
this method and kind of thing so yeah

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.649 
this method and kind of thing so yeah
I<00:01:58.080> don't<00:01:58.950> know<00:01:59.040> really<00:01:59.310> what<00:01:59.909> else<00:02:00.150> to<00:02:00.360> say

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
apart from that it's going to take you a

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.530 
apart from that it's going to take you a
while<00:02:03.600> to<00:02:03.659> get<00:02:04.110> them<00:02:04.880> considering<00:02:05.880> let's<00:02:06.240> say

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
while to get them considering let's say

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.410

you do them a day like I said 500 to 600

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.770 
you do them a day like I said 500 to 600
kills<00:02:16.020> you'll<00:02:16.380> be<00:02:16.620> able<00:02:16.709> to<00:02:16.980> do<00:02:17.640> it<00:02:17.700> in<00:02:17.970> a

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
kills you'll be able to do it in a

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
necks in the future and as well maybe

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.990 
necks in the future and as well maybe
make<00:03:37.110> some<00:03:37.350> serious<00:03:37.590> about<00:03:37.890> bossing<00:03:38.340> and<00:03:38.820> all

those things so hopefully it will give
you<00:03:42.690> some<00:03:42.900> insight<00:03:43.410> on<00:03:43.440> how<00:03:43.859> to<00:03:43.920> do<00:03:44.220> and<00:03:44.730> it's

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
you some insight on how to do and it's

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.819 
you some insight on how to do and it's
like<00:03:45.239> I<00:03:45.420> mentioned<00:03:45.630> before<00:03:45.840> you<00:03:46.260> set<00:03:46.680> yourself

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:46.829 
like I mentioned before you set yourself

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:49.670 
like I mentioned before you set yourself
a<00:03:47.280> goal<00:03:47.310> guys<00:03:47.820> cuz<00:03:48.269> there's<00:03:49.109> no<00:03:49.260> other<00:03:49.380> way<00:03:49.650> of

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
a goal guys cuz there's no other way of

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.860 
a goal guys cuz there's no other way of
doing<00:03:50.250> them<00:03:50.430> kills<00:03:50.730> or<00:03:50.970> getting<00:03:51.359> your<00:03:51.510> money

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
doing them kills or getting your money

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.740 
doing them kills or getting your money
if<00:03:52.170> you<00:03:52.320> don't<00:03:52.470> set<00:03:52.950> yourself<00:03:53.100> for<00:03:53.640> gold<00:03:53.880> now

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
if you don't set yourself for gold now

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.800 
if you don't set yourself for gold now
it's<00:03:55.620> pretty<00:03:55.769> easy<00:03:56.160> I<00:03:56.370> think<00:03:56.489> to<00:03:56.940> get<00:03:57.180> 10,000

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
it's pretty easy I think to get 10,000

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.040 
it's pretty easy I think to get 10,000
kills<00:03:58.079> and<00:03:58.470> you

00:03:59.040 --> 00:03:59.050 
kills and you

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.050 
kills and you
I'll<00:03:59.110> get<00:03:59.290> good<00:03:59.530> experience<00:04:00.130> and<00:04:00.490> good<00:04:00.760> money

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
I'll get good experience and good money

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.140 
I'll get good experience and good money
because<00:04:01.840> there's<00:04:02.440> no<00:04:02.950> better<00:04:03.160> method<00:04:03.730> to<00:04:03.970> get

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
because there's no better method to get

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.930 
because there's no better method to get
so<00:04:04.480> much<00:04:04.660> money<00:04:04.900> in<00:04:05.110> so<00:04:05.260> much<00:04:05.440> experience<00:04:05.950> you

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 
so much money in so much experience you

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.500 
so much money in so much experience you
know<00:04:07.540> get<00:04:08.440> stats<00:04:08.890> up<00:04:09.190> apart<00:04:09.520> from<00:04:09.640> maybe<00:04:10.060> again

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
know get stats up apart from maybe again

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:11.910 
know get stats up apart from maybe again
