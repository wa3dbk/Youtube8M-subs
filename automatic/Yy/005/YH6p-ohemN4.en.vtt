everything so far first things first if

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.440 
everything so far first things first if

we take a look at the password screen

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.119 
we take a look at the password screen
for<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.780> Phantom<00:00:37.140> program<00:00:37.530> right<00:00:37.710> now<00:00:37.890> it

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
for the Phantom program right now it

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.209 
for the Phantom program right now it
says<00:00:38.370> this<00:00:38.760> face<00:00:39.570> for<00:00:39.899> now<00:00:40.110> active<00:00:40.620> physical

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
says this face for now active physical

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.090 
says this face for now active physical
access<00:00:41.670> restriction<00:00:42.329> in<00:00:42.480> place<00:00:42.899> hmm<00:00:43.860> that's

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
access restriction in place hmm that's

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.130 
access restriction in place hmm that's
very<00:00:44.190> interesting<00:00:44.730> you<00:00:45.120> can't<00:00:45.420> actually<00:00:45.660> type

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
very interesting you can't actually type

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.350 
very interesting you can't actually type
anything<00:00:46.469> in<00:00:46.829> there<00:00:47.100> so<00:00:47.670> that<00:00:47.850> leads<00:00:48.090> us<00:00:48.210> to

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
anything in there so that leads us to

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.180 
anything in there so that leads us to
believe<00:00:48.390> that<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:49.079> unlock<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.590> bow<00:00:49.800> in<00:00:50.070> the

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
believe that to unlock the bow in the

solve it all so from that to figure this
out<00:01:20.490> we've<00:01:20.820> got<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.119> stay<00:01:21.330> in<00:01:21.509> game<00:01:21.960> and

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
out we've got to stay in game and

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.859 
out we've got to stay in game and
somehow<00:01:22.590> get<00:01:23.250> past<00:01:23.520> this<00:01:23.759> physical<00:01:24.360> access

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
somehow get past this physical access

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.230 
somehow get past this physical access
restriction<00:01:25.500> but<00:01:26.159> what<00:01:26.340> is<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.759> physical

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
restriction but what is the physical

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.810 
restriction but what is the physical
access<00:01:27.780> restriction<00:01:28.500> well<00:01:28.770> we<00:01:29.220> think<00:01:29.460> it's

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
access restriction well we think it's

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.300 
access restriction well we think it's

detected line is interesting too and I

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:42.770 
detected line is interesting too and I
think<00:03:41.699> that<00:03:41.819> that<00:03:41.939> could<00:03:42.150> mean<00:03:42.389> if<00:03:42.659> you're

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
think that that could mean if you're

think that that could mean if you're

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:09.000 
symbol on it - is this possibly

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.550 
symbol on it - is this possibly
something<00:07:09.390> we<00:07:09.480> could<00:07:09.630> use<00:07:09.660> to<00:07:10.020> power<00:07:10.230> up<00:07:10.440> the

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:10.560 
something we could use to power up the

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:13.280 
something we could use to power up the
elevator<00:07:10.919> maybe<00:07:11.730> only<00:07:12.480> time<00:07:12.840> will<00:07:13.050> tell
