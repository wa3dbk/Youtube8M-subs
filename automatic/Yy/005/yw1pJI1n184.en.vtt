00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.500
 these style townhouses 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.960
 Victorian people call attention to their 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.259
 narrowness it is difficult to imagine a 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.529
 wide inside but if two join in 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:24.529
 a 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.700
 hi come in and see how we transform 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.430
 houses 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.590
 Chloe Macintosh and her husband had the 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.460
 lucky to be able to buy and reform two 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.460
 adjoining houses 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:44.450
 I grew up in Paris and I love living in a 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.070
 single height in london people usually 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.949
 live in narrow houses with several 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.600
 floors but when you have kids that's 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:52.520
 impractical 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.870
 the idea was to create a space in which 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.989
 Do everything you do in a day 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:59.540
 play rest eat receive the 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:02.440
 visits and also with space for 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.440
 store things 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:09.490
 to have the kitchen in the center is a 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:12.040
 unconventional decision but we 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.290
 allows to have two spaces aside the 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.110
 living room and the other the area for 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.570
 meals and dinners 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.610
 and we can also take advantage of this 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.510
 distribution to hide the areas of 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:27.320
 storage and utensils 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.320
 kitchen are here 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.880
 and the play room for the children is 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.920
 behind this corner and the toys 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.130
 they keep them in a closet also hidden 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.870
 to the other side 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.300
 the architects combined elements 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:44.340
 new with others that were already 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.350
 old bricks combine with the floor 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.330
 of waxed concrete that in turn is the 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.430
 counterpoint of the classic parquet 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.070
 darkened wood to reinforce the 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.530
 contrast the reform was possible thanks 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.729
 to billy makropulos from the study of 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.729
 London architecture 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:06.030
 it was the first time we joined two houses 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.850
 to form one is not usually done at 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.400
 principle we look for examples models but 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.320
 we did not find any I think it's 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.690
 because normally when people have 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.030
 two houses stays with one and rents the 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.560
 other 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.110
 this was different because the client 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:26.010
 I wanted to keep the two houses for 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:28.140
 have just what we have created in the 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.510
 high floor the distribution was respected 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.280
 original with small rooms but 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.850
 the window of the fourth of 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.850
 work 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:41.129
 and it occurred to me to put one more window 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.159
 great because my husband takes time 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:46.650
 wanting to leave the bank I thought that a 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:49.819
 window to see the outside would help you 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.819
 to discover what you want to do 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:58.140
 this is our bedroom the fourth 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.570
 main on this side of the house there 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.820
 we made many changes we kept more or 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.200
 less the original state but in the 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.960
 bathroom I wanted to do something 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.840
 different I wanted to give it a modern look 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.880
 so I opened it completely one thing 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.910
 that I loved and wanted to save all 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.260
 coast was the bathtub was made of wood 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.620
 recycled from an old station 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.720
 English railway I found an object 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:25.700
 very special but I did not like the color 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.700
 of the wood so I painted it black 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:31.890
 the resulting 210 square meters 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.900
 they seem even more thanks to the glass 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.990
 from the back that allows you to see the 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:39.720
 garden is shown the sum of two 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:44.180
 narrow houses and something dark gives like 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.180
 result a broad gas brimming with light
