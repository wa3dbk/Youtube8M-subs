00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
handler and the timing chip like this

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.179 
handler and the timing chip like this
because<00:00:24.990> on<00:00:25.500> your<00:00:25.830> arm<00:00:27.650> the<00:00:28.650> timing<00:00:29.010> chip

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
because on your arm the timing chip

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.040 
because on your arm the timing chip
stores<00:00:29.550> all<00:00:29.820> your<00:00:30.000> race<00:00:30.150> information<00:00:30.449> and
