00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 hey people here are repeatedly for 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.450
 android and today the singing on board to 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.940
 this chamber 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:13.280
 no it is not the iphone 5 but 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:16.230
 a a replica of these part 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.240
 Here you can easily see the five logo 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.820
 Apple logo again of the influence logo 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.050
 and again is and the pure illustration 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.050
 of the new iphone 5 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.859
 you do it all on it comes to me 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:37.739
 already jumped against 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:43.920
 maybe nothing has happened buxe needs 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:50.809
 always critical tutorials apple 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:50.809
 like very nice 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:01:03.030
 the european european network part 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:06.619
 and that's how Duncan America fan 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:09.920
 always these network connection parts 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:13.260
 let's see if that works there yet 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:19.430
 also doubt a bit here 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:24.479
 the apple headphones probably from 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:26.820
 to iphone 4s or iphone 4 sees 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:31.079
 It's pretty decent , too 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:36.689
 Original one knows that in these loud 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:41.790
 quieter play and pause buttons then the 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:45.439
 lightning connector cable like the 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.439
 original iphone 5 off 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:59.700
 I have to authorize shortly yes 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:04.740
 actually very handy you can like 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:11.880
 you want to put in it's good to have something 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:18.090
 we still in the box that 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:23.750
 by the way, sim-map tool is not a nanos 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:27.840
 in the device but 1 1 1 1 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:29.270
 the smaller sim cards form them at the ps 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:35.600
 and at the iphone 4 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:35.600
 yes, there you can see it really great part 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:43.700
