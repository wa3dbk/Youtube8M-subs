some<00:00:37.609> more<00:00:38.239> of<00:00:38.329> this<00:00:38.620> but<00:00:39.620> then<00:00:39.710> I<00:00:39.800> come<00:00:40.010> across

00:00:40.119 --> 00:00:40.129 
some more of this but then I come across

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:44.650 
some more of this but then I come across
this<00:00:40.999> tire<00:00:41.269> swing<00:00:42.850> the<00:00:43.850> Rope<00:00:44.120> doesn't<00:00:44.539> look

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 
this tire swing the Rope doesn't look

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.680 
this tire swing the Rope doesn't look
that<00:00:44.690> old<00:00:44.870> but<00:00:45.670> I<00:00:46.670> don't<00:00:46.910> know<00:00:46.999> is<00:00:47.149> this<00:00:47.300> where

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
that old but I don't know is this where

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:55.930 
that old but I don't know is this where
a<00:00:47.719> homestead<00:00:48.260> was<00:00:48.499> it's<00:00:49.280> not<00:00:49.519> on<00:00:49.640> the<00:00:49.760> map<00:00:54.940> but

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
a homestead was it's not on the map but

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.360 
a homestead was it's not on the map but
I<00:00:55.999> mean<00:00:56.179> it's<00:00:56.300> an<00:00:56.420> old<00:00:56.569> tree<00:00:56.920> but<00:00:57.920> I've<00:00:58.069> walked

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
I mean it's an old tree but I've walked

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.389 
I mean it's an old tree but I've walked
all<00:00:58.730> those<00:00:59.149> woods<00:00:59.480> over<00:00:59.629> there<00:01:00.100> and<00:01:01.100> I<00:01:01.159> found

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:01.399 
all those woods over there and I found

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:05.320 
all those woods over there and I found
bricks<00:01:01.909> here<00:01:02.359> and<00:01:02.539> there<00:01:02.749> but<00:01:03.879> supposedly<00:01:04.879> I'm

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
bricks here and there but supposedly I'm

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.910 
bricks here and there but supposedly I'm
guessing<00:01:05.990> this<00:01:06.229> is<00:01:06.409> the<00:01:06.440> homestead<00:01:08.830> all<00:01:09.830> right

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
guessing this is the homestead all right

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.680 
guessing this is the homestead all right

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
there's some piles of dirt over there
