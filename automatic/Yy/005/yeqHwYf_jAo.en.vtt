going to need is the wig D we like to

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.990 
going to need is the wig D we like to
stretch<00:00:46.460> and<00:00:48.829> alcohol<00:00:49.829> preferably<00:00:50.700> the

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
stretch and alcohol preferably the

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.459 
stretch and alcohol preferably the
higher<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.449> percentage<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.840> better<00:00:52.140> this<00:00:52.410> is

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
higher the percentage the better this is

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.720 
higher the percentage the better this is
91%<00:00:53.219> in<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:54.480> spray<00:00:54.809> bottle<00:00:55.160> now<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.250> reason<00:00:56.610> why

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
91% in a spray bottle now the reason why

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.580 
91% in a spray bottle now the reason why
I<00:00:56.760> always<00:00:57.059> use<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.780> higher<00:00:58.079> percentage<00:00:58.530> of

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
I always use a higher percentage of

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.099 
I always use a higher percentage of
alcohols<00:00:58.980> because<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.399> dries<00:00:59.809> faster<00:01:00.809> the

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
alcohols because it dries faster the

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.139 
alcohols because it dries faster the
lesser<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.649> percentage<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.430> less<00:01:02.609> actual

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
lesser the percentage the less actual

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.440 
lesser the percentage the less actual
alcohol<00:01:03.629> there<00:01:04.019> is<00:01:04.199> in<00:01:04.470> it<00:01:05.150> so<00:01:06.150> what<00:01:06.330> you're

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
alcohol there is in it so what you're

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.090 
alcohol there is in it so what you're
going<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.659> do<00:01:06.840> is<00:01:07.170> you're<00:01:07.530> going<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.680> take<00:01:07.920> your

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
this is a color t-33 / 130 which means

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.649 
this is a color t-33 / 130 which means
it's<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.750> 33<00:01:16.290> at<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.830> root<00:01:17.040> and<00:01:17.220> it<00:01:17.340> fades<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:18.240> a

it's a 33 at the root and it fades to a
130<00:01:19.080> on<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.320> end<00:01:19.500> so<00:01:19.710> it's<00:01:19.860> really<00:01:20.040> just<00:01:20.189> a

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
130 on the end so it's really just a

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.429 
130 on the end so it's really just a
nice<00:01:20.610> little<00:01:20.790> blend<00:01:21.180> ombre<00:01:21.659> kind<00:01:21.930> of<00:01:21.990> look<00:01:22.170> and

nice little blend ombre kind of look and

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.740 
nice little blend ombre kind of look and

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
it is a lace front and since this is

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.350 
it is a lace front and since this is
mine<00:01:24.960> I<00:01:25.290> did<00:01:25.500> cut<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.860> lace<00:01:26.040> back<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:27.240> the

the<00:02:06.810> more<00:02:06.990> saturated<00:02:07.170> is<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.710> better<00:02:07.860> because

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
the more saturated is the better because

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.400 
the more saturated is the better because
it<00:02:08.220> will<00:02:08.280> stretch<00:02:08.550> better<00:02:09.020> so<00:02:10.020> I'm<00:02:10.259> just

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
it will stretch better so I'm just

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.030 
it will stretch better so I'm just
spraying

the<00:02:17.980> lace<00:02:18.420> now<00:02:19.420> I<00:02:19.450> do<00:02:19.659> have<00:02:19.780> to<00:02:19.870> warn<00:02:20.079> you<00:02:20.230> the

00:02:20.369 --> 00:02:20.379 
the lace now I do have to warn you the

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:22.289 
the lace now I do have to warn you the
lace<00:02:20.590> isn't<00:02:21.040> really<00:02:21.250> going<00:02:21.370> to<00:02:21.430> stretch<00:02:21.730> that

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:22.299 
lace isn't really going to stretch that

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:24.839 
lace isn't really going to stretch that
much<00:02:22.569> because<00:02:22.870> it's<00:02:23.200> plastic<00:02:23.640> if<00:02:24.640> you're

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:24.849 
much because it's plastic if you're

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:27.390 
much because it's plastic if you're
doing<00:02:24.970> this<00:02:25.150> on<00:02:25.299> a<00:02:25.360> hand-tied<00:02:25.900> wig<00:02:26.319> or<00:02:26.650> a<00:02:26.680> wig

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
doing this on a hand-tied wig or a wig

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.190 
doing this on a hand-tied wig or a wig
that<00:02:27.430> has<00:02:27.760> real<00:02:28.150> lace<00:02:28.360> versus<00:02:28.870> this

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
that has real lace versus this

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.380 
that has real lace versus this
commercial<00:02:29.709> lace<00:02:29.890> then<00:02:30.549> it<00:02:30.700> will<00:02:30.879> stretch<00:02:31.180> the

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
commercial lace then it will stretch the

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:38.180 
commercial lace then it will stretch the
least<00:02:31.599> so<00:02:31.750> you<00:02:31.840> kinda<00:02:32.079> have<00:02:32.140> to<00:02:32.230> be<00:02:32.319> careful

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.680 

and<00:02:39.190> then<00:02:39.579> your<00:02:39.730> hand<00:02:39.909> will<00:02:40.060> get<00:02:40.150> tired<00:02:40.359> and
