00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.720 

okay<00:00:00.630> good<00:00:00.840> so<00:00:01.050> this<00:00:01.199> is<00:00:01.260> a<00:00:02.030> 1929<00:00:03.589> alto

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:04.730 
okay good so this is a 1929 alto

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.200 
okay good so this is a 1929 alto
high-speed<00:00:05.730> quad<00:00:06.770> and<00:00:07.770> were<00:00:08.069> rated<00:00:08.460> around<00:00:08.730> 25

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
high-speed quad and were rated around 25

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.259 
high-speed quad and were rated around 25
horsepower<00:00:09.830> and<00:00:10.830> you<00:00:11.010> made<00:00:11.670> a<00:00:11.700> comment<00:00:12.059> about

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
horsepower and you made a comment about

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:13.700 
horsepower and you made a comment about
it<00:00:12.570> to<00:00:12.719> me<00:00:12.840> the<00:00:13.049> other<00:00:13.200> day

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
it to me the other day

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.599 
it to me the other day
yeah<00:00:14.429> well<00:00:14.759> it's<00:00:14.849> a<00:00:15.030> it's<00:00:15.059> a<00:00:15.450> complex<00:00:16.049> engine

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:16.609 
yeah well it's a it's a complex engine

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:21.290 
yeah well it's a it's a complex engine
that<00:00:17.609> I<00:00:18.119> think<00:00:18.779> that<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.430> alto<00:00:20.430> company<00:00:20.939> was

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
that I think that the alto company was

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.800 
that I think that the alto company was
kind<00:00:21.570> of<00:00:21.660> going<00:00:21.869> down<00:00:21.930> a<00:00:22.080> path<00:00:22.170> that<00:00:22.769> was

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:23.810 
kind of going down a path that was

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.500 
kind of going down a path that was
really<00:00:24.810> a<00:00:25.250> very<00:00:26.250> complex<00:00:26.699> engine<00:00:27.119> for<00:00:27.300> people

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
really a very complex engine for people

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.390 
really a very complex engine for people
to<00:00:27.630> run<00:00:27.810> and<00:00:28.080> probably<00:00:28.830> not

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
to run and probably not

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.370 
to run and probably not
I<00:00:29.429> think<00:00:30.029> somebody<00:00:30.390> in<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.720> antique<00:00:31.019> outboard

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
I think somebody in the antique outboard

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.620 
I think somebody in the antique outboard
motor<00:00:31.560> club<00:00:31.800> stated<00:00:32.610> a<00:00:32.790> few<00:00:32.969> years<00:00:33.180> ago<00:00:33.329> that

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
motor club stated a few years ago that

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.900 
motor club stated a few years ago that
it<00:00:33.750> was<00:00:33.870> an<00:00:33.989> engineers<00:00:34.469> engine<00:00:35.280> for<00:00:35.460> engineers

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
it was an engineers engine for engineers

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.209 
it was an engineers engine for engineers
and<00:00:37.430> but<00:00:38.430> anyway<00:00:38.520> it's<00:00:39.440> it's<00:00:40.440> an<00:00:40.530> example<00:00:40.860> it's

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
and but anyway it's it's an example it's

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.209 
and but anyway it's it's an example it's
a<00:00:41.280> good<00:00:41.430> example<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.920> poppet<00:00:43.920> valves

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
a good example and a poppet valves

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.600 
a good example and a poppet valves
always<00:00:44.460> stick<00:00:44.670> and<00:00:45.770> the<00:00:46.770> factory<00:00:47.219> must<00:00:47.460> have

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
always stick and the factory must have

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.610 
always stick and the factory must have
realized<00:00:48.030> or<00:00:48.360> dealers<00:00:48.840> must<00:00:49.050> have<00:00:49.140> realized

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
realized or dealers must have realized

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:58.189 
realized or dealers must have realized
that<00:00:50.520> that<00:00:50.670> happens<00:00:51.360> so<00:00:56.360> this<00:00:57.360> holes<00:00:57.719> drilled

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
that that happens so this holes drilled

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.920 
that that happens so this holes drilled
under<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.649> carbs<00:00:59.039> under<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.030> bodies<00:01:00.660> of<00:01:00.870> the

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
under the carbs under the bodies of the

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:10.490 
under the carbs under the bodies of the
carbs<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.609> this<00:01:02.609> wire<00:01:09.170> there's<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.229> hole<00:01:10.470> here

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
carbs and this wire there's a hole here

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.850 
carbs and this wire there's a hole here
someplace<00:01:14.509> so<00:01:15.509> you<00:01:15.570> can<00:01:15.810> you<00:01:16.259> can<00:01:16.409> push<00:01:16.619> the

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
someplace so you can you can push the

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.190 
someplace so you can you can push the
get<00:01:17.310> one<00:01:17.549> side<00:01:17.820> going<00:01:18.119> well<00:01:18.810> I'm<00:01:18.900> gonna<00:01:19.020> do

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
get one side going well I'm gonna do

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.780 
get one side going well I'm gonna do
them<00:01:19.320> all<00:01:19.470> okay<00:01:20.070> you<00:01:20.130> can<00:01:20.310> do<00:01:20.430> them<00:01:20.580> all<00:01:20.729> on

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
them all okay you can do them all on

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.149 
them all okay you can do them all on
this<00:01:21.030> one<00:01:21.210> okay<00:01:24.320> if<00:01:25.320> you<00:01:25.439> listen<00:01:25.799> you<00:01:25.890> can<00:01:25.920> hear

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
this one okay if you listen you can hear

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.980 
this one okay if you listen you can hear
it<00:01:26.250> going<00:01:26.369> yeah<00:01:26.880> that's<00:01:27.150> getting<00:01:27.330> fuel<00:01:27.720> into

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
it going yeah that's getting fuel into

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.260 
it going yeah that's getting fuel into
the<00:01:28.049> crankcase<00:01:28.380> no<00:01:29.280> it's<00:01:29.670> just<00:01:29.880> getting<00:01:30.150> the

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
the crankcase no it's just getting the

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.719 
the crankcase no it's just getting the
valves<00:01:30.689> unstuck<00:01:31.320> okay<00:01:31.979> does<00:01:32.400> this<00:01:32.430> thing

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
valves unstuck okay does this thing

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.359 
valves unstuck okay does this thing
instead<00:01:33.030> of<00:01:33.090> having<00:01:33.420> read<00:01:33.689> valves<00:01:34.170> it<00:01:34.290> has<00:01:34.500> it

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
instead of having read valves it has it

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.410 
instead of having read valves it has it
has<00:01:35.549> a<00:01:36.200> lot<00:01:37.200> of<00:01:37.320> motive<00:01:37.619> type<00:01:37.860> air<00:01:38.700> actuated

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
has a lot of motive type air actuated

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.120 
has a lot of motive type air actuated
valves<00:01:39.930> when<00:01:40.079> there's<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.290> vacuum<00:01:40.500> behind<00:01:40.860> them

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
valves when there's a vacuum behind them

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.880 
valves when there's a vacuum behind them
they<00:01:41.250> open<00:01:41.579> up<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:42.420> pulling<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.140> gas<00:01:43.560> air

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
they open up and pulling the gas air

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.090 
they open up and pulling the gas air
mixture<00:01:44.340> which<00:01:45.299> is<00:01:45.600> on<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.140> rim<00:01:46.439> of<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.860> of

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
mixture which is on the rim of the of

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:59.780 
mixture which is on the rim of the of
the<00:01:47.430> valve<00:01:56.930> so<00:01:57.930> starting<00:01:58.469> is<00:01:58.700> accomplished<00:01:59.700> by

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
the valve so starting is accomplished by

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.090 
the valve so starting is accomplished by
rocking<00:02:00.659> fuel<00:02:01.079> and<00:02:01.380> there's<00:02:01.619> no<00:02:01.770> chokes

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
rocking fuel and there's no chokes

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:37.710 
rocking fuel and there's no chokes
there's<00:02:02.460> no<00:02:02.579> problem

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.570 

so<00:02:38.720> hot<00:02:39.230> starting<00:02:39.770> these<00:02:39.920> engines<00:02:40.280> flood

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
so hot starting these engines flood

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.330 
so hot starting these engines flood
really<00:02:41.120> easy<00:02:41.450> and<00:02:41.920> if<00:02:42.920> you<00:02:42.980> read<00:02:43.220> the

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
really easy and if you read the

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:44.590 
really easy and if you read the
instructions<00:02:43.640> they<00:02:44.060> actually<00:02:44.390> talk<00:02:44.570> about

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
instructions they actually talk about

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.260 
instructions they actually talk about
when<00:02:45.560> you're<00:02:45.710> idling<00:02:46.250> in<00:02:46.460> or<00:02:46.670> about<00:02:46.910> to<00:02:47.060> shut

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
when you're idling in or about to shut

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.020 
when you're idling in or about to shut
the<00:02:47.360> engine<00:02:47.630> off<00:02:47.720> to<00:02:47.960> close<00:02:48.610> both<00:02:49.610> mixture

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
the engine off to close both mixture

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.820 
the engine off to close both mixture
screws<00:02:50.330> almost<00:02:50.930> all<00:02:51.140> the<00:02:51.230> way<00:02:51.320> off<00:02:51.500> or<00:02:51.770> even

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
screws almost all the way off or even

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.070 
screws almost all the way off or even
shut<00:02:52.280> them<00:02:52.370> down<00:02:52.630> because<00:02:53.630> it'll<00:02:54.250> every<00:02:55.250> time

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
shut them down because it'll every time

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.620 
shut them down because it'll every time
every<00:02:57.080> time<00:02:57.520> you<00:02:58.520> do<00:02:58.700> that<00:02:58.730> to<00:02:59.120> try<00:02:59.240> to<00:02:59.300> start

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
every time you do that to try to start

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.780 
every time you do that to try to start
it<00:02:59.810> it<00:03:00.470> takes<00:03:00.800> in<00:03:00.950> a<00:03:01.010> charge<00:03:01.280> so<00:03:01.580> if<00:03:01.670> it's

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
it it takes in a charge so if it's

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.580 
it it takes in a charge so if it's
already<00:03:02.120> flooded<00:03:02.390> and<00:03:02.720> you<00:03:03.110> keep<00:03:03.290> trying<00:03:03.470> to

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
already flooded and you keep trying to

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.140 
already flooded and you keep trying to
start<00:03:03.890> it<00:03:04.040> you<00:03:04.190> get<00:03:04.340> it<00:03:04.430> flip<00:03:04.670> more<00:03:04.850> and<00:03:05.000> more

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
start it you get it flip more and more

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.830 
start it you get it flip more and more
and<00:03:05.270> more<00:03:05.390> flooded<00:03:06.940> this<00:03:07.940> one's<00:03:08.210> not<00:03:08.390> really

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
and more flooded this one's not really

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.720 
and more flooded this one's not really
flooded<00:03:09.080> I<00:03:09.290> don't<00:03:09.440> think<00:03:09.620> so<00:03:09.800> I<00:03:09.830> think<00:03:10.010> it<00:03:10.160> made

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.440 

when<00:03:14.420> we<00:03:14.569> ran<00:03:14.720> it<00:03:14.930> you<00:03:15.020> saw<00:03:15.290> lots<00:03:15.500> of<00:03:15.620> smoke<00:03:15.830> and

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
when we ran it you saw lots of smoke and

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.170 
when we ran it you saw lots of smoke and
this<00:03:17.450> calls<00:03:17.720> for<00:03:17.900> a<00:03:18.440> pint<00:03:19.280> and<00:03:19.340> a<00:03:19.400> half<00:03:19.610> of<00:03:19.970> oil

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
this calls for a pint and a half of oil

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.080 
this calls for a pint and a half of oil
per<00:03:20.660> gallon<00:03:20.959> of<00:03:21.020> gasoline<00:03:21.230> and<00:03:21.770> which<00:03:22.670> is<00:03:22.819> a

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
per gallon of gasoline and which is a

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.050 
per gallon of gasoline and which is a
lot<00:03:23.360> way<00:03:23.900> real<00:03:24.440> up<00:03:24.620> by<00:03:24.740> today's<00:03:25.040> standards<00:03:25.490> but

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
lot way real up by today's standards but

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.350 
lot way real up by today's standards but
there's<00:03:26.270> really<00:03:26.569> important<00:03:27.880> to<00:03:28.880> know<00:03:29.060> that

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
there's really important to know that

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.120 
there's really important to know that
this<00:03:29.480> engine<00:03:29.870> is<00:03:30.050> a<00:03:30.080> plane<00:03:30.410> bearing<00:03:30.650> engine

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
this engine is a plane bearing engine

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:32.850 
this engine is a plane bearing engine
there's<00:03:31.370> not<00:03:31.490> a<00:03:31.520> roller<00:03:31.790> bearing<00:03:32.209> in<00:03:32.330> it<00:03:32.480> and

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
there's not a roller bearing in it and

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.930 
there's not a roller bearing in it and
these<00:03:33.860> engines<00:03:34.370> tend<00:03:34.640> to<00:03:34.910> self-destruct<00:03:35.810> and

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
these engines tend to self-destruct and

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.940 
these engines tend to self-destruct and
when<00:03:37.940> you<00:03:38.030> look<00:03:38.240> at<00:03:38.420> a<00:03:38.450> few<00:03:38.840> examples<00:03:39.020> over<00:03:39.860> the

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
when you look at a few examples over the

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.760 
when you look at a few examples over the
years<00:03:40.190> you<00:03:40.400> can<00:03:40.550> see<00:03:40.880> some<00:03:41.620> connecting<00:03:42.620> rod

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:42.770 
years you can see some connecting rod

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:44.530 
years you can see some connecting rod
breakage<00:03:43.160> damage<00:03:43.610> marks<00:03:44.060> inside<00:03:44.390> the

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
breakage damage marks inside the

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.990 
breakage damage marks inside the
crankcase<00:03:44.930> and<00:03:44.959> also<00:03:45.470> there<00:03:45.790> they<00:03:46.790> need<00:03:46.970> a

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
crankcase and also there they need a

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.910 
crankcase and also there they need a
lots<00:03:47.180> of<00:03:47.270> oil<00:03:47.360> to<00:03:47.660> stay<00:03:48.020> together<00:03:48.170> and

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
lots of oil to stay together and

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.250 
lots of oil to stay together and
especially<00:03:49.730> the<00:03:50.120> high-speed<00:03:50.570> version<00:03:51.110> which

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
especially the high-speed version which

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.030 
especially the high-speed version which
this<00:03:51.440> is<00:03:51.650> it<00:03:52.280> has<00:03:52.489> exhilarate<00:03:53.120> air<00:03:53.300> intakes

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
this is it has exhilarate air intakes

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.830 
this is it has exhilarate air intakes
under<00:03:55.040> the<00:03:55.160> exhaust<00:03:55.459> ports<00:03:55.820> which<00:03:56.000> which<00:03:56.300> draw

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
under the exhaust ports which which draw

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.280 
under the exhaust ports which which draw
in<00:03:57.250> fresh<00:03:58.250> charged<00:03:58.519> air<00:03:58.850> which<00:03:59.690> doesn't<00:04:00.140> have

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
in fresh charged air which doesn't have

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.410 
in fresh charged air which doesn't have
any<00:04:00.590> fuel<00:04:00.890> in<00:04:01.070> it<00:04:01.190> so<00:04:01.370> it<00:04:01.519> tends<00:04:01.760> to<00:04:01.880> lean<00:04:02.209> the

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:02.420 
any fuel in it so it tends to lean the

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.360 
any fuel in it so it tends to lean the
engine<00:04:02.690> a<00:04:02.750> lot<00:04:02.900> and<00:04:03.230> that's<00:04:03.739> why<00:04:03.920> you<00:04:03.980> have<00:04:04.220> two

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
engine a lot and that's why you have two

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:05.710 
engine a lot and that's why you have two
really<00:04:04.519> rich<00:04:04.880> in<00:04:05.030> the<00:04:05.150> engine<00:04:05.390> and<00:04:05.420> once<00:04:05.600> you

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
really rich in the engine and once you

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.180 
really rich in the engine and once you
get<00:04:05.870> running<00:04:06.140> over<00:04:06.440> a<00:04:06.470> certain<00:04:06.680> speed<00:04:07.040> you

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
get running over a certain speed you

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.009 
get running over a certain speed you
have<00:04:07.340> to<00:04:07.430> actually<00:04:07.970> really<00:04:08.239> really<00:04:08.570> rich<00:04:08.900> in

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019 
have to actually really really rich in

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:12.850 
have to actually really really rich in
it<00:04:09.140> up<00:04:09.260> so<00:04:10.840> so<00:04:11.840> you<00:04:11.930> virtually<00:04:12.080> did<00:04:12.410> someone

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:12.860 
it up so so you virtually did someone

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.199 
it up so so you virtually did someone
from<00:04:12.950> heaven<00:04:13.340> or<00:04:13.459> to<00:04:13.730> run<00:04:14.230> to<00:04:15.230> keep<00:04:15.410> it<00:04:15.530> going

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
from heaven or to run to keep it going

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:18.610 
from heaven or to run to keep it going
that's<00:04:17.209> why<00:04:17.329> I<00:04:17.359> think<00:04:17.780> I<00:04:17.840> said<00:04:18.049> before<00:04:18.169> this<00:04:18.560> is

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
that's why I think I said before this is

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.890 
that's why I think I said before this is
not<00:04:18.769> my<00:04:19.459> Ken<00:04:19.700> this<00:04:19.850> is<00:04:20.030> a<00:04:20.060> mechanic's<00:04:20.660> or<00:04:20.810> an

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
not my Ken this is a mechanic's or an

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.080 
not my Ken this is a mechanic's or an
engineer's<00:04:21.350> motor<00:04:21.620> oh<00:04:21.859> yeah<00:04:22.100> yeah<00:04:22.430> sure<00:04:22.790> is<00:04:23.060> a

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
engineer's motor oh yeah yeah sure is a

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.870 
engineer's motor oh yeah yeah sure is a
lot<00:04:23.540> of<00:04:23.600> them<00:04:23.840> okay<00:04:24.020> now<00:04:24.169> the<00:04:24.729> competition<00:04:25.729> for

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
lot of them okay now the competition for

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.560 
lot of them okay now the competition for
this<00:04:26.000> this<00:04:26.750> engine<00:04:27.110> was<00:04:27.290> the<00:04:27.350> Johnson<00:04:28.220> V<00:04:28.580> 45

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
this this engine was the Johnson V 45

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:31.719 
this this engine was the Johnson V 45
okay<00:04:30.410> which<00:04:30.830> said<00:04:31.040> that<00:04:31.160> we're<00:04:31.280> soul<00:04:31.490> under

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:31.729 
okay which said that we're soul under

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:33.520 
okay which said that we're soul under
right<00:04:31.940> I<00:04:32.120> have<00:04:32.300> that<00:04:32.450> much<00:04:32.630> and<00:04:32.810> and<00:04:33.050> they're

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
right I have that much and and they're

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.800 
right I have that much and and they're
probably<00:04:34.040> even<00:04:34.340> faster<00:04:34.970> than<00:04:35.240> these<00:04:35.419> they're

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
probably even faster than these they're

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.350 
probably even faster than these they're
only<00:04:36.050> 40<00:04:36.440> cubic<00:04:36.800> inch<00:04:36.979> this<00:04:37.340> is<00:04:37.400> 50<00:04:37.850> cubic<00:04:38.180> inch

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
only 40 cubic inch this is 50 cubic inch

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.310 
only 40 cubic inch this is 50 cubic inch
yeah<00:04:38.690> okay

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 
yeah okay

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.340 
yeah okay
and<00:04:39.620> those<00:04:40.610> engines<00:04:41.090> are<00:04:41.270> much<00:04:41.479> less<00:04:41.870> complex

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 
and those engines are much less complex

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.710 
and those engines are much less complex
they're<00:04:42.680> actually<00:04:43.160> I<00:04:43.490> think<00:04:43.880> engineered<00:04:44.510> for

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
they're actually I think engineered for

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.360 
they're actually I think engineered for
most<00:04:44.990> people<00:04:45.290> to<00:04:45.380> run<00:04:45.560> them<00:04:45.710> I<00:04:45.890> have<00:04:46.250> the

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
most people to run them I have the

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.630 
most people to run them I have the
compression<00:04:46.700> release<00:04:47.000> charger<00:04:47.720> and<00:04:48.640> designs

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:49.640 
compression release charger and designs

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.930 
compression release charger and designs
and<00:04:49.790> bacteria<00:04:50.360> carburetor<00:04:50.900> now
