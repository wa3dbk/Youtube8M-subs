00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
thing is this is a top-of-the-range T

00:03:51.410 --> 00:04:03.660 
thing is this is a top-of-the-range T
spur<00:03:51.739> and<00:03:51.920> I've<00:03:51.980> got<00:03:52.190> head-up<00:03:52.519> display<00:03:52.970> here<00:04:00.160> I

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:16.390 

program<00:04:04.670> in<00:04:04.819> a<00:04:04.880> destination<00:04:05.389> in<00:04:05.930> the<00:04:06.230> now

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.560 

it<00:04:17.400> will<00:04:17.579> then<00:04:17.930> put<00:04:19.430> overlay<00:04:20.430> in<00:04:20.880> this<00:04:21.209> head-up

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
it will then put overlay in this head-up

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:22.820 
it will then put overlay in this head-up
display<00:04:21.900> where<00:04:22.019> we<00:04:22.109> get<00:04:22.259> to<00:04:22.380> a<00:04:22.410> junction<00:04:22.680> or

display where we get to a junction or
overlay<00:04:23.430> the<00:04:23.490> turn<00:04:23.940> signals<00:04:24.539> so<00:04:25.259> you're<00:04:25.500> going

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
overlay the turn signals so you're going

it's it's I think it's really impresses
me<00:04:45.870> this<00:04:46.500> one<00:04:46.710> is<00:04:46.860> fine<00:04:47.160> the<00:04:48.090> only<00:04:48.120> thing<00:04:48.750> is

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
me this one is fine the only thing is

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.650 
me this one is fine the only thing is
this<00:04:49.500> it's<00:04:50.370> being<00:04:50.910> all<00:04:51.120> sometimes<00:04:51.449> do<00:04:51.539> they

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
this it's being all sometimes do they

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.330 
this it's being all sometimes do they
estimate<00:04:52.139> how<00:04:52.380> long<00:04:52.410> it<00:04:52.710> will<00:04:52.919> take<00:04:52.979> you<00:04:53.310> to

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
estimate how long it will take you to

00:04:53.340 --> 00:05:01.850 
estimate how long it will take you to
get<00:04:56.090> 28<00:04:57.090> minute<00:04:57.539> 20<00:04:58.229> to<00:04:58.349> serve<00:04:59.599> 20<00:05:00.599> to<00:05:00.810> 5<00:05:01.349> days

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
get 28 minute 20 to serve 20 to 5 days

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.219 
get 28 minute 20 to serve 20 to 5 days
because<00:05:02.789> it's<00:05:02.940> got<00:05:03.210> a<00:05:03.240> traffic<00:05:03.660> functioning

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:04.229 
because it's got a traffic functioning

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:05.930 
because it's got a traffic functioning
they<00:05:04.320> knows<00:05:04.530> Robo<00:05:05.070> he<00:05:05.160> knows<00:05:05.400> where<00:05:05.669> traffic

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
they knows Robo he knows where traffic

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.270 
they knows Robo he knows where traffic
is<00:05:06.210> it<00:05:06.599> can<00:05:06.750> route<00:05:06.960> you<00:05:07.110> round<00:05:07.349> traffic<00:05:07.830> but<00:05:08.190> it

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 
is it can route you round traffic but it

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.040 
is it can route you round traffic but it
can't<00:05:08.550> seem<00:05:08.849> to<00:05:09.000> think<00:05:09.180> head<00:05:09.509> and<00:05:09.660> get<00:05:09.810> the<00:05:10.020> the

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.050 
can't seem to think head and get the the

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:11.990 
can't seem to think head and get the the
journey<00:05:10.800> and<00:05:11.160> work<00:05:11.370> out<00:05:11.550> where<00:05:11.669> the<00:05:11.759> traffic

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
journey and work out where the traffic

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.670 
journey and work out where the traffic
is<00:05:12.360> and<00:05:12.660> then<00:05:12.810> think<00:05:13.110> about<00:05:13.169> how<00:05:13.320> long<00:05:13.530> it's

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
is and then think about how long it's

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.500 
is and then think about how long it's
going<00:05:13.800> to<00:05:13.889> take<00:05:13.949> and<00:05:14.669> then<00:05:14.910> it<00:05:15.030> just<00:05:15.180> seems<00:05:15.360> to

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:15.510 
going to take and then it just seems to

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.750 
going to take and then it just seems to
assume<00:05:15.870> a<00:05:16.050> kind<00:05:16.260> of<00:05:16.349> average<00:05:16.620> speed<00:05:17.280> on<00:05:17.490> roads

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:17.760 
assume a kind of average speed on roads

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.279 
assume a kind of average speed on roads
yeah<00:05:18.210> and<00:05:18.330> it's<00:05:18.479> something<00:05:18.750> that's<00:05:18.990> something

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:19.289 
yeah and it's something that's something

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:20.899 
yeah and it's something that's something
that's<00:05:19.440> actually<00:05:19.560> quite<00:05:19.919> different<00:05:20.250> to<00:05:20.760> all

00:05:20.899 --> 00:05:20.909 
that's actually quite different to all

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:22.640 
that's actually quite different to all
the<00:05:20.940> other<00:05:21.090> navigations<00:05:21.900> I've<00:05:22.050> used<00:05:22.289> the<00:05:22.440> ones

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:22.650 
the other navigations I've used the ones

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:25.279 
the other navigations I've used the ones
and<00:05:22.830> things<00:05:22.979> like<00:05:23.099> how<00:05:23.280> these<00:05:23.490> in<00:05:23.639> BMWs<00:05:24.210> in<00:05:24.389> my

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:25.289 
and things like how these in BMWs in my

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:27.529 
and things like how these in BMWs in my
experience<00:05:26.039> do<00:05:26.400> tend<00:05:26.669> to<00:05:26.760> be<00:05:26.880> relatively

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:27.539 
experience do tend to be relatively

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:30.379 
experience do tend to be relatively
accurate<00:05:28.340> and<00:05:29.340> this<00:05:29.520> is<00:05:29.729> in<00:05:29.940> terms<00:05:30.150> of<00:05:30.270> you

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:30.389 
accurate and this is in terms of you

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:32.570 
accurate and this is in terms of you
actually<00:05:30.690> being<00:05:30.990> someone<00:05:31.500> time<00:05:31.800> is<00:05:32.070> just<00:05:32.250> next

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580 
actually being someone time is just next

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.629 
actually being someone time is just next
to<00:05:32.820> useless<00:05:33.620> so<00:05:34.620> I<00:05:34.650> find<00:05:34.979> that<00:05:35.070> a<00:05:35.159> bit<00:05:35.370> annoying

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:35.639 
to useless so I find that a bit annoying

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:38.000 
to useless so I find that a bit annoying
okay<00:05:36.300> so<00:05:36.360> anything<00:05:36.810> else<00:05:37.050> quickly<00:05:37.500> it's<00:05:37.889> all

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.010 
okay so anything else quickly it's all

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:40.159 
okay so anything else quickly it's all
design<00:05:38.520> details<00:05:39.060> I<00:05:39.330> find<00:05:39.840> this<00:05:39.930> really

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:40.169 
design details I find this really

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:41.899 
design details I find this really
offensive<00:05:40.650> the<00:05:41.039> fact<00:05:41.250> that<00:05:41.310> is<00:05:41.460> telling<00:05:41.699> me

00:05:41.899 --> 00:05:41.909 
offensive the fact that is telling me

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:43.969 
offensive the fact that is telling me
the<00:05:42.030> airbag<00:05:42.419> light<00:05:42.630> is<00:05:42.750> on<00:05:42.930> I<00:05:43.080> know<00:05:43.349> why<00:05:43.740> it's

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:43.979 
the airbag light is on I know why it's

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:46.430 
the airbag light is on I know why it's
there<00:05:44.280> it's<00:05:44.490> okaaaaay<00:05:45.389> they've<00:05:46.080> got<00:05:46.229> nowhere

two rear-facing child seat together but

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:52.249 
two rear-facing child seat together but
it's<00:05:50.970> that's<00:05:51.180> the<00:05:51.389> first<00:05:51.630> car<00:05:51.900> I've<00:05:52.020> seen

00:05:52.249 --> 00:05:52.259 
it's that's the first car I've seen

00:05:52.259 --> 00:05:54.080 
it's that's the first car I've seen
where<00:05:52.440> that's<00:05:52.620> on<00:05:52.740> all<00:05:52.919> the<00:05:53.159> time<00:05:53.400> because<00:05:53.940> it

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:54.090 
where that's on all the time because it

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:55.969 
where that's on all the time because it
makes<00:05:54.300> you<00:05:54.419> key<00:05:54.599> just<00:05:54.930> make<00:05:55.110> sure<00:05:55.320> you<00:05:55.500> do<00:05:55.860> be

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:55.979 
makes you key just make sure you do be

00:05:55.979 --> 00:05:57.860 
makes you key just make sure you do be
without<00:05:56.130> a<00:05:56.250> fuel<00:05:56.550> where<00:05:56.940> it's<00:05:57.630> not<00:05:57.810> really

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:57.870 
without a fuel where it's not really

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:59.570 
without a fuel where it's not really
that<00:05:58.169> I<00:05:58.380> think<00:05:58.680> it<00:05:58.740> just<00:05:58.919> looks<00:05:58.979> cheap<00:05:59.370> it's

00:05:59.570 --> 00:05:59.580 
that I think it just looks cheap it's

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:00.710 
that I think it just looks cheap it's
not<00:05:59.759> the<00:05:59.880> thing<00:06:00.030> there's<00:06:00.210> a<00:06:00.240> passenger<00:06:00.690> you

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:00.720
