00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
assume because once you get to the

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.990 
assume because once you get to the
castle<00:00:28.710> they're<00:00:29.160> gonna<00:00:29.250> have<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:29.490> find<00:00:29.730> them

and<00:01:59.930> we<00:02:00.930> can't<00:02:01.229> just<00:02:01.500> leave<00:02:01.799> him<00:02:02.009> you<00:02:02.219> know

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
and we can't just leave him you know

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.539 
and we can't just leave him you know
what<00:02:02.460> I<00:02:02.520> mean<00:02:02.549> like<00:02:02.969> we<00:02:03.509> can't<00:02:03.840> just<00:02:04.310> let<00:02:05.310> this

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
what I mean like we can't just let this

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.529 
what I mean like we can't just let this
be<00:02:05.850> for<00:02:06.090> naught<00:02:06.240> because<00:02:07.819> what<00:02:08.819> law<00:02:09.000> did<00:02:09.060> was

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
be for naught because what law did was

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.730 
be for naught because what law did was
very<00:02:09.750> stupid<00:02:10.550> but<00:02:11.550> whatever

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
very stupid but whatever

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.100 
very stupid but whatever
he<00:02:13.040> got<00:02:13.220> shot<00:02:13.520> and<00:02:13.820> he's<00:02:14.180> down<00:02:14.630> for<00:02:14.990> the<00:02:15.050> count

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
he got shot and he's down for the count

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.800 
he got shot and he's down for the count
but<00:02:15.740> he's<00:02:15.830> not<00:02:16.070> dead<00:02:16.370> obviously<00:02:16.550> we<00:02:17.510> see<00:02:17.720> him

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
but he's not dead obviously we see him

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.780 
but he's not dead obviously we see him
and<00:02:18.050> they're<00:02:18.740> talking<00:02:18.950> about<00:02:19.190> him<00:02:19.580> not<00:02:19.760> being

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
and they're talking about him not being

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.190 
and they're talking about him not being
dead<00:02:20.300> or<00:02:20.540> implying<00:02:21.320> that<00:02:21.710> and<00:02:22.930> we<00:02:23.930> see<00:02:24.170> that

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
dead or implying that and we see that

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.150 
dead or implying that and we see that
they<00:02:24.650> want<00:02:24.890> monoski<00:02:25.400> which<00:02:26.180> was<00:02:27.110> for<00:02:27.950> some

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
they want monoski which was for some

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.440 
they want monoski which was for some
reason<00:02:28.490> I<00:02:28.580> don't<00:02:28.640> know<00:02:28.790> why<00:02:28.880> they<00:02:29.150> want<00:02:29.360> him

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
reason I don't know why they want him

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:30.850 
reason I don't know why they want him
they<00:02:29.570> probably<00:02:29.810> the<00:02:30.230> only<00:02:30.350> reason<00:02:30.800> I'm

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
they probably the only reason I'm

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.680 
they probably the only reason I'm
guessing<00:02:31.310> they<00:02:31.430> want<00:02:31.670> him<00:02:31.760> it<00:02:32.240> may<00:02:32.510> be<00:02:32.570> a

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
guessing they want him it may be a

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.330 
guessing they want him it may be a
research<00:02:33.140> subject<00:02:33.790> because<00:02:35.740> he<00:02:36.740> ate<00:02:36.950> the

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
research subject because he ate the

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.540 
research subject because he ate the
devil<00:02:37.700> fruit<00:02:37.910> that<00:02:38.120> shouldn't<00:02:38.570> work<00:02:38.630> and<00:02:39.550> it

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
devil fruit that shouldn't work and it

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.460 
devil fruit that shouldn't work and it
worked<00:02:40.820> on<00:02:41.030> him<00:02:41.240> so<00:02:41.480> they're<00:02:41.660> probably<00:02:41.690> going

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
worked on him so they're probably going

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.500 
worked on him so they're probably going
to<00:02:42.590> try<00:02:42.890> to<00:02:42.950> figure<00:02:43.160> out<00:02:43.280> like<00:02:43.520> why<00:02:43.760> and<00:02:44.330> like

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
to try to figure out like why and like

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.000 
to try to figure out like why and like
all<00:02:44.690> that<00:02:44.900> so<00:02:45.170> they're<00:02:45.350> probably<00:02:45.380> trying<00:02:45.860> to

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
all that so they're probably trying to

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.290 
all that so they're probably trying to
make<00:02:46.130> him<00:02:46.280> like<00:02:46.430> a<00:02:46.460> test<00:02:46.730> subject<00:02:46.910> or

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
make him like a test subject or

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.200 
make him like a test subject or
something<00:02:47.600> like<00:02:47.690> that<00:02:47.750> and<00:02:49.300> we<00:02:50.300> see<00:02:50.570> that<00:02:50.810> a

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.210 
something like that and we see that a

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:55.540 
something like that and we see that a
Caesar<00:02:53.210> is<00:02:53.600> wanted<00:02:54.230> by<00:02:54.260> Big<00:02:54.590> Ma<00:02:54.770> and<00:02:55.040> he

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
Caesar is wanted by Big Ma and he

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:56.650 
Caesar is wanted by Big Ma and he
doesn't<00:02:55.790> want<00:02:55.910> to<00:02:55.970> go<00:02:56.060> there<00:02:56.240> because<00:02:56.390> he

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
doesn't want to go there because he

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.750 
doesn't want to go there because he
siphoned<00:02:57.080> money<00:02:57.230> off<00:02:57.410> her<00:02:57.590> and<00:02:57.800> all<00:02:57.890> that<00:02:58.100> dumb

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
siphoned money off her and all that dumb

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.880 
siphoned money off her and all that dumb
 you<00:02:59.120> know<00:02:59.420> Caesar<00:02:59.720> like<00:03:00.110> I<00:03:00.380> can<00:03:00.560> expect

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
 you know Caesar like I can expect

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.190 
 you know Caesar like I can expect
some<00:03:01.100> some<00:03:01.700> like<00:03:01.730> that<00:03:01.880> from<00:03:02.210> him<00:03:02.390> and<00:03:02.660> I

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
some some like that from him and I

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.000

the counter of the puppet puppet fruit
would<00:05:52.700> be<00:05:52.880> in<00:05:52.940> a<00:05:53.090> rubber<00:05:53.360> is<00:05:53.660> sword<00:05:54.080> and<00:05:54.530> you

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:55.190 
would be in a rubber is sword and you

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:57.430 
would be in a rubber is sword and you
know<00:05:55.310> fire<00:05:55.640> is<00:05:55.940> water<00:05:56.240> and<00:05:56.660> all<00:05:56.780> that<00:05:56.990> but<00:05:57.170> fire

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:57.440 
know fire is water and all that but fire

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.520 
know fire is water and all that but fire
vs<00:05:57.800> water<00:05:58.010> it<00:05:58.490> would<00:05:58.580> be<00:05:58.730> basically<00:05:58.970> even<00:05:59.530> so

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:00.530 
vs water it would be basically even so

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:03.120 
vs water it would be basically even so
we'll<00:06:00.710> see<00:06:00.890> how<00:06:00.920> all<00:06:01.280> this<00:06:01.820> goes<00:06:02.000> down

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:03.130 
we'll see how all this goes down

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:04.960 
we'll see how all this goes down
tell<00:06:04.130> me<00:06:04.220> what<00:06:04.370> y'all<00:06:04.520> thought<00:06:04.640> about<00:06:04.850> this
