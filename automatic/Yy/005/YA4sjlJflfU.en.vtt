00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:17.079 

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:20.529 

or<00:01:18.079> you<00:01:18.770> could<00:01:19.009> lay<00:01:19.280> it<00:01:19.399> down<00:01:19.609> put<00:01:20.000> the<00:01:20.030> perfect

00:01:20.529 --> 00:01:20.539 
or you could lay it down put the perfect

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:27.270 
or you could lay it down put the perfect
nut<00:01:20.719> on<00:01:20.899> it<00:01:20.929> or<00:01:21.890> you<00:01:22.009> could<00:01:22.130> play<00:01:22.310> without<00:01:22.549> it

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.699 

if<00:01:28.280> you<00:01:28.429> hear<00:01:28.670> I'm<00:01:29.000> when<00:01:29.929> I<00:01:29.959> slide<00:01:30.319> I'm<00:01:30.560> going

00:01:30.699 --> 00:01:30.709 
if you hear I'm when I slide I'm going

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:31.990 
if you hear I'm when I slide I'm going
to<00:01:30.770> hit<00:01:30.920> those<00:01:31.100> frets<00:01:31.429> once<00:01:31.670> in<00:01:31.789> a<00:01:31.850> while

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
to hit those frets once in a while

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.399 
to hit those frets once in a while
because<00:01:32.179> it<00:01:32.450> takes<00:01:32.600> a<00:01:32.750> lot<00:01:32.899> lighter<00:01:33.140> touch

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
because it takes a lot lighter touch

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:35.859 
because it takes a lot lighter touch
because<00:01:33.890> our<00:01:34.100> strings<00:01:34.819> are<00:01:35.030> way<00:01:35.209> close<00:01:35.539> to<00:01:35.750> the

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
because our strings are way close to the

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:52.730 
because our strings are way close to the
neck<00:01:36.109> so<00:01:36.740> it's<00:01:37.069> nice<00:01:37.310> to<00:01:37.549> just<00:01:37.969> lift<00:01:38.689> those<00:01:38.990> up

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.410 

so<00:01:53.740> it<00:01:53.860> sounds<00:01:54.159> just<00:01:54.219> like<00:01:54.670> a<00:01:54.729> square<00:01:55.210> neck

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
so it sounds just like a square neck

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.649 
so it sounds just like a square neck
guitar<00:01:55.710> if<00:01:56.710> you<00:01:56.920> noticed<00:01:57.250> it's<00:01:57.399> round<00:01:57.700> no

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:58.659 
guitar if you noticed it's round no

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:00.600 
guitar if you noticed it's round no
problems<00:01:59.320> there<00:01:59.409> you<00:01:59.680> can<00:01:59.770> play<00:01:59.950> it<00:01:59.979> any<00:02:00.250> way

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
problems there you can play it any way

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.270 
problems there you can play it any way
you<00:02:00.640> like<00:02:00.990> when<00:02:01.990> you<00:02:02.110> come<00:02:02.350> back<00:02:02.890> to<00:02:03.130> the

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
you like when you come back to the

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.450 
you like when you come back to the
square<00:02:03.700> neck<00:02:03.939> bilbro<00:02:04.920> you're<00:02:05.920> never<00:02:06.159> going<00:02:06.399> to

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
square neck bilbro you're never going to

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.710 
square neck bilbro you're never going to
play<00:02:07.649> regular<00:02:08.649> guitar<00:02:08.800> on<00:02:09.130> this<00:02:09.539> let's<00:02:10.539> say

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
play regular guitar on this let's say

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.000 
play regular guitar on this let's say
that's<00:02:10.899> three<00:02:11.230> eighths<00:02:11.349> of<00:02:11.530> an<00:02:11.650> inch<00:02:11.739> off<00:02:11.980> the

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
that's three eighths of an inch off the

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.030 
that's three eighths of an inch off the
neck<00:02:12.370> and<00:02:12.550> you're<00:02:12.700> going<00:02:12.819> to<00:02:12.880> hurt<00:02:13.000> yourself

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
to a lower tuning we could make it sound

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.300 
to a lower tuning we could make it sound
more<00:02:25.420> bluesy<00:02:25.930> right<00:02:26.319> now<00:02:26.470> it's<00:02:26.709> tuned<00:02:27.099> to

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310
