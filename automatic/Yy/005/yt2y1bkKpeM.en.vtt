00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
itself and the second half what we do is

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.110 
itself and the second half what we do is
we<00:00:59.720> store<00:01:00.050> a<00:01:00.290> sharing<00:01:01.010> optimized<00:01:01.489> format

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
we store a sharing optimized format

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.660 
we store a sharing optimized format
where<00:01:02.870> we<00:01:02.989> can<00:01:03.140> store<00:01:03.260> up<00:01:03.410> to<00:01:03.620> four<00:01:04.040> hours<00:01:04.430> on

where we can store up to four hours on
the<00:01:04.790> device<00:01:05.119> let's<00:01:05.510> squeeze<00:01:05.840> this<00:01:06.050> button<00:01:06.790> and

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
the device let's squeeze this button and

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.030 
the device let's squeeze this button and
I<00:01:07.970> just<00:01:08.210> captured<00:01:08.630> the<00:01:08.720> last<00:01:08.960> 30<00:01:09.260> seconds<00:01:09.800> of

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
I just captured the last 30 seconds of

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.150 
I just captured the last 30 seconds of
video<00:01:10.720> stored<00:01:11.720> it<00:01:11.810> as<00:01:11.899> an<00:01:12.080> mp4<00:01:12.680> file<00:01:12.890> in<00:01:13.070> the

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:13.160 
video stored it as an mp4 file in the

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.100 
video stored it as an mp4 file in the
clips<00:01:13.399> folder<00:01:13.820> on<00:01:13.970> the<00:01:14.000> device<00:01:14.450> so<00:01:14.780> now<00:01:14.960> I<00:01:14.990> can

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
clips folder on the device so now I can

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.300 
clips folder on the device so now I can
see<00:01:15.500> it<00:01:15.619> here<00:01:16.000> so<00:01:17.000> for<00:01:17.270> example<00:01:18.100> here's<00:01:19.100> the

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
see it here so for example here's the

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.870 
see it here so for example here's the
clips<00:01:19.610> I've<00:01:19.820> taken<00:01:20.090> it<00:01:20.330> the<00:01:20.509> show<00:01:21.460> on<00:01:22.460> the<00:01:22.520> look

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
clips I've taken it the show on the look

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.700 
clips I've taken it the show on the look
see

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
see

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.130 
see
and<00:01:24.950> they<00:01:25.400> appear<00:01:26.270> as<00:01:26.390> any<00:01:26.540> other<00:01:26.630> you<00:01:27.110> know

and they appear as any other you know

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.740 
and they appear as any other you know
video<00:01:27.409> playlist<00:01:28.100> and<00:01:28.940> this<00:01:29.150> just<00:01:29.360> happens<00:01:29.659> to

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
video playlist and this just happens to

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.570 
video playlist and this just happens to
be<00:01:29.810> some<00:01:30.140> video<00:01:30.470> of<00:01:30.530> the<00:01:30.770> show<00:01:31.010> that<00:01:31.280> we<00:01:31.369> took

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:31.580 
be some video of the show that we took

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.160 
be some video of the show that we took
early<00:01:32.000> and<00:01:32.210> how<00:01:32.540> is<00:01:32.600> it<00:01:32.780> how<00:01:33.020> is<00:01:33.050> it

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
early and how is it how is it

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.560 
early and how is it how is it
communicating<00:01:33.860> as<00:01:33.950> a<00:01:34.040> pollutant<00:01:34.250> it<00:01:34.610> is<00:01:34.909> it<00:01:35.420> is

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
communicating as a pollutant it is it is

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.600 
communicating as a pollutant it is it is
