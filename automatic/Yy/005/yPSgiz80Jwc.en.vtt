00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
and it's actually straighter in the back

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.279 
and it's actually straighter in the back
and<00:02:07.700> it's<00:02:08.700> very<00:02:09.060> unmanageable<00:02:09.720> and<00:02:10.080> I've

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
and it's very unmanageable and I've

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:10.669 
and it's very unmanageable and I've
never

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
never

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:23.030 
did it and you procedure costs about two
hundred<00:02:21.329> fifty<00:02:21.629> dollars<00:02:22.140> that's<00:02:22.349> just<00:02:22.680> for

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
hundred fifty dollars that's just for

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.170 
hundred fifty dollars that's just for
that<00:02:23.340> procedure<00:02:23.640> i<00:02:24.000> also<00:02:24.269> had<00:02:24.599> my<00:02:24.810> hair

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
that procedure i also had my hair

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.089 
that procedure i also had my hair
highlighted<00:02:27.180> just<00:02:27.780> prior<00:02:28.049> to<00:02:28.079> that<00:02:28.439> that's<00:02:28.769> no

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
highlighted just prior to that that's no

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:31.309 
highlighted just prior to that that's no
issue<00:02:29.579> they<00:02:30.060> can<00:02:30.239> go<00:02:30.389> ahead<00:02:30.510> and<00:02:30.659> do<00:02:30.900> that<00:02:30.930> with

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
issue they can go ahead and do that with

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.860 
issue they can go ahead and do that with
this<00:02:31.349> treatment<00:02:31.769> and<00:02:32.159> i<00:02:33.030> let<00:02:33.450> me<00:02:33.540> also<00:02:33.689> say

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
this treatment and i let me also say

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.940 
this treatment and i let me also say
that<00:02:34.019> i<00:02:34.200> had<00:02:34.530> the<00:02:35.629> treatment<00:02:36.629> number<00:02:37.109> four<00:02:37.469> so

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
that i had the treatment number four so

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.699 
that i had the treatment number four so
i<00:02:37.980> had<00:02:38.280> the<00:02:38.629> most<00:02:39.629> intense<00:02:39.870> one<00:02:40.349> that<00:02:40.560> they

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
i had the most intense one that they

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.619 
i had the most intense one that they
offer<00:02:41.209> it<00:02:42.209> does<00:02:42.840> contain<00:02:43.349> formaldehyde<00:02:43.799> and

00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:44.629 
offer it does contain formaldehyde and

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:47.750 
offer it does contain formaldehyde and
the<00:02:45.650> variations<00:02:46.650> from<00:02:46.889> one<00:02:47.220> through<00:02:47.430> four<00:02:47.700> of

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
the variations from one through four of

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.720 
the variations from one through four of
it<00:02:48.030> actually<00:02:48.769> correlate<00:02:49.769> to<00:02:49.799> the<00:02:50.010> amount<00:02:50.489> the

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
it actually correlate to the amount the

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.610 
it actually correlate to the amount the
percentage<00:02:51.209> of<00:02:51.269> formaldehyde<00:02:51.659> so<00:02:52.439> this

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
percentage of formaldehyde so this

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.379 
percentage of formaldehyde so this
actually<00:02:52.799> has<00:02:53.159> four<00:02:53.459> percent<00:02:53.609> formaldehyde

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:54.389 
actually has four percent formaldehyde

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:55.699 
actually has four percent formaldehyde
in<00:02:54.540> it<00:02:54.659> and<00:02:54.750> I<00:02:54.810> know<00:02:54.870> everybody's<00:02:55.139> concerned

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
in it and I know everybody's concerned

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:57.949 
in it and I know everybody's concerned
about<00:02:55.950> the<00:02:56.069> formaldehyde<00:02:56.599> but<00:02:57.599> my

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
about the formaldehyde but my

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.140 
about the formaldehyde but my
hairdresser<00:02:58.560> wasn't<00:02:58.889> concerned<00:02:59.280> she

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
hairdresser wasn't concerned she

either side of me two feet away from us
and<00:03:12.329> they<00:03:12.569> had<00:03:12.780> no<00:03:12.810> idea<00:03:13.049> that<00:03:13.560> we<00:03:13.709> were<00:03:13.829> even

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
and they had no idea that we were even

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.159 
and they had no idea that we were even
doing<00:03:14.250> anything<00:03:14.609> with<00:03:14.879> formaldehyde<00:03:15.239> so<00:03:15.870> as

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:16.169 
doing anything with formaldehyde so as

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:17.240 
doing anything with formaldehyde so as
far<00:03:16.319> as<00:03:16.379> they<00:03:16.590> knew<00:03:16.739> my<00:03:16.919> hair<00:03:17.099> was<00:03:17.220> just

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
far as they knew my hair was just

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.879 
far as they knew my hair was just
getting<00:03:17.639> pressed<00:03:17.849> with<00:03:17.970> the<00:03:18.120> hot<00:03:18.269> iron<00:03:18.889> so

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:19.889 
getting pressed with the hot iron so

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:22.210 
getting pressed with the hot iron so
that<00:03:20.129> was<00:03:20.340> no<00:03:20.609> issue<00:03:20.849> it<00:03:21.269> could<00:03:21.299> also<00:03:21.659> be<00:03:21.840> that

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
that was no issue it could also be that

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.640 
that was no issue it could also be that
since<00:03:23.220> the<00:03:23.569> since<00:03:24.569> this<00:03:24.810> process<00:03:25.379> has<00:03:25.530> been

around since 2007 it may have evolved to

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.089 
around since 2007 it may have evolved to
the<00:03:28.500> point<00:03:28.620> where<00:03:29.159> you<00:03:29.639> know<00:03:29.790> they're<00:03:30.060> able<00:03:30.239> to

00:03:31.089 --> 00:03:31.099 
the point where you know they're able to

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:33.830 
the point where you know they're able to
deal<00:03:32.099> with<00:03:32.370> that<00:03:32.579> in<00:03:32.879> a<00:03:33.060> more<00:03:33.239> safe<00:03:33.510> manner

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
deal with that in a more safe manner

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.719 
deal with that in a more safe manner
than<00:03:34.169> they<00:03:34.319> were<00:03:34.379> and<00:03:34.829> maybe<00:03:35.099> the<00:03:35.310> earlier

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:47.390 
from 2007 as early as 2007-2008 you'll
probably<00:03:45.930> see<00:03:46.229> more<00:03:46.379> mention<00:03:46.799> of<00:03:46.949> people

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
probably see more mention of people

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.429 
probably see more mention of people
getting<00:03:48.120> sick<00:03:48.389> from<00:03:48.449> fumes<00:03:48.959> and<00:03:49.109> things<00:03:49.290> like

00:03:49.429 --> 00:03:49.439 
getting sick from fumes and things like

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:51.080 
getting sick from fumes and things like
that<00:03:49.500> well<00:03:49.859> there<00:03:50.009> was<00:03:50.129> no<00:03:50.159> fumes<00:03:50.579> involved<00:03:51.000> in

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
that well there was no fumes involved in

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.960 
that well there was no fumes involved in
this<00:03:51.209> and<00:03:51.780> it's<00:03:52.019> a<00:03:52.079> pretty<00:03:52.290> quick<00:03:52.530> procedure

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
this and it's a pretty quick procedure

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.759 
this and it's a pretty quick procedure
basically<00:03:53.970> she<00:03:54.750> did<00:03:54.959> the<00:03:55.109> highlights<00:03:55.259> on<00:03:55.650> my

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
basically she did the highlights on my

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:14.669 
it was not as damp and then she

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:17.449 
it was not as damp and then she
basically<00:04:15.090> brushed<00:04:15.629> the<00:04:16.079> solution<00:04:16.739> on<00:04:17.099> my

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
basically brushed the solution on my

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.539

hair<00:04:17.759> and<00:04:17.970> then

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
hair and then

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:23.379 
hair and then

he blow dried my hair straight using it
you<00:04:23.870> know<00:04:24.020> brush<00:04:24.379> and<00:04:24.590> all<00:04:24.680> that<00:04:24.949> with<00:04:25.370> the

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
you know brush and all that with the

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.390 
you know brush and all that with the
solution<00:04:26.090> in<00:04:26.240> my<00:04:26.389> ear<00:04:26.629> so<00:04:27.229> my<00:04:27.409> hair<00:04:27.650> was<00:04:27.889> pretty

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
solution in my ear so my hair was pretty

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.520 
solution in my ear so my hair was pretty
much<00:04:28.580> blow-dried<00:04:29.120> straight<00:04:29.509> then<00:04:30.139> she<00:04:30.379> went

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
much blow-dried straight then she went

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.180 
much blow-dried straight then she went
over<00:04:30.889> it<00:04:30.979> with<00:04:31.009> a<00:04:31.129> 450-degree<00:04:32.120> flat<00:04:32.780> iron<00:04:33.190> and

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190 
over it with a 450-degree flat iron and

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.610 
over it with a 450-degree flat iron and
I<00:04:35.060> guess<00:04:35.389> the<00:04:35.629> whole<00:04:35.780> the<00:04:36.199> whole<00:04:36.379> thing

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
I guess the whole the whole thing

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.020 
I guess the whole the whole thing
between<00:04:36.860> the<00:04:37.190> time<00:04:37.340> i<00:04:37.370> have<00:04:37.550> my<00:04:37.639> highlights

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
between the time i have my highlights

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:39.939 
between the time i have my highlights
dead<00:04:38.270> and<00:04:38.629> the<00:04:38.840> time<00:04:39.050> we<00:04:39.199> were<00:04:39.319> done<00:04:39.349> was<00:04:39.740> about

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:39.949 
dead and the time we were done was about

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:41.499 
dead and the time we were done was about
four<00:04:40.190> hours<00:04:40.340> didn't<00:04:41.030> seem<00:04:41.150> like<00:04:41.180> four<00:04:41.479> hours

00:04:41.499 --> 00:04:41.509 
four hours didn't seem like four hours

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:44.710 
four hours didn't seem like four hours
but<00:04:41.810> it<00:04:41.900> was<00:04:42.020> four<00:04:42.199> hours<00:04:43.360> she<00:04:44.360> told<00:04:44.599> me<00:04:44.690> I

extremely<00:04:49.819> porous<00:04:50.090> and<00:04:50.539> when<00:04:51.110> I've<00:04:51.259> done<00:04:51.440> that

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680

straightening treatment it's actually
conditioning<00:05:17.780> treatment<00:05:18.199> the<00:05:19.069> procedure<00:05:19.430> is

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:19.669 
conditioning treatment the procedure is

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:21.850 
conditioning treatment the procedure is
basically<00:05:20.180> ceiling<00:05:20.719> keratin<00:05:21.229> into<00:05:21.560> the<00:05:21.680> hair

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:21.860 
basically ceiling keratin into the hair

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:24.399 
basically ceiling keratin into the hair
shaft<00:05:21.889> and<00:05:22.460> what<00:05:23.419> that's<00:05:23.599> supposed<00:05:23.930> to<00:05:24.050> do<00:05:24.199> is

00:05:24.399 --> 00:05:24.409 
shaft and what that's supposed to do is

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:26.980 
shaft and what that's supposed to do is
it's<00:05:24.620> supposed<00:05:24.919> to<00:05:25.419> relax<00:05:26.419> it<00:05:26.750> at<00:05:26.840> least

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:26.990 
it's supposed to relax it at least

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:30.159 
it's supposed to relax it at least
temporarily<00:05:27.259> and<00:05:28.069> deal<00:05:28.460> with<00:05:28.639> frizz<00:05:28.940> so<00:05:29.300> if<00:05:29.990> i

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:30.169 
temporarily and deal with frizz so if i

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:32.999 
temporarily and deal with frizz so if i
end<00:05:30.380> up<00:05:30.500> with<00:05:30.560> my<00:05:30.860> hair<00:05:31.130> half<00:05:31.550> is<00:05:31.819> curly<00:05:32.599> and

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:33.009 
end up with my hair half is curly and

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:36.640 
end up with my hair half is curly and
you<00:05:34.009> know<00:05:34.130> half<00:05:34.880> less<00:05:35.180> frizzy<00:05:35.630> i<00:05:35.810> guess<00:05:36.229> you

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:36.650 
you know half less frizzy i guess you

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:38.019 
you know half less frizzy i guess you
know<00:05:36.770> i'll<00:05:36.979> be<00:05:37.009> happy<00:05:37.400> with<00:05:37.669> that<00:05:37.699> i'm<00:05:38.000> not

00:05:38.019 --> 00:05:38.029 
know i'll be happy with that i'm not

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:40.809 
know i'll be happy with that i'm not
expecting<00:05:38.509> it<00:05:38.840> to<00:05:39.289> be<00:05:39.319> a<00:05:39.620> straight<00:05:40.130> as<00:05:40.340> it<00:05:40.699> is

00:05:40.809 --> 00:05:40.819 
expecting it to be a straight as it is

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:42.909 
expecting it to be a straight as it is
now<00:05:41.150> this<00:05:41.690> is<00:05:41.900> typically<00:05:42.319> what<00:05:42.440> it<00:05:42.620> looks<00:05:42.770> like

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:42.919 
now this is typically what it looks like

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:45.459
