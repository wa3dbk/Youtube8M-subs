 I this version if you have a version of 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.660
 1.6 point 4 ford brand I want you not to 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.489
 matter this rhyme is for all and 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.769
 good to see what I have is 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:58.070
 this version and a truth will go to us 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:01:00.050
 date what's important here and we 're going 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.530
 to go to point minecraft we are going to what 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.899
 that version and here as you can see I 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.450
 I have all these do not veto the 1.5 point 

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:10.100
 2 I have several there there we have the 1.6 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.130
 point 4 I do not know if it 's the same but 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.660
 finish 883 we can not see it very clear 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.729
 Now what we're going to do is once 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.680
 we have installed it let's go to the 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:21.500
 that respects what is mods not here here 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.300
 is going to be already we saw what it is to clarify the 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:27.140
 Right click not if we do not just go 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:28.399
 to pass it does not matter we're going to cancel it and 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.750
 Now let's open our minecraft 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:32.240
 as you can see I have the minecraft 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.310
 premium but no matter what it is it's what 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.140

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.180
 and we're going to give you edit profiles 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.640
 phoenix fight says edit profile but 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.159

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.530
 until I upload these the news already 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:47.580

 enlarge screen 2 on a motorcycle and 

00:03:03.969 --> 00:03:07.870
 As you can see, there is already a minimal network 

00:03:05.469 --> 00:03:09.819
 installed there we go to the list and in case 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.859

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:13.719
 creator of the world are compared see penis 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:16.590

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:21.200
 we are going to give you minimal tests 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.200

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:41.500
 because they were behaving because you have so much 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:45.159

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:47.379
