00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:16.369
 Yes she 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.539
 proud of them 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:38.750
 here is 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.120
 this thesis 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.480
 for example 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.160
 martinez 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.160
 no 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.630
 according to an afp journalist 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:50.900
 since the end of April 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.900
 the maintenance of the sea level 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.400
 it is for this purpose 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.730
 what are we going to do was very kind thank you thirty years ago of 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.730
 reclusion its sales recover 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.740
 since May 20 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.320
 but if it is here 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.730
 you want it's no longer like being made today 1 5 ton it's 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:18.880
 really 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.660
 their first film 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.970
 and my husband also has 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.250
 you like these areas 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.800
 13h36m 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.500
 there is a natural stop 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.750
 you see we met him here as elsewhere 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.260
 at the Stade de France well in the tips that are good weather 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.130
 ancient 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.740
 did not you feel a little too scared I was surrounded by two women 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.160
 who are there to save themselves we can do the chain 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.979
 I have not looked at the rest of the women 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:49.780
 - if anne sinclair 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.260
 anyway it's my generation to another so I claim it indeed 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.260
 a train 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.450
 the decline of 6 4% 1 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:09.890
 not because they did 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.700
 as this garden of death undergoes a first fair of russell 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.069
 March 26th and so I thought I could continue to have it signed by 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.729
 the other members of the group what so 

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:22.109
 26 of his imprisoned fighters 

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:23.779
 March 28, 2009 

00:02:23.779 --> 00:02:28.279
 yes yes who was at the france stage the concert no unfortunately I have more 

00:02:28.279 --> 00:02:32.529
 room for him so this is the opportunity here tonight of the assembly quoted the 

00:02:32.529 --> 00:02:35.529
 big first this case yes really it was beautiful 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.019
 m 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:46.809
 today we can ask some questions 

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:49.809
 ways 

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:53.309
 I feel here during the screening 

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:55.569
 the dvd the member 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:57.980
 certainly the atmosphere at the stadium 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.279
 we are all behind this is a choice on his part 

00:03:00.279 --> 00:03:04.279
 the realism makes his work an intimate atmosphere a terrible 

00:03:04.279 --> 00:03:08.199
 what is getting ready in his white pants synonymous with party looks pretty 

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:10.519
 hot of distinctive experiences 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:13.519
 what do you like to dance in less than six months 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:17.579
 he also hit the mark 

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:20.259
 we like it or we do not like but it touches me enormously
