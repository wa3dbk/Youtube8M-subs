00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
functionality of the ability for this

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.320

thing<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.500> fold<00:01:16.710> in<00:01:16.860> on<00:01:16.979> itself<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:17.909> really

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
thing to fold in on itself and really

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.140 
thing to fold in on itself and really
pack<00:01:18.540> down<00:01:18.869> really<00:01:19.170> small<00:01:19.290> in<00:01:19.710> light<00:01:20.000> so<00:01:21.000> get

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
pack down really small in light so get

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.550 
pack down really small in light so get
yourself<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:21.479> good<00:01:21.630> pair<00:01:21.810> of<00:01:21.840> snips<00:01:22.049> home<00:01:22.290> depot

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
yourself a good pair of snips home depot

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.770 
yourself a good pair of snips home depot
has<00:01:22.740> them<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.159> some<00:01:23.820> wire<00:01:24.000> ties<00:01:24.270> you<00:01:24.570> can<00:01:24.689> use

has them and some wire ties you can use
different<00:01:24.930> sizes<00:01:25.470> but<00:01:25.650> on<00:01:25.740> this<00:01:25.860> one<00:01:26.070> the

the tent chandelier it hangs upside down

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.149 
the tent chandelier it hangs upside down
in<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.270> tent<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:39.720> produces<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.439> really<00:01:40.710> nice

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
in the tent and produces a really nice

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.670 
in the tent and produces a really nice
non<00:01:41.880> direct<00:01:42.360> light<00:01:42.689> that<00:01:43.200> you<00:01:43.320> can<00:01:43.439> leave<00:01:43.560> on

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
non direct light that you can leave on

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.810 
non direct light that you can leave on
all<00:01:43.710> night<00:01:44.040> because<00:01:44.250> these<00:01:44.340> batteries<00:01:44.700> will

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
all night because these batteries will

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:45.469 
all night because these batteries will
last<00:01:44.850> forever

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
last forever

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.359 
last forever
this<00:01:45.960> thing's<00:01:46.170> super<00:01:46.380> lightweight<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.310> you

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
this thing's super lightweight and you

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.399 
this thing's super lightweight and you
can<00:01:47.520> also<00:01:47.640> use<00:01:47.939> these<00:01:48.149> as<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.840> drying<00:01:49.229> mechanism

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
can also use these as a drying mechanism

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.109 
can also use these as a drying mechanism
for<00:01:49.890> socks<00:01:50.130> or<00:01:50.340> gloves<00:01:50.520> or<00:01:50.640> things<00:01:50.880> that<00:01:51.000> got

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
for socks or gloves or things that got

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.520 
for socks or gloves or things that got
wet<00:01:51.270> overnight<00:01:51.540> so<00:01:51.899> long<00:01:51.990> there's<00:01:52.170> no<00:01:52.259> moist

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
wet overnight so long there's no moist

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.770 
wet overnight so long there's no moist
not<00:01:52.829> soaking<00:01:53.250> wet<00:01:53.280> yeah<00:01:54.000> I<00:01:54.030> have<00:01:54.210> a<00:01:54.299> video<00:01:54.570> up

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
not soaking wet yeah I have a video up

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.870 
not soaking wet yeah I have a video up
where<00:01:54.930> you<00:01:54.990> can<00:01:55.110> actually<00:01:55.229> see<00:01:55.619> it<00:01:55.710> in<00:01:56.700> the

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
where you can actually see it in the

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:57.319 
where you can actually see it in the
tent

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
tent

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.530 
tent
in<00:01:57.509> action<00:01:57.990> so<00:01:58.770> this<00:01:59.670> thing's<00:01:59.909> really<00:02:00.210> simple

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
in action so this thing's really simple

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.260 
in action so this thing's really simple
to<00:02:00.630> make<00:02:00.780> basically<00:02:01.610> you<00:02:02.610> take<00:02:02.729> your<00:02:02.880> compact

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
to make basically you take your compact

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.450 
to make basically you take your compact
umbrella<00:02:03.689> frame<00:02:04.020> you<00:02:04.649> strip<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:04.979> fabric<00:02:05.310> off

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
umbrella frame you strip the fabric off

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.029 
umbrella frame you strip the fabric off
of<00:02:05.610> it<00:02:05.850> you<00:02:06.030> cut<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.390> extensions<00:02:06.869> off<00:02:07.079> so<00:02:07.829> this

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
of it you cut the extensions off so this

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.559 
of it you cut the extensions off so this
thing<00:02:08.280> folds<00:02:08.580> out<00:02:08.700> really<00:02:08.879> nice<00:02:09.090> and<00:02:09.119> small

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
thing folds out really nice and small

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.580 
thing folds out really nice and small
and<00:02:09.810> is<00:02:10.050> packable

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.180 

and<00:02:13.420> go<00:02:14.420> ahead<00:02:14.600> and<00:02:14.750> take<00:02:14.930> your<00:02:15.100> run<00:02:16.100> the

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
and go ahead and take your run the

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.610 
and go ahead and take your run the
lights<00:02:16.400> around<00:02:16.790> it<00:02:16.970> and<00:02:17.090> take<00:02:18.050> your<00:02:18.200> zip<00:02:18.380> ties

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
lights around it and take your zip ties

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.980 
lights around it and take your zip ties
and<00:02:19.040> zip<00:02:19.640> tie<00:02:19.790> your<00:02:19.940> lights<00:02:20.209> on<00:02:20.420> at<00:02:20.630> the<00:02:20.780> end

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
and zip tie your lights on at the end

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.900 
and zip tie your lights on at the end
now<00:02:21.770> what<00:02:21.920> you<00:02:22.010> want<00:02:22.160> to<00:02:22.190> be<00:02:22.280> careful<00:02:22.610> is<00:02:22.730> not

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
now what you want to be careful is not

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.420 
now what you want to be careful is not
to<00:02:23.450> zip<00:02:23.810> tie<00:02:23.840> them<00:02:24.170> too<00:02:24.380> close<00:02:24.740> in<00:02:24.980> because<00:02:25.310> if

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
to zip tie them too close in because if

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.370 
to zip tie them too close in because if
you<00:02:25.520> do<00:02:25.700> that<00:02:25.910> it'll<00:02:26.420> block<00:02:26.690> the<00:02:26.750> hinge<00:02:27.080> and

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
you do that it'll block the hinge and

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.020 
you do that it'll block the hinge and
won't<00:02:27.650> allow<00:02:27.950> it<00:02:27.980> to<00:02:28.250> actually<00:02:28.550> fold<00:02:28.730> in<00:02:28.910> on

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
won't allow it to actually fold in on

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.720 
won't allow it to actually fold in on
itself<00:02:29.230> so<00:02:30.230> the<00:02:30.890> farther<00:02:31.130> out<00:02:31.340> you<00:02:31.370> get<00:02:31.610> them

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
itself so the farther out you get them

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.090 
itself so the farther out you get them
on<00:02:31.819> the<00:02:31.910> extensions<00:02:32.480> with<00:02:33.470> as<00:02:33.590> much<00:02:33.709> wire<00:02:33.980> as

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
on the extensions with as much wire as

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.820 
on the extensions with as much wire as
you<00:02:34.130> can<00:02:34.340> possibly<00:02:34.760> afford<00:02:35.590> the<00:02:36.590> more<00:02:37.390> compact

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
you can possibly afford the more compact

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.020 
you can possibly afford the more compact
this<00:02:39.830> thing<00:02:40.040> will<00:02:40.130> become<00:02:40.459> and<00:02:40.640> the<00:02:40.700> easier<00:02:40.940> it

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
this thing will become and the easier it

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.930 
this thing will become and the easier it
is<00:02:41.090> to<00:02:41.150> pack<00:02:41.680> so<00:02:42.680> that's<00:02:42.860> basically<00:02:43.250> it<00:02:43.370> just

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
is to pack so that's basically it just

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.960 
is to pack so that's basically it just
make<00:02:44.090> sure<00:02:44.239> you<00:02:44.360> make<00:02:44.510> it<00:02:44.690> accessible<00:02:45.610> the<00:02:46.610> the

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
make sure you make it accessible the the

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.509 
make sure you make it accessible the the
light<00:02:47.450> switch<00:02:47.750> so<00:02:48.680> it's<00:02:48.769> not<00:02:48.890> hard<00:02:49.040> to<00:02:49.190> get<00:02:49.340> at

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
light switch so it's not hard to get at

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:51.370 
light switch so it's not hard to get at
and<00:02:50.180> then<00:02:50.269> on<00:02:50.390> this<00:02:50.480> one<00:02:50.690> I<00:02:50.720> put<00:02:50.930> a<00:02:50.959> carabiner

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
and then on this one I put a carabiner

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:52.930 
and then on this one I put a carabiner
on<00:02:51.500> it<00:02:51.769> so<00:02:51.920> it<00:02:51.980> hangs<00:02:52.160> upside<00:02:52.370> down<00:02:52.730> in<00:02:52.850> the

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
on it so it hangs upside down in the

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.550 
on it so it hangs upside down in the
tent<00:02:53.150> really<00:02:53.450> easily<00:02:53.750> from<00:02:54.019> the<00:02:54.170> from<00:02:54.470> the

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
tent really easily from the from the

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.740 
tent really easily from the from the
apex<00:02:54.950> ring<00:02:55.190> on<00:02:55.519> the<00:02:55.910> frame<00:02:56.209> in<00:02:56.450> the<00:02:56.540> tent<00:02:56.780> and

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
apex ring on the frame in the tent and

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.050 
apex ring on the frame in the tent and
what<00:02:59.750> you<00:02:59.840> want<00:03:00.050> to<00:03:00.170> do<00:03:00.350> is<00:03:00.830> go<00:03:01.040> ahead<00:03:01.130> take

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
what you want to do is go ahead take

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.690 
what you want to do is go ahead take
your<00:03:02.090> snips<00:03:03.050> couldn't<00:03:03.680> just<00:03:03.800> dent<00:03:04.130> the<00:03:04.400> shaft

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
your snips couldn't just dent the shaft

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.880 
your snips couldn't just dent the shaft
a<00:03:04.880> little<00:03:05.090> bit<00:03:05.180> in<00:03:05.269> two<00:03:05.450> places<00:03:05.720> and<00:03:06.530> this<00:03:06.650> will

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
a little bit in two places and this will

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.430 
a little bit in two places and this will
keep<00:03:07.069> a<00:03:07.190> nice<00:03:07.340> tension<00:03:07.880> on<00:03:08.269> this<00:03:08.870> ring<00:03:09.110> so<00:03:09.319> the

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
keep a nice tension on this ring so the

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.350 
keep a nice tension on this ring so the
thing<00:03:09.590> doesn't<00:03:09.860> fold<00:03:10.040> in<00:03:10.190> on<00:03:10.310> itself<00:03:10.360> it's

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
thing doesn't fold in on itself it's

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.670 
thing doesn't fold in on itself it's
kind<00:03:11.569> of<00:03:11.600> hard<00:03:11.780> to<00:03:11.810> see<00:03:12.050> but<00:03:12.230> what<00:03:12.350> I've<00:03:12.470> done

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
kind of hard to see but what I've done

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.280 
kind of hard to see but what I've done
is<00:03:12.920> I've<00:03:13.069> done<00:03:13.970> and<00:03:14.150> it<00:03:14.239> just<00:03:14.269> pressed<00:03:14.930> in<00:03:15.110> just

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
is I've done and it just pressed in just

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:16.390 
is I've done and it just pressed in just
a<00:03:15.380> little<00:03:15.410> bit<00:03:15.620> just<00:03:15.830> enough<00:03:15.980> to<00:03:16.220> make<00:03:16.370> it

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
a little bit just enough to make it

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.740 
a little bit just enough to make it
stick<00:03:16.640> and<00:03:17.060> that<00:03:17.959> works<00:03:18.170> really<00:03:18.320> well<00:03:19.750> there

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
stick and that works really well there

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:21.009 
stick and that works really well there
you<00:03:20.870> go
