with<00:01:26.860> a<00:01:26.890> lot<00:01:27.160> of<00:01:27.190> my<00:01:27.670> works<00:01:27.940> there's<00:01:28.300> so<00:01:28.539> much

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:28.690 
with a lot of my works there's so much

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.590 
with a lot of my works there's so much
going<00:01:29.020> on<00:01:29.320> that<00:01:29.710> it<00:01:30.580> kind<00:01:30.850> of<00:01:30.910> lends<00:01:31.179> itself

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
going on that it kind of lends itself

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.419 
going on that it kind of lends itself
into<00:01:32.050> these<00:01:32.200> different<00:01:32.440> narrative<00:01:33.070> stories

00:01:33.419 --> 00:01:33.429 
into these different narrative stories

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:35.550 
into these different narrative stories
that<00:01:33.580> are<00:01:33.670> happening<00:01:33.820> within<00:01:34.210> one<00:01:34.450> piece<00:01:34.720> so

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
that are happening within one piece so

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.880 
that are happening within one piece so
when<00:01:35.890> I<00:01:36.369> guess<00:01:37.000> we<00:01:37.929> decided<00:01:38.380> to<00:01:38.470> break<00:01:38.649> it<00:01:38.800> up

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
when I guess we decided to break it up

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.190 
when I guess we decided to break it up
into<00:01:39.070> the<00:01:39.250> four<00:01:39.460> boards<00:01:39.759> it<00:01:39.940> it<00:01:40.330> makes<00:01:40.600> senses
