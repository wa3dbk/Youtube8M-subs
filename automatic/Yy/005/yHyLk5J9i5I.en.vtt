freezing power I would probably make a

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.290 
freezing power I would probably make a
giant<00:01:00.870> ice<00:01:01.379> castle<00:01:02.129> fort<00:01:02.519> and<00:01:02.760> just<00:01:02.969> hang<00:01:03.180> out

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
relatively cool days so I would probably

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.270 
relatively cool days so I would probably
just<00:01:08.130> wear<00:01:08.429> an<00:01:09.240> ice<00:01:09.570> Sheen<00:01:10.080> at<00:01:10.740> all<00:01:10.979> times
