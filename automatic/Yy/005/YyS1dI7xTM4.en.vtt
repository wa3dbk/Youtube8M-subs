which<00:01:11.220> is<00:01:11.400> his<00:01:11.549> signature<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:12.210> you<00:01:12.840> can<00:01:12.960> also

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
which is his signature and you can also

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.469 
which is his signature and you can also
counter<00:01:13.530> punch<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:13.950> he<00:01:14.220> can<00:01:14.340> also<00:01:14.490> box<00:01:14.820> he<00:01:15.330> can

counter punch and he can also box he can
also<00:01:15.600> pressure<00:01:15.960> so<00:01:16.619> I<00:01:16.950> think<00:01:17.640> one<00:01:18.090> thing<00:01:18.119> that

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
also pressure so I think one thing that

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.350 
also pressure so I think one thing that
sticks<00:01:18.840> out<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.200> me<00:01:19.229> is<00:01:19.530> if<00:01:20.430> you<00:01:20.700> watch<00:01:20.939> vm

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
I had to break down to I think the bikes

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.219 
I had to break down to I think the bikes
can<00:02:03.570> go<00:02:03.689> i<00:02:03.750> think<00:02:03.899> i'm<00:02:03.960> going<00:02:04.049> to<00:02:04.140> see<00:02:04.200> that

tactical chess match for the first six

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.749 
tactical chess match for the first six
rounds<00:02:06.180> both<00:02:06.570> guys<00:02:06.780> feeling<00:02:07.229> each<00:02:07.320> other<00:02:07.500> out

rounds both guys feeling each other out

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:10.279 
rounds both guys feeling each other out
but<00:02:08.759> then<00:02:09.030> I<00:02:09.239> think<00:02:09.629> the<00:02:09.720> needles<00:02:09.989> vast

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289

experience<00:02:10.709> at<00:02:11.009> this<00:02:11.220> level<00:02:11.959> but<00:02:12.959> more

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319

so<00:02:13.469> its<00:02:14.129> diversity<00:02:14.879> in<00:02:15.090> his<00:02:15.239> arsenal<00:02:15.749> in<00:02:15.840> terms

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:16.049 
so its diversity in his arsenal in terms

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:17.989 
so its diversity in his arsenal in terms
of<00:02:16.170> what<00:02:16.349> he<00:02:16.469> can<00:02:16.650> do<00:02:16.829> different<00:02:17.310> ways<00:02:17.639> he<00:02:17.819> can

of what he can do different ways he can
beat<00:02:18.180> you<00:02:18.299> I<00:02:18.329> think<00:02:18.480> eventually<00:02:19.010> he'll<00:02:20.239> emerge

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
beat you I think eventually he'll emerge

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:24.289 
beat you I think eventually he'll emerge
and<00:02:21.530> we're<00:02:22.530> down<00:02:22.799> brigand<00:02:23.249> Oh<00:02:23.370> toward<00:02:24.120> a
