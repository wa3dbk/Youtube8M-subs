00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.480 

one<00:00:54.630> of<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.840> first<00:00:55.080> principles<00:00:55.320> we<00:00:56.070> need<00:00:56.280> to

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:56.490 
one of the first principles we need to

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.300 
one of the first principles we need to
understand<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.750> whole<00:00:57.930> golf<00:00:58.200> road<00:00:58.470> is<00:00:59.190> the

00:00:59.300 --> 00:00:59.310 
understand the whole golf road is the

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:01.430 
understand the whole golf road is the
effect<00:00:59.670> of<00:00:59.820> tire<00:01:00.240> pressures<00:01:00.690> on<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.140> terrain

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
effect of tire pressures on the terrain

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.410 
effect of tire pressures on the terrain
over<00:01:01.680> which<00:01:01.800> we<00:01:01.950> drive<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.490> the<00:01:02.940> vehicles

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
over which we drive and the vehicles

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.160 
over which we drive and the vehicles
performance<00:01:04.730> firstly<00:01:05.730> a<00:01:05.940> tire<00:01:06.450> is<00:01:06.750> very<00:01:06.930> very

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
performance firstly a tire is very very

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.220 
performance firstly a tire is very very
hard<00:01:07.500> will<00:01:08.010> tend<00:01:08.370> to<00:01:08.430> penetrate<00:01:09.150> through<00:01:09.990> a

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:10.230 
hard will tend to penetrate through a

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.250 
hard will tend to penetrate through a
tire<00:01:10.890> that<00:01:11.040> is<00:01:11.160> soft<00:01:11.490> will<00:01:11.790> tend<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.180> float<00:01:12.480> now

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
tire that is soft will tend to float now

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.440 
tire that is soft will tend to float now
for<00:01:13.890> sound<00:01:14.250> driving<00:01:14.640> such<00:01:14.820> as<00:01:14.940> this<00:01:15.060> morning

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
for sound driving such as this morning

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.270 
for sound driving such as this morning
the<00:01:15.600> sand<00:01:15.930> is<00:01:16.110> actually<00:01:16.440> quite<00:01:16.650> wet<00:01:16.920> so<00:01:17.160> it's

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
the sand is actually quite wet so it's

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.660 
the sand is actually quite wet so it's
got<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:17.550> lot<00:01:17.850> of<00:01:18.350> buoyancy<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.860> vehicle<00:01:20.310> even

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
got a lot of buoyancy the vehicle even

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.180 
got a lot of buoyancy the vehicle even
with<00:01:20.850> fairly<00:01:21.210> hard<00:01:21.450> tires<00:01:21.690> does<00:01:22.410> not<00:01:22.650> sink<00:01:22.950> in

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.190 
with fairly hard tires does not sink in

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.090 
with fairly hard tires does not sink in
but<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.790> moment<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.240> sand<00:01:24.540> gets<00:01:24.810> soft<00:01:25.229> a<00:01:25.530> hard

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
but the moment the sand gets soft a hard

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.310 
but the moment the sand gets soft a hard
tire<00:01:26.490> will<00:01:26.729> penetrate<00:01:27.150> through<00:01:27.720> making

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
tire will penetrate through making

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.290 
tire will penetrate through making
driving<00:01:28.740> difficult<00:01:28.920> so<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.910> first<00:01:30.150> question

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:30.300 
driving difficult so the first question

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.219 
driving difficult so the first question
is<00:01:30.690> what<00:01:31.290> surface<00:01:31.710> are<00:01:31.920> we<00:01:32.040> driving<00:01:32.280> over<00:01:32.790> and

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
is what surface are we driving over and

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:36.499 
is what surface are we driving over and
how<00:01:34.229> will<00:01:34.500> our<00:01:34.619> tires<00:01:35.160> penetrate<00:01:35.970> if<00:01:36.210> they're

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
how will our tires penetrate if they're

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.109 
how will our tires penetrate if they're
going<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.690> penetrate<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.200> lot<00:01:37.500> and<00:01:37.830> reduce<00:01:38.820> the

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
going to penetrate a lot and reduce the

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.850 
going to penetrate a lot and reduce the
power<00:01:39.300> pool<00:01:39.690> absorb<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.350> power<00:01:40.560> from<00:01:40.770> the

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
power pool absorb the power from the

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.260 
power pool absorb the power from the
vehicle<00:01:41.250> then<00:01:41.640> we're<00:01:41.790> going<00:01:41.910> to<00:01:41.940> need<00:01:42.090> to

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
vehicle then we're going to need to

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.480 
vehicle then we're going to need to
lower<00:01:42.509> our<00:01:42.780> tire<00:01:43.080> pressures<00:01:43.500> now<00:01:44.220> we're<00:01:44.400> gonna

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
lower our tire pressures now we're gonna

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.760 
lower our tire pressures now we're gonna
get<00:01:44.670> sand<00:01:44.910> driving<00:01:45.300> today<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:46.560> first

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
get sand driving today and the first

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.200 
get sand driving today and the first
thing<00:01:46.950> we're<00:01:47.040> going<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.190> do<00:01:47.369> is<00:01:47.580> look<00:01:48.000> at<00:01:48.119> the

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
thing we're going to do is look at the

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.940 
thing we're going to do is look at the
condition<00:01:48.570> of<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.750> sand<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.140> here<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.680> sand

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
condition of the sand and here the sand

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.219 
condition of the sand and here the sand
in<00:01:50.160> some<00:01:50.640> places<00:01:50.850> is<00:01:51.090> quite<00:01:51.300> compact<00:01:51.690> but

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
in some places is quite compact but

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.410 
in some places is quite compact but
where<00:01:52.470> it's<00:01:52.680> soft<00:01:52.950> we're<00:01:53.250> going<00:01:53.400> to<00:01:53.460> battle<00:01:53.640> so

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
where it's soft we're going to battle so

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.639 
where it's soft we're going to battle so
we're<00:01:54.539> going<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:54.720> drop<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:55.020> tyre<00:01:55.229> pressures

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
we're going to drop the tyre pressures

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.969 
we're going to drop the tyre pressures
our<00:01:55.979> first<00:01:56.580> port<00:01:56.850> of<00:01:56.910> call<00:01:56.970> is<00:01:57.390> one<00:01:57.840> bar<00:01:58.259> we<00:01:58.770> can

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
our first port of call is one bar we can

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.279 
our first port of call is one bar we can
go<00:01:59.130> lower<00:01:59.369> or<00:01:59.670> we<00:02:00.210> could<00:02:00.360> go<00:02:00.509> higher<00:02:00.720> but<00:02:01.140> it's

00:02:01.279 --> 00:02:01.289 
go lower or we could go higher but it's

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:03.350 
go lower or we could go higher but it's
a<00:02:01.380> good<00:02:01.619> starting<00:02:02.190> point<00:02:02.429> so<00:02:02.520> I<00:02:02.640> suggest<00:02:03.149> that

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
a good starting point so I suggest that

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.080 
a good starting point so I suggest that
one<00:02:03.899> bar<00:02:04.140> is<00:02:04.410> where<00:02:04.890> we<00:02:05.130> are<00:02:05.550> going<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:05.819> start

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
one bar is where we are going to start

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.419 
one bar is where we are going to start
today<00:02:06.210> so<00:02:06.990> to<00:02:07.289> do<00:02:07.410> that<00:02:07.440> we<00:02:07.920> need<00:02:08.069> a<00:02:08.220> tire

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
today so to do that we need a tire

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.490 
today so to do that we need a tire
pressure<00:02:08.580> gauge<00:02:08.729> okay<00:02:09.509> it's<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:09.960> first<00:02:09.990> thing

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
pressure gauge okay it's the first thing

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.860 
pressure gauge okay it's the first thing
you're<00:02:10.649> gonna<00:02:10.770> buy<00:02:11.009> at<00:02:11.490> any<00:02:11.640> off-road<00:02:12.180> 4x4

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
you're gonna buy at any off-road 4x4

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.330 
you're gonna buy at any off-road 4x4
shop<00:02:13.140> you<00:02:13.500> get<00:02:13.620> a<00:02:13.650> bar<00:02:13.800> tire<00:02:14.040> pressure<00:02:14.250> gauge

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
shop you get a bar tire pressure gauge

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:26.590 
shop you get a bar tire pressure gauge
it's<00:02:14.910> the<00:02:15.060> first<00:02:15.330> thing<00:02:15.540> you're<00:02:15.870> gonna<00:02:15.960> need

00:02:34.749 --> 00:02:38.830 

we<00:02:35.749> recommend<00:02:36.140> that<00:02:37.060> for<00:02:38.060> saying<00:02:38.359> driving

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
we recommend that for saying driving
