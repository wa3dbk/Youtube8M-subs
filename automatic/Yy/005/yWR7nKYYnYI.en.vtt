00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:06.100
 I saw a lot of media on the media 

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:08.020
 I, too, like incorrigible 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:10.180
 and think the million is pretty 

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:11.860
 gracious and funny in me easy 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:14.080
 incorrigible 2 it became in the 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.849
 credits he already touched and now have 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.130
 the little yellow beings after that 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:19.720
 aspire the most evil of the wicked 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.490
 to serve people of their own 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.140
 feature films get the main roles 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.529
 play the three lines stewart 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:28.510
 kevin and bob in the 1960's on the 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:30.640
 villain sake comes from the 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:33.039
 super villain in scarlet overkill and 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.899
 her husband and genius inventor tart 

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:37.030
 to be commissioned the crown of 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:39.129
 English queen to steal a must 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.899
 to let the film he is pretty 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:42.489
 well I was able to animate the 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:44.409
 visual aspect of the film barely 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:45.760
 Satisfied the varied 

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:47.440
 backgrounds we thanks 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.989
 changing settings have the 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.579
 lighting effects and the minions themselves are 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:53.289
 above the average everything sees 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:54.940
 Team is not good out of there 

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:56.499
 production company illumination 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.459
 entertainment impeccable work 

00:00:56.499 --> 00:00:59.229
 delivered 

00:00:57.459 --> 00:01:01.719
 the question is of course if the 

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:03.909
 directors pierre coffin and karl wada 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:05.740
 and the scriptwriter bryan lynch 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:08.680
 have delivered just as good and 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.780
 not exactly in advance 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.240
 I personally found it a bit exhausting 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.280
 over the 91 minutes runtime the 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.890
 Constantly meaningless babbling 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.600
 Wortfetzen like hello and begins to listen 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.840
 I just do not like that 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:25.360
 Great as an addition here 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.250
 Alone at the center were the minions 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.390
 and you babble a bit 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.980
 nerve-racking 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.720
 I do not know about the director 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:34.720
 pierre coffin must have been 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:38.070
 namely all 899 minions in this 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.070
 spoken movie occurrence 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:51.330
 In addition, the film is unfortunately a bit lame 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.040
 when i went to the cinema with the train 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.200
 drove home with stood behind 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.150
 Three of me, I guess ten years old 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.160
 who talked about the film 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.380
 and one has asked the others say 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.990
 you'll find that boring sometimes 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.220
 like me then I somehow thought so myself 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.470
 beautiful 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.420
 But why is that the film takes a lot 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.520
 but many applications never reach the 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.050
 emotional deep and honesty 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.850
 Train other animated film 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.810
 easy or ratatouille 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.760
 to reach 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.610
 I never really got emotional 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.800
 It feels a little bit involved 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.050
 human reference is missing that lies 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.920
 easy on the type of minions and also 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.540
 as they speak 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.730
 There are many scenes in which we are 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.709
 Charming can play in one place 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.360
 one of the migration of Eddie van halen 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.730
 I am at the job 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.560
 thrown away the entire beginning of the 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.660
 I also found the films very amusing and 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.590
 charming in minions is in fact for 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.320
 everyone something 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.959
 clear the minions and their silly 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.820
 and the slapstick for the kids and the 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.160
 allusions to the sixties 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:52.410
 somewhere for the parents too 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.269
 clever move in me easy 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.950
 incorrigible were the minions still 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:57.540
 the comic relief so you have the 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.430
 act the particular humorous 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.560
 potential was so that 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.690
 icing on the whole pie and 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.000
 must now alone in the whole missing 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.549
 wear and that works just unfortunately 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.230
 Not so perfect minions feel 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:13.680
 a little bit like one 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:16.140
 pretty cool so far only completely complete 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.670
 as a supper as a main course yet 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.680
 even if the film had a bit shorter 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.660
 he can deliver what you want 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.989
 he expects light entertainment 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:28.380
 Over 90 minutes the minions unsightly 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:30.480
 animation but not anymore 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.370
 it is not a revelation and due 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.519
 his little brand gets minions from 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.140
 still 7 out of 10 points if 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:38.820
 you are quite sure that this is you 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.130
 babble the media after 90 minutes 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.260
 Do not get on your nerves and you 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.930
 you will like the minions with the movie 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.150
 have your fun conclusion you get something 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.640
 The minions are as sweet as you expect 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.850
 always the animation will look out of the 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.530
 company a few grams 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.900
 the pants laugh convincing 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.690
 but dubbing drags something 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:01.180
 and the permanent babbling you have lust 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.280
 Thanks to even more film factory thanks 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.840
