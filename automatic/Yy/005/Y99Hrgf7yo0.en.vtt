00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.720
 a wall otherwise it does not matter and we are 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.580

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.460
 that we are in a bed and in a 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.720
 big house which is located a few 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.420
 kilometers 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.559
 from the North Sea I do not know 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.760

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.760
 kind of stone manor 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:44.149
 and this house is in a field 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:46.309
 well dark in a manor far enough 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:48.079
 with a big street with a tree well 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:49.520
 dark to access the leaves in 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:49.850
 being autumn are on the ground are at 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.079
 ground 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:55.550
 there are some who fall every time 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:58.040
 wind an avenue of plane trees that makes us 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.300
 well scared and deep down this little mansion 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.769
 in which we are in a room 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.829
 in a very large sion of the chamber of 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:05.680
 master and we are here because our 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:08.150
 parents authorities of this house 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.710
 lenÃ´tre have clicked dead and that we do not 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.510
 did not know 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.220
 and that our mother had lost sight of 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.360
 since she was young we do not know 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.320
 not really what was seven years that 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.760
 but in any case we are in his 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.530
 room today I sleep in bed 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.500
 you all sleep in his milk in a 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.860
 huge cold bed and invite viola 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.860
 who is scratching 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.970
 and in the middle of the night while 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.040
 you are cold 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.060
 and you are petrified with fear because 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.390
 it's still scared of them in a 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.390
 manor 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:43.930
 a huge thunderstorm is fired and not 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.930
 only the storm goes off 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.590
 then you tell yourself I'm going out 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.850
 to see where are my parents and the 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.920
 problem is that your parents are 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.810
 call and no longer answer you in the 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.409
 big hallway that has in this house 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.409
 scary 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.950
 you try the market to get into 

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:02.950
 a piece 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.840
 enter a room and you come across 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.800
 our rice rowers with plenty of weapons 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.030
 knives small scalpels 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.879
 you still will not have our real ones 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.349
 especially not the eyes because maybe 

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:18.400
 it's dead uncle is in front of you 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:19.840
 looking at you just a 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.860
 centimeter of your face in face to 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.860
 one centimeter of your face 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:34.829
 I may even feel 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:34.829
 his breath 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.880
 and suddenly you decided to go out of 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.880
 this armor and you shut the door 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.940
 a little door that squeaks from elsewhere 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:51.080
 and you decided to continue in this 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.080
 big hallway like this 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.940
 and there you come across animals on the wall 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:57.349
 hunting trophies 1 probably 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:00.290
 but trophies with heads of 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:03.200
 dogs heads of fish heads 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.280
 of crocodiles of elephant heads and 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.569
 you enter another room with 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.860
 flasks of formalin and there are plenty of 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:11.209
 little infant inside who 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:12.470
 floats in flasks of formaldehyde and there 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.610
 you started to panic you say more 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.200
 later I hear things creak that 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.280
 what it is is a little weird you 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.400
 hear weird noises behind 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.400
 you 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.860
 you ask what it is if you are 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.910
 all by yourself, attention is 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.060
 maybe at home that's going on 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.060
 anyway 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.940
 but be careful should not be 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.940
 the eyes 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:42.870
 douvres and especially not the eyes he can 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.909
 to be behind you in any case you 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:48.110
 decided to enter the third 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:48.110
 room and that there is in this great mansion 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:54.700
 and there you come back running since 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.440

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.400

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.160
 one-handed quilt 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:11.570
 you arrive at your mother's head 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:18.390
 you catch the quilt and there at once 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.590
 you remove it alas no it is not 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.579
 your parents finally it's just 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.450
 cushions that come out in theaters and so 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:22.560
 it's not the right room 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.700
 unfortunately no you go back in 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.990
 course and you continue in this mansion 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.730

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:49.160

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:51.700

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.700
 noise that makes 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:57.110
