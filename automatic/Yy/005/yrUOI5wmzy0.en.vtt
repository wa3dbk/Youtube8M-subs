00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
here is the Nokia 808 PureView now this

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.680 
here is the Nokia 808 PureView now this
one<00:00:09.840> is<00:00:09.990> very<00:00:10.080> very<00:00:10.530> unique<00:00:10.740> in<00:00:11.370> terms<00:00:11.700> that<00:00:12.000> it

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
one is very very unique in terms that it

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.000 
one is very very unique in terms that it
has<00:00:12.990> a<00:00:13.320> 41<00:00:13.799> megapixel<00:00:14.059> camera<00:00:15.059> and<00:00:16.010> you're

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
has a 41 megapixel camera and you're

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.590 
has a 41 megapixel camera and you're
probably<00:00:17.100> asking<00:00:17.340> how<00:00:17.730> is<00:00:17.880> that<00:00:18.000> possible<00:00:18.420> and

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
probably asking how is that possible and

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.269 
probably asking how is that possible and
that's<00:00:18.750> what<00:00:18.869> we're<00:00:18.990> asking<00:00:19.140> re<00:00:19.500> today<00:00:19.830> so<00:00:20.250> I

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
that's what we're asking re today so I

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.220 
that's what we're asking re today so I
reckon<00:00:21.029> you<00:00:21.119> show<00:00:21.660> us<00:00:21.779> a<00:00:21.840> little<00:00:21.930> bit<00:00:22.050> more

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
reckon you show us a little bit more

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.830 
reckon you show us a little bit more
about<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:23.070> user<00:00:23.820> interface<00:00:24.060> on<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.510> camera

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
about the user interface on the camera

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.810 
about the user interface on the camera
and<00:00:25.050> tells<00:00:25.890> more<00:00:26.070> about<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.430> imaging

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
and tells more about the imaging

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.830 
and tells more about the imaging
technology<00:00:27.390> sure<00:00:28.289> thing<00:00:28.859> so<00:00:29.510> as<00:00:30.510> you<00:00:30.660> already

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
technology sure thing so as you already

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.330 
technology sure thing so as you already
mentioned<00:00:31.040> we<00:00:32.040> are<00:00:32.070> using<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:33.239> biggest<00:00:33.660> ever

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
mentioned we are using the biggest ever

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.790 
mentioned we are using the biggest ever
imaging<00:00:35.340> sensor<00:00:35.730> in<00:00:35.880> mobile<00:00:36.690> phone<00:00:36.989> I<00:00:37.290> haven't

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
imaging sensor in mobile phone I haven't

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.130 
imaging sensor in mobile phone I haven't
even<00:00:37.950> seen<00:00:38.250> dscs<00:00:38.820> with<00:00:39.030> this<00:00:39.180> type<00:00:39.420> of<00:00:39.450> sensors

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
even seen dscs with this type of sensors

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.030 
even seen dscs with this type of sensors
it's<00:00:40.980> one<00:00:41.219> over<00:00:41.460> 1.2<00:00:42.239> inch<00:00:42.480> sensor<00:00:42.860> as<00:00:43.860> you

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
it's one over 1.2 inch sensor as you

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.290 
it's one over 1.2 inch sensor as you
said<00:00:44.250> using<00:00:44.850> 41<00:00:45.510> megapixels<00:00:46.969> but<00:00:47.969> that's<00:00:48.180> not

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
said using 41 megapixels but that's not

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.100 
said using 41 megapixels but that's not
all<00:00:48.989> what<00:00:49.920> it<00:00:50.039> really<00:00:50.219> is<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:51.090> I<00:00:51.449> think<00:00:51.539> really

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
all what it really is and I think really

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.750 
all what it really is and I think really
the<00:00:52.579> key<00:00:53.660> ingredient<00:00:54.660> in<00:00:54.899> this<00:00:55.230> device<00:00:55.860> is

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
the key ingredient in this device is

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.930 
the key ingredient in this device is
what<00:00:56.969> we<00:00:57.120> call<00:00:57.360> PureView<00:00:57.899> technology<00:00:58.789> this<00:00:59.789> is

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
what we call PureView technology this is

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.599 
what we call PureView technology this is
the<00:01:00.120> image<00:01:00.530> that's<00:01:01.530> my<00:01:01.739> by<00:01:01.920> far<00:01:02.160> my<00:01:02.340> favorite

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
the image that's my by far my favorite

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.969 
the image that's my by far my favorite
image<00:01:03.090> we<00:01:03.600> have<00:01:03.629> been<00:01:03.960> capturing<00:01:04.320> this<00:01:04.619> last

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
image we have been capturing this last

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.039 
image we have been capturing this last
week<00:01:05.220> all<00:01:05.369> around<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.700> world<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.630> this<00:01:06.810> one

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
week all around the world and this one

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.500 
week all around the world and this one
we<00:01:07.200> captured<00:01:07.710> in<00:01:07.950> Rio<00:01:08.250> de<00:01:08.430> Janeiro<00:01:08.820> doing<00:01:09.420> the

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
we captured in Rio de Janeiro doing the

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.450 
we captured in Rio de Janeiro doing the
carnival's<00:01:10.130> midnight<00:01:11.210> ice<00:01:12.210> dancing<00:01:13.460> rodolfo

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
carnival's midnight ice dancing rodolfo

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.460 
carnival's midnight ice dancing rodolfo
midnight<00:01:14.850> this<00:01:15.479> is<00:01:15.600> during<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.020> midnight<00:01:16.200> I

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
midnight this is during the midnight I

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.469 
midnight this is during the midnight I
would<00:01:16.830> say<00:01:17.009> it<00:01:17.280> was<00:01:17.430> roughly<00:01:17.909> one<00:01:18.150> o'clock

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
would say it was roughly one o'clock

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.380 
would say it was roughly one o'clock
when<00:01:19.080> I<00:01:19.110> saw<00:01:19.619> it<00:01:19.650> kind<00:01:20.070> of<00:01:20.130> limits<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:21.180> that

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
when I saw it kind of limits and that

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.170 
when I saw it kind of limits and that
you<00:01:21.570> need<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.930> details<00:01:22.200> you<00:01:22.650> are<00:01:22.770> getting

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
you need the details you are getting

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.480 
you need the details you are getting
and<00:01:24.480> the<00:01:24.690> technology<00:01:24.990> why<00:01:25.350> we<00:01:25.530> are<00:01:25.680> able<00:01:26.040> to<00:01:26.370> do

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
and the technology why we are able to do

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.270 
and the technology why we are able to do
this<00:01:26.700> is<00:01:27.360> that<00:01:27.720> is<00:01:28.290> what<00:01:28.530> we<00:01:28.620> called<00:01:28.860> PureView

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
this is that is what we called PureView

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.500 
this is that is what we called PureView
technology<00:01:29.390> so<00:01:30.390> we<00:01:30.420> capture<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.470> full

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:32.510 
technology so we capture the full

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.320 
technology so we capture the full
41-megapixel<00:01:33.510> minutes<00:01:34.230> then<00:01:35.220> use<00:01:35.550> nokia

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 
41-megapixel minutes then use nokia

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.810 
41-megapixel minutes then use nokia
intelligent<00:01:37.080> algorithms<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:38.280> scale<00:01:38.580> that

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
intelligent algorithms to scale that

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.750 
intelligent algorithms to scale that
into<00:01:39.270> perfect<00:01:40.020> five<00:01:40.229> megapixel<00:01:40.830> image<00:01:41.070> which

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:41.760 
into perfect five megapixel image which

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.350 
into perfect five megapixel image which
effectively<00:01:42.660> gives<00:01:43.080> you<00:01:43.430> and<00:01:44.430> well<00:01:44.790> it<00:01:45.150> gives

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
effectively gives you and well it gives

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.230 
effectively gives you and well it gives
you<00:01:45.660> an<00:01:45.869> never<00:01:46.500> see<00:01:46.770> ever<00:01:47.010> see<00:01:47.520> low-light

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
you an never see ever see low-light

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.660 
you an never see ever see low-light
performance<00:01:48.440> with<00:01:49.440> honesty<00:01:49.890> in<00:01:49.950> clarity<00:01:50.490> and

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
performance with honesty in clarity and

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.890 
performance with honesty in clarity and
practically<00:01:51.479> noise<00:01:51.660> free<00:01:52.020> flow<00:01:52.440> like<00:01:52.680> in<00:01:52.830> it

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:53.900 
practically noise free flow like in it

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.469 
practically noise free flow like in it
naturally<00:01:54.900> the<00:01:55.020> same<00:01:55.200> same<00:01:55.830> benefits<00:01:56.759> we<00:01:57.270> get

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
naturally the same same benefits we get

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.080 
naturally the same same benefits we get
also<00:01:57.960> from<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.200> daylight<00:01:58.680> images<00:01:59.190> are<00:01:59.970> we

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
also from the daylight images are we

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.200 
also from the daylight images are we
take<00:02:00.270> our<00:02:00.450> painting<00:02:00.810> here<00:02:01.580> then<00:02:02.580> so<00:02:02.850> you<00:02:02.910> want

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
take our painting here then so you want

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.460 
take our painting here then so you want
one<00:02:03.600> example<00:02:05.060> example<00:02:06.060> here<00:02:06.540> so<00:02:07.080> that's<00:02:07.350> a

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
one example example here so that's a

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.699 
one example example here so that's a
daylight<00:02:07.890> in<00:02:08.130> it

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.300 

Julian<00:02:11.709> so<00:02:12.250> because<00:02:12.940> we<00:02:13.090> use<00:02:13.390> such<00:02:13.959> a<00:02:13.989> high

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
Julian so because we use such a high

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.130 
Julian so because we use such a high
original<00:02:15.310> number<00:02:15.610> of<00:02:15.700> megapixels<00:02:16.019> we<00:02:17.019> are

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
original number of megapixels we are

really<00:02:33.310> proud<00:02:33.520> of<00:02:33.660> this<00:02:34.660> is<00:02:34.810> a<00:02:34.840> full

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
really proud of this is a full

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.740 
really proud of this is a full
resolution<00:02:35.290> image<00:02:35.950> let's<00:02:36.760> see<00:02:37.030> when<00:02:37.599> I<00:02:37.690> do

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
resolution image let's see when I do

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.250 
resolution image let's see when I do
that<00:02:37.989> that's<00:02:38.770> quite<00:02:38.950> aggressive<00:02:39.550> already

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
that that's quite aggressive already

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.780 
that that's quite aggressive already
when<00:02:41.260> I<00:02:41.349> do<00:02:41.410> that<00:02:41.680> that's<00:02:42.550> really

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
when I do that that's really

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:50.009 
when I do that that's really
mind-blowing<00:02:43.269> because<00:02:44.519> you<00:02:45.900> everything<00:02:49.019> so

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
mind-blowing because you everything so

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:52.440 
mind-blowing because you everything so
now<00:02:50.290> what<00:02:51.280> you're<00:02:51.400> doing<00:02:51.459> really<00:02:51.790> is<00:02:51.970> you're

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
now what you're doing really is you're

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.250 
now what you're doing really is you're
taking<00:02:52.830> several<00:02:53.830> pixels<00:02:54.280> and<00:02:55.260> interpolating

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
taking several pixels and interpolating

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.259 
taking several pixels and interpolating
that<00:02:56.470> is<00:02:56.739> that<00:02:56.890> correct<00:02:57.069> yes<00:02:57.580> you<00:02:57.880> could<00:02:58.060> you

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
that is that correct yes you could you

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:00.420 
that is that correct yes you could you
could<00:02:58.420> say<00:02:58.660> say<00:02:59.260> that<00:02:59.470> that<00:02:59.650> be<00:02:59.860> doing<00:03:00.190> so

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
could say say that that be doing so

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.910 
could say say that that be doing so
effectively<00:03:01.000> this<00:03:01.840> is<00:03:02.019> what<00:03:02.140> we<00:03:02.260> call<00:03:02.470> over

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
effectively this is what we call over

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.729 
effectively this is what we call over
sampling<00:03:03.280> technology<00:03:04.030> so<00:03:04.810> we<00:03:04.840> use<00:03:05.140> 41

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
sampling technology so we use 41

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:08.789 
sampling technology so we use 41
megapixels<00:03:06.519> all<00:03:07.180> the<00:03:07.390> sample<00:03:07.840> the<00:03:08.049> scene<00:03:08.410> that

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:08.799 
megapixels all the sample the scene that

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:12.000 
megapixels all the sample the scene that
the<00:03:08.950> cameras<00:03:09.430> is<00:03:09.819> seeing<00:03:10.150> and<00:03:10.870> then<00:03:11.080> we<00:03:11.290> if<00:03:11.830> we

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
the cameras is seeing and then we if we

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.539 
the cameras is seeing and then we if we
so<00:03:12.190> choose<00:03:12.510> we<00:03:13.510> can<00:03:13.750> downscale<00:03:14.500> that<00:03:14.799> to<00:03:15.340> 5

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549 
so choose we can downscale that to 5

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:18.720 
so choose we can downscale that to 5

run for interview mode we find the

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:33.210 
run for interview mode we find the
capital<00:03:31.060> images<00:03:31.510> so<00:03:32.410> now<00:03:32.560> when<00:03:32.739> I<00:03:32.829> capture

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
capital images so now when I capture

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.330 
capital images so now when I capture
