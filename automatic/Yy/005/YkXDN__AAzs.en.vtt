caliper off so we're gonna have to push

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:15.980 
caliper off so we're gonna have to push
the<00:00:14.670> piston<00:00:14.880> back<00:00:15.240> in<00:00:15.420> because<00:00:15.570> look<00:00:15.750> how<00:00:15.870> it

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
the piston back in because look how it

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.279 
the piston back in because look how it
extended<00:00:16.470> because<00:00:16.710> that<00:00:16.949> chair<00:00:17.250> was<00:00:17.369> born<00:00:17.640> out

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:18.289

extended because that chair was born out
we<00:00:19.289> have<00:00:19.380> a<00:00:19.439> new<00:00:19.470> rotor<00:00:19.830> already<00:00:20.250> new<00:00:20.670> brake

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
we have a new rotor already new brake

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.769 
we have a new rotor already new brake
pads<00:00:21.210> already<00:00:21.539> put<00:00:21.750> in<00:00:21.900> ah<00:00:22.850> and<00:00:23.850> then<00:00:24.539> you<00:00:24.689> know

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
Patrick is learning how to replace great

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.799 
Patrick is learning how to replace great
bits<00:00:40.379> and<00:00:40.559> rotors<00:00:40.890> on<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.129> truck<00:00:41.399> right

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
bits and rotors on the truck right

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:50.380 
bits and rotors on the truck right
mm-hmm

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.150 

so<00:00:51.649> this<00:00:52.649> is<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:52.829> new<00:00:53.070> rotor<00:00:53.370> for<00:00:54.300> this<00:00:54.539> truck

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
so this is a new rotor for this truck

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.650 
so this is a new rotor for this truck
compare<00:00:56.160> it<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.550> one<00:00:56.699> that<00:00:56.910> we<00:00:57.030> had<00:00:57.270> how

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
compare it to the one that we had how

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.979 
compare it to the one that we had how
worn<00:00:57.960> out<00:00:58.170> it<00:00:58.379> is<00:00:58.500> look<00:00:58.859> at<00:00:58.980> this<00:00:59.129> this<00:00:59.809> is<00:01:00.809> what

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
worn out it is look at this this is what

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
it used to be on this no wonder it's

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.740 
it used to be on this no wonder it's
rusty<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.379> not<00:01:05.250> very<00:01:05.549> soft<00:01:05.970> it's<00:01:06.240> completely

rusty and not very soft it's completely
worn<00:01:06.960> out<00:01:07.340> so<00:01:08.340> this<00:01:08.610> is<00:01:08.729> our<00:01:08.909> new<00:01:09.150> one<00:01:10.430> but<00:01:11.430> uh

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
check out the brake bed all right it's

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.929 
check out the brake bed all right it's
so<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:16.080> brake<00:01:16.350> pad<00:01:16.650> this<00:01:16.890> is<00:01:17.100> this<00:01:17.460> is<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.790> new

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
so the brake pad this is this is the new

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.310 
so the brake pad this is this is the new
one<00:01:18.119> that's<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.810> new<00:01:18.930> one

one that's the new one

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.649 
one that's the new one
worn<00:01:19.860> out<00:01:20.040> here<00:01:20.340> look<00:01:20.670> at<00:01:20.820> this<00:01:21.000> look<00:01:21.420> at<00:01:21.509> the

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
worn out here look at this look at the

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.999 
worn out here look at this look at the
thickness<00:01:22.729> that's<00:01:23.729> sick<00:01:24.350> and<00:01:25.350> I<00:01:25.470> was<00:01:25.619> driving

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
thickness that's sick and I was driving

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.480 
thickness that's sick and I was driving
with<00:01:26.159> this<00:01:26.340> that's<00:01:26.820> dangerous

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
with this that's dangerous

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:35.929 
with this that's dangerous
so<00:01:31.369> yeah<00:01:32.369> so<00:01:32.729> we<00:01:33.090> got<00:01:33.270> this<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:33.840> then<00:01:34.939> I'm

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
so yeah so we got this and then I'm

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.700 
so yeah so we got this and then I'm
going<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.150> open<00:01:36.360> up<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.780> master<00:01:37.110> cylinder<00:01:37.290> now

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
going to open up the master cylinder now

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.859 
going to open up the master cylinder now
the<00:01:38.280> brake<00:01:38.490> fluid<00:01:38.790> is<00:01:38.880> pretty<00:01:39.150> low<00:01:39.329> we<00:01:39.509> can<00:01:39.630> see

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
the brake fluid is pretty low we can see

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.120 
the brake fluid is pretty low we can see
it's<00:01:39.990> not<00:01:40.140> man<00:01:40.320> but<00:01:40.350> it's<00:01:40.680> about<00:01:40.860> halfway

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
it's not man but it's about halfway

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.580 
it's not man but it's about halfway
through<00:01:41.570> so<00:01:42.570> we<00:01:42.659> got<00:01:42.840> room<00:01:43.049> because<00:01:43.409> when<00:01:43.560> I

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
through so we got room because when I

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.700 
through so we got room because when I
click<00:01:43.860> when<00:01:44.100> I'll<00:01:44.220> push<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.610> cylinder<00:01:45.030> here

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
click when I'll push the cylinder here

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.170 
click when I'll push the cylinder here
the<00:01:46.710> master<00:01:47.040> cylinder<00:01:47.250> it'll<00:01:47.700> get<00:01:47.850> compressed

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
the master cylinder it'll get compressed

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.350 
the master cylinder it'll get compressed
all<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.659> way<00:01:49.430> because<00:01:50.430> right<00:01:50.610> now<00:01:50.759> it's<00:01:51.000> it's

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
all the way because right now it's it's

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.420 
all the way because right now it's it's
out<00:01:51.570> so<00:01:51.810> far<00:01:52.049> that<00:01:52.290> I<00:01:52.320> can't<00:01:52.619> even<00:01:52.710> put<00:01:53.159> it<00:01:53.280> back

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
out so far that I can't even put it back

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.149 
out so far that I can't even put it back
on<00:01:53.610> get<00:01:54.000> put<00:01:54.210> in<00:01:54.299> put<00:01:54.450> caliper<00:01:54.840> on<00:01:54.960> it<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.320> then

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
on get put in put caliper on it and then

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.080 
on get put in put caliper on it and then
the<00:01:56.610> fluid<00:01:56.790> will<00:01:57.030> go<00:01:57.060> back<00:01:57.360> up<00:01:57.799> so<00:01:58.969> I'm<00:01:59.969> gonna

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
the fluid will go back up so I'm gonna

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.160 
the fluid will go back up so I'm gonna
have<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.329> open<00:02:00.420> that<00:02:00.659> I'll<00:02:00.780> do<00:02:00.869> that<00:02:01.020> in<00:02:01.110> a

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
have to open that I'll do that in a

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.190 
have to open that I'll do that in a
second<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:02.060> then<00:02:03.060> after<00:02:03.360> that<00:02:03.570> Patrick

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
second and then after that Patrick

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.649 
second and then after that Patrick

I still get time to learn anyway so yeah
it's<00:02:17.510> going<00:02:17.720> through<00:02:17.960> fast<00:02:18.230> so<00:02:18.590> I<00:02:18.860> gotta<00:02:19.220> i<00:02:19.610> got

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
it's going through fast so I gotta i got

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.250 
it's going through fast so I gotta i got
entire<00:02:20.750> front<00:02:21.110> up<00:02:21.290> already<00:02:22.360> both<00:02:23.360> wheels<00:02:23.630> so

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
entire front up already both wheels so

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.660 
entire front up already both wheels so
this<00:02:24.470> one<00:02:24.620> hasn't<00:02:24.770> been<00:02:24.890> replaced<00:02:25.190> it<00:02:25.430> I<00:02:25.520> mean

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
this one hasn't been replaced it I mean

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.840 
this one hasn't been replaced it I mean
you<00:02:25.760> can<00:02:25.820> see<00:02:26.030> that<00:02:26.060> this<00:02:27.250> this<00:02:28.250> rotor<00:02:28.550> is<00:02:28.730> in

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
you can see that this this rotor is in

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.060 
you can see that this this rotor is in
much<00:02:29.030> better<00:02:29.060> shape<00:02:29.390> than<00:02:29.930> the<00:02:30.470> the<00:02:30.800> other<00:02:30.950> one

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
much better shape than the the other one

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:32.320 
much better shape than the the other one
but<00:02:31.220> I'm<00:02:31.340> replacing<00:02:31.850> all<00:02:31.940> of<00:02:32.060> them<00:02:32.180> because

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
you can see all the rust here on this

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.180
