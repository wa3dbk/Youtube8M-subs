00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:06.250
 hello my name is janet welcome to 

00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:08.320
 Mexican cuisine jauja today 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:12.460
 let's make some jalapeÃ±o peppers in 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:16.950
 pickled are great for cakes 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.950
 they list the ingredients right away 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.960
 we have pure fresh ingredients here 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.960
 what I did with the carrots the cut 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.600
 in the form of almonds and we're going to pass them 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.060
 to fry first because these are the ones that 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.880
 more slow to cook we go to the 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:44.879
 fire here I have a combination of 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.739
 canola oil and olive oil that 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.820
 already pre hot and we're going to start 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.820
 fry the carrots 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:58.460
 we add the onions and we continue 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:01:00.680
 now I'm going to incorporate the garlic but 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.620
 I want to show them I give birth to the garlic 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.509
 halfway because I love after 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.540
 when they are cooked, eat the 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:11.799
 with a fork are now delicious the 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.799
 let's take the short ones 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.399
 now the chilies 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.440
 we move it 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.820
 and now I 'm going to put some mushrooms 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.970
 I like mushrooms more than 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:30.640
 the cauliflower you decide on your recipe 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:33.810
 or you can put both 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.810
 and move it constantly 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:42.080
 serving here I'm going to take salt now 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:44.300
 dissolve the salt in the hot water 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.400
 I put the vinegar 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:49.110
 and we have already 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:52.940
 on top of the peppers 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.940
 let's go down the fire 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:02:00.970
 and let's put the herbs I have a 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:05.880
 bouquet of herbs of smell is thyme 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.880
 marjoram and laurel we will accommodate 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:16.220
 I have a little bit of oregano a bit 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.220
 we are going to undo it 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:22.280
 we will also put it 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:25.720
 I'm going to mark these fat peppers and 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.720
 I will also throw them in there 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.730
 after 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.640
 we're going to leave it to the short man and what 

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:38.030
 let's cover a few minutes so that 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:40.909
 vegetables do not cost anything else but 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.700
 also seasoned in already passed 10 

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:47.599
 minutes that I'm with the lid 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.969
 already they are soft 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:52.280
 carrots what we're going to know is that 

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:54.590
 we're going to take it out of the fire and we're going 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:58.260
 to try salt if you need him 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:00.330
 we put a little bit more and they are ready 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.269
 I already took it from the fire, I'm going to 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:06.239
 let cool and not just that I'm going to 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:08.730
 leave from here to tomorrow because I need 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:11.040
 that the taste of vinegar and chilies 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:14.640
 get into all the other vegetables 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:17.900
 but while what I want to prove is if 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:20.579
 the carrot has enough salt 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:24.019
 because if we are not still on time 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:24.019
 to put more salt 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.740
 no longer does he need more salt 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.760
 wicker coast richer than what is 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.129
 buy in can I invite you to do 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.260
