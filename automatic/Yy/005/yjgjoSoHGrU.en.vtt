00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.639
 to say for the study 

00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:05.019
 on the title that condemn very much but I still enjoy March 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:08.490
 Southern Comfort smart whole 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:09.359
 look at 

00:00:09.359 --> 00:00:12.359
 Jacquet Erlangens caught fire 

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:14.569
 was the same 

00:00:14.569 --> 00:00:15.669
 starboxx 

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:17.759
 it is such a thing 

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:21.239
 Harders but otherwise is in the turn or sale of the game or 

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:23.189
 and the war already yes 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.789
 Allied Workers Hall is pretty fancy 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:27.819
 to the game itself 

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:29.749
 Slip 1 2 

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:30.820
 is 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.540
 Great 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.650
 a fantastic round 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:36.690
 tactics 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.540
 and strategy game 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.830
 again with parades 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.820
 Year and game elements says Baumann could stop 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.820
 At the beginning Käßmann is like and say it like this 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.770
 He said that one is the one who only holds a troop to the one 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.770
 Spielstätten has his Zeltner troop together you have to hire one yourself 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:56.270
 she must then 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.280
 nice war zone and Prague were always within those areas 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.350
 and what they do in the fighting year so again 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:07.119
 like these 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:10.409
 Like Pierre Bayle, you can do it the way you normally do 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.030
 Real time 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.670
 walk across the fields but if that was an enemy emerged 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.530
 then the game freezes a fountain mode and you have to stop it like that 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.550
 he and then showed his unit Tessin year so you have certain moving 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:24.960
 Point available 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.110
 always in this one 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.860
 Percent tactic mode Sackmann Sinmun mode 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.000
 and then have to try or stop 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.290
 Spear are possible to write shopping that it is very difficult to explain 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.380
 so scary disagreement is so much fun she sees Pam for 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.800
 this very demanding 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.720
 Dr the cool one 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:45.960
 have the rare 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.360
 in this case, total peculiarities begin in principle, so some are rare 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.360
 that can be played with others then just can not work together 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.549
 that sometimes you are totally insulting if parts distribute so your own scort 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:01:58.570
 or 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.570
 and what kind of sayings out there so it really is 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.319
 just below 

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:05.760
 9 too expensive 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.399
 Super good, why strategy game 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.410
 again one of the best strategy games 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.830
 Vettel 1 2 that they make it to the border wall non-violent 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:18.209
 in principle yes tt-line two hardcourt it is exactly the same game 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:20.519
 or usual change 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:21.459
 only it is 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.589
 for them harder to get Esteban Palmer's parents on the basis of 

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:27.499
 and is DIB in this game 

00:02:27.499 --> 00:02:30.019
 the so-called elite mercenaries 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:31.980
 against which you can fight and you are 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.249
 really Hamma heavy so um 

00:02:35.249 --> 00:02:37.739
 because you can save right 0 in the place 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:40.539
 Train made okay i survived save again 

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:43.309
 trouble-free again is really stupid 

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:44.969
 incredibly heavy though 

00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:47.199
 Sept is a lot of fun to play 

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:50.199
 Super cool 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:53.829
 that was how it was now 

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:59.089
 yes then but that concludes the young player now constantly 2 in things on it 

00:02:59.089 --> 00:03:00.919
 the proponents 

00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:04.340
 which I have not tried yet and aesthetically lost 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:05.709
 a concrete one 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.169
 I've played that around before 

00:03:09.169 --> 00:03:11.290
 is in principle also such a Brych 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.089
 the rollplay 

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:14.799
 and we have on 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:18.159
 This must also be foresight isometric view playing time will be similar to though 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:21.329
 "Diablo" so this view is the attempt from diagonally above 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:22.999
 This is a bit of a concern 

00:03:22.999 --> 00:03:27.119
 but not yet as he went more role-playing than now the arguments 

00:03:27.119 --> 00:03:28.759
 not just samples 

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:30.009
 I say 

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:31.819
 one familiarly kicks 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:35.599
 So you have a few years to fulfill your orders 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:40.379
 I'll send you quests to the artisan Meier also motivating 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:41.479
 Handle 

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:46.019
 the "We look pretty good I have to say that Aachen BEV is scary 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:46.709
 the kadir t 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.709
 Viersen second game 

00:03:50.749 --> 00:03:52.409
 is difficult 

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:53.360
 it's a bit 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.630
 its stubborn you have to say partly are 10 for the food but not 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:57.389
 because 

00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:00.069
 first and what is a bit allowed 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:03.269
 Mr. Buck bad is not the wrong word though 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:06.269
 it is so 

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:09.059
 uncomfortable yes 

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:10.279
 when docking 

00:04:10.279 --> 00:04:12.959
 so little stepped in Vienna so there is 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:17.539
 that is in the budget of Diablo is huge in the SC Ebertshausen here has MA 

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:18.599
 take two things 

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:21.599
 Under load students need to sell the city and get more back 

00:04:22.819 --> 00:04:26.169
 Brock that's it's a bit stressful with time 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:27.820
 but still fun 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.860
 Pessimists in the game 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.800
 The thought comes from this exclamation towering over each and every one of them 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.800
 but Bissendorf played 

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:40.550
 So that does not say in a doping case 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:41.740
 because I still say that 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.240
 but I have the Czech Republic 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.540
 I have not played a percentage with Venture yet, but I can not do much 

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:50.020
 I'm supposed to be fine 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.180
 I from the ORF that will be already last years 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:56.250
 I heard so from my sister that it is just and total Materne 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.020
 Parking should be 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.240
 to get along without or at Materna 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.039
 Yes but 

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:04.039
 should that be good 

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:07.150
 then here is the father 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.650
 bought the same percentages somebody wanted to give and wanted 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:13.319
 I have not played yet 

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:17.220
 The Pollen GTA is said to be a bit of a hit 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:20.830
 Red Popal 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:23.830
 by that I did not say create space for miniature golf 

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:27.330
 either way we still dead 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:31.100
 this is also a game which is more Awe Dissen heading Wersen 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:32.659
 just on the boat 

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:35.659
 and with a lot of wind and around 

00:05:36.309 --> 00:05:39.659
 Yes 

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:43.379
 that's not saying it's actually years as well as quiet ones 

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:45.819
 maybe not so good 

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:48.759
 Pohlig say is not too fat - India 

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:52.729
 so easy of a staging care by additionally good maybe times say so 

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:56.629
 As a big lake is big the graphics are also pretty good of the game 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:00.770
 Percent the work should be said 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:04.080
 whoever is the popular imitation of the goat on it can have the word there 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.789
 Weather plays 

00:06:06.789 --> 00:06:09.400
 but then here with the tasting 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.720
 Mystery is that's three parenting forms from the rules that the 

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:13.779
 universe 

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:15.680
 and around 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:19.740
 that's what sister Mary baptizes that is in England mingles a previously occurs 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:22.740
 trust 

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:28.400
 so far only once there was the subgroup I played intensively times and before that 

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.319
 Motto Morent Express 

00:06:30.319 --> 00:06:33.349
 "Yes the things are it's drawing venture for people who are 

00:06:36.659 --> 00:06:39.509
 cancel jakob-park Gottfried Hohmann 

00:06:39.509 --> 00:06:42.509
 that's just very out of the server 

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:47.150
 the clinical I say so much 

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:53.750
 They are very high up the feverish Fechner sees these characters like them 

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:54.849
 talk to each other 

00:06:54.849 --> 00:06:57.479
 then, Schweiger said 

00:06:57.479 --> 00:06:59.840
 that it would remain as British as I would say 

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.840
 That's as comfortable as British 

00:07:03.629 --> 00:07:07.599
 so he spoke and the diesel of the shortened Marek dealer I must 

00:07:07.599 --> 00:07:11.220
 honest and direct pretty cool she wants the participation instead of the daughter 

00:07:11.219 --> 00:07:14.219
 that only books from Picasso 

00:07:15.129 --> 00:07:18.289
 But you have to know that you lived there 

00:07:18.289 --> 00:07:21.289
 it gets over stuff so he gets lucky 

00:07:22.939 --> 00:07:26.110
 the posh, all this is the tactics totally 

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:29.099
 It is common practice for years to talk about them 

00:07:29.099 --> 00:07:30.399
 the branches are 

00:07:30.399 --> 00:07:33.399
 already reasonably challenging for you to say 

00:07:35.089 --> 00:07:38.649
 there it is a very good adventure lunch is quite good team 

00:07:38.649 --> 00:07:41.210
 who really is to Margot which player is 

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:43.419
 Let them play for sale for God's sake 

00:07:43.419 --> 00:07:45.539
 that should be the example 

00:07:45.539 --> 00:07:48.729
 so Dorner her ex-command ancestors 

00:07:48.729 --> 00:07:51.610
 and it makes it empty is the middle but also 

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:53.550
 based on again two player gymnasts 

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:55.970
 I did not play at Bendix Dante's two
