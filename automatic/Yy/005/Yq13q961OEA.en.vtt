I try and get you guys to think outside

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.980 
I try and get you guys to think outside
of<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.260> box<00:00:25.320> as<00:00:25.680> much<00:00:25.890> as<00:00:26.039> I<00:00:26.130> can<00:00:26.189> I<00:00:26.990> really

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
of the box as much as I can I really

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.700 
of the box as much as I can I really
quickly<00:00:28.439> put<00:00:28.800> this<00:00:28.949> together<00:00:30.230> this<00:00:31.230> is<00:00:31.439> very

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
quickly put this together this is very

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.090 
quickly put this together this is very
common<00:00:32.189> for<00:00:32.640> most<00:00:33.030> game<00:00:33.390> systems<00:00:33.960> it's<00:00:34.920> a

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
common for most game systems it's a

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.110 
common for most game systems it's a
basic<00:00:35.700> uh<00:00:35.880> like<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:36.809> terrain<00:00:38.120> randomized

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
basic uh like a terrain randomized

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.799 
basic uh like a terrain randomized
terrain<00:00:39.570> list<00:00:39.930> you<00:00:40.770> might<00:00:40.920> get<00:00:41.160> for<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.399> table

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
terrain list you might get for a table

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:45.319 
terrain list you might get for a table
you'll<00:00:42.809> find<00:00:42.870> these<00:00:43.320> in<00:00:43.350> 40k<00:00:44.329> warhammer

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
you'll find these in 40k warhammer

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.490 
you'll find these in 40k warhammer
fantasy<00:00:45.629> I<00:00:46.969> just<00:00:47.969> all<00:00:48.120> game<00:00:48.690> systems<00:00:49.170> tend<00:00:49.379> to

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
fantasy I just all game systems tend to

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.430 
fantasy I just all game systems tend to
have<00:00:49.649> some<00:00:50.010> sort<00:00:50.280> of<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.520> random<00:00:50.989> generation<00:00:51.989> of

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
have some sort of a random generation of

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.970 
have some sort of a random generation of
terrain<00:00:53.100> now<00:00:53.840> and<00:00:54.840> that's<00:00:55.079> great<00:00:55.379> that's<00:00:55.590> fine

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
terrain now and that's great that's fine

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.209 
terrain now and that's great that's fine
um<00:00:56.989> but<00:00:57.989> some<00:00:58.260> people<00:00:58.530> have<00:00:58.559> taken<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:58.980> step

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
um but some people have taken a step

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.099 
um but some people have taken a step
further<00:00:59.609> and<00:00:59.850> i<00:01:00.000> want<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.180> show<00:01:00.270> you<00:01:00.449> other<00:01:00.930> two

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
further and i want to show you other two

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.380 
further and i want to show you other two
different<00:01:01.829> classifications<00:01:02.640> of<00:01:02.820> this<00:01:03.090> um

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
different classifications of this um

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.090 
different classifications of this um
this<00:01:04.350> i<00:01:04.979> really<00:01:05.250> like<00:01:05.630> now<00:01:06.630> you<00:01:06.689> can

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
this i really like now you can

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.460 
this i really like now you can
graphically<00:01:08.930> represent<00:01:09.930> this<00:01:10.110> with<00:01:10.350> the

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
graphically represent this with the

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.800 
graphically represent this with the
table<00:01:10.830> I<00:01:10.979> mean<00:01:11.280> all<00:01:11.430> it<00:01:11.549> is<00:01:11.670> is<00:01:11.790> it's<00:01:12.299> 12-sided

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
table I mean all it is is it's 12-sided

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.140 
table I mean all it is is it's 12-sided
die<00:01:12.840> with<00:01:13.830> 12<00:01:14.130> different<00:01:14.220> possibilities<00:01:15.090> you

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
die with 12 different possibilities you

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.390 
die with 12 different possibilities you
might<00:01:15.299> get<00:01:15.479> your<00:01:15.600> single<00:01:15.960> room<00:01:16.369> like<00:01:17.369> a

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
might get your single room like a

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.600 
might get your single room like a
hallway<00:01:17.810> for<00:01:18.810> way<00:01:19.170> large<00:01:19.950> room<00:01:20.250> with<00:01:20.400> four

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
hallway for way large room with four

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.929 
hallway for way large room with four
openings<00:01:20.880> um<00:01:21.259> mmm<00:01:22.259> you<00:01:22.830> can<00:01:23.009> definitely<00:01:23.220> just

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
openings um mmm you can definitely just

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.630 
openings um mmm you can definitely just
write<00:01:24.240> down<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.900> description<00:01:25.170> I<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:25.890> or<00:01:26.070> even

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
write down the description I and or even

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.600 
write down the description I and or even
have<00:01:26.790> a<00:01:26.820> drawing<00:01:27.150> on<00:01:27.409> and<00:01:28.409> have<00:01:28.829> 12<00:01:29.250> of<00:01:29.430> them

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
have a drawing on and have 12 of them

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.490 
have a drawing on and have 12 of them
but<00:01:30.299> it's<00:01:30.420> kind<00:01:30.600> of<00:01:30.659> cool<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:30.900> have<00:01:31.140> it<00:01:31.290> in<00:01:31.380> a

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
but it's kind of cool to have it in a

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.840 
but it's kind of cool to have it in a
dice<00:01:31.770> format<00:01:32.369> um<00:01:32.720> I<00:01:33.720> run<00:01:34.290> at<00:01:34.409> eight<00:01:34.590> by<00:01:34.799> eight

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
dice format um I run at eight by eight

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.270 
dice format um I run at eight by eight
inch<00:01:35.850> system<00:01:36.479> and<00:01:36.750> it<00:01:37.380> tends<00:01:37.680> to<00:01:37.860> fall<00:01:38.070> right

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
inch system and it tends to fall right

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.160 
inch system and it tends to fall right
into<00:01:38.520> this<00:01:38.729> because<00:01:38.880> this<00:01:39.150> tends<00:01:39.659> to<00:01:39.780> be<00:01:39.869> in<00:01:40.049> a

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
into this because this tends to be in a

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.389 
into this because this tends to be in a
a<00:01:41.210> square<00:01:42.210> formation<00:01:42.710> so<00:01:43.710> I<00:01:43.740> can<00:01:44.009> literally

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
a square formation so I can literally

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.789 
a square formation so I can literally
use<00:01:44.430> this<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:45.149> generate<00:01:45.570> a<00:01:45.600> dungeon<00:01:46.140> with

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
use this to generate a dungeon with

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.530 
use this to generate a dungeon with
actual<00:01:47.250> dungeon<00:01:47.579> pieces<00:01:48.119> that<00:01:48.270> I<00:01:48.299> already

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
actual dungeon pieces that I already

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.109 
actual dungeon pieces that I already
have<00:01:48.840> I<00:01:48.869> have<00:01:49.290> a<00:01:49.590> section<00:01:50.399> for<00:01:50.729> each<00:01:50.790> one<00:01:51.090> of

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
have I have a section for each one of

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.200 
have I have a section for each one of
these<00:01:51.530> multiples<00:01:52.530> of<00:01:52.680> many<00:01:52.950> of<00:01:53.130> them<00:01:53.340> so<00:01:54.030> this

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
these multiples of many of them so this

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.719 
these multiples of many of them so this
is<00:01:54.360> one<00:01:54.600> really<00:01:55.079> kind<00:01:55.710> of<00:01:55.799> different<00:01:56.340> kind<00:01:56.670> of

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
is one really kind of different kind of

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.240 
is one really kind of different kind of
fun<00:01:57.030> way<00:01:57.299> to<00:01:57.630> generate<00:01:58.200> terrain<00:01:58.860> for<00:01:59.130> your

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
fun way to generate terrain for your

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.959 
fun way to generate terrain for your
games<00:01:59.490> um<00:01:59.899> if<00:02:00.899> you're<00:02:01.140> like<00:02:01.320> an<00:02:01.439> RPG<00:02:02.040> or<00:02:02.070> or<00:02:02.369> you

and I apologize I looked all over I
can't<00:02:10.410> remember<00:02:10.470> what<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.790> companies<00:02:12.209> that

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
can't remember what the companies that

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.850 
can't remember what the companies that
produces<00:02:12.900> these

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
produces these

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.100 
produces these
it's<00:02:14.010> a<00:02:14.100> really<00:02:14.370> slick<00:02:14.880> system<00:02:15.420> they<00:02:15.570> have<00:02:15.600> a<00:02:15.750> 5

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
it's a really slick system they have a 5

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.860 
it's a really slick system they have a 5
die<00:02:16.380> system<00:02:16.890> that<00:02:17.040> you<00:02:17.190> can<00:02:17.220> buy<00:02:17.610> I<00:02:17.940> think

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
die system that you can buy I think

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.080 
die system that you can buy I think
there's<00:02:19.080> like<00:02:19.140> a<00:02:19.290> cavern<00:02:19.830> one<00:02:20.130> there's<00:02:20.880> an

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
there's like a cavern one there's an

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.000 
there's like a cavern one there's an
underground<00:02:21.390> one<00:02:22.020> which<00:02:22.320> is<00:02:22.500> this<00:02:22.710> one<00:02:22.950> right

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
underground one which is this one right

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.320 
underground one which is this one right
here<00:02:23.220> and<00:02:23.550> then<00:02:23.820> they<00:02:23.910> also<00:02:24.060> have<00:02:24.270> an

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
here and then they also have an

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.220 
here and then they also have an
aboveground<00:02:24.660> one<00:02:26.480> for<00:02:27.480> like<00:02:27.600> cities<00:02:28.020> and

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
aboveground one for like cities and

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.250 
aboveground one for like cities and
villages<00:02:28.350> and<00:02:28.770> whatnot<00:02:29.160> and<00:02:29.450> um<00:02:30.450> this<00:02:31.020> is<00:02:31.230> a

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
villages and whatnot and um this is a

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.660 
villages and whatnot and um this is a
really<00:02:31.620> cool<00:02:32.210> concept<00:02:33.210> because<00:02:34.200> um<00:02:34.590> it<00:02:35.160> gives

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
really cool concept because um it gives

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.080 
really cool concept because um it gives
you<00:02:35.940> ah<00:02:36.830> 30<00:02:37.830> different<00:02:38.040> options<00:02:38.520> it<00:02:38.670> gives<00:02:38.880> you

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
you ah 30 different options it gives you

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.160 
you ah 30 different options it gives you
5<00:02:39.600> or<00:02:40.380> I<00:02:40.440> mean<00:02:40.650> sorry<00:02:40.920> six<00:02:41.280> sides<00:02:41.520> /<00:02:42.030> and<00:02:42.390> then<00:02:42.900> 5

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
5 or I mean sorry six sides / and then 5

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.010 
5 or I mean sorry six sides / and then 5
dies<00:02:43.440> so<00:02:43.770> 5<00:02:44.010> times<00:02:44.040> 6<00:02:44.490> is<00:02:44.670> 30<00:02:44.970> now<00:02:45.570> the<00:02:45.630> cool

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
dies so 5 times 6 is 30 now the cool

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:51.440 
dies so 5 times 6 is 30 now the cool
thing<00:02:46.050> is<00:02:46.320> um<00:02:48.500> you<00:02:49.500> know<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:49.950> way<00:02:50.880> you<00:02:50.940> stack

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
thing is um you know the way you stack

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.510 
thing is um you know the way you stack
this<00:02:51.690> key<00:02:51.989> go<00:02:52.140> way<00:02:52.410> beyond<00:02:52.800> just<00:02:53.220> the

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
this key go way beyond just the

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.190 
this key go way beyond just the
simplification<00:02:54.330> of<00:02:54.390> okay<00:02:54.690> this<00:02:54.840> is<00:02:55.020> what<00:02:55.170> I'm

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
simplification of okay this is what I'm

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.880 
simplification of okay this is what I'm
working<00:02:55.440> with<00:02:55.620> you<00:02:56.610> can<00:02:56.970> for<00:02:57.360> instance<00:02:57.890> you

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
working with you can for instance you

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.040 
working with you can for instance you
know<00:02:58.920> roll<00:02:59.400> this<00:02:59.700> and<00:03:00.030> then<00:03:00.390> okay<00:03:00.600> this<00:03:00.780> is<00:03:00.930> my

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
know roll this and then okay this is my

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.560 
know roll this and then okay this is my
starting<00:03:01.410> location<00:03:01.680> or<00:03:02.670> you<00:03:02.850> know<00:03:02.940> wherever

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
starting location or you know wherever

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.370 
starting location or you know wherever
that<00:03:03.900> is<00:03:03.930> now<00:03:04.890> you<00:03:05.400> can<00:03:05.690> roll<00:03:06.690> a<00:03:06.720> die<00:03:06.989> in

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
that is now you can roll a die in

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.160 
that is now you can roll a die in
determine<00:03:08.220> which<00:03:08.340> one's<00:03:08.690> going<00:03:09.690> to<00:03:09.720> be<00:03:09.900> your

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
determine which one's going to be your

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.630 
determine which one's going to be your
beginning<00:03:10.560> point<00:03:10.860> let's<00:03:11.100> say<00:03:11.250> you're<00:03:11.430> always

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
beginning point let's say you're always

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.210 
beginning point let's say you're always
going<00:03:11.760> to<00:03:11.820> begin<00:03:12.120> like<00:03:12.540> you<00:03:13.380> know<00:03:13.500> your<00:03:13.980> first

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
going to begin like you know your first

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.790 
going to begin like you know your first
died<00:03:14.550> at<00:03:14.880> the<00:03:15.030> top<00:03:15.239> and<00:03:15.600> you<00:03:16.230> even<00:03:16.350> have<00:03:16.500> two

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
died at the top and you even have two

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.880 
died at the top and you even have two
options<00:03:16.980> so<00:03:17.310> you<00:03:17.370> can<00:03:17.430> go<00:03:17.550> left<00:03:17.760> or<00:03:17.850> right<00:03:17.910> arm

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
options so you can go left or right arm

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:24.710 
options so you can go left or right arm
then<00:03:20.060> you<00:03:21.060> can<00:03:21.269> roll<00:03:21.600> your<00:03:22.040> next<00:03:23.040> guy<00:03:23.459> and<00:03:23.940> then

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
then you can roll your next guy and then

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.270 
then you can roll your next guy and then
roll<00:03:24.930> a<00:03:24.959> die<00:03:25.140> to<00:03:25.200> find<00:03:25.470> out<00:03:25.620> where<00:03:25.950> does<00:03:26.130> this

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
roll a die to find out where does this

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.030 
roll a die to find out where does this
hook<00:03:26.760> up<00:03:26.940> does<00:03:27.209> this<00:03:27.390> is<00:03:27.630> this<00:03:27.840> you<00:03:28.170> know<00:03:28.260> top

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
hook up does this is this you know top

particular<00:03:36.390> one<00:03:36.690> you<00:03:36.959> can<00:03:37.380> begin<00:03:37.530> to<00:03:37.680> see

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
particular one you can begin to see

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:41.150 
particular one you can begin to see
where<00:03:38.130> the<00:03:38.250> mathematical<00:03:39.650> branching<00:03:40.650> of<00:03:40.799> this

where the mathematical branching of this

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.400 
where the mathematical branching of this
can<00:03:41.400> go<00:03:41.549> out<00:03:41.670> to<00:03:41.940> where<00:03:42.120> there's<00:03:42.410> probably

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
can go out to where there's probably

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.160 
can go out to where there's probably
thousands<00:03:44.070> of<00:03:44.250> possible<00:03:44.459> combinations<00:03:45.420> on

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
thousands of possible combinations on

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.100 
thousands of possible combinations on
and<00:03:46.830> how<00:03:47.190> they<00:03:47.370> hook<00:03:47.580> up<00:03:47.760> you<00:03:48.540> know<00:03:48.660> depending

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
and how they hook up you know depending

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.699 
and how they hook up you know depending
on<00:03:49.230> where<00:03:49.410> you<00:03:49.560> start<00:03:49.950> um<00:03:50.390> and<00:03:51.390> what's<00:03:52.110> next<00:03:52.410> to

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
on where you start um and what's next to

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.560 
on where you start um and what's next to
it<00:03:52.830> and<00:03:53.010> how<00:03:53.190> it<00:03:53.430> how<00:03:53.670> it<00:03:53.850> configures<00:03:54.390> and

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
it and how it how it configures and

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:56.090 
it and how it how it configures and
goals<00:03:54.720> this<00:03:54.930> one's<00:03:55.110> fairly<00:03:55.320> symmetrical<00:03:55.950> but

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
goals this one's fairly symmetrical but

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.130 
goals this one's fairly symmetrical but
this<00:03:56.250> is<00:03:56.400> this<00:03:56.730> is<00:03:56.910> a<00:03:56.940> very<00:03:57.180> asymmetrical<00:03:57.900> one

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
this is this is a very asymmetrical one

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.440 
this is this is a very asymmetrical one
and<00:03:58.380> you'll<00:03:59.370> notice<00:03:59.610> that<00:03:59.760> it's<00:04:00.000> got<00:04:00.150> two

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
and you'll notice that it's got two

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.560 
and you'll notice that it's got two
possible<00:04:01.140> openings<00:04:01.590> in<00:04:01.799> each<00:04:01.950> one<00:04:02.239> so<00:04:03.239> it

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
possible openings in each one so it

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.890 
possible openings in each one so it
gives<00:04:03.780> you<00:04:04.049> a<00:04:04.080> lot<00:04:04.590> of<00:04:04.650> gridwork

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
gives you a lot of gridwork

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.190 
gives you a lot of gridwork
possibilities<00:04:06.900> um<00:04:08.660> the<00:04:09.660> other<00:04:09.690> thing<00:04:09.959> I

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
possibilities um the other thing I

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.880

let's<00:04:26.660> say<00:04:26.780> you've<00:04:26.900> got<00:04:27.050> a<00:04:27.080> corner<00:04:27.919> that<00:04:28.070> you

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
let's say you've got a corner that you

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.900 
let's say you've got a corner that you
don't<00:04:28.310> really<00:04:28.490> use<00:04:28.669> and<00:04:28.940> his<00:04:29.780> his<00:04:30.290> tables<00:04:31.040> his

don't really use and his his tables his
uh<00:04:31.940> his<00:04:32.590> you<00:04:33.590> know<00:04:33.710> tiles<00:04:34.430> that<00:04:34.520> he<00:04:34.639> fights<00:04:34.880> on

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
uh his you know tiles that he fights on

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.000 
uh his you know tiles that he fights on
her<00:04:35.150> are<00:04:35.300> no<00:04:36.230> more<00:04:36.410> than<00:04:36.530> a<00:04:36.620> half<00:04:36.800> an<00:04:36.919> inch
