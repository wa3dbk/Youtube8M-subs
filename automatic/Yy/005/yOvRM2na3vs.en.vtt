now<00:03:06.870> it's<00:03:07.380> not<00:03:07.650> exactly<00:03:07.830> like<00:03:08.400> the<00:03:08.550> Little

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
now it's not exactly like the Little

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.880 
now it's not exactly like the Little
Mermaid<00:03:09.090> but<00:03:09.600> those<00:03:09.720> facts<00:03:10.050> alone<00:03:10.230> short<00:03:10.530> told

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
Mermaid but those facts alone short told

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.440 
Mermaid but those facts alone short told
us<00:03:11.070> what<00:03:11.280> direction<00:03:11.580> this<00:03:11.850> film<00:03:12.090> was<00:03:12.209> trying

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
us what direction this film was trying

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.990 
us what direction this film was trying
to<00:03:12.540> go<00:03:12.690> to<00:03:12.720> now<00:03:13.680> here's<00:03:14.220> my<00:03:14.400> theory

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
to go to now here's my theory

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.840 
to go to now here's my theory
on<00:03:15.420> a<00:03:15.480> successful<00:03:16.170> movie<00:03:16.500> it's<00:03:17.310> one<00:03:17.610> thing<00:03:17.790> for

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
on a successful movie it's one thing for

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.550 
on a successful movie it's one thing for
film<00:03:18.239> to<00:03:18.360> be<00:03:18.450> successful<00:03:19.019> because<00:03:19.140> of<00:03:19.380> a<00:03:19.440> good

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
film to be successful because of a good

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.380 
film to be successful because of a good
plot<00:03:19.830> creative<00:03:20.700> characters<00:03:21.090> and<00:03:21.300> great

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
plot creative characters and great

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.210 
plot creative characters and great
actors<00:03:21.780> and<00:03:21.930> actresses<00:03:22.290> but<00:03:22.860> it's<00:03:22.980> another

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
actors and actresses but it's another

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.070 
actors and actresses but it's another
thing<00:03:23.489> when<00:03:23.550> a<00:03:23.700> film<00:03:23.910> tries<00:03:24.180> to<00:03:24.300> sort<00:03:24.690> of<00:03:24.810> use

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
thing when a film tries to sort of use

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.479 
thing when a film tries to sort of use
the<00:03:25.260> same<00:03:25.290> formula<00:03:25.769> that<00:03:25.920> was<00:03:26.100> used<00:03:26.340> in<00:03:26.430> a

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
the same formula that was used in a

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:29.840 
the same formula that was used in a
previous<00:03:26.700> book<00:03:27.150> I<00:03:27.360> mean<00:03:27.959> in<00:03:28.230> my<00:03:28.860> eyes<00:03:29.040> whenever

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
previous book I mean in my eyes whenever

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.670 
previous book I mean in my eyes whenever
a<00:03:30.060> film<00:03:30.330> uses<00:03:30.600> the<00:03:30.690> same<00:03:30.870> formula<00:03:31.200> for<00:03:31.410> another

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
a film uses the same formula for another

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.770 
a film uses the same formula for another
film<00:03:31.980> it<00:03:32.190> usually<00:03:32.790> doesn't<00:03:32.970> go<00:03:33.269> well<00:03:33.540> because

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
film it usually doesn't go well because

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.390 
film it usually doesn't go well because
the<00:03:33.959> audience<00:03:34.380> has<00:03:34.500> already<00:03:34.890> seen<00:03:35.130> a<00:03:35.160> film

the audience has already seen a film
that<00:03:35.610> was<00:03:35.730> just<00:03:35.940> like<00:03:36.090> it<00:03:36.330> also<00:03:37.110> this<00:03:37.440> film<00:03:37.680> has

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
that was just like it also this film has

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.500 
that was just like it also this film has
way<00:03:38.130> too<00:03:38.160> many<00:03:38.550> villains<00:03:38.790> and<00:03:39.090> most<00:03:39.330> of<00:03:39.450> the

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
way too many villains and most of the

way too many villains and most of the
villains<00:03:39.780> in<00:03:39.870> this<00:03:39.959> film<00:03:40.200> were<00:03:40.320> team<00:03:40.470> innocent

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
villains in this film were team innocent

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.370 
villains in this film were team innocent
now<00:03:41.730> I<00:03:42.060> don't<00:03:42.510> have<00:03:42.600> a<00:03:42.630> problem<00:03:42.870> with<00:03:43.050> villains

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
now I don't have a problem with villains

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.140 
now I don't have a problem with villains
doing<00:03:43.680> good<00:03:43.920> or<00:03:44.250> villains<00:03:44.550> having<00:03:44.790> conflict

now we just move on like I'm doing now
over<00:04:53.580> I<00:04:53.610> get<00:04:53.910> some<00:04:54.090> only<00:04:54.270> on<00:04:54.390> five<00:04:54.600> out<00:04:54.780> of<00:04:54.810> ten

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
over I get some only on five out of ten

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.440 
over I get some only on five out of ten
since<00:04:55.440> I<00:04:55.650> think<00:04:56.100> this<00:04:56.310> was<00:04:56.460> a<00:04:56.490> very<00:04:56.850> cute<00:04:57.090> movie

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:57.450 
since I think this was a very cute movie

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:58.970 
since I think this was a very cute movie
I<00:04:57.630> think<00:04:58.170> that<00:04:58.290> the<00:04:58.380> characters<00:04:58.710> could<00:04:58.860> have

00:04:58.970 --> 00:04:58.980 
I think that the characters could have

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:01.010 
I think that the characters could have
used<00:04:59.250> a<00:04:59.400> little<00:04:59.970> bit<00:05:00.060> more<00:05:00.210> improvement<00:05:00.840> and

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
used a little bit more improvement and

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:02.180 
used a little bit more improvement and
it<00:05:01.200> could<00:05:01.350> have<00:05:01.440> been<00:05:01.470> a<00:05:01.590> little<00:05:01.800> more<00:05:01.980> rich

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
it could have been a little more rich

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:08.590 
it could have been a little more rich

just didn't phase me
now<00:05:47.430> if<00:05:47.610> Giacomo<00:05:48.060> had<00:05:48.210> attempted<00:05:48.450> to<00:05:48.660> take

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.360 
is somehow separate from drama home

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.060 
is somehow separate from drama home
because<00:05:54.600> of<00:05:54.630> the<00:05:54.780> Opstal<00:05:55.200> send<00:05:55.770> that<00:05:55.890> would

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:56.070 
because of the Opstal send that would

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:57.410 
because of the Opstal send that would
have<00:05:56.160> been<00:05:56.250> different<00:05:56.670> because<00:05:57.000> then<00:05:57.330> the

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:57.420 
have been different because then the

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:58.790 
have been different because then the
plot<00:05:57.600> would<00:05:57.810> have<00:05:57.900> had<00:05:57.990> made<00:05:58.170> more<00:05:58.410> sense<00:05:58.650> to

00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 
plot would have had made more sense to

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.920 
plot would have had made more sense to
that<00:05:58.920> point<00:05:59.250> also<00:06:00.120> they<00:06:00.450> waited<00:06:00.720> to<00:06:00.810> the<00:06:00.840> last

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:00.930 
that point also they waited to the last

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:02.900 
that point also they waited to the last
minute<00:06:01.410> of<00:06:01.650> the<00:06:01.740> film<00:06:01.920> to<00:06:01.980> get<00:06:02.100> Giacomo<00:06:02.460> injury
