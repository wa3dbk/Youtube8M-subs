00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.330
 and for all those who have a 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:09.929
 drawer and you have the problem of sounding 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.550
 what 's the microphone or why is it 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.400
 move over the whole drawer when you are 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.570
 touching it occurred to me I was looking for 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.300
 see if there was some invention to be able 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.859
 hold the microphone but so far not 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.789
 I had found nothing so I was done 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.780
 my own invention bought several pieces 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:27.420
 individually 

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.980
 here you can see a pretty clamp 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.970
 simple 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.970
 now I explain the model 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:38.590
 the microphone 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:44.490
 the clamp with an adapter 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:45.560
 and the thickness that matches this flexo 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.810
 ah 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:50.530
 [Music] 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:53.320
 and a screw this was found by that and 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:56.060
 great to hold everything to this 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:58.300
 clamp and hold it 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:01.059
 to the drawer 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.489
 I explain all this and I tell you that 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:05.830
 final comes out quite economically 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:07.390
 taking into account the work that goes into 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:12.240
 do 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.240
 so I tell you this clamp 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:18.130
 you can find it 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:20.930
 It is a th 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:23.060
 25s 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.700
 this is in this case it is black and 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.620
 I've got it Enzo Man is not for 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.420
 advertise but good 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:34.880
 you see that the price is worth it 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:37.280
 a little more expensive would come out 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.799
 the extension hose on which it will go 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:44.439
 subject the microphone also in this case 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:46.680
 960 this is from the company street m 206 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:49.420
 black color 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.670
 I have picked this cheese 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:55.549
 with 20 centimeters sorry 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.500
 I think there was another one a little bit more 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:59.710
 long but good with this I think that 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.710
 OK 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.580
 and now 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:11.370
 I explain a little how the subject goes 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:12.989
 As you can see, it 's very simple, sorry 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.310
 It's nerves and I'm doing it with 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:21.620
 hand 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:21.620
 screw to the clamp 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.950
 in pink 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:31.200
 we hold 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.590
 Hello 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:37.510
 and the microphone 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:39.680
 I ride it and see how it would look 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:43.370
 in this case 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:47.050
 already screwed in screw 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:50.920
 and the flexor speaker to the clamp 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:53.580
 now I put the clamp for the microphone and 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.580
 here we have 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.570
 a lot 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.180
 the invention 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.040
 and this now I'm going to hold it in the 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.360
 drawer 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.360
 and here you have it 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.890
 it's pretty simple 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.120
 is 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:30.090
 located a position that more us 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.090
 agree 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.959
 one moment 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:46.970
 the ready 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.970
 then already the position then 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.709
 the one you like the most 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:06.219
 in this case the opposite 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:12.020
 up instead of down because the flexo 

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:13.580
 although it has a good rigidity 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:16.100
 if you put it with the microphone 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:19.000
 up if subject 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.000
 shuttle 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:26.300
 accessing then put up here 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:27.889
 this is held very well with the clamp 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.229
 and with the same weight of the microphone 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:32.060
 we can or less get the position 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:35.249
 a little 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:37.870
 and good but then already 

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:41.280
 depending on what you want as if 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:43.260
 you want to put it up here you know 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.060
 it's not very complicated in that sense 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:48.060
 I have here a little loose it is 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:50.420
 doing with one hand and not to her taste 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.880
 can rotate the flexo 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:55.640
 but with a more complicated hand I was 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.230
 it is loose without more once the 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:59.180
 cable then here you can attach it with 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:02.420
 some adhesive tape 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:05.710
 that's how you see it but well you see 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:09.150
 what is the clamp 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.150
 the flexo 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:16.790
 clamp to the microphone as 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:18.830
 about 20 twenty-something 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:20.800
 euros and if you have a list that what 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:23.870
 I had at home then nothing the clamp 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:26.660
 and the flexo 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:28.790
 at less than 15 euros 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:32.540
 and this then 

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:34.730
 you are not going to leave here easily 

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:37.130
 so even though we're going with the drawer 

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:39.070
 a few meters in microphone no 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:41.590
 will follow 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:44.220
 I'm not going to press a little 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:44.220
 good 

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:48.710
 and I'm going to put it more or less in this 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:52.129
 position 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:54.110
 and I can only try it in concert 

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:56.509
 I'll tell you to see but in principle 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:58.639
 where then better solution than this of 

00:05:56.509 --> 00:06:00.229
 sound and move the drawer and 

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:04.189
 miss all the equalization and so on 

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:06.289
 that is crazy will be much better and 

00:06:04.189 --> 00:06:08.089
 so we want to move it closer or closer 

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:09.830
 microphone is already another topic that will be that 

00:06:08.089 --> 00:06:11.089
 go looking for the possibility but good 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:13.160
 I tell you that it is more or less 

00:06:11.089 --> 00:06:15.620
 quite the ejidillo 

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:17.690
 let's create a lot less than is supposed 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:19.430
 that you are not going to see me in this case 

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:22.040
 I'm interested 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:23.990
 that catches a little the bottom 

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:26.600
 of the drawer because I'm playing with the 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:29.760
 brushes and the tip of the tip of the 

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:32.930
 brush is like the front 

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:32.930
 [Music] 

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:39.980
 I come to play a lot the lower part of 

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:42.120
 drawer I'm interested in getting caught 

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:44.430
 [Music] 

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:45.969
 apart from the serious 

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:48.899
 but good 

00:06:45.969 --> 00:06:52.469
 that already to the taste of each one you already see that 

00:06:48.899 --> 00:06:52.469
 the posibilities 

00:06:53.139 --> 00:06:59.189
 They are not bad, I hope they serve a single 

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:59.189
 Thank you
