00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
out this video for more info and we will

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.620 
out this video for more info and we will
start<00:00:13.799> with<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.910> cpu-z

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
start with the cpu-z

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.689 
start with the cpu-z
that<00:00:16.139> will<00:00:16.260> give<00:00:16.410> us<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:16.740> information<00:00:17.220> about

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
that will give us the information about

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.939 
that will give us the information about
this<00:00:17.850> phone<00:00:18.119> and<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:18.900> specs<00:00:19.140> are<00:00:19.289> also<00:00:19.439> very

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
this phone and the specs are also very

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.130 
this phone and the specs are also very
good<00:00:20.130> and<00:00:20.340> as<00:00:20.520> you<00:00:20.609> can<00:00:20.789> see<00:00:20.970> it's<00:00:21.570> powered<00:00:22.109> by

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
good and as you can see it's powered by

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.990 
good and as you can see it's powered by
a<00:00:23.150> Qualcomm<00:00:24.150> crowd<00:00:25.160> quad-core<00:00:26.160> chip<00:00:26.490> clocked

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
a Qualcomm crowd quad-core chip clocked

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.720 
a Qualcomm crowd quad-core chip clocked
at<00:00:27.210> 1.5<00:00:27.990> gigahertz<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.859> minimum<00:00:29.189> clock<00:00:29.429> speed

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
at 1.5 gigahertz the minimum clock speed

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.209 
at 1.5 gigahertz the minimum clock speed
that<00:00:29.880> it<00:00:30.000> can<00:00:30.150> go<00:00:30.300> is<00:00:30.570> 384<00:00:31.529> megahertz<00:00:32.009> in<00:00:32.130> the

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
that it can go is 384 megahertz in the

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.680 
that it can go is 384 megahertz in the
Maxis<00:00:33.020> 1.51<00:00:34.070> so<00:00:35.070> it's<00:00:35.430> a<00:00:35.610> very<00:00:35.940> good<00:00:36.149> processor

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
Maxis 1.51 so it's a very good processor

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.869 
Maxis 1.51 so it's a very good processor
a<00:00:36.960> quad-core<00:00:37.410> processor<00:00:37.590> and<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.280> GPU<00:00:38.670> on

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
a quad-core processor and the GPU on

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.020 
a quad-core processor and the GPU on
this<00:00:39.059> is<00:00:39.239> an<00:00:39.329> Adreno<00:00:39.780> 320<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.800> let's<00:00:41.610> look<00:00:41.879> at

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
this is an Adreno 320 and let's look at

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.569 
this is an Adreno 320 and let's look at
the<00:00:42.180> system<00:00:42.420> and<00:00:43.250> the<00:00:44.250> board<00:00:44.700> is<00:00:44.910> MSM<00:00:45.690> 8<00:00:46.170> 9<00:00:46.559> 6<00:00:46.950> 0

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
2300 milliampere battery so let me get

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.090 
2300 milliampere battery so let me get
out<00:00:56.910> of<00:00:57.000> this<00:00:57.149> one<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:57.660> that's<00:00:58.379> when<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.859> Nina

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
out of this one and that's when the Nina

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.330 
out of this one and that's when the Nina
mark<00:00:59.370> benchmark<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:00.530> I<00:01:01.530> ran<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:01.859> earlier<00:01:02.160> also

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
mark benchmark and I ran it earlier also

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.359 
mark benchmark and I ran it earlier also
and<00:01:02.699> I<00:01:02.940> got<00:01:03.180> a<00:01:03.210> very<00:01:03.570> good<00:01:03.840> score<00:01:04.170> again<00:01:05.129> the

and I got a very good score again the

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.210 
and I got a very good score again the
arena<00:01:05.850> 320<00:01:06.390> is<00:01:06.510> a<00:01:06.540> very<00:01:06.869> powerful<00:01:07.110> GPU<00:01:07.740> hence

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
arena 320 is a very powerful GPU hence

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.120 
arena 320 is a very powerful GPU hence
as<00:01:08.580> you<00:01:08.670> can<00:01:08.820> see<00:01:09.030> it's<00:01:09.659> almost<00:01:09.990> maxing<00:01:10.950> out

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
as you can see it's almost maxing out

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.940 
as you can see it's almost maxing out
the<00:01:11.640> performance<00:01:12.600> here<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.260> that's<00:01:13.650> a<00:01:13.799> very

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
the performance here and that's a very

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.030 
the performance here and that's a very
good<00:01:14.100> thing<00:01:14.570> so<00:01:15.570> even<00:01:15.600> for<00:01:16.080> gaming<00:01:16.530> this<00:01:16.710> phone

out and remove these i also ran the
antutu<00:02:35.040> benchmark<00:02:35.190> so<00:02:35.760> let's<00:02:35.970> look<00:02:36.269> at<00:02:36.450> the

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
antutu benchmark so let's look at the

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:41.870 
antutu benchmark so let's look at the
scores<00:02:38.239> and<00:02:39.739> as<00:02:40.739> you<00:02:40.860> can<00:02:40.980> see<00:02:41.160> again<00:02:41.280> here<00:02:41.730> we

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
scores and as you can see again here we

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.340 
scores and as you can see again here we
get<00:02:42.000> excellent<00:02:42.329> score<00:02:42.780> of<00:02:42.959> twenty<00:02:43.320> one

and these are the detailed scores for

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.319 
and these are the detailed scores for
the<00:02:49.440> antutu<00:02:49.769> benchmark<00:02:49.920> I<00:02:50.700> mean<00:02:51.150> very

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
the antutu benchmark I mean very

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:54.410 
the antutu benchmark I mean very
impressive<00:02:51.870> scores<00:02:52.560> now<00:02:53.280> let<00:02:53.730> me<00:02:53.880> also<00:02:54.060> run

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
impressive scores now let me also run

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.380 
impressive scores now let me also run
one<00:02:54.660> more<00:02:54.840> benchmark<00:02:55.350> that's<00:02:55.560> the<00:02:56.239> epic<00:02:57.239> sea

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
one more benchmark that's the epic sea

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.140 
one more benchmark that's the epic sea
turtle<00:02:57.720> and<00:02:57.840> this<00:02:58.200> tested<00:02:58.709> GPU<00:02:59.130> and<00:02:59.549> this<00:03:00.030> is

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
turtle and this tested GPU and this is

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.410 
turtle and this tested GPU and this is
great<00:03:00.390> for<00:03:00.690> gaming<00:03:00.989> performance<00:03:01.260> and<00:03:02.420> serve

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
great for gaming performance and serve

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.960 
great for gaming performance and serve
hard<00:03:04.200> by<00:03:04.410> Unreal<00:03:04.739> Engine

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.100 

so<00:03:08.970> this<00:03:09.420> is<00:03:09.569> the<00:03:09.690> effect<00:03:10.080> so<00:03:10.440> the<00:03:10.500> truth<00:03:10.769> and

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
so this is the effect so the truth and

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.140 
so this is the effect so the truth and
let's<00:03:13.110> just<00:03:13.860> move<00:03:14.010> around<00:03:14.220> it's<00:03:14.489> interactive

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
let's just move around it's interactive

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.199 
let's just move around it's interactive
one<00:03:15.299> and<00:03:15.510> at<00:03:15.599> the<00:03:15.690> game<00:03:15.870> as<00:03:16.170> you<00:03:16.319> see<00:03:17.209> the

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
one and at the game as you see the

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.119 
one and at the game as you see the
character<00:03:18.629> moment<00:03:18.930> is<00:03:19.049> very<00:03:19.290> smooth<00:03:19.650> leather

00:03:20.119 --> 00:03:20.129 
character moment is very smooth leather

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:23.500 
character moment is very smooth leather
sister<00:03:20.730> run<00:03:21.000> the<00:03:21.150> benchmark<00:03:21.480> now<00:03:21.870> and<00:03:22.590> it's

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
sister run the benchmark now and it's

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.420 
sister run the benchmark now and it's
benchmarking<00:03:24.510> this<00:03:25.349> benchmark<00:03:25.769> the<00:03:26.129> steak

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
benchmarking this benchmark the steak

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.550 
benchmarking this benchmark the steak
some<00:03:26.670> time<00:03:26.909> to<00:03:27.120> complete<00:03:27.450> so<00:03:27.930> I<00:03:27.959> will<00:03:28.440> just

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
some time to complete so I will just

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.280 
some time to complete so I will just
quickly<00:03:28.769> skip<00:03:29.280> to<00:03:29.459> the<00:03:29.640> sports<00:03:30.450> but<00:03:30.870> again<00:03:31.140> as

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
quickly skip to the sports but again as

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.220 
quickly skip to the sports but again as
you<00:03:31.319> can<00:03:31.590> see<00:03:31.799> see<00:03:32.459> the<00:03:32.610> FPS<00:03:32.790> it's<00:03:33.299> almost<00:03:33.659> at

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
you can see see the FPS it's almost at

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:48.020 
you can see see the FPS it's almost at
50<00:03:34.709> in<00:03:35.250> 859<00:03:35.879> FPS<00:03:36.299> so<00:03:36.390> that's<00:03:36.569> again<00:03:36.810> very<00:03:37.049> good

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.660 

so<00:03:48.690> the<00:03:48.990> benchmarking<00:03:49.590> is<00:03:49.770> complete<00:03:50.250> and<00:03:50.490> as

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
so the benchmarking is complete and as

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.060 
so the benchmarking is complete and as
you<00:03:50.790> can<00:03:50.970> see<00:03:51.030> the<00:03:51.840> average<00:03:52.380> FPS<00:03:52.620> that

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
you can see the average FPS that

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:58.610 
you can see the average FPS that
regardez<00:03:53.810> 55.8<00:03:54.810> at<00:03:55.370> 720p<00:03:56.390> resolution<00:03:57.390> and<00:03:58.050> I

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
regardez 55.8 at 720p resolution and I

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.500 
regardez 55.8 at 720p resolution and I
would<00:03:58.800> say<00:03:58.950> that's<00:03:59.130> an<00:03:59.340> excellent<00:03:59.670> score<00:04:00.180> so

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
would say that's an excellent score so

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.780 
would say that's an excellent score so
let<00:04:00.660> us<00:04:00.690> also<00:04:00.960> get<00:04:01.200> out<00:04:01.320> of<00:04:01.440> this<00:04:01.650> so<00:04:02.550> these

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
let us also get out of this so these

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.790 
let us also get out of this so these
were<00:04:03.000> the<00:04:03.150> benchmark<00:04:03.690> scores<00:04:04.110> again<00:04:04.620> as<00:04:04.770> I

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800 
were the benchmark scores again as I

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.040 
were the benchmark scores again as I
always<00:04:05.190> said<00:04:05.610> benchmarks<00:04:06.540> just<00:04:06.810> give<00:04:06.959> you

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.050 
always said benchmarks just give you

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.140 
always said benchmarks just give you
half<00:04:07.320> the<00:04:07.410> story<00:04:07.530> so<00:04:08.250> I'll<00:04:08.370> also<00:04:08.550> be<00:04:08.760> doing<00:04:08.790> a

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
half the story so I'll also be doing a

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.150 
half the story so I'll also be doing a
gaming<00:04:09.750> review<00:04:10.050> for<00:04:10.230> the<00:04:10.380> Sony<00:04:10.620> experience

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
gaming review for the Sony experience

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.770 
gaming review for the Sony experience
that<00:04:11.310> are<00:04:11.430> very<00:04:11.730> sold<00:04:12.060> so<00:04:12.270> if<00:04:12.390> you<00:04:12.510> aren't
