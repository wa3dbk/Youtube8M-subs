00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:07.290
 so she initiates a specialty 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.670
 it is true that it exists since 1946 it was created by the members 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:11.879
 volunteers of the pot of earth 

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:14.879
 these are the founders of the prison 

00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:18.539
 first creation in 1946 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.239
 briefly started modestly 

00:00:20.239 --> 00:00:23.019
 feet in the sand hours on a simple camping table 

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:24.699
 by making the mini 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:25.849
 and as 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:27.890
 my friend michael such magnitude 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.080
 open end of December chefs on the beach and then in store 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.850
 so at the beginning at the dawn of the years at present in europe 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.130
 will play as well as a system of dannemarie 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.130
 he blamed copper and then when the sweet then 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.740
 the new panic was blowing there the sugar 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.380
 in a basin and there is brought to bercy alarm he assured 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.930
 so that's a big piece of sugar is about 25 kilos 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.210
 mounoubai verseaula thank you 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:59.830
 the mixer all with a 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:01.820
 however the machine 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.160
 and once it's a good job 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.910
 we will put the sugar on the step at 3 min 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.910
 once it's on the tables 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.440
 we will let the sugar cool first on a 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.100
 and then we go the bracelet in another way 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.100
 to cool in the same way 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.940
 do it regularly brew it in a hello way the giving arm 1 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.160
 for precisely for 100 euros simmering sugar the same way everywhere 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.490
 once this time says 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.560
 that the sugar is completely cooled we will remove 2 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.880
 sugar pretty much 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.820
 you have to stop patting his costs will keep them warm 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.300
 try it for sure we will resume then 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.810
 to shoot him 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.899
 in the fall that it's a completely natural way it's air that 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:48.140
 penetrates the sugar 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.580
 and by dint of drawn features 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.980
 it does not hold a satin white and it is useless rd 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.540
 and when you buy from another blonde 25 kilos of sugar eh 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.000
 well we just dropped on each side of the big blocks of 25 kilos 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.800
 once we have settled down well and in dams we will put rubles 25 kilos 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.139
 dance 

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:11.489
 we call the new machine halfway this year we upsets 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.949
 in the first part of the machine 

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:16.949
 she was rolling the sugar like that will eat it's going to sign her 

00:02:17.499 --> 00:02:20.079
 once you've got a template 

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:23.079
 at least we will have a little less important we will pass it no 

00:02:23.639 --> 00:02:26.969
 they are knurls in the center of a machine 

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:29.969
 the snake we will go inside 

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:34.039
 we will take 

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:38.199
 to learn the way of the machine that is to say that the bottom we go the 

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:42.029
 find cut out and with I hope that the machine 

00:02:43.119 --> 00:02:44.419
 more important 

00:02:44.419 --> 00:02:48.329
 sailor is the stick and we will find the niche we will go to the other side 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:48.680
 chain
