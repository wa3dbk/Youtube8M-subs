00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:53.599 
out of the way like that you don't want

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:57.899 
out of the way like that you don't want
any<00:02:53.900> pressure<00:02:54.230> on<00:02:54.349> the<00:02:54.439> brake<00:02:54.709> lines<00:02:54.980> and<00:02:56.409> then

00:02:57.899 --> 00:02:57.909 
any pressure on the brake lines and then

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:02.170 
any pressure on the brake lines and then
in<00:02:58.909> the<00:02:59.239> case<00:02:59.480> of<00:02:59.719> this<00:03:00.079> Kia<00:03:00.319> Sedona<00:03:00.970> we<00:03:01.970> just

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
in the case of this Kia Sedona we just

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:08.589 
in the case of this Kia Sedona we just
unscrew<00:03:02.689> this<00:03:02.870> one<00:03:03.079> screw<00:03:07.269> pull<00:03:08.269> it<00:03:08.510> a<00:03:08.540> little

00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:08.599 
unscrew this one screw pull it a little

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:12.729 
unscrew this one screw pull it a little
bit<00:03:10.840> just<00:03:11.840> might<00:03:12.079> take<00:03:12.260> quite<00:03:12.290> a<00:03:12.530> bit<00:03:12.680> of

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
bit just might take quite a bit of

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:19.420 
bit just might take quite a bit of
wiggling<00:03:16.420> so<00:03:17.420> as<00:03:17.569> you<00:03:17.689> can<00:03:17.810> see<00:03:18.139> I<00:03:18.590> cut<00:03:19.310> the

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
wiggling so as you can see I cut the

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:20.979 
wiggling so as you can see I cut the
video<00:03:19.519> just<00:03:19.909> to<00:03:20.060> I<00:03:20.090> see<00:03:20.450> me<00:03:20.540> the<00:03:20.629> time<00:03:20.840> of

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
video just to I see me the time of

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:22.390 
video just to I see me the time of
watching<00:03:21.109> me<00:03:21.500> you<00:03:21.709> know<00:03:21.829> wiggle<00:03:22.129> the<00:03:22.220> rotor

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
watching me you know wiggle the rotor

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.539 
watching me you know wiggle the rotor
off<00:03:22.639> of<00:03:22.819> there<00:03:22.939> it<00:03:23.419> did<00:03:23.659> come<00:03:23.840> out<00:03:23.870> so<00:03:24.650> let's

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:25.549 
off of there it did come out so let's

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:27.699 
off of there it did come out so let's
put<00:03:25.730> all<00:03:25.819> this<00:03:25.939> mess<00:03:26.000> back<00:03:26.209> together<00:03:26.709> let's

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
put all this mess back together let's

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:30.879 
put all this mess back together let's
grab<00:03:27.980> our<00:03:28.099> new<00:03:28.280> rotor<00:03:28.519> and<00:03:29.230> just<00:03:30.230> an<00:03:30.319> FYI<00:03:30.439> this

isn't any ruder this is the old one I'm
not<00:03:32.900> actually<00:03:33.079> changing<00:03:33.560> rotors<00:03:33.889> I<00:03:34.129> just<00:03:34.489> want

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:34.669 
not actually changing rotors I just want

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:37.690 
not actually changing rotors I just want
to<00:03:34.730> show<00:03:34.879> you<00:03:34.939> guys<00:03:35.060> how<00:03:35.269> to<00:03:35.299> do<00:03:36.370> line<00:03:37.370> up<00:03:37.400> the

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:39.799 
holes of the lug studs I'll throw it on

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:46.660 
holes of the lug studs I'll throw it on
there<00:03:42.909> find<00:03:43.909> that<00:03:44.060> screw<00:03:44.450> disconnected

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
there find that screw disconnected

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:56.500 
screw it right back in there so now the
new<00:03:54.260> rotor<00:03:54.500> is<00:03:54.739> on<00:03:54.950> it's<00:03:55.340> not<00:03:55.459> going<00:03:55.910> anywhere

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
new rotor is on it's not going anywhere

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:02.160 
new rotor is on it's not going anywhere
I'm<00:03:57.319> time<00:03:57.620> to<00:03:57.770> put<00:03:59.140> the<00:04:00.140> brake<00:04:00.349> pads<00:04:00.590> back<00:04:00.830> on

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
your car breaks you don't want your

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.490 
your car breaks you don't want your
breaks<00:04:46.850> giving<00:04:47.180> out<00:04:47.330> and<00:04:48.080> they're<00:04:48.169> driving

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
breaks giving out and they're driving

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:55.230 
breaks giving out and they're driving
down<00:04:48.530> the<00:04:48.800> road

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.330 

really<00:04:55.900> put<00:04:56.139> some<00:04:56.320> muscle<00:04:56.530> into<00:04:56.800> it<00:04:56.979> and

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
really put some muscle into it and

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.420 
really put some muscle into it and
really<00:04:57.550> make<00:04:57.610> sure<00:04:57.910> they're<00:04:58.120> on<00:04:58.270> their<00:04:59.430> that

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
really make sure they're on their that

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:04.050 
really make sure they're on their that
of<00:05:00.580> course<00:05:00.960> the<00:05:01.960> same<00:05:02.169> to<00:05:02.350> the<00:05:02.440> bottom<00:05:03.060> you

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
of course the same to the bottom you

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:05.790 
of course the same to the bottom you
might<00:05:04.840> find<00:05:05.050> that<00:05:05.199> you<00:05:05.320> made<00:05:05.470> the<00:05:05.590> top<00:05:05.770> a

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
might find that you made the top a

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.350 
might find that you made the top a
little<00:05:06.009> too<00:05:06.250> tight<00:05:06.520> now<00:05:06.759> you<00:05:06.820> can't<00:05:07.090> adjust

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
little too tight now you can't adjust

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.600 
little too tight now you can't adjust
the<00:05:07.690> bottom<00:05:08.080> if<00:05:08.139> that's<00:05:08.350> the<00:05:08.500> case<00:05:08.680> I<00:05:09.009> think<00:05:09.310> it

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
the bottom if that's the case I think it

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:16.189 
the bottom if that's the case I think it
is<00:05:09.729> with<00:05:09.880> me<00:05:10.350> loosen<00:05:11.350> the<00:05:11.410> top<00:05:11.590> a<00:05:11.650> little<00:05:11.860> bit

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:16.199 

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:19.439 

move<00:05:17.199> the<00:05:17.410> bottom<00:05:17.770> in<00:05:17.889> there<00:05:18.100> grab<00:05:19.030> your<00:05:19.240> screw

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:19.449 
move the bottom in there grab your screw

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:23.700 
move the bottom in there grab your screw
again<00:05:21.960> and<00:05:22.960> the<00:05:23.050> bottom<00:05:23.350> is<00:05:23.410> going<00:05:23.500> to<00:05:23.590> be<00:05:23.680> a

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710 
again and the bottom is going to be a

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:25.439 
again and the bottom is going to be a
lot<00:05:23.949> easier<00:05:24.340> because<00:05:24.520> it<00:05:24.789> just<00:05:24.910> slides<00:05:25.270> right

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:25.449 
lot easier because it just slides right

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:26.310 
lot easier because it just slides right
into<00:05:25.840> place

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:26.320 
into place

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:31.219 
into place
so<00:05:27.509> obviously<00:05:28.509> hand<00:05:28.870> tighten<00:05:29.199> it<00:05:29.289> first

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:31.229 
so obviously hand tighten it first

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:40.780 
so obviously hand tighten it first
grab<00:05:32.229> your<00:05:32.410> ratchet

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:40.790 

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:46.660 

ah<00:05:43.000> and<00:05:44.000> they<00:05:44.150> get<00:05:44.770> tight<00:05:45.770> tight<00:05:46.100> tight

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:46.670 
ah and they get tight tight tight

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:56.330 
ah and they get tight tight tight
don't<00:05:46.880> worry<00:05:47.030> break<00:05:47.330> start<00:05:47.660> off

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:56.340 

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:01.440 

okay<00:05:57.660> now<00:05:58.660> finally<00:05:59.580> the<00:06:00.580> final<00:06:00.820> step<00:06:01.240> is<00:06:01.420> to

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:01.450 
okay now finally the final step is to

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:04.140 
okay now finally the final step is to
take<00:06:01.690> your<00:06:01.810> caliper<00:06:02.200> bracket<00:06:02.560> again<00:06:03.150> actually

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:04.150 
take your caliper bracket again actually

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:06.330 
take your caliper bracket again actually
before<00:06:04.270> you<00:06:04.450> do<00:06:04.630> that<00:06:04.810> it's<00:06:05.050> a<00:06:05.140> good<00:06:05.290> idea<00:06:05.380> take

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:06.340 
before you do that it's a good idea take

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:09.830 
before you do that it's a good idea take
your<00:06:06.490> pliers<00:06:06.640> like<00:06:06.970> I<00:06:07.090> said<00:06:07.270> you<00:06:07.390> would<00:06:07.510> need

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:09.840 

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:13.080 

squeeze<00:06:10.840> the<00:06:11.080> brake<00:06:11.200> pads<00:06:11.590> together<00:06:11.890> so<00:06:12.880> the

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:13.090 
squeeze the brake pads together so the

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:20.440 
squeeze the brake pads together so the
caliper<00:06:13.390> bracket<00:06:13.840> goes<00:06:13.990> on<00:06:14.200> nice<00:06:14.530> and<00:06:14.770> easy

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:20.450 

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:24.100 

so<00:06:20.720> step<00:06:21.020> that

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:24.110 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:27.670 

take<00:06:24.409> caliper<00:06:24.949> bracket<00:06:25.990> slide<00:06:26.990> it<00:06:27.169> on<00:06:27.319> just

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:27.680 
take caliper bracket slide it on just

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:32.499 
take caliper bracket slide it on just
like<00:06:27.949> that<00:06:28.569> and<00:06:29.569> the<00:06:29.810> last<00:06:29.990> step<00:06:31.240> find<00:06:32.240> the<00:06:32.360> two

00:06:32.499 --> 00:06:32.509 
like that and the last step find the two

00:06:32.509 --> 00:06:37.420 
like that and the last step find the two
screws<00:06:32.840> unscrewed<00:06:33.349> from<00:06:33.379> there<00:06:36.250> stick<00:06:37.250> them
