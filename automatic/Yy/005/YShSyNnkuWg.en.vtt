submachine<00:00:32.099> guns<00:00:32.460> I<00:00:32.730> don't<00:00:33.329> really<00:00:33.600> find<00:00:33.900> this

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
submachine guns I don't really find this

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.110 
submachine guns I don't really find this
too<00:00:34.440> much<00:00:34.710> of<00:00:34.860> a<00:00:34.920> challenge<00:00:35.129> especially<00:00:35.519> since

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
too much of a challenge especially since

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.549 
too much of a challenge especially since
the<00:00:36.210> first<00:00:36.420> gun<00:00:36.629> master<00:00:36.870> game<00:00:37.170> I<00:00:37.320> played

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
the first gun master game I played

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.100 
the first gun master game I played
actually<00:00:37.739> won<00:00:38.159> and<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:39.300> hunter<00:00:39.809> kills<00:00:40.019> the

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
actually won and the hunter kills the

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.600 
actually won and the hunter kills the
submachine<00:00:40.409> guns<00:00:40.739> it's<00:00:40.860> pretty<00:00:41.040> easy<00:00:41.190> as<00:00:41.400> well

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
submachine guns it's pretty easy as well

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.850 
submachine guns it's pretty easy as well
so<00:00:42.239> this<00:00:42.420> should<00:00:42.600> go<00:00:42.659> into<00:00:42.809> a<00:00:42.900> TDM<00:00:43.320> server<00:00:43.589> or<00:00:43.829> a

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
so this should go into a TDM server or a

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.439 
so this should go into a TDM server or a
close-quarters<00:00:44.460> map<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:45.089> you<00:00:45.149> can<00:00:45.329> just

00:00:45.439 --> 00:00:45.449 
close-quarters map and you can just

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:47.899 
close-quarters map and you can just
grind<00:00:45.750> it<00:00:45.899> out<00:00:45.989> with<00:00:46.199> the<00:00:46.430> p90<00:00:47.430> or<00:00:47.550> something

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:47.909 
grind it out with the p90 or something

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:51.470 
grind it out with the p90 or something

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880

are they will probably compare the m5 k
to<00:01:29.940> the<00:01:30.119> mp7<00:01:30.619> thinking<00:01:31.619> that's<00:01:31.770> quite<00:01:32.009> similar

00:01:32.449 --> 00:01:32.459 
to the mp7 thinking that's quite similar

to the mp7 thinking that's quite similar
but<00:01:32.489> in<00:01:32.759> reality<00:01:32.970> they<00:01:33.539> actually<00:01:33.869> very

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
but in reality they actually very

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.809 
but in reality they actually very
different<00:01:34.500> in<00:01:34.739> fact<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.069> two<00:01:35.250> guns<00:01:35.489> are<00:01:35.670> so

00:01:35.809 --> 00:01:35.819 
different in fact the two guns are so

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:37.790 
different in fact the two guns are so
different<00:01:36.090> that<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.690> only<00:01:37.080> similarity<00:01:37.679> to

actually<00:01:38.130> share<00:01:38.489> is<00:01:38.789> pretty<00:01:39.360> vague<00:01:39.569> at<00:01:39.780> best<00:01:39.959> I

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
actually share is pretty vague at best I

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.380 
actually share is pretty vague at best I
mean<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.619> mp7<00:01:40.920> has<00:01:41.340> 950<00:01:41.940> rounds<00:01:42.060> per<00:01:42.270> minute
