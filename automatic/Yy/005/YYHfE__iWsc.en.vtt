00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:18.140 
first big projects by trail net and

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:20.890 
first big projects by trail net and
greenways<00:05:18.620> and<00:05:18.919> now<00:05:19.729> it<00:05:19.910> really<00:05:20.120> does<00:05:20.510> serve

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:20.900 
greenways and now it really does serve

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.409 
greenways and now it really does serve
as<00:05:21.140> a<00:05:21.200> bridge<00:05:21.669> joining<00:05:22.669> the<00:05:22.760> Missouri<00:05:23.090> bike

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:23.419 
as a bridge joining the Missouri bike

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:25.930 
as a bridge joining the Missouri bike
trails<00:05:23.780> to<00:05:24.110> an<00:05:24.290> extensive<00:05:25.010> system<00:05:25.220> of<00:05:25.580> paved

Madison County and beyond
so<00:05:31.460> it's<00:05:31.610> really<00:05:31.759> nice<00:05:32.029> that<00:05:32.090> we<00:05:32.360> have<00:05:32.539> these

00:05:32.709 --> 00:05:32.719 
so it's really nice that we have these

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:34.179 
so it's really nice that we have these
connections<00:05:33.199> and<00:05:33.620> they'll<00:05:33.740> be<00:05:33.860> future

00:05:34.179 --> 00:05:34.189 
connections and they'll be future

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:35.649 
connections and they'll be future
connections<00:05:34.729> when<00:05:34.909> they<00:05:34.999> get<00:05:35.150> the<00:05:35.240> McKinley

00:05:35.649 --> 00:05:35.659 
connections when they get the McKinley

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:39.189 
connections when they get the McKinley

for pedestrians and bicyclists people

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.589 
for pedestrians and bicyclists people
can<00:05:41.479> make<00:05:41.629> some<00:05:41.870> loop<00:05:42.080> routes<00:05:43.240> between<00:05:44.240> the

can make some loop routes between the
states<00:05:44.870> I<00:05:45.110> think<00:05:45.349> this<00:05:45.469> is<00:05:45.590> only<00:05:45.740> going<00:05:45.889> to<00:05:45.949> get

00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:46.039 
states I think this is only going to get

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:47.980 
states I think this is only going to get
bigger<00:05:46.189> than<00:05:46.520> I<00:05:46.699> do<00:05:46.909> too<00:05:47.210> I<00:05:47.419> do<00:05:47.599> too<00:05:47.689> I<00:05:47.870> think

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:47.990 
bigger than I do too I do too I think

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:54.390 
bigger than I do too I do too I think
we're<00:05:48.229> on<00:05:48.259> to<00:05:48.349> a<00:05:48.439> good<00:05:48.650> thing

a<00:06:20.860> retrofit<00:06:21.430> and<00:06:21.669> make<00:06:21.820> repairs<00:06:21.940> to<00:06:22.210> and<00:06:22.840> then

00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:23.199 
a retrofit and make repairs to and then

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:24.749 
a retrofit and make repairs to and then
try<00:06:23.410> to<00:06:23.440> figure<00:06:23.650> out<00:06:23.860> how<00:06:23.979> to<00:06:24.039> fit<00:06:24.460> a<00:06:24.490> bridge

00:06:24.749 --> 00:06:24.759 
try to figure out how to fit a bridge

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:27.450 
try to figure out how to fit a bridge
deck<00:06:25.000> on<00:06:25.180> here<00:06:25.889> there<00:06:26.889> was<00:06:26.979> just<00:06:27.130> a<00:06:27.190> lot<00:06:27.220> of

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:27.460 
deck on here there was just a lot of

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:28.500 
deck on here there was just a lot of
things<00:06:27.550> we<00:06:27.760> had<00:06:27.850> never<00:06:27.970> dealt<00:06:28.270> with<00:06:28.389> before

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:28.510 
things we had never dealt with before

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:31.200 
things we had never dealt with before
and<00:06:28.990> had<00:06:29.530> to<00:06:29.620> come<00:06:29.770> up<00:06:29.800> with<00:06:29.919> yeah<00:06:30.490> to<00:06:30.940> think<00:06:31.150> a

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:31.210 
and had to come up with yeah to think a

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:33.029 
and had to come up with yeah to think a
lot<00:06:31.330> about<00:06:31.510> how<00:06:31.840> we<00:06:32.289> might<00:06:32.320> deal<00:06:32.680> with<00:06:32.860> that

00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:33.039 
lot about how we might deal with that

00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:35.010 
lot about how we might deal with that
like<00:06:33.370> up<00:06:33.910> in<00:06:34.150> the<00:06:34.270> curved<00:06:34.479> portion<00:06:34.900> of<00:06:34.960> the

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:35.020 
like up in the curved portion of the

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:37.409 
like up in the curved portion of the
bridge<00:06:35.260> the<00:06:35.680> the<00:06:36.520> railroad<00:06:36.910> tracks<00:06:36.940> were

00:06:37.409 --> 00:06:37.419 
bridge the the railroad tracks were

00:06:37.419 --> 00:06:40.200 
bridge the the railroad tracks were
actually<00:06:37.949> angled<00:06:38.949> uh-huh<00:06:39.520> and<00:06:39.699> so<00:06:39.880> we<00:06:40.000> had<00:06:40.120> to

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:40.210 
actually angled uh-huh and so we had to

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:42.510 
actually angled uh-huh and so we had to
try<00:06:40.330> to<00:06:40.419> find<00:06:40.630> a<00:06:40.720> way<00:06:40.840> to<00:06:40.900> get<00:06:41.320> a<00:06:41.380> flat<00:06:42.130> bike

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:42.520 
try to find a way to get a flat bike

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.730 
try to find a way to get a flat bike
path<00:06:42.760> over<00:06:43.210> that<00:06:43.389> but<00:06:44.020> it<00:06:44.139> was<00:06:44.320> built<00:06:44.590> to

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:44.740 
path over that but it was built to

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:46.740 
path over that but it was built to
handle<00:06:44.889> trains<00:06:45.460> right<00:06:45.970> and<00:06:46.240> freight<00:06:46.539> so<00:06:46.720> I

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:46.750 
handle trains right and freight so I

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:48.600 
handle trains right and freight so I
guess<00:06:46.960> it's<00:06:46.990> so<00:06:47.590> yes<00:06:47.800> it's<00:06:48.160> very<00:06:48.220> strong

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:48.610 
guess it's so yes it's very strong

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:50.520 
guess it's so yes it's very strong
bridge<00:06:48.910> it<00:06:49.090> didn't<00:06:49.330> it<00:06:49.479> didn't<00:06:49.720> take<00:06:49.960> much<00:06:50.169> to

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:50.530 
bridge it didn't it didn't take much to

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:53.010 
bridge it didn't it didn't take much to
handle<00:06:51.370> just<00:06:51.669> some<00:06:51.940> you<00:06:52.240> know<00:06:52.300> people<00:06:52.840> and

handle just some you know people and

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:55.620

vision<00:07:11.680> is<00:07:11.979> to<00:07:12.430> long-term<00:07:12.820> have<00:07:13.090> these

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:13.270 
vision is to long-term have these

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:14.909 
vision is to long-term have these
parallel<00:07:13.720> systems<00:07:14.139> on<00:07:14.289> both<00:07:14.470> sides<00:07:14.710> of<00:07:14.830> the

00:07:14.909 --> 00:07:14.919 
parallel systems on both sides of the

00:07:14.919 --> 00:07:16.920 
parallel systems on both sides of the
river<00:07:15.099> so<00:07:15.400> you<00:07:15.430> can<00:07:15.550> do<00:07:16.210> as<00:07:16.389> much<00:07:16.599> or<00:07:16.780> as<00:07:16.840> little

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:16.930 
river so you can do as much or as little

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:19.020 
river so you can do as much or as little
as<00:07:17.349> you<00:07:17.409> want<00:07:17.560> and<00:07:17.949> have<00:07:18.130> enough<00:07:18.430> crossings

00:07:20.879 --> 00:07:20.889 
that you can get back and forth o'clock

00:07:20.889 --> 00:07:24.149 
that you can get back and forth o'clock
across<00:07:21.370> the<00:07:21.550> river<00:07:22.289> the<00:07:23.289> bike<00:07:23.470> trails<00:07:23.770> will

00:07:24.149 --> 00:07:24.159 
across the river the bike trails will

00:07:24.159 --> 00:07:26.189 
across the river the bike trails will
give<00:07:24.310> you<00:07:24.430> perspectives<00:07:25.120> of<00:07:25.270> st.<00:07:25.570> Louis<00:07:25.930> that

give you perspectives of st. Louis that

00:07:26.199 --> 00:07:28.200 
give you perspectives of st. Louis that
it's<00:07:26.409> hard<00:07:26.800> to<00:07:26.919> get<00:07:27.070> any<00:07:27.280> other<00:07:27.490> way<00:07:27.760> and<00:07:28.060> not

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:28.210 
it's hard to get any other way and not

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:30.260 
it's hard to get any other way and not
