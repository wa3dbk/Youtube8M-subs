hello<00:00:07.769> recently<00:00:08.769> our<00:00:08.860> search<00:00:09.100> of<00:00:09.130> this<00:00:09.430> car

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:09.760 
hello recently our search of this car

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.600 
hello recently our search of this car
and<00:00:10.120> I'm<00:00:10.269> getting<00:00:10.630> at<00:00:10.780> home<00:00:11.110> I<00:00:11.470> was<00:00:12.130> looking<00:00:12.460> at

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:12.610 
and I'm getting at home I was looking at

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.860 
and I'm getting at home I was looking at
the<00:00:12.849> chins<00:00:13.269> on<00:00:13.480> the<00:00:13.750> front<00:00:14.290> windows<00:00:15.330> the<00:00:16.330> front

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:16.870 
the chins on the front windows the front

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:20.070 
the chins on the front windows the front
side<00:00:17.230> windows<00:00:17.770> and<00:00:18.040> I<00:00:18.790> became<00:00:19.060> confirmed<00:00:19.630> that

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:20.080 
side windows and I became confirmed that

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.490 
side windows and I became confirmed that
it<00:00:20.350> was<00:00:20.529> over<00:00:20.920> tinting<00:00:21.340> so<00:00:22.029> in<00:00:22.330> this<00:00:22.720> video<00:00:23.230> I'm

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:23.500 
it was over tinting so in this video I'm

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.240 
it was over tinting so in this video I'm
going<00:00:23.619> to<00:00:23.680> show<00:00:23.830> you<00:00:23.890> first<00:00:24.220> of<00:00:24.490> all<00:00:24.640> how<00:00:25.480> to

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
going to show you first of all how to

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.060 
going to show you first of all how to
test<00:00:27.250> see<00:00:27.699> if<00:00:27.730> the<00:00:28.410> window<00:00:29.410> is<00:00:29.619> tuned<00:00:29.859> to<00:00:29.980> the

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:30.070 
test see if the window is tuned to the

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.519 
test see if the window is tuned to the
work<00:00:30.220> out<00:00:30.400> how<00:00:30.550> to<00:00:30.580> integrate<00:00:30.970> is<00:00:31.570> to<00:00:32.170> see<00:00:32.380> if

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:32.529 
work out how to integrate is to see if

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:35.670 
work out how to integrate is to see if
it<00:00:32.770> is<00:00:32.950> legal<00:00:33.190> or<00:00:33.520> not<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.960> then<00:00:35.140> I'll<00:00:35.290> show

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:35.680 
it is legal or not and then I'll show

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.290 
it is legal or not and then I'll show
you<00:00:35.770> how<00:00:35.920> to<00:00:35.950> remove<00:00:36.219> the<00:00:36.579> film

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.580 

okay<00:00:41.300> the<00:00:41.450> first<00:00:41.690> methods<00:00:42.079> we're<00:00:42.290> going<00:00:42.470> to

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:42.590 
okay the first methods we're going to

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.400 
okay the first methods we're going to
use<00:00:42.829> is<00:00:43.010> using<00:00:43.670> a<00:00:43.940> light<00:00:44.420> meter<00:00:44.629> like<00:00:44.960> this<00:00:44.989> one

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
use is using a light meter like this one

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.310 
use is using a light meter like this one
the<00:00:46.160> important<00:00:46.610> thing<00:00:46.790> on<00:00:46.910> this<00:00:47.059> one<00:00:47.120> is<00:00:47.540> we

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 
the important thing on this one is we

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.100 
the important thing on this one is we
put<00:00:48.530> it<00:00:48.620> on<00:00:48.770> the<00:00:49.070> window<00:00:49.540> and<00:00:50.540> we<00:00:50.629> take<00:00:50.840> a<00:00:50.870> light

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110 
put it on the window and we take a light

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.799 
put it on the window and we take a light
meter<00:00:51.379> reading<00:00:51.920> we<00:00:52.670> then<00:00:52.850> bring<00:00:53.360> the<00:00:53.600> word

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
meter reading we then bring the word

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:56.590 
meter reading we then bring the word
window<00:00:54.230> down<00:00:54.530> and<00:00:55.280> we<00:00:55.370> take<00:00:55.610> the<00:00:55.730> same<00:00:56.000> reading

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
window down and we take the same reading

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.810 
window down and we take the same reading
again<00:00:56.900> with<00:00:57.350> the<00:00:57.410> window<00:00:57.680> out<00:00:57.890> of<00:00:57.920> the<00:00:58.100> way<00:00:58.160> the

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
again with the window out of the way the

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.090 
again with the window out of the way the
ratio<00:00:59.180> between<00:00:59.329> the<00:00:59.660> two<00:00:59.690> will<00:01:00.110> give<00:01:00.320> us<00:01:00.470> how

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
ratio between the two will give us how

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.359 
ratio between the two will give us how
much<00:01:01.280> light<00:01:01.489> is<00:01:01.699> coming<00:01:02.000> between<00:01:02.120> them<00:01:02.329> so<00:01:03.369> on

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
much light is coming between them so on

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:07.840 
much light is coming between them so on
this<00:01:04.909> first<00:01:05.210> one<00:01:05.360> here<00:01:06.040> we<00:01:07.040> can<00:01:07.250> see<00:01:07.550> that<00:01:07.729> we

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
this first one here we can see that we

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:17.910 
this first one here we can see that we
have<00:01:08.090> about<00:01:08.360> 120<00:01:09.640> lumens

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:24.000 

when<00:01:18.520> the<00:01:18.640> window<00:01:18.970> is<00:01:19.470> withdrawn<00:01:20.470> we<00:01:21.250> get<00:01:23.010> 425

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.010 
when the window is withdrawn we get 425

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.820 
when the window is withdrawn we get 425
lumens<00:01:24.820> so<00:01:25.000> if<00:01:25.450> we<00:01:25.600> work<00:01:25.810> that<00:01:25.840> out<00:01:26.380> so<00:01:27.390> we<00:01:28.390> have

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:28.830 
lumens so if we work that out so we have

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:38.999 
lumens so if we work that out so we have
120<00:01:30.540> divided<00:01:31.540> by<00:01:32.250> 425<00:01:34.920> equals<00:01:36.300> 0.2<00:01:37.300> H<00:01:37.650> plus<00:01:38.650> 5

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009 
120 divided by 425 equals 0.2 H plus 5

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:44.010 
120 divided by 425 equals 0.2 H plus 5
by<00:01:39.250> 100<00:01:40.259> that's<00:01:41.259> about<00:01:41.470> 28<00:01:41.950> so<00:01:42.550> 28<00:01:43.210> sent<00:01:43.720> to<00:01:43.869> the

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
by 100 that's about 28 so 28 sent to the

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.859 
by 100 that's about 28 so 28 sent to the
light<00:01:44.200> is<00:01:44.530> coming<00:01:44.890> through<00:01:45.330> the<00:01:46.330> legal

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
light is coming through the legal

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:49.080 
light is coming through the legal
requirement<00:01:47.560> is<00:01:47.770> that<00:01:48.009> 70<00:01:48.490> percent<00:01:48.520> of<00:01:48.909> light

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
requirement is that 70 percent of light

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.810 
requirement is that 70 percent of light
comes<00:01:49.360> through<00:01:49.630> so<00:01:50.200> this<00:01:50.560> window<00:01:50.860> is<00:01:51.340> clearly

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 
comes through so this window is clearly

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.620 
comes through so this window is clearly
illegal

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.480 

okay<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.960> second<00:01:58.320> method<00:01:58.470> of<00:01:58.799> working<00:01:59.220> out

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
okay the second method of working out

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.149 
okay the second method of working out
the<00:01:59.520> sins<00:01:59.909> on<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.210> window<00:02:00.659> is<00:02:01.650> using<00:02:02.100> a

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
the sins on the window is using a

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.310 
the sins on the window is using a
standard<00:02:02.610> camera<00:02:02.850> this<00:02:03.720> is<00:02:03.869> not<00:02:04.020> going<00:02:04.140> to<00:02:04.229> be

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
standard camera this is not going to be

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.140 
standard camera this is not going to be
as<00:02:04.409> accurate<00:02:04.590> but<00:02:05.460> of<00:02:05.549> course<00:02:05.700> it's<00:02:05.909> a<00:02:05.970> piece

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150 
as accurate but of course it's a piece

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.480 
as accurate but of course it's a piece
of<00:02:06.299> kit<00:02:06.509> that<00:02:06.720> most<00:02:06.900> people<00:02:07.259> have<00:02:07.350> got<00:02:07.590> now<00:02:08.429> the

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:08.490 
of kit that most people have got now the

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.270 
of kit that most people have got now the
important<00:02:09.119> thing<00:02:09.209> is<00:02:09.569> that<00:02:09.840> I've<00:02:10.800> set<00:02:11.100> the

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
important thing is that I've set the

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.180 
important thing is that I've set the
window<00:02:11.730> set<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:12.780> camera<00:02:13.140> to<00:02:13.709> aperture

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
window set the camera to aperture

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.949 
window set the camera to aperture
priority<00:02:16.100> and<00:02:17.100> if<00:02:17.520> we<00:02:17.640> look<00:02:17.760> at<00:02:17.910> it<00:02:18.090> the

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
priority and if we look at it the

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.490 
priority and if we look at it the
shutter<00:02:19.230> speed<00:02:19.590> is<00:02:19.739> now<00:02:20.840> 140th<00:02:21.840> of<00:02:21.959> a<00:02:22.050> second

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
shutter speed is now 140th of a second

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.400 
shutter speed is now 140th of a second
not<00:02:23.310> looking<00:02:23.640> through<00:02:23.790> the<00:02:23.970> tinted<00:02:24.209> window<00:02:24.690> so

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
not looking through the tinted window so

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:34.640 
not looking through the tinted window so
when<00:02:25.830> we<00:02:25.980> retract<00:02:26.520> the<00:02:26.790> window

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.949 

okay<00:02:35.310> we<00:02:35.549> can<00:02:35.730> see<00:02:35.909> that<00:02:36.090> reading<00:02:36.450> goes<00:02:36.599> up<00:02:36.780> to

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
okay we can see that reading goes up to

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:37.970 
okay we can see that reading goes up to
one<00:02:37.170> to<00:02:37.409> five

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
one to five

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.460 
one to five
so<00:02:38.340> again<00:02:38.640> if<00:02:38.790> we<00:02:38.819> take<00:02:39.090> a<00:02:39.120> ratio<00:02:39.450> of<00:02:39.690> those<00:02:39.959> two

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
so again if we take a ratio of those two

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.729 
so again if we take a ratio of those two
we<00:02:41.220> can<00:02:41.430> work<00:02:41.580> out<00:02:41.819> exactly<00:02:42.360> what<00:02:43.200> we've<00:02:43.409> got

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
we can work out exactly what we've got

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:55.650 
we can work out exactly what we've got
so<00:02:44.730> it<00:02:45.090> was<00:02:45.269> 14<00:02:45.900> and<00:02:46.110> 1<00:02:46.500> to<00:02:46.739> 5<00:02:50.750> so<00:02:51.750> again

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:05.200 

40<00:02:57.100> divided<00:02:58.100> by<00:02:58.280> 1<00:02:58.850> to<00:02:59.120> 5<00:02:59.710> and<00:03:01.630> that's<00:03:03.070> 0.32<00:03:04.210> so

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:05.210 
40 divided by 1 to 5 and that's 0.32 so

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:08.530 
40 divided by 1 to 5 and that's 0.32 so
multiplied<00:03:05.630> by<00:03:05.840> a<00:03:05.870> hundred<00:03:07.090> that's<00:03:08.090> 32

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
multiplied by a hundred that's 32

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.740 
multiplied by a hundred that's 32
percent<00:03:09.020> so<00:03:09.380> that's<00:03:09.500> pretty<00:03:10.310> close<00:03:10.730> to<00:03:11.060> the<00:03:11.210> 28

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
percent so that's pretty close to the 28

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.200 
percent so that's pretty close to the 28
cent<00:03:12.170> that<00:03:12.350> we<00:03:12.440> got<00:03:12.650> through<00:03:13.040> using<00:03:13.790> the<00:03:14.030> light

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:14.210 
cent that we got through using the light

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.390 
cent that we got through using the light
meter<00:03:14.450> so<00:03:14.690> it's<00:03:14.840> a<00:03:14.930> good<00:03:15.170> approximate<00:03:15.860> reading

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
meter so it's a good approximate reading

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.120 
meter so it's a good approximate reading
I<00:03:16.610> clearly<00:03:17.450> it<00:03:17.570> shows<00:03:17.780> again<00:03:18.200> but<00:03:18.380> it's<00:03:18.530> very

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
I clearly it shows again but it's very

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.430 
I clearly it shows again but it's very
far<00:03:19.400> short<00:03:19.700> of<00:03:19.820> the<00:03:19.880> 70<00:03:20.450> percent<00:03:20.810> that<00:03:21.020> we<00:03:21.200> need

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
far short of the 70 percent that we need

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:32.460 
far short of the 70 percent that we need
to<00:03:22.040> the<00:03:22.160> car<00:03:22.340> to<00:03:22.520> be<00:03:22.640> legal

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.530
