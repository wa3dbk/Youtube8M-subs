00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
this NeoGraft procedure well i mean

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.660 
this NeoGraft procedure well i mean
bottom<00:02:49.200> line<00:02:49.410> is<00:02:49.950> that<00:02:49.980> there's<00:02:50.250> no<00:02:50.280> cutting

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
in tight over here take a look at the

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.630 
in tight over here take a look at the
scalpel<00:03:06.660> what<00:03:07.530> we<00:03:07.650> would<00:03:07.770> actually<00:03:07.950> do<00:03:08.340> is<00:03:08.489> we

scalpel what we would actually do is we

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.400 
scalpel what we would actually do is we
would<00:03:08.849> we<00:03:09.599> would<00:03:09.629> take

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
would we would take

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.140 
would we would take
i'm<00:03:10.500> kadia<00:03:10.740> out<00:03:11.280> of<00:03:11.430> your<00:03:11.520> head<00:03:11.730> we<00:03:12.000> would

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
i'm kadia out of your head we would

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.550 
i'm kadia out of your head we would
actually<00:03:12.240> cut<00:03:12.660> a<00:03:12.690> chunk<00:03:12.960> out<00:03:13.200> of<00:03:13.230> your<00:03:13.350> head

actually cut a chunk out of your head
and<00:03:13.590> we<00:03:13.920> would<00:03:14.070> have<00:03:14.190> to<00:03:14.280> divide<00:03:14.640> them<00:03:14.790> up<00:03:14.940> and

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
and we would have to divide them up and

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.120 
and we would have to divide them up and
then<00:03:15.570> put<00:03:15.600> them<00:03:15.840> back<00:03:15.900> in<00:03:16.260> but<00:03:16.500> the<00:03:16.590> problem<00:03:16.980> is

want to use now it's complete different
different<00:03:37.620> little<00:03:38.370> district<00:03:38.700> technology<00:03:39.360> to

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
different little district technology to

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.450 
different little district technology to
look<00:03:39.570> at<00:03:39.660> the<00:03:39.780> same<00:03:39.960> tune<00:03:40.170> okay<00:03:40.590> this<00:03:40.890> is<00:03:41.130> just

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:41.460 
look at the same tune okay this is just

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:43.850 
look at the same tune okay this is just
what<00:03:41.730> the<00:03:41.850> tip<00:03:42.180> of<00:03:42.450> our<00:03:42.720> our<00:03:43.170> device<00:03:43.620> would

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
what the tip of our our device would

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.200 
what the tip of our our device would
look<00:03:44.070> alike<00:03:44.400> because<00:03:44.550> I<00:03:44.760> couldn't<00:03:44.970> bring<00:03:45.090> the

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:45.210 
look alike because I couldn't bring the

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:46.700 
look alike because I couldn't bring the
big<00:03:45.360> device<00:03:45.630> in<00:03:45.840> today<00:03:46.080> but<00:03:46.260> this<00:03:46.380> is<00:03:46.530> like<00:03:46.680> a

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:46.710 
big device in today but this is like a

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:48.410 
big device in today but this is like a
tiny<00:03:47.070> it's<00:03:47.340> one<00:03:47.550> millimeter<00:03:47.970> around<00:03:48.240> that's

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
tiny it's one millimeter around that's

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:49.610 
tiny it's one millimeter around that's
actually<00:03:48.690> smaller<00:03:48.960> than<00:03:49.050> a<00:03:49.200> tip<00:03:49.410> of<00:03:49.560> a

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
actually smaller than a tip of a

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.500 
actually smaller than a tip of a
ballpoint<00:03:49.980> pen<00:03:50.250> and<00:03:50.520> what<00:03:51.060> we<00:03:51.180> do<00:03:51.330> this<00:03:51.450> is

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
ballpoint pen and what we do this is

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.570 
ballpoint pen and what we do this is
connected<00:03:52.110> to<00:03:52.260> a<00:03:52.290> kind<00:03:52.830> of<00:03:52.920> a<00:03:53.010> computerized

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
connected to a kind of a computerized

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.250 
connected to a kind of a computerized
device<00:03:53.970> and<00:03:54.480> what<00:03:54.600> we'll<00:03:54.750> do<00:03:54.870> is<00:03:54.960> we'll<00:03:55.080> just

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
device and what we'll do is we'll just

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260 
device and what we'll do is we'll just
punch<00:03:55.650> little<00:03:56.070> tiny<00:03:56.280> hair<00:03:56.580> follicles<00:03:57.120> out

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:57.270 
punch little tiny hair follicles out

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:00.170 
punch little tiny hair follicles out
okay<00:03:57.690> and<00:03:57.900> by<00:03:58.370> so<00:03:59.370> you<00:03:59.400> take<00:03:59.790> it<00:03:59.850> from<00:03:59.970> like<00:04:00.090> the

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
okay and by so you take it from like the

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.000 
okay and by so you take it from like the
back<00:04:00.390> up<00:04:00.720> here<00:04:00.960> and<00:04:01.140> yeah<00:04:01.290> you're<00:04:01.560> using<00:04:01.770> that

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
back up here and yeah you're using that

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.620 
back up here and yeah you're using that
