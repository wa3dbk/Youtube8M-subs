the gun so it has a safety which means

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:27.199 
the gun so it has a safety which means
it's<00:03:20.830> not<00:03:20.950> totally<00:03:21.580> cheap<00:03:22.620> mm<00:03:23.620> I<00:03:24.060> don't<00:03:25.060> know<00:03:25.299> I

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209

think<00:03:28.209> there's<00:03:28.690> I<00:03:29.700> mean<00:03:32.010> maybe<00:03:33.010> since<00:03:33.310> I<00:03:33.400> got

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580 
think there's I mean maybe since I got

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.820 
think there's I mean maybe since I got
two<00:03:33.730> of<00:03:33.880> them<00:03:34.030> i'll<00:03:34.180> have<00:03:34.299> two<00:03:34.510> magazines<00:03:35.080> and
