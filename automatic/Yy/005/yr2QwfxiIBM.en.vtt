00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:25.380
 the use and study of mathematics 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.510
 to be successful in poker either 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.460
 important is a fact but this 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.359
 mathematics is a difficult one 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.850
 mystification 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.620
 maurizio musso and di explain it to us 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:42.149
 mathematics and professor and poker e 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:44.879
 professional gis player who 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.190
 playing in the fear of applying 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.559
 math to the poster because everything 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.449
 added up is a simple mathematics a 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.329
 let's say let's say a little bit about it 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:57.270
 basic knowledge of percentages 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:01:00.239
 on the opening hands etc. 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.930
 also the math we need for 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.780
 maybe decide whether to make a call 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:09.659
 or if he has invested a certain amount 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:11.670
 place of chips in the pot is simpler 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.710
 of what one might think 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.470
 here wanting to give a very example 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.020
 simple if our opponent bets 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.130
 for example 10,000 on a plate of 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.360
 20,000 we must decide if precisely 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.549
 see suppose it will come then in the 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.960
 last 10,000 road on the plate of 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.520
 30,000 so we must more or less 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.150
 calculate to be good once up 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.680
 four therefore still have therefore not 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.060
 we need to say a knowledge 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.100
 thorough mathematics is enough 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.280
 even just a fairly easy calculation 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.619
 and quick to decide if one is found 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.020
 called or not based on the calculation of 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.420
 car is the ma of the cards that there 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.640
 they serve to close our point yes 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.560
 can do 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.630
 a very simple calculation that is 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.150
 multiply by four the number of 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.680
 classrooms when we have two roads to go 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.630
 to see then on the flop for example 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.280
 or multiply by two when 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.990
 we have only one road to see 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.850
 so for example from the tar will arrive 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.350
 this can empirically give us the 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.509
 percentages we have of closing the 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:12.050
 point making a very simple example 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.820
 if I have to close present a color 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.470
 here therefore I miss nine heads o 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.239
 calculate the cars leaving out 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.010
 clearly the austere qualities therefore in the 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.200
 In case I need to reduce that case 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.150
 let's make a very simple reasoning 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.520
 I will do a 9 for four then 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:29.330
 approximately point 36 for 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:31.850
 one hundred on the flop and one and half then the 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.140
 18 percent from turnover 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.840
 I still feel like giving advice 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.989
 always about mathematics 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.550
 here we say so for a couple of years here 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:42.470
 in the last year above all it is 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:47.209
 developed the trend a bit 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:49.220
 of players to make 2x2 and a half yields 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.620
 for maximum then mini raises that 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.959
 they also cause small blinds 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.570
 the big blinds tried to enter 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:58.610
 in the body because the wedding is good 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.860
 here we are careful because in any case not 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.290
 we must never lose sight of the fact 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.329
 that we will play the shot out of position 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.980
 and this can create several problems 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:09.799
 therefore despite sometimes the 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:12.110
 math maybe you take yourself to enter 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:14.239
 on the plate because maybe leo there are 3 a 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.900
 1 therefore good is always necessary 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:19.220
 take into account the opponent is 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:22.760
 the fact that we will then play the cost 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:24.950
 out of position so we don't say no 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.650
 never underestimate the speech of the 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:30.400
 position even if put to 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.400
 parallel to mathematics
