00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:09.860
 hello there somewhere a week after 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:13.040
 I already made this case 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:16.369
 Found on sale, too, a cover pi I already 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:20.300
 sort of talked about it but somehow not 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:23.119
 I know I use it 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.160
 somewhere 50 dollars maybe I him 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:29.240
 I'll take maybe I won't take it yet 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:34.160
 I do not know, therefore, a leather case means 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:38.500
 lined cover you cut ugly 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.500
 the seams that were half over went 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.820
 I painted 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:50.690
 black marker and smeared with such a varnish 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:54.379
 water based which is not fragile this 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:57.590
 varnish such as to say bending 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:01:00.680
 on canvas in lacquer for man lugovskiy but 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.780
 Here is such a meanwhile know how here on 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.879
 distance even i'm sitting right now on 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.670
 I see a tablet at a distance like this 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:11.260
 must have eyes so I do not see 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:13.549
 the curvature of the seams people also saw 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.170
 came to me watched time to listen 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:17.540
 what does not suit you that you go 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.619
 number in the kitchen is not the case on the other hand 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:24.590
 sort of like the screen here 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:29.720
 is blocked here blows some from 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:34.729
 scratching the bag put that put so 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:36.290
 that here and so it is well worth it 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:39.950
 do you see that the capital is literally 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:41.619
 instantly here, too, not alone 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:46.100
 no problems 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:48.399

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.079
 weeks I use it suits me 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:53.240
 everything is just fine i probably him 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:55.880
 leave I do not think to be buying new 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:02:00.619
 maybe not buy for now 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:02.509
 I know, but this suits me to everyone. 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:04.570
 Thank you for your attention. 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:06.670
 case but yes and of course it can 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.440
 I'll still make that version of the treasure 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.660

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:14.670

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.670
