real easy to work with I like not shell
it<00:00:06.720> just<00:00:07.020> is<00:00:07.170> just<00:00:07.200> fine<00:00:07.589> I<00:00:07.859> wanted<00:00:08.309> to<00:00:08.370> make<00:00:09.330> it

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
it just is just fine I wanted to make it

it just is just fine I wanted to make it
for<00:00:09.690> this<00:00:09.840> recipe<00:00:10.280> what<00:00:11.280> i<00:00:11.309> would<00:00:11.519> do<00:00:11.610> is<00:00:11.730> used

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
for this recipe what i would do is used

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.060 
for this recipe what i would do is used
by<00:00:12.000> two<00:00:12.059> packets<00:00:12.630> this<00:00:13.080> is<00:00:13.230> about<00:00:13.440> quarter<00:00:14.009> of

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
by two packets this is about quarter of

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.860 
by two packets this is about quarter of
an<00:00:14.160> ounce<00:00:14.280> per<00:00:14.549> packet<00:00:14.969> and<00:00:15.150> then<00:00:15.660> it<00:00:15.750> would

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
an ounce per packet and then it would

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.330 
an ounce per packet and then it would
just<00:00:15.960> take<00:00:16.080> this<00:00:16.470> is<00:00:16.619> what<00:00:16.800> happen<00:00:17.190> outside

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
just take this is what happen outside

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.189 
just take this is what happen outside
together<00:00:17.730> i<00:00:18.119> would<00:00:18.539> just<00:00:18.570> take<00:00:18.750> a<00:00:18.779> little<00:00:19.020> bit

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
together i would just take a little bit

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.109 
together i would just take a little bit
of<00:00:19.260> that<00:00:19.320> off<00:00:19.529> of<00:00:19.710> it<00:00:19.830> to<00:00:20.340> make<00:00:20.460> an<00:00:20.609> equivalent

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
of that off of it to make an equivalent

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.900 
of that off of it to make an equivalent
for<00:00:21.300> sheets<00:00:21.600> where<00:00:22.439> before<00:00:22.560> sheets<00:00:23.070> are<00:00:23.340> four

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
for sheets where before sheets are four

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.609 
for sheets where before sheets are four
tenths<00:00:24.210> of<00:00:24.390> an<00:00:24.510> ounce<00:00:24.660> this<00:00:24.960> is<00:00:25.109> five<00:00:25.320> tenths

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
tenths of an ounce this is five tenths

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
dilute the flavor you know I did was

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.320 
dilute the flavor you know I did was
prone<00:02:10.280> to<00:02:10.459> do<00:02:10.580> that<00:02:10.819> but<00:02:12.910> whose<00:02:13.910> lot<00:02:14.090> of<00:02:14.150> people

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
prone to do that but whose lot of people

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.750 
prone to do that but whose lot of people
would<00:02:14.420> disagree<00:02:14.510> with<00:02:14.930> me<00:02:15.519> one<00:02:16.519> thing<00:02:16.730> that

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
would disagree with me one thing that

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.570 
would disagree with me one thing that
you'll<00:02:17.060> notice<00:02:17.090> about<00:02:17.450> this<00:02:17.780> is<00:02:18.080> that<00:02:18.580> going

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
you'll notice about this is that going

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:20.280 
you'll notice about this is that going
to<00:02:19.670> put<00:02:19.850> in<00:02:19.940> play

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
to put in play

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
to put in play
actually<00:02:20.829> see<00:02:20.980> what's<00:02:21.159> going<00:02:21.459> on

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.809 

very<00:02:25.910> bright<00:02:26.239> is<00:02:26.900> really<00:02:27.230> bright<00:02:27.819> but

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
very bright is really bright but

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:30.160 
very bright is really bright but

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
into the one to a certain degree but

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.000 
into the one to a certain degree but
every<00:02:35.000> little<00:02:35.270> tiny<00:02:35.450> piece<00:02:35.780> is<00:02:36.110> starting<00:02:36.890> to
