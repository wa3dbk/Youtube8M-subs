00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
fly get the different angles really

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.270 
fly get the different angles really
versatile<00:00:50.670> I<00:00:50.820> mean<00:00:51.000> you<00:00:51.090> can<00:00:51.210> quickly<00:00:52.280> you

you check on my check out my video you
can<00:01:58.439> see<00:01:58.710> some<00:01:58.860> shots<00:01:59.070> where<00:01:59.369> I<00:01:59.399> kind<00:01:59.670> of

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
can see some shots where I kind of

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.450 
can see some shots where I kind of
slowly<00:02:00.030> pan<00:02:00.329> across<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.960> if<00:02:01.950> you<00:02:02.130> flip<00:02:02.340> the

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
slowly pan across the if you flip the

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.969 
slowly pan across the if you flip the
camera<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:03.540> recording<00:02:04.469> upside<00:02:04.740> down<00:02:04.860> the

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
camera the recording upside down the

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.839 
camera the recording upside down the
GoPro<00:02:05.159> and<00:02:05.820> you<00:02:05.880> flip<00:02:06.149> it<00:02:06.270> you<00:02:06.750> can<00:02:06.899> easily<00:02:07.849> pan

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
GoPro and you flip it you can easily pan

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.820 
GoPro and you flip it you can easily pan
across<00:02:09.149> like<00:02:09.390> that<00:02:09.420> a<00:02:09.929> lot<00:02:10.259> easier<00:02:10.289> than<00:02:10.649> doing

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
across like that a lot easier than doing

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:11.500 
across like that a lot easier than doing
like<00:02:10.950> this

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
like this

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.289 
like this
like<00:02:11.810> this<00:02:11.989> it's<00:02:12.230> gonna<00:02:12.709> be<00:02:12.769> hard<00:02:13.040> to<00:02:13.129> uh<00:02:13.310> to

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:14.299 
like this it's gonna be hard to uh to

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:16.089 
like this it's gonna be hard to uh to
hold<00:02:14.510> real<00:02:14.720> steady<00:02:15.019> so<00:02:15.260> if<00:02:15.349> you<00:02:15.439> flip<00:02:15.739> it<00:02:15.769> and

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:16.099 
hold real steady so if you flip it and

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:17.589 
hold real steady so if you flip it and
flip<00:02:16.340> the<00:02:16.489> video<00:02:16.730> recording<00:02:17.269> and<00:02:17.360> you<00:02:17.450> can

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599 
flip the video recording and you can

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:20.559 
flip the video recording and you can
just<00:02:17.720> quickly<00:02:18.040> move<00:02:19.040> along<00:02:19.280> like<00:02:19.549> that<00:02:19.579> it's

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
just quickly move along like that it's

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:22.449 
just quickly move along like that it's
great<00:02:20.840> I<00:02:20.870> got<00:02:21.079> a<00:02:21.140> lot<00:02:21.260> of<00:02:21.290> underwater<00:02:21.890> shots<00:02:22.280> in

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
it's a really really good piece of

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.479 
it's a really really good piece of
equipment<00:03:11.599> for<00:03:12.079> the<00:03:12.470> money<00:03:12.680> and<00:03:13.280> then<00:03:13.370> for

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
equipment for the money and then for

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:14.830 
equipment for the money and then for
breaks<00:03:13.730> which<00:03:14.000> I'll<00:03:14.150> probably<00:03:14.329> break<00:03:14.629> this

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
breaks which I'll probably break this

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.539 
breaks which I'll probably break this
soon<00:03:15.019> I<00:03:15.109> already<00:03:15.290> got<00:03:15.409> a<00:03:15.470> crack<00:03:16.190> in<00:03:16.370> here<00:03:16.489> at

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:16.549 
soon I already got a crack in here at

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:20.199 
soon I already got a crack in here at
the<00:03:16.639> base<00:03:16.790> of<00:03:16.819> the<00:03:17.030> GoPro<00:03:18.609> you<00:03:19.609> can't<00:03:19.819> beat<00:03:20.030> it

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
the base of the GoPro you can't beat it

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:23.670 
the base of the GoPro you can't beat it
so<00:03:20.780> buy<00:03:20.930> a<00:03:20.959> couple<00:03:21.260> of<00:03:21.379> them<00:03:21.530> have<00:03:21.739> fun<00:03:22.540> and

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
so buy a couple of them have fun and

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.250 
so buy a couple of them have fun and
that's<00:03:24.680> my<00:03:24.859> tip<00:03:25.040> of<00:03:25.069> the<00:03:25.190> day
