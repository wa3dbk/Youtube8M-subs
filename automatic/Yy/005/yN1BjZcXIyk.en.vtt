00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550 
whoever they know and I think that's why

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:11.800 
whoever they know and I think that's why
a<00:05:10.580> lot<00:05:10.730> of<00:05:10.760> us<00:05:10.910> play<00:05:11.150> Modern<00:05:11.540> Warfare<00:05:11.780> 2

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:11.810 
a lot of us play Modern Warfare 2

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:13.510 
a lot of us play Modern Warfare 2
because<00:05:12.290> it's<00:05:12.440> Call<00:05:12.650> of<00:05:12.680> Duty<00:05:13.010> instance<00:05:13.370> the

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 
because it's Call of Duty instance the

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.700 
because it's Call of Duty instance the
name<00:05:13.640> we<00:05:13.820> know<00:05:13.970> and<00:05:14.270> a<00:05:14.720> lot<00:05:15.260> of<00:05:15.290> us<00:05:15.440> fell<00:05:15.590> in

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:15.710 
name we know and a lot of us fell in

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:17.350 
name we know and a lot of us fell in
love<00:05:15.860> with<00:05:15.950> coal<00:05:16.130> duty<00:05:16.370> for<00:05:16.580> you<00:05:16.850> know<00:05:16.940> you

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 
love with coal duty for you know you

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.540 
love with coal duty for you know you
know<00:05:17.450> it<00:05:17.600> hooked<00:05:17.840> this<00:05:17.990> it<00:05:18.650> got<00:05:19.040> us<00:05:19.130> into<00:05:19.430> the

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:19.550 
know it hooked this it got us into the

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:22.630 
know it hooked this it got us into the
series<00:05:19.970> and<00:05:20.620> I<00:05:21.620> think<00:05:22.040> that's<00:05:22.370> why<00:05:22.490> I<00:05:22.520> was

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:22.640 
series and I think that's why I was

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.040 
series and I think that's why I was
still<00:05:23.030> playing<00:05:23.120> mine<00:05:23.330> warfare<00:05:23.480> 2<00:05:23.810> it's

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
still playing mine warfare 2 it's

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:25.300 
still playing mine warfare 2 it's
because<00:05:24.290> of<00:05:24.410> this<00:05:24.530> game<00:05:24.710> because<00:05:24.860> we<00:05:25.100> all<00:05:25.190> love

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:25.310 
because of this game because we all love

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.050 
because of this game because we all love
this<00:05:25.430> game<00:05:25.640> so<00:05:25.790> much<00:05:26.980> but<00:05:27.980> anyway<00:05:28.760> that's<00:05:28.940> just

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:29.060 
this game so much but anyway that's just

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.180 
this game so much but anyway that's just
my<00:05:29.240> theory<00:05:29.600> on<00:05:29.780> why<00:05:30.020> I<00:05:30.050> play<00:05:30.350> it<00:05:30.410> because<00:05:30.950> I

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.190 
my theory on why I play it because I

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:32.500 
my theory on why I play it because I
mean<00:05:31.340> if<00:05:31.430> that<00:05:31.550> game<00:05:31.760> was<00:05:31.910> a<00:05:31.940> different<00:05:32.390> game

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:32.510 
mean if that game was a different game

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:34.450 
mean if that game was a different game
and<00:05:32.840> didn't<00:05:33.320> have<00:05:33.380> the<00:05:33.440> Call<00:05:33.650> of<00:05:33.680> Duty<00:05:33.950> brand<00:05:34.220> I

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:34.460 
and didn't have the Call of Duty brand I

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.250 
and didn't have the Call of Duty brand I
would<00:05:34.730> just<00:05:34.880> be<00:05:35.000> like<00:05:35.180> it<00:05:35.540> would<00:05:35.900> be<00:05:35.990> like<00:05:36.140> how

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:36.260 
would just be like it would be like how

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.350 
would just be like it would be like how
I<00:05:36.290> played<00:05:36.560> Bioshock<00:05:37.040> when<00:05:37.700> I<00:05:37.760> played<00:05:37.940> Bioshock
