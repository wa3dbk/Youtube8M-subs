00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:08.710
 the amazing the boy with the book 

00:00:09.569 --> 00:00:12.819
 astrada 

00:00:12.819 --> 00:00:15.819
 Hahaha 

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:19.519
 Murcia 

00:00:20.239 --> 00:00:23.569
 I can understand that he likes books 

00:00:23.569 --> 00:00:26.019
 but as rent 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:27.030
 no way 

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.030
 he liked to eat them 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:34.520
 everything started by mistake one afternoon when I was distracted 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.870
 at the beginning I had many doubts 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.750
 and he only ate one word 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.150
 just for trying 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.670
 then he tried it with a complete sentence 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.670
 and after the full page raffle 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.420
 I definitely liked it 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.500
 for Wednesday 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.510
 Henry who had already eaten a whole book 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.510
 and by the end of the month I could figure it out 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.230
 there is a pull 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.220
 he loved commented we are the kind of books 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.930
 not requested dictionaries 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.080
 almanacs and atlases 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.520
 joke books 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.100
 history books 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.010
 and even math books 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.010
 but the reds were his favorites 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.340
 an incredible pace 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.740
 but the best 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.170
 the more I ate 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.100
 smarter and asia 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.400
 He ate a book about little fish and immediately knew how to feed his PC 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.900
 cited 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.470
 in a very short time he was able to solve his father's crossword puzzle and in the 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.870
 newspaper and up to now smarter than the teachers at your school 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.100
 enrique liked happy 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.610
 gl to continue well could well become the smartest person in the 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:53.650
 world 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.500
 so he kept eating liters and he's getting more watched 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.330
 hilda solÃ­s 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.290
 he went from eating a whole book to eating two or three in one fell swoop 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.200
 books about anything 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.909
 it was not business 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:10.319
 and I wanted to know everything 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.319
 but things then started to get complicated 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:17.049
 rather they started to get in very 

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:20.159
 very good very bad 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:24.279
 enrique ate too much and certainly too fast 

00:02:24.279 --> 00:02:26.859
 I was beginning to feel a little sick 

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:29.079
 but that was not what I 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:33.219
 everything he was learning turned into a mess because he did not have time to 

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:34.499
 make good digestion 

00:02:34.499 --> 00:02:37.769
 keita felt ashamed to have to open her mouth 

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:43.199
 Enrique suddenly did not seem so smart 

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:46.199
 more than one he advised that they no longer eat 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:51.349
 He said he can eat books and he was sad for a long time in his room 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:53.529
 sinister kiva 

00:02:53.529 --> 00:02:59.029
 more then almost by accident enrique took inside a half-eaten book 

00:02:59.029 --> 00:03:01.559
 but instead of taking it to the mouth 

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:03.999
 and started reading 

00:03:03.999 --> 00:03:07.509
 after that he discovered enrique that he liked to read a lot 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:14.039
 I could still be the smartest person in the world 

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:17.039
 although I would need more time 

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:20.529
 now enrique is always reading 

00:03:20.529 --> 00:03:21.889
 although the truth 

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:24.889
 occasionally 

00:03:29.279 --> 00:03:30.969
 doha an alarm
