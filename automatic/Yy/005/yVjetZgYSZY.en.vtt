them<00:01:13.590> seems<00:01:14.549> there<00:01:14.760> are<00:01:14.790> so<00:01:15.090> there's<00:01:15.240> less

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
them seems there are so there's less

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.240 
them seems there are so there's less
water<00:01:15.689> that's<00:01:16.229> going<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:16.470> get<00:01:16.590> in<00:01:16.770> it's<00:01:17.070> also

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
water that's going to get in it's also

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.679 
water that's going to get in it's also
more<00:01:17.580> comfortable<00:01:18.000> because<00:01:18.150> it's<00:01:18.360> less<00:01:18.479> so

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
more comfortable because it's less so

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.649 
more comfortable because it's less so
answer<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.140> rub<00:01:19.369> on<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.850> wrists<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.360> their

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
answer to rub on the wrists and their

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.380 
answer to rub on the wrists and their
ankles<00:01:22.049> they<00:01:22.590> have<00:01:22.740> a<00:01:22.770> tapered<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:23.520> tapered

ankles they have a tapered and tapered

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.149 
ankles they have a tapered and tapered
down<00:01:24.570> so<00:01:25.170> what<00:01:25.350> that<00:01:25.380> means<00:01:25.710> is<00:01:25.860> obviously

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
down so what that means is obviously

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.740 
down so what that means is obviously
there's<00:01:26.310> going<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.490> be<00:01:26.520> less<00:01:26.670> flushing<00:01:27.180> rather

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
there's going to be less flushing rather

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.440 
there's going to be less flushing rather
than<00:01:27.960> going<00:01:28.170> from<00:01:28.590> fat<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.130> cut<00:01:29.729> off<00:01:29.880> strap<00:01:30.329> the
