North<00:01:04.619> Carolina<00:01:05.129> now<00:01:05.820> we<00:01:05.880> do<00:01:06.119> see<00:01:06.299> that<00:01:06.330> the

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
North Carolina now we do see that the

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.240 
North Carolina now we do see that the
system<00:01:06.869> is<00:01:06.990> moving<00:01:07.200> off<00:01:07.530> in<00:01:07.680> a<00:01:07.740> northeasterly

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.580 
system is moving off in a northeasterly
fashion<00:01:08.970> it<00:01:09.330> will<00:01:09.510> continue<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:09.990> slowly<00:01:10.260> move

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
fashion it will continue to slowly move

Carolina now our biggest concern with
tropical<00:01:21.780> storm<00:01:22.020> Cristobal<00:01:22.619> will<00:01:22.860> be<00:01:22.950> some

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
tropical storm Cristobal will be some

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
throughout the coastal areas and we

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.030 
throughout the coastal areas and we
might<00:01:27.090> actually<00:01:27.270> see<00:01:27.479> waves<00:01:27.960> expanding<00:01:28.860> from

might actually see waves expanding from
seven<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.579> about<00:01:29.759> 10<00:01:30.119> feet<00:01:30.420> high<00:01:30.689> today<00:01:30.960> and

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
because of that we could see issues with

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.420 
because of that we could see issues with
some<00:01:34.229> beach<00:01:34.439> erosion<00:01:34.619> and<00:01:35.070> coastal<00:01:35.189> flooding

some beach erosion and coastal flooding

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.760 
some beach erosion and coastal flooding
especially<00:01:36.299> during<00:01:36.780> times<00:01:37.110> of<00:01:37.320> high<00:01:37.530> tide

especially during times of high tide
though<00:01:38.549> it's<00:01:38.700> also<00:01:38.880> concerned<00:01:39.390> too<00:01:39.600> for<00:01:39.780> some

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
though it's also concerned too for some

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.740 
though it's also concerned too for some
dangerous<00:01:40.439> rip<00:01:40.860> currents<00:01:41.369> so<00:01:41.970> please<00:01:42.360> think

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
dangerous rip currents so please think

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.539 
dangerous rip currents so please think
twice<00:01:42.869> before<00:01:43.259> venturing<00:01:43.619> into<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.070> water<00:01:44.369> at

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
twice before venturing into the water at

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.010 
twice before venturing into the water at
least<00:01:44.670> this<00:01:45.000> weekend<00:01:45.420> because<00:01:45.750> we're<00:01:45.899> going

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
least this weekend because we're going

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.539 
least this weekend because we're going
to<00:01:46.079> see<00:01:46.200> those<00:01:46.560> choppy<00:01:46.890> waters<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.430> rough

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
to see those choppy waters and rough

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.910 
to see those choppy waters and rough
conditions<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.240> even<00:01:48.899> a<00:01:48.990> really<00:01:49.290> experienced

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
conditions and even a really experienced

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.830 
conditions and even a really experienced
swimmer<00:01:50.340> can<00:01:50.549> see<00:01:50.759> some<00:01:50.970> serious<00:01:51.210> problems

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
swimmer can see some serious problems

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.420 
swimmer can see some serious problems
here<00:01:52.049> so<00:01:52.079> just<00:01:52.439> be<00:01:52.530> really<00:01:52.829> careful<00:01:52.979> before

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
some of these could be packing some very

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.790 
some of these could be packing some very
heavy<00:02:21.060> amounts<00:02:21.420> of<00:02:21.540> rainfall<00:02:21.780> here's<00:02:22.650> our

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
heavy amounts of rainfall here's our

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.590 
heavy amounts of rainfall here's our
forecast<00:02:23.010> track<00:02:23.580> for<00:02:23.880> Cristobal<00:02:24.450> it

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
forecast track for Cristobal it

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.180 
forecast track for Cristobal it
continues<00:02:25.020> to<00:02:25.140> move<00:02:25.260> parallel<00:02:25.620> to<00:02:25.770> the<00:02:25.950> coast

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
continues to move parallel to the coast

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.980 
continues to move parallel to the coast
early<00:02:26.430> on<00:02:27.060> next<00:02:27.360> week<00:02:27.570> though<00:02:27.750> will

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
early on next week though will

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.810 
early on next week though will
eventually<00:02:28.380> pull<00:02:28.620> away<00:02:28.800> from<00:02:29.310> the<00:02:29.430> coastline

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
eventually pull away from the coastline

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.850 
eventually pull away from the coastline
so<00:02:30.270> we<00:02:30.750> think<00:02:30.960> at<00:02:31.020> least<00:02:31.110> for<00:02:31.320> the<00:02:31.380> next<00:02:31.470> 24

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
so we think at least for the next 24

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.770 
so we think at least for the next 24
hours<00:02:32.340> your<00:02:32.880> cell<00:02:33.090> will<00:02:33.240> still<00:02:33.480> feel<00:02:33.690> the

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
hours your cell will still feel the

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:34.940 
hours your cell will still feel the
effects<00:02:34.080> with<00:02:34.230> those<00:02:34.350> dangerous<00:02:34.710> rip

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
effects with those dangerous rip

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.650 
effects with those dangerous rip
currents<00:02:35.310> but<00:02:35.730> then<00:02:35.850> gradually<00:02:36.300> things<00:02:36.510> will

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
currents but then gradually things will

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.210 
currents but then gradually things will
start<00:02:36.780> to<00:02:36.930> subside<00:02:37.080> and<00:02:37.680> those<00:02:37.770> waves<00:02:38.070> will

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
start to subside and those waves will

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.370 
start to subside and those waves will
start<00:02:38.400> to<00:02:38.490> wind<00:02:38.760> down<00:02:38.850> as<00:02:39.360> Cristobal<00:02:40.110> pulls

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
start to wind down as Cristobal pulls

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.040 
start to wind down as Cristobal pulls
away<00:02:40.650> from<00:02:40.890> the<00:02:41.220> eastern<00:02:41.670> seaboard<00:02:41.970> but<00:02:42.930> I'll

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
away from the eastern seaboard but I'll

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.450 
away from the eastern seaboard but I'll
tell<00:02:43.170> you<00:02:43.260> what<00:02:43.380> Cristobal<00:02:43.800> is<00:02:43.890> not<00:02:44.100> the<00:02:44.250> only

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
tell you what Cristobal is not the only

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.580 
tell you what Cristobal is not the only

away from the Mexican shoreline so

what meets the eye

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.440 
what meets the eye
especially<00:03:50.910> when<00:03:51.030> we're<00:03:51.150> talking<00:03:51.270> about

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
especially when we're talking about

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
coming up this morning in this hurricane

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:02.780 
coming up this morning in this hurricane
minute

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.750 

a<00:04:02.900> hurricane<00:04:03.900> can<00:04:04.140> have<00:04:04.349> an<00:04:04.469> eye<00:04:04.610> even<00:04:05.610> if<00:04:05.700> you

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
a hurricane can have an eye even if you

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.330 
a hurricane can have an eye even if you
can't<00:04:06.090> see<00:04:06.450> it<00:04:06.569> on<00:04:06.810> satellite<00:04:07.469> that's<00:04:07.890> because

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
can't see it on satellite that's because

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.729 
can't see it on satellite that's because
there<00:04:08.519> can<00:04:08.670> be<00:04:08.700> just<00:04:08.939> a<00:04:09.090> veil<00:04:09.420> of<00:04:09.540> Cirrus<00:04:10.230> that

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
there can be just a veil of Cirrus that

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:12.140 
there can be just a veil of Cirrus that
covers<00:04:11.069> the<00:04:11.250> top<00:04:11.459> of<00:04:11.700> the<00:04:11.790> eye<00:04:11.819> of<00:04:11.939> the

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
covers the top of the eye of the

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:13.759 
covers the top of the eye of the
hurricane<00:04:12.269> so<00:04:12.719> you<00:04:12.810> can't<00:04:13.049> see<00:04:13.230> underneath<00:04:13.500> it

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769 
hurricane so you can't see underneath it

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:15.800 
hurricane so you can't see underneath it
you<00:04:14.219> can<00:04:14.400> see<00:04:14.579> that<00:04:14.790> now<00:04:15.030> very<00:04:15.359> easily<00:04:15.540> with

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
you can see that now very easily with

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.539 
you can see that now very easily with
microwave<00:04:16.320> imager<00:04:16.470> so<00:04:16.739> it<00:04:17.070> can't<00:04:17.250> fool<00:04:17.489> us

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
microwave imager so it can't fool us

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:18.140 
microwave imager so it can't fool us
anymore

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
anymore

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.330 
anymore
also<00:04:18.930> the<00:04:19.049> size<00:04:19.380> of<00:04:19.650> the<00:04:19.739> eye<00:04:19.769> doesn't

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
also the size of the eye doesn't

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.610 
also the size of the eye doesn't
necessarily<00:04:20.910> correspond<00:04:21.570> to<00:04:21.959> the<00:04:22.229> strength

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
that the winds around it the thing we

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.150 
that the winds around it the thing we
can<00:04:24.570> say<00:04:24.780> is<00:04:24.900> a<00:04:24.930> very<00:04:25.050> large<00:04:25.500> eye<00:04:25.860> of<00:04:26.070> a

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
can say is a very large eye of a

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.890 
can say is a very large eye of a
hurricane<00:04:26.190> is<00:04:26.729> more<00:04:26.940> damaging<00:04:27.449> to<00:04:27.479> the<00:04:27.600> coast

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
hurricane is more damaging to the coast

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.779 
hurricane is more damaging to the coast
because<00:04:28.020> more<00:04:28.440> the<00:04:28.620> coast<00:04:28.830> feels<00:04:29.220> the

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:29.789 
because more the coast feels the

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:31.460 
because more the coast feels the
strongest<00:04:30.180> winds<00:04:30.810> in<00:04:30.960> a<00:04:30.990> hurricane

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
strongest winds in a hurricane

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.170 
strongest winds in a hurricane
the<00:04:31.800> other<00:04:32.160> interesting<00:04:32.370> thing<00:04:32.639> is<00:04:32.940> that<00:04:33.060> we

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
the other interesting thing is that we

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.450 
the other interesting thing is that we
have<00:04:33.360> an<00:04:33.479> eye<00:04:33.600> that<00:04:33.810> is<00:04:33.900> contracting<00:04:34.740> by

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
have an eye that is contracting by

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.760 
have an eye that is contracting by
getting<00:04:35.759> smaller<00:04:36.120> with<00:04:36.360> time<00:04:36.770> sometimes

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
getting smaller with time sometimes

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.350 
getting smaller with time sometimes
that's<00:04:38.039> related<00:04:38.490> to<00:04:38.520> strengthening<00:04:39.180> of<00:04:39.270> the

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
that's related to strengthening of the

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.810 
that's related to strengthening of the
hurricane<00:04:39.840> as<00:04:40.530> it<00:04:40.710> sort<00:04:40.919> of<00:04:40.949> tends<00:04:41.280> to<00:04:41.430> wind<00:04:41.639> up

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 
hurricane as it sort of tends to wind up

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.879 
hurricane as it sort of tends to wind up
much<00:04:42.000> like<00:04:42.180> an<00:04:42.330> ice<00:04:42.449> skater<00:04:42.810> that's<00:04:43.470> with

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:43.889 
much like an ice skater that's with

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:45.529 
much like an ice skater that's with
their<00:04:44.009> arms<00:04:44.550> out<00:04:44.699> when<00:04:44.910> they<00:04:45.030> pull<00:04:45.330> their<00:04:45.509> arms

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:45.539 
their arms out when they pull their arms
