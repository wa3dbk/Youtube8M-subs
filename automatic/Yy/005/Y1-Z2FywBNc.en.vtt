I feel<00:07:00.310> so<00:07:00.460> inclined<00:07:00.930> here's<00:07:01.930> the<00:07:02.110> doorway

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:02.380 
I feel so inclined here's the doorway

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:04.050 
I feel so inclined here's the doorway
that<00:07:02.500> allows<00:07:02.740> you<00:07:02.860> access<00:07:03.040> into<00:07:03.490> the<00:07:03.580> back<00:07:03.790> I

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:04.060 
that allows you access into the back I

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:05.670 
that allows you access into the back I
remember<00:07:04.870> the<00:07:04.990> whole<00:07:05.080> point<00:07:05.290> of<00:07:05.350> this<00:07:05.470> is<00:07:05.650> to

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:05.680 
remember the whole point of this is to

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:08.160 
remember the whole point of this is to
be<00:07:05.860> a<00:07:05.890> gaming<00:07:06.310> studio<00:07:06.640> and<00:07:07.150> so<00:07:07.660> the<00:07:07.750> purpose<00:07:07.960> of

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:08.170 
be a gaming studio and so the purpose of

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:12.060 
be a gaming studio and so the purpose of
this<00:07:08.320> is<00:07:08.650> to<00:07:08.890> be<00:07:09.220> able<00:07:09.340> to<00:07:10.050> game<00:07:11.070> create

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:12.070 
this is to be able to game create

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:15.030 
this is to be able to game create
content<00:07:12.610> and<00:07:12.850> do<00:07:13.750> media<00:07:14.110> creation<00:07:14.380> here<00:07:14.950> in
