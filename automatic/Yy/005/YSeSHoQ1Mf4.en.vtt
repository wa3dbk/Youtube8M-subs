washes<00:01:10.999> I<00:01:11.090> just<00:01:11.299> find<00:01:11.509> that<00:01:11.630> they're<00:01:11.810> a<00:01:11.840> little

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
washes I just find that they're a little

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.069 
washes I just find that they're a little
the<00:01:12.920> texture<00:01:13.310> is<00:01:13.399> very<00:01:13.460> thick<00:01:14.030> and<00:01:14.270> when

00:01:15.069 --> 00:01:15.079 
the texture is very thick and when

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:16.840 
the texture is very thick and when
you're<00:01:15.259> painting<00:01:15.740> something<00:01:15.950> this<00:01:16.219> small<00:01:16.490> and

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
you're painting something this small and

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.399 
you're painting something this small and
this<00:01:16.969> fine<00:01:17.270> you<00:01:17.719> want<00:01:17.869> something<00:01:18.079> that's<00:01:18.139> very

this fine you want something that's very

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:20.260 
this fine you want something that's very
thin<00:01:18.799> so<00:01:19.009> it<00:01:19.130> sinks<00:01:19.549> down<00:01:19.579> into<00:01:19.729> the<00:01:19.999> cracks

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
thin so it sinks down into the cracks

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.660 
thin so it sinks down into the cracks
and<00:01:20.509> it<00:01:20.840> doesn't<00:01:21.139> form<00:01:21.409> a<00:01:21.530> coat<00:01:21.859> over<00:01:22.249> the<00:01:22.280> flat

about<00:01:56.509> thinning<00:01:57.200> down<00:01:57.349> and<00:01:57.499> watch<00:01:57.590> if<00:01:57.709> you<00:01:57.799> do

00:01:57.849 --> 00:01:57.859 
about thinning down and watch if you do

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:59.559 
about thinning down and watch if you do
have<00:01:58.009> a<00:01:58.039> thicker<00:01:58.340> wash<00:01:58.609> set<00:01:59.179> it<00:01:59.270> down<00:01:59.299> with

00:01:59.559 --> 00:01:59.569 
have a thicker wash set it down with

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:01.569 
have a thicker wash set it down with
some<00:01:59.599> water<00:01:59.749> before<00:02:00.139> applying<00:02:00.649> it<00:02:00.889> you<00:02:01.249> can<00:02:01.459> do

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:01.579 
some water before applying it you can do

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:04.449 
some water before applying it you can do
multiple<00:02:01.909> thin<00:02:02.659> coats<00:02:03.079> as<00:02:03.740> opposed<00:02:04.189> to<00:02:04.249> one

00:02:04.449 --> 00:02:04.459 
multiple thin coats as opposed to one

multiple thin coats as opposed to one
thick<00:02:04.759> coat<00:02:04.789> and<00:02:05.240> if<00:02:05.630> you<00:02:05.719> do<00:02:05.840> one<00:02:06.200> really

00:02:06.699 --> 00:02:06.709 
thick coat and if you do one really

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:08.229 
thick coat and if you do one really
thick<00:02:06.979> coat<00:02:07.189> you're<00:02:07.399> more<00:02:07.700> likely<00:02:07.909> to<00:02:08.119> get

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 
thick coat you're more likely to get

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:10.929 
thick coat you're more likely to get
that<00:02:08.420> weird<00:02:08.599> puddly<00:02:09.170> splotchy<00:02:10.009> effect<00:02:10.579> on<00:02:10.789> the

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:16.269 
ship you can also go back especially if

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:17.850 
ship you can also go back especially if

you haven't painted a base coat on it

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:18.839 
you haven't painted a base coat on it
you're<00:02:17.980> doing<00:02:18.189> it<00:02:18.250> directly<00:02:18.489> on<00:02:18.640> the<00:02:18.730> base

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849 
you're doing it directly on the base

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:21.240 
you're doing it directly on the base
coat<00:02:19.060> take<00:02:19.720> a<00:02:19.750> little<00:02:20.049> q-tip<00:02:20.379> or<00:02:20.769> a<00:02:20.829> brush

over<00:02:24.760> the<00:02:24.849> flat<00:02:25.060> surfaces<00:02:25.689> just<00:02:26.140> after<00:02:26.500> you've

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
over the flat surfaces just after you've

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.020 
over the flat surfaces just after you've
painted<00:02:27.069> them<00:02:27.189> and<00:02:27.220> let<00:02:27.459> them<00:02:27.579> dry<00:02:27.730> just<00:02:27.790> a

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
painted them and let them dry just a

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.210 
painted them and let them dry just a
little<00:02:28.269> bit<00:02:28.420> with<00:02:29.110> the<00:02:29.319> wash<00:02:29.500> if<00:02:29.769> you've

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
little bit with the wash if you've

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.849 
little bit with the wash if you've
noticed<00:02:30.430> any<00:02:30.730> puddling<00:02:31.209> if<00:02:31.569> you<00:02:31.720> do<00:02:31.959> that<00:02:32.260> the

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:32.859 
noticed any puddling if you do that the

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:34.229 
noticed any puddling if you do that the
rubbing<00:02:33.189> alcohol<00:02:33.250> will<00:02:33.549> actually<00:02:33.819> kind<00:02:34.060> of

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
rubbing alcohol will actually kind of

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:36.059 
rubbing alcohol will actually kind of
break<00:02:34.810> down<00:02:34.840> that<00:02:35.230> color<00:02:35.500> a<00:02:35.560> little<00:02:35.709> bit<00:02:35.829> you

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
break down that color a little bit you

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:38.160 
break down that color a little bit you
can<00:02:36.250> wipe<00:02:36.549> it<00:02:36.700> off<00:02:36.849> with<00:02:37.060> the<00:02:37.180> q-tip<00:02:37.510> or<00:02:37.810> that

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
can wipe it off with the q-tip or that

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.289 
can wipe it off with the q-tip or that
brush<00:02:38.500> and<00:02:38.709> pull<00:02:39.430> some<00:02:39.700> of<00:02:39.730> that<00:02:39.849> color<00:02:40.090> off

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:40.299 
brush and pull some of that color off

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:42.059 
brush and pull some of that color off
again<00:02:40.720> lightening<00:02:41.290> that<00:02:41.439> tone<00:02:41.680> up<00:02:41.859> and

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
again lightening that tone up and

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:43.800 
again lightening that tone up and
because<00:02:43.000> it's<00:02:43.180> just<00:02:43.239> on<00:02:43.510> the<00:02:43.599> brush<00:02:43.780> and

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
because it's just on the brush and

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.509 
because it's just on the brush and
evaporates<00:02:44.379> so<00:02:44.439> quickly<00:02:44.769> it's<00:02:44.980> not<00:02:45.069> going<00:02:45.430> to

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
evaporates so quickly it's not going to

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:47.430 
evaporates so quickly it's not going to
settle<00:02:45.730> into<00:02:45.940> the<00:02:46.120> cracks<00:02:46.420> and<00:02:46.690> pull<00:02:47.200> color

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
settle into the cracks and pull color

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.619 
settle into the cracks and pull color
out<00:02:47.650> of<00:02:47.769> the<00:02:47.859> cracks<00:02:48.519> or<00:02:48.700> crevices<00:02:48.819> which<00:02:49.420> your

00:02:49.619 --> 00:02:49.629 
out of the cracks or crevices which your

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:51.839 
out of the cracks or crevices which your
washing<00:02:49.950> finally<00:02:50.950> I'm<00:02:51.040> gonna<00:02:51.099> paint<00:02:51.459> on<00:02:51.700> the

washing finally I'm gonna paint on the

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:53.879 
washing finally I'm gonna paint on the
new<00:02:51.940> cells<00:02:52.239> which<00:02:52.420> are<00:02:52.599> a<00:02:53.079> turquoise<00:02:53.409> color<00:02:53.620> so

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:53.889 
new cells which are a turquoise color so

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:55.649 
new cells which are a turquoise color so
I'm<00:02:54.010> going<00:02:54.250> to<00:02:54.280> use<00:02:54.849> Vallejo

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.009 
line right through the middle of both
those<00:03:23.919> two<00:03:24.190> sections<00:03:24.639> just<00:03:24.790> to<00:03:25.299> again<00:03:25.720> give

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
those two sections just to again give

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:27.479 
those two sections just to again give
the<00:03:26.199> appearance<00:03:26.440> of<00:03:26.709> light<00:03:27.010> coming<00:03:27.370> out<00:03:27.400> of

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
the appearance of light coming out of
