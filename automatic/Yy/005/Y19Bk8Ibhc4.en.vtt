absolutely gorgeous I have a soft spot
for<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:16.049> animation<00:01:16.770> when<00:01:17.400> you<00:01:17.490> bring<00:01:17.670> up<00:01:17.850> the

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
for the animation when you bring up the

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.580 
for the animation when you bring up the
bayonet

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
bayonet

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.440 
bayonet
it's<00:01:20.009> like<00:01:20.189> spins<00:01:20.580> it<00:01:20.759> around<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.119> wrist<00:01:21.270> I

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
it's like spins it around the wrist I

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.429 
it's like spins it around the wrist I
don't<00:01:21.600> know<00:01:21.689> if<00:01:22.110> that<00:01:22.799> is<00:01:22.830> safe<00:01:23.250> really<00:01:23.610> I<00:01:23.729> mean

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:24.439 
don't know if that is safe really I mean

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:27.440 
don't know if that is safe really I mean
me<00:01:25.439> personally<00:01:25.470> I<00:01:26.280> would<00:01:26.640> probably<00:01:26.850> not<00:01:27.180> do

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
me personally I would probably not do

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.569 
me personally I would probably not do
that<00:01:27.630> in<00:01:27.810> real<00:01:27.960> life<00:01:28.110> because<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:28.590> is<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:28.950> knife

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
that in real life because it is a knife

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.510 
that in real life because it is a knife
which<00:01:30.210> probably<00:01:30.840> is<00:01:31.110> pretty<00:01:31.380> razor<00:01:31.710> sharp<00:01:32.100> but

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
which probably is pretty razor sharp but

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.330 
which probably is pretty razor sharp but
it<00:01:33.240> is<00:01:33.450> still<00:01:33.689> something<00:01:33.990> that<00:01:34.290> I<00:01:35.040> wish<00:01:35.250> I

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
it is still something that I wish I

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.240 
it is still something that I wish I
could<00:01:35.520> do<00:01:35.670> in<00:01:36.030> real<00:01:36.270> life<00:01:36.530> also<00:01:37.530> have<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.860> the

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
could do in real life also have the the

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.640 
could do in real life also have the the
people<00:01:38.400> 250<00:01:38.790> moderate<00:01:39.119> dose<00:01:39.900> I<00:01:40.170> think<00:01:40.530> it's

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
people 250 moderate dose I think it's

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:40.969 
people 250 moderate dose I think it's
called

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
called

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.700 
called
factory<00:01:41.700> new<00:01:41.909> I<00:01:42.360> own<00:01:42.990> maybe<00:01:43.259> it's<00:01:43.439> not<00:01:43.500> that

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
when you have put in all those commands

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.170 
when you have put in all those commands
you're<00:02:22.560> gonna<00:02:22.710> put<00:02:23.010> in<00:02:23.250> this<00:02:23.670> command<00:02:23.940> because

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
you're gonna put in this command because

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.090 
you're gonna put in this command because
that<00:02:24.360> is<00:02:24.540> what<00:02:24.780> it's<00:02:25.020> gonna<00:02:25.170> make<00:02:25.410> them<00:02:25.620> save

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
that is what it's gonna make them save

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.540 
that is what it's gonna make them save
because<00:02:26.790> so<00:02:27.150> it's<00:02:27.300> viewmodel<00:02:27.840> underscore<00:02:28.830> pre

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
because so it's viewmodel underscore pre

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.020 
because so it's viewmodel underscore pre
set<00:02:30.060> pause<00:02:30.570> and<00:02:31.080> you<00:02:31.620> can<00:02:31.770> have<00:02:31.920> one<00:02:32.220> two<00:02:33.000> or

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
set pause and you can have one two or

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.060 
set pause and you can have one two or
three<00:02:33.390> which<00:02:33.990> is<00:02:34.020> basically<00:02:34.440> the<00:02:34.620> regular<00:02:34.950> one

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
three which is basically the regular one

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.750 
three which is basically the regular one
one<00:02:35.340> is<00:02:35.580> desktop<00:02:36.210> two<00:02:37.020> is<00:02:37.440> couch<00:02:38.190> I<00:02:38.490> believe

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
one is desktop two is couch I believe

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.160 
one is desktop two is couch I believe
and<00:02:38.970> three<00:02:39.660> is<00:02:40.940> classic<00:02:41.940> so<00:02:42.390> if<00:02:42.540> you<00:02:42.660> put<00:02:42.870> in<00:02:43.020> a

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
and three is classic so if you put in a

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.190 
and three is classic so if you put in a
zero<00:02:43.530> right<00:02:44.040> there<00:02:44.310> all<00:02:44.700> your<00:02:45.420> view<00:02:45.840> model

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
zero right there all your view model

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.170 
zero right there all your view model
settings<00:02:46.530> that<00:02:46.650> you<00:02:46.800> put<00:02:47.040> in<00:02:47.160> will<00:02:47.670> be<00:02:47.700> saved

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
settings that you put in will be saved

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.200 
settings that you put in will be saved
so<00:02:48.420> I<00:02:48.810> think<00:02:49.140> this<00:02:49.650> view<00:02:49.890> model<00:02:50.310> makes<00:02:50.820> it<00:02:51.000> look

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210 
so I think this view model makes it look

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:54.290 
so I think this view model makes it look
like<00:02:51.240> you're<00:02:51.630> in<00:02:51.810> a<00:02:52.140> frag<00:02:53.010> movie<00:02:53.250> I<00:02:53.580> mean<00:02:53.880> the

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
games have 90 fov which is definitely

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.370 
games have 90 fov which is definitely
very<00:03:02.400> delicious<00:03:02.790> why<00:03:03.000> do<00:03:03.060> I<00:03:03.240> want<00:03:03.570> to<00:03:03.840> kill<00:03:04.200> an
