00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
it's gonna fly so you don't need a

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.839 
it's gonna fly so you don't need a
remote<00:00:12.480> to<00:00:12.719> use<00:00:12.870> it<00:00:13.049> because<00:00:13.460> your<00:00:14.460> hand<00:00:14.700> is

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849

where<00:00:15.059> you<00:00:15.150> control<00:00:15.299> it<00:00:15.660> you<00:00:15.780> can't<00:00:16.020> make<00:00:16.199> it

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
where you control it you can't make it

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.560 
where you control it you can't make it
turn<00:00:16.680> but<00:00:17.100> you<00:00:17.580> can<00:00:17.760> make<00:00:17.910> it<00:00:18.029> go<00:00:18.060> higher<00:00:18.330> and

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
turn but you can make it go higher and

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.359 
turn but you can make it go higher and
lower<00:00:18.720> it<00:00:19.109> just<00:00:19.350> like<00:00:19.500> turns<00:00:19.740> automatically

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
lower it just like turns automatically

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:21.679 
lower it just like turns automatically
pretty<00:00:20.640> much<00:00:20.789> it<00:00:20.939> goes<00:00:21.119> from<00:00:21.300> side<00:00:21.510> to<00:00:21.539> side

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
pretty much it goes from side to side

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.259 
pretty much it goes from side to side
but<00:00:22.619> there<00:00:22.830> still<00:00:22.949> is<00:00:23.279> a<00:00:23.430> remote<00:00:23.880> because

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
but there still is a remote because

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
and then on and off switches right here

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.799 
and then on and off switches right here
