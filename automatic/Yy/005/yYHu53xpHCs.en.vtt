00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
then I go signal beam on last year's to

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.950 
then I go signal beam on last year's to
just<00:01:12.869> hopefully<00:01:13.619> KO<00:01:13.890> it<00:01:14.390> he<00:01:15.390> switches<00:01:15.630> out<00:01:15.840> his

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
also use signal being on the Gainey and

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.900 
also use signal being on the Gainey and
try<00:03:19.850> to<00:03:19.910> get<00:03:20.090> rid<00:03:20.239> of<00:03:20.269> at<00:03:20.420> first<00:03:21.010> but<00:03:22.010> so<00:03:22.400> yeah<00:03:22.610> I

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
try to get rid of at first but so yeah I

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.479 
try to get rid of at first but so yeah I
knew<00:03:23.330> like<00:03:23.660> him<00:03:24.530> and<00:03:24.709> Chad<00:03:24.860> must<00:03:25.070> have<00:03:25.160> some

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
knew like him and Chad must have some

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:27.130 
knew like him and Chad must have some
sort<00:03:25.640> of<00:03:25.730> priority<00:03:26.180> move<00:03:26.390> so<00:03:26.690> I<00:03:26.750> figured<00:03:27.050> him

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
sort of priority move so I figured him

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.009 
sort of priority move so I figured him
funny<00:03:27.320> would<00:03:27.650> go<00:03:27.860> down<00:03:28.040> this<00:03:28.250> year<00:03:28.459> regardless

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
funny would go down this year regardless

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:31.410 
funny would go down this year regardless
so<00:03:30.019> I<00:03:30.050> mean<00:03:30.560> that<00:03:30.739> was<00:03:30.890> just<00:03:31.040> kind<00:03:31.220> of

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
so I mean that was just kind of

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.210 
so I mean that was just kind of
inevitable<00:03:32.420> rarely<00:03:33.110> and<00:03:33.320> it<00:03:33.530> does<00:03:33.769> use<00:03:34.010> Mac

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
inevitable rarely and it does use Mac

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.640 
inevitable rarely and it does use Mac
punch<00:03:34.489> although<00:03:35.450> like<00:03:35.720> i<00:03:35.900> said<00:03:36.290> earlier<00:03:36.410> i<00:03:36.590> was

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
punch although like i said earlier i was

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.310 
punch although like i said earlier i was
expecting<00:03:37.070> that<00:03:37.340> fake<00:03:38.000> out<00:03:38.209> but<00:03:39.049> it<00:03:39.140> did<00:03:39.290> not

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:39.320 
expecting that fake out but it did not

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.810 
expecting that fake out but it did not
sadly<00:03:39.980> i<00:03:40.370> use<00:03:41.799> signal<00:03:42.799> beam<00:03:43.070> on<00:03:43.280> the<00:03:43.310> gain<00:03:43.610> IAM
