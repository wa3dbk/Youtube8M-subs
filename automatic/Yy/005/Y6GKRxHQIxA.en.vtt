00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:19.650
 ancient which I'm going to talk about all 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.270
 clothes in ancient greece with 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.710
 several functions that of encouraging 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.890
 people to have good hygiene of 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.230
 life 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.939
 in case that to behave decently 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.439
 because it's well known they're bad 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.840
 but also that of 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.460
 represent beauty and harmony in 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.040
 logical connection with aesthetics 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.770
 also featuring natural nudity to 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.760
 this time when I tell you that the 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.410
 people were not public 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.370
 the Greek banks garment were 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.469
 always a rectangular piece 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.879
 held at the shoulders and sometimes the 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.980
 size that we always feel an outfit 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.570
 enough between the oldest clothes is 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.850
 the back nothing so that was a piece 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.680
 rectangular woolen draped on the 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.199
 body attached to the shoulder by pins 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.070
 she had no belt the tissues 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.820
 came from the basin countries 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.109
 mediterranean and a persian 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.760
 basically for the citizens 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.470
 fortunate who could then order 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.729
 silk and other and colorful off 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.990
 unlike the poor they 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.720
 only had clothes made of linen 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.670
 or nettle plants grown locally 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.799
 always made of pretty bland colors 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.570
 as a Belgian brown or off-white we 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.100
 could go to see their association 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.439
 the gray color citizens door is 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.990
 natural for low classes and 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.150
 all colors for the richest 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.170
 it's not fair let's see the outfits 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.970
 for men and women 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.829
 they have between them really was going on 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.630
 it's held that could wear 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.670
 men like women allowing them 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.990
 so of this expected number need me 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.490
 I find it cool anyway because 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.560
 I hear in the street and here we call you 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.329
 and Juliette will not have to hold me 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.840
 of course I have no longer valid 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.180
 today 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.960
 and all the better besides short let's go back to 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.700
 our sheep 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.530
 the it held so was the shit on 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.540
 having rectangular room 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.340
 for the dow and logic levante maintained 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.990
 by a cord at the waist she was 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.880
 long for the richest or the most 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.649
 ripe and pu coast for young people 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.229
 as well as those who need mobility 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.850
 to work but still had 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.729
 differences do not believe that everything 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.360
 the world dress the same either 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:05.759
 let's start with women 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.399
 I will decide she had two outfits 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.649
 the people open a big rectangle of 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.640
 fabric yet bah yes you believe to be a 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.170
 diamond 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.120
 held by a brooch at each shoulder and 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.319
 optionally a cord to the size 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.850
 fabric is more than three quarters to 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.800
 shoulder level so to get a 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:23.370
 lapels above the chest and even 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:25.650
 up to the hips the péquenot do this 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.510
 but having the same principle but closed 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:32.040
 on the sides by seams was becoming 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:35.040
 so a normal dress that's it's just 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.240
 we see that stylists do not bother 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.980
 really a new coating 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.450
 well we'll go to where the écôtais it will be 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.770
 very well at least it makes the 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:45.570
 short naga boating and so men 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.520
 also had held the shit is 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.260
 tubular consisting of a piece of fabric 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.760
 folded on itself and closed by 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.650
 seams on the sides and on the 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.940
 shoulders and little useful it would have been loose 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.140
 more there was more at the level of 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.080
 legs and bouffant facts under the 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.850
 arm and lexomil will say a name of 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.860
 drugs form of lodgings have they 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.239
 also differentiate by the attached fabric 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.080
 only be paul left leaving a 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.150
 free place 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.830
 this garment was for those who needed 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.080
 of ease of movement as the 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.640
 javelin throwers things that one does not 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.060
 do not really notice me is that a 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:17.090
 part of the torso and uncovered 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:20.430
 would that be the sexy garment the era 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:22.290
 maybe I hear a good word 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.400
 bullshit there for the shoes that this 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.780
 Whether for men and women 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.670
 he was walking mostly barefoot and 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.560
 sometimes wear leather sandals to 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.329
 low or high laces according to people 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.650
 and of course the richest and 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:33.739
 decorated with precious stones and 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.150
 decoration in the leather it's not fair 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:38.130
 in access for they could wear 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.810
 jewelry rings to our bracelets and 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.100
 copper and bronze pendants 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.200
 basically but also in others 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.730
 metals according to social classes but 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.790
 there were also hats 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.829
 firecrackers them to protect themselves from the sun 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.570
 piles 5 that by this one 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:52.590
 I find frankly ridiculous and 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.200
 banners of all kinds for 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:58.140
 female hairstyles especially hairstyles 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.940
 just beautiful transition were 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.980
 a lot diversified for women and 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.350
 it shaped curly ripples 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.060
 mezzo often they often featured 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:07.500
 ornaments of all kinds except 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.660
 poorer who was content to canton 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.040
 simple of course and the hair was 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.930
 always tied back often 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.370
 unlike in the seventh century 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.040
 women could have long hair 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.360
 or go up thanks to the banners 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.960
 men liked them well 

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:23.970
 loops and to have them it was me 

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:26.370
 of the scented euce on the hair and the 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.930
 beard all those too cute me I'm 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:31.950
 sure that we would have said fathers christmas 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:33.090
 what finally here are the major axes were 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:35.010
 adopted so well them 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.540
 but it was very simple because he had to 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:39.210
 represent beauty and harmony 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:40.590
 very important notion at that time there 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.510
 choose the Greeks who do not have the Romans 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.890
 because these have instead resumed if the 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:45.390
 Greek to model them with their sauce 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.790
 as they did for many others 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:50.430
 things besides here I hope that 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:52.020
 this video pleased you do not hesitate 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.690
 as usual to share it she has 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.280
 commented halak and that would really make me 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:58.650
 pleasure and it would help me a lot 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.300
 improve myself and I find myself at very 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:03.260
 soon for a new video 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.260
 bailly 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.610
 aso
