00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.269
 and 

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:15.800
 Oh, what are you all doing, here we are in 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:18.200
 a new destination video in this video 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.570
 I will show you how to find the five 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.190
 golden chests that are on the moon if 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.110
 you have not got all five of the earth 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:26.570
 down in the description is going to be a 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.340
 video in which I show you and the 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.380
 We got long climb from the 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.960
 alpha but well that does not matter we're going to 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.390
 start so the first golden chest 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.810
 of the moon we can find it in the way 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.280
 pattern or scan mode 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.989
 and basically it 's one that we can 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.760
 find from any other way but 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:44.360
 this is the easiest way to get there 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.650
 to the 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.560
 Here I will show you all the 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:51.260
 trajectory to get to this golden 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.130
 chest or this golden chest is extremely 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.470
 easy 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.690
 you can simply ignore all 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.880
 monsters or all the beasts that you 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.710
 They are attacking you just need to 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.530
 follow the path that I am showing you 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.119
 in the video and it's one of the most basic 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.820
 easier to find you do not have to 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:10.310
 attack absolutely nobody nor have you 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.409
 that any damage can say the 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.020
 killing if you want but well that's not 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:16.860
 my case and well the next chest 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.510
 is found in 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.540
 the world is serious so it's called the 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:24.060
 mission and I have my destiny in English 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:26.910
 but it's for level 7 that created the second 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.100
 good mission is pretty easy 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.750
 I'm just putting him here from 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.190
 that we entered the temple in fact this 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.380
 I can find it in many 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.479
 missions not just in this one and just 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.430
 we have to follow this river or this 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:43.070
 water trail and it will take us to 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.070
 our second golden chest of the moon 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:52.000
 the third che is golden is in 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.970
 the same mission right in the same 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.010
 mission that had already mentioned them 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.780
 second chest should simply 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.750
 follow the instructions of the mission and 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.250
 will take them to the end here the 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.740
 I'm putting from a part where 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.420
 can be located more or less I'm going to 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.970
 be here killing the monsters because 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.830
 I really can not say 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.320
 ignore them when they are very close to me 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.670
 It gives me forward so I despair 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.760
 you can just go out 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.490
 running if it's what they're looking for if 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.780
 all they are looking for is the chest 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.130
 you can just run out this 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.350
 it's the room where we 're going to 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.870
 find the fact this che I already 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.670
 I had found what I found before 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.620
 to see everything simply with was 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.820
 doing the mission I told myself because it's very 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.250
 easy to find is nothing 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:37.320
 hidden 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.180
 here I will show you more or less the 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.100
 Where should I be? 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.680
 I already grabbed it like I said there 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:46.020
 right there is no doubt 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:49.490
 there should be so good if not 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.490
 you have found him, see him 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:55.880
 the fourth is golden of the moon it 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.830
 found in strike mode is 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.900
 basically until the end until the 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:03.620
 third forest is that mother that's 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:06.200
 huge we keep chained and just 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:09.680
 you must go to the last zone until 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.540
 the final part of the map and there we go to 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.360
 see in cheste is very easy to 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:17.420
 find if you're looking to finish the 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.610
 strike simply ends up kill it if not 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:23.110
 you can just retire and let 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.110
 your peers who fight it 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:28.080
 and well the fifth and last one is 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.570
 golden is found in the temple of 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.640
 crota that is basically this is the 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:34.440
 entrance to the temple of chalk I go to 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.780
 be killing the monsters like now 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.970
 I told them if you want you can 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.590
 just run go run not you 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.260
 they are going to kill it is very difficult to kill you 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:47.100
 but let's say that I despair 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:49.710
 something having to be was getting hurt 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:51.390
 and me running so it's good for 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:52.890
 get to the temple of chalk you can 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.590
 use any of the latest 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:58.020
 missions or even from the mode 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.240
 exploration can be reached simply 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:02.580
 you should look at the map that the temple 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.860
 short is one of the below and 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:07.160
 it exists a little more hidden in 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:09.780
 I will show you a few moments 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:12.120
 basically this is one of the sets that 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.920
 they are more hidden on the moon and of 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.530
 made the most hidden that I have 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.120
 found in every destination is in that 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.560
 platform that I just showed them nothing 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.540
 more than there is the fog did not let us 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.330
 appreciate it well there is there mere 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:26.790
 they just have to jump and wait 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.849
 drop in there is the chef and just what 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:32.789
 they take and they already have their five golden chefs 

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:34.979
 of the moon 25 golden chests of the moon 

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:36.419
 I hope you liked the video if 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:38.429
