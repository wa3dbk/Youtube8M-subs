made<00:00:12.660> me<00:00:12.900> a<00:00:12.929> strike<00:00:13.410> as<00:00:13.710> always<00:00:14.190> to<00:00:14.880> be<00:00:15.120> it<00:00:15.240> cam

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
made me a strike as always to be it cam

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.950 
made me a strike as always to be it cam
and<00:00:15.839> it's<00:00:16.529> a<00:00:16.740> long<00:00:16.980> shot<00:00:17.279> in<00:00:17.580> net<00:00:18.029> this<00:00:18.810> is

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
and it's a long shot in net this is

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.750 
and it's a long shot in net this is
going<00:00:19.140> to<00:00:19.230> be<00:00:19.350> a<00:00:19.380> really<00:00:19.830> good<00:00:20.340> division

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
going to be a really good division

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.310 
going to be a really good division
hopefully<00:00:21.240> we<00:00:21.420> will<00:00:21.539> get<00:00:21.689> intuition<00:00:22.140> for

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
hopefully we will get intuition for

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.980 
hopefully we will get intuition for
really<00:00:22.740> fast<00:00:23.010> and<00:00:23.250> hopefully<00:00:24.090> division<00:00:24.720> 1

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
really fast and hopefully division 1

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.679 
really fast and hopefully division 1
will<00:00:25.320> be<00:00:25.500> soon<00:00:25.740> ish<00:00:26.130> so<00:00:26.910> anyway<00:00:27.150> we<00:00:27.269> started

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
will be soon ish so anyway we started

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.359 
will be soon ish so anyway we started
here<00:00:27.869> in<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.109> 32nd<00:00:28.769> minute<00:00:28.859> here<00:00:29.070> nothing

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
here in the 32nd minute here nothing

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.700 
here in the 32nd minute here nothing
really<00:00:29.580> happens<00:00:29.939> at<00:00:30.060> this<00:00:30.240> point<00:00:30.510> until<00:00:31.470> here

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
really happens at this point until here

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.680 
really happens at this point until here
these<00:00:32.040> guys<00:00:32.099> have<00:00:32.669> deflections<00:00:33.329> after

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
these guys have deflections after

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.290 
these guys have deflections after
deflection<00:00:34.350> and<00:00:34.530> cullen<00:00:35.160> pushes<00:00:35.460> out<00:00:35.700> really

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
deflection and cullen pushes out really

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.420 
deflection and cullen pushes out really
weirdly<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:36.989> they<00:00:37.530> get<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:37.739> lookie<00:00:38.160> header

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
weirdly and they get a lookie header

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.490 
weirdly and they get a lookie header
which<00:00:38.969> they<00:00:39.180> just<00:00:39.210> plant<00:00:39.989> in<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.230> top

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
which they just plant in the top

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.319 
which they just plant in the top
left-hand<00:00:40.770> corner<00:00:40.890> where<00:00:41.430> caleb<00:00:41.820> is<00:00:41.879> nowhere

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
left-hand corner where caleb is nowhere

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.690

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.860 
our think you're just messing around a
bit<00:00:46.559> which<00:00:47.280> cost<00:00:47.579> us<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:47.789> goal<00:00:47.940> which<00:00:48.629> isn't

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
bit which cost us a goal which isn't

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729

steroids<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:30.450> we<00:01:30.540> can't<00:01:30.810> stop<00:01:31.140> them<00:01:31.350> in<00:01:31.829> the

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
steroids and we can't stop them in the

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.069 
steroids and we can't stop them in the
51st<00:01:32.400> minute<00:01:32.670> here<00:01:32.970> now<00:01:33.240> into<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.750> second

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
51st minute here now into the second

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.170 
51st minute here now into the second
half<00:01:34.140> I've<00:01:34.770> got<00:01:35.100> chance<00:01:35.340> it<00:01:35.579> I<00:01:35.700> should<00:01:35.970> run<00:01:36.119> a

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
half I've got chance it I should run a

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.550 
half I've got chance it I should run a
through<00:01:36.780> OB<00:01:37.140> that's<00:01:37.380> what<00:01:37.470> i<00:01:37.500> meant

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
through OB that's what i meant

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.429 
through OB that's what i meant
to<00:01:37.829> do<00:01:38.040> but<00:01:38.820> instead<00:01:39.090> my<00:01:39.299> guy<00:01:39.659> decided<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.320> do<00:01:40.409> a
