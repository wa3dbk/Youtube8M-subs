00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
well obviously worm infections are quite

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.970 
well obviously worm infections are quite
important<00:00:03.090> in<00:00:03.149> pets<00:00:03.419> and<00:00:03.750> we<00:00:04.440> see<00:00:04.680> two

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
important in pets and we see two

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.309 
important in pets and we see two
particular<00:00:05.400> types<00:00:05.879> of<00:00:06.120> worms<00:00:06.359> one<00:00:07.080> of<00:00:07.200> which

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
particular types of worms one of which

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:08.690 
particular types of worms one of which
is<00:00:07.350> round<00:00:07.740> worms<00:00:08.040> which<00:00:08.309> look<00:00:08.490> a<00:00:08.550> bit<00:00:08.670> like

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700

now<00:00:11.580> round<00:00:12.269> worms<00:00:12.570> in<00:00:12.780> particular<00:00:13.110> why

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
now round worms in particular why

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.010 
now round worms in particular why
they're<00:00:14.040> important<00:00:14.639> is<00:00:14.759> that<00:00:14.820> actually<00:00:15.540> in

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
they're important is that actually in

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.470 
they're important is that actually in
docs<00:00:16.470> for<00:00:16.800> instance<00:00:17.190> the<00:00:17.430> little<00:00:17.699> eggs<00:00:17.970> can<00:00:18.270> go

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
docs for instance the little eggs can go

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.830 
docs for instance the little eggs can go
into<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.900> soil<00:00:19.109> and<00:00:19.580> unfortunately<00:00:20.580> if<00:00:21.150> say

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
into the soil and unfortunately if say

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.140 
into the soil and unfortunately if say
we're<00:00:22.050> grooming<00:00:22.500> every<00:00:22.619> you<00:00:22.890> know<00:00:23.150> striking

for<00:00:49.469> round<00:00:49.620> worms<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.309> tapeworms<00:00:50.550> there<00:00:50.969> are

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
for round worms and tapeworms there are

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.420 
for round worms and tapeworms there are
different<00:00:51.600> preparations<00:00:52.379> that<00:00:52.530> you<00:00:53.160> use<00:00:53.399> for

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
different preparations that you use for

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.580 
different preparations that you use for
those<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:54.090> that's<00:00:54.210> why<00:00:54.390> again<00:00:54.660> you<00:00:55.230> have<00:00:55.410> to

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
those and that's why again you have to

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.279 
those and that's why again you have to
know<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.800> bit<00:00:55.890> about<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.579> life<00:00:56.789> cycle<00:00:57.420> of<00:00:57.449> the

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
know a bit about the life cycle of the

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.680 
know a bit about the life cycle of the
worm<00:00:59.219> itself<00:00:59.879> so<00:01:00.120> that<00:01:00.149> you<00:01:00.329> know<00:01:00.449> which

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
worm itself so that you know which

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.049 
worm itself so that you know which
treatment<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.620> use<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.640> other<00:01:02.730> one<00:01:02.910> that's

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
treatment to use the other one that's

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.109 
treatment to use the other one that's
particularly<00:01:03.629> important<00:01:04.110> is<00:01:04.430> tapeworms<00:01:05.430> for

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
particularly important is tapeworms for

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.820 
particularly important is tapeworms for
the<00:01:06.210> tape<00:01:06.360> I<00:01:06.600> was<00:01:06.630> actually<00:01:07.020> integrally

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
the tape I was actually integrally

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.030 
the tape I was actually integrally
linked<00:01:08.340> with<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.540> flea<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:10.470> say<00:01:10.740> if<00:01:10.920> a

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
linked with the the flea and say if a

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.039 
linked with the the flea and say if a
flea<00:01:11.369> actually<00:01:11.970> gets<00:01:12.150> infested<00:01:12.510> with<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:12.840> bit

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
flea actually gets infested with a bit

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.920 
flea actually gets infested with a bit
of<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.290> tapeworm<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:14.490> cat<00:01:14.790> or<00:01:15.119> dog<00:01:15.180> eats<00:01:15.720> the

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
of the tapeworm the cat or dog eats the

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.899 
of the tapeworm the cat or dog eats the
flea<00:01:16.200> when<00:01:16.530> they're<00:01:16.710> grooming<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.640> then<00:01:17.759> they

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
flea when they're grooming and then they

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.060 
flea when they're grooming and then they
get<00:01:18.060> tapeworms<00:01:18.540> so<00:01:18.720> it's<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:18.960> whole<00:01:19.229> sort<00:01:19.950> of

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
get tapeworms so it's a whole sort of

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.580 
get tapeworms so it's a whole sort of
look<00:01:20.670> at<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.909> whole<00:01:21.180> lifecycle<00:01:21.869> of<00:01:22.380> these

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
look at the whole lifecycle of these

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.460 
look at the whole lifecycle of these
particular<00:01:23.040> animals<00:01:23.820> I<00:01:24.229> think<00:01:25.229> what's

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
particular animals I think what's

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.670 
particular animals I think what's
important<00:01:26.159> is<00:01:26.509> you<00:01:27.509> consider<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.200> science

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
important is you consider the science

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.740 
important is you consider the science
you<00:01:29.189> work<00:01:29.430> out<00:01:29.579> what<00:01:29.790> treatment<00:01:30.329> you<00:01:30.390> want<00:01:30.600> to

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
you work out what treatment you want to

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.960 
you work out what treatment you want to
use<00:01:31.020> you<00:01:31.560> have<00:01:31.710> to<00:01:31.829> consider<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.280> lifecycle

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
use you have to consider the lifecycle

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.179 
use you have to consider the lifecycle
of<00:01:33.299> that<00:01:33.600> animal<00:01:33.990> how<00:01:34.470> it<00:01:34.590> can<00:01:34.740> affect<00:01:34.860> the

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
of that animal how it can affect the

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.520 
of that animal how it can affect the
pets<00:01:35.430> for<00:01:35.729> instance<00:01:36.090> with<00:01:36.270> rabbits<00:01:36.750> please

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
pets for instance with rabbits please

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.810 
pets for instance with rabbits please
are<00:01:37.740> linked<00:01:38.040> as<00:01:38.159> well<00:01:38.340> with<00:01:38.490> myxomatosis

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
are linked as well with myxomatosis

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.300 
are linked as well with myxomatosis
which<00:01:39.810> can<00:01:40.020> be<00:01:40.110> prevented<00:01:40.619> by<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:40.829> vaccination

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
which can be prevented by a vaccination

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.580 
which can be prevented by a vaccination
so<00:01:42.090> you've<00:01:42.180> got<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.329> whole<00:01:42.600> sort<00:01:42.899> of<00:01:42.990> mishmash

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
so you've got a whole sort of mishmash

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.219 
so you've got a whole sort of mishmash
of<00:01:43.860> things<00:01:44.460> that<00:01:44.670> you<00:01:44.850> have<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.229> understand

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
of things that you have to understand

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.230 
of things that you have to understand
and<00:01:47.009> when<00:01:47.159> you<00:01:47.250> see<00:01:47.460> a<00:01:47.490> thing<00:01:47.759> that<00:01:47.790> could<00:01:48.119> have
