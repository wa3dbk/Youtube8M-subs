millivolts and the temperature in
degrees<00:01:45.140> Celsius<00:01:47.980> now<00:01:48.980> let's<00:01:49.190> go<00:01:49.370> ahead<00:01:49.520> and

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:49.940 
degrees Celsius now let's go ahead and

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.810 
degrees Celsius now let's go ahead and
take<00:01:50.210> a<00:01:50.240> measurement<00:01:50.890> the<00:01:51.890> meter<00:01:52.130> is<00:01:52.340> factory

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
take a measurement the meter is factory

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.880 
take a measurement the meter is factory
calibrated<00:01:53.390> so<00:01:53.960> there<00:01:54.110> is<00:01:54.230> no<00:01:54.470> need<00:01:54.710> to

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
calibrated so there is no need to

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.270 
calibrated so there is no need to
calibrate<00:01:55.130> before<00:01:55.970> taking<00:01:56.330> your<00:01:56.360> measurement

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
calibrate before taking your measurement

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.260 
calibrate before taking your measurement
so<00:01:58.280> then<00:01:58.930> simply<00:01:59.930> submerge<00:02:00.790> your<00:02:01.790> electrode

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
so then simply submerge your electrode

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.810 
so then simply submerge your electrode
in<00:02:02.540> the<00:02:02.600> water<00:02:03.050> while<00:02:03.950> stirring<00:02:04.220> gently<00:02:06.820> once

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
in the water while stirring gently once

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.940

corner disappears the measurement is

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.560 
corner disappears the measurement is
finished<00:02:15.370> you<00:02:16.370> can<00:02:16.520> freeze<00:02:16.850> the<00:02:17.120> millivolt

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570
