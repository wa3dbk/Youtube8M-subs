00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:11.280
 from here we can monitor control 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.719
 see and check minute by minute where 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.360
 find all the subways that go by 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.790
 down from our city in July of 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.849
 2004 this operation started 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:23.400
 center equipped with latest technology 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:25.320
 generation where all the 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.109
 information for daily operation 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.270
 of the subway service we can see to what 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.320
 speed is going every train control 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.320
 the speed of the trains 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.200
 and if any train tries to overtake it 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.780
 that maximum speed that we have 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.940
 established automatically stops and 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.230
 we hear an alarm on the pc or idea that 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.160
 we will do the checks to see what is it 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:51.019
 what is happening the psoe allows 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.990
 unify traffic control in 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:56.750
 Real time of all lines 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:58.250
 here we see bird lines to be all the 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.890
 lines that make up our network of 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.810
 subtes and we see exactly where is 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.699
 each train how is it moving and if 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:08.950
 have some inconvenience 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:12.070
 metrovias installed in the abi lines 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:15.009
 a new signaling system called atp 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:17.500
 which meant a significant investment 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:20.829
 in technological matters this we are 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.929
 watching now is the line from up here 

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:25.689
 we see the names of each of the 

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:29.229
 stations on each platform you will see 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:31.689
 a red circle in many cases and green 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:34.149
 in other cases they are like traffic lights 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:36.960
 the street they tell the driver of 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:40.250
 train can be advanced or not 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.020
 the atp automatic train protection 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.330
 means a remarkable breakthrough in the 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.460
 modernization of the subway that allows 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.159
 improve reliability and regularity 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.020
 of the service and at the same time expedite 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.120
 the information processes and 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.950
 communication between operational areas 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:01.250
 are those red segments that you see 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:03.410
 there circulating along the lines that are going 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:06.110
 moving online with what is happening 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:09.740
 really on the ground below that 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:12.830
 red segment there is a number or above that 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.990
 indicates what train number is in that 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.540
 formation at that time you will see 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:20.030
 that when a train for example here is 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.940
 It arriving at a station is painted 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.860
 yellow the stretch of track forward 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.350
 and a speed that is going 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.930
 being centimeter centimeter 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:32.510
 by the system if the driver will try 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.640
 go over that speed automatically 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:38.320
 the training will stop and it will sound 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.320
 alarm in the train and in our price 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:46.010
 ambulance emergencies 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:50.000
 the PSOE also has a guard 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:52.100
 emergencies a fire station 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.380
 for example very common thing in this era 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.510
 of the year of summer some person 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.700
 decomposed above the train yes 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.710
 automatically the supervisor finds out 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.020
 by the driver's call and he 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:04.520
 Quickly warns the person who 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.620
 we have in our emergency guard 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.480
 that communicates via direct is a 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.300
 red phone let's say a point telephone 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.610
 to the point with the same that allows the 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.740
 same quickly tell you good in 78 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:18.890
 minutes I have is the ambulance in such 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:20.900
 place in this pc or is it found let's say 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.600
 concatenated all the information 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:27.440
 needed to be able to provide a service 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:29.480
 to excellence and solve the problems 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.850
 that exist of course that there is going to 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.160
 continue to exist but fix them 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.780
 quickest possible that's why we put all 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.370
 the information in this good place 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.730
 our little great pride in 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.730
 metroways 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.900
 Hello 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.860
 ah
