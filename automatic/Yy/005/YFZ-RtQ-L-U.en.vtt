00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.050
 can be said even for editing 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.300
 photos because it can not draw 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.530
 you cannot use 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.350
 pencil or habitual system and 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.480
 so on only edit 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.460
 Photo

 the third is just cooks 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.680
 interesting feature 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.790
 is that you can turn 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.490

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:43.070
 second point 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.070
 this is so contrast 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.460

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:59.430
 no meetings just doing 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.840

 add soft focus 

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:21.249
 or vice versa add 

00:02:21.249 --> 00:02:24.479
 image sharpness 

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:26.979
 The last menu item contains the press 

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:29.399
 two categories of Kiev finished defects 

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:30.889
 which you can immediately impose on 

00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:31.869
 picture 

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:34.869
 and this is the frame r

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:49.909
 operations 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:52.279
 despite the fact that this is the forest on the version 

00:02:52.279 --> 00:02:54.939
 its colors but the progenitor of photoshop for 

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:57.229
 iptv is saturated with more than enough 

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:58.899
 number of functions

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:32.459
 me subcategories 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.459
 For example, if so short and the amount 

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:38.999

 what would just transfer ward 

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:18.870
 profit section is extremely simple 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.000
 projected profit 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.579

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:39.219
 these categories and subcategories are quick 

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:41.330
 development 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.330
 the section considering contains information about

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.870
 creditors 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.749

 heightened situation chart 

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:31.449
 summing up I will say that this program 

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:33.300
 became one of the bottom 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:34.999

00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:41.080
 quite simple 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.080
 and this is boxing unity 

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:47.039
 simply put less chance 

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:50.039
