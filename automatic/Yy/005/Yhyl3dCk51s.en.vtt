00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:14.030
 a chicken in barbecue sauce baked 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:19.000

 lose how delicious this recipe is 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.930
 alright then to make our chicken to 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:28.720
 the bale with sauce the baked barbecue 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:31.810
 they need a tray 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:34.300
 something they have can put paper 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.220
 of aluminum in any other pan that 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.220
 want to use your chicken in this case I will 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:41.000
 use legs 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:44.130
 or many tell you in some places 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.940
 for the barbie sauce we were going to 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:49.410
 use ketchup or butter butter which 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.340
 we have to melt now I'm going to 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.590
 show the soy sauce procedure 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:57.600
 I have here a mixture of paprika with salt 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.960
 also a little oregano to give 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.660
 a smoky touch I have brown sugar 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.570
 I have mustard and I have a little bit of 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.450
 apple cider vinegar 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.710
 Now let's place our chicken and 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:17.790
 this tray my chicken is already seasoned 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:20.570
 with salt and garlic people like 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:24.330
 normally they would do it for any 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:28.170
 another recipe because you have to give it more 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:31.260
 taste to everything that is not just the sauce 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:35.530
 neighborhood of course 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:39.690
 well now they will not be 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:41.830
 pretty that is heated to simmer 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.860
 make sure it 's simmering 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:47.290
 let's add the butter 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:50.670
 and we're going to expect the butter to 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.670
 start repeating a bit 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.760
 to not add the other ingredients 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:10.229
 pour our butter while 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.229
 so much are we going to add the spices 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:21.480
 and we add the spices we are going to add 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.480
 Chinese soy sauce 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:32.310
 good more in fire well low 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.310
 add the cheese 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.240
 iberia also add mustard 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:45.600
 Make sure that the game is very 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.720
 slow 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:53.220
 because the idea is not exactly to cook 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:57.920
 this but so that everything looks good 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.920
 incorporated now we come the 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.620
 and finally 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:13.440
 to move it and wait for the sugar to 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:18.060
 unlink 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:20.950
 and go pick up a little darker color 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:23.190
 and then I'll show you the next 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.530
 He passed 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.900
 As you can see, I 'm starting to have a 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:33.510
 colored highlights and may be attached 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:35.460
 well it 's a darker color I'm going to 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.600
 leave it for a minute more 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:42.430
 here and I will keep moving 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:45.230
 without stopping because that is very important 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.500
 they keep moving and they promise a taste 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:52.480
 delicious 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:55.980
 so and so our sauce we are going to pass it 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.980
 to a more comfortable container 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.800
 and now we're going to 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:10.820
 eating all the chicken well 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:16.090
 what they should do also is this is 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:19.840
 a 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:23.080
 to combat pollution of the 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:25.000
 Raw meat can leave a little as it has 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.520
 made me in our container where it 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.400
 I was cooking putting it in another 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.040
 container like this already when the chicken is 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.169
 add more barbecue sauce 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:38.160
 so do not contaminate yourself with the meat that 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:38.160
 it was raw 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:45.840
 add it and what we are going to do is 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:48.280
 let's cook this chicken for 30 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:52.000
 one hour 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:57.110
 but in 30 minutes we're going to give him the 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:59.510
 oven and let's add more sauce 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:02.980
 of sight 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:02.980
 I'm going to show you how we're going to do it 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:12.360
 make sure you give them the sauce for everyone 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:14.879
 sides 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.639
 today where I am today is 

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:20.599
 snowing 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:25.129
 so this makes me feel like 

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:27.680
 and now summer is near our 

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:31.009
 chicken let's put it in the oven ni 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:33.169
 Discard oven warming up to 425 degrees 

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:36.740
 As I said before, we're going to 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:38.629
 put a total of one hour until 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:40.279
 your support is cooked but in more or less 

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:42.319
 half an hour let's open the oven 

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:44.860
 again and we will add more 

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:46.900
 chicken sauce 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:49.780
 Well, our chicken has more or 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:53.889
 minus one hour in the oven at 30 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:58.499
 minutes as I told them I took it out of the oven 

00:05:53.889 --> 00:06:02.430
 I put more barbell sauce now I'm 

00:05:58.499 --> 00:06:06.189
 putting a little more sauce is already 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:09.189
 the final we are going to put it again in the 

00:06:06.189 --> 00:06:11.020
 but this time we 're going to put it in 

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:14.740
 test 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:17.160
 is to give it more color and what I did 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:19.860
 it was flipping it 

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:22.110
 now I put it with the skin down 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:27.560
 to give him more sauce and for the other 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:27.560
 side can also catch color 

00:06:28.009 --> 00:06:32.839
 and then now let's worship the chicken 

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:36.490
 for about two minutes and then you 

00:06:32.839 --> 00:06:36.490
 I will show how it is 

00:06:37.289 --> 00:06:42.449
 good now our sound has just 

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:45.540
 fire alarm message that is not a bar 

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:51.680
 dress without origin the firemen 

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:58.280
 we do not reach to arrive as it was already cooked 

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:58.280
 but golden a super juicy taste 

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:05.669
 this has to be left to rest before 

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:08.280
 eat at least 10 minutes because if 

00:07:05.669 --> 00:07:09.600
 not all the juice left inside 

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:11.320
 of the flesh 

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:14.410
 it goes 

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:17.010
 so it's going to stay inside the meat 

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:20.380
 and this is supposed to be the point 

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:23.040
 we want this juice remains in the 

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:26.780
 meat for when we approach this chicken 

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:29.210
 let's feel like that 

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:31.880
 very delicious moisture and 

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:34.040
 a lot of flavor this recipe as I told you 

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:36.980
 I put it in the box 

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:40.270

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:43.610
