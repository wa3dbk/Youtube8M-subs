00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.720 
uh just two nuts one on each side and I
this<00:00:17.910> motor<00:00:18.150> is<00:00:18.300> ready<00:00:18.480> to<00:00:18.660> come<00:00:18.840> out<00:00:18.930> of<00:00:18.990> here

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:19.730 
this motor is ready to come out of here

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.429 
this motor is ready to come out of here
one<00:00:20.730> of<00:00:20.849> the<00:00:20.910> other<00:00:21.119> reasons<00:00:21.510> I<00:00:21.750> was<00:00:22.170> going<00:00:22.380> to

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
one of the other reasons I was going to

one of the other reasons I was going to
put<00:00:23.039> this<00:00:23.130> motor<00:00:23.429> in<00:00:23.580> that<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:23.760> Chevy<00:00:24.359> Cummins

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
put this motor in that a Chevy Cummins

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.929 
put this motor in that a Chevy Cummins
that<00:00:24.900> I've<00:00:24.990> been<00:00:25.080> working<00:00:25.410> on<00:00:25.500> is<00:00:26.490> because<00:00:26.910> uh

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
that I've been working on is because uh

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.060 
that I've been working on is because uh
with<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.019> other<00:00:28.140> one<00:00:28.320> having<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.589> blow<00:00:28.859> by

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
with the other one having the blow by

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.880 
with the other one having the blow by
that<00:00:29.310> it<00:00:29.429> has<00:00:29.929> not<00:00:30.929> only<00:00:30.990> does<00:00:31.410> it<00:00:31.439> help<00:00:31.619> blow

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
that it has not only does it help blow

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.310 
that it has not only does it help blow
by<00:00:32.070> coming<00:00:32.759> out<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:33.000> filler<00:00:33.240> neck<00:00:33.570> it

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
by coming out the filler neck it

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.830 
by coming out the filler neck it
actually<00:00:34.710> has<00:00:34.920> a<00:00:34.950> these<00:00:35.910> come<00:00:36.180> in<00:00:36.330> to<00:00:36.450> have<00:00:36.540> a

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
actually has a these come in to have a

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.470 
actually has a these come in to have a
blow<00:00:37.440> by<00:00:37.620> tube<00:00:37.980> there's<00:00:38.730> actually<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.120> hose

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
blow by tube there's actually a hose

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.470 
blow by tube there's actually a hose
that<00:00:39.510> goes<00:00:39.750> on<00:00:40.140> right<00:00:40.380> here<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.490> it<00:00:42.150> goes<00:00:42.270> down

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
that goes on right here and it goes down

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.520 
that goes on right here and it goes down
beside<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.900> starter

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
beside the starter

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.560 
beside the starter
well<00:00:44.130> there's<00:00:44.340> twice<00:00:44.610> as<00:00:44.880> much<00:00:45.030> blow<00:00:45.390> by

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
well there's twice as much blow by

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.750 
well there's twice as much blow by
coming<00:00:45.960> out<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.170> blow<00:00:46.380> by<00:00:46.560> tube<00:00:46.890> then<00:00:47.580> what

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
coming out the blow by tube then what

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.040 
coming out the blow by tube then what
there<00:00:47.940> is<00:00:48.060> up<00:00:48.270> there<00:00:48.420> where<00:00:48.510> you<00:00:48.630> put<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.900> oil

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
there is up there where you put the oil

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.190 
there is up there where you put the oil
in<00:00:49.290> that<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:50.570> it<00:00:51.570> goes<00:00:51.750> through<00:00:51.960> about<00:00:52.170> a

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:52.200 
in that and it goes through about a

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.250 
in that and it goes through about a
quart<00:00:52.530> of<00:00:52.620> oil<00:00:52.850> every<00:00:53.850> couple<00:00:54.180> hours<00:00:54.390> so<00:00:54.780> it's

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
quart of oil every couple hours so it's

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.560 
quart of oil every couple hours so it's
a<00:00:55.410> that<00:00:56.250> other<00:00:56.460> motors<00:00:56.820> pretty<00:00:57.390> well<00:00:57.540> shot

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
a that other motors pretty well shot

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.390 
a that other motors pretty well shot
it's<00:00:58.110> got<00:00:58.230> some<00:00:58.380> broken<00:00:58.560> rings<00:00:58.890> or<00:00:59.070> something

00:00:59.390 --> 00:00:59.400 
it's got some broken rings or something

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.130 
it's got some broken rings or something
in<00:00:59.520> it<00:00:59.670> and<00:01:00.330> I'm<00:01:00.540> going<00:01:00.660> to<00:01:00.690> show<00:01:00.840> you<00:01:00.900> guys

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
in it and I'm going to show you guys

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.650 
in it and I'm going to show you guys
what<00:01:01.470> will<00:01:01.590> happen<00:01:01.980> with<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.760> broken<00:01:03.330> rings

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
what will happen with the broken rings

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.080 
what will happen with the broken rings
in<00:01:03.900> the<00:01:03.990> Cummins<00:01:04.670> I've<00:01:05.670> been<00:01:05.850> building

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
in the Cummins I've been building

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.830 
in the Cummins I've been building
another<00:01:06.450> Cummins<00:01:06.929> for<00:01:07.079> a<00:01:07.109> friend<00:01:07.380> of<00:01:07.439> mine<00:01:07.500> and

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
another Cummins for a friend of mine and

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.510 
another Cummins for a friend of mine and
this<00:01:09.840> is<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.259> piston<00:01:10.530> that<00:01:10.859> came<00:01:11.070> out<00:01:11.219> of<00:01:11.250> his

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
this is the piston that came out of his

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.779 
this is the piston that came out of his
motor<00:01:11.789> and<00:01:12.979> anyway<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.070> same<00:01:14.310> thing<00:01:14.549> he

00:01:14.779 --> 00:01:14.789 
motor and anyway the same thing he

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:16.399 
motor and anyway the same thing he
started<00:01:15.420> off<00:01:15.539> with<00:01:15.719> just<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:15.990> little<00:01:16.020> bit<00:01:16.320> of

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
started off with just a little bit of

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.760 
started off with just a little bit of
blow<00:01:16.590> by<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.999> just<00:01:18.210> finally<00:01:18.810> got<00:01:18.960> toward

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
blow by and it just finally got toward

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.569 
blow by and it just finally got toward
was<00:01:20.700> blowing<00:01:21.119> too<00:01:21.270> much<00:01:21.539> oil<00:01:21.719> by<00:01:21.929> the<00:01:21.990> piston

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:22.579 
was blowing too much oil by the piston

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:25.219 
was blowing too much oil by the piston
and<00:01:23.579> the<00:01:23.850> Rings<00:01:24.060> gave<00:01:24.329> way<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:24.749> of<00:01:24.810> course<00:01:25.049> it

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
and the Rings gave way and of course it

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.620 
and the Rings gave way and of course it
melted<00:01:25.560> down<00:01:25.710> so<00:01:26.340> this<00:01:26.939> is<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.240> piston<00:01:27.600> that

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
melted down so this is the piston that

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.599 
melted down so this is the piston that
came<00:01:27.899> out<00:01:28.079> of<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.850> 97<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:29.939> second<00:01:30.359> gen<00:01:30.539> Cummins

00:01:31.599 --> 00:01:31.609 
came out of the 97 a second gen Cummins

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:34.039 
came out of the 97 a second gen Cummins
and<00:01:32.609> I<00:01:32.670> get<00:01:32.880> some<00:01:33.030> video<00:01:33.270> on<00:01:33.539> that<00:01:33.659> thing<00:01:33.869> once

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
and I get some video on that thing once

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.929 
and I get some video on that thing once
I<00:01:34.170> get<00:01:34.319> the<00:01:34.469> parts<00:01:35.189> back<00:01:35.369> from<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.609> machine

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
I get the parts back from the machine

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.249 
I get the parts back from the machine
shop<00:01:35.969> I'm<00:01:36.420> going<00:01:36.569> to<00:01:36.630> go<00:01:36.749> ahead<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:37.109> build

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
shop I'm going to go ahead and build

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.749 
shop I'm going to go ahead and build
that<00:01:37.409> Cummins<00:01:37.859> here<00:01:38.039> at<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.219> house<00:01:38.399> whenever

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
that Cummins here at the house whenever

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.849 
that Cummins here at the house whenever
I<00:01:38.939> get<00:01:39.869> everything<00:01:40.140> back<00:01:40.439> from<00:01:40.649> the<00:01:40.710> machine

00:01:40.849 --> 00:01:40.859 
I get everything back from the machine

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:43.609 
I get everything back from the machine
shop<00:01:41.069> for<00:01:41.520> that<00:01:41.749> but<00:01:42.749> I<00:01:42.780> just<00:01:43.049> wanted<00:01:43.289> to<00:01:43.439> show

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
shop for that but I just wanted to show

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.279 
shop for that but I just wanted to show
