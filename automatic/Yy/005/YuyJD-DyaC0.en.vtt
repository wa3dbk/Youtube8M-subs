on<00:00:40.350> your<00:00:40.469> personal<00:00:40.770> computer<00:00:40.910> I'm<00:00:41.910> going<00:00:41.969> to

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
on your personal computer I'm going to

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.000 
on your personal computer I'm going to
pull<00:00:42.329> off<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.600> top<00:00:42.809> of<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.020> box<00:00:43.230> here<00:00:43.590> so<00:00:43.620> we

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
pull off the top of the box here so we

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.619 
pull off the top of the box here so we
get<00:00:44.879> it<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.719> headset<00:00:47.149> take<00:00:48.149> a<00:00:48.180> closer<00:00:48.480> look

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
get it the headset take a closer look

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.380 
get it the headset take a closer look
you<00:00:48.960> can<00:00:49.079> see<00:00:49.230> it<00:00:49.289> comes<00:00:49.469> with<00:00:49.649> a<00:00:50.000> base<00:00:51.000> that<00:00:51.300> it

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
you can see it comes with a base that it

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.840 
you can see it comes with a base that it
can<00:00:51.510> charge<00:00:51.750> from<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:52.379> then<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.550> headset

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
can charge from and then the headset

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.819 
can charge from and then the headset
itself<00:00:54.210> will<00:00:54.600> see<00:00:54.809> how<00:00:55.199> hard<00:00:55.379> it<00:00:55.469> is<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:55.620> get

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
itself will see how hard it is to get

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.599 
itself will see how hard it is to get
this<00:00:55.949> off<00:00:58.039> try<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.100> get<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.340> out<00:00:59.430> of<00:00:59.489> here

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
this off try to get it out of here

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:00.770 
this off try to get it out of here
without<00:00:59.760> breaking<00:01:00.090> anything

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
without breaking anything

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.750 
without breaking anything
not<00:01:01.170> always<00:01:01.350> easy<00:01:04.010> okay<00:01:05.040> there<00:01:05.280> we<00:01:05.369> go

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
not always easy okay there we go

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.880 
not always easy okay there we go
there's<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.720> headset<00:01:07.080> itself<00:01:07.500> you<00:01:07.740> can<00:01:07.860> see

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
there's the headset itself you can see

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.640 
there's the headset itself you can see
it's<00:01:08.189> meant<00:01:08.700> only<00:01:08.850> for<00:01:09.150> right<00:01:09.869> ear<00:01:10.020> use<00:01:10.290> we'll

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
it's meant only for right ear use we'll

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.450 
it's meant only for right ear use we'll
take<00:01:10.799> off<00:01:10.979> this<00:01:11.479> protective<00:01:12.479> film<00:01:13.170> here<00:01:13.470> and

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
take off this protective film here and

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.560 
take off this protective film here and
see<00:01:14.580> it<00:01:14.670> smashed<00:01:15.030> up<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.330> earbud<00:01:15.750> here<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.560> bit

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
see it smashed up the earbud here a bit

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.690 
see it smashed up the earbud here a bit
it's<00:01:18.570> come<00:01:18.840> off<00:01:18.869> I<00:01:19.530> have<00:01:20.159> to<00:01:20.250> put<00:01:20.430> it<00:01:20.520> back<00:01:20.640> on

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
might not be too easy pretty simple

might not be too easy pretty simple
design<00:01:23.880> you<00:01:24.299> can<00:01:24.390> see<00:01:24.540> there's<00:01:24.720> battery

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
design you can see there's battery

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.330 
design you can see there's battery

it let's take a look at the charging
base

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:55.890 

I<00:01:53.820> can't<00:01:54.820> figure<00:01:54.970> out<00:01:55.060> how<00:01:55.180> this<00:01:55.420> is<00:01:55.600> attached

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:55.900 
I can't figure out how this is attached

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:56.630 
I can't figure out how this is attached
there<00:01:56.170> we<00:01:56.260> go

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
there we go

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.080 
there we go
pops<00:01:57.640> out<00:01:57.880> here<00:01:58.150> you<00:01:59.110> can<00:01:59.200> see<00:01:59.350> it<00:01:59.409> has<00:01:59.500> a

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
pops out here you can see it has a

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.260 
pops out here you can see it has a
cool-looking<00:02:01.090> design<00:02:02.759> everything<00:02:03.759> fits<00:02:04.090> into

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
cool-looking design everything fits into

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.570 
cool-looking design everything fits into
place<00:02:04.450> nicely<00:02:04.920> green<00:02:05.920> light<00:02:06.070> coming<00:02:06.310> on<00:02:06.400> here

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
place nicely green light coming on here

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.029 
place nicely green light coming on here
probably<00:02:06.759> indicating<00:02:07.270> that<00:02:07.299> it's<00:02:07.540> charging

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
probably indicating that it's charging

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.100 
probably indicating that it's charging
you<00:02:09.039> see<00:02:09.190> a<00:02:09.220> microUSB<00:02:09.720> port<00:02:10.720> on<00:02:10.869> the<00:02:10.929> bottom

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
at the bottom of the headset and just

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.110 
at the bottom of the headset and just
push<00:02:44.380> it<00:02:44.530> up<00:02:44.590> on<00:02:44.739> the<00:02:44.800> bottom<00:02:45.069> to<00:02:45.760> release<00:02:46.000> it

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
again set aside the headset itself for a

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.270 
again set aside the headset itself for a
minute<00:02:51.790> just<00:02:52.239> so<00:02:52.450> we<00:02:52.569> can<00:02:52.890> see<00:02:53.890> what<00:02:54.010> else<00:02:54.130> is

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
minute just so we can see what else is

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.030 
minute just so we can see what else is
in<00:02:54.400> the<00:02:54.459> box

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
in the box

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:03.330 
in the box
very<00:02:57.040> nicely<00:02:57.250> packaged<00:03:01.320> I'm<00:03:02.320> sure<00:03:02.590> what<00:03:02.920> this

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
very nicely packaged I'm sure what this

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.770 
very nicely packaged I'm sure what this
is<00:03:05.160> looks<00:03:06.160> like<00:03:06.250> it's<00:03:06.430> a<00:03:06.519> loop<00:03:06.850> for<00:03:07.090> mounting

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
is looks like it's a loop for mounting

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.000 
is looks like it's a loop for mounting
it<00:03:07.870> on<00:03:07.930> something<00:03:08.140> I'm<00:03:08.290> not<00:03:08.380> exactly<00:03:08.620> short

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
it on something I'm not exactly short

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.340 
it on something I'm not exactly short
probably<00:03:09.630> attaches<00:03:10.630> to<00:03:10.750> this<00:03:10.840> but<00:03:11.079> I<00:03:11.110> have<00:03:11.260> to

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
probably attaches to this but I have to

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.370 
probably attaches to this but I have to
read<00:03:11.530> the<00:03:11.620> directions<00:03:11.709> to<00:03:12.100> see<00:03:13.019> next<00:03:14.019> your<00:03:14.230> ear
