one of our most popular signs is what we

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.080 
one of our most popular signs is what we

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
shape and how how we make hundreds of

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.099 
shape and how how we make hundreds of
them<00:00:32.759> because<00:00:33.059> we<00:00:33.090> sell<00:00:33.480> hundreds<00:00:33.870> of<00:00:34.020> the

00:00:34.099 --> 00:00:34.109 
them because we sell hundreds of the

00:00:34.109 --> 00:00:36.860 
them because we sell hundreds of the
sign<00:00:34.469> so<00:00:34.920> this<00:00:35.550> is<00:00:35.760> what<00:00:35.969> we<00:00:36.120> do<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.510> make<00:00:36.539> this

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
sign so this is what we do to make this

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.670 
sign so this is what we do to make this
shape<00:00:37.140> we<00:00:37.890> started<00:00:38.340> off<00:00:38.870> we<00:00:39.870> use<00:00:40.079> our<00:00:40.320> scroll

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
shape we started off we use our scroll

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.430 
shape we started off we use our scroll
saw<00:00:41.070> but<00:00:41.610> you<00:00:41.790> can<00:00:41.970> use<00:00:42.149> whatever<00:00:42.390> whatever<00:00:43.170> is

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440

then you cut it with your scroll saw and

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.620 
then you cut it with your scroll saw and
then<00:00:51.780> you<00:00:51.960> put<00:00:52.230> some<00:00:52.260> small<00:00:53.040> screws<00:00:53.520> in<00:00:53.850> these

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:54.630

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
are just what we call pattern the screws

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.959 
are just what we call pattern the screws
you<00:00:57.329> put<00:00:57.570> those<00:00:57.750> in<00:00:57.809> it<00:00:58.200> and<00:00:58.350> from<00:00:59.280> that<00:00:59.550> now<00:00:59.820> if

into<00:01:11.010> a<00:01:11.040> good<00:01:11.400> production<00:01:11.880> pattern<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:12.840> that

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
into a good production pattern and that

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.590 
into a good production pattern and that
would<00:01:13.770> be<00:01:13.950> one<00:01:14.159> of<00:01:14.310> these<00:01:14.490> now<00:01:14.850> this<00:01:15.030> is<00:01:15.240> made

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
would be one of these now this is made

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.230 
would be one of these now this is made
from<00:01:15.890> HDPE<00:01:16.890> which<00:01:17.369> is<00:01:17.520> high-density

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
from HDPE which is high-density

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.929 
from HDPE which is high-density
polyethylene<00:01:18.799> it's<00:01:19.799> cutting<00:01:20.280> board<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.700> same

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
polyethylene it's cutting board the same

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.580 
polyethylene it's cutting board the same
thing<00:01:21.180> they<00:01:21.299> make<00:01:21.479> kitchen<00:01:21.930> cutting<00:01:22.200> boards

thing they make kitchen cutting boards

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.070 
thing they make kitchen cutting boards
out<00:01:22.740> of<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.070> you<00:01:23.100> could<00:01:23.850> cut<00:01:24.060> ten<00:01:24.390> thousand

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
out of and you could cut ten thousand

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.530 
out of and you could cut ten thousand
signs<00:01:25.409> off<00:01:25.860> of<00:01:26.549> this<00:01:26.729> pattern<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.420> it

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
signs off of this pattern and it

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.600 
signs off of this pattern and it
wouldn't<00:01:27.810> change<00:01:27.869> they<00:01:28.409> would<00:01:28.890> stay<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.340> same

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
wouldn't change they would stay the same

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.499 
wouldn't change they would stay the same

00:02:13.429 --> 00:02:13.439 
make you know 25 30 40 pattern so i just

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:14.899 
make you know 25 30 40 pattern so i just
wanted<00:02:13.680> to<00:02:13.739> let<00:02:13.889> you<00:02:13.950> know<00:02:14.069> what<00:02:14.370> those<00:02:14.549> screws

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:14.909 
wanted to let you know what those screws

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:18.170 
wanted to let you know what those screws
are<00:02:15.620> and<00:02:16.620> so<00:02:17.159> once<00:02:17.400> we<00:02:17.579> get<00:02:17.760> this

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
are and so once we get this

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.780 
are and so once we get this
pattern<00:02:18.540> made<00:02:18.780> now<00:02:19.079> this<00:02:19.260> is<00:02:19.439> HDPE<00:02:20.219> and<00:02:20.670> this

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
pattern made now this is HDPE and this

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.000 
pattern made now this is HDPE and this
is<00:02:20.939> our<00:02:21.090> production<00:02:21.390> pattern<00:02:22.049> we<00:02:22.650> can<00:02:22.829> lay

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
is our production pattern we can lay

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.190 
is our production pattern we can lay
that<00:02:23.040> on<00:02:23.250> a<00:02:23.430> board<00:02:23.819> now<00:02:24.090> I'm<00:02:24.780> going<00:02:24.930> to<00:02:25.019> cut

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
that on a board now I'm going to cut

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.190 
that on a board now I'm going to cut
this<00:02:25.379> half<00:02:25.590> inch<00:02:25.920> MDF<00:02:26.510> but<00:02:27.510> if<00:02:27.659> we're<00:02:27.900> making

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
this half inch MDF but if we're making

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.679 
this half inch MDF but if we're making
production<00:02:28.739> I<00:02:29.219> would<00:02:29.670> be<00:02:30.000> cutting<00:02:30.269> this<00:02:30.480> out

00:02:30.679 --> 00:02:30.689 
production I would be cutting this out

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:33.410 
production I would be cutting this out
of<00:02:30.900> three<00:02:31.680> quarter<00:02:32.040> inch<00:02:32.219> redwood<00:02:32.790> or<00:02:33.120> a<00:02:33.150> three

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
of three quarter inch redwood or a three

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.170 
of three quarter inch redwood or a three
quarter<00:02:33.750> inch<00:02:33.780> cedar<00:02:34.310> but<00:02:35.310> what<00:02:35.489> we<00:02:35.670> do<00:02:35.909> with

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
quarter inch cedar but what we do with

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.720 
quarter inch cedar but what we do with
the<00:02:36.329> screws<00:02:36.659> on<00:02:36.900> there<00:02:37.170> we<00:02:37.829> lay<00:02:38.069> it<00:02:38.250> on<00:02:38.430> the

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
the screws on there we lay it on the

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.140 
the screws on there we lay it on the
board<00:02:38.969> so<00:02:39.680> then<00:02:40.680> we<00:02:40.950> have<00:02:41.159> a<00:02:41.189> plastic<00:02:41.609> or<00:02:42.090> a

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
board so then we have a plastic or a

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.629 
board so then we have a plastic or a
rubber<00:02:42.540> hammer<00:02:42.980> and<00:02:43.980> then<00:02:44.159> we<00:02:44.280> tap<00:02:44.579> gently

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:46.639 
rubber hammer and then we tap gently

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:50.839 
rubber hammer and then we tap gently
that's<00:02:47.639> a<00:02:47.760> gentle<00:02:48.090> tap<00:02:48.530> tap<00:02:49.530> gently<00:02:49.920> on<00:02:50.099> the

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849 
that's a gentle tap tap gently on the

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:55.429 
that's a gentle tap tap gently on the
screws<00:02:52.370> so<00:02:53.370> that<00:02:53.609> it's<00:02:53.790> now<00:02:54.109> tough<00:02:55.109> to<00:02:55.290> this

00:02:55.429 --> 00:02:55.439 
screws so that it's now tough to this

00:02:55.439 --> 00:02:57.710 
screws so that it's now tough to this
board<00:02:55.799> that's<00:02:56.519> what<00:02:56.790> the<00:02:56.939> screws<00:02:57.269> do<00:02:57.510> they

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
board that's what the screws do they

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.319 
board that's what the screws do they
hold<00:02:57.930> it<00:02:58.109> to<00:02:58.260> that<00:02:58.439> board<00:02:58.739> and<00:02:59.069> then<00:02:59.970> we<00:03:00.120> take

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.329 
hold it to that board and then we take

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:03.319 
hold it to that board and then we take
our<00:03:00.510> router<00:03:00.840> base<00:03:01.669> which<00:03:02.669> is<00:03:02.849> our<00:03:03.000> just<00:03:03.209> a

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
our router base which is our just a

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:05.659 
our router base which is our just a
standard<00:03:03.780> porter-cable<00:03:04.139> router<00:03:04.739> base<00:03:05.010> we

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:05.669 
standard porter-cable router base we

00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:07.819 
standard porter-cable router base we
have<00:03:05.879> a<00:03:05.909> template<00:03:06.450> guide<00:03:06.810> kit<00:03:07.469> these<00:03:07.769> are

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:07.829 
have a template guide kit these are

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:10.490 
have a template guide kit these are
template<00:03:08.400> guides<00:03:08.669> and<00:03:09.060> this<00:03:09.659> is<00:03:09.840> our<00:03:09.989> template

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
template guides and this is our template

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.670 
template guides and this is our template
and<00:03:10.650> so<00:03:11.430> we<00:03:11.579> take<00:03:11.819> a<00:03:11.849> template<00:03:12.419> guide<00:03:12.689> that's

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
and so we take a template guide that's

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.920 
and so we take a template guide that's
good<00:03:14.040> for<00:03:14.310> a<00:03:14.340> quarter-inch<00:03:14.849> router<00:03:15.329> bit<00:03:15.689> which

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
good for a quarter-inch router bit which

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.330 
good for a quarter-inch router bit which
is<00:03:15.959> what<00:03:16.290> this<00:03:16.530> one<00:03:16.739> is<00:03:16.769> this<00:03:17.159> is<00:03:17.310> a

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
is what this one is this is a

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.270 
is what this one is this is a
quarter-inch<00:03:18.349> this<00:03:19.349> is<00:03:19.530> a<00:03:19.560> quarter-inch

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
quarter-inch this is a quarter-inch

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.930 
quarter-inch this is a quarter-inch
ID<00:03:20.489> inside<00:03:21.389> diameter<00:03:21.689> there<00:03:22.470> we<00:03:23.340> put<00:03:23.579> that<00:03:23.760> on

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
ID inside diameter there we put that on

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.759 
ID inside diameter there we put that on
the<00:03:24.120> base<00:03:24.769> then<00:03:25.769> we<00:03:25.919> take<00:03:26.220> a<00:03:26.280> nut<00:03:27.440> and<00:03:28.440> we<00:03:28.560> put

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
the base then we take a nut and we put

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:35.360 
the base then we take a nut and we put
on<00:03:28.919> the<00:03:29.069> backside<00:03:29.609> of<00:03:29.819> it<00:03:29.940> and<00:03:33.799> it<00:03:34.799> tightens<00:03:35.250> up

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
on the backside of it and it tightens up

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.849 
on the backside of it and it tightens up
like<00:03:36.060> so<00:03:36.359> and<00:03:36.780> you<00:03:37.229> take<00:03:37.439> the<00:03:37.560> pair<00:03:37.769> of

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
like so and you take the pair of

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:40.069 
like so and you take the pair of
channellocks<00:03:38.519> any<00:03:38.939> any<00:03:39.209> pair<00:03:39.599> of<00:03:39.689> pliers<00:03:39.930> and

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
channellocks any any pair of pliers and

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:41.629 
channellocks any any pair of pliers and
just<00:03:40.379> snug<00:03:40.590> it<00:03:40.650> up<00:03:40.889> you<00:03:41.099> don't<00:03:41.250> have<00:03:41.340> to<00:03:41.459> get<00:03:41.549> it

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:41.639 
just snug it up you don't have to get it

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:44.050 
just snug it up you don't have to get it
real<00:03:41.819> tight<00:03:42.120> but<00:03:42.840> just<00:03:43.019> good<00:03:43.199> and<00:03:43.379> snug<00:03:43.650> so

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
real tight but just good and snug so

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.909 
real tight but just good and snug so
that<00:03:45.060> it<00:03:45.180> doesn't<00:03:45.510> vibrate<00:03:45.720> loose<00:03:46.199> when<00:03:46.799> the

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:46.919 
that it doesn't vibrate loose when the

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:49.460 
that it doesn't vibrate loose when the
router<00:03:47.159> is<00:03:47.430> running<00:03:47.819> and<00:03:48.000> once<00:03:48.900> we<00:03:49.079> get<00:03:49.259> that

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
router is running and once we get that

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.420 
router is running and once we get that
done<00:03:49.530> get<00:03:50.459> that<00:03:50.699> on<00:03:50.909> there<00:03:51.319> we<00:03:52.319> put<00:03:52.560> the<00:03:52.709> base

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
done get that on there we put the base

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.140 
done get that on there we put the base
back<00:03:53.790> on<00:03:54.030> the<00:03:54.150> router<00:03:54.389> and<00:03:55.609> we<00:03:56.609> adjust<00:03:57.060> the

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
back on the router and we adjust the

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.550 
back on the router and we adjust the
height<00:03:59.030> so<00:04:00.030> that<00:04:00.269> this<00:04:00.509> is<00:04:00.720> a<00:04:00.750> pattern<00:04:01.319> this<00:04:01.500> is

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
height so that this is a pattern this is

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.640 
height so that this is a pattern this is
HDPE<00:04:02.400> pattern<00:04:03.030> and<00:04:03.569> this<00:04:03.689> will<00:04:03.930> right<00:04:04.109> on<00:04:04.379> that

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
HDPE pattern and this will right on that

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.619 
HDPE pattern and this will right on that
and<00:04:04.859> we<00:04:05.400> have<00:04:05.430> because<00:04:06.209> we're<00:04:06.419> cutting

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:06.629 
and we have because we're cutting

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:10.520 
and we have because we're cutting
half-inch<00:04:07.409> we<00:04:08.310> have<00:04:08.549> to<00:04:08.699> be<00:04:08.879> a<00:04:09.150> happiest<00:04:10.139> below

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
half-inch we have to be a happiest below

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.159 
half-inch we have to be a happiest below
that<00:04:10.799> so<00:04:11.400> we<00:04:11.579> adjust<00:04:11.729> our<00:04:12.209> router<00:04:12.479> bit<00:04:12.870> to

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:13.169 
that so we adjust our router bit to

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:16.759 
that so we adjust our router bit to
where<00:04:14.069> it<00:04:14.250> just<00:04:14.579> does<00:04:14.970> clear<00:04:15.449> I<00:04:15.780> mean<00:04:16.470> just

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
where it just does clear I mean just

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:20.449 
where it just does clear I mean just
just<00:04:17.549> barely<00:04:17.849> just<00:04:18.209> maybe<00:04:18.620> maybe<00:04:19.620> a<00:04:19.739> 64th

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
just barely just maybe maybe a 64th

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.749 
just barely just maybe maybe a 64th
which<00:04:20.729> is<00:04:20.880> 15<00:04:21.239> thousands<00:04:21.810> then<00:04:22.650> we<00:04:22.860> tap<00:04:23.430> it<00:04:23.639> up

00:04:23.749 --> 00:04:23.759 
which is 15 thousands then we tap it up

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:27.950 
which is 15 thousands then we tap it up
and<00:04:24.380> by<00:04:25.380> doing<00:04:25.650> that<00:04:26.270> we're<00:04:27.270> now<00:04:27.510> ready<00:04:27.779> to

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
and by doing that we're now ready to

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.450 
and by doing that we're now ready to
make<00:04:28.860> our<00:04:29.099> cut<00:04:29.659> assuming<00:04:30.659> that<00:04:30.960> this

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
make our cut assuming that this

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.720 
make our cut assuming that this
was<00:04:32.240> a<00:04:32.270> redwood<00:04:32.960> or<00:04:32.990> a<00:04:33.230> cedar<00:04:33.680> it<00:04:34.400> would<00:04:34.580> be

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:34.730 
was a redwood or a cedar it would be

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:40.810 
was a redwood or a cedar it would be
ready<00:04:34.940> to<00:04:35.120> cut<00:04:36.820> but<00:04:37.820> since<00:04:38.630> we're<00:04:38.840> using<00:04:39.820> the

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820 
ready to cut but since we're using the

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:45.130 
ready to cut but since we're using the
HDPE<00:04:41.720> and<00:04:42.320> and<00:04:42.710> the<00:04:42.950> MDF<00:04:43.490> we'll<00:04:44.300> cut<00:04:44.600> this<00:04:44.840> just

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:45.140 
HDPE and and the MDF we'll cut this just

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:48.190 
HDPE and and the MDF we'll cut this just
out<00:04:45.950> of<00:04:46.100> MDF<00:04:46.820> so<00:04:47.420> you<00:04:47.510> can<00:04:47.660> see<00:04:47.840> what<00:04:48.020> we're

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:48.200 
out of MDF so you can see what we're

00:04:48.200 --> 00:06:14.970 
out of MDF so you can see what we're
doing<00:04:48.500> so<00:04:49.960> get<00:04:50.960> everything<00:04:51.080> just<00:04:51.800> right<00:04:52.070> here

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:14.980 

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:18.540 

now<00:06:15.910> I<00:06:15.970> know<00:06:16.260> that<00:06:17.260> like<00:06:17.440> a<00:06:17.470> lot<00:06:17.800> of<00:06:17.950> things<00:06:18.160> on

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:18.550 
now I know that like a lot of things on

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:21.450 
now I know that like a lot of things on
my<00:06:18.610> cases<00:06:19.270> I<00:06:19.780> make<00:06:20.470> this<00:06:20.650> look<00:06:20.950> like<00:06:21.010> it's

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:21.460 
my cases I make this look like it's

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:24.330 
my cases I make this look like it's
awful<00:06:21.850> easy<00:06:22.030> but<00:06:22.600> the<00:06:22.720> truth<00:06:22.930> is<00:06:23.200> it's<00:06:23.950> just<00:06:24.190> as

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:24.340 
awful easy but the truth is it's just as

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:27.630 
awful easy but the truth is it's just as
easy<00:06:24.370> as<00:06:24.880> it<00:06:25.060> looks<00:06:25.300> now<00:06:25.860> this<00:06:26.860> is<00:06:27.040> what<00:06:27.250> I<00:06:27.280> cut

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:27.640 
easy as it looks now this is what I cut

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:30.900 
easy as it looks now this is what I cut
this<00:06:28.330> is<00:06:28.570> a<00:06:28.600> pattern<00:06:28.930> this<00:06:29.320> is<00:06:29.380> when<00:06:29.740> I<00:06:29.770> cut<00:06:30.130> and

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:30.910 
this is a pattern this is when I cut and

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:33.690 
this is a pattern this is when I cut and
if<00:06:31.240> we<00:06:31.870> were<00:06:32.020> in<00:06:32.200> production<00:06:32.860> on<00:06:32.980> these<00:06:33.250> this

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:33.700 
if we were in production on these this

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:35.520 
if we were in production on these this
would<00:06:33.910> be<00:06:34.060> either<00:06:34.270> redwood<00:06:34.840> or<00:06:34.870> a<00:06:35.080> cedar<00:06:35.410> or

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:35.530 
would be either redwood or a cedar or

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:37.440 
would be either redwood or a cedar or
white<00:06:36.010> board<00:06:36.340> whatever<00:06:37.060> you're<00:06:37.240> going<00:06:37.390> to

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:37.450 
white board whatever you're going to

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:39.570 
white board whatever you're going to
make<00:06:37.600> the<00:06:37.720> sign<00:06:38.020> out<00:06:38.260> of<00:06:38.440> but<00:06:38.980> this<00:06:39.160> gives<00:06:39.430> you

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:39.580 
make the sign out of but this gives you

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:43.770 
make the sign out of but this gives you
your<00:06:39.730> sign<00:06:40.060> blank<00:06:40.620> and<00:06:41.620> it<00:06:42.370> just<00:06:42.730> shows<00:06:43.570> you

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:43.780 
your sign blank and it just shows you

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:45.570 
your sign blank and it just shows you
how<00:06:43.810> this<00:06:44.320> is<00:06:44.470> what<00:06:44.620> we<00:06:44.830> wanted<00:06:45.130> to<00:06:45.190> do<00:06:45.400> this

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:45.580 
how this is what we wanted to do this

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:48.450 
how this is what we wanted to do this
month<00:06:45.850> as<00:06:46.420> we<00:06:46.690> wanted<00:06:46.990> to<00:06:47.050> show<00:06:47.320> you<00:06:47.350> how<00:06:47.740> not

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:48.460 
month as we wanted to show you how not

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:51.300 
month as we wanted to show you how not
only<00:06:48.490> to<00:06:48.880> make<00:06:49.060> the<00:06:49.240> pattern<00:06:49.620> but<00:06:50.620> how<00:06:50.770> to<00:06:50.830> take

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:51.310 
only to make the pattern but how to take

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:53.730 
only to make the pattern but how to take
the<00:06:51.490> pattern<00:06:51.760> and<00:06:52.240> make<00:06:52.720> a<00:06:52.750> finished<00:06:53.350> board

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:53.740 
the pattern and make a finished board

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:58.370 
the pattern and make a finished board
that<00:06:54.430> you<00:06:54.640> can<00:06:54.670> then<00:06:55.030> turn<00:06:55.240> into<00:06:55.540> the<00:06:55.780> sign<00:06:57.210> and

00:06:58.370 --> 00:06:58.380 
that you can then turn into the sign and

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:01.710 
that you can then turn into the sign and
this<00:06:59.380> is<00:06:59.590> what<00:06:59.770> the<00:06:59.920> signs<00:07:00.190> look<00:07:01.150> like<00:07:01.360> it<00:07:01.600> can

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:01.720 
this is what the signs look like it can

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:03.510 
this is what the signs look like it can
be<00:07:01.840> anything<00:07:02.140> on<00:07:02.410> that<00:07:02.590> sign<00:07:02.890> that<00:07:03.130> you<00:07:03.310> want

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:03.520 
be anything on that sign that you want

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:06.780 
be anything on that sign that you want
to<00:07:03.580> carve<00:07:03.820> and<00:07:04.180> so<00:07:05.080> this<00:07:05.320> is<00:07:05.530> this<00:07:06.430> is<00:07:06.610> our

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:06.790 
to carve and so this is this is our

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:10.950 
to carve and so this is this is our
