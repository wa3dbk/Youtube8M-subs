00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:05.370
 U 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:12.880
 A family company. 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:17.200
 If you are in Korea, 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:19.450
 Maybe once clear that game developers in Korea, people who are likely looked example 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:23.410
 It sounds like a dog. 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:28.899
 To be honest with me, 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:33.820
 Of course, I would really like to have a good company as a family friend, 

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:36.070
 Well, while trying to hide any problems ah these reasons, we have our family together 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:40.300
 The same 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:45.850
 There are companies that say it's because of that. 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:49.630
 Among them, that's just for me not to solve the problem I see is covering the issue 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:54.550
 Merely be an excuse so I called bullshit geureongeogo 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:56.820
 It 's not like a family company, it's just a company like that. 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:56.820
 so 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:07.280
 Oh , I think it 's funny. 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:11.260
 Parents are doing some business , and the business is not some big business 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:15.560
 I have been asked to buy a family, and now I have to help the drawing paper . 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:18.860
 You know these children are in the house, I bwateotgo in that old house assistant 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:22.280
 When my father could not do it, 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:27.770
 Yes, now my father keeps those who need my help . 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:32.450
 But if you look at a family management company 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:36.320
 Once the kids are in line complaint is usually because 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:41.390
 Go on, it's almost an unmanned mirror. 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:44.930
 I'm helping a family member. What money will I give you? 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:47.930
 When there is a lot of money if you spend wrote with me.Aren't life 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:52.880
 Of course not. 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:58.580
 There you go is the family's true of South Korea's family is very little say Come 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:59.869
 It 's not a problem with patriarchy, but it's a country with a lot of up and down. 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:05.710
 Literature 5 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:07.430
 That's when you have to obey the words of your father or mother. 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:12.290
 Level 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:15.709
 This applies'll be something that'll work something what it is now that 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:20.000
 The introduction of a game company in the west seems to be similar. 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:24.680
 Dumbbok pak is not as good as it should be for work. 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:29.150
 And for something reasonably speaking, just help me . 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:31.310
 Those things that push this kind of coercion. 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.020
 Re a good pass 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:41.040
 I thought so. 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:42.570
 But I would still rather the value of the family concept morph only the location oo 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:51.210
 I got it. 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:53.610
 Well Well Well, just so I just bowed bolttaen not correct, just haramyeon 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:57.540
 If you do this hard 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:59.340
 If the passport is too ohjanahyo me 1,000p The family ah companies like 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:03.330
 As a result, 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.470
 When parents work hard to give you everything yeah well it is to become handed 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:09.390
 If you go 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:13.680
 There can be a lot of work that he did so hard . 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:18.420
 In larger companies, as well as the company then called the family 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:22.380
 It's literally a bad thing, and the management rights do not give results. 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:26.550
 I 'm getting more and more thinking about what this is. 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:32.640
 This is why when you have another way of talking bullshit long ago 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:38.010
 Yes , that's why I want to be a family-like company. 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:43.260
 I do not think the company is good for me. 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:45.120
 I have to build it from the company. 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:49.290
 Awkward 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:52.290
 Why do I have to brag about knowing the tax because of my standing up ? 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:56.760
 Rather, the idea is also holding 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:59.610
 Well, I do not think Wonder Kimo is not picking up, but it's still a good welfare thing . 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:04.769
 Listen, girls like coming because of the family rather than welcome 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:08.730
 And, in other words , it is safe to say that 3 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:11.160
 My family is jingling jingles every day and I have something I have to hate. 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:14.660
 You know that. 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:20.720
 Just like a family member Oh 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:24.500
 q It's nice to say that the pie is a good word , 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.560
 I think that's what you say to hide something bad . 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.950
 so 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:32.190
 Well, the missionary is very calm. 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:34.700
 I want to finish it moderately and shortly. 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.700
 I was picked
