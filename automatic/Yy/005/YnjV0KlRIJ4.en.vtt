00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.670
 yop hello to all guys that's that 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:34.510
 I hope you'll get out well 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:35.770
 from the point not a little tutorial but one for 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.720
 show you a little the effects of v 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.360
 nomix that there is on the new map 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:43.480
 extinction the day may therefore effects 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:46.390
 rather nice because now the iv or v 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.500
 nomix if we can not help me if we 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:47.890
 is crazy there was one that was 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.100
 the green 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.750
 there there is the areuse the orange the green and 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.699
 the blue 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.829
 here I show you the already you see 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:59.829
 in the gameplay I show you everything 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:02.290
 start how we mount them enough to 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:03.100
 recover a file that is found 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.600
 in the second zone 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:10.840
 finally third zone 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:13.430
 on a workbench so see the video and 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.050
 the parts as well as in fact when we 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.060
 get a record we have 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.800
 recover after three pieces and the 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.410
 feet if he gets back in he must 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.090
 actually delve into the old 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.200
 mapon when we search and it was 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.390
 tiny chests and now these 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:30.130
 decorations are a bit longer and that 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:34.190
 you will be able to searched that if you have 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:38.840
 a girl here so here I showed you 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:42.710
 the the venom x yards 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:44.750
 no it's not poured blue I think I do not 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.979
 do not know wait and we'll see from 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.550
 the amap is really not bad 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.720
 it's nice to be able to create several 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.610
 several weapons 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.200
 finally several veins in the mix like that 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:58.750
 since they are all powerful he passes 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.750
 really good and it's nice when 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:06.170
 so here I showed you that we're going 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:08.929
 put the drill so that's the 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.979
 blue and blue is my favorite you 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.870
 see the damage done 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.870
 frankly this is our 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:20.480
 when aliens or indeed you 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:21.829
 have watched the damage that guy 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.650
 poison but a little blue flash like 

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:26.959
 I can tell you that one shot 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.239
 there are no x markers or what its 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:31.459
 cart and squeezing well powerful for 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:32.629
 protect his drill why 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:34.760
 attack because there are 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:37.370
 really complicated places and that's 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:41.239
 really it's really nice to have 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:44.750
 of events like that so also I 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:48.709
 like to say that for example if you 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:50.239
 make a phenomic this blue and ben after 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:52.519
 if you ever have more balls you 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:54.590
 can build a second and the 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:56.060
 replace the blue with a rose or 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.799
 universe do what you want 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.060
 replace it I do not know if we can 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:02.120
 do it several times anyway 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.049
 can do it once that I did not know 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.909
 what I did in fact is that 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:07.519
 could I have I built a 

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:09.680
 peno mix and after I left and I have 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:15.170
 redo a cottage 0 left try this is a 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:20.480
 short long so the second is the 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:23.780
 I know more I do not know how to break it anymore 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:26.720
 it's the water that's orange 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:29.450
 makes flames including kiwan toilet 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.250
 also and to make your way it's 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.099
 not bad too to protect the area 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.690
 I would frankly tell you the event 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:38.140
 on this map that are really not bad 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:40.760
 and we have four that makes it fun 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.110
 I just want to say that I have 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.049
 upside down and the qg coke video like you 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:47.180
 saw it in the intro maybe passed 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:49.579
 my first time we tell them what I 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:52.340
 try my luck we never know and in 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:56.030
 anyway thank you has succeeded my friends so 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:58.069
 see the damage is not bad 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.530
 you looked at one that is special 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:03.010
 it's just the gameplay afterwards and it's 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.010
 special 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:09.420
 So here see is the lady genomics 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:15.049
 them 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:17.160
 reuze and you will see the damage 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:20.549
 in fact it does not hurt 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.660
 that's what plant vs plants 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:24.570
 zombies as we call it with 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:26.520
 christophe lapix because it looks good 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.320
 a bit that we are in the game full of 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.430
 well not, but in any case it is 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.040
 powerful they are more between plants 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:35.280
 with that too you can protect 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.880
 young is like that plus he's pretty 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.030
 effective 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:41.250
 see again I put a lot to show 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:43.440
 and in fact that's it with the 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.880
 young aliens when they spit eh ben 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.530
 they make plants like are angry 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.440
 it's not complicated their story when 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:53.310
 even my means 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:56.340
 the drill she does not move and so here 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:59.130
 now the last part c the boss 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:02.970
 there is nothing exceptional the vein at 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:05.400
 glass mix so that makes the same 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.790
 damage that on nightfall exactly the 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.650
 same thing 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:08.790
 he is powerful he is powerful but 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.130
 it's not me it's not my favorite 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:11.820
 mentation says your huge prefer 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:14.009

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:18.089
