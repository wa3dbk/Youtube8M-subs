00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 welcome guys in this brand new 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.629
 video of alessandra 16 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.910
 today I decided to offer you a little one 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:12.719
 tutorial on how to install children games 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:15.949
 how to make cry 2 call of duty black ops 2 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:19.220
 gta san andreas gta vice city 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:22.650
 all the games you want for the mac 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.900
 without getting around the sites so maybe 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:29.400
 not even finding it is very simple 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:36.140
 just open firefox or safari that 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:36.140
 which you use search on google torrens 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:43.379
 with the final z open it and it will open 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:48.870
 this page that there is the engine of 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:51.270
 search for torrens will be enough to write 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:56.690
 the game you want to download I look for 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:59.100
 get cry 2 and then add mac at the end 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:04.019
 because if you want to play whose mac 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:07.619
 you will need it ok 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.920
 here I missed two possibilities 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.360
 I choose the first one because I've already done it 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:16.310
 and you should also choose the 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.310
 first one where there is written games mac 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:24.180
 let's open it here from a series of sites 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:28.979
 where you can download it but I give you 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:31.500
 a tip never download it from download 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:37.320
 say that as you see here it is 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:39.689
 only one sponsor will link you then 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:43.040
 you can check the comments below if 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:47.460
 I 'm there if there are none here 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:51.930
 and also the folder with the weight and the 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:02:01.140
 content goes well this is fine because it has 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:02:03.750
 a weight almost 5 mag to 5 gb and e anyway 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:07.320
 it's good because I downloaded it 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.940
 download it from monova or any other 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:15.970
 site but I wait for a new point 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:20.170
 well found then we have monova like 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.950
 never repeat direct download but always away 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.070
 torrent 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:27.040
 if you don't find a download via torrent 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:29.590
 I advise you not to download it because 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.140
 it could be something different and 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:35.560
 something else 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:40.210
 then up we open downloads via torrent e 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:44.100
 this will open to you, just do it 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:44.100
 ok and the download will start 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:54.130
 ok for this video is everything 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.390
 if you want to have others from mecs or others 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.460
 video 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.590
 maybe even on far cry or games 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:02.230
 downloaded from torres 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:07.270
