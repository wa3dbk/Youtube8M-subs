00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:40.180

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:48.640
 watching has already taken well here I have 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.159
 very few editors now I've taken 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.580
 almost all those I had 

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:56.140
 Another one I just left the good aviary and that 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:58.600

 I 'll show you leave those 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.309
 white polka dots on the photo I have 

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:04.930
 that I use a lot to color the 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:05.770
 photo and leave photo more free of 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.159
 proceed 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:11.049
 I love to let these photos is on high. 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:14.679
 setting the ground this way 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:17.859
 difference is super cool, the photo is not 

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:19.659
 and I moved a lot here in collor is the 

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:21.820
 increase and the low history with 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:24.070
 saturation of photo and like photo so 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:27.990
 very alive and with a very natural effect 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:31.090
 I use the effects here a lot 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.130
 aviary but I do not use them that way 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.319
 has here as regular then always of 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.119
 a regular dinh to leave the photo more 

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:40.270
 live more beautiful, right? 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:42.429
 Good, do not come, I'll do this to Cni, that's it. 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.649
 Output also no longer know for you leaves 

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:47.439
 the white balls and the bottoms in the 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:50.499
 photo is not fusca and is normal 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:53.319
 and here I have lastly pix art 

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:55.659
 so I quite like the pix art use 

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:56.820
 A lot of it is what I'm using 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:59.550
 fully 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.780
 in 2006 to take a photo do not have the same 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:06.150
 Photograph 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:08.310
 it then I was a chef in mesc 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:12.660
 option, we can make a lot 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:14.520
 You can not leave a picture with 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.040
 these are the transparent media 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.020
 White is white and has other colors 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.140
 and here you can put prints there has 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:26.940
 decoration has our various things I use 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:29.190
 I love this chip and it's a 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.220
 the most complete applications I have 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:35.670
 I think this episode and here it has the effects 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:40.170
 o the defects just do not have many effects 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:42.570
 so it is less loaded all the 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.420
 effects of it are well single chargers 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:48.870
 that I use a lot is this here is the 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:51.269
 dodge to him leaves foto 6 bluish and stays 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:56.370
 very nice photo and I also use a lot 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:58.019
