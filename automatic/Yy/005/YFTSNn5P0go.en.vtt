it<00:02:07.040> so<00:02:07.220> you<00:02:07.880> pass<00:02:08.090> the<00:02:08.300> shadow<00:02:08.600> here<00:02:08.899> I'll

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
it so you pass the shadow here I'll

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.389 
it so you pass the shadow here I'll
count<00:02:09.229> off<00:02:09.410> three<00:02:09.619> and<00:02:09.740> a<00:02:09.770> half<00:02:09.890> seconds<00:02:10.250> and

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
count off three and a half seconds and

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.340 
count off three and a half seconds and
you'll<00:02:10.520> sort<00:02:10.759> of<00:02:10.820> provisional<00:02:11.180> you<00:02:11.300> see<00:02:11.510> he's

you'll sort of provisional you see he's

you'll sort of provisional you see he's
accelerating<00:02:12.740> a<00:02:12.980> little<00:02:13.190> bit<00:02:13.310> now<00:02:13.460> so<00:02:13.760> are<00:02:14.660> we

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
accelerating a little bit now so are we

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.930 
accelerating a little bit now so are we

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
it's its timing in this case although

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.810 
it's its timing in this case although
the<00:02:33.320> system<00:02:33.650> says<00:02:34.010> about<00:02:34.250> two<00:02:34.490> hundred<00:02:34.580> and

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
it's gonna speed up a little bit now to

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.600 
it's gonna speed up a little bit now to

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.259 
away from us
pretty<00:02:57.310> aggressively<00:02:57.849> and<00:02:58.090> we're

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
pretty aggressively and we're

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:00.420 
pretty aggressively and we're
accelerating<00:02:58.750> very<00:02:59.709> aggressively<00:03:00.220> right

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
accelerating very aggressively right

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.860

behind<00:03:00.670> them

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.110 

okay<00:03:03.830> now<00:03:04.040> we're<00:03:04.220> slowing<00:03:04.430> right<00:03:04.700> down<00:03:04.910> and

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
okay now we're slowing right down and

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.339 
okay now we're slowing right down and
we're<00:03:05.269> getting<00:03:05.480> some<00:03:05.599> aggressive<00:03:05.870> braking

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:06.349 
we're getting some aggressive braking

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:07.900 
we're getting some aggressive braking
happening<00:03:06.680> I<00:03:06.769> got<00:03:06.920> got<00:03:07.069> my<00:03:07.220> foot<00:03:07.459> right<00:03:07.670> over

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
happening I got got my foot right over

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.360 
happening I got got my foot right over
the<00:03:08.000> brake<00:03:08.180> pedal<00:03:08.480> but<00:03:08.569> it's<00:03:08.720> not<00:03:08.870> on<00:03:09.050> it

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
the brake pedal but it's not on it

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.190 
the brake pedal but it's not on it
just<00:03:10.879> in<00:03:11.030> case<00:03:11.180> I<00:03:11.330> have<00:03:11.510> to<00:03:11.690> get<00:03:11.810> on<00:03:11.930> the<00:03:12.050> thing

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
just in case I have to get on the thing

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.809 
just in case I have to get on the thing
the<00:03:12.470> system<00:03:12.650> basically<00:03:13.010> slowed<00:03:13.489> us<00:03:13.640> right

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:13.819 
the system basically slowed us right

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:16.809 
the system basically slowed us right
down<00:03:14.030> here<00:03:14.830> we're<00:03:15.830> at<00:03:15.920> about<00:03:16.099> 12<00:03:16.370> miles<00:03:16.610> an

our our speed fluctuated along with the
cars<00:03:33.019> up<00:03:33.230> in<00:03:33.349> front<00:03:33.530> of<00:03:33.620> us<00:03:33.739> the<00:03:34.610> system<00:03:35.000> works

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
cars up in front of us the system works

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:37.210 
cars up in front of us the system works
when<00:03:35.420> following<00:03:35.810> a<00:03:35.989> car<00:03:36.170> directly<00:03:36.440> it<00:03:37.010> also

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
when following a car directly it also

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.089 
when following a car directly it also
works<00:03:37.640> on<00:03:37.849> a<00:03:37.910> curve<00:03:38.440> and<00:03:39.440> other<00:03:39.620> systems<00:03:40.040> are

works on a curve and other systems are

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:42.670 
works on a curve and other systems are
gonna<00:03:40.190> break<00:03:40.519> us<00:03:40.730> down<00:03:41.019> as<00:03:42.019> we<00:03:42.200> follow<00:03:42.470> this

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
gonna break us down as we follow this

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.259 
gonna break us down as we follow this
car<00:03:42.950> off<00:03:43.130> the<00:03:43.310> exit<00:03:43.579> ramp<00:03:43.700> here's<00:03:44.090> where<00:03:44.209> it

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 
car off the exit ramp here's where it

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:44.920 
car off the exit ramp here's where it
might<00:03:44.360> get<00:03:44.540> tricky

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
might get tricky

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.670 
might get tricky
it<00:03:45.709> occurs<00:03:45.980> now<00:03:46.220> out<00:03:46.430> of<00:03:46.459> the<00:03:46.640> radars<00:03:47.030> range<00:03:47.680> so

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
it occurs now out of the radars range so

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.559 
it occurs now out of the radars range so
it's<00:03:48.829> kind<00:03:49.040> of<00:03:49.099> motoring<00:03:49.970> back<00:03:50.150> up<00:03:50.329> to<00:03:50.450> speed

00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:50.569 
it's kind of motoring back up to speed

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:52.089 
it's kind of motoring back up to speed
as<00:03:50.810> soon<00:03:50.840> as<00:03:51.049> the<00:03:51.110> radar<00:03:51.290> picks<00:03:51.620> up<00:03:51.769> the<00:03:51.890> car

00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:52.099 
as soon as the radar picks up the car

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:53.979 
as soon as the radar picks up the car
we're<00:03:53.000> gonna<00:03:53.120> start<00:03:53.420> to<00:03:53.480> slow<00:03:53.660> down<00:03:53.690> again

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
we're gonna start to slow down again

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:56.949 
we're gonna start to slow down again
let's<00:03:54.769> cut<00:03:54.950> the<00:03:55.069> car<00:03:55.250> in<00:03:55.400> this<00:03:55.489> beam<00:03:55.780> even<00:03:56.780> on<00:03:56.930> a

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
let's cut the car in this beam even on a

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:59.110 
let's cut the car in this beam even on a
turn<00:03:57.290> not<00:03:57.860> straight<00:03:58.250> on<00:03:58.430> in<00:03:58.579> line<00:03:58.790> but<00:03:59.030> it

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
turn not straight on in line but it

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.970 
turn not straight on in line but it
knows<00:03:59.269> that<00:03:59.299> car<00:03:59.720> is<00:03:59.840> out<00:03:59.989> there<00:04:00.170> and<00:04:00.410> it's

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
knows that car is out there and it's

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:01.780 
knows that car is out there and it's
tracking<00:04:01.250> it

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
tracking it

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.660 
tracking it
so<00:04:02.180> it's<00:04:02.599> managing<00:04:03.170> our<00:04:03.319> speed<00:04:03.620> relative<00:04:04.370> to

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
so it's managing our speed relative to

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.410 
so it's managing our speed relative to
the<00:04:04.819> speed<00:04:05.120> of<00:04:05.150> the<00:04:05.329> car<00:04:05.510> in<00:04:05.599> front<00:04:05.660> of<00:04:05.900> us<00:04:07.420> in

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 
the speed of the car in front of us in

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.030 
the speed of the car in front of us in
the<00:04:08.630> next<00:04:08.750> clip<00:04:09.109> will<00:04:09.290> demonstrate<00:04:09.319> how<00:04:09.980> the

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
the next clip will demonstrate how the

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.160 
the next clip will demonstrate how the
system<00:04:10.549> manages<00:04:10.970> acceleration<00:04:11.780> very

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.170 
system manages acceleration very

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:14.199 
system manages acceleration very
efficiently<00:04:12.709> so<00:04:12.980> as<00:04:13.609> we<00:04:13.730> come<00:04:13.940> through<00:04:13.970> this

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:14.209 
efficiently so as we come through this

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:16.000 
efficiently so as we come through this
toll<00:04:14.450> booth<00:04:14.660> this<00:04:14.780> time<00:04:15.049> what<00:04:15.560> I'm<00:04:15.650> gonna<00:04:15.799> do

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
toll booth this time what I'm gonna do

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:17.469 
toll booth this time what I'm gonna do
is<00:04:16.160> just<00:04:16.310> hit<00:04:16.430> the<00:04:16.489> resume<00:04:16.970> button<00:04:17.239> on<00:04:17.389> the

00:04:17.469 --> 00:04:17.479 
is just hit the resume button on the

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:19.390 
is just hit the resume button on the
cruise<00:04:17.690> control<00:04:17.889> and<00:04:18.889> it<00:04:19.010> should<00:04:19.190> take<00:04:19.370> us

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
cruise control and it should take us

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.310 
cruise control and it should take us
right<00:04:19.669> back<00:04:19.729> up<00:04:20.150> to<00:04:20.299> 60<00:04:20.630> miles<00:04:20.780> an<00:04:20.930> hour<00:04:21.049> if<00:04:21.229> I

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
right back up to 60 miles an hour if I

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.690 
right back up to 60 miles an hour if I
cruise<00:04:21.620> it<00:04:21.859> so<00:04:22.190> I'm<00:04:22.970> at<00:04:23.150> 25<00:04:23.419> now<00:04:24.460> just<00:04:25.460> hit<00:04:25.550> the

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 
cruise it so I'm at 25 now just hit the

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.850 
cruise it so I'm at 25 now just hit the
resume<00:04:26.030> button<00:04:26.270> foots<00:04:26.930> off<00:04:27.110> the<00:04:27.289> gas<00:04:27.440> and<00:04:27.710> here

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
resume button foots off the gas and here

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.279 
resume button foots off the gas and here
we<00:04:28.010> go<00:04:28.160> the<00:04:29.060> trucks<00:04:29.330> are<00:04:29.419> accelerating<00:04:30.020> on<00:04:30.139> its

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:30.289 
we go the trucks are accelerating on its

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:31.970 
we go the trucks are accelerating on its
own

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:31.980 
own

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.540 
own
I<00:04:32.070> should<00:04:32.730> point<00:04:32.910> out<00:04:33.090> too<00:04:33.150> that<00:04:33.570> it's

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
I should point out too that it's

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.940 
I should point out too that it's
accelerating<00:04:35.550> nice<00:04:35.730> and<00:04:35.970> gently<00:04:36.800> the<00:04:37.800> whole

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:37.950 
accelerating nice and gently the whole

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:41.679 
accelerating nice and gently the whole
idea<00:04:38.310> behind<00:04:38.400> this<00:04:38.820> is<00:04:39.800> powertrain

00:04:41.679 --> 00:04:41.689 
idea behind this is powertrain

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:45.249 
idea behind this is powertrain
is<00:04:42.049> fuel<00:04:42.739> economy<00:04:42.949> obviously<00:04:43.989> so<00:04:44.989> here<00:04:45.139> we<00:04:45.229> are

00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:45.259 
is fuel economy obviously so here we are

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:48.070 
is fuel economy obviously so here we are
now<00:04:45.559> coming<00:04:45.889> up<00:04:46.069> just<00:04:46.849> back<00:04:47.029> on<00:04:47.209> 260<00:04:47.719> miles<00:04:47.869> an

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 
now coming up just back on 260 miles an

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.499 
now coming up just back on 260 miles an
hour<00:04:48.459> can<00:04:49.459> move<00:04:49.610> through<00:04:49.789> that<00:04:49.909> toll<00:04:50.119> booth<00:04:50.329> in

00:04:50.499 --> 00:04:50.509 
hour can move through that toll booth in

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:51.939 
hour can move through that toll booth in
fact<00:04:50.749> from<00:04:50.929> the<00:04:50.989> time<00:04:51.169> I<00:04:51.199> left<00:04:51.319> the<00:04:51.619> red<00:04:51.769> light

00:04:51.939 --> 00:04:51.949 
fact from the time I left the red light

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:54.059 
fact from the time I left the red light
back<00:04:52.159> there<00:04:52.219> I<00:04:52.459> didn't<00:04:52.759> touch<00:04:53.509> the<00:04:53.659> gas<00:04:53.749> at<00:04:53.929> all

00:04:54.059 --> 00:04:54.069 
back there I didn't touch the gas at all

00:04:54.069 --> 00:04:57.729 
back there I didn't touch the gas at all
so<00:04:55.069> now<00:04:55.159> we're<00:04:55.279> back<00:04:55.399> up<00:04:55.639> to<00:04:55.669> speed<00:04:55.999> and<00:04:56.739> the

00:04:57.729 --> 00:04:57.739 
so now we're back up to speed and the

00:04:57.739 --> 00:04:59.109 
so now we're back up to speed and the
system<00:04:58.129> managed<00:04:58.489> at<00:04:58.610> all<00:04:58.759> in<00:04:58.909> the<00:04:58.999> most

00:04:59.109 --> 00:04:59.119 
system managed at all in the most

00:04:59.119 --> 00:05:00.689 
system managed at all in the most
fuel-efficient<00:04:59.839> way<00:04:59.869> possible

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:00.699 
fuel-efficient way possible

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:04.329 
fuel-efficient way possible
pretty<00:05:01.699> slick<00:05:02.319> we've<00:05:03.319> seen<00:05:03.619> how<00:05:03.769> this<00:05:03.949> system

00:05:04.329 --> 00:05:04.339 
pretty slick we've seen how this system

00:05:04.339 --> 00:05:05.979 
pretty slick we've seen how this system
can<00:05:04.519> pretty<00:05:04.729> well<00:05:04.819> manage<00:05:05.299> speed<00:05:05.599> all<00:05:05.839> by

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:05.989 
can pretty well manage speed all by

00:05:05.989 --> 00:05:08.679 
can pretty well manage speed all by
itself<00:05:06.379> so<00:05:07.099> watch<00:05:07.309> now<00:05:07.549> as<00:05:07.789> we<00:05:07.909> once<00:05:08.089> again<00:05:08.269> get

00:05:08.679 --> 00:05:08.689 
itself so watch now as we once again get

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:10.839 
itself so watch now as we once again get
cut<00:05:08.899> off<00:05:09.019> by<00:05:09.049> the<00:05:09.289> car<00:05:09.619> and<00:05:09.799> how<00:05:10.189> gently<00:05:10.699> the

00:05:10.839 --> 00:05:10.849 
cut off by the car and how gently the

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:12.639 
cut off by the car and how gently the
adaptive<00:05:11.360> cruise<00:05:11.539> control<00:05:11.599> system<00:05:12.110> gets<00:05:12.529> us

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:12.649 
adaptive cruise control system gets us

00:05:12.649 --> 00:05:14.859 
adaptive cruise control system gets us
back<00:05:12.889> up<00:05:12.919> to<00:05:13.129> speed<00:05:13.509> we're<00:05:14.509> slowing<00:05:14.719> down

00:05:14.859 --> 00:05:14.869 
back up to speed we're slowing down

00:05:14.869 --> 00:05:16.689 
back up to speed we're slowing down
again<00:05:15.229> now<00:05:15.259> that<00:05:15.439> silly<00:05:15.949> car<00:05:16.249> in<00:05:16.339> front<00:05:16.429> of<00:05:16.579> us

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:16.699 
again now that silly car in front of us

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:19.809 
again now that silly car in front of us
now<00:05:16.939> down<00:05:17.449> to<00:05:17.599> 45<00:05:18.110> going<00:05:18.529> through<00:05:18.679> the<00:05:18.739> 40<00:05:19.159> you

00:05:19.809 --> 00:05:19.819 
now down to 45 going through the 40 you

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:23.199 
now down to 45 going through the 40 you
know<00:05:20.649> now<00:05:21.649> we're<00:05:21.889> going<00:05:22.099> to<00:05:22.189> accelerate<00:05:22.849> back

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:23.209 
know now we're going to accelerate back

00:05:23.209 --> 00:05:25.149 
know now we're going to accelerate back
up<00:05:23.449> to<00:05:23.569> speed<00:05:23.809> again<00:05:23.959> but<00:05:24.919> here's<00:05:25.069> the

00:05:25.149 --> 00:05:25.159 
up to speed again but here's the

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:27.459 
up to speed again but here's the
interesting<00:05:25.369> part<00:05:25.579> that<00:05:26.179> car<00:05:26.899> just<00:05:26.929> took<00:05:27.259> off

00:05:27.459 --> 00:05:27.469 
interesting part that car just took off

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:29.619 
interesting part that car just took off
look<00:05:27.800> at<00:05:27.860> that<00:05:27.919> he's<00:05:28.159> going<00:05:28.539> obviously<00:05:29.539> you

00:05:29.619 --> 00:05:29.629 
look at that he's going obviously you

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:31.179 
look at that he's going obviously you
realize<00:05:30.019> the<00:05:30.169> mistake<00:05:30.499> he<00:05:30.649> made

00:05:31.179 --> 00:05:31.189 
realize the mistake he made

00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:33.189 
realize the mistake he made
but<00:05:31.819> our<00:05:31.939> truck<00:05:32.209> now<00:05:32.389> is<00:05:32.569> getting<00:05:32.869> us<00:05:32.959> back<00:05:33.139> up

00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:33.199 
but our truck now is getting us back up

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:35.799 
but our truck now is getting us back up
to<00:05:33.409> speed<00:05:33.669> but<00:05:34.669> not<00:05:34.699> really<00:05:35.360> aggressively

00:05:35.799 --> 00:05:35.809 
to speed but not really aggressively

00:05:35.809 --> 00:05:39.040 
to speed but not really aggressively
we're<00:05:36.800> accelerating<00:05:37.339> back<00:05:37.819> up<00:05:38.029> to<00:05:38.149> 60<00:05:38.539> at<00:05:38.719> what

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:39.050 
we're accelerating back up to 60 at what

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:41.350 
we're accelerating back up to 60 at what
I<00:05:39.079> would<00:05:39.199> call<00:05:39.469> a<00:05:39.529> pre<00:05:39.799> moderate<00:05:40.279> pace<00:05:40.459> so<00:05:40.729> no

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 
I would call a pre moderate pace so no

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:42.850 
I would call a pre moderate pace so no
fuel<00:05:41.629> economy<00:05:41.839> is<00:05:42.229> still<00:05:42.409> part<00:05:42.709> of<00:05:42.769> the

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:42.860 
fuel economy is still part of the

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:44.919 
fuel economy is still part of the
equation<00:05:43.159> here<00:05:43.519> even<00:05:44.360> though<00:05:44.449> you've<00:05:44.599> got<00:05:44.779> the

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:44.929 
equation here even though you've got the

00:05:44.929 --> 00:05:46.540 
equation here even though you've got the
safety<00:05:45.139> feature<00:05:45.499> it's<00:05:45.800> still<00:05:46.039> not<00:05:46.219> going<00:05:46.489> to

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:46.550 
safety feature it's still not going to

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:48.759 
safety feature it's still not going to
be<00:05:46.759> you<00:05:47.479> know<00:05:47.539> bombs<00:05:47.899> away<00:05:48.139> let's<00:05:48.409> get<00:05:48.559> back<00:05:48.739> up

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:48.769 
be you know bombs away let's get back up

00:05:48.769 --> 00:05:51.149 
be you know bombs away let's get back up
to<00:05:49.039> sixty<00:05:49.459> it's<00:05:50.360> going<00:05:50.539> to<00:05:50.599> do<00:05:50.719> it<00:05:50.839> a<00:05:50.929> nice

00:05:51.149 --> 00:05:51.159 
to sixty it's going to do it a nice

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:53.499 
to sixty it's going to do it a nice
fuel-efficient<00:05:52.159> way<00:05:52.339> that's<00:05:53.059> the<00:05:53.179> beauty<00:05:53.479> of
