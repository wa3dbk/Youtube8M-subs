00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
jumpman air of course the infrared the

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:05.440 
jumpman air of course the infrared the
infrared<00:02:03.649> tag<00:02:03.889> will<00:02:04.069> teach<00:02:04.159> on<00:02:04.340> my<00:02:04.459> air<00:02:04.700> you

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
infrared tag will teach on my air you

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.679 
infrared tag will teach on my air you
know<00:02:05.599> what<00:02:05.719> I<00:02:05.779> mean<00:02:06.219> inside<00:02:07.219> the<00:02:07.490> shoe<00:02:09.159> you<00:02:10.159> got

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
in so with the infrared 23 of course you

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.190 
in so with the infrared 23 of course you
got<00:02:15.709> the<00:02:15.829> tag<00:02:16.069> you<00:02:17.030> know<00:02:17.180> what<00:02:17.299> I<00:02:17.329> mean<00:02:17.510> and<00:02:17.810> the

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
definitely one of them shoes that is

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.699 
definitely one of them shoes that is
gonna<00:02:37.760> turn<00:02:37.969> heads<00:02:38.450> because<00:02:38.870> of<00:02:39.230> like<00:02:39.379> a<00:02:39.409> lot

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
gonna turn heads because of like a lot

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:40.990 
gonna turn heads because of like a lot
of<00:02:39.829> people<00:02:39.980> probably<00:02:40.099> wouldn't<00:02:40.459> pick<00:02:40.730> them<00:02:40.909> up

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
of people probably wouldn't pick them up

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.390 
of people probably wouldn't pick them up
but<00:02:41.569> basically<00:02:41.780> if<00:02:42.260> you<00:02:42.620> really<00:02:42.920> go<00:02:42.950> in<00:02:43.189> shoe

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
but basically if you really go in shoe

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.099 
but basically if you really go in shoe
stores<00:02:43.700> and<00:02:43.909> look<00:02:44.060> a<00:02:44.209> lot<00:02:44.450> of<00:02:44.629> shoes<00:02:44.840> uses

stores and look a lot of shoes uses
infrared<00:02:45.650> color<00:02:46.129> so<00:02:46.459> it's<00:02:46.609> not<00:02:46.730> just<00:02:46.790> night

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
infrared color so it's not just night

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.360 
infrared color so it's not just night
like<00:02:47.989> jordan<00:02:48.409> brand<00:02:48.590> but<00:02:48.709> i<00:02:48.769> think<00:02:49.040> the<00:02:49.189> new
