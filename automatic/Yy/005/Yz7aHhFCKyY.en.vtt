an automatic bypass function built-in if
you're<00:00:42.000> running<00:00:42.329> off<00:00:42.510> battery<00:00:42.960> power<00:00:43.290> and

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
you're running off battery power and

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.069 
you're running off battery power and
your<00:00:44.250> battery<00:00:44.610> dies<00:00:44.780> the<00:00:45.780> pedal

your battery dies the pedal

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.560 
your battery dies the pedal
automatically<00:00:46.590> goes<00:00:46.770> into<00:00:47.010> bypass<00:00:47.489> mode<00:00:47.730> so

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
automatically goes into bypass mode so

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.029 
automatically goes into bypass mode so
if<00:00:48.899> you<00:00:48.960> plugged<00:00:49.230> in<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.680> even<00:00:49.800> if<00:00:49.890> your
