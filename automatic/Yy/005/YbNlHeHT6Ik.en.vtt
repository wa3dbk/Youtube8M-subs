00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 hello very good we all have a 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.910
 news an airline arranges a 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.160
 turbine with adhesive tape so is the 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.790
 truth is that a rather curious thing 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.160
 which has happened a quite scene 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:21.000
 unusual because it terrified a man who 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.400
 he was sitting inside an airplane 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.099
 that's the truth is that it can look like a 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.710
 young because he was inside an airplane and 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.830
 He took out the photograph they will have seen and 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.809
 Well the truth is that it came out pretty 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.820
 brown and good the truth is that I do not 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.180
 I understand how a person can 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:42.270
 fix in this rudimentary way 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:45.270
 what is a turbine for that adam 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.730
 Liverpool Walker in UK as 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:52.050
 he was sitting inside an airplane 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:55.170
 and of a plane company and such and 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:59.190
 when he saw the unusual scene 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.829
 photography is high selling a mechanic of 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:05.339
 airport as I was hitting a 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:08.609
 turbine with adhesive tape 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:11.340
 shared through twitter the image 

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:14.369
 so that exactly because he knew what 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.819
 it was happening and well then at the end 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:20.159
 of a few minutes they responded to this 

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:22.590
 man and well they told ban that 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.289
 he was doing what is adam called what he said 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.939
 please rest assured that that 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:33.030
 tape is there to repair a problem 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:36.719
 cosmetic that is solved with paint 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:39.179
 it is solved with paint but they used 

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:40.920
 adhesive tape I do not understand anything I do not 

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:44.219
 I understand nothing, not because it says that 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:47.969
 Solve with paint and use paint 

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:51.170
 like duct tape I do not know what Persian and 

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:53.729
 neither in the problem is cosmetic 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.739
 cosmetic I do not understand very well what 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.200
 wants what you want to refer to 

00:01:55.739 --> 00:02:00.989
 cosmetic no and good for one thing 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:04.049
 rather curious that has happened as 

00:02:00.989 --> 00:02:05.700
 I'm counting the liverpool in kingdom 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.470
 joined to be good there was no 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.500
 biggest problem 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.930
 the confusion that that person had and 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:16.920
 now we move on to the next news 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:20.850
 and is that two brand of soda and such 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:23.120
 must compensate an addict with their 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:27.120
 soft drinks the two multinationals 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:30.120
 they will pay two thousand 700 dollars of invoices 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.580
 from a dentist to a young Chinese man who 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.580
 He allegedly sued a young Chinese man 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:39.300
 26 years I had been using said 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:42.300
 carbonated beverages since for 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:45.690
 3 years apparently, he has had 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:48.540
 dental problems and apparently it's called 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.910
 sion long and has gotten paid 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:54.420
 the dentist's bills the two 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.160
 large multinational soft drinks the 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.530
 truth is that apparently they have 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.110
 defendant because apparently he expects to say 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.150
 they were already falling their teeth and I 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.800
 what I think is that if all the people now 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.900
 after he has learned that it is 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.540
 online have been paid the bills of 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.400
 dentist now all the people who have 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.890
 the most vital teeth as they go to 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:17.940
 accuse the drink 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:20.190
 is carbonic because of this, not because I do not 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.620
 I understand the truth nothing apparently according to 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:25.620
 I thought the family says that this drink 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.520
 that were like water I drank it like water 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.100
 to drink water 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:33.510
 this family drank nothing more than this 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:36.330
 drink and well, they're going to pay for it 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.490
 $ 2,700 dentist and the truth is 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.440
 I do not know what you think about this 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:43.319
 news and we passed the last thing that you 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:46.500

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:48.870
 in the amusement park you shut up and 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.510
 this is how Chinese has said apparently 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:54.060
 felipe juan froilán the son of the 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.510
 infanta elena and de jaime de marichalar 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:04:00.780
 when starred a pretty moment 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:04.739
 incredible in a visit to the abyss then 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:07.620
 said these words you shut up and Chinese 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:10.050
 that's how he said no and well the 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.150
 truth is that there has been 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:13.769
 quite then I in this sense and the 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.109
 I do not know what you think of 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:19.200
