00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:13.070
 Save some people starting another program 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.930
 with an eye on mtur as always marcelo 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:18.410
 Andrade is my side to talk. 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:20.779
 about the sixth stage of ctt 2015 gt open 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.460
 who did not have a champion but who had 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:25.849
 winners in this marcelo 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:28.640
 undoubtedly the biggest winner was the 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:30.409
 microphone for sure and left unharmed 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.610
 shark attack white shark one 

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:35.780
 Terrifying scene, everyone got kinda 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:39.109
 apprehensive I was making the 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:41.870
 comments from the web on the whole supersurf 

00:00:39.109 --> 00:00:43.820
 hour attacking cheap ended after me 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:47.210
 I saw the pictures really was business 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:49.969
 very strong think mineirinho was a 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:52.579
 winner for not having a champion is 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:54.679
 the rule says that when you mp 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:57.050
 It was a championship you have to give the 

00:00:54.679 --> 00:01:01.100
 points of that phase until you know 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:03.199
 days and continues to lead the ranking 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.110
 I think diluted came out winner by 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:07.730
 his attitude of breaking into the 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.530
 mpn to help 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:12.530
 I think that many many trades would 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.570
 there come to the surface and half stopped it not him 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.460
 he was confident that he could give me 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:20.090
 defends somehow showed a lot of 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:22.640
 courage showed so much a thing 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:26.840
 strong, few people thought 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:29.030
 of him wilson and wsl was the winner 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.520
 because something worse has not happened live 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.880
 for everyone to the whole community of 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:37.460
 surfing has I think in the end 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.230
 a lot of people left the winner despite the 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.340
 shark did that damage in the 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.540
 event 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.310
 to mark us making a 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.180
 comparison with our policy here 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.980
 in Brazil 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.710
 many times there is an attitude will be taken 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:50.810
 after something serious happens to you 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.910
 You think we can speak the same wsl 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.990
 or in sancho i will always have that risk 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.000
 of shark 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.590
 Look, I particularly think that 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.390
 it's a warning, right? 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.400
 I think it has to rethink the step of 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.390
 margaret river white shark and 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.460
 jefferson 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.470
 even because the whole world has two 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.739
 quiet places to replace 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:12.130
 waves as good as it's alright it's 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:15.290
 tradition to south africa already made bay 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.700
 margaret river is also more to be a 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.860
 risk 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.330
 is very large we see in the water 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.849
 microphone images 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.319
 I think the athlete how he will stay 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:25.780
 psychologically shaken by a good 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:28.540
 time and I think the works is 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.730
 rethink this and only now enter the 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.800
 competition that two finalists julian 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.900
 wilson and mick fanning is how you said it 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.580
 now we had three Brazilians 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.220
 among the top five gabriel medina 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.569
 adriano de souza alejo muniz guest 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.959
 the stage that has already ensured 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:45.370
 still w on ct 2016 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:47.799
 I'll start with the law is what 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.620
 you got what you 're looking for 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:54.730
 is very confident use the steps of 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:56.500
 ct just as training as experience is 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.840
 using his equipment to see 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:02.290
 almost work well on the beaches that the 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.870
 peace and the confidence that you 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.880
 Very well, my year is very calm, all 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.349
 the batteries he scores high 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.120
 I think only on the battery he lost 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:11.739
 in the quarters that he could have a little 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.329
 better yet the opponent is 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.709
 very difficult right? 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:16.239
 he had already asked him a few times 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:18.610
 I did not want to lose again. 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:20.950
 the medina went back to surfing who is champion 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.079
 world made a very good battery with 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.329
 kelly slater in the quarterfinals what he had 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:27.850
 that overcoming the medina was 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:31.660
 bitten né had already lost in bells 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:33.430
 so that business was still so much 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:37.120
 is that after mick fanning the gas 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:39.190
 he gave up all place of medina and the 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.510
 Mineirinho risked a lot with Julian 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.519
 Wilson and I think if he had 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.709
 completed one thing that happened and 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:46.209
 lean thin here he risked account 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:48.579
 of a game because he thought that john 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:50.530
 it was better than in that sea 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:51.609
 he also risked diets and then 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.500
 It did not work 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:56.170
 adilson passed suffocate but 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.810
 bureaucratically but got the grades 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:00.880
 necessary to pass we can 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.160
 talk of 'guidance' presented 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.440
 that plaid backside formed in the 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.970
 years of dictatorship with you even 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.880
 spoke in the first eye program on the 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.950
 future on ctg bay and now has the 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.959
 Felipe also arrived as vice-leader 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.790
 in the last stages have not been well 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:18.729
 happened once again now in indy 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:21.669
 actress is the little filipino this sea for him was 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:22.690
 very good even on the battery he ran 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:24.340
 with the law 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.410
 I thought it was very similar to the inep 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.320
 hawks somehow né 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:31.090
 where there is a medium size one right 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.160
 The way he likes it, it was super good. 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:36.210
 and made 16 and a few source 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:39.910
 But thanks, you got the winning wave. 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:41.770
 broke right did everything he could took 9 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.390
 43 I 'm not mistaken 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.190
 and it was difficult for Felipinho that 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:49.570
 result is important because 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:51.630
 The next step is is the clothes and it does not 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:55.510
 has a tradition of good so I think 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:58.630
 he is thus in my opinion of f0 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:01.060
 strategic to him and to quiet 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:03.100
 discuss the title better then beauty 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:05.230
 let's end it, let's end another one 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:07.060
 program in the future and if the 

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:08.230
 second on ebay stage 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:10.000
 We meet in one week. 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:12.640
 more or less to talk about step 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:16.680
 of the taiti where it was arranged as you say 

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:16.680
 so thanks people a hug
