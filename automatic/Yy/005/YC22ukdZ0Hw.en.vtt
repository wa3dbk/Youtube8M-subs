00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:55.919 
because I'm no genius all right and I

00:05:55.919 --> 00:05:57.439 
because I'm no genius all right and I
just<00:05:56.130> thought<00:05:56.220> that<00:05:56.370> on<00:05:56.699> no<00:05:56.909> further<00:05:57.150> listen

00:05:57.439 --> 00:05:57.449 
just thought that on no further listen

00:05:57.449 --> 00:05:59.719 
just thought that on no further listen
you<00:05:57.630> figure<00:05:57.930> you<00:05:58.710> figure<00:05:59.099> you<00:05:59.280> figure<00:05:59.580> that

00:05:59.719 --> 00:05:59.729 
you figure you figure you figure that

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:01.640 
you figure you figure you figure that
they<00:05:59.880> could<00:06:00.060> think<00:06:00.240> that<00:06:00.300> up<00:06:00.510> so<00:06:01.199> then<00:06:01.440> they

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:01.650 
they could think that up so then they

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:03.649 
they could think that up so then they
say<00:06:01.889> the<00:06:02.010> Gibbs<00:06:02.250> you<00:06:02.460> know<00:06:02.580> what<00:06:02.820> you're<00:06:03.539> not

00:06:03.649 --> 00:06:03.659 
say the Gibbs you know what you're not

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:05.240 
say the Gibbs you know what you're not
going<00:06:03.840> to<00:06:03.930> say<00:06:04.110> anything<00:06:04.139> no<00:06:04.770> matter<00:06:04.889> what

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:05.250 
going to say anything no matter what

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:07.550 
going to say anything no matter what

not<00:06:12.710> right<00:06:13.710> for<00:06:14.130> the<00:06:14.250> American<00:06:14.280> people<00:06:14.699> not<00:06:15.510> to

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:15.780 
not right for the American people not to

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:19.010 
not right for the American people not to
know<00:06:16.400> generally<00:06:17.400> what's<00:06:18.300> being<00:06:18.570> done<00:06:18.840> in

their name we're paying for the drones
bekal<00:06:21.780> I<00:06:22.050> understand<00:06:22.740> that<00:06:22.919> Orion

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:23.370 
bekal I understand that Orion

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:25.790 
bekal I understand that Orion
and<00:06:23.610> here's<00:06:23.850> the<00:06:24.030> point<00:06:24.270> he<00:06:24.870> should<00:06:25.229> have<00:06:25.500> the

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:25.800 
and here's the point he should have the

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.580 
and here's the point he should have the
fact<00:06:26.010> is<00:06:26.220> it<00:06:26.460> was<00:06:26.669> a<00:06:26.699> program<00:06:27.210> that<00:06:27.810> was<00:06:28.080> secret

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:28.590 
fact is it was a program that was secret

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:31.159 
fact is it was a program that was secret
it<00:06:28.770> was<00:06:29.040> being<00:06:29.370> very<00:06:29.550> effectively<00:06:30.090> done<00:06:30.449> now<00:06:30.900> I

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:31.169 
it was being very effectively done now I

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:33.140 
it was being very effectively done now I
just<00:06:31.320> said<00:06:31.830> I<00:06:31.860> gave<00:06:32.280> you<00:06:32.400> some<00:06:32.610> credit<00:06:32.880> which

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:33.150 
just said I gave you some credit which

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:36.200 
just said I gave you some credit which
is<00:06:33.330> a<00:06:33.360> big<00:06:34.110> leap<00:06:34.350> for<00:06:34.620> me<00:06:34.740> to<00:06:35.610> say<00:06:35.820> that<00:06:35.970> the<00:06:36.090> way

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:36.210 
is a big leap for me to say that the way

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:37.550 
is a big leap for me to say that the way
your<00:06:36.360> formulation<00:06:36.840> was<00:06:37.050> not<00:06:37.260> a<00:06:37.290> bad

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:37.560 
your formulation was not a bad

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.590 
your formulation was not a bad
formulation<00:06:38.220> that<00:06:38.400> doesn't<00:06:39.120> mean<00:06:39.300> that<00:06:39.449> you

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:39.600 
formulation that doesn't mean that you

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:40.790 
formulation that doesn't mean that you
ought<00:06:39.720> to<00:06:39.810> get<00:06:39.900> in<00:06:40.020> the<00:06:40.080> details<00:06:40.260> of<00:06:40.710> these

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:40.800 
ought to get in the details of these

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.560 
ought to get in the details of these
things<00:06:41.040> you<00:06:41.580> shouldn't<00:06:41.970> get<00:06:42.090> into<00:06:42.270> the<00:06:42.419> night

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:42.570 
things you shouldn't get into the night

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:44.659 
things you shouldn't get into the night
over<00:06:42.930> saying<00:06:43.199> I<00:06:43.500> would<00:06:43.979> object<00:06:44.070> to<00:06:44.400> that<00:06:44.490> too

00:06:44.659 --> 00:06:44.669 
over saying I would object to that too

00:06:44.669 --> 00:06:46.939 
over saying I would object to that too
so<00:06:45.060> I<00:06:45.120> agree<00:06:45.479> we<00:06:45.660> agree<00:06:45.960> that<00:06:45.990> well<00:06:46.530> it<00:06:46.680> won't

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:46.949 
so I agree we agree that well it won't

00:06:46.949 --> 00:06:48.950 
so I agree we agree that well it won't
help<00:06:47.400> they<00:06:47.820> want<00:06:48.030> to<00:06:48.090> keep<00:06:48.210> and<00:06:48.419> transparency

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:48.960 
help they want to keep and transparency

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:50.450 
help they want to keep and transparency
by<00:06:49.139> the<00:06:49.199> way<00:06:49.320> you<00:06:49.620> know<00:06:49.710> one<00:06:49.979> administration

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:50.460 
by the way you know one administration

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:51.860 
by the way you know one administration
one<00:06:50.669> President's<00:06:51.120> Committee<00:06:51.389> has<00:06:51.510> not<00:06:51.630> talked

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:51.870 
one President's Committee has not talked

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:53.750 
one President's Committee has not talked
about<00:06:51.930> being<00:06:52.229> transparent<00:06:52.680> I<00:06:53.010> can't<00:06:53.460> think<00:06:53.520> of

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:53.760 
about being transparent I can't think of

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.969 
about being transparent I can't think of
one<00:06:53.940> in<00:06:54.090> the<00:06:54.180> last<00:06:54.300> 20<00:06:54.690> years<00:06:54.900> who<00:06:55.500> hasn't<00:06:55.710> used

00:06:55.969 --> 00:06:55.979 
one in the last 20 years who hasn't used

00:06:55.979 --> 00:06:57.830 
one in the last 20 years who hasn't used
that<00:06:56.250> formulation<00:06:56.760> nobody<00:06:57.210> made<00:06:57.449> his<00:06:57.570> big<00:06:57.810> a

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:57.840 
that formulation nobody made his big a
