00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
doing the outer V and then the shimmer

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.420 
doing the outer V and then the shimmer
is<00:01:29.340> I<00:01:29.369> was<00:01:29.610> like<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.820> focus<00:01:30.210> lid<00:01:30.420> colors<00:01:31.430> so

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.039 
is I was like the focus lid colors so
your<00:01:32.670> contouring<00:01:33.240> that<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:33.750> then<00:01:33.869> we're

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
your contouring that and then we're

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.350 
your contouring that and then we're
going<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.200> contour<00:01:34.590> some<00:01:34.829> more<00:01:35.070> so<00:01:35.729> this<00:01:35.970> is<00:01:36.000> a

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
going to contour some more so this is a

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.300

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
waste it by applying to the brush and or

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.810 
waste it by applying to the brush and or
to<00:04:33.570> the<00:04:33.600> back<00:04:33.810> of<00:04:33.930> my<00:04:34.020> hand<00:04:34.290> and<00:04:34.500> then<00:04:34.740> blend<00:04:35.730> it

to the back of my hand and then blend it

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.820 
to the back of my hand and then blend it
in<00:04:35.970> with<00:04:36.000> your<00:04:36.360> flattop<00:04:36.690> buffer<00:04:37.320> brush<00:04:37.500> this

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
is from the vortexes collection so I

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.290
