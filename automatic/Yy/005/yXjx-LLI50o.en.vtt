hello<00:00:05.090> there<00:00:05.300> this<00:00:05.660> is<00:00:05.830> unwrapped<00:00:06.830> developer

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:07.640 
hello there this is unwrapped developer

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.419 
hello there this is unwrapped developer
of<00:00:07.670> surf<00:00:08.000> cube<00:00:08.300> and<00:00:08.620> it<00:00:09.620> is<00:00:09.740> my<00:00:09.889> pleasure<00:00:09.950> to

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:10.429 
of surf cube and it is my pleasure to

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:12.820 
of surf cube and it is my pleasure to
show<00:00:10.639> you<00:00:10.700> the<00:00:11.419> new<00:00:11.570> features<00:00:11.839> of<00:00:12.320> surf<00:00:12.559> cube

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:12.830 
show you the new features of surf cube

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.680 
show you the new features of surf cube
2.0<00:00:14.320> in<00:00:15.320> surf<00:00:15.650> cube<00:00:15.889> one<00:00:16.190> you<00:00:16.760> already<00:00:16.970> had<00:00:17.300> two

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:17.690 
2.0 in surf cube one you already had two

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:21.460 
2.0 in surf cube one you already had two
ways<00:00:17.930> of<00:00:18.080> navigating<00:00:18.550> this<00:00:19.550> 3d<00:00:20.240> cube<00:00:20.539> what<00:00:21.320> is

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:21.470 
ways of navigating this 3d cube what is

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.130 
ways of navigating this 3d cube what is
just<00:00:21.769> panning<00:00:22.760> from<00:00:23.150> the<00:00:23.390> edge<00:00:23.510> and<00:00:23.840> another

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:24.140 
just panning from the edge and another

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.179 
just panning from the edge and another
one<00:00:24.380> is<00:00:24.560> the<00:00:25.929> accelerometer<00:00:26.929> some<00:00:27.920> of<00:00:28.039> our

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:28.189 
one is the accelerometer some of our

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:32.140 
one is the accelerometer some of our
users<00:00:28.400> found<00:00:29.330> these<00:00:30.460> navigation<00:00:31.460> techniques

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:32.150 
users found these navigation techniques

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.600 
users found these navigation techniques
a<00:00:32.450> little<00:00:32.599> bit<00:00:32.750> cumbersome<00:00:33.380> so<00:00:34.010> we<00:00:34.160> introduced

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:34.610 
a little bit cumbersome so we introduced

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.760 
a little bit cumbersome so we introduced
a<00:00:34.730> new<00:00:34.850> way<00:00:35.060> of<00:00:35.090> navigating<00:00:35.330> which<00:00:36.320> is<00:00:36.500> the

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:36.770 
a new way of navigating which is the

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.320 
a new way of navigating which is the
joystick<00:00:37.280> and<00:00:38.000> the<00:00:38.150> joystick<00:00:38.570> is<00:00:38.780> a<00:00:38.870> little

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:40.330 
joystick and the joystick is a little

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:45.040 
joystick and the joystick is a little
little<00:00:41.330> round<00:00:41.990> arrow<00:00:42.650> thingy<00:00:43.310> down<00:00:43.640> here<00:00:44.270> if<00:00:44.870> I

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 
little round arrow thingy down here if I

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.670 
little round arrow thingy down here if I
just<00:00:45.080> press<00:00:45.560> it<00:00:45.590> you<00:00:46.550> can<00:00:46.760> see<00:00:47.000> that<00:00:47.680> it

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
just press it you can see that it

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.040 
just press it you can see that it
controls<00:00:49.490> the<00:00:49.610> cube<00:00:49.970> that<00:00:50.210> makes<00:00:50.420> it<00:00:50.540> rotate

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
controls the cube that makes it rotate

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.900 
controls the cube that makes it rotate
and<00:00:51.290> this<00:00:51.380> rotation<00:00:51.980> is<00:00:52.070> very<00:00:52.310> smooth<00:00:52.640> there's

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:52.910 
and this rotation is very smooth there's

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.950 
and this rotation is very smooth there's
no<00:00:53.120> bleachers<00:00:53.450> no<00:00:53.600> max<00:00:54.080> and<00:00:55.240> you<00:00:56.240> can<00:00:56.450> control

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
no bleachers no max and you can control

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.550 
no bleachers no max and you can control
if<00:00:57.290> you<00:00:57.590> want<00:00:57.770> to<00:00:57.920> see<00:00:58.190> the<00:00:58.810> DQ<00:00:59.810> rotating

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:00.560 
if you want to see the DQ rotating

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.450 
if you want to see the DQ rotating
slowly<00:01:00.800> or<00:01:01.370> fast<00:01:02.680> if<00:01:03.680> you<00:01:03.830> just<00:01:04.040> click<00:01:04.400> the

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
slowly or fast if you just click the

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.359 
slowly or fast if you just click the
joystick<00:01:05.269> it<00:01:05.840> goes<00:01:06.110> back<00:01:06.439> to<00:01:06.679> the<00:01:06.859> middle<00:01:07.189> and

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
joystick it goes back to the middle and

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:10.240 
joystick it goes back to the middle and
you<00:01:07.399> can<00:01:08.090> also<00:01:08.240> do<00:01:08.570> little<00:01:09.109> flakes<00:01:09.409> to<00:01:09.890> really

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
you can also do little flakes to really

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.270 
you can also do little flakes to really
fast<00:01:11.020> to<00:01:12.020> navigate<00:01:12.469> the<00:01:12.619> cube<00:01:12.950> really<00:01:13.490> fast

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
fast to navigate the cube really fast

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.260 
fast to navigate the cube really fast
another<00:01:16.280> thing<00:01:16.579> that<00:01:16.609> you<00:01:16.759> can<00:01:16.939> do<00:01:17.060> with<00:01:17.090> the

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
another thing that you can do with the

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.209 
another thing that you can do with the
joystick<00:01:17.659> is<00:01:17.780> tap<00:01:18.020> and<00:01:18.200> hold<00:01:18.409> and<00:01:18.799> move<00:01:18.979> it

00:01:19.209 --> 00:01:19.219 
joystick is tap and hold and move it

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:22.810 
joystick is tap and hold and move it
around<00:01:19.429> so<00:01:20.119> if<00:01:20.509> I'm<00:01:20.810> right<00:01:21.229> handed<00:01:21.499> my<00:01:22.460> thumb

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
around so if I'm right handed my thumb

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.749 
around so if I'm right handed my thumb
may<00:01:23.299> be<00:01:23.359> more<00:01:24.200> convenient<00:01:24.679> in<00:01:25.039> this<00:01:25.219> position

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:25.759 
may be more convenient in this position

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:28.179 
may be more convenient in this position
so<00:01:25.999> I<00:01:26.030> just<00:01:26.299> positioned<00:01:26.810> here<00:01:27.170> I<00:01:27.380> can<00:01:28.039> also

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189 
so I just positioned here I can also

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:31.809 
so I just positioned here I can also
resize<00:01:29.090> it<00:01:29.390> let<00:01:30.229> me<00:01:30.409> just<00:01:30.619> keep<00:01:31.069> it<00:01:31.280> a<00:01:31.399> little

00:01:31.809 --> 00:01:31.819 
resize it let me just keep it a little

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:33.999 
resize it let me just keep it a little
relatively<00:01:32.659> high<00:01:32.810> science<00:01:33.229> so<00:01:33.499> that<00:01:33.530> you<00:01:33.799> can

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
relatively high science so that you can

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:38.200 
relatively high science so that you can
see<00:01:34.280> it<00:01:35.560> so<00:01:36.560> you<00:01:36.649> can<00:01:36.890> really<00:01:37.069> customize<00:01:37.310> this

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
see it so you can really customize this

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.289 
see it so you can really customize this
this<00:01:39.020> joystick<00:01:39.530> another<00:01:40.399> requested<00:01:41.060> feature

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:41.299 
this joystick another requested feature

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:45.069 
this joystick another requested feature
what<00:01:41.659> steps<00:01:42.020> and<00:01:43.030> we<00:01:44.030> waited<00:01:44.420> until<00:01:44.600> version

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:45.079 
what steps and we waited until version

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:49.300 
what steps and we waited until version
2.2<00:01:45.799> to<00:01:46.280> make<00:01:46.789> tabs<00:01:47.149> really<00:01:47.920> work<00:01:48.920> and<00:01:49.189> we

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
2.2 to make tabs really work and we

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:50.980 
2.2 to make tabs really work and we
asked<00:01:49.520> a<00:01:49.579> lot<00:01:49.700> of<00:01:49.850> our<00:01:49.969> users<00:01:50.240> to<00:01:50.689> give<00:01:50.869> us

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
asked a lot of our users to give us

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.319 
asked a lot of our users to give us
feedback<00:01:51.170> on<00:01:51.499> what<00:01:51.649> they<00:01:51.829> need<00:01:52.039> from<00:01:52.219> taps<00:01:52.579> so

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:53.329 
feedback on what they need from taps so

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:55.120 
feedback on what they need from taps so
let<00:01:53.479> me<00:01:53.509> show<00:01:53.749> you<00:01:53.780> how<00:01:53.899> two<00:01:54.049> EPs<00:01:54.319> look<00:01:54.590> like<00:01:54.859> in

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
let me show you how two EPs look like in

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.550 
let me show you how two EPs look like in
surf<00:01:55.399> cube<00:01:55.670> two<00:01:55.909> point<00:01:56.179> oh<00:01:56.329> we<00:01:57.020> already<00:01:57.200> had

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
surf cube two point oh we already had

surf cube two point oh we already had
being<00:01:57.859> open<00:01:58.520> so<00:01:59.060> let<00:01:59.209> me<00:01:59.240> open<00:01:59.420> google<00:02:00.109> in<00:02:00.350> a

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
being open so let me open google in a

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.499 
being open so let me open google in a
new<00:02:00.679> champ<00:02:01.509> this<00:02:02.509> is<00:02:02.719> a<00:02:02.749> google<00:02:03.469> and<00:02:04.299> this<00:02:05.299> is<00:02:05.479> a

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
new champ this is a google and this is a

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:08.410 
new champ this is a google and this is a
new<00:02:05.840> tab<00:02:06.139> because<00:02:06.350> on<00:02:06.649> the<00:02:06.770> left<00:02:06.979> side<00:02:07.390> we<00:02:08.390> have

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
new tab because on the left side we have

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.500 
new tab because on the left side we have
this<00:02:08.810> tab<00:02:09.770> and<00:02:10.009> left<00:02:10.729> side<00:02:11.060> always

this tab and left side always

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.360 
this tab and left side always
shows<00:02:14.510> up<00:02:14.750> like<00:02:14.989> this<00:02:15.200> it<00:02:15.440> doesn't<00:02:15.620> rotate<00:02:15.950> the

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
shows up like this it doesn't rotate the

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.539 
shows up like this it doesn't rotate the
cube<00:02:16.580> totally<00:02:17.239> and<00:02:17.680> here<00:02:18.680> are<00:02:18.739> the<00:02:18.830> tabs<00:02:19.159> you

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:19.549 
cube totally and here are the tabs you

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:21.640 
cube totally and here are the tabs you
can<00:02:19.580> just<00:02:20.060> click<00:02:20.569> on<00:02:20.720> them<00:02:20.870> and<00:02:20.900> the<00:02:21.170> switching

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
can just click on them and the switching

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.559 
can just click on them and the switching
is<00:02:21.849> instantaneous<00:02:24.010> another<00:02:25.010> thing<00:02:25.390> about<00:02:26.390> the

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
is instantaneous another thing about the
