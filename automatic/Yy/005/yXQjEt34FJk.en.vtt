getting<00:02:20.100> the<00:02:20.190> elbow<00:02:20.580> under<00:02:20.850> here<00:02:21.150> he's<00:02:21.660> gonna

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
getting the elbow under here he's gonna

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.780 
getting the elbow under here he's gonna
roll<00:02:22.110> into<00:02:22.380> me<00:02:22.590> while<00:02:22.770> I<00:02:22.800> push<00:02:23.010> this<00:02:23.160> down<00:02:23.370> I'm

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
roll into me while I push this down I'm

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.020 
roll into me while I push this down I'm
gonna<00:02:24.060> trap<00:02:24.390> this<00:02:24.780> forward<00:02:25.620> and<00:02:26.160> this<00:02:26.400> goes<00:02:26.760> up

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
gonna trap this forward and this goes up

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.080 
gonna trap this forward and this goes up
on<00:02:27.300> the<00:02:27.480> hill<00:02:27.750> I'm<00:02:28.230> gonna<00:02:28.500> change<00:02:29.060> when<00:02:30.060> I

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
on the hill I'm gonna change when I

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.240 
on the hill I'm gonna change when I
change<00:02:30.180> see<00:02:30.840> how<00:02:30.959> I<00:02:30.989> lock<00:02:31.290> his<00:02:31.560> foot<00:02:31.800> down<00:02:31.980> and

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
change see how I lock his foot down and

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.880 
change see how I lock his foot down and
I<00:02:32.610> get<00:02:32.820> up<00:02:32.940> into<00:02:33.120> him<00:02:33.390> push<00:02:34.170> this<00:02:34.350> to<00:02:34.560> his<00:02:34.650> butt

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
I get up into him push this to his butt

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.680 
I get up into him push this to his butt
roll<00:02:35.610> over<00:02:36.239> okay<00:02:37.050> now<00:02:37.290> if<00:02:37.890> he<00:02:38.070> pushes<00:02:38.520> away

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
roll over okay now if he pushes away

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.930 
roll over okay now if he pushes away
that's<00:02:39.690> when<00:02:40.050> I<00:02:40.080> triangle<00:02:40.530> and<00:02:41.160> I<00:02:41.580> can<00:02:41.760> get

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
that's when I triangle and I can get

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.280 
that's when I triangle and I can get
this<00:02:42.260> okay<00:02:43.260> if<00:02:43.980> he<00:02:44.310> doesn't<00:02:44.760> push<00:02:44.940> away<00:02:45.290> okay

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290

I'm going to grab the wrist go over here

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.600 
I'm going to grab the wrist go over here
and<00:02:49.680> then<00:02:50.220> I'm<00:02:50.430> gonna<00:02:50.550> twist<00:02:50.850> her<00:02:51.090> okay<00:02:52.110> so

and then I'm gonna twist her okay so
change<00:02:53.610> the<00:02:54.030> direction<00:02:54.180> over<00:02:54.690> here

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.610 

so<00:03:03.430> back<00:03:04.430> up<00:03:04.700> in<00:03:04.850> here<00:03:04.880> all<00:03:05.420> I'm<00:03:05.690> doing<00:03:06.020> is<00:03:06.170> I'm

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
so back up in here all I'm doing is I'm

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.090 
so back up in here all I'm doing is I'm
getting<00:03:07.010> this<00:03:07.160> now<00:03:07.850> if<00:03:08.000> he<00:03:08.090> pushes<00:03:08.360> away<00:03:09.100> let

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
getting this now if he pushes away let

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.020 
getting this now if he pushes away let
it<00:03:10.220> come<00:03:11.410> right<00:03:12.410> into<00:03:12.590> the<00:03:12.800> back<00:03:12.980> all<00:03:13.850> right

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
it come right into the back all right

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.960 
it come right into the back all right
and<00:03:14.240> then<00:03:14.690> you<00:03:14.780> get<00:03:14.900> the<00:03:15.020> control<00:03:15.380> you<00:03:15.530> want

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
and then you get the control you want

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.710 
and then you get the control you want
all<00:03:16.970> right<00:03:17.150> that<00:03:17.720> is<00:03:18.110> what<00:03:18.370> is<00:03:19.370> all<00:03:19.520> about<00:03:19.790> it's

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
all right that is what is all about it's

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.510 
all right that is what is all about it's
about<00:03:20.840> being<00:03:21.680> able<00:03:21.830> to<00:03:22.190> open<00:03:22.640> up<00:03:22.760> leg<00:03:23.390> locks

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:24.520 
about being able to open up leg locks

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.760 
about being able to open up leg locks
transitions<00:03:25.520> and<00:03:26.230> ultimately<00:03:27.230> if<00:03:27.410> the<00:03:27.560> move

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:27.770 
transitions and ultimately if the move

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:31.000 
transitions and ultimately if the move
fails<00:03:28.240> taking<00:03:29.240> the<00:03:29.330> back<00:03:29.510> that's<00:03:30.500> why<00:03:30.740> it's<00:03:30.920> a

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
fails taking the back that's why it's a

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.910 
fails taking the back that's why it's a
path<00:03:31.190> to<00:03:31.430> the<00:03:31.520> back<00:03:31.670> it's<00:03:32.300> not<00:03:32.570> a<00:03:32.930> move<00:03:33.500> that

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
path to the back it's not a move that

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.050 
path to the back it's not a move that
you're<00:03:34.070> always<00:03:34.250> going<00:03:34.520> to<00:03:34.550> finish<00:03:34.730> with<00:03:34.910> that

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
you're always going to finish with that

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.390 
you're always going to finish with that
at<00:03:35.420> wrestlers<00:03:36.050> guillotine<00:03:36.470> that's<00:03:37.160> why<00:03:37.340> you

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
at wrestlers guillotine that's why you

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.070 
at wrestlers guillotine that's why you
have<00:03:37.610> the<00:03:37.700> cross<00:03:37.910> river<00:03:38.240> that's<00:03:38.600> why<00:03:38.780> you<00:03:38.840> have

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080 
have the cross river that's why you have

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.410 
have the cross river that's why you have
the<00:03:39.170> Kapernick<00:03:39.740> that's<00:03:40.130> why<00:03:40.310> you<00:03:40.430> have<00:03:40.760> the

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
the Kapernick that's why you have the

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.720 
the Kapernick that's why you have the
the<00:03:41.810> twister<00:03:42.230> itself<00:03:42.590> that's<00:03:43.130> why<00:03:43.310> you<00:03:43.370> have

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
the twister itself that's why you have

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.270 
the twister itself that's why you have
at<00:03:44.000> the<00:03:44.510> end<00:03:44.660> which<00:03:45.200> is<00:03:45.320> hanky<00:03:45.770> rolls<00:03:45.980> out<00:03:46.160> and

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
at the end which is hanky rolls out and

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.460 
at the end which is hanky rolls out and
take<00:03:46.460> the<00:03:46.610> back<00:03:46.790> show<00:03:47.360> commit<00:03:47.660> that's<00:03:48.170> what<00:03:48.380> we

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
take the back show commit that's what we

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.680 
take the back show commit that's what we
want<00:03:48.680> to<00:03:48.770> four<00:03:48.920> points<00:03:49.310> close<00:03:49.520> ten<00:03:49.790> all<00:03:50.510> right

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
want to four points close ten all right

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.050 
want to four points close ten all right
so<00:03:51.140> just<00:03:51.350> try<00:03:51.590> the<00:03:51.650> simple<00:03:52.070> position<00:03:52.280> first

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
so just try the simple position first

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.300 
so just try the simple position first
step<00:03:53.360> is<00:03:53.840> getting<00:03:54.290> it<00:03:54.530> from<00:03:54.710> twist<00:03:55.010> inside

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
step is getting it from twist inside

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:56.800 
step is getting it from twist inside
control<00:03:55.760> which<00:03:55.910> is<00:03:55.940> the<00:03:56.060> easiest<00:03:56.390> way<00:03:56.540> to<00:03:56.570> get

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
control which is the easiest way to get

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.340 
control which is the easiest way to get
it<00:03:56.960> use<00:03:57.710> that<00:03:57.920> five<00:03:58.160> on<00:03:58.460> hook<00:03:58.940> it<00:03:59.350> shoulder

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:00.350 
it use that five on hook it shoulder

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:01.720 
it use that five on hook it shoulder
roll<00:04:00.620> that's<00:04:00.770> why<00:04:00.920> we<00:04:01.070> do<00:04:01.160> shoulder<00:04:01.460> rolls<00:04:01.640> in

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
roll that's why we do shoulder rolls in

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.310 
roll that's why we do shoulder rolls in
the<00:04:01.820> beginning<00:04:02.000> class<00:04:02.300> because<00:04:03.050> you've<00:04:03.200> got

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:03.320 
the beginning class because you've got

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:04.930 
the beginning class because you've got
to<00:04:03.410> do<00:04:03.470> a<00:04:03.530> lot<00:04:03.740> of<00:04:03.800> rolling<00:04:04.310> to<00:04:04.700> be<00:04:04.850> an

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:04.940 
to do a lot of rolling to be an

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.840 
to do a lot of rolling to be an
effective<00:04:05.360> technical<00:04:05.960> ground<00:04:06.170> okay<00:04:07.040> guys<00:04:07.220> so

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:07.850 
effective technical ground okay guys so

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:10.300 
effective technical ground okay guys so
let's<00:04:08.030> drill
