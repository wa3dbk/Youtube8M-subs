00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.919
 Hi everyone of the world rubber market 

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:06.800
 This is a table tennis wisdom bag 

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.060
 Nice to meet you Today's theme is 

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.060
 Here is the Impact Faucce and 

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:16.230
 I will introduce you to serve you 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.080
 How many and many hit points for you today 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.780
 I think I'll make it with your serve now 

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:28.110
 If you want to increase the types more rotation of the serve is less 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.110
 If you think there is no way to work better 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.899
 As I strongly recommend Impact Faster 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.060
 Please try it with only one procedure 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:44.109
 One easy step is your serve 

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:50.120
 Please make eight hitting points from now 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.379
 I'll let you do this in the lower rotation serve this time 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:59.329
 Even in the same downward rotation, you hit the middle of the racket everyone 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.350
 Lower rotation serve to hit center 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.770
 And in front of the racket grip 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.580
 Hit the ball and rotate it down and serve the racket 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.140
 Down rotation serve that cuts in a feeling like entering from the left end 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.539
 These three types of lower rotation serve now for a moment 

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:28.479
 Amount, quality and orbit of the three types at the same angle 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:32.539
 The way of bounding is slightly different 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:36.219
 The same form of downward rotation as seen from the opponent 

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:41.780
 Even though they have the same form, they always serve different things 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.700
 I can make an impression like rumbling 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.890
 It is a serve that can be done pretty much in the private seminar 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:54.100
 It is a serve that was highly evaluated, just change the position to hit 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.340
 It is possible to make subtle changes to the third ball attack 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.170
 It is a serve that is easy to tie 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.650
 I will give you eight hit points to you today 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.450
 I'll make it in the serve you have 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.780
 First of all in the position to hit this grip 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.580
 This racket is located in the lower right part of the grip 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.810
 It is the lower right that I put on lower rotation serve right here. 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.960
 First of all, this time with a grip 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.010
 The other side is to hit the bottom left of the root 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.550
 Lower rotation serve This is the second third 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.090
 I'll go to this center line and hit the right end of the center line 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.540
 I'm going to serve the lower rotation serve here, often to donkuru serve 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:44.960
 Position rotation can not be applied 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.190
 It is famous as a position and if it hits here 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.700
 It means that the lower rotation serve will be a dunk knuckle 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.570
 This time, serve to cut the center of the center 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.360
 It is a commonly used serve and is said to cut well 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.650
 It is the position of the serve It is the fourth eye I did it now 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:08.860
 The second, third and fourth are the fifth from here 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.820
 It is a downward rotation serve that hangs at the left end of the center line 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:18.810
 The sixth is the right side of the tip this time 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.120
 Sixth turn here hang down serve 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.100
 This time it is tip center this time 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:26.690
 Often used in long serve 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.750
 It is a position used in knuckle serve etc. 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.860
 Now the eighth place in the center of the seventh tip 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.890
 Here is the left side of the tip part 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:42.710
 It means that you hit a ball more than 1-2-3-4-5-6 now 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:47.160
 There are 7-8 places, and it's just a quick glance 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.950
 Now there were eight places in the lower rotation same lower rotation serve 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.940
 There are so many different patterns now 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:10.780
 We will actually try serving 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.220
 The way to shake is the same The way to shake is the same 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.670
 The amount of rotation and orbit of the serve were completely different 

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:20.010
 Did you notice now? 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.710
 It may be a bit of a look now at this angle 

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:23.730
 I'm sorry, but now the same way 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:27.040
 Despite the fact that the ball hit position eight places 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.340
 Just give it a turn and the ball's trajectory 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.780
 There is an orbit that goes down and extends 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.200
 There is also a bottom turn serve there everyone 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.440
 It might be better to have you research 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.250
 I use these eight places and give the same rotation 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.790
 Put out in the same way so this position is broken 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.190
 This position stops well This position is knuckle 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.180
 It's the same way to say 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:57.460
 Because the bound position and the ball quality change slightly every time 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.680
 There is a phenomenon that the other party is likely to miss 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.570
 I will get up now I really hit the impact of the ball 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:05.880
 If you go back to eight places, serve will all the time 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.990
 Even if there is only a bottom turn serve, there is a situation where it keeps cutting 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:12.720
 It feels like it's easy to be born 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.590
 In addition to horizontal rotation serve and yg winding serve etc 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:21.220
 This impact fail-safe can be applied 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:24.150
 Depending on the location, the top may be a strong side turn 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:27.531
 Depending on the location, turn the side of the strong side up 

00:05:27.531 --> 00:05:30.210
 It is very funny because it feels like 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.090
 Even if it rotates sideways, the impact fail- 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:35.280
 I think it's pretty interesting 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.090
 Impact Faster Today is your service 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:42.220
 Make eight points of hit points and try serving 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:43.240
 Thank you very much
