00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 hello to all i will introduce you 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.210
 radiate the art I was wearing this email so 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.280
 it's a ribbon I made at the 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:12.290
 bladder 3d but in this video I'm going 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.290
 also compared the gene and there lies 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.510
 so here are the men I have since 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:20.390
 one week 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:22.160
 so the resin really pulls very 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.669
 very well on the nails I used 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.140
 a china base gleizes sand effect that 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:29.380
 is really beautiful that I find 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.519
 with golden reflections like that 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.190
 and then I took some resin 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:36.019
 abc nestor brand powder and the 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.730
 tami taylor resident brush who is 

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:40.129
 really good for this technique because 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:43.640
 that I do not have too small then I have 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:45.470
 used the liquid abc news corp 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.710
 so I start with m a first 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:50.750
 molds in the corner of the nail and then I 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.309
 will spread it out in an arc 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.039
 so after that it's up to you to define the 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:57.079
 shape if you crush your resin into 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:59.750
 chasing your brush a little bit more 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:01.039
 the sides so the ball makes the bow of 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.690
 circle will be much wider 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:04.399
 if you stay in the same place you 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.880
 will have an arc 

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:11.210
 really u shaped then I place 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:14.210
 the second molds next and then I read again 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.880
 both the two acts circle and 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.130
 then I crush so you still have to 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.140
 try to respect a nice harmony 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.780
 in the form do not have to do it 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.690
 anything either so here it is 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:30.679
 must try to make curvatures 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.160
 pretty good and so I continue like this 

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:33.110
 in fact 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.380
 so on by making a mold 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.149
 crushed up 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.039
 the down paths always in 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:41.719
 placing his ball and connecting it to 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:41.719
 the other one before crushing it 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:47.130
 so after that you have to vary the sizes of 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.799
 balls to make it prettier not 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:55.770
 to make exactly the same size the same 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:57.329
 So there form here but I have not film 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.149
 I continued exactly the same 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.679
 especially the nail is a little 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.770
 little long to do but it's frankly 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:07.140
 no more complicated than a flower I 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.789
 find that it's easier than you 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.860
 to make a flower is not too much the layout 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.840
 petals affair so that's the 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.250
 final result 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.930
 then we will prepare the 3d geiq 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.940
 so here I put on a nail polish pictures 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.760
 polish so the 3d gel it looks like that 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.560
 it's a very very very young boy 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.190
 looks like he's a little damn and actually 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.290
 no for the prao two teams hen and I 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.709
 so go and apply it on loeb so here 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.660
 I'm doing leader form is actually 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.640
 unlike the resin what to say 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.280
 ribbon we will be able to train it into a 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.590
 time with the gel since it does not dry 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.810
 Aler dries only under the lamp 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.910
 uv so then I take my brush 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.799
 special gel and instead of working it 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.750
 with the liquid monomer of the resin 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:52.170
 is good the job with clean air of 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:54.750
 alcohol actually to soften it and 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.730
 so then this work goes a bit of the 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.340
 same way we will say that is to say 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.769
 I'm going to crush one side up and then 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.019
 crushed one side down but 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:06.180
 the benefit of freezing is already one 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:08.100
 it does not smell strong at all 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.709
 nothing since there are some who do not support 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.480
 the smell of resin and then we go 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.459
 really have the ease of them 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.440
 work as it dries that under 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.480
 uv lamp so you can start again 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.690
 thousands 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.549
 twice you can go wrong 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.470
 start over again your boudin voice 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:27.290
 flatten it's really comfortable over the 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.360
 gel so when it's over we catalyze from 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:33.650
 3 min worth advertising and depending on the 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:35.150
 mark and so then we degrease with 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:40.819
 alcohol since the gel is a small 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:42.560
 little sticky to finish my shape so 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:44.180
 either on the gel or the resin 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.760
 we can draw with acrylic paint 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.870
 from above so especially on the desire that 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.060
 seems to me a lot more since the 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.980
 resin is not totally white and 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.510
 then I add a few small ones 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:57.170
 features in the same way for 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:59.060
 accentuate the result of personally 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.410
 I prefer a result there is I 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.269
 prefer to work it because I 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.340
 find it more fun that you too 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:05.480
 to say why 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.310
 see I find that rendering the resin 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.260
 is more fun the 10.3 in comments 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.420
 that you prefer what you would have 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.370
 preferred to work whether it's the gel or 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.140
 the resin and I give you an appointment 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.060
 you next friday for a video 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.289
 on the pedicure because it takes 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.660
 really take care of his feet 

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:22.850
 since we are going to show the sandals 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.850
 soon 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.850
 I
