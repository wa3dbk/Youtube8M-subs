take you through the different felting

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.520 
take you through the different felting
needles<00:00:06.899> and<00:00:07.049> the<00:00:07.140> different<00:00:07.440> gauges<00:00:08.030> and<00:00:09.530> the

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
needles and the different gauges and the

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.120 
needles and the different gauges and the
result<00:00:10.889> basically<00:00:11.809> so<00:00:12.809> we'll<00:00:12.960> start<00:00:13.170> with<00:00:13.469> the

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
result basically so we'll start with the

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.260 
result basically so we'll start with the
42<00:00:14.490> ultra<00:00:15.350> the<00:00:16.350> 42<00:00:16.740> or<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:17.250> ultras<00:00:17.640> have<00:00:17.850> one

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
42 ultra the 42 or the ultras have one

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.800 
42 ultra the 42 or the ultras have one
barb<00:00:18.539> per<00:00:18.930> side<00:00:19.640> and<00:00:20.640> you<00:00:21.390> can<00:00:21.539> see<00:00:21.689> the

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
barb per side and you can see the

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.330 
barb per side and you can see the
different<00:00:22.080> results<00:00:22.199> so<00:00:22.560> there's<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:22.890> 42

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
different results so there's the 42

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.040 
different results so there's the 42
which<00:00:23.550> is<00:00:23.689> your<00:00:24.689> finest<00:00:25.230> and<00:00:26.210> your<00:00:27.210> 36<00:00:27.779> which

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
which is your finest and your 36 which

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.310 
which is your finest and your 36 which
is<00:00:28.080> your<00:00:28.670> thickest<00:00:29.900> you<00:00:30.900> can<00:00:31.080> see<00:00:31.199> the

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
is your thickest you can see the

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.950 
is your thickest you can see the
difference<00:00:31.679> there<00:00:31.920> and<00:00:34.190> then<00:00:35.190> you<00:00:35.340> go<00:00:35.550> to

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
difference there and then you go to

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.090 
difference there and then you go to
regulars<00:00:37.550> again<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.700> 42<00:00:39.180> is<00:00:39.390> your<00:00:39.510> finest<00:00:40.100> the

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
regulars again the 42 is your finest the

regulars again the 42 is your finest the
regulars<00:00:41.489> have<00:00:41.610> got<00:00:41.760> three<00:00:42.030> Barb's<00:00:42.390> or<00:00:42.540> two<00:00:42.690> to

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
regulars have got three Barb's or two to

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.600 
regulars have got three Barb's or two to
three<00:00:42.989> Barb's<00:00:43.260> per<00:00:43.469> side<00:00:43.770> so<00:00:44.480> the<00:00:45.480> 42<00:00:45.899> is<00:00:45.960> the

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:46.610 
three Barb's per side so the 42 is the

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.840 
three Barb's per side so the 42 is the
finest<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:47.760> your<00:00:47.910> 36<00:00:48.329> is<00:00:48.600> your<00:00:49.129> thickest<00:00:50.129> and

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
finest and your 36 is your thickest and

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.160 
finest and your 36 is your thickest and
you<00:00:50.969> can<00:00:51.120> really<00:00:51.360> see<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.600> difference<00:00:51.719> there

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
you can really see the difference there

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.819 
you can really see the difference there
and<00:00:53.930> then<00:00:55.039> there's<00:00:56.039> also<00:00:56.370> forked<00:00:57.000> as<00:00:57.149> well

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:57.829 
and then there's also forked as well

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:01.700 
and then there's also forked as well
which<00:00:58.829> is<00:00:59.930> they<00:01:00.930> take<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.170> while<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.410> get<00:01:01.649> down

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
which is they take a while to get down

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.650 
which is they take a while to get down
get<00:01:02.100> used<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.460> using<00:01:02.640> but<00:01:02.969> once<00:01:03.239> you<00:01:03.359> get<00:01:03.510> the

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
get used to using but once you get the

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.750 
get used to using but once you get the
result<00:01:04.019> now<00:01:04.920> once<00:01:05.129> you<00:01:05.220> get<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.400> hang<00:01:05.430> of<00:01:05.640> it

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
result now once you get the hang of it

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.750 
result now once you get the hang of it
so<00:01:05.970> you<00:01:06.150> do<00:01:06.270> get<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.630> good<00:01:07.020> result<00:01:07.490> and<00:01:08.490> it<00:01:08.640> is

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
so you do get the good result and it is

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.649 
so you do get the good result and it is
a<00:01:08.820> lot<00:01:09.090> finer<00:01:09.360> than<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:10.729> ultras<00:01:11.729> or<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.360> 42

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
a lot finer than the ultras or the 42

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.020 
a lot finer than the ultras or the 42
options<00:01:13.170> so<00:01:13.380> so<00:01:13.950> basically<00:01:14.310> with<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.640> ultras

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
options so so basically with the ultras

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.200 
options so so basically with the ultras

just want to show you the difference and

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.149 
just want to show you the difference and
the<00:01:47.490> fort<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.780> fort<00:01:49.049> don't<00:01:49.799> have<00:01:49.979> any

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
the fort and the fort don't have any

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.200 
the fort and the fort don't have any
Barb's<00:01:50.840> they've<00:01:51.840> got<00:01:52.020> a<00:01:52.049> little<00:01:52.970> slot<00:01:53.970> that

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
Barb's they've got a little slot that

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.840 
Barb's they've got a little slot that
you<00:01:54.360> sort<00:01:54.630> of<00:01:54.659> got<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:54.869> catch<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.229> herring<00:01:55.850> and

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
you sort of got to catch the herring and

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.850 
you sort of got to catch the herring and
it<00:01:57.149> only<00:01:57.240> works<00:01:57.540> one<00:01:57.780> way<00:01:57.810> so<00:01:58.020> it<00:01:58.560> takes<00:01:58.770> a

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
it only works one way so it takes a

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.399 
it only works one way so it takes a
while<00:01:59.009> to<00:01:59.040> get<00:01:59.280> used<00:01:59.460> to<00:01:59.549> but<00:02:00.110> you<00:02:01.110> can<00:02:01.259> get<00:02:01.380> a

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
while to get used to but you can get a

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.800 
while to get used to but you can get a
really<00:02:01.710> really<00:02:02.159> fine<00:02:02.340> effect<00:02:05.450> okay<00:02:06.450> so<00:02:06.509> that's

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
really really fine effect okay so that's

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.540 
really really fine effect okay so that's
basically<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:07.320> hare<00:02:07.619> results<00:02:08.129> or<00:02:08.340> the

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
basically the hare results or the

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.900 
basically the hare results or the
filtering<00:02:09.209> needles<00:02:09.539> and<00:02:09.750> just<00:02:10.610> to<00:02:11.610> sort<00:02:11.849> of

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
filtering needles and just to sort of

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.430 
filtering needles and just to sort of
give<00:02:12.090> you<00:02:12.180> an<00:02:12.300> idea<00:02:12.450> of

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
give you an idea of

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.900 
give you an idea of
the<00:02:13.590> different<00:02:13.920> results<00:02:14.340> that<00:02:14.460> you<00:02:14.580> can<00:02:14.700> get

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
the different results that you can get

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.580 
the different results that you can get
from<00:02:16.490> then<00:02:17.490> I<00:02:17.610> also<00:02:18.080> thought<00:02:19.080> I'd<00:02:19.260> show<00:02:19.560> you

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590
