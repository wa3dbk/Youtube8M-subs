00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 hi guys we each saw such 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.160
 remote controlled helicopters 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.200
 they are everywhere they are cool we are in the laboratory 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.120
 jet motion can thought 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.920
 be such a helicopter fly on mars so 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:21.240
 what is this topic of today's release crazy 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:23.640
 engineering why we needed 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.470
 helicopters on mars let me tell you 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.480
 rover now I can not see the terrain 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.949
 behind me if i had a helicopter 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.019
 with the camera I could see a lot 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.239
 more if each of ours 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.430
 rovers was a helicopter with cameras which 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.260
 discovered tall objects it would give 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.550
 we are able to control the rover 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.020
 much more effectively you would think that 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.309
 Mars is much easier to manage 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.530
 by helicopter because gravity 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.149
 is only three eighths of the earth but 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.670
 the atmosphere there is more discharged 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.410
 The principle of operation of any helicopter is 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.539
 in that in the blades of the helicopter rotate 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.579
 and create lift storm density 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.590
 atmosphere with a decrease in density is necessary 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.899
 accelerate the rotation to increase the blades or 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.460
 make the helicopter easier as we solve this 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.309
 problem to send him to mars 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.380
 ask the expert what can be done by 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.680
 I found mine and in this bob say on what 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.600
 stage we are now this is one of 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.280
 our laboratories can see one here 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.740
 of the models we work on in 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.030
 life size 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.350
 what obstacles need to be overcome 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.689
 to create lift we 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.680
 surface look it is low 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.540
 atmosphere density 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.340
 this is the need to create a small 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.810
 systems so as not to overload the device 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:34.680
 autonomy for the device itself to perform 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.270
 stable flights and these are permanent 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.750
 takeoffs and landings on such 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.340
 natural stony surface but rather 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.130
 still he must survive in a harsh climate 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.259
 Mars so that we are only at the initial 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.390
 stages of designing this thing are 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.520
 tests you already conducted her results 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.680
 got all last year we spent 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.970
 25 foot vacuum chamber tests 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.460
 using a full-size model 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.750
 and the rarefied atmosphere of mars studying 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.579
 lift here of this nonsense 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.299
 how quickly they need to handle 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:06.270
 to produce this force around 2400 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.799
 rpm can tell 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.950
 a little about the possibilities of the helicopter on 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.980
 mars the system is programmed us two 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.299
 three minutes of flight every day 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.829
 top is a solar panel 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:19.579
 which will provide the apparatus 

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:21.989
 energy for these flights and warm at night 

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:25.680
 for these two three minutes we count 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:27.510
 fly about half a kilometer what's next 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.549
 how do we prepare this thing for the future 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.170
 missions since it will take off and 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:32.819
 sit down every day we want to do 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.950
 reliable landing system since 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:37.530
 landing is the most dangerous part of any 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.720
 the mission for landing the rover was 7 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.939
 minute horror we will have 7 such 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.159
 seconds every day thank you so much 

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:45.720
 Here for information about the helicopter I hope 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:48.420
 you were just as fun as we are today 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.790
