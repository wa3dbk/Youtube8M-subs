00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:05.920 

all<00:00:03.080> of<00:00:03.230> these<00:00:03.350> exercises<00:00:03.650> are<00:00:04.630> designed<00:00:05.630> to

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:05.930 
all of these exercises are designed to

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.100 
all of these exercises are designed to
increase<00:00:06.890> the<00:00:07.190> lateral<00:00:07.550> flexibility<00:00:08.270> of<00:00:08.510> the

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:09.110 
increase the lateral flexibility of the

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.279 
increase the lateral flexibility of the
horse<00:00:09.350> and<00:00:10.000> if<00:00:11.000> the<00:00:11.209> horse<00:00:11.360> is<00:00:11.600> more<00:00:11.750> flexible

00:00:12.279 --> 00:00:12.289 
horse and if the horse is more flexible

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:14.049 
horse and if the horse is more flexible
laterally<00:00:12.830> it<00:00:13.070> also<00:00:13.280> increases<00:00:13.850> their

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:14.059 
laterally it also increases their

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:17.109 
laterally it also increases their
longitudinal<00:00:14.719> flexibility<00:00:15.350> so<00:00:16.039> one<00:00:16.910> of<00:00:16.940> the

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:17.119 
longitudinal flexibility so one of the

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:19.660 
longitudinal flexibility so one of the
easiest<00:00:17.510> places<00:00:18.170> to<00:00:18.349> start<00:00:18.740> is<00:00:19.039> just<00:00:19.340> standing

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:19.670 
easiest places to start is just standing

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.560 
easiest places to start is just standing
on<00:00:19.759> the<00:00:19.820> ground<00:00:20.119> and<00:00:20.800> asking<00:00:21.800> the<00:00:21.890> horse<00:00:22.099> to

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:22.570 
on the ground and asking the horse to

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.359 
on the ground and asking the horse to
yield<00:00:23.570> to<00:00:23.779> the<00:00:23.869> pressure<00:00:24.140> of<00:00:24.289> the<00:00:24.380> rein<00:00:24.650> as<00:00:25.130> you

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:25.369 
yield to the pressure of the rein as you

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:28.570 
yield to the pressure of the rein as you
turn<00:00:25.609> his<00:00:25.759> head<00:00:25.970> in<00:00:26.359> your<00:00:26.900> direction<00:00:27.580> toward

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:28.580 
turn his head in your direction toward

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.519 
turn his head in your direction toward
where<00:00:28.699> you're<00:00:28.820> standing<00:00:29.330> and<00:00:29.509> what<00:00:30.410> we're

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:30.529 
where you're standing and what we're

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:32.920 
where you're standing and what we're
looking<00:00:30.800> for<00:00:30.830> is<00:00:31.099> for<00:00:31.310> the<00:00:31.429> horse<00:00:31.669> to<00:00:32.029> turn<00:00:32.750> his

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
looking for is for the horse to turn his

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.130 
looking for is for the horse to turn his
head<00:00:33.110> nough<00:00:33.290> snack<00:00:33.590> easily<00:00:34.280> and<00:00:34.520> also<00:00:35.140> chew

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
head nough snack easily and also chew

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.280 
head nough snack easily and also chew
the<00:00:36.710> bit<00:00:36.920> because<00:00:37.190> if<00:00:37.430> his<00:00:37.580> jaw<00:00:37.850> becomes<00:00:38.360> soft

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
the bit because if his jaw becomes soft

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.470 
the bit because if his jaw becomes soft
and<00:00:39.560> chewing<00:00:39.830> the<00:00:39.950> bit<00:00:40.130> then<00:00:40.490> the<00:00:41.000> rest<00:00:41.210> of<00:00:41.360> his

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
and chewing the bit then the rest of his

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.240 
and chewing the bit then the rest of his
body<00:00:41.510> also<00:00:42.020> is<00:00:42.350> going<00:00:42.530> to<00:00:42.620> tend<00:00:42.830> to<00:00:42.950> be<00:00:43.070> more

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
body also is going to tend to be more

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.310 
body also is going to tend to be more
relaxed<00:00:43.700> it's<00:00:43.820> very<00:00:44.030> difficult<00:00:44.510> to<00:00:45.080> see<00:00:45.290> a

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
relaxed it's very difficult to see a

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.230 
relaxed it's very difficult to see a
horse<00:00:45.650> that<00:00:45.830> has<00:00:45.890> a<00:00:46.040> nice<00:00:46.310> softly<00:00:46.910> chewing

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:47.240 
horse that has a nice softly chewing

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.970 
horse that has a nice softly chewing
mouth<00:00:47.450> that<00:00:47.690> has<00:00:47.840> a<00:00:47.900> stiff<00:00:48.170> body<00:00:48.500> the<00:00:48.830> two

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 
mouth that has a stiff body the two

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.810 
mouth that has a stiff body the two
things<00:00:49.250> are<00:00:49.460> sort<00:00:49.700> of<00:00:49.760> incongruent<00:00:51.430> so<00:00:52.430> that's

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
things are sort of incongruent so that's

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.250 
things are sort of incongruent so that's
a<00:00:52.940> great<00:00:53.120> place<00:00:53.360> to<00:00:53.390> start<00:00:53.720> and<00:00:53.930> you<00:00:53.990> would<00:00:54.140> be

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
a great place to start and you would be

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.780 
a great place to start and you would be
surprised<00:00:54.710> because<00:00:56.500> some<00:00:57.500> horses<00:00:58.010> that's<00:00:58.580> a

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:58.790 
surprised because some horses that's a

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.780 
surprised because some horses that's a
major<00:00:59.090> ordeal<00:00:59.600> to<00:01:00.080> get<00:01:00.260> them<00:01:00.440> to<00:01:00.710> just<00:01:01.250> simply

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:01.790 
major ordeal to get them to just simply

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:03.430 
major ordeal to get them to just simply
turn<00:01:02.030> their<00:01:02.240> head<00:01:02.390> to<00:01:02.570> the<00:01:02.690> left<00:01:02.900> or<00:01:03.200> to<00:01:03.230> the

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:03.440 
turn their head to the left or to the

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.710 
turn their head to the left or to the
right<00:01:03.530> one<00:01:04.430> thing<00:01:04.610> we<00:01:04.790> agree<00:01:05.089> on<00:01:05.119> whether

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
right one thing we agree on whether

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.540 
right one thing we agree on whether
we're<00:01:05.900> riding<00:01:06.230> Western<00:01:06.830> or<00:01:07.130> whether<00:01:07.400> we're

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:07.550 
we're riding Western or whether we're

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.150 
we're riding Western or whether we're
riding<00:01:07.820> dressage<00:01:08.120> or<00:01:08.510> hunter/jumper<00:01:08.990> is<00:01:09.500> that

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:10.160 
riding dressage or hunter/jumper is that

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.670 
riding dressage or hunter/jumper is that
we<00:01:10.460> want<00:01:10.700> the<00:01:10.790> horse<00:01:11.000> to<00:01:11.060> be<00:01:11.440> flexible<00:01:12.440> and

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
we want the horse to be flexible and

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.470 
we want the horse to be flexible and
pliable<00:01:12.860> and<00:01:13.430> that<00:01:13.520> makes<00:01:13.880> them<00:01:14.030> easier<00:01:14.390> to

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:14.480 
pliable and that makes them easier to

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.060 
pliable and that makes them easier to
ride<00:01:15.380> and<00:01:15.770> and<00:01:16.120> much<00:01:17.120> more<00:01:17.300> enjoyable<00:01:17.570> to<00:01:17.870> ride

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
ride and and much more enjoyable to ride

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.950 
ride and and much more enjoyable to ride
and<00:01:19.070> then<00:01:19.340> you<00:01:19.880> would<00:01:20.030> also<00:01:20.060> want<00:01:20.570> to<00:01:20.630> do<00:01:20.810> that

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
and then you would also want to do that

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.860 
and then you would also want to do that
while<00:01:21.140> you're<00:01:21.260> mounted<00:01:21.680> and<00:01:22.270> it's<00:01:23.270> important

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:23.870 
while you're mounted and it's important

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.440 
while you're mounted and it's important
that<00:01:23.960> you<00:01:24.409> put<00:01:24.650> an<00:01:24.890> elastic<00:01:25.190> pressure<00:01:25.820> on<00:01:26.180> the

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
that you put an elastic pressure on the

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.570 
that you put an elastic pressure on the
rein<00:01:26.630> little<00:01:27.080> giving<00:01:27.440> and<00:01:27.590> taking<00:01:27.740> massaging

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580 
rein little giving and taking massaging

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:29.830 
rein little giving and taking massaging
the<00:01:28.700> rein<00:01:28.880> sort<00:01:29.300> of<00:01:29.360> like<00:01:29.510> you're<00:01:29.690> squeezing

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
the rein sort of like you're squeezing

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.430 
the rein sort of like you're squeezing
juice<00:01:30.320> out<00:01:30.620> of<00:01:30.740> an<00:01:30.830> orange<00:01:32.020> so<00:01:33.020> that<00:01:33.050> it's

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:33.440 
juice out of an orange so that it's

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.140 
juice out of an orange so that it's
inviting<00:01:34.010> for<00:01:34.190> the<00:01:34.250> horse<00:01:34.430> to<00:01:34.640> yield<00:01:34.670> to<00:01:35.000> that

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
inviting for the horse to yield to that

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.840 
inviting for the horse to yield to that
pressure<00:01:35.680> it's<00:01:36.680> important<00:01:37.370> that<00:01:37.550> you<00:01:37.670> don't

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
pressure it's important that you don't

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.300 
pressure it's important that you don't
for<00:01:38.540> instance<00:01:38.930> take<00:01:39.260> the<00:01:39.409> rein<00:01:39.620> and<00:01:39.650> if<00:01:40.159> you

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
for instance take the rein and if you

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.760 
for instance take the rein and if you
meet<00:01:40.670> resistance<00:01:40.850> from<00:01:41.360> the<00:01:41.510> horse<00:01:41.750> say<00:01:42.260> okay

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
meet resistance from the horse say okay

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.770 
meet resistance from the horse say okay
and<00:01:43.159> I'll<00:01:43.490> just<00:01:43.520> take<00:01:43.909> this<00:01:44.090> rein<00:01:44.360> and<00:01:44.540> crank

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
and I'll just take this rein and crank

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.510 
and I'll just take this rein and crank
it<00:01:44.900> around<00:01:45.170> the<00:01:45.320> backside<00:01:45.530> of<00:01:45.920> my<00:01:46.070> knee<00:01:46.130> and

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
it around the backside of my knee and

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.539 
it around the backside of my knee and
say<00:01:46.700> you<00:01:47.180> have<00:01:47.360> to<00:01:47.540> give<00:01:47.720> because<00:01:48.440> we<00:01:48.890> we<00:01:49.310> want

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 
say you have to give because we we want

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:51.370 
say you have to give because we we want
the<00:01:49.700> horse<00:01:49.940> to<00:01:50.030> understand<00:01:50.780> that<00:01:50.960> if<00:01:51.140> they

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
the horse to understand that if they

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.410 
the horse to understand that if they
yield<00:01:51.710> to<00:01:51.920> the<00:01:52.010> pressure<00:01:52.280> then<00:01:53.000> the<00:01:53.150> pressure

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
yield to the pressure then the pressure

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.230 
yield to the pressure then the pressure
will<00:01:53.780> release<00:01:54.470> so<00:01:55.130> the<00:01:55.310> goal<00:01:55.520> is<00:01:55.790> is<00:01:56.000> to<00:01:56.030> be

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
will release so the goal is is to be
