00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.850
 more gopro tips and tricks video 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.250
 from me today I'll show you the we 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.019
 gopro can disable at the leds 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.969
 have fun that is a very natural 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.799
 Function if you for example by 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.500
 a glass or a glass 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.359
 Windscreen on the eye films and if 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.529
 you yes then the video starts then 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.140
 yes lights up here 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.410
 the red led or both if you 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.490
 just wlan have activated and then 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.750
 you see through the 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.570
 windshield or through the 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.730
 glass pane that lights the red led 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.320
 or blinking and if you then 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.360
 then you can hardly see it deactivated 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.829
 that you are filming through a glass pane 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.170
 and that's why it's a whole 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.940
 useful feature now i'll show you 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.450
 but first how the function 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.670
 activates the leds deactivated and 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.030
 you have to here in the settings 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:54.780
 first go and then you 'll get there 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:57.149
 until you are on the button setup 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:02.100
 Then you get in and then again 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:04.589
 Here you will be led and then once 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.360
 Here you can see the choice you already 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.060
 can activate four leds that is then 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.030
 so here all the gopro has all 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.909
 you activate leds then you can 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.530
 activate two leds and you can 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.509
 Turn off LEDs completely 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.130
 but we want it now completely 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.130
 exceptions and we click here above 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.740
 on the record button and confirm that 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.460
 whole with it and then we can sometimes 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:33.090
 start short video and then we'll see 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.610
 here too if it's the gopro 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.100
 takes up the then no led flashing 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.600
 yes I hope you like the video 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.920
 and if that is then I would 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.710
 happy if you subscribe to the 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.000
 button would be and a thumb 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.310

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.280

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.659
