00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 
use about five tracks so I start really

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:57.750

low<00:00:54.440> my<00:00:55.190> first<00:00:55.460> part<00:00:55.760> will<00:00:55.940> be<00:00:55.969> the<00:00:56.300> lowest<00:00:56.589> and

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
low my first part will be the lowest and

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:05.079 
low my first part will be the lowest and
then<00:00:58.760> I<00:00:58.789> grab<00:00:59.469> the<00:01:00.469> shorter<00:01:02.230> pieces<00:01:03.879> that<00:01:04.879> have

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
then I grab the shorter pieces that have

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:11.260 
then I grab the shorter pieces that have
the<00:01:05.210> three<00:01:05.510> Clips<00:01:06.670> first<00:01:07.670> and<00:01:09.010> what<00:01:10.010> I<00:01:10.040> do<00:01:10.190> is<00:01:10.700> I

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
the three Clips first and what I do is I

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.770 
the three Clips first and what I do is I
kind<00:01:12.080> of<00:01:12.260> knot<00:01:12.830> it<00:01:13.040> into<00:01:13.460> my<00:01:13.640> hair<00:01:13.970> so<00:01:14.570> that<00:01:14.720> it

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
kind of knot it into my hair so that it

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.220 
kind of knot it into my hair so that it
doesn't<00:01:15.110> fall<00:01:15.920> out

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:17.230 
doesn't fall out

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.750 
doesn't fall out
so<00:01:18.070> just<00:01:18.280> like<00:01:18.400> a<00:01:18.430> circular<00:01:19.000> motion<00:01:19.210> I<00:01:20.760> clip

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:21.760 
so just like a circular motion I clip

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:29.030 
so just like a circular motion I clip
that<00:01:21.970> in<00:01:22.210> and<00:01:22.450> I<00:01:22.540> just<00:01:22.720> do<00:01:22.930> that<00:01:23.050> all<00:01:23.380> around

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.630 

and<00:01:31.290> which<00:01:32.290> you<00:01:32.320> could<00:01:32.620> do<00:01:32.800> them<00:01:33.070> to<00:01:33.340> make<00:01:33.490> the

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
and which you could do them to make the

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.310 
and which you could do them to make the
process<00:01:33.820> faster<00:01:34.660> is<00:01:36.060> I<00:01:37.060> have<00:01:37.240> my<00:01:37.480> curling<00:01:38.080> wand

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
process faster is I have my curling wand

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.360 
process faster is I have my curling wand
here<00:01:38.620> and<00:01:38.950> I'll<00:01:39.370> just<00:01:39.610> curl<00:01:39.970> every<00:01:41.160> track<00:01:42.160> I

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:42.370 
here and I'll just curl every track I

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:48.300 
here and I'll just curl every track I

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
as I go so i'll leave it for about 10

00:01:52.780 --> 00:02:01.020 
as I go so i'll leave it for about 10

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.910 

so<00:02:02.030> now<00:02:02.149> for<00:02:02.180> the<00:02:02.479> longer<00:02:02.780> pieces<00:02:02.990> which<00:02:03.560> are

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
so now for the longer pieces which are

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.830 
so now for the longer pieces which are
the<00:02:04.280> four<00:02:04.990> clips<00:02:06.579> i<00:02:07.579> usually<00:02:08.360> use<00:02:08.390> them<00:02:08.660> for

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
the four clips i usually use them for

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.199 
the four clips i usually use them for
the<00:02:08.959> top<00:02:09.170> section<00:02:09.470> so<00:02:10.039> that<00:02:10.069> i<00:02:10.550> can<00:02:10.700> help<00:02:11.120> the

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
the top section so that i can help the

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:13.000 
the top section so that i can help the
front<00:02:11.569> of<00:02:11.690> my<00:02:11.840> hair<00:02:12.080> blend<00:02:12.319> in<00:02:12.500> better<00:02:12.709> with

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
front of my hair blend in better with

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.880 
front of my hair blend in better with
the<00:02:13.310> extension<00:02:14.620> so<00:02:15.620> what<00:02:15.830> I<00:02:15.860> do<00:02:15.980> is<00:02:17.349> now<00:02:18.349> I<00:02:18.410> part

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
the extension so what I do is now I part

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:31.199 
the extension so what I do is now I part
it<00:02:19.069> from<00:02:19.519> a<00:02:19.880> little<00:02:20.450> above<00:02:20.900> my<00:02:20.959> ear<00:02:23.080> all<00:02:24.080> around

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:34.660 

so<00:02:32.209> the<00:02:32.569> first<00:02:32.810> clip<00:02:33.230> i<00:02:33.499> will<00:02:33.769> put<00:02:33.980> right<00:02:34.340> above

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
so the first clip i will put right above

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:41.880 
so the first clip i will put right above
my<00:02:34.909> ear<00:02:36.489> circular<00:02:37.489> motion

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.930 

and<00:02:42.240> then<00:02:43.240> the<00:02:43.420> last<00:02:43.950> clip<00:02:44.950> usually<00:02:45.520> just<00:02:45.700> goes

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
and then the last clip usually just goes

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.130 
and then the last clip usually just goes
halfway<00:02:46.830> between<00:02:47.830> my<00:02:48.130> head<00:02:48.400> so<00:02:48.880> what<00:02:49.780> I<00:02:49.810> do<00:02:49.959> is

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
halfway between my head so what I do is

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.920 
halfway between my head so what I do is
I<00:02:50.800> keep<00:02:51.190> the<00:02:51.430> part<00:02:51.670> this<00:02:51.850> part<00:02:52.000> and<00:02:52.510> then<00:02:52.750> I

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
I keep the part this part and then I

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:59.360 
I keep the part this part and then I
just<00:02:53.110> add<00:02:53.319> a<00:02:53.350> little<00:02:53.470> more<00:02:53.860> hair<00:02:54.100> in<00:02:54.220> the<00:02:54.340> back

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.520 

now<00:02:59.909> this<00:03:00.060> is<00:03:00.269> my<00:03:00.450> way<00:03:00.659> I<00:03:00.900> mean<00:03:01.080> of<00:03:01.200> course<00:03:01.230> you

00:03:12.339 --> 00:03:12.349 
these 22 inches are such a difference i

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:16.130 
these 22 inches are such a difference i
also<00:03:13.349> have<00:03:13.650> a<00:03:13.680> smaller<00:03:14.129> track<00:03:14.519> so<00:03:14.989> because<00:03:15.989> it

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
also have a smaller track so because it

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.899 
also have a smaller track so because it
comes<00:03:16.349> with<00:03:16.470> in<00:03:16.799> that<00:03:17.129> hair<00:03:17.400> that<00:03:17.610> you<00:03:17.640> have

00:03:17.899 --> 00:03:17.909 
comes with in that hair that you have

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:19.520 
comes with in that hair that you have
the<00:03:18.090> option<00:03:18.269> to<00:03:18.540> choose<00:03:18.959> if<00:03:19.140> you<00:03:19.170> want<00:03:19.260> to<00:03:19.440> use

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
the option to choose if you want to use

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.509 
the option to choose if you want to use
all<00:03:19.680> of<00:03:19.799> it<00:03:19.860> or<00:03:19.980> not<00:03:20.129> I<00:03:20.400> usually<00:03:21.299> look<00:03:21.569> at<00:03:22.519> how

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
all of it or not I usually look at how

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:26.809 
all of it or not I usually look at how
much<00:03:23.790> my<00:03:24.120> hair<00:03:24.390> blends<00:03:24.690> in<00:03:25.110> and<00:03:25.430> if<00:03:26.430> I<00:03:26.579> feel

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:26.819 
much my hair blends in and if I feel

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:29.330 
much my hair blends in and if I feel
like<00:03:27.000> I<00:03:27.299> could<00:03:27.720> use<00:03:27.959> a<00:03:28.019> little<00:03:28.319> more<00:03:28.590> here<00:03:28.980> I'll

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
like I could use a little more here I'll

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.180 
like I could use a little more here I'll
probably<00:03:29.700> put<00:03:29.970> the<00:03:30.090> two<00:03:30.299> clips<00:03:30.569> in<00:03:30.930> to<00:03:31.799> the<00:03:32.069> way

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
probably put the two clips in to the way

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.460 
probably put the two clips in to the way
back<00:03:32.459> but<00:03:32.910> because<00:03:33.450> I<00:03:33.629> feel<00:03:33.870> like<00:03:33.900> this<00:03:34.290> is

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
back but because I feel like this is

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.710 
back but because I feel like this is
enough<00:03:34.769> I'm<00:03:35.609> not<00:03:35.849> going<00:03:36.000> to<00:03:36.090> do<00:03:36.239> that<00:03:36.269> so<00:03:36.660> you

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
enough I'm not going to do that so you

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.440 
enough I'm not going to do that so you
don't<00:03:36.959> need<00:03:37.079> to<00:03:37.140> over<00:03:37.650> clip<00:03:38.579> your<00:03:38.609> hair<00:03:39.030> you

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
don't need to over clip your hair you

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.009 
don't need to over clip your hair you
want<00:03:39.569> to<00:03:39.720> make<00:03:39.840> sure<00:03:39.870> it's<00:03:40.170> comfortable<00:03:40.410> and

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
want to make sure it's comfortable and

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:45.110 
want to make sure it's comfortable and
nothing<00:03:43.019> peeks<00:03:43.739> out<00:03:43.980> you<00:03:44.790> know<00:03:44.879> because

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
nothing peeks out you know because

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.099 
nothing peeks out you know because
that's<00:03:45.269> the<00:03:45.420> probably<00:03:45.840> the<00:03:45.900> most

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:46.109 
that's the probably the most

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:47.750 
that's the probably the most
embarrassing<00:03:46.620> thing<00:03:46.799> that<00:03:46.829> can<00:03:47.129> happen<00:03:47.159> so

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
embarrassing thing that can happen so

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.300 
embarrassing thing that can happen so
what<00:03:48.599> I'm<00:03:48.690> going<00:03:48.840> to<00:03:48.900> do<00:03:49.140> last<00:03:49.500> after<00:03:50.010> all<00:03:50.159> the

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
what I'm going to do last after all the

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.250 
what I'm going to do last after all the
hairs<00:03:50.549> and<00:03:50.819> it's<00:03:51.060> probably<00:03:51.239> just<00:03:51.540> go<00:03:51.720> over<00:03:51.959> the

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
hairs and it's probably just go over the

00:03:52.260 --> 00:04:11.920 
hairs and it's probably just go over the
ends<00:03:52.620> of<00:03:52.799> my<00:03:52.829> real<00:03:53.250> hair
