cockpits that Louie no Lamar would be

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.300 
cockpits that Louie no Lamar would be
able<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.210> get<00:01:21.330> in<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:21.689> out<00:01:21.750> of<00:01:22.310> unfortunately

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
able to get in and out of unfortunately

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.780 
able to get in and out of unfortunately
a<00:01:23.640> combination<00:01:24.420> of<00:01:24.920> lacking<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.040> mechanisms

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
a combination of lacking the mechanisms

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.270 
a combination of lacking the mechanisms
and<00:01:27.210> there<00:01:27.689> was<00:01:27.810> really<00:01:28.259> long<00:01:28.590> antennas<00:01:29.130> on

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
and there was really long antennas on

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.219 
and there was really long antennas on
top<00:01:29.460> of<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.670> helmets<00:01:30.030> made<00:01:30.720> it<00:01:30.869> quite

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
top of the helmets made it quite

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.280 
top of the helmets made it quite
unfeasible<00:01:31.860> so<00:01:32.189> it<00:01:33.180> was<00:01:33.329> a<00:01:33.360> disappointment<00:01:33.990> to

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
unfeasible so it was a disappointment to

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.490 
unfeasible so it was a disappointment to
me<00:01:34.500> but<00:01:34.950> it<00:01:35.520> had<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:36.119> become<00:01:36.750> just<00:01:36.960> a<00:01:37.110> display

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500

item that's that's sad the walls of the

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.700 
item that's that's sad the walls of the
cockpits<00:01:44.310> are<00:01:44.490> made<00:01:44.640> out<00:01:44.759> of<00:01:44.790> poster<00:01:45.270> board

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
material which is durable and flexible

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.260 
material which is durable and flexible
and<00:01:49.310> provides<00:01:50.310> good<00:01:50.460> structural<00:01:50.880> support

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
and provides good structural support

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.010 
and provides good structural support
inside<00:01:51.570> it<00:01:52.079> it<00:01:52.710> works<00:01:52.920> it<00:01:53.189> works<00:01:53.430> quite<00:01:53.939> well

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
inside it it works it works quite well

actually<00:01:58.020> held<00:01:58.350> together<00:01:58.500> by<00:01:58.710> quite<00:01:59.130> a<00:01:59.159> lot<00:01:59.280> of

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
actually held together by quite a lot of

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.139 
actually held together by quite a lot of
hot<00:01:59.579> glue<00:01:59.820> I<00:02:00.740> I<00:02:01.740> have<00:02:02.040> a<00:02:02.070> recent<00:02:02.549> convert<00:02:02.969> to

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
hot glue I I have a recent convert to

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.330 
hot glue I I have a recent convert to
the<00:02:03.270> greatness<00:02:03.600> that<00:02:03.780> is<00:02:03.930> hot<00:02:04.290> glue<00:02:04.590> and<00:02:04.890> I

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
the greatness that is hot glue and I

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.520 
the greatness that is hot glue and I
find<00:02:05.640> that<00:02:05.759> it<00:02:05.969> is<00:02:06.090> extremely<00:02:06.780> useful<00:02:06.990> and

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530

with some nice craft foam which makes it

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.690 
with some nice craft foam which makes it
look<00:02:15.230> a<00:02:15.350> lot<00:02:15.470> smoother<00:02:15.980> and<00:02:16.160> matches<00:02:16.520> the

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
look a lot smoother and matches the

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.660 
look a lot smoother and matches the
rocket<00:02:17.540> a<00:02:17.600> lot<00:02:17.750> better<00:02:17.990> and<00:02:18.290> then<00:02:19.070> added<00:02:19.550> the

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
rocket a lot better and then added the

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.480 
rocket a lot better and then added the
floor<00:02:20.030> the<00:02:20.300> cockpits<00:02:20.840> and<00:02:20.990> the<00:02:21.170> fins<00:02:21.500> using

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
floor the cockpits and the fins using

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.600 
floor the cockpits and the fins using
foam<00:02:22.850> board<00:02:23.180> material<00:02:23.780> the<00:02:24.380> two<00:02:24.800> chairs<00:02:25.220> are

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
foam board material the two chairs are

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.390 
foam board material the two chairs are
made<00:02:25.640> out<00:02:26.000> of<00:02:26.030> polymer<00:02:26.510> clay<00:02:26.920> then<00:02:27.920> there<00:02:28.250> was

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
made out of polymer clay then there was

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.180 
made out of polymer clay then there was
some<00:02:28.550> fine<00:02:28.790> detailing<00:02:29.240> to<00:02:29.450> add<00:02:29.570> a<00:02:30.470> little<00:02:31.070> bit

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190

Christmas tree ornament which I cut in

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.040 
Christmas tree ornament which I cut in
half<00:02:36.800> makes<00:02:37.580> the<00:02:37.850> bubble<00:02:38.180> canopy<00:02:38.540> over<00:02:39.020> the

half makes the bubble canopy over the
cockpit<00:02:39.610> yes<00:02:40.610> because<00:02:40.820> everybody<00:02:41.240> likes

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
cockpit yes because everybody likes

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.750 
cockpit yes because everybody likes
bubble<00:02:41.840> canopies<00:02:42.320> but<00:02:42.920> not<00:02:43.100> many<00:02:43.250> people<00:02:43.460> put

bubble canopies but not many people put

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.940 
bubble canopies but not many people put
much<00:02:43.940> thought<00:02:43.970> into<00:02:44.180> how<00:02:44.510> they're<00:02:44.720> made<00:02:44.950> the

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
much thought into how they're made the

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.130 
much thought into how they're made the
funnel<00:02:46.640> nose<00:02:46.850> cone<00:02:47.210> didn't<00:02:47.660> really<00:02:47.930> need<00:02:48.110> a

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
funnel nose cone didn't really need a

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.350 
funnel nose cone didn't really need a
lot<00:02:48.320> of<00:02:48.440> modification<00:02:49.190> I<00:02:49.430> just<00:02:49.700> had<00:02:49.850> to<00:02:50.000> stick

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
that the Pikmin rocket has in pictures

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.420 
that the Pikmin rocket has in pictures
so<00:03:41.900> let's<00:03:42.620> see<00:03:42.920> what<00:03:43.070> it<00:03:43.160> looks<00:03:43.310> like

little propeller assembly in the top

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:46.960 
little propeller assembly in the top
would<00:04:45.560> search<00:04:45.710> the<00:04:45.740> spinach<00:04:46.130> then<00:04:46.310> spin<00:04:46.700> and

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
would search the spinach then spin and

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:55.030 
would search the spinach then spin and
then<00:04:47.740> to<00:04:48.740> dupe<00:04:49.490> you<00:04:49.670> could<00:04:53.200> use<00:04:54.200> it<00:04:54.350> and<00:04:54.650> there

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.040

nose<00:04:58.280> cone<00:04:58.570> pulled<00:04:59.570> off<00:04:59.750> with<00:04:59.960> a<00:05:00.020> little<00:05:00.290> bit

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 
nose cone pulled off with a little bit

nose cone pulled off with a little bit
of<00:05:00.470> foam<00:05:00.890> craft<00:05:01.790> foam<00:05:01.970> material<00:05:02.150> and<00:05:02.920> this

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:03.920 
of foam craft foam material and this

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.440 
of foam craft foam material and this
thing<00:05:04.190> here<00:05:04.490> is<00:05:04.670> just<00:05:04.700> kind<00:05:05.030> of<00:05:05.060> balanced<00:05:05.360> up

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:05.450 
thing here is just kind of balanced up

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:06.450 
thing here is just kind of balanced up
there<00:05:05.600> so<00:05:05.720> it<00:05:05.840> can<00:05:05.930> rotate

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460 
there so it can rotate

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.000 
there so it can rotate
I<00:05:07.460> mean<00:05:08.420> I<00:05:08.480> wouldn't<00:05:08.720> exactly<00:05:08.810> spin<00:05:09.410> it<00:05:09.530> but<00:05:09.710> it

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.010 
I mean I wouldn't exactly spin it but it

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:12.520 
I mean I wouldn't exactly spin it but it
does<00:05:10.160> know<00:05:10.280> thing
