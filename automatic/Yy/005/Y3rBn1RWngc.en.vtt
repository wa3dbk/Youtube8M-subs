00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
this video which was very good I might

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.570 
this video which was very good I might

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
the regular mouth canning jars when the

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.560 
the regular mouth canning jars when the
wide<00:02:36.900> mouths<00:02:37.290> are<00:02:38.280> so<00:02:38.519> much<00:02:38.730> easier<00:02:38.910> to

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
wide mouths are so much easier to

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.539 
wide mouths are so much easier to
maneuver<00:02:40.230> and<00:02:40.470> clean<00:02:40.769> after<00:02:41.040> you're<00:02:41.370> finished

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:41.549 
maneuver and clean after you're finished

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:44.360 
maneuver and clean after you're finished
canning<00:02:42.209> and<00:02:42.410> I<00:02:43.410> said<00:02:43.680> Wow

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.340 
canning and I said Wow
well<00:02:44.670> I<00:02:44.970> guess<00:02:45.450> a<00:02:45.540> lot<00:02:45.690> of<00:02:45.810> people<00:02:46.049> don't<00:02:46.170> know

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
well I guess a lot of people don't know

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
well I guess a lot of people don't know
about<00:02:46.519> this<00:02:47.810> usage<00:02:48.810> of<00:02:48.989> it<00:02:49.140> and<00:02:49.560> I<00:02:50.040> thought<00:02:50.190> I'd

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.030

work with this

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:22.580 
work with this
like<00:03:19.810> the<00:03:19.989> blender<00:03:20.349> for<00:03:20.739> this<00:03:20.939> for<00:03:21.939> this

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
like the blender for this for this

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.990 
like the blender for this for this
blender<00:03:23.590> here<00:03:23.920> the<00:03:24.250> attachment<00:03:24.819> to<00:03:24.909> the

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
blender here the attachment to the

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.860 
blender here the attachment to the
bottom<00:03:25.299> is<00:03:25.480> much<00:03:26.079> wider<00:03:26.879> so<00:03:27.879> it<00:03:27.909> will<00:03:28.329> not<00:03:28.540> fit

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
bottom is much wider so it will not fit

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.149 
bottom is much wider so it will not fit
on<00:03:28.900> this<00:03:29.230> properly<00:03:29.620> or<00:03:30.340> at<00:03:30.730> all<00:03:31.290> so<00:03:32.290> just<00:03:33.099> a

00:03:33.149 --> 00:03:33.159
