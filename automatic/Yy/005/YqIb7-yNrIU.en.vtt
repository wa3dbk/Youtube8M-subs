00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:07.020
 for all of us today we are in a new 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.910
 video together the dip de l'orÃ©al paris in 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.849
 that we are going to teach how to make a braid 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.099
 around the head with scraps 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.379
 of gender to prepare the hair let's go 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.020
 to use a serum in this case in the 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:22.230
 total operation 5 be a repairman of the 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:26.210
 bid to seal the tips let's go 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.210
 just apply a click 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.570
 first we are going to rub our hands to 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.170
 heat and activate the product and what 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.850
 we are going to achieve is that precisely 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.280
 ends or tips of the braid that the 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.190
 more prepared and with the tips less 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.949
 outwards everything will be neater 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.840
 the second step is to split the 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:52.040
 half the next step do two 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.140
 braids one on each side 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:57.230
 and the important thing is that the tenure that 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:00.620
 of this one not above the ear but rather 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:03.520
 just back well stuck let's go squeezing 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.520
 as we go 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.360
 going forward 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.220
 I stayed very firm 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.800
 when we get to the end of the braid 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.560
 what we are going to do is fix the one mini 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.870
 elastic once we have both 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:21.140
 texas braids what we are going to do is 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:23.480
 cross the all of the head I'm going to 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.280
 take one 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:28.470
 and will deliver the ear 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.640
 taking care that this one belongs I got up 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.920
 a lot crossed done bent and in a way 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.070
 that you do not notice the pinches in the 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:42.180
 hair is to take some hair 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:45.060
 like that and then I'm going to turn to the side 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.790
 opposite inward 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.790
 Oh 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:52.310
 I'm going to cross the second braid then 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.920
 I'm going to do the same thing that I did before I go 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.920
 to put pinches 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.920
 we're 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:05.870
 and this mix what I have left here 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.909
 hide inside 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:10.489
 I'm going to put there 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:12.050
 I will not insure once again 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:14.480
 finished the braid what we are going to do 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.830
 that's giving it a little bit because if it 's I have 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.840
 which is very sweet we do not want it to be 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.890
 see very rigid I am using the 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.890
 fingers let's start 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.030
 to jump 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:29.030
 when I open a bit the tension to 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:31.430
 chop the hairs front and back 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.250
 let's use a lacquer in this case 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:37.879
 the invisible and this of country glory 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:40.659
 what I'm going to do is comb directly 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:40.659
 here the hair 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.819
 back we're going to do the same thing we're going to 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.870
 put a little lacquer 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:50.940
 and let's avenge 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.940
 and I tell them following you have and now the 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.319
 box is watching and using well 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.120
 after a very soft effect 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:58.950
 work the frizz of the experts that 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.840
 are left up in the braid we are going to 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:06.569
 use the serum of the intense list bid 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:09.000
 anti frizz this will be used this 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:10.829
 special anti trees so it's going to 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.230
 help a lot for what I want to fulfill 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:14.940
 which is that I lower my hairs in 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.190
 Any case that you use before 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.019
 serves us good is the finished look 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.459
 after it has gone down a bit 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:22.859
 written and now what I'm going to do is 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:25.410
 give another touch optionally for 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:26.879
 who want to put a little color or a 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.440
 very different turn other than the 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:30.510
 diable hairstyle that I will do then 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:34.360
 is to take one of the brushes that 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:36.270
 we occupy what I am going to open 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:40.410
 and I'm going to 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:41.760
 interlacing a bit of tape or you can 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.100
 be a piece of gender that you 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.180
 have another type or something similar is a 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:49.000
 fish or wool can also be 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.250
 luisa like needles the important thing is that 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.560
 the piece of genre is half or more 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.329
 close to the closed part because if 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.909
 want to move the tip you can exit or 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:04:00.159
 even in real with a danger then 

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:02.640
 I'm going to take it from here and I'm going to 

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:05.010
 simply entwine what 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.020
 helping me with the same buildings that 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.490
 has the braid 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:11.720
 Y 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:11.720
 I'm going going 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.569
 the gender 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:32.900
 and we are going to put it with pinches in front of 

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:36.460
 the tense 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.460
 I take the piece of gender 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.760
 and with a prick 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.920
 I fix it 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:49.320
 well explain this original we hope 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:52.020
 that you liked, you can use it to 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:54.240
 lemon me if it's in a hairstyle that's coming 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.710
 much this much on the catwalk as well 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.100
 We hope you like it and we'll see you 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.100
 next 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.560
 do not
