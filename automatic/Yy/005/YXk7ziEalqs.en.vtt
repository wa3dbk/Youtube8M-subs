00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:08.280
 and that was not here in the kitchen with the 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.260
 arrival of winter changes our 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.820
 appetite and also we start to fancy 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.830
 dishes a little more robust 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.200
 including of course our meat 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.970
 and today we have a recipe that will leave 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.470
 all at home and you of course done 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.240
 when you fingers because it's super 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.520
 simple includes of course this 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.349
 wonderful ingredient that we have here 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.689
 at hand and it's going to be a steak in a 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:30.119
 cream sauce with a little sauce 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.970
 English and a black pepper that is going to 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.590
 give a spectacular touch a recipe that 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.090
 we see a lot in this season of 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.579
 year in many of the best 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.710
 restaurants of the world and I'm going to 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.559
 show how simple it can be like 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.480
 I always say the kitchen is simplicity 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.269
 because because the simpler 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.370
 we cook better results we tend to 

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:52.230
 have then think well what are we going 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.120
 to do is take a cut of meat 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.739
 I usually like to use a cut that does not 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.899
 have a lot of fat because 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.550
 remember that we are going to make a sauce 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.320
 cream base and as you know 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.179
 milk cream is quite dense and 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.830
 that we want a cut that does not 

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:06.930
 have a lot of fat, notice that the oil 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.480
 as I explained earlier well 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.770
 hot what I'm going to do is start 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.140
 simply seal 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.140
 our wonderful piece of meat in 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.299
 a pan cited so that for we want 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.560
 start to melt the edge quoted from 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.600
 fat we want to start giving it 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.960
 caramelization and create a surface 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.030
 good crispy on both sides 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.829
 keeping it as always juicy for 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.140
 inside how we keep it juicy by 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.819
 inside by simply turning it around every 10 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.979
 seconds so that the temperature does not 

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:37.979
 give so much chance to get to the middle and so 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.229
 let's have all those internal juices in what 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.060
 what is going to be our wonderful clothes 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.069
 we 're going to start sealing 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.509
 notice that in a matter of seconds and 

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:48.030
 we started to see us the 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.739
 caramelization then what I want in 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.360
 this same pan is where I'm going to start 

00:01:49.739 --> 00:01:52.950
 to make our sauce and I'm going to 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.560
 show us of course we already have 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.060
 a dress quoted here ahead that is already 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.099
 cooked this one we're going to leave it in a 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.319
 while and now what I'll do 

00:01:59.099 --> 00:02:04.709
 eliminate a little bit of excess oil 

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:06.599
 that I have in the pan and with all those 

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:08.579
 Pegaditos truth of the bottom of the pot 

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:10.679
 I'm going to develop our sauce miren 

00:02:08.579 --> 00:02:12.510
 you nothing more than simple what 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.180
 let's do to start it's going to be 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.470
 reduce a little English sauce to fire 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.490
 pretty high 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.520
 until I start taking a 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.800
 consistency like a syrup notice 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.900
 well the consistency and the reduction what 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.670
 what it does is concentrate the flavor and that 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.530
 way of course we're going to have a 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.140
 best result with all the pegaditos 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.990
 which are many flavors in the background 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.120
 from our pan right then we add 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.670
 our milk cream true and there 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.430
 we climb to high fire and what we are going to 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.380
 to do is start to reduce it look 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.720
 you nothing but what a wonder and the 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.550
 aroma is impressive and as one said 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.110
 super simple recipe for any day 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.209
 of the week wants to make a lunch 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.550
 spectacular there you have it you want to do 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.620
 a spectacular dinner there you have it 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.180
 what we are going to do is move it in this 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.510
 point to give you an infusion and more 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.709
 I'm still going to add a few 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.630
 black pepper granites we give 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.830
 movements so that we do not miss the 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.380
 cream and remember that when we give it 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.270
 very hot to cream she tends to 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.450
 go up quite there is you fix 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:14.250
 nothing more the texture and the consistency 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.080
 what does that have if they want it a little 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.420
 the more reduced we can reduce it more and 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.730
 give a little more of course of 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.800
 more creamy texture and notice what 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.080
 let's do now I have the wonderful 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.570
 steak that we cooked initially what 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:30.030
 I'm going to do is place it there so that 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:31.680
 start as you feel more richer 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.490
 true, look, you are going to leave 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.660
 we turn it over and he starts to let go 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:38.310
 naturally their juices but at the same 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.500
 time begins to absorb all that 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.750
 wonderful sauce and cream that we are 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.360
