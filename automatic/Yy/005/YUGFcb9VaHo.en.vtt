string to mute that one as well so we
only<00:02:18.830> have<00:02:19.160> the<00:02:19.400> 4<00:02:19.670> in<00:02:19.910> the<00:02:20.150> middle<00:02:21.579> that's<00:02:22.579> our

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
only have the 4 in the middle that's our

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.720 
only have the 4 in the middle that's our
F<00:02:22.940> major<00:02:23.239> chord<00:02:23.470> ok<00:02:24.470> we<00:02:24.920> got<00:02:25.069> our<00:02:25.190> chords<00:02:25.549> let's

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
F major chord ok we got our chords let's

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.479 
F major chord ok we got our chords let's
check<00:02:26.060> out<00:02:26.299> the<00:02:26.480> strum<00:02:26.930> pattern<00:02:27.500> the<00:02:28.220> strum

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
check out the strum pattern the strum

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:31.509 
check out the strum pattern the strum
pattern<00:02:28.730> is<00:02:28.790> gonna<00:02:28.940> go<00:02:29.060> like<00:02:29.209> this<00:02:29.450> 1<00:02:30.200> 2<00:02:30.230> &amp;<00:02:31.010> 3<00:02:31.160> &amp;

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
pattern is gonna go like this 1 2 &amp; 3 &amp;

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:32.550 
pattern is gonna go like this 1 2 &amp; 3 &amp;
4<00:02:31.579> and

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
4 and

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.580 
4 and
down<00:02:33.560> down<00:02:34.190> up<00:02:34.459> down<00:02:34.579> up<00:02:35.239> down<00:02:35.269> up<00:02:35.780> just<00:02:36.410> like

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
down down up down up down up just like

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.160 
down down up down up down up just like
that<00:02:36.829> we're<00:02:37.700> gonna<00:02:37.790> use<00:02:38.120> this<00:02:38.420> strum<00:02:38.750> pattern

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
that we're gonna use this strum pattern

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.740 
that we're gonna use this strum pattern
and<00:02:39.650> for<00:02:40.129> the<00:02:40.579> verses<00:02:41.209> and<00:02:41.620> the<00:02:42.620> pre-chorus<00:02:43.250> is

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
and for the verses and the pre-chorus is

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.240 
and for the verses and the pre-chorus is
when<00:02:44.750> we<00:02:44.870> get<00:02:45.019> to<00:02:45.079> the<00:02:45.319> chorus<00:02:45.620> it's<00:02:45.980> much

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
when we get to the chorus it's much

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:53.570 
when we get to the chorus it's much
easier<00:02:47.060> we're<00:02:47.420> just<00:02:47.720> gonna<00:02:47.870> strum<00:02:48.230> them<00:02:48.730> once

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.250 

let's<00:02:54.580> talk<00:02:54.820> about<00:02:55.000> the<00:02:55.330> chord<00:02:55.660> progression

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
let's talk about the chord progression

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.500 
let's talk about the chord progression
because<00:02:56.410> there's<00:02:56.710> only<00:02:56.920> one<00:02:57.850> chord

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
because there's only one chord

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.440 
because there's only one chord
progression<00:02:59.170> as<00:02:59.350> well<00:03:00.250> it's<00:03:00.850> going<00:03:01.000> to<00:03:01.060> be<00:03:01.150> G

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
progression as well it's going to be G

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.890 
progression as well it's going to be G
major<00:03:01.810> for<00:03:01.990> one<00:03:02.350> measure<00:03:02.620> a<00:03:03.330> major<00:03:04.330> for<00:03:04.720> one

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
major for one measure a major for one

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.870 
major for one measure a major for one
measure<00:03:05.110> f<00:03:05.710> major<00:03:06.610> for<00:03:07.180> two<00:03:07.210> measures<00:03:08.280> one<00:03:09.280> two

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
measure f major for two measures one two

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.970 
measure f major for two measures one two
three<00:03:10.630> four<00:03:11.230> one<00:03:11.860> two<00:03:12.460> three<00:03:12.940> four<00:03:13.410> one<00:03:14.410> two

one<00:03:24.190> two<00:03:24.700> three<00:03:25.330> four<00:03:25.930> -<00:03:27.750> just<00:03:28.750> like<00:03:28.900> that

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
one two three four - just like that

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.300 
one two three four - just like that
that's<00:03:30.730> the<00:03:31.030> only<00:03:31.300> chord<00:03:32.110> progression<00:03:32.769> in

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
that's the only chord progression in

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.800 
that's the only chord progression in
this<00:03:33.819> song

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.020 

use<00:03:38.810> this<00:03:39.200> strum<00:03:39.530> pattern<00:03:40.010> when<00:03:40.580> you're<00:03:40.760> in

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
use this strum pattern when you're in

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:46.540 
use this strum pattern when you're in
two<00:03:41.300> verses<00:03:41.840> and<00:03:42.110> three<00:03:42.830> choruses<00:03:45.370> it's<00:03:46.370> gonna

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:46.550 
two verses and three choruses it's gonna

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.950 
two verses and three choruses it's gonna
be<00:03:46.820> four<00:03:47.210> times<00:03:47.720> through<00:03:48.400> for<00:03:49.400> a<00:03:49.430> verse<00:03:49.960> four

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:50.960 
be four times through for a verse four

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.220 
be four times through for a verse four
times<00:03:51.380> through<00:03:51.800> before<00:03:52.310> pre-chorus<00:03:53.300> and

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
times through before pre-chorus and

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.380 
times through before pre-chorus and
again<00:03:54.830> when<00:03:55.190> you're<00:03:55.340> on<00:03:55.520> the<00:03:55.760> chorus<00:03:56.210> you

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:56.390 
again when you're on the chorus you

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:04.000 
again when you're on the chorus you
strum<00:03:56.660> it<00:03:56.780> just<00:03:56.990> once<00:03:58.780> that's<00:03:59.780> just<00:04:03.010> that's

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
strum it just once that's just that's

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:11.220 
strum it just once that's just that's
just

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.729 

something<00:04:12.230> like<00:04:12.349> that<00:04:13.450> so<00:04:14.450> that's<00:04:15.170> gonna<00:04:15.499> be

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739 
something like that so that's gonna be

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:17.529 
something like that so that's gonna be
the<00:04:15.889> tune<00:04:16.100> there<00:04:16.280> is<00:04:16.430> a<00:04:16.459> bridge<00:04:16.820> and<00:04:17.299> the

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:17.539 
the tune there is a bridge and the

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:19.810 
the tune there is a bridge and the
bridge<00:04:17.570> is<00:04:17.989> again<00:04:18.440> the<00:04:18.889> same<00:04:19.190> chord

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
bridge is again the same chord

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.909 
bridge is again the same chord
progression<00:04:19.850> it<00:04:20.479> never<00:04:20.810> changes<00:04:21.590> and<00:04:21.620> never

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 
progression it never changes and never

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:23.140 
progression it never changes and never
goes<00:04:22.220> to<00:04:22.400> a<00:04:22.430> different<00:04:22.610> court<00:04:22.970> and<00:04:23.090> never

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
goes to a different court and never

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:24.909 
goes to a different court and never
switches<00:04:23.660> the<00:04:23.780> chords<00:04:24.110> around<00:04:24.259> so<00:04:24.740> it's

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:24.919 
switches the chords around so it's

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:29.350 
switches the chords around so it's
always<00:04:25.100> just<00:04:25.280> G<00:04:25.970> a<00:04:26.000> minor<00:04:26.539> F<00:04:26.810> F<00:04:27.490> so<00:04:28.490> that's

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
always just G a minor F F so that's

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.350 
always just G a minor F F so that's
gonna<00:04:29.660> be<00:04:29.750> this<00:04:30.530> lesson<00:04:31.070> for<00:04:31.580> Jessie<00:04:32.120> Ware's
