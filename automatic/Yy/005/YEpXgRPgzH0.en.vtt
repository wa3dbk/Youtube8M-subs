00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
here now actually now that I think about

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.229 
here now actually now that I think about
it<00:03:16.680> I<00:03:16.769> do<00:03:16.830> know<00:03:17.160> that<00:03:17.190> you<00:03:17.430> don't<00:03:17.700> really<00:03:18.000> have

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
it I do know that you don't really have

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.750 
it I do know that you don't really have
to<00:03:18.420> go<00:03:18.570> up<00:03:18.780> there<00:03:19.049> to<00:03:19.260> do<00:03:19.410> this<00:03:19.560> but<00:03:20.190> I<00:03:20.459> just

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
to go up there to do this but I just

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.090 
to go up there to do this but I just
decided<00:03:21.120> to<00:03:21.360> so<00:03:21.570> yeah

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
decided to so yeah

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
decided to so yeah
anyway<00:03:23.100> you<00:03:23.160> start<00:03:23.459> loading<00:03:23.730> this<00:03:23.910> whole

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
anyway you start loading this whole

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.880 
anyway you start loading this whole
thing<00:03:24.360> but<00:03:24.480> jumping<00:03:24.840> in<00:03:24.989> that<00:03:25.230> ring<00:03:25.530> you

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
thing but jumping in that ring you

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.410 
thing but jumping in that ring you
actually<00:03:26.310> don't<00:03:26.489> have<00:03:26.670> to<00:03:26.730> you<00:03:27.090> don't<00:03:27.239> have

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
actually don't have to you don't have

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.539 
actually don't have to you don't have
any<00:03:27.570> time<00:03:27.840> limit<00:03:28.230> and<00:03:28.500> there's<00:03:28.890> no<00:03:29.070> order<00:03:29.370> in

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
any time limit and there's no order in

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:31.699 
any time limit and there's no order in
which<00:03:29.760> you<00:03:29.910> have<00:03:30.000> to<00:03:30.090> do<00:03:30.269> these<00:03:30.480> rings<00:03:30.930> so<00:03:31.620> you

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
which you have to do these rings so you

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.699 
which you have to do these rings so you
can<00:03:32.040> do<00:03:32.190> them<00:03:32.370> however<00:03:32.610> you<00:03:32.970> like<00:03:33.000> but

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
can do them however you like but

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:35.810 
can do them however you like but
starting<00:03:34.709> from<00:03:34.860> there<00:03:35.070> is<00:03:35.250> probably<00:03:35.549> a<00:03:35.640> lot

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
starting from there is probably a lot

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.020 
starting from there is probably a lot
easier<00:03:36.209> because<00:03:36.450> it's<00:03:36.720> sort<00:03:36.840> of<00:03:36.959> hard<00:03:37.080> to<00:03:37.170> get

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
easier because it's sort of hard to get

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.280 
easier because it's sort of hard to get
but<00:03:39.030> anyway<00:03:39.330> swim<00:03:39.630> through<00:03:39.870> that<00:03:40.049> ring<00:03:40.260> now

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
but anyway swim through that ring now

really don't like doing it's like

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:05.490 
really don't like doing it's like
jumping<00:05:04.210> from<00:05:04.300> platforms<00:05:04.900> that<00:05:04.990> are<00:05:05.139> like<00:05:05.289> on

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500 
jumping from platforms that are like on

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.589 
jumping from platforms that are like on
the<00:05:05.650> same<00:05:05.919> wall<00:05:06.370> and<00:05:06.759> they<00:05:06.849> don't<00:05:07.030> extend<00:05:07.360> out

00:05:07.589 --> 00:05:07.599 
the same wall and they don't extend out

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:10.350 
the same wall and they don't extend out
that's<00:05:07.870> kind<00:05:08.020> of<00:05:08.139> hard<00:05:08.349> to<00:05:08.379> do<00:05:08.969> even<00:05:09.969> to

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
that's kind of hard to do even to

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.390 
that's kind of hard to do even to
experience<00:05:11.169> platformers<00:05:11.770> that<00:05:11.830> can<00:05:12.039> do<00:05:12.219> give

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 
experience platformers that can do give

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:13.770 
experience platformers that can do give
you<00:05:12.610> trouble<00:05:12.849> especially<00:05:13.120> if<00:05:13.509> you<00:05:13.629> don't

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:13.780 
you trouble especially if you don't

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.290 
you trouble especially if you don't
really<00:05:13.990> have<00:05:14.229> over<00:05:14.590> a<00:05:14.620> liable<00:05:15.310> method<00:05:15.759> of

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.300 
really have over a liable method of

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.420 
really have over a liable method of
changing<00:05:16.659> direction<00:05:16.990> in<00:05:17.469> the<00:05:17.560> air<00:05:17.710> you<00:05:18.340> know

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430 
changing direction in the air you know

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.520 
changing direction in the air you know
and<00:05:18.639> also<00:05:19.270> boosting<00:05:19.780> you<00:05:19.870> up<00:05:19.990> all<00:05:20.169> you<00:05:20.289> have<00:05:20.409> is

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:20.530 
and also boosting you up all you have is

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:21.930 
and also boosting you up all you have is
that<00:05:20.560> little<00:05:20.830> flare<00:05:21.159> jumping<00:05:21.580> that<00:05:21.639> doesn't

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 
that little flare jumping that doesn't

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.779 
that little flare jumping that doesn't
give<00:05:22.060> you<00:05:22.210> any<00:05:22.409> directional<00:05:23.409> changing<00:05:24.159> powers

00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:24.789 
give you any directional changing powers

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:26.240 
give you any directional changing powers
well<00:05:25.509> whatever

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.250 
well whatever

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:29.100 
well whatever

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
anyway now I'm just really hoping that

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:30.749 
anyway now I'm just really hoping that
this<00:05:29.380> doesn't<00:05:29.440> take<00:05:29.889> as<00:05:30.039> long<00:05:30.069> as<00:05:30.250> it<00:05:30.460> did<00:05:30.639> in

00:05:30.749 --> 00:05:30.759 
this doesn't take as long as it did in

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:32.360 
this doesn't take as long as it did in
my<00:05:30.789> practice<00:05:31.270> run<00:05:31.449> because<00:05:31.690> I<00:05:31.719> actually<00:05:31.930> had

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:32.370 
my practice run because I actually had

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:35.010 
my practice run because I actually had
surprisingly<00:05:33.370> enough<00:05:33.669> I<00:05:33.940> had<00:05:34.120> a<00:05:34.300> kind<00:05:34.690> of

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.020 
surprisingly enough I had a kind of

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.200 
surprisingly enough I had a kind of
trouble<00:05:35.440> here<00:05:35.650> my<00:05:35.800> practice<00:05:36.219> run<00:05:36.400> I<00:05:36.729> actually

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:37.210 
trouble here my practice run I actually

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.360 
trouble here my practice run I actually
had<00:05:37.539> to<00:05:37.630> do<00:05:37.750> this<00:05:37.960> like<00:05:38.199> four<00:05:38.620> times<00:05:38.889> it's<00:05:39.130> just

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:39.370 
had to do this like four times it's just

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:42.839 
had to do this like four times it's just
because<00:05:39.639> of<00:05:39.669> this<00:05:39.880> one<00:05:40.630> spot<00:05:40.990> right<00:05:41.349> here<00:05:41.849> holy

00:05:42.839 --> 00:05:42.849 
because of this one spot right here holy

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:46.830 
because of this one spot right here holy
crap<00:05:43.569> it<00:05:44.080> almost<00:05:44.380> happened<00:05:44.860> again<00:05:45.509> and<00:05:46.509> anyway

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:46.840 
crap it almost happened again and anyway

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.779 
crap it almost happened again and anyway
this<00:05:46.990> is<00:05:47.139> another<00:05:47.440> segment<00:05:47.830> that<00:05:48.129> it's<00:05:48.370> really

00:05:48.779 --> 00:05:48.789 
this is another segment that it's really

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:51.390 
this is another segment that it's really
kind<00:05:49.120> of<00:05:49.300> weird<00:05:49.360> because<00:05:50.349> they<00:05:50.650> give<00:05:50.860> you<00:05:51.069> a

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:51.400 
kind of weird because they give you a

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.390 
kind of weird because they give you a
lot<00:05:52.300> of<00:05:52.330> room<00:05:52.690> on<00:05:53.020> these<00:05:53.169> platforms<00:05:53.440> to<00:05:54.099> run

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:54.400 
lot of room on these platforms to run

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.240 
lot of room on these platforms to run
around<00:05:54.520> on<00:05:54.909> oh<00:05:55.360> okay<00:05:56.199> so<00:05:56.440> we<00:05:56.680> can<00:05:56.830> just<00:05:57.069> jump

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:57.250 
around on oh okay so we can just jump

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:59.070 
around on oh okay so we can just jump
right<00:05:57.340> up<00:05:57.520> to<00:05:57.669> the<00:05:57.759> heart<00:05:57.909> okay<00:05:58.120> they<00:05:58.810> give<00:05:58.990> you

00:05:59.070 --> 00:05:59.080 
right up to the heart okay they give you

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.920 
right up to the heart okay they give you
both<00:05:59.259> too<00:05:59.650> much<00:05:59.889> room<00:06:00.250> on<00:06:00.580> those<00:06:01.150> platforms<00:06:01.479> to

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:01.930 
both too much room on those platforms to

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:04.499 
both too much room on those platforms to
be<00:06:02.020> able<00:06:02.080> to<00:06:02.229> jump<00:06:02.409> around<00:06:02.560> on<00:06:02.889> so<00:06:03.279> that's<00:06:04.270> not

00:06:04.499 --> 00:06:04.509 
be able to jump around on so that's not

00:06:04.509 --> 00:06:08.219 
be able to jump around on so that's not
really<00:06:04.870> all<00:06:04.900> that<00:06:05.110> hard<00:06:05.319> to<00:06:05.440> do<00:06:05.940> so<00:06:06.940> anyway<00:06:07.300> um

00:06:08.219 --> 00:06:08.229 
really all that hard to do so anyway um

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:10.409 
really all that hard to do so anyway um
well<00:06:08.919> that's<00:06:09.159> it<00:06:09.370> for<00:06:09.490> the<00:06:09.580> icy<00:06:09.940> segments<00:06:10.330> well

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:10.419 
well that's it for the icy segments well

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:11.399 
well that's it for the icy segments well
I<00:06:10.449> was<00:06:10.629> able<00:06:10.810> to<00:06:10.840> do<00:06:10.990> that<00:06:11.139> pretty<00:06:11.289> quickly

00:06:11.399 --> 00:06:11.409 
I was able to do that pretty quickly

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:15.389 
I was able to do that pretty quickly
I'll<00:06:11.889> just<00:06:12.009> have<00:06:12.129> to<00:06:12.219> cut<00:06:12.400> out<00:06:12.520> me<00:06:12.699> leaving<00:06:13.210> it
