00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:14.759
 hello everyone helps states day 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.139
 especially just for a 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.400
 new video of the very very special 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.890
 since today we are on gta 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.160
 5 to infiltrate the gta 5 prison all 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.609
 I simply found several 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.900
 techniques to enter the prison 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:30.300
 without getting too fast 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.650
 but the best I could find I 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.480
 will you explain it today is 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.610
 like that you can go go you 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.000
 have fun there in the jail if that you 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.949
 attempted 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.710
 so I've got to try a 

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:43.680
 thirty times to make their entry 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.329
 in the prison and see if we could 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.489
 get inside the prison but 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.789
 I have not found yet but it remains 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.430
 see 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.870
 for later so I'm going to you 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.430
 explain that according to the game plan where 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.120
 what are we going to land and so on 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.969
 so the roof that jean circle in yellow we 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.100
 will parachute on it we want 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.399
 only jump off an airplane and we're going 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:08.880
 land on it and we'll be able to have 

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:10.979
 an arm take a year earlier and remove 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.840
 our parachute without being killed 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.670
 Then we go down to the roof 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.179
 is right next door for simply 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.729
 clear the way and not have custody 

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:22.289
 on the back we will get off the roof and we 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.069
 will just go to the yard where 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:27.509
 where the prisoners have a recess 

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:29.039
 simply is what will we 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.459
 to interest the most is the still just 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:31.979
 beside 

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:33.599
 but you have to really 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.899
 really really pay attention 

00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:38.520
 mirador is also in the small corridor 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:40.649
 in yellow or what has a lot of 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.300
 police usually this shed where what 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:43.440
 want to go 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:46.530
 a puzzled because you 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.640
 can see in the windows and no one 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.979
 port you can see in the cities 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.970
 it's just dancing angola dancing and that 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.550
 leave me puzzled 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.250
 so I just tried to do what I 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:59.729
 could die before but it stays 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.229
 see if he will see an easter egg for that 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.330
 In short, we will use everything to find each other 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.429
 for infiltration so people so good 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.239
 viewing so to start you have 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:08.729
 need of weapons 

00:02:06.239 --> 00:02:10.649
 take the money you wanted them 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.650
 are you prefer and 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.030
 buy a bulletproof vest like me 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.349
 I also bought a parachute 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.329
 we need 1 if you want 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:20.189
 get off the plane do you celebrate 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:22.200
 mouth I took a point this is 

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:25.739
 not because like that I have more than 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:28.409
 shooting distance simply and I 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:30.659
 took my favorite rifle too and I 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:32.609
 also took sticky bombs but 

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:34.290
 remember this if you do not need 

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:36.090
 that's just because I 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.180
 used that for trying to treat 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:42.659
 the windows of again is simply 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:45.420
 the prison is located there on the map 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:46.530
 and so that's the second step 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.940
 is simply to find you 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.530
 a plane - personally I have in me 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.579
 I put a cheat codes because 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.980
 I did not want to go get a 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:55.500
 brief plane you will have to parachute yourself where 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.819
 you go to the roof in question you 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.799
 you hide behind the ventilation 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:59.970
 why do you get fucked speak the 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:01.859
 straight guys 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.389
 so here you remove your task is 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:05.579
 from you take your soul and kill you 

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:07.889
 all the guys you see so this 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:10.349
 on the roof mostly because they have 

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:12.299
 more shot view use your rifle 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:14.280
 precision to find a balance 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:16.949
 put them on the roof and it tempts you 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.470
 unique and the nac on the floor 

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:21.840
 but it does not help much because 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.299
 are close to you so occupy 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.099
 you nations on the stairs in 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:28.129
 the court also there are some 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:30.389
 sometimes they hide on the roofs 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:32.849
 then you simply go down 

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:34.260
 on the small the little footbridge and 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:36.989
 you continue to fuck people 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:39.510
 who is coming and you have fallen 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.829
 of sopran on the roof which is right here 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.590
 and you get covered behind 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:45.180
 the little wall and worry about 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.970
 guys who are on their guard 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.709
 do not hesitate to kill the guards 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.680
 who are coming to you or more or 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:54.030
 less than you see also do 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.650
 watch your back because sometimes 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.229
 there are guards that comes in your 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:01.139
 back is also killed his three 

00:03:58.229 --> 00:04:04.260
 people there and another group of three 

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:06.090
 people so that's 6 6 guards who get 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.440
 walk in groups of three so 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.989
 pay attention to this because they 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.000
 are super dead hand to lyon weapons 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:12.860
 assault so 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.090
 duration same time as a direct second 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.040
 when you see a chopper on your 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.450
 love eliminate as soon as possible 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.850
 because it is them who you 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:22.750
 it takes away the most lives and that 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:25.760
 can happen to you as well as the locals 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:29.000
 drop sales with a rope 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.920
 so do not forget to look at this because 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.480
 that otherwise it could be deadly so 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.580
 since there is no more guard I can 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:37.100
 go downstairs and that does not make 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38.960
 pity if ever and I went to 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.150
 shed that will question us all 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.770
 just to watch enters the 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.600
 windows and look if it's not 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:47.150
 totally opaque and you can see 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.710
 stuff and that questions me a lot 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.120
 be careful also because 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:53.120
 times there are puzzles that arises and 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.350
 who poses men also does really 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.800
 attention hallway that I was talking to you 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:57.020
 see you later 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.150
 look at the fonts that offer in the 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:01.850
 corner is really really really 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.680
 crowded with police and do not venture 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:05.860
 not even on the floor because otherwise you 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:08.630
 fucked in two and a half seconds 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:11.930
 could do according to also it's from 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:13.520
 get away from fonts so like me 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:15.140
 I'm doing right now I'm moving away from 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:18.530
 fonts like alone and font have more than 

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:20.030
 bad to come get me and saffron 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:21.620
 takes more time so I have more 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:24.530
 time to hope a little bit the 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:25.820
 map and look at the buildings this 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:27.860
 which is surely the cells because 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:31.550
 I have absolutely no I 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:34.160
 also tried to fart half 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:36.680
 doors that ensures the map with the 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.490
 but it gave absolutely nothing 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.500
 for the moment 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:41.479
 and if ever looked at all 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:44.390
 police all the prisoners sorry 

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:46.220
 that he also paid attention to 

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:49.640
 guards who are still on the roof or 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:51.470
 six names that appear just like that 

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:52.970
 I absolutely none of the 12 who 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:54.620
 come but pay attention to them 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:56.150
 enormously and for sure there is a 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:57.950
 given moment when what we see die 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.270
 and that's absolutely normal 

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:01.430
 extremely hard to hold in this 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:04.940
 prison there I have about five 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:06.560
 minutes and 52 seconds 53 forgiveness what 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:08.360
 is still a lot and I'm when 

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:11.120
 even quite proud to have been that time 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:12.650
 in short I have not found much of 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.570
 mysterious again in this 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:16.580
 prison there but I will continue to go 

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:18.740
 explore it and try to find 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:20.780
 stuff that could be interesting 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:23.360
 because for now I find 

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:24.650
 that she is suspicious this prison there 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:26.180
 because it's useless for now 

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:28.849
 maybe in multiplayer she wants and 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:30.410
 it's going to serve something but 

00:06:28.849 --> 00:06:32.389
 for now these agreements is married and 

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:33.889
 I wonder why so people so 

00:06:32.389 --> 00:06:37.160
 you liked the video but you are 

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:39.080
 a big shoot pushes towards that goes me 

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:41.030
 to make a fine fun and commented 

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.740
 in the east in the comments the tank 

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:44.599
 of survival you did in prison 

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:45.830
 and tell me if you found any 

00:06:44.599 --> 00:06:47.750
 suspicious stuff and I'm going to go watch 

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:49.340
 by my own eyes 

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:52.570
 and otherwise we mostly see people and 

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:58.330
 on a next laying dodge the world 

00:06:52.570 --> 00:07:04.190
 that a lot of 30 of the r35 denis 

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:06.410
 will love even since a replica of 

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:08.000
 this car on gta 5 and I'm going 

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:10.160
 show you today how to see her 

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.430
 how to simply unblock it more 

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.430
 or less
