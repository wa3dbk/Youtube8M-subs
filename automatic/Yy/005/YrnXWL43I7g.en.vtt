of the project we looked at potential

of the project we looked at potential
impacts<00:03:16.030> to<00:03:16.060> fish<00:03:16.600> and<00:03:16.840> we<00:03:17.590> focused<00:03:18.010> on<00:03:18.160> those

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
impacts to fish and we focused on those

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.340 
impacts to fish and we focused on those
areas<00:03:18.580> one<00:03:19.090> thing<00:03:19.330> that<00:03:19.480> we've<00:03:19.630> done<00:03:19.660> in<00:03:20.230> our

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
areas one thing that we've done in our

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.250 
areas one thing that we've done in our
two<00:03:20.620> powerhouse<00:03:21.100> areas<00:03:21.970> is<00:03:22.270> it's<00:03:22.810> moving<00:03:23.140> out

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
two powerhouse areas is it's moving out

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.470 
two powerhouse areas is it's moving out
the<00:03:23.410> floor<00:03:23.710> of<00:03:23.890> the<00:03:24.010> tailrace<00:03:24.220> so<00:03:25.060> there's<00:03:25.330> no

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
the floor of the tailrace so there's no

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.210 
the floor of the tailrace so there's no
pockets<00:03:25.810> or<00:03:26.140> ponds<00:03:26.380> in<00:03:26.650> there<00:03:26.800> that<00:03:26.950> the<00:03:27.040> fish

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
pockets or ponds in there that the fish

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.010 
pockets or ponds in there that the fish
could<00:03:27.460> get<00:03:27.610> stuck<00:03:27.880> in<00:03:28.090> we've<00:03:28.420> made<00:03:28.660> it<00:03:28.810> so<00:03:28.990> that

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:29.020 
could get stuck in we've made it so that

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.080 
could get stuck in we've made it so that
those<00:03:29.350> both<00:03:29.710> are<00:03:29.950> very<00:03:30.100> fish<00:03:30.430> friendly<00:03:30.790> places

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
those both are very fish friendly places

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:32.970 
those both are very fish friendly places
right<00:03:31.450> now<00:03:31.510> and<00:03:32.050> then<00:03:32.170> downstream<00:03:32.620> we

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
right now and then downstream we

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.280 
right now and then downstream we
discovered<00:03:33.460> the<00:03:33.700> stranding<00:03:34.510> of<00:03:34.690> juvenile

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
discovered the stranding of juvenile

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:36.930 
discovered the stranding of juvenile
fish<00:03:35.500> from<00:03:35.800> transferring<00:03:36.340> water<00:03:36.730> between

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
fish from transferring water between

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.230 
fish from transferring water between
units<00:03:37.420> so<00:03:37.810> we<00:03:38.050> installed<00:03:38.800> bypass<00:03:39.640> valves<00:03:40.060> to

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:40.240 
units so we installed bypass valves to

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.850 
units so we installed bypass valves to
allow<00:03:40.480> us<00:03:40.630> to<00:03:40.660> have<00:03:40.840> continuity<00:03:41.500> of<00:03:41.560> water

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
allow us to have continuity of water

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.800 
allow us to have continuity of water
flow<00:03:42.190> so<00:03:42.220> that<00:03:42.550> fish<00:03:42.880> wouldn't<00:03:43.120> get<00:03:43.300> stranded

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
flow so that fish wouldn't get stranded

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.110 
flow so that fish wouldn't get stranded
it's<00:03:44.350> really<00:03:44.560> important<00:03:44.950> that<00:03:44.980> this<00:03:45.250> day's<00:03:45.550> in

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
it's really important that this day's in

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.520 
it's really important that this day's in
a<00:03:46.180> good<00:03:46.360> shape<00:03:46.570> for<00:03:46.840> people<00:03:47.050> to<00:03:47.140> be<00:03:47.260> able<00:03:47.290> to

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
a good shape for people to be able to

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.010 
a good shape for people to be able to

years<00:07:20.100> from<00:07:20.220> now<00:07:20.310> people<00:07:20.699> will<00:07:21.270> still<00:07:21.600> be

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:21.750 
years from now people will still be

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:23.570 
years from now people will still be
going<00:07:21.930> to<00:07:22.289> those<00:07:22.410> observation<00:07:23.100> platforms

going to those observation platforms

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:25.189 
going to those observation platforms
just<00:07:24.120> like<00:07:24.270> they<00:07:24.389> did<00:07:24.449> a<00:07:24.600> hundred<00:07:24.840> years<00:07:24.960> ago

00:07:25.189 --> 00:07:25.199

we want to be a good neighbor and set a
good<00:07:31.770> example<00:07:31.830> we<00:07:32.789> really<00:07:33.060> care<00:07:33.330> about<00:07:33.419> this

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:33.690 
good example we really care about this

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:37.800 
good example we really care about this
area<00:07:33.900> it's<00:07:34.320> it's<00:07:34.680> like<00:07:34.830> our<00:07:34.979> backyard
