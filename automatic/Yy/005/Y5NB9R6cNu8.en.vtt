00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:32.540 
for our loops we're going to click on

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.530 
for our loops we're going to click on
the<00:04:32.720> letter<00:04:32.900> I<00:04:33.130> icon<00:04:34.130> and<00:04:34.370> we<00:04:35.000> get<00:04:35.210> different

the letter I icon and we get different
instrument<00:04:36.500> sounds<00:04:37.060> so<00:04:38.060> we<00:04:38.210> can<00:04:38.420> take<00:04:38.600> that

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.070 
instrument sounds so we can take that

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.200

some<00:05:16.530> sounds<00:05:16.919> obviously<00:05:17.370> work<00:05:17.520> better<00:05:17.699> than

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 
some sounds obviously work better than

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.999

to<00:05:27.660> go<00:05:27.840> back<00:05:27.870> to<00:05:28.850> balance<00:05:29.850> i<00:05:30.000> like<00:05:30.210> that

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:30.449 
to go back to balance i like that

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:41.779

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 
just looking at that little keyboard

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:14.149 
just looking at that little keyboard
you'd<00:06:10.800> click<00:06:11.099> on<00:06:11.310> the<00:06:11.430> keys<00:06:12.620> and<00:06:13.620> there's<00:06:13.949> your

00:06:16.339 --> 00:06:16.349 
sound but boy it's really hard to aim

00:06:16.349 --> 00:06:18.950 
sound but boy it's really hard to aim
for<00:06:16.380> those<00:06:16.710> anybody<00:06:17.250> keys<00:06:17.580> so<00:06:18.240> we<00:06:18.270> can<00:06:18.449> do<00:06:18.750> this

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:18.960 
for those anybody keys so we can do this

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:22.969 
for those anybody keys so we can do this
I<00:06:19.199> just<00:06:19.440> discovered<00:06:20.010> this<00:06:20.419> look<00:06:21.419> at<00:06:21.570> that<00:06:21.979> nice

00:06:22.969 --> 00:06:22.979 
I just discovered this look at that nice

00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:25.219 
I just discovered this look at that nice
and<00:06:23.400> big<00:06:23.789> so<00:06:23.820> we<00:06:24.300> can<00:06:24.479> get<00:06:24.570> a<00:06:24.630> large<00:06:24.960> size

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:25.229 
and big so we can get a large size

00:06:25.229 --> 00:06:27.770 
and big so we can get a large size
keyboard<00:06:25.560> we<00:06:26.010> can<00:06:26.190> stretch<00:06:26.729> it<00:06:26.760> out<00:06:27.270> here<00:06:27.599> and

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:27.780 
keyboard we can stretch it out here and

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:31.580 
keyboard we can stretch it out here and
get<00:06:28.380> more<00:06:28.560> notes<00:06:28.830> and<00:06:29.449> we<00:06:30.449> can<00:06:30.690> move<00:06:30.930> this<00:06:31.229> so

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:31.590 
get more notes and we can move this so

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:34.219 
get more notes and we can move this so
that<00:06:31.800> we're<00:06:31.979> going<00:06:32.340> to<00:06:32.460> different<00:06:33.090> areas<00:06:33.330> on

00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:34.229 
that we're going to different areas on

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:39.950 
that we're going to different areas on
the<00:06:34.320> keyboard<00:06:37.190> very<00:06:38.190> low<00:06:38.490> oh<00:06:38.789> we're<00:06:39.659> still<00:06:39.840> in

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:39.960 
the keyboard very low oh we're still in

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:46.790 
the keyboard very low oh we're still in
limbo<00:06:40.789> and<00:06:44.630> so<00:06:45.630> we've<00:06:45.750> got<00:06:46.320> lots<00:06:46.560> of

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:46.800 
limbo and so we've got lots of

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.379 
limbo and so we've got lots of
possibilities<00:06:47.460> there<00:06:47.970> we're<00:06:48.210> going<00:06:48.330> to

00:06:48.379 --> 00:06:48.389 
possibilities there we're going to

00:06:48.389 --> 00:06:54.829 
possibilities there we're going to
record

00:06:54.829 --> 00:06:54.839 

00:06:54.839 --> 00:06:58.760 

so<00:06:55.839> it's<00:06:56.349> a<00:06:56.529> little<00:06:56.650> harder<00:06:57.069> for<00:06:57.610> me<00:06:57.759> as<00:06:57.969> a

00:06:58.760 --> 00:06:58.770 
so it's a little harder for me as a

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:01.379 
so it's a little harder for me as a
keyboard<00:06:59.770> player<00:06:59.800> to<00:07:00.279> just<00:07:00.639> aim<00:07:00.879> for<00:07:01.300> the

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:01.389 
keyboard player to just aim for the

00:07:01.389 --> 00:07:03.629 
keyboard player to just aim for the
notes<00:07:01.599> here<00:07:01.930> but<00:07:02.559> if<00:07:02.770> you've<00:07:02.979> got<00:07:03.189> students

00:07:03.629 --> 00:07:03.639 
notes here but if you've got students

00:07:03.639 --> 00:07:05.790 
notes here but if you've got students
working<00:07:03.909> and<00:07:04.240> you<00:07:04.659> don't<00:07:04.779> have<00:07:04.899> keyboards<00:07:05.619> to

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:05.800 
working and you don't have keyboards to

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.859 
working and you don't have keyboards to
attach<00:07:06.099> that's<00:07:06.729> a<00:07:06.939> pretty<00:07:07.149> good<00:07:07.360> option

00:07:07.859 --> 00:07:07.869 
attach that's a pretty good option

00:07:07.869 --> 00:07:09.959 
attach that's a pretty good option
because<00:07:07.899> it<00:07:08.229> really<00:07:08.409> does<00:07:08.740> look<00:07:08.770> like<00:07:09.249> a<00:07:09.610> piano

00:07:09.959 --> 00:07:09.969 
because it really does look like a piano

00:07:09.969 --> 00:07:13.709 
because it really does look like a piano
and<00:07:10.499> the<00:07:11.499> other<00:07:11.830> option<00:07:12.490> is<00:07:12.819> click<00:07:13.300> here<00:07:13.599> on

00:07:13.709 --> 00:07:13.719 
and the other option is click here on

00:07:13.719 --> 00:07:16.529 
and the other option is click here on
the<00:07:13.839> icon<00:07:14.379> and<00:07:14.680> we<00:07:15.309> turn<00:07:15.550> it<00:07:15.699> into<00:07:15.849> musical

00:07:16.529 --> 00:07:16.539 
the icon and we turn it into musical

00:07:16.539 --> 00:07:19.579 
the icon and we turn it into musical
typing<00:07:17.409> so<00:07:17.919> then<00:07:18.099> you're<00:07:18.309> using<00:07:18.550> the<00:07:18.789> actual

00:07:19.579 --> 00:07:19.589 
typing so then you're using the actual

00:07:19.589 --> 00:07:23.549 
typing so then you're using the actual
computer<00:07:20.589> keyboard<00:07:21.309> to<00:07:21.879> enter<00:07:22.029> notes<00:07:23.020> and

00:07:23.549 --> 00:07:23.559 
computer keyboard to enter notes and

00:07:23.559 --> 00:07:25.350 
computer keyboard to enter notes and
this<00:07:24.069> is<00:07:24.219> a<00:07:24.249> little<00:07:24.550> harder<00:07:24.849> for<00:07:25.029> me<00:07:25.149> but<00:07:25.330> I

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:25.360 
this is a little harder for me but I

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:29.459 
this is a little harder for me but I
just<00:07:25.659> put<00:07:26.020> my<00:07:26.550> pinky<00:07:27.550> ring<00:07:27.789> finger<00:07:28.180> and<00:07:28.469> here's

00:07:29.459 --> 00:07:29.469 
just put my pinky ring finger and here's

00:07:29.469 --> 00:07:33.329 
just put my pinky ring finger and here's
my<00:07:29.770> thumb<00:07:30.699> and<00:07:31.029> my<00:07:31.089> other<00:07:31.960> thumb<00:07:32.349> and<00:07:32.680> we<00:07:33.069> just

00:07:33.329 --> 00:07:33.339 
my thumb and my other thumb and we just

00:07:33.339 --> 00:07:39.510 
my thumb and my other thumb and we just
go<00:07:37.139> it's<00:07:38.139> a<00:07:38.259> little<00:07:38.499> bit<00:07:38.620> easier<00:07:38.740> for<00:07:39.189> me<00:07:39.279> to<00:07:39.309> do

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:39.520 
go it's a little bit easier for me to do

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:41.489 
go it's a little bit easier for me to do
the<00:07:39.639> fingers<00:07:39.999> here<00:07:40.300> than<00:07:40.839> it<00:07:40.990> is<00:07:41.139> for<00:07:41.349> me<00:07:41.469> to

00:07:41.489 --> 00:07:41.499 
the fingers here than it is for me to

00:07:41.499 --> 00:07:44.129 
the fingers here than it is for me to
click<00:07:41.800> with<00:07:41.979> the<00:07:42.069> mouse<00:07:42.099> but<00:07:42.939> what<00:07:43.749> I<00:07:43.779> really

00:07:44.129 --> 00:07:44.139 
click with the mouse but what I really

00:07:44.139 --> 00:07:47.189 
click with the mouse but what I really
like<00:07:44.319> best<00:07:44.589> is<00:07:44.800> just<00:07:45.309> actually<00:07:45.849> using<00:07:46.300> a<00:07:46.449> USB

00:07:47.189 --> 00:07:47.199 
like best is just actually using a USB

00:07:47.199 --> 00:07:49.739 
like best is just actually using a USB
keyboard<00:07:47.849> attached<00:07:48.849> but<00:07:49.479> there<00:07:49.659> are

00:07:49.739 --> 00:07:49.749 
keyboard attached but there are

00:07:49.749 --> 00:07:52.350 
keyboard attached but there are
different<00:07:50.139> options<00:07:50.709> for<00:07:50.889> note<00:07:51.639> entry<00:07:52.059> and
