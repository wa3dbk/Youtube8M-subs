00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.400
 distinctive feature 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.170
 rc helicopters gera 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.960
 is availability 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:16.020
 Gyro what is try 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.270
 figure out the gyro was invented back in 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.210
 early nineteenth century yogan 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.910
 sick berber and famous philosopher and 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.410
 Foucault's scientist first applied it as 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.380
 device showing changes 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.939
 directions of the earth he lives in this turn 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.559
 term 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:33.600
 however gyroscopic itself 

00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:36.000
 the effect is not something invented 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.789
 he exists objectively as a law 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.460
 physics an example of his action is 

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:43.739
 ordinary kids who dreidel spinning 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.070
 around its axis and does not fall save 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.379
 vertical position at the fulcrum. 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.420
 and the floor force arises under the action 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.429
 which its axis of rotation deviates from 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.929
 vertical 

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:56.789
 centrifugal force of rotating masses and 

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:59.940
 prevents the plane from changing 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.530
 rotation and forcing the top while moving 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.830
 keep set orientation 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.210
 space is now called a gyro 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.120
 device allows you to save 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.370
 directional stability of the body space 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.290
 when it moves modern 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.420
 industry gyroscopes are used in 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.500
 navigation instruments to maintain 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.110
 preset course 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.020
 when designing real helicopters 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.760
 space rocket and submarine aircraft 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.770
 boats 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:28.530
 case of using radio controlled 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.690
 helicopters gyroscope gives a tangible 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.700
 advantage for example during flight 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.760
 helicopter tail can start wearing 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.240
 any side of the gyro registers 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.100
 this deviation gives signals to the print 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.829
 motor to counteract this 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.570
 the deviation is therefore a helicopter and not 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:47.680
 spins around its axis and 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.670
 maintain a given direction but 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.460
 rc helicopters are used 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:55.869
 small piezoelectric sensors 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:58.729
 5 times smaller than a penny coin 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:01.390
 thanks to one flying in models is easy 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:03.679
 manage it becomes balanced 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.630
 amateur run radio controlled 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:08.179
 models know how to not just manage 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.220
 small helicopter in contrast to 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:13.760
 these free-floating helicopters 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:17.150
 book model puts twists soft 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.080
 landing at first only dream of helicopters 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.569
 with gyro 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.670
 thanks to the stability of the flight allow 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:25.400
 learn to manage them without fuss and 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.650
 fear of breaking a toy you completely 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.890
 control the process of your model 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.380
 most obedient to the same body and and 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.830
 nylon rotor blades hera very 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.830
 lasting
