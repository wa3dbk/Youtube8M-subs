00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 so friends can go on here 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.759
 now a few ghost warrior 2 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.980
 and we just have him left 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.400
 liberated but we still have it here 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:17.100
 a few enemies to our care 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:19.890
 need for example to here was the 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.930
 animal if so that's pretty young 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.250
 amounted 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.800
 I have the cut again exactly 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.990
 exactly the right one here 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.179
 made and of course half again 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.340
 forget what was because I'm in between 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.899
 there is still something else left 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.460
 then we just do it 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.430
 the whole mission again from the beginning 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:42.739
 was not that much now and know now 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.739
 We achieved a great deal what to expect 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.270
 he is defenseless in the basin 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.370
 to blame is at 14 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:15.280
 Come on nations 4 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:35.640
 that was not good too and now knew 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:40.990
 he still cool after loading yes 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:45.490
 oh come on oh crap come so still 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:48.670
 time that he does not have to be 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:56.980
 then load it a bit 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:59.190
 hastily shot I think now 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:03.830
 shortly after 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.830
 before there is terror again 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.850
 he is defenseless to discover people 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:18.430
 so guilty 24 which also is already 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.660
 better now and for now 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.590
 equal to these types of except 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.590
 come out you 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:44.630
 so finally that was but synonymous time 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:44.630
 thanks to a box-out 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.299
 I think our position stays there 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.750
 despite 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.879
 18 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.440
 comes from 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:46.420
 I make fun fire detected 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:50.810
 the panzerfaust 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.129
 where, then 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:05.129
 the last 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.270
 but then clear 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:20.390
 yes, just come out of it 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:41.569
 yes that was a problem on the ground and 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.569
 ceiling 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.569
 mistake will me here for the ass 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:53.069
 rip 

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:53.069
 but in Sarajevo 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.730
 I have to lower this cliff myself 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.510
 thought here half a kilometer 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:00.510
 further west 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.960
 disappear 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:40.360
 Well, we have really screwed her up 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.360
 again an intermediate sequence 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:48.800
 the cutscenes do not have us like that yet 

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.800
 Good luck 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:06:03.140
 I'll take it back well that's what we have 

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:03.140
 although the box is gone again 

00:06:08.819 --> 00:06:11.819
 well 

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:19.730
 more quickly 

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:19.730
 translated 

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:31.110
 well with the tank or what 

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:31.110
 that was really great 

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:43.900
 drama baby drama quarterback yes so before 

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:45.460
 We already had two followers 

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:47.139
 a little longer with half an hour 

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:49.090
 that's why it's a shorter one right now 

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:52.740
 Follow and see you in the 

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:52.740
 next mission until then
