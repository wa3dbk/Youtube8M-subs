in<00:00:04.950> this<00:00:05.100> video<00:00:05.400> we're<00:00:06.029> going<00:00:06.120> to<00:00:06.210> look<00:00:06.359> at

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
in this video we're going to look at

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.270 
in this video we're going to look at
examples<00:00:06.839> where<00:00:07.319> we<00:00:07.560> don't<00:00:07.680> need<00:00:07.890> to<00:00:08.069> borrow

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
examples where we don't need to borrow

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.400 
examples where we don't need to borrow
when<00:00:08.519> we're<00:00:08.700> subtracting<00:00:08.940> and<00:00:09.660> we<00:00:10.080> don't<00:00:10.260> need

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
when we're subtracting and we don't need

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.020 
when we're subtracting and we don't need
to<00:00:10.559> carry<00:00:10.830> any<00:00:11.070> numbers<00:00:11.460> when<00:00:11.700> we're<00:00:11.849> adding

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
to carry any numbers when we're adding

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.259 
to carry any numbers when we're adding
mixed<00:00:12.360> numbers<00:00:12.889> now<00:00:13.889> I've<00:00:13.980> seen<00:00:14.219> a<00:00:14.460> variety<00:00:14.940> of

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
mixed numbers now I've seen a variety of

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.769 
mixed numbers now I've seen a variety of
different<00:00:15.540> methods<00:00:16.109> used<00:00:16.470> in<00:00:17.630> adding<00:00:18.630> and

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
different methods used in adding and

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.269 
different methods used in adding and
subtracting<00:00:19.140> mixed<00:00:19.439> numbers<00:00:19.590> and<00:00:19.949> when<00:00:20.250> I

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
subtracting mixed numbers and when I

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.519 
subtracting mixed numbers and when I
find<00:00:20.640> it<00:00:20.789> be<00:00:20.910> best<00:00:21.119> is<00:00:21.689> to<00:00:21.840> actually<00:00:21.960> rewrite

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
find it be best is to actually rewrite

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.560 
find it be best is to actually rewrite
these<00:00:22.710> vertically<00:00:23.430> so<00:00:23.699> in<00:00:23.910> this<00:00:24.000> little<00:00:24.210> video

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
these vertically so in this little video

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.740 
these vertically so in this little video
I<00:00:24.630> made<00:00:25.099> you<00:00:26.099> can<00:00:26.490> see<00:00:26.760> how<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:26.970> example<00:00:27.660> up

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
I made you can see how the example up

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.169 
I made you can see how the example up
top<00:00:27.990> is<00:00:28.230> written<00:00:28.500> horizontally<00:00:28.650> I<00:00:29.429> find<00:00:30.029> it's

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
top is written horizontally I find it's

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.370 
top is written horizontally I find it's
a<00:00:30.240> little<00:00:30.480> bit<00:00:30.599> better<00:00:30.720> and<00:00:30.960> you're<00:00:31.109> a<00:00:31.140> little

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
a little bit better and you're a little

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.569 
a little bit better and you're a little
more<00:00:31.500> accurate<00:00:32.070> if<00:00:32.250> you<00:00:33.180> rewrite<00:00:33.660> these

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:34.579 
more accurate if you rewrite these

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:36.860 
more accurate if you rewrite these
vertically<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:35.940> you<00:00:36.210> need<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:36.510> bring<00:00:36.690> over

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
vertically and you need to bring over

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.229 
vertically and you need to bring over
your<00:00:36.989> whole<00:00:37.320> numbers<00:00:37.800> and<00:00:38.280> in<00:00:38.430> this<00:00:38.760> example

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
your whole numbers and in this example

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.880 
your whole numbers and in this example
the<00:00:39.570> denominators<00:00:40.350> you<00:00:40.530> would<00:00:40.620> need<00:00:40.739> to

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
the denominators you would need to

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.160 
the denominators you would need to
change<00:00:41.129> both<00:00:41.520> because<00:00:42.239> you<00:00:42.270> can't<00:00:42.570> add<00:00:42.780> thirds

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
change both because you can't add thirds

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.560 
change both because you can't add thirds
and<00:00:43.559> fourths<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:44.219> you<00:00:45.030> convert<00:00:45.390> each

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
and fourths and you convert each

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.660 
and fourths and you convert each
fraction<00:00:45.930> then<00:00:46.469> you<00:00:46.559> add<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.950> fractions<00:00:47.520> and

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
fraction then you add the fractions and

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.400 
fraction then you add the fractions and
whole<00:00:47.879> numbers<00:00:48.239> this<00:00:48.690> is<00:00:48.750> actually<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.260> bad

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
whole numbers this is actually a bad

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.350 
whole numbers this is actually a bad
example<00:00:49.980> because<00:00:50.100> there<00:00:50.460> is<00:00:50.579> some<00:00:50.820> regrouping

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
example because there is some regrouping

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.319 
example because there is some regrouping
involved<00:00:51.870> in<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.559> answer<00:00:52.920> so<00:00:53.219> let's<00:00:53.969> move<00:00:54.120> on

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
involved in the answer so let's move on

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.729 
involved in the answer so let's move on
to<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.539> next<00:00:54.629> page<00:00:54.930> we're<00:00:55.170> going<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.320> do<00:00:55.469> three

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
to the next page we're going to do three

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.180 
to the next page we're going to do three
examples<00:00:55.770> of<00:00:56.399> each<00:00:57.020> in<00:00:58.020> our<00:00:58.170> first<00:00:58.440> example<00:00:58.620> if

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
examples of each in our first example if

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.639 
examples of each in our first example if
you<00:00:59.879> look<00:01:00.030> at<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.239> denominators<00:01:00.989> they're

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
you look at the denominators they're

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.549 
you look at the denominators they're
they're<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.280> same<00:01:02.460> they're<00:01:02.820> ninths<00:01:03.439> so<00:01:04.439> we

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
they're the same they're ninths so we

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.109 
they're the same they're ninths so we
can<00:01:04.680> go<00:01:04.799> ahead<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.010> just<00:01:05.189> add<00:01:05.400> these<00:01:05.610> two

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
can go ahead and just add these two

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.609 
can go ahead and just add these two
ninths<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:06.689> 1/9<00:01:07.110> is<00:01:07.320> 3/9<00:01:07.979> and<00:01:08.750> 5<00:01:09.750> plus<00:01:10.080> 3<00:01:10.110> is<00:01:10.380> 8

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
ninths and 1/9 is 3/9 and 5 plus 3 is 8

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.510 
ninths and 1/9 is 3/9 and 5 plus 3 is 8
now<00:01:11.460> this<00:01:11.640> could<00:01:11.850> be<00:01:11.909> simplified<00:01:12.689> to<00:01:12.720> 8<00:01:13.080> and

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
now this could be simplified to 8 and

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:14.780 
now this could be simplified to 8 and
1/3

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
1/3

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.490 
1/3
in<00:01:15.360> our<00:01:15.780> next<00:01:16.049> example<00:01:17.900> you<00:01:18.900> have<00:01:19.110> fourths

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
in our next example you have fourths

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.160 
in our next example you have fourths
nades<00:01:19.770> you<00:01:20.040> really<00:01:20.430> only<00:01:20.670> need<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.090> change<00:01:21.600> one

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
nades you really only need to change one

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.010 
nades you really only need to change one
of<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.409> denominators<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.460> least<00:01:24.020> common

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
of the denominators the least common

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.170 
of the denominators the least common
denominator<00:01:25.799> would<00:01:26.040> be<00:01:26.100> 8<00:01:26.430> you<00:01:26.939> want<00:01:27.119> to

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
denominator would be 8 you want to

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.060 
denominator would be 8 you want to
change<00:01:27.360> them<00:01:27.600> both<00:01:27.869> ace<00:01:28.140> now<00:01:28.350> I've<00:01:28.530> seen<00:01:28.890> a

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
change them both ace now I've seen a

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.789 
change them both ace now I've seen a
common<00:01:29.700> mistake<00:01:29.880> kids<00:01:30.270> will<00:01:30.479> make<00:01:30.659> is<00:01:30.869> they

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
common mistake kids will make is they

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.740 
common mistake kids will make is they
want<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.130> change<00:01:32.430> both<00:01:32.820> of<00:01:32.850> these<00:01:33.060> to<00:01:33.450> 30

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
want to change both of these to 30

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.050 
want to change both of these to 30
seconds<00:01:34.290> they'll<00:01:34.470> multiply<00:01:35.060> the

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
seconds they'll multiply the

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.499 
seconds they'll multiply the
denominators<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:36.960> they<00:01:37.229> they<00:01:37.680> change<00:01:38.040> both

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
denominators and they they change both

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:41.030 
denominators and they they change both
fractions<00:01:39.509> into<00:01:39.810> 30<00:01:40.049> seconds<00:01:40.530> which<00:01:40.680> is<00:01:40.799> fine

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
fractions into 30 seconds which is fine

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.760 
fractions into 30 seconds which is fine
you'll<00:01:41.250> get<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.640> right<00:01:41.790> answer<00:01:42.560> you'll<00:01:43.560> just

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
you'll get the right answer you'll just

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.710 
you'll get the right answer you'll just
have<00:01:43.950> to<00:01:44.100> do<00:01:44.250> excuse<00:01:44.909> me<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.090> little<00:01:45.299> more<00:01:45.509> work

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
have to do excuse me a little more work

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.590 
have to do excuse me a little more work
at<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:46.020> end<00:01:46.170> in<00:01:46.759> simplifying<00:01:47.759> your<00:01:47.939> answer<00:01:48.360> so

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
at the end in simplifying your answer so

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.539 
at the end in simplifying your answer so
we<00:01:48.810> we<00:01:49.380> only<00:01:49.590> want<00:01:49.799> to<00:01:49.890> change<00:01:50.159> one

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
we we only want to change one

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.260 
we we only want to change one
denominator<00:01:52.310> let<00:01:53.310> me<00:01:53.430> get<00:01:53.549> my<00:01:53.700> whole<00:01:53.909> numbers

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
denominator let me get my whole numbers

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.499 
denominator let me get my whole numbers
here<00:01:55.520> we're<00:01:56.520> going<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:56.670> change<00:01:56.939> these<00:01:57.210> both

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
here we're going to change these both

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.600 
here we're going to change these both
dates<00:01:58.350> well<00:01:58.619> this<00:01:58.770> one's<00:01:58.979> already<00:01:59.219> in<00:01:59.399> eighths

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
dates well this one's already in eighths

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.149 
dates well this one's already in eighths
it's<00:01:59.880> 1/8<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.450> this<00:02:01.079> would<00:02:01.290> equal<00:02:01.590> how<00:02:01.979> many

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
it's 1/8 and this would equal how many

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.170 
it's 1/8 and this would equal how many
eighths<00:02:02.399> well<00:02:03.270> 4<00:02:03.960> times<00:02:04.320> 2<00:02:04.979> is<00:02:05.219> 8<00:02:05.759> we're<00:02:06.060> going

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
eighths well 4 times 2 is 8 we're going

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.630 
eighths well 4 times 2 is 8 we're going
to<00:02:06.240> do<00:02:07.099> we're<00:02:08.099> going<00:02:08.220> to<00:02:08.280> multiply<00:02:08.580> the

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
to do we're going to multiply the

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.339 
to do we're going to multiply the
numerator<00:02:08.910> by<00:02:09.390> 2<00:02:10.610> so<00:02:11.610> this<00:02:11.790> 1/4<00:02:12.450> is<00:02:12.660> equal<00:02:13.020> to<00:02:13.140> 2

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
numerator by 2 so this 1/4 is equal to 2

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:13.850 
numerator by 2 so this 1/4 is equal to 2
8

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
8

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.360 
8
and<00:02:14.130> now<00:02:14.670> we<00:02:14.730> can<00:02:14.970> go<00:02:15.120> ahead<00:02:15.210> and<00:02:15.360> add<00:02:15.990> our

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
and now we can go ahead and add our

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.190 
and now we can go ahead and add our
fractions<00:02:17.370> so<00:02:17.580> two<00:02:17.640> eighths<00:02:18.000> and<00:02:18.270> 1/8<00:02:18.990> is

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
fractions so two eighths and 1/8 is

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.590 
fractions so two eighths and 1/8 is
three<00:02:19.470> eighths<00:02:19.650> and<00:02:19.890> 8<00:02:20.670> plus<00:02:20.880> 6<00:02:21.270> is<00:02:21.540> 14<00:02:21.890> and

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
three eighths and 8 plus 6 is 14 and

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.960 
three eighths and 8 plus 6 is 14 and
that<00:02:24.600> is<00:02:24.750> in<00:02:24.900> simplest<00:02:25.320> form<00:02:25.550> now<00:02:26.550> in<00:02:26.670> the<00:02:26.730> next

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
that is in simplest form now in the next

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.670 
that is in simplest form now in the next
example<00:02:27.330> we're<00:02:28.050> actually<00:02:28.170> going<00:02:28.410> to<00:02:28.470> have<00:02:28.590> to

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
example we're actually going to have to

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.720 
example we're actually going to have to
change<00:02:28.920> both<00:02:29.730> denominators<00:02:31.010> you<00:02:32.010> can't<00:02:32.520> add

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
change both denominators you can't add

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.130 
change both denominators you can't add
six<00:02:33.090> and<00:02:33.390> eight<00:02:33.600> our<00:02:34.310> least<00:02:35.310> common

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
six and eight our least common

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.400 
six and eight our least common
denominator<00:02:37.140> would<00:02:38.040> be<00:02:38.100> twenty-fourths<00:02:39.410> now

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
denominator would be twenty-fourths now

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.949 
denominator would be twenty-fourths now
again<00:02:40.709> I've<00:02:40.950> seen<00:02:41.280> some<00:02:41.610> kids<00:02:41.850> change<00:02:42.690> these

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
again I've seen some kids change these

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.050 
again I've seen some kids change these
both<00:02:43.290> in<00:02:43.500> 248<00:02:44.130> and<00:02:44.370> that's<00:02:44.490> fine<00:02:44.760> you're<00:02:44.970> going

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
both in 248 and that's fine you're going

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.340 
both in 248 and that's fine you're going
to<00:02:45.150> get<00:02:45.300> the<00:02:45.390> right<00:02:45.540> answer<00:02:45.930> you<00:02:46.080> would<00:02:46.200> just

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
to get the right answer you would just

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.720 
to get the right answer you would just
have<00:02:46.500> to<00:02:47.330> simplify<00:02:48.330> your<00:02:48.690> answer<00:02:49.050> at<00:02:49.170> the<00:02:49.320> end

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
have to simplify your answer at the end

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:56.570 
have to simplify your answer at the end
so<00:02:53.060> 8<00:02:54.060> times<00:02:54.690> 3<00:02:55.050> would<00:02:55.320> give<00:02:55.350> you<00:02:55.650> 24<00:02:56.280> so<00:02:56.459> we're

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
so 8 times 3 would give you 24 so we're

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.070 
so 8 times 3 would give you 24 so we're
going<00:02:56.670> to<00:02:56.730> do<00:02:56.850> the<00:02:56.970> top<00:02:57.209> times<00:02:57.570> 3

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
going to do the top times 3

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.990 
going to do the top times 3
our<00:02:58.590> numerator<00:02:58.860> here<00:02:59.370> would<00:02:59.550> be<00:02:59.670> 15<00:03:01.670> 6<00:03:02.670> times

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
our numerator here would be 15 6 times

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.949 
our numerator here would be 15 6 times
what<00:03:03.330> would<00:03:03.540> give<00:03:03.600> you<00:03:03.780> 24<00:03:04.500> 6<00:03:05.370> times<00:03:05.700> 4<00:03:06.180> so<00:03:06.840> we

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
what would give you 24 6 times 4 so we

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:08.960 
what would give you 24 6 times 4 so we
do<00:03:07.110> the<00:03:07.230> top<00:03:07.470> times<00:03:07.830> for<00:03:08.130> the<00:03:08.280> numerator<00:03:08.640> times

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
do the top times for the numerator times

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.870 
do the top times for the numerator times
4<00:03:09.390> and<00:03:09.600> we<00:03:10.320> get<00:03:10.470> 4<00:03:10.890> now<00:03:11.220> we<00:03:11.280> can<00:03:11.459> go<00:03:11.550> ahead<00:03:11.640> and

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
4 and we get 4 now we can go ahead and

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.220 
4 and we get 4 now we can go ahead and
add<00:03:12.060> these<00:03:12.270> fractions<00:03:12.800> for<00:03:13.800> 24<00:03:14.370> and<00:03:14.640> 15<00:03:15.000> 24<00:03:15.870> is

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
add these fractions for 24 and 15 24 is

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.949 
add these fractions for 24 and 15 24 is
1920<00:03:17.190> fourths<00:03:17.580> and<00:03:17.750> the<00:03:18.750> 6<00:03:19.049> just<00:03:19.320> drops<00:03:19.620> down

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
1920 fourths and the 6 just drops down

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:25.580 
1920 fourths and the 6 just drops down
excuse<00:03:21.959> me<00:03:22.170> just<00:03:22.410> drops<00:03:22.650> down<00:03:23.930> so<00:03:24.930> if<00:03:25.260> you<00:03:25.380> see

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
excuse me just drops down so if you see

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.350 
excuse me just drops down so if you see
what<00:03:25.739> I've<00:03:25.860> done<00:03:26.070> here<00:03:26.340> in<00:03:26.519> our<00:03:26.910> first<00:03:27.120> example

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
what I've done here in our first example

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.509 
what I've done here in our first example
you<00:03:27.959> didn't<00:03:28.290> have<00:03:28.410> to<00:03:28.530> change<00:03:28.799> either<00:03:29.250> the

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
you didn't have to change either the

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:32.390 
you didn't have to change either the
denominators<00:03:30.510> and<00:03:30.750> the<00:03:31.260> second<00:03:31.620> example<00:03:31.739> you

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
denominators and the second example you

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.030 
denominators and the second example you
had<00:03:32.549> to<00:03:32.640> change<00:03:32.910> one<00:03:33.269> of<00:03:33.630> them<00:03:33.900> and<00:03:34.140> in<00:03:34.860> our

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
had to change one of them and in our

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.520 
had to change one of them and in our
third<00:03:35.070> example<00:03:35.459> we<00:03:35.910> had<00:03:36.060> to<00:03:36.150> change<00:03:36.420> both<00:03:36.690> what

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
third example we had to change both what

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.050 
third example we had to change both what
we're<00:03:37.650> going<00:03:37.769> to<00:03:37.799> do<00:03:37.950> the<00:03:38.070> same<00:03:38.280> thing<00:03:38.610> with

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
we're going to do the same thing with

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.470 
we're going to do the same thing with
certain<00:03:39.420> subtraction<00:03:40.260> examples<00:03:41.330> in<00:03:42.330> the

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
certain subtraction examples in the

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.300 
certain subtraction examples in the
first<00:03:42.690> one<00:03:42.900> they're<00:03:43.140> both<00:03:43.290> FETs<00:03:43.680> we<00:03:43.950> can<00:03:44.130> just

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
first one they're both FETs we can just

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.150 
first one they're both FETs we can just
go<00:03:44.430> ahead<00:03:44.670> and<00:03:44.910> do<00:03:45.030> the<00:03:45.150> subtraction<00:03:45.360> here<00:03:46.160> 4/5

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
go ahead and do the subtraction here 4/5

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:53.449 
go ahead and do the subtraction here 4/5
minus<00:03:47.190> 2/5<00:03:48.120> is<00:03:48.330> 2/5<00:03:49.200> and<00:03:49.380> 9<00:03:50.250> minus<00:03:50.489> 2<00:03:50.850> is<00:03:51.269> 7<00:03:52.459> in

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
minus 2/5 is 2/5 and 9 minus 2 is 7 in

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:55.190 
minus 2/5 is 2/5 and 9 minus 2 is 7 in
our<00:03:53.700> next<00:03:53.940> example<00:03:54.090> we<00:03:54.600> are<00:03:54.630> going<00:03:54.870> to<00:03:54.959> have<00:03:55.080> to

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
our next example we are going to have to

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.990 
our next example we are going to have to
change<00:03:55.410> one<00:03:55.769> of<00:03:55.799> the<00:03:55.950> denominators<00:03:56.700> we<00:03:56.880> have

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
change one of the denominators we have

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.600 
change one of the denominators we have
ninths<00:03:57.510> and<00:03:57.810> thirds<00:03:58.110> let<00:03:59.040> me<00:03:59.160> get<00:03:59.280> my<00:03:59.400> whole

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
ninths and thirds let me get my whole

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.750 
ninths and thirds let me get my whole
numbers<00:03:59.970> over<00:04:00.269> here<00:04:00.450> first<00:04:00.980> well<00:04:01.980> it's<00:04:02.549> real

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
numbers over here first well it's real

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.820 
numbers over here first well it's real
easy<00:04:02.790> to<00:04:03.120> change<00:04:03.420> thirds<00:04:03.870> into<00:04:04.200> ninths

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
easy to change thirds into ninths

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:08.140 
easy to change thirds into ninths
so<00:04:05.820> we<00:04:05.940> can<00:04:06.090> just<00:04:06.209> leave<00:04:06.480> that<00:04:06.750> eight<00:04:07.019> ninths

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
so we can just leave that eight ninths

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.979 
so we can just leave that eight ninths
three<00:04:09.150> times<00:04:09.540> what<00:04:09.870> is<00:04:10.079> 9<00:04:10.380> 3<00:04:10.650> times<00:04:11.400> 3<00:04:11.760> so<00:04:12.750> 1

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
three times what is 9 3 times 3 so 1

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:17.150 
three times what is 9 3 times 3 so 1
times<00:04:13.290> 3<00:04:13.680> is<00:04:13.709> 3<00:04:14.450> 1/3<00:04:15.450> equals<00:04:15.799> 3/9<00:04:16.799> those<00:04:17.010> are

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
times 3 is 3 1/3 equals 3/9 those are

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.699 
times 3 is 3 1/3 equals 3/9 those are
equivalent<00:04:17.430> fractions<00:04:17.810> and<00:04:18.810> we<00:04:18.959> can<00:04:19.229> then<00:04:19.470> go

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
equivalent fractions and we can then go

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.210 
equivalent fractions and we can then go
ahead<00:04:19.739> and<00:04:20.040> subtract<00:04:20.489> 8<00:04:20.940> 9<00:04:21.239> -<00:04:21.900> 3<00:04:21.930> ninths<00:04:22.500> is

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
ahead and subtract 8 9 - 3 ninths is

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.580 
ahead and subtract 8 9 - 3 ninths is
five<00:04:23.580> ninths<00:04:23.880> and<00:04:24.500> 5<00:04:25.500> minus<00:04:25.979> 3<00:04:26.250> is<00:04:26.400> 2

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
five ninths and 5 minus 3 is 2

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.100 
five ninths and 5 minus 3 is 2
in<00:04:28.310> our<00:04:28.700> last<00:04:28.970> example<00:04:29.270> we're<00:04:29.840> going<00:04:29.960> to<00:04:30.020> have

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
in our last example we're going to have

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.200 
in our last example we're going to have
to<00:04:30.169> change<00:04:30.500> both<00:04:30.950> the<00:04:31.160> denominators<00:04:31.940> so<00:04:31.970> let

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
to change both the denominators so let

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.250 
to change both the denominators so let
me<00:04:32.330> get<00:04:32.480> my<00:04:32.510> whole<00:04:32.810> numbers<00:04:33.169> over<00:04:33.410> here<00:04:33.440> first

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
me get my whole numbers over here first

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.100 
me get my whole numbers over here first
and<00:04:36.400> in<00:04:37.400> this<00:04:37.520> particular<00:04:37.730> example<00:04:38.540> we<00:04:38.930> have

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
and in this particular example we have

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.730 
and in this particular example we have
fifths<00:04:39.560> and<00:04:39.680> halves<00:04:40.419> so<00:04:41.419> our<00:04:41.930> least<00:04:42.260> common

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
fifths and halves so our least common

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.980 
fifths and halves so our least common
denominator<00:04:43.340> would<00:04:43.970> be<00:04:44.030> 10<00:04:44.389> we're<00:04:44.780> going<00:04:44.900> to

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
denominator would be 10 we're going to

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:48.100 
denominator would be 10 we're going to
change<00:04:45.260> them<00:04:45.530> both<00:04:45.860> into<00:04:46.160> tenths<00:04:46.669> well<00:04:47.510> 1/2<00:04:47.900> is

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
change them both into tenths well 1/2 is

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.670 
change them both into tenths well 1/2 is
easy<00:04:48.350> that's<00:04:48.590> five<00:04:49.310> tenths<00:04:50.410> because<00:04:51.410> two

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
easy that's five tenths because two

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.860 
easy that's five tenths because two
times<00:04:51.710> 5<00:04:52.490> is<00:04:52.730> 10<00:04:52.970> and<00:04:53.030> 1<00:04:53.900> times<00:04:54.169> 5<00:04:54.440> would<00:04:54.620> be<00:04:54.680> 5

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
times 5 is 10 and 1 times 5 would be 5

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:00.640 
times 5 is 10 and 1 times 5 would be 5
three-fifths<00:04:56.980> 5<00:04:57.980> times<00:04:58.490> 2<00:04:59.090> is<00:04:59.389> 10<00:04:59.720> we<00:05:00.350> do<00:05:00.500> the

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
three-fifths 5 times 2 is 10 we do the

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.590 
three-fifths 5 times 2 is 10 we do the
numerator<00:05:01.070> times<00:05:01.400> 2<00:05:01.729> that<00:05:02.479> would<00:05:02.570> be<00:05:02.630> 6<00:05:02.750> and

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:04.600 
numerator times 2 that would be 6 and

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.180 
numerator times 2 that would be 6 and
then<00:05:05.600> excuse<00:05:06.290> me<00:05:06.440> we<00:05:06.650> can<00:05:06.800> go<00:05:06.889> ahead<00:05:06.979> and

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190 
then excuse me we can go ahead and

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:10.450 
then excuse me we can go ahead and
subtract<00:05:07.639> 6<00:05:08.510> tenths<00:05:08.780> minus<00:05:09.050> 5<00:05:09.380> tenths<00:05:09.710> is<00:05:09.950> 1/10

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
subtract 6 tenths minus 5 tenths is 1/10

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:15.340 
subtract 6 tenths minus 5 tenths is 1/10
and<00:05:10.960> 10<00:05:12.160> minus<00:05:13.160> 2<00:05:13.370> is<00:05:13.400> 8<00:05:13.900> so<00:05:14.900> that's<00:05:15.020> all<00:05:15.229> there

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:15.350 
and 10 minus 2 is 8 so that's all there

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:18.460 
and 10 minus 2 is 8 so that's all there
is<00:05:15.410> to<00:05:15.710> it<00:05:15.860> sometimes<00:05:16.400> when<00:05:17.000> you're<00:05:17.470> adding

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:18.470 
is to it sometimes when you're adding

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:20.530 
is to it sometimes when you're adding
and<00:05:18.680> subtracting<00:05:19.520> mixed<00:05:19.880> numbers<00:05:20.060> you're

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:20.540 
and subtracting mixed numbers you're

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:22.900 
and subtracting mixed numbers you're
going<00:05:20.570> to<00:05:20.720> have<00:05:20.870> to<00:05:21.080> change<00:05:21.639> well<00:05:22.639> you<00:05:22.729> might

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:22.910 
going to have to change well you might

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:24.070 
going to have to change well you might
not<00:05:23.060> have<00:05:23.270> to<00:05:23.389> change<00:05:23.630> either<00:05:23.960> the

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080 
not have to change either the

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.800 
not have to change either the
denominators<00:05:25.010> or<00:05:25.729> sometimes<00:05:26.300> you'll<00:05:26.510> have<00:05:26.630> to

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:26.810 
denominators or sometimes you'll have to

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:29.350 
denominators or sometimes you'll have to
change<00:05:27.110> one<00:05:27.410> or<00:05:28.220> in<00:05:28.430> some<00:05:28.669> cases<00:05:28.910> you'll<00:05:29.330> have

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
change one or in some cases you'll have

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.440 
change one or in some cases you'll have
to<00:05:29.630> change<00:05:29.930> both<00:05:30.370> denominators<00:05:31.370> before<00:05:32.360> you

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:32.450 
to change both denominators before you

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:34.510 
to change both denominators before you
can<00:05:32.630> add<00:05:32.810> and<00:05:33.020> subtract<00:05:33.530> them<00:05:33.710> and<00:05:33.919> that's<00:05:34.340> all

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:34.520 
can add and subtract them and that's all

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.060 
can add and subtract them and that's all
there<00:05:34.640> is<00:05:34.729> to<00:05:34.910> it
