00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
Pro X and if you want to go so far but

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.170 
Pro X and if you want to go so far but
at<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.170> same<00:01:55.320> time<00:01:55.530> it<00:01:55.680> easy<00:01:55.860> to<00:01:56.130> it's<00:01:56.280> stuff

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
at the same time it easy to it's stuff

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.970 
at the same time it easy to it's stuff
like<00:01:57.210> screen

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:57.980 
like screen

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.490 
like screen
which<00:01:58.340> is<00:01:58.460> something<00:01:58.640> which<00:01:58.790> I<00:01:59.020> edit<00:02:00.020> stuff<00:02:00.290> on

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
which is something which I edit stuff on

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.250 
which is something which I edit stuff on
there<00:02:00.710> as<00:02:00.800> well<00:02:01.030> and<00:02:02.030> the<00:02:02.600> other<00:02:02.720> thing<00:02:02.990> which

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:03.260 
there as well and the other thing which

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.620 
there as well and the other thing which
is<00:02:03.290> good<00:02:03.620> which<00:02:03.860> I<00:02:03.950> want<00:02:04.280> to<00:02:04.370> find<00:02:04.460> out<00:02:04.790> is<00:02:05.090> the

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
is good which I want to find out is the

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.090 
is good which I want to find out is the
effect<00:02:05.990> of<00:02:06.170> protune<00:02:07.160> so<00:02:07.910> just<00:02:08.180> now<00:02:08.300> it<00:02:08.660> is<00:02:09.100> in

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
effect of protune so just now it is in

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.920 
effect of protune so just now it is in
his<00:02:10.310> normal<00:02:10.520> kind<00:02:10.820> of<00:02:10.880> camera<00:02:11.270> of<00:02:11.360> settings

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
his normal kind of camera of settings

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.090 
his normal kind of camera of settings
which<00:02:12.170> is<00:02:12.320> are<00:02:14.110> like<00:02:15.110> a<00:02:15.140> cheap<00:02:15.410> exit<00:02:15.860> but

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
which is are like a cheap exit but

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.900 
which is are like a cheap exit but
protune<00:02:16.670> should<00:02:17.120> give<00:02:17.330> me<00:02:17.450> a<00:02:17.480> very<00:02:17.840> very<00:02:18.110> flat

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
protune should give me a very very flat

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.170 
protune should give me a very very flat
luke<00:02:19.910> file<00:02:20.750> should<00:02:21.680> mean<00:02:22.250> that<00:02:22.460> black<00:02:22.760> to<00:02:22.970> west

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
luke file should mean that black to west

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.240 
luke file should mean that black to west
where<00:02:23.390> the<00:02:23.660> breaks<00:02:24.110> of<00:02:24.320> ice<00:02:24.470> bracelet<00:02:24.950> give<00:02:25.130> me

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
where the breaks of ice bracelet give me

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.510 
where the breaks of ice bracelet give me
more<00:02:25.430> dead<00:02:25.580> outraged<00:02:25.970> so<00:02:27.040> in<00:02:28.040> this<00:02:28.340> image

yeah<00:02:50.390> I'm<00:02:50.570> build<00:02:50.720> of<00:02:50.840> yours<00:02:51.080> in<00:02:51.320> turn<00:02:51.500> just<00:02:51.860> a

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
yeah I'm build of yours in turn just a

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.800 
yeah I'm build of yours in turn just a
little<00:02:52.190> bit<00:02:52.280> too<00:02:52.550> much<00:02:52.760> tank<00:02:53.180> going<00:02:53.450> on<00:02:53.630> there

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
little bit too much tank going on there

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.080 
little bit too much tank going on there
so<00:02:54.380> at<00:02:54.440> the<00:02:54.500> moment<00:02:54.650> I<00:02:54.890> should<00:02:54.950> be<00:02:55.190> and<00:02:55.790> a

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
so at the moment I should be and a

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.170 
so at the moment I should be and a
little<00:02:56.420> bit<00:02:56.870> more<00:02:57.080> greater<00:02:57.920> or<00:02:58.250> ever<00:02:58.820> it<00:02:58.970> wants

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
little bit more greater or ever it wants

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.030 
little bit more greater or ever it wants
to<00:02:59.240> be<00:02:59.360> and<00:02:59.540> but<00:03:00.290> it<00:03:00.470> also<00:03:00.620> gives<00:03:00.830> me<00:03:00.980> the

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
to be and but it also gives me the

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.860 
to be and but it also gives me the
opportunity<00:03:01.190> to<00:03:01.490> play<00:03:02.209> around<00:03:02.540> with<00:03:02.750> the

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
opportunity to play around with the

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.390 
opportunity to play around with the
white<00:03:03.020> balance<00:03:03.230> now<00:03:03.530> I<00:03:03.560> can<00:03:03.890> see<00:03:04.190> the<00:03:04.310> white

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
white balance now I can see the white

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.790 
white balance now I can see the white
past<00:03:04.640> whenever<00:03:05.480> it<00:03:05.630> I<00:03:05.810> turn<00:03:06.140> you<00:03:06.350> off<00:03:06.500> from

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
past whenever it I turn you off from

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.650 
past whenever it I turn you off from
recording<00:03:07.340> and<00:03:07.790> I<00:03:07.940> just<00:03:08.120> have<00:03:08.209> a<00:03:08.300> look<00:03:08.480> at<00:03:08.570> that

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
recording and I just have a look at that

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.630 
recording and I just have a look at that
so<00:03:08.900> add<00:03:09.110> moment<00:03:09.440> is<00:03:09.560> an<00:03:09.709> auto<00:03:10.630> this<00:03:11.630> is<00:03:11.840> that<00:03:12.020> at

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
so add moment is an auto this is that at

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.820 
so add moment is an auto this is that at
3000<00:03:13.640> K<00:03:14.000> which<00:03:14.450> I<00:03:14.750> was<00:03:14.900> seeing<00:03:15.080> probably<00:03:15.440> using

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
3000 K which I was seeing probably using

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:17.920 
3000 K which I was seeing probably using
if<00:03:15.950> you're<00:03:16.160> doing<00:03:16.400> it<00:03:16.520> in<00:03:16.730> a<00:03:16.880> really<00:03:17.390> really

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
if you're doing it in a really really

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.500 
if you're doing it in a really really
indoor<00:03:18.890> location<00:03:19.459> where<00:03:19.700> there<00:03:19.940> is<00:03:20.030> no<00:03:20.239> light

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
indoor location where there is no light

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:21.850 
indoor location where there is no light
from<00:03:20.720> outside<00:03:21.110> so<00:03:21.290> this<00:03:21.440> should<00:03:21.620> be<00:03:21.709> probably

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
from outside so this should be probably

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.530 
from outside so this should be probably
a<00:03:22.010> very<00:03:22.250> blue<00:03:22.550> looking<00:03:23.360> image<00:03:23.950> this<00:03:24.950> is<00:03:25.540> 5500

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
a very blue looking image this is 5500

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:27.970 
a very blue looking image this is 5500
key<00:03:26.750> which<00:03:26.989> you<00:03:27.110> probably<00:03:27.290> have<00:03:27.530> normally<00:03:27.890> if

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
key which you probably have normally if

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.670 
key which you probably have normally if
you're<00:03:28.070> just<00:03:28.220> outdoors<00:03:28.910> in<00:03:29.330> the<00:03:29.360> sunshine<00:03:29.720> as

you're just outdoors in the sunshine as

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.880 
you're just outdoors in the sunshine as

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
this has got normal outdoors brightness

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:35.979 
this has got normal outdoors brightness

you<00:03:38.870> can<00:03:39.020> color<00:03:39.230> on<00:03:39.290> either<00:03:39.500> side<00:03:39.860> of<00:03:40.100> the<00:03:40.550> bit

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330 
you can color on either side of the bit

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:45.880 
you can color on either side of the bit
next<00:03:41.720> one's<00:03:43.300> 6500<00:03:44.300> which<00:03:44.420> i<00:03:44.540> think<00:03:44.600> is<00:03:44.840> more<00:03:45.080> if

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
next one's 6500 which i think is more if

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:49.510 
next one's 6500 which i think is more if
you're<00:03:46.160> shooting<00:03:47.440> if<00:03:48.440> you're<00:03:48.560> shooting<00:03:48.739> in<00:03:49.070> a

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:49.520 
you're shooting if you're shooting in a

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.479 
you're shooting if you're shooting in a
shadow<00:03:50.450> of<00:03:50.780> a<00:03:50.900> mountain<00:03:51.380> i<00:03:51.560> can<00:03:52.010> variable<00:03:52.400> is

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
shadow of a mountain i can variable is

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:54.970 
shadow of a mountain i can variable is
it<00:03:52.580> like<00:03:52.700> that<00:03:53.290> alright<00:03:54.290> so<00:03:54.320> if<00:03:54.709> you're<00:03:54.860> in

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
it like that alright so if you're in

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:56.229 
it like that alright so if you're in
shadow<00:03:55.160> moment<00:03:55.489> and<00:03:55.640> there's<00:03:55.790> a<00:03:55.850> naturally

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
shadow moment and there's a naturally

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:56.690 
shadow moment and there's a naturally
more<00:03:56.390> of

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
more of

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.369 
more of
you<00:03:56.849> cast<00:03:57.300> in<00:03:57.569> the<00:03:57.629> play<00:03:57.750> so<00:03:57.870> that's<00:03:58.080> where<00:03:58.290> you

00:03:58.369 --> 00:03:58.379 
you cast in the play so that's where you

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:01.430 
you cast in the play so that's where you
put<00:03:58.530> the<00:03:58.800> white<00:03:59.550> balance<00:03:59.940> to<00:04:00.060> a<00:04:00.090> higher<00:04:00.440> color

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
put the white balance to a higher color

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.619 
put the white balance to a higher color
temperature<00:04:02.010> to<00:04:02.459> counterbalance<00:04:02.970> that's<00:04:03.510> a

00:04:03.619 --> 00:04:03.629 
temperature to counterbalance that's a

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:05.809 
temperature to counterbalance that's a
bit<00:04:03.810> more<00:04:03.989> normal<00:04:04.470> white<00:04:04.620> but<00:04:05.190> when<00:04:05.430> indoors

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 
bit more normal white but when indoors

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:08.150 
bit more normal white but when indoors

it says it says camera roll ooh
interesting<00:04:13.800> what<00:04:14.340> I<00:04:14.370> can<00:04:14.489> do<00:04:14.610> there

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
interesting what I can do there

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.199 
interesting what I can do there
so<00:04:15.959> other<00:04:16.620> moments<00:04:16.950> in<00:04:17.070> Camera<00:04:17.639> Raw<00:04:17.669> not

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
so other moments in Camera Raw not

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:19.789 
so other moments in Camera Raw not
really<00:04:18.450> sure<00:04:18.630> what<00:04:18.930> function<00:04:19.350> is<00:04:19.440> doing<00:04:19.590> I

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
really sure what function is doing I

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:21.860 
really sure what function is doing I
think<00:04:19.829> I<00:04:20.459> was<00:04:20.700> initially<00:04:21.120> thinking<00:04:21.329> that<00:04:21.750> that

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
think I was initially thinking that that

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.980 
think I was initially thinking that that
would<00:04:21.989> just<00:04:22.260> be<00:04:22.410> for<00:04:22.860> video<00:04:23.760> a<00:04:24.030> just<00:04:24.870> for

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
would just be for video a just for

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.990 
would just be for video a just for
photos<00:04:25.290> so<00:04:26.070> maybe<00:04:26.220> you're<00:04:26.430> taking<00:04:26.669> the<00:04:26.729> 12

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
photos so maybe you're taking the 12

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.810 
photos so maybe you're taking the 12
megapixel<00:04:27.240> images<00:04:30.530> I<00:04:31.530> don't<00:04:32.370> know<00:04:32.460> what<00:04:32.700> do

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
megapixel images I don't know what do
