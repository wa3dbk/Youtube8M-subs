00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:09.960 
condition this thing looks pretty pretty
big<00:02:08.110> for<00:02:08.470> something<00:02:09.130> like<00:02:09.280> this<00:02:09.490> I<00:02:09.670> wonder<00:02:09.789> how

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
big for something like this I wonder how

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.270 
big for something like this I wonder how
many<00:02:10.030> watts<00:02:10.300> per<00:02:10.569> channel<00:02:10.600> it<00:02:11.020> is<00:02:11.200> enough<00:02:12.100> to

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
many watts per channel it is enough to

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.800 
many watts per channel it is enough to
put<00:02:12.459> it<00:02:12.550> on<00:02:12.670> the<00:02:12.790> dummy<00:02:13.000> load<00:02:13.120> and<00:02:13.480> the<00:02:13.540> scope

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
put it on the dummy load and the scope

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.890 
put it on the dummy load and the scope
and<00:02:14.050> find<00:02:14.260> out<00:02:14.440> later<00:02:15.750> potentiometers<00:02:16.750> are

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
and find out later potentiometers are

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.630 
and find out later potentiometers are
easy<00:02:17.080> to<00:02:17.260> get<00:02:17.410> to<00:02:17.590> they<00:02:17.860> desperately<00:02:18.400> need<00:02:18.610> to

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
easy to get to they desperately need to

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.449 
easy to get to they desperately need to
be<00:02:18.790> cleaned<00:02:19.090> as<00:02:19.390> well<00:02:19.440> they<00:02:20.440> barely<00:02:20.980> even<00:02:21.100> work

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
be cleaned as well they barely even work

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.780 
be cleaned as well they barely even work
they're<00:02:21.700> so<00:02:21.880> dirty<00:02:23.220> let<00:02:24.220> me<00:02:24.310> try<00:02:24.430> and<00:02:24.520> get<00:02:24.640> this

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
they're so dirty let me try and get this

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.949 
they're so dirty let me try and get this
whole<00:02:24.970> thing<00:02:25.000> out<00:02:25.330> of<00:02:25.360> cabinet<00:02:25.870> real<00:02:26.020> quick

whole thing out of cabinet real quick
this<00:02:28.959> thing<00:02:29.200> is<00:02:29.319> capacitor<00:02:30.220> hell<00:02:31.110> holy<00:02:32.110> crap

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
this thing is capacitor hell holy crap

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:39.420 
this thing is capacitor hell holy crap
but<00:02:34.780> it<00:02:34.900> is<00:02:35.050> a<00:02:35.790> full<00:02:36.790> metal<00:02:37.060> frame<00:02:38.160> very<00:02:39.160> well

set it on the speaker wires in the amps

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.890 
set it on the speaker wires in the amps
don't<00:02:48.220> have<00:02:48.400> a<00:02:48.430> shared<00:02:48.880> ground<00:02:49.270> and<00:02:49.690> it<00:02:49.780> looks

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
don't have a shared ground and it looks

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.809 
don't have a shared ground and it looks
like<00:02:49.990> what<00:02:50.170> they<00:02:50.290> did<00:02:50.349> is<00:02:50.650> they<00:02:50.680> use<00:02:51.610> the

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:51.819 
like what they did is they use the

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:54.000 
like what they did is they use the
positive<00:02:52.390> from<00:02:52.599> one<00:02:52.810> one<00:02:53.380> plug<00:02:53.739> and<00:02:53.950> the
