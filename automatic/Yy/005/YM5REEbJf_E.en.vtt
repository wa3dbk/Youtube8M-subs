00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:33.860
 what Nissan GT-R drive, of course, never 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:37.000
 small hotel 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.000
 that my 600 it 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.830
 are of course not without back and forth 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.330
 this nissan gt-r and banks are going this 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:25.310
 genius 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:27.470
 this is to be missed from www.ghw.nl 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.850
 It is therefore possible to experience this 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.250
 to do it yourself 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:35.840
 it is therefore possible to go out on your own 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:38.030
 go with a car with 6 118 hp and 750 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.440
 new the meter of torque 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.060
 then you would say it is not like that 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.580
 special to ride in a missal 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.260
 gt-r well i can promise you my it is 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.680
 very special to drive in one 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.690
 to hold 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.370
 the fun was driving a ferrari this 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.490
 is nicer when he is in the lamborghini 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.900
 this is unparalleled technology and it wants to 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.720
 experience everyone 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:01.040
 well today it's my turn 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.040
 with the gt-r 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.530
 nice news a this car that is 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.530
 namely 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:10.110
 funes by zwitser he now has them 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:13.020
 instead of 480 hp 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.780
 618 but especially the couple and that 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.430
 combination with that gearbox with 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.880
 in flipper you said handlebars and double 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.920
 link 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.489
 it's all so easy and so 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.489
 fast 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.520
 back to his two little 80s 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:45.049
 I deal with emotion this is just 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:47.220
 technology that fits together so well 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:49.220
 suddenly building 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:53.210
 always be allowed to do this 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:55.310
 I rebuild 3.8 liters of v6 with two 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:56.670
 always makes it neat on dear je bol 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.709
 irma gained 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.709
 mine to hear from 1000 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.420
 to get maximum power out of your GT-R 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.340
 get it 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.870
 You have infinite buttons to the one 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.400
 and others 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.590
 now three buttons are crazy 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.350
 important the buttons that are there 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.670
 of course for race that will keep you long 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.220
 pressed up 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:26.040
 well then everything is as tight as possible 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.080
 gearbox damping and of course 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.100
 the drive something the GT-R equipped with 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.110
 four wheel drive 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.870
 well if your people are set pick it up 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.800
 50% on the for or 50 percent on the 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.810
 rear axle 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.620
 that is of course much safer i 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.620
 will show you 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.980
 how 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:01.689
 something about the history of the nissan 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:04.870
 gt-r 

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:07.629
 that goes back to 1969 when miss on 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.790
 built a GT-R skyline for the first time 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:12.310
 were of course the skyline but for the 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.980
 japanese fashion sport outside looks faster 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:19.630
 that is to honor that skyline 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:21.190
 until 2002 that the R34 Skyline GT-R was 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.750
 already built then 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.240
 from then on is usually actually going 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:27.310
 think something better, something must be better 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.440
 no more the need to spill killer one 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:31.690
 Ferrari Killer but then come 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.810
 usually goes completely out of nowhere 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:36.400
 and Nissan GT-R has been released 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:39.039
 Here again not based on a 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.530
 standard model that usually implemented 

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:43.330
 but has really become its own hotel and 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:45.400
 that has been a good choice because with 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.630
 this car has more would be so many things 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.310
 reports 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:50.949
 the north grinding on the ring was that 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:53.110
 two faster as a deposit eaten two 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:55.090
 she then called a portion of killer 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.680
 get this cure left and it has it 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.669
 almost and much to killer 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.669
 they call this bone will 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:14.020
 and you judge that Jews is fast 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:15.970
 a good switch and the like 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.229
 actually you never know how good your 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:19.780
 task do not send 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:22.150
 he is so tight on the road the wheel is 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:23.310
 a tad heavy but with that it was 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:26.310
 very direct 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.870
 the handling yes , of course, he came across 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.590
 but i thought it was good on it 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:30.270
 circuit 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:32.190
 because there lies like a plank in the bend 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:34.700
 You don't feel the about money 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:35.970
 no it doesn't vibrate it's right building 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:38.360
 four wheel drive 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:39.919
 yes nice 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.659
 for me I had a little more power to 

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:44.240
 The rear wheels may steer on again 

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:46.189
 to step aside 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.750
 but total picture 

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:51.080
 I am satisfied it is mine 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:53.889
 experience to drive you agree with certain 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.889
 this chain of 

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:07.720
 I'm going to enjoy it 

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:07.720
 b600 from smithy 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:21.460
 no this video yes well interested 

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:24.580
 for this nissan gt-r 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:26.050
 you can experience the same this car can 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:27.220
 drive yourself 

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:28.720
 where are you looking for a nice one 

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:30.640
 birthday present 

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:32.500
 or do you have a very sweet man 

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:34.660
 just earned something like that 

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:37.090
 then I would quickly contact the 

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:39.850
 guys from www dot gt-r driven dot 

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:41.560
 nl and I know for sure 

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:43.150
 this is a lot more fun than in one 

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:45.070
 Ferrari rides or in a lamborghini 

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:46.780
 but I leave it up to you 

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:51.120
 experiencing it yourself 

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:51.120
