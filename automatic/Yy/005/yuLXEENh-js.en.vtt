00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.860
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.600
 new video on gta 5 i'll get you 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.580
 show how you catapult with your 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.960
 buddies as I showed you so with 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.699
 the little clip at the beginning of the video 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.199
 by the way if you liked it do not hesitate 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:50.000
 to let go of a little blue thumbs that will not do 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:52.230
 really happy 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.699
 so let's go to be able to 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.220
 catapult so as I wanted to show 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.229
 you need two mates minimum so one 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.300
 who will be full-time as a teacher 

00:00:58.229 --> 00:01:02.129
 in front of me and the second who will have to 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.080
 take a motorcycle so just watch at 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.300
 right he's going to run into the door of 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.320
 garage which is right here normally there 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.909
 I should have garage doors 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.920
 which opens and can return to 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.060
 inside there for me it was not the 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.190
 case but blood that is right behind 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.320
 him for him the doors were open 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.700
 so he went on the bike I'm 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.420
 climbed behind and he made me cross 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.860
 the doors 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.960
 so if you too have this little 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.369
 problem get on the vehicle date your 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.750

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.880
 go inside look and bim 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.560

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.840
 garage and now they are open 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.430
