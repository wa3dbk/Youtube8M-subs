talking<00:00:00.420> about<00:00:00.599> race<00:00:00.900> is<00:00:01.199> difficult<00:00:01.829> because

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:03.080 
talking about race is difficult because

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:10.570 
talking about race is difficult because
we<00:00:04.080> don't<00:00:04.290> talk<00:00:04.529> about<00:00:04.740> it<00:00:05.420> so<00:00:06.830> let's<00:00:07.830> stop

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:10.580 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.450 

what's<00:00:11.580> up<00:00:11.820> you<00:00:12.030> guys<00:00:12.240> so<00:00:13.080> the<00:00:13.500> question<00:00:13.920> is<00:00:14.070> do

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
what's up you guys so the question is do

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.939 
what's up you guys so the question is do
you<00:00:14.519> think<00:00:15.000> that<00:00:15.269> each<00:00:15.509> race<00:00:15.900> is<00:00:16.199> represented

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
you think that each race is represented

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.670 
you think that each race is represented
equally<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:18.570> simple<00:00:18.900> answer<00:00:18.990> to<00:00:19.199> that<00:00:19.439> is<00:00:19.500> no

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
equally the simple answer to that is no

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.240 
equally the simple answer to that is no
why<00:00:20.640> because<00:00:21.390> race<00:00:22.289> representation<00:00:23.100> on

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
why because race representation on

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.000 
why because race representation on
YouTube<00:00:23.850> is<00:00:24.210> a<00:00:24.269> direct<00:00:25.080> reflection<00:00:25.230> of<00:00:25.710> race

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
YouTube is a direct reflection of race

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.029 
YouTube is a direct reflection of race
representation<00:00:26.849> in<00:00:27.090> life<00:00:27.840> but<00:00:28.590> this<00:00:28.740> is<00:00:28.890> such

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
representation in life but this is such

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.410 
representation in life but this is such
a<00:00:29.070> difficult<00:00:29.310> topic<00:00:29.670> because<00:00:30.000> there's<00:00:30.269> so

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
a difficult topic because there's so

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.150 
a difficult topic because there's so
many<00:00:30.539> different<00:00:30.810> viewpoints<00:00:31.560> are<00:00:31.679> you<00:00:32.130> a

many different viewpoints are you a

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.360 
many different viewpoints are you a
viewer<00:00:32.550> are<00:00:33.000> you<00:00:33.390> a<00:00:33.630> content<00:00:34.380> creator<00:00:34.440> or<00:00:34.829> both

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
guess is a really a flaw on youtube's

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.640 
guess is a really a flaw on youtube's
part<00:01:34.950> as<00:01:35.130> much<00:01:35.400> as<00:01:35.549> it<00:01:35.700> is<00:01:35.729> on<00:01:36.060> ours<00:01:36.900> the

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
part as much as it is on ours the

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.469 
part as much as it is on ours the
popularity<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.549> subscriber<00:01:38.970> count<00:01:39.240> of<00:01:39.329> these

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
popularity and subscriber count of these

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.740 
popularity and subscriber count of these
channels<00:01:39.990> is<00:01:40.200> a<00:01:40.439> whole<00:01:40.920> another<00:01:41.820> video<00:01:42.299> but<00:01:42.659> i

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
channels is a whole another video but i

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.270 
channels is a whole another video but i
do<00:01:42.869> think<00:01:42.990> that<00:01:43.259> viewer<00:01:43.560> demographic<00:01:44.130> comes

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
do think that viewer demographic comes

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.219 
do think that viewer demographic comes
in<00:01:44.399> a<00:01:44.460> major<00:01:44.670> play<00:01:44.939> not<00:01:45.210> just<00:01:45.450> with<00:01:45.600> race<00:01:45.840> but

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
in a major play not just with race but

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.100 
in a major play not just with race but
also<00:01:46.549> gender<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.149> socioeconomic<00:01:48.600> status

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110

why on a black people segregated and

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.110 
why on a black people segregated and
living<00:02:20.390> in<00:02:20.480> the<00:02:20.540> poorest<00:02:20.840> district<00:02:21.320> and

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
working in the fields and why I fruit

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.110

and<00:02:26.590> that's<00:02:27.590> probably<00:02:28.220> one<00:02:28.490> of<00:02:28.520> the<00:02:28.700> reasons

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
and that's probably one of the reasons

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.240

shock<00:03:30.380> me<00:03:30.650> as<00:03:30.860> it<00:03:31.160> bothers<00:03:31.490> me<00:03:31.760> a<00:03:32.270> little

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
shock me as it bothers me a little

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.500 
shock me as it bothers me a little
because<00:03:33.140> I<00:03:33.709> know<00:03:33.890> that<00:03:34.400> as<00:03:34.520> a<00:03:34.550> community<00:03:35.000> black

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
because I know that as a community black

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.480 
because I know that as a community black
people<00:03:35.690> we<00:03:36.020> don't<00:03:36.470> read<00:03:36.740> as<00:03:36.980> much<00:03:37.160> as<00:03:37.340> we

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:37.490 
people we don't read as much as we

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:39.640 
people we don't read as much as we
should<00:03:37.520> so<00:03:38.390> it<00:03:38.720> makes<00:03:38.990> sense<00:03:39.140> that<00:03:39.410> there

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
should so it makes sense that there

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.949 
should so it makes sense that there

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:44.990 
us are exception but that bothers me

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:46.240 
us are exception but that bothers me
because<00:03:45.170> it's<00:03:45.440> an<00:03:45.560> issue<00:03:45.709> that<00:03:45.860> we've<00:03:46.130> been
