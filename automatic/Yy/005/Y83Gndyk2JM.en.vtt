00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
hair off and we cut out a perimeter this

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.220 
hair off and we cut out a perimeter this
is<00:00:41.310> called<00:00:41.520> your<00:00:41.640> perimeter<00:00:42.180> leave<00:00:42.690> out<00:00:42.900> and

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
is called your perimeter leave out and

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.960 
is called your perimeter leave out and
it's<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.830> hair<00:00:44.010> that<00:00:44.160> you<00:00:44.220> leave<00:00:44.520> out<00:00:44.730> that's

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:02.610 
well you're just gonna carve out that

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.289 
well you're just gonna carve out that
perimeter<00:01:03.120> piece<00:01:03.510> like<00:01:03.750> that<00:01:05.030> your<00:01:06.030> parts

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
perimeter piece like that your parts

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.270 
perimeter piece like that your parts
don't<00:01:06.509> have<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.780> be<00:01:06.899> super<00:01:07.079> neat<00:01:07.289> you<00:01:08.009> know<00:01:08.100> but

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
don't have to be super neat you know but

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.849 
don't have to be super neat you know but
you<00:01:08.369> do<00:01:08.520> want<00:01:08.759> to<00:01:08.789> leave<00:01:08.939> enough<00:01:09.590> so<00:01:10.590> that

00:01:10.849 --> 00:01:10.859 
you do want to leave enough so that

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:14.539 
you do want to leave enough so that
after<00:01:11.399> the<00:01:11.429> braid<00:01:11.729> is<00:01:11.909> done<00:01:12.979> and<00:01:13.979> you<00:01:14.130> pull<00:01:14.399> the

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
after the braid is done and you pull the

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.179 
after the braid is done and you pull the
hair<00:01:14.759> up<00:01:15.140> then<00:01:16.140> you'll<00:01:16.350> know<00:01:16.560> that<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.979> track

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
hair up then you'll know that the track

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.649 
hair up then you'll know that the track
will<00:01:17.340> be<00:01:17.429> covered<00:01:17.789> and<00:01:17.880> this<00:01:18.030> is<00:01:18.149> how<00:01:18.270> you<00:01:18.329> test

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
will be covered and this is how you test

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.569 
will be covered and this is how you test
it<00:01:18.869> so<00:01:19.439> this<00:01:19.560> is<00:01:19.619> your<00:01:19.740> perimeter<00:01:20.310> piece

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:20.579 
it so this is your perimeter piece

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:23.029 
it so this is your perimeter piece
you're<00:01:21.329> gonna<00:01:21.450> take<00:01:21.749> your<00:01:21.899> comb<00:01:22.170> which

00:01:23.029 --> 00:01:23.039 
you're gonna take your comb which

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:24.529 
you're gonna take your comb which
usually<00:01:23.219> it's<00:01:23.490> good<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.729> use<00:01:23.819> a<00:01:23.880> comb<00:01:24.119> of<00:01:24.270> color

00:01:24.529 --> 00:01:24.539 
usually it's good to use a comb of color

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:26.660 
usually it's good to use a comb of color
like<00:01:24.960> this<00:01:25.109> one<00:01:25.319> is<00:01:25.439> pink<00:01:25.679> if<00:01:26.100> you<00:01:26.189> use<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.369> black

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
like this one is pink if you use a black

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.700 
like this one is pink if you use a black
comb<00:01:26.909> it<00:01:27.090> kind<00:01:27.270> of<00:01:27.359> really<00:01:27.659> won't<00:01:27.810> work<00:01:27.899> but<00:01:28.619> if

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
comb it kind of really won't work but if

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.129 
comb it kind of really won't work but if
you<00:01:28.799> have<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:28.950> nice<00:01:29.670> colored<00:01:30.060> comb<00:01:30.270> all<00:01:30.749> you<00:01:30.990> do

is set the comb inside your part pull
the<00:01:34.049> hair<00:01:34.229> up<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.740> if<00:01:35.159> you<00:01:35.280> can<00:01:35.490> see<00:01:35.639> your<00:01:35.819> comb

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
the hair up and if you can see your comb

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.699 
the hair up and if you can see your comb

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.340 
enough
leave<00:01:38.399> out<00:01:38.579> perimeter<00:01:39.090> so<00:01:39.630> right<00:01:39.810> here<00:01:40.049> I<00:01:40.079> can

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
leave out perimeter so right here I can

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.469 
leave out perimeter so right here I can
kind<00:01:40.560> of<00:01:40.649> still<00:01:40.859> see<00:01:41.009> my<00:01:41.159> comb<00:01:41.399> on<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.670> tip<00:01:41.880> so

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
definitely be another video so we're

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.140 
definitely be another video so we're
gonna<00:03:51.260> place<00:03:51.560> our<00:03:51.680> first<00:03:51.890> corn<00:03:52.250> bro<00:03:52.460> cornrow

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
gonna place our first corn bro cornrow

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.410 
gonna place our first corn bro cornrow
here<00:03:53.630> and<00:03:54.490> then<00:03:55.490> we're<00:03:55.610> going<00:03:55.730> to<00:03:55.820> repeat<00:03:56.180> this

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
here and then we're going to repeat this

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:02.760 
here and then we're going to repeat this
cornrow<00:03:56.960> on<00:03:57.260> the<00:03:57.380> other<00:03:57.530> side<00:03:57.830> just<00:04:00.280> like<00:04:01.280> this

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:02.770 
cornrow on the other side just like this

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:05.470 
cornrow on the other side just like this
now<00:04:03.770> this<00:04:03.950> one<00:04:04.220> braid<00:04:04.490> is<00:04:04.640> going<00:04:04.700> to<00:04:04.910> go<00:04:05.030> inside

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
now this one braid is going to go inside

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.240 
now this one braid is going to go inside
our<00:04:05.870> circle<00:04:06.440> braid<00:04:06.620> that<00:04:06.770> we<00:04:06.920> do<00:04:07.040> in<00:04:07.160> the

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
our circle braid that we do in the

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.220 
our circle braid that we do in the
middle<00:04:07.400> so<00:04:08.360> there's<00:04:08.570> no<00:04:08.720> need<00:04:08.900> to<00:04:08.930> necessarily

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
middle so there's no need to necessarily

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.290 
middle so there's no need to necessarily
have<00:04:09.800> to<00:04:09.950> braid<00:04:10.160> it<00:04:10.190> all<00:04:10.520> the<00:04:10.700> way<00:04:10.790> down<00:04:11.000> to<00:04:11.210> the

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:11.300 
have to braid it all the way down to the

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:15.520 
have to braid it all the way down to the
bottom<00:04:11.800> you<00:04:12.800> don't<00:04:12.980> have<00:04:13.100> to<00:04:13.250> do<00:04:13.370> that
