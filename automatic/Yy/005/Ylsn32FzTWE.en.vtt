00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.700
 hello car mazda demio dw3w 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:12.469
 2002 release or ford festiva mini 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:18.840
 the car will tell you now one story 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:24.230
 when you turn the key, the following happens 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:29.670
 thing means extinguishes the airbag and 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:30.949
 there is a squeak I asked on the forums 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:36.510
 what it is 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:39.480
 I was told that maybe I do not have 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.170
 passenger airbag so 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.500
 as she already 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:48.059
 I fired I went to the diagnostician checked 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:52.850
 computer shows that both pillows have 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:55.739
 me on the spot but even after checking 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:59.309
 I still had a diagnostician 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:05.790
 doubts about if i have 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:09.060
 pillow story 2 people who come to me 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:13.580
 for the first time get in the car everyone asks 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:17.420
 what is it I tell them what is it 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:21.090
 alarm unit 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:24.600
 as the installer told me 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:28.890
 alarm what type to hide it under 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:31.770
 the panel was nowhere and apparently the one who 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:35.420
 set this alarm set 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:38.750
 block here is the third story 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.590
 then I filmed a video about the installation 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:44.479
 coasters for the left leg 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:50.270
 one of the subscribers asked me too 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:54.979
 what is it I also answered him 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:58.680
 alarm and it dawned on me 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.880
 alarm then I have a panther and then 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.579
 written by Toyota 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:07.649
 Yes, and electronic sense lektion systems 

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:10.110
 goodness of thought flashed through me 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.450
 this moment it turned out to be easier 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.480
 simple 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:18.190
 it turns out to be an automatic wallet 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:26.200
 for driving on toll roads in Japan and 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:26.200
 when you turn the key, it is he who beeps 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:35.769
 demands that I'm here to insert a card 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:40.450
 Fu money from the heart relieved 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:40.450
 I thought really no passenger cushion 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:46.420
 You live and learn all the while
