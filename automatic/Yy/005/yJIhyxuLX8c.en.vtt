12 x 12 min 24 volt transformer and you
can<00:00:27.570> see<00:00:30.080> these<00:00:31.080> are<00:00:31.230> two<00:00:31.320> capacitors<00:00:31.740> and

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:32.030 
can see these are two capacitors and

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.520 
can see these are two capacitors and
between<00:00:33.030> these<00:00:33.329> gears<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:33.780> bridge<00:00:34.050> bridge

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
you see p 0 DC power there is a ripple

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.380 
you see p 0 DC power there is a ripple
in<00:01:38.299> DC<00:01:39.299> and<00:01:39.720> there<00:01:40.680> is<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:40.799> ripple<00:01:41.009> of<00:01:41.100> %<00:01:42.060> this

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
in DC and there is a ripple of % this

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.700 
in DC and there is a ripple of % this
about<00:01:42.659> pulsating<00:01:43.200> DC<00:01:43.320> so<00:01:45.079> when<00:01:46.079> this

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
about pulsating DC so when this

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.950 
about pulsating DC so when this
pulsating<00:01:47.040> DC<00:01:47.280> cause<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.880> this<00:01:48.479> capacitor

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
pulsating DC cause the this capacitor

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.990 
pulsating DC cause the this capacitor
and<00:01:49.520> this<00:01:50.520> will<00:01:51.119> become<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.390> pure<00:01:51.750> DC<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:53.000> you

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
and this will become a pure DC and you

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.420 
and this will become a pure DC and you
can<00:01:54.149> see<00:01:54.360> if<00:01:54.990> you<00:01:55.170> can<00:01:55.320> see<00:01:55.500> then<00:01:55.680> these<00:01:56.159> two

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
can see if you can see then these two

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.639 
can see if you can see then these two
capacitors<00:01:57.000> are<00:01:57.119> used<00:01:57.149> if<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.320> distance

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
capacitors are used if the distance

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.190 
capacitors are used if the distance
between<00:01:58.939> letting<00:01:59.939> regulate<00:02:00.509> info<00:02:00.899> distance

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.630 
between letting regulate info distance
between<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:01.649> capacitor<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.280> regulator

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
between the capacitor and the regulator

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.210 
between the capacitor and the regulator
is<00:02:03.329> 4<00:02:03.630> inches<00:02:03.770> then

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
is 4 inches then

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.389 
is 4 inches then
just<00:02:07.150> one<00:02:07.600> based<00:02:08.440> upon<00:02:08.740> micro<00:02:08.979> farad<00:02:09.220> is<00:02:09.250> used

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
just one based upon micro farad is used

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:17.420 
just one based upon micro farad is used
because<00:02:11.490> two<00:02:12.490> can<00:02:13.270> work<00:02:14.850> to<00:02:16.020> finish<00:02:17.020> the

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
because two can work to finish the

show the output of the circuit via

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:22.680 
show the output of the circuit via
natural<00:03:14.320> useless<00:03:14.739> ass<00:03:15.450> so<00:03:16.450> sad<00:03:17.250> remember<00:03:21.690> to

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
natural useless ass so sad remember to

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:31.930 
natural useless ass so sad remember to
scoop

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.290 

you<00:03:32.940> can<00:03:33.090> see<00:03:33.300> these<00:03:33.960> are<00:03:34.080> zero<00:03:34.350> zero<00:03:34.890> voltage

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:35.300 
you can see these are zero zero voltage

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:42.170 
you can see these are zero zero voltage
when<00:03:36.300> I<00:03:36.330> connect<00:03:37.070> this<00:03:38.070> to<00:03:40.310> you<00:03:41.310> can<00:03:41.520> see<00:03:41.760> this

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
when I connect this to you can see this

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:50.180 
when I connect this to you can see this
is<00:03:42.330> a<00:03:42.360> 13-point<00:03:47.360> 13<00:03:48.650> negative<00:03:49.650> holding<00:03:49.920> boards

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
is a 13-point 13 negative holding boards

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:55.190 
is a 13-point 13 negative holding boards
so<00:03:51.150> when<00:03:52.430> connect<00:03:53.430> this<00:03:53.700> to<00:03:53.970> the<00:03:54.330> positive

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
so when connect this to the positive

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.790 
so when connect this to the positive
supply<00:03:55.320> then<00:03:56.180> you<00:03:57.180> can<00:03:57.300> see<00:03:57.510> this<00:03:57.690> is<00:03:57.840> a<00:03:57.900> 7.2

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
supply then you can see this is a 7.2

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.360 
supply then you can see this is a 7.2
volt<00:03:59.070> and<00:03:59.660> it<00:04:00.660> can<00:04:00.840> be<00:04:00.870> very<00:04:00.990> form<00:04:01.440> the

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
volt and it can be very form the

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:09.950 
volt and it can be very form the
variable<00:04:02.730> resistance<00:04:03.320> so<00:04:04.320> I<00:04:08.000> hope<00:04:09.000> you<00:04:09.780> like

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:09.960 
variable resistance so I hope you like

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.170 
variable resistance so I hope you like
it
