00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380

colors<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:22.979> could<00:01:23.100> also<00:01:23.220> do<00:01:23.490> just<00:01:24.000> normal

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270

green<00:01:24.450> roll<00:01:24.689> but<00:01:25.470> I<00:01:25.500> think<00:01:25.770> that<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.100> lime

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
green roll but I think that the lime

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.609 
green roll but I think that the lime
green<00:01:26.580> looks<00:01:26.790> better<00:01:27.000> for<00:01:27.689> Christmassy<00:01:28.380> a

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
green looks better for Christmassy a

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.590 
green looks better for Christmassy a
little<00:01:29.070> bit<00:01:29.159> brighter<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:29.939> could<00:01:30.090> also<00:01:30.240> do

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
little bit brighter you could also do

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.850 
little bit brighter you could also do
the<00:01:30.810> stained<00:01:31.409> clay<00:01:31.650> too<00:01:32.390> or<00:01:33.619> stained<00:01:34.619> glass

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
the stained clay too or stained glass

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.530 
the stained clay too or stained glass
you<00:01:35.579> can<00:01:35.700> you<00:01:35.850> can<00:01:36.000> really<00:01:36.210> do<00:01:36.329> whatever

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
you can you can really do whatever

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.560 
you can you can really do whatever
blocks<00:01:36.930> in<00:01:37.200> between<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.770> lamps<00:01:38.400> you<00:01:38.549> want<00:01:38.759> but

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
blocks in between the lamps you want but

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.300 
blocks in between the lamps you want but
these<00:01:39.869> are<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.170> two<00:01:40.320> I'm<00:01:40.530> going<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.860> think<00:01:41.009> and

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
these are the two I'm going to think and

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.639

then we are going to need some red Sun

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.980 
then we are going to need some red Sun
lamps<00:01:44.570> some<00:01:45.570> redstone<00:01:45.780> repeaters

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
lamps some redstone repeaters

well BAM so um the lever you're actually

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:57.800 
well BAM so um the lever you're actually
not<00:01:55.500> gonna<00:01:55.770> need<00:01:56.190> for<00:01:56.700> it<00:01:56.790> to<00:01:56.910> work<00:01:57.120> so<00:01:57.510> you

00:01:58.970 --> 00:01:58.980 
could just borrow one

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.190 
could just borrow one
but<00:01:59.370> the<00:01:59.910> levers<00:02:00.270> are<00:02:00.390> really<00:02:00.540> easy<00:02:00.720> to<00:02:00.870> craft

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
but the levers are really easy to craft

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.880 
but the levers are really easy to craft
so<00:02:01.560> so<00:02:02.340> first<00:02:02.640> of<00:02:02.850> all<00:02:02.970> I<00:02:03.560> don't<00:02:04.560> know<00:02:04.710> why<00:02:04.860> I

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
so so first of all I don't know why I

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:11.080 
so so first of all I don't know why I
did<00:02:05.160> a<00:02:05.220> half<00:02:05.370> slab<00:02:05.760> roof<00:02:08.660> Oh

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
did a half slab roof Oh

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.610 
did a half slab roof Oh
so<00:02:12.090> first<00:02:12.480> of<00:02:12.570> all<00:02:12.630> I'm<00:02:12.720> just<00:02:12.870> gonna<00:02:12.990> alternate

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
so first of all I'm just gonna alternate

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.830 
so first of all I'm just gonna alternate
the<00:02:13.950> colors<00:02:14.340> like<00:02:14.820> this<00:02:15.000> if<00:02:15.330> you're<00:02:15.570> using

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
the colors like this if you're using

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.110 
the colors like this if you're using
different<00:02:16.320> colors<00:02:16.670> that's<00:02:17.670> what<00:02:17.820> I<00:02:17.910> would<00:02:18.030> do

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
different colors that's what I would do

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.400 
different colors that's what I would do
is<00:02:18.270> alternate<00:02:18.690> them<00:02:18.870> like<00:02:19.050> that

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
is alternate them like that

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.930 
is alternate them like that
and<00:02:19.500> then<00:02:20.070> place<00:02:20.459> the<00:02:20.640> lamps<00:02:21.060> in<00:02:21.360> between<00:02:21.810> them

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
and then place the lamps in between them

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.000 
and then place the lamps in between them
so<00:02:23.940> if<00:02:24.570> you're<00:02:24.840> doing<00:02:25.140> whatever<00:02:25.620> color<00:02:25.860> you

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
so if you're doing whatever color you

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.620 
so if you're doing whatever color you
want<00:02:26.100> just<00:02:26.520> make<00:02:26.640> sure<00:02:26.850> the<00:02:26.970> lamps<00:02:27.300> are<00:02:27.420> wood

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
want just make sure the lamps are wood

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.160 
want just make sure the lamps are wood
there's<00:02:27.810> a<00:02:27.900> black<00:02:28.260> in<00:02:28.440> between<00:02:28.709> each<00:02:28.830> lamp<00:02:30.170> you

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
there's a black in between each lamp you

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.660 
there's a black in between each lamp you
could<00:02:31.290> probably<00:02:31.470> do<00:02:31.740> with<00:02:31.770> the<00:02:32.130> lamps<00:02:32.400> next<00:02:32.610> to

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
could probably do with the lamps next to

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.280 
could probably do with the lamps next to
each<00:02:32.760> other<00:02:32.820> but<00:02:33.090> I'm<00:02:33.300> not<00:02:33.570> that<00:02:33.780> skilled<00:02:34.140> in

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
each other but I'm not that skilled in

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.230 
each other but I'm not that skilled in
redstone<00:02:34.890> so<00:02:35.640> I'm<00:02:35.730> kind<00:02:35.910> of<00:02:35.940> making<00:02:36.090> this

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
redstone so I'm kind of making this

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.460 
redstone so I'm kind of making this
video<00:02:36.510> for<00:02:36.540> other<00:02:36.810> people<00:02:37.080> who<00:02:37.140> aren't<00:02:37.260> desk

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
video for other people who aren't desk

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.740 
video for other people who aren't desk
and<00:02:37.770> redstone<00:02:38.070> but<00:02:38.490> want<00:02:39.420> some<00:02:39.570> cool

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
and redstone but want some cool

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.720 
and redstone but want some cool
Christmas<00:02:40.050> lights<00:02:40.440> and<00:02:40.890> if<00:02:40.980> you<00:02:41.070> are<00:02:41.280> skilled

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
Christmas lights and if you are skilled

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.240 
Christmas lights and if you are skilled
in<00:02:41.790> redstone<00:02:42.270> and<00:02:42.570> then<00:02:42.690> feel<00:02:43.080> free<00:02:43.140> to<00:02:43.410> adjust

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
in redstone and then feel free to adjust

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.970 
in redstone and then feel free to adjust
this<00:02:44.880> however<00:02:45.240> you<00:02:45.810> would<00:02:45.900> like<00:02:45.980> um<00:02:46.980> so<00:02:47.630> let's

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
this however you would like um so let's

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.220 
this however you would like um so let's
start<00:02:50.390> with<00:02:51.390> some<00:02:51.510> redstone<00:02:51.660> behind<00:02:52.110> these

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
start with some redstone behind these

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.979 
start with some redstone behind these
and<00:02:52.440> lamps<00:02:52.890> there<00:02:53.519> we<00:02:53.610> go<00:02:53.700> like<00:02:53.910> that<00:02:54.120> you<00:02:54.720> want

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
and lamps there we go like that you want

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:58.850 
and lamps there we go like that you want
to<00:02:55.700> backwards<00:02:57.050> and<00:02:58.050> now<00:02:58.230> we're<00:02:58.500> going<00:02:58.650> to

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
to backwards and now we're going to

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.400 
to backwards and now we're going to
craft<00:02:59.220> or<00:02:59.670> make<00:03:00.060> these<00:03:00.300> little<00:03:00.540> arches<00:03:01.110> so

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
craft or make these little arches so

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.830 
craft or make these little arches so
that<00:03:01.500> our<00:03:01.560> outcome<00:03:01.830> stone<00:03:02.220> can<00:03:02.489> travel<00:03:02.840> you

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
that our outcome stone can travel you

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.890 
that our outcome stone can travel you
could<00:03:04.410> do<00:03:04.709> one<00:03:05.220> on<00:03:05.370> for<00:03:05.880> that<00:03:06.060> light<00:03:06.330> one<00:03:06.690> for

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
could do one on for that light one for

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.390 
could do one on for that light one for
that<00:03:06.989> light<00:03:07.260> and<00:03:07.410> one<00:03:07.560> for<00:03:07.739> that<00:03:07.890> light<00:03:08.160> but

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
that light and one for that light but

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.220 
that light and one for that light but
that's<00:03:08.480> three<00:03:09.480> of<00:03:09.690> them<00:03:09.810> you're<00:03:09.959> gonna<00:03:10.050> have

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230

to redstone this up you're gonna place
redstone<00:03:46.330> here<00:03:46.900> and<00:03:47.620> then<00:03:47.739> you're<00:03:47.860> gonna<00:03:47.950> go

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
redstone here and then you're gonna go

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.490 
redstone here and then you're gonna go
over<00:03:48.459> the<00:03:48.819> arches<00:03:49.330> and<00:03:49.660> then<00:03:49.989> right<00:03:50.110> there<00:03:50.290> so

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
over the arches and then right there so

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.860 
over the arches and then right there so
connects<00:03:50.830> to<00:03:51.010> that<00:03:51.190> one<00:03:52.150> and<00:03:52.420> then<00:03:52.540> go<00:03:52.720> over

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
connects to that one and then go over

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.750 
connects to that one and then go over
the<00:03:53.050> arch<00:03:53.290> again<00:03:53.500> and<00:03:54.069> then<00:03:54.220> connect<00:03:54.550> it<00:03:54.640> to

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
the arch again and then connect it to

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.520 
the arch again and then connect it to
that<00:03:54.910> one<00:03:55.090> and<00:03:55.330> then<00:03:55.630> these<00:03:55.810> ones<00:03:56.080> right<00:03:56.350> here

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
that one and then these ones right here

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.190 
that one and then these ones right here
you<00:03:57.190> want<00:03:57.370> to<00:03:57.430> bring<00:03:57.580> those<00:03:57.840> under<00:03:58.840> the<00:03:59.020> arch

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
you want to bring those under the arch

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.750 
you want to bring those under the arch
and<00:03:59.860> so<00:04:01.320> now<00:04:02.320> the<00:04:02.380> two<00:04:03.160> they<00:04:03.400> go<00:04:03.519> under<00:04:03.730> the

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
and so now the two they go under the

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.970 
and so now the two they go under the
arch<00:04:03.970> in<00:04:04.150> mind<00:04:04.360> depending<00:04:05.200> on<00:04:05.620> the<00:04:05.709> size<00:04:05.890> of

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
arch in mind depending on the size of

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.320 
arch in mind depending on the size of
your<00:04:06.100> house<00:04:06.190> you're<00:04:06.760> gonna<00:04:06.850> want<00:04:07.060> to<00:04:07.090> connect

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.330 
your house you're gonna want to connect

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:08.520 
your house you're gonna want to connect
those<00:04:07.480> like<00:04:07.660> that<00:04:07.840> and<00:04:08.050> then<00:04:08.200> just<00:04:08.320> go

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
those like that and then just go

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.710 
those like that and then just go
unblocked<00:04:09.040> and<00:04:09.400> then<00:04:09.970> this<00:04:10.120> one<00:04:10.300> is<00:04:10.450> I'm<00:04:10.570> gonna

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
unblocked and then this one is I'm gonna

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.280 
unblocked and then this one is I'm gonna
bring<00:04:10.989> it<00:04:11.200> out<00:04:11.260> even<00:04:12.250> to<00:04:12.519> that<00:04:12.700> right<00:04:13.000> there

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
bring it out even to that right there

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:20.250 
bring it out even to that right there
now<00:04:15.359> we<00:04:16.359> have<00:04:16.630> to<00:04:16.810> set<00:04:17.079> up<00:04:17.200> the<00:04:18.040> system<00:04:19.109> to<00:04:20.109> make

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
now we have to set up the system to make

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.380 
now we have to set up the system to make
them<00:04:20.440> alternate<00:04:20.950> so<00:04:21.489> you're<00:04:21.940> standing<00:04:22.270> like

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:22.390 
them alternate so you're standing like

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.330 
them alternate so you're standing like
right<00:04:22.419> here<00:04:22.840> at<00:04:23.169> the<00:04:23.350> edge<00:04:23.440> of<00:04:23.470> it<00:04:23.710> you<00:04:24.190> don't

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
right here at the edge of it you don't

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:25.620 
right here at the edge of it you don't
know<00:04:24.400> place<00:04:24.610> a<00:04:24.640> repeater<00:04:24.820> facing<00:04:25.180> that<00:04:25.479> way

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
know place a repeater facing that way

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.690 
know place a repeater facing that way
and<00:04:26.530> then<00:04:26.620> place<00:04:26.860> another<00:04:26.889> one<00:04:27.160> facing<00:04:27.550> this

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
and then place another one facing this

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.210 
and then place another one facing this
way<00:04:28.080> another<00:04:29.080> one<00:04:29.200> facing<00:04:29.500> this<00:04:29.590> way<00:04:29.650> and<00:04:29.979> then

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
way another one facing this way and then

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.090 
way another one facing this way and then
another<00:04:30.340> I'm<00:04:30.490> facing<00:04:30.700> this<00:04:30.940> way<00:04:31.000> so<00:04:31.950> it'll<00:04:32.950> go

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 
another I'm facing this way so it'll go

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:34.860 
another I'm facing this way so it'll go
in<00:04:33.190> a<00:04:33.250> circle<00:04:33.520> if<00:04:33.970> your<00:04:34.150> redstone<00:04:34.330> if<00:04:34.690> your

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
in a circle if your redstone if your

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.180 
in a circle if your redstone if your
repeaters<00:04:35.320> are<00:04:35.440> just<00:04:35.560> kind<00:04:35.740> of<00:04:35.770> like<00:04:35.890> stopping

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
repeaters are just kind of like stopping

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.750 
repeaters are just kind of like stopping
that<00:04:37.000> probably<00:04:37.419> means<00:04:37.600> you<00:04:37.840> did<00:04:37.990> something

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
that probably means you did something

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.100 
that probably means you did something
like<00:04:39.760> this<00:04:39.820> where<00:04:40.479> they're<00:04:40.600> facing<00:04:40.780> each

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
like this where they're facing each

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.920 
like this where they're facing each
other<00:04:41.350> but<00:04:42.040> we<00:04:42.190> want<00:04:42.400> them<00:04:42.550> to<00:04:43.060> all<00:04:43.210> be<00:04:43.240> flick

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
other but we want them to all be flick

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:45.240 
other but we want them to all be flick
going<00:04:44.200> around<00:04:44.410> in<00:04:44.560> a<00:04:44.650> circle<00:04:44.860> in<00:04:45.039> the<00:04:45.100> same

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
going around in a circle in the same

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.750 
going around in a circle in the same
direction<00:04:45.720> setting<00:04:46.720> on<00:04:46.810> in<00:04:46.900> place<00:04:47.080> redstone

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:47.760 
direction setting on in place redstone

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.850 
direction setting on in place redstone
between<00:04:48.760> them<00:04:48.940> like<00:04:49.450> that<00:04:49.660> and<00:04:50.500> you're<00:04:50.830> a

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
between them like that and you're a

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.880 
between them like that and you're a
lever<00:04:51.190> right<00:04:51.400> there<00:04:51.900> really<00:04:52.900> whatever<00:04:53.080> as

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:53.890 
lever right there really whatever as

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:55.469 
lever right there really whatever as
long<00:04:54.160> as<00:04:54.250> it<00:04:54.340> connects<00:04:54.580> that<00:04:54.880> redstone<00:04:55.090> and

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:55.479 
long as it connects that redstone and

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:59.250 
long as it connects that redstone and
then<00:04:56.580> the<00:04:57.580> one<00:04:57.820> closest<00:04:58.600> to<00:04:58.690> the<00:04:58.840> lights<00:04:59.050> on

00:04:59.250 --> 00:04:59.260 
then the one closest to the lights on

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.500 
then the one closest to the lights on
this<00:04:59.410> side<00:04:59.620> we're<00:05:00.160> gonna<00:05:00.310> make<00:05:00.460> that<00:05:00.669> all

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:01.510 
this side we're gonna make that all

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.330 
this side we're gonna make that all
those<00:05:02.050> many<00:05:02.260> ticks<00:05:02.530> us<00:05:02.710> as<00:05:02.830> we<00:05:02.950> can<00:05:03.100> get<00:05:03.220> it

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 
those many ticks us as we can get it

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:04.380 
those many ticks us as we can get it
however<00:05:03.640> many<00:05:03.700> that<00:05:03.880> is

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:04.390 
however many that is

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:07.290 
however many that is
one<00:05:04.840> two<00:05:05.350> three<00:05:05.920> click<00:05:06.370> it<00:05:06.490> three<00:05:06.790> times<00:05:07.030> right

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.010 
click it three times and then this one

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:10.140 
click it three times and then this one
you're<00:05:09.130> gonna<00:05:09.190> unread<00:05:09.550> click<00:05:09.760> three<00:05:09.940> times

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
you're gonna unread click three times

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.810 
you're gonna unread click three times
one<00:05:10.870> two<00:05:11.080> three<00:05:11.500> and<00:05:11.710> then<00:05:12.310> this<00:05:12.460> one<00:05:12.670> just

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:12.820 
one two three and then this one just

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.420 
one two three and then this one just
wants<00:05:13.060> one<00:05:13.960> and<00:05:14.200> then<00:05:14.800> that<00:05:14.950> one<00:05:15.010> which<00:05:15.340> is

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430 
wants one and then that one which is

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:19.380 
wants one and then that one which is
gonna<00:05:15.550> lead<00:05:15.780> so<00:05:16.780> now<00:05:17.220> we've<00:05:18.220> pretty<00:05:18.910> much<00:05:19.000> got

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:19.390 
gonna lead so now we've pretty much got

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:21.320 
gonna lead so now we've pretty much got
it<00:05:19.480> all<00:05:19.630> set<00:05:19.960> up<00:05:20.080> like<00:05:20.260> that<00:05:20.410> over<00:05:20.620> there<00:05:20.770> and

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:21.330 
it all set up like that over there and

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.390 
it all set up like that over there and
you're<00:05:22.330> going<00:05:22.510> to<00:05:22.630> really<00:05:23.320> quick<00:05:23.530> just<00:05:23.800> flip

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:24.400 
you're going to really quick just flip

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.680 
you're going to really quick just flip
the<00:05:24.490> switch<00:05:24.520> you're<00:05:24.790> gonna<00:05:24.940> click<00:05:25.270> click<00:05:25.420> like

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:25.690 
the switch you're gonna click click like

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:29.040 
the switch you're gonna click click like
this<00:05:25.870> ready<00:05:26.820> like<00:05:27.820> that<00:05:28.090> so<00:05:28.570> it<00:05:28.660> sends<00:05:28.870> this

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.050 
this ready like that so it sends this

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:30.330 
this ready like that so it sends this
pulse<00:05:29.380> and<00:05:29.620> they'll<00:05:29.710> just<00:05:29.860> go<00:05:30.040> around<00:05:30.130> the

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:30.340 
pulse and they'll just go around the

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:32.640 
pulse and they'll just go around the
circle<00:05:30.700> and<00:05:30.880> then<00:05:31.420> it<00:05:31.690> will<00:05:32.080> turn<00:05:32.380> these
