00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.130
 little is better than a fresh one 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:19.700
 home-baked cake and this basic recipe 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:21.110
 always preheat the oven to 180 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.000
 degrees 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.080
 meanwhile with you a cake tin with 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.580
 butter 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.920
 that is very easy with the remainder 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.660
 butter on a butter wrap 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.580
 put a suitable sheet of baking paper in the 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.350
 greased form or sprinkle with a 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.390
 tablespoon flour 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.890
 both techniques ensure that the 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.020
 cake will easily come out of the mold 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.910
 A standard cake is also called one 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.710
 hangover called each other 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.600
 the four ingredients have 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:48.290
 same ratio 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:52.460
 I use 200 grams of butter 4 eggs 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:54.110
 200 grams of sugar and 200 grams of flour 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.000
 make sure all ingredients are up 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.410
 be room temperature 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.410
 then rice cake nice and even 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:05.030
 cut the butter into pieces and then mix with 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.560
 the sugar to a creamy mass 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.039
 that is easiest with a mixer 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:13.600
 and takes approximately 10 minutes 

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:13.600
 then mix in the eggs one by one 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:30.119
 and then add the flour through this 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:32.299
 the first seven mixes the batter even better 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.319
 you can now also add some extra flavor 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:37.280
 for example, some grated lemon zest 

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:37.280
 or vanilla 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.890
 Pour the batter into the cake tin 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.950
 cake about an hour in the 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.350
 preheated oven at 180 degrees 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.390
 the cake must be golden brown 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.729
 keep an eye on for the cooking time may vary 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.470
 about differences 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.970
 then remove the cake from the oven and insert 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.849
 a skewer in the cake every 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:03.770
 doneness to test if the punctures there 

00:01:59.849 --> 00:02:03.770
 the cake is good without batter
