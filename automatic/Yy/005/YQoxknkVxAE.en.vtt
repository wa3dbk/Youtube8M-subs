00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.250
 and hello to everyone and with you Artem and today I 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.070
 would like to tell you about how 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:13.620
 install shaders 1.5.2 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.260
 for the version above I hardly know for sure 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.539
 will work like that as you know by 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.400
 my recent review on minecraft 1 6 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.830
 release 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.939
 instead of pack textures appeared 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.310
 resource packs which also contains 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.420
 mods are therefore unlikely to work this way 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:32.570
 didn't drive well 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.989
 opening the mainkvrat enter your nickname and 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.910
 password 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.910
 if you are a licensed user 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:46.110
 just press now but talk and 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:48.760
 force of duty all now press login 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.489
 well, or just in the usual launcher 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.470
 you will be pirated or upgrade client 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.860
 Such a thing or force update, and 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:59.250
 tick and enter the game 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.989
 but so that you know you have 0 from all saves 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.150
 all fashion short simply my 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:07.930
 bed honey and upgrade were a file 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:11.290
 and once again shakes shorter like this 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:14.500
 is now being installed here 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:17.970
 rather we just download a little bit 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.970
 wait they all count downloaded 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.010
 Now we go in payment and if someone does not 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.830
 knows how to do it then do it 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.540
