00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:46.140 
to teach him any tricks I was just

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.920 
to teach him any tricks I was just
trying<00:04:46.380> to<00:04:46.470> renew<00:04:46.800> his<00:04:46.980> mind<00:04:47.310> and<00:04:47.670> open<00:04:48.480> up<00:04:48.780> a

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
trying to renew his mind and open up a

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.320 
trying to renew his mind and open up a
vision<00:04:49.410> for<00:04:49.710> him<00:04:49.920> and<00:04:50.310> I<00:04:50.490> think<00:04:50.550> that<00:04:51.000> when<00:04:51.300> you

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
vision for him and I think that when you

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.740 
vision for him and I think that when you
get<00:04:51.570> a<00:04:51.630> fighter<00:04:51.960> like<00:04:52.940> Aamir<00:04:53.940> Khan<00:04:54.240> or<00:04:54.540> any

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
get a fighter like Aamir Khan or any

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.300 
get a fighter like Aamir Khan or any
other<00:04:55.020> fighter<00:04:55.350> you<00:04:55.650> know<00:04:55.680> you<00:04:55.830> have<00:04:56.040> to<00:04:56.160> give

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
other fighter you know you have to give

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.700 
other fighter you know you have to give
them<00:04:56.430> the<00:04:56.610> vision<00:04:57.060> first<00:04:57.360> and<00:04:57.600> once<00:04:57.780> they<00:04:58.020> see

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
them the vision first and once they see

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.170 
them the vision first and once they see
the<00:04:58.860> vision<00:04:59.070> then<00:04:59.430> they<00:04:59.550> understand<00:05:00.060> the

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
the vision then they understand the

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.570 
the vision then they understand the
philosophy<00:05:00.360> behind<00:05:00.960> it<00:05:01.560> and<00:05:01.770> then<00:05:02.430> you'll

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
philosophy behind it and then you'll

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.460 
philosophy behind it and then you'll
find<00:05:02.880> out<00:05:03.060> if<00:05:03.180> they<00:05:03.300> could<00:05:03.510> they<00:05:03.960> were<00:05:04.020> already

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
find out if they could they were already

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:10.160 
find out if they could they were already
able<00:05:04.830> to<00:05:05.460> do<00:05:05.700> that<00:05:05.940> so<00:05:06.770> I<00:05:08.360> think<00:05:09.360> that's<00:05:09.870> where

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:10.170 
able to do that so I think that's where

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:12.620 
able to do that so I think that's where
you<00:05:10.350> can<00:05:10.680> see<00:05:10.860> the<00:05:10.980> progression<00:05:11.160> he's<00:05:11.820> slowing

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.630 
you can see the progression he's slowing

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:14.060 
you can see the progression he's slowing
it<00:05:12.810> up<00:05:12.960> you've<00:05:13.140> once<00:05:13.410> you<00:05:13.530> find<00:05:13.770> out<00:05:13.890> his

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.070 
it up you've once you find out his

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:17.480 
it up you've once you find out his
personality<00:05:15.030> is<00:05:15.240> uh<00:05:16.220> you<00:05:17.220> know<00:05:17.310> his

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490 
personality is uh you know his

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:19.280 
personality is uh you know his
tendencies<00:05:17.730> you<00:05:18.420> know<00:05:18.540> he<00:05:18.810> does<00:05:18.990> everything

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:19.290 
tendencies you know he does everything
