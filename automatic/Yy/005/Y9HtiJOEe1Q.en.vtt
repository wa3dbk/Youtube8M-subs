00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:35.780 
curse ratchet bomb seems actually pretty
good<00:03:32.010> here<00:03:33.920> so<00:03:34.920> we're<00:03:35.310> going<00:03:35.370> to<00:03:35.489> take<00:03:35.549> out<00:03:35.700> the

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
good here so we're going to take out the

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:36.979 
good here so we're going to take out the
chalice<00:03:36.180> because<00:03:36.390> it's<00:03:36.540> an<00:03:36.599> aggressive

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
chalice because it's an aggressive

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:43.670 
chalice because it's an aggressive
matchup<00:03:39.260> so<00:03:40.260> make<00:03:40.379> sense<00:03:40.620> I<00:03:40.860> don't<00:03:41.579> know<00:03:42.680> two

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
matchup so make sense I don't know two

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.100 
matchup so make sense I don't know two
more<00:03:43.829> cards<00:03:44.180> probably<00:03:45.180> two<00:03:45.629> dissipates

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
more cards probably two dissipates

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:47.509 
more cards probably two dissipates
actually<00:03:46.739> will<00:03:46.829> take<00:03:46.920> out<00:03:47.010> three<00:03:47.190> dissipates

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
actually will take out three dissipates

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:53.569 
actually will take out three dissipates
and<00:03:47.700> leave<00:03:47.819> one<00:03:47.970> chalice<00:03:48.420> in<00:03:51.200> and<00:03:52.220> that<00:03:53.220> seems

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579 
and leave one chalice in and that seems

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:55.009 
and leave one chalice in and that seems
ok<00:03:53.849> I<00:03:53.879> don't<00:03:54.060> actually<00:03:54.150> know<00:03:54.329> if<00:03:54.450> I<00:03:54.510> want<00:03:54.660> Carla

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
ok I don't actually know if I want Carla

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:57.020 
ok I don't actually know if I want Carla
brain<00:03:55.230> in<00:03:55.379> the<00:03:55.530> deck<00:03:55.709> I<00:03:56.010> think<00:03:56.609> I<00:03:56.670> do<00:03:56.730> leave<00:03:57.000> the

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
brain in the deck I think I do leave the

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:04.470 
brain in the deck I think I do leave the
chalices<00:03:57.510> in

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.230 

probably<00:04:05.480> want<00:04:05.600> to<00:04:05.660> ring<00:04:05.930> for<00:04:05.960> one<00:04:06.230> chels<00:04:06.500> so

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:07.240 
probably want to ring for one chels so

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:11.140 
probably want to ring for one chels so
okay<00:04:08.240> that's<00:04:08.390> what<00:04:08.780> we're<00:04:08.870> going<00:04:08.960> to<00:04:09.050> try
