it's going to be at this constant the
whole<00:01:48.630> time<00:01:48.869> so<00:01:49.110> 4.4<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:50.220> our<00:01:50.310> idle<00:01:50.640> temps<00:01:50.909> are

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.639 
let's look at the loews 42 43 42 39 41
42<00:01:56.390> so<00:01:57.619> you<00:01:58.619> know<00:01:58.969> not<00:01:59.969> amazing<00:02:00.930> but<00:02:01.110> it's

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
42 so you know not amazing but it's

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.350 
42 so you know not amazing but it's
there<00:02:01.860> pretty<00:02:02.070> good<00:02:02.340> but<00:02:02.670> I've<00:02:02.790> really<00:02:03.210> heard

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
there pretty good but I've really heard

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.959 
there pretty good but I've really heard
that<00:02:03.600> this<00:02:03.719> thing<00:02:04.170> shines<00:02:04.649> under<00:02:05.250> load<00:02:05.579> and

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
that this thing shines under load and

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.889 
that this thing shines under load and
overclock<00:02:06.659> so<00:02:07.229> let's<00:02:07.530> oh<00:02:08.390> yeah<00:02:09.390> let's<00:02:09.599> get<00:02:09.840> a

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
overclock so let's oh yeah let's get a

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.650 
overclock so let's oh yeah let's get a
look<00:02:10.020> at<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.289> ambient<00:02:10.770> again<00:02:10.950> it's

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
look at the ambient again it's

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.330 
look at the ambient again it's
me<00:02:11.720> 7<00:02:11.960> degrees<00:02:12.200> Celsius<00:02:12.620> so<00:02:12.830> it<00:02:12.920> is<00:02:13.010> still

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
me 7 degrees Celsius so it is still

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.440 
me 7 degrees Celsius so it is still
rather<00:02:13.670> warm<00:02:14.120> in<00:02:14.300> here<00:02:15.040> let's<00:02:16.040> go<00:02:16.190> ahead<00:02:16.280> and

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
rather warm in here let's go ahead and

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.710 
rather warm in here let's go ahead and
just<00:02:17.450> 80<00:02:17.690> degrees<00:02:17.990> roughly<00:02:18.320> in<00:02:18.710> Fahrenheit<00:02:19.720> so

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
just 80 degrees roughly in Fahrenheit so

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.720 
just 80 degrees roughly in Fahrenheit so
it<00:02:21.290> is<00:02:21.410> warm<00:02:21.710> in<00:02:21.830> here<00:02:21.860> so<00:02:22.220> you<00:02:22.310> have<00:02:22.370> to<00:02:22.610> give

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
it is warm in here so you have to give

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.730 
it is warm in here so you have to give
it<00:02:22.850> a<00:02:22.880> little<00:02:23.000> bit<00:02:23.270> of<00:02:23.450> leeway<00:02:23.990> on<00:02:24.140> that<00:02:24.350> but

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
it a little bit of leeway on that but

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:25.930 
it a little bit of leeway on that but
let's<00:02:24.890> go<00:02:25.010> ahead<00:02:25.040> and<00:02:25.220> get<00:02:25.400> her<00:02:25.490> under<00:02:25.700> prime

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
let's go ahead and get her under prime

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.130 
let's go ahead and get her under prime
for<00:02:26.120> about<00:02:26.270> 10<00:02:26.450> minutes<00:02:26.630> we'll<00:02:26.840> come<00:02:26.960> get<00:02:27.110> you

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
guys all right so it's been up over 10

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.550

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
minutes here we have our high 70 of the

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.870 
minutes here we have our high 70 of the
same<00:02:33.710> clock<00:02:33.920> at<00:02:34.100> 4.4<00:02:34.700> here<00:02:35.420> our<00:02:35.630> temps<00:02:36.230> I<00:02:36.380> mean

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
same clock at 4.4 here our temps I mean

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.070 
same clock at 4.4 here our temps I mean
79-77<00:02:37.880> 75<00:02:38.360> 74<00:02:38.780> 76<00:02:39.080> I<00:02:39.350> mean<00:02:39.380> nine<00:02:39.860> so<00:02:40.960> not<00:02:41.960> as

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
79-77 75 74 76 I mean nine so not as

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.960 
79-77 75 74 76 I mean nine so not as
good<00:02:42.230> as<00:02:42.320> that<00:02:42.350> was<00:02:42.590> anticipating<00:02:43.520> but<00:02:43.700> still

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
good as that was anticipating but still

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.420 
good as that was anticipating but still
pretty<00:02:44.150> darn<00:02:44.450> good<00:02:44.570> considering<00:02:45.350> how<00:02:45.710> hot<00:02:46.280> it

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
pretty darn good considering how hot it

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.820 
pretty darn good considering how hot it
is<00:02:46.520> it<00:02:46.880> is<00:02:47.030> currently<00:02:49.990> 27.5<00:02:50.990> as<00:02:51.350> you<00:02:51.440> can<00:02:51.620> see

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
is it is currently 27.5 as you can see

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.970 
is it is currently 27.5 as you can see
so<00:02:52.610> it's<00:02:53.030> still<00:02:53.390> about<00:02:53.840> 80<00:02:54.200> degrees<00:02:54.590> in<00:02:54.800> here

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
so it's still about 80 degrees in here

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.320 
so it's still about 80 degrees in here
is<00:02:55.190> boiling<00:02:55.670> boiling<00:02:56.060> boiling<00:02:56.450> hot<00:02:58.150> so<00:02:59.150> yeah

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
is boiling boiling boiling hot so yeah

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.450 
is boiling boiling boiling hot so yeah
it's<00:02:59.540> still<00:02:59.690> pretty<00:03:00.230> darn<00:03:00.500> good<00:03:00.590> now<00:03:01.160> i'm

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:01.460

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
really kind of hard against performance

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.440 
really kind of hard against performance
we're<00:03:33.680> going<00:03:33.920> to<00:03:33.980> see<00:03:34.160> we're<00:03:34.970> going<00:03:35.209> to<00:03:35.270> see

didn't put it in because for the review
because<00:03:49.790> you're<00:03:50.090> only<00:03:50.300> going<00:03:50.540> to<00:03:50.630> get<00:03:50.690> to<00:03:50.930> to

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.080 
because you're only going to get to to

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:54.880 
begin with so to put a third fan in
there<00:03:53.239> would<00:03:53.390> be<00:03:53.420> unfair<00:03:53.810> but<00:03:54.410> we<00:03:54.620> will<00:03:54.860> be

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 
there would be unfair but we will be

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
that performance we really haven't put

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.020 
that performance we really haven't put
to<00:04:17.330> any<00:04:17.450> cooler

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
a whole ton of coolers but i'm pretty

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:25.730 
a whole ton of coolers but i'm pretty
comfortable<00:04:24.690> with<00:04:25.020> the<00:04:25.170> temps<00:04:25.440> right<00:04:25.590> now<00:04:25.710> i

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
comfortable with the temps right now i

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.400 
comfortable with the temps right now i
mean<00:04:25.889> we're<00:04:26.700> still<00:04:27.000> under<00:04:27.240> load<00:04:27.450> from<00:04:27.930> before

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
mean we're still under load from before

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:33.020 
mean we're still under load from before
and<00:04:28.440> we're<00:04:29.340> not<00:04:29.430> even<00:04:29.700> in<00:04:30.000> the<00:04:30.240> 80s<00:04:30.690> so<00:04:32.030> that's

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
and we're not even in the 80s so that's

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:34.340 
and we're not even in the 80s so that's
pretty<00:04:33.210> good<00:04:33.389> for<00:04:33.450> a<00:04:33.630> chip<00:04:33.870> that's<00:04:33.990> pretty

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
pretty good for a chip that's pretty

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:37.820 
pretty good for a chip that's pretty
good<00:04:34.500> size<00:04:35.570> next<00:04:36.570> anyone<00:04:36.810> move<00:04:36.960> on<00:04:37.110> to<00:04:37.260> is<00:04:37.560> it's

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
good size next anyone move on to is it's

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.500 
good size next anyone move on to is it's
easy<00:04:38.070> mounting<00:04:38.550> probably<00:04:39.000> the<00:04:39.120> easiest

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
easy mounting probably the easiest

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.780 
easy mounting probably the easiest

here's<00:04:48.060> a<00:04:48.120> picture<00:04:48.330> of<00:04:48.450> it<00:04:48.720> you<00:04:49.050> see<00:04:49.200> the<00:04:49.230> two

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
here's a picture of it you see the two

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.520 
here's a picture of it you see the two
different<00:04:49.889> kinds<00:04:50.070> of<00:04:50.340> mounting<00:04:50.640> brackets<00:04:51.530> the

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
different kinds of mounting brackets the

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.159 
different kinds of mounting brackets the
one<00:04:52.919> with<00:04:53.070> the<00:04:53.130> Colin<00:04:53.970> socket<00:04:54.450> is<00:04:54.540> one<00:04:54.720> we<00:04:54.930> got

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:55.169 
one with the Colin socket is one we got

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:56.840 
one with the Colin socket is one we got
and<00:04:55.410> the<00:04:55.470> only<00:04:55.650> reason<00:04:55.800> we<00:04:56.130> got<00:04:56.280> that<00:04:56.520> one<00:04:56.700> is

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850 
and the only reason we got that one is

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:01.520 
and the only reason we got that one is
because<00:04:57.300> it<00:04:57.660> was<00:04:57.810> a<00:04:57.840> reviewer<00:04:58.260> sample<00:04:58.800> and<00:05:00.530> so

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530 
because it was a reviewer sample and so

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:03.500 
because it was a reviewer sample and so
I<00:05:01.560> emailed<00:05:01.800> them<00:05:02.160> and<00:05:02.460> they<00:05:02.640> quickly<00:05:02.910> emailed
