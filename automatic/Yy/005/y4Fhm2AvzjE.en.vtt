00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.680
 good night good morning or good for everyone and 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.599
 highlights the increase in unemployment 

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:11.190
 to be able to speak the why 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.190
 we achieve what we want 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:18.720
 and many times it's because we focus on what we should focus on 

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:22.890
 there is a theory 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.179
 who has his capitalist system in force 

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:29.599
 what we all pursue 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:32.330
 we are so focused 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:33.900
 in the have 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.370
 we 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.270
 i work a lot 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.610
 We believe that we must work very hard 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.100
 i the char 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.230
 for making money 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.620
 Bogota 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.090
 generate more money to be able to have more things 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:52.620
 and I'm still here 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.830
 in this one in that order we do 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:58.410
 Will have 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.650
 believing 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.410
 that he had more things he's going to do to us 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:03.870
 better people 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.390
 yes but it is in this neighborhood do 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.560
 in order to have 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.100
 for do 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.170
 as if it were a line 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.870
 that's why we do so much for this charros so much we work sometimes 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:19.729
 twelve hours a day 14 hours a day 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:20.710
 thinking 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.350
 that if we have a better house if we have the best car if our children have 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.420
 the best school if we can have more things we are going to be better people and their 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.700
 way of thinking of our capitalist system 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.030
 we are always pursuing an American dream 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.570
 now 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:41.859
 the day 

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:44.390
 that we propose 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.240
 what would be the right thing 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.950
 little bit different in what I was charged to do to finish believing that they can do 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.030
 best 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.630
 we propose something little different 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.630
 we believe that you must first be 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.660
 and after being 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.160
 peace to make 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.000
 and the pp is going to be a consequence 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.039
 what happens here 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.809
 if we fight t because doing more to have more we will always be 

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:14.369
 in this 

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:19.729
 in this wheel because I imagine it wants to be approved without hauling in where 

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:23.900
 is doing part is doing to have lists is like a French that 

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:27.169
 this instrument caves and they cheer him 

00:02:27.169 --> 00:02:28.169
 very strong 

00:02:28.169 --> 00:02:31.169
 of general reform in a room of the same place 

00:02:31.169 --> 00:02:35.699
 has ever felt like the cause of his magazine that for more than 

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:39.049
 he approaches and he likes you if you fight and work 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:41.079
 never again the exit from the same place 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:44.079
 that's because we're in this had to do to have 

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:46.209
 what's going on 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:47.410
 when you 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:48.370
 the place 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.859
 focus on doing to have 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:52.809
 the fogasa in being 

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:54.910
 in growth as a person 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.079
 it entered growth 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:00.079
 spiritually your emotional growth 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:02.759
 growth of all 

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:06.859
 the abilities of their abilities and jobs in being 

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:09.879
 if it is better to be human 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:13.179
 if you have more knowledge 

00:03:13.179 --> 00:03:17.949
 of what you should do if you have a greater financial knowledge that ceased that 

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:20.149
 they have not taught us to school 

00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:22.179
 so many others have taught us 

00:03:22.179 --> 00:03:25.179
 many mathematics highlight square roots 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:26.709
 but 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:30.329
 because in reality we are not given to teach to have a knowledge 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:31.999
 financial 

00:03:31.999 --> 00:03:36.219
 then why can not we have more money because we do not know how 

00:03:36.749 --> 00:03:39.089
 because we do not dedicate ourselves 

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:41.549
 grow as human beings 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:43.480
 then when you see 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:44.599
 in few 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:46.550
 that year per person 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.759
 they understood more knowledge in growing own 

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:52.739
 say as a human being 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:56.019
 you will know what you have to do 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:59.029
 and if you know what you have to do 

00:03:59.029 --> 00:04:02.239
 this day is going to be a consequence 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:07.479
 but the important thing is to grow as a human being grows in this one starts 

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:10.479
 the rest is the consequence of 

00:04:11.399 --> 00:04:14.379
 also for people who have more knowledge 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:19.090
 and adequate knowledge for what you want then 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.390
 the consequence will be able that you will have more money 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:23.990
 that's 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.400
 so they share this page 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.740
 this strategy peace another time
