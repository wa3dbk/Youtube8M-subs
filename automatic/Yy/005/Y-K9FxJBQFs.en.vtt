00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 hi everyone knows floxy and 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.210
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.799
 map presentation video 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.960
 so this is a map that I made me 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:14.070
 same as I did that I made good 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:16.890
 do not care what repeats the principle of 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.090
 the top gun series so de patrick game that 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.859
 you know so I think that if 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.340
 you watched the video is that 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.539
 you normally know brief 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.640
 so in fact I created a map in 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.429
 vanilla so really without any mode 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.070
 only in block command that makes 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.780
 exactly the same thing in fact of 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.090
 four teams of five who become 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.050
 five teams of four a chef's hat 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.129
 randomly after twenty minutes 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.770
 in each team and who owes who 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.920
 What needs to mess wholesale 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:47.370
 and so that's the border narrowing to 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.500
 itself 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.329
 at a certain point so the map and 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.899
 just invite for the border I got 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.620
 not served titles so bah actually 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.649
 here it is 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.480
 just that there is a private channel 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.140
 for early possible so a way to 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.720
 speak without the names top the ways 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:09.570
 so that's actually it's geggie does this 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.500
 map quickly just to resume the 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.900
 principle of the series 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:18.540
 so in fact I will explain 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.689
 maybe the operation in a 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.960
 next video 6.6 play fine this is so 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.960
 it's asked 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:31.950
 otherwise what to say more yeah basically he 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.909
 just have a tea tree hockey lo 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.729
 beautiful fail 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.110
 just copy with emc says 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.750
 I do not know what a thing like that 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.850
 to copy the system with the room that 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.869
 happens to be here even the 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.100
 room in fact it is useless 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.119
 just for the button that there is in the middle 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.979
 there we see it that's just why they 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:54.240
 activate any system in fact so we 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:56.040
 otherwise it's useless it must be enough 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.020
 just copy the system and you 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.420
 so can you play this map here at 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.979
 done it was totally at the fair 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.490
 go to 0-0 create a new map 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.079
 equals it's just for actually there 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.849
 there is a playable part on this 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.170
 other low map if you want in 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.020
 looking for the map but suddenly it will be 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.440
 the same so 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:16.090
 will not be top top so I absolutely 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.940
 nothing to touch the map so enough 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.760
 really only to copy the system except 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.430
 here to there to teleportation 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:28.350
 teams 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:30.850
 here it is I modified some points 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.460
 because sometimes it was right in 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.230
 full ocean others like that or so 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.840
 in a crevasse and he was taking guys 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.040
 you live suddenly I modified a whole 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.030
 little bit the coordinates in some 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.950
 corners I made them appear in the 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.890
 corners the teams but there are at least 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.390
 a playable part on this map 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.730
 after just just copy the 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.100
 system and paste it on an ad so 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.190
 that's all there is the east border 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:56.170
 so I basically explain what I have 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.760
 which is the normal principle there 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:01.240
 way to communicate with others 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.770
 normal molehill there is no way to 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.970
 reveal by cons as a top that 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:08.250
 it's just not possible to do it 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:10.060
 but can not for the moment we do not know 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.250
 to say it in the castle is a 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.630
 basic what by agreeing 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.650
 early that top names do not have the 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:19.120
 right to bluff or something like 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:21.280
 that's it when you arrive at huy after 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.720
 two minutes of two hours of play 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.880
 I had two minutes it'll be a little 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.330
 just the border will start to get 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:30.580
 so bring closer to 20 minutes 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.870
 wait from 2 hours every 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.030
 20 minutes 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.220
 the border will shrink 200 blocks 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.020
 so here is the blade not proud a thousand five 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.850
 hundred times thousand five hundred 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:42.730
 well, she will spend one thousand four hundred 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:46.570
 times one thousand four hundred times less 1400 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:48.310
 and so here's finally 1400 short so here is 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:50.280
 the map shrink back to block all 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.720
 20 minutes from 2 hours of play 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.890
 story of not being dominant his 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.520
 corner during search waters 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:58.750
 if he does not want to go 1 0 0 that's fine 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.510
 down here that's all I did nothing 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.890
 of special to say just present the map 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.600
 to really finish the system is over 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.120
 might have a player counter 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:10.000
 of team added according to the counter of 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.230
 life is there it's like a case tp I 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.390
 mean there is no regeneration 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.450
 natural the nether 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:18.810
 limited and so that's so it's 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:20.160
 really the same principle the link of 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.230
 map download will be in the 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.490
 description it's a file is rare it 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:24.840
 will just have to open with a rare and 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.780
 you will have the map inside that 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:30.570
 is called top gun it's original and then 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.250
 so here I leave you the care of 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:35.760
 discover the map I hope that you 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:38.930
 will please and beat good game and then thank you 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.930
 to have watched hi
