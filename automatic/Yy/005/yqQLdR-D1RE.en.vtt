much about the character but the figures
are<00:00:33.790> really<00:00:34.790> cool<00:00:35.030> because<00:00:35.800> they<00:00:36.800> are<00:00:36.829> super

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:38.020 
are really cool because they are super

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
it looks like at least parts of it are

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.520 
it looks like at least parts of it are
molded<00:00:44.149> I'm<00:00:44.300> sure<00:00:44.510> parts<00:00:44.809> of<00:00:44.929> it<00:00:44.989> are<00:00:45.109> painted

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
molded I'm sure parts of it are painted

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.669 
molded I'm sure parts of it are painted
but<00:00:46.129> it<00:00:46.429> is<00:00:46.670> all<00:00:47.030> matching<00:00:47.629> throughout<00:00:48.199> all

00:00:48.669 --> 00:00:48.679 
but it is all matching throughout all

00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:50.770 
but it is all matching throughout all
the<00:00:48.920> Blues<00:00:49.160> match<00:00:49.429> all<00:00:49.730> the<00:00:49.850> yellows<00:00:50.179> or<00:00:50.420> golds

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
the Blues match all the yellows or golds

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.770 
the Blues match all the yellows or golds
match<00:00:51.019> and<00:00:51.379> it's<00:00:51.829> just<00:00:52.039> so<00:00:52.460> shiny<00:00:52.879> and<00:00:53.269> nice<00:00:53.480> it

looks great if you're familiar with the

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.290 
looks great if you're familiar with the
Captain<00:00:57.710> Atom<00:00:57.890> figure<00:00:58.399> he's<00:00:58.609> silver<00:00:59.059> in<00:00:59.210> a

Captain Atom figure he's silver in a
similar<00:00:59.659> way<00:00:59.690> or<00:01:00.079> gold<00:01:00.859> is<00:01:01.280> actually<00:01:01.699> pretty

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:02.089 
similar way or gold is actually pretty

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:03.790 
similar way or gold is actually pretty
similar<00:01:02.359> to<00:01:02.600> this<00:01:02.719> color<00:01:02.960> gold<00:01:03.289> he's<00:01:03.499> a<00:01:03.530> little

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800 
similar to this color gold he's a little

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.500 
similar to this color gold he's a little
more<00:01:03.980> accurate<00:01:04.489> for<00:01:04.760> the<00:01:04.850> actual<00:01:05.089> color<00:01:05.420> of

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.510 
more accurate for the actual color of

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.200 
more accurate for the actual color of
gold<00:01:05.990> but<00:01:06.380> either<00:01:06.950> way<00:01:07.040> you<00:01:07.100> know<00:01:07.340> Mattel<00:01:07.760> did

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
gold but either way you know Mattel did

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.600 
gold but either way you know Mattel did
a<00:01:08.240> good<00:01:08.450> job<00:01:08.510> with<00:01:08.930> these<00:01:09.110> metallic<00:01:09.620> colors<00:01:09.950> so

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
a good job with these metallic colors so

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.510 
a good job with these metallic colors so
this<00:01:10.820> guy<00:01:11.000> is<00:01:11.060> no<00:01:11.360> different<00:01:11.870> he<00:01:12.080> stands<00:01:12.740> about

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
this guy is no different he stands about

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.130 
this guy is no different he stands about
six<00:01:13.820> and<00:01:13.970> three-quarter<00:01:14.390> inches<00:01:14.630> tall<00:01:14.900> and

six and three-quarter inches tall and
the<00:01:15.530> figures<00:01:15.860> are<00:01:16.240> 95%<00:01:17.240> the<00:01:17.300> same<00:01:17.630> I<00:01:17.900> believe

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590

the figures are 95% the same I believe
this<00:01:18.770> one<00:01:19.010> is<00:01:19.040> the<00:01:19.550> harder<00:01:20.000> to<00:01:20.030> find<00:01:20.360> variant

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
for a DC you see figure even side to

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:41.830 
for a DC you see figure even side to
side<00:02:40.550> a<00:02:40.580> little<00:02:40.880> bit<00:02:41.000> I<00:02:41.150> don't<00:02:41.420> know<00:02:41.510> why<00:02:41.660> they

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
side a little bit I don't know why they

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.840

don't<00:02:41.990> all<00:02:42.140> have<00:02:42.170> this<00:02:42.650> it's<00:02:43.130> so<00:02:43.459> easy<00:02:43.490> and

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
don't all have this it's so easy and

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.230 
don't all have this it's so easy and
they're<00:02:44.060> all<00:02:44.209> 95%<00:02:45.200> the<00:02:45.260> same<00:02:45.470> sculpt<00:02:45.800> so

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.240 
they're all 95% the same sculpt so

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.370 
they're all 95% the same sculpt so
whatever<00:02:47.240> it's<00:02:47.480> beyond<00:02:47.780> me<00:02:47.930> it<00:02:48.110> could<00:02:48.260> have

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
whatever it's beyond me it could have

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.750 
whatever it's beyond me it could have
been<00:02:48.500> so<00:02:48.680> much<00:02:48.709> better<00:02:49.010> for<00:02:49.190> so<00:02:49.370> many<00:02:49.580> figures

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
been so much better for so many figures

is a paint job it's a darn good one but

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.770 
is a paint job it's a darn good one but

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
I'm thinking it's molded it's hard to

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:27.250 
I'm thinking it's molded it's hard to
say

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
say

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.990 
say
I<00:03:27.290> know<00:03:27.440> molding<00:03:27.890> metallics<00:03:28.400> is<00:03:28.489> difficult

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
I know molding metallics is difficult

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.600 
I know molding metallics is difficult
but<00:03:29.239> it<00:03:29.870> looks<00:03:30.140> like<00:03:30.380> they<00:03:30.590> molded<00:03:31.070> the<00:03:31.250> yellow

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
but it looks like they molded the yellow

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.090 
but it looks like they molded the yellow
and<00:03:31.850> then<00:03:32.840> in<00:03:32.989> the<00:03:33.080> blue<00:03:33.260> in<00:03:33.410> some<00:03:33.590> spots<00:03:33.860> but

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
and then in the blue in some spots but

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.509 
and then in the blue in some spots but
I'm<00:03:34.280> not<00:03:34.400> just<00:03:34.700> certain<00:03:36.010> pant<00:03:37.010> the<00:03:37.280> boots

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519 
I'm not just certain pant the boots

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:39.610 
I'm not just certain pant the boots
unfortunately<00:03:38.209> are<00:03:38.450> not<00:03:38.480> sculpted<00:03:39.140> but<00:03:39.470> they

unfortunately are not sculpted but they
are<00:03:39.739> painted<00:03:40.100> well<00:03:40.370> enough<00:03:40.760> so<00:03:41.030> it's<00:03:41.150> okay<00:03:41.510> and

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.110 
are painted well enough so it's okay and

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:43.870 
are painted well enough so it's okay and
he<00:03:42.230> does<00:03:42.380> have<00:03:42.560> the<00:03:42.769> ankle<00:03:43.130> articulation<00:03:43.310> that

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
he does have the ankle articulation that

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.910 
he does have the ankle articulation that
is<00:03:44.000> standard<00:03:44.480> he<00:03:44.900> has<00:03:45.049> a<00:03:45.080> decent<00:03:45.290> range<00:03:45.769> of

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
is standard he has a decent range of

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.410 
is standard he has a decent range of
motion<00:03:46.250> some<00:03:46.400> of<00:03:46.489> them<00:03:46.580> don't<00:03:46.730> have<00:03:47.000> that<00:03:47.239> so

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
motion some of them don't have that so

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.780 
motion some of them don't have that so
that's<00:03:47.630> pretty<00:03:47.840> nice<00:03:48.310> there's<00:03:49.310> like<00:03:49.489> a<00:03:49.519> bit<00:03:49.760> of

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
that's pretty nice there's like a bit of

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.600 
that's pretty nice there's like a bit of
an<00:03:49.970> ankle<00:03:50.269> rocker<00:03:50.510> on<00:03:50.780> this<00:03:50.959> guy<00:03:51.140> it's<00:03:51.610> super

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 
an ankle rocker on this guy it's super

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:54.819 
an ankle rocker on this guy it's super
minimal<00:03:52.850> and<00:03:53.450> it<00:03:53.840> doesn't<00:03:54.140> really<00:03:54.260> accomplish

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:54.829 
minimal and it doesn't really accomplish

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:58.110 
minimal and it doesn't really accomplish
anything<00:03:54.970> but<00:03:55.970> it<00:03:56.269> feels<00:03:56.630> like<00:03:56.810> they<00:03:57.380> actually

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
anything but it feels like they actually

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.400 
anything but it feels like they actually
gave<00:03:59.120> him<00:03:59.329> the<00:03:59.450> ankle<00:03:59.750> rocker<00:03:59.959> instead<00:04:00.320> of

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
gave him the ankle rocker instead of

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.740 
gave him the ankle rocker instead of
having<00:04:00.590> the<00:04:00.920> hinge<00:04:01.250> molded<00:04:02.239> into<00:04:02.360> the<00:04:02.540> foot

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
having the hinge molded into the foot

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.810 
having the hinge molded into the foot
it's<00:04:02.959> actually<00:04:03.260> a<00:04:03.290> separate<00:04:03.620> piece<00:04:03.890> so<00:04:04.579> that's

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:04.820 
it's actually a separate piece so that's

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:06.130 
it's actually a separate piece so that's
nice<00:04:05.030> you<00:04:05.209> could<00:04:05.329> probably<00:04:05.720> free<00:04:05.930> that<00:04:06.110> up

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:06.140 
nice you could probably free that up

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.050 
nice you could probably free that up
with<00:04:06.380> an<00:04:06.470> exacto<00:04:06.950> knife<00:04:07.130> if<00:04:07.310> you<00:04:07.340> wanted<00:04:07.880> to

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
with an exacto knife if you wanted to

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.630 
with an exacto knife if you wanted to
but<00:04:08.660> do<00:04:08.870> that<00:04:08.900> at<00:04:09.260> your<00:04:09.470> own<00:04:09.739> risk<00:04:10.070> so<00:04:10.400> there<00:04:10.549> it

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 
but do that at your own risk so there it

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.240 
but do that at your own risk so there it
is<00:04:10.730> there's<00:04:11.000> Booster<00:04:11.480> Gold<00:04:11.510> and<00:04:12.019> his<00:04:12.709> variant
