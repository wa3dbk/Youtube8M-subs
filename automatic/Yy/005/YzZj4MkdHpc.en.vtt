now we are going to
the<00:00:08.700> beautiful<00:00:09.700> crystal

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:11.360 
the beautiful crystal

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.760 
crystals gear wire pendant and oops
chain<00:00:23.210> and<00:00:24.759> lock<00:00:25.790> first<00:00:26.270> we<00:00:26.480> have<00:00:26.599> to<00:00:26.869> insert

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:27.770 
chain and lock first we have to insert

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.259 
chain and lock first we have to insert
the<00:00:28.119> pendant<00:00:29.119> with<00:00:29.300> that<00:00:29.449> gear<00:00:29.720> gear<00:00:30.199> wire

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:31.269 
the pendant with that gear gear wire

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:36.670 
the pendant with that gear gear wire
then<00:00:33.910> we<00:00:34.910> have<00:00:35.030> to<00:00:35.269> insert<00:00:35.690> the<00:00:35.870> crystals<00:00:36.379> one

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
then we have to insert the crystals one

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:47.470 
then we have to insert the crystals one
by<00:00:36.860> one<00:00:38.949> in<00:00:39.949> a<00:00:40.010> single<00:00:40.400> step

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.380 

this<00:00:48.480> one<00:00:48.660> is<00:00:48.810> a<00:00:49.490> single<00:00:50.490> step

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
this one is a single step

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:58.790 
this one is a single step
crystal<00:00:52.400> chain<00:00:56.239> this<00:00:57.239> we<00:00:57.420> can<00:00:57.630> therefore

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
crystal chain this we can therefore

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.479 
crystal chain this we can therefore
Savi's<00:01:00.020> playing<00:01:01.020> Savi's<00:01:01.590> or<00:01:01.800> designer<00:01:02.130> sarees

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
Savi's playing Savi's or designer sarees

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.800 
Savi's playing Savi's or designer sarees
all<00:01:03.080> for<00:01:04.080> Chili's<00:01:04.500> for<00:01:05.479> everything<00:01:06.479> we<00:01:06.630> can

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
all for Chili's for everything we can

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:14.880 
all for Chili's for everything we can
balance

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:20.100 

and<00:01:15.430> one<00:01:15.730> single<00:01:16.030> line<00:01:18.000> 25<00:01:19.000> installs<00:01:19.510> must<00:01:19.990> be

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
and one single line 25 installs must be

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.370 
and one single line 25 installs must be
there

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:31.219 

like<00:01:25.380> that<00:01:25.649> in<00:01:25.859> a<00:01:26.070> second

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.800 

now<00:01:31.830> we<00:01:31.890> are<00:01:32.220> going<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.610> finish<00:01:33.120> up<00:01:33.330> the<00:01:33.540> star

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
now we are going to finish up the star

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:40.760 
now we are going to finish up the star
set<00:01:34.080> with<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.190> gridlock

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:48.350 

then<00:01:41.430> we<00:01:41.670> have<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:42.030> take<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.619> chain<00:01:43.619> and<00:01:47.360> you

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
then we have to take the chain and you

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.200 
then we have to take the chain and you
have<00:01:48.450> to<00:01:48.630> fold<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:49.020> key<00:01:49.200> why<00:01:49.979> off<00:01:50.190> into<00:01:51.119> the

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
have to fold the key why off into the

00:01:51.210 --> 00:02:01.219 
have to fold the key why off into the
view<00:01:51.450> lock<00:01:59.149> then<00:02:00.149> we<00:02:00.360> have<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:00.690> take<00:02:00.869> off<00:02:01.050> from

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
view lock then we have to take off from

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:08.120 
view lock then we have to take off from
the<00:02:01.440> dialog<00:02:04.340> in<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.610> other<00:02:05.820> side<00:02:06.210> and<00:02:06.920> then<00:02:07.920> we

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
the dialog in the other side and then we

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.029 
the dialog in the other side and then we
held<00:02:08.429> an<00:02:08.580> other<00:02:08.729> side<00:02:09.060> of<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.810> crystal<00:02:10.410> set<00:02:10.800> is

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
held an other side of the crystal set is

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.979 
held an other side of the crystal set is
also<00:02:11.250> ready<00:02:13.130> we<00:02:14.130> have<00:02:14.160> to<00:02:14.280> cut<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:14.940> excess<00:02:15.420> gel

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
also ready we have to cut the excess gel

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:25.940 
also ready we have to cut the excess gel
wire<00:02:18.950> for<00:02:19.950> a<00:02:19.980> presentation<00:02:24.260> now<00:02:25.260> our<00:02:25.530> crystal

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
wire for a presentation now our crystal

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.860 
wire for a presentation now our crystal
set<00:02:26.160> is<00:02:26.310> ready<00:02:26.610> it's<00:02:27.600> matching<00:02:27.959> curing<00:02:29.870> it's
