00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:08.429
 uh I do not know if I've ever said it but 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.740
 I'm a big fan of ghost and batman 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.070
 that today I'm going to teach you how to do this 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.070
 couple 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:25.089
 these and some more materials that 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:28.679
 you need you can find them in my 

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:28.679
 blog or in the description box 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.230
 following the pattern that you left me 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.600
 blog or any other similar that you can 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.250
 find in networks for free 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.550
 placing it to says the plate according to 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.070
 proceed in my case I am using the 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.960
 midi measure of the hama beach brand but 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.960
 you can use the one you like best 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:56.700
 once finished the design places the 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.090
 paper and iron it gently during 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.090
 a few seconds 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.430
 while the piece cools, take your 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:08.340
 fork and the tape that we're going to make a 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.210
 mini loop passes the ribbon by the fork 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.210
 in this way 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:29.649
 beam of a knot 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.080
 same 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.159
 take the piece out of the mold now that it's not 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.610
 burns and with a little glue sticks 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:47.610
 the loop 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:52.960
 Make him a couple in the color you like 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.390
 with the same pattern and use the 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.880
 whatever you want 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.710
 In my case, I'll stick some pins in 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.700
 the back to show off the 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.700
 T-shirts and bags 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.320
 Well nothing like you saw 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:08.090
 I have put a brooch for them 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.860
 take them in the lapel but remember that 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.300
 you can use them as you want as 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.310
 for example to put them on a keychain 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.750
 or to make a magnet for the fridge if 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.000
