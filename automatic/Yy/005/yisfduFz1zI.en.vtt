00:00:03.509 --> 00:00:07.749
 he was really hard now 

00:00:05.919 --> 00:00:10.810
 he has no video for a long time 

00:00:07.749 --> 00:00:13.270
 you confessed to them that way and that 

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:17.320
 because I'm really pretty red 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:19.360
 wonderful cable and get and there 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.800
 is there such an amazing product 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.330
 we tried it for you that is 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:29.310
 stop now number one what we now 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:33.449
 from the beginning of colo before the forecast is 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:37.920
 exactly the post from 13 euro 

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:41.710
 dug it a try, I show 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:44.440
 so it looks like we'll try it out 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:47.050
 but because the color of the 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:50.649
 we have colored the colors we draw 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:52.569
 province just look and yes important 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:55.120
 is the product work product b 

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:58.239
 mixed products to play 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.920
 Be sure to pay attention beforehand 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:02.649
 put on old things and so on and so on 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.339
 so on and I think we'll report and 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:05.339
 Although massively exceeded 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:15.420
 so now we let that act 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:19.899
 and so it stands out if that's extreme 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:23.439
 compensated protect up when the extremely 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:27.369
 act on at least 60 minutes 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:29.890
 let and if he's just out or his 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:32.259
 Should be so easy 30 minutes bands 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.179
 let's guess 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:35.140
 or that we just keep it simple 

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:37.359
 result 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.189
 Finally, it was dark blond on it 

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:40.719
 So make it to red first 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:43.509
 get away with that we have such a comfort 

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:44.079
 turns red and we'll just see it 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:48.340
 as it becomes 

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:51.270
 and we will end up being and if 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:54.700
 it so what happens to be correct 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.200
 Hair must be washed before that 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.969
 at least one day before without 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.270
 any additives trainer so 

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:02.679
 speak children speak 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.990
 i hope winners and so on and so on 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:07.509
 And so the hair was attacked 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.950
 can be from the product yes we have 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:11.050
 now a fresh foil on it 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:15.040
 so that he drips white extremely 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:17.350
 It is fluently and yes, it is important to keep the newspaper 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:25.990
 interpret as once to one here 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:28.090
 Everything is so dirty later so we 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.430
 make a short interim balance so 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:33.070
 we have it now for 20 minutes and 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.500
 it is the hammer I show it briefly 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:40.960
 the red it has not seen anymore 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:43.810
 and I just go the other side 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:46.060
 here still isolated the red spots 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.840
 otherwise it's just completely out 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.840
 that's insane 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.650
 we come one piece at our result 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:57.870
 closer we show and then we'll see each other 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:03:04.450
 right back and have us now 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:07.209
 Completed you see where we are 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:10.840
 money burns or orange but that is so 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:11.860
 become gentler than backward 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:16.540
 get across 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:18.880
 show us from the other side 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.850
 definitely only have the color 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.500
 pulled out and it is essential already 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.400
 there and now we can really with the 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:30.850
 start color 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:32.830
 so we can recommend it now 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:34.930
 the next video is like that 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:37.410
 then planned such a beautiful dom with 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.410
 strive
