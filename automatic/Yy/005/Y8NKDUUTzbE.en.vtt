00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.880
 to 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:14.679
 and good shot in this montero that does not 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:17.779
 he rushed and he endured enough 

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:22.000
 to choose the most corpulent of the two 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:22.000
 boars that crossed before the post 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.560
 but not 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.870
 It does not seem in a hurry with the 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.550
 legs that move through the spot and if 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:44.410
 they do not hear the whistling of the 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.410
 bullets take it easy 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.949
 i 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:00.280
 that yes when they cross the roads or leave 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.770
 to a clear squeeze the race 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:06.239
 aware that at that moment they are 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.239
 much more vulnerable 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.259
 m 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.479
 this time it has been a fox that has 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.250
 taken the worst part although this 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.679
 species is not included among the 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.320
 planned today is always the 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:42.530
 can hunt unless indicated 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.079
 otherwise by the organizer 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:48.090
 in some regions like Andalusia 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:50.720
 even your trophy is susceptible to 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.720
 homologation 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.160
 LOL 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.200
 that slowness of movements to which 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.450
 we alluded to previously has caused 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:11.970
 a dislike to this boar that thought 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.970
 that oaks were a safe haven
