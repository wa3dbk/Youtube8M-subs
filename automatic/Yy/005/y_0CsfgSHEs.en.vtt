out or use water the complete - off is

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.810 
out or use water the complete - off is
best<00:01:06.810> because<00:01:07.619> we're<00:01:07.950> gonna<00:01:08.070> do<00:01:08.220> that<00:01:08.460> wasn't

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
best because we're gonna do that wasn't

foam<00:01:12.090> that<00:01:12.420> had<00:01:12.600> aids<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.200> stuff<00:01:13.439> or<00:01:13.890> you<00:01:14.130> can

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
foam that had aids and stuff or you can

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.960

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
out but I you know I'm used to it so I

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.219 
out but I you know I'm used to it so I
don't<00:01:26.159> need<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:26.340> measure

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:32.170 

put<00:01:30.229> to<00:01:30.560> measure<00:01:30.799> it<00:01:31.010> out<00:01:31.100> I<00:01:31.340> just<00:01:31.580> eyeball<00:01:32.150> it

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180

it if you had a deep fryer no flipping
is<00:03:52.770> necessary<00:03:53.280> because<00:03:53.400> the<00:03:53.610> whole<00:03:54.000> thing<00:03:54.240> was

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:54.270 
is necessary because the whole thing was

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.680 
is necessary because the whole thing was
going<00:03:54.450> but<00:03:55.380> you're<00:03:55.560> using<00:03:55.710> a<00:03:56.180> pot<00:03:57.180> like<00:03:57.450> me

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
you'll have to flip them because you

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.600 
you'll have to flip them because you
could<00:04:00.690> tell<00:04:00.900> that<00:04:01.140> the<00:04:01.320> top<00:04:01.560> is<00:04:01.590> lighter<00:04:02.040> than
