00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.290
 Rapid Vienna is driving a well-deserved apatit this Friday night 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.430
 against Kapfenberg the gates to 4 or 5 to 3 through Bangkok 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.980
 Post update already Steffen Hofmann second in added time 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:18.320
 also a good spirit 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.320
 but so difficult months on us also a lot to worry about 

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:24.779
 but I played before the sensational »was arrested 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.939
 Fast-paced game with many areas wide open Oldenburg has been found 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:30.920
 over should be presented like that 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.510
 we have to present today has yet to be 5 played 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.180
 all beech APA 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.240
 no complaints often 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.240
 want to complete the last four games out 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.339
 we never gave up 

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:50.389
 only at noon because the armies gave the evaluation is done more 

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:51.940
 made and lost again 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.820
 to pull the past with the PID St also stars 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:56.610
 had 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.850
 to distribute a foreign city 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.450
 do not want to change 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:05.880
 yet this first appearance of Kapfenberg landed in the first half plays 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.980
 Winning very well in hand would be glad in Norman wore on these these 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.160
 whether the exercised but on the serve in leadership could be all the more annoying 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.340
 Capital is still growing at 4 0 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.000
 sustainable opportunity 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.500
 when he gave to court 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.500
 Friends sure we win it 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.440
 more hoping you have to take Israel a bit further 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.470
 of Musée Malraux want to get through experiences as the im in the sixteenth 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.920
 Wimmer get room coverage from the room 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.860
 our our striker 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.150
 Bremen ddp bring the counter lane performing Dom Bio and me on the Riemer three 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:45.230
 Meter plus 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:46.829
 so the opposing striker 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.209
 and wander more and more self-criticism in the name Baumann players 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:55.700
 it comes along and the earth and interviews and from the givers at the feels that 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.250
 him the furrow 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.860
 whether go 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.560
 Federer shows that he continues 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.890
 Dan Ellis also important that we think this player which also shape up 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.580
 i much more important 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.200
 that is "who can say also the choice of the fighting spirit and partly also of 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.539
 young players 

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:16.539
 the footballing potential now 

00:02:17.529 --> 00:02:22.509
 Rosberg I'll be very proud again in 2006 when you play standards and trumpet 

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:26.229
 how it wants to get their games 4 3 games the 3 2 affects 

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:31.199
 me -button at that time only the soundtrack went home unhappy and 

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:34.199
 Son of a nice experience with me but great 

00:02:35.169 --> 00:02:36.929
 and and 

00:02:36.929 --> 00:02:40.349
 do not consider that classmate Dreier sees Klose's name 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:43.260
 to the short leader chest or how she pleasing
