 this paved the scammers oils 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:31.099
 instruments for recording and ai pi 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:33.210
 DVR 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.790
 in particular they are used precisely 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.290
 offensive for a long time 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.230
 selling a device was developed in 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:40.960
 fraternity with croc 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.280
 technology 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.900
 and first of all for driving schools 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.340
 however has the widest range 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.680
 applications and on other vehicles 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.710
 is now being tested 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.840
 on in road traffic 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.660
 shut us and others 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.470

 lancer your 5m 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.210
 perform specifically in this construct for 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:03.990
 use in driving schools 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:05.530
 transport 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:06.840
 that is, we see 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.800
 4 video channels 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.660
 2 analogues are easy in the form of output one of 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.030
 which show alarming picture 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.470
 and you say exit 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.790
 networked 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.660
 audio input and output 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.100
 connectors here are 32 for connecting percentage 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.100
 control panel or now receivers 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:29.729
 alarm inputs outputs 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.680
 or telemetry control 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.950
 there is a special power supply camera 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.020
 Made dead power connector 12 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.750
 volt pass-through vodka power source 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.530
 lesbian connector can be used for 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.940
 connect 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.140
 n mouse or external storage 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.810
 to copy data 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.000
 but mice respectively 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.010
 of management 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:50.680
 used for recording in Shostka 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.110
 CD in 28 regions 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.810
 removable design 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.870
 what allows you to copy data 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.140
 listening drive 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.650
 as mentioned earlier lancer can be 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:04.830
 used 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.100
 as a link monitor and with any channels 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.449
 kavun 

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:10.839
 here you will see as well as a remote control on 

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:13.139
 which was spoken earlier mainly by us 

00:02:13.139 --> 00:02:15.029
 ask for driving schools as it allows 

00:02:15.029 --> 00:02:18.109
 display video he 

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:21.069
 Well, the imposition of video information about 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:23.829
 passing the exam 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:25.119
 DVR menu 

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:27.299
 associate 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:29.009
 and every channel 

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:31.839
 can be recorded either 25 frames per second 

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:35.259
 with a resolution of 352x288 

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:39.029
 And either she field 704 on 288 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:41.559
 12 frames per second 

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:44.029
 either full frames 6 frames per second 

00:02:44.029 --> 00:02:46.079
 this year the bitrix can reach two 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:47.729
 megabit per channel 

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:49.909
 of the features can also be noted a 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:51.949
 Needless to say 

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:53.659
 receiver now means 

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:55.559
 that is, we remove using the portal 

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:58.400
 here 302 and here we see the percentage of the chupe of 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.769
 receiver
