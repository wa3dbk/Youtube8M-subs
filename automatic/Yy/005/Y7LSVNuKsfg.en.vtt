00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:06.289 

it<00:00:04.680> was<00:00:04.830> our<00:00:04.980> first<00:00:05.310> time<00:00:05.430> he<00:00:05.670> in<00:00:05.819> the<00:00:05.910> finals

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
it was our first time he in the finals

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.500 
it was our first time he in the finals
of<00:00:06.359> 21<00:00:06.750> years<00:00:07.400> so<00:00:08.400> I<00:00:08.429> would<00:00:09.059> think<00:00:09.210> would<00:00:09.360> be<00:00:09.480> a

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
of 21 years so I would think would be a

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.749 
of 21 years so I would think would be a
little<00:00:09.690> different<00:00:09.870> you<00:00:10.800> know<00:00:10.950> the<00:00:11.099> history<00:00:11.219> of

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
little different you know the history of

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.370 
little different you know the history of
course<00:00:12.599> we<00:00:12.690> played<00:00:12.870> against<00:00:13.110> each<00:00:13.170> other

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
course we played against each other

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.700 
course we played against each other
before<00:00:14.030> anybody<00:00:15.030> that's<00:00:15.269> facing<00:00:15.900> me<00:00:16.170> in<00:00:16.590> his

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
before anybody that's facing me in his

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.770 
before anybody that's facing me in his
final<00:00:16.890> time

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:18.780 
final time

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:24.230 
final time
go<00:00:19.290> out<00:00:20.120> before<00:00:21.120> again<00:00:21.740> tom<00:00:22.740> it's<00:00:23.460> NBA<00:00:23.790> Finals

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
go out before again tom it's NBA Finals

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.570 
go out before again tom it's NBA Finals
you<00:00:24.780> know<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:24.990> saying<00:00:25.170> but<00:00:25.470> you<00:00:26.250> know<00:00:26.400> those

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
you know the saying but you know those

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.600 
you know the saying but you know those
guys<00:00:26.790> made<00:00:27.150> four<00:00:27.450> times<00:00:27.750> and<00:00:28.710> a<00:00:28.890> final<00:00:29.130> so<00:00:29.430> I

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:29.610 
guys made four times and a final so I

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.150 
guys made four times and a final so I
guess<00:00:29.790> it<00:00:29.940> would<00:00:30.030> be<00:00:30.060> obvious<00:00:30.270> that<00:00:30.570> they<00:00:31.160> felt

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
guess it would be obvious that they felt

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.450 
guess it would be obvious that they felt
a<00:00:32.310> certain<00:00:32.490> way<00:00:32.640> about<00:00:33.680> each<00:00:34.680> other<00:00:35.010> what<00:00:35.400> do

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
a certain way about each other what do

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.950 
a certain way about each other what do
you<00:00:35.520> expect<00:00:35.790> from<00:00:35.910> Garnett<00:00:36.330> in<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.480> series<00:00:36.540> he

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
you expect from Garnett in the series he

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.810 
you expect from Garnett in the series he
scored<00:00:37.260> a<00:00:37.320> lot<00:00:37.500> two<00:00:37.980> rounds<00:00:38.340> ago<00:00:38.520> we<00:00:38.640> didn't
