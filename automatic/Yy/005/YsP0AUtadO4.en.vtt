i made a special block that allowed to

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:53.640 
i made a special block that allowed to
do<00:02:51.700> that<00:02:51.880> it<00:02:52.150> costs<00:02:52.480> eight<00:02:52.690> diamond<00:02:53.140> blocks<00:02:53.410> to

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
do that it costs eight diamond blocks to

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.539 
do that it costs eight diamond blocks to
make<00:02:53.769> it<00:02:53.950> Wow<00:02:54.099> so<00:02:54.760> I'm<00:02:55.030> pretty<00:02:55.420> expensive<00:02:55.780> huh
