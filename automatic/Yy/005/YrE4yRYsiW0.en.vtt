if the enemy team get the gun out of an

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.240 
if the enemy team get the gun out of an
ammo<00:00:21.840> crate<00:00:22.109> you<00:00:22.140> kill<00:00:22.560> them<00:00:22.740> and<00:00:22.920> then<00:00:23.100> you

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
ammo crate you kill them and then you

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.160 
ammo crate you kill them and then you
pick<00:00:23.430> it<00:00:23.519> up<00:00:23.640> off<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.880> ground<00:00:24.000> but<00:00:24.810> if<00:00:25.080> you

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
pick it up off the ground but if you

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.839 
pick it up off the ground but if you
don't<00:00:25.350> pick<00:00:25.470> it<00:00:25.619> up<00:00:25.710> within<00:00:25.890> like<00:00:26.160> 30<00:00:26.340> seconds

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
don't pick it up within like 30 seconds

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.960 
don't pick it up within like 30 seconds
or<00:00:26.939> so<00:00:27.150> d<00:00:27.510> spawn<00:00:27.869> and<00:00:28.230> then<00:00:29.039> you'll<00:00:29.670> be<00:00:29.699> able<00:00:29.820> to

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
or so d spawn and then you'll be able to

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.250 
or so d spawn and then you'll be able to
get<00:00:30.119> into<00:00:30.240> getting<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.599> ammo<00:00:30.750> crate<00:00:31.050> but<00:00:31.170> the

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
get into getting the ammo crate but the

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.020 
get into getting the ammo crate but the
chance<00:00:31.500> of<00:00:31.650> getting<00:00:31.949> it<00:00:32.040> i'ma<00:00:32.460> crater<00:00:32.700> really

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
chance of getting it i'ma crater really

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.580 
chance of getting it i'ma crater really
quite<00:00:33.239> low<00:00:33.630> I<00:00:33.930> don't<00:00:34.110> know<00:00:34.200> what<00:00:34.440> the

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
quite low I don't know what the

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:35.990 
quite low I don't know what the
percentage<00:00:34.980> is<00:00:35.130> but<00:00:35.370> you<00:00:35.430> can<00:00:35.550> get<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.670> bunch<00:00:35.880> of

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
percentage is but you can get a bunch of

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.459 
percentage is but you can get a bunch of
random<00:00:36.329> crap<00:00:36.450> in<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.870> emigrate<00:00:37.320> and

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
random crap in the emigrate and

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.350 
random crap in the emigrate and
something<00:00:38.309> that<00:00:38.340> you<00:00:38.489> guys<00:00:38.640> may<00:00:38.850> not<00:00:39.000> know<00:00:39.180> is

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
something that you guys may not know is

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.030 
something that you guys may not know is
you<00:00:39.510> can<00:00:39.629> actually<00:00:39.660> get<00:00:40.170> guns<00:00:40.500> with<00:00:40.770> for

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
you can actually get guns with for

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
gun and the biggest challenge with

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.420 
gun and the biggest challenge with
getting<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.479> minigun<00:01:18.869> chem<00:01:19.229> is<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:20.100> fact<00:01:20.340> that

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
getting a minigun chem is the fact that

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.859 
getting a minigun chem is the fact that
it's<00:01:20.610> only<00:01:20.790> got<00:01:20.909> a<00:01:20.939> limited<00:01:21.090> amount<00:01:21.420> of<00:01:21.600> ammo

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
it's only got a limited amount of ammo

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.370 
it's only got a limited amount of ammo
its<00:01:22.020> comes<00:01:22.229> with<00:01:22.409> 255<00:01:23.220> bullets<00:01:23.810> but<00:01:24.810> any<00:01:25.080> can't

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
its comes with 255 bullets but any can't

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.320 
its comes with 255 bullets but any can't
resupply<00:01:25.740> or<00:01:26.009> get<00:01:26.400> any<00:01:26.549> more<00:01:26.850> so<00:01:27.060> you<00:01:27.119> need<00:01:27.270> to

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
resupply or get any more so you need to

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.030 
resupply or get any more so you need to
pick<00:01:27.509> your<00:01:27.689> shots<00:01:27.869> fairly<00:01:28.320> well<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.770> make

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
pick your shots fairly well and make

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.100 
pick your shots fairly well and make

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
sure you don't waste too many bullets so

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.649 
sure you don't waste too many bullets so
you<00:01:31.170> have<00:01:31.439> enough<00:01:31.920> ammo<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.280> get<00:01:32.490> in<00:01:32.549> like<00:01:33.450> all

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
you have enough ammo to get in like all

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.420 
you have enough ammo to get in like all
of<00:01:33.810> your<00:01:33.930> kills<00:01:34.140> with<00:01:34.290> it<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.860> I<00:01:34.920> do<00:01:34.979> believe<00:01:35.280> I

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
of your kills with it and I do believe I

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.340 
of your kills with it and I do believe I

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.399 
game I'm I'm not a hundred percent sure
but<00:01:39.990> I<00:01:40.020> believe<00:01:40.140> I<00:01:40.500> definitely<00:01:40.799> got<00:01:42.110> 23<00:01:43.110> of<00:01:43.259> the

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
but I believe I definitely got 23 of the

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.170 
but I believe I definitely got 23 of the
kill<00:01:43.619> and<00:01:43.890> i'm<00:01:44.009> pretty<00:01:44.250> sure<00:01:44.399> about<00:01:44.549> 24<00:01:44.939> and

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
kill and i'm pretty sure about 24 and

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.359 
kill and i'm pretty sure about 24 and
this<00:01:45.960> is<00:01:46.049> actually<00:01:46.320> my<00:01:46.409> second<00:01:46.799> minigun<00:01:47.100> chem

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
paced because I did the the biggest

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.700 
paced because I did the the biggest
challenge<00:02:17.600> like<00:02:17.780> I<00:02:17.930> said<00:02:18.170> with<00:02:18.320> this<00:02:18.470> gun<00:02:18.680> is

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:18.710 
challenge like I said with this gun is

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.130 
challenge like I said with this gun is
trying<00:02:19.310> to<00:02:19.400> conserve<00:02:19.760> ammo<00:02:20.210> make<00:02:20.810> sure<00:02:20.840> you

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
trying to conserve ammo make sure you

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.170
