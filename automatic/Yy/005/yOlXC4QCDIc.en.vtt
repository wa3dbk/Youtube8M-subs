00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.720

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:19.760
 just one more year maria blog 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:22.670
 today the people I wanted to do an incredible 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.860
 They said that the river is from the Middle East 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:27.619
 What a fucking deal my friends this 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.570
 Cookie and chickpeas with a serving 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.970
 some nice little things and it 's wonderful 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.710
 is an alternative and vegetarians 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.900
 They love this but it's a food that 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.030
 anyone can eat because it's perfect 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.670
 and is delicious good to lose now that is 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:43.850
 easy let's have good eyes of these visits 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.830
 Processor but can also be a 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.140
 geek edificador if you have not got 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:50.120
 problem a mixer anything 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.920
 remembering that all ingredients with 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.570
 the description of the video that the quantities 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.370
 from then on let's go 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.979
 first after the recipe is usual grain of 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.229
 beak if you want you have two options 

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:02.629
 you can buy the raw chickpeas and 

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:05.750
 leave it in the water for ten hours until 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:08.120
 go cushioned or you can buy 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.820
 ready since they live in those 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:13.909
 little boxes that you could see near a 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:16.460
 canon is a praxe has lentil beans 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:18.409
 chickpeas and then it's ready, so I 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.660
 I think it's a lot easier, he has a little 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:22.640
 but we have a wash 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.980
 him to see if he takes a little bit and he 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.330
 It's okay to use, I bought 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.490
 ready because you know how it is 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.040
 It's easier than I 'm going to do now. 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.390
 I took the colloquium bic that out 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.700
 thank you 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.520
 I'm chickpeas and put them in the 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:40.010
 processor or new covenant until it becomes a 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.120
 The whole 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:45.650
 very plump so let's go 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.630
 Now you'll see that it leaves a lot 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.910
 because now that we already have 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.980
 michael bay's goal also changed him 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.780
 turns into a good dough if my 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:56.900
 I had to stuff if you ever 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:59.060
 ate the beak is this is a moment that the 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.590
 People already spoke without cleaning the processor. 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.750
 or blender to process any 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.850
 thing can leave it arises because as 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.710
 will mix the same problem has arisen 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.569
 quotation marks equals one chickpea 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.280
 So what are we going to do? I 'm going. 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.739
 put here the fortim mint leaf 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.790
 all quantities as in the description only 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:17.180
 Can you speak what you have? 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:20.690
 was pressed onion and parsley 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.790
 that's it and we 're only going to play here now 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.850
 everything here we go there this goes 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.400
 turn one 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.770
 our secret commitment to our speaking 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:32.400
 did not understand now garlic cloves 2 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:34.200
 you can play it's 3 I cut it too 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.990
 one and a half weeks but it is a subemenda 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.240
 small if you are going to use big one 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:42.030
 big enough already 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:44.220
 here is salt pepper a little 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.230
 of cumin and I put powdered stream 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.060
 because I think it imposes a delight more 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.490
 If you do not like it you can use the 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.720
 coriander also to the leaf remaining 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:54.510
 same way 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.190
 the mint these things are optional I 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.650
 I really like talking, it was the doorman. 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.230
 so theater taste, you're lucky 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:04.410
 It has refreshments is a delight and there is a 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.450
 little ford and extra olive oil 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.480
