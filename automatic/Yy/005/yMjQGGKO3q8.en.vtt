00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:04.220 
so you want to get rid of mosquitoes up

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.950 
so you want to get rid of mosquitoes up
okay<00:00:05.220> Austin<00:00:05.910> another<00:00:06.649> a<00:00:07.649> different<00:00:08.340> video

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:08.960 
okay Austin another a different video

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.850 
okay Austin another a different video
you<00:00:09.960> can<00:00:10.170> bold<00:00:10.440> water<00:00:10.769> sugar<00:00:11.670> and<00:00:12.830> put<00:00:13.830> a

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
you can bold water sugar and put a

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.860 
you can bold water sugar and put a
little<00:00:14.040> bit<00:00:14.250> of<00:00:14.400> yeast<00:00:14.580> in<00:00:14.849> there<00:00:15.059> so<00:00:15.660> if<00:00:15.719> you

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
little bit of yeast in there so if you

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.400 
little bit of yeast in there so if you
don't<00:00:16.049> have<00:00:16.230> yeast<00:00:16.529> what<00:00:17.430> else<00:00:17.640> can<00:00:17.880> he<00:00:18.029> use

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:18.410 
don't have yeast what else can he use

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.310 
don't have yeast what else can he use
you<00:00:19.410> can<00:00:19.590> use<00:00:19.619> beer<00:00:20.100> or<00:00:20.820> one<00:00:21.300> I'm<00:00:21.960> going<00:00:22.140> to<00:00:22.230> use

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
you can use beer or one I'm going to use

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.050 
you can use beer or one I'm going to use
beer<00:00:22.619> tonight<00:00:23.210> because<00:00:24.210> I<00:00:24.720> think<00:00:24.779> it<00:00:25.640> it<00:00:26.640> helps

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
beer tonight because I think it it helps

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.880 
beer tonight because I think it it helps
a<00:00:27.150> little<00:00:27.300> bit<00:00:27.539> better<00:00:27.779> because<00:00:28.019> it<00:00:28.410> has<00:00:28.439> more

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
a little bit better because it has more

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.040 
a little bit better because it has more
yeast<00:00:30.199> now<00:00:31.199> see<00:00:31.500> when<00:00:32.070> you<00:00:32.099> bowl<00:00:32.550> water<00:00:33.450> and

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
yeast now see when you bowl water and

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.160 
yeast now see when you bowl water and
sugar<00:00:34.469> and<00:00:34.920> then<00:00:35.340> add<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.820> yeast<00:00:36.170> that's

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
sugar and then add the yeast that's

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.170 
sugar and then add the yeast that's
basically<00:00:37.890> what<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.309> burger<00:00:38.520> company<00:00:39.000> is

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
basically what the burger company is

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.069 
basically what the burger company is
there<00:00:39.360> anyway<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:40.140> make<00:00:40.590> beer<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:42.079> a

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
there anyway to make beer and a

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:51.680 
there anyway to make beer and a
byproduct<00:00:46.190> beer<00:00:47.190> or<00:00:48.230> sugar<00:00:49.230> water<00:00:49.440> yeast<00:00:50.690> its

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
byproduct beer or sugar water yeast its

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.080 
byproduct beer or sugar water yeast its
carbon<00:00:52.050> dioxide<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:53.210> alcohol<00:00:55.550> my<00:00:56.550> theory<00:00:56.910> is

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
carbon dioxide and alcohol my theory is

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.250 
carbon dioxide and alcohol my theory is
that<00:00:57.510> beer<00:00:58.260> will<00:00:58.590> work<00:00:58.800> just<00:00:58.890> as<00:00:59.250> well<00:00:59.719> say<00:01:00.719> you

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
that beer will work just as well say you

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.050 
that beer will work just as well say you
can<00:01:01.559> use<00:01:01.910> other<00:01:02.910> alcohols<00:01:03.570> like<00:01:04.729> you<00:01:05.729> can<00:01:05.880> use

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
can use other alcohols like you can use

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.570 
can use other alcohols like you can use
one<00:01:06.360> because<00:01:07.200> it<00:01:07.530> still<00:01:07.770> has<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:07.979> lot<00:01:08.220> of<00:01:08.250> yeast

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
one because it still has a lot of yeast

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.730 
one because it still has a lot of yeast
in<00:01:08.820> it<00:01:08.970> but<00:01:09.210> because<00:01:09.659> of<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.500> higher

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
in it but because of the the higher

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.030 
in it but because of the the higher
alcohol<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:11.790> kills<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:13.140> lot<00:01:13.530> of<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.799> east

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
alcohol and kills a lot of the east

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.390 
alcohol and kills a lot of the east
that's<00:01:14.400> why<00:01:14.610> you<00:01:14.670> could<00:01:15.060> use<00:01:15.890> you<00:01:16.890> probably

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
that's why you could use you probably

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.520 
that's why you could use you probably
couldn't<00:01:17.880> use<00:01:18.090> whiskey<00:01:18.720> or<00:01:18.990> anything<00:01:19.170> like

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
couldn't use whiskey or anything like

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.469 
couldn't use whiskey or anything like
that<00:01:19.590> because<00:01:22.130> the<00:01:23.130> alcohol<00:01:23.670> content<00:01:23.909> kills

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
that because the alcohol content kills

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.950 
that because the alcohol content kills
off<00:01:24.750> most<00:01:25.110> of<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.409> yeast<00:01:25.650> so<00:01:26.490> all<00:01:27.479> you<00:01:27.720> need<00:01:27.840> to

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
off most of the yeast so all you need to

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.950 
off most of the yeast so all you need to
do<00:01:28.430> take<00:01:29.430> out<00:01:29.640> an<00:01:29.909> empty<00:01:30.210> two-liter

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
do take out an empty two-liter

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.380 
do take out an empty two-liter
and<00:01:31.790> you're<00:01:32.790> going<00:01:32.939> to<00:01:33.060> cut<00:01:33.240> it<00:01:33.390> in<00:01:33.869> half<00:01:34.140> and

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
and you're going to cut it in half and

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.870 
and you're going to cut it in half and
take<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.540> top<00:01:37.250> put<00:01:38.250> it<00:01:38.369> in<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.610> bottom

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
take the top put it in the bottom

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.140 
take the top put it in the bottom
and<00:01:41.880> you're<00:01:42.270> going<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:42.450> tie<00:01:42.630> some<00:01:42.900> tight<00:01:44.150> tape

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.150 
and you're going to tie some tight tape

00:01:45.150 --> 00:02:22.460 
and you're going to tie some tight tape
off<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.420> sides

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:31.020 

now<00:02:26.010> it'll<00:02:27.010> catch<00:02:27.220> mosquitos<00:02:28.860> but<00:02:29.880> it<00:02:30.880> will

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
now it'll catch mosquitos but it will

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.479 
now it'll catch mosquitos but it will
catch<00:02:31.269> just<00:02:31.780> about<00:02:32.049> any<00:02:32.350> bugs<00:02:32.650> even<00:02:33.040> flies

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
catch just about any bugs even flies

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:35.820 
catch just about any bugs even flies
what<00:02:34.269> it's<00:02:34.540> really<00:02:34.810> good<00:02:35.110> for<00:02:35.260> flies<00:02:35.500> because

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
what it's really good for flies because

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.580 
what it's really good for flies because
they<00:02:36.130> fly<00:02:36.430> in<00:02:36.489> there<00:02:36.790> and<00:02:37.090> they<00:02:37.150> can't<00:02:37.390> get<00:02:37.540> out

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.520 

I'll<00:02:41.590> come<00:02:41.950> tomorrow<00:02:42.720> all<00:02:43.720> kinds<00:02:44.200> of<00:02:44.260> stuff

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
I'll come tomorrow all kinds of stuff

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:54.780 
I'll come tomorrow all kinds of stuff
but<00:02:45.840> so<00:02:46.840> you've<00:02:47.080> got<00:02:47.319> this<00:02:47.500> typed<00:02:48.220> up<00:02:53.790> this

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
but so you've got this typed up this

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.949 
but so you've got this typed up this
type<00:02:55.120> of<00:02:55.150> here

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
type of here

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:03.360 
type of here
the<00:02:57.680> top<00:02:57.890> four<00:02:58.310> down

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.540 

and<00:03:04.660> it's<00:03:05.660> like<00:03:05.840> you<00:03:05.990> only<00:03:06.110> need<00:03:06.410> about<00:03:06.440> a<00:03:07.100> half

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:07.550 
and it's like you only need about a half

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.060 
and it's like you only need about a half
a<00:03:07.610> beer<00:03:08.260> because<00:03:09.260> you<00:03:09.350> don't<00:03:09.560> want<00:03:09.770> all<00:03:09.920> the

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
a beer because you don't want all the

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:16.150 
a beer because you don't want all the
way<00:03:10.190> to<00:03:10.250> the<00:03:10.490> top<00:03:11.380> tough<00:03:12.380> love<00:03:12.680> is<00:03:14.980> just<00:03:15.980> a

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
way to the top tough love is just a

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.310 
way to the top tough love is just a
little<00:03:16.490> bit<00:03:16.640> in<00:03:16.790> the<00:03:16.880> bottom<00:03:17.980> and<00:03:20.140> give<00:03:21.140> it<00:03:21.260> a

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
little bit in the bottom and give it a

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.320 
little bit in the bottom and give it a
week<00:03:21.560> this<00:03:22.190> thing<00:03:22.490> will<00:03:22.730> be<00:03:22.880> filled<00:03:23.420> with<00:03:23.810> Mo's

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.330 
week this thing will be filled with Mo's

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.150 
week this thing will be filled with Mo's
all<00:03:26.330> kinds<00:03:26.840> of<00:03:26.930> phone<00:03:27.080> mosquitoes<00:03:27.680> flies

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
all kinds of phone mosquitoes flies

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:33.010 
all kinds of phone mosquitoes flies
gnats<00:03:30.130> anything<00:03:31.130> they<00:03:31.370> love<00:03:31.670> it<00:03:31.850> the<00:03:32.570> carbon

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:33.020 
gnats anything they love it the carbon

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.440 
gnats anything they love it the carbon
dioxide<00:03:33.620> you<00:03:34.430> know<00:03:34.550> one<00:03:34.790> of<00:03:34.880> the<00:03:34.940> byproducts

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
dioxide you know one of the byproducts

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:41.380 
dioxide you know one of the byproducts
it<00:03:35.900> attracts<00:03:37.090> the<00:03:38.090> bugs<00:03:38.570> and<00:03:40.180> that's<00:03:41.180> why

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
it attracts the bugs and that's why
