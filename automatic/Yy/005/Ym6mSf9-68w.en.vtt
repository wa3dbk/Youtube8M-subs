00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
three times the three different ways

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.510 
three times the three different ways
your<00:00:15.150> feelings<00:00:15.509> about<00:00:15.630> that<00:00:15.870> oh<00:00:16.369> it's<00:00:17.369> pretty

good feeling you know doing something no

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.359 
good feeling you know doing something no
one's<00:00:19.980> ever<00:00:20.100> done<00:00:20.279> before<00:00:20.400> and<00:00:21.260> I<00:00:22.310> don't<00:00:23.310> know

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
one's ever done before and I don't know

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.490 
one's ever done before and I don't know
I<00:00:23.400> was<00:00:23.519> a<00:00:23.550> tough<00:00:23.730> match<00:00:23.939> hit<00:00:24.930> my<00:00:25.019> heart<00:00:25.230> just

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
I was a tough match hit my heart just

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.120 
I was a tough match hit my heart just
like<00:00:25.650> any<00:00:25.859> way<00:00:26.039> without<00:00:26.160> wood<00:00:26.550> and<00:00:27.980> he<00:00:28.980> was

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
like any way without wood and he was

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.179 
like any way without wood and he was
just<00:00:29.390> he's<00:00:30.390> a<00:00:30.480> pretty<00:00:30.660> good<00:00:30.720> hand<00:00:30.960> putter<00:00:31.189> and

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
just he's a pretty good hand putter and

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.270 
just he's a pretty good hand putter and
I<00:00:32.369> think<00:00:32.719> that<00:00:33.860> you<00:00:34.860> gotta<00:00:35.040> give<00:00:35.160> him<00:00:35.219> credit

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
I think that you gotta give him credit

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.459 
I think that you gotta give him credit
for<00:00:35.579> that<00:00:35.610> and<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.660> fact<00:00:36.840> that<00:00:36.960> he<00:00:37.050> gave<00:00:37.200> it<00:00:37.380> as

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
for that and the fact that he gave it as

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.160 
for that and the fact that he gave it as
on<00:00:38.000> when<00:00:39.000> they<00:00:39.120> would<00:00:39.329> give<00:00:39.480> off<00:00:39.629> your<00:00:39.870> number

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
on when they would give off your number

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.750 
on when they would give off your number
is<00:00:40.260> not<00:00:40.290> just<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.620> hundred<00:00:40.950> career<00:00:41.280> wins<00:00:41.550> but

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
is not just the hundred career wins but

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.010 
is not just the hundred career wins but
the<00:00:41.850> fact<00:00:42.030> that<00:00:42.090> you<00:00:42.239> hardly<00:00:42.450> even<00:00:42.570> give<00:00:42.780> up<00:00:42.899> a

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
the fact that you hardly even give up a

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.450 
the fact that you hardly even give up a
point<00:00:43.290> in<00:00:43.500> this<00:00:43.620> tournament<00:00:43.920> that<00:00:44.219> type<00:00:44.430> of

point in this tournament that type of

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.940 
point in this tournament that type of
thing<00:00:44.820> what<00:00:45.539> is<00:00:45.690> ever<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.260> way<00:00:46.410> I<00:00:46.440> knew<00:00:46.680> at<00:00:46.800> all

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950

about<00:01:01.460> when<00:01:02.460> you<00:01:02.579> wrestle<00:01:02.820> well<00:01:03.180> you<00:01:03.449> look

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
about when you wrestle well you look

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.149 
about when you wrestle well you look
like<00:01:03.930> you're<00:01:04.080> enjoying<00:01:04.199> yourself<00:01:04.799> but<00:01:05.040> you

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
like you're enjoying yourself but you

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.490 
like you're enjoying yourself but you
also<00:01:05.369> can<00:01:05.700> fight<00:01:05.909> when<00:01:06.150> it<00:01:06.299> gets<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.600> little

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
also can fight when it gets a little

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.399 
also can fight when it gets a little
nasty<00:01:07.770> out<00:01:08.159> there<00:01:08.330> was<00:01:09.330> that<00:01:09.630> match<00:01:10.020> couldn't

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
nasty out there was that match couldn't

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.710 
nasty out there was that match couldn't
have<00:01:10.500> been<00:01:10.560> much<00:01:10.740> fun<00:01:11.070> it<00:01:11.909> was<00:01:12.030> all<00:01:12.210> right<00:01:12.450> we

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
um it was always in the back of my mind

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:26.590 
um it was always in the back of my mind
whenever<00:03:25.610> something<00:03:25.910> a<00:03:26.060> little<00:03:26.180> kid<00:03:26.360> I<00:03:26.390> was

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
whenever something a little kid I was

wanted to to go and try to compete
olympics<00:03:29.330> in<00:03:29.450> 2012<00:03:30.110> I<00:03:30.380> just<00:03:31.070> thought<00:03:31.280> that

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
olympics in 2012 I just thought that

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.130 
olympics in 2012 I just thought that
would<00:03:31.790> just<00:03:31.970> be<00:03:32.030> a<00:03:32.120> very<00:03:32.360> experience<00:03:32.810> for<00:03:33.019> me

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
would just be a very experience for me

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.390 
would just be a very experience for me
and<00:03:34.750> if<00:03:35.750> I<00:03:36.019> was<00:03:36.110> it<00:03:36.290> take<00:03:36.470> if<00:03:36.709> that<00:03:36.980> was<00:03:37.100> my<00:03:37.220> main

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
and if I was it take if that was my main

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.340 
and if I was it take if that was my main
goal<00:03:37.670> then<00:03:38.480> I<00:03:38.570> probably<00:03:38.750> would<00:03:38.959> have<00:03:39.019> taken<00:03:39.170> a

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
goal then I probably would have taken a

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.620 
goal then I probably would have taken a
little<00:03:39.470> bit<00:03:39.620> red<00:03:39.769> shirt<00:03:39.980> but<00:03:40.850> I<00:03:41.239> haven't

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
little bit red shirt but I haven't

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:42.970 
little bit red shirt but I haven't
talked<00:03:41.870> to<00:03:41.959> my<00:03:42.080> coaches<00:03:42.320> and<00:03:42.709> pitting<00:03:42.890> my

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
talked to my coaches and pitting my

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.150 
talked to my coaches and pitting my
parents<00:03:43.430> and<00:03:43.610> and<00:03:43.850> things<00:03:44.420> like<00:03:44.540> that<00:03:44.600> did<00:03:45.470> we

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
parents and and things like that did we

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.470 
parents and and things like that did we
decide<00:03:46.400> it<00:03:46.580> together<00:03:46.850> that<00:03:46.940> would<00:03:47.150> be<00:03:47.300> best

the past that scored 124 points in the

or<00:05:39.380> something<00:05:39.650> like<00:05:39.740> that<00:05:39.800> so<00:05:40.160> that's<00:05:40.580> crazy

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:41.060 
or something like that so that's crazy

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:42.580 
or something like that so that's crazy
to<00:05:41.210> think<00:05:41.240> that<00:05:41.480> we<00:05:41.690> can<00:05:41.810> compare<00:05:42.200> all<00:05:42.410> these

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:42.590 
to think that we can compare all these

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:43.930 
to think that we can compare all these
teams<00:05:42.860> plus<00:05:43.100> there's<00:05:43.340> less<00:05:43.490> teams<00:05:43.730> there's

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:43.940 
teams plus there's less teams there's

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:45.520 
teams plus there's less teams there's
just<00:05:44.090> so<00:05:44.210> many<00:05:44.270> factors<00:05:44.540> that<00:05:44.750> go<00:05:44.960> into<00:05:44.990> it<00:05:45.350> I

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:45.530 
just so many factors that go into it I

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:47.950 
just so many factors that go into it I
mean<00:05:46.160> what<00:05:47.000> if<00:05:47.120> we<00:05:47.210> start<00:05:47.450> compared<00:05:47.810> you<00:05:47.930> to

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:31.220 
multiple national champs and I think

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:33.580 
multiple national champs and I think
this<00:06:31.310> year<00:06:31.550> we<00:06:31.670> have<00:06:31.700> good<00:06:32.300> chances<00:06:32.570> any<00:06:32.930> we

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:33.590 
this year we have good chances any we

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:35.470 
this year we have good chances any we
got<00:06:33.740> two<00:06:33.890> more<00:06:33.920> guys<00:06:34.220> two<00:06:34.520> more<00:06:34.700> shots<00:06:34.910> and<00:06:35.300> if

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:35.480 
got two more guys two more shots and if

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:38.410 
got two more guys two more shots and if
they<00:06:35.900> wrestle<00:06:36.230> their<00:06:36.380> potential<00:06:36.920> and<00:06:37.240> like<00:06:38.240> I

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:38.420 
they wrestle their potential and like I

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:39.880 
they wrestle their potential and like I

know they can if they wrestled their
best<00:06:40.130> I<00:06:40.280> think<00:06:40.310> they<00:06:40.580> can<00:06:40.730> win<00:06:40.850> obviously<00:06:41.320> this
