00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.120 
two years which is disappointing from
our<00:01:59.940> point<00:02:00.150> of<00:02:00.300> view<00:02:00.360> so<00:02:01.080> when<00:02:01.770> you<00:02:01.860> don't<00:02:02.040> have

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
our point of view so when you don't have

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.920 
our point of view so when you don't have
something<00:02:02.460> you<00:02:02.910> know<00:02:03.060> you<00:02:03.120> want<00:02:03.390> it<00:02:03.450> more<00:02:03.600> and

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
something you know you want it more and

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
something you know you want it more and
I'm<00:02:04.050> hoping<00:02:04.200> that's<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.530> case<00:02:04.590> for<00:02:04.890> the

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
I'm hoping that's the case for the

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.740 
I'm hoping that's the case for the
players<00:02:05.190> as<00:02:05.310> well<00:02:05.340> I<00:02:05.850> suppose<00:02:06.330> part<00:02:06.600> of<00:02:06.690> the

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
players as well I suppose part of the

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.150 
players as well I suppose part of the
challenge<00:02:06.930> for<00:02:07.200> you<00:02:07.320> is<00:02:07.350> to<00:02:07.500> motivate<00:02:07.800> the

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
challenge for you is to motivate the

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.250 
challenge for you is to motivate the
players<00:02:08.490> that<00:02:08.520> you<00:02:08.790> already<00:02:08.940> have<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.930> also

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:10.260 
players that you already have and also

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.170 
players that you already have and also
to<00:02:10.440> bring<00:02:10.530> in<00:02:10.710> some<00:02:10.860> of<00:02:10.890> our<00:02:11.070> new<00:02:11.250> faces<00:02:11.670> to<00:02:11.700> to
