00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:36.909 
this time I'm not sure about that I mean

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:39.719 
this time I'm not sure about that I mean
if<00:01:37.060> you<00:01:37.149> look<00:01:37.299> at<00:01:37.450> Fukushima<00:01:38.049> Shinichi<00:01:38.740> that

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729 
if you look at Fukushima Shinichi that

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:41.730 
if you look at Fukushima Shinichi that
guys<00:01:39.880> still<00:01:39.909> going<00:01:40.270> like<00:01:40.869> really<00:01:41.259> well<00:01:41.500> he's

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
guys still going like really well he's

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.230 
guys still going like really well he's
in<00:01:41.770> the<00:01:41.920> breaks<00:01:42.130> every<00:01:42.399> day<00:01:42.549> and<00:01:42.670> he's<00:01:42.759> 43

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
in the breaks every day and he's 43

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.639 
in the breaks every day and he's 43
years<00:01:43.420> old<00:01:43.539> if<00:01:43.780> you<00:01:43.840> look<00:01:43.929> at<00:01:43.990> Dave<00:01:44.140> Makani<00:01:44.530> is

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:44.649 
years old if you look at Dave Makani is

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:46.469 
years old if you look at Dave Makani is
also<00:01:44.950> going<00:01:45.130> very<00:01:45.310> well<00:01:45.399> I<00:01:45.789> think<00:01:46.329> it's<00:01:46.450> just

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
also going very well I think it's just

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:47.609 
also going very well I think it's just
all<00:01:46.659> about<00:01:46.780> the<00:01:46.899> passion<00:01:47.079> you<00:01:47.259> have<00:01:47.320> to<00:01:47.530> the

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:47.619 
all about the passion you have to the

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:50.100 
all about the passion you have to the
sport<00:01:48.240> you<00:01:49.240> can<00:01:49.270> have<00:01:49.479> talent<00:01:49.810> but<00:01:49.899> if<00:01:50.020> you

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
sport you can have talent but if you

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.359 
sport you can have talent but if you
have<00:01:50.229> the<00:01:50.320> motivation<00:01:50.649> to<00:01:50.860> get<00:01:51.009> out<00:01:51.100> and<00:01:51.189> train

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
have the motivation to get out and train

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:53.460 
have the motivation to get out and train
and<00:01:51.549> to<00:01:51.640> go<00:01:51.759> out<00:01:51.880> and<00:01:52.060> have<00:01:52.420> a<00:01:52.450> big<00:01:52.659> and<00:01:53.319> that's

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
and to go out and have a big and that's

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.410 
and to go out and have a big and that's
the<00:01:53.530> most<00:01:53.649> important<00:01:54.100> thing<00:01:54.130> but<00:01:54.399> I<00:01:54.610> think<00:01:55.090> the

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
the most important thing but I think the

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.230 
the most important thing but I think the
thing<00:01:55.659> maybe<00:01:56.020> that<00:01:56.229> I've<00:01:56.319> got<00:01:56.880> that<00:01:57.880> I<00:01:57.940> really

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
thing maybe that I've got that I really

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.389 
thing maybe that I've got that I really
cherish<00:01:58.270> is<00:01:58.720> the<00:01:58.840> sense<00:01:59.049> of<00:01:59.170> perspective<00:01:59.439> I

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:00.399 
cherish is the sense of perspective I

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:02.490 
cherish is the sense of perspective I
know<00:02:00.789> that<00:02:00.909> this<00:02:01.330> isn't<00:02:01.539> everything<00:02:01.840> it's<00:02:02.380> a

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
know that this isn't everything it's a

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.669 
know that this isn't everything it's a
great<00:02:02.649> fantastic<00:02:03.580> wonderful<00:02:04.090> sport<00:02:04.450> but<00:02:04.720> I

00:02:05.669 --> 00:02:05.679 
great fantastic wonderful sport but I

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:07.559 
great fantastic wonderful sport but I
think<00:02:06.369> winning<00:02:06.549> is<00:02:06.700> placed<00:02:06.970> two<00:02:07.090> highly<00:02:07.450> these

00:02:07.559 --> 00:02:07.569 
think winning is placed two highly these

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:09.120 
think winning is placed two highly these
days<00:02:07.780> I<00:02:07.929> think<00:02:08.110> competing<00:02:08.619> and<00:02:08.769> giving<00:02:09.009> your

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
days I think competing and giving your

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:10.529 
days I think competing and giving your
best<00:02:09.220> is<00:02:09.489> what<00:02:09.729> it's<00:02:09.849> all<00:02:09.940> about<00:02:09.970> and<00:02:10.330> what<00:02:10.390> you

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
best is what it's all about and what you

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.240 
best is what it's all about and what you
get<00:02:10.660> out<00:02:10.750> of<00:02:10.810> the<00:02:10.959> sport<00:02:11.200> and<00:02:11.830> is<00:02:12.069> the<00:02:12.160> most

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
get out of the sport and is the most

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.250 
get out of the sport and is the most
important<00:02:12.810> there's<00:02:13.810> obviously<00:02:14.019> a<00:02:14.080> lot<00:02:14.110> of

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
important there's obviously a lot of

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.809 
important there's obviously a lot of
people<00:02:14.470> out<00:02:14.590> there<00:02:14.680> who<00:02:14.980> has<00:02:15.400> never<00:02:15.580> I've

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
people out there who has never I've

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
to do so and it is a difficult thing to

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.820 
to do so and it is a difficult thing to
do<00:02:19.690> but<00:02:19.930> is<00:02:20.110> there<00:02:20.200> any<00:02:20.349> advice<00:02:20.560> that<00:02:20.590> you

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
ever say it's all a dream I mean like a

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.069 
ever say it's all a dream I mean like a
friend<00:02:28.030> of<00:02:28.120> mine<00:02:28.209> said<00:02:28.420> to<00:02:28.510> me<00:02:28.600> I<00:02:28.630> think<00:02:28.810> he's

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:29.079 
friend of mine said to me I think he's

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:30.750 
friend of mine said to me I think he's
he's<00:02:29.350> 54<00:02:29.890> he<00:02:30.010> said<00:02:30.190> I<00:02:30.310> want<00:02:30.489> to<00:02:30.549> be<00:02:30.609> like<00:02:30.730> you

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
he's 54 he said I want to be like you

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.490 
he's 54 he said I want to be like you
and<00:02:31.000> I<00:02:31.060> grew<00:02:31.209> up<00:02:31.269> and<00:02:31.420> I<00:02:31.510> said<00:02:31.570> you<00:02:32.350> already

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
and I grew up and I said you already

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.500 
and I grew up and I said you already
know<00:02:32.680> the<00:02:32.769> secret<00:02:33.130> just<00:02:33.250> don't<00:02:33.459> go<00:02:33.549> up<00:02:33.730> that's

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
know the secret just don't go up that's

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:35.819 
know the secret just don't go up that's
basically<00:02:34.630> I<00:02:34.930> think<00:02:35.350> if<00:02:35.440> you<00:02:35.500> put<00:02:35.680> these

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:35.829 
basically I think if you put these

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:37.289 
basically I think if you put these
boundaries<00:02:36.160> on<00:02:36.340> yourself<00:02:36.670> you're<00:02:36.910> gonna<00:02:37.030> fail

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:37.299 
boundaries on yourself you're gonna fail

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:41.160 
boundaries on yourself you're gonna fail
I<00:02:38.170> think<00:02:38.650> we<00:02:38.910> as<00:02:39.910> we<00:02:40.120> get<00:02:40.239> older<00:02:40.299> we<00:02:40.540> anticipate

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
I think we as we get older we anticipate

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.080 
I think we as we get older we anticipate
sort<00:02:41.470> of<00:02:41.560> degeneration<00:02:42.220> but<00:02:42.579> I<00:02:42.730> don't<00:02:42.940> think

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
sort of degeneration but I don't think

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.910 
sort of degeneration but I don't think
that<00:02:43.239> has<00:02:43.359> to<00:02:43.390> be<00:02:43.540> the<00:02:43.630> case<00:02:43.780> what's<00:02:44.680> next

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
that has to be the case what's next

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.789 
that has to be the case what's next
going<00:02:45.340> what's<00:02:45.940> next<00:02:46.150> for<00:02:46.359> you<00:02:46.500> next<00:02:47.500> for<00:02:47.709> me

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:47.799 
going what's next for you next for me

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:50.220 
going what's next for you next for me
well<00:02:48.519> in<00:02:48.790> the<00:02:48.880> very<00:02:49.030> short<00:02:49.090> future<00:02:49.480> next<00:02:49.840> is<00:02:49.989> 12

what's the Asian scene like obviously

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.410 
what's the Asian scene like obviously
you're<00:03:25.560> not<00:03:25.650> from<00:03:25.890> there<00:03:26.069> so<00:03:26.430> how<00:03:27.150> does<00:03:27.209> it

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
you're not from there so how does it

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.660 
you're not from there so how does it
compare<00:03:27.540> to<00:03:27.830> to<00:03:28.830> what<00:03:29.100> people<00:03:29.370> would<00:03:29.459> perceive

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
compare to to what people would perceive

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.040 
compare to to what people would perceive
as<00:03:29.970> they<00:03:30.090> said<00:03:30.300> of<00:03:30.360> European<00:03:30.660> see<00:03:30.840> into<00:03:30.959> the

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
as they said of European see into the

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.040 
as they said of European see into the
u.s.<00:03:31.319> seen<00:03:31.560> what<00:03:31.950> differences<00:03:32.280> are<00:03:32.430> there<00:03:32.459> I

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.050 
u.s. seen what differences are there I

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:35.660 
u.s. seen what differences are there I
think<00:03:34.050> obviously<00:03:34.560> there's<00:03:34.980> a<00:03:35.069> different<00:03:35.400> the

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
think obviously there's a different the

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.070 
think obviously there's a different the
level<00:03:35.970> of<00:03:36.060> the<00:03:36.120> well<00:03:36.540> I'm<00:03:36.720> honest<00:03:36.900> amongst

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
level of the well I'm honest amongst

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.470 
level of the well I'm honest amongst
little<00:03:37.350> level<00:03:37.560> but<00:03:37.830> um<00:03:37.980> the<00:03:38.940> culture<00:03:39.360> in

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
little level but um the culture in

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:40.970 
little level but um the culture in
Europe<00:03:39.750> is<00:03:39.870> very<00:03:40.140> progressed<00:03:40.500> we've<00:03:40.860> been
