00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.380
 I like pistachio for its color for 

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:09.940
 its crunchy and especially for its taste 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.850

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:15.130

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:24.630
 we started by mixing the huge 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:27.550
 and icing sugar flour all heavy fine 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.230
 and is always a little bit of salt 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.650
 who will make the contrast for the sweet 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.089
 the dirty 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:34.529
