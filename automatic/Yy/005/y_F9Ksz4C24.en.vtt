Candace<00:00:30.150> today<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:30.750> she<00:00:30.960> asked<00:00:31.350> me<00:00:31.500> about

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:31.530 
Candace today and she asked me about

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:33.950 
Candace today and she asked me about
well<00:00:32.250> what<00:00:32.669> is<00:00:32.790> it<00:00:32.969> how<00:00:33.180> does<00:00:33.239> it<00:00:33.510> infrared

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
well what is it how does it infrared

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.500 
well what is it how does it infrared
actually<00:00:34.379> work<00:00:35.129> to<00:00:35.489> lose<00:00:35.760> weight<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:36.239> we<00:00:36.360> got

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
actually work to lose weight and we got

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.169 
actually work to lose weight and we got
in<00:00:36.660> a<00:00:36.719> big<00:00:36.750> discussion<00:00:37.290> so<00:00:37.710> I<00:00:37.739> wanted<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.460> see

00:00:39.169 --> 00:00:39.179 
in a big discussion so I wanted to see

00:00:39.179 --> 00:00:41.959 
in a big discussion so I wanted to see
if<00:00:39.300> I<00:00:39.449> could<00:00:39.510> get<00:00:40.230> into<00:00:40.410> that<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.710> little<00:00:41.190> now<00:00:41.940> I

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
if I could get into that a little now I

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.970 
if I could get into that a little now I
know<00:00:42.120> weight<00:00:42.570> loss<00:00:42.839> is<00:00:43.170> something<00:00:43.589> when<00:00:43.949> I

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
know weight loss is something when I

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.250 
know weight loss is something when I
hear<00:00:44.399> oh<00:00:44.609> this<00:00:44.879> is<00:00:44.999> a<00:00:45.030> weight<00:00:45.300> loss<00:00:45.480> product<00:00:45.899> or

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
hear oh this is a weight loss product or

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.349 
hear oh this is a weight loss product or
I<00:00:46.559> just<00:00:46.980> immediately<00:00:47.850> quit<00:00:48.089> listening

00:00:48.349 --> 00:00:48.359 
I just immediately quit listening

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:51.049 
I just immediately quit listening
because<00:00:48.989> there's<00:00:49.829> just<00:00:49.920> so<00:00:50.339> much<00:00:50.519> out<00:00:50.760> there

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
because there's just so much out there

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.610 
because there's just so much out there
and<00:00:51.210> it<00:00:51.269> seems<00:00:51.510> crazy<00:00:51.690> so<00:00:52.050> what<00:00:52.260> I<00:00:52.289> want<00:00:52.559> to

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
and it seems crazy so what I want to

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.160 
and it seems crazy so what I want to
talk<00:00:52.800> about<00:00:53.010> mostly<00:00:53.550> today<00:00:53.670> is<00:00:54.179> the<00:00:54.780> direct

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
talk about mostly today is the direct

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.790 
talk about mostly today is the direct
relationship<00:00:55.739> between<00:00:56.629> toxins<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:57.899> weight

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
relationship between toxins and weight

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.160 
relationship between toxins and weight
loss<00:00:59.039> and<00:00:59.399> so<00:00:59.909> this<00:01:00.089> is<00:01:00.239> how<00:01:00.390> it<00:01:00.600> works<00:01:00.899> there's

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
loss and so this is how it works there's

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.259 
loss and so this is how it works there's
a<00:01:01.229> term<00:01:01.589> you<00:01:01.829> can<00:01:01.979> look<00:01:02.159> it<00:01:02.280> up<00:01:02.370> online<00:01:02.579> and

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:03.269 
a term you can look it up online and

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:05.420 
a term you can look it up online and
it's<00:01:03.449> called<00:01:03.690> obesogenic<00:01:04.110> so<00:01:04.890> what<00:01:05.129> is<00:01:05.280> an

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
it's called obesogenic so what is an

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.060 
it's called obesogenic so what is an
obese<00:01:05.790> of<00:01:05.970> gym<00:01:06.150> this<00:01:06.270> was<00:01:06.510> a<00:01:06.590> term<00:01:07.590> that<00:01:07.620> was

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
obese of gym this was a term that was

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.609 
obese of gym this was a term that was
coined<00:01:08.220> by<00:01:08.700> two<00:01:08.850> researchers<00:01:09.780> at<00:01:10.049> University

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
coined by two researchers at University

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.730 
coined by two researchers at University
of<00:01:10.649> California<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:11.490> Irvine<00:01:12.420> basically<00:01:13.200> when

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
of California and Irvine basically when

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.899 
of California and Irvine basically when
toxins<00:01:14.340> come<00:01:14.579> in<00:01:14.759> to<00:01:15.030> a<00:01:15.060> fat<00:01:15.420> cell<00:01:15.810> it's<00:01:16.909> going

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
toxins come in to a fat cell it's going

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.330 
toxins come in to a fat cell it's going
to<00:01:18.000> disrupt<00:01:18.329> the<00:01:18.630> fat<00:01:18.930> cell<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:20.009> way<00:01:20.159> the

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
to disrupt the fat cell and the way the

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.060 
to disrupt the fat cell and the way the
fat<00:01:20.549> cell<00:01:20.850> operates<00:01:21.509> so<00:01:22.049> basically<00:01:22.619> the

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
fat cell operates so basically the

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.029 
fat cell operates so basically the
shorthand<00:01:23.670> is<00:01:23.850> that<00:01:24.200> the<00:01:25.200> fat<00:01:25.530> cell<00:01:25.829> gets

00:01:26.029 --> 00:01:26.039 
shorthand is that the fat cell gets

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:30.020 
shorthand is that the fat cell gets
toxic<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:26.789> then<00:01:27.479> it<00:01:27.689> can't<00:01:28.020> lose<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.920> fat<00:01:29.219> it

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
toxic and then it can't lose the fat it

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.929 
toxic and then it can't lose the fat it
can't<00:01:30.840> change<00:01:31.320> it<00:01:31.710> can't<00:01:31.979> you<00:01:32.189> know<00:01:32.280> so<00:01:32.460> you've

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
can't change it can't you know so you've

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.240 
can't change it can't you know so you've
probably<00:01:33.149> known<00:01:33.509> people<00:01:34.049> and<00:01:34.680> maybe<00:01:34.920> you're

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
probably known people and maybe you're

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.270 
probably known people and maybe you're
one<00:01:35.570> yourself<00:01:36.570> that<00:01:37.259> you<00:01:37.439> tried<00:01:37.890> everything

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
one yourself that you tried everything

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.510 
one yourself that you tried everything
you<00:01:38.549> eat<00:01:39.509> really<00:01:39.780> well<00:01:39.960> you<00:01:40.439> exercise<00:01:41.219> you're

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
you eat really well you exercise you're

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.620 
you eat really well you exercise you're
at<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.939> gym<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.450> you<00:01:42.840> can't<00:01:43.229> lose<00:01:43.530> weight<00:01:44.630> for

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
at the gym and you can't lose weight for

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.170 
at the gym and you can't lose weight for
anything<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.350> this<00:01:47.039> could<00:01:47.399> be<00:01:47.430> what's<00:01:47.820> going

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
anything and this could be what's going

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.319 
anything and this could be what's going
on<00:01:48.329> now<00:01:48.619> BPA<00:01:49.619> is<00:01:50.189> something<00:01:50.820> that<00:01:51.030> you<00:01:51.149> may

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
on now BPA is something that you may

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.959 
on now BPA is something that you may
have<00:01:51.420> heard<00:01:51.659> of<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:52.079> it's<00:01:52.350> a<00:01:52.439> chemical<00:01:52.969> toxin

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:53.969 
have heard of and it's a chemical toxin

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:57.020 
have heard of and it's a chemical toxin
that's<00:01:54.659> in<00:01:55.049> bottles<00:01:56.009> it's<00:01:56.280> in<00:01:56.429> a<00:01:56.520> lot<00:01:56.729> of<00:01:56.759> the

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
that's in bottles it's in a lot of the

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.230 
that's in bottles it's in a lot of the
things<00:01:57.299> that<00:01:57.659> we<00:01:58.289> use<00:01:58.649> and<00:01:58.920> have<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.490> it's

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
things that we use and have and it's

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.989 
things that we use and have and it's
been<00:02:00.479> a<00:02:00.509> toxin<00:02:01.049> also<00:02:01.469> linked<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.219> cancer<00:02:02.700> and

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:02.999 
been a toxin also linked to cancer and

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:05.179 
been a toxin also linked to cancer and
so<00:02:03.600> there's<00:02:03.840> some<00:02:04.049> other<00:02:04.289> chemicals<00:02:04.979> that<00:02:05.070> are

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
so there's some other chemicals that are

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.540 
so there's some other chemicals that are
directly<00:02:05.700> that<00:02:06.329> caused<00:02:06.689> this<00:02:07.340> condition<00:02:08.340> of

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
directly that caused this condition of

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.230 
directly that caused this condition of
