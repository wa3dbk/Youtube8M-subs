helping force it through it and back out
for<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:11.909> normal<00:01:12.210> scenes<00:01:12.619> since<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.770> 120

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
volts and you need to have some kind of

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.030 
volts and you need to have some kind of
electric<00:01:17.189> cord<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:17.549> robbed<00:01:17.759> one<00:01:17.970> from<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.270> lamp

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040

laying<00:01:20.040> it<00:01:20.189> right<00:01:20.220> down<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.580> back<00:01:20.700> of<00:01:20.759> the

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
laying it right down the back of the

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.170 
laying it right down the back of the
Xbox<00:01:21.420> I<00:01:22.189> don't<00:01:23.189> have<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.340> switcher<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:23.820> I<00:01:24.030> guess

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
Xbox I don't have a switcher and I guess

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.120 
Xbox I don't have a switcher and I guess
I<00:01:24.299> could<00:01:24.509> put<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:24.720> switch<00:01:24.930> on<00:01:25.170> it<00:01:25.200> let's<00:01:25.860> lug<00:01:26.040> it

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
I could put a switch on it let's lug it

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.670 
I could put a switch on it let's lug it
right<00:01:26.280> into<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.520> wall<00:01:26.700> I<00:01:27.470> probably<00:01:28.470> should

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
right into the wall I probably should

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.200 
right into the wall I probably should
have<00:01:28.710> put<00:01:28.920> some<00:01:29.070> kind<00:01:29.100> of<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.400> fuse<00:01:29.670> in<00:01:29.850> between

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
have put some kind of a fuse in between

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.780 
have put some kind of a fuse in between
dinner<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.479> maybe<00:01:31.110> I<00:01:31.170> will<00:01:31.380> sort<00:01:31.680> of<00:01:31.770> at<00:01:32.610> some
