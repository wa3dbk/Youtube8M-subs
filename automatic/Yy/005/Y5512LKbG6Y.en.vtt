00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:06.870
 how to mike cheeseburger 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:10.170
 ezio go and today i will show how it 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.670
 I do q for this we need 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.370
 sesame bun 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.740
 stuffing I saw tires lettuce leaves 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.449
 sour cheese pickle or pickled 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.609
 mayonnaise ketchup and seasonings 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.369
 the first thing to do is cut 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:33.690
 across the bun or buns because 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:37.370
 I already 4 further we lubricate the base in 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.370
 each bun with a thin layer of mayonnaise 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:44.579
 after which others stutter again 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.649
 marinated cucumber for ringlets and 34 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.500
 I spread things on a bun I grease 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.780
 mayonnaise salad the next stage in my 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.480
 the leaves are big enough so me 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:58.280
 will have to transform a little bit 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.280
 Generally lay out the salad on the cucumbers 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.979
 See what handsome and we already 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.810
 are obtained 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.580
 further so that our cheeseburger does not fall apart in 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.770
 link with the next layer 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.170
 will be ketchup which should 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.970
 grease a little lettuce leaves after 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.970
 what we cook and our meat layer 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.440
 mince pre let no eggs no 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.229
 no onion bread i go there nothing like that 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.210
 I put while forming patties include 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.539
 pan and pour a little bit there 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.880
 oils and further lepishechku tumble down flour 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:43.920
 and spread on a preheated pan well 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.990
 generally ideal to replace the flour 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.759
 breadcrumbs new yes idea 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:55.140
 came after we started 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:57.869
 sting burgers on our buns 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.570
 put the fried patties shooting 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.600
 sprinkle with spices I have this spice for 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.580
 kebab impose a piece of cheese to 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.100
 he managed to melt and glue with 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:11.489
 the tip and so we do with our every 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:15.769
 burger of salivating already flogged well here in 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.769
