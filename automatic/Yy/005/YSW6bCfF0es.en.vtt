00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.650
 is helping us in the least and 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.500
 we currently have to take great care 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.380
 all our body from the skin to 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.390
 the cuticle of our nails or of 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.519
 our hands true that's why today 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.140
 Coconut accompanies us how he is with us 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.029
 to tell us how to fight that 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.550
 dryness that often causes the 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.219
 deceased and we all hurt a lot and 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.930
 they will not be so worthy true today not as 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.480
 these little bit very well and with this 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.489
 article already a little moisture google and 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.500
 so hello how is your cuticle 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.110
 cuticle like this cuticle says that very 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.420
 all right 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.280
 with the cold it dries a lot and with the 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.440
 Heat also with love also 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.809
 they prescribe a lot so that's how it is then 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.730
 Well, he's a very important guy 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.590
 for our friends who also for 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.510
 please move it to their daughters to their 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.090
 young children because suddenly that 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.640
 they play basketball volleyball not then 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.500
 let's have that care because when you have 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.489
 a lot of dryness crack and then 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.619
 what is so big 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.299
 then these creatures begin to 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.149
 pull the skin to pull to pull 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:15.030
 pull to bite the same do not do the back 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:16.820
 then greater options and notice that 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.229
 as we have been handling several 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.520
 several elements that we have at home 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.700
 because I'm sure that our friends 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.020
 they already have them there are several options 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.820
 normally we will always look for a 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.159
 cuticle cream you know that 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.500
 they exist good in many brands but 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.299
 good if at home we already have in this case 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.220
 our warm water that we are going to 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.110
 use the let's pour in it 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.369
 our rose water because remember 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.590
 that our rose water has 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.690
 moisturizers ok well I have them 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.399
 presented already in our coconut oil 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.190
 for example but if I want to mark a 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.959
 difference look well here we have a 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:52.470
 coconut oil and at this other extreme 

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:55.190
 which it is also the target in 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:58.950
 this jar that comes normal from pharmacy 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:00.689
 the consistency of that of that oil 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.840
 coconut is this creampie that you see 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:06.509
 ok here I just put it right now 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.940
 it is in the files the first one that 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:12.340
 I showed them we will serve but 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.950
 I think that if you ask for it in a 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.290
 big pharmacy ask me to prepare oil 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.420
 of coconut they will send you in this 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.550
 presentation a creampie like this one 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.440
 come here ok then I suggest 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.270
 I definitely wanted to bring the two for 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.130
 make the difference that for the 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.290
 matter of our cuticle use 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.540
 this white that is already prepared in 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.280
 our big pharmacy and we're going to 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.170
 do apply it on our nails as 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.690
 capital if you do us please to graph it 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:41.410
 again be able to put it in the in the 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:44.320
 cuticle ok and look carefully we will give 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:47.440
 a lot of increase we are going to put 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:51.070
 for two minutes and then we're going to put 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:54.040
 our hand in warm water or 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:55.600
 warm but this twine already has 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.570
 rose water water 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:01.900
 if they also have some oil that 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:03.820
 have a little bit of eucalyptus or thyme 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:07.000
 that I also have it here can we 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:09.220
 serve ok and it's important that after 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.900
 I have not applied metamos merit 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.900
 we are the little hand 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.829
 and we'll leave it there a few minutes 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.439
 precisely so that it does not help 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:19.900
 penetrate the point will help us the 

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:21.819
 habitat of roses and then we're going to 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.760
 use our orange stick 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:27.310
 true and will help us precisely 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.560
 to put our raise our 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:33.129
 cuticle look good let's make it 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.870
 up because we do this because 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:37.329
 we're going to loosen it and it's going to allow us 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.370
 that we grow the nail we will give 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:41.560
 as that freedom of movement to 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.239
 our natural and good growth 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.099
 these are the ones that tend to be good 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:46.329
 manicure is pretty good but if 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:48.879
 from now on, young women can 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:50.560
 avoid it and can only do so in 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:52.659
 these movements that we just made 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.340
 with our coconut oil our water 

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:56.739
 of roses and our orange stick 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:59.109
 to take it up is perfect 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:01.510
 we do not need more and we're going to keep 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:03.639
 always our particular moisturized and 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.319
 after good we can apply the 

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:07.569
 enamel that we want for 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:08.950
 course and good then for 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:10.959
 put them a little more flirtatious 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.939
 our hands truly what a wonder of 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:14.740
 wonder, that's the way I do. I'm going to 

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:16.810
 recommend that no no 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:19.120
 in the stepfathers of the little fish 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:21.880
 because they can really cause a 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.500
 infection and really doing it because 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.480
 good or you will do it with or with your mouth or 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:28.000
 with the essential hand and that is not 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:30.340
 nice because then in that in that 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.530
 small hole that one makes there is 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:35.560
 put the sayings of the hand and saliva 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:38.680
 and he really gets his finger very infected 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:41.620
 then I comment and it's important 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.210
 because the person who healed me from this one 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.670
 He said that there was no need to cut 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:48.610
 you do not have to cut it just tangled 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:51.070
 see it like this and keep it moist for 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:53.680
 Do not make these hard little pieces like that 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:55.840
 and very carefully empty news 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.340
 so that jobs do not hurt heaton is 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.410
 very little we are going to move it towards 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.690
 out upwards and in addition 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.580
 look carefully every night that you already 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.170
 you are going to sleep and if you have this problem 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.900
 at this time with your coconut oil 

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:10.660
 I fist in your cuticles and leaving there 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.820
 really with her nothing happens we're going to 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:15.310
 do super good you're going to use you're going to 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:17.740
 wet you're going to bathe and obviously if 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:19.419
 there is a bit of dryness we are going to 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.830
 to counteract with our oil 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:23.680
 coconut this you can use all the 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:25.960
 nights and if you do not like to have so much 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.940
 humidification or so much fat because it is 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.160
 that problem of the young mom did not 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:31.780
 like the fat in my hands, well, let's go 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.030
 to make an effort in what we are 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.500
 eliminate this situation and good 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:37.930
 then we can put a little bit of 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:39.669
 hand moisturizer that will dry 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.860
 but if you put it in the night you 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:44.229
 coconut oil will you really have 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:49.750
 excellent results it is seen that already the 

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:51.610
 name tells you often we have 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:59.699
 what to do is the whole orange tree in the 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:59.699
 cuticle for every 15 days daily and 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:05.919
 now enough if the back 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:08.500
 when we told that to determine 

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:10.599
 the nails area and they start at 300 like this 

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:12.940
 the recommendation of olive oil in 

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:15.370
 Nails sensational with many thanks 

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:18.270
 thank you all to see that you have víctor 

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:18.270
 for nails
