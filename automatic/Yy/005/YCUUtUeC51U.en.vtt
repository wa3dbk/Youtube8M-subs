story use them wisely Christy wrote this
story<00:07:13.520> on<00:07:13.759> a<00:07:13.789> bed<00:07:14.029> she<00:07:14.599> bet<00:07:14.839> her<00:07:15.020> friends<00:07:15.379> that

00:07:15.489 --> 00:07:15.499 
story on a bed she bet her friends that

00:07:15.499 --> 00:07:17.350 
story on a bed she bet her friends that
she<00:07:15.559> could<00:07:15.919> write<00:07:16.069> a<00:07:16.129> mystery<00:07:16.610> novel<00:07:16.969> where<00:07:17.149> no

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:17.360 
she could write a mystery novel where no

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.269 
she could write a mystery novel where no
one<00:07:17.539> could<00:07:17.749> guess<00:07:18.050> the<00:07:18.080> killer<00:07:18.499> until<00:07:18.979> the<00:07:19.129> end

00:07:19.269 --> 00:07:19.279 
one could guess the killer until the end

00:07:19.279 --> 00:07:22.299 
one could guess the killer until the end
I<00:07:19.580> think<00:07:19.969> she<00:07:20.180> did<00:07:20.330> a<00:07:20.360> good<00:07:20.569> job<00:07:20.629> at<00:07:21.110> that<00:07:21.309> but

00:07:22.299 --> 00:07:22.309 
I think she did a good job at that but

00:07:22.309 --> 00:07:25.329 
I think she did a good job at that but
the<00:07:22.669> story<00:07:22.999> is<00:07:23.240> too<00:07:24.080> full<00:07:24.469> of<00:07:24.499> red<00:07:24.860> herrings

00:07:25.329 --> 00:07:25.339 
the story is too full of red herrings

00:07:25.339 --> 00:07:27.790 
the story is too full of red herrings
and<00:07:25.759> in<00:07:26.029> my<00:07:26.210> opinion<00:07:26.360> that<00:07:27.169> made<00:07:27.379> the<00:07:27.559> wrap-up

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:27.800 
and in my opinion that made the wrap-up

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.670 
and in my opinion that made the wrap-up
of<00:07:28.159> the<00:07:28.279> mystery<00:07:28.759> needlessly<00:07:29.360> long<00:07:29.809> I<00:07:30.199> give

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:30.680 
of the mystery needlessly long I give

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:33.639 
of the mystery needlessly long I give

this book two and a half stars out of

00:07:33.649 --> 00:07:35.649 
this book two and a half stars out of
five<00:07:33.919> but<00:07:34.639> I<00:07:34.729> want<00:07:34.879> to<00:07:34.939> make<00:07:35.029> this<00:07:35.149> clear<00:07:35.449> I
