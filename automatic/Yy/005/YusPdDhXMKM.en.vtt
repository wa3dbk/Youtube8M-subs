00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.179
 Hello everyone I'm from +6 basket begin 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:14.560
 in an orchestra there are many people there 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.290
 many musicians but there is a very 

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.730
 important that of the director this is 

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:21.070
 responsible for directing the entire team 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.900
 Check that there are no faults and always 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.330
 is controlling the times in the 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.990
 Basketball is exactly the same there 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.330
 a player 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.430
 the so-called base that controls the team 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.320
 inside the track this is also the 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.780
 in charge of directing his colleagues and 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.580
 mark the plays and you do not have to 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.680
 the base is the best player in the 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:41.199
 team but it does have to be one of 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.059
 the most important players the role that 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:44.920
 has is very significant for the 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:47.170
 team when the game is underway 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.030
 and he acts like another coach 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.070
 the French are used to being 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.320
 very smart players and that 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.180
 they understand basketball very well is very 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.940
 important that there is a good relationship 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.680
 between the coach and the mars because 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.600
 but the results the end of 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.390
 season will not be too good 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.490
 It is also important that they know 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.310
 communicate very well and above all that it 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.560
 understand imagine you are the general 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.510
 managers of a franchise and that you are 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.450
 making a team 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:19.510
 and they are bases as you know there are many 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.370
 base types are not all the same I 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.530
 I have made a classification to 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:25.720
 next to explain is each type of 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.390
 base and in the end choose one saying 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.250
 because this is better than the others 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.020
 I would like you also in the 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.570
 comments from youtube leave them a 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:38.220
 comment saying what would be our 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.220
 ideal base type for your equipment 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.680
 the director base the classic one of all 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.650
 life like for example John Stockton 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:50.020
 steve nash and jason kidd are players 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.030
 who can score are very good but 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.280
 that its main function and its main 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.800
 objective is to pass is to facilitate 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.479
 the baskets not because it is what the 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.370
 coach but because it comes out of them 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:03.340
 they are players who have 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:05.680
 Makeup always give helpful parts 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.300
 a lot in team and do not try just for 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.570
 they but for the team are about 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:13.030
 really amazing players and in addition 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.830
 they are very intelligent they know how to read very well 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.830
 the game and know how to make decisions 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.330
 correct as for example in a moment 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.550
 it will be better to make a pique 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.680
 and pass the ball to the pivot to throw a 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:28.090
 triple or give a pass in the back 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:29.770
 to surprise the base defender 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.930
 annotator as indicated by the name 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:34.240
 collapse that is very easy 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.460
 to kill you do not have to have a 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.290
 great physicist but what it does have is a 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:40.450
 great ease either from the line of 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.270
 triple from half distance doing 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.640
 trays the advantages is that you have a 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.830
 possible player franchise a player 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.390
 that assures you a minimum of points but 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.330
 the disadvantages and I believe with a 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:55.060
 important disadvantage is that it loses is 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.920
 a function of the typical basis the selection 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.590
 of the base that organizes the team shoots 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:02.290
 you pass and maybe it's not too good 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.360
 have some kind of foundation that only 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.160
 center in scoring but good some 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.730
 teams have it and the truth is not 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.730
 they work badly 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.250
 triplist base can also organize and 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.890
 direct a team but not its main 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.690
 advantage their strong point are the triples 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.269
 on a basis that if you have it on the computer 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.610
 will assure you for example minimum three 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:26.150
 triples although you should keep in mind that 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.290
 maybe it does not exceed five assists 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.690
 depending on the project you have in 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.310
 mind a triplist base can be a 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.200
 great addition for your team 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:37.019
 for example the Cleveland Cavaliers 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.879
 are based on falling irving is a 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:41.040
 good triplist and he usually creates well his 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:43.260
 promised in the facet of giving 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.959
 assists in giving passes still has 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.180
 a lot of room for improvement but this is not 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.620
 a big problem because you have a lebron 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.420
 james came in here for a player who 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.790
 it is also to stay as base distributes 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:58.709
 many assists and supplies this lack 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:04:01.590
 to fall and maybe for your team 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:04.440
 you prefer from a high base the bases 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.510
 are between the 85 meter and the two 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.280
 meters we could say but there are others 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:12.420
 cases such as magic 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:15.030
 johnson my base 2 meters 6 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:18.090
 You ask for many advantages, for example if 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:20.340
 the base plays with his back to the area and 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.350
 start posting on another base if the 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.090
 party has little to do 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.040
 for example more division sos when 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.860
 eat with your back against another advance 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:30.150
 will feel variation hooks and the others 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.850
 what basis they could do absolutely 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.550
 nothing that is very important that if 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:37.080
 you have a base with these characteristics 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:40.700
 It has to be fast and agile because if not 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.700
 in defense, it can be very bad 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:45.990
 the defense base knows how to direct and 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:48.300
 organize a team but in attack not 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:50.729
 Highlight too much you will not give too many 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:53.310
 points but in defense it's a real 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:55.380
 show presses a lot defends very 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:57.060
 well and recover many balls 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.400
 It is a real nightmare for your 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.620
 rivals and that 's a big advantage for 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.960
 your team because if the final base is 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.530
 feels uncomfortable that will hurt everyone 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.530
 The types 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:13.229
 and finally I wanted to highlight the base 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:15.960
 physical at the all-terrain bat so that 

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:17.729
 you understand russell westbrook a player 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.009
 for a spectacular physicist is a 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:22.400
 authentic first 

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:24.409
 this base that will score many cults and 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.569
 rebound assault players 

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:29.029
 spectacular to plug all this 

00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:31.460
 grace the physicists but of course we return 

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:34.029
 again with the same thing from before the subject 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:36.649
 of the typical basis of distributing assists 

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:39.949
 there is practically no this type of more 

00:05:36.649 --> 00:05:42.889
 you throw a lot will also fail but that 

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:44.839
 if it will assure you many points and have 

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:47.029
 a very good thing if I was to motivate 

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:49.309
 very well to your colleagues and you can go 

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:51.020
 losing of 30 points that is based 

00:05:49.309 --> 00:05:53.719
 continue fighting will continue to run 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:55.909
 because they will do it jumping and that's a 

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:57.110
 which helps a lot the mood 

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:59.120
 of the team 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:01.279
 for example russell westbrook always 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:03.139
 he is fighting and his companions 

00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:05.089
 when they see that their base is giving it 

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:07.039
 everything is being thrown by each ball 

00:06:05.089 --> 00:06:09.080
 is jumping more than anyone they 

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:11.120
 they also go in a good model in a good 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:13.879
 model to stay motivated and also 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.529
 to win and now comes the time to 

00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:17.930
 the truth when the owner of the 

00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:20.209
 team tells you what kind of more you 

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:23.120
 you want to save from a pothole tripis is 

00:06:20.209 --> 00:06:24.680
 a physical base a defensive blip on me 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:27.380
 opinion I choose 

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:29.810
 to a director base are some bases that I 

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:32.210
 they love transmit a lot of confidence and 

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:33.919
 they are very smart, they also know how to take 

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:36.979
 the right decisions 

00:06:33.919 --> 00:06:38.509
 for example steve nash and jason kidd john 

00:06:36.979 --> 00:06:41.840
 stockton among others 

00:06:38.509 --> 00:06:43.430
 you with whom you stay I do not know this 

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:46.190
 I want you to tell me here below 

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:47.840
 it's explained if you want to also 

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:49.370
 you can put I want a triplist base 

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:51.889
 but if you can extend a little more 

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:54.590
 I would really appreciate it and this has 

00:06:51.889 --> 00:06:56.389
 been everything I hope you liked it 

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:57.949
 I would appreciate very much to share six of 

00:06:56.389 --> 00:07:00.530
