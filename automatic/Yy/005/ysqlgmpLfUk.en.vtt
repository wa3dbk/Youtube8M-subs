00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
we're going to look for any little globs

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:43.580 
we're going to look for any little globs
or<00:03:36.040> imperfections<00:03:37.049> and<00:03:38.049> just<00:03:38.409> very<00:03:38.709> lightly

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:49.530 

sand<00:03:44.590> it<00:03:47.310> so<00:03:48.310> it<00:03:48.430> has<00:03:48.610> a<00:03:48.640> uniform<00:03:49.360> you<00:03:49.510> don't

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
sand it so it has a uniform you don't

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.080 
sand it so it has a uniform you don't
want<00:03:49.780> to<00:03:49.870> send<00:03:50.079> it<00:03:50.230> too<00:03:50.410> hard<00:03:50.739> you<00:03:51.489> sand<00:03:51.790> it<00:03:51.879> too

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
want to send it too hard you sand it too

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:53.280 
want to send it too hard you sand it too
hard<00:03:52.420> you're<00:03:52.599> going<00:03:52.720> to<00:03:52.810> get<00:03:52.930> rid<00:03:53.110> of<00:03:53.140> the

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
hard you're going to get rid of the

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.740 
hard you're going to get rid of the
texture<00:03:53.829> and<00:03:54.040> the<00:03:54.640> texture<00:03:55.000> is<00:03:55.239> the<00:03:55.269> most

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
texture and the texture is the most

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.650 
texture and the texture is the most
important<00:03:56.379> part<00:03:57.129> of<00:03:57.280> this<00:03:57.459> because<00:03:58.090> if<00:03:58.450> you

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
important part of this because if you

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.690 
important part of this because if you
stand<00:03:58.900> down<00:03:59.170> texture<00:03:59.799> it's<00:04:00.069> like<00:04:00.310> you<00:04:00.489> didn't

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
stand down texture it's like you didn't

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.900 
stand down texture it's like you didn't
even<00:04:00.790> just<00:04:01.120> on<00:04:01.299> the<00:04:01.329> board<00:04:01.629> and<00:04:01.989> we<00:04:02.769> are<00:04:03.010> going

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910 
even just on the board and we are going

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:11.410 
even just on the board and we are going
to<00:04:04.060> do<00:04:04.209> it<00:04:04.680> vertically

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420

even though streaks we are done with the

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:29.670 
even though streaks we are done with the

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
intermission number two el pasaje so you

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.940 
intermission number two el pasaje so you
start<00:04:37.880> off<00:04:37.970> here<00:04:38.210> right

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:39.950 
start off here right

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.810 
start off here right
then<00:04:40.490> you<00:04:40.640> move<00:04:40.850> slowly

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:42.820 
then you move slowly

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:47.460 
then you move slowly
hey<00:04:43.330> we're<00:04:43.600> back<00:04:43.780> and<00:04:45.870> check<00:04:46.870> and<00:04:47.020> see<00:04:47.080> if<00:04:47.320> it's

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
hey we're back and check and see if it's

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:52.410 
hey we're back and check and see if it's
fry<00:04:49.500> very<00:04:50.500> nice<00:04:50.770> it's<00:04:51.160> not<00:04:51.460> cool<00:04:51.820> to<00:04:51.850> the<00:04:52.150> touch

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:52.420 
fry very nice it's not cool to the touch

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:58.010 
fry very nice it's not cool to the touch
and<00:04:53.670> it<00:04:54.670> looks<00:04:54.910> like<00:04:55.030> we're<00:04:55.390> ready<00:04:55.570> for<00:04:55.690> our

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
and it looks like we're ready for our

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.780 
and it looks like we're ready for our
second<00:04:59.020> inspection<00:05:00.480> check<00:05:01.480> if<00:05:01.690> there<00:05:01.900> are<00:05:01.930> any

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:02.790 
second inspection check if there are any

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:07.830 
second inspection check if there are any
imperfections<00:05:03.790> anywhere<00:05:06.570> remember<00:05:07.570> you<00:05:07.660> want

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 
imperfections anywhere remember you want

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 
to do this when it's dry you don't want

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.850 
to do this when it's dry you don't want
to<00:05:09.460> do<00:05:09.610> this<00:05:09.820> when<00:05:10.090> it's<00:05:10.270> wet<00:05:10.740> because<00:05:11.740> when

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
to do this when it's wet because when

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.350 
to do this when it's wet because when
it's<00:05:12.010> wet<00:05:12.280> you're<00:05:12.490> just<00:05:12.640> going<00:05:12.820> to<00:05:12.850> tear<00:05:13.180> up

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
it's wet you're just going to tear up

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.570 
it's wet you're just going to tear up
the<00:05:13.390> surface<00:05:13.750> and<00:05:14.740> you<00:05:14.920> might<00:05:15.100> as<00:05:15.190> well<00:05:15.340> just

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.580 
the surface and you might as well just

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:25.510 
the surface and you might as well just
you<00:05:16.120> know<00:05:16.270> start<00:05:16.750> over<00:05:20.640> it's<00:05:21.640> very<00:05:21.940> nice

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.610 

a<00:05:25.580> little<00:05:26.000> bit<00:05:26.150> more

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
a little bit more

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:31.560 
a little bit more
now<00:05:28.630> why<00:05:29.710> do<00:05:30.710> you<00:05:30.800> think<00:05:31.100> we're<00:05:31.310> doing

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:31.570 
now why do you think we're doing

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:35.320 
now why do you think we're doing
vertical<00:05:32.570> horizontal<00:05:32.950> vertical<00:05:34.120> so<00:05:35.120> if<00:05:35.240> a

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:35.330 
vertical horizontal vertical so if a

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:37.030 
vertical horizontal vertical so if a
crisscross<00:05:35.690> and<00:05:36.320> the<00:05:36.380> reason<00:05:36.650> why<00:05:36.800> you<00:05:36.920> want

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:37.040 
crisscross and the reason why you want

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.370 
crisscross and the reason why you want
to<00:05:37.160> do<00:05:37.250> a<00:05:37.280> crisscross<00:05:37.670> is<00:05:38.210> you<00:05:38.930> want<00:05:39.140> to<00:05:39.230> make

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:39.380 
to do a crisscross is you want to make

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:45.240 
to do a crisscross is you want to make
sure<00:05:39.410> that<00:05:40.070> you<00:05:40.540> cover<00:05:41.540> every<00:05:42.380> area<00:05:42.710> of<00:05:44.230> the

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:45.250 
sure that you cover every area of the

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:48.820 
sure that you cover every area of the
panel<00:05:46.250> itself<00:05:46.670> if<00:05:47.060> we're<00:05:47.840> just<00:05:48.140> doing<00:05:48.290> it<00:05:48.650> up

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:48.830 
panel itself if we're just doing it up

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:51.640 
panel itself if we're just doing it up
and<00:05:49.070> down<00:05:49.220> up<00:05:49.400> and<00:05:49.550> down<00:05:49.720> maybe<00:05:50.720> the<00:05:51.290> way<00:05:51.440> our

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:51.650 
and down up and down maybe the way our

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:53.770 
and down up and down maybe the way our
hands<00:05:52.280> go<00:05:52.610> or<00:05:53.030> maybe<00:05:53.330> there's<00:05:53.630> an

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:53.780 
hands go or maybe there's an

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:57.760 
hands go or maybe there's an
imperfection<00:05:54.200> in<00:05:55.070> the<00:05:55.630> actual<00:05:56.630> roller<00:05:57.020> you

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:57.770 
imperfection in the actual roller you

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:00.310 
imperfection in the actual roller you
could<00:05:58.100> get<00:05:58.460> maybe<00:05:59.150> a<00:05:59.360> pattern<00:05:59.900> you<00:06:00.050> want<00:06:00.200> to

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:00.320 
could get maybe a pattern you want to

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.830 
could get maybe a pattern you want to
make<00:06:00.440> sure<00:06:00.470> there<00:06:00.830> are<00:06:00.950> no<00:06:01.130> patterns<00:06:01.640> in<00:06:02.450> this

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:02.840 
make sure there are no patterns in this

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.410 
make sure there are no patterns in this
at<00:06:03.080> all<00:06:03.260> you<00:06:03.560> want<00:06:03.740> to<00:06:03.890> be<00:06:04.040> a<00:06:04.070> uniform<00:06:04.730> surface

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:05.420 
at all you want to be a uniform surface

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:08.650 
at all you want to be a uniform surface
you<00:06:06.140> want<00:06:06.350> to<00:06:06.560> have<00:06:06.710> a<00:06:06.740> uniform<00:06:07.370> texture<00:06:08.060> so

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:08.660 
you want to have a uniform texture so

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.290 
you want to have a uniform texture so
that's<00:06:08.840> why<00:06:09.110> you<00:06:10.040> know<00:06:10.220> the<00:06:10.370> sandpaper<00:06:10.850> comes

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:11.300 
that's why you know the sandpaper comes

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:14.380 
that's why you know the sandpaper comes
into<00:06:11.540> play<00:06:11.780> and<00:06:12.280> doing<00:06:13.280> it<00:06:13.580> one<00:06:13.790> way<00:06:14.000> then<00:06:14.360> the

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:14.390 
into play and doing it one way then the

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:18.910 
into play and doing it one way then the
other<00:06:14.510> then<00:06:15.050> the<00:06:15.440> other<00:06:15.890> way<00:06:16.250> okay<00:06:17.000> so<00:06:17.300> now<00:06:17.920> we

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:18.920 
other then the other way okay so now we

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:23.350 
other then the other way okay so now we
are<00:06:19.280> ready<00:06:19.640> for<00:06:20.030> our<00:06:20.090> final<00:06:20.990> coat<00:06:21.230> and<00:06:22.120> you<00:06:23.120> can

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:23.360 
are ready for our final coat and you can

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:28.200 
are ready for our final coat and you can
see<00:06:23.600> this<00:06:23.870> time<00:06:24.260> is<00:06:26.080> becoming<00:06:27.080> a<00:06:27.320> beautiful

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:28.210 
see this time is becoming a beautiful

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:34.740 
see this time is becoming a beautiful
opaque<00:06:29.230> white
