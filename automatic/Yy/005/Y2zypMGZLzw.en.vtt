is make sure you grab the right lish for
the<00:00:49.200> eye<00:00:49.230> so<00:00:50.010> this<00:00:50.280> one<00:00:50.489> as<00:00:50.820> you<00:00:51.000> can<00:00:51.030> see<00:00:51.210> is

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
the eye so this one as you can see is

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.029 
the eye so this one as you can see is
tape<00:00:51.930> it<00:00:51.960> on<00:00:52.289> this<00:00:52.530> end

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
tape it on this end

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.490 
tape it on this end
so<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.789> tapered<00:00:54.239> like<00:00:54.570> smaller<00:00:55.260> and

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
so the tapered like smaller and

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.470 
so the tapered like smaller and
obviously<00:00:55.949> it's<00:00:56.219> going<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:56.399> go<00:00:56.610> into<00:00:57.300> the

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
obviously it's going to go into the

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.869 
obviously it's going to go into the
inner<00:00:57.960> part<00:00:58.289> of<00:00:58.410> your<00:00:58.469> eye<00:00:58.649> you<00:00:59.489> just<00:00:59.670> want<00:00:59.820> to

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
line it up like this and kind of see how

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.299 
line it up like this and kind of see how
much<00:01:03.570> extra<00:01:04.049> heavy<00:01:04.409> you<00:01:04.589> may<00:01:04.710> not<00:01:04.890> have<00:01:05.040> any

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
much extra heavy you may not have any

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.390 
much extra heavy you may not have any
extra<00:01:05.640> but<00:01:06.260> most<00:01:07.260> of<00:01:07.380> us<00:01:07.500> will<00:01:07.680> need<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:08.040> trim<00:01:08.369> a

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
extra but most of us will need to trim a

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.520 
extra but most of us will need to trim a
little<00:01:08.580> bit<00:01:08.700> off<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.880> eating<00:01:09.210> so<00:01:09.450> once<00:01:10.380> you've

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
little bit off the eating so once you've

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.990 
little bit off the eating so once you've
measured<00:01:10.770> it<00:01:11.010> just<00:01:11.189> kind<00:01:11.369> of<00:01:11.400> chop<00:01:11.729> off<00:01:11.970> a

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
measured it just kind of chop off a

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.090 
measured it just kind of chop off a
little<00:01:12.330> bit<00:01:12.479> off<00:01:12.659> that<00:01:12.689> longer<00:01:13.290> end<00:01:13.560> it'll

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
little bit off that longer end it'll

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.530 
little bit off that longer end it'll
make<00:01:14.220> it<00:01:14.369> look<00:01:14.490> more<00:01:14.670> natural<00:01:14.729> rather<00:01:15.150> than<00:01:15.420> if

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
make it look more natural rather than if

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.590 
make it look more natural rather than if
you<00:01:15.659> cut<00:01:15.840> off<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.110> end<00:01:16.520> so<00:01:17.520> now<00:01:18.270> it's<00:01:18.450> like

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
you cut off the end so now it's like

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.539 
you cut off the end so now it's like
this<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.140> it's<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.500> much<00:01:19.680> better<00:01:19.920> fit<00:01:20.310> for<00:01:20.340> my

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
this and it's a much better fit for my

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.880 
this and it's a much better fit for my
eyelid<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.240> when<00:01:22.229> you're<00:01:22.350> measuring<00:01:22.650> you

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
eyelid and when you're measuring you

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.830 
eyelid and when you're measuring you
don't<00:01:23.100> want<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.400> start<00:01:23.670> this<00:01:24.299> is<00:01:24.479> like<00:01:24.630> from

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
don't want to start this is like from

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.240 
don't want to start this is like from
personal<00:01:24.869> experience<00:01:25.740> you<00:01:25.860> don't<00:01:26.040> want<00:01:26.159> to

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
start from way in here like that is if

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.469 
start from way in here like that is if
you<00:01:31.380> do<00:01:31.530> that<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:31.979> they're<00:01:32.880> going<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.060> be<00:01:33.150> too

sorry<00:03:38.320> it's<00:03:38.500> not<00:03:38.620> focusing<00:03:39.130> on<00:03:39.400> the<00:03:39.640> outer

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
sorry it's not focusing on the outer

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:41.699 
sorry it's not focusing on the outer
corners<00:03:40.450> because<00:03:40.780> that's<00:03:41.140> the<00:03:41.320> first<00:03:41.530> place

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
corners because that's the first place

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.190 
corners because that's the first place
that<00:03:41.830> it's<00:03:42.160> gonna<00:03:42.340> start<00:03:42.700> coming<00:03:43.330> off<00:03:43.570> if<00:03:43.930> it

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
that it's gonna start coming off if it

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:50.400 
that it's gonna start coming off if it
does<00:03:48.690> and<00:03:49.690> then<00:03:49.840> you're<00:03:49.959> going<00:03:50.050> to<00:03:50.140> have<00:03:50.230> your

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
does and then you're going to have your

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.080 
does and then you're going to have your
glue<00:03:50.650> on<00:03:50.920> the<00:03:51.100> lash<00:03:51.310> strip<00:03:51.459> but<00:03:51.700> just<00:03:51.940> like

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
glue on the lash strip but just like

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:53.820 
glue on the lash strip but just like
that<00:03:52.120> I<00:03:52.600> don't<00:03:52.930> really<00:03:53.170> worry<00:03:53.470> if<00:03:53.590> I<00:03:53.709> have<00:03:53.800> a

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:53.830 
that I don't really worry if I have a

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:55.979 
that I don't really worry if I have a
little<00:03:54.040> bit<00:03:54.130> underneath<00:03:54.400> it<00:03:54.820> kind<00:03:55.030> of<00:03:55.120> doesn't

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
little bit underneath it kind of doesn't

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:59.070 
little bit underneath it kind of doesn't
really<00:03:56.140> do<00:03:56.500> much<00:03:56.680> and<00:03:57.070> I<00:03:57.790> like<00:03:58.600> to<00:03:58.750> hold<00:03:58.959> it

00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.080 
really do much and I like to hold it

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.070 
really do much and I like to hold it
from<00:03:59.260> the<00:03:59.320> outer<00:03:59.620> corner<00:04:00.160> and<00:04:00.480> then<00:04:01.480> what<00:04:01.900> I<00:04:01.930> do

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:02.080 
from the outer corner and then what I do

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.870 
from the outer corner and then what I do
is<00:04:02.440> I<00:04:02.530> took<00:04:02.800> my<00:04:02.950> hair<00:04:03.130> right<00:04:03.250> back<00:04:03.459> so<00:04:03.640> you<00:04:03.730> can

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:03.880 
is I took my hair right back so you can

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.850 
now this is the part that's a lot easier

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:11.670 
now this is the part that's a lot easier

lashes<00:04:53.229> are<00:04:53.500> kind<00:04:53.650> of<00:04:53.710> curly<00:04:54.070> anyway<00:04:54.340> but<00:04:54.850> what

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
lashes are kind of curly anyway but what

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:56.999 
lashes are kind of curly anyway but what
I<00:04:55.060> like<00:04:55.300> to<00:04:55.449> use<00:04:55.630> these<00:04:55.840> for<00:04:55.900> is<00:04:56.229> to<00:04:56.590> squish<00:04:56.979> my

00:04:56.999 --> 00:04:57.009 
I like to use these for is to squish my

00:04:57.009 --> 00:04:58.589 
I like to use these for is to squish my
natural<00:04:57.550> eye<00:04:57.669> lashes<00:04:57.850> with<00:04:58.090> the<00:04:58.120> fake<00:04:58.360> ones

00:04:58.589 --> 00:04:58.599 
natural eye lashes with the fake ones

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:00.480 
natural eye lashes with the fake ones
and<00:04:58.870> bling<00:04:59.110> them<00:04:59.289> in<00:04:59.440> when<00:05:00.099> you're<00:05:00.190> doing<00:05:00.310> this

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
and bling them in when you're doing this

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.010 
and bling them in when you're doing this
you<00:05:00.639> want<00:05:00.820> to<00:05:00.849> be<00:05:00.940> very<00:05:00.970> gentle<00:05:01.449> if<00:05:01.840> you

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020 
you want to be very gentle if you

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.870 
you want to be very gentle if you
squeeze<00:05:02.650> too<00:05:02.830> hard<00:05:03.130> with<00:05:03.310> the<00:05:03.430> curler<00:05:03.669> you're

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880 
squeeze too hard with the curler you're

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.939 
squeeze too hard with the curler you're
probably<00:05:04.120> going<00:05:04.630> to<00:05:04.870> peel<00:05:05.229> off<00:05:05.470> the<00:05:05.650> eyelash

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:05.949 
probably going to peel off the eyelash

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:09.060 
probably going to peel off the eyelash
so<00:05:06.639> what<00:05:06.759> I<00:05:06.849> do<00:05:07.270> is<00:05:07.539> just<00:05:07.750> gently<00:05:07.990> pull<00:05:08.800> it<00:05:08.830> in

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.070 
so what I do is just gently pull it in

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:11.550 
so what I do is just gently pull it in
and<00:05:09.430> then<00:05:10.180> just<00:05:10.419> gently<00:05:10.720> do<00:05:11.050> a<00:05:11.080> couple<00:05:11.500> of

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560 
and then just gently do a couple of

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.710 
and then just gently do a couple of
little<00:05:11.770> squeezes<00:05:12.340> and<00:05:12.550> then<00:05:12.729> kind<00:05:13.120> of<00:05:13.210> pull

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:13.720 
little squeezes and then kind of pull

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.210 
little squeezes and then kind of pull
down<00:05:13.990> on<00:05:14.229> the<00:05:14.320> cooler<00:05:14.650> so<00:05:14.860> like<00:05:15.009> you're<00:05:15.130> not

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:15.220 
down on the cooler so like you're not

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:16.170 
down on the cooler so like you're not
putting<00:05:15.460> the<00:05:15.729> leashes

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.180 
putting the leashes

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:17.520 
putting the leashes
up<00:05:16.360> you'll<00:05:16.570> point<00:05:16.750> them<00:05:16.900> down<00:05:17.110> so<00:05:17.410> they<00:05:17.500> don't

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:17.530 
up you'll point them down so they don't

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.400 
up you'll point them down so they don't
peel<00:05:17.919> off<00:05:18.449> and<00:05:19.449> then<00:05:19.599> your<00:05:19.750> eyelashes<00:05:20.169> should

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.410 
peel off and then your eyelashes should

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:21.930 
peel off and then your eyelashes should
have<00:05:20.500> kind<00:05:20.770> of<00:05:20.889> moved<00:05:21.220> down<00:05:21.460> a<00:05:21.490> little<00:05:21.699> bit

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 
have kind of moved down a little bit

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:23.550 
have kind of moved down a little bit
like<00:05:22.150> drag<00:05:22.479> down<00:05:22.720> into<00:05:22.750> your<00:05:23.080> natural<00:05:23.440> lash

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 
like drag down into your natural lash

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.409 
like drag down into your natural lash
line<00:05:23.800> so<00:05:24.039> they're<00:05:24.610> really<00:05:24.849> nice<00:05:25.030> and<00:05:25.240> snug

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:25.419
