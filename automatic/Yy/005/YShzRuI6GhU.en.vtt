 speed and out and wash capacity of one 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:47.690
 up to and including 5 pounds and I have 5 pounds 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:51.670

 right cotton program 60 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.380
 degrees 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:08.330
 virtual tour and we cotton eco then 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.850
 the same program only it lasts 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.860
 Anything longer than that because it warms 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.600
 water cautious and used there 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.070
 in also less energy 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.320
 new balls as long as there have the 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.810
 daily experts actually just the 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.890
 daily washing programs than him it 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.080
 program 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.780
 dark textiles really for the dark ones 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.700
 clothing a special a washing program 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.850
 then have on the left top left 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.760
 the synthetic like program 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:37.280
 baby protect that is extra warm and also 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.740
 make extra rinses once everything makes 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.760
 naturally with bacteria and the 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.130
 pollution 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.630
 how beautiful the program should be 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.040
 always be careful with it 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.990
 but it is also true 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:51.530
 low temperatures 40 degrees and 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.840
 spin on only 600 rpm then 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.550
 have special hand wash programs 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.320
 for the clothes but the label is in 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.659
 which can only be done by hand 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.940
 washed have the mix 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:05.060
 40 is actually the nothing because both 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:07.909
 synthetic if you have cotton for the 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.050
 normal was then two separate functions 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:10.880
 so they are not 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.250
 washing programs that is it 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.220
 censoring and 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:20.920
 it is the bottom or bottom right 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:22.540
 market and rinse the times then 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.460
 we can do the regular washing programs too 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.740
 even more when there was of course one 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:29.350
 we can adjust the temperature ourselves 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:32.740
 you can make it colder 40 degrees 30 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:35.350
 degrees or the tap water temperature and 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:37.060
 even up to 90 degrees 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.770
 ok you can speed when at 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.980
 program set yourself fourteen hundred 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:44.350
 rpm 800 rpm 600 rpm or even in 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.120
 let the water stand in front of it 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.930
 lower program that is not 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.330
 centrifugation 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.410
 but pumping well for the extra 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.200
 contaminated wax 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.930
 you can also do the laundry again 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.100
 turn and we have of course 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.739
 a quick wash 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:02.620
 that is on purpose and if you have less 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:03.430
 also have time that has been delayed 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.330
 Start 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.530
