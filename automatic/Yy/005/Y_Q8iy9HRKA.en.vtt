00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
cleaning resin now you can use a variety

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.759 
cleaning resin now you can use a variety
of<00:01:02.670> things<00:01:03.270> acclaim<00:01:03.600> resin<00:01:03.960> but<00:01:04.140> if<00:01:04.439> you<00:01:04.619> can

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
pieces in a nice warm solution you can

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.050 
pieces in a nice warm solution you can
make<00:01:12.960> episode<00:01:13.619> same<00:01:14.040> process<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:14.670> then<00:01:14.760> brush

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
make episode same process and then brush

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.370 
make episode same process and then brush
it<00:01:15.090> off<00:01:15.299> it<00:01:16.020> does<00:01:16.229> work<00:01:16.520> but<00:01:18.080> I'm<00:01:19.080> not<00:01:19.320> very

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
it off it does work but I'm not very

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.890 
it off it does work but I'm not very
good<00:01:19.680> at<00:01:20.100> cleaning<00:01:20.310> resin<00:01:20.700> it<00:01:21.090> seems<00:01:21.360> every

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
good at cleaning resin it seems every

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.960 
good at cleaning resin it seems every
time<00:01:21.930> I<00:01:22.170> try<00:01:22.380> or<00:01:22.710> do<00:01:23.220> it<00:01:23.369> I<00:01:23.549> have<00:01:23.970> problems<00:01:24.390> but

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
time I try or do it I have problems but

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:27.999 
time I try or do it I have problems but
it<00:01:26.970> does<00:01:27.150> work

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.009 
it does work

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:32.800 
it does work
some<00:01:29.009> say<00:01:29.130> that<00:01:29.159> as<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:29.759> will

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.849 

that<00:01:33.810> being<00:01:33.960> said<00:01:34.170> let's<00:01:34.229> go<00:01:34.530> right<00:01:34.710> to

00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:34.859 
that being said let's go right to

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:37.700 
that being said let's go right to
stripping<00:01:35.250> paint<00:01:36.049> it's<00:01:37.049> a<00:01:37.200> concentrated

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
stripping paint it's a concentrated

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.490 
stripping paint it's a concentrated
solution<00:01:38.070> that<00:01:38.520> I<00:01:38.549> get<00:01:39.020> looks<00:01:40.020> like<00:01:40.170> this<00:01:40.350> have

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
solution that I get looks like this have

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.090 
solution that I get looks like this have
a<00:01:40.530> bottle

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
a bottle

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.990 
a bottle
so<00:01:42.469> with<00:01:43.469> that<00:01:43.590> concentrated<00:01:44.159> solution<00:01:44.579> you

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
so with that concentrated solution you

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.260 
so with that concentrated solution you
can<00:01:45.149> make<00:01:45.299> depending<00:01:46.140> on<00:01:46.439> dilution<00:01:47.039> the

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
can make depending on dilution the

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.209 
can make depending on dilution the
dilution<00:01:48.560> there<00:01:49.560> very<00:01:49.709> highly<00:01:49.860> down<00:01:50.069> the

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:50.219 
dilution there very highly down the

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:53.419 
dilution there very highly down the
dissolution<00:01:50.640> there<00:01:50.939> we<00:01:51.030> go<00:01:52.009> you<00:01:53.009> can<00:01:53.189> make

00:01:53.419 --> 00:01:53.429 
dissolution there we go you can make

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:56.090 
dissolution there we go you can make
upwards<00:01:53.759> of<00:01:53.819> ten<00:01:53.969> gallons<00:01:54.360> of<00:01:54.500> usable<00:01:55.500> cleaner

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
upwards of ten gallons of usable cleaner

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.929 
upwards of ten gallons of usable cleaner
from<00:01:56.399> this<00:01:56.549> bottle<00:01:56.850> supposedly<00:01:57.590> so<00:01:58.789> what<00:01:59.789> I<00:01:59.850> do

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
from this bottle supposedly so what I do

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.660 
from this bottle supposedly so what I do
is<00:02:00.590> you<00:02:01.590> could<00:02:01.770> use<00:02:01.950> it<00:02:02.069> straight<00:02:02.250> out<00:02:02.310> but<00:02:02.640> I

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
is you could use it straight out but I

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.160 
is you could use it straight out but I
consider<00:02:02.939> it<00:02:03.149> a<00:02:03.209> waste<00:02:03.390> is<00:02:03.659> too<00:02:03.810> concentrated

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
consider it a waste is too concentrated

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.600 
consider it a waste is too concentrated
I<00:02:05.060> put<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.149> model<00:02:06.329> in<00:02:06.829> spritz<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:07.950> area<00:02:08.250> with

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
I put the model in spritz the area with

it doesn't really harm the detail on the
model<00:05:24.830> either<00:05:25.070> so<00:05:25.400> you<00:05:25.460> want<00:05:25.580> to<00:05:25.670> worry<00:05:25.760> about

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:25.790 
model either so you want to worry about

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:31.750 
model either so you want to worry about
that<00:05:28.300> I'm<00:05:29.300> going<00:05:29.510> to<00:05:29.570> brush<00:05:29.720> it<00:05:29.930> and<00:05:30.580> then<00:05:31.580> my

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:31.760 
that I'm going to brush it and then my

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.520 
that I'm going to brush it and then my
notice<00:05:32.060> marriage<00:05:32.330> being<00:05:32.480> stubborn<00:05:32.750> I'm<00:05:33.290> going

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:33.530 
notice marriage being stubborn I'm going

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:35.560 
notice marriage being stubborn I'm going
to<00:05:33.590> let<00:05:33.680> it<00:05:33.770> soak<00:05:33.950> some<00:05:34.190> more<00:05:34.400> come<00:05:35.090> back<00:05:35.300> brush

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:35.570 
to let it soak some more come back brush

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:37.690 
to let it soak some more come back brush
it<00:05:35.780> it's<00:05:36.530> not<00:05:36.590> the<00:05:36.740> quickest<00:05:37.100> solution<00:05:37.190> I

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:37.700 
it it's not the quickest solution I

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:41.080 
it it's not the quickest solution I
think<00:05:38.150> I<00:05:38.330> saw<00:05:38.570> somebody<00:05:38.840> use<00:05:39.580> like<00:05:40.580> a<00:05:40.640> tumbler

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.090 
think I saw somebody use like a tumbler

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:45.280 
think I saw somebody use like a tumbler
full<00:05:41.840> of<00:05:41.930> this<00:05:42.050> stuff<00:05:43.300> tens<00:05:44.300> of<00:05:44.480> other<00:05:44.540> things

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:45.290 
full of this stuff tens of other things

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:48.100 
full of this stuff tens of other things
a<00:05:45.470> tumble<00:05:45.770> with<00:05:45.890> it<00:05:46.420> or<00:05:47.420> for<00:05:47.660> some<00:05:47.900> type<00:05:48.080> of

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:48.110 
a tumble with it or for some type of

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:50.050 
a tumble with it or for some type of
solution<00:05:48.890> I<00:05:49.160> don't<00:05:49.310> know<00:05:49.430> I<00:05:49.640> don't<00:05:49.970> have

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.060 
solution I don't know I don't have

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.240 
solution I don't know I don't have
anything<00:05:50.330> fancy<00:05:50.810> so<00:05:51.230> I<00:05:51.260> just<00:05:51.560> do<00:05:51.680> this<00:05:51.830> and<00:05:52.130> it

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:52.250 
anything fancy so I just do this and it

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:56.340 
anything fancy so I just do this and it
works<00:05:52.460> so<00:05:53.470> yeah<00:05:54.470> that's<00:05:55.070> pretty<00:05:55.340> much<00:05:55.460> it<00:05:55.580> and

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:56.350 
works so yeah that's pretty much it and

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:59.230 
works so yeah that's pretty much it and
what<00:05:57.350> this<00:05:57.620> model<00:05:57.890> had<00:05:58.610> several<00:05:58.940> layers<00:05:59.120> of

00:05:59.230 --> 00:05:59.240 
what this model had several layers of

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.420 
what this model had several layers of
paint<00:05:59.420> on<00:05:59.540> and<00:05:59.690> had<00:05:59.810> a<00:05:59.840> black<00:06:00.110> base<00:06:00.350> coat<00:06:00.430> dark

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:01.430 
paint on and had a black base coat dark

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:03.580 
paint on and had a black base coat dark
equals<00:06:01.730> green<00:06:01.940> a<00:06:02.330> few<00:06:02.840> layers<00:06:02.990> of<00:06:03.110> that<00:06:03.320> I

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:03.590 
equals green a few layers of that I

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:04.960 
equals green a few layers of that I
didn't<00:06:03.950> really<00:06:04.070> highlight<00:06:04.520> it<00:06:04.640> because<00:06:04.700> I

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:04.970 
didn't really highlight it because I

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:08.800 
didn't really highlight it because I
didn't<00:06:05.360> do<00:06:05.480> that<00:06:05.510> one<00:06:05.750> in<00:06:05.840> my<00:06:05.990> dark<00:06:06.200> angels<00:06:07.810> but

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:08.810 
didn't do that one in my dark angels but

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:11.680 
didn't do that one in my dark angels but
uh<00:06:09.010> like<00:06:10.010> the<00:06:10.130> POV<00:06:10.340> seal<00:06:10.610> has<00:06:10.910> build<00:06:11.420> up<00:06:11.570> a

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:11.690 
uh like the POV seal has build up a

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:13.660 
uh like the POV seal has build up a
couple<00:06:12.410> layers<00:06:12.680> of<00:06:12.890> different<00:06:12.950> colors<00:06:13.430> and

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:13.670 
couple layers of different colors and

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:17.670 
couple layers of different colors and
then<00:06:14.030> it<00:06:14.090> was<00:06:14.210> matte<00:06:14.420> varnish<00:06:15.050> sealed<00:06:15.560> and<00:06:15.850> I

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:17.680 
then it was matte varnish sealed and I

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.020 
then it was matte varnish sealed and I
just<00:06:18.680> let<00:06:18.800> it<00:06:18.830> sit<00:06:19.070> in<00:06:19.100> the<00:06:19.250> solution<00:06:19.670> for<00:06:20.000> a

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:20.030 
just let it sit in the solution for a

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:21.730 
just let it sit in the solution for a
while<00:06:20.180> for<00:06:20.360> 24<00:06:20.720> hours<00:06:20.990> that<00:06:21.110> is<00:06:21.260> coming<00:06:21.560> right

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:21.740 
while for 24 hours that is coming right

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.460 
while for 24 hours that is coming right
off<00:06:22.120> also<00:06:23.120> I<00:06:23.300> noticed<00:06:23.780> with<00:06:23.870> Zappa<00:06:24.140> death

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:24.470 
off also I noticed with Zappa death

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:28.600 
off also I noticed with Zappa death
especially<00:06:24.680> um<00:06:25.900> it<00:06:26.900> weakens<00:06:27.890> the<00:06:28.070> bond<00:06:28.280> of<00:06:28.520> the

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:28.610 
especially um it weakens the bond of the

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:31.510 
especially um it weakens the bond of the
glue<00:06:29.060> so<00:06:29.930> pieces<00:06:30.350> kind<00:06:30.770> of<00:06:30.920> fall<00:06:31.100> apart<00:06:31.160> or

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:31.520 
glue so pieces kind of fall apart or

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.700 
glue so pieces kind of fall apart or
we'll<00:06:31.670> be<00:06:31.790> more<00:06:32.420> susceptible<00:06:32.720> is<00:06:33.170> coming

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:33.710 
we'll be more susceptible is coming

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:35.440 
we'll be more susceptible is coming
apart<00:06:34.010> because<00:06:34.460> the<00:06:34.670> glue<00:06:34.820> is<00:06:34.940> been<00:06:35.090> weakened

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:35.450 
apart because the glue is been weakened

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:39.100 
apart because the glue is been weakened
so<00:06:36.170> I<00:06:36.230> suggest<00:06:36.940> where<00:06:37.940> you're<00:06:38.600> able<00:06:38.900> to<00:06:38.930> do

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:39.110 
so I suggest where you're able to do

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:41.170 
so I suggest where you're able to do
without<00:06:39.500> really<00:06:39.770> causing<00:06:40.250> a<00:06:40.370> big<00:06:40.520> problem<00:06:41.000> or

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:41.180 
without really causing a big problem or

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.570 
without really causing a big problem or
making<00:06:41.510> it<00:06:41.600> look<00:06:41.660> too<00:06:41.720> time-consuming<00:06:42.520> like<00:06:43.520> I

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:43.580 
making it look too time-consuming like I

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:45.220 
making it look too time-consuming like I
broke<00:06:43.760> the<00:06:43.880> backpack<00:06:44.240> off<00:06:44.420> myself<00:06:44.780> just<00:06:45.050> break

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:45.230 
broke the backpack off myself just break

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:48.460 
broke the backpack off myself just break
certain<00:06:45.440> parts<00:06:45.830> off<00:06:46.660> and<00:06:47.660> that<00:06:48.050> way<00:06:48.170> you<00:06:48.230> don't

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:48.470 
certain parts off and that way you don't

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:49.660 
certain parts off and that way you don't
have<00:06:48.560> to<00:06:48.680> worry<00:06:48.830> about<00:06:48.890> just<00:06:49.220> falling<00:06:49.430> apart

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:49.670 
have to worry about just falling apart

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:52.840 
have to worry about just falling apart

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:02.180 
that way so that's pretty much it that's

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:04.150

how<00:07:02.360> I<00:07:02.390> strip<00:07:03.290> paint<00:07:03.470> I'm<00:07:03.680> sure<00:07:03.860> that<00:07:04.040> was

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:04.160 
how I strip paint I'm sure that was

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:07.630 
how I strip paint I'm sure that was
boring<00:07:04.640> enough<00:07:04.790> for<00:07:05.030> you<00:07:05.180> and<00:07:05.950> hopefully<00:07:06.950> you

find other ways but I like these simple
