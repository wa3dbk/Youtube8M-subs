think 9.5 maybe but what this does about

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.969 
think 9.5 maybe but what this does about
9.6<00:01:22.939> because<00:01:23.939> if<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:25.020> buying<00:01:25.290> players<00:01:25.619> and

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
9.6 because if you buying players and

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.890 
9.6 because if you buying players and
you<00:01:26.280> list<00:01:26.520> them<00:01:26.640> up<00:01:26.790> overnight<00:01:27.119> list<00:01:27.689> them<00:01:27.810> up
