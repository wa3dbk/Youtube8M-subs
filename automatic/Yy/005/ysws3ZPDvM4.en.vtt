at<00:01:48.530> any<00:01:48.590> given<00:01:48.980> time<00:01:49.160> and<00:01:51.220> that's<00:01:52.220> intended<00:01:52.610> to

at any given time and that's intended to

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.440 
at any given time and that's intended to
kind<00:01:53.120> of<00:01:53.240> give<00:01:53.870> the<00:01:54.110> shell<00:01:54.380> scripts<00:01:54.890> a<00:01:55.450> heads

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
kind of give the shell scripts a heads

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.240 
kind of give the shell scripts a heads
up<00:01:56.690> as<00:01:56.870> to<00:01:56.900> what's<00:01:57.350> happening<00:01:57.620> within<00:01:58.100> the

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
up as to what's happening within the

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.090 
up as to what's happening within the
minecraft<00:01:58.820> server<00:01:59.200> so<00:02:00.200> why<00:02:00.500> don't<00:02:00.680> we<00:02:00.770> go<00:02:00.920> into

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
minecraft server so why don't we go into

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.140 
minecraft server so why don't we go into
the<00:02:01.280> shell<00:02:01.520> scripts<00:02:01.880> and<00:02:02.090> see<00:02:02.360> how<00:02:03.940> see<00:02:04.940> how<00:02:05.090> to

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
the shell scripts and see how see how to

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:10.020 
the shell scripts and see how see how to
interact<00:02:05.540> with<00:02:06.020> this<00:02:06.290> functionality<00:02:07.220> here<00:02:08.770> so

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
interact with this functionality here so

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.930 
interact with this functionality here so
currently<00:02:11.030> the<00:02:11.390> official<00:02:12.340> VMS<00:02:13.340> server<00:02:13.610> is

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
currently the official VMS server is

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.110 
currently the official VMS server is
running<00:02:14.420> off<00:02:14.750> of<00:02:14.780> these<00:02:15.280> three<00:02:16.280> shell<00:02:16.760> scripts

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
running off of these three shell scripts

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.430 
running off of these three shell scripts
run<00:02:17.510> start<00:02:18.320> and<00:02:18.650> start<00:02:19.340> to<00:02:19.610> and<00:02:20.440> your

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
run start and start to and your

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.680 
run start and start to and your
something<00:02:21.770> interact<00:02:22.280> we<00:02:22.760> have<00:02:22.880> a<00:02:23.030> script<00:02:23.420> pet

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
something interact we have a script pet

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.400 
something interact we have a script pet
here<00:02:24.760> may<00:02:25.760> change<00:02:26.060> director<00:02:26.630> here<00:02:27.140> obviously

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
here may change director here obviously

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.150 
here may change director here obviously
this<00:02:27.890> will<00:02:28.070> all<00:02:28.310> be<00:02:28.490> different<00:02:29.000> for<00:02:30.160> your

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
this will all be different for your

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.220 
this will all be different for your
specific<00:02:31.750> server

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.020 

so<00:02:35.860> it<00:02:35.980> comes<00:02:36.159> in<00:02:36.340> here<00:02:36.670> it<00:02:37.120> creates<00:02:37.510> a<00:02:37.690> screen

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
so it comes in here it creates a screen

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.110 
so it comes in here it creates a screen
called<00:02:40.030> MCD<00:02:40.720> MS

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.390 

and<00:02:43.239> it<00:02:43.690> runs<00:02:43.930> the<00:02:44.319> start<00:02:44.739> script<00:02:45.159> in<00:02:45.340> that

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
and it runs the start script in that

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.440 
and it runs the start script in that
screen<00:02:46.090> so<00:02:46.959> this<00:02:47.110> is<00:02:47.260> kind<00:02:47.470> of<00:02:47.500> like<00:02:47.650> how<00:02:48.450> your
