00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
the card because I realized it's

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.340 
the card because I realized it's
annoying<00:01:00.000> for<00:01:00.210> people<00:01:00.510> if<00:01:00.630> they're<00:01:00.810> trying<00:01:01.110> to

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.179 
concentrate on the jewel and it is very
distracting<00:01:04.290> especially<00:01:04.350> when<00:01:04.710> someone<00:01:05.009> is

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
distracting especially when someone is

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.160 
distracting especially when someone is
doing<00:01:05.489> it<00:01:05.759> like<00:01:05.909> really<00:01:06.180> really<00:01:06.509> forcefully

something<00:01:09.390> okay<00:01:09.750> luckily<00:01:10.710> I<00:01:10.800> haven't<00:01:11.010> really

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.190 
something okay luckily I haven't really

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:12.649

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
but I do realize it annoys a lot of

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.800 
but I do realize it annoys a lot of
people<00:01:14.490> especially<00:01:14.820> when<00:01:15.210> people<00:01:15.479> fun<00:01:15.690> out

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
people especially when people fun out

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.540 
people especially when people fun out
there<00:01:15.840> graveyards<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.620> will<00:01:16.979> like<00:01:17.220> collect

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:17.550 
there graveyards and will like collect

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.460 
there graveyards and will like collect

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
or back up to a pile and fan out again

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.350 
or back up to a pile and fan out again
it's<00:01:19.950> like<00:01:20.190> that's<00:01:20.580> kind<00:01:20.880> of<00:01:21.090> time-wasting

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
it's like that's kind of time-wasting

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
interact in it the modern up because I

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.600 
interact in it the modern up because I
don't<00:02:19.750> see<00:02:19.959> the<00:02:20.080> reason<00:02:20.230> why<00:02:20.620> I<00:02:20.650> should<00:02:21.129> their

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
don't see the reason why I should their

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.360 
don't see the reason why I should their
attitudes<00:02:22.510> are<00:02:22.690> just<00:02:22.870> so<00:02:23.049> bad<00:02:23.319> it's<00:02:23.799> just

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
attitudes are just so bad it's just

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:25.860 
attitudes are just so bad it's just
really<00:02:24.580> annoyed<00:02:24.879> me<00:02:24.909> but<00:02:25.239> luckily<00:02:25.420> I<00:02:25.599> don't

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
really annoyed me but luckily I don't

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.600 
really annoyed me but luckily I don't
run<00:02:25.989> into<00:02:26.140> many<00:02:26.260> of<00:02:26.500> those<00:02:26.680> people<00:02:27.129> I<00:02:27.280> think

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
run into many of those people I think

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.550 
run into many of those people I think
most<00:02:27.909> then<00:02:28.150> kind<00:02:28.360> of<00:02:28.450> died<00:02:28.959> down<00:02:28.989> quickly

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
most then kind of died down quickly

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.199 
most then kind of died down quickly
because<00:02:30.069> they'll<00:02:30.340> get<00:02:30.489> shot<00:02:30.730> down<00:02:30.760> quite

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
because they'll get shot down quite

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.119 
because they'll get shot down quite
quickly<00:02:31.239> by<00:02:31.810> people<00:02:32.290> will<00:02:32.590> call<00:02:32.769> them<00:02:32.980> out<00:02:33.099> on

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:33.129 
quickly by people will call them out on

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:35.160 
quickly by people will call them out on
it<00:02:33.310> or<00:02:33.640> people<00:02:34.030> like<00:02:34.299> me<00:02:34.480> who<00:02:34.720> I<00:02:34.750> just<00:02:35.019> won't

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
it or people like me who I just won't

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.630 
it or people like me who I just won't
bother<00:02:35.379> with<00:02:35.620> them<00:02:35.799> and<00:02:36.099> then<00:02:36.340> they'll

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
bother with them and then they'll

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.369 
bother with them and then they'll
eventually<00:02:36.849> get<00:02:37.269> the<00:02:37.390> gist<00:02:37.599> of<00:02:37.690> it<00:02:37.810> as<00:02:38.019> to<00:02:38.200> why

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:38.379 
eventually get the gist of it as to why

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:40.559 
eventually get the gist of it as to why
so<00:02:38.799> it's<00:02:39.129> only<00:02:39.370> a<00:02:39.430> very<00:02:39.579> short<00:02:39.670> video<00:02:40.120> I<00:02:40.390> want
