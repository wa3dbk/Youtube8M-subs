 and in this research she discovered that the icasa index is she participated in India 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.279
 she moved there and like this research why is the inter below 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.129
 it's because she stole the consumption of cow's milk 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.370
 it's too low 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.890
 then she got what she did she threw everything that was from milk and derivatives other than the

 her feed 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:45.030
 novelli
