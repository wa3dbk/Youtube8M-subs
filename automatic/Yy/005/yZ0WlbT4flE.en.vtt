hi I'm Greg lava Dara I'm doing a little
video<00:00:03.570> series<00:00:04.049> all<00:00:04.319> about<00:00:04.380> what<00:00:04.920> we<00:00:05.100> in<00:00:05.220> the

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
video series all about what we in the

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.070 
video series all about what we in the
United<00:00:05.580> States<00:00:05.850> can<00:00:06.120> learn<00:00:06.359> about<00:00:06.629> house

United States can learn about house

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.140 
United States can learn about house
building<00:00:07.589> from<00:00:07.950> the<00:00:08.099> Swedish<00:00:08.519> housing

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
building from the Swedish housing

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.530 
building from the Swedish housing
industry<00:00:10.610> something<00:00:11.610> that's<00:00:11.759> become<00:00:12.000> very

industry something that's become very

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.430 
industry something that's become very
clear<00:00:13.080> is<00:00:13.290> that<00:00:14.040> we<00:00:14.849> need<00:00:15.059> to<00:00:15.240> improve<00:00:15.440> the

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
clear is that we need to improve the

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.870 
clear is that we need to improve the
energy<00:00:16.590> efficiency<00:00:16.830> of<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.430> houses<00:00:17.730> we're

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
energy efficiency of the houses we're

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.150 
energy efficiency of the houses we're
building<00:00:18.150> here<00:00:18.300> we<00:00:19.170> also<00:00:19.320> need<00:00:19.560> to<00:00:19.710> improve

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
building here we also need to improve

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.189 
building here we also need to improve
the<00:00:20.880> Whitney<00:00:21.330> efficiency<00:00:21.750> with<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:21.930> way<00:00:22.050> we

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
the Whitney efficiency with the way we

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.769 
the Whitney efficiency with the way we
build<00:00:22.500> houses<00:00:22.769> but<00:00:23.310> that's<00:00:24.180> another<00:00:24.390> question

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
build houses but that's another question

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.060 
build houses but that's another question
that<00:00:24.810> we're<00:00:25.080> not<00:00:25.199> going<00:00:25.350> to<00:00:25.410> tackle<00:00:25.619> right<00:00:25.920> now

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
that we're not going to tackle right now

my friend Scott hedges and I've spent

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.380 
my friend Scott hedges and I've spent
several<00:00:28.529> years<00:00:28.800> studying<00:00:29.550> house<00:00:30.029> building

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
several years studying house building

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.900 
several years studying house building
techniques<00:00:30.779> in<00:00:30.960> Sweden<00:00:31.410> we<00:00:32.130> think<00:00:32.399> that<00:00:32.640> they

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
techniques in Sweden we think that they

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.240 
techniques in Sweden we think that they
can<00:00:33.120> show<00:00:33.360> us<00:00:33.570> how<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.410> build<00:00:34.680> better<00:00:34.890> walls

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
can show us how to build better walls

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.280 
can show us how to build better walls
and<00:00:35.700> how<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.540> improve<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.989> energy

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
and how to improve the energy

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.220 
and how to improve the energy
performance<00:00:37.440> of<00:00:37.829> our<00:00:37.950> houses<00:00:38.370> here<00:00:38.700> so<00:00:39.230> let's

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
performance of our houses here so let's

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:48.950 
performance of our houses here so let's
take<00:00:40.410> a<00:00:40.469> look<00:00:40.590> at<00:00:40.710> why<00:00:46.789> so<00:00:47.789> why<00:00:47.969> what's<00:00:48.809> going

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
take a look at why so why what's going

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.139 
take a look at why so why what's going
on<00:00:49.079> in<00:00:49.200> Sweden<00:00:49.440> that<00:00:49.620> we<00:00:49.739> should<00:00:49.920> know<00:00:50.039> about

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:50.149 
on in Sweden that we should know about

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:52.520 
on in Sweden that we should know about
the<00:00:51.149> first<00:00:51.390> thing<00:00:51.570> you<00:00:51.660> should<00:00:51.690> know<00:00:52.050> is<00:00:52.320> that

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
the first thing you should know is that

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.610 
the first thing you should know is that
in<00:00:52.920> Sweden<00:00:53.309> they<00:00:53.789> build<00:00:54.059> wooden<00:00:54.300> houses<00:00:54.809> and

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
in Sweden they build wooden houses and

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.189 
in Sweden they build wooden houses and
that<00:00:55.680> seems<00:00:55.949> really<00:00:56.190> obvious<00:00:56.340> but<00:00:56.989> the<00:00:57.989> fact

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
that seems really obvious but the fact

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.689 
that seems really obvious but the fact
is<00:00:58.350> that<00:00:58.410> in<00:00:58.649> most<00:00:58.829> of<00:00:59.070> Europe<00:00:59.280> there's<00:00:59.609> a

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
is that in most of Europe there's a

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.209 
is that in most of Europe there's a
masonry<00:01:00.570> house<00:01:00.840> building<00:01:01.289> tradition<00:01:01.800> they

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
masonry house building tradition they

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.609 
masonry house building tradition they
build<00:01:02.460> house<00:01:02.609> out<00:01:02.820> of<00:01:02.850> stone<00:01:03.120> brick<00:01:03.690> but<00:01:04.530> in

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
build house out of stone brick but in

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.890 
build house out of stone brick but in
Sweden<00:01:04.860> that's<00:01:05.220> not<00:01:05.400> so<00:01:05.610> they<00:01:06.030> build<00:01:06.630> wood

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
Sweden that's not so they build wood

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.620 
Sweden that's not so they build wood
houses<00:01:07.310> here<00:01:08.310> in<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.430> United<00:01:08.640> States<00:01:08.909> we

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
houses here in the United States we

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.990 
houses here in the United States we
primarily<00:01:09.990> build<00:01:10.560> wood<00:01:10.890> houses<00:01:11.159> that's

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
primarily build wood houses that's

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.080 
primarily build wood houses that's
because<00:01:12.420> we<00:01:12.600> have<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:12.840> big<00:01:13.619> or<00:01:13.920> had<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.340> big

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
because we have a big or had a big

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.149 
because we have a big or had a big
timber<00:01:15.570> resource<00:01:15.990> Wood<00:01:16.619> is<00:01:16.830> readily

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
timber resource Wood is readily

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.190 
timber resource Wood is readily
available<00:01:17.340> it<00:01:17.939> makes<00:01:18.299> sense<00:01:18.540> that<00:01:18.689> we<00:01:18.960> build

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
available it makes sense that we build

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.010 
available it makes sense that we build
houses<00:01:19.860> of<00:01:20.159> wood<00:01:20.340> we<00:01:20.939> build<00:01:21.210> houses<00:01:21.810> out<00:01:21.930> of

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
houses of wood we build houses out of

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.010 
houses of wood we build houses out of
wood<00:01:22.259> studs<00:01:22.740> stud<00:01:23.460> being<00:01:23.759> small<00:01:24.479> dimension

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
wood studs stud being small dimension

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.080 
wood studs stud being small dimension
wood<00:01:25.170> members<00:01:26.390> Sweden<00:01:27.390> also<00:01:28.049> has<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:29.090> large

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
wood members Sweden also has a large

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.660 
wood members Sweden also has a large
timber<00:01:30.570> resource<00:01:31.070> relative<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.310> size<00:01:32.520> of

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
timber resource relative to the size of

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.690 
timber resource relative to the size of
the<00:01:32.729> country<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.420> a<00:01:34.280> well-managed<00:01:35.280> resource

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
the country and a well-managed resource

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.660 
the country and a well-managed resource
so<00:01:36.409> they<00:01:37.409> build<00:01:37.619> houses<00:01:37.770> of<00:01:38.040> wood<00:01:38.220> studs<00:01:38.520> as

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
so they build houses of wood studs as

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.639 
so they build houses of wood studs as
well<00:01:39.710> as<00:01:40.710> far<00:01:40.979> back<00:01:41.130> is<00:01:41.369> say<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.939> 1970<00:01:42.869> houses

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
well as far back is say the 1970 houses

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.139 
well as far back is say the 1970 houses
being<00:01:43.829> built<00:01:43.979> in<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.369> United<00:01:44.640> States<00:01:44.880> and

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
being built in the United States and

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.969 
being built in the United States and
houses<00:01:45.450> being<00:01:45.659> built<00:01:45.869> in<00:01:46.049> Sweden<00:01:46.200> were<00:01:46.710> very

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
houses being built in Sweden were very

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.880 
houses being built in Sweden were very
similar<00:01:47.600> same<00:01:48.600> kind<00:01:48.840> of<00:01:48.869> constructions<00:01:49.500> and

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
similar same kind of constructions and

kind of wood members same same kind of
business<00:01:53.360> so<00:01:54.470> in<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.619> 1970s<00:01:56.490> there<00:01:56.700> was<00:01:56.850> an

skyrocketed<00:02:09.500> so<00:02:10.500> here<00:02:10.679> in<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:10.830> United<00:02:11.069> States

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
skyrocketed so here in the United States

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.920 
skyrocketed so here in the United States
we<00:02:11.640> became<00:02:12.209> interested<00:02:12.780> in<00:02:12.870> solar<00:02:13.110> energies

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
we became interested in solar energies

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.140 
we became interested in solar energies
for<00:02:14.260> a<00:02:14.290> couple<00:02:14.680> of<00:02:14.799> years<00:02:14.950> perhaps<00:02:15.519> there<00:02:16.030> was

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
for a couple of years perhaps there was

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.569 
for a couple of years perhaps there was
some<00:02:16.360> initiative<00:02:16.870> to<00:02:17.709> do<00:02:17.860> solar-powered

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:18.579 
some initiative to do solar-powered

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:20.789 
some initiative to do solar-powered
houses<00:02:18.760> to<00:02:19.450> learn<00:02:19.629> about<00:02:19.810> how<00:02:20.379> we<00:02:20.439> would<00:02:20.650> do

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:20.799 
houses to learn about how we would do

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:23.309 
houses to learn about how we would do
that<00:02:20.829> it<00:02:21.760> turned<00:02:22.030> out<00:02:22.090> to<00:02:22.209> be<00:02:22.239> very<00:02:22.510> expensive

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
that it turned out to be very expensive

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:25.500 
that it turned out to be very expensive
we<00:02:23.470> went<00:02:23.769> back<00:02:24.069> to<00:02:24.430> building<00:02:24.879> houses<00:02:25.180> the<00:02:25.390> way

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
we went back to building houses the way

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.410 
we went back to building houses the way
we<00:02:25.659> always<00:02:25.810> did<00:02:26.280> so<00:02:27.280> even<00:02:27.489> that's<00:02:27.640> didn't<00:02:28.239> play

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
we always did so even that's didn't play

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.190 
we always did so even that's didn't play
out<00:02:28.569> like<00:02:28.720> that

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
out like that

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.710 
out like that
Sweden<00:02:29.769> made<00:02:30.250> a<00:02:30.280> concerted<00:02:30.670> effort<00:02:30.909> across

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
Sweden made a concerted effort across

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.539 
Sweden made a concerted effort across
the<00:02:31.989> entire<00:02:32.260> their<00:02:32.620> entire<00:02:32.920> housing<00:02:33.430> industry

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:33.549 
the entire their entire housing industry

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:35.580 
the entire their entire housing industry
to<00:02:34.000> change<00:02:34.269> the<00:02:34.420> way<00:02:34.540> they<00:02:34.689> built<00:02:34.870> houses<00:02:35.319> so

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
to change the way they built houses so

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.490 
to change the way they built houses so
for<00:02:35.829> the<00:02:35.890> past<00:02:36.159> 40<00:02:36.670> years<00:02:37.170> Sweden<00:02:38.170> has<00:02:38.290> been

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
for the past 40 years Sweden has been

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.410 
for the past 40 years Sweden has been
slowly<00:02:38.859> refining<00:02:39.640> the<00:02:39.760> way<00:02:39.879> that<00:02:40.060> they<00:02:40.180> built

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
slowly refining the way that they built

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.750 
slowly refining the way that they built
wooden<00:02:41.170> houses<00:02:41.620> make<00:02:42.400> them<00:02:42.579> more<00:02:42.700> energy

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
wooden houses make them more energy

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.300 
wooden houses make them more energy
efficient<00:02:43.569> as<00:02:44.230> well<00:02:44.500> as<00:02:44.650> more<00:02:44.829> efficient<00:02:45.220> to

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
efficient as well as more efficient to

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.000 
efficient as well as more efficient to
build<00:02:45.519> so<00:02:46.329> today<00:02:46.599> a<00:02:46.900> Swedish<00:02:47.349> house<00:02:47.530> has<00:02:47.980> a

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
build so today a Swedish house has a

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.280 
build so today a Swedish house has a
very<00:02:48.310> sophisticated<00:02:48.519> wall<00:02:49.180> system<00:02:49.599> they're

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
very sophisticated wall system they're

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.740 
very sophisticated wall system they're
using<00:02:50.319> a<00:02:50.799> very<00:02:51.099> deep<00:02:51.370> wood<00:02:51.639> stud<00:02:52.030> that<00:02:52.510> allows

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
house and on the outside of the house

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.360 
house and on the outside of the house
they're<00:03:14.439> using<00:03:14.680> another<00:03:14.920> layer<00:03:15.189> of

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
they're using another layer of

studs<00:03:17.799> and<00:03:18.160> their<00:03:18.400> cladding<00:03:18.910> so<00:03:19.209> these

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:19.359 
studs and their cladding so these

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:21.750 
studs and their cladding so these
additional<00:03:19.780> layers<00:03:20.019> serve<00:03:20.560> to<00:03:20.889> break<00:03:21.129> thermal

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760

additional layers serve to break thermal
bridges<00:03:22.209> through<00:03:22.540> the<00:03:22.660> wall<00:03:22.840> and<00:03:23.169> stops<00:03:23.739> the

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
bridges through the wall and stops the

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.849 
bridges through the wall and stops the
the<00:03:24.310> passage<00:03:25.239> of<00:03:25.510> heat<00:03:25.810> from<00:03:26.079> the<00:03:26.199> interior<00:03:26.500> to

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:26.859 
the passage of heat from the interior to

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:28.699 
the passage of heat from the interior to
the<00:03:26.889> exterior<00:03:26.980> during<00:03:27.940> the<00:03:28.030> heating<00:03:28.180> season

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
the exterior during the heating season

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.930 
the exterior during the heating season
so<00:03:29.709> they're<00:03:29.829> using<00:03:29.980> very<00:03:30.129> conventional

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
so they're using very conventional

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.149 
so they're using very conventional
materials<00:03:31.449> very<00:03:32.199> similar<00:03:32.620> to<00:03:32.769> what<00:03:32.889> we<00:03:32.980> use

00:03:33.149 --> 00:03:33.159 
materials very similar to what we use

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:36.059 
materials very similar to what we use
here<00:03:33.190> but<00:03:33.699> in<00:03:33.819> a<00:03:33.909> more<00:03:34.060> sophisticated<00:03:34.269> way<00:03:35.069> so

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:36.069 
here but in a more sophisticated way so

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:38.250 
here but in a more sophisticated way so
they're<00:03:36.549> able<00:03:36.730> to<00:03:36.879> achieve<00:03:37.030> high<00:03:37.540> levels<00:03:37.840> of

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
they're able to achieve high levels of

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.309 
they're able to achieve high levels of
energy<00:03:38.579> efficiency<00:03:39.930> with<00:03:40.930> very<00:03:41.169> basic

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:41.319 
energy efficiency with very basic

energy efficiency with very basic
construction<00:03:42.479> so<00:03:43.560> builders<00:03:44.560> here<00:03:44.680> in<00:03:44.799> the

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:44.859 
construction so builders here in the

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:46.860 
construction so builders here in the
United<00:03:45.129> States<00:03:45.370> have<00:03:45.639> all<00:03:45.940> the<00:03:46.209> the<00:03:46.510> technical

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
United States have all the the technical

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.020 
United States have all the the technical
skills<00:03:47.319> to<00:03:47.500> build<00:03:47.709> walls<00:03:48.069> this<00:03:48.400> way<00:03:48.639> they

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
skills to build walls this way they

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.140 
skills to build walls this way they
really<00:03:49.419> just<00:03:49.599> need<00:03:49.840> to<00:03:49.870> be<00:03:50.019> shown<00:03:50.379> what<00:03:50.680> to<00:03:50.859> do

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
really just need to be shown what to do

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.119 
really just need to be shown what to do
so<00:03:52.150> that's<00:03:52.329> what<00:03:52.599> Scott<00:03:53.199> and<00:03:53.409> I<00:03:53.440> have<00:03:53.620> done<00:03:53.799> in

so that's what Scott and I have done in

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:56.030 
so that's what Scott and I have done in
