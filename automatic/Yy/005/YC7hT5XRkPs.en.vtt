00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.039 

1230<00:01:20.900> at<00:01:22.310> six<00:01:23.310> teaspoons<00:01:23.670> it's<00:01:24.509> still<00:01:24.780> not

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
1230 at six teaspoons it's still not

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.749 
1230 at six teaspoons it's still not
enough<00:01:25.110> you<00:01:25.710> can<00:01:25.920> you<00:01:26.130> can<00:01:26.340> just<00:01:26.369> see<00:01:26.729> it

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
enough you can you can just see it

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:33.920 
enough you can you can just see it
becomes<00:01:27.470> it<00:01:28.470> becomes<00:01:28.619> like<00:01:29.130> this<00:01:29.720> okay<00:01:31.520> so<00:01:32.930> you

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
becomes it becomes like this okay so you

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:41.410

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
lucky you regions park you just start

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.900 
lucky you regions park you just start
mixing<00:02:29.390> it<00:02:29.780> really<00:02:30.230> well<00:02:30.440> until<00:02:30.830> it<00:02:31.220> becomes<00:02:31.670> a

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
mixing it really well until it becomes a

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:38.470 
mixing it really well until it becomes a
smooth<00:02:32.570> paste<00:02:36.040> it's<00:02:37.040> still<00:02:37.340> very<00:02:37.520> clumpy<00:02:38.210> but

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
smooth paste it's still very clumpy but

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.460 
smooth paste it's still very clumpy but
