00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.170
 everyone knows the popular game angry 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:10.150
 birds a few days ago 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.670
 improvisio the developer of angry 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.590
 birds released a sequel to this game 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.960
 and it seemed great to you one 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:18.730
 review angry birds two 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.380
 story of angry birds 2 nice always 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.300
 the same madness angry birds one and 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.960
 actually like all other games of 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.880
 and happens 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.769
 the pigs start walking with the eggs 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.570
 of birds and then do everything there 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:30.519
 to get their eggs back 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.230
 only there is a very happening 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:33.969
 what has been dealt with in comparing 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.440
 with the first version 

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:37.780
 example is the game to start already 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.820
 free which I will come back to later 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.680
 but that is already a big step forward 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.329
 because the first version of angry birds 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.010
 you still have to pay for that 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:46.270
 I always think it's free now 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.129
 the graphics are also under construction 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:50.170
 are now much more detailed and 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:52.239
 also a bit flatter and in the first version 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.010
 thing happens so yes I think so 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:55.989
 always been attached to the graphics and 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.600
 so really improve 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:59.649
 but the game in six years now even more 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.539
 the same maps 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:03.309
 yes there are only a few changes 

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:05.080
 always the same according to what i do have one 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:06.760
 little stupid child that no more 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.890
 have appended since those towers 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.350
 iconic and you several new birds 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.420
 ask but that is just a side issue 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.189
 the experience is not really the same 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.560
 have now remained a very large but 

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:19.420
 horse bird over god in such a 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.869
 another level can go and meanwhile 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.400
 sometimes a couple on dima boyfriend 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.470
 surprises that then before one 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.270
 give you a certain card that you then 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.920
 can use in the game such as the 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.150
 golden in the card and when you have it 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.009
 it's just all used 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.630
 ducklings rain and care to the 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:36.009
 piglets all die 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.659
 so yes that is great you have such a 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:40.090
 card over 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:42.220
 rock in ice and that is natural 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.200
 we go in when there is a lot of stone 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.920
 your level in your so easy tascam 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.450
 break 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.430
 yes you will come across such a card 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.500
 sometimes you come up with other things too 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.430
 cities such as and knowledge that you 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.530
 must pay 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.369
 yes you can also do that on the 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.979
 folder 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:58.719
 and currently there are 240 levels and 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:00.490
 that is the way I want it to follow 

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:01.689
 because a levels are in themselves too 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.219
 adjusted 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:06.189
 you now still have several 

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:07.630
 chapters and in the levels themselves you have 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:09.910
 still levels so when you reach a level 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.890
 plays is it used to be a level 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.790
 but now, for example, you have two levels 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.560
 in a level so you play in 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.840
 piece of the level and then you have another 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.450
 I think that's usually a bit harder 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.430
 is lady aunt thereto that 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.780
 when you are in the 2nd level napkin 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.819
 or to start all over again 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.579
 whether they already have to pay with the games that 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:31.129
 you collect in the game itself and that is 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:32.450
 directly the other negative points and in 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:35.420
 happens sea ​​and that is that you have to 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.400
 pay to play the game in itself 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.470
 free and you can also do unlimited 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.389
 but only if you don't die 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.000
 when you die and so you have five 

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:45.829
 lives then you just need your lives 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.590
 So I give up and die five times and 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:50.569
 to that you must either choose to five and 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.280
 to wait 20 minutes which I have long 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:55.099
 I really don't like waiting at 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.470
 a game or you have to pay 60 knowledge to 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:59.450
 so they keep getting new life and that 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.859
 games immediately then on both winning in yourself 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.659
 the game or fast you have to 

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:04.970
 pay and yes the prices of course not 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:06.769
 cheap that will see any recommendation 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.299
 in-app purchases are simply not 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:09.409
 cheap and I think this is a disadvantage 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:11.209
 to see 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:13.280
 angry birds are really in contradiction with van 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:15.019
 constant play an example i love 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.819
 to keep the game quite a while behind 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:18.260
 one to play but with angry birds two 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:21.139
 just doesn't see it possible because it does 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.400
 normally you put 16 a few times 

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:23.900
 level and with in 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.609
 an example is not a problem you 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.069
 could just keep trying again with 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:30.620
 now you just have to live a life every time 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:32.090
 and so you can only do it five times or 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.400
 more where you buy more lives 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.750
 play again and I don't really think so 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.819
 crazy or is that I really find one 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.709
 downside of angry birds w 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:41.750
 but the levels themselves are 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:43.819
 much more beautiful are some details 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.229
 added in background was the 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:46.579
 balloon of the piglets to the 

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:48.739
 back fly and yes I think so too 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:51.829
 be cool and to get as many levels 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:53.870
 then a concern c so-called and boss that is 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:55.790
 then a very big pig that you then 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.109
 must hit several times to die 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.329
 getting in you always is of course what 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:01.340
 let's the levels and after a while something 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:03.439
 make it harder that it really is 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.209
 difficult even if it is about pigs 

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:06.169
 who gets bigger and dead so that is 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:08.000
 cool 

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:11.060
 but there are also no new materials 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.840
 released in the levels so yes or less 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.519
 more 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.799
 are the two caverns purse one 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:17.780
 imagine the same arminian again 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:19.699
 angry birds with more focused on it 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.139
 bringing in even more money than with 

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:23.900
 and happens in you also had in it 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:25.700
 purchasing is extra image is but am 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.750
 happens being just got free and must 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.060
 you actually 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.770
 good if you buy everything yourself, but whatever 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.750
 but also to missions out when you get it 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.910
 first chapter have played 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.860
 so there are several have an x 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:38.630
 number of chapters since you are 240 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.190
 levels and when it's a pity 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:42.290
 40 looks behind it because there 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:43.730
 multiple levels will follow we will 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:45.590
 seeing or not feeling is going to go or not 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:49.250
 because you can imagine me very early 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:51.380
 at level 240 you will like it a lot 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.000
 plays blood that we just have to see 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.360
 and wonders if it's me for their update 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.220
 coming 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.630
 but when you do the first chapter now 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:59.330
 still out of picture in thing that it is in the 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:00.860
 first number of weeks 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.510
 you also get a few extra things that way 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.160
 get in special icon for you 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:06.050
 red bird now he wears one 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.300
 crown and yes so those things are coming 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:09.919
 or at so also sees that they are one 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.870
 have put a few things in the game 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:14.540
 these just give you free so you 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:16.550
 not really have to buy everything with real 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:17.990
 money so yes I think so too 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.820
 have thought of it somewhere 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:20.780
 Use fun but yeah I just think 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.700
 a pity that I have so much 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:25.130
 they also don't buy in-app purchases 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:26.990
 agree that when level 25 sees and 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:29.330
 You have played this out in the arena 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:31.729
 and so you can in the arena 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:33.890
 actually just put more high scores 

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:35.690
 so then it all with your friends 

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:37.580
 duel every time the 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:38.330
 correct score and this in itself is quite 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.770
 cool 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:42.890
 only it is a pity that you only 1 time 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:45.110
 can participate in the arena at noon so yes 

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:47.360
 if they had this waiting time 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:49.280
 I think lowering would be cool because 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.050
 yes 12 hours of waiting is no falling 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:53.300
 problem but that temming wants him to 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:55.280
 I wanted to play a lot in the arena 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:56.960
 do not personally but when you 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.460
 after all, world is a possibility there 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.850
 simply because he does not have yes 12 hours 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.650
 to wait 

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:02.990
 and I find that a bit ambitious 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:04.610
 sure with 12 hours not really quickly passed 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:06.380
 is like telling him to wait an hour okay 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:08.210
 he say I'll be back in an hour 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.680
 but there you are 12 hours after that time 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:11.210
 maybe just like he forgot 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.010
 to one is that the play and that you still 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:15.410
 something where plays so I think that's one 

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:17.360
 downside and the wait to get along with one 

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:18.860
 purchase is each the whole minus point 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.300
 angry birds weaver me 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:22.640
 I think it is a very cool sico 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:24.590
 angry birds cheek but rovio just has 

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:27.080
 made a few really wrong decisions 

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:29.210
 So angry birds know how the successor is 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:30.950
 from in happens in I do n't think so 

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:32.419
 especially by the wait I am going 

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:33.860
 probably much more like teenagers 

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:36.020
 a you still play a sentence i just there 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:37.910
 all the time, by also sometimes play 

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:39.050
 Angry Birds two really much sacrifice 

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:40.879
 just to play 

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:42.680
 I just don't like to wait 

00:06:40.879 --> 00:06:44.150
 probability just more angry 

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.860
 birds in play until they maybe 

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:46.909
 finally going to decide when angry 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.470
 birds two 

00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:51.729
 just let the deed go on 

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:51.729
 play without lives
