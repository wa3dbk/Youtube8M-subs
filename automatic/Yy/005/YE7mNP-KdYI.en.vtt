00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
we can switch that out and then these

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.950 
we can switch that out and then these
are<00:04:30.889> the<00:04:31.100> two<00:04:31.310> this<00:04:31.490> is<00:04:31.550> the<00:04:31.669> power<00:04:31.940> supply

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.600 
are the two this is the power supply
we<00:04:33.080> treat<00:04:33.319> this<00:04:33.440> like<00:04:33.500> server<00:04:34.039> because<00:04:34.370> these

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
we treat this like server because these

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.939 
we treat this like server because these
power<00:04:34.970> supplies<00:04:35.240> independently<00:04:36.139> cycle<00:04:36.590> up<00:04:36.710> if

00:04:36.939 --> 00:04:36.949 
power supplies independently cycle up if

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:39.640 
power supplies independently cycle up if
you<00:04:37.069> go<00:04:37.190> through<00:04:37.520> and<00:04:38.270> they<00:04:38.449> take<00:04:38.690> it<00:04:38.870> and<00:04:38.900> come

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
you go through and they take it and come

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:41.409 
you go through and they take it and come
up<00:04:39.800> independently<00:04:40.460> and<00:04:40.669> cycle<00:04:41.060> up<00:04:41.180> so<00:04:41.330> we

up independently and cycle up so we

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:43.270 
up independently and cycle up so we
