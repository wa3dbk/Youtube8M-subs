it's<00:02:20.000> hardly<00:02:20.330> surprising<00:02:20.510> that<00:02:20.990> they're

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
it's hardly surprising that they're

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.900 
it's hardly surprising that they're
trying<00:02:21.440> to<00:02:21.530> be<00:02:21.650> this<00:02:21.770> open<00:02:22.130> and<00:02:22.220> upfront<00:02:22.340> and

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
themselves to make themselves sort of

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.140 
themselves to make themselves sort of
the<00:02:27.560> good<00:02:27.740> guys<00:02:27.950> here<00:02:28.280> who<00:02:28.460> are<00:02:28.550> like<00:02:28.670> well<00:02:28.910> you

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
the good guys here who are like well you

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:30.610 
the good guys here who are like well you
know<00:02:29.270> you<00:02:29.300> can<00:02:29.600> refund<00:02:30.020> to<00:02:30.200> it<00:02:30.290> because<00:02:30.500> then

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
know you can refund to it because then

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.860 
know you can refund to it because then
that<00:02:30.970> potentially<00:02:31.970> makes<00:02:32.150> people<00:02:32.450> feel<00:02:32.660> like

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
that potentially makes people feel like

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.330 
that potentially makes people feel like
well<00:02:33.110> they're<00:02:33.320> being<00:02:33.410> so<00:02:33.650> open<00:02:33.950> about<00:02:34.070> it

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
well they're being so open about it

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.340 
well they're being so open about it
maybe<00:02:34.490> I'll<00:02:34.670> reward<00:02:35.090> that<00:02:35.270> by<00:02:35.480> not<00:02:35.690> refunding

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
maybe I'll reward that by not refunding

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.220 
maybe I'll reward that by not refunding
so<00:02:37.250> I<00:02:37.550> think<00:02:37.910> what<00:02:38.480> we're<00:02:38.630> seeing<00:02:38.840> here<00:02:39.140> and

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
so I think what we're seeing here and

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.320 
so I think what we're seeing here and
this<00:02:39.380> is<00:02:39.560> only<00:02:39.709> speculation<00:02:40.310> on<00:02:40.520> my<00:02:40.550> part<00:02:40.670> but

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
this is only speculation on my part but

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.900 
this is only speculation on my part but
I<00:02:41.390> think<00:02:41.660> we're<00:02:41.780> actually<00:02:41.900> seeing<00:02:42.470> a<00:02:42.910> positive

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
I think we're actually seeing a positive

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.780 
I think we're actually seeing a positive
effect<00:02:44.390> of<00:02:44.750> the<00:02:45.080> refund<00:02:45.500> policy<00:02:46.070> in<00:02:46.250> the

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
effect of the refund policy in the

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.610 
effect of the refund policy in the
companies<00:02:47.390> like<00:02:47.870> Warner<00:02:48.200> Brothers<00:02:48.500> here

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
companies like Warner Brothers here

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.770 
companies like Warner Brothers here
we're<00:02:48.739> going<00:02:48.860> to<00:02:48.950> have<00:02:49.130> to<00:02:49.310> fucking<00:02:49.780> pull

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
we're going to have to fucking pull

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.180 
we're going to have to fucking pull
their<00:02:50.959> finger<00:02:51.320> out<00:02:51.350> and<00:02:51.650> address<00:02:51.860> concerns

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
their finger out and address concerns

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.130 
their finger out and address concerns
and<00:02:52.640> not<00:02:52.700> just<00:02:52.910> ignore<00:02:53.270> them<00:02:53.540> and<00:02:53.720> not<00:02:53.870> just<00:02:54.050> do

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
and not just ignore them and not just do

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.260 
and not just ignore them and not just do
the<00:02:54.260> usual<00:02:54.530> spiel<00:02:55.280> like<00:02:55.580> they<00:02:55.730> tried<00:02:56.000> last

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 
the usual spiel like they tried last

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.270 
the usual spiel like they tried last
night<00:02:56.630> where<00:02:57.230> they<00:02:57.470> basically<00:02:57.830> gave<00:02:58.100> you<00:02:58.250> a

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
night where they basically gave you a

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.979 
night where they basically gave you a
load<00:02:58.520> of<00:02:58.550> recommendations<00:02:59.510> for<00:02:59.690> getting<00:02:59.900> it

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
load of recommendations for getting it

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:01.810 
load of recommendations for getting it
to<00:03:00.110> work<00:03:00.320> which<00:03:00.950> was<00:03:01.190> more<00:03:01.520> or<00:03:01.610> less<00:03:01.640> the

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
to work which was more or less the

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.370 
to work which was more or less the
equivalent<00:03:02.030> of<00:03:02.390> have<00:03:02.540> you<00:03:02.660> tried<00:03:02.930> turning<00:03:03.170> it

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
equivalent of have you tried turning it

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.890 
equivalent of have you tried turning it
off<00:03:03.530> and<00:03:03.709> on<00:03:03.800> again<00:03:04.150> so<00:03:05.150> yeah<00:03:05.690> they're

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
off and on again so yeah they're

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.660 
off and on again so yeah they're
actually<00:03:06.020> going<00:03:06.320> to<00:03:06.410> have<00:03:06.590> to<00:03:06.830> employ<00:03:07.310> some

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
actually going to have to employ some

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.729 
actually going to have to employ some
real<00:03:07.970> open<00:03:08.420> communication<00:03:09.050> some<00:03:09.260> actual

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739

customer service because otherwise the

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.250 
customer service because otherwise the
alternative<00:03:12.980> is<00:03:13.130> to<00:03:13.250> ignore<00:03:13.400> the<00:03:14.049> anger<00:03:15.049> and

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
alternative is to ignore the anger and

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.340
