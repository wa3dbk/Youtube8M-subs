a house so this is what I build for

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
want to live in for a while I would

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.810 
want to live in for a while I would
definitely<00:00:37.740> recommend<00:00:37.800> this<00:00:38.220> style<00:00:38.370> of<00:00:38.610> home

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
definitely recommend this style of home

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.210 
definitely recommend this style of home
so<00:00:39.090> find<00:00:39.360> sort<00:00:39.720> of<00:00:39.780> a<00:00:39.810> cliff<00:00:39.990> face<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:40.470> build

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:41.220 
so find sort of a cliff face and build

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:42.680 
so find sort of a cliff face and build
staircase<00:00:41.670> up<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:41.970> it<00:00:42.090> because<00:00:42.180> if<00:00:42.420> you<00:00:42.480> can't

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
staircase up to it because if you can't

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.060 
staircase up to it because if you can't
get<00:00:42.870> up<00:00:42.990> to<00:00:43.020> it<00:00:43.260> then<00:00:43.350> what's<00:00:43.560> the<00:00:43.680> point<00:00:43.890> of

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
get up to it then what's the point of

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.490 
get up to it then what's the point of
making<00:00:44.250> it<00:00:44.780> so<00:00:45.780> now<00:00:45.900> you<00:00:45.960> can<00:00:46.170> just<00:00:46.260> kind<00:00:46.470> of

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
making it so now you can just kind of

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.960 
making it so now you can just kind of
walk<00:00:46.650> up<00:00:46.830> your<00:00:46.980> staircase<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.550> get<00:00:47.640> your<00:00:47.790> home

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:47.970 
walk up your staircase and get your home

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.610 
walk up your staircase and get your home
we'll<00:00:48.210> add<00:00:48.300> a<00:00:48.330> guardrail<00:00:48.810> later<00:00:49.140> I<00:00:49.260> don't<00:00:49.410> want

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
we'll add a guardrail later I don't want

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.470 
we'll add a guardrail later I don't want
to<00:00:49.710> get<00:00:49.800> into<00:00:50.010> that<00:00:50.160> now<00:00:50.460> so<00:00:51.150> we<00:00:51.270> don't<00:00:51.390> really

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
to get into that now so we don't really

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.000 
to get into that now so we don't really
need<00:00:51.660> a<00:00:51.750> door<00:00:52.050> but<00:00:52.380> what<00:00:52.620> I<00:00:52.650> would<00:00:52.860> recommend

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
need a door but what I would recommend

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.510 
need a door but what I would recommend
doing<00:00:53.400> is<00:00:53.610> just<00:00:53.760> having<00:00:53.970> a<00:00:54.120> little<00:00:54.240> bit<00:00:54.390> of

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
doing is just having a little bit of

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.640 
doing is just having a little bit of
just<00:00:56.520> some<00:00:56.640> logs<00:00:56.910> there<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.540> kind<00:00:58.320> of<00:00:58.350> just

00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:58.650 
just some logs there and kind of just

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.430 
just some logs there and kind of just
kind<00:00:58.740> of<00:00:58.980> open<00:00:59.370> up<00:00:59.490> your<00:00:59.910> cave<00:01:00.600> face<00:01:01.080> so<00:01:01.410> that

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
kind of open up your cave face so that

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.369 
kind of open up your cave face so that
you<00:01:01.620> can<00:01:01.920> you<00:01:02.070> know<00:01:02.190> see<00:01:02.520> around<00:01:02.880> and<00:01:03.330> such<00:01:04.170> and

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379

then<00:01:06.030> just<00:01:06.210> kind<00:01:06.360> of<00:01:06.420> build<00:01:06.630> it<00:01:06.750> back<00:01:06.930> you'll

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
then just kind of build it back you'll

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.080 
then just kind of build it back you'll
be<00:01:07.800> able<00:01:07.980> to<00:01:08.100> do<00:01:08.190> this<00:01:08.310> as<00:01:08.460> fast<00:01:08.610> as<00:01:08.820> me<00:01:08.940> in<00:01:09.000> a

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
be able to do this as fast as me in a

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.850 
be able to do this as fast as me in a
survival<00:01:09.480> but<00:01:10.020> you<00:01:10.290> know<00:01:10.380> I'm<00:01:10.590> just<00:01:10.770> gonna

survival but you know I'm just gonna

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:11.960 
survival but you know I'm just gonna
build<00:01:11.070> this<00:01:11.190> back<00:01:11.370> a<00:01:11.400> little<00:01:11.490> bit<00:01:11.700> in<00:01:11.760> my<00:01:11.820> bare

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
build this back a little bit in my bare

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.060 
build this back a little bit in my bare
back<00:01:12.150> so<00:01:12.810> Chuck<00:01:13.320> should<00:01:13.710> look<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:14.040> little

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
back so Chuck should look a little

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.250 
back so Chuck should look a little
something<00:01:14.310> like<00:01:14.730> this<00:01:15.090> so<00:01:15.450> obviously<00:01:15.750> this<00:01:16.200> is

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:16.260 
something like this so obviously this is

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.190 
something like this so obviously this is
pretty<00:01:16.590> ugly<00:01:16.800> so<00:01:17.640> go<00:01:18.300> ahead<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.450> outline<00:01:18.630> the

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
pretty ugly so go ahead and outline the

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.260 
pretty ugly so go ahead and outline the
perimeter<00:01:19.800> with<00:01:20.100> okay<00:01:20.550> I<00:01:20.730> changed<00:01:20.970> mine

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
perimeter with okay I changed mine

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.840 
perimeter with okay I changed mine
change<00:01:21.720> these<00:01:21.960> two<00:01:22.290> planks<00:01:22.710> out<00:01:22.860> lied<00:01:23.640> the

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
change these two planks out lied the

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.680 
change these two planks out lied the
prim<00:01:24.120> perimeter<00:01:24.690> of<00:01:24.720> your<00:01:24.870> house<00:01:25.290> with<00:01:25.740> these

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:26.690 
prim perimeter of your house with these

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:32.540 
prim perimeter of your house with these
logs<00:01:27.690> facing<00:01:28.290> upwards<00:01:30.440> so<00:01:31.440> just<00:01:32.190> doing<00:01:32.430> that

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:32.550 
logs facing upwards so just doing that

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.080 
logs facing upwards so just doing that
there<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.090> whoops<00:01:33.330> mess<00:01:34.230> that<00:01:34.560> up

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
there and whoops mess that up

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.120 
there and whoops mess that up
alright<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:36.300> then<00:01:36.930> on<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.380> inner<00:01:37.590> portion

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
alright and then on the inner portion

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.300 
alright and then on the inner portion
here<00:01:38.700> I<00:01:38.850> would<00:01:39.210> recommend<00:01:39.690> placing<00:01:40.230> logs<00:01:40.860> and

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
here I would recommend placing logs and

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.190 
here I would recommend placing logs and

then for the walls you'll see what I do

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.310 
then for the walls you'll see what I do
in<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:43.440> second<00:01:43.830> I<00:01:43.979> really<00:01:45.110> enjoy<00:01:46.110> building

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
in a second I really enjoy building

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.020

out here we'll figure that out later
we'll<00:02:04.979> look<00:02:05.100> something<00:02:05.549> like<00:02:05.580> that<00:02:06.620> anyways

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:07.620 
we'll look something like that anyways

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.340 
we'll look something like that anyways
for<00:02:08.009> now<00:02:08.240> go<00:02:09.240> ahead<00:02:09.300> and<00:02:09.420> make<00:02:09.539> all<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:10.110> walls

for now go ahead and make all the walls
stone<00:02:10.800> brick<00:02:11.160> so<00:02:11.550> you<00:02:11.970> go

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
stone brick so you go

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.089 
stone brick so you go
don't<00:02:12.420> need<00:02:12.569> to<00:02:12.629> see<00:02:12.870> me<00:02:13.049> do<00:02:13.230> that<00:02:13.439> so<00:02:13.739> I<00:02:13.769> shall

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
don't need to see me do that so I shall

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:20.300 
don't need to see me do that so I shall
do<00:02:14.370> that<00:02:14.400> and<00:02:15.019> actually<00:02:16.019> right<00:02:16.500> here<00:02:19.280> make<00:02:20.280> it

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
do that and actually right here make it

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.830 
do that and actually right here make it
look<00:02:20.430> like<00:02:20.610> a<00:02:20.700> wood<00:02:20.939> frame<00:02:21.180> so<00:02:21.569> it's<00:02:21.720> like

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
look like a wood frame so it's like

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.530 
look like a wood frame so it's like
supporting<00:02:22.439> it<00:02:22.909> something<00:02:23.909> like<00:02:23.939> that<00:02:24.060> and

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
supporting it something like that and

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.699 
supporting it something like that and
kind<00:02:25.500> of<00:02:25.560> like<00:02:25.680> this<00:02:25.860> too<00:02:26.159> and<00:02:26.959> I<00:02:27.959> know<00:02:28.560> you

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
kind of like this too and I know you

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:29.690 
kind of like this too and I know you
can't<00:02:28.890> place<00:02:29.069> them<00:02:29.189> like<00:02:29.220> that<00:02:29.400> so<00:02:29.519> you<00:02:29.579> can

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
can't place them like that so you can

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.099 
can't place them like that so you can
just<00:02:29.790> place<00:02:29.970> them<00:02:30.090> like<00:02:30.150> that<00:02:30.420> it'll<00:02:30.720> look<00:02:30.840> fun

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:31.109 
just place them like that it'll look fun

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:33.979 
just place them like that it'll look fun
but<00:02:31.319> since<00:02:32.099> you're<00:02:32.250> on<00:02:32.280> the<00:02:32.340> PC<00:02:32.909> or<00:02:33.180> the<00:02:33.299> Xbox

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
but since you're on the PC or the Xbox

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:35.390 
but since you're on the PC or the Xbox
you<00:02:34.500> should<00:02:34.650> build<00:02:34.739> this<00:02:34.950> and<00:02:35.129> by<00:02:35.189> the<00:02:35.280> way

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
you should build this and by the way

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.559 
you should build this and by the way
this<00:02:35.579> works<00:02:35.790> on<00:02:35.879> both<00:02:36.060> the<00:02:36.180> Pocket<00:02:36.540> Edition

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
this works on both the Pocket Edition

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.780 
this works on both the Pocket Edition

now<00:02:57.810> with<00:02:57.989> these<00:02:58.109> stone<00:02:58.409> brick<00:02:58.650> stairs<00:02:58.680> just

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
now with these stone brick stairs just

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.929 
now with these stone brick stairs just
kind<00:02:59.879> of<00:03:00.060> make<00:03:00.450> sort<00:03:01.200> of<00:03:01.260> a<00:03:01.439> L<00:03:02.069> shape<00:03:02.459> like<00:03:02.670> this

00:03:02.929 --> 00:03:02.939 
kind of make sort of a L shape like this

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:04.819 
kind of make sort of a L shape like this
there's<00:03:03.239> stairs<00:03:03.480> and<00:03:03.870> then<00:03:04.409> you<00:03:04.500> can<00:03:04.650> place

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:04.829 
there's stairs and then you can place

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:05.990 
there's stairs and then you can place
close<00:03:05.099> to<00:03:05.250> them<00:03:05.340> behind<00:03:05.609> them<00:03:05.790> and<00:03:05.909> I'd

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
close to them behind them and I'd

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.369 
close to them behind them and I'd
recommend<00:03:06.150> like<00:03:06.540> this<00:03:06.720> so<00:03:06.840> that<00:03:06.870> two<00:03:07.139> of<00:03:07.170> the

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:07.379 
recommend like this so that two of the

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:09.710 
recommend like this so that two of the
blocks<00:03:07.620> show<00:03:07.920> and<00:03:08.220> if<00:03:08.819> you<00:03:08.939> have<00:03:09.060> a<00:03:09.090> portion

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
blocks show and if you have a portion

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.059 
blocks show and if you have a portion
like<00:03:09.810> this<00:03:10.049> and<00:03:10.290> of<00:03:10.349> course<00:03:10.560> you<00:03:10.680> can<00:03:10.799> just<00:03:10.889> do

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
like this and of course you can just do

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:12.319 
like this and of course you can just do
like<00:03:11.189> this<00:03:11.400> and<00:03:11.609> make<00:03:11.730> sure<00:03:11.849> you<00:03:11.939> place<00:03:12.150> it

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329 
like this and make sure you place it

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:12.920 
like this and make sure you place it
behind<00:03:12.540> them

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
behind them

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.929 
behind them

it adds kind of a neat effect and you

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:16.220 
it adds kind of a neat effect and you
can<00:03:15.060> put<00:03:15.180> torches<00:03:15.420> back<00:03:15.780> there<00:03:16.019> whatever

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:17.849 
you'd like is light source if you do not

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:19.189 
you'd like is light source if you do not
that<00:03:18.180> point<00:03:18.480> where<00:03:18.599> you<00:03:18.660> have<00:03:18.750> closed<00:03:18.959> stone

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:19.199 
that point where you have closed stone

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:21.020 
that point where you have closed stone
yet<00:03:19.410> or<00:03:19.859> you<00:03:20.040> can<00:03:20.160> just<00:03:20.340> you<00:03:20.430> know<00:03:20.459> add<00:03:20.639> torches

on<00:03:21.120> the<00:03:21.209> walls<00:03:21.419> and<00:03:21.629> be<00:03:21.750> unsee<00:03:22.379> but<00:03:23.310> now<00:03:23.639> I'm<00:03:24.030> I

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:24.449 
on the walls and be unsee but now I'm I

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:25.670 
on the walls and be unsee but now I'm I
think<00:03:24.690> it's<00:03:24.780> a<00:03:24.840> good<00:03:24.989> time<00:03:25.139> to<00:03:25.319> kind<00:03:25.440> of<00:03:25.560> add

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
think it's a good time to kind of add

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.159 
think it's a good time to kind of add
some<00:03:25.709> you<00:03:26.400> know<00:03:26.519> defense<00:03:27.269> to<00:03:27.599> our<00:03:27.690> decks<00:03:27.930> we

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:28.169 
some you know defense to our decks we

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:29.839 
some you know defense to our decks we
don't<00:03:28.319> fall<00:03:28.530> off<00:03:28.709> and<00:03:28.889> die<00:03:29.040> you<00:03:29.099> know<00:03:29.400> again<00:03:29.819> I

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:29.849 
don't fall off and die you know again I

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:33.710 
don't fall off and die you know again I
don't<00:03:30.299> like<00:03:30.510> falling<00:03:30.870> off<00:03:30.959> and<00:03:31.139> dying<00:03:31.349> and<00:03:32.720> go

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
don't like falling off and dying and go

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.869 
don't like falling off and dying and go
ahead<00:03:33.840> and<00:03:33.959> add<00:03:34.049> some<00:03:34.079> structural<00:03:34.829> support<00:03:34.980> so

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:35.879 
ahead and add some structural support so

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:38.720 
ahead and add some structural support so
it<00:03:36.000> doesn't<00:03:36.329> look<00:03:36.449> weird<00:03:36.690> you<00:03:37.129> know<00:03:38.129> things

don't need to look weird and add one
right<00:03:42.569> here<00:03:42.959> and<00:03:43.459> of<00:03:44.459> course<00:03:44.489> if<00:03:44.970> it's<00:03:45.150> a

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
right here and of course if it's a

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.180 
right here and of course if it's a
structure<00:03:45.930> then<00:03:46.349> you're<00:03:46.530> going<00:03:46.709> to<00:03:46.829> need<00:03:47.010> some

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
structure then you're going to need some

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.250 
structure then you're going to need some
fence<00:03:47.430> and<00:03:48.120> you're<00:03:48.479> going<00:03:48.690> to<00:03:48.810> need<00:03:48.959> to<00:03:49.079> make

fence and you're going to need to make

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.860 
fence and you're going to need to make
it<00:03:49.379> look<00:03:49.560> like<00:03:49.739> it's<00:03:49.949> actually<00:03:50.099> supported

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
it look like it's actually supported

and<00:04:41.860> so<00:04:42.610> I've<00:04:42.760> decided<00:04:43.120> that<00:04:43.300> on<00:04:43.870> this<00:04:44.350> wall

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
and so I've decided that on this wall

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.470 
and so I've decided that on this wall
I'm<00:04:45.010> again<00:04:45.310> that's<00:04:45.490> just<00:04:45.580> one<00:04:45.790> idea<00:04:45.970> I'm<00:04:46.270> not

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:46.480 
I'm again that's just one idea I'm not

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:47.850 
I'm again that's just one idea I'm not
entirely<00:04:46.750> liking<00:04:47.260> that<00:04:47.410> so<00:04:47.560> you<00:04:47.620> can<00:04:47.740> do

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
entirely liking that so you can do

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.380 
entirely liking that so you can do
something<00:04:48.130> like<00:04:48.160> that<00:04:48.280> if<00:04:48.580> you'd<00:04:48.700> like<00:04:48.850> I'm

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:49.390 
something like that if you'd like I'm

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:50.850 
something like that if you'd like I'm
thinking<00:04:49.900> on<00:04:50.020> this<00:04:50.170> wall<00:04:50.380> I'm<00:04:50.500> going<00:04:50.650> to<00:04:50.740> add<00:04:50.830> a

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
thinking on this wall I'm going to add a

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.970 
thinking on this wall I'm going to add a
little<00:04:51.040> library<00:04:51.790> type<00:04:52.150> thing<00:04:52.420> I<00:04:52.980> consider

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:53.980 
little library type thing I consider

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.920 
little library type thing I consider
these<00:04:54.340> my<00:04:54.610> specialties<00:04:55.240> so<00:04:55.450> I'm<00:04:55.540> going<00:04:55.690> to<00:04:55.720> dig

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.930 
these my specialties so I'm going to dig

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.500 
these my specialties so I'm going to dig
this<00:04:56.080> back<00:04:56.290> in<00:04:56.500> a<00:04:56.590> second<00:04:56.980> little<00:04:57.370> bit<00:04:57.820> here<00:04:58.330> I

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:58.510 
this back in a second little bit here I

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:00.570
