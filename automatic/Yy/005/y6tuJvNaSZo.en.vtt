00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.940
 hey people here for whom i have today 

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:06.890
 duckling costs for you on the subject of batteries 

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:08.390
 many will definitely have an exit until 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:09.800
 lying around at home and wondering 

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:11.090
 which batteries or which batteries 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.410
 you should use for it 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.380
 and I have a clear recommendation 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:18.620
 namely the sanyo eneloop so see the 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:21.500
 I can make things out of three out of three 

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:23.030
 on the one hand, we recommend the capacity 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.789
 have one here now in the case 

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:28.730
 Capacity of 1900 million few hours 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:31.610
 For comparison, the iPhone 5 has one 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:34.040
 400 million ampere hours lower 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.829
 performance about 1500 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.870
 millennia as well there are from 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:40.399
 the sanyo eneloop it again a high 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.460
 capacity variant 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:48.829
 this is this one that has fabulous 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:49.460
 moment 2450 milliamps so one 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:52.489
 whole lot 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.960
 So here comes pretty far with it 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.660
 if you have the things in your lightning 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.450
 used second point is the 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:02.239
 Self-discharge is usually like this 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.860
 if you charge a battery and then the 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.389
 maybe three months later use 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.819
 he would like to have only very little 

00:01:05.389 --> 00:01:09.049
 charge and the things consume here 

00:01:07.819 --> 00:01:12.829
 easy or clear yourself 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:15.310
 a lot much later, too loud 

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:17.840
 manufacturer's data is 90 percent 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.939
 Charge is still on it after a year 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.859
 the third point is the tension 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:24.350
 usually it is so when you are full 

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:25.549
 recharged batteries then have 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.979
 yours at the beginning one again quickly 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:29.539
 Charge time and turn it off in steadily 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:31.849
 the less charge on the battery on it 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:34.579
 is with the apps it is such that the 

00:01:31.849 --> 00:01:37.009
 This was this tension relatively long 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:39.200
 keep it constantly high so that 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:40.819
 We have a longer period one 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.389
 fast recovery time from yours 

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:45.590
 So all in all, lightning is very good 

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:46.340
 I can only warm things up 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.979
 recommend 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.380
 on the left I post below in the indie 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:52.789
 video description i hope that again 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.899
 has helped you a little bit you can 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:54.919
 I like into the comments 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:57.259
 Write if we also have a loose one 

00:01:54.919 --> 00:02:00.340
 otherwise, thanks for watching 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:00.340
 see you next time
