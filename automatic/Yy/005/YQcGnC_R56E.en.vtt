probably<00:01:06.560> start<00:01:06.979> to<00:01:07.130> mod<00:01:07.310> my<00:01:07.520> own<00:01:07.700> drone<00:01:08.030> so

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
probably start to mod my own drone so

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.570 
probably start to mod my own drone so
all<00:01:08.810> in<00:01:08.960> all<00:01:09.080> I<00:01:09.350> basically<00:01:09.770> just<00:01:09.890> dropped<00:01:10.460> the

you<00:02:25.370> have<00:02:25.640> a<00:02:25.670> few<00:02:26.000> technical<00:02:26.480> specs<00:02:27.459> once<00:02:28.459> a

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
you have a few technical specs once a

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.110 
you have a few technical specs once a
con<00:02:28.909> read<00:02:29.180> a<00:02:29.209> few<00:02:29.480> outs<00:02:30.340> and<00:02:31.340> it's<00:02:31.640> got<00:02:31.849> two

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
con read a few outs and it's got two

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.690 
con read a few outs and it's got two
cameras<00:02:32.629> embedded<00:02:33.019> the<00:02:33.590> one<00:02:33.739> on<00:02:33.890> the<00:02:34.069> front<00:02:34.340> as

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
cameras embedded the one on the front as

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.210 
cameras embedded the one on the front as
well<00:02:34.730> as<00:02:35.030> one<00:02:35.269> facing<00:02:35.750> down<00:02:36.079> it<00:02:36.590> generates<00:02:37.069> its

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
well as one facing down it generates its

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.270 
well as one facing down it generates its
own<00:02:37.400> Wi-Fi<00:02:37.760> network<00:02:38.590> autopilot<00:02:39.590> up<00:02:39.860> to<00:02:39.980> six

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
own Wi-Fi network autopilot up to six

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.580 
own Wi-Fi network autopilot up to six
meters<00:02:40.610> high<00:02:40.790> it's<00:02:41.180> got<00:02:41.360> ultrasound<00:02:42.049> sensors

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
meters high it's got ultrasound sensors

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.390 
meters high it's got ultrasound sensors
to<00:02:43.069> gyros<00:02:43.610> and<00:02:43.909> one<00:02:44.180> accelerometer<00:02:45.170> so<00:02:46.010> it's<00:02:46.220> a

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
to gyros and one accelerometer so it's a

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.670 
to gyros and one accelerometer so it's a
pretty<00:02:46.640> high-tech<00:02:46.910> device<00:02:47.540> the<00:02:47.930> processor<00:02:48.530> on

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
pretty high-tech device the processor on

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.650 
pretty high-tech device the processor on
it<00:02:48.709> is<00:02:49.180> really<00:02:50.180> powerful<00:02:51.400> and<00:02:52.400> on<00:02:52.940> the<00:02:53.180> bottom

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
it is really powerful and on the bottom

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.539 
it is really powerful and on the bottom
you<00:02:54.109> have<00:02:54.140> the<00:02:54.620> AR<00:02:54.859> Drone

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:55.549 
you have the AR Drone

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:57.819 
you have the AR Drone
air<00:02:55.849> base<00:02:56.180> so<00:02:56.540> basically<00:02:57.019> if<00:02:57.260> you<00:02:57.379> take<00:02:57.620> out

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:57.829 
air base so basically if you take out

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:01.509 
air base so basically if you take out
your<00:02:58.099> mmm<00:02:59.000> student<00:02:59.510> meter<00:02:59.629> drone<00:03:00.019> and<00:03:00.400> take<00:03:01.400> it

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
your mmm student meter drone and take it

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:03.250 
your mmm student meter drone and take it
out<00:03:01.609> of<00:03:01.640> the<00:03:01.760> box<00:03:02.030> you<00:03:02.329> can<00:03:02.359> use<00:03:02.629> this<00:03:02.840> as<00:03:03.200> a

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
out of the box you can use this as a

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.649 
out of the box you can use this as a
landing<00:03:03.739> pad<00:03:03.980> so<00:03:04.489> it'll<00:03:04.640> be<00:03:04.790> nice<00:03:05.000> and<00:03:05.299> soft

00:03:05.649 --> 00:03:05.659 
landing pad so it'll be nice and soft

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:08.559 
landing pad so it'll be nice and soft
