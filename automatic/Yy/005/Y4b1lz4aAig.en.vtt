00:00:09.289 --> 00:00:13.109
 with friends my name is Pablo porcelli in the program we are going to be copying 

00:00:13.109 --> 00:00:16.109
 the alto saker parker 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:26.929
 well here we are with the saxophone parker gusto is an instrument of Chinese origin 

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:30.419
 is one of the most sold instruments in the market the lies do not think that 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:33.940
 there are doubts but very likely some countries next door also of 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.860
 sudden increase in study 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.170
 that you have fair benefits for what we are looking for 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.699
 finally the titles so much by the teachers that we recommend solution 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.600
 the design that he has spent parker this district 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.830
 this french design and I say with the covers the director of the been very 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:53.840
 hard 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.850
 and that theme of classic end speaker is a classic instrument with the 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.620
 benefits this I say in terms of price-quality 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.990
 its sound is rather distant in general the instruments that come from 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.030
 East 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.110
 and that's why it's not always about which to hoist 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.110
 against the team in terms of out 15 to the cane that so important and also 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.030
 the clamp that not in some other popular program 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.980
 is a very good cement to start as you say because lawyers have very 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.799
 good sound down but probably lose body c 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.460
 recently very fine-tuned is quite difficult to get in increments 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.430
 higher 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.360
 but of all the passage of 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.750
 the detective of the entire chromatic scale of cement we see him in the 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.730
 next program back 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.730
 Nothing of that 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.250
 instruments so that those present included the wind instrument and 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.600
 percussion know you entering the triple-double point instruments for 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.270
 that together with
