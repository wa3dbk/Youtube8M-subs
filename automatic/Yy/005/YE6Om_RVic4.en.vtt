little<00:00:12.129> book<00:00:12.910> review<00:00:13.330> about<00:00:14.520> boob<00:00:15.520> that<00:00:15.730> I

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:15.879 
little book review about boob that I

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:18.570 
little book review about boob that I
think<00:00:16.209> that<00:00:16.330> everyone<00:00:16.960> should<00:00:17.160> have<00:00:18.160> in<00:00:18.490> their

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:18.580 
think that everyone should have in their

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.460 
think that everyone should have in their
library<00:00:18.940> and<00:00:19.510> I<00:00:19.630> think<00:00:20.020> that<00:00:20.110> you<00:00:20.170> should<00:00:20.200> have

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:20.470 
library and I think that you should have

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.200 
library and I think that you should have
actually<00:00:20.680> took<00:00:21.070> those<00:00:21.370> one<00:00:21.670> in<00:00:21.760> your<00:00:21.880> pores

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:22.210 
actually took those one in your pores

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.210 
actually took those one in your pores
because<00:00:22.570> it's<00:00:22.750> nice<00:00:22.960> and<00:00:23.020> little<00:00:23.470> book<00:00:23.620> it<00:00:24.010> can

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:24.220 
because it's nice and little book it can

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.020 
because it's nice and little book it can
fit<00:00:24.490> to<00:00:24.700> backpack<00:00:25.350> or<00:00:26.350> pores<00:00:27.250> that<00:00:27.820> you

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:28.030 
fit to backpack or pores that you

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:30.000 
fit to backpack or pores that you
carrying<00:00:28.420> when<00:00:28.600> you<00:00:28.690> go<00:00:28.870> to<00:00:28.930> grocery<00:00:29.260> shop<00:00:29.560> and

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.010 
carrying when you go to grocery shop and

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.700 
carrying when you go to grocery shop and
also<00:00:30.670> I<00:00:31.180> think<00:00:31.450> they<00:00:31.780> should<00:00:31.960> have<00:00:31.990> one<00:00:32.439> in

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:32.710 
also I think they should have one in

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.700 
also I think they should have one in
your<00:00:32.770> home<00:00:33.239> where<00:00:34.239> you<00:00:34.270> actually<00:00:34.809> have<00:00:35.500> your

glycemic index which is now by

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:04.679 
glycemic index which is now by
scientists<00:02:03.280> use<00:02:03.549> as<00:02:03.759> the<00:02:04.090> only<00:02:04.299> way<00:02:04.630> to

scientists use as the only way to

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:07.770 
scientists use as the only way to
actually<00:02:05.079> determine

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.100 

how<00:02:08.470> food<00:02:09.009> actually<00:02:09.509> reacts<00:02:10.509> on<00:02:10.750> our<00:02:10.959> body<00:02:11.410> and

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
how food actually reacts on our body and

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.490 
how food actually reacts on our body and
you<00:02:14.110> know<00:02:14.290> because<00:02:14.830> it's<00:02:15.010> very<00:02:15.310> tiny<00:02:15.670> book<00:02:15.940> I

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
you know because it's very tiny book I

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.199 
you know because it's very tiny book I
think<00:02:17.500> it's<00:02:17.680> maybe<00:02:18.069> just<00:02:18.400> like<00:02:18.610> like<00:02:19.000> this

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
think it's maybe just like like this

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:25.229 
think it's maybe just like like this
this<00:02:19.990> number<00:02:20.230> one<00:02:20.650> inch<00:02:21.060> or<00:02:22.060> it<00:02:22.480> has<00:02:23.100> over<00:02:24.239> 130

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
this number one inch or it has over 130

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:28.470 
this number one inch or it has over 130
pages<00:02:25.540> and<00:02:26.310> actually<00:02:27.310> is<00:02:27.459> the<00:02:27.730> probably<00:02:28.390> the

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
pages and actually is the probably the

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.930 
pages and actually is the probably the
only<00:02:28.989> book<00:02:29.530> that<00:02:29.560> explains<00:02:30.340> complete

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
only book that explains complete
