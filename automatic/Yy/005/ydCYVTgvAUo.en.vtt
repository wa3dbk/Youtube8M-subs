starts<00:00:54.180> are<00:00:54.300> pretty<00:00:54.480> decent<00:00:54.930> though<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.140> start

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
starts are pretty decent though to start

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.279 
starts are pretty decent though to start
with<00:00:55.710> what<00:00:56.039> was<00:00:56.219> that<00:00:56.750> that's<00:00:57.750> climb<00:00:58.050> on<00:00:58.199> an

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
with what was that that's climb on an

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.529 
with what was that that's climb on an
imaginary<00:00:58.500> crate<00:00:58.980> I<00:00:59.219> kind<00:00:59.879> of<00:01:00.000> show<00:01:00.210> here<00:01:00.420> with

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
imaginary crate I kind of show here with

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.410 
imaginary crate I kind of show here with
the<00:01:00.629> ranges<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.410> how<00:01:02.250> like<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.670> spread<00:01:03.090> opens

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
the ranges and how like the spread opens

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.760 
the ranges and how like the spread opens
up<00:01:03.629> it's<00:01:04.350> not<00:01:04.530> too<00:01:04.890> bad<00:01:05.159> but<00:01:06.350> you<00:01:07.350> only<00:01:07.439> shoot

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
up it's not too bad but you only shoot

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.800 
up it's not too bad but you only shoot
four<00:01:08.040> bullets<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:10.369> it's<00:01:11.369> more<00:01:12.000> for<00:01:12.540> mid-range

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
four bullets and it's more for mid-range

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.649 
four bullets and it's more for mid-range
it<00:01:13.520> doesn't<00:01:14.520> really<00:01:14.640> hold<00:01:14.909> it<00:01:15.060> up<00:01:15.150> to<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.360> heck

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
it doesn't really hold it up to the heck

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.980 
it doesn't really hold it up to the heck
for<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:15.960> longer<00:01:16.350> range<00:01:16.850> so<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:17.970> stats<00:01:18.270> are<00:01:18.540> 40

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
for the longer range so the stats are 40

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.620 
for the longer range so the stats are 40
base<00:01:19.200> damage<00:01:20.659> 2.5<00:01:21.659> fire<00:01:22.790> 89.1<00:01:23.790> accuracy<00:01:24.420> and

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
base damage 2.5 fire 89.1 accuracy and

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.649 
base damage 2.5 fire 89.1 accuracy and
20<00:01:25.020> clip<00:01:25.290> size<00:01:25.549> so<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.670> main<00:01:26.880> differences<00:01:27.450> are

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
20 clip size so the main differences are

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.590 
20 clip size so the main differences are
between<00:01:27.689> this<00:01:28.409> gun<00:01:28.790> the<00:01:29.790> shoddy<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.390> heck

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
between this gun the shoddy and the heck

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:37.130 
between this gun the shoddy and the heck
is<00:01:31.159> the<00:01:32.159> base<00:01:32.430> damage<00:01:32.880> is<00:01:33.360> like<00:01:35.360> 100<00:01:36.360> less<00:01:36.810> than

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
is the base damage is like 100 less than

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.810 
is the base damage is like 100 less than
a<00:01:37.229> heck<00:01:38.540> so<00:01:39.540> I<00:01:39.570> mean<00:01:39.930> it's<00:01:40.590> just<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:40.890> ton<00:01:41.310> less

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
a heck so I mean it's just a ton less

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.889 
a heck so I mean it's just a ton less
damage<00:01:43.040> you<00:01:44.040> only<00:01:44.310> have<00:01:44.640> four<00:01:45.030> pellets<00:01:45.600> as

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
damage you only have four pellets as

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.380 
damage you only have four pellets as
opposed<00:01:46.259> to<00:01:46.530> what<00:01:46.560> eight<00:01:47.220> or<00:01:47.700> ten<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.240> heck

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
opposed to what eight or ten the heck

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:54.859 
opposed to what eight or ten the heck
has<00:01:48.600> one<00:01:48.990> of<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.140> two<00:01:51.979> 2.5<00:01:52.979> fire<00:01:53.340> 8<00:01:53.630> the<00:01:54.630> hex

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
has one of the two 2.5 fire 8 the hex

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.649 
has one of the two 2.5 fire 8 the hex
what<00:01:55.110> 2.2<00:01:55.710> so<00:01:56.070> I<00:01:56.100> mean<00:01:56.340> it's<00:01:56.549> like<00:01:56.790> pretty<00:01:57.479> much

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
what 2.2 so I mean it's like pretty much

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.920 
what 2.2 so I mean it's like pretty much
the<00:01:57.780> same<00:01:58.049> fiery<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:59.090> then<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.180> clip<00:02:00.450> size<00:02:00.689> is

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
the same fiery and then the clip size is

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.880 
the same fiery and then the clip size is
20<00:02:01.320> yeah<00:02:01.710> that's<00:02:02.040> nice<00:02:02.310> but<00:02:03.590> really<00:02:04.590> I<00:02:04.619> could

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
only see this gun being better than the

you'll see you'll see here when I'm
shooting<00:02:12.580> the<00:02:12.760> intense<00:02:13.379> the<00:02:14.379> tens<00:02:14.739> are<00:02:15.010> full

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
shooting the intense the tens are full

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.839 
shooting the intense the tens are full
damage<00:02:15.580> for<00:02:15.970> tens<00:02:16.299> makes<00:02:16.599> 40<00:02:17.019> so<00:02:17.549> it's<00:02:18.549> like

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849 
damage for tens makes 40 so it's like

curtains<00:02:45.370> walking<00:02:46.180> around<00:02:47.370> maybe<00:02:48.370> I've<00:02:48.519> been

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:48.549 
curtains walking around maybe I've been

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:50.849 
curtains walking around maybe I've been
able<00:02:48.760> to<00:02:48.910> wait<00:02:49.120> a<00:02:49.150> hit<00:02:49.599> though<00:02:49.810> maybe<00:02:50.379> I'm<00:02:50.560> in<00:02:50.829> a

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:50.859 
able to wait a hit though maybe I'm in a

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:53.520 
able to wait a hit though maybe I'm in a
way<00:02:51.160> to<00:02:51.220> lames<00:02:51.609> to<00:02:51.849> be<00:02:51.970> a<00:02:52.000> little<00:02:52.150> off<00:02:52.470> but<00:02:53.470> I

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
way to lames to be a little off but I

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.259 
way to lames to be a little off but I
sit<00:02:53.829> here<00:02:53.920> trying<00:02:54.220> to<00:02:54.280> hit<00:02:54.430> this<00:02:54.519> weak<00:02:54.730> spot<00:02:55.000> it

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
sit here trying to hit this weak spot it

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:56.670 
sit here trying to hit this weak spot it
is<00:02:55.510> kind<00:02:55.780> of<00:02:55.810> hard<00:02:55.870> to<00:02:56.079> get<00:02:56.260> all<00:02:56.379> your<00:02:56.410> bullets

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
is kind of hard to get all your bullets

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.059 
is kind of hard to get all your bullets
off<00:02:57.450> but<00:02:58.450> anyways<00:02:58.810> 40<00:02:59.260> base<00:02:59.470> damage<00:02:59.769> it's

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:00.069 
off but anyways 40 base damage it's

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:01.830 
off but anyways 40 base damage it's
really<00:03:00.370> low<00:03:00.549> and<00:03:00.579> yeah<00:03:00.940> it's<00:03:01.180> got<00:03:01.329> 20<00:03:01.629> clip

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
really low and yeah it's got 20 clip

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.699 
really low and yeah it's got 20 clip
size<00:03:02.079> and<00:03:02.500> I<00:03:02.769> think<00:03:04.260> the<00:03:05.260> only<00:03:05.290> time<00:03:05.590> it's

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
size and I think the only time it's

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:07.410 
size and I think the only time it's
really<00:03:06.040> going<00:03:06.160> to<00:03:06.220> be<00:03:06.280> better<00:03:06.579> than<00:03:06.760> a<00:03:06.819> heck<00:03:07.120> is

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
really going to be better than a heck is

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.110 
really going to be better than a heck is
like<00:03:07.750> if<00:03:08.319> you're<00:03:09.190> doing<00:03:09.430> low<00:03:09.670> enough<00:03:09.879> enemies

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
like if you're doing low enough enemies

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.819 
like if you're doing low enough enemies
like<00:03:10.569> let's<00:03:10.810> say<00:03:10.870> you're<00:03:11.079> fully<00:03:11.319> modded

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:11.829 
like let's say you're fully modded

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:13.860 
like let's say you're fully modded

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
got 15 of them if the so back can

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:22.199 
got 15 of them if the so back can
one-shot<00:03:18.700> them<00:03:19.209> the<00:03:19.419> heck<00:03:19.630> can<00:03:19.900> so<00:03:21.000> you<00:03:22.000> will

one-shot them the heck can so you will
do<00:03:22.419> better<00:03:22.450> with<00:03:22.840> the<00:03:22.959> so<00:03:23.200> back<00:03:23.440> in<00:03:23.680> the<00:03:24.160> way

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
do better with the so back in the way

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.640 
do better with the so back in the way
that<00:03:24.609> when<00:03:25.269> you<00:03:25.359> run<00:03:25.510> out<00:03:25.540> of<00:03:25.690> when<00:03:26.349> you<00:03:26.440> got<00:03:26.530> to

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
that when you run out of when you got to

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.229 
that when you run out of when you got to
reload<00:03:26.980> with<00:03:27.280> the<00:03:27.430> heck<00:03:27.639> even<00:03:27.940> though<00:03:28.120> the

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
reload with the heck even though the

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.420 
reload with the heck even though the
reloads<00:03:28.540> pretty<00:03:28.780> quick<00:03:29.130> you're<00:03:30.130> not<00:03:30.250> going<00:03:30.370> to

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
reloads pretty quick you're not going to

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.750 
reloads pretty quick you're not going to
have<00:03:30.519> to<00:03:30.609> reload<00:03:30.970> with<00:03:31.239> this<00:03:31.419> gun<00:03:31.799> but<00:03:32.799> the

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
have to reload with this gun but the

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.110 
have to reload with this gun but the
reload<00:03:34.030> is<00:03:34.120> also<00:03:34.389> pretty<00:03:34.750> fast<00:03:35.109> on<00:03:35.319> this<00:03:36.120> next

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
reload is also pretty fast on this next

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.659 
reload is also pretty fast on this next
pretty<00:03:37.480> decent<00:03:37.810> too<00:03:37.959> though<00:03:38.160> so<00:03:39.160> you<00:03:39.220> know<00:03:39.579> you

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:39.669 
pretty decent too though so you know you

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:41.819 
pretty decent too though so you know you
might<00:03:39.910> build<00:03:40.120> it<00:03:40.299> you<00:03:41.200> know<00:03:41.319> kill<00:03:41.590> a<00:03:41.620> couple

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
might build it you know kill a couple

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:44.129 
might build it you know kill a couple
guys<00:03:42.069> quicker<00:03:42.489> in<00:03:42.849> the<00:03:43.090> meantime<00:03:43.299> while<00:03:43.900> the

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:44.139 
guys quicker in the meantime while the

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:46.409 
guys quicker in the meantime while the
hex<00:03:44.380> you<00:03:44.680> know<00:03:44.829> reload<00:03:45.250> because<00:03:46.180> you<00:03:46.269> gotta

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:46.419 
hex you know reload because you gotta

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:48.809 
hex you know reload because you gotta
hold<00:03:46.599> 20<00:03:46.959> rounds<00:03:47.410> but<00:03:47.680> I<00:03:47.980> don't<00:03:48.549> really<00:03:48.700> think

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:48.819 
hold 20 rounds but I don't really think

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:51.569 
hold 20 rounds but I don't really think
that's<00:03:49.269> a<00:03:49.480> selling<00:03:49.750> point<00:03:50.139> I<00:03:50.440> mean<00:03:50.919> that's

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:51.579 
that's a selling point I mean that's

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:54.199 
that's a selling point I mean that's
just<00:03:52.000> on<00:03:52.239> like<00:03:52.569> some<00:03:52.840> lower-level<00:03:53.079> enemies

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
just on like some lower-level enemies

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:57.990 
just on like some lower-level enemies
when<00:03:55.209> the<00:03:56.099> enemies<00:03:57.099> get<00:03:57.519> much<00:03:57.730> higher<00:03:57.940> level

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
when the enemies get much higher level

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.750 
when the enemies get much higher level
especially<00:03:59.040> considering<00:04:00.040> you<00:04:00.310> know<00:04:00.340> neither

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
especially considering you know neither

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.300 
especially considering you know neither
this<00:04:01.060> weapon<00:04:01.480> or<00:04:01.629> the<00:04:01.780> heck<00:04:01.989> armor<00:04:02.349> ignore<00:04:02.590> so

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
this weapon or the heck armor ignore so

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.509 
this weapon or the heck armor ignore so
you<00:04:03.370> need<00:04:03.730> that<00:04:03.940> really<00:04:04.209> high<00:04:04.389> damage<00:04:04.750> and<00:04:05.519> the

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:06.519 
you need that really high damage and the

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:08.879 
you need that really high damage and the
heck<00:04:07.269> has<00:04:07.510> a<00:04:07.540> way<00:04:07.959> tighter<00:04:08.319> bullet<00:04:08.709> spread

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:08.889 
heck has a way tighter bullet spread

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:11.580 
heck has a way tighter bullet spread
which<00:04:09.190> is<00:04:09.370> you<00:04:09.879> really<00:04:10.209> want<00:04:10.419> that<00:04:10.590> forgetting

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
which is you really want that forgetting

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.170 
which is you really want that forgetting
all<00:04:11.799> your<00:04:11.980> damage<00:04:12.250> on<00:04:12.340> the<00:04:12.430> weak<00:04:12.579> spot<00:04:12.819> so<00:04:13.150> you

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
all your damage on the weak spot so you

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.569 
all your damage on the weak spot so you

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:15.579 
can do as much a full damage as you as

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:17.690 
can do as much a full damage as you as
you<00:04:15.760> could<00:04:15.970> possibly<00:04:16.090> get

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
you could possibly get

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.750 
you could possibly get
I<00:04:17.760> really<00:04:18.540> don't<00:04:18.690> see<00:04:18.780> this<00:04:19.440> gun<00:04:19.770> just<00:04:20.460> being

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
I really don't see this gun just being

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.260 
I really don't see this gun just being
you<00:04:21.060> know<00:04:21.180> that<00:04:21.390> great<00:04:21.690> at<00:04:21.810> all<00:04:22.040> you<00:04:23.040> i<00:04:23.490> would<00:04:23.970> i

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
you know that great at all you i would i

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.150 
you know that great at all you i would i
would<00:04:24.540> much<00:04:24.930> prefer<00:04:24.960> to<00:04:25.500> bring<00:04:25.620> the<00:04:25.740> heck<00:04:25.920> and

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
would much prefer to bring the heck and

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.310 
would much prefer to bring the heck and
that's<00:04:26.370> what<00:04:26.580> i<00:04:26.610> would<00:04:26.790> recommend<00:04:27.320> this

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
that's what i would recommend this

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.080 
that's what i would recommend this
doesn't<00:04:28.680> seem<00:04:28.770> like<00:04:28.920> a<00:04:28.950> bad<00:04:29.190> shotgun<00:04:29.580> but

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
doesn't seem like a bad shotgun but

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:31.990 
doesn't seem like a bad shotgun but
seems<00:04:30.630> like<00:04:30.780> it'd<00:04:30.930> be<00:04:31.050> more<00:04:31.260> for<00:04:31.530> lower-level

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
seems like it'd be more for lower-level

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.370 
seems like it'd be more for lower-level
enemies<00:04:33.000> and<00:04:34.070> maybe<00:04:35.070> mid<00:04:35.430> range<00:04:35.670> but<00:04:36.380> anything

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
enemies and maybe mid range but anything

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.370 
enemies and maybe mid range but anything
past<00:04:37.680> that<00:04:38.030> probably<00:04:39.030> up<00:04:39.240> in<00:04:39.390> like<00:04:39.600> Pluto<00:04:40.230> and

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380 
past that probably up in like Pluto and

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.160 
past that probably up in like Pluto and
what<00:04:40.590> not<00:04:40.800> fully<00:04:41.220> modded<00:04:41.840> you<00:04:42.840> know<00:04:42.960> you're

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:43.170 
what not fully modded you know you're

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:45.260 
what not fully modded you know you're
just<00:04:43.290> not<00:04:43.530> doing<00:04:43.890> the<00:04:44.010> damage<00:04:44.190> output<00:04:44.520> so

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
just not doing the damage output so

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:46.760 
just not doing the damage output so
whether<00:04:45.480> you<00:04:45.600> got<00:04:45.720> 20<00:04:46.020> rounds<00:04:46.290> or<00:04:46.350> not<00:04:46.530> you're

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
whether you got 20 rounds or not you're

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:47.900 
whether you got 20 rounds or not you're
going<00:04:46.860> to<00:04:46.950> be<00:04:47.010> sitting<00:04:47.220> there<00:04:47.400> shooting

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
going to be sitting there shooting

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.360 
going to be sitting there shooting
multiple<00:04:48.060> Tom's<00:04:48.590> whereas<00:04:49.590> the<00:04:49.830> heck's<00:04:50.040> gonna

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
multiple Tom's whereas the heck's gonna

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:55.280 
multiple Tom's whereas the heck's gonna
one<00:04:50.700> shot<00:04:51.710> this<00:04:52.710> is<00:04:53.180> what<00:04:54.180> I<00:04:54.210> think<00:04:54.630> I<00:04:54.810> haven't

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:55.290 
one shot this is what I think I haven't

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:59.960 
one shot this is what I think I haven't
fully<00:04:55.440> modded<00:04:55.980> it<00:04:56.100> yet<00:04:56.310> and<00:04:56.960> gone<00:04:57.960> and<00:04:58.230> did<00:04:58.970> you

fully modded it yet and gone and did you

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:03.860 
fully modded it yet and gone and did you
know<00:05:00.090> Pluto<00:05:00.540> and<00:05:00.690> whatnot<00:05:01.110> but<00:05:01.860> I<00:05:02.190> will<00:05:03.060> have

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:21.540 
of giving a general analysis this gun

of giving a general analysis this gun
and<00:05:21.900> I'm<00:05:21.990> really<00:05:22.230> letting<00:05:22.500> you<00:05:22.590> just<00:05:22.800> see<00:05:23.010> what

it does and then I'm gonna do you know a

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.900 
it does and then I'm gonna do you know a
detailed<00:05:27.350> you<00:05:28.350> know<00:05:28.470> revision<00:05:29.070> of<00:05:29.250> the<00:05:29.370> gun

detailed you know revision of the gun

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:33.770 
detailed you know revision of the gun
and<00:05:31.220> go<00:05:32.220> do<00:05:32.400> some<00:05:32.640> harder<00:05:32.910> enemies<00:05:33.300> and<00:05:33.570> talk

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780 
and go do some harder enemies and talk

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:35.540 
and go do some harder enemies and talk
about<00:05:33.990> it<00:05:34.260> I<00:05:34.530> wouldn't<00:05:35.040> be<00:05:35.130> able<00:05:35.190> to<00:05:35.280> do<00:05:35.400> that

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:35.550 
about it I wouldn't be able to do that

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:38.420 
about it I wouldn't be able to do that
now<00:05:35.760> because<00:05:36.380> it's<00:05:37.380> not<00:05:37.590> level<00:05:37.830> to<00:05:38.070> mod<00:05:38.280> up

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.430 
now because it's not level to mod up

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:43.550 
now because it's not level to mod up
anyways<00:05:39.380> but<00:05:41.540> its<00:05:42.540> disadvantage<00:05:43.260> you<00:05:43.440> know

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 
anyways but its disadvantage you know

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.500 
anyways but its disadvantage you know
other<00:05:43.770> than<00:05:43.890> the<00:05:44.250> resources<00:05:44.850> to<00:05:45.000> make<00:05:45.210> which

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:45.510 
other than the resources to make which

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:46.970 
other than the resources to make which
really<00:05:45.720> aren't<00:05:45.930> even<00:05:46.110> that<00:05:46.200> bow<00:05:46.440> in<00:05:46.740> a<00:05:46.830> while

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:46.980 
really aren't even that bow in a while

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:51.380 
really aren't even that bow in a while
wiki<00:05:47.250> says<00:05:47.490> that<00:05:47.760> is<00:05:49.970> it's<00:05:50.970> got<00:05:51.120> the<00:05:51.240> same

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:51.390 
wiki says that is it's got the same

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:53.300 
wiki says that is it's got the same
accuracy<00:05:51.780> about<00:05:52.320> the<00:05:52.440> same<00:05:52.620> fire<00:05:52.890> eight<00:05:53.130> it's

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:53.310 
accuracy about the same fire eight it's

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:56.000 
accuracy about the same fire eight it's
just<00:05:53.460> got<00:05:53.610> a<00:05:53.640> really<00:05:53.910> low<00:05:54.210> base<00:05:54.540> damage<00:05:55.010> but

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:56.010 
just got a really low base damage but

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:58.370 
just got a really low base damage but
the<00:05:56.130> upside<00:05:56.280> is<00:05:56.550> it's<00:05:56.940> got<00:05:57.150> a<00:05:57.480> lot<00:05:57.930> of<00:05:57.990> shells

00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:58.380 
the upside is it's got a lot of shells

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:01.460 
the upside is it's got a lot of shells
so<00:05:59.370> the<00:05:59.520> only<00:05:59.700> way<00:05:59.910> those<00:06:00.570> 20<00:06:00.960> clips<00:06:01.140> odds<00:06:01.350> is

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:01.470 
so the only way those 20 clips odds is

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:02.960 
so the only way those 20 clips odds is
really<00:06:01.680> going<00:06:01.770> to<00:06:01.860> matter<00:06:02.070> is<00:06:02.550> if<00:06:02.790> you're

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:02.970 
really going to matter is if you're

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:05.870 
really going to matter is if you're
still<00:06:03.000> going<00:06:03.420> to<00:06:03.480> be<00:06:03.570> one<00:06:03.870> shot<00:06:04.580> because<00:06:05.580> I'd

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:05.880 
still going to be one shot because I'd

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:08.450 
still going to be one shot because I'd
much<00:06:06.120> rather<00:06:06.150> just<00:06:06.930> put<00:06:07.470> two<00:06:07.680> more<00:06:07.860> bullets<00:06:08.280> in

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:08.460 
much rather just put two more bullets in

much rather just put two more bullets in

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:51.480 
it it's not going to matter so that's

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:52.880 
it it's not going to matter so that's
that's<00:06:51.810> the<00:06:51.990> only<00:06:52.260> way<00:06:52.410> it<00:06:52.590> would<00:06:52.680> really

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:52.890 
that's the only way it would really

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:54.710 
that's the only way it would really
matter<00:06:53.130> and<00:06:53.550> you'd<00:06:54.030> want<00:06:54.210> to<00:06:54.300> really<00:06:54.450> use<00:06:54.690> it

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:54.720 
matter and you'd want to really use it

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.900 
matter and you'd want to really use it
over<00:06:55.020> the<00:06:55.110> heck<00:06:55.320> i<00:06:55.530> mean<00:06:55.710> that's<00:06:55.860> just<00:06:55.950> kind<00:06:56.850> of

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:56.910 
over the heck i mean that's just kind of

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:59.960 
over the heck i mean that's just kind of
common<00:06:57.270> sense<00:06:57.480> so<00:06:58.440> I<00:06:58.800> mean<00:06:59.640> it's<00:06:59.790> worth

00:06:59.960 --> 00:06:59.970 
common sense so I mean it's worth

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:01.670 
common sense so I mean it's worth
getting<00:07:00.240> leveled<00:07:00.600> up<00:07:00.810> just<00:07:01.080> for<00:07:01.200> the<00:07:01.260> mastery

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:01.680 
getting leveled up just for the mastery

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:03.230 
getting leveled up just for the mastery
and<00:07:01.800> then<00:07:02.190> you<00:07:02.340> know<00:07:02.460> we'll<00:07:02.580> see<00:07:02.640> how<00:07:02.940> it<00:07:02.970> does

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:03.240 
and then you know we'll see how it does

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:05.360 
and then you know we'll see how it does
on<00:07:03.420> Pluto<00:07:03.840> and<00:07:03.930> whatnot<00:07:04.290> you<00:07:04.980> know<00:07:05.010> maybe

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:05.370 
on Pluto and whatnot you know maybe

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:08.620 
on Pluto and whatnot you know maybe
it'll<00:07:05.670> still<00:07:05.910> do<00:07:06.060> enough<00:07:06.300> damage<00:07:07.100> but<00:07:08.100> I

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:08.630 
it'll still do enough damage but I

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:11.000 
it'll still do enough damage but I
really<00:07:09.630> doubt<00:07:09.840> it<00:07:09.900> I<00:07:10.260> know<00:07:10.350> I<00:07:10.470> know<00:07:10.650> for<00:07:10.980> sure
