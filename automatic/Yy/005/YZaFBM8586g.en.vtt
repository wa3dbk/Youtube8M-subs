00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:31.349
 let's go to our wait where only the 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:33.899
 pigtail to be excused you break 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.630
 ok ok i'm not enough to calm down 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.910
 predominance of giving oneself know that c 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.820
 ramps you are wasted but do nothing for 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.469
 nothing to keep these calm 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.770
 rampe trump is like there was no one 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:55.379
 tomorrow obviously the ramps won't have to 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:59.149
 discount so we do so so come on 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:01.379
 from which you can do beasts 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:03.059
 exactly what I expected 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.369
 obviously the suter to this I think yes 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.810
 will add a bit of but road to 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.460
 one of these to be picked up 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.320
 slightly relative to each other so 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.010
 let's start a road is enough 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:17.810
 even a crap so to fix the 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.810
 then theoretically history 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.490
 ok so it's not often from dai 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:30.640
 come on from the gods 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:36.430
 no no, but they touched each other 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:39.910
 my mother estimates that almost almost people 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:43.390
 almost ok how to system that to do not 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:45.600
 I have the faintest idea but don't have it 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.210
 almost enough road 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:52.140
 but this is how this inspires me 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:54.110
 still inspires no mid-air but what does it know 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.310
 good that just the march you have 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.960
 I discovered a very small thing 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.180
 then you see this and layout I was 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.979
 trying to use but I was the 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.229
 budget even if things make it 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.570
 about I'm above the budget so it doesn't go 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.910
 well but shortening the components of 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.530
 this deal to see curtain also 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.860
 peace less wood is used less 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.750
 squares league splash spends 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.819
 obviously but I also thought so 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:22.110
 doing things this way 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:27.269
 they endure they cost less or you see there 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:31.530
 we almost did as we go 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:33.180
 so oh my god but so or in half an hour 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.819
 I'm trying this thing go 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.480
 perfect great 8 we did it 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:42.150
 passed to the next was a birth 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:44.130
 Double where they must pass two things that 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.410
 joy we also have the other links 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.880
 we have studied 8 want to see who I am 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:54.209
 exactly the pieces in the uptake release 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:57.320
 some surprise iceman pathos click 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:03:01.829
 now we have 12 distinct available 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:08.640
 we have cables we can make ad 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:13.860
 tall example but the cruise chief 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:15.209
 the high hollow that holds it and that 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.420
 steel leave to make all ours 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:20.970
 cazzatine yes 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.400
 if instead we made a bridge with one 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.320
 only one giant bridge that opens 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.640
 it opens intense or my god would be wonderful 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.380
 here's what I want to do 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.300
 I discovered what I want to make life to 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:36.030
 bridge that opens in the middle even if they are 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:39.540
 very bad iron qua media trial 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:42.480
 hydraulic lift it then I put the 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:48.000
 iron bring us authors here 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:55.310
 we wanted or my god seems to be working for 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:55.310
 moment the puncture you can what 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.230
 let's try so little changes 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:14.760
 small adjustments to make it work 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:16.680
 an uncertain wobbly bridge without 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.920
 self-esteem sure of what is 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.920
 doing 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:25.530
 I don't even know what I'm doing but 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:27.480
 however the idea of ​​making a single bridge 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.100
 there is a single opening is perfect 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.590
 because there are two passing ships 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:33.150
 simultaneously and I don't think that with 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:38.300
 a bridge something can be achieved 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:38.300
 like two openings would be a mess 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:48.300
 better than that it works better than that 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:50.130
 no small adjustments by you give by the give 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:54.360
 by the by by the gods 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:57.360
 you want to do it I don't know if it will succeed to 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:59.220
 return to the truth but for the moment it seems 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:03.350
 work seems to resist at least the 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.350
 weight lifting looking at her rolex 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:09.810
 he made flop I'm not even looking 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:12.030
 bent over crying with cables will go 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:13.410
 better I promptly cavetti do not know 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:15.050
 yes that things will change over the 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:17.539
 budget but 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:19.610
 much better without it 

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:20.900
 problems and now let's see if they can 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:24.849
 join up correctly 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.849
 they split as usual 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:37.879
 Oh my God 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:41.849
 no no no no no no I was about to do 

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:43.919
 exclaimed, I invoked the gentleman because 

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:46.229
 he came down on this bridge and rendered it 

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:50.580
 solid actually not the yield even more 

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:57.030
 powerless or my god it worked I don't know 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:58.889
 what changed no no no no it happened 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:02.310
 because the first van was able to 

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:06.199
 pass according to this beautiful bridge 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:06.199
 which fluctuates very reassuringly 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.800
 okay i'm going to tell you it would be enough 

00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:18.629
 never on the bridge like that but I imagine that 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:20.300
 the answer is no by give by for 

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:24.360
 please please 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:27.389
 and we don't know how to make it understood 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:29.699
 more precise than ever but makes it to do 

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:33.270
 this bridge is also the balloon jump us 

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:35.099
 I know nothing if I feel like doing it 

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:37.199
 let's try ok we try 

00:06:35.099 --> 00:06:40.560
 I don't assure you anything you have to use 

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:42.349
 or my god what is not this thing is the 

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:47.490
 ramp with i am absolutely happy but 

00:06:42.349 --> 00:06:50.699
 god is a jumping ball if there 

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:53.909
 went through unlimited of everything 

00:06:50.699 --> 00:06:56.379
 people here will take years 

00:06:53.909 --> 00:06:58.089
 let's make this level people 

00:06:56.379 --> 00:07:00.189
 I leave for the next episode because 

00:06:58.089 --> 00:07:02.409
 saras between complicated I wanted to do 

00:07:00.189 --> 00:07:05.199
 this too, but look how much of a gag 

00:07:02.409 --> 00:07:08.080
 stuff is to be done then to prose podiodio 

00:07:05.199 --> 00:07:09.309
 always on modest bridge poles 

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:11.710
 next I recommend don't forget 

00:07:09.309 --> 00:07:13.419
 to make a nice trip is a comment 

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:15.819
 saying the case of this deal travel 

00:07:13.419 --> 00:07:17.889
 if you also want the sandbox in the future 

00:07:15.819 --> 00:07:19.749
 give me your suggestions because esp 

00:07:17.889 --> 00:07:20.889
 the senses managed to get up to 

00:07:19.749 --> 00:07:22.029
 this point is not attacking us 

00:07:20.889 --> 00:07:26.249
 unfortunately fate 

00:07:22.029 --> 00:07:26.249
 then to the next episode
