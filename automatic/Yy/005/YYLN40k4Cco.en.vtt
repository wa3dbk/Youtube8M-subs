Hall for base defense this is the best

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.360 
Hall for base defense this is the best
base<00:00:06.810> defense<00:00:07.230> for<00:00:07.410> Town<00:00:07.589> Hall<00:00:07.799> for<00:00:08.099> in<00:00:08.220> my

base defense for Town Hall for in my

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:09.919 
base defense for Town Hall for in my

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
opinion so we can see there we got our

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.049 
opinion so we can see there we got our
town<00:00:10.170> hall<00:00:10.320> four<00:00:10.620> so<00:00:11.309> right<00:00:11.580> away<00:00:11.670> we<00:00:11.759> got<00:00:11.940> our

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
town hall four so right away we got our

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.720 
town hall four so right away we got our
mortar<00:00:12.450> very<00:00:12.929> centralized<00:00:13.590> covers<00:00:14.549> off

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
mortar very centralized covers off

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.880 
mortar very centralized covers off
pretty<00:00:15.210> much<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.630> entire<00:00:16.049> base<00:00:16.470> the<00:00:16.680> only

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
pretty much the entire base the only

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.210 
pretty much the entire base the only
thing<00:00:17.039> that's<00:00:17.220> left<00:00:17.310> out<00:00:17.609> is<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:18.830> air<00:00:19.830> defense

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
thing that's left out is the air defense

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.099 
thing that's left out is the air defense
and<00:00:20.490> a<00:00:20.550> bit<00:00:20.789> of<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.000> top<00:00:21.210> of<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.420> base<00:00:21.600> but<00:00:21.630> I

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
and a bit of the top of the base but I

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.019 
and a bit of the top of the base but I
believe<00:00:22.380> this<00:00:22.560> is<00:00:22.619> most<00:00:23.189> central<00:00:23.640> you<00:00:23.760> can<00:00:23.880> get

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
believe this is most central you can get

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.970 
believe this is most central you can get
it<00:00:24.150> so<00:00:24.660> we<00:00:24.720> have<00:00:24.810> our<00:00:24.900> air<00:00:25.050> defense<00:00:25.439> also

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
it so we have our air defense also

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.009 
it so we have our air defense also
somewhat<00:00:26.609> centralized<00:00:27.180> it's<00:00:27.449> protected<00:00:27.990> by

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
somewhat centralized it's protected by

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.990 
somewhat centralized it's protected by
walls<00:00:28.410> so<00:00:28.980> we<00:00:29.010> got<00:00:29.160> our<00:00:29.250> archer<00:00:29.580> tower<00:00:29.760> it

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
walls so we got our archer tower it

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.999 
walls so we got our archer tower it
covers<00:00:30.390> off<00:00:30.539> pretty<00:00:30.869> much<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.500> entire<00:00:31.769> base

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
covers off pretty much the entire base

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.130 
covers off pretty much the entire base
it's<00:00:32.250> about<00:00:32.430> 90%<00:00:33.120> of<00:00:33.180> our<00:00:33.270> base<00:00:33.480> is<00:00:33.690> covered<00:00:33.870> by

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
it's about 90% of our base is covered by

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.889 
it's about 90% of our base is covered by
that<00:00:34.350> one<00:00:34.770> Archer<00:00:35.160> tower<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:36.480> same<00:00:36.690> thing

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
that one Archer tower and the same thing

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.180 
that one Archer tower and the same thing
with<00:00:37.020> this<00:00:37.140> one<00:00:37.200> here<00:00:37.469> so<00:00:37.649> about<00:00:37.739> ninety

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
with this one here so about ninety

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.319 
with this one here so about ninety
percent<00:00:38.219> of<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.700> base<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.090> only<00:00:39.210> thing

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
percent of the base the only thing

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.060 
percent of the base the only thing
that's<00:00:39.450> not<00:00:39.600> covered<00:00:39.780> is<00:00:39.960> that<00:00:40.110> one<00:00:40.379> cannon<00:00:40.950> at

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
that's not covered is that one cannon at

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.490 
that's not covered is that one cannon at
the<00:00:41.100> bottom<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:42.559> far-left<00:00:45.260> army<00:00:46.260> camp

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
the bottom and the far-left army camp

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.279 
the bottom and the far-left army camp
there<00:00:47.059> so<00:00:48.059> you<00:00:48.329> can<00:00:48.480> see<00:00:48.629> we've<00:00:48.780> got<00:00:48.809> spring

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
there so you can see we've got spring

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.869 
there so you can see we've got spring
traps<00:00:49.620> at<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.129> top<00:00:50.309> there<00:00:50.550> so<00:00:50.670> we<00:00:50.730> have<00:00:50.850> a

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
traps at the top there so we have a

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.729 
traps at the top there so we have a
couple<00:00:51.059> indented<00:00:51.750> walls<00:00:51.960> you<00:00:52.320> can<00:00:52.440> sort<00:00:52.680> of

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
couple indented walls you can sort of

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.040 
couple indented walls you can sort of
see<00:00:52.920> there's<00:00:53.129> two<00:00:53.280> indented<00:00:54.210> walls<00:00:54.420> so<00:00:54.960> if

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
see there's two indented walls so if

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.420 
see there's two indented walls so if
they<00:00:55.170> break<00:00:55.410> in<00:00:55.620> through<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.920> top<00:00:56.129> they

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
they break in through the top they

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.979 
they break in through the top they
either<00:00:56.579> go<00:00:56.850> for<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.120> air<00:00:57.239> defense<00:00:57.629> in<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.840> hid

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
either go for the air defense in the hid

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.479 
either go for the air defense in the hid
spring<00:00:58.289> trap<00:00:58.530> or<00:00:58.739> they<00:00:58.829> go<00:00:58.949> for<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.190> archer

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
spring trap or they go for the archer

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.400 
spring trap or they go for the archer
tower<00:00:59.670> and<00:00:59.850> hit<00:00:59.940> a<00:00:59.969> spring<00:01:00.270> trap<00:01:00.510> so<00:01:01.170> at<00:01:01.320> the

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
tower and hit a spring trap so at the

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.219 
tower and hit a spring trap so at the
bottom<00:01:01.590> we<00:01:01.829> have<00:01:01.859> our<00:01:02.039> cannons<00:01:02.489> they're<00:01:02.699> both

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:03.229 
bottom we have our cannons they're both

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:05.719 
bottom we have our cannons they're both
cordoned<00:01:04.229> off<00:01:04.350> you<00:01:05.040> can<00:01:05.189> see<00:01:05.369> they<00:01:05.519> cover

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
cordoned off you can see they cover

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.730 
cordoned off you can see they cover
quite<00:01:06.000> a<00:01:06.030> bit<00:01:06.210> of<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.390> base<00:01:06.540> about<00:01:06.720> 60%<00:01:07.560> of<00:01:07.619> the

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
quite a bit of the base about 60% of the

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.010 
quite a bit of the base about 60% of the
base<00:01:07.920> is<00:01:08.130> covered<00:01:08.280> off<00:01:08.549> by<00:01:08.760> these<00:01:08.909> cannons<00:01:09.360> but

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
base is covered off by these cannons but

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.960 
base is covered off by these cannons but
they<00:01:10.200> cover<00:01:10.470> off<00:01:10.710> our<00:01:10.920> resources<00:01:11.490> so<00:01:11.790> that's

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
they cover off our resources so that's

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.460 
they cover off our resources so that's
key<00:01:12.240> that<00:01:12.420> our<00:01:12.540> resources<00:01:12.869> are<00:01:13.110> gonna<00:01:13.350> be

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
key that our resources are gonna be

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.700 
key that our resources are gonna be
protected<00:01:13.950> there<00:01:14.100> our<00:01:14.820> clan<00:01:15.150> castle<00:01:15.710> it's

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
protected there our clan castle it's

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.859 
protected there our clan castle it's
somewhat<00:01:17.009> centralized<00:01:17.400> we<00:01:17.580> covers<00:01:18.030> about<00:01:18.119> 50%

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
somewhat centralized we covers about 50%

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.020 
somewhat centralized we covers about 50%
of<00:01:18.900> our<00:01:19.049> base<00:01:19.259> so<00:01:20.070> as<00:01:20.310> long<00:01:20.460> as<00:01:20.549> they<00:01:20.729> come

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
of our base so as long as they come

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.350 
of our base so as long as they come
anywhere<00:01:21.390> near<00:01:21.680> the<00:01:23.030> resources<00:01:24.030> our<00:01:24.150> clan

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
anywhere near the resources our clan

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.609 
anywhere near the resources our clan
castle<00:01:24.689> troops<00:01:24.720> are<00:01:24.960> gonna<00:01:25.049> come<00:01:25.290> out<00:01:25.439> there

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
castle troops are gonna come out there

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.620 
castle troops are gonna come out there
so<00:01:26.250> we<00:01:26.340> put<00:01:26.490> our<00:01:26.580> bombs<00:01:26.820> down<00:01:27.119> at<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.330> bottom

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
so we put our bombs down at the bottom

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.080 
so we put our bombs down at the bottom
here<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:27.930> protect<00:01:28.110> our<00:01:28.409> mortar<00:01:28.850> these<00:01:29.850> bombs

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
here to protect our mortar these bombs

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.060 
here to protect our mortar these bombs
can<00:01:30.329> really<00:01:30.600> be<00:01:30.720> moved<00:01:30.990> anywhere<00:01:31.380> depending

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
can really be moved anywhere depending

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.859 
can really be moved anywhere depending
on<00:01:32.460> where<00:01:32.670> you<00:01:32.939> find<00:01:33.180> people<00:01:33.390> are<00:01:33.570> attacking

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
on where you find people are attacking

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.020 
on where you find people are attacking
the<00:01:34.140> most<00:01:34.350> if<00:01:34.680> you<00:01:35.070> find<00:01:35.310> people<00:01:35.490> are<00:01:35.700> talking

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.490 
the most if you find people are talking
at<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.240> top<00:01:36.450> a<00:01:36.479> lot<00:01:36.689> you<00:01:36.869> can<00:01:37.020> put<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.290> bombs

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
at the top a lot you can put the bombs

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.010 
at the top a lot you can put the bombs
at<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.829> top<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.490> we<00:01:39.270> have<00:01:39.299> three<00:01:39.689> builders

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
at the top and we have three builders

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.020 
at the top and we have three builders
Hut's<00:01:40.229> which<00:01:40.439> we've<00:01:40.650> placed<00:01:40.950> in<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.520> corners

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
Hut's which we've placed in the corners

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.240 
Hut's which we've placed in the corners
to<00:01:42.299> prevent<00:01:42.780> people<00:01:43.020> from<00:01:43.140> 100%<00:01:43.619> of<00:01:43.920> our<00:01:44.009> base

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
to prevent people from 100% of our base

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.389 
to prevent people from 100% of our base
hoping<00:01:44.759> that<00:01:44.909> they<00:01:45.030> run<00:01:45.210> out<00:01:45.360> of<00:01:45.390> time<00:01:46.399> all

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
hoping that they run out of time all

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.940 
hoping that they run out of time all
right<00:01:47.700> so<00:01:47.850> we<00:01:47.970> have<00:01:48.000> our<00:01:48.630> golden<00:01:49.590> elixir

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
right so we have our golden elixir

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.060 
right so we have our golden elixir
storages<00:01:50.700> in<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.939> middle<00:01:51.180> there<00:01:51.680> so<00:01:52.680> we<00:01:52.950> can

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
storages in the middle there so we can

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.969 
storages in the middle there so we can
look<00:01:53.220> here<00:01:53.490> we<00:01:53.759> got<00:01:53.909> our<00:01:54.060> base<00:01:54.780> defense<00:01:55.320> so<00:01:55.740> all

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
look here we got our base defense so all

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.850 
look here we got our base defense so all
winds<00:01:56.250> we<00:01:56.520> haven't<00:01:56.759> lost<00:01:56.939> on<00:01:57.119> this<00:01:57.270> base<00:01:57.479> yet

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
winds we haven't lost on this base yet

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.820 
winds we haven't lost on this base yet
so<00:01:58.860> we<00:01:58.950> go<00:01:59.070> ahead<00:01:59.189> and<00:01:59.280> play<00:01:59.399> a<00:01:59.430> replay<00:01:59.820> for<00:02:00.060> you

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.930 

all<00:02:03.830> right<00:02:04.100> so<00:02:04.250> you<00:02:04.340> can<00:02:04.430> see<00:02:04.580> there's<00:02:04.790> some

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
all right so you can see there's some

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.340 
all right so you can see there's some
tombstones<00:02:05.510> laying<00:02:05.840> around<00:02:05.960> so<00:02:06.229> we've

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
tombstones laying around so we've

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.200 
tombstones laying around so we've
already<00:02:06.470> been<00:02:06.710> attacked<00:02:07.070> while<00:02:07.340> this<00:02:07.550> replay

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:08.210 
already been attacked while this replay

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.600 
already been attacked while this replay
is<00:02:08.330> going<00:02:08.720> so<00:02:09.050> this<00:02:09.679> isn't<00:02:09.979> the<00:02:10.039> first<00:02:10.220> attack

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
is going so this isn't the first attack

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.090 
is going so this isn't the first attack
on<00:02:10.759> our<00:02:10.820> base<00:02:11.140> so<00:02:12.140> this<00:02:12.260> guy's<00:02:12.440> gonna<00:02:12.620> go<00:02:12.890> with

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
on our base so this guy's gonna go with

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.890 
on our base so this guy's gonna go with
his<00:02:13.220> giants<00:02:13.700> kind<00:02:13.940> of<00:02:14.030> everywhere<00:02:14.450> so<00:02:14.660> we<00:02:14.720> kind

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
his giants kind of everywhere so we kind

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.740 
his giants kind of everywhere so we kind
of<00:02:14.990> as<00:02:15.080> a<00:02:15.110> haphazard<00:02:15.560> attack<00:02:16.459> Giants<00:02:17.420> all<00:02:17.540> over

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
of as a haphazard attack Giants all over

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:18.280 
of as a haphazard attack Giants all over
the<00:02:17.840> place

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
the place

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.040 
the place
our<00:02:19.190> walls<00:02:19.459> aren't<00:02:19.700> upgraded<00:02:20.360> to<00:02:20.480> the<00:02:20.600> max<00:02:20.810> but

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
our walls aren't upgraded to the max but

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.110 
our walls aren't upgraded to the max but
they<00:02:21.170> are<00:02:21.290> level<00:02:21.650> 3<00:02:21.950> so<00:02:22.190> if<00:02:22.640> you<00:02:22.850> only<00:02:22.970> have

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
they are level 3 so if you only have

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.699 
they are level 3 so if you only have
level<00:02:23.390> 1<00:02:23.570> or<00:02:23.720> 2<00:02:23.840> Giants<00:02:24.200> it's<00:02:24.320> gonna<00:02:24.410> take<00:02:24.680> a

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
level 1 or 2 Giants it's gonna take a

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:26.290 
level 1 or 2 Giants it's gonna take a
while<00:02:24.950> without<00:02:25.310> wall<00:02:25.550> breakers<00:02:25.940> to<00:02:26.090> break

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
while without wall breakers to break

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.800 
while without wall breakers to break
those<00:02:26.510> walls<00:02:26.810> down<00:02:27.940> so<00:02:28.940> we<00:02:29.060> can<00:02:29.180> see<00:02:29.330> drops<00:02:29.630> a

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
those walls down so we can see drops a

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.900 
those walls down so we can see drops a
couple<00:02:30.050> more<00:02:30.170> Giants<00:02:30.620> at<00:02:30.709> the<00:02:30.830> top<00:02:31.070> still

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
couple more Giants at the top still

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.699 
couple more Giants at the top still
hasn't<00:02:32.240> broken<00:02:32.330> through<00:02:32.690> any<00:02:32.840> walls<00:02:33.080> really

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
hasn't broken through any walls really

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:35.290 
hasn't broken through any walls really
need<00:02:33.950> wall<00:02:34.160> breakers<00:02:34.580> really<00:02:34.880> to<00:02:35.000> get<00:02:35.090> through

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
need wall breakers really to get through

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.210 
need wall breakers really to get through
these<00:02:35.450> walls<00:02:35.660> but<00:02:35.840> if<00:02:35.930> you<00:02:35.989> don't<00:02:36.170> have<00:02:36.320> high

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
these walls but if you don't have high

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.699 
these walls but if you don't have high
enough<00:02:37.400> Giants<00:02:37.910> so<00:02:38.900> his<00:02:39.080> Giants<00:02:39.470> are<00:02:39.560> just

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
enough Giants so his Giants are just

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:41.620 
enough Giants so his Giants are just
gonna<00:02:39.860> stand<00:02:40.100> there<00:02:40.250> and<00:02:40.430> and<00:02:40.760> hit<00:02:41.360> away<00:02:41.540> at

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
gonna stand there and and hit away at

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.060 
gonna stand there and and hit away at
the<00:02:41.720> walls<00:02:41.930> and<00:02:42.290> they're<00:02:42.440> gonna<00:02:42.590> eventually

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
the walls and they're gonna eventually

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.610 
the walls and they're gonna eventually
just<00:02:43.370> gonna<00:02:43.520> get<00:02:43.670> picked<00:02:43.850> off<00:02:44.140> so<00:02:45.140> he<00:02:45.230> doesn't

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
just gonna get picked off so he doesn't

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.920 
just gonna get picked off so he doesn't
manage<00:02:45.920> to<00:02:46.190> break<00:02:46.370> through<00:02:46.670> at<00:02:46.970> the<00:02:47.209> top<00:02:47.600> left

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
manage to break through at the top left

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.170 
manage to break through at the top left
so<00:02:48.830> you<00:02:48.920> can<00:02:49.040> see<00:02:49.220> dumps<00:02:49.790> a<00:02:49.850> bunch<00:02:50.060> of

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
so you can see dumps a bunch of

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.490 
so you can see dumps a bunch of
barbarians<00:02:50.450> to<00:02:50.870> go<00:02:50.959> for<00:02:51.170> that<00:02:51.260> elixir

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
barbarians to go for that elixir

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.500 
barbarians to go for that elixir
collector<00:02:52.070> elixir<00:02:52.670> collectors<00:02:53.060> pretty<00:02:53.300> full

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
collector elixir collectors pretty full

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:54.430 
collector elixir collectors pretty full
so<00:02:53.630> he's<00:02:53.750> gonna<00:02:53.840> get<00:02:53.989> a<00:02:54.050> good<00:02:54.200> amount<00:02:54.410> of

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
so he's gonna get a good amount of

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.009 
so he's gonna get a good amount of
resources<00:02:54.830> from<00:02:55.130> us<00:02:55.250> for<00:02:55.430> that<00:02:55.660> our<00:02:56.660> mortar

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
resources from us for that our mortar

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:58.780 
resources from us for that our mortar
can<00:02:57.260> hit<00:02:57.470> them<00:02:57.620> so<00:02:57.769> our<00:02:57.890> mortars<00:02:58.160> gonna<00:02:58.340> shoot

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
can hit them so our mortars gonna shoot

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.030 
can hit them so our mortars gonna shoot
down<00:02:58.820> at<00:02:59.120> those<00:02:59.300> barbarians<00:02:59.780> his<00:03:00.590> Giants

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
down at those barbarians his Giants

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.740 
down at those barbarians his Giants
gonna<00:03:01.160> go<00:03:01.310> for<00:03:01.519> that<00:03:01.640> aired<00:03:01.880> air<00:03:02.150> defense<00:03:02.540> and

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
gonna go for that aired air defense and

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.020 
gonna go for that aired air defense and
boom<00:03:03.110> that<00:03:03.350> spring<00:03:03.769> trap<00:03:03.980> works<00:03:04.250> shoots<00:03:04.820> him

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
boom that spring trap works shoots him

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.960 
boom that spring trap works shoots him
away<00:03:05.570> from<00:03:05.630> that<00:03:05.870> air<00:03:06.019> defense<00:03:06.340> so<00:03:07.340> our<00:03:07.640> mortar

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
away from that air defense so our mortar

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.340 
away from that air defense so our mortar
is<00:03:08.030> just<00:03:08.239> going<00:03:08.360> to<00:03:08.450> go<00:03:08.900> on<00:03:08.930> to<00:03:09.230> these

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
is just going to go on to these

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.199 
is just going to go on to these
barbarians<00:03:09.799> you<00:03:10.130> can<00:03:10.250> see<00:03:10.430> basically<00:03:10.880> every

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
barbarians you can see basically every

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:12.910 
barbarians you can see basically every
defense<00:03:11.570> is<00:03:11.750> hitting<00:03:12.019> those<00:03:12.170> barbarians<00:03:12.620> with

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
defense is hitting those barbarians with

in the process

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.039 
in the process
see<00:04:15.650> 4%<00:04:16.370> even<00:04:16.820> goes<00:04:16.940> to<00:04:17.060> drop<00:04:17.269> his<00:04:17.389> clan<00:04:17.630> castle

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
see 4% even goes to drop his clan castle

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:22.180 
see 4% even goes to drop his clan castle
but<00:04:18.260> it's<00:04:19.070> not<00:04:19.220> gonna<00:04:19.340> do<00:04:19.549> anything<00:04:21.010> so<00:04:22.010> he

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
but it's not gonna do anything so he

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:23.830 
but it's not gonna do anything so he
didn't<00:04:22.430> break<00:04:22.610> through<00:04:22.880> any<00:04:23.000> walls<00:04:23.330> there<00:04:23.630> so

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
didn't break through any walls there so

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.070 
didn't break through any walls there so
another<00:04:24.410> good<00:04:24.590> defense

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
another good defense

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.990 
another good defense
so<00:04:27.080> his<00:04:27.199> clan<00:04:27.470> castle<00:04:27.919> is<00:04:28.040> just<00:04:28.340> gonna<00:04:28.460> fire

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
so his clan castle is just gonna fire

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.580 
so his clan castle is just gonna fire
away<00:04:29.180> at<00:04:29.300> my<00:04:29.419> clan<00:04:29.690> castle<00:04:30.080> troops<00:04:30.350> and

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
away at my clan castle troops and

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.260 
away at my clan castle troops and
eventually<00:04:31.550> he's<00:04:31.669> just<00:04:31.820> gonna<00:04:31.910> get<00:04:32.090> picked

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
eventually he's just gonna get picked

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.980 
eventually he's just gonna get picked
off<00:04:32.449> so<00:04:33.020> pretty<00:04:33.740> good<00:04:33.889> base<00:04:34.040> defense<00:04:34.430> there

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
off so pretty good base defense there

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
off so pretty good base defense there
wasn't<00:04:35.990> able<00:04:36.080> to<00:04:36.229> break<00:04:36.440> through<00:04:36.620> any<00:04:36.770> walls

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010 
wasn't able to break through any walls

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:38.710 
wasn't able to break through any walls
and<00:04:37.280> did<00:04:37.460> a<00:04:37.490> relatively<00:04:38.090> low<00:04:38.330> amount<00:04:38.600> of

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
and did a relatively low amount of

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.379 
and did a relatively low amount of
percentage<00:04:39.260> of<00:04:39.380> damage<00:04:39.710> here<00:04:40.030> so<00:04:41.030> we<00:04:41.270> have

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:41.389 
percentage of damage here so we have

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:44.140 
percentage of damage here so we have
another<00:04:41.630> defensive<00:04:42.440> video<00:04:43.220> for<00:04:43.490> you<00:04:43.610> one<00:04:43.970> with

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
into this this base defense so you can

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:58.750 
into this this base defense so you can
see<00:04:57.320> this<00:04:57.530> one<00:04:57.740> our<00:04:57.889> air<00:04:58.070> defense<00:04:58.400> wasn't

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:58.760 
see this one our air defense wasn't

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.159 
see this one our air defense wasn't
finished<00:04:59.060> yet<00:04:59.300> so<00:04:59.450> this<00:04:59.720> is<00:04:59.810> one<00:04:59.960> of<00:04:59.990> our

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:00.169 
finished yet so this is one of our

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:02.409 
finished yet so this is one of our
earlier<00:05:00.470> defense<00:05:00.830> so<00:05:01.550> this<00:05:01.700> guy<00:05:01.910> was<00:05:02.120> one<00:05:02.330> of

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:02.419 
earlier defense so this guy was one of

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:03.730 
earlier defense so this guy was one of
the<00:05:02.510> only<00:05:02.660> ones<00:05:02.840> that<00:05:02.870> actually<00:05:03.050> used<00:05:03.440> wall

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:03.740 
the only ones that actually used wall

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.110 
the only ones that actually used wall
breaker<00:05:03.979> so<00:05:04.160> it's<00:05:04.250> gonna<00:05:04.370> be<00:05:04.520> easier<00:05:04.820> for<00:05:04.850> him

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 
breaker so it's gonna be easier for him

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.480 
breaker so it's gonna be easier for him
to<00:05:05.210> get<00:05:05.300> his<00:05:05.530> his<00:05:06.530> Giants<00:05:07.010> in<00:05:07.100> there<00:05:07.250> so<00:05:07.370> his

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:07.490 
to get his his Giants in there so his

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:08.680 
to get his his Giants in there so his
Giants<00:05:07.789> are<00:05:07.850> gonna<00:05:07.970> go<00:05:08.090> for<00:05:08.180> that<00:05:08.270> Archer

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:08.690 
Giants are gonna go for that Archer

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:11.080 
Giants are gonna go for that Archer
Archer<00:05:09.620> tower<00:05:10.070> at<00:05:10.190> the<00:05:10.220> top<00:05:10.280> you<00:05:10.639> can<00:05:10.669> see<00:05:10.789> the

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.090 
Archer tower at the top you can see the

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.480 
Archer tower at the top you can see the
top<00:05:11.330> left<00:05:11.570> is<00:05:11.780> a<00:05:11.810> very<00:05:12.200> popular<00:05:12.650> spot<00:05:13.220> for

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:13.490 
top left is a very popular spot for

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.159 
top left is a very popular spot for
people<00:05:13.729> to<00:05:13.820> go<00:05:13.940> in<00:05:14.120> so<00:05:14.750> it<00:05:14.840> seems<00:05:15.020> like

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:15.169 
people to go in so it seems like

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:16.420 
people to go in so it seems like
everyone<00:05:15.440> wants<00:05:15.560> to<00:05:15.710> go<00:05:15.830> through<00:05:16.010> that<00:05:16.190> top

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
everyone wants to go through that top

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.460 
everyone wants to go through that top
left<00:05:16.669> corner<00:05:17.060> mainly<00:05:17.990> because<00:05:18.169> that's<00:05:18.320> where

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:18.470 
left corner mainly because that's where

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:20.920 
left corner mainly because that's where
all<00:05:18.500> the<00:05:18.650> resources<00:05:18.830> are<00:05:19.340> which<00:05:20.210> which<00:05:20.660> helps

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:20.930 
all the resources are which which helps

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:22.090 
all the resources are which which helps
us<00:05:20.990> out<00:05:21.169> actually<00:05:21.320> because<00:05:21.470> we<00:05:21.680> have<00:05:21.770> three

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:22.100 
us out actually because we have three

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:23.590 
us out actually because we have three
defenses<00:05:22.639> at<00:05:22.760> the<00:05:22.850> bottom<00:05:23.150> that<00:05:23.180> are<00:05:23.419> not

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:23.600 
defenses at the bottom that are not

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.000 
defenses at the bottom that are not
going<00:05:23.810> to<00:05:23.870> be<00:05:23.960> touch<00:05:24.350> so<00:05:24.590> they're<00:05:24.710> just<00:05:24.860> gonna

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.010 
going to be touch so they're just gonna

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:27.040 
going to be touch so they're just gonna
shoot<00:05:25.850> at<00:05:25.970> the<00:05:26.090> army<00:05:26.330> basically<00:05:26.690> the<00:05:26.780> entire

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.050 
shoot at the army basically the entire

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:28.900 
shoot at the army basically the entire
time<00:05:27.380> so<00:05:27.410> our<00:05:27.800> clan<00:05:28.039> castle<00:05:28.430> gets<00:05:28.580> triggered

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:28.910 
time so our clan castle gets triggered

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:31.450 
time so our clan castle gets triggered
when<00:05:29.090> he<00:05:29.150> goes<00:05:29.270> through<00:05:29.300> and<00:05:29.950> our<00:05:30.950> spring-trap

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460 
when he goes through and our spring-trap

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.250 
when he goes through and our spring-trap
goes<00:05:31.669> off<00:05:31.880> and<00:05:32.180> he<00:05:32.570> loses<00:05:32.960> a<00:05:32.990> bunch<00:05:33.200> of

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:33.260 
goes off and he loses a bunch of

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.550 
goes off and he loses a bunch of
barbarians<00:05:33.740> from<00:05:33.830> that<00:05:34.510> so<00:05:35.510> now<00:05:36.229> that<00:05:36.289> they're

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 
barbarians from that so now that they're

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:37.719 
barbarians from that so now that they're
in<00:05:36.650> the<00:05:36.710> center<00:05:36.919> they're<00:05:37.130> gonna<00:05:37.220> get<00:05:37.400> hit<00:05:37.580> by

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:37.729 
in the center they're gonna get hit by

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:40.089 
in the center they're gonna get hit by
both<00:05:38.120> cannons<00:05:38.570> and<00:05:38.750> the<00:05:38.810> mortar<00:05:39.169> and<00:05:39.320> our<00:05:39.830> clan

00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:40.099 
both cannons and the mortar and our clan

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:41.260 
both cannons and the mortar and our clan
castle<00:05:40.430> troops<00:05:40.460> are<00:05:40.729> going<00:05:40.849> to<00:05:40.910> come<00:05:41.060> out

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:41.270 
castle troops are going to come out

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:44.890 
castle troops are going to come out
though<00:05:42.910> so<00:05:43.910> you<00:05:44.030> can<00:05:44.150> see<00:05:44.330> a<00:05:44.360> bunch<00:05:44.750> of

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:44.900 
though so you can see a bunch of

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:53.200 
though so you can see a bunch of
successful<00:05:45.560> defends<00:05:46.400> there<00:05:51.130> alright<00:05:52.130> so<00:05:52.700> for

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:53.210 
successful defends there alright so for

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:54.520 
successful defends there alright so for
me<00:05:53.300> I<00:05:53.330> think<00:05:53.510> this<00:05:53.780> is<00:05:53.840> probably<00:05:54.110> the<00:05:54.320> best

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:54.530 
me I think this is probably the best

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:56.469 
me I think this is probably the best
base<00:05:55.250> defense<00:05:55.700> that<00:05:55.880> you<00:05:55.940> can<00:05:56.120> get<00:05:56.240> at<00:05:56.330> this

00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:56.479 
base defense that you can get at this

00:05:56.479 --> 00:06:00.040
