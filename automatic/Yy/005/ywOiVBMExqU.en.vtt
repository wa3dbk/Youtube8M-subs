 the difficulty with that is that currencies are not reliable 

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:31.080
 Represent units of measure 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.509
 their value goes up and down

 to a wrong picture 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:46.850
 things look very different when you move to the reference point and the 

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:48.449
 Value of the gun are currency 

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:50.270
 Ingold expresses 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:52.250
 with this method is to be determined 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:56.290
 that the scale of the devaluation against the precious metal impressive 

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:57.029
 is

 even a strong currency like the euro 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:01.740
 lost since its introduction 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.569
 50 percent in value 

00:06:03.569 --> 00:06:06.460
 opposite the gold 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:10.240
 he does not seem to make sense this morning and then the backup 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.050
 to think of prosperity 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:15.039
 the amount of the pension is still considered uncertain 

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:17.979
 there you should already do preliminary work 

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:22.310
 Every gold plant started today and with regular and even smallest 

00:06:22.309 --> 00:06:23.889
 stepped forward 

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:26.580
 will pay off in the future 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:30.460

00:06:37.099 --> 00:06:40.099
 Gold is and remains a liquid gently 

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:43.059
 is the safest currency 

00:06:43.059 --> 00:06:45.169
 Gold gets the purchasing power 

00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:48.530
 Gold serves as excellent insurance protection in one 

00:06:48.529 --> 00:06:51.279
 diversified portfolio 

00:06:51.279 --> 00:06:55.990
 The gold price is thus eating up against all currencies appreciating 

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:59.669
 and there will be a doubling of the price of gold against the euro in the 

00:06:59.669 --> 00:07:01.560
 expected next ten years
