00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:05.549
 hello today we are learning to do 

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:09.190
 this felt flower ok 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:11.799
 the felt is an age wonder for 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:14.259
 do all kinds of ways ugt is good 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:16.360
 I decided to teach you for the 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:18.130
 small girls you want to do 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.830
 two pigtails and then they look more 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:23.170
 passion for adding a little glamor to 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:26.230
 the little hats that you already have you can catch 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:29.410
 two small pieces of felt 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:32.590
 pearls or nonsense of these brilliant 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:34.860
 that you have at home buttons 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.740
 buttons you can use 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.380
 and a pair of scissors and the glue gun 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:42.330
 what is that silicone is 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:45.510
 transforms into glue and dries 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:48.600
 I immediately put that though first we go 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.580
 to take a square of felt that 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.290
 we usually have to be a color 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.150
 Well, girls like it a lot 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.940
 now with the blas monster high then to 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:01:01.350
 everyone loves purple 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:04.770
 and we cut a circle that if it does not come out 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.619
 like me doing it without any pattern 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:10.440
 draw with a pen a pattern on the 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.600
 porta what is felt is already worth it and 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.000
 Now what I'm doing is cutting 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.940
 as a centimeter as a band 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.560
 one centimeter 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:22.610
 from that circle then we take a piece 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.640
 of green felt 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.940
 normally green because that's the way it looks 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.060
 natural 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:32.220
 double it in 4 again that if it does not come out 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.170
 the first one and you're going a lot 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.170
 the center is also missing 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.520
 for three or four euros or you take a 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.330
 whole meter because it does not go to the 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.580
 first 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.040
 simply with a bowl and draw some 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.240
 leaves and the vais cutting in addition is 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.700
 very easy to trim this 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.520
 and here we have the leaves of the flower 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.799
 with what we have left over if it is not 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.240
 as in this case a whole band with 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:00.759
 what we have left in the leaves 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.799
 we just cut a little square that 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:06.520
 It is to cover the end everything is 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:10.509
 ugly glue that's left over ok 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:12.670
 now we take the purple felt this and 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.310
 simply rolling it up is going to 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.959
 keep going and going 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.460
 and in the end and we will have to get 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:22.730
 a pretty flower 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:25.640
 my advice as always is to try it ok 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:28.100
 they do not cost you to try to see if in fact 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.470
 if you have other ideas on how to do this 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:33.530
 type of flower, I would love it if 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.750
 I taught six about documenta 6 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.510
 because although it does not seem so in little 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.989
 a battle too 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.549
 Well, here we have the flower already 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:44.909
 It's almost done ok 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:48.610
 we make sure to be well alright 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:51.040
 tight because that way we do not leave 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:54.760
 we found that throwing a bit of 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:57.430
 one part is already removing everything ok by 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:02.200
 the side that we are going to cover has to be 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:05.319
 see all all all all 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:09.069
 royo is these ok I'm applying a 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:10.900
 generous amount of glue for 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:13.930
 make sure that the glue is going to 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.730
 get in contact with all the flower and 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.819
 with the leaves that I had then simply 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:22.209
 I'm covering the glue, we know that 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:25.030
 although this is very easy and very fast the 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:27.250
 glue is hot what usually 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.590
 to pass is that it is very ugly then 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:32.260
 what happens to you that you have minutes like this 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.030
 of glues do not try to clean it and 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:37.150
 continue to leave it until it dries 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:41.170
 little because I assure you that it's going to 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:42.880
 go out much nicer if you let the 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.890
 glue to dry and then with a 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.299
 scissors you cut it or just ground 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.540
 this the little tricks that if you try 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:52.239
 clean it when it's hot to 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:54.519
 add some sparkle to the flower and 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:56.530
 that my children really like the 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:04:01.220
 losses and the bright things I'm going to 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:03.410
 add a pearl in the center of the flower 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.600
 you have now you can do what 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:10.780
 you want with her in this case I'm going to 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.780
 make a hair ribbon a ribbon 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.530
 good 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:25.310
 for the end after having put the 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:27.910
 link 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.910
 the 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:34.120
 hair clip or a brush what I do 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.460
 is to cover the glue says that 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:39.490
 over time it's going to get white in 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.860
 When it dries, the glue stops being 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.600
 it stops being transparent it becomes 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.240
 white then what I want is that not 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:49.400
 it looks nice that they can 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:51.710
 enjoy without having to ask 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:55.120
 nothing here you have azor I hope that you 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:55.120
 I liked it and I hope
