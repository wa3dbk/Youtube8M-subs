00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.250 

actually<00:02:12.709> it's<00:02:13.220> probably<00:02:14.000> about<00:02:14.120> the<00:02:14.360> same<00:02:14.840> as

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
actually it's probably about the same as

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.480 
actually it's probably about the same as
the<00:02:16.250> iPhone<00:02:16.370> 4s<00:02:16.940> maybe<00:02:17.720> a<00:02:17.810> little<00:02:18.080> lighter<00:02:18.490> I'm

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
assuming that's the power button it's
