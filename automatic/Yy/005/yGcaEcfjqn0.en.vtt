00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.630 
he's got off but I'm not really into it
I'm<00:01:45.149> just<00:01:45.270> trying<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.570> do<00:01:45.659> so<00:01:45.840> low<00:01:45.899> right<00:01:45.990> now

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
I'm just trying to do so low right now

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.130 
I'm just trying to do so low right now
but<00:01:47.640> yeah<00:01:47.759> I<00:01:47.790> was<00:01:47.909> a<00:01:47.939> pretty<00:01:48.149> good<00:01:48.240> game<00:01:48.509> now

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
but yeah I was a pretty good game now

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.350 
but yeah I was a pretty good game now
one<00:01:49.590> strategy<00:01:49.979> that<00:01:50.070> we<00:01:50.369> incorporated<00:01:51.090> that<00:01:51.299> I

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
one strategy that we incorporated that I

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.270 
one strategy that we incorporated that I
really<00:01:51.990> liked<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:52.530> I<00:01:52.649> hadn't<00:01:52.950> really<00:01:53.100> seen

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
really liked and I hadn't really seen

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.100 
really liked and I hadn't really seen
people<00:01:53.579> do<00:01:53.670> before<00:01:53.850> all<00:01:54.420> I'm<00:01:54.750> sure<00:01:54.930> people

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
people do before all I'm sure people

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.679 
people do before all I'm sure people
have<00:01:55.470> is<00:01:55.829> if<00:01:56.219> I<00:01:56.549> we're<00:01:56.790> running<00:01:57.149> regular<00:01:57.509> ray

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
have is if I we're running regular ray

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.590 
have is if I we're running regular ray
guns<00:01:57.960> so<00:01:58.469> if<00:01:58.770> i<00:01:58.920> had<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.219> ray<00:01:59.490> gun<00:01:59.729> he<00:02:00.329> would<00:02:00.479> be

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
guns so if i had the ray gun he would be

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.260 
guns so if i had the ray gun he would be
hitting<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:00.899> box<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:01.530> then<00:02:02.100> once<00:02:02.850> he<00:02:03.030> got<00:02:03.149> the

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
hitting the box and then once he got the

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.420 
hitting the box and then once he got the
Regan<00:02:03.420> I'm<00:02:03.659> idle<00:02:04.110> expended<00:02:04.649> all<00:02:04.740> my<00:02:04.890> ammo<00:02:05.250> I

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
Regan I'm idle expended all my ammo I

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.059 
Regan I'm idle expended all my ammo I
would<00:02:06.060> trade<00:02:06.540> spots<00:02:06.840> with<00:02:07.049> him<00:02:07.290> he<00:02:07.799> would<00:02:07.950> run

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
would trade spots with him he would run

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.740 
would trade spots with him he would run
the<00:02:08.190> ray<00:02:08.340> gun<00:02:08.550> and<00:02:08.580> I<00:02:08.849> would<00:02:09.030> hit<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.239> box<00:02:09.450> and

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
the ray gun and I would hit the box and

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.309 
the ray gun and I would hit the box and
we<00:02:10.470> basically<00:02:10.709> had<00:02:11.250> it<00:02:11.400> so<00:02:11.550> we<00:02:11.640> had<00:02:11.760> permanent

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
we basically had it so we had permanent

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.949 
we basically had it so we had permanent
is<00:02:12.680> pretty<00:02:12.890> dope<00:02:13.069> and<00:02:13.969> then<00:02:14.269> of<00:02:14.420> course<00:02:14.510> if<00:02:14.870> we
