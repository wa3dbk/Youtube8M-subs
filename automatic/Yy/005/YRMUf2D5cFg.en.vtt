00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 Hi everyone , everything good today I leave one 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.420
 Cool tip for you guys. 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.040
 happens that as of May 30 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.050
 2015 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.059
 the new disk is being deployed on 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.980
 other states here from Brazil between them 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.820
 is the state of pernambuco alagoas 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.949
 northern rio grande and cearÃ¡ are 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.260
 paulo rio e amazonas already uses a new 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.670
 digit then pay attention if you live 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.650
 In these states that I spoke 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.359
 from that day you will enter a 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.039
 update process you will 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.470
 need to update all your 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.570
 contacts and put digit 9 in front 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.460
 and this happened because of the shortage 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.410
 number is no longer available 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.210
 in these states everybody today 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.420

 contact by placing the name of the ciro 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.649
 front that would be unbearable 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.520
 there are people who have 100 200 300 or more 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.590

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.239

 I updated my contacts in thing 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.909
 minutes and they were all updated 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.380
 to get the world to leave in a super 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.430
 practical and simple 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.430

 settings I've shown a video 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.630

 number 41 quiet operator has in its 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.740
 contacts if you do not use the operator and
