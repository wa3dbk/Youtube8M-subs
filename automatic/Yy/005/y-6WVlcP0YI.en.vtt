the<00:01:05.759> concept<00:01:06.360> of<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.750> non<00:01:07.159> drivers<00:01:08.159> Ferrari

the concept of a non drivers Ferrari

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.510 
the concept of a non drivers Ferrari
it's<00:01:09.180> slightly<00:01:09.840> confused<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:10.770> it's<00:01:11.130> probably

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
it's slightly confused and it's probably

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.920 
it's slightly confused and it's probably
insulting<00:01:12.000> to<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.180> team<00:01:12.390> that<00:01:12.630> developed

insulting to the team that developed
these<00:01:13.320> cars<00:01:13.560> because<00:01:13.920> it<00:01:14.670> still<00:01:15.030> is<00:01:15.060> but<00:01:15.180> any
