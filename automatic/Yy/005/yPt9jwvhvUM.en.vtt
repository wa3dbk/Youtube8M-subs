00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:57.309 
to fill valves before and to adjust that

00:00:57.309 --> 00:00:59.189

there's no adjustment screw on here

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:05.160 
there's no adjustment screw on here
anywhere<00:00:59.760> so<00:01:00.809> what<00:01:01.809> you<00:01:01.989> have<00:01:02.140> to<00:01:02.170> do<00:01:03.869> is<00:01:04.869> you

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
anywhere so what you have to do is you

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.140 
anywhere so what you have to do is you
have<00:01:05.350> to<00:01:05.560> wiggle<00:01:05.860> it<00:01:06.159> I'm<00:01:06.460> going<00:01:06.729> to<00:01:06.790> flush

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.150 
have to wiggle it I'm going to flush

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.719 
have to wiggle it I'm going to flush
this<00:01:07.470> here<00:01:08.470> for<00:01:08.799> a<00:01:08.830> second<00:01:09.220> you'll<00:01:09.340> see<00:01:09.430> this

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729 
this here for a second you'll see this

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:12.780 
this here for a second you'll see this
handle<00:01:10.180> going<00:01:10.360> up<00:01:10.540> too<00:01:10.750> high<00:01:11.430> he's<00:01:12.430> how<00:01:12.550> high

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:12.790 
handle going up too high he's how high

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.960 
handle going up too high he's how high
it<00:01:12.940> goes<00:01:13.180> well<00:01:13.900> that<00:01:14.050> would<00:01:14.200> hit<00:01:14.380> the<00:01:14.590> lid<00:01:14.940> so<00:01:15.940> I

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
it goes well that would hit the lid so I

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.600 
it goes well that would hit the lid so I
think<00:01:16.480> it<00:01:16.600> would<00:01:16.720> still<00:01:16.990> go<00:01:17.260> maybe<00:01:18.250> but

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 
think it would still go maybe but

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.670 
think it would still go maybe but
there's<00:01:18.820> up<00:01:19.000> but<00:01:19.690> there's<00:01:19.900> a<00:01:19.990> screw<00:01:20.410> on<00:01:20.440> the

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:20.680 
there's up but there's a screw on the

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:21.980 
there's up but there's a screw on the
backside<00:01:21.130> here<00:01:21.160> I<00:01:21.460> might<00:01:21.670> be

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
backside here I might be

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.469 
backside here I might be
undo<00:01:22.320> that<00:01:22.350> screw<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:23.340> how<00:01:23.460> this<00:01:23.670> arm<00:01:23.970> here

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
undo that screw and how this arm here

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.249 
undo that screw and how this arm here
facing<00:01:25.170> down<00:01:25.649> a<00:01:25.680> little<00:01:26.100> bit<00:01:26.280> further<00:01:26.720> and<00:01:27.720> so

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
facing down a little bit further and so

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.300 
facing down a little bit further and so
this<00:01:28.500> here<00:01:28.950> it's<00:01:29.490> on<00:01:29.790> a<00:01:29.820> little<00:01:30.270> hook<00:01:31.310> it's

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310

willy<00:02:22.739> nilly<00:02:22.860> okay

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.490 

now<00:02:26.460> I<00:02:26.790> played<00:02:27.360> around<00:02:27.630> with<00:02:27.780> it<00:02:27.930> but<00:02:28.170> see<00:02:28.350> how

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
now I played around with it but see how

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.590 
now I played around with it but see how
this<00:02:28.680> is<00:02:28.860> lower<00:02:29.160> than<00:02:29.520> the<00:02:29.610> top<00:02:29.850> there<00:02:30.150> that's

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
this is lower than the top there that's

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.020 
this is lower than the top there that's
how<00:02:30.810> you<00:02:30.870> adjust<00:02:31.080> this<00:02:31.650> height<00:02:31.980> you<00:02:32.280> want<00:02:32.819> this

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
how you adjust this height you want this

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.680 
how you adjust this height you want this
one<00:02:33.750> to<00:02:33.870> water<00:02:34.170> at<00:02:34.470> least<00:02:34.740> an<00:02:35.190> inch<00:02:35.790> below<00:02:36.510> the

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
one to water at least an inch below the

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:42.830 
one to water at least an inch below the
top<00:02:36.900> of<00:02:37.170> this<00:02:37.790> drainpipe<00:02:39.920> and<00:02:40.920> I<00:02:41.730> think<00:02:42.690> it's

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
top of this drainpipe and I think it's

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.040 
top of this drainpipe and I think it's
going<00:02:43.050> to<00:02:43.080> be<00:02:43.230> pretty<00:02:43.530> close<00:02:43.709> about<00:02:44.130> half

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
going to be pretty close about half

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:53.479 
going to be pretty close about half
we'll<00:02:46.050> just<00:02:46.230> have<00:02:46.380> to<00:02:46.560> see<00:02:46.770> what<00:02:47.130> happens

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:58.550 

like<00:02:54.150> they're<00:02:55.069> proud<00:02:56.069> about<00:02:57.079> you<00:02:58.079> know<00:02:58.200> that

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
like they're proud about you know that

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.530 
like they're proud about you know that
might<00:02:58.799> need<00:02:59.010> to<00:02:59.069> be<00:02:59.219> replaced<00:02:59.640> sometime<00:03:00.239> soon

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
might need to be replaced sometime soon

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
because the flapper Bob's not pushing

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.380 

be<00:03:17.870> nicer<00:03:18.350> everything<00:03:18.860> was<00:03:19.070> brand<00:03:19.640> new<00:03:19.970> looks
