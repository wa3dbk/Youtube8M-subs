00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
the spark plugs and you pull out the

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.050 
the spark plugs and you pull out the
boot<00:00:18.930> and<00:00:19.110> it's<00:00:19.260> covered<00:00:19.590> with<00:00:19.740> oil<00:00:20.060> don't

freak out and think that your engine's
falling<00:00:23.040> apart<00:00:24.740> because<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:26.040> fix<00:00:26.310> can<00:00:26.520> be<00:00:26.640> as

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:26.759 
falling apart because the fix can be as

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:28.640 
falling apart because the fix can be as
simple<00:00:26.910> as<00:00:27.150> changing<00:00:27.450> these<00:00:27.779> spark<00:00:28.140> plug<00:00:28.380> tube

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
simple as changing these spark plug tube

the<00:00:31.739> gasket<00:00:32.189> material<00:00:32.610> is<00:00:32.669> made<00:00:32.759> out<00:00:32.940> of

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:32.970 
the gasket material is made out of

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.910 
the gasket material is made out of
rubber<00:00:33.210> it<00:00:33.630> cracks<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:34.200> it<00:00:34.290> starts<00:00:34.590> to<00:00:34.710> leak

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
rubber it cracks and it starts to leak

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.280 
rubber it cracks and it starts to leak
oil<00:00:35.130> into<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.610> engine<00:00:36.000> so<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.660> engine<00:00:36.989> itself

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
oil into the engine so the engine itself

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.410 
oil into the engine so the engine itself
is<00:00:37.500> probably<00:00:37.739> okay<00:00:38.340> it's<00:00:38.910> just<00:00:39.000> that<00:00:39.270> the

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
is probably okay it's just that the

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.299 
is probably okay it's just that the
gaskets<00:00:39.899> are<00:00:40.020> leaking<00:00:40.350> then<00:00:40.800> they<00:00:40.950> coat<00:00:41.130> the

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
gaskets are leaking then they coat the

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.040 
gaskets are leaking then they coat the
spark<00:00:41.610> plug<00:00:41.820> boots<00:00:42.059> in<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.329> spark<00:00:42.630> plugs<00:00:42.870> with

spark plug boots in the spark plugs with

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.560 
spark plug boots in the spark plugs with
oil<00:00:43.380> now<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.250> fix<00:00:44.550> it<00:00:44.760> first<00:00:45.000> take<00:00:45.210> all<00:00:45.390> the

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
oil now to fix it first take all the

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.479 
oil now to fix it first take all the
hoses<00:00:46.050> off<00:00:46.230> that<00:00:46.469> are<00:00:46.589> connected<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.309> top

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
hoses off that are connected to the top

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.729 
hoses off that are connected to the top
of<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.730> valve<00:00:47.940> cover<00:00:48.089> then<00:00:48.929> they<00:00:49.079> often<00:00:49.289> stick

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
of the valve cover then they often stick

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.430 
of the valve cover then they often stick
on<00:00:49.920> so<00:00:50.219> get<00:00:50.370> a<00:00:50.399> big<00:00:50.640> screwdriver<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.989> start<00:00:52.140> to

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
on so get a big screwdriver and start to

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.279 
on so get a big screwdriver and start to
pry<00:00:52.739> them<00:00:52.920> off<00:00:53.420> then<00:00:54.420> they<00:00:54.510> come<00:00:54.690> off<00:00:54.839> easier

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
pry them off then they come off easier

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.470 
pry them off then they come off easier
they<00:00:55.800> get<00:00:55.949> a<00:00:55.980> ten<00:00:56.219> millimeter<00:00:56.429> socket<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:57.329> a

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
they get a ten millimeter socket and a

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.270 
they get a ten millimeter socket and a
ratchet<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:58.199> take<00:00:58.469> all<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.739> little<00:00:58.980> bolts

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
ratchet and take all the little bolts

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.069 
ratchet and take all the little bolts
off<00:00:59.429> that<00:00:59.670> hold<00:00:59.850> the<00:00:59.969> valve<00:01:00.179> cover<00:01:00.480> gasket<00:01:00.960> on

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
off that hold the valve cover gasket on

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.840 
off that hold the valve cover gasket on
the<00:01:01.109> top<00:01:01.320> of<00:01:01.499> the<00:01:01.589> engine<00:01:01.710> it's<00:01:02.339> a<00:01:02.429> pretty<00:01:02.609> easy

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
the top of the engine it's a pretty easy

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.270 
the top of the engine it's a pretty easy
job<00:01:02.999> when<00:01:03.449> it<00:01:03.570> comes<00:01:03.719> down<00:01:03.929> to<00:01:03.989> it<00:01:04.290> and<00:01:04.980> once

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
job when it comes down to it and once

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.040 
job when it comes down to it and once
you<00:01:05.370> take<00:01:05.400> all<00:01:05.730> the<00:01:05.880> little<00:01:06.090> bolts<00:01:06.390> off<00:01:06.570> get

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:07.050 
you take all the little bolts off get

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.350 
you take all the little bolts off get
the<00:01:07.170> giant<00:01:07.470> screwdriver<00:01:07.980> again<00:01:08.370> and<00:01:09.030> realize

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
the giant screwdriver again and realize

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.480 
the giant screwdriver again and realize
that<00:01:09.390> develop<00:01:09.930> cars<00:01:10.140> are<00:01:10.409> pretty<00:01:10.530> stuck<00:01:10.920> on<00:01:11.130> so

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
that develop cars are pretty stuck on so

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.460 
that develop cars are pretty stuck on so
you<00:01:11.909> find<00:01:12.150> a<00:01:12.270> little<00:01:12.450> Ridge<00:01:12.750> like<00:01:13.020> this<00:01:13.260> and

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
you find a little Ridge like this and

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.860 
you find a little Ridge like this and
pry<00:01:13.710> then<00:01:14.700> you<00:01:14.820> can<00:01:15.000> pry<00:01:15.210> it<00:01:15.240> off

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:15.870 
pry then you can pry it off

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:17.990 
pry then you can pry it off
with<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.770> bit<00:01:16.979> of<00:01:17.010> wiggle<00:01:17.400> and<00:01:17.550> you<00:01:17.610> can<00:01:17.729> get<00:01:17.880> it

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
with a bit of wiggle and you can get it

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.660 
with a bit of wiggle and you can get it
off<00:01:18.830> nowhere<00:01:19.830> else<00:01:19.860> is<00:01:20.100> gonna<00:01:20.250> change<00:01:20.460> the

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
off nowhere else is gonna change the

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.100 
off nowhere else is gonna change the
valve<00:01:20.880> cover<00:01:21.150> gaskets<00:01:21.720> because<00:01:21.900> you<00:01:21.960> could

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
valve cover gaskets because you could

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.590 
valve cover gaskets because you could
see<00:01:22.290> it's<00:01:22.440> all<00:01:22.620> cracked<00:01:22.980> and<00:01:23.130> worn<00:01:23.450> but<00:01:24.450> the

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
see it's all cracked and worn but the

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.240 
see it's all cracked and worn but the
spark<00:01:24.840> plug<00:01:25.050> tube<00:01:25.290> seals<00:01:25.560> are<00:01:25.770> even<00:01:26.010> worse

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
spark plug tube seals are even worse

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.520 
spark plug tube seals are even worse
they're<00:01:27.030> totally<00:01:27.480> brittle<00:01:27.900> they<00:01:28.020> come<00:01:28.200> off<00:01:28.380> in

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
they're totally brittle they come off in

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.430 
they're totally brittle they come off in
pieces<00:01:29.120> and<00:01:30.120> these<00:01:30.300> are<00:01:30.540> so<00:01:30.660> caked<00:01:30.930> on<00:01:31.140> we<00:01:31.350> have

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
pieces and these are so caked on we have

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.590 
pieces and these are so caked on we have
to<00:01:31.560> use<00:01:31.710> this<00:01:31.830> little<00:01:32.010> putty<00:01:32.400> knife<00:01:32.670> in<00:01:33.300> order

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
to use this little putty knife in order

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.500 
to use this little putty knife in order
to<00:01:33.720> scrape<00:01:33.990> them<00:01:34.170> off<00:01:34.910> and<00:01:35.910> I'm<00:01:36.060> also<00:01:36.240> gonna

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:36.510 
to scrape them off and I'm also gonna

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:37.910 
to scrape them off and I'm also gonna
bow<00:01:36.720> them<00:01:36.960> off<00:01:37.080> with<00:01:37.290> a<00:01:37.320> buffer<00:01:37.710> because

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
bow them off with a buffer because

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.930 
bow them off with a buffer because
there's<00:01:38.070> a<00:01:38.130> lot<00:01:38.280> of<00:01:38.310> pieces<00:01:38.640> stuck<00:01:39.060> on<00:01:39.300> there

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
there's a lot of pieces stuck on there

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.890 
there's a lot of pieces stuck on there
you<00:01:41.940> want<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.180> make<00:01:42.300> sure<00:01:42.330> they're<00:01:42.690> nice<00:01:42.840> and

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:42.900 
you want to make sure they're nice and

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.560 
you want to make sure they're nice and
shiny<00:01:43.320> like<00:01:43.590> this<00:01:43.980> so<00:01:44.160> they<00:01:44.310> seal<00:01:44.580> good<00:01:44.910> now

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
shiny like this so they seal good now

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.240 
shiny like this so they seal good now
there's<00:01:45.690> a<00:01:45.840> bunch<00:01:46.020> of<00:01:46.140> oil<00:01:46.380> stuck<00:01:46.710> in<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:46.950> spark

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
there's a bunch of oil stuck in a spark

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.010 
there's a bunch of oil stuck in a spark
plug<00:01:47.310> hole<00:01:47.640> so<00:01:47.940> I'm<00:01:48.330> gonna<00:01:48.510> use<00:01:48.720> this<00:01:48.870> little

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
plug hole so I'm gonna use this little

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.200 
plug hole so I'm gonna use this little
vacuum<00:01:49.590> pump<00:01:49.830> and<00:01:50.040> it's<00:01:50.340> gonna<00:01:50.490> suck<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:51.060> oil

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
vacuum pump and it's gonna suck the oil

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.750 
vacuum pump and it's gonna suck the oil
out<00:01:51.540> so<00:01:52.080> it<00:01:52.200> gets<00:01:52.410> out<00:01:52.560> of<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.740> engine<00:01:53.100> then

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:53.760 
out so it gets out of the engine then

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.280 
out so it gets out of the engine then
you<00:01:53.910> just<00:01:54.120> stick<00:01:54.330> your<00:01:54.480> pump<00:01:54.690> and<00:01:54.810> device<00:01:55.080> in

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
you just stick your pump and device in

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.200 
you just stick your pump and device in
the<00:01:55.350> hole<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:55.740> pump<00:01:55.950> it<00:01:56.160> so<00:01:56.640> you<00:01:56.790> can<00:01:56.910> see<00:01:57.090> it

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
the hole and pump it so you can see it

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.700 
the hole and pump it so you can see it
sucks<00:01:57.480> the<00:01:57.660> oil<00:01:57.930> out<00:02:00.110> now<00:02:01.110> I'm<00:02:01.260> changing<00:02:01.440> the

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
sucks the oil out now I'm changing the

sucks the oil out now I'm changing the
spark<00:02:01.890> plugs<00:02:02.190> too<00:02:02.400> but<00:02:02.610> we<00:02:02.700> didn't<00:02:02.940> want<00:02:03.030> to

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:03.120 
spark plugs too but we didn't want to

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.790 
spark plugs too but we didn't want to
take<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.300> spark<00:02:03.660> plugs<00:02:03.870> out<00:02:03.990> first<00:02:04.350> because

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:04.800 
take the spark plugs out first because

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.890 
take the spark plugs out first because
if<00:02:05.010> we<00:02:05.130> did<00:02:05.340> all<00:02:05.730> that<00:02:05.940> oil<00:02:06.210> will<00:02:06.390> get<00:02:06.510> stuck<00:02:06.720> in

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
if we did all that oil will get stuck in

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.479 
if we did all that oil will get stuck in
the<00:02:06.990> engine<00:02:07.140> and<00:02:07.440> we<00:02:07.590> tried<00:02:07.830> to<00:02:07.860> crank<00:02:08.190> it
