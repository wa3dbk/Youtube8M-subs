few world first the trend for employer

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.509 
few world first the trend for employer
is<00:02:10.530> to<00:02:10.830> use<00:02:11.510> many<00:02:12.510> new<00:02:13.290> tech<00:02:13.590> technological

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.519 
is to use many new tech technological

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:16.610 
is to use many new tech technological
material<00:02:15.060> which<00:02:15.299> is<00:02:15.330> the<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:15.989> carbon<00:02:16.350> fiber

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
material which is the the carbon fiber

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.410 
material which is the the carbon fiber
in<00:02:16.860> fact<00:02:17.130> so<00:02:17.910> as<00:02:18.650> we<00:02:19.650> have<00:02:19.799> just<00:02:19.830> invested<00:02:20.700> in<00:02:21.299> a

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
in fact so as we have just invested in a

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.259 
in fact so as we have just invested in a
new<00:02:21.600> company<00:02:22.170> a<00:02:22.470> small<00:02:23.100> company<00:02:23.549> of<00:02:23.760> 20<00:02:24.120> people

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
new company a small company of 20 people

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:27.050 
new company a small company of 20 people
that<00:02:24.660> would<00:02:24.870> just<00:02:25.080> have<00:02:25.260> a<00:02:25.290> boat<00:02:25.830> in<00:02:26.519> order<00:02:26.850> to

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
that would just have a boat in order to

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.050 
that would just have a boat in order to
produce<00:02:27.239> our<00:02:27.720> own<00:02:28.080> cases<00:02:28.850> with<00:02:29.850> this

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
produce our own cases with this

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.449 
produce our own cases with this
fantastic<00:02:30.480> material<00:02:31.080> which<00:02:31.590> is<00:02:31.620> the<00:02:31.980> carbon

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
fantastic material which is the carbon

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.240 
fantastic material which is the carbon
fiber<00:02:32.700> so<00:02:33.420> this<00:02:33.600> year<00:02:33.780> we<00:02:33.930> come<00:02:34.109> up<00:02:34.320> with<00:02:34.470> a<00:02:34.500> few

fiber so this year we come up with a few

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.650 
fiber so this year we come up with a few
models<00:02:36.019> the<00:02:37.019> first<00:02:37.290> one<00:02:37.560> is<00:02:37.769> a<00:02:38.209> big<00:02:39.209> bang<00:02:39.450> model
