doing<00:01:23.090> conservation<00:01:24.090> organizations<00:01:24.960> have<00:01:25.350> a

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
doing conservation organizations have a

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.440 
doing conservation organizations have a
history<00:01:25.890> of<00:01:25.920> not<00:01:26.280> wanting<00:01:26.729> to<00:01:26.790> work<00:01:27.119> with<00:01:27.150> the

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
history of not wanting to work with the

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.230 
history of not wanting to work with the
ranching<00:01:27.750> community<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.590> I<00:01:29.430> really<00:01:29.729> seen<00:01:30.119> as

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
ranching community and I really seen as

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.270 
ranching community and I really seen as
adversaries<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:31.140> so<00:01:31.320> this<00:01:31.619> is<00:01:31.770> kind<00:01:31.950> of<00:01:31.979> a<00:01:32.100> new

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
adversaries and so this is kind of a new

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.910 
adversaries and so this is kind of a new
concept<00:01:33.060> for<00:01:33.299> them<00:01:33.390> eight<00:01:34.140> or<00:01:34.350> nine<00:01:34.530> years<00:01:34.829> ago

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.760 
concept for them eight or nine years ago
I<00:01:35.159> did<00:01:35.610> not<00:01:35.640> want<00:01:36.210> anything<00:01:36.570> to<00:01:36.810> do<00:01:37.170> with<00:01:37.200> it

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
I did not want anything to do with it

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.020 
I did not want anything to do with it

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
but what I found is that we both share

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.109 
but what I found is that we both share
the<00:01:42.360> same<00:01:42.390> goals<00:01:43.229> we<00:01:43.979> love<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.369> land<00:01:44.610> we<00:01:44.909> love

order to keep the grass right side up

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.870 
order to keep the grass right side up
the<00:02:04.110> biggest<00:02:04.470> threat<00:02:04.740> to<00:02:04.770> our<00:02:04.920> grasslands<00:02:05.730> is
