00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 
honestly once the the opening scenes

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:58.790 
honestly once the the opening scenes
were<00:04:57.300> done<00:04:57.480> I<00:04:57.510> kind<00:04:57.870> of<00:04:57.900> forgot<00:04:58.140> about<00:04:58.200> the<00:04:58.500> 3d

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
were done I kind of forgot about the 3d

were done I kind of forgot about the 3d
I<00:04:58.980> find<00:04:59.250> that<00:04:59.400> free<00:04:59.640> 3d<00:05:00.240> distorts<00:05:00.870> the<00:05:01.020> color

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:01.230 
I find that free 3d distorts the color

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:07.130 
I find that free 3d distorts the color
and<00:05:02.630> it<00:05:04.550> it's<00:05:05.550> almost<00:05:06.000> too<00:05:06.360> much<00:05:06.510> in<00:05:06.780> your<00:05:06.930> lab

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:07.140 
and it it's almost too much in your lab

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:12.140 
and it it's almost too much in your lab
I'm<00:05:07.500> sure<00:05:08.810> because<00:05:10.100> Scorsese<00:05:11.100> always<00:05:11.640> takes<00:05:11.940> a

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
I'm sure because Scorsese always takes a

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:17.060 
I'm sure because Scorsese always takes a
visual<00:05:12.650> seriously<00:05:13.820> that<00:05:14.840> this<00:05:15.840> is<00:05:16.080> not<00:05:16.530> you

think you'll enjoy it I'm able to be a

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:52.719 
think you'll enjoy it I'm able to be a
child<00:05:51.360> and<00:05:51.660> I've<00:05:51.750> grown<00:05:51.930> up<00:05:52.169> at<00:05:52.320> the<00:05:52.440> same<00:05:52.680> time

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:52.729 
child and I've grown up at the same time

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:55.190 
child and I've grown up at the same time
and<00:05:53.729> I<00:05:53.790> think<00:05:54.030> if<00:05:54.150> you<00:05:54.270> can't<00:05:54.510> do<00:05:54.780> that<00:05:55.020> you

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:55.200 
and I think if you can't do that you

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:57.740 
and I think if you can't do that you
might<00:05:55.350> as<00:05:55.500> well<00:05:55.530> not<00:05:56.000> go<00:05:57.000> what<00:05:57.419> do<00:05:57.479> you<00:05:57.540> give<00:05:57.660> it

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:57.750
