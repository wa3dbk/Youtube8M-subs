00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 you are already accustomed to march but 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.310
 at the end of the entire program 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.359
 but today I invite you with a good track 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.359
 different though 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.400
 friends of the car, we 'll talk one more time 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.310
 of the track only today the joke 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:27.210
 different today in the asphalt today is not 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.210
 offload 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:37.250
 have you heard of utv since this is 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.530
 model here is also known as side 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.900
 by side because it can house more 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.790
 people inside and is a compact vehicle 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.739
 which can fulfill conditions for the 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:49.000
 work and can also be very 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:49.000
 fun at the time of leisure 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.769
 The model we are going to test today is a 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.050
 sports version of xp 900 hour time 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:00.360
 brand that is very famous in the 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:04.110
 U.S 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:06.060
 here in Brazil the 900 h system is 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.530
 conquering ground already competes in 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.570
 rally categories 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.910
 well I'm here with you, the manager of 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.640
 product of polaris but is the current champion 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:16.950
 TV Brazilian is already an experienced pilot 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.450
 came here from Portugal and fell in love 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.840
 for our country decided to stay here 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.310
 will not give me a few touches that I can 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.010
 do if you know that my experience of 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.620
 track then I use the same concepts 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:31.530
 or have to change everything to love change everything 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.509
 actually we were on lane then walking the 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.470
 cleaner with trajectories 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.530
 defined 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:41.250
 here you have to walk the whole post 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.890
 slipping leaving the car well loosened 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.390
 and back spreading enough to happen 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.550
 much more aggressive 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.920
 you can make the most of 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:52.350
 advantage of the dynamics of the car and 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.910
 make the turns neither in terms of speed 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.920
 better once put the car exchange 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:58.200
 cvt is an automatic gearbox 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.970
 you can not arrest and walk on the 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.580
 input curve you will have to 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.350
 learn to drive and suffer at the entrance 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.720
 well-aggressive posture of 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.920
 curve to cause the rear output 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.600
 leave the subject 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.049
 then put your foot on the accelerator and 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.820
 skirting the curve if you learned 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:17.269
 Me more or less 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.269
 come on 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:46.290
 with a 900-cylinder engine it has 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.720
 95 horsepower and can reach the 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.239
 maximum speed of 96 kilometers per 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.980
 are not so expressive numbers but 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.930
 we have to look at it as a kart in the 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.390
 earth that conveys a sense of 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.640
 very intense speed without forgetting 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.900
 clear that off-road driving requires 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.900
 other counties 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.870
 very cool a lot of adrenaline 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.640
 something quite different from the speed 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.989
 on the asphalt, for example I'm very 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.939
 accustomed to the asphalt tracks 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:20.890
 how much longer are you with the four 

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:23.920
 glued wheels foot floor spiked 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.870
 Are you walking faster here? 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.090
 very contrary you have to be with the 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.780
 and all loose back to the inputs of 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.609
 curve 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.549
 You have to provoke the exit of 

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:35.379
 back there you give the accelerator and then 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:35.980
 this play you can control the 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:38.139
 car 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:41.370
 is a lot of very tasty adrenaline that 

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:41.370
 very cool thanks 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.820
 The automales today unfortunately go 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:59.620
 coming to an end but you can check 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:02.650
 all our programming accessing the 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:05.350
 site auto + tv.com point br send your 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.490
 suggestion your comment do not forget 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.860
 we have a meeting scheduled for the next 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:10.870
 Saturday at one o'clock here on the band 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:14.670
 I hope you have a super Sunday one. 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.670
 great week for champions 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.720
 it was also clear how this new 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.820
 the fusca evolved to face the 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.180
 competitors of this segment here in the 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.180
 Brazil
