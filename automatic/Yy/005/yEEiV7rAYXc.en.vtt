now okay so now the head is changing the
best<00:00:44.290> yeah<00:00:46.020> what<00:00:47.020> speed<00:00:47.410> up<00:00:47.650> it<00:00:47.890> and<00:00:48.070> where<00:00:48.280> it

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:48.310 
best yeah what speed up it and where it

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:52.680 
best yeah what speed up it and where it
went<00:00:48.610> exactly<00:00:49.300> where<00:00:49.810> it's<00:00:49.989> going<00:00:51.690> accuracy

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690 
went exactly where it's going accuracy

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.420 
went exactly where it's going accuracy
of<00:00:53.080> this<00:00:54.000> believable<00:00:55.000> I<00:00:55.480> have<00:00:56.070> it's<00:00:57.070> a<00:00:57.160> pretty

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:57.430 
of this believable I have it's a pretty

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:06.150 
of this believable I have it's a pretty
serious<00:00:57.730> machine<00:00:58.300> and<00:00:58.510> be<00:00:58.660> going

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:06.160 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.250 

obviously<00:01:07.160> the<00:01:07.310> speed<00:01:07.640> it<00:01:07.820> works<00:01:08.030> for<00:01:09.020> a<00:01:09.050> guy

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.260 
obviously the speed it works for a guy

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.060 
obviously the speed it works for a guy
to<00:01:09.290> make<00:01:10.570> seven<00:01:11.570> doors<00:01:11.750> like<00:01:12.050> this<00:01:12.230> and<00:01:12.740> could

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
to make seven doors like this and could

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:20.840 
to make seven doors like this and could
take<00:01:13.280> a<00:01:13.310> few<00:01:13.370> days

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.740

I think it did a great job with this so

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.460 
I think it did a great job with this so
