as you possibly can you can just skip

00:06:57.259 --> 00:06:59.350 
as you possibly can you can just skip
one<00:06:57.439> day<00:06:57.619> just<00:06:58.550> start<00:06:58.729> doing<00:06:58.789> that<00:06:58.969> your<00:06:59.180> hair

00:06:59.350 --> 00:06:59.360 
one day just start doing that your hair

one day just start doing that your hair
will<00:06:59.389> start<00:06:59.869> to<00:07:00.110> feel<00:07:00.409> less<00:07:00.770> oily<00:07:01.219> because<00:07:03.309> the

00:07:04.299 --> 00:07:04.309 
will start to feel less oily because the

00:07:04.309 --> 00:07:06.850 
will start to feel less oily because the
oil<00:07:04.520> comes<00:07:05.449> when<00:07:05.779> you<00:07:05.959> start<00:07:06.020> to<00:07:06.379> massage<00:07:06.619> that

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:06.860 
oil comes when you start to massage that

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:08.320 
oil comes when you start to massage that
scalp<00:07:07.129> and<00:07:07.309> you're<00:07:07.430> massaging<00:07:07.789> that<00:07:07.999> scalp

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:08.330 
scalp and you're massaging that scalp

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:10.659 
scalp and you're massaging that scalp
with<00:07:08.539> the<00:07:08.830> shampoo<00:07:09.830> every<00:07:10.129> time<00:07:10.279> you<00:07:10.399> wash<00:07:10.520> it

00:07:10.659 --> 00:07:10.669 
with the shampoo every time you wash it

00:07:10.669 --> 00:07:12.579 
with the shampoo every time you wash it
every<00:07:10.849> single<00:07:10.999> day<00:07:11.209> so<00:07:11.389> it's<00:07:12.020> just<00:07:12.199> gonna<00:07:12.319> keep

00:07:12.579 --> 00:07:12.589 
every single day so it's just gonna keep

00:07:12.589 --> 00:07:14.649 
every single day so it's just gonna keep
producing<00:07:13.279> that<00:07:13.580> oil<00:07:13.759> and<00:07:14.059> keep<00:07:14.270> on<00:07:14.419> and<00:07:14.539> keep

00:07:14.649 --> 00:07:14.659 
producing that oil and keep on and keep

00:07:14.659 --> 00:07:16.179 
producing that oil and keep on and keep
on<00:07:14.779> and<00:07:14.959> so<00:07:15.379> you<00:07:15.439> kind<00:07:15.619> of<00:07:15.649> have<00:07:15.800> to<00:07:15.830> break<00:07:16.039> it

00:07:16.179 --> 00:07:16.189 
on and so you kind of have to break it

00:07:16.189 --> 00:07:19.480 
on and so you kind of have to break it
out<00:07:16.279> of<00:07:16.370> its<00:07:16.490> little<00:07:16.580> Rhett<00:07:16.909> and<00:07:18.219> then<00:07:19.219> it<00:07:19.370> will

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:21.399 
out of its little Rhett and then it will
start<00:07:19.639> to<00:07:19.759> be<00:07:19.849> less<00:07:19.999> oily<00:07:20.180> my<00:07:20.809> hair<00:07:20.959> used<00:07:21.199> to<00:07:21.259> be
