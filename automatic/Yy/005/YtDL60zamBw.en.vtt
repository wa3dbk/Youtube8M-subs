it's<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.460> little<00:00:44.670> more<00:00:44.789> complex<00:00:45.360> it<00:00:46.200> is<00:00:46.410> a

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
it's a little more complex it is a

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.590 
it's a little more complex it is a
little<00:00:46.860> it's<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.340> tad<00:00:47.579> more<00:00:47.610> expensive<00:00:48.450> than

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
little it's a tad more expensive than

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.350 
little it's a tad more expensive than
most<00:00:48.870> cases<00:00:49.110> out<00:00:49.440> there<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.920> it's<00:00:50.879> pretty

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
most cases out there and it's pretty

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.720 
most cases out there and it's pretty
difficult<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:52.079> put<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.530> case<00:00:52.770> on<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.489> take

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
difficult to put the case on and take

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.340 
difficult to put the case on and take
off<00:00:53.910> your<00:00:53.969> iPhone<00:00:54.480> so<00:00:54.719> if<00:00:54.809> you<00:00:54.899> need<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.199> do

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
night or different things this probably

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.470 
night or different things this probably

clip<00:03:51.650> that<00:03:52.340> you<00:03:52.489> can<00:03:52.670> see<00:03:52.850> it<00:03:52.970> is<00:03:53.090> a<00:03:53.120> tad<00:03:53.569> bit

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
clip that you can see it is a tad bit

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.930 
clip that you can see it is a tad bit
thicker<00:03:54.230> gives<00:03:55.069> it<00:03:55.220> a<00:03:55.280> little<00:03:55.400> more<00:03:55.639> drop

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
thicker gives it a little more drop

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.569 
thicker gives it a little more drop
protection<00:03:56.290> and<00:03:57.290> we<00:03:57.440> feel<00:03:57.650> that<00:03:57.680> this<00:03:57.980> case<00:03:58.340> is

00:03:58.569 --> 00:03:58.579 
protection and we feel that this case is

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:01.059 
protection and we feel that this case is
a<00:03:58.609> little<00:03:58.970> bit<00:03:59.090> more<00:03:59.299> contained<00:03:59.840> yes<00:04:00.560> the<00:04:00.799> tabs

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:01.069 
a little bit more contained yes the tabs

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:02.440 
a little bit more contained yes the tabs
are<00:04:01.340> going<00:04:01.459> to<00:04:01.519> be<00:04:01.609> covered<00:04:01.970> a<00:04:02.060> little<00:04:02.299> bit

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
are going to be covered a little bit

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.300 
are going to be covered a little bit
more<00:04:02.599> you<00:04:02.780> don't<00:04:02.989> have<00:04:03.170> as<00:04:03.290> much<00:04:03.440> access<00:04:03.769> but

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
more you don't have as much access but

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.789 
more you don't have as much access but
this<00:04:04.489> is<00:04:04.700> actually<00:04:05.090> splash<00:04:05.480> resistant<00:04:06.230> it's

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:06.799 
this is actually splash resistant it's

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:09.400 
this is actually splash resistant it's
not<00:04:06.950> fully<00:04:07.190> waterproof<00:04:07.569> but<00:04:08.569> if<00:04:08.989> you're

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410 
not fully waterproof but if you're

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:11.470 
not fully waterproof but if you're
exposed<00:04:10.310> to<00:04:10.459> water<00:04:10.730> this<00:04:11.090> is<00:04:11.269> going<00:04:11.419> to

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
exposed to water this is going to

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.210 
exposed to water this is going to
protect<00:04:11.630> a<00:04:11.870> lot<00:04:12.049> better<00:04:12.260> than<00:04:12.530> the<00:04:12.739> defender

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
protect a lot better than the defender

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.650 
protect a lot better than the defender
and<00:04:13.400> gives<00:04:13.549> it<00:04:13.669> a<00:04:13.730> little<00:04:13.849> bit<00:04:14.090> better<00:04:14.269> drop

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
and gives it a little bit better drop

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.020 
and gives it a little bit better drop
protection<00:04:14.930> as<00:04:15.440> well<00:04:15.519> pretty<00:04:16.519> comfortable

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
protection as well pretty comfortable

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.599 
protection as well pretty comfortable
cases<00:04:17.479> really<00:04:18.229> probably<00:04:18.590> go<00:04:18.979> by<00:04:19.130> the<00:04:19.190> design

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609 
cases really probably go by the design

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:21.640 
cases really probably go by the design
that<00:04:19.820> you<00:04:19.940> like<00:04:20.120> most<00:04:20.479> they're<00:04:21.109> both<00:04:21.320> going<00:04:21.590> to

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
that you like most they're both going to

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:22.990 
that you like most they're both going to
give<00:04:21.829> a<00:04:21.859> great<00:04:22.190> protection

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
give a great protection

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.670 
give a great protection
I<00:04:23.030> say<00:04:23.300> that<00:04:23.480> only<00:04:23.600> key<00:04:24.080> difference<00:04:24.470> is<00:04:24.650> that

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
I say that only key difference is that

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.360 
I say that only key difference is that
this<00:04:25.040> is<00:04:25.310> splash<00:04:25.940> resistant<00:04:26.650> but<00:04:27.650> great<00:04:27.860> cases

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
this is splash resistant but great cases

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.100 
this is splash resistant but great cases
anyway<00:04:29.150> that<00:04:29.330> is<00:04:29.360> the<00:04:29.600> otterbox<00:04:29.990> defender

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
anyway that is the otterbox defender

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:31.780 
anyway that is the otterbox defender
