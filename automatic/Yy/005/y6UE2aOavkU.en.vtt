these school the original score in this

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:28.600 
these school the original score in this
movie<00:06:23.760> is<00:06:24.030> just<00:06:24.590> above<00:06:25.590> blew<00:06:26.250> my<00:06:26.580> mind<00:06:27.290> just

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:28.610 
movie is just above blew my mind just

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:31.990 
movie is just above blew my mind just
just<00:06:29.610> yeah<00:06:30.180> I<00:06:30.480> don't<00:06:30.750> know<00:06:30.930> maybe<00:06:31.140> some<00:06:31.440> people

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:32.000 
just yeah I don't know maybe some people

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.150 
just yeah I don't know maybe some people
would<00:06:33.000> think<00:06:33.030> that<00:06:33.510> it<00:06:33.690> lacks<00:06:34.020> in<00:06:34.320> story<00:06:34.710> but<00:06:34.980> I

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:35.160 
would think that it lacks in story but I

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.060 
would think that it lacks in story but I
think<00:06:35.370> the<00:06:35.490> story<00:06:35.900> holds<00:06:36.900> strong<00:06:37.350> enough<00:06:37.740> for

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:38.070 
think the story holds strong enough for

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:41.060 
think the story holds strong enough for
the<00:06:38.760> rest<00:06:38.940> of<00:06:39.120> the<00:06:39.270> film<00:06:39.510> I<00:06:39.720> don't<00:06:39.780> think<00:06:40.410> it

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:41.070 
the rest of the film I don't think it

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:43.520 
the rest of the film I don't think it
needs<00:06:41.520> to<00:06:41.670> be<00:06:41.790> anything<00:06:42.390> over<00:06:43.050> the<00:06:43.140> top<00:06:43.350> or

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:43.530 
needs to be anything over the top or

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:45.950 
needs to be anything over the top or
drum<00:06:43.770> but<00:06:44.130> dramatic<00:06:44.670> I<00:06:44.880> think<00:06:45.300> it's<00:06:45.450> a<00:06:45.600> simple

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:45.960 
drum but dramatic I think it's a simple

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.950 
drum but dramatic I think it's a simple
plot<00:06:46.230> simple<00:06:46.740> story<00:06:47.040> that<00:06:47.730> didn't<00:06:48.270> need<00:06:48.510> to<00:06:48.540> go

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:48.960 
plot simple story that didn't need to go

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.500 
plot simple story that didn't need to go
over<00:06:49.470> the<00:06:49.560> top<00:06:49.830> and<00:06:49.890> exaggerate<00:06:50.760> every<00:06:51.150> single

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:51.510 
over the top and exaggerate every single

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:53.810 
over the top and exaggerate every single
thing<00:06:51.750> it<00:06:52.200> just<00:06:52.590> had<00:06:52.800> really<00:06:53.580> great
