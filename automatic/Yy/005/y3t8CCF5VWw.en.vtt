we're<00:00:15.000> going<00:00:15.120> to<00:00:15.179> call<00:00:16.279> we<00:00:17.279> call<00:00:17.460> it<00:00:17.490> ball<00:00:17.820> and

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:19.189 
we're going to call we call it ball and

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:22.580 
we're going to call we call it ball and
the<00:00:20.189> first<00:00:20.369> we're<00:00:20.490> going<00:00:20.580> to<00:00:20.640> do<00:00:20.760> is<00:00:21.590> select

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
a circle about that size then we're

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.639 
a circle about that size then we're
going<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.610> want<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:32.850> fill<00:00:33.149> that<00:00:33.540> circle<00:00:34.079> with<00:00:34.620> a

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
going to want to fill that circle with a

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.260 
going to want to fill that circle with a
mid-tone<00:00:35.130> this<00:00:35.370> could<00:00:35.520> be<00:00:35.610> any<00:00:35.760> color<00:00:36.059> you

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
mid-tone this could be any color you

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.569 
mid-tone this could be any color you
want<00:00:36.300> as<00:00:37.110> long<00:00:37.200> as<00:00:37.410> it's<00:00:37.530> a<00:00:37.590> mid<00:00:37.770> value<00:00:38.160> the

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
want as long as it's a mid value the

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:39.709 
want as long as it's a mid value the
reason<00:00:38.790> has<00:00:38.879> to<00:00:38.940> be<00:00:39.030> a<00:00:39.059> mid-tone<00:00:39.420> it's<00:00:39.570> because

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
reason has to be a mid-tone it's because

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.049 
reason has to be a mid-tone it's because
we<00:00:39.809> adding<00:00:40.170> other<00:00:40.320> highlights<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.640> shadow

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
we adding other highlights and shadow

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.819 
we adding other highlights and shadow
effects<00:00:42.510> to<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.840> glass<00:00:43.050> ball<00:00:43.320> to<00:00:43.530> make<00:00:43.680> it

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
effects to the glass ball to make it

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.619 
effects to the glass ball to make it
look<00:00:43.920> three-dimensional<00:00:44.219> if<00:00:45.090> we<00:00:45.210> make<00:00:45.360> this<00:00:45.570> a

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
look three-dimensional if we make this a

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.619 
look three-dimensional if we make this a
dark<00:00:46.079> color<00:00:46.399> or<00:00:47.399> a<00:00:47.460> bright<00:00:47.789> color<00:00:48.059> will<00:00:48.450> kind

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
dark color or a bright color will kind

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.240 
dark color or a bright color will kind
of<00:00:48.690> lose<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:49.050> illusion<00:00:49.559> so<00:00:49.920> you<00:00:50.010> want<00:00:50.160> to

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
of lose the illusion so you want to

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.100 
of lose the illusion so you want to
stick<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.550> mid-tone<00:00:51.000> no<00:00:51.539> matter<00:00:51.750> what<00:00:51.899> color

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
stick to a mid-tone no matter what color

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.799 
stick to a mid-tone no matter what color
you<00:00:52.289> pick<00:00:52.469> so<00:00:53.460> let's<00:00:53.940> go<00:00:54.090> ahead<00:00:54.120> with<00:00:54.329> our<00:00:54.480> gray

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
you pick so let's go ahead with our gray

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.240 
you pick so let's go ahead with our gray
and<00:00:55.649> I'm<00:00:55.800> going<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:55.980> fill<00:00:56.160> it<00:00:57.949> now<00:00:58.949> we're<00:00:59.160> going

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
and I'm going to fill it now we're going

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.539 
and I'm going to fill it now we're going
to<00:00:59.309> create<00:00:59.520> another<00:00:59.910> layer<00:01:04.369> I'm<00:01:05.369> going<00:01:05.489> to

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
to create another layer I'm going to

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.350 
to create another layer I'm going to
call<00:01:05.670> this<00:01:05.850> one<00:01:05.909> specular<00:01:08.060> this<00:01:09.060> is<00:01:09.180> going<00:01:09.299> to

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
call this one specular this is going to

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.750 
call this one specular this is going to
be<00:01:09.650> the<00:01:10.650> shiny<00:01:10.920> part<00:01:11.070> of<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.430> ball<00:01:11.549> that's

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
be the shiny part of the ball that's

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:12.950 
be the shiny part of the ball that's
what<00:01:11.880> specular<00:01:12.330> means<00:01:12.540> that's<00:01:12.780> where<00:01:12.900> the

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
what specular means that's where the

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.249 
what specular means that's where the
light<00:01:13.200> hits<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.799> glass<00:01:14.729> object<00:01:15.360> kind<00:01:16.170> of

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
light hits the glass object kind of

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.460 
light hits the glass object kind of
slowly<00:01:16.439> diffuses<00:01:17.070> off<00:01:17.750> so<00:01:18.750> let's<00:01:19.080> deselect

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
slowly diffuses off so let's deselect

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.700 
slowly diffuses off so let's deselect

that means is it's going to take any of
our<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.619> take<00:02:01.829> our<00:02:01.979> foreground<00:02:02.250> color<00:02:02.759> and

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
our to take our foreground color and

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.999 
our to take our foreground color and
let's<00:02:03.570> make<00:02:03.750> that<00:02:03.899> white<00:02:04.170> it's<00:02:04.829> going<00:02:04.950> to

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
let's make that white it's going to

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.150 
let's make that white it's going to
bleed<00:02:05.250> off<00:02:05.430> in<00:02:05.759> 20<00:02:06.229> opacity<00:02:07.229> into<00:02:07.890> full

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
bleed off in 20 opacity into full

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.859 
bleed off in 20 opacity into full
transparency<00:02:08.550> so<00:02:09.209> all<00:02:09.390> we're<00:02:09.509> going<00:02:09.629> to<00:02:09.720> see

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
transparency so all we're going to see

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.190 
transparency so all we're going to see
is<00:02:09.989> the<00:02:10.140> white<00:02:10.379> fade<00:02:11.220> off<00:02:11.400> into<00:02:11.430> nothing<00:02:12.200> once

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
is the white fade off into nothing once

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.970 
is the white fade off into nothing once
we<00:02:13.319> have<00:02:13.349> that<00:02:13.470> set

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
we have that set

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.240 
we have that set
simply<00:02:14.700> click<00:02:14.879> and<00:02:15.180> drag<00:02:15.420> from<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:15.840> top<00:02:16.220> go<00:02:17.220> a

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
simply click and drag from the top go a

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.839 
simply click and drag from the top go a
little<00:02:17.310> past<00:02:17.909> our<00:02:18.090> marquee<00:02:19.010> and<00:02:20.010> that<00:02:20.670> gives

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
little past our marquee and that gives

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:23.119 
little past our marquee and that gives
us<00:02:21.000> our<00:02:21.150> specular<00:02:21.629> if<00:02:22.590> you<00:02:22.769> want<00:02:22.920> it<00:02:23.010> more

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129 
us our specular if you want it more

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:24.500 
us our specular if you want it more
intense<00:02:23.430> you<00:02:23.640> could<00:02:23.760> do<00:02:23.879> it<00:02:24.000> again<00:02:24.060> a<00:02:24.269> little

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
intense you could do it again a little

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.750 
intense you could do it again a little
bit<00:02:24.629> like<00:02:24.870> midway<00:02:25.230> through<00:02:25.530> now<00:02:26.430> give<00:02:26.640> you<00:02:26.700> a

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
bit like midway through now give you a

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.809 
bit like midway through now give you a
little<00:02:26.970> bit<00:02:27.060> more<00:02:27.209> shine<00:02:27.480> if<00:02:27.690> you<00:02:27.780> want<00:02:28.819> okay

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
little bit more shine if you want okay

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:33.140 
little bit more shine if you want okay
so<00:02:29.879> after<00:02:30.090> that's<00:02:30.330> done<00:02:30.599> let's<00:02:30.810> give<00:02:31.739> this<00:02:32.519> new

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
so after that's done let's give this new

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:40.630 
so after that's done let's give this new
layer<00:02:37.099> just<00:02:38.099> a<00:02:38.280> little<00:02:38.940> little<00:02:39.420> bit<00:02:39.660> of

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
layer just a little little bit of

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.880 
layer just a little little bit of
Gaussian<00:02:41.640> blur<00:02:41.819> go<00:02:42.450> to<00:02:42.510> point<00:02:42.690> 5<00:02:42.810> that<00:02:43.709> just

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
Gaussian blur go to point 5 that just

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.259 
Gaussian blur go to point 5 that just
gets<00:02:44.040> rid<00:02:44.190> of<00:02:44.250> the<00:02:44.310> sharpness<00:02:44.700> so<00:02:44.940> it<00:02:45.030> doesn't

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
gets rid of the sharpness so it doesn't

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:48.589 
gets rid of the sharpness so it doesn't
look<00:02:45.420> so<00:02:45.690> computer-generated<00:02:47.360> after<00:02:48.360> we<00:02:48.480> do

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 
look so computer-generated after we do

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:51.050 
look so computer-generated after we do
that<00:02:48.799> we're<00:02:49.799> simply<00:02:50.129> going<00:02:50.310> to<00:02:50.400> duplicate

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
that we're simply going to duplicate

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.470 
that we're simply going to duplicate
this<00:02:51.150> layer<00:02:52.879> okay<00:02:53.879> i'm<00:02:53.970> going<00:02:54.120> to<00:02:54.180> call<00:02:54.329> this

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
this layer okay i'm going to call this

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.900 
this layer okay i'm going to call this
bounce<00:02:54.750> that<00:02:55.680> sounds<00:02:56.040> for<00:02:56.160> that<00:02:56.489> stands<00:02:56.730> for

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
bounce that sounds for that stands for

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.630 
bounce that sounds for that stands for
bounce<00:02:57.090> light<00:02:58.040> this<00:02:59.040> is<00:02:59.220> really<00:02:59.400> going<00:02:59.579> to

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
bounce light this is really going to

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.990 
bounce light this is really going to
sell<00:02:59.970> the<00:03:00.590> lighting<00:03:01.590> portion<00:03:02.069> of<00:03:02.340> our<00:03:02.700> glass

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
sell the lighting portion of our glass

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.490 
sell the lighting portion of our glass
ball<00:03:03.980> so<00:03:04.980> first<00:03:05.400> we're<00:03:05.489> going<00:03:05.579> to<00:03:05.670> do<00:03:05.790> is<00:03:06.440> go<00:03:07.440> to

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
ball so first we're going to do is go to

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.449 
ball so first we're going to do is go to
edit<00:03:08.129> transform<00:03:08.579> and<00:03:09.120> then<00:03:09.599> flip<00:03:09.930> vertical<00:03:10.459> so

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
edit transform and then flip vertical so

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.569 
edit transform and then flip vertical so
we<00:03:11.579> have<00:03:11.730> the<00:03:12.209> wider<00:03:13.140> portion<00:03:13.799> of<00:03:13.980> this<00:03:14.190> circle

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:14.579 
we have the wider portion of this circle

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:17.210 
we have the wider portion of this circle
on<00:03:14.670> the<00:03:14.760> bottom<00:03:15.440> ok<00:03:16.440> the<00:03:16.680> next<00:03:16.709> thing<00:03:17.010> we<00:03:17.190> want

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
on the bottom ok the next thing we want

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.580 
on the bottom ok the next thing we want
to<00:03:17.459> do<00:03:17.609> is<00:03:17.910> go<00:03:18.090> to<00:03:18.180> edit<00:03:18.480> transform<00:03:19.290> and<00:03:19.799> scale

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
to do is go to edit transform and scale

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.920 
to do is go to edit transform and scale
and<00:03:22.590> you<00:03:22.620> want<00:03:22.859> to<00:03:22.950> scale<00:03:23.250> it<00:03:23.280> out<00:03:23.609> so<00:03:24.299> that<00:03:24.750> the

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
and you want to scale it out so that the

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:31.360 
and you want to scale it out so that the
bottom<00:03:25.470> contour<00:03:27.290> of<00:03:28.290> this<00:03:29.130> bounced<00:03:29.579> light

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
bottom contour of this bounced light

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.580 
bottom contour of this bounced light
matches<00:03:32.370> up<00:03:32.669> at<00:03:32.790> the<00:03:32.849> bottom<00:03:33.180> of<00:03:33.209> our<00:03:33.590> main

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
matches up at the bottom of our main

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.690 
matches up at the bottom of our main
ball<00:03:35.250> area<00:03:36.150> so<00:03:37.109> that's<00:03:37.169> pretty<00:03:37.470> good<00:03:37.669> so<00:03:38.669> now

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
ball area so that's pretty good so now

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.520 
ball area so that's pretty good so now
the<00:03:38.970> next<00:03:39.239> thing<00:03:39.359> you're<00:03:39.510> going<00:03:39.660> to<00:03:39.720> do<00:03:39.870> is<00:03:40.349> go

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
the next thing you're going to do is go

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.240 
the next thing you're going to do is go
to<00:03:40.590> filter<00:03:41.419> we're<00:03:42.419> gonna<00:03:42.569> go<00:03:42.630> to<00:03:42.660> blur<00:03:42.900> again

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
to filter we're gonna go to blur again

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.650 
to filter we're gonna go to blur again
Gaussian<00:03:44.250> blur<00:03:44.400> this<00:03:45.180> time<00:03:45.359> we're<00:03:45.450> gonna<00:03:45.569> make

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
Gaussian blur this time we're gonna make

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:46.879 
Gaussian blur this time we're gonna make
it<00:03:45.810> pretty<00:03:46.019> intense<00:03:46.319> we're<00:03:46.500> gonna<00:03:46.590> go<00:03:46.680> to<00:03:46.769> like

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:46.889 
it pretty intense we're gonna go to like

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:55.970 
it pretty intense we're gonna go to like
four<00:03:47.720> yeah<00:03:49.549> let's<00:03:50.549> go<00:03:50.700> to<00:03:50.760> like

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.880 

I'd<00:03:56.610> say<00:03:56.790> about<00:03:56.940> 11<00:03:57.360> 11<00:03:58.110> is<00:03:58.260> pretty<00:03:58.500> good<00:03:58.650> for

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
I'd say about 11 11 is pretty good for

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.270 
I'd say about 11 11 is pretty good for
this<00:03:59.159> size<00:03:59.400> image<00:04:00.709> and<00:04:01.709> that's<00:04:01.920> pretty<00:04:02.159> much

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
this size image and that's pretty much

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.630 
this size image and that's pretty much
it<00:04:02.430> for<00:04:02.670> our<00:04:03.180> highlights<00:04:03.780> now<00:04:04.409> to<00:04:05.310> make<00:04:05.459> the

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
it for our highlights now to make the

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.970 
it for our highlights now to make the
gray<00:04:06.510> area<00:04:06.900> look<00:04:07.049> more<00:04:07.230> three-dimensional

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
gray area look more three-dimensional

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.300 
gray area look more three-dimensional
we're<00:04:08.760> going<00:04:08.879> to<00:04:08.940> select<00:04:09.150> that<00:04:10.099> make<00:04:11.099> sure<00:04:11.129> you

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
we're going to select that make sure you

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.940 
we're going to select that make sure you
haven't<00:04:11.430> selected<00:04:11.640> down<00:04:12.000> here<00:04:12.650> and<00:04:13.650> we're

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
haven't selected down here and we're

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.759 
haven't selected down here and we're
going<00:04:14.069> to<00:04:14.129> go<00:04:14.190> to<00:04:14.250> our<00:04:14.280> lair<00:04:14.549> and<00:04:15.560> let's<00:04:16.560> go<00:04:16.680> to

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
going to go to our lair and let's go to

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:18.430 
going to go to our lair and let's go to
our<00:04:16.829> layer<00:04:17.070> styles<00:04:17.579> we're<00:04:18.060> going<00:04:18.150> to<00:04:18.239> go<00:04:18.389> to

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
our layer styles we're going to go to

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
inner shadow now distance you want to

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.020 
inner shadow now distance you want to
keep<00:04:24.389> 20<00:04:25.190> distance<00:04:26.190> just<00:04:26.430> tells<00:04:26.699> it<00:04:26.880> how<00:04:27.000> to

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
keep 20 distance just tells it how to

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.480 
keep 20 distance just tells it how to
draw<00:04:27.540> the<00:04:28.050> three-dimensional<00:04:28.800> shadow<00:04:29.010> and

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
draw the three-dimensional shadow and

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.939 
draw the three-dimensional shadow and
the<00:04:30.199> distance<00:04:31.199> of<00:04:31.320> which<00:04:31.440> it<00:04:31.590> wants<00:04:31.800> to

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:31.949 
the distance of which it wants to

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:33.980 
the distance of which it wants to

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
basically shut to start from the shadow

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.800 
basically shut to start from the shadow
to<00:04:34.139> your<00:04:34.380> shape<00:04:35.419> since<00:04:36.419> we're<00:04:36.539> not<00:04:36.600> going<00:04:36.750> to

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
to your shape since we're not going to

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.719 
to your shape since we're not going to
be<00:04:36.870> using<00:04:37.080> using<00:04:37.560> it<00:04:37.770> in<00:04:37.889> this<00:04:37.979> context<00:04:38.580> when

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:38.729 
be using using it in this context when

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:40.370 
be using using it in this context when
keep<00:04:38.850> that<00:04:39.000> down<00:04:39.090> to<00:04:39.240> zero<00:04:39.539> and<00:04:39.750> bump<00:04:39.990> our<00:04:40.139> size

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380 
keep that down to zero and bump our size

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.590 
keep that down to zero and bump our size
up<00:04:40.650> by<00:04:41.340> bumping<00:04:41.610> the<00:04:41.729> size<00:04:41.970> up<00:04:42.180> we<00:04:42.270> still<00:04:42.449> get

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
up by bumping the size up we still get

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.150 
up by bumping the size up we still get
our<00:04:42.720> nice<00:04:42.870> gradient<00:04:43.289> and<00:04:43.650> it<00:04:43.740> follows<00:04:44.010> the

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
our nice gradient and it follows the

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.340 
our nice gradient and it follows the
contour<00:04:44.610> the<00:04:44.729> inside<00:04:45.030> of<00:04:45.060> the<00:04:45.240> circle<00:04:45.449> it

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.350 
contour the inside of the circle it

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:47.960 
contour the inside of the circle it
makes<00:04:46.500> a<00:04:46.590> really<00:04:46.620> nice<00:04:47.100> three-dimensional

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
makes a really nice three-dimensional

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.450 
makes a really nice three-dimensional
look<00:04:48.320> okay<00:04:49.320> and<00:04:49.440> that's<00:04:49.590> pretty<00:04:49.800> much<00:04:49.919> it<00:04:50.070> you

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
look okay and that's pretty much it you

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.840 
look okay and that's pretty much it you
can<00:04:50.580> adjust<00:04:50.669> the<00:04:51.240> specular<00:04:51.900> and<00:04:52.610> the<00:04:53.610> bounce

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 
can adjust the specular and the bounce

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:55.730 
can adjust the specular and the bounce
lighting<00:04:54.449> after<00:04:54.750> the<00:04:54.840> fact<00:04:55.080> so<00:04:55.289> if<00:04:55.440> I<00:04:55.500> want<00:04:55.620> to

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
lighting after the fact so if I want to

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.890 
lighting after the fact so if I want to
make<00:04:55.889> this<00:04:56.010> specular<00:04:56.520> smaller<00:04:56.940> for<00:04:57.449> example

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
make this specular smaller for example

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.620 
make this specular smaller for example
or<00:04:58.020> make<00:04:58.139> it<00:04:58.289> more<00:04:58.470> intense<00:04:58.850> I<00:04:59.850> can<00:05:00.389> easily

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
or make it more intense I can easily

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.400 
or make it more intense I can easily
come<00:05:01.080> back<00:05:01.260> in<00:05:01.440> here<00:05:01.620> with<00:05:01.680> my<00:05:01.950> fill<00:05:02.220> tool<00:05:03.410> you

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.410 
come back in here with my fill tool you

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:08.300 
come back in here with my fill tool you
know<00:05:04.530> draw<00:05:04.770> another<00:05:04.950> specular<00:05:05.550> whoops<00:05:07.310> gotta

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
know draw another specular whoops gotta

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.890 
know draw another specular whoops gotta
have<00:05:08.520> it<00:05:08.610> selected<00:05:08.789> first

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
have it selected first

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:17.939 
have it selected first
select<00:05:12.330> inverse<00:05:14.699> now<00:05:15.699> we<00:05:15.759> can<00:05:16.060> do<00:05:16.150> it<00:05:16.830> you<00:05:17.830> know

00:05:17.939 --> 00:05:17.949 
select inverse now we can do it you know

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:19.550 
select inverse now we can do it you know
I<00:05:17.979> could<00:05:18.220> keep<00:05:18.370> making<00:05:18.669> this<00:05:18.759> more<00:05:18.970> intense

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
I could keep making this more intense

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.520 
I could keep making this more intense
diesel<00:05:20.560> like<00:05:20.680> that<00:05:20.860> I<00:05:20.889> could<00:05:21.190> also<00:05:22.410> you<00:05:23.410> know

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:23.530 
diesel like that I could also you know

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:25.260 
diesel like that I could also you know
play<00:05:23.770> around<00:05:23.800> with<00:05:24.220> a<00:05:24.250> little<00:05:24.490> bit<00:05:24.699> I<00:05:24.940> get<00:05:25.150> it

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270 
play around with a little bit I get it

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:26.790 
play around with a little bit I get it
how<00:05:25.389> I<00:05:25.419> want<00:05:25.600> I<00:05:26.020> can<00:05:26.080> make<00:05:26.259> it<00:05:26.380> bigger<00:05:26.500> if<00:05:26.650> I

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800 
how I want I can make it bigger if I

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:32.340 
how I want I can make it bigger if I
want<00:05:30.000> now<00:05:31.000> if<00:05:31.150> I<00:05:31.210> want<00:05:31.360> a<00:05:31.389> really<00:05:31.660> big<00:05:31.840> shine<00:05:32.080> on

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:32.350 
want now if I want a really big shine on

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:34.110 
want now if I want a really big shine on
it<00:05:32.530> so<00:05:33.100> these<00:05:33.430> are<00:05:33.490> some<00:05:33.699> of<00:05:33.729> the<00:05:33.850> things<00:05:33.910> you

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120 
it so these are some of the things you

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:38.159 
it so these are some of the things you
can<00:05:34.300> mess<00:05:34.449> around<00:05:34.479> with<00:05:35.250> so<00:05:36.870> that's<00:05:37.870> a<00:05:37.990> pretty

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:38.169 
can mess around with so that's a pretty

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:41.520 
can mess around with so that's a pretty
quick<00:05:38.500> easy<00:05:38.680> way<00:05:38.860> to<00:05:39.009> get<00:05:39.190> a<00:05:39.250> shiny<00:05:39.490> ball<00:05:40.530> like

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:41.530 
quick easy way to get a shiny ball like

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:42.840 
quick easy way to get a shiny ball like
I<00:05:41.650> said<00:05:41.710> you<00:05:42.070> could<00:05:42.160> mess<00:05:42.340> around<00:05:42.370> with<00:05:42.699> this

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:42.850 
I said you could mess around with this

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:46.560 
I said you could mess around with this
in<00:05:43.810> you<00:05:44.560> know<00:05:44.650> an<00:05:44.800> infinite<00:05:45.220> amount<00:05:45.430> of<00:05:46.330> ways

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:46.570 
in you know an infinite amount of ways

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:49.260 
in you know an infinite amount of ways
to<00:05:46.840> get<00:05:46.990> it<00:05:47.110> how<00:05:47.199> you<00:05:47.229> want<00:05:47.530> it<00:05:47.770> I<00:05:48.060> need<00:05:49.060> to<00:05:49.150> make

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:49.270 
to get it how you want it I need to make

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.750 
to get it how you want it I need to make
our<00:05:49.389> specular<00:05:49.840> real<00:05:49.990> small<00:05:50.260> if<00:05:50.440> we<00:05:50.590> want<00:05:50.830> the

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:51.760 
our specular real small if we want the

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.909 
our specular real small if we want the
smaller<00:05:52.120> you<00:05:52.330> make<00:05:52.539> the<00:05:53.050> specular<00:05:53.650> it

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:53.919 
smaller you make the specular it

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:56.159 
smaller you make the specular it
indicates<00:05:54.760> that<00:05:54.880> it's<00:05:55.120> even<00:05:55.360> more<00:05:55.539> shiny<00:05:55.960> of

00:05:56.159 --> 00:05:56.169 
indicates that it's even more shiny of

00:05:56.169 --> 00:05:57.659 
indicates that it's even more shiny of
an<00:05:56.260> object<00:05:56.710> so<00:05:56.830> keep<00:05:56.979> that<00:05:57.010> in<00:05:57.160> mind<00:05:57.370> like

00:05:57.659 --> 00:05:57.669 
an object so keep that in mind like

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:00.330 
an object so keep that in mind like
class<00:05:57.910> for<00:05:58.210> example<00:05:58.300> has<00:05:59.229> a<00:05:59.260> really<00:05:59.590> small

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:00.340 
class for example has a really small

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:04.710 
class for example has a really small
specular<00:06:00.940> amount<00:06:01.270> but<00:06:02.110> a<00:06:02.430> plastic<00:06:03.430> ball<00:06:03.639> as<00:06:04.030> a

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:04.720 
specular amount but a plastic ball as a

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.150 
specular amount but a plastic ball as a
you<00:06:05.229> know<00:06:05.349> if<00:06:05.470> it's<00:06:05.590> got<00:06:05.710> a<00:06:05.740> little<00:06:05.860> bit<00:06:06.039> of<00:06:06.070> a

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:06.160 
you know if it's got a little bit of a

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.580 
you know if it's got a little bit of a
rough<00:06:06.370> surface<00:06:06.580> on<00:06:06.970> it<00:06:07.150> has<00:06:07.240> a<00:06:07.270> wider<00:06:07.870> specular

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:08.590 
rough surface on it has a wider specular

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:11.219 
rough surface on it has a wider specular
and<00:06:08.710> that's<00:06:08.830> true<00:06:09.190> in<00:06:09.220> you<00:06:10.090> know<00:06:10.210> real<00:06:10.449> life<00:06:10.690> so

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:11.229 
and that's true in you know real life so

00:06:11.229 --> 00:06:12.510 
and that's true in you know real life so
it<00:06:11.380> helps<00:06:11.620> to<00:06:11.710> actually<00:06:11.949> look<00:06:12.130> at<00:06:12.280> real

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:12.520 
it helps to actually look at real

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:14.990 
it helps to actually look at real
reflective<00:06:13.060> objects<00:06:13.509> and<00:06:13.660> kind<00:06:14.440> of<00:06:14.620> you<00:06:14.889> know

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.000 
reflective objects and kind of you know

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.580 
reflective objects and kind of you know
