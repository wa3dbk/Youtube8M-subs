00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
most important this is when we do

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.119 
most important this is when we do
storytelling<00:02:31.269> through<00:02:31.989> the<00:02:32.230> ice<00:02:32.439> our

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:33.129 
storytelling through the ice our

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:35.460 
storytelling through the ice our
talented<00:02:33.700> artists<00:02:34.120> will<00:02:34.329> actually<00:02:34.689> car<00:02:35.019> the

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
talented artists will actually car the

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:38.109 
shapes and forms of what you will see in

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:40.140 
shapes and forms of what you will see in
the<00:02:38.170> glacier<00:02:38.739> and<00:02:38.920> they're<00:02:39.370> influenced<00:02:40.030> by

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
the glacier and they're influenced by

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.630 
the glacier and they're influenced by
nature<00:02:40.540> itself<00:02:41.140> where<00:02:41.829> the<00:02:41.950> wind<00:02:42.250> and<00:02:42.579> the
