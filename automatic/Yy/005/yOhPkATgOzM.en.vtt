yourself which I guess that would be

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.610 
yourself which I guess that would be
sewing<00:00:12.389> it<00:00:12.509> doing<00:00:12.750> it<00:00:12.840> by<00:00:12.960> yourself<00:00:13.320> or<00:00:13.500> you

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
sewing it doing it by yourself or you

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
to stand right at the edge if you try to

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.010 
to stand right at the edge if you try to
stand<00:01:21.570> right<00:01:21.689> at<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.020> back<00:01:22.170> edge<00:01:22.439> it'll<00:01:24.020> like

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
stand right at the back edge it'll like

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.649 
stand right at the back edge it'll like
when<00:01:25.229> you<00:01:25.320> jump<00:01:25.680> it<00:01:25.920> won't<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:27.030> darkness<00:01:27.479> all

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
when you jump it won't the darkness all

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.230 
when you jump it won't the darkness all
almost<00:01:28.170> instantly<00:01:28.829> hit<00:01:29.009> you<00:01:29.220> and<00:01:29.400> you<00:01:29.880> make<00:01:30.090> it

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
almost instantly hit you and you make it

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.749 
almost instantly hit you and you make it
halfway<00:01:30.420> up<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.689> wall<00:01:31.009> so<00:01:32.009> it's<00:01:32.490> kind<00:01:32.700> of

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
halfway up the wall so it's kind of

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.850 
halfway up the wall so it's kind of
crucial<00:01:32.939> to<00:01:33.210> be<00:01:33.390> hit<00:01:33.990> that<00:01:34.170> double<00:01:34.350> jump<00:01:34.680> when

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
crucial to be hit that double jump when

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.090 
crucial to be hit that double jump when
you're<00:01:35.009> back<00:01:35.780> so<00:01:36.780> just<00:01:36.810> run<00:01:37.170> double<00:01:37.560> jump<00:01:37.829> and

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
you're back so just run double jump and

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.730 
you're back so just run double jump and
go<00:01:38.340> then<00:01:39.240> make<00:01:39.479> sure<00:01:39.659> you<00:01:39.869> pop<00:01:40.320> that<00:01:40.350> night

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
go then make sure you pop that night

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.539 
go then make sure you pop that night
that<00:01:40.979> I<00:01:41.009> just<00:01:41.310> popped<00:01:41.490> and<00:01:42.479> continue<00:01:42.990> on<00:01:43.229> the

that I just popped and continue on the
old<00:01:44.549> dusty<00:01:45.180> trail<00:01:46.159> and<00:01:47.159> don't<00:01:47.340> let<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.610> lamps

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
old dusty trail and don't let the lamps

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.030 
old dusty trail and don't let the lamps
blow<00:01:48.600> you<00:01:48.659> up<00:01:48.780> they<00:01:49.290> won't<00:01:49.500> blow<00:01:49.649> you<00:01:49.710> across
