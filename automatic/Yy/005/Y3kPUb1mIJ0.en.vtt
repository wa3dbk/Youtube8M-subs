now<00:00:00.450> with<00:00:00.900> fitness<00:00:01.350> &amp;<00:00:01.589> fat<00:00:01.620> loss<00:00:01.890> there<00:00:02.760> are<00:00:02.820> a

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
now with fitness &amp; fat loss there are a

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:04.670 
now with fitness &amp; fat loss there are a
few<00:00:03.060> tools<00:00:03.300> that<00:00:03.510> are<00:00:03.659> going<00:00:04.140> to<00:00:04.259> be<00:00:04.380> really

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
few tools that are going to be really

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.110 
few tools that are going to be really
important<00:00:05.130> to<00:00:05.160> monitor<00:00:05.490> your<00:00:05.609> progress<00:00:05.670> that

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
important to monitor your progress that

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.049 
important to monitor your progress that
go<00:00:06.210> far<00:00:06.690> beyond<00:00:07.109> merely<00:00:07.620> using<00:00:08.010> a<00:00:08.040> scale<00:00:08.309> see

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
go far beyond merely using a scale see

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.570 
go far beyond merely using a scale see
one<00:00:09.179> use<00:00:09.300> a<00:00:09.330> scale<00:00:09.780> it<00:00:10.170> can<00:00:10.440> be<00:00:10.590> relatively

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
one use a scale it can be relatively

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.370 
one use a scale it can be relatively
deceptive<00:00:12.179> because<00:00:12.330> there's<00:00:12.570> no<00:00:12.840> way<00:00:13.110> you<00:00:13.170> can

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
deceptive because there's no way you can

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.620 
deceptive because there's no way you can
differentiate<00:00:13.740> between<00:00:14.150> fat<00:00:15.150> loss<00:00:15.360> and

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
differentiate between fat loss and

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.340 
differentiate between fat loss and
muscle<00:00:15.949> loss<00:00:16.949> and<00:00:17.750> obviously<00:00:18.750> we're<00:00:18.960> far<00:00:19.199> more

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
muscle loss and obviously we're far more

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.290 
muscle loss and obviously we're far more
interested<00:00:19.710> in<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:19.890> fat<00:00:20.039> loss<00:00:20.250> now<00:00:21.119> though

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
interested in the fat loss now though

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.460 
interested in the fat loss now though
this<00:00:21.449> also<00:00:21.660> has<00:00:21.900> some<00:00:22.020> very<00:00:22.050> practical

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
this also has some very practical

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.769 
this also has some very practical
implication<00:00:23.220> is<00:00:23.310> when<00:00:23.490> you're<00:00:23.670> using<00:00:24.330> the

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
implication is when you're using the

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.960 
implication is when you're using the
scale<00:00:25.199> regularly<00:00:26.070> and<00:00:26.279> your<00:00:26.430> weight<00:00:26.699> remains

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
scale regularly and your weight remains

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.279 
scale regularly and your weight remains
the<00:00:27.420> same<00:00:29.029> this<00:00:30.029> can<00:00:30.210> be<00:00:30.359> highly

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
the same this can be highly

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.870 
the same this can be highly
counterproductive<00:00:31.830> because<00:00:32.369> you<00:00:32.430> don't<00:00:32.610> know

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
counterproductive because you don't know

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.880 
counterproductive because you don't know
if<00:00:33.120> you're<00:00:33.239> losing<00:00:33.360> fat<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:33.870> gaining<00:00:34.380> muscles

if you're losing fat and gaining muscles
your<00:00:35.370> weight<00:00:35.550> alone<00:00:35.820> simply<00:00:36.510> won't<00:00:36.780> tell<00:00:37.110> you

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
your weight alone simply won't tell you

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.410 
your weight alone simply won't tell you
that<00:00:37.320> and<00:00:37.739> you<00:00:37.829> can<00:00:37.980> be<00:00:38.070> very<00:00:38.460> discouraging<00:00:39.120> if

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
that and you can be very discouraging if

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.590 
that and you can be very discouraging if
you're<00:00:39.840> trying<00:00:40.410> to<00:00:40.559> optimize<00:00:41.250> your<00:00:41.370> weight<00:00:41.600> so

respect to being relatively accurate so
what<00:01:20.430> that<00:01:20.580> means<00:01:20.790> is<00:01:21.000> that<00:01:21.030> by<00:01:21.570> day-to-day

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
what that means is that by day-to-day

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.130 
what that means is that by day-to-day
variation<00:01:22.950> is<00:01:23.100> going<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.580> be<00:01:23.670> if<00:01:24.509> it<00:01:24.750> goes<00:01:24.930> up

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
variation is going to be if it goes up

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.230 
variation is going to be if it goes up
or<00:01:25.320> down<00:01:25.350> it'll<00:01:25.740> be<00:01:25.830> it'll<00:01:26.250> be<00:01:26.340> really<00:01:26.820> precise

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
or down it'll be it'll be really precise

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.149 
or down it'll be it'll be really precise
and<00:01:27.479> it<00:01:27.570> will<00:01:27.689> take<00:01:28.200> measurements<00:01:28.680> as<00:01:28.770> up<00:01:28.950> as

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
and it will take measurements as up as

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.830 
and it will take measurements as up as
low<00:01:29.369> as<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.549> tenth<00:01:29.850> of<00:01:29.909> a<00:01:30.000> percentage<00:01:30.390> of<00:01:30.509> a<00:01:30.630> body

by one one tenth of one percent body fat

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:36.620 
by one one tenth of one percent body fat
now<00:01:34.829> less<00:01:35.070> expensive<00:01:35.579> you<00:01:35.729> can<00:01:35.880> use<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.240> cloth

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
now less expensive you can use a cloth

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.859 
now less expensive you can use a cloth
tape<00:01:36.960> measure<00:01:37.310> and<00:01:38.310> you<00:01:38.850> can<00:01:39.060> basically<00:01:39.240> use

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
tape measure and you can basically use

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.319 
tape measure and you can basically use
this<00:01:40.049> by<00:01:40.229> putting<00:01:41.130> it<00:01:41.280> around<00:01:41.369> your<00:01:41.759> waist

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
this by putting it around your waist

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.389 
this by putting it around your waist
typically<00:01:42.720> parallel<00:01:43.710> to<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:43.950> ground<00:01:44.159> and

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
typically parallel to the ground and

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.530 
typically parallel to the ground and
round<00:01:44.970> around<00:01:45.390> your<00:01:45.960> navel<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:47.329> you<00:01:48.329> want<00:01:48.479> to

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
round around your navel and you want to

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.760 
round around your navel and you want to
do<00:01:48.630> it<00:01:48.720> about<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:48.960> same<00:01:49.200> time<00:01:49.439> every<00:01:49.740> day

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
do it about the same time every day

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.550 
do it about the same time every day
because<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:51.270> your<00:01:51.780> waist<00:01:52.110> size<00:01:52.290> will<00:01:52.530> vary

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
because the your waist size will vary

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.170 
because the your waist size will vary
throughout<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.280> day<00:01:53.430> so<00:01:53.490> typically<00:01:53.939> in<00:01:54.060> the

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
around is a really good idea and the

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.510 
around is a really good idea and the
benefit<00:01:59.939> here<00:02:00.360> is<00:02:01.110> that<00:02:01.409> if<00:02:01.649> you<00:02:01.920> are<00:02:02.250> using

the scale on the scale stays the same

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.630 
the scale on the scale stays the same
and<00:02:03.990> your<00:02:04.110> tape<00:02:04.500> measurement<00:02:05.040> is<00:02:05.130> going<00:02:05.430> down
