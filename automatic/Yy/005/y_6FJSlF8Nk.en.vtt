hey Kevin what are you doing hey well I
was<00:00:10.879> using<00:00:11.059> my<00:00:11.799> rosebud<00:00:12.799> tip<00:00:13.190> on<00:00:13.459> my<00:00:13.670> oxygen

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:14.059 
was using my rosebud tip on my oxygen

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:16.179 
was using my rosebud tip on my oxygen
acetylene<00:00:14.480> torch<00:00:15.139> but<00:00:15.469> little<00:00:15.680> while<00:00:15.830> ago<00:00:16.039> I

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:16.189 
acetylene torch but little while ago I

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:18.179 
acetylene torch but little while ago I
was<00:00:16.400> working<00:00:16.730> on<00:00:16.970> this<00:00:17.150> Bell<00:00:17.359> stand<00:00:17.689> over<00:00:17.960> here

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:18.189 
was working on this Bell stand over here

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:21.970 
was working on this Bell stand over here
and<00:00:19.189> I<00:00:19.310> noticed<00:00:19.490> the<00:00:19.730> flame<00:00:20.029> was<00:00:20.480> just<00:00:20.980> really

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:21.980 
and I noticed the flame was just really

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.380 
and I noticed the flame was just really
ugly<00:00:22.099> at<00:00:22.400> the<00:00:22.519> end<00:00:22.699> so<00:00:22.880> I<00:00:22.939> thought<00:00:23.089> I'd<00:00:23.210> clean

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:23.390 
ugly at the end so I thought I'd clean

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.739 
ugly at the end so I thought I'd clean
it<00:00:24.279> so<00:00:25.279> what<00:00:25.460> are<00:00:25.519> you<00:00:25.579> using<00:00:25.789> a<00:00:25.999> rosebud<00:00:26.419> for

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:26.749 
it so what are you using a rosebud for

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:27.779 
it so what are you using a rosebud for
what's<00:00:27.050> it<00:00:27.169> do

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:27.789 
what's it do

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:30.609 
what's it do
and<00:00:28.789> this<00:00:28.939> is<00:00:29.089> the<00:00:29.179> end<00:00:29.359> and<00:00:29.539> attach<00:00:29.929> to<00:00:30.319> the

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:30.619 
and this is the end and attach to the

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:33.310 
and this is the end and attach to the
torch<00:00:31.009> handle<00:00:31.310> itself<00:00:31.939> and<00:00:32.780> it's<00:00:32.960> got<00:00:33.140> this

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 
torch handle itself and it's got this

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.630 
torch handle itself and it's got this
big<00:00:34.690> tip<00:00:35.690> on<00:00:35.930> the<00:00:36.079> end<00:00:36.200> of<00:00:36.410> it<00:00:36.530> and<00:00:37.250> you<00:00:37.460> see

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
big tip on the end of it and you see

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.430 
big tip on the end of it and you see
there's<00:00:38.000> lots<00:00:38.180> of<00:00:38.330> little<00:00:38.480> holes<00:00:38.780> in<00:00:39.140> it<00:00:39.230> right

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 
there's lots of little holes in it right

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.870 
there's lots of little holes in it right
there<00:00:41.770> and<00:00:42.770> that's<00:00:42.920> where<00:00:43.220> the<00:00:43.310> flame<00:00:43.550> comes

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:43.880 
there and that's where the flame comes

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.960 
there and that's where the flame comes
out<00:00:44.150> so<00:00:45.050> it's<00:00:45.080> called<00:00:45.770> the<00:00:45.890> rosebud<00:00:46.520> because

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:46.970 
out so it's called the rosebud because

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.570 
out so it's called the rosebud because
of<00:00:47.120> the<00:00:47.210> size<00:00:47.510> of<00:00:47.870> the<00:00:47.990> flame<00:00:48.230> it<00:00:48.530> makes<00:00:48.770> great

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:49.580 
of the size of the flame it makes great

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.750 
of the size of the flame it makes great

you're trying to join something up so
this<00:01:15.440> is<00:01:15.500> for<00:01:15.830> bending<00:01:16.220> and<00:01:16.940> this<00:01:17.180> one's<00:01:17.390> for

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
this is for bending and this one's for

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.120 
this is for bending and this one's for
welding<00:01:18.610> and<00:01:19.610> then<00:01:19.820> after<00:01:20.659> a<00:01:20.690> wild<00:01:21.050> nozzle<00:01:21.950> you

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
welding and then after a wild nozzle you

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:23.410 
welding and then after a wild nozzle you
have<00:01:22.220> a<00:01:22.280> little<00:01:22.490> holes<00:01:22.670> in<00:01:23.000> the<00:01:23.120> end<00:01:23.270> the

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
have a little holes in the end the

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:24.880 
have a little holes in the end the
orifices<00:01:23.870> in<00:01:24.080> there<00:01:24.260> thinking<00:01:24.680> a<00:01:24.770> little

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
orifices in there thinking a little

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.700 
orifices in there thinking a little
carbon<00:01:25.580> dumb<00:01:25.760> little<00:01:26.000> gunked<00:01:26.330> up<00:01:26.540> so<00:01:27.140> you<00:01:27.590> got

carbon dumb little gunked up so you got
to<00:01:27.830> come<00:01:27.979> in<00:01:28.190> with<00:01:28.460> a<00:01:31.120> tip<00:01:32.120> cleaner<00:01:32.479> you<00:01:33.440> can

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
to come in with a tip cleaner you can

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.830 
to come in with a tip cleaner you can
get<00:01:33.670> your<00:01:34.670> local<00:01:35.060> welding<00:01:35.510> supply<00:01:35.840> store<00:01:36.640> and

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
get your local welding supply store and

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:44.320 
get your local welding supply store and
you<00:01:38.840> open<00:01:39.140> them<00:01:39.260> up<00:01:39.380> and<00:01:39.620> you<00:01:39.710> think<00:01:39.950> wow<00:01:43.330> they

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 
you open them up and you think wow they

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.510 
you open them up and you think wow they
look<00:01:44.360> like<00:01:44.720> a<00:01:44.750> whole<00:01:45.080> bunch<00:01:45.380> of<00:01:45.680> little<00:01:45.920> tiny

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
look like a whole bunch of little tiny

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.920 
look like a whole bunch of little tiny
pipe<00:01:47.000> cleaners<00:01:47.619> and<00:01:48.619> all<00:01:48.740> you<00:01:48.890> do<00:01:49.100> is<00:01:49.400> you<00:01:49.930> find

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
pipe cleaners and all you do is you find

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.289 
pipe cleaners and all you do is you find
the<00:01:51.020> right<00:01:51.200> size<00:01:51.530> to<00:01:52.190> fit<00:01:52.430> them<00:01:52.640> orphis<00:01:53.000> in<00:01:53.210> the

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
the right size to fit them orphis in the

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:55.390 
the right size to fit them orphis in the
end<00:01:53.450> of<00:01:53.630> the<00:01:53.690> torch<00:01:53.930> they<00:01:54.770> have<00:01:54.979> a<00:01:55.010> little

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.400 
end of the torch they have a little

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.130 
end of the torch they have a little
chart<00:01:55.729> on<00:01:56.030> the<00:01:56.180> back<00:01:56.299> of<00:01:56.540> it<00:01:56.659> but<00:01:56.930> that's

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
chart on the back of it but that's

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.539 
chart on the back of it but that's
normally<00:01:57.500> the<00:01:57.560> first<00:01:57.770> thing<00:01:58.040> that<00:01:58.220> gets<00:01:58.369> all

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:58.549 
normally the first thing that gets all

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:00.219 
normally the first thing that gets all
dinged<00:01:58.790> up<00:01:59.030> so<00:01:59.210> you<00:01:59.299> can't<00:01:59.510> beat<00:01:59.659> it<00:01:59.840> anymore

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
dinged up so you can't beat it anymore

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:02.800 
dinged up so you can't beat it anymore
oh<00:02:00.439> I<00:02:01.100> just<00:02:01.520> start<00:02:01.909> with<00:02:02.060> one<00:02:02.240> that's<00:02:02.270> smaller

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
oh I just start with one that's smaller

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.429 
oh I just start with one that's smaller
then<00:02:03.560> the<00:02:04.340> orifice<00:02:04.729> itself<00:02:05.180> you<00:02:06.049> can<00:02:06.260> just

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:06.439 
then the orifice itself you can just

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:07.600 
then the orifice itself you can just
slide<00:02:06.619> it<00:02:06.860> down<00:02:06.979> in<00:02:07.189> there

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
slide it down in there

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.790 
slide it down in there
this<00:02:07.939> one<00:02:08.269> time<00:02:08.509> each<00:02:08.989> one<00:02:11.260> and<00:02:12.260> that<00:02:12.440> helps<00:02:12.740> to

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
this one time each one and that helps to

probably should run the file across the

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.010 
probably should run the file across the
