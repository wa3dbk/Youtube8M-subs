 she was always the best student how to do 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.780
 the tasks without light seize in the day 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:14.350
 of recesses to advance with the 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:16.750
 tasks and so not all my primary was like that 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.460
 my parents instilled me in the background 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.610
 although with education I could achieve 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.799
 many things to be internal without family 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.260

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.110

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.110
