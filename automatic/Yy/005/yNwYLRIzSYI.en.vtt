I've<00:00:58.170> really<00:00:58.559> struggled<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.980> believe<00:00:59.219> that

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
I've really struggled to believe that

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.369 
I've really struggled to believe that
this<00:00:59.850> is<00:01:00.030> actually<00:01:00.149> going<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.480> happen<00:01:00.570> just

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
this is actually going to happen just

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.779 
this is actually going to happen just
due<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.800> fact<00:01:01.949> of<00:01:02.129> all<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.489> issues<00:01:02.760> that

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
due to the fact of all the issues that

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.030 
due to the fact of all the issues that
Apple<00:01:03.210> have<00:01:03.300> had<00:01:03.449> launching<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.199> larger<00:01:04.530> screen

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
Apple have had launching a larger screen

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.460 
Apple have had launching a larger screen
on<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.400> iphone<00:01:05.729> 5<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.299> if<00:01:06.990> you<00:01:07.140> haven't<00:01:07.380> got

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
on the iphone 5 and if you haven't got

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.929 
on the iphone 5 and if you haven't got
an<00:01:07.560> iphone<00:01:07.830> 5<00:01:08.040> you<00:01:08.250> won't<00:01:08.610> sort<00:01:08.880> of

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
an iphone 5 you won't sort of

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.070 
an iphone 5 you won't sort of
necessarily<00:01:09.330> know<00:01:09.420> about<00:01:09.630> this<00:01:09.840> but

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
necessarily know about this but

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.020 
necessarily know about this but
basically<00:01:10.770> a<00:01:10.860> lot<00:01:11.100> of<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.340> apps<00:01:11.460> or<00:01:11.700> virtually

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
basically a lot of the apps or virtually

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.300 
basically a lot of the apps or virtually
all<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.330> apps<00:01:12.510> run<00:01:13.170> with<00:01:13.950> sort<00:01:14.280> of

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
all the apps run with sort of

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.100 
all the apps run with sort of
letterboxing<00:01:14.939> around<00:01:15.240> on<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.750> top<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.020> the

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
letterboxing around on the top and the

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.630 
letterboxing around on the top and the
bottom<00:01:16.140> just<00:01:16.619> because<00:01:16.920> they're<00:01:17.130> running<00:01:17.490> on

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
bottom just because they're running on

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.420 
bottom just because they're running on
the<00:01:17.790> iphone<00:01:17.939> 4<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:18.479> 4s<00:01:18.630> size<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.500> so<00:01:20.189> it<00:01:20.280> just

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
the iphone 4 and 4s size and so it just

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.010 
the iphone 4 and 4s size and so it just
kind<00:01:20.640> of<00:01:20.670> makes<00:01:20.820> you<00:01:20.939> think<00:01:21.150> why<00:01:21.810> have<00:01:21.960> i

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
kind of makes you think why have i

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.539 
kind of makes you think why have i
bothered<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.409> go<00:01:22.500> for<00:01:22.680> an<00:01:22.740> iphone<00:01:22.860> 5<00:01:23.250> if<00:01:23.430> i'm

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
bothered to go for an iphone 5 if i'm

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.490 
bothered to go for an iphone 5 if i'm
virtually<00:01:23.820> viewing<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.450> iphone<00:01:24.810> 4<00:01:25.140> version

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
virtually viewing the iphone 4 version

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.399 
virtually viewing the iphone 4 version
of<00:01:25.590> it<00:01:25.680> anyway<00:01:25.770> I<00:01:26.280> mean<00:01:27.000> it's<00:01:27.180> going<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:28.290> get

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
of it anyway I mean it's going to get

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.380 
of it anyway I mean it's going to get
better<00:01:28.619> in<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:28.890> sense<00:01:29.100> that<00:01:29.250> a<00:01:29.579> lot<00:01:30.150> of<00:01:30.210> apps

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
better in the sense that a lot of apps

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.060 
better in the sense that a lot of apps
are<00:01:30.540> updating<00:01:31.079> but<00:01:31.320> I<00:01:31.380> think<00:01:31.799> it<00:01:31.890> would<00:01:31.979> just

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
are updating but I think it would just

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.920 
are updating but I think it would just
be<00:01:32.250> an<00:01:32.310> absolute<00:01:32.729> nightmare<00:01:32.970> if<00:01:33.360> Apple<00:01:33.780> water

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
be an absolute nightmare if Apple water

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.100 
be an absolute nightmare if Apple water
have<00:01:34.530> lots<00:01:34.860> of<00:01:34.979> lots<00:01:35.130> of<00:01:35.310> different<00:01:36.110> devices

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
have lots of lots of different devices

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
of different screen sizes just because

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.460 
of different screen sizes just because
it's<00:01:39.060> a<00:01:39.119> nightmare<00:01:39.360> for<00:01:39.570> developers<00:01:40.200> to<00:01:40.229> be

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
it's a nightmare for developers to be

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.499 
it's a nightmare for developers to be
able<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.710> get<00:01:41.280> their<00:01:41.460> apt<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.790> fit<00:01:42.000> all<00:01:42.180> of<00:01:42.240> them

i mean that's low down in the post as

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.920 
i mean that's low down in the post as
you<00:01:44.460> can<00:01:44.610> see<00:01:44.729> i'm<00:01:44.820> got<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.090> tech<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.750> that's

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
you can see i'm got to tech and that's

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.499 
you can see i'm got to tech and that's
sort<00:01:46.170> of<00:01:46.200> another<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:47.000> rumor<00:01:48.000> from<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.329> nano

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
sort of another and rumor from a nano

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.420 
sort of another and rumor from a nano

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
saying that it's possible that it's

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.100 
saying that it's possible that it's
going<00:01:50.549> to<00:01:50.610> be<00:01:50.700> lots<00:01:50.850> of<00:01:51.030> different<00:01:51.390> iterations

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
going to be lots of different iterations

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.230 
going to be lots of different iterations
of<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.290> iphone<00:01:52.649> read<00:01:52.890> and<00:01:53.460> I<00:01:53.549> just<00:01:53.970> really

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
of the iphone read and I just really

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.429 
of the iphone read and I just really
don't<00:01:54.360> think<00:01:54.479> that's<00:01:54.659> going<00:01:54.840> to<00:01:54.899> happen<00:01:55.020> I

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
don't think that's going to happen I

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.590 
don't think that's going to happen I
apple<00:01:56.009> and<00:01:56.130> iPhone<00:01:56.520> have<00:01:56.759> stayed<00:01:57.000> virtually

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
apple and iPhone have stayed virtually

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.510 
apple and iPhone have stayed virtually
closed<00:01:58.170> their<00:01:58.439> ruse<00:01:58.680> ever<00:01:58.950> since<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.340> first

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
closed their ruse ever since the first

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.580 
closed their ruse ever since the first
iPhones<00:02:00.030> been<00:02:00.540> releasing<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:01.079> terms<00:02:01.350> of

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
iPhones been releasing the terms of

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.740 
iPhones been releasing the terms of
colors<00:02:01.979> in<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.520> terms<00:02:02.820> of<00:02:03.060> just<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.299> design

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
colors in the terms of just the design

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.209 
colors in the terms of just the design
and<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.140> way<00:02:04.380> it's<00:02:04.530> all<00:02:04.649> run<00:02:04.829> them<00:02:04.950> in<00:02:05.070> even

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
and the way it's all run them in even

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.609 
and the way it's all run them in even
the<00:02:05.640> software<00:02:06.149> and<00:02:06.270> it's<00:02:07.020> virtually<00:02:07.439> the<00:02:07.590> same

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
the software and it's virtually the same

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.889 
the software and it's virtually the same
so<00:02:08.429> I<00:02:08.459> think<00:02:08.670> that<00:02:08.910> Apple<00:02:09.300> like<00:02:09.330> to<00:02:09.599> keep<00:02:09.750> it

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
so I think that Apple like to keep it

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.750 
so I think that Apple like to keep it
simple<00:02:10.140> they<00:02:10.709> like<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:10.950> keep<00:02:11.160> it<00:02:11.370> you<00:02:11.640> know

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
simple they like to keep it you know

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.340 
simple they like to keep it you know
close<00:02:12.000> to<00:02:12.150> their<00:02:12.270> roots<00:02:12.480> and<00:02:12.750> anything

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
close to their roots and anything

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:14.990 
close to their roots and anything
that<00:02:13.470> I<00:02:13.500> think<00:02:13.800> it's<00:02:13.950> very<00:02:14.250> unlikely<00:02:14.670> we're

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
that I think it's very unlikely we're

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.210 
that I think it's very unlikely we're
going<00:02:15.150> to<00:02:15.240> see<00:02:15.420> I'd<00:02:16.200> be<00:02:16.350> interesting<00:02:16.770> to<00:02:16.890> hear

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
going to see I'd be interesting to hear

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.520 
going to see I'd be interesting to hear
