so I just hope that people see that in

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.199 
so I just hope that people see that in

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
darkest moments there can be sold so

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.869 
darkest moments there can be sold so
much<00:03:54.330> light<00:03:54.599> to<00:03:54.930> focus<00:03:55.409> on<00:03:55.620> that<00:03:56.129> instead<00:03:56.610> of

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:56.879 
much light to focus on that instead of

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:01.160 
much light to focus on that instead of
the<00:03:57.090> store<00:03:57.360> list<00:03:57.950> and<00:03:59.510> I<00:04:00.510> hope<00:04:00.780> that<00:04:01.019> they<00:04:01.140> can

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170
