00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
and if you use the cell killstreaks

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.290 
and if you use the cell killstreaks
blind<00:02:40.950> eye<00:02:41.160> you're<00:02:41.430> basically<00:02:41.580> not<00:02:42.000> going<00:02:42.240> to

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
blind eye you're basically not going to

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.020 
blind eye you're basically not going to
get<00:02:42.420> any<00:02:42.630> kills<00:02:42.960> and<00:02:43.170> I<00:02:43.200> had<00:02:43.790> 140,000<00:02:44.790> kills

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
get any kills and I had 140,000 kills

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.530 
get any kills and I had 140,000 kills
and<00:02:45.690> i<00:02:45.780> will<00:02:45.930> say<00:02:46.910> 138,000<00:02:47.910> we're<00:02:48.330> all

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
and i will say 138,000 we're all

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.750 
and i will say 138,000 we're all
specialists<00:02:49.230> so<00:02:49.410> i<00:02:49.620> think<00:02:49.890> that<00:02:50.370> they<00:02:50.550> need<00:02:50.700> to

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
specialists so i think that they need to

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.150 
specialists so i think that they need to
add<00:02:51.210> a<00:02:51.570> counterforce<00:02:52.290> s<00:02:52.560> and<00:02:52.740> a<00:02:52.770> blind<00:02:53.010> eye

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
add a counterforce s and a blind eye

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.980 
add a counterforce s and a blind eye
because<00:02:53.550> i<00:02:53.790> don't<00:02:54.210> like<00:02:54.270> to<00:02:54.450> play<00:02:54.600> hide<00:02:54.810> and<00:02:54.960> go

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
because i don't like to play hide and go

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:57.380 
because i don't like to play hide and go
