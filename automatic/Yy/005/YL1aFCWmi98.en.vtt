00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:09.030
 our further actions check 

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:13.370
 the presence of oil in the engine for this 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.370
 there is a probe oleg show advise 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:21.289
 oil capacity in such engines 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:26.010
 almost 500 500 approximately 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:29.220
 550 600 grams here are recommended oils 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:32.340
 here is semi-synthetic 10 to 30 10 in 40 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.550
 in our conditions it is already for our 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.760
 10.30 10k 40 or how many are there 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:43.280
 the level of your share please here 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:45.930
 slightly below the level of the oil's pour 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.879
 Naturally this is the same class as 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:55.829
 the very engine of this brix tattoo 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:57.559
 engine and oil seems to be class here 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.129
 slightly incomplete alexis level 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:01.129
 will bring to the desired level 

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:08.759
 capacity is specially made at 600 grams 

00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:10.680
 before because all the engine 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:13.130
 practically made from such a calculation that 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.899
 oil capacity 600 grams such an engine 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.750
 here along the way until Oleg pours 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:22.110
 Mass I want to say that the manufacturer 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.600
 guarantees quality 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.100
 quality work of this tool 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.840
 provided that if you comply with all 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.579
 the demands that he makes to us he 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.380
 Ahead of the first thing that matters most 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.130
 after the first five hours of work 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.509
 be sure to drain and change the oil 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.490
 after the first five hours of work in 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.189
 further after 50 hours and or 1 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.450
 season oil change here is the first 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.959
 the requirement is one of the most 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.810
 major 

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:47.849
 which impose here manufacturers 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.890
 such figures of such a tool 

00:01:47.849 --> 00:01:52.200
 in order to change the oil while we 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.380
 on the table and not filled with gas we show 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.520
 How does it change ? 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.630
 after poured 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:03.959
 he warmed up worked strangled him here 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:07.220
 Well, tilt it on the path to the side like this 

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:12.410
 and here below Oleg please show 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:15.859
 is there a smart cork wine and and and 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.859
 drain plug 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:25.489
 here and let go unscrewing little by little 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.590
 pour the oil like this and tilt and 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:30.379
 then some capacity we need q is 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.030
 bucket can some kind of box 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:33.290
 plastic bottle cut hours 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.420
 gram is a small amount and 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.459
 be sure to tighten the stopper of the probe when 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.680
 oil is drained when the oil has merged to give 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:42.019
 he has to stand up with engine oil 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.750
 so that it is glass for 10-15 minutes 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:48.049
 then we lift back concluding language 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:51.769
 we twist a drain stopper and we fill in 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:53.810
 600 grams of oil is not necessary after 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:55.819
 the first five hours of operation or in 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.040
 further after 50 hours of work or 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:59.359
 once a season 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.060
 Well, I told you myself and such 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:03.319
 simple basics if you need more 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.489
 Required instructions 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:06.859
 consult instructions 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.389
 here everything is clearly stated if something 

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:10.400
 incomprehensible please contact 

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:13.819
 service center and service center you 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:16.969
 always prompt you will always help here 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:20.120
 further we fill gasoline gasoline 

00:03:16.969 --> 00:03:22.099
 European 92 is recommended but since 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:26.799
 our gasoline quality is a little worse 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:26.799
 here and we recommend you pour 95 gasoline 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:35.810
 gasoline please fill it up 

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:37.489
 if from the cans from where do not pour not 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.829
 poured over to it was desirable 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:41.890
 mesh here necessarily because well 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:47.770
 whatever it was but still 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:49.600
 cheaper to wash the cure itself than later 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:51.790
 think how to clean the fuel system 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:55.090
 Well, when refueling with gasoline, it is desirable not 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:58.840
 pour a lot and not pour not 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:05.740
 pour the mower itself because it 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:11.080
 very unfavorably capacious here 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:13.750
 small principle here is kowley 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:16.150
 half a liter bottle 300 400 grams 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.709
 enough for a very beer offer 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:26.860
 flax and time here he has there limits 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:29.260
 300 400 grams per hour per hour of work 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:32.520
 All in this case here however strongwoman 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:36.100
 our ready our zone is ready for strength 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.990
 the first run start it and you can 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.790
 get to work well after you 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.020
 just run you need to give it to her 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:42.580
 worked a minute 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.680
 two or three so that it warms up 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.720
 entered their desired modes and principle 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.940
 you can work only when working on 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.020
 lawn mower nets 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.390
 security 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:55.750
 Naturally try to mow where 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:57.400
 no stones where there are no knots in the room 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.520
 other foreign objects that may 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:02.050
 fall under the knife and can damage 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.910
 lawn mower themselves these lawn mowers 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.740
 very good option here they are 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:09.820
 unpretentious can use them and 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:13.630
 housewives and here they are easy to start 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:17.950
 they are maneuverable 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:21.810
 her on the street and try to run it and 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:21.810
 show how it starts
