 First of all this orange person a 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.320
 It becomes an ultra drive 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:19.440
 From a soft overdrive sound 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:22.500
 We cope with a little intense overdrive 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.940

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:30.100
 This is to in overdrive 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:34.380
 Omura overdrive is a feature even more than ultra drive

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.090
 Soft chorus 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:58.750

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:10.990
 The previous worm 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:13.610
 The overdrive is more effective than the overdrive and the edge is effective 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:16.070
 It is an elder 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:19.040
