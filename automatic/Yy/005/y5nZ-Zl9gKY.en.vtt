00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 hi welcome to paris speak 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:04.759
 today we talk about mangas 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.879
 right now 

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:06.879
 but 

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:12.580
 how do you explain the success of 

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:14.380
 mangas in france guys ba already has 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.240
 given the first country already japanized from 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.790
 base and it is surely also club 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.160
 dorothée that appeared in the 80s 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:23.200
 I would say Dorothea I will go 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.880
 certainly not the originality and the 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.560
 makes it possible to find oneself 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.169
 usually in a shed this fact 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.700
 to travel is imaginary 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:31.329
 get into our culture actually in 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.190
 somehow 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:35.500
 we all dreamed of being superheroes and 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.840
 all of having really enough bitrates 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:41.680
 crazy enough that makes us out of the real world 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:43.000
 get out of our studies job so 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.140
 we feel a little more free which are the 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.170
 most badass characters that you 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:49.360
 know this is going to be the girl of one 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.250
 piece I will go especially and dragon ball z and 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.650
 vegeta in all the history of the manga 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.840
 for me there is one is sangoku of 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:58.270
 dragon ball z like him of the series x 2 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.260
 waziri clans kakashi erwin smith 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.300
 halloween more than 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.100
 shigeki is only jean houle attacks 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.439
 years kits in France it cows 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.420
 blood in trigun undertaker of black 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:10.009
 butler mine to the ensaia dances you have 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.659
 big bad ass behind aldebaran of 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:13.939
 bull month manage these pocket machines 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:19.909
 is followed but hey it's my wish the 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:20.509
 even if he loves me that's it me all that I 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:23.100
 am badass 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:24.810
 why is writing all the time my means 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.860
 surely to be heard 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.640
 maybe people are often 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:32.220
 it's a hard sound from Japanese homes and 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.740
 patata because it's faster than 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.299
 to actually talk tonight that I answer 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.920
 they are they are extremely censored 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.509
 on a lot of things are to censorship is 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.780
 sure they are censored on full 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.340
 things 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.960
 so in fact are a little actually the 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.470
 subscribers it's a bit of frustrated the 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.909
 life in general 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.310
 so if you want are people who 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.869
 is who do all that it takes all 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.799
 their fantasies with who who exploits 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.530
 all their fantasies in their mangas 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.539
 who shout use octopus 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.190
 so here is actually written a lot 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:58.530
 it's their thing they're waiting for and you 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.970
 why writing I think if the attacked 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.190
 without shouting it would be a lot less 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.050
 effects also way too yes it's for 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.009
 give them strength 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.970
 he put powers they have and 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.860
 which we think she wrote for 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.750
 really put all the rage prevail 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.940
 it's a bit like all the arts 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.830
 we do not exaggerate the other the reader I 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.940
 he will not necessarily understand m toy 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:19.260
 what is the state to go from there 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.650
 it's pornography but version 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:26.510
 manga actually 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:27.110
 r yes I'm 28 years old was eating what 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.879
 it's just a detail 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.890
 you have to know that in manga you 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:32.780
 have four types of manga you have the 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.010
 shôjo who are for girls the shônen 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.569
 who are for boys after you 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.090
 go the seinen who are mangas 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:39.290
 violent as berzerk or attack him 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.879
 titans who are for the over 16 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.140
 years and after you go hentai who are 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:43.430
 for an informed public 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.689
 so over 18 who are 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.180
 actually mangas that are based 

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:49.810
 on the sex and the Japanese perversity 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.989
 pure and hard yes that's the stuff that 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.840
 pornographic 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:54.280
 but hey that's not it 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.379
 it's not looking at I find that 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.420
 exciting not at all not at all 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:03:01.750
 I won and chis is a little less 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.280
 hard ok but its end it's weird in 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.280
 do you look more like an anime 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.140
 its maxi you necessarily after will delirium 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.150
 it is there it's rather funny but without 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.920
 more me if I look if I get excited I 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.420
 go on youporn defended wins what to 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.750
 the ariana when we see tentacles 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.250
 get out all over his traits even more 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.099
 shifted you take from reality you 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.060
 take mangas I do not think that in 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:23.860
 the reality we could sink a 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.420
 watermelon in derche this concept 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.489
 recurring so I do not look at it no 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.810
 I do not look I put gerard garden 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:32.709
 never even have the episode with the 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:35.980
 octopus with tentacles never that weird 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:37.200
 but erotically from the animate 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:41.860
 would recommend for a novice 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:43.060
 I would say naruto way cobra nicky 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.280
 larson 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.380
 and dragon ball z from the base of the photos 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.450
 it's the really manga that has to be 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.800
 not look at the one piece bleach and 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.910
 other fairy tail if he has a lot 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.160
 a lot of time on the track 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.470
 it's a very good manga on pirates 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.819
 I kept no naruto one piece 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.420
 bleach because it's series are 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:00.940
 very very long 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.530
 the attacked titans since that's when 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.599
 even a universe that is quite special 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.220
 start with height x hunter it's a 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:07.989
 pretty simple fullmetal story 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.400
 alchemist metal alchimist l alchemy 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:11.340
 it's a very very good manga 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.660
 the metal alchimist fullmetal alchemist 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.650
 samurai champloo so that the mangas get 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.930
 are they in black and white is not in 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.380
 color I think it's also the 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.669
 charm 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.720
 after that is my opinion but it's 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:21.250
 really the center of a manga that's the 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.800
 see black and white this scout surely 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:26.139
 printed cheaper and also because 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.550
 there is a big job in the levels 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:28.780
 of gray then facilitates the work at 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.060
 shadow level and what makes them 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.919
 differentiates from a comics or comics 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.419
 american precisely was black and 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:35.889
 white face watching them on TV 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:37.720
 yes, it's good that it's in 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:39.460
 colors it was a manga you would be 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:44.350
 which one piece 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:45.910
 direct one piece a manga cnca are some 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:50.319
 zodiac knights and inat ayew 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:52.389
 gadin to rothau cosic it's rather naruto 

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:53.710
 acquired rate of his online art down this 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:56.259

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.720
 enter x hunter will be naruto naruto but

 on the thematic artistic level it to 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.780
 transcend cultural barriers 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:15.699
