peaceful ends Islam is a religion so
then<00:03:04.810> the<00:03:04.930> question<00:03:05.050> is<00:03:05.470> next<00:03:06.280> how<00:03:06.550> do<00:03:06.610> we

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
then the question is next how do we

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.030 
then the question is next how do we
define<00:03:07.210> this<00:03:07.450> religion<00:03:07.930> if<00:03:08.080> essentially<00:03:08.920> it's

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
define this religion if essentially it's

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.300 
define this religion if essentially it's
not<00:03:09.100> one<00:03:09.400> of<00:03:09.520> peace<00:03:09.700> or<00:03:10.000> violence<00:03:10.720> it's<00:03:11.560> by<00:03:11.860> the

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
not one of peace or violence it's by the

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.430 
not one of peace or violence it's by the
majority<00:03:12.850> of<00:03:12.880> Muslims<00:03:13.060> who<00:03:13.780> interpret<00:03:14.290> it

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
majority of Muslims who interpret it

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.880 
majority of Muslims who interpret it
today<00:03:14.950> and<00:03:15.880> this<00:03:16.000> poses<00:03:16.270> two<00:03:17.110> particularly

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
today and this poses two particularly

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.880 
today and this poses two particularly
acute<00:03:18.280> challenges<00:03:18.510> one<00:03:19.510> is<00:03:19.720> yes<00:03:20.290> the<00:03:20.470> majority

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
acute challenges one is yes the majority

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.010 
acute challenges one is yes the majority
of<00:03:20.950> Muslims<00:03:21.070> today<00:03:21.460> are<00:03:21.610> not<00:03:22.240> terrorists<00:03:22.870> even

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:23.020 
of Muslims today are not terrorists even

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.080 
of Muslims today are not terrorists even
Iran<00:03:23.230> will<00:03:23.560> concede<00:03:23.920> this<00:03:24.130> the<00:03:24.550> majority<00:03:25.000> of

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
Iran will concede this the majority of

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.650 
Iran will concede this the majority of
Muslims<00:03:25.450> today<00:03:25.630> are<00:03:25.780> not<00:03:26.530> terrorists<00:03:27.310> and<00:03:27.660> so

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
Muslims today are not terrorists and so

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.810 
Muslims today are not terrorists and so
one<00:03:28.840> can<00:03:29.050> confidently<00:03:29.380> say<00:03:29.800> that<00:03:30.340> Islam<00:03:30.640> is

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820 
one can confidently say that Islam is

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.610 
one can confidently say that Islam is
not<00:03:30.850> a<00:03:31.000> religion<00:03:31.150> of<00:03:31.450> terrorism<00:03:31.780> if<00:03:32.080> we're

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
not a religion of terrorism if we're

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.180 
not a religion of terrorism if we're
defining<00:03:33.100> the<00:03:33.160> religion<00:03:33.520> by<00:03:33.640> its<00:03:33.760> followers

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
defining the religion by its followers

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.440 
defining the religion by its followers
however<00:03:36.190> that<00:03:36.820> doesn't<00:03:37.000> get<00:03:37.210> us<00:03:37.240> off

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
however that doesn't get us off

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.750 
however that doesn't get us off
scot-free<00:03:37.900> as<00:03:37.990> Muslims<00:03:38.700> otherwise<00:03:39.700> I

scot-free as Muslims otherwise I

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.040 
scot-free as Muslims otherwise I
wouldn't<00:03:40.090> be<00:03:40.150> doing<00:03:40.210> what<00:03:40.480> I<00:03:40.510> do<00:03:40.630> to<00:03:40.900> challenge

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.050 
wouldn't be doing what I do to challenge

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:44.040 
wouldn't be doing what I do to challenge
extremism<00:03:41.560> around<00:03:42.160> the<00:03:42.460> world<00:03:42.930> because<00:03:43.930> the

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.050 
extremism around the world because the

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:45.630 
extremism around the world because the
majority<00:03:44.200> of<00:03:44.560> Muslims<00:03:44.950> today<00:03:45.100> are<00:03:45.400> yet<00:03:45.610> to

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
majority of Muslims today are yet to

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.560 
majority of Muslims today are yet to
arrive<00:03:45.820> in<00:03:46.710> any<00:03:47.710> form<00:03:48.280> of<00:03:48.520> tangible<00:03:49.330> concrete

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:49.570 
arrive in any form of tangible concrete

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:52.230 
arrive in any form of tangible concrete
way<00:03:50.020> to<00:03:50.710> what<00:03:51.220> we<00:03:51.400> would<00:03:51.520> understand<00:03:51.970> as

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:52.240 
way to what we would understand as

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.390 
way to what we would understand as
liberal<00:03:52.690> democratic<00:03:53.440> systems<00:03:53.980> of<00:03:54.130> governance

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
liberal democratic systems of governance

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.920 
liberal democratic systems of governance
and<00:03:55.920> so<00:03:56.920> though<00:03:57.580> Islam<00:03:57.940> today<00:03:58.390> cannot<00:03:58.810> be

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
and so though Islam today cannot be

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.020 
and so though Islam today cannot be
classified<00:03:59.560> as<00:03:59.800> a<00:04:00.010> religion<00:04:00.400> of<00:04:00.490> terrorism

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
classified as a religion of terrorism

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.600 
classified as a religion of terrorism
it<00:04:01.360> also<00:04:01.600> doesn't<00:04:01.900> make<00:04:02.080> sense<00:04:02.440> to<00:04:03.070> classify

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 
it also doesn't make sense to classify

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.140 
it also doesn't make sense to classify
Islam<00:04:03.970> today<00:04:04.210> as<00:04:04.660> a<00:04:05.530> religion<00:04:06.040> of<00:04:06.160> harmony<00:04:07.000> of

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
Islam today as a religion of harmony of

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.300 
Islam today as a religion of harmony of
tolerance<00:04:07.960> because<00:04:08.440> of<00:04:08.680> course<00:04:08.920> we<00:04:09.070> see

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
tolerance because of course we see

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:10.290 
tolerance because of course we see
around<00:04:09.400> the<00:04:09.670> world<00:04:09.700> that<00:04:10.000> there's<00:04:10.150> much

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:10.300 
around the world that there's much

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.570 
around the world that there's much
