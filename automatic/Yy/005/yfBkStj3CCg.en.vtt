00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:03.379 

okay<00:00:01.949> in<00:00:02.159> this<00:00:02.310> tutorial<00:00:02.550> we're<00:00:03.030> gonna<00:00:03.090> take

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
okay in this tutorial we're gonna take

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:04.789 
okay in this tutorial we're gonna take
another<00:00:03.659> look<00:00:03.899> at<00:00:04.049> some<00:00:04.319> other<00:00:04.440> features

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
another look at some other features

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.099 
another look at some other features
concerning<00:00:05.549> rigid<00:00:05.819> body<00:00:06.000> dynamics<00:00:06.120> in<00:00:06.839> the

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
concerning rigid body dynamics in the

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.879 
concerning rigid body dynamics in the
new<00:00:07.230> version<00:00:07.620> 2.66<00:00:08.580> okay<00:00:09.480> so<00:00:09.540> now<00:00:09.870> I<00:00:09.929> have<00:00:10.230> all

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
new version 2.66 okay so now I have all

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.379 
new version 2.66 okay so now I have all
just<00:00:11.219> four<00:00:11.460> different<00:00:11.730> cubes<00:00:11.940> in<00:00:12.090> the<00:00:12.179> scene

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
just four different cubes in the scene

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.660 
just four different cubes in the scene
and<00:00:12.660> two<00:00:13.530> different<00:00:13.830> ground<00:00:14.040> planes<00:00:14.340> actually

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
and two different ground planes actually

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.460 
and two different ground planes actually
notice<00:00:15.089> here<00:00:15.240> there's<00:00:15.599> plane<00:00:15.929> a<00:00:15.960> click<00:00:16.379> it

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
notice here there's plane a click it

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.320 
notice here there's plane a click it
again<00:00:16.560> it's<00:00:16.920> plane<00:00:17.130> down<00:00:17.369> to<00:00:17.400> zero<00:00:17.789> zero<00:00:18.090> one

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
again it's plane down to zero zero one

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.990 
again it's plane down to zero zero one
all<00:00:18.960> right<00:00:19.080> so<00:00:19.590> what<00:00:20.039> what<00:00:20.520> we're<00:00:20.640> doing<00:00:20.880> in

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
all right so what what we're doing in

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.750 
all right so what what we're doing in
here<00:00:21.270> is<00:00:21.420> this<00:00:21.660> is<00:00:21.900> a<00:00:22.320> setup<00:00:23.160> that's<00:00:23.460> similar

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
here is this is a setup that's similar

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.790 
here is this is a setup that's similar
to<00:00:24.000> using<00:00:24.180> layers<00:00:24.630> when<00:00:25.320> you're<00:00:25.439> using<00:00:25.590> the

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
to using layers when you're using the

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.679 
to using layers when you're using the
physics<00:00:26.160> button<00:00:26.460> and<00:00:26.699> cloth<00:00:27.000> effects<00:00:27.420> and

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
physics button and cloth effects and

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.990 
physics button and cloth effects and
soft<00:00:27.869> bodies<00:00:28.230> remember<00:00:29.160> how<00:00:29.279> they<00:00:29.460> can<00:00:29.640> be<00:00:29.849> on

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
soft bodies remember how they can be on

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.999 
soft bodies remember how they can be on
individual<00:00:30.689> layers<00:00:30.929> to<00:00:31.289> do<00:00:31.439> their<00:00:31.590> own<00:00:31.619> things

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
individual layers to do their own things

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.209 
individual layers to do their own things
well<00:00:32.759> in<00:00:32.790> this<00:00:33.000> case<00:00:33.260> this<00:00:34.260> is<00:00:34.500> set<00:00:34.800> up<00:00:34.950> as<00:00:35.100> an

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
well in this case this is set up as an

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.819 
well in this case this is set up as an
active<00:00:35.550> object<00:00:35.969> in<00:00:36.120> rigid<00:00:36.450> bodies<00:00:36.780> here<00:00:37.050> you

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
active object in rigid bodies here you

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.709 
active object in rigid bodies here you
know<00:00:37.950> they're<00:00:38.190> all<00:00:38.340> active<00:00:38.820> these<00:00:39.149> cases<00:00:39.570> and

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
know they're all active these cases and

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.810 
know they're all active these cases and
these<00:00:39.809> two<00:00:40.079> planes<00:00:40.410> are<00:00:40.649> setup<00:00:41.070> is<00:00:41.219> passive

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
these two planes are setup is passive

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.389 
these two planes are setup is passive
objects<00:00:42.239> alright<00:00:43.020> so<00:00:43.680> let<00:00:43.890> me<00:00:43.920> just<00:00:44.070> run<00:00:44.309> the

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
objects alright so let me just run the

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.670 
objects alright so let me just run the
simulation<00:00:44.910> real<00:00:45.090> quick<00:00:45.360> you'll<00:00:45.690> see<00:00:45.930> they

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
simulation real quick you'll see they

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.130 
simulation real quick you'll see they
come<00:00:46.860> down<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.370> run<00:00:47.969> into<00:00:48.149> each<00:00:48.300> other<00:00:48.510> like

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
come down and run into each other like

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.080 
come down and run into each other like
you<00:00:49.320> would<00:00:49.440> expect<00:00:49.850> okay

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
you would expect okay

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.770 
you would expect okay
however<00:00:51.719> if<00:00:52.140> I<00:00:52.350> was<00:00:52.500> to<00:00:52.770> move<00:00:53.520> these<00:00:53.969> over<00:00:54.000> here

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
however if I was to move these over here

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.260 
however if I was to move these over here
like<00:00:55.199> this<00:00:55.500> move<00:00:55.829> this<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.309> this<00:00:56.430> side<00:00:56.730> and

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
like this move this to this side and

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.840 
like this move this to this side and
move<00:00:57.629> this<00:00:57.809> one<00:00:58.079> on<00:00:58.260> top<00:00:58.500> of<00:00:58.559> this<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.250> let<00:00:59.820> it

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
move this one on top of this and let it

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.539 
move this one on top of this and let it
again<00:01:01.309> notice<00:01:02.309> this<00:01:02.550> oranges<00:01:03.480> cube<00:01:03.840> doesn't

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:04.549 
again notice this oranges cube doesn't

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:06.740 
again notice this oranges cube doesn't
do<00:01:05.549> anything<00:01:05.880> even<00:01:06.150> though<00:01:06.240> it's<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.450> rigid

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
do anything even though it's a rigid

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.530 
do anything even though it's a rigid
body<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.260> yet<00:01:07.920> I<00:01:08.189> mean<00:01:08.580> even<00:01:09.240> though<00:01:09.360> it

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
body and yet I mean even though it

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.929 
body and yet I mean even though it
bounces<00:01:10.320> off<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.530> plane<00:01:10.830> well<00:01:11.460> what<00:01:11.820> it's

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
bounces off the plane well what it's

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.780 
bounces off the plane well what it's
doing<00:01:12.240> is<00:01:12.360> it's<00:01:12.689> bouncing<00:01:13.170> off<00:01:13.320> its<00:01:14.250> own<00:01:14.460> plane

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
doing is it's bouncing off its own plane

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.730 
doing is it's bouncing off its own plane
and<00:01:14.820> it's<00:01:15.180> bouncing<00:01:15.630> off<00:01:15.780> its<00:01:16.020> own<00:01:16.200> plane<00:01:16.500> but

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
and it's bouncing off its own plane but

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.469 
and it's bouncing off its own plane but
these<00:01:16.890> guys<00:01:17.040> are<00:01:17.310> essentially<00:01:17.880> on<00:01:18.000> separate

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
these guys are essentially on separate

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.469 
these guys are essentially on separate
layers<00:01:18.799> but<00:01:19.799> they're<00:01:19.979> not<00:01:20.100> layers<00:01:20.490> let's<00:01:21.299> go

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
layers but they're not layers let's go

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.660 
layers but they're not layers let's go
over<00:01:21.689> here<00:01:22.020> what<00:01:22.590> they<00:01:22.740> are<00:01:22.920> is<00:01:23.159> in<00:01:23.340> this<00:01:23.490> case

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
over here what they are is in this case

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.940 
over here what they are is in this case
collision<00:01:24.150> groups<00:01:24.360> it<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:25.500> second<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:25.860> look

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
collision groups it the second you look

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.679 
collision groups it the second you look
at<00:01:26.159> it<00:01:26.280> will<00:01:26.369> become<00:01:26.640> obvious<00:01:26.850> unless<00:01:27.509> you're

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
at it will become obvious unless you're

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.380 
at it will become obvious unless you're
not<00:01:27.810> familiar<00:01:27.990> with<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:28.590> then<00:01:29.100> but<00:01:29.970> what's

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
not familiar with it and then but what's

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.240 
not familiar with it and then but what's
nice<00:01:30.570> is<00:01:30.810> you<00:01:30.990> can<00:01:31.049> combine<00:01:31.320> that<00:01:31.680> with<00:01:31.740> other

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
nice is you can combine that with other

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.140 
nice is you can combine that with other
effects<00:01:33.150> so<00:01:34.070> basically<00:01:35.070> if<00:01:35.310> you<00:01:35.369> notice<00:01:36.030> this

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
effects so basically if you notice this

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:36.649 
effects so basically if you notice this
one

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
one

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.850 
one
it's<00:01:37.079> on<00:01:37.320> layer<00:01:38.280> 2<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:39.000> this<00:01:39.420> one's<00:01:39.659> on<00:01:39.930> layer

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
it's on layer 2 and this one's on layer

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.340 
it's on layer 2 and this one's on layer
2<00:01:41.009> or<00:01:41.820> a<00:01:41.850> collision<00:01:42.360> group<00:01:42.570> 2<00:01:42.780> I<00:01:42.810> should<00:01:42.930> say

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
2 or a collision group 2 I should say

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.679 
2 or a collision group 2 I should say
and<00:01:43.649> that<00:01:44.250> one's<00:01:44.460> on<00:01:44.640> one<00:01:44.880> that<00:01:45.119> one's<00:01:45.329> on<00:01:45.479> one

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
and that one's on one that one's on one

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.450 
and that one's on one that one's on one
and<00:01:45.930> this<00:01:46.350> first<00:01:46.619> ground<00:01:47.009> plane<00:01:47.369> is<00:01:47.840> on<00:01:49.460> this

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
and this first ground plane is on this

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.399 
and this first ground plane is on this
second<00:01:50.909> one<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.630> other<00:01:51.750> one<00:01:51.960> is<00:01:52.110> on<00:01:52.290> the

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
second one and the other one is on the

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.050 
second one and the other one is on the
first<00:01:52.649> one<00:01:52.860> like<00:01:53.070> that<00:01:53.149> alright<00:01:54.149> so<00:01:55.939> that<00:01:56.939> way

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
first one like that alright so that way

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.539 
first one like that alright so that way
only<00:01:57.420> certain<00:01:58.049> objects<00:01:58.439> collide<00:01:59.369> with

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
only certain objects collide with

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.490 
only certain objects collide with
certain<00:01:59.790> objects<00:02:00.149> if<00:02:00.299> you<00:02:00.329> want<00:02:00.509> to<00:02:00.630> restrict

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
certain objects if you want to restrict

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.240 
certain objects if you want to restrict
it<00:02:01.710> that<00:02:01.860> way

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
it that way

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.160 
it that way
very<00:02:02.549> powerful<00:02:02.790> cool<00:02:03.270> little<00:02:03.509> feature<00:02:03.750> I<00:02:03.899> must

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
very powerful cool little feature I must

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.109 
very powerful cool little feature I must
say<00:02:04.320> for<00:02:05.219> making<00:02:05.520> it<00:02:05.640> work

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
say for making it work

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.080 
say for making it work
so<00:02:06.869> there's

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
so there's

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.930 
so there's
yeah<00:02:09.090> cause<00:02:09.569> without<00:02:09.899> but<00:02:10.140> it<00:02:10.229> won't<00:02:10.410> collide

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
yeah cause without but it won't collide

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.420 
yeah cause without but it won't collide
with<00:02:11.940> that<00:02:12.090> one<00:02:12.269> there<00:02:12.480> okay<00:02:13.200> so<00:02:13.709> that's

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
with that one there okay so that's

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:15.530 
with that one there okay so that's
really<00:02:14.670> straightforward<00:02:14.940> and<00:02:15.360> then<00:02:15.450> of

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
really straightforward and then of

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.869 
really straightforward and then of
course<00:02:15.569> then<00:02:16.110> you<00:02:16.230> want<00:02:16.410> to<00:02:16.470> try<00:02:16.680> and<00:02:16.890> mix<00:02:17.610> in

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 
course then you want to try and mix in

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:19.699 
course then you want to try and mix in
you<00:02:18.090> know<00:02:18.209> something<00:02:18.750> maybe<00:02:18.900> we'll<00:02:19.319> put<00:02:19.530> some

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
you know something maybe we'll put some

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.210 
you know something maybe we'll put some
wind<00:02:19.950> in<00:02:20.190> here<00:02:20.519> let's<00:02:20.819> let's<00:02:21.599> just<00:02:21.830> add<00:02:22.830> a<00:02:22.860> wind

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
wind in here let's let's just add a wind

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.460 
wind in here let's let's just add a wind
object<00:02:26.269> forcefield<00:02:27.269> some<00:02:27.720> wind<00:02:27.989> let's<00:02:28.349> see

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
object forcefield some wind let's see

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:29.930 
object forcefield some wind let's see
which<00:02:28.620> way<00:02:28.800> is<00:02:28.860> it<00:02:28.950> pointing<00:02:29.069> where<00:02:29.610> is<00:02:29.760> it

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
which way is it pointing where is it

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.530 
which way is it pointing where is it
always<00:02:30.750> pointing<00:02:31.290> down<00:02:31.470> let's<00:02:32.540> rotational

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
always pointing down let's rotational

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.800 
always pointing down let's rotational
and<00:02:33.980> global<00:02:34.980> axis<00:02:35.459> so<00:02:35.700> we're<00:02:35.880> rotated<00:02:36.360> on<00:02:36.450> X

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
and global axis so we're rotated on X

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.120 
and global axis so we're rotated on X
like<00:02:37.230> this<00:02:37.519> here<00:02:38.519> and<00:02:39.590> come<00:02:40.590> over<00:02:40.709> here<00:02:40.799> to<00:02:40.950> the

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
like this here and come over here to the

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.259 
like this here and come over here to the
wind<00:02:41.340> and<00:02:41.610> give<00:02:41.700> it<00:02:41.819> a<00:02:41.849> little<00:02:41.970> bit<00:02:42.180> of

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
wind and give it a little bit of

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:44.030 
wind and give it a little bit of
strength<00:02:42.630> let's<00:02:43.380> just<00:02:43.590> see<00:02:43.739> what<00:02:43.920> happens

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
strength let's just see what happens

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.839 
strength let's just see what happens
when<00:02:44.340> we<00:02:44.489> run<00:02:44.519> it<00:02:46.220> now<00:02:47.220> that's<00:02:47.459> not<00:02:47.640> enough

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
when we run it now that's not enough

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:49.339 
when we run it now that's not enough
strength<00:02:48.090> to<00:02:48.180> really<00:02:48.480> tell<00:02:48.690> us<00:02:48.870> if<00:02:48.989> you<00:02:49.049> really

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
strength to really tell us if you really

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:51.350 
strength to really tell us if you really
cranked<00:02:49.680> up<00:02:49.769> all<00:02:50.250> right<00:02:50.459> so<00:02:51.000> they're<00:02:51.209> all

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
cranked up all right so they're all

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.569 
cranked up all right so they're all
working<00:02:51.890> even<00:02:52.890> though<00:02:53.069> they<00:02:53.280> were<00:02:53.340> all<00:02:53.459> in

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:53.579 
working even though they were all in

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:54.890 
working even though they were all in
their<00:02:53.670> own<00:02:53.819> different<00:02:54.239> collision<00:02:54.660> groups

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
their own different collision groups

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.140 
their own different collision groups
okay<00:02:55.440> well<00:02:56.220> let's<00:02:56.400> see<00:02:56.549> they're<00:02:56.730> still<00:02:57.030> not

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
okay well let's see they're still not

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.339 
okay well let's see they're still not
going<00:02:57.299> to<00:02:57.360> collide<00:02:57.630> with<00:02:57.840> each<00:02:57.870> other<00:02:58.140> if<00:02:58.260> I

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
going to collide with each other if I

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:00.289 
going to collide with each other if I
move<00:02:58.530> that<00:02:58.680> over<00:02:58.950> like<00:02:59.130> that<00:02:59.310> it's<00:03:00.090> still<00:03:00.269> not

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
move that over like that it's still not

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:02.150 
move that over like that it's still not
going<00:03:00.540> to<00:03:00.599> collide<00:03:00.959> but<00:03:01.620> yet<00:03:01.829> the<00:03:01.920> wind

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
going to collide but yet the wind

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.039 
going to collide but yet the wind
affects<00:03:02.579> it<00:03:02.760> differently<00:03:03.060> so<00:03:03.569> if<00:03:03.720> you<00:03:03.810> want<00:03:03.989> to

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
affects it differently so if you want to

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:06.259 
affects it differently so if you want to
have<00:03:04.200> a<00:03:04.230> separate<00:03:04.709> wind<00:03:05.010> affecting<00:03:06.000> the

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
have a separate wind affecting the

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.259 
have a separate wind affecting the
different<00:03:07.190> groups<00:03:08.190> you're<00:03:08.489> also<00:03:08.730> gonna<00:03:09.030> have

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
different groups you're also gonna have

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:12.920 
different groups you're also gonna have
to<00:03:09.450> say<00:03:10.049> shift<00:03:10.470> D<00:03:10.860> X<00:03:11.670> I'll<00:03:12.209> make<00:03:12.450> a<00:03:12.480> separate

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
to say shift D X I'll make a separate

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.440 
to say shift D X I'll make a separate
wind<00:03:13.230> object<00:03:13.709> here<00:03:14.100> I'll<00:03:14.579> press<00:03:14.850> you<00:03:15.120> to<00:03:15.299> make

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
wind object here I'll press you to make

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.949 
wind object here I'll press you to make
it<00:03:15.600> its<00:03:15.750> own<00:03:16.280> entity<00:03:17.280> like<00:03:17.700> that<00:03:18.000> and<00:03:18.239> more

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
it its own entity like that and more

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.690 
it its own entity like that and more
importantly<00:03:19.380> I'll<00:03:19.590> press<00:03:19.889> M<00:03:20.160> and<00:03:20.459> move<00:03:20.579> it

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
importantly I'll press M and move it

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.629 
importantly I'll press M and move it
over<00:03:20.970> into<00:03:21.000> layer<00:03:21.389> two<00:03:21.810> okay<00:03:22.709> and<00:03:22.950> then<00:03:23.400> these

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:23.639 
over into layer two okay and then these

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:26.569 
over into layer two okay and then these
guys<00:03:23.970> as<00:03:24.420> well<00:03:25.049> I'm<00:03:25.739> gonna<00:03:25.920> move<00:03:26.160> over<00:03:26.340> and

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
guys as well I'm gonna move over and

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:30.770 
guys as well I'm gonna move over and
delay<00:03:26.850> or<00:03:27.000> two<00:03:27.440> and<00:03:28.440> that<00:03:28.829> one<00:03:29.069> layer<00:03:29.340> two<00:03:29.780> like

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
delay or two and that one layer two like

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.300 
delay or two and that one layer two like
this<00:03:31.019> and<00:03:31.290> the<00:03:31.350> reason<00:03:31.650> I'm<00:03:31.769> doing<00:03:31.799> that<00:03:32.130> is

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
this and the reason I'm doing that is

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:37.550 
this and the reason I'm doing that is
then<00:03:33.650> I'll<00:03:34.650> bring<00:03:35.130> layer<00:03:35.370> two<00:03:35.730> up<00:03:36.350> like<00:03:37.350> this

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
then I'll bring layer two up like this

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.830 
then I'll bring layer two up like this
but<00:03:38.130> then<00:03:38.340> on<00:03:38.609> this<00:03:39.030> object<00:03:39.299> I'm<00:03:39.630> going<00:03:39.660> to

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
but then on this object I'm going to

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:47.090 
but then on this object I'm going to
rotate<00:03:40.019> that<00:03:40.410> on<00:03:40.650> Z<00:03:41.069> and<00:03:42.500> our<00:03:43.670> Z<00:03:45.470> like<00:03:46.470> that<00:03:46.739> now

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
rotate that on Z and our Z like that now

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:52.910 
rotate that on Z and our Z like that now
when<00:03:47.310> I<00:03:47.340> run<00:03:47.579> it<00:03:50.720> you<00:03:51.720> go<00:03:51.900> fullscreen<00:03:52.200> so<00:03:52.829> you

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
when I run it you go fullscreen so you

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:59.520 
when I run it you go fullscreen so you
can<00:03:53.069> see<00:03:53.310> it<00:03:53.400> a<00:03:53.430> little<00:03:53.609> bit<00:03:53.819> better

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.070 

here<00:04:00.100> you<00:04:00.190> can<00:04:00.340> see<00:04:00.610> those<00:04:01.420> are<00:04:01.630> blowing<00:04:01.930> that

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:02.080 
here you can see those are blowing that

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.190 
here you can see those are blowing that
way<00:04:02.319> those<00:04:02.740> are<00:04:02.950> blowing<00:04:03.220> that<00:04:03.400> way<00:04:03.610> all<00:04:04.270> right

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.230 

like<00:04:08.200> that<00:04:08.230> so<00:04:08.800> there's<00:04:09.040> it's<00:04:09.910> kind<00:04:10.120> of<00:04:10.150> a

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:10.240 
like that so there's it's kind of a

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.670 
like that so there's it's kind of a
combination<00:04:10.450> to<00:04:10.780> both<00:04:10.930> you<00:04:11.140> can<00:04:11.290> use<00:04:11.410> layers

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
combination to both you can use layers

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.980 
combination to both you can use layers
and<00:04:12.040> collision<00:04:12.940> groups<00:04:13.150> can<00:04:13.720> make<00:04:13.750> things

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:13.990 
and collision groups can make things

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:15.930 
and collision groups can make things
work<00:04:14.200> together<00:04:14.380> very<00:04:14.740> cool<00:04:15.250> very<00:04:15.520> powerful

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
work together very cool very powerful

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.539 
work together very cool very powerful
and<00:04:16.269> that's<00:04:17.169> it<00:04:17.290> for<00:04:17.440> this<00:04:17.530> lesson<00:04:17.739> I'll<00:04:18.340> see

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
and that's it for this lesson I'll see

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:20.940 
and that's it for this lesson I'll see
you<00:04:18.609> the<00:04:18.669> next<00:04:18.790> time
