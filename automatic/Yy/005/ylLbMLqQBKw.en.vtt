00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:04.509
 Schalke in the white pants from the left Bodo Illgner running open knives 

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:08.430
 only scoring opportunity in the first 20 minutes a shot of today 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:09.569
 outstanding 

00:00:09.569 --> 00:00:12.569
 54 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.980
 that is Reuter 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.409
 Schaper with his head unnecessary 

00:00:23.409 --> 00:00:27.229
 to the corner and that sounds like the first good option for the citizens 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:33.499
 cornerstone 

00:00:33.499 --> 00:00:35.010
 from the hunter 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.949
 Fischer success for her certainly 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:38.500
 responsible for this 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.930
 but with this shot will continue small groups and Nuremberg 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.030
 Conquered worry 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.609
 gradually more and more 

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:48.760
 proportionate midfield means the team is for stronger 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.300
 she obstructs 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.700
 scarce 20,000 spectators 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.140
 were there 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.559
 but at this stage so a bit summer soccer cornerstone 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:03.920
 prevails here 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.920
 Schwabe good at the games tracked about 18 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.730
 it took a long time before the Schalke 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:19.480
 Euro Boston the first time data has ventured with time from now are upset 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.220
 he suggested that 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.220
 missing in the photo 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.960
 I can not believe it 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.960
 even the view should get even more opportunity 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.590
 back Nuremberg initially better touchstone 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.490
 already five years ago 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.810
 Cole Kalou Ballack because in the guest room 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.619
 for the city the indignant here clears to the corner from tonight fascist 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:54.090
 rule 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.600
 50 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.900
 Sheffield is getting stronger and stronger in the last year 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.900
 know in the amateur team 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.550
 both lead to this experience for five years 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.939
 for weekend the ball rolling camera is running 

00:02:08.939 --> 00:02:10.309
 that was the first one really 

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:13.309
 great opportunity for the Schalke 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:17.099
 beautifully played by Marquardt 

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:21.909
 bad for the Turks live the ballot well they are themselves free 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:22.800
 meter high 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.199
 over the gate 

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:26.249
 the nimble 

00:02:26.249 --> 00:02:28.869
 unsafe trained defenders helped 

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:32.149
 he would have John f 

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:34.449
 have this 

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:38.739
 Michael Wollny is running according to FIFA Fourth summer house is her 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:39.860
 recognize him 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.849
 the under Lingen Demann to find the way 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:45.999
 I've already said it was the most outstanding for me today, at least 

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:48.999
 Schalke player 

00:02:53.779 --> 00:02:55.779
 I do not feel like it 

00:02:55.779 --> 00:02:57.119
 firmer on the gas 

00:02:57.119 --> 00:02:59.349
 so far flow clearly 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:02.459
 So maybe we should for this movie 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.459
 Dr the fire handle is fast 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:10.929
 Marquardt in a duel with Reuter 

00:03:10.929 --> 00:03:14.499
 Scherer duel although the linesman lifts the flag 

00:03:14.499 --> 00:03:15.979
 following Marquardt 

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:19.899
 you have it here it must have been a strain in any case 

00:03:19.899 --> 00:03:20.680
 to give up 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.469
 Reuters see through 

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:24.730
 he breaks down 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:25.909
 Pattern on 

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:28.200
 from the field now comes for him 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.399
 on the field that gives free kick 

00:03:30.399 --> 00:03:33.969
 there he is also amateurs Erkenschwick last year 

00:03:38.399 --> 00:03:41.179
 the man from the DFA 

00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:45.169
 Thon, by the way, is being razor-sharp covered by Hans-Jürgen Brunner 

00:03:48.619 --> 00:03:50.829
 the devices were 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:53.719
 Semester Pauli won the game as well 

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:57.499
 hefty feathers book shot furnished Uwe Fischer thereupon 

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:04.220
 Assistance sure and rarely radiated peace 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:05.189
 should soon 

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:08.299
 Zero to zero with slight advantages 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:13.569
 Schalke 04 Heidenreich citizens baden-württemberg brought for Wagner 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:14.999
 and here 

00:04:14.999 --> 00:04:17.999
 Hölscher Chang from Andersen 

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:21.619
 Shelley Malil only seemed to have clearly dropped the honey 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.780
 Hearns by technical knockout in the 5 a yellow card 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.980
 Company or Drills here 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.980
 Hedwig pastures grazing this doubt 

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:37.759
 similar he wanted to be spared 

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:40.550
 or recovered again 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.550
 could with full powers 

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:46.789
 they were hot ones 

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:50.360
 Duels at the beginning of the second half the game threatens a bit 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.330
 to have out and then found the Nuremberg trials again 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.600
 to their game that is a lot of money for a nice solo 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.569
 1 0 victory against Stosur 

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:01.089
 and maybe five inches 

00:05:01.089 --> 00:05:03.219
 as the ball passes the gate 

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:04.610
 and continue the Nuremberg 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:08.630
 Now consider a few beautiful spacious others Bach Haydn rich in 

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:11.629
 new state budget 

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:22.400
 and then again a Leonberg attack almost a copy of the first 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.680
 Swabian 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.939
 turn right onto a rich one 

00:05:25.939 --> 00:05:28.689
 that's not enough 

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:31.689
 again hurt a nice flank on the head 

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:35.949
 but there was pressure from 11 Toni Schumacher Storm 

00:05:36.559 --> 00:05:39.859
 By the way, Andersen was taken out of the game probably because of that 

00:05:39.859 --> 00:05:42.749
 his yellow card is required for this 

00:05:42.749 --> 00:05:44.580
 Investigate Faithfull 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.900
 I think it's a feeling of the past » 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.900
 Christian Fuchs in Klagenfurt with 0 7 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:55.360
 suddenly they put pressure on the time was also about a good hour 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.270
 played before now 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:59.020
 Scheike 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.530
 Ever stronger and Nuremberg seemed to be satisfied with one point now too 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:02.950
 give 

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:05.950
 she is especially for children 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:10.259
 Rita Mosel us against Bayern Munich, he has little success 

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:13.080
 and is now happy for this proposal 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.080
 though trimmed on it 

00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:24.220
 Nuremberg barely out of their own half and about this man over 

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:27.159
 Wollitz held the most confidence 

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:30.159
 nevertheless there are his third possibility 

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:38.669
 the parents 

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:43.030
 Only sure players cancel the shows we had opportunities 

00:06:43.029 --> 00:06:44.200
 are with the 11th 

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:45.599
 Police station under the 

00:06:45.599 --> 00:06:48.210
 Applause from the audience brought 

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:49.309
 Wollitz 

00:06:49.309 --> 00:06:52.490
 the AdWords 16 feet to the post 

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:55.490
 and reading 

00:06:56.659 --> 00:07:00.110
 the goal of the Nuremberg goal would have to shoot 

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:02.319
 claus-dieter Wollitz 

00:07:02.319 --> 00:07:05.699
 the imprint of the Nürnberger can be seen on such ricochets 

00:07:05.699 --> 00:07:08.819
 Wolfsburg is not stable at this stage, not her here 

00:07:15.639 --> 00:07:18.219
 Semi-precious 4 11 

00:07:18.219 --> 00:07:19.889
 and Kurt Beretta 

00:07:19.889 --> 00:07:23.319
 gets hurt 

00:07:23.319 --> 00:07:25.210
 in this duel 

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:28.210
 with Michael Wollitz they slipped into each other 

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:30.009
 but after 

00:07:30.009 --> 00:07:33.389
 short treatment he was able to play again the rest remains 

00:07:33.389 --> 00:07:38.370
 In the end, Zero to Zero, despite some other shooter odds 

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:39.270
 Schalke 

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:42.580
 too few litter blurred Vettel to stay at the airport
