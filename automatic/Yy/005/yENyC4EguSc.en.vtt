00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:11.900
 flashing 

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:14.670
 tablet samsung tab 3 model cmt 211 and 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:17.279
 what we need for this first 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.240
 download drivers for connection 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:25.619

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:28.949
 typing 2 drivers samsung tab 3 means 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.820
 sipping links go to the official 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:36.090
 site 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:38.100
 samsung is stupid and download this 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.260
 this link download driver weighs it 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:45.649
 will give 5 both 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:45.649
 our downloaded and installed the next step 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:54.570
 turn them off plate 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:58.760
 we start as follows 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.760
 home button we clamp 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:11.500
 we clamp the volume swings here it is with us 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:15.820
 it turns out to decrease the volume minus 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:24.340
 and the power button sequentially 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:27.510
 Press the home button swing minus and 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:33.369
 power off button 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:35.050
 means the screen is displayed on which 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:40.750
 there will be a warning icon 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:45.660
 exclamation mark follow him 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.660
 highlighted press the button + volume 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:52.290
 confirm our intentions means 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:02.340
 must be previously downloaded 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.340
 firmware downloaded us this firmware 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:16.910
 I installed exactly m. one 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:21.380
 the tablet started to fail 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:28.209
 naturally downloaded this firmware 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:28.209
 installed and1 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:40.980
 the tablet is already working well with it 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:45.340
 means for the firmware we connect the tablet to 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:49.810
 computer via usb cable and run 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:56.730
 program 13 version 13 you can download it 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:03:01.510
 On the Internet, the principle is everywhere there is 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:03.569
 you know the most important thing to tick 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:08.260
 stood here and tick stood here 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:12.909
 there should be nothing on by default 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:15.329
 what such do mean next 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:15.329
 by step 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.230
 we make 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:27.760
 then load the firmware 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:29.960
 and here we are 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.890
 well, well, well 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.890
 open up 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.070
 that is, it is loaded 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:46.110
 and accordingly I will not be talking about 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:49.980
 woo I flashed respectively 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:53.390
 here the firmware path appears here 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.390
 itself automatically put 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:02.670
 check mark then activate the horse 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:05.670
 start click on start now 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.670
 plunged 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:12.970
 Click on rates and repaint 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:15.370
 about five minutes takes this time 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:19.549
 after which the tablet itself slept 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:21.729
 reboots and is already normal 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:25.389
 in operating mode 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:25.389
