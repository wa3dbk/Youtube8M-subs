00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.559
 digital cameras differ from analog genk instead of exposing 

00:00:04.559 --> 00:00:08.340
 on photographic film they do on an image sensor 

00:00:08.869 --> 00:00:13.039
 there are compact cameras and digital SLR cameras that have a sensor 

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:14.290
 larger 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:18.190
 which entails greater focal lengths and with it greater control 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:20.349
 about depth of field 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:24.249
 The larger sensor size also has an effect on higher image quality 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.640
 and a greater sensitivity reducing the noise level its use is normally 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.690
 more complex than that of compact cameras but with more level of control 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.460
 by the user 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.190
 tend to have much higher prices due to these characteristics 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.260
 general of the object 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.230
 the mega pixel indicates the size of the photo that a digital camera is capable of 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.110
 create the greater the number of megapixels the higher the resolution of 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.110
 the created photograph 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.950
 so it is advisable to have a camera with at least three points 0 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:59.130
 megapixels 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:03.930
 in this way it is possible to take pictures with excellent clarity 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.920
 in prints for example cameras with more than 6 megapixels are indicated 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.920
 for those who need more professional resources 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.520
 It is very common for people who use digital teaching cameras to know the 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.650
 basics of photography 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:25.570
 Nations such as framing approach exposure and lighting are not 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.630
 taken into account when photographing the user trusts that the 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.750
 camera will do everything camente tomatoes but the reality is that to get good 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:40.010
 photos with any type of camera you have to have certain basic notions juv 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.600
 digital cameras have a chip in charge of capturing the image 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.950
 this team is called efe efe d 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.680
 the smaller the chip - light captures the camera therefore 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.970
 will be prone to take dark photos 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.640
 regulating the shutter speed you will find one of the keys to 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.370
 cheat the automatisms of the cameras 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:03.400
 for example 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.680
 if you are in a poorly lit environment you can not bonus you want your atlas you can 

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.960
 reduce the shutter speed because it is the same as increasing the 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.140
 exposure this will allow the camera to capture more ambient light 

00:02:16.919 --> 00:02:20.779
 it is essential to maintain the real estate camera that the image 

00:02:20.779 --> 00:02:22.109
 will leave montilla 

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:28.139
 supports the camera something fixed like a table a piece of furniture obviously a tripod the 

00:02:28.139 --> 00:02:31.319
 Exposure control allows control of the sensation of movement 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:37.609
 There are two types of June the objective and the digital is preferable the first 

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:41.359
 the forecast made is finally nation of the image through the entity 

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:46.340
 the digital kun in turn expands the part of the original image chosen 

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:49.339
 causing the quality of the image to be lost 

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:54.449
 the good use of the flash allows to take good photographs in little environments 

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:55.609
 illuminated 

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:59.629
 the flash is very important so that the images generated in environment with 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:00.780
 light deficiency 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.369
 in the quality wheel 

00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:06.369
 you have to remember that most of the flashes have a range of less than 

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:08.039
 three meters 

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:12.539
 choose models that allow you to make presets in the classic for example 

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:16.209
 there are cameras that optimize the intensity of the flash to avoid the effect of eyes 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:21.499
 reds in the images others allow the light emitted nature more time 

00:03:21.499 --> 00:03:24.739
 useful feature in exact sequences photos 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:30.279
 2 six cameras that work with rechargeable batteries and others that do it with 

00:03:30.279 --> 00:03:32.089
 subjects 

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:36.339
 in terms of storage the cameras come with five very little memory 

00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:40.389
 included so you always have to consider buying a memory card 

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:42.589
 compatible with the camera 

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:47.429
 Another great advantage of digital cameras is the possibility of using a 

00:03:47.429 --> 00:03:48.900
 lgd screen 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.670
 To take out and view the pictures, make sure the camera has the 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.439
 option to disconnect that screen useful resource when you do not have much 

00:03:57.439 --> 00:03:58.090
