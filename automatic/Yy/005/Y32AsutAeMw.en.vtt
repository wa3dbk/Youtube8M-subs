00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.270
 space 5 sports friends we are here with 

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.430
 everton rename chile player 

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:14.440
 carmagnola everton today a match 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:16.150
 suffered a bad first half closed 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.770
 on 3 0 for opponents then one 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:20.080
 great comeback to your decisive goal 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:22.690
 a goal from ex that is worth three points 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:25.449
 we knew it would be a game 

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:26.910
 hard we did n't know they have one 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:31.000
 great team 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:33.070
 we expected theirs to be the first 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.240
 time was a bit more closed then quality 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:39.250
 restart 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:40.900
 they have been good at I don't know if they want 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.330
 take advantage of going ahead though not 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.820
 since we were good at maintaining the 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:47.170
 calm and 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.820
 be able to direct the game that e 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:54.880
 then in the end I looked at myself rigorously 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.860
 we wanted to help the team a little and 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.730
 thankfully I saw you do that 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.250
 given the three points 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.900
 however, we were very good at 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.270
 don't lose your head and this means 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.430
 and series even though it is a young team 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:08.290
 if it is ripe 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.600
 being able to bring to the state that it is more 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.040
 important how much I wanted to do well 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.730
 this match against your former dl 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.790
 castellamonte 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:18.430
 but I want to do all the good things 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:21.229
 leave no this here 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.440
 I wanted to do well because it's a derby 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:26.510
 we were at home there was a good audience e 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.070
 it is not because I do not ex team 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.960
 see nothing to anyone 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.670
 I'm very happy to have played 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.530
 against my former team and we did 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.000
 I think it's a good show for those 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.030
 came and most important I love outputs 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.410
 those three points 6 games if you win 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.940
 still unbeaten chile of carmagnola 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.080
 we have already said this several times 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.570
 team really wants to arrive 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.810
 get to the top of the end rankings 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:51.560
 year as I said before 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:54.229
 today in my opinion the first head for 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.289
 really see where we can go 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:58.820
 that is, we have three very difficult games 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:00.040
 and in my opinion we are a right path 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.479
 why 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:05.540
 and even if a group is not in the city 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:07.369
 immediately to be competitive too 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.630
 very difficult matches we managed to 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:10.610
 bring the three points not because this 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.280
 There was also a draw though 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.800
 already or between games we won 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.970
 missing a few seconds and if like these 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.480
 points can eventually make the 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.250
 difference 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.670
 but we keep our feet on the ground 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.680
 always with humility and now 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.420
 expect this game then from there 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.730
 we can really see if we can 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.930
 fight for the title 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.390
 roberto bruno, director of the 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.040
 castellamonte today one then two faces 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.019
 a great first half closed in 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.040
 advantage for 3 networks to 0 against the 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:38.360
 leaders 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.549
 then in the second half you suffered the 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:44.450
 comeback of this happened 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:45.980
 according to you well first of all congratulations 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.950
 to the team not for the first time but 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.450
 throughout the game it is clear 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.420
 that on the eve of the match it came 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.980
 here without two owners or people who 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.830
 however the basic quintet is like 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:00.830
 these bolelli was already a reason for 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:03.080
 anxiety for us as a management of 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.450
 the boys are in the first half 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.130
 went beyond all expectations and have 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.810
 made a game of 10 and praise 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.310
 there's nothing anyone wrong with nothing 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.140
 in fact 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.299
 and to speak of life even in the second half 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.519
 albeit under pressure our 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:18.049
 opportunities we have had but the 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:20.329
 problem of not having the management of 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:22.070
 change of having to bear the rhythm 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:25.440
 imposed by the country to which I do 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:27.980
 congratulations for a great team 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.030
 made the difference substantially 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.650
 however of the last games we have seen 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.090
 a growing castle we remember 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.830
 that you are the first series experience b 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.030
 a new team is not the new actor 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.190
 even if for monet a return to 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.360
 castellamonte as much as the teams 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.800
 and we say credited for the victory 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.540
 final have thirst played up 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.160
 at the last with the half lost 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.910
 second from the end with carmagnola for itself 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.270
 minute from the end 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:50.880
 how much burns we cannot say not 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:52.830
 burns absolutely it is obvious that one 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.720
 team with our expectations 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:56.580
 we had brought home some points 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:00.210
 we would have gone on a little more 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:01.530
 do not worry now let's say that 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:03.330
 Expectations are not the other results 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.860
 however before this match it is not 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:07.920
 vain 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:11.070
 were not evil certainly get that 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.930
 Campagnola with some point would have us 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:15.330
 made a more peaceful break but that 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.430
 but the team is competitive 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.810
 among other things, today the decisive goal of the 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.190
 game then came a minute 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.950
 from the end one of your ex did it 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.900
 everton player wigan of but on 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.610
 rainaldi player i can't argue 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.640
 because last year it proved to be a 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.440
 great player even if this goal I have to 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:34.680
 say that more than he didn't want a ride 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.360
 it was a good dose of luck 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.550
 obviously I don't speak about the person 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.620
 she naldi that to castellamonte has 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:43.380
 ate for a year and did not bring 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.940
 compared to the people who have that 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.970
 they made it grow to get to these 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.970
 levels
