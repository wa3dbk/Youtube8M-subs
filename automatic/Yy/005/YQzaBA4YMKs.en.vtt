00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
you can see underneath there's a little

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.929 
you can see underneath there's a little
latch<00:02:03.119> and<00:02:03.450> that<00:02:04.020> latch<00:02:04.229> will<00:02:04.759> release<00:02:05.759> the

missiles on the side down HD fire
probably<00:02:12.720> the<00:02:12.840> only<00:02:12.989> disappointing

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
probably the only disappointing

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.410 
probably the only disappointing
of<00:02:13.890> the<00:02:14.010> vehicle<00:02:14.310> and<00:02:14.820> that<00:02:15.030> is<00:02:15.150> that<00:02:15.300> they

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
of the vehicle and that is that they

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.360 
of the vehicle and that is that they
just<00:02:15.600> clip<00:02:15.870> on<00:02:16.050> so<00:02:16.200> you<00:02:16.290> can<00:02:16.410> see<00:02:16.560> there<00:02:16.770> and

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
just clip on so you can see there and

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.950 
just clip on so you can see there and
this<00:02:17.460> has<00:02:17.640> a<00:02:17.670> little<00:02:17.850> clip<00:02:18.060> and<00:02:18.330> it<00:02:18.780> just

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
this has a little clip and it just

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.230 
this has a little clip and it just
slides<00:02:19.260> into<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:19.680> position<00:02:20.100> but<00:02:20.910> all<00:02:21.030> in<00:02:21.150> all

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
slides into the position but all in all

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.180 
slides into the position but all in all
it's<00:02:21.540> a<00:02:21.780> great<00:02:22.200> vehicle<00:02:22.440> and<00:02:22.830> I<00:02:22.920> think<00:02:23.100> if

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
it's a great vehicle and I think if

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.460 
it's a great vehicle and I think if
you're<00:02:23.310> looking<00:02:23.340> for<00:02:23.790> a<00:02:23.850> use<00:02:24.450> of<00:02:24.630> a<00:02:24.720> to<00:02:25.320> use

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
you're looking for a use of a to use

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.880 
you're looking for a use of a to use
your<00:02:25.620> CAD<00:02:25.800> Bane<00:02:26.040> figure<00:02:27.440> like<00:02:28.440> I<00:02:28.560> know<00:02:28.710> there's

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
your CAD Bane figure like I know there's

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.240 
your CAD Bane figure like I know there's
a<00:02:28.950> CAD<00:02:29.460> Bane<00:02:29.700> figure<00:02:30.170> vehicle<00:02:31.170> coming<00:02:31.860> out<00:02:32.100> one

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
a CAD Bane figure vehicle coming out one

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.610 
a CAD Bane figure vehicle coming out one
of<00:02:32.280> the<00:02:32.430> pirate<00:02:32.820> bikes<00:02:33.170> but<00:02:34.170> I<00:02:34.260> really<00:02:34.470> think

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
of the pirate bikes but I really think

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.490 
of the pirate bikes but I really think
he's<00:02:35.160> more<00:02:35.310> suited<00:02:35.610> to<00:02:35.640> the<00:02:35.730> skip<00:02:36.000> so<00:02:36.500> anyway

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
he's more suited to the skip so anyway

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.650 
he's more suited to the skip so anyway
