00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:14.599
 Hello, today's release reviews 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:17.650
 the beach we are on kata kata beach 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:19.150
 is between nai harn this ron 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.720
 and this is such a quiet place 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:25.869
 but popular face wash and maternity 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:28.480
 a cafe on the coast of a woman on the beach 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:31.650
 but we'll go straight to the beach there everything 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.650
 look at capacity 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:43.110
 Kata beach is quite densely populated on 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:45.820
 side probably in Karon Patong 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.230
 by the way you are behind me islet 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.850
 it is in my opinion artificiality 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.470
 artificially built island which 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:55.390
 called that translated from Thai crab 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.490
 you can swim there too 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.680
 in my opinion there is a restaurant, and there can be Pablo 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:03.370
 Garay As for entertainment on the beach 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:05.199
 kata are available here i don't know these things 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.520
 calls when the powder flies 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:10.750
 honestly also kayaking swim 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.360
 snorkeling eat is also available because 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:16.810
 what grief have corals this beach is pretty 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.670
 still quiet and therefore welcome 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.150
 rest with children . a lot of families 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.619
 children resting with young 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.140
 there are practically no waves here right now 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:28.300
 at least a season in the off season helped 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.770
 little there are waves in principle here 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:35.140
 pretty calm and so measured 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.950
 next is all sorts of entertainment 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.289
 there 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.630
 kitesurfing school radio and spa 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:42.880
 the only thing here is well, let's say as on 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.719
 the crown on the sweat children filmed clubs then 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.429
 there is more quietly obtained and therefore 

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:50.619
 apparently for this reason with the children here and 

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:52.780
 comfortable to relax yourself beaches pretty 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:56.740
 big long way around 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.240
 there are beautiful rocks here 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.729
 just 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:03.729
 hotels are calmer 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:07.719
 than sunflower or haron if you like 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:10.360
 some such lively places then 

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:12.640
 there are these people tourists that is 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.370
 civilization is basically from this 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.230
 probably a great option but that 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.239
 case if you can not stand and 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.290
 all kinds of parties there clubs 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.290
 noise and everything 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:39.750
 here also under water so comfortable and 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:42.930
 gently sloping sandy sand 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:46.350
 blue water principle great beach 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.850
 for such a family holiday beach 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.790
 merchants leave and let's say 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.920
 sell some food offered by kremikom 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.560
 Namaz from the table and yes to him coral 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:00.730
 leather sells like some clothes 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:02.200
 maybe there is also a lot 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.150
 the number of sun beds that is, if you 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:09.570
 love beach vacation you can harass 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.570
 tired battle lounger and country 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.280
 also a great option let's say 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.950
 meet sunset on this beach because 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:04.600
 the sun sets right in the middle of the beach 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:06.490
 it is visible as from normal hours 6 occurs 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.810
 that is, you can take something tasty 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:10.780
 let's say there fruit 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:13.200
 sit down somewhere on the sand and meet 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.200
 sunset 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.000
 so if you see kids i think 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.670
 piece then this is a great option for 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.360
 family vacation quite calm 

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:34.870
 quite quiet but there is everything you need 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.360
 resting for man 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.460
 That's basically all I hope for 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.430
