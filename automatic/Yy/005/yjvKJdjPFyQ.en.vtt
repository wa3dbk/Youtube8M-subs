00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:12.330
 wait there must be another way 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:15.570
 no need to die bastard me 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.730
 you screwed the kill kill recruit me 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.980
 they are your superior and the most 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.080
 strong of the order of the assassins e 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.660
 I can do what I want 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.359
 altair stop being an asshole with mine 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.220
 brother is not true that you can do this 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.619
 What do you want 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.520
 none of us can do what he wants 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.440
 not even the muallim 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.550
 the head of the order can do what 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.070
 wants 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.950
 did you know or should I remind you of i 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.739
 our three basic malick principles 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.590
 he was just an old man, don't get pissed off 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.950
 so much that old man was innocent 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.800
 our first principle says hold on 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.199
 the blade from the flesh of the innocent but 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.180
 it looks like you don't know mine 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.550
 principle says instead that it is not 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.879
 fundamental and now don't use 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.510
 contradict me more or I'll cut your tongue 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:07.799

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.830

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.590

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.430

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.729

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:23.700
 the treasure of the temple our goal 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:27.689
 is to recover it as soon as possible and now 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:30.119

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:36.630
 killing him is not necessary for me to do it 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:39.890
