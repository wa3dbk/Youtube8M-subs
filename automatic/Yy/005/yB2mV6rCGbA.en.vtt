00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
kind of disappointed me because it

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.069 
kind of disappointed me because it
wasn't<00:00:56.670> as<00:00:56.789> loud<00:00:57.059> as<00:00:57.270> I<00:00:57.390> thought<00:00:57.629> it<00:00:57.780> would<00:00:57.899> be

will<00:01:40.890> feel<00:01:41.100> good<00:01:41.369> but<00:01:41.640> I<00:01:41.670> guess<00:01:41.759> it's<00:01:42.119> just<00:01:42.180> me

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
will feel good but I guess it's just me

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.840 
will feel good but I guess it's just me
because<00:01:42.750> this<00:01:43.409> happens<00:01:43.829> on<00:01:43.950> all<00:01:44.159> my<00:01:44.369> earphones

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
because this happens on all my earphones

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.700 
because this happens on all my earphones
like<00:01:44.970> my<00:01:45.329> ears<00:01:45.600> just<00:01:45.720> get<00:01:45.990> irritated<00:01:46.470> from

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
like my ears just get irritated from

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.310 
like my ears just get irritated from
having<00:01:47.009> it<00:01:47.130> off<00:01:47.340> for<00:01:47.610> so<00:01:47.790> long<00:01:48.030> so<00:01:48.869> I<00:01:48.899> guess

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
having it off for so long so I guess

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.620 
having it off for so long so I guess
after<00:01:49.560> like<00:01:50.009> about<00:01:50.310> an<00:01:50.430> hour<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:51.060> of<00:01:51.180> use<00:01:51.420> it

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
after like about an hour to of use it

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.719 
after like about an hour to of use it
just<00:01:51.840> gets<00:01:52.020> annoying<00:01:52.409> to<00:01:52.619> have<00:01:52.770> it<00:01:52.920> on<00:01:53.159> because

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
just gets annoying to have it on because

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.480 
just gets annoying to have it on because
it's<00:01:54.060> not<00:01:54.240> over<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.140> ear<00:01:55.350> it's<00:01:55.560> on<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:56.100> ear<00:01:56.310> so

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
it's not over the ear it's on the ear so

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.639 
it's not over the ear it's on the ear so
it's<00:01:56.670> like<00:01:56.850> this<00:01:57.090> it's<00:01:57.689> not<00:01:57.869> around<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.469> ear

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
it's like this it's not around the ear

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.770 
it's like this it's not around the ear
like<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:58.979> studio's<00:01:59.369> are<00:01:59.640> it's<00:01:59.909> like<00:02:00.119> on<00:02:00.390> your

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
like the studio's are it's like on your

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.359 
like the studio's are it's like on your
ear<00:02:00.930> which<00:02:01.110> is<00:02:01.259> I<00:02:01.439> don't<00:02:01.710> really<00:02:01.890> like<00:02:02.070> that<00:02:02.100> at

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
ear which is I don't really like that at

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.120 
ear which is I don't really like that at
all<00:02:02.460> because<00:02:02.670> sometimes<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:04.229> it<00:02:04.560> won't<00:02:04.799> be<00:02:04.920> on

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
all because sometimes the it won't be on

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.219 
all because sometimes the it won't be on
like<00:02:05.369> all<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.820> way<00:02:05.969> on<00:02:06.240> normal<00:02:06.750> like<00:02:06.869> it'll<00:02:07.200> be

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
like all the way on normal like it'll be

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.559 
like all the way on normal like it'll be
blocking<00:02:07.649> your<00:02:08.039> ear<00:02:08.220> hole<00:02:08.429> so<00:02:08.789> you<00:02:09.000> won't<00:02:09.509> be

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
blocking your ear hole so you won't be

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.150 
blocking your ear hole so you won't be
able<00:02:09.660> to<00:02:09.810> hear<00:02:10.020> just<00:02:10.200> some<00:02:10.440> crazy<00:02:10.709> things<00:02:10.979> I

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
able to hear just some crazy things I

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.580 
able to hear just some crazy things I
don't

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
don't

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.410 
don't
on<00:02:11.709> the<00:02:11.980> ear<00:02:12.130> headphone<00:02:12.640> so<00:02:12.849> that's<00:02:13.060> another

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
on the ear headphone so that's another

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.110 
on the ear headphone so that's another
downfall<00:02:14.020> with<00:02:14.260> these<00:02:14.500> I<00:02:14.830> like<00:02:15.310> it<00:02:15.459> to<00:02:15.580> be<00:02:15.610> over

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
downfall with these I like it to be over

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.570 
downfall with these I like it to be over
the<00:02:16.239> ear<00:02:16.480> like<00:02:17.110> on<00:02:17.319> the<00:02:17.530> B<00:02:17.680> Studios<00:02:18.190> which<00:02:18.400> will

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
the ear like on the B Studios which will

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.479 
the ear like on the B Studios which will
be<00:02:18.700> in<00:02:18.819> my<00:02:18.940> next<00:02:19.270> review<00:02:19.450> so<00:02:20.440> that's<00:02:21.250> another

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
be in my next review so that's another

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:23.160 
be in my next review so that's another
deaf<00:02:21.730> I<00:02:21.880> don't<00:02:22.209> like<00:02:22.360> that<00:02:22.510> it's<00:02:22.690> on<00:02:22.870> the<00:02:23.020> ear

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
deaf I don't like that it's on the ear

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.990 
deaf I don't like that it's on the ear
some<00:02:23.500> people<00:02:23.739> might<00:02:23.950> actually<00:02:24.160> like<00:02:24.580> that<00:02:24.790> but

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
some people might actually like that but

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.460 
some people might actually like that but
I<00:02:25.030> do<00:02:25.150> not<00:02:25.450> like<00:02:25.690> that<00:02:25.900> at<00:02:26.020> all

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
I do not like that at all

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.589 
I do not like that at all
now<00:02:26.890> the<00:02:26.950> design<00:02:27.370> yet<00:02:27.730> looks<00:02:28.030> great<00:02:28.360> this

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:28.599 
now the design yet looks great this

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:30.390 
now the design yet looks great this
thing<00:02:28.870> is<00:02:29.080> a<00:02:29.290> beats<00:02:29.590> product<00:02:29.980> all<00:02:30.160> beats

see<00:02:32.860> someone<00:02:33.160> with<00:02:33.280> beats<00:02:33.519> on<00:02:33.790> you<00:02:34.090> just<00:02:34.840> like

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
see someone with beats on you just like

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:36.449 
see someone with beats on you just like
it's<00:02:35.290> not<00:02:35.410> like<00:02:35.560> you<00:02:35.680> gotta<00:02:35.830> say<00:02:35.980> either<00:02:36.160> those

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459

it's not like you gotta say either those
are<00:02:36.610> ugly<00:02:36.730> because<00:02:37.180> their<00:02:37.810> beats<00:02:38.080> all<00:02:38.349> beats

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
are ugly because their beats all beats

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.040 
are ugly because their beats all beats
look<00:02:38.920> good<00:02:39.130> and<00:02:39.459> that's<00:02:39.790> just<00:02:40.060> my<00:02:40.150> opinion<00:02:40.330> so

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
look good and that's just my opinion so

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.420 
look good and that's just my opinion so
these<00:02:41.140> things<00:02:41.319> do<00:02:41.560> look<00:02:41.590> good<00:02:41.890> as<00:02:42.040> you<00:02:42.130> can<00:02:42.250> see

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
these things do look good as you can see

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.520 
these things do look good as you can see
they're<00:02:42.610> back<00:02:43.030> there<00:02:43.360> they're<00:02:43.900> blue<00:02:44.200> my

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530

they're back there they're blue my
favorite<00:02:44.920> colors<00:02:45.310> so<00:02:45.549> I<00:02:45.850> like<00:02:46.239> the<00:02:46.390> way<00:02:46.420> that

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
favorite colors so I like the way that

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.770 
favorite colors so I like the way that
they<00:02:46.720> look<00:02:46.959> but<00:02:47.680> they're<00:02:48.610> small<00:02:48.940> like<00:02:49.569> if<00:02:49.690> I

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
they look but they're small like if I

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.530 
they look but they're small like if I
get<00:02:49.989> them<00:02:50.170> right<00:02:50.350> now<00:02:50.530> and<00:02:50.709> I<00:02:50.799> put<00:02:51.040> them<00:02:51.160> on

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
get them right now and I put them on

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.930 
get them right now and I put them on
without<00:02:52.769> extending<00:02:53.769> it<00:02:53.980> August<00:02:54.280> just<00:02:54.730> because

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
without extending it August just because

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.820 
without extending it August just because
I<00:02:54.970> have<00:02:55.150> a<00:02:55.180> big<00:02:55.450> head<00:02:55.630> that<00:02:56.530> is<00:02:56.680> how<00:02:56.799> it<00:02:56.950> looks

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
I have a big head that is how it looks

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.190 
I have a big head that is how it looks
yeah<00:02:59.830> as<00:02:59.950> you<00:03:00.069> can<00:03:00.220> see<00:03:00.400> it's<00:03:01.330> not<00:03:01.510> that<00:03:01.660> good<00:03:01.840> I

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
yeah as you can see it's not that good I

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.009 
yeah as you can see it's not that good I
would<00:03:02.799> have<00:03:02.830> to<00:03:03.190> extend<00:03:04.090> it<00:03:04.360> all<00:03:04.510> the<00:03:04.569> way<00:03:04.959> out

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:11.940 

put<00:03:08.019> it<00:03:08.110> on<00:03:08.260> and<00:03:09.220> then<00:03:09.519> go<00:03:10.239> back<00:03:10.480> and<00:03:10.750> take<00:03:11.650> away

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
put it on and then go back and take away

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.190 
put it on and then go back and take away
from<00:03:12.489> what<00:03:12.640> I<00:03:12.670> have<00:03:12.970> and<00:03:13.299> now<00:03:13.599> that<00:03:13.780> I<00:03:13.810> just<00:03:14.019> put

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
from what I have and now that I just put

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.750 
from what I have and now that I just put
these<00:03:14.319> things<00:03:14.500> on<00:03:14.769> I<00:03:15.160> thought<00:03:15.400> about<00:03:15.549> the

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
these things on I thought about the

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.640 
these things on I thought about the
noise<00:03:15.970> cancellation<00:03:16.540> I'm<00:03:16.959> not<00:03:17.140> sure<00:03:17.350> if<00:03:17.470> these

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
noise cancellation I'm not sure if these

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.729 
noise cancellation I'm not sure if these
has<00:03:18.030> like<00:03:19.030> noise<00:03:19.750> cancellation<00:03:20.380> because<00:03:20.590> when

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
has like noise cancellation because when

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:22.500 
has like noise cancellation because when

really touch that the next track I don't

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:09.510 
really touch that the next track I don't
know<00:05:07.990> it's<00:05:08.169> just<00:05:08.259> laggy<00:05:08.710> like<00:05:09.039> if<00:05:09.189> you<00:05:09.310> press

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 
know it's just laggy like if you press

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.209 
know it's just laggy like if you press
pause<00:05:09.789> it'll<00:05:10.270> take<00:05:10.419> like<00:05:10.569> a<00:05:10.900> whole<00:05:11.770> second

00:05:12.209 --> 00:05:12.219 
pause it'll take like a whole second

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:13.350 
pause it'll take like a whole second
just<00:05:12.370> for<00:05:12.490> it's<00:05:12.639> a<00:05:12.699> positive<00:05:12.879> won't<00:05:13.270> be

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
just for it's a positive won't be

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.999 
just for it's a positive won't be
instant<00:05:13.930> you<00:05:14.289> probably<00:05:14.560> like<00:05:14.650> really<00:05:14.860> a

00:05:14.999 --> 00:05:15.009 
instant you probably like really a

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:17.040 
instant you probably like really a
second<00:05:15.490> Eddy<00:05:15.610> that's<00:05:15.909> nothing<00:05:16.270> like<00:05:16.479> when<00:05:16.930> you

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.050 
second Eddy that's nothing like when you

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:18.510 
second Eddy that's nothing like when you
think<00:05:17.229> about<00:05:17.289> it<00:05:17.620> actually<00:05:17.949> is<00:05:18.099> because<00:05:18.279> you

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:18.520 
think about it actually is because you

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:19.860 
think about it actually is because you
won't<00:05:18.729> even<00:05:18.879> think<00:05:19.029> it's<00:05:19.300> pause<00:05:19.509> like<00:05:19.719> you'll

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:19.870 
won't even think it's pause like you'll

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:21.600 
won't even think it's pause like you'll
press<00:05:20.139> it<00:05:20.379> they'll<00:05:20.830> play<00:05:21.009> for<00:05:21.039> load<00:05:21.370> you'll

dollars<00:06:28.839> no<00:06:29.439> it<00:06:29.979> is<00:06:30.159> not<00:06:30.339> worth<00:06:30.550> the<00:06:30.699> money

00:06:30.899 --> 00:06:30.909 
dollars no it is not worth the money

00:06:30.909 --> 00:06:32.909 
dollars no it is not worth the money
like<00:06:31.360> I<00:06:31.479> said<00:06:31.719> for<00:06:31.930> the<00:06:31.990> comfort<00:06:32.500> I<00:06:32.620> don't<00:06:32.800> like

00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:32.919 
like I said for the comfort I don't like

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:35.279 
like I said for the comfort I don't like
it<00:06:33.069> being<00:06:33.250> on<00:06:33.490> air<00:06:34.000> I<00:06:34.149> like<00:06:34.599> I<00:06:34.779> don't<00:06:34.899> like<00:06:35.229> that

00:06:35.279 --> 00:06:35.289 
it being on air I like I don't like that

00:06:35.289 --> 00:06:37.670 
it being on air I like I don't like that
it's<00:06:35.589> not<00:06:35.740> loud<00:06:36.069> things<00:06:36.880> like<00:06:37.120> that

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:37.680 
it's not loud things like that

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.629 
it's not loud things like that
but<00:06:38.009> the<00:06:38.400> solution<00:06:38.940> to<00:06:39.060> this<00:06:39.180> if<00:06:40.139> this<00:06:40.680> was<00:06:41.340> the

00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:41.639 
but the solution to this if this was the

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:46.040 
but the solution to this if this was the
studious<00:06:42.509> studios<00:06:43.430> Wireless<00:06:44.690> that<00:06:45.690> would<00:06:45.900> be

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:46.050 
studious studios Wireless that would be

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:50.540 
studious studios Wireless that would be
great<00:06:47.090> also<00:06:48.090> that<00:06:48.870> is<00:06:49.080> the<00:06:49.110> thing<00:06:49.500> I<00:06:49.830> had<00:06:50.280> no

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:50.550 
great also that is the thing I had no

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:52.010 
great also that is the thing I had no
idea<00:06:50.820> that<00:06:50.940> that<00:06:51.090> was<00:06:51.150> the<00:06:51.270> thing<00:06:51.330> until<00:06:51.960> I

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:52.020 
idea that that was the thing until I

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:53.510 
idea that that was the thing until I
thought<00:06:52.320> about<00:06:52.560> that<00:06:52.770> idea

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:53.520 
thought about that idea

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:55.760 
thought about that idea
thinking<00:06:54.180> when<00:06:54.810> I<00:06:54.900> had<00:06:55.050> these<00:06:55.229> and<00:06:55.470> I<00:06:55.530> had<00:06:55.680> my

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:55.770 
thinking when I had these and I had my

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:57.560 
thinking when I had these and I had my
studios<00:06:56.220> I<00:06:56.400> wanted<00:06:56.759> to<00:06:56.850> put<00:06:57.030> them<00:06:57.120> together<00:06:57.270> I

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:57.570 
studios I wanted to put them together I

00:06:57.570 --> 00:06:59.779 
studios I wanted to put them together I
had<00:06:57.840> no<00:06:57.990> idea<00:06:58.110> that<00:06:58.350> the<00:06:58.530> studios<00:06:59.310> Wireless

00:06:59.779 --> 00:06:59.789 
had no idea that the studios Wireless

00:06:59.789 --> 00:07:02.870 
had no idea that the studios Wireless
was<00:06:59.970> actually<00:07:00.449> a<00:07:00.479> thing<00:07:00.570> and<00:07:01.229> it<00:07:01.620> is<00:07:01.800> I'm<00:07:02.729> gonna

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:02.880 
was actually a thing and it is I'm gonna

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.670 
was actually a thing and it is I'm gonna
be<00:07:03.000> trying<00:07:03.270> that<00:07:03.360> out<00:07:03.509> soon<00:07:03.840> a<00:07:03.870> bit<00:07:04.229> Studios

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:04.680 
be trying that out soon a bit Studios

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:06.529 
be trying that out soon a bit Studios
Wireless<00:07:05.669> because<00:07:05.820> that's<00:07:06.090> probably<00:07:06.360> the

00:07:06.529 --> 00:07:06.539 
Wireless because that's probably the

00:07:06.539 --> 00:07:08.629 
Wireless because that's probably the
best<00:07:06.840> thing<00:07:07.110> for<00:07:07.139> me<00:07:07.410> wireless<00:07:08.009> capability

00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:08.639 
best thing for me wireless capability

00:07:08.639 --> 00:07:12.680 
best thing for me wireless capability
with<00:07:09.150> the<00:07:09.330> studio<00:07:09.750> studios<00:07:10.349> quality<00:07:11.690> that's

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:12.690 
with the studio studios quality that's

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:14.629 
with the studio studios quality that's
good<00:07:12.960> sir<00:07:13.259> but<00:07:13.500> anyway<00:07:13.979> like<00:07:14.160> I<00:07:14.280> said<00:07:14.310> I<00:07:14.550> don't

00:07:14.629 --> 00:07:14.639 
good sir but anyway like I said I don't

00:07:14.639 --> 00:07:16.909 
good sir but anyway like I said I don't
really<00:07:14.880> recommend<00:07:15.150> it<00:07:15.539> to<00:07:15.630> anyone<00:07:15.900> to<00:07:16.530> buy<00:07:16.710> and

00:07:16.909 --> 00:07:16.919 
really recommend it to anyone to buy and

00:07:16.919 --> 00:07:18.379 
really recommend it to anyone to buy and
unless<00:07:17.130> you<00:07:17.250> just<00:07:17.430> really<00:07:17.729> want<00:07:17.910> the<00:07:18.030> design

00:07:18.379 --> 00:07:18.389 
unless you just really want the design

00:07:18.389 --> 00:07:20.029 
unless you just really want the design
because<00:07:18.900> that's<00:07:19.110> probably<00:07:19.380> the<00:07:19.560> only<00:07:19.710> reason

00:07:20.029 --> 00:07:20.039 
because that's probably the only reason

00:07:20.039 --> 00:07:22.850 
because that's probably the only reason
that<00:07:20.160> you'll<00:07:20.430> buy<00:07:20.639> beats<00:07:21.509> Wireless<00:07:22.289> for<00:07:22.770> the

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:22.860 
that you'll buy beats Wireless for the

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:24.529 
that you'll buy beats Wireless for the
wireless<00:07:23.220> capability<00:07:23.789> and<00:07:23.940> for<00:07:24.120> the<00:07:24.210> design

00:07:24.529 --> 00:07:24.539 
wireless capability and for the design

00:07:24.539 --> 00:07:26.450 
wireless capability and for the design
that's<00:07:24.810> probably<00:07:25.050> the<00:07:25.139> only<00:07:25.199> reason<00:07:25.620> because

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:26.460 
that's probably the only reason because

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:28.879 
that's probably the only reason because
like<00:07:26.970> I<00:07:27.090> said<00:07:27.150> sound<00:07:27.630> quality<00:07:28.110> feel<00:07:28.500> like<00:07:28.650> me

like I said sound quality feel like me

00:07:28.889 --> 00:07:32.480 
like I said sound quality feel like me

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:32.490 
then you really don't care about it

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:36.710
