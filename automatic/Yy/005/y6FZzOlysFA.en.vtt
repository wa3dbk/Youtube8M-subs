00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:27.029
 but I mainly proud of the 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.040
 final that was played proud of 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.110
 belong to this campus to finish 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.880
 worthy of obvious that the team the 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:34.680
 I wanted to win and when when 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.800
 we tied and finished the game I said here 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.300
 is going to be lucky on our side 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:44.010
 but good, unfortunately , could not 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:46.080
 give us two games left a lot 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.699
 importance we are believe that the 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.019
 equipment is being sacrificed much 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:52.440
 is doing a great job happy the 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:54.570
 tournament with little prize in the end I think 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.840
 that this team deserves about five or 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.180
 six points throughout the tournament 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.520
 I think that the team played well but 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.140
 no no no no no no we have not got the 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.380
 final score 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.300
 well we have already faced team of 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.130
 characteristics of dangerous lion we 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:14.100
 we faced the other day with saints 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.899
 also a similar team and of course 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.850
 to have sufficient precautions 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:18.979
 we also have dangerous people 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.360
 up who can do the job well 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:23.750
 we have played against great 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.660
 teams of the same equal doing 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:29.420
 a neat work in defense and at the same time 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:31.520
 trying to always hurt me I think that 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.580
 the team as I said are fast it 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.830
 deserves much more obviously than when 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.300
 one names the word luck one has 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.610
 have to look for luck and the team has 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.780
 searched and luck has not arrived 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.000
 obviously if we continue in this way 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.530
 the results are going to arrive there is no need 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.650
 lower your arms, do not forget 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.930
 without generalizing the arbitration issue I think 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.820
 already the game with Chivas us 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.950
 they invented a criminal the match with cougars 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.479
 here they invented a criminal the other day 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.580
 with pachuca they invented a criminal 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:59.990
 where I think those things are also there 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.880
 have to take them into account obviously that 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.890
 we are the most responsible 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.210
 and we have to do many more things not 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.710
 I want to generalize the arbitration issue 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.470
 because if there are arbiters who have not 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.959
 charged well and they do their job well 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.870
 his work I think we have been 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:16.760
 harmed or I am very difficult already 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.610
 to be able to tell you on purpose or not 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.230
 purpose I believe that my word is but 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.900
 I hope 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.099
 that is as fair as possible I think that 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.450
 When a referee makes a mistake, you have to 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:29.780
 you have to play what was not on purpose 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.340
 but ask him to try to be wrong 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.440
 as little as possible with the greatest 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.720
 exactly we want concentration 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:39.709
 finish up black lions and up 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:41.209
 of chivas so that we can the 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.830
 tournament that comes to start from a better 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.140
 way then these six points are 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.390
 very soon for us and what good 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:50.000
 that circumstance has shown that the 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.159
 team the team wants to leave 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.829
 this situation and we are going to fight until 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:56.150
 the last consequences so that for 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:58.250
 that this does not happen so that the team 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.720
 it is still maintained in first but 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.980
 for that, the 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.410
 commitment has to be maintained 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.180
 commitment from outside to inside of 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.160
 the directive of us as a player the 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.260
 coaching staff all be in the same 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.940
 because I think the best way together 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.769
 with people not that I think people 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.170
 He has also supported us a lot and we are 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:17.780
 plunging into debt with them and that 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:21.129
 all together that is not going to be much more 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.129
 easy to take it out 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.950
 if it leaves us with a bad taste in the mouth 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.810
 shape 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.830
 so close that we were to be champions 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:32.390
 but good everything leaves you a teaching 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.069
 As you say we have two more endings 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:37.220
 to concentrate on what's coming already 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:38.810
 past learn from it nothing more if we 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.940
 two very complicated matches come but 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.680
 that we know about the need we have 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.450
 of your brand that we will not try to do what 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.090
 same at the end are matches and 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.069
 different circumstances lion is a 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.769
 great team can not give us and 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:53.450
 leave so many spaces behind we have to 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:56.910
 be a smart game try 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:58.860
 propose to try not to give him the initiative 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:00.240
 but our way we have to win or 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.160
 we have to add that is extremely 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.320
 important to us and hopefully 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.300
 let's make a game it has cost us a lot 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.190
 work win we have many draws 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:10.770
 many draws that I think we deserved 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:12.450
 more than a point but good here the 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:14.730
 reality is that we have 14 points that 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.670
 we are fighting with chivas veracruz 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.500
 with us let the descent and good is that 

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:21.030
 put your feet on the ground do the 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.090
 things well with much humility with a lot 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.810
 commitment and well let's hope to win the 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.240
 Saturday 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:29.100
 and it is important to get the most 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.670
 amount of points to add this 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.460
 of the descent 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:34.110
 We do not know that the lion has thrown 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.640
 well we know that it is a very rival 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.460
 dangerous and we who can play 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:40.410
 with intelligence and I believe that football 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.360
 that's how I can tell you that in some 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:45.420
 matches then we must have highlighted 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.440
 the biggest points but the reality is 

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.540
 there are the rules there are already 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.580
 face it as if I do not think that first 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:53.070
 you have to think and so lion close 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.570
 close well because get the most 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.310
 number of points as you comment 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.510
 it's because the next tournament is going to be 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:00.630
 the ultimate 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:02.280
 6 the team is focused on taking 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:05.150
 the 3 points 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.150
 to add
