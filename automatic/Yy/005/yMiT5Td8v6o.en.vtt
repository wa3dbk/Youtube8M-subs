00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
both sides and those are the 13s you

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.280 
both sides and those are the 13s you
just<00:01:06.390> take<00:01:06.570> those<00:01:06.780> off<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.320> then<00:01:07.939> fun<00:01:08.939> ones

just take those off and then fun ones
are<00:01:11.900> back<00:01:12.900> up<00:01:13.140> in<00:01:15.020> there<00:01:16.040> at<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.310> top<00:01:17.869> corners

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
are back up in there at the top corners

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.359 
are back up in there at the top corners
and<00:01:19.250> they're<00:01:20.250> slotted<00:01:21.259> sockets<00:01:22.350> I<00:01:22.470> mean<00:01:22.920> bolts

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
and they're slotted sockets I mean bolts

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.520 
and they're slotted sockets I mean bolts
hex<00:01:23.670> head<00:01:23.850> bolts<00:01:24.240> but<00:01:24.720> they've<00:01:24.840> got<00:01:24.990> a<00:01:25.020> slot<00:01:25.290> on

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
hex head bolts but they've got a slot on

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.660 
hex head bolts but they've got a slot on
them<00:01:25.650> so<00:01:25.799> if<00:01:25.920> all<00:01:26.070> you<00:01:26.100> have<00:01:26.340> is<00:01:26.460> a<00:01:26.490> long

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
them so if all you have is a long

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:27.950 
them so if all you have is a long
screwdriver<00:01:27.030> you<00:01:27.330> can<00:01:27.420> get<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.689> them<00:01:27.780> from

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
screwdriver you can get to them from

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.710 
screwdriver you can get to them from
that<00:01:28.140> they<00:01:28.799> are<00:01:28.829> captive<00:01:29.579> if<00:01:30.119> you<00:01:30.329> take<00:01:30.540> those

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
that they are captive if you take those

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.410 
that they are captive if you take those
loose<00:01:31.110> there's<00:01:31.799> one<00:01:32.009> on<00:01:32.130> each<00:01:32.189> side<00:01:32.360> this<00:01:33.360> is

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
loose there's one on each side this is

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.810 
loose there's one on each side this is
the<00:01:33.600> easy<00:01:33.869> side<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.380> see<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:35.070> harder<00:01:35.430> side<00:01:35.670> to

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
the easy side to see the harder side to

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.359 
the easy side to see the harder side to
see<00:01:36.000> is<00:01:36.780> over<00:01:37.049> here<00:01:37.530> because<00:01:37.860> you<00:01:37.979> have<00:01:38.159> air

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
see is over here because you have air

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.399 
see is over here because you have air
conditioning<00:01:38.790> mess<00:01:39.210> in<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.630> way<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:40.590> it's

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
conditioning mess in the way and it's

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:46.520 
conditioning mess in the way and it's
since<00:01:43.409> I<00:01:43.560> can't<00:01:43.950> get<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.340> camera<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:45.380> see<00:01:46.380> it

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
since I can't get the camera to see it

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.429 
since I can't get the camera to see it
you<00:01:47.490> kind<00:01:47.700> of<00:01:47.820> make<00:01:48.000> it<00:01:48.119> out<00:01:48.240> there<00:01:48.990> it<00:01:49.079> is<00:01:49.170> it

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
you kind of make it out there it is it

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.399 
you kind of make it out there it is it
focused<00:01:49.829> so<00:01:50.820> you<00:01:51.420> can<00:01:51.540> get<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.780> it<00:01:51.899> you<00:01:52.200> just

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
focused so you can get to it you just

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.889 
focused so you can get to it you just
might<00:01:52.590> need<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:52.770> socket<00:01:53.130> extension<00:01:53.310> or<00:01:53.880> two<00:01:54.149> you

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
might need a socket extension or two you

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.560 
might need a socket extension or two you
take<00:01:55.110> both<00:01:55.290> of<00:01:55.470> those<00:01:55.560> out<00:01:55.829> and<00:01:56.549> take<00:01:56.850> these<00:01:57.030> 13

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
take both of those out and take these 13

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.980 
take both of those out and take these 13
millimeters<00:01:58.020> out<00:01:58.229> at<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:59.009> bottom<00:01:59.750> and<00:02:00.750> then

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
millimeters out at the bottom and then

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.510 
millimeters out at the bottom and then
the<00:02:01.170> trick<00:02:01.409> is

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
the trick is

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.340 
the trick is
you<00:02:03.119> have<00:02:03.210> to<00:02:03.359> mess<00:02:03.570> with<00:02:03.719> this<00:02:03.869> air

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
you have to mess with this air

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.169 
you have to mess with this air
conditioning<00:02:05.000> ducting<00:02:06.000> it<00:02:06.929> handily<00:02:07.500> feeds

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
conditioning ducting it handily feeds

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:18.830 
conditioning ducting it handily feeds
the<00:02:09.179> rear<00:02:09.420> of<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:10.019> vehicle<00:02:17.480> there's<00:02:18.480> a<00:02:18.540> little

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
the rear of the vehicle there's a little

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:29.300 
the rear of the vehicle there's a little
connection<00:02:19.080> for<00:02:19.379> top<00:02:27.560> and<00:02:28.560> it<00:02:28.680> comes<00:02:28.860> out<00:02:29.069> and

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
connection for top and it comes out and

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:35.020 
connection for top and it comes out and
just<00:02:29.519> slips<00:02:30.060> into<00:02:30.269> this<00:02:30.510> right-hand<00:02:30.900> side

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.850 

entangled<00:02:36.030> that<00:02:36.900> comes<00:02:37.170> out<00:02:37.380> so<00:02:37.680> now<00:02:37.799> the

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
entangled that comes out so now the

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.360 
entangled that comes out so now the
thing<00:02:38.130> is<00:02:38.489> free<00:02:39.390> there's<00:02:40.380> two<00:02:40.890> little<00:02:41.069> poles

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
thing is free there's two little poles

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
conditioner in and out of the way it's a

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.250

I've noticed is the size of this thing

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:15.259 
I've noticed is the size of this thing
this<00:03:13.889> this<00:03:14.250> passenger<00:03:14.700> seat<00:03:15.030> that<00:03:15.150> I'm

this this passenger seat that I'm
sitting<00:03:15.569> in<00:03:15.660> doesn't<00:03:15.989> move<00:03:16.650> back<00:03:16.980> far<00:03:17.310> enough

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:17.569 
sitting in doesn't move back far enough

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:20.990 
sitting in doesn't move back far enough
which<00:03:18.569> is<00:03:18.720> real<00:03:18.930> handy<00:03:19.310> to<00:03:20.310> get<00:03:20.430> this<00:03:20.639> out<00:03:20.850> of

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
which is real handy to get this out of

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.539 
which is real handy to get this out of
there<00:03:21.350> last<00:03:22.350> time<00:03:22.440> I<00:03:22.560> had<00:03:22.739> to<00:03:22.769> actually<00:03:23.040> move

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
there last time I had to actually move

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:26.840 
there last time I had to actually move
this<00:03:23.760> out<00:03:23.970> of<00:03:24.000> there<00:03:24.799> I<00:03:25.799> had<00:03:26.160> to<00:03:26.250> take<00:03:26.400> the<00:03:26.549> seat

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
this out of there I had to take the seat

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.680 
this out of there I had to take the seat
out<00:03:26.880> to<00:03:27.750> provide<00:03:28.049> a<00:03:28.079> room<00:03:28.350> to<00:03:28.530> move<00:03:28.680> this<00:03:28.920> out

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
out to provide a room to move this out

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.120 
out to provide a room to move this out
but<00:03:30.690> most<00:03:31.109> of<00:03:31.230> the<00:03:31.319> time<00:03:31.530> you<00:03:31.739> don't<00:03:31.829> have<00:03:32.010> to

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
but most of the time you don't have to

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:33.470 
but most of the time you don't have to
take<00:03:32.250> the<00:03:32.370> seat<00:03:32.549> out<00:03:32.670> because<00:03:32.940> if<00:03:33.239> you<00:03:33.359> just

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
take the seat out because if you just

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.879 
take the seat out because if you just
slide<00:03:33.690> it<00:03:33.900> back<00:03:34.049> to<00:03:34.200> the<00:03:34.290> edge<00:03:34.410> of<00:03:34.590> the<00:03:34.650> seat

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:34.889
