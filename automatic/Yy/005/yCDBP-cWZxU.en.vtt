00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.180 

seems<00:01:10.910> familiar<00:01:11.570> but<00:01:12.110> its<00:01:12.230> massive<00:01:12.620> enough

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:13.190 
seems familiar but its massive enough

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.530 

now<00:01:26.410> have<00:01:26.620> the<00:01:26.740> plasma<00:01:27.180> get<00:01:28.180> it<00:01:28.270> to<00:01:28.420> the

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:28.540 
now have the plasma get it to the

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.420 
now have the plasma get it to the
invisible<00:01:29.230> so<00:01:29.350> we<00:01:29.440> can<00:01:29.590> get<00:01:29.800> the<00:01:29.920> swords<00:01:30.250> to

invisible so we can get the swords to

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:50.380 
invisible so we can get the swords to
recycle

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390
