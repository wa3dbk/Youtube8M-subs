you know got up this morning I thought

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.050 
you know got up this morning I thought
it<00:03:55.920> was<00:03:56.010> gonna<00:03:56.100> be<00:03:56.190> a<00:03:56.310> pretty<00:03:56.490> good<00:03:56.670> morning<00:03:56.819> to

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
it was gonna be a pretty good morning to

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.150 
it was gonna be a pretty good morning to
hunting<00:03:57.390> because<00:03:57.750> the<00:03:58.050> weather<00:03:58.319> changed<00:03:59.100> a

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
hunting because the weather changed a

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.520 
hunting because the weather changed a
little<00:03:59.280> bit<00:03:59.459> overnight<00:03:59.880> when<00:04:00.390> God<00:04:00.720> came<00:04:01.350> in

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
little bit overnight when God came in

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:02.990 
little bit overnight when God came in
from<00:04:01.709> the<00:04:01.770> north<00:04:02.010> instead<00:04:02.220> of<00:04:02.430> the<00:04:02.550> south<00:04:02.760> like

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
from the north instead of the south like

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.699 
from the north instead of the south like
it<00:04:03.120> was<00:04:03.270> yesterday<00:04:03.450> and<00:04:03.990> he<00:04:04.050> got<00:04:04.230> a<00:04:04.260> lot<00:04:04.440> cooler

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
it was yesterday and he got a lot cooler

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:06.140 
it was yesterday and he got a lot cooler
so<00:04:05.160> I<00:04:05.220> figured<00:04:05.520> the<00:04:05.640> deer<00:04:05.790> we're<00:04:05.880> gonna<00:04:05.970> be

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
so I figured the deer we're gonna be

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:07.309 
so I figured the deer we're gonna be
moving<00:04:06.300> around<00:04:06.540> a<00:04:06.750> little<00:04:06.959> bit<00:04:07.050> more<00:04:07.230> than

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:52.889 
cool that was worth it right there to

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:56.060 
cool that was worth it right there to
get<00:04:53.010> out<00:04:53.160> of<00:04:53.280> bed<00:04:53.400> early<00:04:54.680> you<00:04:55.680> know<00:04:55.770> I<00:04:55.800> watched

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
him I watched him for about an hour I

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.370 
him I watched him for about an hour I
guess<00:04:58.610> so<00:04:59.610> after<00:05:00.000> you<00:05:00.720> know<00:05:00.870> after<00:05:01.050> watching

him for that hour he finally decided I

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.469

00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:20.039 
the season and it's just hard to top

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:23.779 
the season and it's just hard to top
that<00:05:20.240> yeah<00:05:21.240> next<00:05:21.810> year<00:05:21.870> if<00:05:22.830> I<00:05:23.190> see<00:05:23.430> something

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:23.789

bigger<00:05:25.650> I'll<00:05:26.039> probably<00:05:26.490> take<00:05:26.880> something<00:05:27.330> but

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:27.720 
bigger I'll probably take something but

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.480 
bigger I'll probably take something but
this<00:05:28.289> time<00:05:28.530> I<00:05:28.560> think<00:05:28.740> I'm<00:05:29.010> just<00:05:29.160> gonna<00:05:29.250> let

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:29.490 
this time I think I'm just gonna let

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.860

these guys walk and hopefully reproduce
