00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:19.869 
time for perfect exposures in one shot

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:21.419 
time for perfect exposures in one shot
now<00:00:20.080> what<00:00:20.200> we're<00:00:20.289> gonna<00:00:20.350> do<00:00:20.560> is<00:00:20.980> I<00:00:21.130> flipped

now what we're gonna do is I flipped
over<00:00:21.519> to<00:00:21.699> spot<00:00:22.000> metering<00:00:22.300> on<00:00:22.390> my<00:00:22.480> camera<00:00:22.720> so<00:00:22.840> I

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:22.990 
over to spot metering on my camera so I

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:24.300 
over to spot metering on my camera so I
want<00:00:23.170> you<00:00:23.260> guys<00:00:23.320> to<00:00:23.380> do<00:00:23.529> the<00:00:23.650> same<00:00:23.859> thing<00:00:24.099> let's

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:24.310 
want you guys to do the same thing let's

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:25.710 
want you guys to do the same thing let's
go<00:00:24.429> ahead<00:00:24.519> and<00:00:24.730> make<00:00:25.090> sure<00:00:25.119> actually<00:00:25.449> weird

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:25.720 
go ahead and make sure actually weird

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.079 
go ahead and make sure actually weird
spot<00:00:25.929> metering<00:00:26.170> mode<00:00:26.349> now<00:00:27.250> we<00:00:27.640> have<00:00:27.849> done

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:28.089 
spot metering mode now we have done

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:29.730 
spot metering mode now we have done
several<00:00:28.539> examples<00:00:28.990> of<00:00:29.080> spot<00:00:29.320> metering<00:00:29.560> we're

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:29.740 
several examples of spot metering we're

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:30.779 
several examples of spot metering we're
doing<00:00:29.890> it<00:00:29.980> throughout<00:00:30.160> the<00:00:30.279> course<00:00:30.490> basically

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:30.789 
doing it throughout the course basically

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:32.790 
doing it throughout the course basically
spot<00:00:31.089> metering<00:00:31.419> on<00:00:31.539> our<00:00:31.660> models<00:00:31.990> skin<00:00:32.169> to<00:00:32.650> get

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:32.800 
spot metering on our models skin to get

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.310 
spot metering on our models skin to get
the<00:00:32.890> perfect<00:00:33.160> skin<00:00:33.550> tones<00:00:33.760> in<00:00:33.970> one<00:00:34.240> try<00:00:34.540> that's

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:35.320 
the perfect skin tones in one try that's

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.450 
the perfect skin tones in one try that's
great<00:00:35.650> and<00:00:35.800> all<00:00:35.830> but<00:00:36.010> we<00:00:36.070> can<00:00:36.100> actually<00:00:36.280> use

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:36.460 
great and all but we can actually use

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.760 
great and all but we can actually use
spot<00:00:36.760> metering<00:00:37.060> for<00:00:37.150> well<00:00:37.660> anything<00:00:38.230> let's

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:38.770 
spot metering for well anything let's

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:40.380 
spot metering for well anything let's
say<00:00:38.860> for<00:00:39.129> example<00:00:39.520> I<00:00:39.670> wanted<00:00:39.940> to<00:00:40.059> get<00:00:40.210> a

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:40.390 
say for example I wanted to get a

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.200 
say for example I wanted to get a
perfect<00:00:40.840> exposure<00:00:41.200> of<00:00:41.530> this<00:00:41.770> dirt<00:00:42.309> sorry

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.210 
perfect exposure of this dirt sorry

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.729 
perfect exposure of this dirt sorry
Whitney<00:00:43.750> I'm<00:00:44.440> gonna<00:00:44.710> shoot<00:00:44.949> the<00:00:45.039> dirt<00:00:46.739> okay

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:47.739 
Whitney I'm gonna shoot the dirt okay

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:14.650 
get a meter on the sky like what if I

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.920 
get a meter on the sky like what if I
want<00:01:14.830> to<00:01:14.890> light<00:01:15.130> this<00:01:15.340> scene<00:01:15.640> with<00:01:15.820> flash<00:01:16.119> but

well I can go ahead and I can meet her

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:21.390 
well I can go ahead and I can meet her
directly<00:01:19.659> on<00:01:20.020> the<00:01:20.080> sky<00:01:20.290> up<00:01:20.439> there<00:01:20.470> and<00:01:21.189> I<00:01:21.280> can

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:21.400 
directly on the sky up there and I can

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.370 
directly on the sky up there and I can
go<00:01:21.490> ahead<00:01:21.610> and<00:01:21.729> bring<00:01:21.939> this<00:01:22.150> down<00:01:22.420> to<00:01:22.630> like<00:01:22.960> one

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
go ahead and bring this down to like one

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:24.630 
go ahead and bring this down to like one
four<00:01:23.710> thousand<00:01:24.070> of<00:01:24.100> a<00:01:24.189> second<00:01:24.460> which<00:01:24.549> is

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
four thousand of a second which is

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.800 
four thousand of a second which is
telling<00:01:24.850> me<00:01:24.970> that's<00:01:25.090> what<00:01:25.270> I<00:01:25.299> need<00:01:25.479> to<00:01:25.509> be<00:01:25.659> at

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
telling me that's what I need to be at

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.560 
telling me that's what I need to be at
at<00:01:26.070> f-22<00:01:27.070> not<00:01:27.250> blow<00:01:27.460> out<00:01:27.520> the<00:01:27.670> sky<00:01:27.880> now<00:01:28.420> let's

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
at f-22 not blow out the sky now let's

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.050 
at f-22 not blow out the sky now let's
go<00:01:28.659> ahead<00:01:28.720> and<00:01:28.930> take<00:01:29.049> that<00:01:29.079> shot<00:01:29.470> and<00:01:29.939> there<00:01:30.939> we

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
go ahead and take that shot and there we

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:32.609 
go ahead and take that shot and there we
go<00:01:31.150> we<00:01:31.270> have<00:01:31.299> the<00:01:31.479> tree<00:01:31.750> that's<00:01:32.020> kind<00:01:32.290> of<00:01:32.350> dark

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:32.619 
go we have the tree that's kind of dark

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:33.899 
go we have the tree that's kind of dark
but<00:01:32.799> we<00:01:32.860> have<00:01:32.950> the<00:01:33.040> sky<00:01:33.250> that's<00:01:33.460> perfectly

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:33.909 
but we have the sky that's perfectly

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:35.819 
but we have the sky that's perfectly
exposed<00:01:34.360> I<00:01:34.720> can<00:01:35.049> even<00:01:35.200> place<00:01:35.380> it<00:01:35.530> directly

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:35.829 
exposed I can even place it directly

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:37.289 
exposed I can even place it directly
over<00:01:36.040> the<00:01:36.130> tree<00:01:36.340> so<00:01:36.549> let's<00:01:36.729> say<00:01:36.820> we<00:01:36.939> put<00:01:37.090> over

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:37.299 
over the tree so let's say we put over

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:38.789 
over the tree so let's say we put over
the<00:01:37.390> tree<00:01:37.630> now<00:01:38.229> let's<00:01:38.380> telling<00:01:38.530> me<00:01:38.590> to<00:01:38.680> go<00:01:38.770> back

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:38.799 
the tree now let's telling me to go back

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:40.859 
the tree now let's telling me to go back
up<00:01:39.130> to<00:01:39.250> like<00:01:39.399> one<00:01:39.670> four<00:01:40.210> hundred<00:01:40.450> of<00:01:40.509> a<00:01:40.570> second

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869 
up to like one four hundred of a second

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:42.690 
up to like one four hundred of a second
I'm<00:01:40.930> gonna<00:01:41.020> bring<00:01:41.259> it<00:01:41.380> up<00:01:41.560> actually<00:01:42.310> gonna<00:01:42.610> go

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
I'm gonna bring it up actually gonna go

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.100 
I'm gonna bring it up actually gonna go
up<00:01:42.759> to<00:01:42.820> the<00:01:42.909> top<00:01:43.090> of<00:01:43.210> the<00:01:43.270> tree<00:01:43.450> so<00:01:43.689> now<00:01:43.720> it's<00:01:44.020> at

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
up to the top of the tree so now it's at

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:45.240 
up to the top of the tree so now it's at
one<00:01:44.290> eight<00:01:44.560> hundred<00:01:44.590> four<00:01:44.979> one<00:01:45.100> one

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
one eight hundred four one one

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.460 
one eight hundred four one one
thousandth<00:01:45.579> of<00:01:45.610> a<00:01:45.700> second<00:01:46.060> alright<00:01:46.930> so<00:01:47.290> there

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
thousandth of a second alright so there

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:48.870 
thousandth of a second alright so there
we<00:01:47.590> go<00:01:47.619> that's<00:01:47.950> at<00:01:48.130> the<00:01:48.219> top<00:01:48.399> of<00:01:48.520> the<00:01:48.579> tree<00:01:48.729> and

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
we go that's at the top of the tree and

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.490 
we go that's at the top of the tree and
now<00:01:48.939> the<00:01:49.000> tree<00:01:49.360> is<00:01:49.570> correctly<00:01:49.930> exposed<00:01:50.320> where

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
now the tree is correctly exposed where

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.709 
now the tree is correctly exposed where
we<00:01:50.619> metered<00:01:50.890> it<00:01:51.009> spot<00:01:51.820> metering<00:01:52.090> is<00:01:52.240> beautiful

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:52.719 
we metered it spot metering is beautiful

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:55.350 
we metered it spot metering is beautiful
because<00:01:52.899> it<00:01:53.020> only<00:01:53.259> reads<00:01:53.680> that<00:01:53.979> tiny<00:01:54.460> three<00:01:55.180> to

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
because it only reads that tiny three to

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.600 
because it only reads that tiny three to
five<00:01:55.570> percent<00:01:55.780> amount<00:01:56.740> of<00:01:56.890> the<00:01:56.979> screen<00:01:57.340> and<00:01:57.520> it

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
five percent amount of the screen and it

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:58.950 
five percent amount of the screen and it
gives<00:01:57.790> you<00:01:57.909> that<00:01:58.030> reading<00:01:58.420> so<00:01:58.540> it's<00:01:58.689> great<00:01:58.930> for

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
gives you that reading so it's great for

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:59.999 
gives you that reading so it's great for
getting<00:01:59.290> a<00:01:59.350> reading<00:01:59.530> on<00:01:59.649> anything

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
getting a reading on anything

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:01.709 
getting a reading on anything
particularly<00:02:01.000> when<00:02:01.240> we<00:02:01.299> want<00:02:01.450> to<00:02:01.509> basically

particularly when we want to basically

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:03.929 
particularly when we want to basically
add<00:02:01.960> light<00:02:02.259> to<00:02:02.289> a<00:02:02.439> scene<00:02:02.770> and<00:02:02.979> basically<00:02:03.520> keep

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:03.939 
add light to a scene and basically keep

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:05.520 
add light to a scene and basically keep
the<00:02:04.119> background<00:02:04.329> exposure<00:02:04.869> the<00:02:04.990> way<00:02:05.079> it<00:02:05.170> is<00:02:05.289> or

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
the background exposure the way it is or

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.590 
the background exposure the way it is or
if<00:02:05.649> we<00:02:05.770> want<00:02:06.009> to<00:02:06.130> expose<00:02:06.460> the<00:02:06.640> scene<00:02:06.850> however

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
if we want to expose the scene however

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.600 
if we want to expose the scene however
we<00:02:07.780> need<00:02:07.990> to<00:02:08.259> and<00:02:08.470> for<00:02:09.039> this<00:02:09.160> scene<00:02:09.399> I<00:02:09.430> actually

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
skin tone at one foot of a second four

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.240 
skin tone at one foot of a second four
hundredths<00:03:28.239> of<00:03:28.299> a<00:03:28.390> second<00:03:28.720> f2<00:03:29.350> and<00:03:29.590> ISO<00:03:29.860> 100

now<00:03:30.760> we're<00:03:31.000> ready<00:03:31.150> to<00:03:31.269> have<00:03:31.420> you<00:03:31.540> hop<00:03:31.720> into<00:03:31.900> the

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
now we're ready to have you hop into the

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:36.560 
now we're ready to have you hop into the
scene<00:03:32.170> okay<00:03:32.440> so<00:03:32.500> I'm<00:03:33.340> gonna<00:03:33.519> help<00:03:33.640> you<00:03:33.760> out

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.340 

what<00:03:37.570> we're<00:03:37.690> gonna<00:03:37.750> do<00:03:37.900> is<00:03:37.959> I'm<00:03:38.019> gonna<00:03:38.110> shoot

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
what we're gonna do is I'm gonna shoot

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:39.660 
what we're gonna do is I'm gonna shoot
this<00:03:38.530> so<00:03:38.680> that<00:03:38.799> these<00:03:38.920> branches<00:03:39.370> are<00:03:39.430> kind<00:03:39.610> of

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
this so that these branches are kind of

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.430 
this so that these branches are kind of
curving<00:03:40.090> over<00:03:40.390> at<00:03:40.570> f/2<00:03:40.989> it's<00:03:41.110> gonna<00:03:41.200> look

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
curving over at f/2 it's gonna look

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.350 
curving over at f/2 it's gonna look
really<00:03:41.739> beautiful<00:03:42.280> kind<00:03:42.700> of<00:03:42.820> blurring<00:03:43.120> the

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
really beautiful kind of blurring the

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
really beautiful kind of blurring the
background<00:03:43.450> is<00:03:43.720> gonna<00:03:43.810> have<00:03:43.959> a<00:03:43.989> really<00:03:44.200> nice

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
background is gonna have a really nice

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.259 
background is gonna have a really nice
look<00:03:44.680> we<00:03:45.160> have<00:03:45.310> her<00:03:45.400> propping<00:03:45.820> one<00:03:45.970> knee<00:03:46.120> up

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:46.269 
look we have her propping one knee up

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:47.640 
look we have her propping one knee up
because<00:03:46.510> like<00:03:46.630> again<00:03:46.900> it<00:03:47.019> creates<00:03:47.200> a<00:03:47.470> little

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
because like again it creates a little

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.830 
because like again it creates a little
bit<00:03:47.739> of<00:03:47.860> well<00:03:48.610> space<00:03:49.030> between<00:03:49.390> the<00:03:49.510> legs<00:03:49.690> we

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
bit of well space between the legs we

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:50.880 
bit of well space between the legs we
don't<00:03:49.959> want<00:03:50.080> the<00:03:50.140> legs<00:03:50.320> to<00:03:50.470> look<00:03:50.590> like<00:03:50.769> they're

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:50.890 
don't want the legs to look like they're

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:52.530 
don't want the legs to look like they're
just<00:03:50.920> one<00:03:51.250> piece<00:03:51.489> want<00:03:52.060> to<00:03:52.150> create<00:03:52.330> space

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
just one piece want to create space

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.120 
just one piece want to create space
there<00:03:52.959> and<00:03:53.140> it<00:03:53.320> also<00:03:53.620> creates<00:03:53.950> a<00:03:54.010> little

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 
there and it also creates a little

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:55.800 
there and it also creates a little
triangle<00:03:54.549> in<00:03:54.700> the<00:03:54.790> shot<00:03:55.000> which<00:03:55.480> is<00:03:55.510> really

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
triangle in the shot which is really

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.090 
triangle in the shot which is really
nice<00:03:55.930> her<00:03:56.110> arm<00:03:56.380> is<00:03:56.560> doing<00:03:56.769> the<00:03:56.860> same<00:03:57.040> thing

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
nice her arm is doing the same thing

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.789 
nice her arm is doing the same thing
actually<00:03:57.640> and<00:03:57.820> it<00:03:57.880> adds<00:03:58.030> a<00:03:58.209> lot<00:03:58.330> of<00:03:58.390> interest

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 
actually and it adds a lot of interest

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:01.050 
actually and it adds a lot of interest
triangles<00:03:59.799> are<00:03:59.950> a<00:03:59.980> compositional<00:04:00.549> piece<00:04:00.730> that

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
triangles are a compositional piece that

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:07.130 
triangles are a compositional piece that
looks<00:04:01.510> great<00:04:02.049> okay<00:04:02.620> so<00:04:02.680> let's<00:04:02.950> cheer<00:04:03.070> our<00:04:03.160> shot

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.570 

perfect<00:04:08.140> I'm<00:04:08.290> using<00:04:08.440> that<00:04:08.650> AF<00:04:09.160> point<00:04:09.400> that's

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:09.580 
perfect I'm using that AF point that's

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.580 
perfect I'm using that AF point that's
really<00:04:09.880> close<00:04:10.060> to<00:04:10.299> her<00:04:10.390> and<00:04:10.540> then<00:04:10.959> recomposing

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
really close to her and then recomposing

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.500 
really close to her and then recomposing
if<00:04:11.680> I<00:04:11.769> need<00:04:11.980> I'm<00:04:12.400> gonna<00:04:12.580> take<00:04:12.790> a<00:04:12.820> quick<00:04:13.120> reading

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
if I need I'm gonna take a quick reading

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.030 
if I need I'm gonna take a quick reading
and<00:04:13.690> just<00:04:13.750> look<00:04:13.989> at<00:04:14.080> my<00:04:14.200> exposure<00:04:14.590> settings<00:04:14.950> it

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
and just look at my exposure settings it

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.979 
and just look at my exposure settings it
looks<00:04:15.250> like<00:04:15.489> I<00:04:15.760> really<00:04:16.060> don't<00:04:16.419> have<00:04:16.540> much<00:04:16.660> of

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
looks like I really don't have much of

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:18.960 
looks like I really don't have much of
the<00:04:17.229> background<00:04:17.440> blown<00:04:17.890> out<00:04:18.070> so<00:04:18.100> what<00:04:18.760> I<00:04:18.790> might

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
the background blown out so what I might

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.150 
the background blown out so what I might
do<00:04:19.150> here<00:04:19.390> is<00:04:19.570> just<00:04:19.600> I'm<00:04:20.380> gonna<00:04:20.560> drop<00:04:20.859> it<00:04:20.919> down

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
do here is just I'm gonna drop it down

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.920 
do here is just I'm gonna drop it down
one<00:04:21.220> setting<00:04:21.940> I'm<00:04:22.150> gonna<00:04:22.330> go<00:04:22.390> to<00:04:22.479> one<00:04:22.630> three

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
one setting I'm gonna go to one three

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.310 
one setting I'm gonna go to one three
twentieth<00:04:23.290> of<00:04:23.320> a<00:04:23.440> second<00:04:24.000> and<00:04:25.260> wouldn't<00:04:26.260> you

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
twentieth of a second and wouldn't you

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.510 
twentieth of a second and wouldn't you
look<00:04:26.470> over<00:04:26.680> to<00:04:26.770> this<00:04:26.860> side<00:04:27.070> a<00:04:27.099> little<00:04:27.280> more<00:04:27.430> so

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
look over to this side a little more so

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.130

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
automated modes because it's going to

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:55.930 
automated modes because it's going to
create<00:04:54.650> all<00:04:54.800> sorts<00:04:54.830> of<00:04:55.130> funky<00:04:55.460> exposures

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:55.940 
create all sorts of funky exposures
