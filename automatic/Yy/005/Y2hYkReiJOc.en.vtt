some muscle mass for the NFL and then I

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.039

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
when I was making I just made some

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.170 
when I was making I just made some
balance<00:01:35.009> running<00:01:35.220> backs<00:01:35.430> just<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:35.729> test<00:01:36.000> this

balance running backs just to test this
out<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:36.420> I<00:01:36.900> put<00:01:37.020> them<00:01:37.110> on<00:01:37.140> like<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.350> Minnesota

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
out and I put them on like the Minnesota

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.020 
out and I put them on like the Minnesota
Vikings<00:01:38.189> who<00:01:38.280> have<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.490> best<00:01:38.610> running<00:01:38.909> back

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
Vikings who have the best running back

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.030 
Vikings who have the best running back
in<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.180> game<00:01:39.360> 97<00:01:39.900> overall<00:01:40.200> Adrian<00:01:40.590> Peterson

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
in the game 97 overall Adrian Peterson

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.800 
in the game 97 overall Adrian Peterson
and<00:01:41.220> there'll<00:01:41.640> be<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.820> automatic<00:01:42.210> starter

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
and there'll be the automatic starter

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.679 
and there'll be the automatic starter
but<00:01:43.320> I<00:01:43.890> didn't<00:01:44.549> advance<00:01:44.939> to<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.270> actual

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
but I didn't advance to the actual

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.270 
but I didn't advance to the actual
season<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.350> when<00:01:46.500> you<00:01:46.590> advance<00:01:46.979> to<00:01:47.159> the

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
season and when you advance to the

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.830 
season and when you advance to the
preseason<00:01:47.640> that<00:01:47.880> you<00:01:47.970> actually<00:01:48.270> go<00:01:48.420> lower<00:01:48.689> on

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
preseason that you actually go lower on

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.080 
preseason that you actually go lower on
the<00:01:48.930> depth<00:01:49.170> chart<00:01:49.470> so<00:01:49.920> kaca<00:01:50.280> is<00:01:50.579> a<00:01:50.729> fourth

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
the depth chart so kaca is a fourth

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.330 
the depth chart so kaca is a fourth
string<00:01:51.540> running<00:01:51.869> back<00:01:52.049> right<00:01:52.320> now<00:01:52.560> but<00:01:53.130> one

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
string running back right now but one

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.950 
string running back right now but one
way<00:01:53.490> to<00:01:53.549> progress<00:01:53.850> up<00:01:54.090> a<00:01:54.210> depth<00:01:54.420> chart<00:01:54.720> and<00:01:54.869> to

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
way to progress up a depth chart and to

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.690 
way to progress up a depth chart and to
gain<00:01:55.229> more<00:01:55.500> attributes<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.369> upitis

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
gain more attributes and the upitis

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.060 
gain more attributes and the upitis
skills<00:01:57.060> as<00:01:57.240> they<00:01:57.360> do<00:01:57.509> practice<00:01:58.110> mode<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:58.619> this

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
skills as they do practice mode and this

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.380 
skills as they do practice mode and this
is<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.340> one<00:01:59.430> I<00:01:59.460> like<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.670> most<00:01:59.790> so<00:02:00.149> far

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
is the one I like the most so far

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.910 
is the one I like the most so far
because<00:02:00.540> you're<00:02:00.750> only<00:02:00.869> down<00:02:01.110> by<00:02:01.170> six<00:02:01.710> it's

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
because you're only down by six it's

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.130 
because you're only down by six it's
only<00:02:02.040> three<00:02:02.369> minutes<00:02:02.640> in<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:02.850> game<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.360> you

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
only three minutes in the game and you

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.499 
only three minutes in the game and you
get<00:02:04.259> like<00:02:04.380> 1,300<00:02:05.250> XP<00:02:05.670> if<00:02:05.850> you<00:02:05.969> complete<00:02:06.360> this

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
get like 1,300 XP if you complete this

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.059 
get like 1,300 XP if you complete this
challenge<00:02:06.810> which<00:02:07.170> is<00:02:07.290> basically<00:02:07.649> a<00:02:07.740> take<00:02:08.039> the

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
challenge which is basically a take the

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.800 
challenge which is basically a take the
lead<00:02:08.399> and<00:02:08.670> win<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.060> game<00:02:09.239> with<00:02:09.420> only<00:02:09.509> three

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
lead and win the game with only three

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.720 
lead and win the game with only three
minutes<00:02:09.959> to<00:02:10.170> go<00:02:10.349> and<00:02:10.560> I<00:02:11.250> don't<00:02:11.310> want<00:02:11.520> to<00:02:11.580> take

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
minutes to go and I don't want to take

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.580 
minutes to go and I don't want to take
forever<00:02:11.940> in<00:02:12.390> these<00:02:12.569> practice<00:02:13.050> modes

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
forever in these practice modes

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.740 
forever in these practice modes
so<00:02:13.800> I<00:02:13.830> chose<00:02:14.130> this<00:02:14.400> one<00:02:14.670> you<00:02:15.150> can<00:02:15.330> see<00:02:15.450> how<00:02:15.540> Koch

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
so I chose this one you can see how Koch

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.360 
so I chose this one you can see how Koch
out<00:02:15.989> of<00:02:16.080> the<00:02:16.140> backfield<00:02:16.560> making<00:02:16.860> a<00:02:16.950> catch<00:02:17.099> want

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
out of the backfield making a catch want

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.650 
out of the backfield making a catch want
to<00:02:17.430> make<00:02:17.520> him<00:02:17.640> a<00:02:17.730> very<00:02:17.910> balanced<00:02:18.360> running<00:02:18.569> back

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
to make him a very balanced running back

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.000 
to make him a very balanced running back
and<00:02:18.870> catch<00:02:19.020> on<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.260> backfield<00:02:19.620> and<00:02:19.800> run<00:02:19.920> the

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
and catch on the backfield and run the

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.010 
and catch on the backfield and run the
ball<00:02:20.160> effectively<00:02:20.280> and<00:02:21.180> against<00:02:21.690> us<00:02:21.810> what<00:02:21.930> I'm

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
ball effectively and against us what I'm

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.870 
ball effectively and against us what I'm
assuming<00:02:22.410> is<00:02:22.500> a<00:02:22.530> practice<00:02:23.069> squad<00:02:23.280> defense

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
assuming is a practice squad defense

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.580 
assuming is a practice squad defense
because<00:02:24.239> they're<00:02:24.420> wearing<00:02:24.630> not<00:02:25.080> even<00:02:25.319> Cowboys

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
because they're wearing not even Cowboys

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.380 
because they're wearing not even Cowboys
well<00:02:26.040> there<00:02:26.130> are<00:02:26.220> warning<00:02:26.550> Cowboys<00:02:26.849> uniforms

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
well there are warning Cowboys uniforms

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.059 
well there are warning Cowboys uniforms
like<00:02:27.510> I<00:02:27.900> don't<00:02:28.290> even<00:02:28.440> know<00:02:28.590> who<00:02:28.739> the<00:02:28.830> hell<00:02:28.980> were

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
like I don't even know who the hell were

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:30.050 
like I don't even know who the hell were
playing<00:02:29.340> because<00:02:29.550> whenever<00:02:29.730> they<00:02:29.910> make<00:02:30.000> a

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
playing because whenever they make a

tackle<00:02:30.569> it's<00:02:30.720> like<00:02:30.930> linebacker<00:02:31.590> with<00:02:32.190> one

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900

what<00:02:53.250> I<00:02:53.670> wish<00:02:53.819> they<00:02:53.970> would<00:02:54.090> do<00:02:54.330> more<00:02:54.600> of<00:02:54.630> in

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
what I wish they would do more of in

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.600 
what I wish they would do more of in
here<00:02:55.260> is<00:02:55.380> they<00:02:55.860> have<00:02:56.040> to<00:02:56.190> get<00:02:56.370> you<00:02:56.459> more

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
here is they have to get you more

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.699 
here is they have to get you more
playing<00:02:56.910> time<00:02:57.000> because<00:02:57.630> they<00:02:57.900> only<00:02:58.140> do<00:02:58.560> the

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
playing time because they only do the

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.949 
playing time because they only do the
backups<00:02:59.220> like<00:02:59.459> once<00:02:59.910> after<00:03:00.420> the<00:03:00.750> first

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
backups like once after the first

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:02.750 
backups like once after the first
quarter<00:03:01.260> in<00:03:01.380> the<00:03:01.440> first<00:03:01.650> game<00:03:01.920> the<00:03:02.099> backups

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
quarter in the first game the backups

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.280 
quarter in the first game the backups
for<00:03:02.880> the<00:03:02.970> rest<00:03:03.180> of<00:03:03.269> the<00:03:03.360> game<00:03:03.540> but<00:03:04.019> they<00:03:04.110> only

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
for the rest of the game but they only

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.470 
for the rest of the game but they only
go<00:03:04.560> to<00:03:04.620> second<00:03:05.130> string<00:03:05.430> whereas<00:03:05.790> okasha<00:03:06.150> is

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
go to second string whereas okasha is

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.930 
go to second string whereas okasha is
fourth<00:03:06.959> string<00:03:07.410> and<00:03:07.590> never<00:03:08.489> making<00:03:08.700> like<00:03:08.849> the

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
fourth string and never making like the

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.580 
fourth string and never making like the
third<00:03:09.209> down<00:03:09.480> running<00:03:09.690> back<00:03:09.959> and<00:03:10.230> so<00:03:10.410> he

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
third down running back and so he

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.320 
third down running back and so he
doesn't<00:03:10.769> get<00:03:10.980> any<00:03:11.069> offensive<00:03:11.670> snaps<00:03:11.970> in<00:03:12.209> this

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
doesn't get any offensive snaps in this

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.539 
doesn't get any offensive snaps in this
game<00:03:12.540> all<00:03:12.989> he<00:03:13.140> got<00:03:13.319> was<00:03:13.349> to<00:03:13.769> kickoff<00:03:14.130> returns

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
game all he got was to kickoff returns

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:15.979 
game all he got was to kickoff returns
and<00:03:14.790> I'm<00:03:14.849> not<00:03:14.970> gonna<00:03:15.120> kneel<00:03:15.360> a<00:03:15.390> single<00:03:15.840> one<00:03:15.959> of

call it but we're gonna basically do the

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.800 
call it but we're gonna basically do the

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
probably gonna mix up a little bit but I

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.550 
probably gonna mix up a little bit but I

but<00:04:10.650> actually<00:04:11.010> today<00:04:11.130> I<00:04:11.280> went<00:04:11.549> to<00:04:11.639> go<00:04:11.790> make

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
but actually today I went to go make

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.940 
but actually today I went to go make
okasha<00:04:12.420> twice<00:04:12.989> because<00:04:13.260> the<00:04:13.380> first<00:04:13.709> time<00:04:13.920> I

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
okasha twice because the first time I

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.460 
okasha twice because the first time I
did<00:04:14.190> it<00:04:14.220> I<00:04:14.489> had<00:04:14.700> the<00:04:15.120> skill<00:04:15.389> set<00:04:15.750> of<00:04:15.780> all<00:04:16.019> Madden

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
did it I had the skill set of all Madden

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.650 
did it I had the skill set of all Madden
and<00:04:16.620> the<00:04:17.160> simulation<00:04:17.789> was<00:04:17.910> so<00:04:18.120> ridiculous

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
and the simulation was so ridiculous

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.300 
and the simulation was so ridiculous
because<00:04:18.810> the<00:04:19.019> Raiders<00:04:19.289> were<00:04:19.500> just<00:04:19.739> piling<00:04:20.070> on

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
because the Raiders were just piling on

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:21.710 
because the Raiders were just piling on
the<00:04:20.340> points<00:04:20.700> against<00:04:20.910> the<00:04:20.970> Cowboys<00:04:21.180> and<00:04:21.389> our

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
the points against the Cowboys and our

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.180 
the points against the Cowboys and our
team<00:04:21.870> didn't<00:04:22.080> even<00:04:22.169> score<00:04:22.500> until<00:04:22.860> we<00:04:22.950> had<00:04:23.070> like

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
team didn't even score until we had like

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.589 
team didn't even score until we had like
our<00:04:23.310> backups<00:04:23.700> in<00:04:23.789> the<00:04:23.880> game<00:04:24.060> when<00:04:24.210> I<00:04:24.240> seemed

00:04:24.589 --> 00:04:24.599 
our backups in the game when I seemed

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:26.149 
our backups in the game when I seemed
elated<00:04:24.810> that<00:04:24.900> game<00:04:25.080> and<00:04:25.289> it<00:04:25.710> made<00:04:25.890> me<00:04:26.039> the

00:04:26.149 --> 00:04:26.159 
elated that game and it made me the

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:27.150 
elated that game and it made me the
starter<00:04:26.610> the<00:04:26.700> next

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
starter the next

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.070 
starter the next
so<00:04:27.430> I<00:04:27.490> was<00:04:27.640> wondering<00:04:27.850> if<00:04:28.180> by<00:04:28.210> a<00:04:28.390> chance<00:04:28.780> I'd

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
so I was wondering if by a chance I'd

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.020 
so I was wondering if by a chance I'd
change<00:04:29.410> a<00:04:29.560> skill<00:04:29.800> level<00:04:30.130> and<00:04:30.310> I<00:04:30.400> changed<00:04:30.910> the

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
change a skill level and I changed the

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:32.730 
change a skill level and I changed the
mode<00:04:31.210> a<00:04:31.240> little<00:04:31.420> bit<00:04:31.660> so<00:04:31.900> that<00:04:31.930> I<00:04:32.110> became<00:04:32.590> the

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
mode a little bit so that I became the

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.260 
mode a little bit so that I became the
starter<00:04:33.100> I<00:04:33.130> couldn't<00:04:33.610> figure<00:04:33.730> out<00:04:33.850> why<00:04:33.910> I<00:04:34.030> was

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
starter I couldn't figure out why I was

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.450 
starter I couldn't figure out why I was
now<00:04:34.420> the<00:04:34.480> starter<00:04:34.900> but<00:04:35.440> now<00:04:35.710> in<00:04:35.920> this<00:04:36.070> game<00:04:36.280> it

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
now the starter but now in this game it

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.310 
now the starter but now in this game it
made<00:04:36.580> me<00:04:36.670> the<00:04:36.730> server<00:04:36.970> once<00:04:37.210> again<00:04:37.600> and<00:04:37.870> I

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 
made me the server once again and I

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.960 
made me the server once again and I
never<00:04:38.560> changed<00:04:39.010> a<00:04:39.040> skill<00:04:39.250> level<00:04:39.370> off<00:04:39.640> of<00:04:39.820> all

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970 
never changed a skill level off of all

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:41.580 
never changed a skill level off of all
pro<00:04:40.330> and<00:04:40.540> so<00:04:40.600> there's<00:04:40.810> some<00:04:41.020> sort<00:04:41.230> of<00:04:41.320> glitch

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
pro and so there's some sort of glitch

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.560 
pro and so there's some sort of glitch

Philip<00:04:55.720> Tanner<00:04:56.020> I<00:04:56.290> should<00:04:56.770> be<00:04:56.890> at<00:04:57.040> a<00:04:57.070> Lance

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
Philip Tanner I should be at a Lance

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.090 
Philip Tanner I should be at a Lance
Dunbar<00:04:57.670> but<00:04:58.240> I<00:04:58.510> should<00:04:58.840> not<00:04:59.020> be<00:04:59.290> starting

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.100 
Dunbar but I should not be starting

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.190 
Dunbar but I should not be starting
right<00:05:00.130> now<00:05:00.310> and<00:05:00.730> I<00:05:01.420> don't<00:05:01.480> want<00:05:01.810> to<00:05:01.900> keep

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:02.200 
right now and I don't want to keep

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.110 
right now and I don't want to keep
prolonging<00:05:02.680> this<00:05:02.980> series<00:05:03.340> from<00:05:03.430> starting<00:05:03.970> and

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
prolonging this series from starting and

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.430 
prolonging this series from starting and
so<00:05:04.210> I'm<00:05:04.330> probably<00:05:04.600> gonna<00:05:04.840> keep<00:05:05.110> it<00:05:05.260> this<00:05:05.380> way

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 
so I'm probably gonna keep it this way

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.590 
so I'm probably gonna keep it this way
unless<00:05:06.220> you<00:05:06.400> guys<00:05:06.550> know<00:05:06.760> a<00:05:06.790> way<00:05:07.030> around<00:05:07.180> this

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600 
unless you guys know a way around this

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:08.880 
unless you guys know a way around this
that<00:05:07.810> wouldn't<00:05:07.960> take<00:05:08.110> me<00:05:08.320> a<00:05:08.350> lot<00:05:08.500> of<00:05:08.530> time<00:05:08.770> to

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:08.890 
that wouldn't take me a lot of time to

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:11.160 
that wouldn't take me a lot of time to
go<00:05:09.010> recreate<00:05:09.460> okasha<00:05:09.790> for<00:05:10.210> was<00:05:10.360> like<00:05:10.570> a<00:05:10.600> sixth
