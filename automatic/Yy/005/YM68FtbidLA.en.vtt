thought that improbably hazard Oscar and

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.029 
thought that improbably hazard Oscar and
Moses<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.989> first<00:00:49.260> game<00:00:49.440> is<00:00:49.559> he<00:00:49.649> then<00:00:49.829> but

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
Moses the first game is he then but

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
so marco van ginkel another impressive

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.210 
so marco van ginkel another impressive
performance<00:01:18.360> I<00:01:18.450> think<00:01:18.479> he<00:01:19.140> was<00:01:19.290> very<00:01:19.320> good<00:01:19.740> but

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
performance I think he was very good but

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.190 
performance I think he was very good but
he's<00:01:20.340> so<00:01:20.640> many<00:01:20.850> inside<00:01:21.240> he<00:01:21.659> doesn't<00:01:21.780> do<00:01:21.990> too

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
he's so many inside he doesn't do too

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.480 
he's so many inside he doesn't do too
much<00:01:22.229> respect<00:01:22.530> after<00:01:22.799> that<00:01:22.979> I<00:01:23.070> think<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:23.310> lot<00:01:23.460> of

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
much respect after that I think a lot of

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.580 
much respect after that I think a lot of
people<00:01:23.549> your<00:01:24.390> commentary<00:01:24.900> won't<00:01:25.140> pick<00:01:25.290> up<00:01:25.409> on

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
people your commentary won't pick up on
