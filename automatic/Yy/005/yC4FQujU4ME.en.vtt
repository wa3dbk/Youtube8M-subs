00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
car it's not fast at all but it doesn't

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.130 
car it's not fast at all but it doesn't
matter<00:00:51.239> because<00:00:51.420> we<00:00:51.690> have<00:00:51.780> a<00:00:51.840> speed<00:00:52.079> hack<00:00:54.140> um

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
matter because we have a speed hack um

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.360 
matter because we have a speed hack um
if<00:00:55.890> you<00:00:56.010> have<00:00:56.129> a<00:00:56.160> fast<00:00:57.000> on<00:00:57.719> my<00:00:57.780> computer<00:00:58.559> you're

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
if you have a fast on my computer you're

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.010 
if you have a fast on my computer you're
going<00:00:59.579> to<00:00:59.640> want<00:00:59.820> to<00:00:59.940> use<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.480> first<00:01:00.750> speed

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
going to want to use the first speed

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.840 
going to want to use the first speed
hack<00:01:01.199> that<00:01:01.410> I<00:01:01.440> give<00:01:01.680> you<00:01:01.859> um<00:01:02.190> if<00:01:02.609> you<00:01:02.730> have<00:01:02.820> a

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
hack that I give you um if you have a

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.549 
hack that I give you um if you have a
fast<00:01:03.149> computer<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:03.719> minute<00:01:04.019> you<00:01:04.199> should<00:01:04.379> use<00:01:04.530> a

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
fast computer a minute you should use a

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.270 
fast computer a minute you should use a
second

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:16.300 

ok<00:01:10.280> so<00:01:11.030> just<00:01:11.180> let<00:01:11.299> me<00:01:11.420> go<00:01:11.570> to<00:01:11.630> map<00:01:11.840> here<00:01:15.189> so<00:01:16.189> I'm

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
ok so just let me go to map here so I'm

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:22.510 
ok so just let me go to map here so I'm
going<00:01:16.520> to<00:01:16.579> join<00:01:16.759> a<00:01:16.789> game<00:01:21.159> so<00:01:22.159> when<00:01:22.369> you're

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
going to join a game so when you're

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.310 
going to join a game so when you're
doing<00:01:22.549> this<00:01:23.060> you're<00:01:23.390> not<00:01:23.539> going<00:01:23.929> to<00:01:23.990> use<00:01:24.140> the

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
doing this you're not going to use the

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.080 
doing this you're not going to use the
speed<00:01:24.649> hack<00:01:24.860> because<00:01:25.100> it<00:01:25.399> just<00:01:25.520> speeds<00:01:25.789> up<00:01:25.970> the

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
speed hack because it just speeds up the

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.419 
speed hack because it just speeds up the
time<00:01:26.329> everything's<00:01:26.810> going<00:01:26.990> to<00:01:27.020> be<00:01:27.200> all<00:01:27.319> f'd<00:01:27.590> so

00:01:28.419 --> 00:01:28.429 
time everything's going to be all f'd so

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:29.800 
time everything's going to be all f'd so
you<00:01:28.520> have<00:01:28.640> to<00:01:28.729> turn<00:01:28.880> the<00:01:29.000> speed<00:01:29.270> hack<00:01:29.539> off

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
you have to turn the speed hack off

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.499 
you have to turn the speed hack off
every<00:01:30.409> time<00:01:30.619> you<00:01:30.860> you<00:01:31.579> join<00:01:31.819> a<00:01:31.850> game<00:01:32.090> but<00:01:32.270> right

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
every time you you join a game but right

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:37.300 
every time you you join a game but right
when<00:01:32.750> you're<00:01:32.990> able<00:01:33.110> to<00:01:33.520> I'm<00:01:34.520> a<00:01:35.710> start<00:01:36.710> off<00:01:36.950> the

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
when you're able to I'm a start off the

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.279 
when you're able to I'm a start off the
finish<00:01:37.610> line<00:01:37.819> then<00:01:38.329> you're<00:01:38.840> going<00:01:38.990> to<00:01:39.049> want<00:01:39.200> to

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:39.289 
finish line then you're going to want to

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:42.070 
finish line then you're going to want to
start<00:01:39.679> it<00:01:40.330> can<00:01:41.330> just<00:01:41.450> go<00:01:41.539> away<00:01:41.720> from<00:01:41.929> more

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
start it can just go away from more

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.230 
start it can just go away from more
people<00:01:42.229> here<00:01:42.530> ok<00:01:43.250> that<00:01:43.399> should<00:01:43.429> be<00:01:43.670> enough<00:01:46.240> so

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
people here ok that should be enough so

a level 25 here pretty nice car 262
space<00:02:07.080> all<00:02:07.380> right<00:02:08.300> okay<00:02:09.300> so<00:02:10.289> then<00:02:10.500> after<00:02:10.890> you

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
space all right okay so then after you

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.170 
space all right okay so then after you
do<00:02:11.250> all<00:02:11.280> that<00:02:11.400> you<00:02:11.880> need<00:02:12.030> go<00:02:12.360> to<00:02:13.130> an<00:02:14.130> able<00:02:14.880> speed

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
do all that you need go to an able speed

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.570 
do all that you need go to an able speed
hack<00:02:15.770> you're<00:02:16.770> always<00:02:16.980> going<00:02:17.250> to<00:02:17.310> want<00:02:17.430> to

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
hack you're always going to want to

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:24.440 
hack you're always going to want to
switch<00:02:17.760> it<00:02:17.880> back<00:02:18.000> to<00:02:18.209> 1.0<00:02:18.990> after<00:02:19.320> a<00:02:19.350> race<00:02:23.450> wait

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
switch it back to 1.0 after a race wait

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.830 
switch it back to 1.0 after a race wait
for<00:02:24.690> this<00:02:24.780> to<00:02:24.840> start<00:02:25.230> up<00:02:29.060> all<00:02:30.060> right<00:02:30.239> now<00:02:30.510> go<00:02:30.780> to

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
for this to start up all right now go to

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.130 
for this to start up all right now go to
cheat<00:02:31.110> undred<00:02:31.380> really<00:02:31.590> quickly<00:02:32.120> go<00:02:33.120> to<00:02:33.180> 5.0<00:02:34.050> if

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
cheat undred really quickly go to 5.0 if

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.140 
cheat undred really quickly go to 5.0 if
you<00:02:34.230> have<00:02:34.320> a<00:02:34.380> fast<00:02:34.590> computer<00:02:34.769> go<00:02:35.160> to<00:02:35.190> 2.0<00:02:35.880> if

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
you have a fast computer go to 2.0 if

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:42.370 
you have a fast computer go to 2.0 if
you<00:02:36.600> have<00:02:36.720> a<00:02:36.750> slow<00:02:37.050> one<00:02:39.170> and<00:02:40.170> this<00:02:41.070> is<00:02:41.220> the<00:02:41.280> hack

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
you have a slow one and this is the hack

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.630 
you have a slow one and this is the hack
you<00:02:43.380> don't<00:02:43.560> really<00:02:43.650> fast<00:02:43.980> and<00:02:44.340> you<00:02:44.430> come<00:02:44.610> in

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
you don't really fast and you come in

00:02:44.640 --> 00:03:08.559 
you don't really fast and you come in
first<00:02:44.880> place<00:02:45.090> every<00:02:45.510> time

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:08.569 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:11.150 

and<00:03:09.569> I'll<00:03:09.989> give<00:03:10.170> you<00:03:10.260> proof<00:03:10.500> that<00:03:10.739> you<00:03:10.860> come<00:03:11.040> in

00:04:48.709 --> 00:04:48.719 
your speed hack and right when you're

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:58.640 
your speed hack and right when you're
done<00:04:53.330> go<00:04:54.330> back<00:04:54.599> down<00:04:54.900> to<00:04:56.990> watch<00:04:57.990> because<00:04:58.319> look

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:04.229 
the speed hack look at the time yeps up

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:06.379 
the speed hack look at the time yeps up
once<00:05:04.529> it<00:05:04.680> finds<00:05:04.979> it<00:05:05.189> it'll<00:05:05.580> say<00:05:05.759> network

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:06.389 
once it finds it it'll say network

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:08.329 
once it finds it it'll say network
server<00:05:06.779> and<00:05:07.259> you'll<00:05:07.529> be<00:05:07.800> logged<00:05:08.159> it

00:05:08.329 --> 00:05:08.339 
server and you'll be logged it
