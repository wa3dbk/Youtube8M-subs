that real quick it actually turned out
really<00:00:35.820> nice<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.840> wiring<00:00:37.200> was<00:00:37.290> a<00:00:37.350> bit<00:00:37.530> of<00:00:37.620> a

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
really nice the wiring was a bit of a

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.330 
really nice the wiring was a bit of a
pain<00:00:37.800> in<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:37.950> ass<00:00:38.100> but<00:00:38.820> other<00:00:39.420> than<00:00:39.690> that

everything<00:00:41.340> turned<00:00:41.579> out<00:00:41.700> good<00:00:42.530> first<00:00:43.530> and

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
everything turned out good first and

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.279 
everything turned out good first and
foremost<00:00:44.539> this<00:00:45.539> is<00:00:45.719> what<00:00:45.899> both<00:00:46.050> of<00:00:46.079> them

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
foremost this is what both of them

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.010 
foremost this is what both of them
looked<00:00:46.559> like<00:00:46.710> as<00:00:47.610> you<00:00:47.820> can<00:00:47.879> tell<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.450> LED

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
looked like as you can tell the LED

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.529 
looked like as you can tell the LED
brake<00:00:49.260> light<00:00:49.469> is<00:00:49.649> lit<00:00:50.399> up<00:00:50.460> for<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:50.969> running

light and the bottom tray has three blue
LEDs<00:00:55.860> which<00:00:56.100> illuminate<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.579> plate<00:00:56.760> when

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
LEDs which illuminate the plate when

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.389 
LEDs which illuminate the plate when
mounted<00:00:59.359> the<00:01:00.359> wiring<00:01:00.719> was<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:00.899> bit<00:01:01.140> off<00:01:01.370> well<00:01:02.370> I

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
mounted the wiring was a bit off well I

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.860 
mounted the wiring was a bit off well I
wouldn't<00:01:02.550> say<00:01:02.670> off<00:01:02.910> but<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.300> instructions

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
wouldn't say off but the instructions

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.730 
wouldn't say off but the instructions
were<00:01:03.930> fairly<00:01:04.260> poor<00:01:05.180> I<00:01:06.180> ended<00:01:06.869> up<00:01:07.020> doing<00:01:07.320> it<00:01:07.439> so

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
were fairly poor I ended up doing it so

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.530 
were fairly poor I ended up doing it so
you<00:01:08.310> know<00:01:08.400> just<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.760> little<00:01:09.060> bit<00:01:09.150> of<00:01:09.240> trial<00:01:09.420> and

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
you know just a little bit of trial and

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.219 
you know just a little bit of trial and

called probably orange I did use the

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.520 
called probably orange I did use the
factory<00:01:38.460> connectors<00:01:39.090> for<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.420> lighting<00:01:39.630> for

you<00:01:48.509> have<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.810> factory<00:01:49.229> connector<00:01:49.619> so<00:01:50.280> ended

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
you have the factory connector so ended

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.550 
you have the factory connector so ended
up<00:01:50.579> splicing<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.420> wiring<00:01:51.899> right<00:01:52.170> around<00:01:52.380> in
