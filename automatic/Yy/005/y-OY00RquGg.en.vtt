anything<00:05:08.770> or<00:05:09.040> no<00:05:09.160> no<00:05:09.490> we<00:05:09.640> let<00:05:09.820> it<00:05:09.940> do<00:05:10.150> we<00:05:10.270> need

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:10.419 
anything or no no we let it do we need

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:12.270 
anything or no no we let it do we need
it<00:05:10.540> for<00:05:10.720> the<00:05:10.870> soup<00:05:11.110> but<00:05:11.320> we<00:05:11.500> have<00:05:11.680> to<00:05:11.890> let<00:05:12.070> this

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:12.280 
it for the soup but we have to let this

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.350 
it for the soup but we have to let this
fry<00:05:12.610> for<00:05:12.669> a<00:05:12.970> little<00:05:13.270> bit<00:05:13.480> okay<00:05:13.930> and<00:05:14.520> wait<00:05:15.520> yes

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 
fry for a little bit okay and wait yes

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.780 
fry for a little bit okay and wait yes
the<00:05:16.840> reason<00:05:17.020> you<00:05:17.320> believe<00:05:17.860> the<00:05:18.130> carrot<00:05:18.550> for

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:18.790 
the reason you believe the carrot for

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:21.300 
the reason you believe the carrot for
later<00:05:19.060> is<00:05:19.360> because<00:05:19.900> it<00:05:20.260> doesn't<00:05:20.770> really<00:05:20.950> taste

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:21.310 
later is because it doesn't really taste

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:23.580 
later is because it doesn't really taste
good<00:05:21.460> when<00:05:21.820> you<00:05:21.970> fry<00:05:22.270> the<00:05:22.330> carrot<00:05:22.870> oh<00:05:22.990> it's

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:23.590 
good when you fry the carrot oh it's

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:29.040 
good when you fry the carrot oh it's
better<00:05:23.860> to<00:05:24.160> cook<00:05:24.400> it<00:05:24.610> so<00:05:25.590> this<00:05:26.590> is<00:05:26.860> doing<00:05:28.050> so

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.050
