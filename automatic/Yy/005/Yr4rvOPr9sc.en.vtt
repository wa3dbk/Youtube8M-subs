all those guys and really didn't do a

00:01:03.749 --> 00:01:05.539 
all those guys and really didn't do a
lot<00:01:03.869> in<00:01:04.049> Buffalo<00:01:04.500> we<00:01:04.619> had<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.799> kickoff<00:01:05.250> return

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549

legarrette<00:01:14.580> blount<00:01:14.730> was<00:01:14.910> great<00:01:15.270> at<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.480> end

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
legarrette blount was great at the end

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.540 
legarrette blount was great at the end
of<00:01:15.660> the<00:01:15.750> season<00:01:15.930> last<00:01:16.290> year<00:01:16.380> Ryan<00:01:17.040> Matthews<00:01:17.430> in

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:17.550 
of the season last year Ryan Matthews in

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.040 
of the season last year Ryan Matthews in
the<00:01:17.580> best<00:01:17.820> situation<00:01:17.970> though<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:18.690> I<00:01:18.720> think<00:01:18.780> he

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.050 
the best situation though and I think he

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:20.630 
the best situation though and I think he
might<00:01:19.140> be<00:01:19.260> the<00:01:19.380> best<00:01:19.530> back<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:20.040> all<00:01:20.190> those<00:01:20.370> guys

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
might be the best back of all those guys

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.850 
might be the best back of all those guys
