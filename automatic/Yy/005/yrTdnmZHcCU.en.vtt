what<00:00:01.110> we<00:00:01.230> see<00:00:01.410> here<00:00:01.650> is<00:00:01.860> an<00:00:02.159> example<00:00:02.669> of<00:00:02.909> how

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
what we see here is an example of how

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.090 
what we see here is an example of how
good<00:00:03.600> scouting<00:00:03.959> and<00:00:04.350> information<00:00:04.799> management

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
good scouting and information management

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.700 
good scouting and information management
can<00:00:05.370> allow<00:00:05.580> the<00:00:05.640> Overmind<00:00:06.089> agent<00:00:06.509> to<00:00:06.660> react<00:00:06.990> to

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
can allow the Overmind agent to react to

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.500 
can allow the Overmind agent to react to
what<00:00:07.890> the<00:00:07.919> enemy<00:00:08.250> is<00:00:08.280> doing<00:00:08.550> so<00:00:09.059> this<00:00:09.360> is<00:00:09.480> a

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
what the enemy is doing so this is a

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.240 
what the enemy is doing so this is a
replay<00:00:09.900> of<00:00:09.990> a<00:00:10.230> match<00:00:10.380> between<00:00:10.590> the<00:00:10.740> Overmind

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
replay of a match between the Overmind

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.240 
replay of a match between the Overmind
agent<00:00:11.550> playing<00:00:11.820> zerg<00:00:12.210> against<00:00:13.080> Skynet<00:00:13.769> which

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
agent playing zerg against Skynet which

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.369 
agent playing zerg against Skynet which
is<00:00:14.519> another<00:00:15.089> AI<00:00:15.299> agent<00:00:15.690> playing<00:00:15.929> Protoss

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
is another AI agent playing Protoss

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.170 
is another AI agent playing Protoss
these<00:00:16.680> are<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.250> orange<00:00:17.670> dots<00:00:17.910> on<00:00:18.090> the

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
these are the orange dots on the

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.300 
these are the orange dots on the
mini-map<00:00:18.390> Protoss<00:00:19.380> forces<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:19.859> brown<00:00:20.039> dots

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
mini-map Protoss forces the brown dots

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.790 
mini-map Protoss forces the brown dots
are<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:20.760> Overmind<00:00:21.060> Zerg<00:00:21.359> forces<00:00:21.810> now<00:00:22.529> if<00:00:22.710> I

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
are the Overmind Zerg forces now if I

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.480 
are the Overmind Zerg forces now if I
come<00:00:22.949> over<00:00:23.039> here<00:00:23.369> what<00:00:23.699> you<00:00:23.789> see<00:00:24.029> is<00:00:24.330> a<00:00:24.689> zerg

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:25.490 
come over here what you see is a zerg

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.060 
come over here what you see is a zerg
overlord<00:00:26.599> so<00:00:27.599> what<00:00:27.900> an<00:00:27.990> overlord<00:00:28.320> is<00:00:28.619> is<00:00:28.890> it's

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
overlord so what an overlord is is it's

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.519 
overlord so what an overlord is is it's
a<00:00:29.189> slow<00:00:29.550> aerial<00:00:29.939> unit<00:00:30.240> with<00:00:30.840> good<00:00:31.080> sight<00:00:31.289> range

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
a slow aerial unit with good sight range

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.410 
a slow aerial unit with good sight range
that<00:00:31.740> we<00:00:31.830> use<00:00:31.949> for<00:00:32.099> scouting<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:33.030> other<00:00:33.210> use

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
that we use for scouting the other use

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.790 
that we use for scouting the other use
of<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.630> Overlord<00:00:33.989> is<00:00:34.200> that<00:00:34.410> it<00:00:34.500> provides

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
of the Overlord is that it provides

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.430 
of the Overlord is that it provides
supply<00:00:35.340> supply<00:00:36.149> is<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.450> metric<00:00:36.870> that<00:00:36.899> limits

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
supply supply is a metric that limits

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.810 
supply supply is a metric that limits
how<00:00:37.680> many<00:00:37.829> Munich's<00:00:38.250> you<00:00:38.340> can<00:00:38.460> build<00:00:38.610> in<00:00:38.730> the

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
how many Munich's you can build in the

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.280 
how many Munich's you can build in the
game<00:00:39.000> so<00:00:39.149> if<00:00:39.239> you<00:00:39.329> lose<00:00:39.510> too<00:00:39.690> many<00:00:39.780> overlords

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
game so if you lose too many overlords

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.900 
game so if you lose too many overlords
you<00:00:40.379> can't<00:00:40.559> build<00:00:40.680> as<00:00:40.829> many<00:00:40.980> units<00:00:41.309> the

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
you can't build as many units the

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.400 
you can't build as many units the
important<00:00:42.270> thing<00:00:42.420> is<00:00:42.540> that<00:00:42.570> as<00:00:42.840> our<00:00:42.960> overlord

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
important thing is that as our overlord

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.250 
important thing is that as our overlord
comes<00:00:43.680> in<00:00:43.890> it<00:00:44.070> scouted<00:00:44.910> out<00:00:45.180> that<00:00:45.629> Skynet<00:00:46.170> is

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
comes in it scouted out that Skynet is

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.110 
comes in it scouted out that Skynet is
building<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:46.590> Stargate<00:00:47.010> Stargate<00:00:47.940> is<00:00:48.090> a

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
building a Stargate Stargate is a

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.930 
building a Stargate Stargate is a
Protoss<00:00:48.480> building<00:00:48.809> that<00:00:48.960> builds<00:00:49.320> air<00:00:49.500> units

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
Protoss building that builds air units

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.779 
Protoss building that builds air units
what<00:00:50.940> happens<00:00:51.210> now<00:00:51.449> is<00:00:52.070> that<00:00:53.070> when<00:00:53.430> I<00:00:53.460> go<00:00:53.640> back

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
what happens now is that when I go back

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.110 
what happens now is that when I go back
to<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.649> Overmind<00:00:55.649> space<00:00:55.980> it's<00:00:56.640> immediately

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
to the Overmind space it's immediately

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.849 
to the Overmind space it's immediately
started<00:00:57.510> production<00:00:57.750> on<00:00:58.140> an<00:00:58.500> evolution

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
started production on an evolution

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.920 
started production on an evolution
chamber<00:00:59.039> and<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.670> creep<00:00:59.850> colony<00:01:00.270> well<00:01:00.809> these

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
chamber and a creep colony well these

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.049 
chamber and a creep colony well these
allow<00:01:01.199> it<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.440> do<00:01:01.590> is<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:02.399> turn<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.910> creep

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
allow it to do is to turn the creep

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.700 
allow it to do is to turn the creep
colony<00:01:03.420> into<00:01:03.600> spore<00:01:03.960> colony<00:01:04.350> which<00:01:04.500> is<00:01:04.619> an

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
colony into spore colony which is an

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:05.929 
colony into spore colony which is an
anti-aircraft<00:01:05.100> defensive<00:01:05.670> turret

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
anti-aircraft defensive turret

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.020 
anti-aircraft defensive turret
essentially<00:01:06.390> so<00:01:07.140> if<00:01:08.070> I<00:01:08.159> hop<00:01:08.400> back<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:09.000> the

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
essentially so if I hop back to the

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.120 
essentially so if I hop back to the
Protoss<00:01:09.869> base<00:01:10.110> we'll<00:01:10.470> notice<00:01:10.770> that<00:01:10.920> it's

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
Protoss base we'll notice that it's

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.880 
Protoss base we'll notice that it's
building<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.820> Corsair<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.720> Corsair<00:01:13.380> is<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.560> fast

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
building a Corsair a Corsair is a fast

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.980 
building a Corsair a Corsair is a fast
anti-air<00:01:14.430> unit<00:01:14.760> that<00:01:15.210> in<00:01:15.420> this<00:01:15.570> case<00:01:15.780> would<00:01:15.960> be

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
anti-air unit that in this case would be

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.249 
anti-air unit that in this case would be
used<00:01:16.259> for<00:01:16.470> hunting<00:01:16.740> down<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:17.189> zerg<00:01:17.400> overlords

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
used for hunting down a zerg overlords

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:22.280 
used for hunting down a zerg overlords
but<00:01:19.259> an<00:01:19.799> interesting<00:01:20.549> thing<00:01:20.610> to<00:01:20.759> note<00:01:21.030> is<00:01:21.210> if<00:01:22.140> I

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
but an interesting thing to note is if I

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.030 
but an interesting thing to note is if I
turn<00:01:22.500> off<00:01:22.619> shared<00:01:22.860> vision<00:01:23.220> we<00:01:24.060> see<00:01:24.299> that<00:01:25.040> what

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
turn off shared vision we see that what

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.100 
turn off shared vision we see that what
the<00:01:26.460> Protoss<00:01:26.880> player<00:01:27.119> can<00:01:27.330> see<00:01:27.540> of<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.780> map<00:01:27.930> is

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
the Protoss player can see of the map is

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.929 
the Protoss player can see of the map is
actually<00:01:28.259> fairly<00:01:28.530> limited<00:01:29.009> so<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.700> orange

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
actually fairly limited so the orange

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.910 
actually fairly limited so the orange
dots<00:01:30.210> are<00:01:30.509> where<00:01:30.540> it's<00:01:30.900> units<00:01:31.200> are<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.650> the

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
dots are where it's units are and the

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.319 
dots are where it's units are and the
slightly<00:01:32.159> lighter<00:01:32.460> areas<00:01:32.820> around<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.119> orange

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
slightly lighter areas around the orange

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.910 
slightly lighter areas around the orange
dots<00:01:33.570> are<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:33.930> limits<00:01:34.200> of<00:01:34.290> its<00:01:34.380> vision<00:01:34.740> so<00:01:34.890> you

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
dots are the limits of its vision so you

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.920 
dots are the limits of its vision so you
can<00:01:35.159> see<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.579> rest<00:01:35.820> of<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.030> map<00:01:36.210> is<00:01:36.420> obscured

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
can see the rest of the map is obscured

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.760 
can see the rest of the map is obscured
except<00:01:37.350> for<00:01:37.500> where<00:01:37.740> it<00:01:38.070> has<00:01:38.520> units<00:01:39.650> because<00:01:40.650> of

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
except for where it has units because of

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.080 
except for where it has units because of
this<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:41.100> doesn't<00:01:41.400> actually<00:01:41.520> know<00:01:41.820> where<00:01:42.060> the

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
this it doesn't actually know where the

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
over mines overlords are and so it has

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.450 
over mines overlords are and so it has
to<00:01:44.640> send<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.030> Corsair<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:46.649> Overmind

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
to send the Corsair to the Overmind

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.100 
to send the Corsair to the Overmind

shared<00:01:53.369> vision<00:01:53.670> so<00:01:53.759> we<00:01:53.790> can<00:01:53.939> see<00:01:54.090> what's<00:01:54.270> going

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
shared vision so we can see what's going

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.870 
shared vision so we can see what's going
on<00:01:55.640> and<00:01:57.619> so<00:01:58.619> you<00:01:58.710> can<00:01:59.040> see<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.430> Corsair

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:00.700 
on and so you can see the Corsair

and successfully protect its overlords
and<00:02:34.950> you<00:02:35.370> noticed<00:02:35.670> as<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:35.819> overlords<00:02:36.239> come<00:02:36.390> in
