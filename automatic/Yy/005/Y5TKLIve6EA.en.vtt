00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.050 

and<00:00:49.960> that's<00:00:50.740> I'm<00:00:50.980> sure<00:00:51.220> not<00:00:51.400> what<00:00:51.610> exactly

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:52.060

and that's I'm sure not what exactly
what<00:00:52.180> you<00:00:52.270> want<00:00:52.480> to<00:00:52.570> learn<00:00:52.720> it<00:00:52.930> starts<00:00:53.410> with<00:00:53.890> a

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
what you want to learn it starts with a

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.440 
what you want to learn it starts with a
synth<00:00:54.400> introduction<00:00:54.970> so<00:00:55.150> you<00:00:55.210> could<00:00:55.420> just

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:55.450 
synth introduction so you could just

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:56.760 
synth introduction so you could just
play<00:00:55.840> those<00:00:56.020> chords<00:00:56.230> for<00:00:56.440> the<00:00:56.530> synth

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:56.770 
play those chords for the synth

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.010 
play those chords for the synth
introduction<00:00:57.280> before<00:00:57.730> the<00:00:58.150> instrumental

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.020 
introduction before the instrumental

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.290 
introduction before the instrumental
hook<00:00:59.230> comes<00:00:59.500> in<00:00:59.680> and<00:00:59.920> that's<00:01:00.670> going<00:01:00.880> to<00:01:00.940> go<00:01:01.090> as

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300 
hook comes in and that's going to go as

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:25.920 
hook comes in and that's going to go as
follows<00:01:24.270> putting<00:01:25.270> that<00:01:25.360> together<00:01:25.540> with<00:01:25.840> the

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
follows putting that together with the

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.330 
follows putting that together with the
left<00:01:26.200> hand<00:01:26.440> you<00:01:26.530> should<00:01:26.770> get<00:01:26.920> something<00:01:27.190> like

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.230 

and<00:01:54.050> then<00:01:54.740> the<00:01:54.920> vocal<00:01:55.340> line<00:01:55.370> when<00:01:55.700> it<00:01:55.790> comes<00:01:56.000> in

and then the vocal line when it comes in
repeats<00:01:56.900> one<00:01:57.440> loop<00:01:57.800> over<00:01:58.310> and<00:01:58.400> over<00:01:58.640> again<00:01:58.760> at

00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.150 
repeats one loop over and over again at
