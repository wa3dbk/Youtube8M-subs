00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
that you had to kinda like multi-tap

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.250 
that you had to kinda like multi-tap
pedals<00:00:40.500> to<00:00:40.820> engage<00:00:41.820> are<00:00:42.149> now<00:00:42.629> all<00:00:42.899> available

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
pedals to engage are now all available

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.190 
pedals to engage are now all available
within<00:00:43.739> here<00:00:44.070> so<00:00:44.309> we've<00:00:44.430> got<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.550> nice<00:00:44.730> simple

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.200 
within here so we've got a nice simple

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.709 
within here so we've got a nice simple
record<00:00:46.200> play<00:00:46.440> overdub<00:00:46.890> button<00:00:47.219> a<00:00:47.969> tempo

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
record play overdub button a tempo

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.369 
record play overdub button a tempo
button<00:00:49.079> and<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.649> Clear<00:00:49.950> button<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.489> also<00:00:51.420> loop

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
button and a Clear button and also loop

00:00:52.379 --> 00:01:16.680 
button and a Clear button and also loop
up<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:52.680> down<00:00:52.829> buttons<00:00:53.309> for<00:00:53.460> recording<00:00:53.910> them

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:16.690 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.690 

other<00:01:17.690> big<00:01:18.020> differences<00:01:18.590> are<00:01:18.800> its<00:01:19.190> stereo

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
other big differences are its stereo

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.960 
other big differences are its stereo
hence<00:01:20.210> the<00:01:20.450> name<00:01:20.860> it<00:01:21.860> also<00:01:22.070> has<00:01:22.250> a<00:01:22.280> microphone

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
hence the name it also has a microphone

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:24.670 
hence the name it also has a microphone
input<00:01:23.180> now<00:01:23.540> and<00:01:23.780> so<00:01:24.260> we're<00:01:24.380> going<00:01:24.470> to<00:01:24.530> see

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
input now and so we're going to see

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.200 
input now and so we're going to see
chapters<00:01:25.040> making<00:01:25.310> some<00:01:25.490> silly<00:01:25.700> noises<00:01:25.940> over

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
chapters making some silly noises over

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.480 
chapters making some silly noises over
is<00:01:26.360> loops<00:01:26.600> as<00:01:26.780> well<00:01:27.070> it's<00:01:28.070> got<00:01:28.190> the<00:01:28.280> same

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
is loops as well it's got the same

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.790 
is loops as well it's got the same
rhythm<00:01:29.300> section<00:01:30.080> that<00:01:30.380> the<00:01:30.500> German<00:01:31.450> solo<00:01:32.450> had

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:32.800 
rhythm section that the German solo had

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.499 
rhythm section that the German solo had
it's<00:01:33.800> got<00:01:33.950> a<00:01:33.979> nice<00:01:34.220> funky<00:01:34.820> new<00:01:35.000> function<00:01:35.479> here

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
it's got a nice funky new function here

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:38.290 
it's got a nice funky new function here
called<00:01:35.690> auto<00:01:36.200> record<00:01:36.920> which<00:01:37.400> means<00:01:37.430> rather

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:38.300 
called auto record which means rather

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.330 
called auto record which means rather

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
mention on the solo as well we're

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:31.180 
mention on the solo as well we're
obviously<00:04:30.230> mucking<00:04:30.740> around<00:04:30.830> with<00:04:31.010> an

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
obviously mucking around with an

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.520 
obviously mucking around with an
electric<00:04:31.640> guitar<00:04:31.730> setup<00:04:32.360> but<00:04:33.110> this<00:04:33.260> works

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
electric guitar setup but this works

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.040 
electric guitar setup but this works
just<00:04:34.040> as<00:04:34.280> well<00:04:34.310> maybe<00:04:35.000> arguably<00:04:35.419> even<00:04:35.780> better

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
just as well maybe arguably even better

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:37.870 
just as well maybe arguably even better
if<00:04:36.440> you're<00:04:36.800> just<00:04:36.950> using<00:04:37.130> an<00:04:37.340> acoustic<00:04:37.820> guitar

into<00:04:38.450> a<00:04:38.480> PA<00:04:38.750> I<00:04:39.169> would<00:04:39.560> say<00:04:39.680> I<00:04:39.710> think<00:04:40.070> is<00:04:40.430> what

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
into a PA I would say I think is what

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.250 
into a PA I would say I think is what
the<00:04:40.730> majority<00:04:40.880> of<00:04:41.240> people<00:04:41.510> we<00:04:41.600> use<00:04:41.780> this<00:04:41.960> for

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.260 
the majority of people we use this for

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.250 
the majority of people we use this for
yeah<00:04:42.740> so<00:04:43.480> what<00:04:44.480> we<00:04:44.570> might<00:04:44.690> actually<00:04:44.960> do<00:04:45.140> we've

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:45.260 
yeah so what we might actually do we've

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:46.480 
yeah so what we might actually do we've
got<00:04:45.290> an<00:04:45.470> acoustic<00:04:45.830> guitar<00:04:46.070> in<00:04:46.160> here<00:04:46.310> somewhere

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
got an acoustic guitar in here somewhere

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.820 
got an acoustic guitar in here somewhere
and<00:04:46.970> maybe<00:04:47.210> we<00:04:47.360> might<00:04:47.390> try<00:04:47.750> that<00:04:47.990> as<00:04:48.200> well

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
and maybe we might try that as well

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.700 
and maybe we might try that as well
