00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
whole line here let me try to like not

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:35.880 
whole line here let me try to like not
shake<00:01:27.850> too<00:01:28.119> much<00:01:28.380> but<00:01:32.640> so<00:01:33.640> then<00:01:34.560> there<00:01:35.560> are<00:01:35.709> all

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
shake too much but so then there are all

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.029 
shake too much but so then there are all
of<00:01:35.920> these<00:01:36.130> cards<00:01:36.610> here<00:01:37.030> and<00:01:37.679> there's<00:01:38.679> a<00:01:38.799> bunch

00:01:39.029 --> 00:01:39.039 
of these cards here and there's a bunch

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:43.649 
of these cards here and there's a bunch
of<00:01:39.219> them<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:41.110> it<00:01:41.590> just<00:01:41.829> kind<00:01:42.039> of<00:01:42.100> knows<00:01:42.659> which

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:43.659 
of them and it just kind of knows which

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:45.770 
of them and it just kind of knows which
cart<00:01:44.020> they're<00:01:44.319> supposed<00:01:44.679> to<00:01:44.799> be<00:01:45.039> on<00:01:45.219> roughly

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
cart they're supposed to be on roughly

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.120 
cart they're supposed to be on roughly
and<00:01:46.780> there's<00:01:46.989> a<00:01:47.079> line<00:01:47.380> on<00:01:47.409> the<00:01:48.069> floor<00:01:49.860> we<00:01:50.860> do

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
and there's a line on the floor we do

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.990 
and there's a line on the floor we do
not<00:01:51.340> cross<00:01:51.700> the<00:01:52.090> line<00:01:52.270> oh<00:01:53.729> and<00:01:54.729> then<00:01:55.200> we've<00:01:56.200> got

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
not cross the line oh and then we've got

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.819 
not cross the line oh and then we've got
smart<00:01:58.000> bins<00:01:58.239> that<00:01:59.200> move<00:01:59.409> up<00:01:59.590> and<00:01:59.739> down

00:01:59.819 --> 00:01:59.829 
smart bins that move up and down

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:04.649 
smart bins that move up and down
depending<00:02:00.520> on<00:02:01.060> how<00:02:01.270> much<00:02:01.420> is<00:02:01.750> in<00:02:01.929> them<00:02:03.659> moving

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659 
depending on how much is in them moving

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:07.709 
depending on how much is in them moving
smoothly<00:02:05.579> trying<00:02:06.579> to<00:02:06.670> minimize<00:02:07.030> the<00:02:07.270> shake<00:02:07.509> on

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:07.719 
smoothly trying to minimize the shake on

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:11.720 
smoothly trying to minimize the shake on
this<00:02:07.899> it's<00:02:08.170> really<00:02:08.410> hard<00:02:09.989> sure<00:02:10.989> no<00:02:11.200> problem

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
this it's really hard sure no problem

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.039 
this it's really hard sure no problem
I'm<00:02:12.730> in<00:02:12.910> the<00:02:13.000> way<00:02:13.090> of<00:02:13.239> people<00:02:13.540> trying<00:02:13.810> to<00:02:13.870> do

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:14.049 
I'm in the way of people trying to do

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:16.770 
I'm in the way of people trying to do
their<00:02:14.079> jobs<00:02:14.260> oh<00:02:14.829> wait

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
their jobs oh wait

their jobs oh wait
so<00:02:17.080> yeah<00:02:17.819> then<00:02:18.819> it<00:02:18.940> just<00:02:19.120> kind<00:02:19.300> of<00:02:19.890> keep<00:02:20.890> track

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
so yeah then it just kind of keep track

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.949 
so yeah then it just kind of keep track

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
the bins of Justin height because they

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.150 
the bins of Justin height because they
have<00:02:24.730> electronic<00:02:25.240> eyes<00:02:25.709> they<00:02:26.709> know<00:02:26.920> things

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
have electronic eyes they know things

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.580 
have electronic eyes they know things
giacomo<00:02:28.000> vagrancy<00:02:28.330> there<00:02:28.630> were<00:02:28.720> things<00:02:29.350> come
