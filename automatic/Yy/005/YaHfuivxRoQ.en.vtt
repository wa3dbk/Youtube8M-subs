so<00:00:05.339> what<00:00:05.549> is<00:00:05.700> a<00:00:05.730> slice<00:00:06.060> the<00:00:06.690> slice<00:00:06.960> is<00:00:07.200> kind<00:00:07.529> of

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
so what is a slice the slice is kind of

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.830 
so what is a slice the slice is kind of
the<00:00:07.799> direct<00:00:08.130> opposite<00:00:08.670> of<00:00:08.700> a<00:00:09.179> topspin<00:00:09.690> stroke

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
the direct opposite of a topspin stroke

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.440 
the direct opposite of a topspin stroke
if<00:00:10.440> topspin<00:00:11.099> the<00:00:11.160> ball<00:00:11.340> is<00:00:11.670> rolling<00:00:11.849> forward

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
if topspin the ball is rolling forward

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.320 
if topspin the ball is rolling forward
slice<00:00:13.110> the<00:00:13.500> ball<00:00:13.650> is<00:00:13.860> rolling<00:00:14.130> backwards<00:00:14.790> the

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
slice the ball is rolling backwards the

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.480 
slice the ball is rolling backwards the
advantage<00:00:15.870> of<00:00:16.049> slice<00:00:16.320> is<00:00:16.590> that<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:17.070> ball<00:00:17.250> can

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
advantage of slice is that the ball can

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.910 
advantage of slice is that the ball can
stay<00:00:17.789> low<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.720> disadvantage<00:00:19.439> is<00:00:19.560> it's<00:00:19.740> not<00:00:19.859> a

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
stay low the disadvantage is it's not a

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.019 
stay low the disadvantage is it's not a
power<00:00:20.310> stroke

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
power stroke

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.269 
power stroke

it's a high to low stroke as opposed to
the<00:00:31.289> topspin<00:00:31.769> which<00:00:31.980> is<00:00:32.160> low<00:00:32.579> to<00:00:32.640> high<00:00:32.969> so<00:00:33.329> when

you'll notice is open because I need to

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.880 
you'll notice is open because I need to

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
get that slice I won't be able to slice

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.770 
get that slice I won't be able to slice
if<00:00:56.160> I'm<00:00:56.340> hitting<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.760> ball<00:00:56.910> like<00:00:57.180> that<00:00:57.210> with

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
if I'm hitting the ball like that with

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.869 
if I'm hitting the ball like that with
the<00:00:57.899> face<00:00:58.109> closed<00:00:58.500> so<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.190> face<00:00:59.370> has<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.789> be

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
the face closed so the face has to be

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.970 
the face closed so the face has to be
opened<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.539> I<00:01:00.899> have<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.260> be<00:01:01.379> hitting<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.739> back

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
opened and I have to be hitting the back

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.640 
opened and I have to be hitting the back
of<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.280> ball<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.730> then<00:01:03.210> underneath<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.470> back

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
of the ball and then underneath the back

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.010 
of the ball and then underneath the back
of<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.920> ball<00:01:05.129> so<00:01:05.369> I<00:01:05.549> create<00:01:06.000> that<00:01:06.210> that

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
of the ball so I create that that

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.010 
of the ball so I create that that
backspin<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.280> ball<00:01:08.520> bounces<00:01:09.090> like<00:01:09.659> when

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
backspin and the ball bounces like when

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.230 
backspin and the ball bounces like when
you<00:01:10.140> throw<00:01:10.320> a<00:01:10.350> stone<00:01:10.470> on<00:01:11.070> a<00:01:11.100> pond<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:11.790> you<00:01:12.060> see

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
you throw a stone on a pond and you see

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.149 
you throw a stone on a pond and you see
it<00:01:12.330> skip<00:01:12.570> along<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:13.020> top<00:01:13.229> of<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.470> pond<00:01:13.710> that's

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
it skip along the top of the pond that's

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.770 
it skip along the top of the pond that's
the<00:01:14.430> way<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.700> ball<00:01:14.880> bounces<00:01:14.939> when<00:01:15.509> you<00:01:15.600> hit<00:01:15.750> a

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.179 
and high the ball goes slowly but it's
spinning<00:01:45.180> violently<00:01:45.630> it<00:01:46.229> bounces<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:46.979> can

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
spinning violently it bounces and can

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.370 
spinning violently it bounces and can
even<00:01:47.369> bounce<00:01:47.700> back<00:01:48.030> towards<00:01:48.479> you<00:01:48.689> because<00:01:49.229> the

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
even bounce back towards you because the

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.010 
even bounce back towards you because the
spin<00:01:49.619> is<00:01:49.770> spinning<00:01:50.700> towards<00:01:51.090> you<00:01:51.180> when<00:01:51.899> you

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
spin is spinning towards you when you

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.990 
spin is spinning towards you when you
first<00:01:52.290> start<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.619> hit<00:01:52.950> slices<00:01:53.430> if<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.729> ball<00:01:53.909> is

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
first start to hit slices if the ball is

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.030 
first start to hit slices if the ball is
going<00:01:54.329> too<00:01:54.509> high<00:01:54.720> you're<00:01:55.079> hitting<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.649> bottom

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
going too high you're hitting the bottom

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.730 
going too high you're hitting the bottom
of<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.310> ball<00:01:56.490> instead<00:01:57.270> of<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:58.170> back<00:01:58.409> of<00:01:58.619> the

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
of the ball instead of the back of the

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.069 
of the ball instead of the back of the
ball<00:01:58.920> so<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.189> hit<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.670> effective<00:02:00.119> slice<00:02:00.360> slice

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
ball so to hit the effective slice slice

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.050 
ball so to hit the effective slice slice
through<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.619> back<00:02:01.979> of<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.280> ball<00:02:02.430> and<00:02:02.610> that's

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
through the back of the ball and that's

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.200 
through the back of the ball and that's
the<00:02:03.299> basics<00:02:03.719> of<00:02:03.869> sliced
