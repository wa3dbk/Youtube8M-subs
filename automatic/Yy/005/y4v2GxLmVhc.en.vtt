00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.130 
doing it on my Galaxy s3 so you guys can
see<00:01:43.450> how<00:01:43.680> it's<00:01:44.680> much<00:01:44.890> tougher<00:01:45.330> not<00:01:46.330> easier<00:01:46.810> how

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
see how it's much tougher not easier how

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.719 
see how it's much tougher not easier how
to<00:01:47.200> take<00:01:47.560> off<00:01:47.770> so<00:01:48.550> that<00:01:48.790> wasn't<00:01:49.090> very<00:01:49.509> good<00:01:50.729> now

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
to take off so that wasn't very good now

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.830 
to take off so that wasn't very good now
my<00:01:52.570> galaxy<00:01:52.990> s3<00:01:53.380> case<00:01:54.100> there<00:01:54.940> I<00:01:54.970> must<00:01:55.509> see<00:01:55.780> if

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
my galaxy s3 case there I must see if

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.210 
my galaxy s3 case there I must see if
you<00:01:55.930> guys<00:01:56.050> can<00:01:56.259> see<00:01:56.409> multiple<00:01:56.830> difference

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
you guys can see multiple difference

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:58.859 
you guys can see multiple difference
that<00:01:57.400> there<00:01:57.610> is<00:01:57.700> a<00:01:57.729> gap<00:01:58.030> right<00:01:58.090> there<00:01:58.300> now<00:01:58.690> if<00:01:58.780> I

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 
that there is a gap right there now if I

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:00.660 
that there is a gap right there now if I
were<00:01:58.990> to<00:01:59.050> put<00:01:59.259> it<00:01:59.350> in<00:01:59.409> there<00:01:59.650> it<00:02:00.100> should<00:02:00.399> make

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
were to put it in there it should make

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.499 
were to put it in there it should make
it<00:02:00.850> less<00:02:01.890> yeah<00:02:02.890> so<00:02:03.880> this<00:02:04.000> time<00:02:04.180> I'm<00:02:04.330> going<00:02:04.450> to

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:04.509 
it less yeah so this time I'm going to

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:10.680 
it less yeah so this time I'm going to
put<00:02:04.720> the<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:09.039> bottom<00:02:09.429> the<00:02:10.209> back<00:02:10.420> of<00:02:10.570> it

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
put the the the bottom the back of it

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:19.910 
put the the the bottom the back of it
face<00:02:10.989> up<00:02:14.040> and<00:02:15.040> you<00:02:15.880> want<00:02:16.120> to<00:02:16.180> push<00:02:16.330> it<00:02:16.480> down

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.030 

flip<00:02:20.920> it<00:02:21.040> over<00:02:21.250> and<00:02:21.640> cut<00:02:22.269> the<00:02:22.420> ten<00:02:22.660> ten<00:02:23.080> nine

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
flip it over and cut the ten ten nine

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:30.600 
flip it over and cut the ten ten nine
eight<00:02:24.489> seven<00:02:26.760> five<00:02:27.760> four<00:02:28.630> three<00:02:29.280> two<00:02:30.280> one

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
long if the other one basically is going

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:57.430 
long if the other one basically is going
to<00:02:36.970> do<00:02:37.060> that

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.780 

we're<00:02:58.440> gonna<00:02:58.530> dry<00:02:58.800> this<00:02:59.010> off<00:02:59.220> and<00:02:59.489> show<00:02:59.550> you

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.729 
we're gonna dry this off and show you
guys<00:03:01.489> this<00:03:02.489> time<00:03:02.550> I<00:03:03.000> don't<00:03:03.810> think<00:03:04.050> I<00:03:04.319> put<00:03:04.500> it<00:03:04.620> in

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
guys this time I don't think I put it in

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:08.449 
guys this time I don't think I put it in
long<00:03:04.920> enough<00:03:04.950> so<00:03:06.620> 100%<00:03:07.620> sure<00:03:07.920> if<00:03:07.980> it'll<00:03:08.190> be<00:03:08.340> the

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
long enough so 100% sure if it'll be the

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:15.890 
long enough so 100% sure if it'll be the
same<00:03:12.140> army<00:03:13.140> large<00:03:13.319> percent<00:03:14.690> tighter<00:03:15.690> on<00:03:15.870> the

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
same army large percent tighter on the

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.150 
same army large percent tighter on the
edges

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:29.060 

so<00:03:20.790> now<00:03:21.590> actually<00:03:22.590> cleaned<00:03:23.160> it<00:03:23.280> too<00:03:23.570> bonus<00:03:28.070> if

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
so now actually cleaned it too bonus if

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.340 
so now actually cleaned it too bonus if
you<00:03:29.220> guys<00:03:29.340> can<00:03:29.580> see<00:03:29.790> it<00:03:30.060> got<00:03:30.600> noticeably

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
you guys can see it got noticeably

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.470 
you guys can see it got noticeably
tighter<00:03:31.680> yeah<00:03:32.580> you<00:03:32.640> guys<00:03:32.880> can't<00:03:33.180> really<00:03:33.330> see

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
tighter yeah you guys can't really see

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.700 
tighter yeah you guys can't really see
it<00:03:33.570> but<00:03:33.690> it<00:03:33.840> definitely<00:03:34.230> got<00:03:34.320> tight<00:03:34.590> around

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:34.710 
it but it definitely got tight around

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:38.810 
it but it definitely got tight around
the<00:03:34.890> edges<00:03:35.160> so<00:03:35.280> that's<00:03:35.430> really<00:03:35.700> good<00:03:36.680> and<00:03:37.820> also

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
the edges so that's really good and also

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.780 
the edges so that's really good and also
it<00:03:39.060> also<00:03:39.240> gets<00:03:39.950> tougher<00:03:40.950> when<00:03:41.400> you<00:03:41.520> go<00:03:41.670> from

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
it also gets tougher when you go from

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.390 
it also gets tougher when you go from
hot<00:03:42.330> to<00:03:42.540> cold<00:03:42.570> so<00:03:43.470> it<00:03:43.590> actually<00:03:43.770> makes<00:03:44.040> the

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
hot to cold so it actually makes the

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.240 
hot to cold so it actually makes the
silicone<00:03:45.360> part<00:03:45.630> tighter<00:03:46.080> so<00:03:46.710> you<00:03:46.800> guys<00:03:46.920> that
