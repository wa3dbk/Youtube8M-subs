00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:12.260
 Hello everyone at the microphone as always 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:15.199
 depreciation and if you hear it means in 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:17.119
 On air, another review from could it go 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:19.400
 today in our review 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:21.949
 the game of the film quite a while was not such 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.290
 isn't the movie itself either 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:26.480
 independent creation and shot by 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.970
 book and so is the instrument of death 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.370
 I must say that I did not watch the movie 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.440
 maybe even twilight heroes didn't look like 

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:35.690
 so snotly like these so my 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.820
 familiarity with the movie limited 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.050
 watching the trailer and yet 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.450
 a little about the plot 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.560
 in short, it is such a night watch 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.720
 American style 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.000
 that is, sort of like in the world around us there 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.690
 and demons and sorcerers and other rubbish but we 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.640
 we do not see them 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.100
 and invisible because there is also 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.530
 twilight hunters even here hint at 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.899
 twilight which is this whole bunch 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.270
 they are something like descendants of angels or 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:02.059
 something like that well, in short, too, not quite people 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.980
 Well, now she came to the game a little earlier 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:07.009
 the movie itself and a little more than completely 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:09.380
 is advertising they game in the menu you can 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:11.600
 watch the trailer and even buy a ticket 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.280
 I do not know whether this feature worked for us in 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.770
 anyway i don't want to cinema on 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.719
 next edward and bella also in the menu 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.240
 you can pump skills and character 

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:22.490
 such as health strength and so on and 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.069
 buy first aid kits that will not help 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.950
 die in battle and several more species 

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:30.709
 pozel of heroes by the way a little and it is possible 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:33.289
 choose according to your taste by clicking on play 

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:34.849
 get into the level selection menu which 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:37.069
 is a map on which 

00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:40.159
 locations open as you progress 

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:42.200
 the chain at the beginning of the level are present 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:46.219
 the dialogues that explain the curtains to us 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:48.170
 happens and then the fight itself begins 

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:50.329
 what is the gameplay 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.999
 we have some location in which 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:54.709
 spawning waves could could attacks 

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:56.749
 the hero must kill them 

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:59.179
 naturally from a wave to a wave of fashion 

00:01:56.749 --> 00:02:01.819
 it becomes more vylazyat any more 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:04.849
 strong creatures all management built 

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:06.950
 On tapas location is such a chess 

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:09.470
 board only instead of cells here are circles 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.540
 Tapaya in an empty circle you make 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.890
 hero run there so mug on 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.530
 which is already worth something 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.150
 means attack and that dumb to 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.370
 attack you have to tap them 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.010
 over the area under the feet of the enemy they are 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.409
 I constantly forgot about the monster 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.519
 this missed and ran into the crowd instead 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:27.650
 to attack 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:32.180
 abilities can also be used in combat 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:34.069
 and all this and limited gameplay from 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.319
 level to level you will need 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:38.840
 beat waves of mobs stomp on green 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:41.750
 mugs and run without letting yourself be surrounded 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.120
 and undress nothing else happens then 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.840
 let's follow this game is typical 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.269
 representative 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.670
 games by film and as independent 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:50.599
 the product is practically 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.970
 empty place 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:55.720
 monotonous gameplay as if hinting 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:58.129
 what was done in a very short time and 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.900
 there was no shorter time fantasizing 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:02.209
 speaking of just advertising a movie 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.609
 Well, maybe those who like movies 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:06.859
