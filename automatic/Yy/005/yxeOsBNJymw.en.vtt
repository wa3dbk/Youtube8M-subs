to iOS 5.1 from ios 5.1 so first program

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.820 
to iOS 5.1 from ios 5.1 so first program
you're<00:00:13.170> going<00:00:13.410> to<00:00:13.530> need<00:00:13.740> is<00:00:14.009> tiny<00:00:14.549> umbrella<00:00:15.830> go

you're going to need is tiny umbrella go
ahead<00:00:17.070> and<00:00:17.190> launch<00:00:17.400> that<00:00:20.689> so<00:00:21.689> as<00:00:21.779> you<00:00:21.810> see<00:00:22.080> i

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
ahead and launch that so as you see i

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:29.349 
ahead and launch that so as you see i
already<00:00:22.260> have<00:00:22.650> my<00:00:24.230> SHSH<00:00:25.230> blobs<00:00:25.260> saved<00:00:25.769> for<00:00:26.430> 5.1

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:29.359 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:31.790 

and<00:00:30.359> if<00:00:30.480> you<00:00:30.570> don't<00:00:30.810> you'll<00:00:31.080> need<00:00:31.320> to<00:00:31.529> save

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
and if you don't you'll need to save

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.750 
and if you don't you'll need to save
those<00:00:32.960> so<00:00:34.070> you're<00:00:35.070> also<00:00:35.219> going<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:35.640> need

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
those so you're also going to need

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:43.100 
those so you're also going to need
redsnow<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:37.190> click<00:00:38.190> on<00:00:38.340> extras<00:00:38.850> go<00:00:40.969> to<00:00:42.110> SHSH

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
redsnow and click on extras go to SHSH

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:49.069 
redsnow and click on extras go to SHSH
blobs<00:00:43.489> stitch<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:45.590> choose<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:47.039> stock<00:00:48.079> ipsw

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
blobs stitch and choose a stock ipsw

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.670 
blobs stitch and choose a stock ipsw
from<00:00:49.379> Apple<00:00:50.360> which<00:00:51.360> in<00:00:51.539> this<00:00:51.719> case<00:00:51.780> is<00:00:52.320> going

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
from Apple which in this case is going

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.760 
from Apple which in this case is going
to<00:00:52.800> be<00:00:53.600> iOS<00:00:54.600> 5.0<00:00:55.199> point<00:00:55.559> 1<00:00:57.379> so<00:00:58.379> now<00:00:58.530> let's

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
to be iOS 5.0 point 1 so now let's

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.590 
to be iOS 5.0 point 1 so now let's
verify<00:00:59.370> that<00:01:00.090> it's<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.320> correct<00:01:01.530> build<00:01:02.600> so

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
verify that it's the correct build so

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:11.170 
verify that it's the correct build so
now<00:01:03.750> it's<00:01:03.989> going<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.350> stitch<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.949> blob<00:01:05.790> to<00:01:06.330> it

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.700 

for<00:01:12.180> me<00:01:12.330> this<00:01:12.510> is<00:01:12.689> going<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:12.990> be<00:01:13.080> 5<00:01:13.320> point<00:01:13.619> 0

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
for me this is going to be 5 point 0

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:20.749 
for me this is going to be 5 point 0
point<00:01:13.950> 1<00:01:18.740> so<00:01:19.740> basically<00:01:20.250> it's<00:01:20.400> going<00:01:20.549> to

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
point 1 so basically it's going to

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.300 
point 1 so basically it's going to
stitch<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.570> bobs<00:01:21.869> so<00:01:22.619> it<00:01:22.799> actually<00:01:22.979> won't

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
stitch the bobs so it actually won't

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.499 
stitch the bobs so it actually won't
restore<00:01:23.790> with<00:01:24.000> Apple<00:01:25.009> or<00:01:26.009> if<00:01:26.220> it<00:01:26.369> does<00:01:26.700> then

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
restore with Apple or if it does then

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.649 
restore with Apple or if it does then
it's<00:01:27.840> going<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.080> trick<00:01:28.409> Apple<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:29.759> allowing

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
it's going to trick Apple to allowing

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.260 
it's going to trick Apple to allowing
you<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:31.140> restore<00:01:31.320> 54<00:01:32.159> no<00:01:32.310> point<00:01:32.549> one<00:01:32.729> back<00:01:32.939> on

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
you to restore 54 no point one back on

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.640 
you to restore 54 no point one back on
your<00:01:33.509> device

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:38.650 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:40.990 

so<00:01:39.580> now<00:01:39.790> it's

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
so now it's

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.750 
so now it's
is<00:01:41.270> created<00:01:42.020> the<00:01:42.080> ipsw<00:01:42.970> so<00:01:43.970> click<00:01:44.300> on<00:01:44.450> OK<00:01:45.760> go

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:46.760 
is created the ipsw so click on OK go

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.360 
is created the ipsw so click on OK go
back<00:01:47.030> once<00:01:47.360> and<00:01:47.750> I<00:01:48.500> need<00:01:48.740> to<00:01:48.860> put<00:01:49.010> your<00:01:49.130> device

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:49.370 
back once and I need to put your device

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.140 
back once and I need to put your device
into<00:01:49.550> pwned<00:01:49.970> DFU<00:01:50.570> now<00:01:51.500> my<00:01:51.860> devices<00:01:52.280> are<00:01:52.640> andf

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.150 
into pwned DFU now my devices are andf

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.540 
into pwned DFU now my devices are andf
you<00:01:53.470> so<00:01:54.470> it's<00:01:54.680> just<00:01:54.770> going<00:01:54.950> to<00:01:55.040> go<00:01:55.220> ahead<00:01:55.370> and

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:55.550 
you so it's just going to go ahead and

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.870 
you so it's just going to go ahead and
go<00:01:55.760> through<00:01:56.110> the<00:01:57.110> process<00:01:57.680> if<00:01:58.160> your<00:01:58.760> device

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
go through the process if your device

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.050 
go through the process if your device
isn't<00:01:59.270> in<00:01:59.600> dfu<00:02:00.260> then<00:02:00.650> redsnow<00:02:01.220> will<00:02:01.580> walk<00:02:01.850> you

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
isn't in dfu then redsnow will walk you

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.630 
isn't in dfu then redsnow will walk you
through<00:02:02.300> the<00:02:02.330> process<00:02:03.250> so<00:02:04.250> now<00:02:04.430> it<00:02:04.610> says

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
through the process so now it says

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.990 
through the process so now it says
that's<00:02:05.000> done<00:02:05.450> and<00:02:06.430> now<00:02:07.430> i'm<00:02:07.580> going<00:02:07.729> to<00:02:07.790> go

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
that's done and now i'm going to go

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.050 
that's done and now i'm going to go
ahead<00:02:08.030> and<00:02:08.450> launch<00:02:08.660> i-tunes<00:02:09.700> so<00:02:10.700> here<00:02:10.910> we<00:02:10.970> go

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060

i'm<00:02:12.050> going<00:02:12.320> to<00:02:12.440> use<00:02:12.620> option<00:02:13.120> restore<00:02:14.120> and<00:02:16.959> here

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
i'm going to use option restore and here

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:29.290 
i'm going to use option restore and here
is<00:02:18.260> my<00:02:18.830> custom<00:02:19.280> ipsw<00:02:19.870> click<00:02:20.870> on<00:02:21.020> open
