weapons<00:01:29.720> which<00:01:30.720> are<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.020> most<00:01:31.290> rare<00:01:31.650> that<00:01:31.950> you

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
weapons which are the most rare that you

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.679 
weapons which are the most rare that you
can<00:01:32.159> find<00:01:32.369> besides<00:01:32.729> pearl<00:01:33.030> scent<00:01:33.360> which<00:01:33.570> i

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
can find besides pearl scent which i

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.630 
can find besides pearl scent which i
think<00:01:33.750> is<00:01:34.020> in<00:01:34.170> one<00:01:34.290> of<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.439> expansions<00:01:34.920> so<00:01:35.549> we

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
think is in one of the expansions so we

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.960 
think is in one of the expansions so we
got<00:01:35.729> another<00:01:35.880> blue<00:01:36.210> one<00:01:36.390> there<00:01:36.600> so<00:01:37.850> here's<00:01:38.850> the

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
got another blue one there so here's the

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.060 
got another blue one there so here's the
third<00:01:39.299> crate<00:01:39.659> right<00:01:40.170> next<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.829> other<00:01:40.950> one

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
third crate right next to the other one

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.520 
third crate right next to the other one
which<00:01:41.490> is<00:01:42.060> pretty<00:01:42.360> convenient<00:01:42.869> just<00:01:43.380> ignore

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
which is pretty convenient just ignore

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.100 
which is pretty convenient just ignore
these<00:01:43.829> spider<00:01:44.700> things<00:01:45.240> or<00:01:45.540> they're<00:01:45.869> called

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
these spider things or they're called

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.530 
these spider things or they're called
there's<00:01:46.560> gonna<00:01:46.649> be<00:01:46.770> a<00:01:46.829> lot<00:01:46.950> of<00:01:47.009> them<00:01:47.540> yeah

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
there's gonna be a lot of them yeah

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.990 
there's gonna be a lot of them yeah
there's<00:01:49.140> another<00:01:49.439> gun<00:01:49.710> crepe<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.310> these<00:01:50.729> all

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
there's another gun crepe and these all

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.850 
there's another gun crepe and these all
can<00:01:51.210> generate<00:01:51.659> red<00:01:51.960> gun<00:01:52.170> crates<00:01:52.439> are<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.649> best

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
can generate red gun crates are the best

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.330 
can generate red gun crates are the best
so<00:01:53.720> they<00:01:54.720> all<00:01:54.930> can<00:01:55.170> generate<00:01:55.619> really<00:01:56.159> good

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
so they all can generate really good

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.240 
so they all can generate really good
weapons<00:01:57.350> and<00:01:58.350> here<00:01:58.710> we're<00:01:58.860> coming<00:01:59.100> to<00:01:59.219> the
