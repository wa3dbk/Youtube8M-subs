00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
screen for each direction so in my case

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.570 
screen for each direction so in my case
I<00:03:02.480> had<00:03:02.720> the<00:03:02.870> forward<00:03:03.200> Direction<00:03:03.650> lasting<00:03:04.220> 4

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
I had the forward Direction lasting 4

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.050 
I had the forward Direction lasting 4
seconds<00:03:05.090> I<00:03:05.270> can<00:03:05.990> set<00:03:06.350> that<00:03:06.380> anywhere<00:03:06.950> from

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
seconds I can set that anywhere from

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.699 
seconds I can set that anywhere from
what<00:03:08.060> says<00:03:08.330> normal<00:03:08.840> which<00:03:09.020> is<00:03:09.140> like<00:03:09.290> a<00:03:09.320> switch

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
what says normal which is like a switch

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:12.520 
what says normal which is like a switch
all<00:03:10.160> the<00:03:10.340> way<00:03:10.490> up<00:03:11.239> to<00:03:11.480> 30<00:03:11.660> seconds<00:03:12.230> which<00:03:12.350> would

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
all the way up to 30 seconds which would

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.920 
all the way up to 30 seconds which would
take<00:03:12.709> a<00:03:12.739> long<00:03:13.100> time<00:03:13.330> to<00:03:14.330> sequence<00:03:14.720> through

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
take a long time to sequence through

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:20.699 
take a long time to sequence through
there<00:03:15.140> so<00:03:15.610> it<00:03:16.610> will<00:03:16.760> go<00:03:16.940> back<00:03:17.180> to<00:03:17.480> 4<00:03:18.260> seconds

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
there so it will go back to 4 seconds

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.520 
there so it will go back to 4 seconds
and<00:03:21.790> then<00:03:22.790> also<00:03:22.970> remember<00:03:23.300> that<00:03:23.810> these<00:03:24.230> in

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
and then also remember that these in

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:25.960 
and then also remember that these in
this<00:03:24.860> direction<00:03:25.370> these<00:03:25.519> are<00:03:25.580> the<00:03:25.760> servo

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
this direction these are the servo

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.060 
moves immediately to that 75% point and
then<00:04:07.310> jumps<00:04:07.640> to<00:04:07.700> a<00:04:07.820> hundred<00:04:08.180> so<00:04:08.900> that<00:04:09.410> all<00:04:09.890> of

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.070 
then jumps to a hundred so that all of

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:11.860 
then jumps to a hundred so that all of
that<00:04:10.220> sequence<00:04:10.700> is<00:04:10.850> actually<00:04:11.000> built<00:04:11.510> into<00:04:11.690> the

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
that sequence is actually built into the

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:12.320 
that sequence is actually built into the
monitor

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:12.330 
monitor

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.320 
monitor
now<00:04:13.010> so<00:04:14.010> one<00:04:14.130> of<00:04:14.160> the<00:04:14.310> cool<00:04:14.520> things<00:04:14.820> you<00:04:14.910> can<00:04:15.000> do

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
now so one of the cool things you can do

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.960 
now so one of the cool things you can do
with<00:04:15.510> this<00:04:15.660> is<00:04:15.900> use<00:04:16.110> the<00:04:16.290> sequencer<00:04:16.830> as<00:04:17.010> to

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
with this is use the sequencer as to

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.170 
with this is use the sequencer as to
activate<00:04:18.450> a<00:04:18.480> mix<00:04:18.870> in<00:04:19.290> my<00:04:19.860> case<00:04:20.130> I<00:04:20.340> have<00:04:20.640> a<00:04:20.880> nose

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
activate a mix in my case I have a nose

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.480 
activate a mix in my case I have a nose
gear<00:04:21.360> steering<00:04:21.420> mix<00:04:22.140> set<00:04:22.650> up<00:04:22.800> to<00:04:23.010> my<00:04:23.160> rudder

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
gear steering mix set up to my rudder

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:28.100 
gear steering mix set up to my rudder
and<00:04:23.910> I<00:04:24.720> will<00:04:24.990> show<00:04:25.200> you<00:04:25.260> how<00:04:25.620> to<00:04:25.920> do<00:04:26.550> that<00:04:27.110> come

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
and I will show you how to do that come

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.040 
and I will show you how to do that come
in<00:04:28.260> here<00:04:28.470> to<00:04:28.620> my<00:04:28.770> mix<00:04:29.100> and<00:04:29.940> you<00:04:30.210> can<00:04:30.390> see<00:04:30.600> ox-3

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
in here to my mix and you can see ox-3

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.840 
in here to my mix and you can see ox-3
is<00:04:31.410> my<00:04:31.560> nose<00:04:31.740> gear<00:04:31.980> steering<00:04:32.040> mix<00:04:32.610> to<00:04:32.760> the

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
is my nose gear steering mix to the

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.600 
is my nose gear steering mix to the
rudder<00:04:33.060> just<00:04:33.870> come<00:04:34.020> down<00:04:34.200> here<00:04:34.230> to<00:04:34.440> switch<00:04:34.920> and

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
rudder just come down here to switch and

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:43.600 
rudder just come down here to switch and
turn<00:04:36.480> that<00:04:36.690> on<00:04:36.960> to<00:04:40.190> my<00:04:41.190> sequencer

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
turn that on to my sequencer

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.390 
turn that on to my sequencer
that's<00:04:44.610> 3a<00:04:45.290> and<00:04:46.290> you'll<00:04:46.620> notice<00:04:46.920> there's<00:04:47.130> five

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
that's 3a and you'll notice there's five

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.790 
that's 3a and you'll notice there's five
segments<00:04:47.940> of<00:04:48.060> time<00:04:48.090> and<00:04:48.570> as<00:04:48.900> that<00:04:49.230> sequence<00:04:49.650> is

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
segments of time and as that sequence is

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.760 
segments of time and as that sequence is
running<00:04:50.190> I<00:04:50.340> can<00:04:50.580> choose<00:04:51.320> where<00:04:52.320> I<00:04:52.350> want<00:04:52.470> the

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
running I can choose where I want the

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.320 
running I can choose where I want the
mix<00:04:52.950> to<00:04:53.100> be<00:04:53.130> active<00:04:53.580> when<00:04:53.760> I<00:04:53.820> put<00:04:54.060> the<00:04:54.150> gear

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
mix to be active when I put the gear

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:55.970 
mix to be active when I put the gear
down<00:04:54.360> I<00:04:54.570> only<00:04:54.840> want<00:04:55.110> it<00:04:55.170> active<00:04:55.530> at<00:04:55.620> the<00:04:55.770> very

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:55.980 
down I only want it active at the very

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:58.520 
down I only want it active at the very
end<00:04:56.220> so<00:04:56.430> I'm<00:04:56.520> going<00:04:56.700> to<00:04:56.760> turn<00:04:56.910> one<00:04:57.270> off<00:04:57.570> so<00:04:58.410> now

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
end so I'm going to turn one off so now

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.320 
end so I'm going to turn one off so now
you<00:04:58.590> can<00:04:58.770> see<00:04:58.950> in<00:04:59.040> this<00:04:59.160> position<00:04:59.430> my<00:04:59.940> mix<00:05:00.180> is

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
you can see in this position my mix is

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.770 
you can see in this position my mix is
running<00:05:00.690> aux<00:05:01.590> 3<00:05:01.890> is<00:05:02.010> moving<00:05:02.370> over<00:05:02.520> here<00:05:02.820> and

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 
running aux 3 is moving over here and

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.480 
running aux 3 is moving over here and
when<00:05:04.050> I<00:05:04.080> put<00:05:04.320> the<00:05:04.440> gear<00:05:04.710> up<00:05:04.890> and<00:05:05.040> this<00:05:05.190> moves

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
when I put the gear up and this moves

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:09.320 
when I put the gear up and this moves
off<00:05:05.670> of<00:05:05.820> it<00:05:06.000> the<00:05:06.420> mix<00:05:06.690> stops<00:05:07.580> so<00:05:08.580> you<00:05:08.850> can<00:05:09.120> play

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
off of it the mix stops so you can play

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.110 
off of it the mix stops so you can play
with<00:05:09.540> the<00:05:09.660> amount<00:05:09.960> of<00:05:10.020> time<00:05:10.290> that<00:05:10.800> it<00:05:11.550> takes<00:05:11.730> to

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
with the amount of time that it takes to

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.300 
with the amount of time that it takes to
transition<00:05:12.690> to<00:05:12.720> this<00:05:12.930> by<00:05:13.230> adjusting<00:05:13.770> the

and you'll notice we're driving two
channels<00:06:04.560> a<00:06:04.950> is<00:06:05.910> the<00:06:06.330> doors<00:06:06.630> and<00:06:06.990> B<00:06:07.590> is<00:06:07.860> the

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:08.220 
channels a is the doors and B is the

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.490 
channels a is the doors and B is the
wheels<00:06:08.450> and<00:06:09.450> we<00:06:09.600> need<00:06:09.780> to<00:06:09.900> go<00:06:10.050> in<00:06:10.200> there<00:06:10.380> and

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:10.500 
wheels and we need to go in there and

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.880 
wheels and we need to go in there and
tell<00:06:10.680> it<00:06:10.860> well<00:06:11.070> which<00:06:11.490> servo<00:06:12.180> is<00:06:12.419> on<00:06:12.660> doors<00:06:13.590> and

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:13.890 
tell it well which servo is on doors and

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:16.520 
tell it well which servo is on doors and
which<00:06:14.040> is<00:06:14.190> on<00:06:14.340> wheels<00:06:14.960> locks<00:06:15.960> one<00:06:16.230> will<00:06:16.410> be

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:16.530 
which is on wheels locks one will be

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:18.890 
which is on wheels locks one will be
doors<00:06:16.770> and<00:06:17.160> in<00:06:17.430> this<00:06:17.580> case<00:06:17.820> the<00:06:18.060> gear<00:06:18.419> will<00:06:18.870> be

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:18.900 
doors and in this case the gear will be

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:21.840 
doors and in this case the gear will be
for<00:06:19.440> the<00:06:19.530> wheels

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:21.850 

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:25.090 

what<00:06:22.850> you<00:06:22.970> see<00:06:23.150> on<00:06:23.300> this<00:06:23.450> page<00:06:23.510> are<00:06:24.140> the<00:06:24.200> two

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:25.100 
what you see on this page are the two

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.100 
what you see on this page are the two
channels<00:06:25.580> basically<00:06:26.150> one<00:06:26.390> for<00:06:26.600> the<00:06:26.690> door<00:06:26.870> and

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:27.110 
channels basically one for the door and

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:29.230 
channels basically one for the door and
one<00:06:27.680> for<00:06:27.890> the<00:06:27.950> wheels<00:06:28.160> and<00:06:28.460> one<00:06:28.640> on<00:06:28.760> top<00:06:28.970> of<00:06:29.150> the

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:29.240 
one for the wheels and one on top of the

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:32.710 
one for the wheels and one on top of the
other<00:06:29.390> each<00:06:29.990> box<00:06:30.560> represents<00:06:31.570> the<00:06:32.570> output

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:32.720 
other each box represents the output

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:36.010 
other each box represents the output
from<00:06:33.140> plus<00:06:33.440> 100%<00:06:34.040> to<00:06:34.670> minus<00:06:35.000> 100<00:06:35.450> percent<00:06:35.840> with

numbers zero through four on the top

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:44.050 
numbers zero through four on the top
those<00:06:41.930> are<00:06:41.960> basically<00:06:42.680> time<00:06:43.100> points<00:06:43.550> that<00:06:43.910> you

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:44.060 
those are basically time points that you

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:45.820 
those are basically time points that you
can<00:06:44.240> adjust<00:06:44.330> the<00:06:44.720> output<00:06:44.750> over<00:06:45.440> here<00:06:45.650> on<00:06:45.740> the

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:45.830 
can adjust the output over here on the
