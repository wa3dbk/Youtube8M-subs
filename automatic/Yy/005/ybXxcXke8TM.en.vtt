00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:41.290 
more idea that we have is a DIY laptop

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:42.780 
more idea that we have is a DIY laptop
case<00:04:41.590> and<00:04:41.830> you<00:04:42.220> might<00:04:42.340> have<00:04:42.460> seen<00:04:42.670> this

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:42.790 
case and you might have seen this

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:45.540 
case and you might have seen this
tutorial<00:04:43.270> that<00:04:43.420> I<00:04:43.450> did<00:04:43.690> in<00:04:43.870> the<00:04:43.990> summer<00:04:44.200> but<00:04:45.040> I

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
tutorial that I did in the summer but I

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.580 
tutorial that I did in the summer but I
also<00:04:45.700> made<00:04:46.090> a<00:04:46.120> new<00:04:46.390> one<00:04:46.600> for<00:04:47.170> a<00:04:47.230> certain

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
also made a new one for a certain

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:52.110 
also made a new one for a certain
someone<00:04:48.690> um<00:04:50.130> I'm<00:04:51.130> not<00:04:51.400> done<00:04:51.670> yet<00:04:51.700> we're<00:04:52.030> still

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 
someone um I'm not done yet we're still

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.640 
someone um I'm not done yet we're still
working<00:04:52.510> on<00:04:52.630> it

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
working on it

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.840 
working on it
so<00:04:54.250> this<00:04:54.400> would<00:04:54.550> be<00:04:54.670> like<00:04:54.700> a<00:04:54.820> guys<00:04:55.090> version<00:04:55.770> for

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850 
so this would be like a guys version for

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
so this would be like a guys version for
Christmas<00:04:57.850> present<00:04:58.270> and<00:04:58.360> instead<00:04:58.630> of<00:04:58.720> blue

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870 
Christmas present and instead of blue

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:01.740
