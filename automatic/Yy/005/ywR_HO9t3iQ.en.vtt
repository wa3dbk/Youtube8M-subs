what comes to small markets if you look

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.929 
what comes to small markets if you look
at<00:01:29.450> the<00:01:29.479> huge<00:01:30.409> markets<00:01:30.920> like<00:01:31.100> American<00:01:31.579> market

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:31.939 
at the huge markets like American market

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:34.899 
at the huge markets like American market
or<00:01:32.090> German<00:01:32.450> market<00:01:32.890> it's<00:01:33.890> so<00:01:34.220> split<00:01:34.670> and

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
or German market it's so split and

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:37.749 
or German market it's so split and
suddenly<00:01:35.750> those<00:01:36.350> huge<00:01:36.710> markets<00:01:37.159> are<00:01:37.369> started

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
suddenly those huge markets are started

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:39.700 
suddenly those huge markets are started
starting<00:01:38.210> to<00:01:38.329> behave<00:01:38.479> like<00:01:38.930> many<00:01:39.259> small

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
starting to behave like many small

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.179 
starting to behave like many small
markets<00:01:40.159> which<00:01:40.820> is<00:01:41.000> exactly<00:01:41.270> what<00:01:42.079> I<00:01:42.469> was

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
markets which is exactly what I was

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:45.730 
markets which is exactly what I was
doing<00:01:43.610> past<00:01:43.969> twenty<00:01:44.450> twenty<00:01:45.110> years<00:01:45.380> in<00:01:45.469> my

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
doing past twenty twenty years in my

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.130 
doing past twenty twenty years in my
small<00:01:46.009> country<00:01:46.460> in<00:01:46.490> small<00:01:46.790> markets<00:01:47.180> so<00:01:47.390> so<00:01:48.020> I

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
small country in small markets so so I

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.100 
small country in small markets so so I
think<00:01:48.619> this<00:01:48.979> that's<00:01:49.399> it's<00:01:50.000> getting<00:01:50.450> just<00:01:50.719> more

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
think this that's it's getting just more

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.370 
think this that's it's getting just more
natural<00:01:51.740> and<00:01:52.119> that's<00:01:53.119> it<00:01:53.329> it's<00:01:53.930> not<00:01:54.079> a<00:01:54.140> big

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
natural and that's it it's not a big

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.499 
natural and that's it it's not a big
surprise<00:01:54.530> for<00:01:54.799> me<00:01:55.130> I<00:01:55.310> think<00:01:55.430> there<00:01:56.240> can<00:01:56.450> be

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
surprise for me I think there can be

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:59.859 
surprise for me I think there can be
plenty<00:01:57.469> of<00:01:57.680> very<00:01:58.250> bad<00:01:58.579> independent<00:01:59.390> and<00:01:59.570> small

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
plenty of very bad independent and small

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:03.190 
plenty of very bad independent and small
agencies<00:02:00.469> and<00:02:00.799> very<00:02:01.299> successful<00:02:02.299> huge<00:02:02.899> ones

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
agencies and very successful huge ones

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.330 
agencies and very successful huge ones
so<00:02:03.860> I<00:02:03.890> think<00:02:04.490> this<00:02:04.880> is<00:02:05.060> not<00:02:05.240> a<00:02:05.270> criteria<00:02:06.039> if<00:02:07.039> you

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
so I think this is not a criteria if you

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.789 
so I think this is not a criteria if you
are<00:02:07.490> really<00:02:07.759> into<00:02:08.390> the<00:02:08.780> business<00:02:08.989> and<00:02:09.470> if<00:02:09.679> you

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:09.799 
are really into the business and if you

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:11.979 
are really into the business and if you
are<00:02:09.890> really<00:02:10.130> listening<00:02:10.759> what<00:02:11.630> to<00:02:11.810> what's

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:11.989 
are really listening what to what's

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:14.080 
are really listening what to what's
happening<00:02:12.140> in<00:02:12.650> society<00:02:12.950> and<00:02:13.549> trends<00:02:13.940> and

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
happening in society and trends and

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.750 
happening in society and trends and
