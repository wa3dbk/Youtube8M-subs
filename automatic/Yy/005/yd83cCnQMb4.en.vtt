00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.990
 Hello everyone if you are not aware 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:13.090
 intel companies together samsung and more 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.530
 a bunch of cellular operators to develop 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.499
 own operating system 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.480
 called kaizen NPP in Russia has 

00:00:17.499 --> 00:00:21.789
 there is one experimental apparatus with 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.439
 This OS and in this video we look at 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:26.499
 tayzen and a modified version 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:29.019
 galaxy s3 which is different from normal 

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:30.519
 the fact that they are square corners look from 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:33.610
 they usually but I would not say that 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:35.680
 uncomfortable this is a kind of symbiosis jess 2 and ds3 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.080
 but not about the device itself 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.780
 the fact that inside him tayson and with was 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.220
 presented two years ago for that 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.490
 time she has changed a lot 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:48.700
 version 2 2 version 30 is now available 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:49.930
 will be released in 2014 and so external 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.420
 view of the system can not be called 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.100
 beautiful he is very similar to the mixture 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.950
 samsung shell touchwiz 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.250
 user interface firefox os but the trick is 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:01.500
 what is important now in tyson development 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.479
 optimization and creation of new api 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.490
 design will do later though myself 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:08.950
 concept county recalls android and ios 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.399
 very much the same workers here 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.200
 tables 

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:13.299
 by the way smartly the device responds 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.130
 no glitches at all to remove 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:18.369
 third party application you need to click on 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.960
 the button on the top left is interesting to delete 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:21.909
 that now you can not move applications 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.189
 on the screen either i didn't understand how it is 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:26.259
 It is done here at the notification center 

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:28.479
 all the same but there is one chip 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:30.700
 there you can install widgets 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:32.829
 something like windows living tiles 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.959
 phone on the desktop is a bunch 

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:37.299
 standard applications only the most 

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:39.579
 main message calls calendar and 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:41.579
 so on all applications are working and already 

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:44.319
 doing their job well now 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.359
 support with many things already included 

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:48.369
 sort of annexing camera support also 

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:49.450
 there is and shoot it pretty well and 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:51.700
 Photo and video 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.979
 noteworthy is that tyson work on 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.109
 linux kernel and there is nothing android 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.969
 general all drivers initially from scratch 

00:01:56.109 --> 00:02:00.340
 written under a certain iron 

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:03.460
 and the system itself will work on a.r. 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.289
 x86 chips developers answering the question 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.869
 what is better android say that here 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:09.879
 there is no terrible java machine now 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:12.730
 tyson can work on phones and on 

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:15.340
 pc or laptops tablets are also expected 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.200
 the thing is multiplatform if 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.299
 talk about the system as a whole then design 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.700
 vaguely didn't like it here 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:23.379
 no one really tried it on himself 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.930
 the system works very fast 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:27.730
 its possibilities are still unknown, but 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.730
 gameplay already ported here a few 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:33.160
 games the most interesting is that it is closed 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.480
 the version works much better than the finished one 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.970
 version of firefox os 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.190
 what will stand for in the end I can't 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.049
 say i dont even guess what with 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.880
 will fight dinner formed 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:44.260
 the market as a big here 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.769
 the number of applications I also do not 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.989
 understandably 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:49.180
 definitely need some trick and 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:51.670
 Now I think she's not in the project. 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:54.129
 a lot of money still imported samsung 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.959
 Yes , and a bunch of mobile operators can 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:57.849
 be and come out of it something cool and 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:01.349
 I personally am for a healthy big competition 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:01.349
 that there was always a choice
