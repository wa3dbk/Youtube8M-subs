00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:48.830 
quite honestly they scared me so when I
came<00:02:47.459> across<00:02:47.730> a<00:02:47.849> mark<00:02:48.120> Byrne<00:02:48.299> website<00:02:48.720> I

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
came across a mark Byrne website I

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.660 
came across a mark Byrne website I
really<00:02:49.140> looked<00:02:49.440> into<00:02:49.650> how<00:02:50.099> they<00:02:50.310> put<00:02:50.519> these

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
really looked into how they put these

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.180 
really looked into how they put these
extensions<00:02:51.269> in<00:02:51.480> the<00:02:51.900> philosophy<00:02:52.260> and<00:02:52.860> also

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
extensions in the philosophy and also

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.729 
extensions in the philosophy and also
their<00:02:53.430> brand<00:02:53.790> values<00:02:54.360> and<00:02:55.200> that<00:02:55.590> really

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
their brand values and that really

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:56.990 
their brand values and that really
struck<00:02:55.980> a<00:02:56.010> chord<00:02:56.130> with<00:02:56.579> me

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
struck a chord with me

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.360 
struck a chord with me
this<00:02:57.209> wasn't<00:02:57.450> just<00:02:57.630> a<00:02:58.019> hair<00:02:58.590> extension<00:02:58.860> place

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370
