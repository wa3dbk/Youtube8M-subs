applications<00:01:13.170> for<00:01:13.920> hair<00:01:14.250> weaving<00:01:14.580> and

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
applications for hair weaving and

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.820 
applications for hair weaving and
extensions<00:01:15.299> are<00:01:15.509> done<00:01:17.180> there<00:01:18.180> is<00:01:18.799> you<00:01:19.799> know

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
extensions are done there is you know

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.920 
extensions are done there is you know
tons<00:01:20.250> of<00:01:20.400> techniques<00:01:20.759> out<00:01:20.909> there<00:01:20.970> new

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
tons of techniques out there new

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.480 
tons of techniques out there new
techniques<00:01:22.320> are<00:01:22.439> always<00:01:22.770> being<00:01:22.979> created

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
techniques are always being created

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.120 
techniques are always being created
because<00:01:24.000> style<00:01:24.330> is<00:01:24.509> kind<00:01:24.689> of<00:01:24.840> improve<00:01:25.229> on<00:01:25.470> the

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
because style is kind of improve on the

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.460 
because style is kind of improve on the
old<00:01:26.340> techniques<00:01:26.820> or<00:01:27.090> put<00:01:27.810> their<00:01:27.990> twist<00:01:28.259> on<00:01:28.439> it

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
old techniques or put their twist on it

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.980 
old techniques or put their twist on it
to<00:01:28.740> make<00:01:28.920> it<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.369> little<00:01:30.150> bit<00:01:30.329> easier<00:01:30.659> for<00:01:30.689> them

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
to make it a little bit easier for them

and also talk about some products and
tools<00:01:38.310> that<00:01:38.490> are<00:01:38.610> very<00:01:38.850> common<00:01:39.240> in<00:01:39.390> the

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
tools that are very common in the

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.370 
tools that are very common in the
weaving<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:41.009> extension<00:01:41.520> world<00:01:42.259> that<00:01:43.259> you

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
weaving and extension world that you

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.340 
weaving and extension world that you
will<00:01:43.560> probably<00:01:43.979> run<00:01:44.130> into<00:01:44.310> most<00:01:44.909> frequently

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
will probably run into most frequently

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.350 
will probably run into most frequently
also<00:01:46.350> on<00:01:46.439> talk<00:01:46.619> about<00:01:46.799> products<00:01:47.189> that<00:01:48.119> can<00:01:48.270> be

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
also on talk about products that can be

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.240 
also on talk about products that can be
used<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:48.720> keep<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.350> longevity<00:01:50.220> of<00:01:50.640> your<00:01:50.850> work

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
used to keep the longevity of your work

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.789 
used to keep the longevity of your work
we<00:01:53.250> bore<00:01:53.490> extensions<00:01:54.000> going<00:01:54.479> so<00:01:55.110> that<00:01:55.140> is<00:01:55.619> what

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
we bore extensions going so that is what
