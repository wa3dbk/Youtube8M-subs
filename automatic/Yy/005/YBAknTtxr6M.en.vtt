00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
again it's a very small map which is a

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.880 
again it's a very small map which is a
common<00:01:49.860> theme<00:01:50.070> in<00:01:50.549> all<00:01:51.030> of<00:01:51.180> my<00:01:51.329> favorite<00:01:51.689> maps

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
except for the last one oddly enough

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.389 
except for the last one oddly enough
it's<00:01:54.780> kind<00:01:54.990> of<00:01:55.020> a<00:01:55.110> ground<00:01:55.290> war<00:01:55.500> specific<00:01:55.979> map<00:01:56.159> I

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
think you guys might know what it is

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.870 
think you guys might know what it is
I've<00:01:58.110> made<00:01:58.380> some<00:01:58.590> I<00:01:58.770> made<00:01:59.130> quite<00:01:59.399> a<00:01:59.460> few<00:01:59.549> hints

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
I've made some I made quite a few hints

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.530 
I've made some I made quite a few hints
to<00:02:00.090> it<00:02:00.210> actually<00:02:00.740> so<00:02:01.740> if<00:02:01.829> you're<00:02:01.979> any<00:02:02.790> kind<00:02:03.149> of
