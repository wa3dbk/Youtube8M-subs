00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.650
 program dedicated to the labrador 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.019
 we will work hard and bad 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.119
 approved 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.609
 it is true that at the part of konami 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:11.170
 not the right to do what he wants he 

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:15.250
 must learn to walk on foot 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.990
 with his master and the ideal is from him 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.100
 learn to walk without leash 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:22.569
 small so I said it previously 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.990
 in his new number we're going 

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:28.479
 talk about the dear promises how your 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.280
 dog will he stand at the mayor there is 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:32.500
 first we see him learn to 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.590
 to walk to the kit because it's essential for 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:38.530
 its obedience obligations it's going 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:41.020
 walk at the foot of his to do this 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:44.349
 your dog can have if you walk 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:47.739
 on the side of the rice on the shoulder before 

00:01:44.349 --> 00:01:51.210
 right next to your knee take and 

00:01:47.739 --> 00:01:54.049
 market just listen to all 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.700
 come to feel comfortable on your national purchase 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:59.790
 here are all the ceo close your eyes 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.830
 look imagine is waiting for that 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.140
 my knee is coming to sydney paul for 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:07.049
 move on and you do that many times 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.539
 per day for your dog 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.100
 after a little optics to walk to 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.170
 foot of an overweight also let him of 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:17.750
 freedom a dog is not in prison 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.750
 on the contrary, he is on a walk 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:25.519
 in your dog goes to the bathroom two 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:29.340
 others stopped this site 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:31.860
 then that we see how we do 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.269
 to stop my dog â€‹â€‹since I confess 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.519
 there is a pedestrian crossing 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:38.470
 stop his dog make him sit down 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:42.410
 avoid all that the dog 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:47.750
 crosses the street without permission 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:50.370
 so why our dear it is 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.800
 automatically causes it to do all alone 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:56.430
 do not want to sit down 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.430
 you wait for the car 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:18.230
 a lot of cars but good on a 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:23.090
 little corner of grass 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:25.400
 I will be able to let go normally 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:31.400
 the padlock you need to come for 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:34.690
 turn is why I was a little 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.690
 to go everywhere 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.190
 go a little bit excited because 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.570
 it's normal 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.570
 I have just been detached 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.230
 m 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.500
 sir we arrived at the 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.910
 last step reminds him and yes because 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.930
 that the hour adores must be learned to 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:16.360
 to be recalled on a walk communicate 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:19.540
 everywhere and then my p I give you 

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:22.680
 my solution for a dog payment you 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:26.350
 put a little distance from the dog the distance 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:32.890
 but at home and you fall 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:35.880
 could go here I did rather a 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:35.880
 high cost 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:42.000
 it's a way to remind your dog 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:44.400
 here are ladies and gentlemen I hope that 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.889
