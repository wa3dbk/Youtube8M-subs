when you're going or uphill or climbing

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.889 
when you're going or uphill or climbing
as<00:00:57.390> you<00:00:57.600> can<00:00:57.750> see<00:00:58.340> when<00:00:59.340> you<00:00:59.550> are<00:00:59.820> at<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.180> at<00:01:00.750> a

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
as you can see when you are at a at a

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.329 
as you can see when you are at a at a
grade<00:01:01.260> or<00:01:01.289> angle<00:01:02.129> you<00:01:02.609> don't<00:01:02.910> necessarily

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
grade or angle you don't necessarily

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.359 
grade or angle you don't necessarily
step<00:01:05.339> on<00:01:05.670> that<00:01:06.060> grade<00:01:06.450> with<00:01:07.229> a<00:01:07.260> full<00:01:07.650> sole

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
step on that grade with a full sole

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.600 
step on that grade with a full sole
sometimes<00:01:09.150> you<00:01:09.270> step<00:01:10.140> on<00:01:10.290> it<00:01:10.409> right<00:01:11.010> here<00:01:11.400> the

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
sometimes you step on it right here the

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.750 
sometimes you step on it right here the
ball<00:01:11.850> of<00:01:12.030> your<00:01:12.299> feet<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.260> this<00:01:13.560> one<00:01:13.920> has<00:01:14.729> a

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
ball of your feet and this one has a

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.630 
ball of your feet and this one has a
special<00:01:15.270> material<00:01:15.799> tough<00:01:16.799> enough<00:01:17.159> that<00:01:17.490> it

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
special material tough enough that it

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.510 
special material tough enough that it
will<00:01:17.759> give<00:01:18.000> you<00:01:18.180> some<00:01:18.810> kind<00:01:18.990> of<00:01:19.140> leverage<00:01:19.520> so

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
will give you some kind of leverage so

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.700 
will give you some kind of leverage so
that's<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.909> key<00:01:21.150> word<00:01:21.420> here<00:01:21.720> leverage<00:01:22.470> what<00:01:22.680> I

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
that's a key word here leverage what I

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.910 
that's a key word here leverage what I
like<00:01:23.009> is<00:01:23.310> that<00:01:23.490> it<00:01:23.640> also<00:01:23.909> has<00:01:24.720> a<00:01:25.110> ten

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
like is that it also has a ten

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.800 
like is that it also has a ten
millimeter<00:01:26.159> differential<00:01:27.090> from<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.420> heel<00:01:27.780> to

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
millimeter differential from the heel to

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.270 
millimeter differential from the heel to
the<00:01:28.080> toe<00:01:28.409> now<00:01:29.130> for<00:01:29.640> all<00:01:29.820> of<00:01:30.000> us<00:01:30.150> who've<00:01:30.630> been

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
the toe now for all of us who've been

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.830 
the toe now for all of us who've been
trained<00:01:32.280> in<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.579> minimalist<00:01:33.180> way<00:01:33.450> of<00:01:33.630> running

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
trained in the minimalist way of running

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.530 
trained in the minimalist way of running
that's<00:01:34.259> that's<00:01:35.390> blasphemy

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
that's that's blasphemy

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
okay so you're looking for a zero drop

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.910 
okay so you're looking for a zero drop
but<00:01:38.579> when<00:01:39.119> your<00:01:39.270> ultra<00:01:39.659> hiking<00:01:40.259> if<00:01:40.409> your<00:01:40.560> ultra

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
latter stages when fatigue sets in is

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.429 
latter stages when fatigue sets in is
that<00:01:47.340> extra<00:01:47.880> leverage<00:01:48.090> when<00:01:48.720> you<00:01:48.750> start

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
that extra leverage when you start

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.050 
that extra leverage when you start
climbing<00:01:50.270> and<00:01:51.270> especially<00:01:51.990> when<00:01:52.920> you<00:01:53.670> get

lazy<00:01:54.530> careless<00:01:55.530> this<00:01:56.189> extra<00:01:56.969> set<00:01:57.780> of<00:01:57.810> 10

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
lazy careless this extra set of 10

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.679 
lazy careless this extra set of 10
millimeters<00:01:58.979> will<00:01:59.610> definitely<00:02:00.210> help<00:02:00.540> you

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
millimeters will definitely help you

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.100 
millimeters will definitely help you
push<00:02:01.439> off<00:02:01.740> from<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.579> hill<00:02:02.820> when<00:02:03.390> you<00:02:03.509> climb<00:02:03.810> up

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
push off from the hill when you climb up

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.850 
push off from the hill when you climb up
steep<00:02:04.799> inclines<00:02:05.460> so<00:02:06.329> the<00:02:06.750> rest<00:02:07.020> are<00:02:07.320> I<00:02:07.680> would

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
steep inclines so the rest are I would

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.720 
steep inclines so the rest are I would
say<00:02:07.890> pretty<00:02:08.819> much<00:02:09.830> normal<00:02:10.830> for<00:02:11.250> any<00:02:11.459> kind<00:02:11.640> of

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
say pretty much normal for any kind of

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:12.759 
say pretty much normal for any kind of
shoe

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:12.769 
shoe

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:17.059 
shoe
what<00:02:13.769> they<00:02:13.950> also<00:02:14.159> adopted<00:02:14.489> is<00:02:15.030> that<00:02:15.989> they<00:02:16.620> fuse

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
what they also adopted is that they fuse

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.490 
what they also adopted is that they fuse
the<00:02:17.340> robber<00:02:17.579> here<00:02:18.150> on<00:02:18.360> the<00:02:19.700> front<00:02:20.700> side<00:02:21.030> and

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
the robber here on the front side and

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.280 
the robber here on the front side and
similar<00:02:22.500> to<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:22.769> Salomon<00:02:23.340> s<00:02:23.640> lab<00:02:24.090> I<00:02:24.810> think

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
similar to the Salomon s lab I think

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.160 
similar to the Salomon s lab I think
that's<00:02:25.590> the<00:02:25.680> axis<00:02:26.040> fix<00:02:26.370> off<00:02:26.610> ground<00:02:27.110> so<00:02:28.110> you

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
that's the axis fix off ground so you

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.920 
that's the axis fix off ground so you
can<00:02:28.409> see<00:02:28.620> that<00:02:28.860> it<00:02:29.010> takes<00:02:29.220> a<00:02:29.730> lot<00:02:30.150> of<00:02:30.209> effort<00:02:30.780> or

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
can see that it takes a lot of effort or

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.800 
can see that it takes a lot of effort or
a<00:02:30.959> lot<00:02:31.140> of<00:02:31.290> banging<00:02:31.769> for<00:02:32.340> this<00:02:32.549> to<00:02:32.730> come<00:02:32.879> off<00:02:33.120> so

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
a lot of banging for this to come off so

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.399 
a lot of banging for this to come off so
it's<00:02:33.959> very<00:02:34.170> nice<00:02:35.000> sealed<00:02:36.079> right<00:02:37.079> where<00:02:37.319> it

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:37.409 
it's very nice sealed right where it

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:39.680 
it's very nice sealed right where it
should<00:02:37.440> be<00:02:37.799> and<00:02:38.099> I<00:02:38.579> hope<00:02:38.730> it<00:02:38.909> will<00:02:39.000> last<00:02:39.209> me<00:02:39.540> for

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
should be and I hope it will last me for

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.380 
should be and I hope it will last me for
a<00:02:39.720> long<00:02:39.870> long<00:02:40.140> time<00:02:40.440> so<00:02:41.159> I<00:02:41.400> might<00:02:41.640> take<00:02:41.879> this<00:02:42.060> to

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
a long long time so I might take this to

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.349 
a long long time so I might take this to
the<00:02:42.810> and<00:02:43.739> I<00:02:43.980> will<00:02:44.189> probably<00:02:44.670> take<00:02:44.909> this<00:02:45.060> to<00:02:45.209> the

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:45.359

recommend<00:02:51.720> it<00:02:51.840> now<00:02:52.019> compared<00:02:52.950> to<00:02:53.099> the<00:02:53.220> Salomon

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760
