your<00:01:46.259> hair<00:01:46.649> very<00:01:46.950> securely<00:01:47.840> so<00:01:48.840> it<00:01:49.020> limits<00:01:49.200> me

00:04:57.999 --> 00:04:58.009 
it a eight eight and a half just because

00:04:58.009 --> 00:04:59.800 
it a eight eight and a half just because
I'm<00:04:58.160> not<00:04:58.310> that<00:04:58.460> comfortable<00:04:58.639> using<00:04:59.180> it

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 
I'm not that comfortable using it

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:02.290 
I'm not that comfortable using it
considering<00:05:00.770> this<00:05:01.069> is<00:05:01.280> probably<00:05:01.699> only<00:05:01.970> my

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
considering this is probably only my

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.450 
considering this is probably only my
third<00:05:03.080> or<00:05:03.380> fourth<00:05:03.590> time<00:05:03.680> doing<00:05:04.130> it<00:05:04.159> on<00:05:04.280> myself

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.460 
third or fourth time doing it on myself

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.089 
third or fourth time doing it on myself
I<00:05:05.060> do<00:05:05.960> admit<00:05:06.080> though<00:05:06.440> what<00:05:06.590> I'm<00:05:06.680> doing<00:05:06.949> out<00:05:07.069> of

00:05:07.089 --> 00:05:07.099 
I do admit though what I'm doing out of

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:09.629 
I do admit though what I'm doing out of
the<00:05:07.280> person<00:05:07.849> it'll<00:05:08.270> turn<00:05:08.479> out<00:05:08.599> a<00:05:08.659> lot<00:05:08.840> better

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:09.639 
the person it'll turn out a lot better

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:13.180 
the person it'll turn out a lot better
but<00:05:10.639> yeah<00:05:11.599> just<00:05:12.080> I<00:05:12.349> guess<00:05:12.740> it<00:05:12.889> just<00:05:12.919> needs

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.190 
but yeah just I guess it just needs

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:14.680 
but yeah just I guess it just needs
practice<00:05:13.370> but<00:05:13.849> I<00:05:13.909> really<00:05:14.210> wants<00:05:14.389> to<00:05:14.479> interview
