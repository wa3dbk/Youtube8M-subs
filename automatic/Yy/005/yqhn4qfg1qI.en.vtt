00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
maybe you're going to see a few days

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.650 
maybe you're going to see a few days
where<00:03:01.739> I<00:03:01.769> don't<00:03:02.040> have<00:03:02.220> a<00:03:02.250> video<00:03:02.640> up<00:03:02.880> and<00:03:03.090> the

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
where I don't have a video up and the

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.449 
where I don't have a video up and the
reason<00:03:04.260> for<00:03:04.290> that<00:03:04.470> is<00:03:04.739> going<00:03:04.890> to<00:03:04.950> be<00:03:05.100> that<00:03:05.310> I'm

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
reason for that is going to be that I'm

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.370 
reason for that is going to be that I'm
not<00:03:05.640> going<00:03:05.819> to<00:03:05.910> rush<00:03:06.120> a<00:03:06.360> video<00:03:06.660> out<00:03:06.720> unless<00:03:07.080> I
