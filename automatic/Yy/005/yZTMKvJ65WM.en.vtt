00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:42.580

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:46.030
 telling them what it is about and how it is 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:51.570
 good to start him 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:51.570
 this is for the new version the 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.420
 22.25 I think if I'm not wrong and then 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:01.480
 well we have worked tightening the 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:05.320
 letter e here we have that all all 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:07.000
 all all the items or everything 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.820
 everything we can use in minecraft 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.229
 in other words and good also this 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.750
 Minecraft version will manufacture the 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:16.210
 things that I'm seeing in those 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:19.000
 we have all the items we can put the 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.070
 creative way to turn it off or we can from 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.270
 survival by the creative mode do that 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:27.290
 rain and make it dawn 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.240
 noon 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:34.860
 darken and this is done at night and that 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:37.020
 be completely at night for being by 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.880
 what I have seen this is a new son 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.550
 which is to put on difficult difficulty 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.980
 to change the good difficulty is 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.350
 very good and good can also have it 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:49.560
 installed and for example put yourself in your 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.920
 'rival' and deactivate it with the letter oy 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.140
 well that's what the mod is now 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.150
 we went to see the installation and then nothing 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.190
 we'll see you ok ok we 're here in 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:02.230
 the good installation first we have to 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:04.480
 to do is open our minecraft 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:05.890
 well this happens to me because I do not have 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.200
 the purchased version I have the version 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:11.350
 good piratilla here we have to give in 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.450
 fort hood eight if we were going to give him interest 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.010
 game and if you have many installed 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.600
 previously because with that you are going to 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.020
 erase so before they do this 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:22.810
 this one put your folder for example and here 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:25.360
 recover this I have recovered the one that 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.100
 is the in fact the series that I have and 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.020
 well let's wait for it to be done 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.890
 this and I'm going to cut here 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:37.210
 ok here it's over it's just finished 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:40.510
 to do the update and good as you see here 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:43.120
 is the version already this 1.2 points 51 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.890
 Well, that 's to start now, let's go 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.100
 close the minecraft and what we have to 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:51.340
 to do is go to the beginning and here we put 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:54.100
 percent app data percent and here 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.140
 we have the roaming folder we open it and 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:03:00.010
 you see here is the folder point greater than 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:02.050
 we are going to use and well this yes they have 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:05.440
 the windows xp what they have to do is 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:08.980
 put windows + r to open the 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:12.070
 commands and we put here asterisk app 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:14.830
 data percent percent forgiveness a bp 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.810
 data percent accept and well here is 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.910
 the same but if you have windows 7 then 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:22.000
 here it's easier now let's open 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:25.590
 minecraft let's open bin to minecraft 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.599
 we give you the right click to open with winrar 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.879
 and then here is where we are going to 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:32.700

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:35.840

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.610
 I forgot I'm sorry to see we're going to 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:46.010

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:48.530

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:03.030
 we copy all we selected all and 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:06.449
 we pass them to the folder and we can 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:07.650
 accept and that would be everything and then 

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:09.780
