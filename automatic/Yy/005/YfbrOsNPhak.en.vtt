 600h is the fastest on the primus line ever 

00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:21.719
 a year later, thank God, he finds a silent APA barely shipping his victory 

00:00:21.719 --> 00:00:24.319
 Europe's streets 

00:00:24.319 --> 00:00:28.739

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:33.339
 Combination of coach thinks China and electric motor is driven the 

00:00:33.339 --> 00:00:39.249
 combined system power of otto- and electric motor is 445 hp and should 

00:00:39.249 --> 00:00:43.149
 thanks to the tremendous torque the performance of a twelve-cylinder 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:46.510
 offer much lower consumption 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.560
 also the new flagship follows consistently the Lexus keeps the leash 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.230
 four sentences and to believe that behind so many will be the sedan 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.400
 so much power forward to throw away so much 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.110
 Gotha 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:22.430

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.960
 geared to the needs of drivers and passengers 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.520
 binding 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.670
 For the drive, Lexus particularly combines a 5-liter v8 engine 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.300
 powerful electric motors and a newly developed battery unit 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.689
 with large capacity 

00:02:09.689 --> 00:02:13.809

 For the power also several times around many benefits such as Toyota stability too 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:27.419
 The skin engineers developed a new marrying system 

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:32.680
 The continuously variable power transmission was also specially developed 

00:02:32.679 --> 00:02:35.519
 ensures a uniform power development 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:40.730
 thanks to the electric motors and intensive noise reduction Petri new noble body 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.760
 also one of the quietest vehicles ever 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.469
 perfect example of this aspiration
