example when we put the belt on you can

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.180 
example when we put the belt on you can
see<00:00:40.970> that<00:00:41.000> it<00:00:41.210> has<00:00:41.360> a<00:00:41.390> nice<00:00:41.650> short<00:00:42.650> strap<00:00:42.980> for

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
see that it has a nice short strap for

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.720 
see that it has a nice short strap for
quick<00:00:43.610> release<00:00:44.570> but<00:00:45.350> when<00:00:46.220> I<00:00:46.310> turn<00:00:46.520> to<00:00:46.640> the

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:46.730 
quick release but when I turn to the

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.030 
quick release but when I turn to the
side<00:00:46.910> here<00:00:47.240> it's<00:00:47.630> thinner<00:00:48.020> on<00:00:48.230> the<00:00:48.320> sides<00:00:48.560> so

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:49.040 
side here it's thinner on the sides so

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.310 
side here it's thinner on the sides so
that<00:00:49.190> when<00:00:49.310> I<00:00:49.340> come<00:00:49.580> down<00:00:49.610> into<00:00:49.910> my<00:00:50.120> squat<00:00:50.540> it

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
that when I come down into my squat it

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.530 
that when I come down into my squat it
doesn't<00:00:51.680> dig<00:00:51.860> into<00:00:52.010> my<00:00:52.190> hip<00:00:52.400> bones<00:00:52.610> or<00:00:53.180> my<00:00:53.330> ribs
