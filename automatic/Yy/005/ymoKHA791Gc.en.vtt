00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
know in the States we have preschool and

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.380 
know in the States we have preschool and
then<00:00:31.650> kindergarten<00:00:32.309> in<00:00:32.430> Germany<00:00:32.850> is<00:00:32.940> just<00:00:33.210> the

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
then kindergarten in Germany is just the

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.000 
then kindergarten in Germany is just the
same<00:00:33.570> thing<00:00:33.809> basically<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:34.500> they<00:00:34.649> do<00:00:34.710> it<00:00:34.920> for

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
same thing basically and they do it for

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.350 
same thing basically and they do it for
a<00:00:35.100> couple<00:00:35.130> years<00:00:35.520> for<00:00:35.850> that<00:00:36.030> it's<00:00:36.180> just

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
a couple years for that it's just

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.910 
a couple years for that it's just
daycare<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:36.930> after<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.440> couple<00:00:37.559> years<00:00:37.739> of

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
daycare and after a couple years of

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.650 
daycare and after a couple years of
kindergarten<00:00:38.640> they<00:00:38.850> then<00:00:39.120> go<00:00:39.390> into

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
kindergarten they then go into

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.630 
kindergarten they then go into
elementary<00:00:40.200> school<00:00:40.590> for<00:00:40.710> four<00:00:40.920> years<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.460> up

elementary school for four years and up
to<00:00:41.760> this<00:00:41.879> point<00:00:42.180> it's<00:00:42.390> really<00:00:42.420> not<00:00:42.750> that

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
to this point it's really not that

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.090 
to this point it's really not that
different<00:00:43.140> from<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.410> way<00:00:43.469> we<00:00:43.530> do<00:00:43.770> things<00:00:43.920> in

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
different from the way we do things in

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.450 
different from the way we do things in
the<00:00:44.219> States<00:00:44.489> but<00:00:45.239> then<00:00:45.480> is<00:00:45.980> when<00:00:46.980> it<00:00:47.070> gets<00:00:47.219> a

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
the States but then is when it gets a

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.920 
the States but then is when it gets a
little<00:00:47.730> bit<00:00:47.940> more<00:00:48.030> complicated<00:00:48.329> because<00:00:48.690> at

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
little bit more complicated because at

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.189 
little bit more complicated because at
the<00:00:49.020> end<00:00:49.170> of<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.379> fourth<00:00:49.620> grade<00:00:50.930> German<00:00:51.930> kids

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
the end of the fourth grade German kids

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.970 
the end of the fourth grade German kids
are<00:00:53.180> evaluated<00:00:54.180> based<00:00:54.930> upon<00:00:55.410> their<00:00:55.680> grades

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
are evaluated based upon their grades

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.639 
are evaluated based upon their grades
and<00:00:56.399> their<00:00:56.520> overall<00:00:57.000> performance<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.840> their

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
and their overall performance and their

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.010 
and their overall performance and their
perceived<00:00:59.100> intelligence<00:00:59.750> throughout<00:01:00.750> their

fourth<00:02:13.100> grade<00:02:13.190> which<00:02:13.550> i<00:02:13.820> think<00:02:14.420> is<00:02:14.570> a<00:02:14.600> little

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
fourth grade which i think is a little

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.200 
fourth grade which i think is a little
scary<00:02:15.380> I<00:02:15.470> like<00:02:15.890> that<00:02:16.190> they<00:02:16.340> separate<00:02:16.820> people

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.210 
scary I like that they separate people

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:19.930 
scary I like that they separate people
and<00:02:17.480> give<00:02:18.470> them<00:02:18.500> education<00:02:19.430> that<00:02:19.580> they<00:02:19.700> think

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
and give them education that they think

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.850 
and give them education that they think
better<00:02:20.270> fits<00:02:20.570> their<00:02:20.750> needs<00:02:20.780> which<00:02:21.350> we<00:02:21.470> do<00:02:21.590> not

better fits their needs which we do not

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.830 
better fits their needs which we do not
do<00:02:22.100> in<00:02:22.220> the<00:02:22.310> States<00:02:22.580> as<00:02:22.850> much<00:02:23.300> but<00:02:23.630> it<00:02:23.720> does

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
do in the States as much but it does

to me personally that a potentially big

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
that goes throughout the whole school

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.380 
that goes throughout the whole school
year<00:02:52.370> and<00:02:52.520> that's<00:02:52.700> something<00:02:52.910> I<00:02:53.060> really<00:02:53.240> like

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
year and that's something I really like

about<00:02:53.420> the<00:02:53.720> way<00:02:53.750> Germans<00:02:54.170> do<00:02:54.320> things<00:02:54.590> as<00:02:54.740> far

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
about the way Germans do things as far

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.160 
about the way Germans do things as far
as<00:02:54.950> schooling<00:02:55.280> goes<00:02:55.580> I<00:02:55.850> like<00:02:56.420> that<00:02:56.660> the<00:02:56.900> breaks

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
as schooling goes I like that the breaks

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:58.630 
as schooling goes I like that the breaks
are<00:02:57.380> spread<00:02:57.680> out<00:02:57.830> so<00:02:58.070> it<00:02:58.130> have<00:02:58.220> all<00:02:58.340> crammed

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
are spread out so it have all crammed

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.490 
are spread out so it have all crammed
into<00:02:58.850> one<00:02:58.940> so<00:02:59.630> you<00:02:59.720> can<00:02:59.840> take<00:02:59.990> miniature

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
into one so you can take miniature

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.350 
into one so you can take miniature
vacations<00:03:01.100> with<00:03:01.280> your<00:03:01.400> family<00:03:01.820> throughout

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
vacations with your family throughout

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.990 
vacations with your family throughout
the<00:03:02.540> year<00:03:02.780> instead<00:03:03.260> of<00:03:03.350> only<00:03:04.100> really<00:03:04.670> having

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
the year instead of only really having

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.240 
the year instead of only really having
two<00:03:05.540> options<00:03:06.020> Christmas<00:03:06.440> and<00:03:06.620> summer<00:03:06.800> Plus

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
two options Christmas and summer Plus

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.770 
two options Christmas and summer Plus
that<00:03:07.430> makes<00:03:07.580> it<00:03:07.700> easier<00:03:07.970> for<00:03:08.000> kids<00:03:08.300> to<00:03:08.420> retain

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
that makes it easier for kids to retain

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.540 
that makes it easier for kids to retain
information<00:03:09.470> over<00:03:09.680> the<00:03:09.770> summer<00:03:09.980> instead<00:03:10.489> of

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
information over the summer instead of

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.250 
information over the summer instead of
forgetting<00:03:11.060> everything<00:03:11.330> but<00:03:11.870> like<00:03:11.989> I<00:03:12.080> said

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
forgetting everything but like I said

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.800 
forgetting everything but like I said
there's<00:03:12.470> so<00:03:12.620> much<00:03:12.739> more<00:03:12.920> to<00:03:12.980> learn<00:03:13.160> about<00:03:13.810> the

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
there's so much more to learn about the

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.020 
there's so much more to learn about the
