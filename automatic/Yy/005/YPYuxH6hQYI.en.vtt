 we can involve beyond the plans that were delivered to you in each 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.109
 that contest of coria since we made we wanted to see the unit that 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:30.029
 had the experimental national school salcedo and at the same time could do it with 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.650
 some motivation and at the same time joy and how we could see that 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.059

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:43.409
 skill a talent and even when you could say why every student 

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:48.780

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.250
 internal choreography 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.450
 where they could compete for whom 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:14.479
 leite presentation of each course you could say the abc llc equity months 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:19.650
 also that you have him he could do it differently there were not six months 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:23.869
 I could say why it was such a simple thing we wanted to see that they are in 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:28.070
 could participate but what they did qualify as serious in the 

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:32.590
 coordination of day movements and estimated that he danced each of the 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.750
 students we wanted to get involved in the unit for it because when 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.450
 we won 2 to the diets of the student council we do not 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.400
 lion above all and I told him that if we get involved in the same line of 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.800
 thought we will be able to do it or be something cool and at the same time some fear and 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.250
 that was one of our first points that you can socialize and the 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.110
 time they will see many other points that we can do for the institution and if 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.930
 well fernando gualabisi president of the student council 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.170
 pointed out that the scheduled activities and campaign are met 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:04.830
 second structure 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.649
 obviously we have some doubts 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.239
 activities as it is said by the school since we are students already 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.750
 can say last year and we are going we want to leave school and not 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.870
 art and at the same time let the council this advance buy it the works that 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.370
 be spent on the message for the companies apple exercises currently is 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.760
 do 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.170
 as I have always said that in the pride aside because the pride 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.040
 of my cast never leads to anything but unity 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.189
 that we put into each of our activities
