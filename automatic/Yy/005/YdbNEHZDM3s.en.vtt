00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
as well so it's going to come as a bit

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:49.970 
as well so it's going to come as a bit
of<00:02:46.829> a<00:02:46.950> cost<00:02:47.129> not<00:02:47.579> having<00:02:47.970> a<00:02:48.980> neonicotinoid

so you rate which will commence in

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.250 
so you rate which will commence in
probably<00:02:55.140> about<00:02:55.349> ten<00:02:55.620> days<00:02:55.769> time<00:02:57.170> but<00:02:58.170> the

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
probably about ten days time but the

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.660 
probably about ten days time but the
rate<00:02:58.409> problems<00:02:58.829> well<00:02:59.010> it<00:02:59.129> was<00:02:59.250> quite<00:02:59.400> been

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
rate problems well it was quite been
