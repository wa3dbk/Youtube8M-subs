00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:07.170
 good evening people and warm 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:09.300
 welcome to a new video yes me 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:13.200
 I'm just extremely excited for you 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:16.170
 Look here are both really two pcs 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.910
 now next to each other and not only 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.230
 that the two stand each other I have 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:24.119
 I'll say a little too 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:27.380
 professional setup changed and 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:30.150
 I finally got a video light here 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.730
 yes what that is that is then in the 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.440
 description is definitely and me 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.610
 I totally believe in the walimex 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.170
 daylight 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:42.559
 that is already walimex daylight 250 and 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.250
 the setting of it 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.410
 That's why it's getting something 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.450
 professional pass off a 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.160
 bit more video light and i have 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.260
 not just one, but one 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.160
 second, the second, however, must be 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.140
 still build 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.109
 which is still here in the 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.449
 carton here and in the bag is still the 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.129
 rest and yes i would say 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.690
 so that I can then ever much 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.350
 more professional here my videos 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.090
 record and thus more light of course 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.500
 and yes I hope you see 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.600
 different times may very briefly the 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.760
 Light on and off here or off 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.290
 and make it worthwhile again 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.330
 and now we have to look like that 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.990
 Picture noise really increases significantly 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:25.049
 because now we are here at 24 db gain 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:29.340
 and with light we are at about 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:30.720
 twelve now at new between 9 and 12 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.060
 depending on where I'm standing right now 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.590
 and where I'm filming but so on 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.200
 every case much less 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:41.360
 This should be noise 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.360
 and yes, sit down like that 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:46.110
 Now here are both pc systems on 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.509
 there you see it lit and here 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:52.610
 Of course, that's obvious 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:56.750
 that is on and I have just 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:02:00.299
 this one test system so to mine 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:06.270
 Lawyer ears closed and there you see 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:09.060
 it that msi bios with the z 87 there 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.130
 currently seven 80g 540 gaming 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.680
 or do you see the cpu temperature 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.890
 bills 27 28 degrees 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.739
 and yes I'm setting up the pc right here 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.110
 that means I still have windows 8.1 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.160
 I would need to install a key here 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.620
 still have somewhere 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:29.099
 I got two pieces back then 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.019
 So two full version both about 450 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:33.120
 euro and now they exist 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:34.950
 maybe even for less in mine 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.700
 case I have the ebay classified ads 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:40.080
 gone so why am I so excited here now 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.959
 I'm not only here because of the video light 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.600
 or because of the rain of the softbox but 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:48.170
 easy moment I go here 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.750
 in addition to the pc apps ella 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.430
 I can unfortunately also here now 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.380
 inferior 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:58.680
 I can not really talk about the pc right now 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:01.920
 back because the dvi cable extremely scarce 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.989
 and yes , that's the first one 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.790
 monitor off when i use the second softbox 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:07.319
 have built up then comes even more 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.650
 light then you will no longer be a picture 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.780
 zoom 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.540
 and yes you see the fan already 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.430
 times the wiring that needs now 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:18.769
 not to complain about that is now 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:24.090
 here just because once 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:25.769
 provisionally, as the saying goes 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.769
 cpu cooler you do not hear that at all 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:31.500
 yes is the pcgh edition of hr 02 macho 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:33.660
 I've been a few months ago 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.019
 shown and about what I am now very much 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.680
 look 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:40.410
 now the test for gtx is coming soon 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:42.139
 750 de moment times the camera 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:47.000
 change hands here 

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:50.000
 and there you see that runs too 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 Indeed 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:04:00.490
 I already said that beforehand 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:04:02.410
 louder than expected, that's exactly what is coming 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:03.100
 So soon the fans are not here yet 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.069
 affiliated 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:07.660
 yes I may somehow end this is 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:09.690
 not necessary people you do not have to 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:12.160
 always afraid that if you have yours 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.840
 do not have the housing fan on then 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.260
 directly your pc somehow in flames 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.470
 rises 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.940
 that is not so out there now 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.310
 maybe 1 8 km in there or something 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.660
 but the main thing of the cpu fan 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.180
 connected that is the important 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:28.510
 and if you turn off the side panel here 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:30.520
 nothing can happen there that way 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:34.000
 It will soon be a few super great 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:36.669
 Tests will now be more this time 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.100
 Light should be better video quality 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:42.400
 that means the housing here I test 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:45.760
 also soon the aerocool gt s black 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:47.710
 edition really cool the housing still 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.310
 once very briefly here from above and from 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:51.820
 ahead 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:54.270
 Compared to print I imagine that 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:57.190
 video not a bit closer here 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:05:01.680
 so now you should do it all very well 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:05.470
 can still see a little bit down 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:09.040
 perfect so you can see it already 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:13.150
 really very different housing here 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:17.100
 once corsair 750 de and just that 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:19.180
 aerocool gt s black edition 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.860
 that just looks more like 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:24.370
 such a gaming enclosure and that is now 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:27.070
 my private pc well I just too 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:30.400
 for video editing use what and 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:33.070
 looks very simple that 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:37.419
 some like this fobbed which are 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:39.430
 yes more, for example , this fan keeps 

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:42.310
 holes or something that should somehow to 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:44.700
 Dare cars or I do not know what that 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:47.050
 at least for design should be 

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:49.840
 definitely looks a bit more 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:51.880
 so new gaming mouse is a real one 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:58.319
 klotz a bit bigger and 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:06:00.309
 wider than the 750 de and 

00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:03.580
 the prices are not even that far 

00:06:00.309 --> 00:06:05.860
 apart that corsair costs 57 d 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:09.789
 currently i mean i have it for 135 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:14.020
 seen and the aerocool about 120 125 

00:06:09.789 --> 00:06:15.370
 So relatively similar price range but 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:18.520
 I will then give you a test 

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:20.819
 to tell more exactly that and yes I would 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:22.870
 say that's it then for now 

00:06:20.819 --> 00:06:24.270
 just so you can see that I am here 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:28.499
 really hardworking 

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:30.819
 and yes, really record something 

00:06:28.499 --> 00:06:34.300
 So I'm really looking forward to huge 

00:06:30.819 --> 00:06:36.969
 on the test winner g tx 750i if I 

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:39.099
 the online job and also in the future 

00:06:36.969 --> 00:06:39.960
 It will be a hell of a lot to see here 

00:06:39.099 --> 00:06:41.589
 give 

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:44.229
 I get a few more things 

00:06:41.589 --> 00:06:47.009
 sent or rather said I have to 

00:06:44.229 --> 00:06:49.870
 order a few more things 

00:06:47.009 --> 00:06:53.110
 which I can test then I will too 

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:54.279
 for example, be quite still inquire whether 

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:56.139
 Maybe not the new housing 

00:06:54.279 --> 00:06:57.909
 I could test that , yes or you 

00:06:56.139 --> 00:07:00.580
 I have someone in the comments of the 

00:06:57.909 --> 00:07:01.539
 I promised that I would ask and 

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:03.669
 I will do that soon 

00:07:01.539 --> 00:07:05.620
 may not even be completely 

00:07:03.669 --> 00:07:08.520
 christmas fold but let's see 

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:11.169
 I also have to buy gifts okay 

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:13.509
 people that's it for a long time 

00:07:11.169 --> 00:07:15.520
 become as thought i wish you 

00:07:13.509 --> 00:07:17.949
 a super nice week maybe even 

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:19.689
 the last with you for me it is the 

00:07:17.949 --> 00:07:23.279
 last week where I have to work and yes 

00:07:19.689 --> 00:07:23.279
 then to the next people ciao
