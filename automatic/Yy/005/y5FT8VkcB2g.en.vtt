00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:30.859 

we<00:00:27.980> okay<00:00:28.980> just<00:00:29.310> a<00:00:29.430> quick<00:00:29.940> fix<00:00:30.150> on<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.539> open<00:00:30.750> G

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
we okay just a quick fix on the open G

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:38.890 
we okay just a quick fix on the open G
tuning

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:38.900 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.419 

you

00:00:41.419 --> 00:00:41.429 

00:00:41.429 --> 00:00:44.579 

and<00:00:42.429> now<00:00:43.239> we've<00:00:43.359> got<00:00:43.510> the<00:00:43.600> idea<00:00:43.719> of<00:00:44.050> offbeat's

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:44.589 
and now we've got the idea of offbeat's

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:57.420 
and now we've got the idea of offbeat's
long<00:00:44.829> beach<00:00:45.039> and<00:00:45.629> we're

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:57.430 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:03.090 

we're<00:00:58.240> going<00:00:58.420> to<00:00:58.480> use<00:00:58.750> that<00:00:59.710> droning<00:01:00.490> G<00:01:02.100> the

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
we're going to use that droning G the

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.420 
we're going to use that droning G the
upstroke<00:01:03.490> of<00:01:03.700> T<00:01:03.970> string<00:01:04.330> as<00:01:05.110> a<00:01:05.170> device<00:01:05.650> to<00:01:06.070> keep

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
upstroke of T string as a device to keep

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.500 
upstroke of T string as a device to keep
things<00:01:06.670> going<00:01:06.790> circular<00:01:07.570> and<00:01:07.750> while<00:01:08.590> we<00:01:09.510> build

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:10.510 
things going circular and while we build

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:12.630 
things going circular and while we build
up<00:01:10.750> this<00:01:10.960> phrase<00:01:11.290> one<00:01:11.560> note<00:01:11.740> at<00:01:11.890> a<00:01:11.980> time<00:01:12.010> so<00:01:12.520> I'm

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
up this phrase one note at a time so I'm

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.130 
up this phrase one note at a time so I'm
going<00:01:12.790> to<00:01:12.820> start<00:01:13.060> with<00:01:13.240> just<00:01:13.360> one<00:01:13.660> note<00:01:13.930> of<00:01:13.960> the

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
going to start with just one note of the

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:21.040 
going to start with just one note of the
phrase<00:01:14.410> but<00:01:15.100> we're<00:01:15.250> going<00:01:15.400> to<00:01:16.890> put<00:01:17.890> a<00:01:17.920> loop<00:01:18.190> it

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:21.050 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:26.780 

and<00:01:22.050> the<00:01:22.950> first<00:01:23.190> note<00:01:24.260> is<00:01:25.260> the<00:01:25.710> B<00:01:25.890> string<00:01:26.220> first

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
and the first note is the B string first

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.270 
and the first note is the B string first
fret<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.390> I<00:01:27.780> suggest<00:01:28.140> you<00:01:28.290> use<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.800> second

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
fret and I suggest you use the second

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.990 
fret and I suggest you use the second
finger<00:01:29.670> on<00:01:29.820> your<00:01:30.030> left<00:01:30.360> hand<00:01:30.810> here<00:01:32.000> because

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
finger on your left hand here because

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.740 
finger on your left hand here because
what<00:01:33.270> follows<00:01:34.610> is<00:01:36.230> it's<00:01:37.230> a<00:01:37.320> sliding<00:01:37.710> phrase

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
what follows is it's a sliding phrase

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.920 
what follows is it's a sliding phrase
and<00:01:39.750> I<00:01:40.410> play<00:01:40.680> that<00:01:40.920> phrase<00:01:41.450> with<00:01:42.450> two<00:01:42.660> fingers

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
and I play that phrase with two fingers

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.280 
and I play that phrase with two fingers
using<00:01:43.560> my<00:01:43.830> second<00:01:44.190> surgery

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
using my second surgery

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.090 
using my second surgery
there<00:01:47.190> if<00:01:47.880> you<00:01:48.300> got<00:01:48.480> fat<00:01:48.750> fingers<00:01:49.260> you<00:01:49.770> may

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
there if you got fat fingers you may

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.980 
there if you got fat fingers you may
want<00:01:50.730> to<00:01:50.790> have<00:01:50.910> you<00:01:51.420> may<00:01:51.570> have<00:01:51.690> different

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
want to have you may have different

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.570 
want to have you may have different
ideas<00:01:52.080> about<00:01:52.970> using<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.090> second<00:01:54.480> thing<00:01:54.660> of

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:55.580 
ideas about using the second thing of

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.670 
ideas about using the second thing of
this<00:01:56.580> first<00:01:56.940> note<00:01:57.210> but<00:01:57.450> for<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.230> time<00:01:58.440> being

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
this first note but for the time being

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.320 
this first note but for the time being
let's<00:01:58.920> just<00:01:59.010> say<00:01:59.310> we're<00:01:59.490> using<00:01:59.700> our<00:01:59.910> second

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
let's just say we're using our second

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:06.429 
let's just say we're using our second
finger<00:02:00.510> here<00:02:00.870> and<00:02:03.110> this<00:02:04.110> note<00:02:04.380> is<00:02:04.560> an<00:02:04.680> offbeat

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:06.439 
finger here and this note is an offbeat

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:08.770 
finger here and this note is an offbeat
there's<00:02:07.100> only<00:02:07.189> one<00:02:07.490> on<00:02:07.700> beat<00:02:08.000> notes<00:02:08.300> in<00:02:08.539> the

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
there's only one on beat notes in the

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.449 
there's only one on beat notes in the
signature<00:02:09.170> lick<00:02:09.440> and<00:02:09.679> it<00:02:09.800> falls<00:02:10.100> in<00:02:10.429> the

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
signature lick and it falls in the

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:12.340 
signature lick and it falls in the
second<00:02:10.940> bar<00:02:11.120> so<00:02:11.569> we're<00:02:11.780> looking<00:02:11.990> at<00:02:12.050> the<00:02:12.140> first

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
second bar so we're looking at the first

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.680 
second bar so we're looking at the first
buyer<00:02:12.650> and<00:02:13.100> they're<00:02:13.760> all<00:02:13.910> offbeat<00:02:14.480> notes<00:02:15.670> but

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
buyer and they're all offbeat notes but

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.610 
buyer and they're all offbeat notes but
this<00:02:17.690> first<00:02:18.020> note<00:02:19.209> is<00:02:20.620> theoretically

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
this first note is theoretically

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.020 
this first note is theoretically
speaking<00:02:21.770> it's<00:02:22.130> a<00:02:22.190> little<00:02:22.400> bit<00:02:22.520> complicated

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
speaking it's a little bit complicated

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.979 
speaking it's a little bit complicated
because<00:02:23.450> it<00:02:24.440> anticipates<00:02:25.280> the<00:02:25.430> first<00:02:25.700> beat<00:02:26.060> so

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
because it anticipates the first beat so

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:46.300 
because it anticipates the first beat so
it's<00:02:27.440> not<00:02:28.180> one<00:02:29.180> it's<00:02:43.989> so<00:02:44.989> if<00:02:45.739> we<00:02:45.890> keep<00:02:46.130> that

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
it's not one it's so if we keep that

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.699 
it's not one it's so if we keep that
that<00:02:46.640> going<00:02:46.940> in<00:02:47.150> a<00:02:47.239> circular<00:02:47.870> fashion<00:02:48.170> I'm

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
that going in a circular fashion I'm

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:51.370 
that going in a circular fashion I'm
using<00:02:49.040> my<00:02:49.760> index<00:02:50.209> finger<00:02:50.569> for<00:02:50.720> playing<00:02:51.019> both

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
using my index finger for playing both

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.259 
using my index finger for playing both
the<00:02:51.830> the<00:02:52.100> g<00:02:52.310> string<00:02:52.760> here<00:02:53.470> the<00:02:54.470> B<00:02:54.620> string<00:02:55.269> so

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
the the g string here the B string so

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:58.120 
the the g string here the B string so
I'm<00:02:56.390> swapping<00:02:56.720> between<00:02:57.290> these<00:02:57.560> two<00:02:57.799> strings

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
I'm swapping between these two strings

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:19.120 
I'm swapping between these two strings
with<00:02:58.280> the<00:02:58.400> right<00:02:58.610> hand<00:03:01.989> so

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.200 

for<00:03:20.130> those<00:03:20.280> of<00:03:20.430> you<00:03:20.520> with<00:03:20.670> no<00:03:20.790> picking

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:21.210 
for those of you with no picking

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:23.090 
for those of you with no picking
experience<00:03:21.870> you<00:03:22.050> should<00:03:22.080> practice<00:03:22.710> that<00:03:22.920> and

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
experience you should practice that and

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.750 
experience you should practice that and
maybe<00:03:23.310> try<00:03:23.550> and<00:03:23.700> get<00:03:23.820> some<00:03:24.060> pace<00:03:24.350> when<00:03:25.350> you<00:03:25.470> get

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
maybe try and get some pace when you get

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:42.710 
maybe try and get some pace when you get
confident<00:03:26.760> with<00:03:26.850> it

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.310 

second<00:03:43.720> note<00:03:44.940> is<00:03:45.940> this<00:03:46.180> slide<00:03:46.630> I've<00:03:46.900> mentioned

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
second note is this slide I've mentioned

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:52.050 
second note is this slide I've mentioned
and<00:03:49.920> it's<00:03:50.920> perhaps<00:03:51.130> the<00:03:51.370> most<00:03:51.520> one<00:03:51.910> of<00:03:52.000> the

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
and it's perhaps the most one of the

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.060 
and it's perhaps the most one of the
most<00:03:52.210> difficult<00:03:52.360> things<00:03:52.870> certainly<00:03:53.800> to<00:03:53.920> get

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
most difficult things certainly to get

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:57.210 
most difficult things certainly to get
started<00:03:54.580> with<00:03:54.670> this<00:03:54.790> lick<00:03:55.620> is<00:03:56.620> because<00:03:57.130> you

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
started with this lick is because you

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.270 
started with this lick is because you
want<00:03:57.370> to<00:03:57.430> Rive<00:03:57.700> at<00:03:58.090> this<00:03:58.650> this<00:03:59.650> third<00:03:59.950> fret

want to Rive at this this third fret

want to Rive at this this third fret
we're<00:04:00.460> sliding<00:04:00.730> from<00:04:01.090> the<00:04:01.210> first<00:04:01.450> fret<00:04:01.750> on<00:04:01.780> the

to<00:04:04.080> the<00:04:04.170> 3rd<00:04:04.440> fret<00:04:04.800> on<00:04:04.830> the<00:04:05.010> B<00:04:05.099> string<00:04:05.660> and<00:04:06.660> we

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
to the 3rd fret on the B string and we

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.650 
to the 3rd fret on the B string and we
want<00:04:06.959> to<00:04:07.020> arrive<00:04:07.379> at<00:04:07.739> that<00:04:07.920> third<00:04:08.190> fret<00:04:08.660> same

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
want to arrive at that third fret same

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.500 
want to arrive at that third fret same
time<00:04:09.989> as<00:04:10.140> our<00:04:10.290> thumbs<00:04:10.620> coming<00:04:11.069> down<00:04:11.360> on<00:04:12.360> the

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
time as our thumbs coming down on the

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:19.340 
time as our thumbs coming down on the
first<00:04:12.810> beat<00:04:13.340> so<00:04:14.340> it's<00:04:14.550> a<00:04:14.760> thumb<00:04:17.720> now<00:04:18.720> as<00:04:19.139> far<00:04:19.260> as

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
first beat so it's a thumb now as far as

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.170 
first beat so it's a thumb now as far as
the<00:04:19.440> right<00:04:19.620> hand<00:04:19.889> is<00:04:20.100> concerned<00:04:20.519> we're<00:04:21.030> not

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
the right hand is concerned we're not

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.850 
the right hand is concerned we're not
doing<00:04:21.479> any<00:04:21.630> more<00:04:21.900> than<00:04:22.079> we<00:04:22.139> were<00:04:22.260> doing<00:04:22.560> just<00:04:22.710> a

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
doing any more than we were doing just a

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:30.320 
doing any more than we were doing just a
moment<00:04:23.160> ago

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:41.219 

right<00:04:31.330> hands<00:04:31.720> doing<00:04:31.750> the<00:04:32.140> same<00:04:32.350> thing<00:04:32.680> here

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:41.229 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:05:03.279 

so<00:04:42.240> let's<00:04:43.240> loop<00:04:43.569> that

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:03.289 

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:18.040 

two<00:05:04.289> and<00:05:04.919> three

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:21.680 

it's<00:05:19.050> a<00:05:19.400> wee<00:05:20.400> bit<00:05:20.430> to<00:05:20.790> get<00:05:20.940> your<00:05:21.090> head<00:05:21.270> round<00:05:21.450> to

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.690 
it's a wee bit to get your head round to

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:25.540 
it's a wee bit to get your head round to
start<00:05:21.960> with<00:05:22.170> but<00:05:22.850> if<00:05:23.850> you<00:05:24.000> start<00:05:24.270> slowly<00:05:24.600> and

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:25.550 
start with but if you start slowly and

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:29.960 
start with but if you start slowly and
aim<00:05:26.550> for<00:05:26.580> a<00:05:27.450> regular<00:05:27.870> sound<00:05:28.200> and<00:05:28.850> try<00:05:29.850> and

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:29.970 
aim for a regular sound and try and

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:42.779 
aim for a regular sound and try and
build<00:05:30.060> a<00:05:30.210> bit<00:05:30.330> pace

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:42.789 

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:47.679 

okay<00:05:43.789> and<00:05:45.789> I'm<00:05:46.789> going<00:05:46.969> to<00:05:47.029> keep<00:05:47.179> these<00:05:47.299> lessons

00:05:47.679 --> 00:05:47.689 
okay and I'm going to keep these lessons

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:50.100 
okay and I'm going to keep these lessons
to<00:05:47.719> five<00:05:47.959> minutes<00:05:48.319> so<00:05:48.649> I<00:05:48.679> think<00:05:48.919> that's<00:05:49.369> enough

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
to five minutes so I think that's enough

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:51.969 
to five minutes so I think that's enough
beginners<00:05:51.110> I<00:05:51.289> think<00:05:51.469> that's<00:05:51.589> plenty<00:05:51.829> enough

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:51.979 
beginners I think that's plenty enough

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:55.959 
beginners I think that's plenty enough
to<00:05:52.279> practice<00:05:52.459> and<00:05:53.469> we'll<00:05:54.469> look<00:05:54.769> at<00:05:55.129> the<00:05:55.699> second

00:05:55.959 --> 00:05:55.969 
to practice and we'll look at the second

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:59.249 
to practice and we'll look at the second
half<00:05:55.999> of<00:05:56.419> the<00:05:56.629> first<00:05:57.379> bar<00:05:57.679> in<00:05:57.889> the<00:05:57.979> next<00:05:58.279> lesson

00:05:59.249 --> 00:05:59.259 
half of the first bar in the next lesson

00:05:59.259 --> 00:06:02.259 
half of the first bar in the next lesson
okay
