mods but I got this game in it and I I

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.080 
mods but I got this game in it and I I
thought<00:00:51.020> that<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.260> multiplayer<00:00:52.890> was<00:00:53.370> down<00:00:53.760> I

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
thought that the multiplayer was down I

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.630 
thought that the multiplayer was down I
thought<00:00:54.390> that<00:00:54.800> the<00:00:55.800> servers<00:00:56.160> were<00:00:56.190> all<00:00:56.399> dead

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
thought that the servers were all dead

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.110 
thought that the servers were all dead
and<00:00:56.670> stuff<00:00:57.030> apparently<00:00:57.390> it's<00:00:57.780> different<00:00:58.350> for

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
and stuff apparently it's different for

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.389 
and stuff apparently it's different for
PC<00:01:00.120> or<00:01:00.829> something<00:01:01.829> like<00:01:01.920> that<00:01:01.980> I<00:01:02.129> don't<00:01:02.219> know<00:01:02.340> I

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399

bought world at war at the time when it
came<00:01:20.400> out<00:01:20.430> I<00:01:20.580> believe<00:01:20.790> it<00:01:21.330> was<00:01:21.509> I<00:01:21.990> want<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.830> say

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 
came out I believe it was I want to say

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:29.149 
came out I believe it was I want to say
2006-2007<00:01:25.820> somewhere<00:01:26.820> in<00:01:26.880> that<00:01:26.909> c2000<00:01:28.159> let's

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
2006-2007 somewhere in that c2000 let's

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.950 
2006-2007 somewhere in that c2000 let's
see<00:01:29.340> doesn't<00:01:29.790> yeah<00:01:29.939> it<00:01:30.090> was<00:01:30.329> probably<00:01:30.689> closer

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
see doesn't yeah it was probably closer

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.270 
see doesn't yeah it was probably closer
to<00:01:31.049> two<00:01:31.259> thousand<00:01:31.619> seven<00:01:31.740> I<00:01:31.920> guess<00:01:32.100> because

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
to two thousand seven I guess because

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.929 
to two thousand seven I guess because
then<00:01:32.520> 2008<00:01:33.180> would<00:01:33.360> be<00:01:33.479> modern<00:01:33.780> warfare<00:01:33.960> 2<00:01:34.939> 2000

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
then 2008 would be modern warfare 2 2000

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.870 
then 2008 would be modern warfare 2 2000
not<00:01:36.119> know<00:01:36.420> it<00:01:36.900> would<00:01:37.170> have<00:01:37.290> to<00:01:37.409> be<00:01:37.439> 2008<00:01:38.130> would

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
not know it would have to be 2008 would

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.969 
not know it would have to be 2008 would
be<00:01:39.060> world<00:01:39.720> at<00:01:39.840> war<00:01:39.990> because<00:01:40.229> then<00:01:40.350> 2009

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
be world at war because then 2009

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.800 
be world at war because then 2009
monomorphic<00:01:41.880> I<00:01:42.180> don't<00:01:42.329> know<00:01:42.390> I<00:01:42.420> could<00:01:42.689> easily

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
monomorphic I don't know I could easily

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.600 
monomorphic I don't know I could easily
do<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.290> research<00:01:43.560> but<00:01:43.890> I'm<00:01:44.399> already

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
recording so screw it we're gonna go

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.700 
recording so screw it we're gonna go
anyway<00:01:47.430> around<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.790> time<00:01:47.970> it<00:01:48.090> came<00:01:48.210> out<00:01:48.420> I<00:01:49.290> you
