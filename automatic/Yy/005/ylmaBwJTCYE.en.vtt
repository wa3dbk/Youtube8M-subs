your<00:02:25.300> teeth<00:02:25.480> sensitive<00:02:26.130> when<00:02:27.130> you<00:02:27.280> use<00:02:27.459> the

your teeth sensitive when you use the
toothpaste<00:02:27.819> I<00:02:28.209> don't<00:02:28.390> think<00:02:28.600> it's<00:02:28.780> as<00:02:28.990> bad<00:02:29.020> as

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
toothpaste I don't think it's as bad as

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.110 
toothpaste I don't think it's as bad as
it<00:02:29.980> could<00:02:30.220> get<00:02:30.430> but<00:02:31.360> um<00:02:32.220> it<00:02:33.220> wasn't<00:02:33.459> so<00:02:33.700> bad<00:02:33.850> to

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
it could get but um it wasn't so bad to

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.520 
it could get but um it wasn't so bad to
where<00:02:34.240> I<00:02:34.300> couldn't<00:02:34.630> eat<00:02:34.990> or<00:02:35.170> anything<00:02:35.230> like

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
where I couldn't eat or anything like

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.160 
where I couldn't eat or anything like
that<00:02:35.880> if<00:02:36.880> you<00:02:37.030> just<00:02:37.060> stick<00:02:37.450> with<00:02:37.690> it<00:02:37.720> it<00:02:38.020> really

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
that if you just stick with it it really

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.890 
that if you just stick with it it really
does<00:02:38.470> work<00:02:38.709> though<00:02:38.980> and<00:02:39.270> I<00:02:40.270> just<00:02:40.450> wanted<00:02:40.570> to<00:02:40.750> do

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
does work though and I just wanted to do

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.080 
does work though and I just wanted to do
a<00:02:40.930> quick<00:02:41.050> review<00:02:41.470> on<00:02:41.709> this<00:02:42.040> because<00:02:42.430> I<00:02:42.610> really

really like this product and I mean I
wouldn't<00:02:46.690> see<00:02:46.930> why<00:02:46.959> it<00:02:47.200> wouldn't<00:02:47.530> work<00:02:47.650> on

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
wouldn't see why it wouldn't work on

wouldn't see why it wouldn't work on
anyone<00:02:48.760> else<00:02:48.970> unless<00:02:49.209> your<00:02:49.480> teeth<00:02:49.660> are<00:02:49.840> like
