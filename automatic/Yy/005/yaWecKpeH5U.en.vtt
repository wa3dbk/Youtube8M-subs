00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
own my hunches this one I could use a

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.679 
own my hunches this one I could use a
squire<00:01:16.740> basically<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:18.060> beat<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.450> campaign

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
the whole entire campaign actor i'd be

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.539 
the whole entire campaign actor i'd be
down<00:01:20.640> so<00:01:21.090> low<00:01:21.150> with<00:01:21.420> my<00:01:21.630> Squire<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.290> I<00:01:23.280> think

out of all the characters acquires its

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.560 
out of all the characters acquires its
pretty<00:01:26.790> much<00:01:27.110> overpowered<00:01:28.110> um<00:01:29.450> compared<00:01:30.450> to

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
pretty much overpowered um compared to

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
this a 10-minute video and I could

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.810 
this a 10-minute video and I could
shrink<00:02:00.570> it<00:02:00.720> down<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:01.140> like<00:02:01.260> three<00:02:01.710> to<00:02:02.580> four

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
shrink it down to like three to four

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.900 
shrink it down to like three to four
minute<00:02:03.180> video<00:02:03.330> and<00:02:04.100> it's<00:02:05.100> easier<00:02:05.580> to<00:02:05.700> watch

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:05.910 
minute video and it's easier to watch

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.300 
minute video and it's easier to watch
then<00:02:06.420> then<00:02:07.260> just<00:02:07.500> stand<00:02:07.680> there<00:02:07.890> you<00:02:08.190> know

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
then then just stand there you know

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.260 
then then just stand there you know
that's<00:02:09.270> why<00:02:09.479> fast<00:02:09.840> for<00:02:10.110> certain<00:02:10.590> spot

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
that's why fast for certain spot

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.480 
that's why fast for certain spot
