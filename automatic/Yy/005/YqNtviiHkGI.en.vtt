when<00:01:23.909> I<00:01:23.939> was<00:01:24.150> opening<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:24.810> pack<00:01:25.049> but<00:01:25.979> by<00:01:26.100> the

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
when I was opening a pack but by the

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.800 
when I was opening a pack but by the
time<00:01:26.250> I<00:01:26.400> clicked<00:01:26.759> cancel<00:01:27.180> like<00:01:27.600> stop

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
time I clicked cancel like stop

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.330 
time I clicked cancel like stop
recording<00:01:28.110> so<00:01:28.470> I<00:01:28.530> know<00:01:28.619> whether<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.159> good

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
recording so I know whether the good

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.910 
recording so I know whether the good
pack<00:01:29.549> is<00:01:29.759> or<00:01:29.939> not<00:01:30.060> it<00:01:30.630> would<00:01:30.900> it<00:01:31.320> would<00:01:31.380> stop

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
pack is or not it would it would stop

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.620 
pack is or not it would it would stop
exactly<00:01:32.400> what<00:01:32.729> it's<00:01:32.880> caught<00:01:33.090> on<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.360> screen

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
exactly what it's caught on the screen

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.460 
exactly what it's caught on the screen
so<00:01:33.810> basically<00:01:34.320> it's<00:01:34.920> stopping<00:01:35.340> a<00:01:35.670> pack

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
so basically it's stopping a pack

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.630 
so basically it's stopping a pack
previously<00:01:37.470> so<00:01:37.740> basically<00:01:38.130> it's<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.310> rubbish

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
previously so basically it's a rubbish

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.069 
previously so basically it's a rubbish
