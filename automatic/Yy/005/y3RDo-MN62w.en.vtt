that's huge 23rd up to 7 he will have

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:40.109 
that's huge 23rd up to 7 he will have
been<00:01:27.440> pulling<00:01:27.740> some<00:01:27.770> speed<00:01:30.100> cleaning<00:01:31.100> on<00:01:31.220> low

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:43.260 

so

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:50.649 

Daniel<00:01:43.840> out<00:01:43.990> pulling<00:01:44.409> the<00:01:44.500> car<00:01:44.680> around<00:01:45.960> but<00:01:46.960> it

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:53.410 

it's<00:01:51.140> strange<00:01:51.439> that<00:01:51.500> rears<00:01:52.250> of<00:01:52.549> the<00:01:52.670> cars<00:01:52.909> are

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
it's strange that rears of the cars are

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.200 
it's strange that rears of the cars are
damaged<00:01:53.990> so<00:01:54.229> that's<00:01:54.530> very<00:01:54.770> strange<00:01:55.210> if

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
damaged so that's very strange if

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.630 
damaged so that's very strange if
someone<00:01:56.659> you<00:01:57.080> know<00:01:57.159> crashes<00:01:58.159> into<00:01:58.340> someone

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
someone you know crashes into someone

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.640 
someone you know crashes into someone
that<00:01:58.670> stalled<00:01:59.090> then<00:01:59.360> you<00:01:59.509> would<00:01:59.630> have<00:02:00.140> a<00:02:00.200> car

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650 
that stalled then you would have a car

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.420 
that stalled then you would have a car

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:12.829 
I think on board within that there's

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:17.890 
I think on board within that there's
quite<00:04:13.099> falls<00:04:13.370> on<00:04:13.519> the<00:04:13.579> left
