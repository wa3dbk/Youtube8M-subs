00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.440
 we restarted or 

00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:09.589
 the most perfect 

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:11.779
 the ones we've already done 

00:00:11.779 --> 00:00:12.880
 I think 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.590
 You have to be cool, you have to have work, but you have to be lucky. 

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:20.029
 the courage to dare 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:22.439
 I think the courage 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.439
 the company has power to accompany several artist would have prevented from speaking 

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:27.890
 Earth 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.890
 I think it was very big but we recorded a dvd one cd 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:33.800
 What do you have on December 17th? 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.800
 I speak how to record a dvd on the 31 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.650
 puts rivers kararaÃ´ went crazy added to it all I was fortunate to 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.390
 because something 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.390
 was leaving 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.240
 and giving experience 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.380
 formatting a dvd 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.380
 I can say that the following 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.670
 1 making an analogy a house has an engineer 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:06.840
 who construct its structure its base and the architect remains of luiza is left that 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.390
 the final finish 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.540
 So if it could be years 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.540
 make analogy would say that part of the show 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.930
 is the engineer the whole structure that gives base of all this money if it marks 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.930
 cherry tree has placed fiorin which has worked very well 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.290
 on the first dvd I had the happiness of 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.340
 hire you 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.270
 an adept 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.280
 and was very happy 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.340
 Why was your first job in Brazil? 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.970
 I was full of new ideas. 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.720
 pines are the way of election was a different thing 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.220
 was what gave the differentiation 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:47.420
 in the area 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.240
 companion 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.370
 ef 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:56.140
 will be so little about I can say that this way of life was very copied 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.250
 all other bands followed 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.410
 including me on my next company dvd volumes 2 that was recorded 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.190
 in Goiania 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.450
 he started and rolled in 2013 evaluated him 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.339
 follows the same style 

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:11.810
 but it just seems 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.599
 the completion of this DVD was that I came to realized the error I had made 

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:19.929
 that you can hire a foreigner 

00:02:19.929 --> 00:02:24.009
 or can do the same show can do in this structure but the architect 

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:25.449
 It has to be another 

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:27.299
 why the fans 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:31.680
 of the bands she wants something new that was something and who gives the finishing is this 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:35.439
 I'm divided and that's when I brought 

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:38.859
 my friends there that we talked so much to bring points 

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:42.019
 cuiabÃ¡ and rafael 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:45.269
 I believe I know the difference. 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:48.819
 in this new date is capped life in the company of calypso 

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:51.099
 cops 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:54.789
 is a form of them are totally new that I particularly 

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:57.269
 created a perfect shape 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:58.269
 that
