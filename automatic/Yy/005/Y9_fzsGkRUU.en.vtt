static way of teaching where you have

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.779 
static way of teaching where you have
students<00:00:51.989> sitting<00:00:52.199> around<00:00:52.530> taking<00:00:52.949> notes<00:00:53.370> and

students sitting around taking notes and
instead<00:00:54.239> we<00:00:54.390> stress<00:00:54.719> interaction<00:00:55.530> we<00:00:55.800> stress

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
instead we stress interaction we stress

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.510 
instead we stress interaction we stress
oral<00:00:56.460> skills<00:00:56.850> critical<00:00:57.420> thinking<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:58.520> so

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
oral skills critical thinking and so

oral skills critical thinking and so
basically<00:00:59.670> we<00:01:00.120> try<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.359> have<00:01:00.539> an<00:01:00.660> exchange<00:01:01.140> of

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
basically we try to have an exchange of

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.080 
basically we try to have an exchange of
ideas<00:01:02.300> we<00:01:03.300> have<00:01:04.790> interactive<00:01:05.790> learning

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
ideas we have interactive learning

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.500 
ideas we have interactive learning
format<00:01:06.780> based<00:01:07.710> on<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.220> round<00:01:08.460> table<00:01:09.030> theory

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
format based on the round table theory

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.100 
format based on the round table theory
that<00:01:09.689> is<00:01:09.930> all<00:01:10.260> of<00:01:10.380> our<00:01:10.500> classrooms<00:01:11.310> are

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
that is all of our classrooms are

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.230 
that is all of our classrooms are
equipped<00:01:13.110> with<00:01:13.229> round<00:01:13.740> tables<00:01:14.340> which<00:01:14.939> means

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
equipped with round tables which means

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.179
