00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
foam styrofoam this is actually I think

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.310 
foam styrofoam this is actually I think
it's<00:01:35.189> an<00:01:35.280> hour<00:01:35.549> value<00:01:36.060> of<00:01:36.240> like<00:01:36.509> I<00:01:36.810> don't<00:01:37.170> I

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
it's an hour value of like I don't I

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.410 
it's an hour value of like I don't I
can't<00:01:37.560> be<00:01:37.650> much<00:01:37.860> probably<00:01:38.400> three<00:01:39.060> or

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
can't be much probably three or

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.749 
can't be much probably three or
something<00:01:39.630> like<00:01:39.810> that<00:01:39.869> but<00:01:40.259> I<00:01:40.619> got<00:01:41.310> this<00:01:41.490> at<00:01:41.729> a

small furring strips that are holding my
shelf<00:03:00.510> up<00:03:00.780> and<00:03:01.370> because<00:03:02.370> this<00:03:02.610> is<00:03:02.820> just<00:03:03.120> really

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
shelf up and because this is just really

fasten it but I'm used to drill and the
reason<00:04:54.130> I<00:04:54.190> chose<00:04:54.370> these<00:04:54.640> specs

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
reason I chose these specs

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.920 
reason I chose these specs
these<00:04:56.200> were<00:04:56.500> 19<00:04:57.340> cents<00:04:57.700> apiece<00:04:57.850> and<00:04:58.360> these<00:04:58.780> are

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 
these were 19 cents apiece and these are

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:00.780 
these were 19 cents apiece and these are
very<00:04:59.200> aggressive<00:04:59.350> how<00:05:00.040> they<00:05:00.220> go<00:05:00.370> into<00:05:00.520> the

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:00.790 
very aggressive how they go into the

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:02.640 
very aggressive how they go into the
wood<00:05:01.000> really<00:05:01.480> simple<00:05:02.050> you<00:05:02.260> know<00:05:02.320> if<00:05:02.410> you<00:05:02.500> can

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
wood really simple you know if you can

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.030 
wood really simple you know if you can
see<00:05:02.860> it<00:05:02.950> but<00:05:03.210> they've<00:05:04.210> got<00:05:04.510> a<00:05:04.840> little<00:05:05.290> teeth<00:05:05.740> on

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:06.040 
see it but they've got a little teeth on

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.070 
see it but they've got a little teeth on
them<00:05:06.160> you<00:05:06.940> can't<00:05:07.150> see<00:05:07.240> it<00:05:07.420> I<00:05:07.480> can't<00:05:07.720> even<00:05:07.780> focus

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 
them you can't see it I can't even focus

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.900 
them you can't see it I can't even focus
that<00:05:08.410> but<00:05:08.590> they<00:05:09.160> have<00:05:09.280> little<00:05:09.430> teeth<00:05:09.640> on<00:05:09.790> the

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:09.910 
that but they have little teeth on the

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:11.930 
that but they have little teeth on the
grooves<00:05:10.180> so<00:05:10.330> it<00:05:10.510> goes<00:05:10.690> in<00:05:10.900> real<00:05:11.200> simple

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
grooves so it goes in real simple

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.100 
grooves so it goes in real simple
alright<00:05:12.940> so<00:05:13.450> this<00:05:13.690> is<00:05:13.870> kind<00:05:14.080> of<00:05:14.140> the<00:05:14.260> end<00:05:14.350> of

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
alright so this is kind of the end of

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.020 
alright so this is kind of the end of
film<00:05:17.110> one<00:05:17.410> it's<00:05:18.070> gonna<00:05:18.160> be<00:05:18.250> multiple<00:05:18.760> parts

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:19.030 
film one it's gonna be multiple parts

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:20.580 
film one it's gonna be multiple parts
because<00:05:19.240> it's<00:05:19.390> just<00:05:19.600> too<00:05:19.810> long<00:05:19.960> to<00:05:20.140> do<00:05:20.260> it<00:05:20.290> and

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:20.590 
because it's just too long to do it and

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:24.630 
because it's just too long to do it and
jam<00:05:21.280> it<00:05:21.310> all<00:05:21.490> into<00:05:21.790> one<00:05:22.920> so<00:05:23.920> I've<00:05:24.040> got<00:05:24.250> my<00:05:24.400> rails

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:24.640 
jam it all into one so I've got my rails

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:27.390 
jam it all into one so I've got my rails
up<00:05:25.000> now<00:05:25.560> they've<00:05:26.560> been<00:05:26.740> all<00:05:26.860> leveled<00:05:27.250> out<00:05:27.370> and

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:27.400 
up now they've been all leveled out and

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.480 
up now they've been all leveled out and

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:43.840 
next plan is I have to figure out how to

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.750 
next plan is I have to figure out how to
get<00:05:43.960> insulation<00:05:44.650> up<00:05:44.860> in<00:05:45.070> here<00:05:45.400> this<00:05:45.550> is<00:05:45.610> the

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:52.210 
shop lights I've got that problem solved

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:54.240 
shop lights I've got that problem solved
and<00:05:52.240> I'm<00:05:52.360> going<00:05:52.480> to<00:05:52.540> show<00:05:52.660> you<00:05:52.690> that<00:05:52.900> here<00:05:53.250> real

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:55.810 
shortly and then we have to figure out

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:56.880 
shortly and then we have to figure out
how<00:05:55.930> we're<00:05:56.050> going<00:05:56.140> to<00:05:56.200> make<00:05:56.350> the<00:05:56.470> inside<00:05:56.800> of

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:56.890 
how we're going to make the inside of

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:59.490 
how we're going to make the inside of
this<00:05:56.980> thing<00:05:57.040> all<00:05:57.940> reflective<00:05:58.870> and<00:05:59.169> then<00:05:59.290> home

00:05:59.490 --> 00:05:59.500 
this thing all reflective and then home

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.620 
this thing all reflective and then home
and<00:05:59.680> it<00:05:59.740> put<00:05:59.860> a<00:05:59.890> front<00:06:00.100> door<00:06:01.000> on<00:06:01.210> this<00:06:01.390> whole

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:01.630 
and it put a front door on this whole

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:03.960 
and it put a front door on this whole
deal<00:06:02.250> so<00:06:03.250> that<00:06:03.400> every

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:03.970 
deal so that every

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:07.149 
deal so that every
is<00:06:04.970> all<00:06:05.150> enclosed<00:06:05.509> so<00:06:06.009> coming<00:06:07.009> up<00:06:07.069> very

00:06:07.149 --> 00:06:07.159 
is all enclosed so coming up very

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:09.310 
is all enclosed so coming up very
shortly
