they're<00:01:47.229> very<00:01:47.259> smooth<00:01:47.800> you<00:01:48.520> know<00:01:48.580> very

00:01:48.809 --> 00:01:48.819 
they're very smooth you know very

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:51.240 
they're very smooth you know very
gradual<00:01:49.539> not<00:01:49.720> to<00:01:49.929> you<00:01:50.560> know<00:01:50.679> not<00:01:50.800> too<00:01:51.009> serious

so<00:01:51.520> they're<00:01:51.670> very<00:01:51.849> very<00:01:52.030> usable<00:01:52.599> you<00:01:53.500> know

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
so they're very very usable you know

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.740 
so they're very very usable you know
they<00:01:53.709> just<00:01:53.890> don't<00:01:54.099> cut<00:01:54.340> everything<00:01:54.640> off<00:01:54.970> you

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
they just don't cut everything off you

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.729 
they just don't cut everything off you
know<00:01:55.869> so<00:01:56.410> it's<00:01:56.679> a<00:01:56.860> very<00:01:56.950> musical<00:01:58.110> and<00:01:59.110> then<00:01:59.289> the
