00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
guys feel free if you want to but you

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.870

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.550 
can run by them if you really want to
it's<00:00:27.510> probably<00:00:27.779> easy<00:00:27.930> if<00:00:28.080> you're<00:00:28.170> gonna<00:00:28.260> farm

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.779 
it's probably easy if you're gonna farm
it<00:00:28.680> you<00:00:28.769> could<00:00:28.890> probably<00:00:29.039> just<00:00:29.250> run<00:00:29.429> by<00:00:29.580> them

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
it you could probably just run by them

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.380 
it you could probably just run by them
but<00:00:29.939> it's<00:00:30.750> up<00:00:30.900> to<00:00:30.929> you<00:00:31.080> so<00:00:31.940> it's<00:00:32.940> easier<00:00:33.210> with<00:00:33.360> a

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
but it's up to you so it's easier with a

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.299 
but it's up to you so it's easier with a
larger<00:00:33.870> group<00:00:34.110> -<00:00:34.320> I<00:00:34.350> did<00:00:34.590> it<00:00:34.649> by<00:00:34.739> myself<00:00:34.890> and<00:00:35.190> it

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
larger group - I did it by myself and it

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:36.920 
larger group - I did it by myself and it
took<00:00:35.430> fairly<00:00:35.820> long<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.120> kill<00:00:36.270> everyone<00:00:36.480> so

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
took fairly long to kill everyone so

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.770 
took fairly long to kill everyone so
yeah<00:00:37.649> we're<00:00:38.250> just<00:00:38.280> gonna<00:00:38.550> skip<00:00:38.940> ahead<00:00:39.000> in<00:00:39.660> a

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
yeah we're just gonna skip ahead in a

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.920 
yeah we're just gonna skip ahead in a

percent of the time but there's a it's a

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:58.639 
percent of the time but there's a it's a
really<00:00:57.690> low<00:00:57.930> chance<00:00:58.199> like<00:00:58.379> all<00:00:58.500> the

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
really low chance like all the

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.049 
really low chance like all the
legendaries<00:00:59.160> but<00:00:59.370> it's<00:00:59.520> pretty<00:00:59.730> much<00:00:59.879> forever

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
legendaries but it's pretty much forever

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.360

doesn't really matter

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.429 
doesn't really matter
I<00:01:08.369> think<00:01:09.060> he's<00:01:09.240> weaker<00:01:09.600> with<00:01:09.780> fire<00:01:10.049> to<00:01:10.260> be

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
I think he's weaker with fire to be

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.039 
I think he's weaker with fire to be
honest<00:01:11.070> but<00:01:11.310> I<00:01:11.340> used<00:01:11.640> slag<00:01:12.000> just<00:01:12.750> because<00:01:12.900> I

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
honest but I used slag just because I

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.780 
honest but I used slag just because I
always<00:01:13.320> use<00:01:13.470> lagging<00:01:13.979> something's<00:01:14.400> it's<00:01:14.580> just

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
always use lagging something's it's just

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.539 
always use lagging something's it's just
stronger<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.600> it's<00:01:15.780> more<00:01:15.960> of<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.080> generic

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:16.549 
stronger and it's more of a generic

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:22.630 
stronger and it's more of a generic
bonus<00:01:17.549> so<00:01:18.439> almost<00:01:19.439> killed<00:01:19.799> and<00:01:20.689> so<00:01:21.689> close

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
bonus so almost killed and so close

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.370 
bonus so almost killed and so close
there's<00:01:23.640> also<00:01:23.790> midgets<00:01:24.299> that<00:01:24.720> run<00:01:25.020> on<00:01:25.140> him

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380

they're<00:01:26.070> called<00:01:26.250> midget<00:01:26.549> bombers<00:01:26.880> so<00:01:27.090> it's

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
they're called midget bombers so it's

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.660
