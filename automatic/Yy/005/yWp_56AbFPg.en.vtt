took us almost a year to do the entire
book<00:01:06.560> the<00:01:07.560> interesting<00:01:08.250> thing<00:01:08.460> is<00:01:08.490> that<00:01:08.750> OPEC

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
book the interesting thing is that OPEC

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.230 
book the interesting thing is that OPEC
is<00:01:09.780> not<00:01:10.140> about<00:01:10.439> two<00:01:10.860> or<00:01:11.100> even<00:01:11.159> capable<00:01:11.790> of

is not about two or even capable of
increasing<00:01:12.600> their<00:01:13.049> oil<00:01:13.229> exports<00:01:14.220> they

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
increasing their oil exports they

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.280 
increasing their oil exports they
recently<00:01:15.210> decreased<00:01:15.659> one-point-two<00:01:16.259> percent

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
recently decreased one-point-two percent

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.010 
recently decreased one-point-two percent
last<00:01:17.159> year<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.670> that<00:01:17.820> caused<00:01:18.090> all<00:01:18.450> our<00:01:18.840> oil

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
last year and that caused all our oil

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.410 
last year and that caused all our oil
prices<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:19.560> go<00:01:19.710> haywire<00:01:20.189> so<00:01:20.880> we're<00:01:21.270> at<00:01:21.360> the

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
prices to go haywire so we're at the

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.030 
prices to go haywire so we're at the
point<00:01:21.630> now<00:01:21.750> where<00:01:21.869> we<00:01:22.170> have<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.470> demand<00:01:22.770> free

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
energy the public doesn't really

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.899 
energy the public doesn't really
understand<00:01:25.590> what<00:01:25.740> free<00:01:25.890> energy<00:01:26.220> is<00:01:26.250> but<00:01:26.880> I

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
understand what free energy is but I

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.429 
understand what free energy is but I
believe<00:01:27.210> it's<00:01:27.420> already<00:01:27.600> available<00:01:27.810> through

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
believe it's already available through

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.969 
believe it's already available through
zero<00:01:28.650> point<00:01:28.890> energy<00:01:29.600> converters<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:30.780> so<00:01:31.409> at

zero point energy converters and so at

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.420 
zero point energy converters and so at
area<00:01:32.280> 51<00:01:32.759> for<00:01:32.939> example<00:01:33.360> as<00:01:33.509> for<00:01:33.979> we<00:01:34.979> understand

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
area 51 for example as for we understand

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.539 
area 51 for example as for we understand
that<00:01:35.670> there<00:01:36.630> is<00:01:36.689> a<00:01:36.840> possibility<00:01:37.320> from<00:01:38.130> for

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
that there is a possibility from for

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.190 
that there is a possibility from for
this<00:01:38.700> type<00:01:38.909> of<00:01:38.939> propulsion<00:01:39.390> for<00:01:39.869> this<00:01:39.990> type<00:01:40.170> of

this type of propulsion for this type of

this type of propulsion for this type of
energy<00:01:40.500> conversion<00:01:41.280> so<00:01:41.759> they're<00:01:42.180> getting

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
energy conversion so they're getting

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.660 
energy conversion so they're getting

the fascinating thing about zero point

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.859 
the fascinating thing about zero point
energy<00:01:46.860> is<00:01:47.220> to<00:01:47.670> just<00:01:48.030> step<00:01:48.240> back<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:48.570> explain

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
energy is to just step back and explain

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.469 
energy is to just step back and explain
it<00:01:49.049> is<00:01:49.170> that<00:01:49.250> zero<00:01:50.250> point<00:01:50.460> energy<00:01:50.520> essentially

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
it is that zero point energy essentially

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.499 
it is that zero point energy essentially
is<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.899> energy<00:01:52.409> that<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.829> vacuum<00:01:53.509> possesses

is the energy that the vacuum possesses

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.830 
is the energy that the vacuum possesses

months<00:04:12.019> ago<00:04:12.230> they<00:04:12.440> actually<00:04:12.470> one<00:04:12.859> month<00:04:13.069> ago

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
months ago they actually one month ago

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.490 
months ago they actually one month ago
in<00:04:13.340> September<00:04:13.910> the<00:04:14.600> OPEC<00:04:14.870> nations<00:04:15.260> got

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
in September the OPEC nations got

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.529 
in September the OPEC nations got
together<00:04:15.650> for<00:04:15.889> the<00:04:16.100> first<00:04:16.310> time<00:04:16.519> in<00:04:16.970> 25<00:04:17.479> years

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:17.539 
together for the first time in 25 years

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:20.649 
together for the first time in 25 years
and<00:04:18.220> when<00:04:19.220> OPEC<00:04:19.519> got<00:04:19.729> together<00:04:19.880> they

00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:20.659 
and when OPEC got together they

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:22.850 
and when OPEC got together they
basically<00:04:21.109> didn't<00:04:21.709> respond<00:04:22.220> to

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
basically didn't respond to

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.379 
basically didn't respond to
either<00:04:23.129> the<00:04:23.280> United<00:04:23.610> States<00:04:23.819> or<00:04:24.150> the<00:04:24.180> European

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:24.389 
either the United States or the European

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:26.529 
either the United States or the European
nation<00:04:25.110> demand<00:04:25.500> for<00:04:25.830> increased<00:04:26.219> output

00:04:26.529 --> 00:04:26.539 
nation demand for increased output

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:29.540 
nation demand for increased output
instead<00:04:27.539> they<00:04:28.080> basically<00:04:28.530> said<00:04:28.919> will<00:04:29.159> supply

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
instead they basically said will supply

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.830 
instead they basically said will supply
a<00:04:29.969> steady<00:04:30.629> output<00:04:31.110> at<00:04:31.740> a<00:04:31.800> fair<00:04:32.460> price<00:04:32.490> and<00:04:33.000> so

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
a steady output at a fair price and so

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.240 
a steady output at a fair price and so
what<00:04:34.080> I<00:04:34.110> believe<00:04:34.409> is<00:04:34.560> happening<00:04:34.710> and<00:04:35.159> I

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
what I believe is happening and I

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.459 
what I believe is happening and I
suppose<00:04:35.669> their<00:04:35.909> other<00:04:36.030> critics<00:04:36.479> as<00:04:36.659> well<00:04:36.870> that

00:04:37.459 --> 00:04:37.469 
suppose their other critics as well that

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:40.249 
suppose their other critics as well that
will<00:04:37.889> analyze<00:04:38.219> the<00:04:38.400> situation<00:04:38.810> knowing<00:04:39.810> that

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:40.259 
will analyze the situation knowing that

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:42.320 
will analyze the situation knowing that
there<00:04:40.469> is<00:04:40.560> a<00:04:40.590> peak<00:04:40.889> coming<00:04:41.310> up<00:04:41.460> and<00:04:41.639> a<00:04:41.969> force

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
there is a peak coming up and a force

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.899 
there is a peak coming up and a force
decline<00:04:42.810> the<00:04:43.620> best<00:04:43.830> way<00:04:44.039> they<00:04:44.250> can<00:04:44.280> profit

00:04:44.899 --> 00:04:44.909 
decline the best way they can profit

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:47.320 
decline the best way they can profit
since<00:04:45.539> they<00:04:45.750> hold<00:04:46.080> two<00:04:46.379> thirds<00:04:46.710> of<00:04:46.979> the

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
since they hold two thirds of the

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:52.459 
since they hold two thirds of the
world's<00:04:48.330> oil<00:04:49.250> reserves<00:04:50.250> is<00:04:51.180> to<00:04:51.810> essentially

00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:52.469 
world's oil reserves is to essentially

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:54.800 
world's oil reserves is to essentially
cut<00:04:52.919> back<00:04:53.159> a<00:04:53.430> one-percent<00:04:54.210> like<00:04:54.449> they<00:04:54.599> did

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
cut back a one-percent like they did

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.820 
cut back a one-percent like they did
last<00:04:55.050> year<00:04:55.729> now<00:04:56.729> instead<00:04:57.180> of<00:04:57.330> later<00:04:57.680> and<00:04:58.680> by

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830 
last year now instead of later and by

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:00.409 
last year now instead of later and by
doing<00:04:59.009> that<00:04:59.219> they<00:04:59.490> force<00:04:59.789> prices<00:05:00.240> up

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:00.419 
doing that they force prices up

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:04.279 
doing that they force prices up
artificially<00:05:01.349> high<00:05:01.379> and<00:05:02.330> essentially<00:05:03.330> get<00:05:04.169> us

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:04.289 
artificially high and essentially get us

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:07.119

somebody who controls the market so I

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:13.490 
somebody who controls the market so I
think<00:06:11.150> essentially<00:06:12.150> that<00:06:12.479> our<00:06:12.779> human<00:06:13.080> race<00:06:13.259> to

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:13.500 
think essentially that our human race to

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:17.149 
think essentially that our human race to
survive<00:06:13.650> has<00:06:14.610> to<00:06:14.879> have<00:06:15.060> free<00:06:15.300> energy<00:06:15.889> we're<00:06:16.889> at

00:06:17.149 --> 00:06:17.159 
survive has to have free energy we're at

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:19.189 
survive has to have free energy we're at

00:06:19.189 --> 00:06:19.199 
a collision course right now our economy

00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:22.700 
a collision course right now our economy
cannot<00:06:19.520> expect<00:06:20.520> to<00:06:20.639> expand<00:06:21.319> our<00:06:22.319> propulsion

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:22.710 
cannot expect to expand our propulsion

is<00:06:30.719> a<00:06:30.959> huge<00:06:31.560> waste<00:06:31.800> of<00:06:31.949> money<00:06:32.180> so<00:06:33.180> I<00:06:33.599> feel<00:06:34.319> very

00:06:34.939 --> 00:06:34.949 
is a huge waste of money so I feel very

00:06:34.949 --> 00:06:36.890 
is a huge waste of money so I feel very
strongly<00:06:35.279> that<00:06:35.459> free<00:06:36.209> energy<00:06:36.599> and

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:36.900 
strongly that free energy and

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:40.340 
strongly that free energy and
gravity<00:06:37.350> are<00:06:37.850> very<00:06:38.850> eminent<00:06:39.330> and<00:06:39.509> that<00:06:40.169> there

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:40.350 
gravity are very eminent and that there

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:42.290 
gravity are very eminent and that there
are<00:06:40.440> a<00:06:40.470> lot<00:06:40.620> of<00:06:40.650> inventors<00:06:40.979> that<00:06:41.430> have<00:06:41.610> put

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:42.300 
are a lot of inventors that have put

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:45.529 
are a lot of inventors that have put
together<00:06:42.419> the<00:06:42.930> basis<00:06:43.620> for<00:06:43.919> this<00:06:44.160> type<00:06:44.400> of<00:06:44.539> new

00:06:45.529 --> 00:06:45.539 
together the basis for this type of new

00:06:45.539 --> 00:06:47.749 
together the basis for this type of new
energy<00:06:45.810> future<00:06:46.380> and<00:06:46.800> it's<00:06:47.250> just<00:06:47.400> a<00:06:47.490> matter<00:06:47.520> of

00:06:47.749 --> 00:06:47.759 
energy future and it's just a matter of

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:49.430 
energy future and it's just a matter of
us<00:06:47.970> getting<00:06:48.210> investors<00:06:48.690> together<00:06:48.900> and<00:06:49.320> doing

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:49.440 
us getting investors together and doing

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:53.600 
us getting investors together and doing
the<00:06:49.590> work<00:06:49.970> so<00:06:50.970> we<00:06:51.180> have<00:06:51.389> a<00:06:51.419> very<00:06:52.310> good<00:06:53.310> future

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:53.610 
the work so we have a very good future

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:55.700 
the work so we have a very good future
to<00:06:53.820> look<00:06:53.940> forward<00:06:54.000> to<00:06:54.449> but<00:06:54.660> it<00:06:55.169> involves<00:06:55.560> new

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:55.710 
to look forward to but it involves new

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:58.060 
to look forward to but it involves new
thinking<00:06:56.100> and<00:06:56.250> getting<00:06:56.729> rid<00:06:57.000> of<00:06:57.060> the<00:06:57.300> old

00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:58.070 
thinking and getting rid of the old

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:02.390 
thinking and getting rid of the old
meter<00:06:59.509> jpmorgan<00:07:00.509> mentality<00:07:00.960> or<00:07:01.199> we<00:07:02.039> have<00:07:02.250> to

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:02.400 
meter jpmorgan mentality or we have to

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.520 
meter jpmorgan mentality or we have to
pay<00:07:02.550> for<00:07:02.610> our<00:07:02.910> energy<00:07:03.660> consistently<00:07:04.289> month

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:04.530 
pay for our energy consistently month

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:08.449 
pay for our energy consistently month
after<00:07:04.860> month<00:07:04.979> on<00:07:05.430> gallon<00:07:05.850> after<00:07:06.120> gallon
