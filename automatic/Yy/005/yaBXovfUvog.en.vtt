00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
build a starting squad now I'm gonna

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.890 
build a starting squad now I'm gonna
check<00:02:43.320> if<00:02:43.470> I<00:02:43.620> have<00:02:43.650> any<00:02:43.950> City<00:02:44.310> players<00:02:44.580> already

check if I have any City players already

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.790 
check if I have any City players already
which<00:02:45.900> I<00:02:46.110> don't<00:02:46.560> think<00:02:47.070> I<00:02:47.250> have<00:02:48.440> let's<00:02:49.440> try

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
which I don't think I have let's try

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.830 
which I don't think I have let's try
that<00:02:49.980> now<00:02:50.610> it's<00:02:51.150> going<00:02:51.390> to<00:02:51.450> be<00:02:51.570> really

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
that now it's going to be really

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.900 
that now it's going to be really
difficult<00:02:52.140> getting<00:02:52.800> coins<00:02:53.190> because<00:02:53.460> as<00:02:53.760> you

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
difficult getting coins because as you

00:02:53.910 --> 00:03:01.100 
difficult getting coins because as you
can<00:02:53.940> see<00:02:54.090> we<00:02:55.020> only<00:02:55.410> have<00:02:55.800> 130<00:02:56.900> so<00:02:57.900> I<00:02:59.540> think<00:03:00.540> the

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
can see we only have 130 so I think the

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.570 
can see we only have 130 so I think the
only<00:03:01.320> way<00:03:01.860> I<00:03:01.890> can<00:03:02.040> build<00:03:02.550> um<00:03:03.920> coins<00:03:04.920> from<00:03:05.370> now

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
only way I can build um coins from now

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:13.190 
only way I can build um coins from now
is<00:03:06.410> to<00:03:07.410> just<00:03:08.750> go<00:03:09.750> and<00:03:10.230> wait<00:03:10.980> every<00:03:11.490> day<00:03:11.640> for<00:03:12.240> the

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
is to just go and wait every day for the

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.820 
is to just go and wait every day for the
daily<00:03:13.590> gift<00:03:13.800> so<00:03:14.490> I<00:03:15.140> can't<00:03:16.140> really<00:03:16.320> think<00:03:16.680> of

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
daily gift so I can't really think of

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.230 
daily gift so I can't really think of
any<00:03:17.010> other<00:03:17.130> way<00:03:17.190> of<00:03:17.370> making<00:03:17.670> coins<00:03:17.850> the<00:03:18.090> game
