00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
welcome guys my name is oink and this is

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.510 
welcome guys my name is oink and this is
going<00:00:03.720> to<00:00:03.780> be<00:00:03.899> advanced<00:00:04.589> quit<00:00:04.859> scoping<00:00:05.339> and

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
going to be advanced quit scoping and

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.270 
going to be advanced quit scoping and
snipe<00:00:05.940> and<00:00:06.180> tutorial<00:00:06.870> video<00:00:07.259> let<00:00:08.069> me<00:00:08.099> go

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
snipe and tutorial video let me go

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.490 
snipe and tutorial video let me go
through<00:00:08.429> various<00:00:08.940> aspects<00:00:09.570> of<00:00:09.719> sniping<00:00:10.410> in

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
through various aspects of sniping in

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.320 
through various aspects of sniping in
general<00:00:10.980> with<00:00:11.160> different<00:00:11.460> attachments<00:00:12.150> and

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
general with different attachments and

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.860 
general with different attachments and
then<00:00:12.929> some<00:00:13.139> more<00:00:13.170> advanced<00:00:13.860> techniques<00:00:14.009> for

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:14.870 
then some more advanced techniques for

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:18.830 
then some more advanced techniques for
quick<00:00:15.870> scope<00:00:16.139> is<00:00:16.320> at<00:00:16.440> the<00:00:16.560> end<00:00:17.180> so<00:00:18.180> we're<00:00:18.630> going

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
quick scope is at the end so we're going

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.470 
quick scope is at the end so we're going
to<00:00:18.930> start<00:00:19.170> off<00:00:19.350> here<00:00:19.619> with<00:00:20.220> the<00:00:20.580> regular<00:00:21.090> scope

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
to start off here with the regular scope

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.120 
to start off here with the regular scope
scope<00:00:22.020> in<00:00:22.260> x<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:24.090> scope<00:00:24.480> in<00:00:24.660> time<00:00:24.869> is<00:00:25.050> not

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.130 
scope in x and the scope in time is not

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.640 
scope in x and the scope in time is not
0.82<00:00:26.160> and<00:00:26.449> that's<00:00:27.449> for<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:27.869> actual<00:00:28.199> scope<00:00:28.439> to

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
0.82 and that's for the actual scope to

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.580 
0.82 and that's for the actual scope to
be<00:00:28.680> brought<00:00:29.189> up<00:00:29.429> and<00:00:29.670> from<00:00:30.179> there<00:00:30.390> it's<00:00:31.109> an

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
be brought up and from there it's an

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.049 
be brought up and from there it's an
additional<00:00:32.450> point<00:00:33.710> one<00:00:34.710> three<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.670> idle

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
additional point one three to the idle

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.270 
additional point one three to the idle
sway<00:00:36.180> so<00:00:36.329> 0.95<00:00:37.170> all<00:00:37.410> together<00:00:37.559> to<00:00:37.860> get<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.160> the

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
sway so 0.95 all together to get to the

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.080 
sway so 0.95 all together to get to the
idle<00:00:38.579> sway<00:00:38.670> stage<00:00:39.530> the<00:00:40.530> ACOG<00:00:41.129> then<00:00:41.399> it's<00:00:41.879> a

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
idle sway stage the ACOG then it's a

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.979 
idle sway stage the ACOG then it's a
point<00:00:42.510> one<00:00:43.640> scoping<00:00:44.640> time<00:00:44.850> which<00:00:45.030> is<00:00:45.180> much

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
point one scoping time which is much

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.080 
point one scoping time which is much
faster<00:00:46.289> significantly<00:00:47.280> faster<00:00:47.520> than<00:00:47.879> with

the other scopes the problem with the
ACOG<00:00:50.280> though<00:00:50.520> is<00:00:50.730> it<00:00:51.120> doesn't<00:00:51.360> truly

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
ACOG though is it doesn't truly

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.080 
ACOG though is it doesn't truly
represent<00:00:52.800> where<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.100> scope<00:00:53.340> is<00:00:53.579> it<00:00:53.789> doesn't

show<00:00:54.329> you<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.690> random<00:00:55.110> stage<00:00:55.379> so<00:00:55.680> if<00:00:55.770> you<00:00:55.890> try

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
show you the random stage so if you try

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.950 
show you the random stage so if you try
and<00:00:56.250> shoot<00:00:56.430> too<00:00:56.640> fast<00:00:56.969> your<00:00:57.210> bullet<00:00:57.539> will<00:00:57.719> fly

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
and shoot too fast your bullet will fly

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.049 
and shoot too fast your bullet will fly
off<00:00:58.140> in<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.320> random<00:00:58.620> direction<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:59.760> use<00:00:59.940> the

off in a random direction to use the

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.790 
off in a random direction to use the
ACOG<00:01:00.420> scope<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:00.870> quick<00:01:01.020> scope<00:01:01.260> you<00:01:01.410> really

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
ACOG scope and quick scope you really

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.310 
ACOG scope and quick scope you really
have<00:01:01.949> to<00:01:02.129> be<00:01:02.940> on<00:01:03.090> top<00:01:03.329> of<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.600> your<00:01:03.809> timings

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
have to be on top of the your timings

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.870 
have to be on top of the your timings
and<00:01:04.470> know<00:01:04.559> exactly<00:01:05.100> when<00:01:05.369> things<00:01:05.640> are<00:01:05.790> going

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
and know exactly when things are going

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.420 
and know exactly when things are going
to<00:01:05.970> happen<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:07.140> infrared<00:01:07.500> sight<00:01:07.830> then<00:01:08.070> this

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
to happen the infrared sight then this

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.270 
to happen the infrared sight then this
actually<00:01:08.760> acts<00:01:09.260> exactly<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.439> same<00:01:10.650> as<00:01:10.920> the

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
actually acts exactly the same as the

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.420 
actually acts exactly the same as the
regular<00:01:11.520> scope<00:01:12.090> so<00:01:13.080> I<00:01:13.439> won't<00:01:13.740> bring<00:01:13.920> up<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.189> x

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
regular scope so I won't bring up the x

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.010 
regular scope so I won't bring up the x
again<00:01:14.640> you<00:01:15.090> can<00:01:15.240> just<00:01:15.390> go<00:01:15.479> back<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:15.689> check

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
again you can just go back and check

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.710 
again you can just go back and check
that<00:01:16.200> it's<00:01:16.439> exactly<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:17.040> same<00:01:17.250> though

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
that it's exactly the same though

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.940 
that it's exactly the same though
the<00:01:18.720> variable<00:01:19.170> scope<00:01:19.380> then<00:01:19.619> there's<00:01:19.799> been<00:01:19.920> a

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
the variable scope then there's been a

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.399 
the variable scope then there's been a
lot<00:01:20.130> of<00:01:20.360> preconceptions<00:01:21.360> about<00:01:21.869> this<00:01:22.080> and

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
lot of preconceptions about this and

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.410 
lot of preconceptions about this and
maybe<00:01:22.590> misconceptions<00:01:23.520> it's<00:01:24.030> actually

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
maybe misconceptions it's actually

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.179 
maybe misconceptions it's actually
actually<00:01:24.570> exactly<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.530> same<00:01:25.740> as<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.040> regular

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
actually exactly the same as the regular

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.749 
actually exactly the same as the regular
scope<00:01:27.979> basically<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.130> only<00:01:29.280> difference<00:01:29.610> is

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
scope basically the only difference is

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.179 
scope basically the only difference is
it's<00:01:30.000> a<00:01:30.090> matter<00:01:30.270> of<00:01:30.360> preference<00:01:30.689> it<00:01:31.229> brings<00:01:31.979> up

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
it's a matter of preference it brings up

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.280 
it's a matter of preference it brings up
a<00:01:32.310> bit<00:01:32.490> different<00:01:32.939> but<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.450> scope<00:01:33.689> in<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.170> the

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
a bit different but the scope in and the

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.440 
a bit different but the scope in and the
time<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:34.650> either<00:01:34.770> sway<00:01:35.130> exactly<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.240> same

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
time to either sway exactly the same

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.319 
time to either sway exactly the same
guys<00:01:36.750> I've<00:01:37.439> tested<00:01:37.890> this<00:01:38.009> out<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.520> I've<00:01:39.060> timed

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
guys I've tested this out and I've timed

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.560 
guys I've tested this out and I've timed
it<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:39.900> it<00:01:40.409> is<00:01:40.500> exactly<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.130> same<00:01:41.310> so<00:01:41.759> that's

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
it and it is exactly the same so that's

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.859 
it and it is exactly the same so that's
that<00:01:42.899> one<00:01:43.140> sort<00:01:43.409> of<00:01:43.439> cleared<00:01:44.009> out<00:01:44.189> for<00:01:44.460> you

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
that one sort of cleared out for you

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:47.569 
that one sort of cleared out for you
next<00:01:45.869> we're<00:01:46.049> going<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.229> move<00:01:46.380> on<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:47.189> idle

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579

next we're going to move on to the idle
sway<00:01:47.729> there's<00:01:48.119> been<00:01:48.329> a<00:01:48.360> bit<00:01:48.600> of<00:01:48.689> a<00:01:48.750> rumor<00:01:49.049> going

Scott without scout so you can see there
is<00:01:57.030> lined<00:01:57.360> up<00:01:57.540> with<00:01:57.689> that<00:01:57.719> sort<00:01:57.960> of<00:01:58.140> line<00:01:58.409> on

the shed door the the bunker door there
I'll<00:02:01.350> ask<00:02:01.560> that's<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.130> furthest<00:02:02.579> right<00:02:03.140> so

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
I'll ask that's the furthest right so

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.389 
I'll ask that's the furthest right so
you<00:02:04.229> can<00:02:04.350> see<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.530> furthest<00:02:04.890> right<00:02:05.070> on<00:02:05.250> that

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
you can see the furthest right on that

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:06.800 
you can see the furthest right on that

that is the same moving on then to

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.050 
that is the same moving on then to
steady<00:02:24.739> aim<00:02:24.950> I've<00:02:25.340> made<00:02:25.580> these<00:02:25.730> kind<00:02:25.970> of

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
steady aim I've made these kind of

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.530 
steady aim I've made these kind of
blobby

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
blobby

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.000

but<00:02:26.870> that<00:02:27.050> steady<00:02:27.319> eight<00:02:27.500> that's<00:02:27.890> without

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
but that steady eight that's without

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.860 
but that steady eight that's without
steady<00:02:28.370> aim<00:02:28.550> this<00:02:28.760> is<00:02:28.940> with<00:02:29.150> steady<00:02:29.480> aim<00:02:29.660> and

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
steady aim this is with steady aim and

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.380 
steady aim this is with steady aim and
the<00:02:30.349> statistic<00:02:30.950> is<00:02:31.099> actually<00:02:31.550> to<00:02:31.819> point<00:02:32.120> to

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
the statistic is actually to point to

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.449 
the statistic is actually to point to
that<00:02:33.170> may<00:02:33.440> not<00:02:33.650> mean<00:02:33.830> much<00:02:33.860> to<00:02:34.190> you<00:02:34.250> but<00:02:34.280> it

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
that may not mean much to you but it

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:35.860 
that may not mean much to you but it
basically<00:02:34.550> means<00:02:35.000> you're<00:02:35.209> no<00:02:35.360> scopes<00:02:35.660> are

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
basically means you're no scopes are

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.530 
basically means you're no scopes are

twice as likely to hit moving on now to
hardened<00:02:39.260> I've<00:02:39.830> done<00:02:39.980> a<00:02:40.010> bit<00:02:40.160> of<00:02:40.190> split-screen

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
hardened I've done a bit of split-screen

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.030 
hardened I've done a bit of split-screen
here<00:02:40.910> so<00:02:41.060> you<00:02:41.180> guys<00:02:41.390> can<00:02:41.450> see<00:02:42.040> what's

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
here so you guys can see what's

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.559 
here so you guys can see what's
happening<00:02:43.310> the<00:02:43.459> top<00:02:43.670> screen<00:02:43.970> doesn't<00:02:44.330> have

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.569 
happening the top screen doesn't have

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:46.840 
happening the top screen doesn't have
harden<00:02:44.930> at<00:02:45.019> the<00:02:45.110> bottom<00:02:45.410> screen<00:02:45.530> does<00:02:45.950> so<00:02:46.610> who

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
harden at the bottom screen does so who

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.030 
harden at the bottom screen does so who
this<00:02:47.290> reconstituted<00:02:48.290> would<00:02:48.500> it<00:02:48.650> takes<00:02:48.830> two

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
this reconstituted would it takes two

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.400 
this reconstituted would it takes two
hits<00:02:49.280> with<00:02:49.430> hardened<00:02:49.819> and<00:02:50.630> it<00:02:50.840> was<00:02:51.019> it<00:02:51.170> takes

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
hits with hardened and it was it takes

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.190 
hits with hardened and it was it takes
well<00:02:51.950> two<00:02:52.250> hits<00:02:52.519> without<00:02:52.880> so<00:02:53.630> you<00:02:53.870> can<00:02:54.080> just

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
well two hits without so you can just

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.839 
well two hits without so you can just
see<00:02:54.350> that<00:02:54.470> they're<00:02:56.530> good<00:02:57.560> two<00:02:58.370> shots<00:02:58.640> without

00:02:58.839 --> 00:02:58.849 
see that they're good two shots without

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:01.479 
see that they're good two shots without
hardened<00:02:59.390> and<00:02:59.660> with<00:02:59.870> hardened<00:03:00.349> it<00:03:01.099> is<00:03:01.459> a

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
hardened and with hardened it is a

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:05.229 
hardened and with hardened it is a
one-hit<00:03:02.120> kill<00:03:02.530> in<00:03:03.530> this<00:03:03.799> metal<00:03:04.310> here<00:03:04.580> it's

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
one-hit kill in this metal here it's

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.830 
one-hit kill in this metal here it's
actually<00:03:05.650> impenetrable<00:03:07.150> surprisingly<00:03:08.150> you

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
actually impenetrable surprisingly you

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.270 
actually impenetrable surprisingly you
can<00:03:08.959> see<00:03:09.110> that<00:03:09.290> I'm<00:03:09.380> aiming<00:03:09.500> right<00:03:09.950> above

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
can see that I'm aiming right above

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.680 
can see that I'm aiming right above
where<00:03:10.340> his<00:03:10.549> hand<00:03:10.790> is<00:03:10.910> poking<00:03:11.330> through<00:03:11.480> the

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
where his hand is poking through the

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.020 
where his hand is poking through the
wall<00:03:11.870> and<00:03:12.140> right<00:03:12.860> below<00:03:13.069> nothing<00:03:13.880> goes

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
wall and right below nothing goes

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.830 
wall and right below nothing goes
through<00:03:14.060> that<00:03:14.510> this<00:03:15.470> is<00:03:15.650> just<00:03:15.799> a<00:03:15.859> few<00:03:16.040> examples

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
through that this is just a few examples

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.259 
through that this is just a few examples
but<00:03:17.840> hardened<00:03:18.530> pro<00:03:18.850> makes<00:03:19.850> a<00:03:19.940> little<00:03:20.060> bit<00:03:20.209> of

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
but hardened pro makes a little bit of

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:22.120 
but hardened pro makes a little bit of
difference<00:03:20.510> I<00:03:20.600> guess<00:03:20.630> then<00:03:20.930> so<00:03:21.109> recapping<00:03:21.799> the

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
difference I guess then so recapping the

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.550 
difference I guess then so recapping the
thick<00:03:22.459> the<00:03:22.820> yeah<00:03:23.209> the<00:03:23.390> thicker<00:03:23.630> wood<00:03:23.930> was

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
thick the yeah the thicker wood was

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.680 
thick the yeah the thicker wood was
hardened<00:03:24.950> one<00:03:25.160> shot<00:03:25.459> and<00:03:25.670> no<00:03:26.030> hardened<00:03:26.390> two

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
hardened one shot and no hardened two

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.229 
hardened one shot and no hardened two
shots<00:03:26.989> he<00:03:27.380> metal<00:03:27.650> was<00:03:27.890> impenetrable<00:03:28.310> and<00:03:28.819> the

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
shots he metal was impenetrable and the

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:31.240 
shots he metal was impenetrable and the
reconstituted<00:03:29.959> wood<00:03:30.290> with<00:03:30.500> two<00:03:30.709> shots<00:03:31.010> with

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
reconstituted wood with two shots with

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.360 
reconstituted wood with two shots with
either<00:03:32.500> so<00:03:33.500> now<00:03:33.620> we've<00:03:33.799> moved<00:03:34.010> on<00:03:34.130> to<00:03:34.220> some

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
either so now we've moved on to some

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:35.830 
either so now we've moved on to some
quick<00:03:34.609> scoping<00:03:34.970> and<00:03:35.120> this<00:03:35.450> is<00:03:35.540> gonna<00:03:35.660> be<00:03:35.810> a

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
quick scoping and this is gonna be a

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.300 
quick scoping and this is gonna be a
straight<00:03:36.350> shot<00:03:36.620> so<00:03:36.890> this<00:03:36.980> is<00:03:37.069> when<00:03:37.190> your

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
straight shot so this is when your

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.520 
straight shot so this is when your
target<00:03:37.640> stood<00:03:37.940> still<00:03:38.269> or<00:03:38.480> running<00:03:39.140> towards

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
target stood still or running towards

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.280 
target stood still or running towards
you<00:03:39.620> or<00:03:39.799> away<00:03:39.829> from<00:03:40.100> you<00:03:40.720> when<00:03:41.720> you<00:03:41.810> scope<00:03:42.079> in

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
you or away from you when you scope in

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.559 
you or away from you when you scope in
you<00:03:42.769> get<00:03:42.950> the<00:03:43.040> random<00:03:43.370> stage<00:03:43.639> and<00:03:43.970> the<00:03:44.180> drag<00:03:44.389> up

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:44.569 
you get the random stage and the drag up

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:46.539 
you get the random stage and the drag up
straight<00:03:44.989> into<00:03:45.260> your<00:03:45.350> target<00:03:45.769> just<00:03:46.040> as<00:03:46.190> before

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
straight into your target just as before

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:48.309 
straight into your target just as before
in<00:03:46.639> my<00:03:46.730> previous<00:03:46.760> video<00:03:47.510> I'll<00:03:47.690> show<00:03:47.870> again<00:03:48.200> in

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:48.319 
in my previous video I'll show again in

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.879 
in my previous video I'll show again in
slow-motion

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:48.889 
slow-motion

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:51.789 
slow-motion
random<00:03:49.430> stage<00:03:49.750> drags<00:03:50.750> up<00:03:50.989> straight<00:03:51.410> it's<00:03:51.680> one

00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:51.799 
random stage drags up straight it's one

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:53.210 
random stage drags up straight it's one
of<00:03:51.829> your<00:03:51.980> target

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
of your target

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:58.730 
of your target
brings<00:03:53.880> him<00:03:54.060> down<00:03:54.530> so<00:03:56.330> as<00:03:57.330> you<00:03:57.480> can<00:03:57.570> see<00:03:57.630> if<00:03:58.530> he

00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:58.740 
brings him down so as you can see if he

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.710 
brings him down so as you can see if he
was<00:03:58.830> moving<00:03:59.130> you<00:03:59.970> know<00:04:00.090> what<00:04:00.210> target<00:04:00.630> would

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
was moving you know what target would

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.510 
was moving you know what target would
actually<00:04:01.140> you<00:04:01.650> at<00:04:01.800> the<00:04:01.920> center<00:04:02.100> of<00:04:02.310> your

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:02.520 
actually you at the center of your

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.370 
actually you at the center of your
crosshairs<00:04:03.150> wouldn't<00:04:03.510> end<00:04:03.660> up<00:04:03.750> in<00:04:03.930> the<00:04:04.050> target

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
crosshairs wouldn't end up in the target

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:05.680 
crosshairs wouldn't end up in the target
that's<00:04:04.620> where<00:04:04.770> I'm<00:04:04.830> going<00:04:04.980> to<00:04:05.040> show<00:04:05.190> you<00:04:05.250> next

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690 
that's where I'm going to show you next

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.020 
that's where I'm going to show you next
what<00:04:06.690> we<00:04:07.230> got<00:04:07.380> never<00:04:07.590> there's<00:04:08.490> more<00:04:08.670> of<00:04:08.730> a<00:04:08.790> drag

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
what we got never there's more of a drag

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.570 
what we got never there's more of a drag
scope<00:04:09.420> so<00:04:09.570> yeah<00:04:09.660> readjust<00:04:10.290> and<00:04:10.590> then<00:04:11.310> I<00:04:11.340> bring

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 
scope so yeah readjust and then I bring

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.550 
scope so yeah readjust and then I bring
it<00:04:11.700> over<00:04:11.910> to<00:04:12.000> the<00:04:12.090> left<00:04:12.300> so<00:04:13.080> that's<00:04:13.260> dragging

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
it over to the left so that's dragging

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.280 
it over to the left so that's dragging
on<00:04:13.920> to<00:04:14.130> a<00:04:14.160> moving<00:04:14.340> on<00:04:15.000> to<00:04:15.120> a<00:04:15.150> standing<00:04:15.960> steel

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
on to a moving on to a standing steel

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.009 
on to a moving on to a standing steel
target<00:04:16.829> so<00:04:17.370> if<00:04:17.459> you<00:04:17.549> aim<00:04:17.730> in<00:04:17.970> not<00:04:18.420> centrally<00:04:18.900> to

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
target so if you aim in not centrally to

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.229 
target so if you aim in not centrally to
the<00:04:19.140> target<00:04:19.470> you<00:04:19.530> need<00:04:19.709> to<00:04:19.799> readjust<00:04:20.100> and<00:04:21.060> if

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
the target you need to readjust and if

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:22.490 
the target you need to readjust and if
you<00:04:21.329> stand<00:04:21.540> then<00:04:21.750> still<00:04:21.959> they'll<00:04:22.109> actually<00:04:22.260> be

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
you stand then still they'll actually be

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.890 
you stand then still they'll actually be
not<00:04:22.770> too<00:04:22.980> difficult<00:04:23.220> to<00:04:23.610> do<00:04:23.790> trouble<00:04:24.660> comes

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
not too difficult to do trouble comes

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.480 
not too difficult to do trouble comes
when<00:04:25.200> you've<00:04:25.410> got<00:04:25.620> to<00:04:25.800> hit<00:04:26.070> a<00:04:26.100> moving<00:04:26.430> target

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
when you've got to hit a moving target

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.120 
when you've got to hit a moving target
and<00:04:27.120> this<00:04:27.900> is<00:04:27.990> a<00:04:28.080> good<00:04:28.230> example<00:04:28.350> of<00:04:28.800> it<00:04:28.860> right

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
and this is a good example of it right

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.560 
and this is a good example of it right
here<00:04:30.050> so<00:04:31.050> I'm<00:04:31.110> going<00:04:31.260> to<00:04:31.290> pause<00:04:31.500> it<00:04:31.650> here<00:04:31.680> and

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
here so I'm going to pause it here and

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:35.600 
here so I'm going to pause it here and
sort<00:04:33.570> of<00:04:33.630> explain<00:04:34.110> a<00:04:34.170> few<00:04:34.380> things<00:04:34.440> I<00:04:34.890> Paul<00:04:35.520> is

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
sort of explain a few things I Paul is

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.610 
sort of explain a few things I Paul is
it<00:04:35.730> exactly<00:04:36.270> when<00:04:36.450> I<00:04:36.480> start<00:04:36.870> scoping<00:04:37.170> in<00:04:37.440> and

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
it exactly when I start scoping in and

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.260 
it exactly when I start scoping in and
if<00:04:37.860> you<00:04:38.070> can<00:04:38.220> see<00:04:38.430> that<00:04:38.580> the<00:04:38.760> cross<00:04:38.970> hairs<00:04:39.180> have

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
if you can see that the cross hairs have

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:40.670 
if you can see that the cross hairs have
actually<00:04:39.510> gone<00:04:39.660> red<00:04:40.050> for<00:04:40.320> those<00:04:40.410> of<00:04:40.530> you<00:04:40.590> that

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
actually gone red for those of you that

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.770 
actually gone red for those of you that
don't<00:04:41.040> know<00:04:41.280> this<00:04:41.610> already<00:04:41.790> I'm<00:04:42.120> sure<00:04:42.360> you

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
don't know this already I'm sure you

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.690 
don't know this already I'm sure you
would<00:04:42.960> do<00:04:43.110> when<00:04:43.890> your<00:04:44.040> central<00:04:44.520> to<00:04:44.610> your

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
would do when your central to your

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.640 
would do when your central to your
target<00:04:45.150> your<00:04:45.480> crosshairs<00:04:45.870> will<00:04:46.020> go<00:04:46.230> red<00:04:46.440> this

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
target your crosshairs will go red this

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.260 
target your crosshairs will go red this
is<00:04:46.710> the<00:04:46.860> point<00:04:47.130> where<00:04:47.250> I<00:04:47.280> start<00:04:47.610> to<00:04:47.760> scope<00:04:48.060> in

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
is the point where I start to scope in

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.540 
is the point where I start to scope in
now<00:04:49.200> because<00:04:49.320> the<00:04:49.560> target<00:04:49.919> is<00:04:50.010> running<00:04:50.310> to<00:04:50.430> my

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
now because the target is running to my

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.900 
now because the target is running to my
right<00:04:50.790> hand<00:04:51.000> side<00:04:51.240> if<00:04:52.169> I<00:04:52.500> just<00:04:52.710> held<00:04:53.310> l1<00:04:53.700> and

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910 
right hand side if I just held l1 and

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.420 
right hand side if I just held l1 and
nothing<00:04:54.210> else<00:04:54.360> by<00:04:54.960> the<00:04:55.020> time<00:04:55.320> the<00:04:55.680> cross<00:04:56.220> head

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
nothing else by the time the cross head

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.820 
nothing else by the time the cross head
had<00:04:56.610> centered<00:04:57.060> he<00:04:58.020> would<00:04:58.169> have<00:04:58.290> been<00:04:58.500> to<00:04:58.710> my

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830 
had centered he would have been to my

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:00.409 
had centered he would have been to my
right<00:04:59.010> side<00:04:59.340> in<00:04:59.520> the<00:04:59.580> shuttle<00:04:59.910> miss

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:00.419 
right side in the shuttle miss

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:02.570 
right side in the shuttle miss
so<00:05:01.080> there's<00:05:01.260> several<00:05:01.410> ways<00:05:01.590> of<00:05:01.950> sort<00:05:02.550> of

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
so there's several ways of sort of

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.370 
so there's several ways of sort of
counteracting<00:05:03.270> this<00:05:03.510> I<00:05:03.630> guess<00:05:03.810> you<00:05:03.990> could<00:05:04.140> say

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:04.380 
counteracting this I guess you could say

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.550 
counteracting this I guess you could say
one<00:05:05.280> would<00:05:05.490> be<00:05:05.640> to<00:05:05.970> drag<00:05:06.330> the<00:05:06.570> scope<00:05:06.840> as<00:05:07.050> you're

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
one would be to drag the scope as you're

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.340 
one would be to drag the scope as you're
zooming<00:05:07.950> in<00:05:08.160> so<00:05:08.400> you<00:05:08.970> actually<00:05:09.360> move<00:05:09.870> your<00:05:10.169> aim

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:10.350 
zooming in so you actually move your aim

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:14.300 
zooming in so you actually move your aim
and<00:05:10.790> as<00:05:12.169> he's<00:05:13.169> as<00:05:13.470> he's<00:05:13.740> running<00:05:13.919> across

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
and as he's as he's running across

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:16.159 
and as he's as he's running across
readjust<00:05:15.090> you're<00:05:15.690> gonna<00:05:15.810> have<00:05:15.990> to<00:05:16.080> have

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:16.169 
readjust you're gonna have to have

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:18.230 
readjust you're gonna have to have
pretty<00:05:16.470> quick<00:05:16.710> reaction<00:05:17.160> times<00:05:17.370> and<00:05:17.610> a<00:05:17.669> really

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
pretty quick reaction times and a really

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.030 
pretty quick reaction times and a really
sort<00:05:18.479> of<00:05:18.540> subtle<00:05:19.020> touch<00:05:19.260> of<00:05:19.470> the<00:05:19.590> stick<00:05:19.860> you're

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:20.040 
sort of subtle touch of the stick you're

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.170 
sort of subtle touch of the stick you're
gonna<00:05:20.130> have<00:05:20.280> to<00:05:20.370> be<00:05:20.430> pretty<00:05:20.669> accurate<00:05:21.150> with

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 
gonna have to be pretty accurate with

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.960 
gonna have to be pretty accurate with
your<00:05:21.270> sniper<00:05:21.570> to<00:05:22.140> do<00:05:22.290> this<00:05:22.520> the<00:05:23.520> other<00:05:23.640> one<00:05:23.820> is

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:23.970 
your sniper to do this the other one is

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:25.550 
your sniper to do this the other one is
more<00:05:24.180> of<00:05:24.240> a<00:05:24.330> drag<00:05:24.630> scope<00:05:25.050> like<00:05:25.229> modern<00:05:25.500> warfare

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 
more of a drag scope like modern warfare

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.730 
more of a drag scope like modern warfare
2<00:05:25.800> so<00:05:26.130> you<00:05:26.190> wait<00:05:26.340> to<00:05:26.460> your<00:05:26.610> scope<00:05:26.910> is<00:05:27.150> fully

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:27.740 
2 so you wait to your scope is fully

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:30.050 
2 so you wait to your scope is fully
scoped<00:05:28.740> in<00:05:28.950> and<00:05:29.190> you've<00:05:29.370> got<00:05:29.400> the<00:05:29.580> crosshairs

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 
scoped in and you've got the crosshairs

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:33.350 
scoped in and you've got the crosshairs
and<00:05:30.630> then<00:05:30.750> as<00:05:30.930> the<00:05:31.430> idle<00:05:32.430> sway<00:05:32.520> stage<00:05:32.910> is<00:05:33.120> being

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 
and then as the idle sway stage is being

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.050 
and then as the idle sway stage is being
brought<00:05:33.660> up<00:05:33.860> you<00:05:34.860> continue<00:05:35.370> to<00:05:35.520> drag<00:05:35.760> it<00:05:35.970> in

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:36.060 
brought up you continue to drag it in

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:37.310 
brought up you continue to drag it in
the<00:05:36.120> direction<00:05:36.270> that<00:05:36.660> your<00:05:36.810> target<00:05:37.140> is

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:37.320 
the direction that your target is

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.650 
the direction that your target is
running<00:05:37.710> and<00:05:37.950> it<00:05:38.040> should<00:05:38.250> bring<00:05:38.520> it<00:05:38.790> up<00:05:38.910> a<00:05:39.180> good

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:39.660 
running and it should bring it up a good

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:41.630 
running and it should bring it up a good
sniper<00:05:39.870> should<00:05:40.200> be<00:05:40.290> able<00:05:40.380> to<00:05:40.470> do<00:05:40.650> either<00:05:40.860> and<00:05:41.250> a

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:41.640 
sniper should be able to do either and a

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.670 
sniper should be able to do either and a
lot<00:05:41.850> of<00:05:41.880> times<00:05:42.180> both<00:05:42.570> which<00:05:43.320> is<00:05:43.470> what<00:05:43.650> I

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 
lot of times both which is what I

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.730 
lot of times both which is what I
actually<00:05:43.979> managed<00:05:44.370> to<00:05:44.550> do<00:05:44.700> here<00:05:44.930> so<00:05:45.930> I'm<00:05:46.590> gonna

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.740 
actually managed to do here so I'm gonna

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.850 
actually managed to do here so I'm gonna
play<00:05:47.220> the<00:05:47.460> tape<00:05:47.760> now<00:05:48.450> we'll<00:05:48.780> just<00:05:49.110> about<00:05:49.320> now

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 
play the tape now we'll just about now

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:53.680 
play the tape now we'll just about now
and<00:05:49.950> you<00:05:50.400> see<00:05:50.750> how<00:05:51.750> I<00:05:51.780> managed<00:05:52.140> to<00:05:52.200> adjust<00:05:52.560> it

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:53.690 
and you see how I managed to adjust it

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:56.120 
and you see how I managed to adjust it
so<00:05:54.690> I<00:05:54.720> start<00:05:55.110> moving<00:05:55.380> in<00:05:55.470> a<00:05:55.560> little<00:05:55.740> bit<00:05:55.950> before

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:56.130 
so I start moving in a little bit before

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:58.010 
so I start moving in a little bit before
the<00:05:56.340> scope<00:05:56.550> comes<00:05:56.790> up<00:05:56.970> and<00:05:57.150> then<00:05:57.419> continue<00:05:57.990> to

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.020 
the scope comes up and then continue to

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:00.840 
the scope comes up and then continue to
move<00:05:58.260> it<00:05:58.440> to<00:05:58.530> the<00:05:58.650> right<00:05:58.830> as<00:05:59.070> the<00:05:59.250> random

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:00.850 
move it to the right as the random

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:06.000 
move it to the right as the random
and<00:06:01.180> land<00:06:01.480> a<00:06:01.600> nice<00:06:01.810> heaven<00:06:02.200> my<00:06:02.290> target<00:06:05.010> there's

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:06.010 
and land a nice heaven my target there's

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:08.210 
and land a nice heaven my target there's
net<00:06:06.220> vendors<00:06:06.850> of<00:06:06.940> target<00:06:07.270> going<00:06:07.450> left<00:06:07.690> and

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:08.220 
net vendors of target going left and

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.530 
net vendors of target going left and
I'll<00:06:09.220> play<00:06:09.430> the<00:06:09.580> clip<00:06:09.730> and<00:06:09.910> slow<00:06:10.120> moving<00:06:10.300> in

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:10.540 
I'll play the clip and slow moving in

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:14.460 
I'll play the clip and slow moving in
this<00:06:10.660> one<00:06:10.930> is<00:06:11.110> really<00:06:12.010> clear<00:06:12.310> that<00:06:13.230> I'll<00:06:14.230> pause

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:14.470 
this one is really clear that I'll pause

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:16.770 
this one is really clear that I'll pause
it<00:06:14.680> there<00:06:14.710> you<00:06:14.980> see<00:06:15.160> I'm<00:06:15.970> actually<00:06:16.180> starting

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:16.780 
it there you see I'm actually starting

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:18.720 
it there you see I'm actually starting
slide<00:06:17.410> to<00:06:17.590> the<00:06:17.680> right<00:06:17.890> of<00:06:18.040> my<00:06:18.160> target<00:06:18.610> so<00:06:18.670> I'm

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:18.730 
slide to the right of my target so I'm

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:20.250 
slide to the right of my target so I'm
gonna<00:06:18.880> make<00:06:19.030> more<00:06:19.330> of<00:06:19.450> an<00:06:19.540> adjustment<00:06:19.660> and<00:06:20.200> you

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:20.260 
gonna make more of an adjustment and you

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.590 
gonna make more of an adjustment and you
really<00:06:20.560> see<00:06:20.740> here<00:06:20.860> like<00:06:21.010> I<00:06:21.160> was<00:06:21.280> saying<00:06:21.570> that<00:06:22.570> I

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:22.600 
really see here like I was saying that I

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:25.440 
really see here like I was saying that I
move<00:06:22.930> before<00:06:23.230> I'm<00:06:23.980> actually<00:06:24.490> scoped<00:06:25.030> in<00:06:25.240> there

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:25.450 
move before I'm actually scoped in there

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:27.870 
move before I'm actually scoped in there
see<00:06:25.690> I<00:06:25.720> moved<00:06:26.110> the<00:06:26.350> scope<00:06:26.890> of<00:06:27.070> forum<00:06:27.340> scoped<00:06:27.730> in

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:27.880 
see I moved the scope of forum scoped in

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:31.110 
see I moved the scope of forum scoped in
it<00:06:28.180> drags<00:06:28.840> up<00:06:29.080> into<00:06:29.440> the<00:06:29.530> middle<00:06:29.770> and<00:06:30.120> targets

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:31.120 
it drags up into the middle and targets

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:34.980 
it drags up into the middle and targets
centered<00:06:31.590> it<00:06:32.590> does<00:06:32.860> is<00:06:33.220> trickier<00:06:33.880> but<00:06:34.120> it<00:06:34.810> is

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:34.990 
centered it does is trickier but it is

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:36.960 
centered it does is trickier but it is
manageable<00:06:35.620> so<00:06:36.130> this<00:06:36.250> is<00:06:36.370> demonstrating<00:06:36.940> a

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:36.970 
manageable so this is demonstrating a

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:39.570 
manageable so this is demonstrating a
long<00:06:37.180> shot<00:06:37.480> now<00:06:37.740> and<00:06:38.740> long<00:06:38.920> shots<00:06:39.190> are<00:06:39.340> much

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:39.580 
long shot now and long shots are much

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:42.180 
long shot now and long shots are much
harder<00:06:39.880> and<00:06:40.710> similarly<00:06:41.710> to<00:06:41.860> modern<00:06:42.130> warfare

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:42.190 
harder and similarly to modern warfare

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:44.220 
harder and similarly to modern warfare
to<00:06:42.580> long<00:06:42.820> shots<00:06:43.090> really<00:06:43.420> because<00:06:43.750> you've<00:06:43.900> got

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:44.230 
to long shots really because you've got

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:46.050 
to long shots really because you've got
to<00:06:44.350> take<00:06:44.530> into<00:06:44.710> account<00:06:44.980> the<00:06:45.190> idle<00:06:45.550> sway<00:06:45.700> and

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:46.060 
to take into account the idle sway and

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:48.630 
to take into account the idle sway and
even<00:06:46.600> in<00:06:46.690> modern<00:06:46.930> warfare<00:06:47.050> 2<00:06:47.260> you<00:06:47.710> can't<00:06:47.980> is

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:48.640 
even in modern warfare 2 you can't is

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:50.430 
even in modern warfare 2 you can't is
very<00:06:49.060> difficult<00:06:49.420> to<00:06:49.600> judge<00:06:49.810> the<00:06:49.840> idle<00:06:50.290> sway

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:50.440 
very difficult to judge the idle sway

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.320 
very difficult to judge the idle sway
and<00:06:50.800> for<00:06:51.070> longer<00:06:51.250> shots<00:06:51.520> for<00:06:51.730> those<00:06:51.820> the<00:06:52.150> quick

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:52.330 
and for longer shots for those the quick

scope<00:06:52.570> to<00:06:52.720> modern<00:06:52.960> warfare<00:06:53.080> 2<00:06:53.260> you<00:06:53.530> guys<00:06:53.980> will

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:54.220 
scope to modern warfare 2 you guys will

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:55.980 
scope to modern warfare 2 you guys will
know<00:06:54.400> that<00:06:54.430> long<00:06:55.210> shots<00:06:55.480> are<00:06:55.660> hard<00:06:55.870> because

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:55.990 
know that long shots are hard because

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:57.180 
know that long shots are hard because
you've<00:06:56.200> got<00:06:56.290> to<00:06:56.380> judge<00:06:56.530> the<00:06:56.680> early<00:06:56.860> fair<00:06:57.040> what

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:57.190 
you've got to judge the early fair what

00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:59.520 
you've got to judge the early fair what
I'll<00:06:57.280> suggest<00:06:57.490> is<00:06:57.940> just<00:06:58.630> put<00:06:58.990> a<00:06:59.020> little<00:06:59.350> bit

00:06:59.520 --> 00:06:59.530 
I'll suggest is just put a little bit

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:02.670 
I'll suggest is just put a little bit
more<00:06:59.710> time<00:06:59.980> and<00:07:00.810> allow<00:07:01.810> yourself<00:07:02.020> just<00:07:02.500> an

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:02.680 
more time and allow yourself just an
