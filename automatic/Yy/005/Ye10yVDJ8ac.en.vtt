some might say well it doesn't really
make<00:00:41.160> sense<00:00:41.430> for<00:00:41.579> today's<00:00:41.910> 4x4<00:00:42.660> environment

or<00:00:43.740> you<00:00:43.860> have<00:00:43.980> to<00:00:44.070> have<00:00:44.160> fuel<00:00:44.400> economy<00:00:44.670> and

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
or you have to have fuel economy and

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.480 
or you have to have fuel economy and
you've<00:00:45.630> got<00:00:45.780> soccer<00:00:46.020> moms<00:00:46.530> riding<00:00:47.130> in<00:00:47.340> these

things now so by 2015 land rover is

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.490 
things now so by 2015 land rover is
gonna<00:00:50.490> be<00:00:50.610> making<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:50.970> new<00:00:51.120> defender<00:00:51.600> in<00:00:52.230> this

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
gonna be making a new defender in this

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.520 
gonna be making a new defender in this
the<00:00:52.770> DC<00:00:53.130> 100<00:00:53.790> is<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.150> concept<00:00:54.750> that<00:00:54.870> could<00:00:55.320> be

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
the DC 100 is the concept that could be

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:07.270 
the DC 100 is the concept that could be
what<00:00:56.490> we're<00:00:56.610> going<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:56.760> be<00:00:56.880> looking<00:00:57.120> at

that look after all the new product for
the<00:01:21.450> Land<00:01:21.659> Rover<00:01:21.869> you<00:01:22.470> guys<00:01:22.650> of<00:01:22.950> course<00:01:22.979> are

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
the Land Rover you guys of course are

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.040 
the Land Rover you guys of course are
now<00:01:23.460> in<00:01:23.790> charge<00:01:24.000> of<00:01:24.210> reinventing<00:01:24.960> the

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.050 
now in charge of reinventing the

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:26.420 
now in charge of reinventing the
defender<00:01:25.410> program<00:01:25.770> right<00:01:26.009> yeah<00:01:26.310> absolutely

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
defender program right yeah absolutely

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.219 
defender program right yeah absolutely
the<00:01:26.910> concepts<00:01:27.330> we're<00:01:27.450> seeing<00:01:27.660> here<00:01:27.810> today<00:01:27.960> are

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
the concepts we're seeing here today are

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.859 
the concepts we're seeing here today are
the<00:01:28.440> birth<00:01:28.979> stages<00:01:29.490> in<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.850> replacement<00:01:30.570> of

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
the birth stages in the replacement of

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.200 
the birth stages in the replacement of
our<00:01:30.990> iconic<00:01:31.530> yes<00:01:32.100> Land<00:01:32.400> Rover<00:01:32.610> Defender<00:01:32.759> more

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
our iconic yes Land Rover Defender more

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.149 
our iconic yes Land Rover Defender more
such<00:01:33.750> a<00:01:33.780> great<00:01:34.050> vehicle<00:01:34.200> we're<00:01:34.710> taking<00:01:35.040> this

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
such a great vehicle we're taking this

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.580 
such a great vehicle we're taking this
step<00:01:35.850> by<00:01:36.030> step<00:01:36.300> make<00:01:36.990> sure<00:01:37.020> we<00:01:37.259> get<00:01:37.409> this<00:01:37.530> right

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
step by step make sure we get this right

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.740 
step by step make sure we get this right
they're<00:01:38.280> two<00:01:38.460> concepts<00:01:38.970> that<00:01:39.180> show<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.570> sort

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
they're two concepts that show the sort

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.840 
they're two concepts that show the sort
of<00:01:39.810> bandwidth<00:01:40.320> about<00:01:40.710> what<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.460> replacement

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
of bandwidth about what the replacement

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.150 
of bandwidth about what the replacement
depend<00:01:42.420> that<00:01:42.539> could<00:01:42.720> be<00:01:42.899> so<00:01:43.710> one's<00:01:43.950> a<00:01:44.070> little

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:44.160 
depend that could be so one's a little

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.950 
depend that could be so one's a little
bit<00:01:44.369> more<00:01:44.520> extreme<00:01:44.759> in<00:01:45.030> terms<00:01:45.240> it's<00:01:45.899> a

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
bit more extreme in terms it's a

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.960 
bit more extreme in terms it's a
convertible<00:01:46.440> it's<00:01:46.770> very<00:01:46.979> sportive<00:01:47.490> concept

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
convertible it's very sportive concept

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.400 
convertible it's very sportive concept
and<00:01:48.210> then<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.539> other<00:01:48.660> one<00:01:48.840> which<00:01:49.080> is<00:01:49.110> the

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:49.410 
and then the other one which is the

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.320 
and then the other one which is the
station<00:01:49.950> wagon<00:01:50.070> version<00:01:50.280> shows<00:01:51.030> a<00:01:51.149> more

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
station wagon version shows a more

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:57.080 
station wagon version shows a more
utility<00:01:51.899> aspect<00:01:52.530> for<00:01:53.039> defender<00:01:55.280> and<00:01:56.280> what<00:01:57.000> are

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
utility aspect for defender and what are

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.370 
utility aspect for defender and what are
some<00:01:57.119> of<00:01:57.330> those<00:01:57.420> innovations<00:01:57.869> that<00:01:58.140> you<00:01:58.259> guys

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
some of those innovations that you guys

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.139 
some of those innovations that you guys
have<00:01:58.560> put<00:01:58.710> into<00:01:58.860> this<00:01:59.070> concept<00:01:59.340> this<00:02:00.090> concept

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
have put into this concept this concept

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.969 
have put into this concept this concept
was<00:02:00.660> a<00:02:00.750> couple<00:02:00.960> of<00:02:01.020> technologies<00:02:01.500> it<00:02:01.830> could

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
was a couple of technologies it could

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.320 
was a couple of technologies it could
start<00:02:02.220> off<00:02:02.369> with<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.850> likes<00:02:03.030> of<00:02:03.179> the

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
start off with the likes of the

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.300 
start off with the likes of the
automatic<00:02:03.720> train<00:02:03.899> response<00:02:04.229> this<00:02:04.440> is<00:02:04.500> a<00:02:04.619> next

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
automatic train response this is a next

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.980 
automatic train response this is a next
generation<00:02:05.429> beyond<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.300> current<00:02:06.509> manually

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
generation beyond the current manually

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.900 
generation beyond the current manually
selectable<00:02:07.470> ride-sharing<00:02:08.100> system<00:02:08.729> in<00:02:08.820> the

selectable ride-sharing system in the

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.400 
selectable ride-sharing system in the
car<00:02:09.090> yeah<00:02:09.690> that's<00:02:09.899> something<00:02:10.080> that<00:02:10.289> you<00:02:10.380> see

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
car yeah that's something that you see

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.990 
car yeah that's something that you see
now<00:02:10.739> in<00:02:11.070> land<00:02:11.310> rovers<00:02:11.579> and<00:02:11.610> other<00:02:11.820> vehicles

James Bond I think we have is an

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.110 
James Bond I think we have is an

suspect the spikes mounted on them that

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.890 
suspect the spikes mounted on them that
once<00:03:09.250> inflated<00:03:09.940> it<00:03:10.270> can<00:03:10.480> inflate<00:03:10.780> this

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
once inflated it can inflate this

out<00:03:46.640> and<00:03:46.730> suss<00:03:46.910> it<00:03:46.940> out<00:03:47.120> yeah<00:03:47.510> ok<00:03:48.020> well<00:03:48.350> we're

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
out and suss it out yeah ok well we're

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:49.930 
out and suss it out yeah ok well we're
in<00:03:48.620> that<00:03:48.770> phage<00:03:49.010> and<00:03:49.040> all<00:03:49.340> these<00:03:49.520> technologies

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
in that phage and all these technologies

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.450 
in that phage and all these technologies
we've<00:03:50.090> developed<00:03:50.480> you<00:03:50.720> know<00:03:50.750> quite<00:03:51.320> far<00:03:51.530> much

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:52.460 
we've developed you know quite far much

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:53.710 
we've developed you know quite far much
robust<00:03:52.760> technologies<00:03:53.240> and<00:03:53.360> we're<00:03:53.450> happy<00:03:53.630> to

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
robust technologies and we're happy to

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.450 
robust technologies and we're happy to
hand<00:03:53.900> them<00:03:54.050> across<00:03:54.200> onto<00:03:54.560> programs<00:03:54.920> yeah<00:03:55.160> but

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:55.460 
hand them across onto programs yeah but

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:56.530 
hand them across onto programs yeah but
whether<00:03:55.640> they'll<00:03:55.850> be<00:03:55.940> picked<00:03:56.150> on<00:03:56.210> what<00:03:56.360> time

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
whether they'll be picked on what time

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.060 
whether they'll be picked on what time
will<00:03:56.660> be<00:03:56.750> picked<00:03:56.960> up<00:03:57.050> I<00:03:57.350> just<00:03:57.740> can't<00:03:57.950> answer

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.070 
will be picked up I just can't answer

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:59.560 
will be picked up I just can't answer
sure<00:03:58.580> they<00:03:58.730> go<00:03:58.880> through<00:03:59.090> with<00:03:59.240> the<00:03:59.330> spike

00:03:59.560 --> 00:03:59.570 
sure they go through with the spike

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:00.130 
sure they go through with the spike
