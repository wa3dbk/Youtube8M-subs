00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 hello everyone I'm magnet 06 after 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.760
 a long season of not uploading videos 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.559
 the reasons for that were several there was a 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.480
 huge problem with the computer and 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.820
 you had to reformat those and you 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.760
 they changed the operating system to windows 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.920
 xp later I got distracted by installing the 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.230
 necessary supplements and when I returned 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.180
 the pc to its original glory I entertained 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.000
 quite playing yugioh online in the 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.890
 finally dwelling network page 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.900
 back in this video and to begin with 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.630
 with half a machine I will make a top 10 of 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.670
 best final fantasy that I've played that 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.770
 yes it will be a top of the number games and 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.350
 the final fantasy 8 will not be because no 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.140
 I played it, let's start before the 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.289
 bored with my boludeces put 10 final 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.079
 fantasy 2 your best remake is that of ps1 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.449
 for me a very high difficulty and a 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.309
 very good story for the time the 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.960
 reason I 'm in this position is the 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.340
 frustrating way to improve the 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.739
 characters 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.260
 if you use swords, better swords if you 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.359
 hurts your life improves and that's how 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.720
 game more hado masochist of the saga x 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.850
 of 9 final fantasy 1 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.520
 its best version ironically is that of 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.590
 cell phones its history is very typical but 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.600
 to be the first fantasy final is 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.540
 well your best point is your music in the 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.160
 version of ps1 post 8 is for the 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.070
 criticized by some and wanted by 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.680
 others the final fantasy 12 the story is 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.660
 taken from episodes 4 and 5 of star wars and 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.360
 his music, no matter how good it is, does not come 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.130
 at the height of his best deliveries what 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.440
 best of the game is the very high amount 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.020
 of optional bosses that has lengthening 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.060
 more the life of the game this game is of 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.910
 those that you should play it enough for 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:45.300
 you find it nice the worst of the game is 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:48.300
 the bread shit put 7 final fantasy 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.310
 3 its best version is bs since in 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.380
 this version has protagonists leaving 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.050
 outside those things of the gentlemen 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.030
 onions in the version of nes this game 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.950
 marked a before and after in the saga 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.920
 improving the trades that showed the 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.290
 final fantasy 1 your story is very good 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.090
 and its difficulty also the bad of 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.950
 game is the frustrating cave of the 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.709
 darkness where the enemies are 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.350
 divide when attacked position 6 and here 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.420
 they bitch me is the final fantasy 6 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.460
 Many say that this game is one of the 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.200
 best of the saga but I do not see it that way 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.820
 point there is music in the game that is 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.760
 horrible including that of the battle 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.730
 final with kezka its difficulty is not so 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.380
 high except in the gameboy advance 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.270
 besides who was the stupid idea of 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.850
 when you ride a choco vo or a ship 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:35.430
 change the camera to three of that for me 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.500
 It was the worst of the game but not everything is 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.720
 bad many of his characters are from the 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.220
 better besides that they improved the 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.990
 battle system and the manner of 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.090
 learn magic by means of 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:47.250
 madrecitas is very original point and what 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.710
 better who could forget the song of 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.410
 cell is in the opera very good game but 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:55.200
 a bit overrated ranked 5 end 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.500
 fantasy 5 this was the first final 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.940
 fantasy that wins very good story 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.490
 pretty good difficulty my very easy 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.720
 not very difficult and the best is system 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:06.180
 trades and to learn skills 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.380
 allowing a gentleman to use magic 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.390
 of healing 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.940
 the worst of the game is its very long duration 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.380
 short ranked 4 the most overrated 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.350
 final fantasy of all 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.780
 final fantasy 7 the truth this game is 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.890
 very good but it's not very difficult very 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.260
 good characters 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.150
 cat sweet and the music of the best of 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.730
 there's only one game in the saga with 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.950
 better music than that game that yes the 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.530
 It really seems stupid to hate a game 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:34.380
 by the sequels and prequels we pass to 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:37.230
 the three best place 3 final fantasy 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:39.870
 4 the truth your blood to win this 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.940
 game in the ds version a story 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.820
 epic the best characters and many 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:47.030
 Sad moments is a difficult game in 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:49.680
 its difficulty but it is very easy to understand 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.720
 is a game that did not innovate much with 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.540
 Regarding the other deliveries but still 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.550
 that 's the best games but at 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:00.090
 same time has the worst remake of 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:02.600
 all I mean the version of ps1 and 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.830
 we arrived at position 2 final fantasy 9 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:07.230
 remember that I said that only one game 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:10.590
 exceeded in music at the end fantasy 7 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:13.019
 Well, that is this game, a music 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:15.000
 epic graphics excellent and I would say that a 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:16.980
 good story but how the version wins 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.230
 Japanese of this game I do not know 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:20.790
 much the use of fact cobos is of the 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:23.490
 best and the mini card game 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:25.350
 also and the truth I did not find anything of 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.220
 bad except to fuck the fucking in turn of the 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:28.710
 game 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:31.260
 finally the great post arrives one if 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:33.960
 they saw the top 20 of ps2 games they know 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:36.990
 which is the number 1 the first place of 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:39.390
 top 10 is for final fantasy 10 story 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.760
 epic characters of the best and music 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:44.250
 also excellent pity that I do not know 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:46.920
 he kept that music in final fantasy 10 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:49.140
 2 but neither way this game is not to the 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.750
 active battle system already known in 

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:53.670
 the saga but still excellent is the 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.680
 way to learn overdrive attacks 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:57.900
 It is original in each character and the bliss 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.570
 goal is very entertaining to play it for 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.610
 good hours friends this was the top of 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:05.130
 the final fantasy and very soon criticize 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:07.260
 the final fantasy 10 2 but with logic 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:10.130
 good to see you and that albinos 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.130
 dominate the world
