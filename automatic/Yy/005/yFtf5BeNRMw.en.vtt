00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:07.170
 hello everyone we all have boxing for 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:11.040
 unpacking pro want and simultaneously with 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:13.639
 this throttle but more on that later because 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:17.150
 listen to the match us came again 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:17.150
 from market 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:42.329
 we have such a package 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:46.879
 small-small x like this 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:54.660
 tiny victorinox multitool 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:56.610
 tourist option red on the one hand it 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.960
 acquisition for me is joy another 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:05.780
 hand frustrated i'm some time 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:13.830
 back told knives like 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:18.780
 victorinox camper video can here 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:21.540
 look in this video i was talking about 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:26.070
 what a cool knife to carry every day 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:30.390
 the keys crack once rescued and I 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:33.290
 said that the knife can be taken with 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.780
 abroad in any trips and 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:40.280
 no one will even try to call 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:42.920
 No, I was cruelly mistaken. I recently 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:46.370
 returned from Egypt went to that 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:49.160
 time and on return home except report 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:51.190
 they just tel the bag and told you 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:54.350
 knife I play where you can see 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:58.030
 victorinox is not a knife not only that they 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:01.340
 Alex already and I have pity on me yet 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.410
 leatherman ps4 which generally knife not 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.320
 I can call it small pliers 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:10.610
 Here with such here I was picking Kai of course in 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:15.730
 in the form in which he was and I gave me 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:17.810
 he broke out of the novel bangs with a bang 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.560
 quiz like I just did not try 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:26.980
 break the knife did not work at all for centuries 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:31.010
 and here is the main difference of this 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:35.300
 mix model tourist from a camper 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:40.250
 he goes in series 8 4 millimeter they are 95 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:43.580
 like the one that is on the keys it takes 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:46.610
 a bit of a place so heavy 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:55.930
 In principle, this is also a record only with 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:55.930
 adding ax and sewed 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:05.440
 that's how the knife is all standard as usual 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:10.780
 opened tin can opener 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:15.280
 beer cans combined with a screwdriver 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:24.760
 small knife is very convenient to hide 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:45.600
 bags of this kind are small but. 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:47.769
 always everything i wanted to say guys 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.709
 when you go somewhere in 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:53.860
 travel with the border 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:55.569
 even such small things as nails gnawed 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:59.290
 to or the money is normally ki-vix 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:01.480

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:09.220
