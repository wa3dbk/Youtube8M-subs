00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.859 
days while hiking to the High Sierra
mind<00:01:59.189> you<00:01:59.369> I<00:01:59.399> was<00:01:59.579> only<00:01:59.759> boiling<00:02:00.270> 2<00:02:00.450> cups<00:02:00.719> of

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
mind you I was only boiling 2 cups of

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.469 
mind you I was only boiling 2 cups of
water<00:02:01.079> twice<00:02:01.530> a<00:02:01.590> day<00:02:01.890> so<00:02:02.280> another<00:02:02.939> trick<00:02:03.299> to

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
water twice a day so another trick to

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:04.789 
water twice a day so another trick to
getting<00:02:03.719> away<00:02:03.840> with<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.170> stove<00:02:04.469> on<00:02:04.649> long

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
getting away with the stove on long

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.590 
getting away with the stove on long
trails<00:02:05.070> to<00:02:05.430> look<00:02:05.610> for<00:02:05.850> extra<00:02:06.180> butane

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
trails to look for extra butane

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.559 
trails to look for extra butane
canisters<00:02:07.170> in<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.829> hiker<00:02:08.009> boxes<00:02:08.580> so<00:02:09.450> the

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
canisters in the hiker boxes so the

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.630 
canisters in the hiker boxes so the
skinny<00:02:09.899> is<00:02:10.170> that<00:02:10.709> it<00:02:10.830> only<00:02:11.009> weighs<00:02:11.340> about

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
skinny is that it only weighs about

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.680 
skinny is that it only weighs about
three<00:02:12.209> ounces

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
three ounces

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.210 
three ounces
it<00:02:12.959> needs<00:02:13.170> virtually

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
it needs virtually

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.220 
it needs virtually
no<00:02:14.310> maintenance<00:02:14.580> and<00:02:15.090> it<00:02:15.390> boils<00:02:15.720> a<00:02:15.810> leader<00:02:16.020> in

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
no maintenance and it boils a leader in

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.720 
no maintenance and it boils a leader in
under<00:02:16.470> three<00:02:16.710> point<00:02:16.950> five<00:02:17.130> minutes<00:02:17.550> depending

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
under three point five minutes depending

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.080 
under three point five minutes depending
on<00:02:18.300> elevation<00:02:19.020> so<00:02:19.830> sure<00:02:20.130> there<00:02:20.400> may<00:02:20.610> be<00:02:20.640> better

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
on elevation so sure there may be better

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.180 
on elevation so sure there may be better
butane<00:02:21.810> stoves<00:02:22.110> out<00:02:22.380> there<00:02:22.620> but<00:02:22.860> I've<00:02:23.010> grown

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
attached to this little guy so a quick

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.420 
attached to this little guy so a quick
note<00:02:26.910> though<00:02:27.600> if<00:02:27.840> you<00:02:28.140> buy<00:02:28.380> one<00:02:28.410> with<00:02:28.800> a<00:02:28.860> piezo

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.360 
note though if you buy one with a piezo
electric<00:02:29.760> starter<00:02:30.540> it'll<00:02:31.170> probably<00:02:31.860> crap<00:02:32.130> out

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
electric starter it'll probably crap out

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.370 
electric starter it'll probably crap out
on<00:02:32.400> you<00:02:32.670> within<00:02:32.970> several<00:02:33.240> months<00:02:33.480> of<00:02:33.660> usage<00:02:34.080> so

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
on you within several months of usage so

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.100 
on you within several months of usage so
always<00:02:34.920> take<00:02:35.430> a<00:02:35.670> secondary<00:02:36.480> ignition<00:02:36.870> source

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
always take a secondary ignition source

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.280 
always take a secondary ignition source
as<00:02:37.290> I<00:02:37.620> know<00:02:37.800> you<00:02:37.980> do<00:02:38.490> so<00:02:39.450> now<00:02:39.630> the<00:02:39.690> last<00:02:39.900> stove
