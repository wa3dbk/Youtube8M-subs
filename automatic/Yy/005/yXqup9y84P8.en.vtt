00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.800
 good to all welcome to this 

00:00:05.519 --> 00:00:10.769
 second destination mission 

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:12.809
 to see that I am on earth 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.890
 What an angel I am going to do in company 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:19.680
 of angels is all equal to 35 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.509
 missions there are 32 missions that there are 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.270
 We are going to make both your face and mine 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:25.880
 well juntitos 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.230
 the cooperative we are going to what we are going to 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.200
 do something that can be done with three 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.730
 people if I do not roll up anymore we're going to 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:35.660
 do any restoration reviews 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:37.520
 tension the story mode explain us to 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.770
 Lion 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.690
 the normal level but how many levels are there 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.170
 jose g I do not see it I am the god of 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:47.170
 which is normal the only thing that they give us 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.170
 bonus 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:52.870
 normal halo normal I think that by 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.870
 now yes 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.100
 here almost what the fallen will give us 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.439
 they take everything we got lucky 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.090
 find this ship a guardian can not 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.579
 do a lot to protect the 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.710
 city ​​without one but if we want to fight 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.710
 out of the earth we will need a 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.840
 distortion engine and that cosmodrome is 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.119
 the only place where we could still 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:43.610
 find one we already survive the 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.610
 fallen once we can do it again 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.719
 a guardian's ship was shot down 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:57.340
 here and recently if the fallen do not 

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:59.659
 have done with her maybe we'll get 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.159
 some pieces 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:04.850
 Well, nothing else, let's start 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:07.159
 let's start the mission recognizes the 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.899
 place of the cadet investigates the ship of the 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:11.670
 keeper killed in the steppe in the 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:14.920
 next for the affection 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:18.490
 in each mission we have the mission of each 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:21.280
 one of the objectives for not getting involved and 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.250
 the first the next and so little to 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.020
 little bit 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.270
 margin has different powers than those 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.980
 mine and the different what you 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:31.580
 enlarge the shotgun I imagine 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.160
 call the precision rifle 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:38.920
 well jose 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:41.560
 I did not take the gun and until then 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:45.989
 like your appointments both 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.989
 yes but I say high school high school 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:53.040
 because the shotgun and my rifle 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.040
 precision 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.840
 who can or with the franc 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:06.480
 taking 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:06.480
 well we have to protect 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.930
 with an information hub ani 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.329
 but they take from below 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:21.340
 we should go see in the turns of 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:25.450
 I work for him to touch 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:28.150
 to the networks of the cosmos or down to the 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.489
 tunnels of the currency cosmodrome to 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.560
 expert to connect with the 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:34.000
 information hub are the same 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:38.010
 that the dinner missions get the 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.010
 instructions the missions of beta 6 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.860
 down 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.860
 there is no talk 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.629
 I'm going down someone said 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:02.780
 to go friends 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.780
 you for the police right 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.870
 because the whole area 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.620
 relative to the night 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.920
 what we need 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.700
 our only hope is where 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.270
 we found the ship 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:32.690
 we have to go back 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:34.190
 fuck up there is worth and look for an engine 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:35.630
 of distortion returns to dock 13 and 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:39.160
 get a distortion engine 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.160
 interplanetary for your ship 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:51.210
 we go back to the previous vision to catch 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:51.210
 a rotor distorted for nothing 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:59.009
 canada to yours mola mallet you yours 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:03.409
 with what you do, he loves you 

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:03.409
 david coloradas the trick is free 

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:10.000
 Well now it takes 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:15.490
 you do not also have double whim I know that 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:15.490
 I saw you there 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:22.090
 because the power that you give us later 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:25.110
 and some then high 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:25.110
 that's a spoiler 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:28.370
 you lost me 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:33.100
 pick up loot you where were you I've got 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.910
 lost 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:35.910
 to the door 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:41.630
 already have it I will not take that 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:45.310
 I will make a guide I do not know ahead 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:47.830
 where are the 11 there I leave it 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:50.400
 we are already here I will look for the engine of 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:50.400
 distortion 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:54.250
 I feel a dark zone if you die in 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:57.000
 this area of ​​darkness will return to 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:57.000
 beginning of it 

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:05.129
 the highest 

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:12.990
 in the blink of an eye you earn a 

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:12.990
 jose trophy 

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:18.360
 this the forge and the 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:27.039
 300,400,400 almost killed small 

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:33.699
 things teamwork 

00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:33.699
 and continuing to fuck son of a bitch 

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:42.090
 cobán 

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:47.000
 will wait has lifted the battle 

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:53.900
 situation engine we already have it 

00:06:52.009 --> 00:06:55.000
 the dragon hunter attacks 

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:57.210
 serious 

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.319
 in grass 

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:00.319
 taking a grass 

00:07:03.009 --> 00:07:08.629
 my first units to kill a 

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:10.400
 archon may affect the fallen and 

00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:13.009
 we have got a distortion engine 

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:15.259
 we can go to fight the moon you must 

00:07:13.009 --> 00:07:16.969
 talk to the speaker your parents or 

00:07:15.259 --> 00:07:20.470
 completed restoration but it will raise me 

00:07:16.969 --> 00:07:23.110
 the point of how this point was god 

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:25.240
 Oh I'm wrong but I'm going to leave 

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:30.420
 also the point and angled the elevation 

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:30.420
 now it's a second time after takeoff 

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:36.009
 perfect jump or double jump the 

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:39.339
 shipowner I do not have it 

00:07:36.009 --> 00:07:42.369
 to see what the angel is a good thing 

00:07:39.339 --> 00:07:44.150
 hey is loading me he gave me two 

00:07:42.369 --> 00:07:47.060
 things 

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:50.960
 there are gates and I can not stand in that 

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:53.880
 time that the explorer good then 

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:55.770
 so far this second mission 

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:58.400
 let's hope you liked it and we 

00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:58.400
 we see in the next
