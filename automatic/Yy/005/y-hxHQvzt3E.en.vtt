video tutorial on how to setup your
biomechanics<00:00:09.030> model<00:00:09.559> for<00:00:10.559> the<00:00:11.219> spring<00:00:12.030> 2009

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:13.160 
biomechanics model for the spring 2009

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.730 
biomechanics model for the spring 2009
introduced<00:00:14.160> by<00:00:14.309> our<00:00:14.340> mechanics<00:00:14.910> class<00:00:15.740> so

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
introduced by our mechanics class so

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.950 
introduced by our mechanics class so
we've<00:00:17.279> already<00:00:17.460> done<00:00:17.850> the<00:00:18.029> capture<00:00:18.480> in<00:00:18.720> the

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
we've already done the capture in the

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.370 
we've already done the capture in the
lab<00:00:19.170> and<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.890> data<00:00:20.359> was<00:00:21.359> transferred<00:00:22.109> from

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
lab and the data was transferred from

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.700 
lab and the data was transferred from
the<00:00:23.010> capture<00:00:23.730> computer<00:00:24.210> over<00:00:24.630> to<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:25.140> class

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
the capture computer over to the class

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.310 
the capture computer over to the class
server<00:00:26.099> and<00:00:26.490> so<00:00:27.359> what<00:00:27.630> we're<00:00:27.720> gonna<00:00:27.840> do<00:00:28.050> here

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
server and so what we're gonna do here

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.570 
server and so what we're gonna do here
is<00:00:28.410> I'm<00:00:28.529> just<00:00:28.590> gonna<00:00:28.800> give<00:00:28.980> you<00:00:29.070> a<00:00:29.130> quick<00:00:29.369> guide

is I'm just gonna give you a quick guide

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.849 
is I'm just gonna give you a quick guide
on<00:00:29.910> how<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.359> get<00:00:30.570> things<00:00:30.750> set<00:00:31.140> up<00:00:31.289> so<00:00:31.740> we're

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
on how to get things set up so we're

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.370 
on how to get things set up so we're
gonna<00:00:31.980> open<00:00:32.180> well<00:00:33.180> first<00:00:33.420> thing<00:00:33.630> let's<00:00:33.989> go

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
gonna open well first thing let's go

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.840 
gonna open well first thing let's go
ahead<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:35.010> make<00:00:35.160> sure<00:00:35.190> that<00:00:35.370> we're<00:00:35.670> connected

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
ahead and make sure that we're connected

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.639 
ahead and make sure that we're connected
to<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.210> Internet<00:00:36.600> due<00:00:36.870> to<00:00:37.079> our<00:00:37.230> internet

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
to the Internet due to our internet

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.100 
to the Internet due to our internet
connectivity<00:00:38.070> problems<00:00:38.640> in<00:00:38.760> this<00:00:38.879> room<00:00:39.180> and

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
connectivity problems in this room and

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.040 
connectivity problems in this room and
so<00:00:40.290> yes<00:00:40.620> we<00:00:40.800> are<00:00:40.829> and<00:00:41.280> we<00:00:41.640> can<00:00:41.820> check<00:00:42.059> that<00:00:42.120> our

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.830 

files<00:00:46.050> are<00:00:46.289> indeed<00:00:46.620> here<00:00:47.090> in<00:00:48.090> this<00:00:48.329> case<00:00:48.570> I<00:00:48.809> am

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
files are indeed here in this case I am

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.959 
files are indeed here in this case I am
logged<00:00:49.559> in<00:00:49.710> as<00:00:49.770> myself<00:00:50.010> so<00:00:50.460> I<00:00:50.489> don't<00:00:50.700> have<00:00:50.850> the

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
logged in as myself so I don't have the

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.610 
logged in as myself so I don't have the
wide<00:00:51.180> drive<00:00:51.480> map<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.930> same<00:00:52.110> as<00:00:52.260> you<00:00:52.410> so<00:00:52.530> I'm

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
wide drive map the same as you so I'm

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:59.119 
wide drive map the same as you so I'm
just<00:00:52.680> going<00:00:52.890> to<00:00:52.949> go<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.190> where<00:00:53.520> it<00:00:53.550> is<00:00:56.719> and<00:00:58.129> HS

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
just going to go to where it is and HS

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.400 
just going to go to where it is and HS
601<00:00:59.789> is<00:00:59.820> where<00:01:00.210> that<00:01:00.390> is<00:01:00.600> course<00:01:01.050> information

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
601 is where that is course information

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.549 
601 is where that is course information
and<00:01:02.280> we'll<00:01:02.910> see<00:01:03.090> that<00:01:03.239> our<00:01:03.329> vikon<00:01:03.750> database<00:01:04.290> is

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
and we'll see that our vikon database is

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.670 
and we'll see that our vikon database is
there<00:01:04.860> now<00:01:05.630> on<00:01:06.630> this<00:01:07.140> computer<00:01:08.900> under<00:01:09.900> the

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
there now on this computer under the

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.280 
there now on this computer under the
hard<00:01:11.159> drive<00:01:11.430> if<00:01:11.640> we<00:01:11.880> go<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.540> documents<00:01:13.229> and

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
hard drive if we go to the documents and

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.109 
hard drive if we go to the documents and
settings<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:13.920> remote<00:01:14.189> kept<00:01:14.400> students<00:01:14.909> in<00:01:15.030> the

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
settings and remote kept students in the

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.030 
settings and remote kept students in the
vikon<00:01:15.509> directory<00:01:15.960> is<00:01:16.020> where<00:01:16.110> I<00:01:16.259> had<00:01:16.650> told<00:01:16.920> you

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
vikon directory is where I had told you

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.050 
vikon directory is where I had told you
to<00:01:17.340> put<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:18.299> HS<00:01:18.810> 601<00:01:19.409> capture<00:01:20.040> spring<00:01:20.400> 2009

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
to put the HS 601 capture spring 2009

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.899 
to put the HS 601 capture spring 2009
database<00:01:22.020> will<00:01:22.680> see<00:01:22.890> that<00:01:23.040> everything<00:01:23.759> is

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
database will see that everything is

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.890 
database will see that everything is
indeed<00:01:24.659> in<00:01:24.990> this<00:01:25.350> database<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:26.100> so<00:01:26.970> let's<00:01:27.750> go

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
indeed in this database and so let's go

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.420 
indeed in this database and so let's go
ahead<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:28.229> now<00:01:28.619> that<00:01:28.799> we<00:01:28.860> know<00:01:28.979> it's<00:01:29.159> there

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
ahead and now that we know it's there

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:35.120 
ahead and now that we know it's there
let's<00:01:29.790> open<00:01:30.000> up<00:01:30.299> Vikon<00:01:31.049> Nexus<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:33.979> wait<00:01:34.979> just

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
let's open up Vikon Nexus and wait just

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.590 
let's open up Vikon Nexus and wait just
a<00:01:35.280> bit<00:01:35.310> for<00:01:35.579> that<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.790> open<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.299> then<00:01:36.420> once

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
a bit for that to open and then once

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.300 
a bit for that to open and then once
we're<00:01:36.750> open<00:01:37.140> let's<00:01:37.530> go<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:37.799> our<00:01:38.009> data

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
we're open let's go to our data

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.899 
we're open let's go to our data
management<00:01:38.759> window<00:01:39.299> and<00:01:40.280> we<00:01:41.280> should<00:01:41.549> already

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
management window and we should already

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.350 
management window and we should already
have<00:01:42.409> created<00:01:43.409> our<00:01:43.470> database<00:01:44.090> I'm<00:01:45.090> not<00:01:45.240> going

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
have created our database I'm not going

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.490 
have created our database I'm not going
to<00:01:45.420> show<00:01:45.540> you<00:01:45.630> how<00:01:45.720> to<00:01:45.750> do<00:01:45.930> that<00:01:46.079> here<00:01:46.259> I<00:01:46.290> can

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
to show you how to do that here I can

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.380 
to show you how to do that here I can
show<00:01:46.530> you<00:01:46.740> again<00:01:46.890> in<00:01:47.009> class<00:01:47.250> but<00:01:48.060> if<00:01:48.180> we

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
show you again in class but if we

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:55.820 
show you again in class but if we
remember<00:01:48.840> where<00:01:49.649> that<00:01:49.680> is<00:01:51.079> it<00:01:52.079> was<00:01:54.140> again

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 
remember where that is it was again

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:01.280 
remember where that is it was again
under<00:01:56.130> mocap<00:01:56.580> students<00:01:57.360> My<00:01:57.660> Documents<00:02:00.290> which

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
under mocap students My Documents which

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.630 
under mocap students My Documents which
would<00:02:01.470> be<00:02:01.560> mocap<00:02:01.920> students<00:02:02.220> documents<00:02:02.580> in

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
would be mocap students documents in

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.940 
would be mocap students documents in
this<00:02:02.730> case<00:02:02.970> Vikon<00:02:03.840> HS<00:02:04.740> 601<00:02:05.400> and<00:02:06.470> HS<00:02:07.470> six<00:02:07.710> at<00:02:07.830> one

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
this case Vikon HS 601 and HS six at one

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.530 
this case Vikon HS 601 and HS six at one
so<00:02:08.070> we're<00:02:08.160> gonna<00:02:08.250> open<00:02:08.490> that<00:02:08.640> database<00:02:09.090> and

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:09.540 
so we're gonna open that database and

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:12.590 
so we're gonna open that database and
we'll<00:02:10.170> see<00:02:10.320> that<00:02:10.470> we<00:02:10.590> have<00:02:10.830> our<00:02:11.130> subject<00:02:12.060> and

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
we'll see that we have our subject and

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
we'll see that we have our subject and
our<00:02:13.410> trials<00:02:14.010> from<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.310> subject<00:02:14.790> okay<00:02:14.910> so

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
our trials from the subject okay so

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.410 
our trials from the subject okay so

these little icons here are associated
with<00:02:18.570> the<00:02:18.840> trial<00:02:19.760> the<00:02:20.760> yellow<00:02:21.090> is<00:02:21.240> the<00:02:21.270> movie

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
with the trial the yellow is the movie

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.320 
with the trial the yellow is the movie
the<00:02:21.930> X<00:02:22.110> is<00:02:22.440> the<00:02:22.620> data<00:02:22.830> don't<00:02:23.790> worry<00:02:23.970> about<00:02:24.090> that

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
the X is the data don't worry about that

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.910 
the X is the data don't worry about that
for<00:02:24.360> right<00:02:24.720> now<00:02:24.750> what<00:02:25.200> we're<00:02:25.320> gonna<00:02:25.380> do<00:02:25.710> is

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
for right now what we're gonna do is

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.400 
for right now what we're gonna do is
we're<00:02:26.040> gonna<00:02:26.100> double-click<00:02:26.670> on<00:02:27.000> T<00:02:27.630> pose<00:02:27.900> and

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
we're gonna double-click on T pose and

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.580 
we're gonna double-click on T pose and
that's<00:02:29.310> gonna<00:02:29.490> open<00:02:29.700> up<00:02:30.000> and<00:02:30.630> we're<00:02:31.470> gonna

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
that's gonna open up and we're gonna

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.410 
that's gonna open up and we're gonna
look<00:02:31.770> at<00:02:31.890> our<00:02:31.950> subject<00:02:32.460> and<00:02:32.580> again<00:02:32.880> this<00:02:33.240> is

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
look at our subject and again this is

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.840 
look at our subject and again this is
starting<00:02:33.750> from<00:02:33.870> blank<00:02:34.230> and<00:02:34.470> we<00:02:34.530> can<00:02:35.370> orient

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
starting from blank and we can orient

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.000 
starting from blank and we can orient
ourselves<00:02:35.940> in<00:02:36.510> the<00:02:36.660> 3d<00:02:36.990> window<00:02:37.170> here<00:02:37.560> remember

up down left or right so that we can

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.400 
up down left or right so that we can
orient<00:02:55.470> ourselves<00:02:55.830> however<00:02:56.340> we<00:02:56.730> would<00:02:56.880> like

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
orient ourselves however we would like

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.720 
orient ourselves however we would like
generally<00:02:58.410> what<00:02:58.560> we<00:02:58.650> want<00:02:58.860> to<00:02:58.950> do<00:02:59.100> in<00:02:59.400> this

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
generally what we want to do in this

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.220 
generally what we want to do in this
case<00:03:00.000> is<00:03:00.060> center<00:03:00.570> ourselves<00:03:00.720> in<00:03:01.140> the

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
case is center ourselves in the

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.660 
case is center ourselves in the
forceplates<00:03:01.769> because<00:03:02.160> that's<00:03:02.340> going<00:03:02.459> to<00:03:02.519> be

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
forceplates because that's going to be

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.690 
forceplates because that's going to be
the<00:03:02.790> T<00:03:02.970> pose<00:03:03.209> and<00:03:03.540> we<00:03:04.080> want<00:03:04.260> to<00:03:04.320> optimize<00:03:04.700> the

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
the T pose and we want to optimize the

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.729 
the T pose and we want to optimize the
visualization<00:03:06.450> of<00:03:06.540> the<00:03:06.660> dots<00:03:06.870> for<00:03:07.380> tracking

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
visualization of the dots for tracking

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:08.900 
visualization of the dots for tracking
it<00:03:08.010> okay<00:03:08.310> anyway

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
it okay anyway

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.210 
it okay anyway
next<00:03:09.690> thing<00:03:09.810> we<00:03:09.930> need<00:03:10.050> to<00:03:10.170> do<00:03:10.350> is<00:03:10.560> let's<00:03:11.100> go

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
next thing we need to do is let's go

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.310 
next thing we need to do is let's go
ahead<00:03:11.519> and<00:03:11.700> run<00:03:11.970> this<00:03:12.120> reconstruct<00:03:12.810> pipeline

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
ahead and run this reconstruct pipeline

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.470 
ahead and run this reconstruct pipeline
which<00:03:13.590> is<00:03:13.800> these<00:03:14.010> three<00:03:14.400> grey<00:03:14.640> dots<00:03:14.940> up<00:03:15.269> here

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
which is these three grey dots up here

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.860 
which is these three grey dots up here
so<00:03:15.600> if<00:03:15.690> we<00:03:15.720> click<00:03:15.930> on<00:03:16.019> that<00:03:16.380> that's<00:03:17.040> gonna<00:03:17.870> run

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
so if we click on that that's gonna run

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.300 
so if we click on that that's gonna run
the<00:03:18.989> reconstruct<00:03:19.500> pipeline<00:03:19.890> which<00:03:20.070> is<00:03:20.100> going

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
the reconstruct pipeline which is going

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.580 
the reconstruct pipeline which is going
to<00:03:20.370> show<00:03:20.550> us<00:03:20.700> where<00:03:20.850> the<00:03:21.030> dots<00:03:21.269> are<00:03:21.540> in<00:03:21.930> this

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
to show us where the dots are in this

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.640 
to show us where the dots are in this
video<00:03:23.459> or<00:03:23.880> this<00:03:24.120> capture<00:03:24.540> sequence<00:03:24.930> okay<00:03:25.590> so

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
video or this capture sequence okay so

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.530 
video or this capture sequence okay so
the<00:03:25.860> next<00:03:26.010> thing<00:03:26.160> we<00:03:26.400> need<00:03:26.550> to<00:03:26.580> do<00:03:26.790> is<00:03:27.000> we<00:03:27.420> need

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
the next thing we need to do is we need

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.020 
the next thing we need to do is we need
to<00:03:27.660> create<00:03:27.959> an<00:03:28.230> a<00:03:28.500> blank<00:03:28.950> subject<00:03:29.640> so<00:03:29.760> let's<00:03:29.880> go

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
to create an a blank subject so let's go

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.729 
to create an a blank subject so let's go
ahead<00:03:30.269> I'm<00:03:30.390> gonna<00:03:30.450> click<00:03:30.720> on<00:03:30.750> that<00:03:31.019> icon<00:03:31.230> right

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
ahead I'm gonna click on that icon right

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.570 
ahead I'm gonna click on that icon right
here<00:03:31.769> and<00:03:32.280> I'm<00:03:32.850> just<00:03:32.880> gonna<00:03:33.060> call<00:03:33.330> this<00:03:33.540> matte

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
here and I'm just gonna call this matte

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:39.020 
here and I'm just gonna call this matte
D<00:03:35.580> and<00:03:36.260> say<00:03:37.260> okay<00:03:37.560> and<00:03:37.830> that<00:03:38.340> creates<00:03:38.700> that<00:03:38.790> and

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
D and say okay and that creates that and

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.190 
D and say okay and that creates that and
you'll<00:03:39.120> notice<00:03:39.300> that<00:03:39.540> does<00:03:39.780> a<00:03:39.810> few<00:03:40.140> things

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
you'll notice that does a few things

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.140 
you'll notice that does a few things
over<00:03:40.769> here<00:03:41.040> so<00:03:41.250> we<00:03:41.370> can<00:03:41.519> click<00:03:41.730> on<00:03:41.940> this

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
over here so we can click on this

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.830 
over here so we can click on this
subject<00:03:42.720> here<00:03:43.170> and<00:03:43.880> so<00:03:44.880> then<00:03:45.060> if<00:03:45.269> we<00:03:45.390> open<00:03:45.750> up

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
subject here and so then if we open up

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:46.910 
subject here and so then if we open up
the<00:03:45.989> things<00:03:46.200> we<00:03:46.350> noticed<00:03:46.680> that<00:03:46.769> there's

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
the things we noticed that there's

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.040 
the things we noticed that there's
nothing<00:03:47.130> here<00:03:47.519> right<00:03:47.730> now<00:03:47.910> so<00:03:47.940> and<00:03:48.480> we<00:03:48.870> just

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
nothing here right now so and we just

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:51.670 
nothing here right now so and we just
have<00:03:49.170> a<00:03:49.200> bunch<00:03:49.410> of<00:03:49.850> white<00:03:50.850> dots<00:03:51.120> that<00:03:51.420> are

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
have a bunch of white dots that are

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.900 
have a bunch of white dots that are
unlabeled<00:03:52.680> and<00:03:52.920> notice<00:03:53.220> we<00:03:53.340> can't<00:03:53.670> label

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
unlabeled and notice we can't label

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.400 
unlabeled and notice we can't label
these<00:03:54.269> right<00:03:54.600> now<00:03:54.630> we<00:03:54.840> don't<00:03:55.080> have<00:03:55.260> any

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
these right now we don't have any

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.810 
these right now we don't have any
options<00:03:55.950> to<00:03:56.040> do<00:03:56.489> any<00:03:56.670> of<00:03:56.820> that<00:03:56.850> so<00:03:58.730> what<00:03:59.730> we

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
options to do any of that so what we

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.840 
options to do any of that so what we
need<00:03:59.970> to<00:04:00.000> do<00:04:00.180> is<00:04:00.269> we<00:04:00.390> need<00:04:00.480> to<00:04:00.630> set<00:04:00.900> up<00:04:00.930> our

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:01.850 
need to do is we need to set up our

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:06.890 
need to do is we need to set up our
skeleton<00:04:02.850> and<00:04:03.000> our<00:04:03.900> labeling<00:04:05.240> template<00:04:06.240> so

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
skeleton and our labeling template so

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.120 
skeleton and our labeling template so
that<00:04:06.930> we<00:04:07.140> can<00:04:07.319> use<00:04:07.470> this<00:04:07.620> and<00:04:07.800> we're<00:04:07.950> going<00:04:08.069> to

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
that we can use this and we're going to

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.899 
that we can use this and we're going to
use<00:04:08.280> this

00:04:08.899 --> 00:04:08.909 
use this

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:10.880 
use this
the<00:04:09.120> rest<00:04:09.299> of<00:04:09.450> the<00:04:09.540> semester<00:04:09.749> we're<00:04:10.620> gonna<00:04:10.709> be

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
the rest of the semester we're gonna be

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.830 
the rest of the semester we're gonna be
using<00:04:11.340> we're<00:04:11.879> not<00:04:11.969> gonna<00:04:12.090> be<00:04:12.239> using<00:04:12.359> plug-in

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
using we're not gonna be using plug-in

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.750 
using we're not gonna be using plug-in
gate<00:04:13.049> within<00:04:13.290> the<00:04:13.769> Vikon<00:04:14.159> Nexus<00:04:14.549> program

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
gate within the Vikon Nexus program

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.759 
gate within the Vikon Nexus program
we're<00:04:15.060> gonna<00:04:15.150> be<00:04:15.299> using<00:04:15.480> some<00:04:16.199> body<00:04:16.410> builder

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
we're gonna be using some body builder

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:18.050 
we're gonna be using some body builder
code<00:04:17.009> which<00:04:17.220> has<00:04:17.250> been<00:04:17.489> around<00:04:17.609> for<00:04:17.970> a<00:04:18.000> while

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
code which has been around for a while

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.210 
code which has been around for a while
that<00:04:18.419> uses<00:04:18.750> the<00:04:18.870> Gollum<00:04:19.259> model<00:04:19.650> it<00:04:20.009> works

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
that uses the Gollum model it works

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.650 
that uses the Gollum model it works
fairly<00:04:20.370> well<00:04:20.669> for<00:04:20.850> what<00:04:21.000> we're<00:04:21.090> gonna<00:04:21.180> use<00:04:21.269> and

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
fairly well for what we're gonna use and

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.570 
fairly well for what we're gonna use and
I'm<00:04:21.930> gonna<00:04:22.079> show<00:04:22.199> you<00:04:22.440> how<00:04:22.650> to<00:04:22.710> do<00:04:23.009> all<00:04:23.190> that<00:04:23.370> as

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
I'm gonna show you how to do all that as

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.999 
I'm gonna show you how to do all that as
the<00:04:23.820> course<00:04:24.060> of<00:04:24.210> this<00:04:24.270> semester<00:04:24.449> goes<00:04:24.900> on<00:04:25.139> but

00:04:25.999 --> 00:04:26.009 
the course of this semester goes on but

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:27.890 
the course of this semester goes on but
for<00:04:26.310> now<00:04:26.430> let's<00:04:26.940> just<00:04:27.030> learn<00:04:27.360> how<00:04:27.539> to<00:04:27.570> set<00:04:27.870> up

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
for now let's just learn how to set up

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.409 
for now let's just learn how to set up
our<00:04:28.110> labeling<00:04:28.590> template<00:04:29.070> okay<00:04:29.460> so<00:04:29.520> the<00:04:30.210> first

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:30.419 
our labeling template okay so the first

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:31.670 
our labeling template okay so the first
thing<00:04:30.570> we<00:04:30.660> need<00:04:30.810> to<00:04:30.840> do<00:04:30.990> is<00:04:31.080> we<00:04:31.169> need<00:04:31.259> to<00:04:31.320> create

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
thing we need to do is we need to create

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.680 
thing we need to do is we need to create
some<00:04:31.889> segments<00:04:32.400> so<00:04:32.729> let's<00:04:33.090> go<00:04:33.270> ahead<00:04:33.479> and<00:04:33.599> do

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
some segments so let's go ahead and do

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.710 
some segments so let's go ahead and do
that<00:04:33.750> let's<00:04:34.139> create<00:04:34.410> the<00:04:34.560> pelvis<00:04:35.479> we<00:04:36.479> click

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
that let's create the pelvis we click

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.320 
that let's create the pelvis we click
create<00:04:36.870> and<00:04:37.320> then<00:04:38.070> again<00:04:38.580> I<00:04:38.789> was<00:04:39.030> telling<00:04:39.270> you

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
create and then again I was telling you

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:40.700 
create and then again I was telling you
the<00:04:39.419> way<00:04:39.539> I<00:04:39.570> like<00:04:39.870> to<00:04:39.990> do<00:04:40.110> this<00:04:40.229> is<00:04:40.380> I<00:04:40.500> like<00:04:40.680> to

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
the way I like to do this is I like to

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.830 
the way I like to do this is I like to
start<00:04:40.860> from<00:04:41.130> left<00:04:41.520> side<00:04:41.759> of<00:04:41.880> the<00:04:41.940> body<00:04:42.150> on<00:04:42.449> the

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
start from left side of the body on the

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.749 
start from left side of the body on the
front<00:04:43.199> and<00:04:43.380> then<00:04:43.680> go<00:04:43.860> to<00:04:43.919> the<00:04:44.099> right<00:04:44.280> side<00:04:44.520> and

00:04:44.749 --> 00:04:44.759 
front and then go to the right side and

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:46.879 
front and then go to the right side and
then<00:04:44.910> back<00:04:45.120> so<00:04:45.479> we're<00:04:45.690> gonna<00:04:45.780> pick<00:04:46.080> this<00:04:46.590> dot

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:46.889 
then back so we're gonna pick this dot

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:49.279 
then back so we're gonna pick this dot
this<00:04:47.310> dot<00:04:47.370> this<00:04:48.030> dot<00:04:48.090> and<00:04:48.539> this<00:04:48.780> dot<00:04:48.840> so<00:04:49.139> that's

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:49.289 
this dot this dot and this dot so that's

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:54.770 
this dot this dot and this dot so that's
a<00:04:49.699> ASIS<00:04:50.810> are<00:04:51.810> a<00:04:52.289> sorry<00:04:52.680> left<00:04:52.949> ASIS<00:04:53.580> right<00:04:53.940> ASIS

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
a ASIS are a sorry left ASIS right ASIS

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:58.760 
a ASIS are a sorry left ASIS right ASIS
left<00:04:55.740> PSIs<00:04:56.639> right<00:04:57.060> psas<00:04:57.599> okay<00:04:57.900> so<00:04:58.410> once<00:04:58.680> you

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
left PSIs right psas okay so once you

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.100 
left PSIs right psas okay so once you
pick<00:04:58.919> those<00:04:59.130> four<00:04:59.460> that's<00:04:59.880> quickly<00:05:00.389> click<00:05:00.930> the

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
pick those four that's quickly click the

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:02.659 
pick those four that's quickly click the
create<00:05:01.410> button<00:05:01.560> again<00:05:01.889> and<00:05:02.009> that'll<00:05:02.130> orient

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:02.669 
create button again and that'll orient

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:06.080 
create button again and that'll orient
our<00:05:03.030> segment<00:05:03.870> now<00:05:04.770> try<00:05:05.220> to<00:05:05.250> be<00:05:05.370> careful<00:05:05.580> not<00:05:05.910> to

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
our segment now try to be careful not to

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:07.879 
our segment now try to be careful not to
use<00:05:06.120> the<00:05:06.419> wheel<00:05:06.630> while<00:05:07.500> you're<00:05:07.710> in<00:05:07.800> this

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:07.889 
use the wheel while you're in this

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:10.339 
use the wheel while you're in this
window<00:05:08.280> or<00:05:08.460> it'll<00:05:08.699> remove<00:05:09.479> your<00:05:09.720> segments

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:10.349 
window or it'll remove your segments

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:13.159 
window or it'll remove your segments
here<00:05:10.550> now<00:05:11.550> we<00:05:11.610> can<00:05:11.820> open<00:05:11.940> this<00:05:12.120> up<00:05:12.360> and<00:05:12.419> we

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:13.169 
here now we can open this up and we

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:14.600 
here now we can open this up and we
notice<00:05:13.409> we<00:05:13.530> have<00:05:13.680> some<00:05:13.889> markers<00:05:14.310> that<00:05:14.550> are

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
notice we have some markers that are

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:16.999 
notice we have some markers that are
unlabeled<00:05:15.180> we<00:05:15.360> have<00:05:15.509> the<00:05:15.630> pelvis<00:05:16.110> and<00:05:16.409> we

00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:17.009 
unlabeled we have the pelvis and we

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:18.620 
unlabeled we have the pelvis and we
actually<00:05:17.400> have<00:05:17.550> a<00:05:17.580> joint<00:05:17.909> which<00:05:18.180> is<00:05:18.330> the

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630 
actually have a joint which is the

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:20.540 
actually have a joint which is the
pelvis<00:05:19.139> with<00:05:19.289> respect<00:05:19.740> to<00:05:19.830> how<00:05:19.949> it<00:05:20.070> moves<00:05:20.310> to

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550 
pelvis with respect to how it moves to

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.300 
pelvis with respect to how it moves to
the<00:05:20.639> world<00:05:20.849> and<00:05:21.180> we<00:05:22.139> can<00:05:22.620> know<00:05:22.770> this<00:05:22.949> because

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
the world and we can know this because

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:24.920 
the world and we can know this because
the<00:05:23.639> way<00:05:23.789> that<00:05:23.970> we<00:05:24.090> clicked<00:05:24.389> on<00:05:24.479> those<00:05:24.659> dots

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930 
the way that we clicked on those dots

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:26.870 
the way that we clicked on those dots
defines<00:05:25.470> the<00:05:25.740> planes<00:05:26.009> but<00:05:26.460> again<00:05:26.669> we're<00:05:26.789> not

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:26.880 
defines the planes but again we're not

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.939 
defines the planes but again we're not
going<00:05:27.000> to<00:05:27.030> use<00:05:27.090> plug-in<00:05:27.840> gate<00:05:28.199> for<00:05:28.830> this

00:05:28.939 --> 00:05:28.949 
going to use plug-in gate for this

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:30.800 
going to use plug-in gate for this
course<00:05:29.280> so<00:05:29.610> we<00:05:30.270> don't<00:05:30.419> have<00:05:30.479> to<00:05:30.599> worry<00:05:30.750> about

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810 
course so we don't have to worry about

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:33.290 
course so we don't have to worry about
that<00:05:31.139> too<00:05:31.409> much<00:05:31.440> okay<00:05:32.039> let's<00:05:32.580> go<00:05:32.729> ahead<00:05:33.030> and

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 
that too much okay let's go ahead and

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.749 
that too much okay let's go ahead and
create<00:05:33.960> our<00:05:34.320> next<00:05:34.650> segment<00:05:35.039> okay<00:05:35.070> I<00:05:35.340> like<00:05:35.639> to

00:05:35.749 --> 00:05:35.759 
create our next segment okay I like to

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:38.180 
create our next segment okay I like to
do<00:05:35.880> things<00:05:36.060> from<00:05:36.449> left<00:05:36.750> to<00:05:36.900> right<00:05:37.259> subjects

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:38.190 
do things from left to right subjects

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:40.100 
do things from left to right subjects
left<00:05:38.340> side<00:05:38.580> to<00:05:38.789> right<00:05:38.820> side<00:05:39.030> so<00:05:39.419> let's<00:05:39.930> go

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:40.110 
left side to right side so let's go

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:45.499 
left side to right side so let's go
ahead<00:05:40.320> and<00:05:40.470> start<00:05:40.740> with<00:05:40.949> left<00:05:42.830> femur<00:05:44.060> okay<00:05:45.060> now

00:05:45.499 --> 00:05:45.509 
ahead and start with left femur okay now
