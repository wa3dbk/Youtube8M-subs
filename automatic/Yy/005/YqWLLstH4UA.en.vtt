 Good morning, it is the 22nd skipping rope mission 

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:12.610
 Last time it was 50 consecutive times being one clear, but this time the theme was taken out from the staff 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:18.640
 The yellow sand and the fire is in 1 minute 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:20.210

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.600

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:53.220
 Even if it stops well 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.140
 You can do it once 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.940
 How many seconds 30 seconds to go 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:08.119

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.300

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:42.570
 Excuse me 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:44.090
 It is a feeling that everyone's advice can be shameful somehow or not 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.060
 but 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.500
 Quite impossible 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.980
 What is good 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.280
 Is that okay? 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:53.960

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.960

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:05.299

 Well this week I did not have a mission at all at all this time, so somehow I wanted to go in thunder 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.030

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.030
