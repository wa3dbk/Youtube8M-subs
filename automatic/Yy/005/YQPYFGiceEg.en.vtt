00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:27.380 
all these other nodes I'm just going to

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.490 
all these other nodes I'm just going to
do<00:05:27.500> a<00:05:27.530> few<00:05:28.240> and<00:05:29.240> then<00:05:29.510> we'll<00:05:29.780> quickly<00:05:30.020> test

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:30.500 
do a few and then we'll quickly test

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.839 
do a few and then we'll quickly test
them<00:05:31.419> so<00:05:32.500> like<00:05:33.500> let's<00:05:34.010> see<00:05:34.280> what<00:05:34.490> else<00:05:34.520> do<00:05:34.789> we

and then another thing mmm c / spawn

00:05:55.580 --> 00:06:10.120 
and then another thing mmm c / spawn
within<00:05:56.320> that<00:05:57.320> command<00:06:03.280> okay<00:06:05.259> two<00:06:06.259> more<00:06:06.530> oh<00:06:09.130> you

within that command okay two more oh you
can<00:06:10.340> look<00:06:10.759> at<00:06:10.880> all<00:06:10.909> these<00:06:11.210> later<00:06:11.570> but<00:06:11.930> I'm<00:06:12.050> just

00:06:12.219 --> 00:06:12.229 
can look at all these later but I'm just

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:16.270 
can look at all these later but I'm just
gonna<00:06:12.349> that'll<00:06:13.340> be<00:06:13.430> good<00:06:14.530> so<00:06:15.530> we<00:06:15.860> can<00:06:16.009> minimize

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:16.280 
gonna that'll be good so we can minimize

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:20.890 
gonna that'll be good so we can minimize
that<00:06:16.789> and<00:06:17.210> that's<00:06:18.199> delete<00:06:18.740> these<00:06:19.220> two<00:06:19.900> quick

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:20.900 
that and that's delete these two quick

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:28.960 
that and that's delete these two quick
and<00:06:22.090> then<00:06:23.090> we<00:06:23.210> are<00:06:23.389> safe<00:06:25.570> and<00:06:27.370> then<00:06:28.370> I'm<00:06:28.759> gonna

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:28.970 
and then we are safe and then I'm gonna

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:31.409 
and then we are safe and then I'm gonna
minimize<00:06:29.240> this<00:06:29.630> so<00:06:29.840> I<00:06:29.900> know<00:06:29.990> what<00:06:30.440> commands<00:06:30.889> I
