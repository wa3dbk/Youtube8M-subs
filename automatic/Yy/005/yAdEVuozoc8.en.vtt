00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
hope I said that right seed review so

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:28.509 
hope I said that right seed review so
start<00:00:09.630> intro<00:00:22.010> now<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.070> seed<00:00:23.640> is<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:25.010> Keysha

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:28.519 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:32.690 

gator<00:00:29.519> okay<00:00:30.480> just<00:00:31.320> make<00:00:31.679> sure<00:00:31.890> it's<00:00:32.040> all<00:00:32.279> on

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
gator okay just make sure it's all on

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:41.569 
gator okay just make sure it's all on
lowercase<00:00:33.690> okay<00:00:34.020> so<00:00:38.329> gator<00:00:40.129> and<00:00:41.129> then<00:00:41.399> you

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
lowercase okay so gator and then you

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.660 
lowercase okay so gator and then you
won't<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:42.090> hit<00:00:42.300> create<00:00:42.890> you<00:00:43.890> want<00:00:44.070> on<00:00:44.160> infinite

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
won't to hit create you want on infinite

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.500 
won't to hit create you want on infinite
and<00:00:44.820> um<00:00:45.690> you<00:00:46.350> spawn<00:00:46.680> in<00:00:46.890> a<00:00:47.190> tree<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:47.820> it's

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
and um you spawn in a tree and it's

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.220 
and um you spawn in a tree and it's
really<00:00:48.840> nice<00:00:49.050> seed<00:00:49.640> let's<00:00:50.640> just<00:00:50.820> let's<00:00:51.719> build

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
really nice seed let's just let's build

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.250 
really nice seed let's just let's build
the<00:00:52.410> train<00:00:52.710> here<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.610> I'll<00:00:53.789> show<00:00:53.820> you<00:00:54.059> around

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
the train here and I'll show you around

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.639 
the train here and I'll show you around
it's<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:56.039> really<00:00:56.430> nice<00:00:56.610> seed<00:00:56.910> now<00:00:57.390> we<00:00:58.109> go<00:00:58.530> and

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
it's a really nice seed now we go and

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.700 
it's a really nice seed now we go and
options<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.489> let<00:00:59.699> me<00:00:59.789> turn<00:01:00.329> off<00:01:00.480> my<00:01:00.510> hi<00:01:01.320> GUI

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
options and let me turn off my hi GUI

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
just turned this way ninety degree angle

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.789 
just turned this way ninety degree angle
and<00:01:10.040> but<00:01:11.040> buying<00:01:11.340> you're<00:01:12.210> here<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:12.750> it's<00:01:13.590> a

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
and but buying you're here and it's a

and but buying you're here and it's a
really<00:01:14.040> really<00:01:14.610> cool<00:01:14.760> seed<00:01:15.380> there's<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.500> lot<00:01:16.740> of

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
really really cool seed there's a lot of

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.670 
really really cool seed there's a lot of
good<00:01:17.009> resources<00:01:17.400> and<00:01:17.820> everything<00:01:18.330> here<00:01:18.680> and

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
good resources and everything here and

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.120 
good resources and everything here and
I'll<00:01:20.580> just<00:01:20.759> flop<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.570> show<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:21.840> it's<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:22.530> really

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
I'll just flop to show you it's a really

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.149 
I'll just flop to show you it's a really
huge<00:01:23.790> huge<00:01:24.750> biome<00:01:25.580> and<00:01:27.470> the<00:01:28.470> chunks<00:01:28.770> are<00:01:28.890> still

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
huge huge biome and the chunks are still

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.630 
huge huge biome and the chunks are still
loading<00:01:29.460> so<00:01:29.939> this<00:01:30.540> is<00:01:30.720> probably<00:01:31.460> the<00:01:32.460> best

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
loading so this is probably the best

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.050 
loading so this is probably the best
save<00:01:33.000> for<00:01:33.290> this<00:01:34.290> I'm<00:01:34.560> not<00:01:34.740> sure<00:01:34.979> but<00:01:35.310> I<00:01:35.579> really

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
save for this I'm not sure but I really

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.980 
save for this I'm not sure but I really
like<00:01:36.210> this<00:01:36.420> seed<00:01:36.689> I<00:01:37.170> did<00:01:37.860> find<00:01:38.100> it<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:39.030> I<00:01:39.840> hope

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
like this seed I did find it and I hope

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.170 
like this seed I did find it and I hope
