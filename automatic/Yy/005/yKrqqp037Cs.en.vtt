network then we have lower they pay less
out<00:01:09.990> of<00:01:10.020> pocket<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.560> if<00:01:10.680> we're<00:01:10.860> out<00:01:11.040> of

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
out of pocket and if we're out of

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.800 
out of pocket and if we're out of
network<00:01:11.400> then<00:01:11.700> they<00:01:11.790> pay<00:01:12.210> more<00:01:12.510> out<00:01:12.659> of<00:01:12.689> pocket

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
network then they pay more out of pocket

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.320 
network then they pay more out of pocket
yeah<00:01:13.409> insurance<00:01:13.799> pays<00:01:14.010> less<00:01:14.159> on<00:01:14.400> it<00:01:14.549> yeah<00:01:14.909> so

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
the way it works is if the reason

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.679 
the way it works is if the reason
doctors<00:01:17.640> joined<00:01:17.939> PPOs

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
doctors joined PPOs

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.289 
doctors joined PPOs
is<00:01:18.810> because<00:01:19.590> they<00:01:20.070> get<00:01:20.549> on<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.700> list<00:01:20.939> they

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
is because they get on a list they

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.480

discount the fees for the patient and in

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.740 
discount the fees for the patient and in
return<00:01:23.759> they<00:01:23.909> get<00:01:24.030> on<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.210> list<00:01:24.390> so<00:01:24.600> the

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
return they get on the list so the

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
in network because we do marketing and

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.810 
in network because we do marketing and
we<00:01:34.500> get<00:01:34.619> new<00:01:34.710> patients<00:01:35.100> other<00:01:35.220> ways<00:01:35.430> but<00:01:35.640> the

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
we get new patients other ways but the

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.429 
we get new patients other ways but the
difference<00:01:36.210> is<00:01:36.390> we<00:01:36.630> don't<00:01:36.840> have<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.200> follow

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
difference is we don't have to follow

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.319 
difference is we don't have to follow
what<00:01:37.680> they<00:01:37.799> call<00:01:38.009> fee<00:01:38.400> schedule<00:01:38.820> okay<00:01:39.270> so

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
what they call fee schedule okay so

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.660 
what they call fee schedule okay so
those<00:01:39.720> doctors<00:01:40.170> follow<00:01:40.470> like<00:01:40.799> MetLife<00:01:41.340> they

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
those doctors follow like MetLife they

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.069 
those doctors follow like MetLife they
follow<00:01:41.880> their<00:01:42.150> fee<00:01:42.329> schedule<00:01:42.720> when<00:01:42.840> you're<00:01:42.960> in

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
follow their fee schedule when you're in

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.020 
follow their fee schedule when you're in
network<00:01:43.200> what<00:01:44.070> we<00:01:44.250> are<00:01:44.399> is<00:01:44.520> were<00:01:44.670> considered

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
network what we are is were considered

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.719 
network what we are is were considered
UCR<00:01:45.689> or<00:01:46.020> usual<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:46.649> customary<00:01:46.680> so<00:01:47.430> these<00:01:47.549> are

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
UCR or usual and customary so these are

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.960 
UCR or usual and customary so these are
just<00:01:47.880> our<00:01:48.090> normal<00:01:48.390> fees<00:01:49.520> versus<00:01:50.520> what<00:01:50.850> the

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
just our normal fees versus what the

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.240 
just our normal fees versus what the
insurance<00:01:51.390> will<00:01:51.479> pay<00:01:51.630> okay

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
insurance will pay okay

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.950 
insurance will pay okay

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
just like what their annual maximum is

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.560 
just like what their annual maximum is
you<00:01:59.130> know<00:01:59.189> what<00:01:59.280> that<00:01:59.399> is<00:01:59.610> hmm<00:02:00.030> what's<00:02:00.299> that<00:02:00.420> um

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
you know what that is hmm what's that um

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.980 
you know what that is hmm what's that um
it's<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.259> well<00:02:02.219> maximum<00:02:03.119> per<00:02:03.479> year<00:02:03.719> yeah

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
it's the well maximum per year yeah

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.469 
it's the well maximum per year yeah
making<00:02:04.200> use<00:02:04.469> of<00:02:04.640> their<00:02:05.640> insurance<00:02:06.030> perfect

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479

so there's each patient gets a thousand

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.440 
so there's each patient gets a thousand
dollars<00:02:11.340> or<00:02:11.489> fifteen<00:02:11.790> hundreds<00:02:12.060> of

dollars or fifteen hundreds of

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.630 
dollars or fifteen hundreds of
that<00:02:12.569> sometimes<00:02:13.110> there's<00:02:13.319> a<00:02:13.379> family<00:02:13.739> maximum

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
that sometimes there's a family maximum

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.770 
that sometimes there's a family maximum
but<00:02:14.879> most<00:02:15.060> of<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:15.180> time<00:02:15.330> it's<00:02:15.510> just<00:02:15.540> for

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
but most of the time it's just for
