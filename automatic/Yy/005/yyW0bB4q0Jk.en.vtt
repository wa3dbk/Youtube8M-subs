00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
hello and welcome to Gigot place to do

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.610 
hello and welcome to Gigot place to do
tutorials<00:00:11.700> miss<00:00:12.660> tutorials<00:00:13.170> let's

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
tutorials miss tutorials let's

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.950 
tutorials miss tutorials let's
look<00:00:13.769> on<00:00:14.040> some<00:00:14.700> options<00:00:15.450> for<00:00:16.100> their<00:00:17.100> water<00:00:17.960> so

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
look on some options for their water so

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.540 
look on some options for their water so
let's<00:00:19.200> go<00:00:19.410> ahead<00:00:19.529> and<00:00:19.860> we<00:00:19.950> have<00:00:20.130> it<00:00:20.220> several

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
let's go ahead and we have it several

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.670 
let's go ahead and we have it several
ways<00:00:20.700> we<00:00:20.850> can<00:00:21.029> create<00:00:21.300> we<00:00:21.630> can<00:00:21.750> create<00:00:22.020> a<00:00:22.200> local

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
ways we can create we can create a local

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.609 
ways we can create we can create a local
by<00:00:23.250> object<00:00:23.849> and<00:00:24.119> apply<00:00:24.390> water<00:00:24.840> if<00:00:25.200> you<00:00:25.410> add<00:00:25.439> to

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
by object and apply water if you add to

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.980 
by object and apply water if you add to
this<00:00:25.740> or<00:00:25.980> we<00:00:26.550> can<00:00:26.580> go<00:00:26.910> ahead<00:00:27.029> and<00:00:27.450> create<00:00:27.840> the

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
this or we can go ahead and create the

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.929 
this or we can go ahead and create the
water<00:00:28.230> layer<00:00:28.560> so<00:00:29.160> we're<00:00:29.340> going<00:00:29.520> to<00:00:29.700> do<00:00:29.820> right

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
water layer so we're going to do right

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.020 
water layer so we're going to do right
now<00:00:30.000> we'll<00:00:30.899> take<00:00:31.079> our<00:00:31.259> main<00:00:31.500> camera<00:00:32.070> move

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
now we'll take our main camera move

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.410 
now we'll take our main camera move
above<00:00:33.450> and<00:00:33.899> just<00:00:34.200> slightly<00:00:34.680> down<00:00:35.040> as<00:00:35.280> well<00:00:36.149> to

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
above and just slightly down as well to

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.600 
above and just slightly down as well to
see<00:00:36.690> better<00:00:36.960> with<00:00:37.590> water<00:00:37.890> I<00:00:38.160> want<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:38.460> change

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
see better with water I want to change

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:45.440 
see better with water I want to change
the<00:00:38.940> ground<00:00:39.899> material<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:41.239> darker<00:00:42.239> gray<00:00:44.450> as

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
the ground material to darker gray as

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.779 
the ground material to darker gray as
well<00:00:45.510> on<00:00:45.989> my<00:00:46.230> main<00:00:46.440> camera<00:00:46.800> options

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
well on my main camera options

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.520 
well on my main camera options
I<00:00:47.879> want<00:00:48.149> disable<00:00:48.980> their<00:00:50.030> actual<00:00:51.030> alpha<00:00:51.600> the

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
I want disable their actual alpha the

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.950 
I want disable their actual alpha the
gamma<00:00:52.800> correction<00:00:53.129> so<00:00:53.969> we'll<00:00:54.239> give<00:00:54.359> it<00:00:54.480> us<00:00:54.690> a

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
gamma correction so we'll give it us a

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.799 
gamma correction so we'll give it us a
little<00:00:55.410> bit<00:00:55.559> more<00:00:55.859> or<00:00:56.070> less<00:00:56.219> washout<00:00:56.640> image<00:00:57.269> so

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
little bit more or less washout image so

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.349 
little bit more or less washout image so
I<00:00:57.899> can<00:00:57.929> preview<00:01:01.579> okay<00:01:02.579> right<00:01:02.820> here<00:01:02.999> you<00:01:03.149> can

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
I can preview okay right here you can

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.200 
I can preview okay right here you can
see<00:01:03.539> we<00:01:03.690> have<00:01:03.839> it<00:01:03.929> our<00:01:04.110> water<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:05.210> nestlings

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
see we have it our water and nestlings

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.020 
see we have it our water and nestlings
but<00:01:06.600> view<00:01:07.110> by<00:01:07.409> default<00:01:07.490> the<00:01:08.490> water<00:01:08.760> is

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
but view by default the water is

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.050 
but view by default the water is
animated<00:01:09.870> if<00:01:10.020> using<00:01:10.440> those<00:01:10.560> layers<00:01:10.909> so<00:01:11.909> by

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
animated if using those layers so by

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.680 
animated if using those layers so by
doing<00:01:12.390> we<00:01:12.659> can<00:01:12.840> actually<00:01:13.590> open<00:01:14.690> material

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:15.690 
doing we can actually open material

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.380 
doing we can actually open material
editor<00:01:15.870> go<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.380> default<00:01:16.830> water<00:01:17.250> on<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:17.910> bumps

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
editor go to default water on a bumps

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.270 
editor go to default water on a bumps
edit<00:01:18.840> function<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:19.590> you'll<00:01:19.950> notice<00:01:20.250> right

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
edit function and you'll notice right

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.510 
edit function and you'll notice right
here<00:01:20.550> we<00:01:21.030> have<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.180> meta<00:01:21.660> node<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.280> if<00:01:23.280> we<00:01:23.400> open

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
here we have a meta node and if we open

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.030 
here we have a meta node and if we open
the<00:01:23.760> meta<00:01:23.940> node<00:01:24.210> inside<00:01:24.720> you<00:01:24.900> can<00:01:25.110> notice<00:01:25.380> it's

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
the meta node inside you can notice it's

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.060 
the meta node inside you can notice it's
assigned<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.910> vector<00:01:27.150> outputs<00:01:27.990> so<00:01:28.950> it's

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
assigned to the vector outputs so it's

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.660 
assigned to the vector outputs so it's
creating<00:01:29.550> some<00:01:29.660> animations<00:01:30.660> waterfalls<00:01:31.670> okay

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
creating some animations waterfalls okay

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.690 
creating some animations waterfalls okay
we<00:01:32.940> do<00:01:33.150> have<00:01:33.420> it<00:01:33.540> options<00:01:34.140> which<00:01:35.070> providing

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
we do have it options which providing

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.880 
we do have it options which providing
from<00:01:35.880> other<00:01:36.060> ones<00:01:36.240> for<00:01:36.480> us<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.810> manipulate<00:01:37.590> and

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
from other ones for us to manipulate and

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.270 
from other ones for us to manipulate and
adjust<00:01:38.400> how<00:01:39.000> we<00:01:39.060> want<00:01:39.510> this<00:01:39.690> water<00:01:40.050> come<00:01:40.950> work

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
adjust how we want this water come work

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.430 
adjust how we want this water come work
and<00:01:41.580> we<00:01:41.850> can<00:01:42.000> access<00:01:42.150> this<00:01:42.630> through<00:01:43.320> the

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:43.440 
and we can access this through the

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.600 
and we can access this through the
function<00:01:43.890> editor<00:01:44.370> or<00:01:45.350> we<00:01:46.350> can<00:01:46.530> go<00:01:46.710> edit<00:01:47.010> object

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
function editor or we can go edit object

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.130 
function editor or we can go edit object
and<00:01:47.990> work<00:01:48.990> with<00:01:49.440> a<00:01:49.470> water<00:01:49.920> surface<00:01:50.480> editor<00:01:51.480> so

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
and work with a water surface editor so

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.190 
and work with a water surface editor so
example<00:01:52.830> like<00:01:53.310> in<00:01:53.520> this<00:01:53.640> case<00:01:53.990> within<00:01:54.990> global

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
example like in this case within global

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.620 
example like in this case within global
wave<00:01:55.560> control<00:01:56.160> so<00:01:56.400> we<00:01:56.520> can<00:01:56.700> create<00:01:57.000> very<00:01:57.270> fast

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
wave control so we can create very fast

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.590 
wave control so we can create very fast
if<00:01:58.200> we<00:01:58.380> disable<00:01:58.740> we<00:01:59.040> have<00:01:59.190> it<00:01:59.280> options<00:01:59.850> to

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
if we disable we have it options to

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.940 
if we disable we have it options to
apply<00:02:02.540> individual<00:02:03.540> settings<00:02:04.080> and<00:02:04.290> again<00:02:04.650> this

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
apply individual settings and again this

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.029 
apply individual settings and again this
is<00:02:05.160> will<00:02:05.340> apply<00:02:05.670> as<00:02:05.880> animated<00:02:06.750> as<00:02:06.960> well<00:02:07.230> so<00:02:07.920> we

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
is will apply as animated as well so we

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.589 
is will apply as animated as well so we
can<00:02:08.190> change<00:02:08.429> direction<00:02:08.819> of<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.179> wind

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
can change direction of the wind

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.580 
can change direction of the wind
let's<00:02:10.140> pop<00:02:10.349> up<00:02:10.530> amount<00:02:10.920> of<00:02:11.519> the<00:02:11.610> waves<00:02:12.290> okay<00:02:13.290> we

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
let's pop up amount of the waves okay we

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.130 
let's pop up amount of the waves okay we
also<00:02:13.830> if<00:02:14.580> we<00:02:14.730> apply<00:02:14.970> displacement<00:02:15.750> it<00:02:15.900> will

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
also if we apply displacement it will

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.920 
also if we apply displacement it will
actually<00:02:16.349> can<00:02:17.340> see<00:02:17.550> more<00:02:17.849> horizon<00:02:18.540> but<00:02:18.660> I've

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
actually can see more horizon but I've

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.520 
actually can see more horizon but I've
at<00:02:19.620> this<00:02:19.769> point<00:02:20.010> I<00:02:20.129> don't<00:02:20.190> want<00:02:21.079> to<00:02:22.079> preserve

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
at this point I don't want to preserve

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.900 
at this point I don't want to preserve
some<00:02:22.709> time<00:02:23.569> or<00:02:24.569> go<00:02:24.989> to<00:02:25.469> apply

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
some time or go to apply

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.020 
some time or go to apply
maybe<00:02:27.150> a<00:02:27.180> bit<00:02:27.540> more<00:02:27.570> windy<00:02:28.200> density<00:02:29.030> tracing

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
maybe a bit more windy density tracing

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.120 
maybe a bit more windy density tracing
in<00:02:30.210> Japanese<00:02:30.900> so<00:02:31.290> hear<00:02:31.620> it<00:02:31.680> quite<00:02:31.950> a<00:02:32.070> bit

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
in Japanese so hear it quite a bit

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:37.040 
in Japanese so hear it quite a bit
stormy<00:02:33.320> right<00:02:34.320> here<00:02:34.680> we<00:02:34.830> also<00:02:35.040> can<00:02:35.790> apply<00:02:36.050> form

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
stormy right here we also can apply form

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.500 
stormy right here we also can apply form
and<00:02:37.350> let's<00:02:38.070> go<00:02:38.340> over<00:02:39.380> way<00:02:40.380> so<00:02:40.440> we<00:02:40.800> have<00:02:40.830> it<00:02:41.070> more

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
and let's go over way so we have it more

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:47.150 
and let's go over way so we have it more
from<00:02:42.510> going<00:02:42.900> over<00:02:43.700> okay<00:02:45.710> let's<00:02:46.710> make<00:02:46.890> the

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
from going over okay let's make the

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.060 
from going over okay let's make the
water<00:02:47.700> a<00:02:47.850> little<00:02:48.000> bit<00:02:48.740> more<00:02:49.740> interesting<00:02:50.430> in

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
water a little bit more interesting in

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.950 
water a little bit more interesting in
color<00:02:53.070> wise<00:02:53.370> so<00:02:53.820> okay<00:02:54.150> with<00:02:54.300> the<00:02:54.420> depth<00:02:54.690> this

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 
color wise so okay with the depth this

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.220 
color wise so okay with the depth this
one<00:02:55.260> will<00:02:55.560> go<00:02:55.740> on<00:02:55.770> transparency<00:02:56.520> a<00:02:57.230> darkness

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
one will go on transparency a darkness

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.740 
one will go on transparency a darkness
and<00:02:58.530> reflection<00:02:59.130> this<00:03:00.060> is<00:03:00.240> just<00:03:00.450> simple

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
and reflection this is just simple

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.350 
and reflection this is just simple
settings<00:03:01.230> again<00:03:02.190> in<00:03:02.280> this<00:03:02.430> point<00:03:02.700> if<00:03:03.000> we<00:03:03.060> go

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
settings again in this point if we go

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.350 
settings again in this point if we go
ahead<00:03:03.720> and<00:03:03.990> enable<00:03:04.530> animations<00:03:05.280> so<00:03:06.000> let's<00:03:06.180> go

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
ahead and enable animations so let's go

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.150 
ahead and enable animations so let's go
ahead<00:03:06.480> here<00:03:08.180> we'll<00:03:09.180> go<00:03:09.770> click<00:03:10.770> on<00:03:10.890> animation

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
ahead here we'll go click on animation

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.110 
ahead here we'll go click on animation
tab<00:03:11.790> I<00:03:12.030> will<00:03:12.540> leave<00:03:12.660> it<00:03:12.780> as<00:03:12.930> a<00:03:12.990> preview<00:03:14.120> and

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
tab I will leave it as a preview and

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.970 
tab I will leave it as a preview and
we'll<00:03:15.360> just<00:03:15.570> go<00:03:15.720> all<00:03:16.110> this<00:03:16.230> water<00:03:17.930> okay<00:03:18.960> um<00:03:19.230> one

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
we'll just go all this water okay um one

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.290 
we'll just go all this water okay um one
thing<00:03:20.190> you<00:03:20.310> notice<00:03:20.460> we<00:03:20.700> don't<00:03:20.820> have<00:03:21.030> it<00:03:21.120> any

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 
thing you notice we don't have it any

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.720 
thing you notice we don't have it any
time<00:03:21.570> so<00:03:21.840> if<00:03:21.930> we<00:03:22.080> try<00:03:22.620> to<00:03:22.740> render<00:03:23.190> sequence

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
time so if we try to render sequence

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.090 
time so if we try to render sequence
it's<00:03:23.910> going<00:03:24.120> to<00:03:24.210> happen<00:03:24.540> so<00:03:25.380> let's<00:03:25.500> go<00:03:25.740> ahead

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
it's going to happen so let's go ahead

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:31.070 
it's going to happen so let's go ahead
add<00:03:26.850> to<00:03:27.570> our<00:03:27.600> camera<00:03:29.510> here<00:03:30.510> select<00:03:30.750> main

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
add to our camera here select main

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.120 
add to our camera here select main
camera<00:03:31.590> we'll<00:03:31.920> add<00:03:32.570> keyframe<00:03:33.800> let's<00:03:34.800> go<00:03:34.980> move

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
camera we'll add keyframe let's go move

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.930 
camera we'll add keyframe let's go move
maybe<00:03:35.430> about<00:03:35.700> four<00:03:36.090> seconds<00:03:37.700> we'll<00:03:38.700> add

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
maybe about four seconds we'll add

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.010 
maybe about four seconds we'll add
another<00:03:39.260> keyframe<00:03:41.360> okay<00:03:42.360> will<00:03:42.600> select<00:03:42.960> here

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:43.020 
another keyframe okay will select here

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.790 
another keyframe okay will select here
will<00:03:43.320> go<00:03:43.620> to<00:03:43.650> preview<00:03:44.220> also<00:03:45.150> um<00:03:45.420> I'm<00:03:45.840> going<00:03:46.140> 24

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800 
will go to preview also um I'm going 24

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:53.450 
will go to preview also um I'm going 24
frames<00:03:47.160> and<00:03:47.550> I'll<00:03:48.510> just<00:03:48.810> render<00:03:49.200> 640<00:03:50.660> okay<00:03:52.460> now

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:53.460 
frames and I'll just render 640 okay now

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.310 
frames and I'll just render 640 okay now
just<00:03:53.700> set<00:03:54.060> other<00:03:54.420> ones<00:03:54.630> in<00:03:54.840> a<00:03:54.930> little<00:03:55.110> start

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
just set other ones in a little start

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:59.060 
just set other ones in a little start
render<00:03:55.740> so<00:03:56.610> you'll<00:03:56.820> notice<00:03:57.090> it<00:03:57.450> will<00:03:58.070> take

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
render so you'll notice it will take

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.310 
render so you'll notice it will take
little<00:03:59.280> bit<00:03:59.520> time<00:03:59.820> to<00:03:59.850> render<00:04:00.450> so<00:04:00.690> I'm<00:04:00.959> going

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
little bit time to render so I'm going

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.680 
little bit time to render so I'm going
to<00:04:01.530> pause<00:04:01.830> this<00:04:02.160> tutorials<00:04:02.670> and<00:04:03.240> we'll<00:04:03.450> come

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
to pause this tutorials and we'll come

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:08.030 
to pause this tutorials and we'll come
back<00:04:03.900> after<00:04:04.140> a<00:04:04.770> render<00:04:05.550> is<00:04:05.670> completed<00:04:06.980> okay<00:04:07.980> so

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
back after a render is completed okay so

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.760 
back after a render is completed okay so
right<00:04:08.520> here<00:04:08.550> we<00:04:09.360> have<00:04:09.390> to<00:04:09.660> finish<00:04:09.840> animation

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:10.770 
right here we have to finish animation

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:12.830 
right here we have to finish animation
you<00:04:11.370> can<00:04:11.520> see<00:04:11.700> it's<00:04:11.820> going<00:04:11.970> quite<00:04:12.240> a<00:04:12.360> bit<00:04:12.570> fast

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
you can see it's going quite a bit fast

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.160 
you can see it's going quite a bit fast
but<00:04:13.140> overall<00:04:13.620> idea<00:04:13.950> of<00:04:14.040> this<00:04:14.330> you<00:04:15.330> can<00:04:15.540> see<00:04:15.810> how

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:16.170 
but overall idea of this you can see how

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:20.260 
but overall idea of this you can see how
they'll<00:04:16.500> affect<00:04:17.810> apply<00:04:18.810> to<00:04:19.380> mowing<00:04:19.650> quarter

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:20.270 
they'll affect apply to mowing quarter

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:23.620 
they'll affect apply to mowing quarter
so<00:04:21.270> this<00:04:21.510> is<00:04:21.690> one<00:04:21.989> way<00:04:22.200> we<00:04:22.410> can<00:04:22.440> do<00:04:22.830> with<00:04:23.070> the

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
so this is one way we can do with the

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:29.560 
so this is one way we can do with the
predefined<00:04:24.630> okay<00:04:25.230> let's<00:04:25.470> delete<00:04:26.130> this<00:04:26.370> one

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:31.910 

okay<00:04:30.570> also

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:31.920 
okay also

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.410 
okay also
let's<00:04:32.070> go<00:04:32.160> look<00:04:32.340> on<00:04:32.460> another<00:04:32.490> ways<00:04:32.970> we<00:04:33.150> can<00:04:33.300> do

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:33.420 
let's go look on another ways we can do

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:35.990 
let's go look on another ways we can do
it<00:04:33.510> so<00:04:34.230> for<00:04:34.500> example<00:04:34.950> I'm<00:04:35.070> going<00:04:35.130> create<00:04:35.970> a

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
it so for example I'm going create a

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.130 
it so for example I'm going create a
cube<00:04:39.350> okay<00:04:40.350> we'll<00:04:40.680> go<00:04:40.860> take<00:04:41.040> our<00:04:41.280> main<00:04:41.520> camera

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:42.140 
cube okay we'll go take our main camera

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:48.380 
cube okay we'll go take our main camera
we<00:04:43.140> put<00:04:43.380> to<00:04:43.560> the<00:04:43.650> side<00:04:43.950> of<00:04:44.130> the<00:04:44.250> cube<00:04:47.120> as<00:04:48.120> well

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:48.390 
we put to the side of the cube as well

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:52.850 
we put to the side of the cube as well
you<00:04:48.570> would<00:04:48.810> let<00:04:49.020> me<00:04:51.200> destroy<00:04:52.200> animation<00:04:52.680> for

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
you would let me destroy animation for

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:59.810 
you would let me destroy animation for
the<00:04:52.950> camera<00:04:57.740> and<00:04:58.740> I<00:04:58.920> want<00:04:59.100> to<00:04:59.160> see<00:04:59.280> kind<00:04:59.520> of<00:04:59.640> a

00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820 
the camera and I want to see kind of a

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.650 
the camera and I want to see kind of a
Jewess<00:05:00.630> and<00:05:00.990> next<00:05:01.860> in<00:05:02.040> a<00:05:02.130> cube<00:05:02.460> we'll<00:05:02.940> going<00:05:03.180> to

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 
Jewess and next in a cube we'll going to

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:09.440 
Jewess and next in a cube we'll going to
modify<00:05:05.480> will<00:05:06.480> go<00:05:06.660> to<00:05:07.670> punch<00:05:08.670> in<00:05:08.940> the<00:05:09.000> editor

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.450 
modify will go to punch in the editor

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:11.150 
modify will go to punch in the editor
let's<00:05:09.690> go<00:05:09.870> for<00:05:10.110> the<00:05:10.170> bombs<00:05:10.410> so<00:05:10.830> we'll<00:05:11.010> go<00:05:11.130> to

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:11.160 
let's go for the bombs so we'll go to

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:16.960 
let's go for the bombs so we'll go to
edit<00:05:14.240> okay<00:05:15.240> and<00:05:15.450> we're<00:05:15.600> going<00:05:15.750> to<00:05:15.870> create<00:05:16.260> a

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:16.970 
edit okay and we're going to create a

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:20.930 
edit okay and we're going to create a
frog<00:05:17.970> doll<00:05:18.240> and<00:05:18.570> one<00:05:19.470> has<00:05:19.680> things<00:05:19.950> in<00:05:20.100> the<00:05:20.220> frag

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 
frog doll and one has things in the frag

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:26.060 
frog doll and one has things in the frag
dolls<00:05:22.400> right<00:05:23.400> here<00:05:23.730> we<00:05:23.880> have<00:05:24.060> one<00:05:24.420> option<00:05:25.070> to

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:26.070 
dolls right here we have one option to

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:31.340 
dolls right here we have one option to
select<00:05:27.380> and<00:05:28.400> the<00:05:29.400> water<00:05:29.670> fractal<00:05:30.480> open<00:05:30.870> ocean

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:31.350 
select and the water fractal open ocean

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:34.130 
select and the water fractal open ocean
so<00:05:32.250> in<00:05:32.310> open<00:05:32.730> ocean<00:05:32.880> you<00:05:33.330> will<00:05:33.480> notice<00:05:33.870> also

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:34.140 
so in open ocean you will notice also

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:36.620 
so in open ocean you will notice also
this<00:05:34.500> point<00:05:34.860> right<00:05:35.100> here<00:05:35.160> we're<00:05:36.120> connecting

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:36.630 
this point right here we're connecting

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:39.290 
this point right here we're connecting
to<00:05:36.810> the<00:05:36.930> time<00:05:37.350> so<00:05:38.160> it's<00:05:38.280> meaning<00:05:38.640> theses<00:05:39.060> will

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 
to the time so it's meaning theses will

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.950 
to the time so it's meaning theses will
change<00:05:39.780> in<00:05:40.020> time<00:05:40.530> I'm<00:05:40.860> not<00:05:41.090> such<00:05:42.090> meaning<00:05:42.480> that

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 
change in time I'm not such meaning that

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.740 
change in time I'm not such meaning that
it<00:05:43.140> will<00:05:43.410> be<00:05:43.530> animated<00:05:44.190> and<00:05:44.430> you<00:05:45.420> notice<00:05:45.720> we

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:45.750 
it will be animated and you notice we

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:47.900 
it will be animated and you notice we
have<00:05:46.020> all<00:05:46.320> of<00:05:46.590> these<00:05:46.710> options<00:05:46.950> as<00:05:47.370> before<00:05:47.760> the

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:47.910 
have all of these options as before the

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:51.410 
have all of these options as before the
wind<00:05:48.210> the<00:05:48.600> waves<00:05:48.870> and<00:05:49.400> other<00:05:50.400> ones<00:05:50.760> so<00:05:51.180> we'll

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:51.420 
wind the waves and other ones so we'll

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:52.450 
wind the waves and other ones so we'll
click<00:05:51.660> OK

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:52.460 
click OK

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:57.770 
click OK
let's<00:05:53.630> increase<00:05:54.630> a<00:05:54.990> bit<00:05:55.260> amount<00:05:56.390> of<00:05:57.390> the<00:05:57.570> water

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:57.780 
let's increase a bit amount of the water

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:02.840 
let's increase a bit amount of the water
on<00:05:58.020> the<00:05:58.080> side<00:05:59.420> click<00:06:00.420> OK<00:06:00.780> again<00:06:01.700> stick<00:06:02.700> our

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:02.850 
on the side click OK again stick our

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:09.440 
on the side click OK again stick our
main<00:06:03.090> camera<00:06:06.320> just<00:06:07.320> place<00:06:07.710> it<00:06:07.920> down<00:06:08.300> again<00:06:09.300> we

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:09.450 
main camera just place it down again we

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:12.080 
main camera just place it down again we
can<00:06:09.600> go<00:06:09.870> ahead<00:06:09.990> and<00:06:10.440> try<00:06:11.010> animate<00:06:11.610> so<00:06:11.970> I'm

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:12.090 
can go ahead and try animate so I'm

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:16.160 
can go ahead and try animate so I'm
going<00:06:12.540> to<00:06:13.160> add<00:06:14.160> keyframe<00:06:15.120> to<00:06:15.360> this<00:06:15.510> point<00:06:15.840> and

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:16.170 
going to add keyframe to this point and

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:17.930 
going to add keyframe to this point and
maybe<00:06:16.650> not<00:06:16.860> even<00:06:16.980> two<00:06:17.310> seconds<00:06:17.730> should<00:06:17.910> be

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:17.940 
maybe not even two seconds should be

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:27.500 
maybe not even two seconds should be
enough<00:06:23.150> yeah

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:27.510 

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:30.740 

to<00:06:27.660> a<00:06:27.690> proper<00:06:28.200> ease<00:06:29.210> schedule<00:06:30.210> right<00:06:30.450> here<00:06:30.720> I

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:30.750 
to a proper ease schedule right here I

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:36.700 
to a proper ease schedule right here I
need<00:06:30.900> disabled<00:06:32.090> it<00:06:33.090> will<00:06:33.300> go<00:06:33.570> to<00:06:33.990> two<00:06:34.890> seconds

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:36.710 
need disabled it will go to two seconds

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:39.380 
need disabled it will go to two seconds
pull<00:06:37.710> ahead<00:06:37.860> another<00:06:38.340> key<00:06:38.640> so<00:06:38.850> we<00:06:38.940> have<00:06:39.120> it<00:06:39.210> our

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:39.390 
pull ahead another key so we have it our

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:44.950 
pull ahead another key so we have it our
animations<00:06:40.280> you<00:06:41.280> know<00:06:41.400> let's<00:06:41.850> go<00:06:42.090> ahead<00:06:42.240> um

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:44.960 

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:49.070 

router<00:06:45.960> -<00:06:46.380> we'll<00:06:46.650> go<00:06:47.510> render<00:06:48.510> this<00:06:48.660> animation

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:49.080 
router - we'll go render this animation

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:51.200 
router - we'll go render this animation
and<00:06:49.320> again<00:06:49.530> I'll<00:06:50.070> come<00:06:50.430> back<00:06:50.610> as<00:06:50.850> soon<00:06:50.880> when

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:51.210 
and again I'll come back as soon when

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:52.580 
and again I'll come back as soon when
it's<00:06:51.360> done<00:06:51.540> and<00:06:51.750> it<00:06:51.840> should<00:06:52.050> be<00:06:52.200> actually<00:06:52.530> you

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:52.590 
it's done and it should be actually you

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:54.110 
it's done and it should be actually you
can<00:06:52.770> see<00:06:53.010> it's<00:06:53.160> going<00:06:53.400> to<00:06:53.490> bypass<00:06:53.640> because

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:54.120 
can see it's going to bypass because

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.690 
can see it's going to bypass because
this<00:06:55.020> is<00:06:55.200> not<00:06:55.320> even<00:06:55.590> transparent<00:06:56.190> material

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:56.700 
this is not even transparent material

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:59.840 
this is not even transparent material
but<00:06:57.300> I<00:06:57.600> want<00:06:57.870> to<00:06:57.990> see<00:06:58.230> how<00:06:58.950> they<00:06:59.190> simple<00:06:59.670> with

00:06:59.840 --> 00:06:59.850 
but I want to see how they simple with

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:02.150 
but I want to see how they simple with
the<00:07:00.000> predefined<00:07:00.750> function<00:07:01.560> we<00:07:01.710> can<00:07:01.860> already

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:02.160 
the predefined function we can already

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:06.200 
the predefined function we can already
create<00:07:02.750> water<00:07:03.750> effect<00:07:04.790> okay<00:07:05.790> so<00:07:05.850> right<00:07:06.180> here

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:06.210 
create water effect okay so right here

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:09.020 
create water effect okay so right here
we<00:07:06.570> finish<00:07:06.900> animations<00:07:07.530> and<00:07:07.860> let's<00:07:08.190> look<00:07:08.430> you

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:09.030 
we finish animations and let's look you

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:11.060 
we finish animations and let's look you
can<00:07:09.240> see<00:07:09.450> how<00:07:09.480> we<00:07:09.720> apply<00:07:09.870> the<00:07:10.200> waves<00:07:10.560> of<00:07:10.830> course

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:11.070 
can see how we apply the waves of course

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:12.970 
can see how we apply the waves of course
the<00:07:11.160> animation<00:07:11.610> is<00:07:11.730> too<00:07:12.090> fast<00:07:12.390> we<00:07:12.690> need

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:12.980 
the animation is too fast we need

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:16.850 
the animation is too fast we need
slowdown<00:07:13.980> but<00:07:14.540> with<00:07:15.540> the<00:07:15.660> wave<00:07:15.960> effects<00:07:16.500> we

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:16.860 
slowdown but with the wave effects we

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:20.000 
slowdown but with the wave effects we
applied<00:07:17.220> to<00:07:17.250> the<00:07:17.670> just<00:07:18.150> simple<00:07:18.570> terrain<00:07:19.010> by

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:20.010 
applied to the just simple terrain by

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:23.480 
applied to the just simple terrain by
using<00:07:20.250> again<00:07:20.730> our<00:07:21.000> function<00:07:21.960> editor<00:07:22.680> so<00:07:23.220> again

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:23.490 
using again our function editor so again

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:26.600 
using again our function editor so again
let's<00:07:23.790> look<00:07:23.880> again<00:07:24.120> one<00:07:24.780> more<00:07:24.960> time<00:07:25.020> and<00:07:25.920> right

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:26.610 
let's look again one more time and right

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:30.800 
let's look again one more time and right
here<00:07:26.970> if<00:07:27.270> you<00:07:27.630> using<00:07:27.810> the<00:07:29.600> animations<00:07:30.600> or

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:30.810 
here if you using the animations or

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:33.920 
here if you using the animations or
ocean<00:07:31.260> preset<00:07:31.770> with<00:07:31.950> meta<00:07:32.340> um<00:07:32.820> node<00:07:33.270> you<00:07:33.780> have

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:33.930 
ocean preset with meta um node you have

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:36.950 
ocean preset with meta um node you have
a<00:07:34.020> little<00:07:34.290> bit<00:07:34.380> more<00:07:34.680> complex<00:07:35.390> but<00:07:36.390> it's<00:07:36.630> again

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:36.960 
a little bit more complex but it's again

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:43.580 
a little bit more complex but it's again
its<00:07:37.140> base<00:07:37.380> it<00:07:37.680> on<00:07:37.830> this<00:07:38.790> fractal<00:07:39.720> node<00:07:42.530> okay<00:07:43.530> so

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:43.590 
its base it on this fractal node okay so

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:46.400 
its base it on this fractal node okay so
right<00:07:43.860> here<00:07:44.180> always<00:07:45.180> we<00:07:45.600> can<00:07:45.750> create<00:07:46.020> it<00:07:46.230> and

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:46.410 
right here always we can create it and

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:48.050 
right here always we can create it and
again<00:07:46.680> when<00:07:46.890> you're<00:07:46.980> done<00:07:47.220> with<00:07:47.430> this<00:07:47.640> you<00:07:47.880> can

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:48.060 
again when you're done with this you can

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:49.400 
again when you're done with this you can
always<00:07:48.360> get<00:07:48.780> and<00:07:48.900> go<00:07:48.960> inside<00:07:49.260> the

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:49.410 
always get and go inside the

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:51.950
