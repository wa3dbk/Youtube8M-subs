00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
cuz you know Kakashi I originally

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.060 
cuz you know Kakashi I originally
thought<00:03:46.880> that<00:03:47.150> you<00:03:47.570> know<00:03:47.690> if<00:03:47.930> obito<00:03:48.620> was<00:03:48.830> going

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:49.070 
thought that you know if obito was going

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:52.030 
thought that you know if obito was going
to<00:03:49.190> die<00:03:49.370> obito<00:03:50.300> was<00:03:50.570> going<00:03:50.930> to<00:03:51.080> give<00:03:51.290> Kakashi

his<00:03:52.430> to<00:03:52.610> Sharingan<00:03:53.180> I<00:03:53.420> basically<00:03:53.810> thought

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
his to Sharingan I basically thought

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.300 
his to Sharingan I basically thought
that<00:03:54.440> you<00:03:54.500> know<00:03:54.590> he<00:03:54.740> would<00:03:54.860> get<00:03:55.040> both

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
that you know he would get both

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.280 
that you know he would get both
Sharingan<00:03:56.240> even<00:03:56.750> though<00:03:56.840> it's<00:03:56.960> going<00:03:57.080> to<00:03:57.140> be<00:03:57.260> a

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
Sharingan even though it's going to be a

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.230 
Sharingan even though it's going to be a
