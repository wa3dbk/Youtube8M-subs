run<00:01:54.360> each<00:01:54.479> line<00:01:54.750> parallel<00:01:55.250> using<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.549> tag<00:01:56.790> and

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
run each line parallel using the tag and

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.179 
run each line parallel using the tag and
the<00:01:57.210> main<00:01:57.450> line<00:01:57.719> make<00:01:58.200> three<00:01:58.560> loose<00:01:58.829> wraps

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
the main line make three loose wraps

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.569 
the main line make three loose wraps
around<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.640> leader<00:01:59.850> then<00:02:00.689> from<00:02:01.350> behind

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:01.579 
around the leader then from behind

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:04.160 
around the leader then from behind
insert<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:02.729> tag<00:02:03.000> in<00:02:03.240> through<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.719> middle<00:02:04.049> of

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
insert the tag in through the middle of

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.149 
insert the tag in through the middle of
the<00:02:04.290> three<00:02:04.469> loops

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
the three loops

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.119 
the three loops
and<00:02:05.249> tighten<00:02:05.640> loosely<00:02:06.079> next<00:02:07.079> repeat<00:02:07.950> these

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
and tighten loosely next repeat these

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.580 
and tighten loosely next repeat these
same<00:02:08.459> steps<00:02:08.569> using<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.660> leader<00:02:09.869> materials<00:02:10.440> to

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
same steps using the leader materials to

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.369 
same steps using the leader materials to
wrap<00:02:10.800> around<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:11.280> main<00:02:11.459> line<00:02:11.750> the<00:02:12.750> final<00:02:13.140> step

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
wrap around the main line the final step

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:15.199 
wrap around the main line the final step
is<00:02:13.530> to<00:02:13.680> moisten<00:02:13.890> with<00:02:14.220> a<00:02:14.250> bit<00:02:14.489> of<00:02:14.580> saliva<00:02:14.730> and

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
is to moisten with a bit of saliva and

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.410 
is to moisten with a bit of saliva and
draw<00:02:15.750> both<00:02:15.989> not<00:02:16.260> right<00:02:16.769> together<00:02:17.180> now<00:02:18.180> that's

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
draw both not right together now that's

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.059 
draw both not right together now that's
the<00:02:18.599> double<00:02:18.870> Centauri<00:02:19.349> and<00:02:19.530> it's<00:02:19.680> a<00:02:19.769> very<00:02:19.980> easy

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
the double Centauri and it's a very easy

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.460 
the double Centauri and it's a very easy
knot<00:02:20.580> to<00:02:20.760> tie<00:02:20.970> but<00:02:21.510> what<00:02:21.750> really<00:02:21.989> matters<00:02:22.260> is

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
knot to tie but what really matters is

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.860 
knot to tie but what really matters is
strength<00:02:22.980> can<00:02:23.400> it<00:02:23.519> beat<00:02:23.670> the<00:02:23.790> yucatan<00:02:24.269> let's
