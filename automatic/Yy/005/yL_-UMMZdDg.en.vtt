00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:05.080
 standing in the lübbener brunnenstraße 

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:07.750
 eight wells 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:11.170
 It turns into about 1 8 million daily 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:14.080
 liters of groundwater from eight to 14 meters 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:16.510
 deep high and to the waterworks point in the 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.550
 Water works will be the first oxygen in 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:21.699
 given the future drinking water 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.859
 That's how iron and manganese dissolve 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:26.169
 without this filtering would be the water 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:29.019
 brown in the four blue containers 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:32.560
 there is filter gravel through this 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:35.130
 runs 100,000 liters of water per hour 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.690
 can iron oxide and manganese 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.010
 be filtered out 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.500
 then press the three dots 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:44.110
 the drinking water in the lena city ​​network 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:47.800
 short hand washing and drinking water 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:50.380
 the sewage is returned to the sewage 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.390
 Once again in a pumping station this will be 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:55.510
 water in the next free fall 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:58.150
 line pumped in the sewage plant arrived 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.930
 it gets mechanical with a seventh 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.840
 cleaned 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:04.470
 anything bigger than a millimeter 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:07.020
 is screened in the aeration tank 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.520
 the biological cleaning takes place 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.460
 Bacteria eat the wastewater 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.229
 And clean so that water pollutants 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.310
 Like heavy metals are also 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:17.920
 recorded 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.710
 the so-called bacteria form colonies 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.259
 the mud in this clarifier 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.630
 flocculate to the ground and then sink again 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:26.229
 pumped back to the aeration tank too 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.450
 become 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:30.520
 through the left tube flows 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.009
 mechanically cleaned water in the 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.170
 Aeration tank flows in the right ear 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:37.689
 the mud from the clarification again 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.939
 back to the mechanical and 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:43.179
 Biological purification is the water too 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:45.310
 about 90 percent cleaned the wastewater 

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:48.039
 looks like clear again 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:51.009
 drinking water in dry cleaning 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:53.920
 binds iron III chloride sulfate to the 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:56.469
 funds in front of the eg by detergent in 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.109
 the sewage comes the rest dirt 

00:01:56.469 --> 00:02:00.609
 then settles as mud in the 

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:03.609
 Training pond should be cleaned 

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:05.499
 sewage is better the water comes 

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:08.470
 after a short stay still 

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:09.940
 once to the ur and rest flakes put 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.010
 off 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.600
 clarifier georg niebisch checks 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.870
 weekly the phosphorus and nitrogen 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:19.510
 content of purified wastewater up to 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:23.550
 810 milligrams of nitrogen per liter 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:25.600
 in gaps it is 23 milligrams 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.120
 in the end, the former flows 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.790
 digging water to drinking water and then 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.610
 to wastewater was called purified water 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:36.010
 into a drainage ditch in the 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:39.270
 Spree where to share it again 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.270
 groundwater passes
