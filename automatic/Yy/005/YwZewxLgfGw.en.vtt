amazing second round and after that we

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.470 
amazing second round and after that we
knew<00:03:06.709> it's<00:03:07.069> just<00:03:07.250> a<00:03:07.340> matter<00:03:07.519> of<00:03:07.639> keep<00:03:08.239> playing

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
knew it's just a matter of keep playing

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.449 
knew it's just a matter of keep playing
good<00:03:08.690> that<00:03:08.930> with<00:03:09.260> when<00:03:09.889> you<00:03:09.980> invent<00:03:10.250> a<00:03:10.310> have<00:03:10.430> a

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
good that with when you invent a have a

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:23.360 
good that with when you invent a have a
chance

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.710 

well<00:03:24.370> I<00:03:24.790> think<00:03:25.830> I<00:03:26.830> mean<00:03:27.670> overall<00:03:28.030> she's<00:03:28.450> very

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
well I think I mean overall she's very

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.280 
well I think I mean overall she's very
solid<00:03:29.200> she<00:03:30.160> serves<00:03:30.460> well<00:03:30.730> she's<00:03:31.030> lefty<00:03:31.510> she's

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
solid she serves well she's lefty she's

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.280 
solid she serves well she's lefty she's
got<00:03:32.440> good<00:03:32.650> hands<00:03:32.980> good<00:03:33.010> volleys<00:03:33.520> but<00:03:34.210> it<00:03:34.630> makes

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
got good hands good volleys but it makes

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.410 
got good hands good volleys but it makes
one<00:03:36.010> thing<00:03:36.220> that<00:03:36.400> really<00:03:36.580> helps<00:03:36.940> us<00:03:37.090> it's

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
one thing that really helps us it's

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.750 
one thing that really helps us it's
because<00:03:37.630> she<00:03:37.900> returns<00:03:38.260> really<00:03:38.470> well<00:03:38.740> so<00:03:39.700> I

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
because she returns really well so I

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.220 
because she returns really well so I
think<00:03:39.850> we<00:03:40.270> managed<00:03:40.600> to<00:03:40.630> keep<00:03:40.960> putting

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
think we managed to keep putting

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.530 
think we managed to keep putting
pressure<00:03:41.430> even<00:03:42.430> when<00:03:42.580> the<00:03:42.730> guy<00:03:42.850> serving<00:03:43.360> and

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
pressure even when the guy serving and

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.390 
pressure even when the guy serving and
that's<00:03:44.350> very<00:03:44.590> important<00:03:44.980> it<00:03:45.100> makes<00:03:45.250> give<00:03:46.210> us

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
that's very important it makes give us

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.920 
that's very important it makes give us
little<00:03:49.650> men<00:03:50.650> give<00:03:51.580> us<00:03:51.730> more<00:03:52.060> room<00:03:52.120> to<00:03:52.510> work<00:03:52.750> on

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
little men give us more room to work on

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.810 
little men give us more room to work on
our<00:03:53.050> surf<00:03:53.350> because<00:03:53.710> we<00:03:54.010> don't<00:03:54.190> serve<00:03:54.400> that<00:03:54.610> big

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:54.820 
our surf because we don't serve that big

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.330 
our surf because we don't serve that big
I'm<00:03:55.060> not<00:03:55.270> a<00:03:55.300> huge<00:03:55.600> server<00:03:55.900> so<00:03:56.740> I<00:03:56.770> have<00:03:56.980> to<00:03:57.160> work

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
I'm not a huge server so I have to work

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.030 
I'm not a huge server so I have to work
a<00:03:57.490> lot<00:03:57.640> on<00:03:57.700> my<00:03:57.940> server<00:03:58.240> as<00:03:58.420> well<00:03:58.450> and

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
a lot on my server as well and

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:04.110 
a lot on my server as well and
calculator<00:04:00.040> so<00:04:00.370> if<00:04:02.100> when<00:04:03.100> we<00:04:03.280> return<00:04:03.610> good<00:04:03.910> I

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
calculator so if when we return good I

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.530 
calculator so if when we return good I
think<00:04:04.540> adds<00:04:04.810> a<00:04:05.200> lot<00:04:05.650> to<00:04:06.040> our<00:04:06.160> service<00:04:06.700> game<00:04:06.940> so

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
think adds a lot to our service game so

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.330 
think adds a lot to our service game so
that's<00:04:07.780> for<00:04:08.110> me<00:04:08.230> the<00:04:08.380> bad<00:04:08.560> thing<00:04:08.800> because<00:04:09.010> she

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
that's for me the bad thing because she

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.490 
that's for me the bad thing because she
keep<00:04:09.550> putting<00:04:09.850> pressure<00:04:10.090> I<00:04:10.450> move<00:04:11.020> over<00:04:11.200> the

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
keep putting pressure I move over the

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:18.300 
keep putting pressure I move over the
net<00:04:11.680> and<00:04:11.890> that<00:04:12.100> works<00:04:12.460> well<00:04:13.270> for<00:04:13.300> both<00:04:13.600> of<00:04:13.780> us

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310
