00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
creating this organization I am deciding

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.530 
creating this organization I am deciding
what<00:02:26.810> this<00:02:26.989> place<00:02:27.290> will<00:02:27.650> be<00:02:27.859> I<00:02:28.130> am<00:02:28.880> NOT<00:02:29.209> the

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
what this place will be I am NOT the

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.340 
what this place will be I am NOT the
effect<00:02:29.959> of<00:02:30.290> culture<00:02:31.120> I'm<00:02:32.120> just<00:02:32.510> wrong<00:02:32.870> but

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
effect of culture I'm just wrong but

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.849 
effect of culture I'm just wrong but
that's<00:02:34.010> not<00:02:34.310> its<00:02:34.850> explanation<00:02:35.510> for<00:02:36.079> Who<00:02:36.260> I<00:02:36.290> am

and so the leadership task is to say how

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.900 
and so the leadership task is to say how
do<00:02:40.730> we<00:02:40.850> get<00:02:41.200> create<00:02:42.200> lateral<00:02:42.890> leadership<00:02:43.700> how

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
do we get create lateral leadership how

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.960 
do we get create lateral leadership how
do<00:02:43.970> we<00:02:44.150> create<00:02:44.450> I<00:02:44.870> engaged<00:02:45.440> employees<00:02:46.340> where

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
do we create I engaged employees where

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.180 
do we create I engaged employees where
they<00:02:47.090> engage<00:02:47.510> with<00:02:47.870> each<00:02:48.410> other<00:02:48.709> on<00:02:49.040> the

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
they engage with each other on the

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.850 
they engage with each other on the
things<00:02:49.459> that<00:02:49.609> we

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
things that we

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.330 
things that we
used<00:02:49.980> to<00:02:50.130> think<00:02:50.280> bosses<00:02:50.820> were<00:02:51.030> caught
