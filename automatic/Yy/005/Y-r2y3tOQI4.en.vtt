corset dress at least on Maggie Sottero
they<00:00:16.770> almost<00:00:16.890> always<00:00:17.250> come<00:00:17.400> with<00:00:17.640> this<00:00:17.789> little

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
they almost always come with this little

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.779 
they almost always come with this little
clear<00:00:18.180> snap<00:00:18.830> the<00:00:19.830> likelihood<00:00:20.310> is<00:00:20.430> that<00:00:20.640> when

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
clear snap the likelihood is that when

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.730 
clear snap the likelihood is that when
you<00:00:20.880> tighten<00:00:21.090> it<00:00:21.300> that's<00:00:21.810> gonna<00:00:22.170> get<00:00:22.380> on<00:00:22.439> snap

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
you tighten it that's gonna get on snap

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.650 
you tighten it that's gonna get on snap
but<00:00:22.980> for<00:00:23.189> to<00:00:23.400> right<00:00:23.850> now<00:00:24.000> it's<00:00:24.180> just<00:00:24.300> to<00:00:24.510> hold

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
but for to right now it's just to hold

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.050 
but for to right now it's just to hold
it<00:00:24.779> on<00:00:25.130> you<00:00:26.130> always<00:00:26.340> start<00:00:26.519> with<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.699> very<00:00:26.849> top

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
it on you always start with the very top

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.950 
it on you always start with the very top
loop<00:00:27.529> the<00:00:28.529> top<00:00:28.710> set<00:00:28.980> of<00:00:29.070> loops<00:00:29.250> anyway<00:00:29.670> and<00:00:30.300> you

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
loop the top set of loops anyway and you

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.540 
loop the top set of loops anyway and you
always<00:00:31.170> want<00:00:31.410> to<00:00:31.470> pull<00:00:31.650> your<00:00:31.769> strings<00:00:32.099> towards

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
always want to pull your strings towards

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:33.889 
always want to pull your strings towards
you<00:00:32.669> it<00:00:32.910> looks<00:00:33.180> neater

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
you it looks neater

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.959 
you it looks neater
it's<00:00:34.170> easier<00:00:34.559> to<00:00:34.680> tighten<00:00:34.890> it's<00:00:35.399> just<00:00:35.880> a

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
it's easier to tighten it's just a

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.610 
it's easier to tighten it's just a
better<00:00:36.120> way<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.329> do<00:00:36.570> it<00:00:36.690> you<00:00:37.260> want<00:00:37.440> to<00:00:37.500> make

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
better way to do it you want to make

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.069 
better way to do it you want to make
sure<00:00:37.649> that<00:00:37.920> your<00:00:38.070> strings<00:00:38.430> are<00:00:39.079> approximately

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
sure that your strings are approximately

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.810 
sure that your strings are approximately
the<00:00:40.260> same<00:00:40.500> length<00:00:40.770> because<00:00:41.129> otherwise<00:00:41.370> if<00:00:41.670> you

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
the same length because otherwise if you

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.660 
the same length because otherwise if you
run<00:00:42.059> out<00:00:42.180> of<00:00:42.210> what<00:00:42.510> at<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.690> bottom<00:00:42.960> then<00:00:43.170> you

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
run out of what at the bottom then you

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.450 
run out of what at the bottom then you
won't<00:00:44.670> be<00:00:44.730> able<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:44.879> tighten<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.180> whole<00:00:45.270> thing

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
won't be able to tighten the whole thing

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.500 
won't be able to tighten the whole thing
whatever<00:00:47.460> side<00:00:47.760> you<00:00:47.879> start<00:00:48.120> on<00:00:48.239> you<00:00:48.360> always

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
whatever side you start on you always

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.540 
whatever side you start on you always
want<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.750> start<00:00:48.989> on<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.170> same<00:00:49.350> side<00:00:49.649> I<00:00:49.920> am

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
want to start on the same side I am

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.889 
want to start on the same side I am
right-handed<00:00:50.789> so<00:00:51.270> I<00:00:51.300> always<00:00:51.480> start<00:00:51.719> on<00:00:51.809> the

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
right-handed so I always start on the

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.930 
right-handed so I always start on the
right<00:00:52.050> side<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.559> you<00:00:52.590> take<00:00:53.280> each<00:00:53.460> set<00:00:53.850> of

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
right side and you take each set of

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.990 
right side and you take each set of
loops<00:00:54.149> individually<00:00:55.140> so<00:00:56.010> you<00:00:56.070> do<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.789> right

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
loops individually so you do the right

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.910 
loops individually so you do the right
side<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.600> try<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:57.930> make<00:00:58.109> sure<00:00:58.260> that<00:00:58.410> it's<00:00:58.590> flat

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
side and try to make sure that it's flat

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.500 
side and try to make sure that it's flat
as<00:00:59.129> you<00:00:59.280> go<00:00:59.489> so<00:00:59.760> you're<00:00:59.850> feeding<00:01:00.059> in<00:01:00.270> from

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
as you go so you're feeding in from

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.410 
as you go so you're feeding in from
underneath<00:01:00.840> yes<00:01:01.730> so<00:01:02.730> you<00:01:02.789> want<00:01:03.059> to<00:01:03.180> always

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
underneath yes so you want to always

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.929 
underneath yes so you want to always
pull<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.290> string<00:01:04.589> towards<00:01:05.250> you<00:01:05.369> so<00:01:05.640> you<00:01:05.700> want

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
pull the string towards you so you want

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:11.719 
pull the string towards you so you want
to<00:01:06.000> go<00:01:06.119> in<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.900> pull<00:01:07.350> towards<00:01:08.280> you<00:01:09.380> and<00:01:10.729> then

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
to go in and pull towards you and then

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.270 
to go in and pull towards you and then
you<00:01:11.850> do<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.330> right<00:01:12.479> side<00:01:12.659> again<00:01:12.689> obviously<00:01:13.500> so

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
you do the right side again obviously so

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.760 
you do the right side again obviously so
you<00:01:14.310> do<00:01:14.580> right<00:01:14.820> side<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:15.330> again<00:01:15.840> untwist<00:01:16.590> it

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
you do right side and again untwist it

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:23.330 
you do right side and again untwist it
as<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:17.159> go<00:01:20.360> and<00:01:21.360> it's<00:01:22.170> usually<00:01:22.380> easier<00:01:23.040> to

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
as you go and it's usually easier to

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.940 
as you go and it's usually easier to
lace<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.330> entire<00:01:24.720> dress<00:01:25.140> up<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.530> then

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
lace the entire dress up and then

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.219 
lace the entire dress up and then
tighten<00:01:26.939> it<00:01:27.000> rather<00:01:27.270> than<00:01:27.540> trying<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:27.840> tighten

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
tighten it rather than trying to tighten

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.749 
tighten it rather than trying to tighten
it<00:01:28.320> halfway<00:01:28.530> through<00:01:28.710> otherwise<00:01:29.250> it<00:01:29.460> doesn't

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
it halfway through otherwise it doesn't

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.550 
it halfway through otherwise it doesn't
doesn't<00:01:30.420> hold<00:01:30.780> as<00:01:31.049> well<00:01:31.229> as<00:01:31.409> that<00:01:31.650> should<00:01:33.560> so

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
doesn't hold as well as that should so

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.530 
doesn't hold as well as that should so
you<00:01:34.619> do<00:01:34.829> every<00:01:35.189> other<00:01:35.220> one<00:01:35.549> instead<00:01:36.119> of<00:01:36.240> trying

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
you do every other one instead of trying

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.580 
you do every other one instead of trying
to<00:01:36.600> do<00:01:37.159> one<00:01:38.840> going<00:01:39.840> all<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.020> way<00:01:40.079> down<00:01:40.140> and

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
to do one going all the way down and

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.260 
to do one going all the way down and
then<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.799> other<00:01:40.829> all<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.280> way<00:01:41.310> down<00:01:41.579> yes<00:01:42.000> you

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
then the other all the way down yes you

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.810 
then the other all the way down yes you
do<00:01:42.420> each<00:01:42.659> set<00:01:43.049> of<00:01:43.079> loops<00:01:43.350> at<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:43.829> time<00:01:44.369> so<00:01:44.670> rather

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
do each set of loops at a time so rather

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.880 
do each set of loops at a time so rather
than<00:01:45.030> taking<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.509> right<00:01:45.659> string<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:46.079> feeding

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
than taking the right string and feeding

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.310 
than taking the right string and feeding
it<00:01:47.159> all<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.880> way<00:01:48.000> down

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
it all the way down

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.950 
it all the way down
you<00:01:50.070> do<00:01:50.310> one<00:01:50.729> set<00:01:51.060> at<00:01:51.180> a<00:01:51.299> time<00:01:51.509> so<00:01:51.720> you're<00:01:51.840> going

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
you do one set at a time so you're going

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.929 
you do one set at a time so you're going
to<00:01:52.020> do<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.320> right<00:01:52.439> side<00:01:52.770> and<00:01:53.070> then<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.729> left

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
to do the right side and then the left

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.429 
to do the right side and then the left
side<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:54.360> then<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.659> right<00:01:54.689> side<00:01:55.049> on<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.259> left

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
side and then the right side on the left

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.170 
side and then the right side on the left
side<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:56.219> reason<00:01:56.490> you<00:01:56.579> do<00:01:56.759> that<00:01:56.790> is

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
side and the reason you do that is

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.530 
side and the reason you do that is
because<00:01:57.509> you<00:01:58.140> get<00:01:58.560> this<00:01:58.740> really<00:01:59.040> beautiful

because you get this really beautiful
herringbone<00:02:00.540> pattern<00:02:00.990> where<00:02:02.180> the<00:02:03.180> first<00:02:03.780> side

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
herringbone pattern where the first side

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.139 
herringbone pattern where the first side
is<00:02:03.990> always<00:02:04.439> underneath<00:02:04.710> and<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.250> second<00:02:06.030> side

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
is always underneath and the second side

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.330 
is always underneath and the second side
is<00:02:06.270> always<00:02:06.540> on<00:02:06.689> top<00:02:06.930> so<00:02:07.229> it<00:02:07.500> looks<00:02:07.829> like<00:02:08.069> this

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
is always on top so it looks like this

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.910 
is always on top so it looks like this
instead<00:02:08.879> of<00:02:08.970> being<00:02:09.209> conjoined<00:02:09.840> in<00:02:10.110> all<00:02:10.259> kinds

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
very bottom part well first it depends

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.350 
very bottom part well first it depends
on<00:03:15.140> on<00:03:15.440> how<00:03:15.650> thick<00:03:16.099> your<00:03:16.250> string<00:03:16.550> is<00:03:16.580> usually

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
on on how thick your string is usually

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.820 
on on how thick your string is usually
with<00:03:17.480> the<00:03:17.569> thicker<00:03:17.780> string<00:03:18.170> a<00:03:18.349> lot<00:03:18.530> of<00:03:18.650> times

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 
with the thicker string a lot of times

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:20.320 
with the thicker string a lot of times
you<00:03:18.950> have<00:03:19.069> to<00:03:19.130> skip<00:03:19.459> the<00:03:19.489> bottom<00:03:19.880> loop<00:03:20.030> in

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
you have to skip the bottom loop in

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.120 
you have to skip the bottom loop in
order<00:03:20.690> to<00:03:20.840> be<00:03:21.020> able<00:03:21.200> to<00:03:21.260> pull<00:03:21.470> it<00:03:21.590> through<00:03:21.860> if

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
order to be able to pull it through if

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.309 
order to be able to pull it through if
you're<00:03:22.700> using<00:03:22.940> a<00:03:23.330> thinner<00:03:23.870> string<00:03:24.349> like<00:03:25.130> this

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:26.319 
you're using a thinner string like this

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:29.259 
you're using a thinner string like this
one<00:03:27.319> you<00:03:28.069> can<00:03:28.310> go<00:03:28.640> all<00:03:28.790> the<00:03:28.880> way<00:03:28.910> to<00:03:29.000> the<00:03:29.150> bottom

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
one you can go all the way to the bottom

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:30.339 
one you can go all the way to the bottom
because<00:03:29.540> you<00:03:29.569> don't<00:03:29.780> have<00:03:29.870> as<00:03:29.959> much<00:03:30.080> space

00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:30.349 
because you don't have as much space

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:31.570 
because you don't have as much space
this<00:03:30.590> has<00:03:30.769> a<00:03:30.800> tendency<00:03:31.130> to<00:03:31.220> take<00:03:31.310> up<00:03:31.459> a<00:03:31.489> little

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.580 
this has a tendency to take up a little

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.270 
this has a tendency to take up a little
bit<00:03:31.760> more<00:03:31.880> space<00:03:32.349> so<00:03:33.349> down<00:03:33.860> here<00:03:34.099> at<00:03:34.190> the

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
bit more space so down here at the

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.890 
bit more space so down here at the
bottom<00:03:34.610> before<00:03:35.030> we<00:03:35.150> actually<00:03:35.330> finish<00:03:35.780> this

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
bottom before we actually finish this

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.270 
bottom before we actually finish this
off<00:03:36.080> we're<00:03:36.290> going<00:03:36.380> to<00:03:36.470> go<00:03:36.920> through<00:03:37.160> and

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
off we're going to go through and

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.920 
off we're going to go through and
tighten<00:03:37.640> the<00:03:37.700> whole<00:03:37.849> corset<00:03:38.269> so<00:03:38.480> it's<00:03:38.630> on<00:03:38.780> her

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
tighten the whole corset so it's on her

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:40.660 
tighten the whole corset so it's on her
and<00:03:39.080> it's<00:03:39.200> going<00:03:39.319> to<00:03:39.410> stay<00:03:39.680> you<00:03:40.310> always<00:03:40.489> start

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
and it's going to stay you always start

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:42.699 
and it's going to stay you always start
with<00:03:40.790> your<00:03:40.849> top<00:03:41.150> two<00:03:41.420> and<00:03:41.720> this<00:03:42.290> is<00:03:42.470> when<00:03:42.620> you

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
with your top two and this is when you

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:44.699 
with your top two and this is when you
can<00:03:42.890> unsnap<00:03:43.250> that<00:03:43.580> if<00:03:43.730> you<00:03:43.880> need<00:03:44.060> to<00:03:44.269> and<00:03:44.540> then

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
can unsnap that if you need to and then

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:47.050 
can unsnap that if you need to and then
you<00:03:45.709> pull<00:03:46.010> towards<00:03:46.819> you

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
you pull towards you

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.449 
you pull towards you
so<00:03:47.390> it's<00:03:47.630> you<00:03:47.959> stick<00:03:48.260> your<00:03:48.410> fingers<00:03:48.709> from

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
so it's you stick your fingers from

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:50.979 
so it's you stick your fingers from
underneath<00:03:49.730> and<00:03:50.030> you<00:03:50.120> just<00:03:50.299> pull<00:03:50.510> it<00:03:50.630> towards

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:50.989 
underneath and you just pull it towards

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:56.309 
underneath and you just pull it towards
you<00:03:51.140> and<00:03:51.319> you<00:03:51.950> tighten<00:03:52.250> all<00:03:52.640> the<00:03:53.060> way<00:03:54.370> down

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:56.319 
you and you tighten all the way down

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:59.620 
you and you tighten all the way down
again<00:03:57.319> keeping<00:03:58.010> your<00:03:58.069> laces<00:03:58.880> flat<00:03:59.209> and<00:03:59.450> this

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 
again keeping your laces flat and this

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.780 
again keeping your laces flat and this
is<00:03:59.780> where<00:03:59.989> it's<00:04:00.140> going<00:04:00.260> to<00:04:00.319> help<00:04:00.500> having<00:04:01.370> kept

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
is where it's going to help having kept

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.030 
is where it's going to help having kept
them<00:04:02.000> straight<00:04:02.390> and<00:04:02.420> flat<00:04:02.900> at<00:04:03.230> the<00:04:03.500> beginning

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
them straight and flat at the beginning

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.559 
them straight and flat at the beginning
and<00:04:04.430> doing<00:04:04.670> it<00:04:04.760> neatly<00:04:05.000> at<00:04:05.180> the<00:04:05.239> beginning

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:05.569 
and doing it neatly at the beginning

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:07.270 
and doing it neatly at the beginning
because<00:04:05.810> that<00:04:06.110> means<00:04:06.260> that<00:04:06.440> you<00:04:07.040> don't<00:04:07.190> have

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
because that means that you don't have

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.479 
because that means that you don't have

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:30.650 
prefer to tuck it in so that it looks a

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:31.869 
prefer to tuck it in so that it looks a
little<00:05:30.770> bit<00:05:31.009> neater<00:05:31.189> it<00:05:31.400> looks<00:05:31.580> a<00:05:31.639> little<00:05:31.699> bit
