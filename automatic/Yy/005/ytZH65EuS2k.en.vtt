 very good everyone welcome another day more 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.509
 to the broken review channel in this video 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.429
 will teach how to install whatsapp both in 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.830
 your computer with your tablet 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.330
 a very simple process the only 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.889
 requirement that is the only thing you need 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.599
 In order to do this properly because 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.680
 ok the computer where we're going to want 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.210
 do this simply also what 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.400
 we can make a tablet worth the process 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.160
 it's going to be the same and also a mobile 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.230
 where we already have whatsapp installed if 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.090
 by some chance because I did not have 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.830
 whatsapp on the mobile either because I 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.840
 that are noticed immobile or why not 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.640
 it works and you want to install whatsapp from 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.170
 computer or on a tablet for sure 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.000
 I will leave a method below in the 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.530
 description is valid so you can do 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.480
 this without the need to have whatsapp 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.920
 installed on our mobile but good 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.329
 as I say this is going to be the most 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.550
 simple and faster to have 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.380
 whatsapp on these devices so good 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.450
 I rolled it over and we're going to start 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.800
 so let's go to the link that we're going to 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.960
 have below in the description and we will 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.460
 take to a page like this as you see 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.960
 you are going to have a code that you are going to 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.060
 have to scan from your mobile 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.500
 increased this page only works with the 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.480
 google chrome browser so you os 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.890
 I recommend that you will have it with this one 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.420
 Once, as I said , we have that 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.040
 open page let's go to our 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.290
 mobile let's open whatsapp and in 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.640
 adjustments let's give whatsapp web if 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.050
 you do not find that option then nothing 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.790
 we will simply have to update the 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.210
 whatsapp from the back to the last 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.650
 version 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.600
 so once we've found 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.220
 already the whatsapp web mode in our 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.409
 mobile in the option because it will come out 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.119
 the camera we just have to pass 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:25.369
 the camera above the code that 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:27.080
 we have in our computer and 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:29.509
 it is automatically a very fast process 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.550
 because of our mobile because it is back to 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:33.619
 the messages and on another computer well yes 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.390
 start loading what would be the version 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:36.770
 whatsapp website so I already know that 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.030
 totally this automatic no longer 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.130
 we will have to do anything we already have 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.450
 our mobile well coordinated with 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.820
 our computer and we can send 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.560
 from our computer messages and 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.630
 receive them there can send photos 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.340
 messages and it will be all synchronized in 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.990
 our mobile with our computer like this 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.610
 that the messages we receive in a 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.320
 we will also receive them in the 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.210
 another and the truth that guys this does not 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.679
 would be more simply as you see is the 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.450
 same whatsapp that we have in our 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:00.830
 mobile but our computer with which 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.000
 it makes a more comfortable method 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.979
 probably to use also a 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.330
 office or anywhere else and 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.280
 besides this process can also be 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.840
 do on the tablet and it would be very 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.000
 simple simply our tablet 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.100
 we would go to whatsapp web to the version that 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.140
 you are going to have down in the link 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.790
 with our mobile because we would scan it 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.000
 the code and we'll have whatsapp in 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.260
 our tablet so easy 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.820
 so, well, guys, I hope that I have 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.310
