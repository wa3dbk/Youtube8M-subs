now<00:00:46.469> again<00:00:46.829> this<00:00:47.100> could<00:00:47.489> all<00:00:47.760> mean<00:00:48.059> that

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
now again this could all mean that

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.029 
now again this could all mean that
Nintendo<00:00:48.750> is<00:00:48.899> creating<00:00:49.320> a<00:00:49.410> console<00:00:49.860> that's

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
Nintendo is creating a console that's

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.590 
Nintendo is creating a console that's
solely<00:00:50.370> going<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:50.760> rely<00:00:51.030> on<00:00:51.059> digital

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
solely going to rely on digital

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.060 
solely going to rely on digital
distribution<00:00:51.899> for<00:00:52.469> people<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:52.890> purchase

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
distribution for people to purchase

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.670 
distribution for people to purchase
games<00:00:53.489> from<00:00:53.789> but<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.329> system<00:00:54.780> does<00:00:55.020> say<00:00:55.379> that

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
games from but the system does say that

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.779 
games from but the system does say that
the<00:00:55.800> console<00:00:56.250> is<00:00:56.370> going<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.610> have<00:00:56.760> a

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
the console is going to have a

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.090 
the console is going to have a
read-write<00:00:57.510> card<00:00:57.930> slot<00:00:58.289> like<00:00:58.530> an<00:00:58.680> SD<00:00:59.070> card

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
read-write card slot like an SD card

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.090 
read-write card slot like an SD card
slot<00:00:59.730> so<00:01:00.030> could<00:01:00.270> this<00:01:00.449> possibly<00:01:00.780> be<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.469> patent

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
slot so could this possibly be a patent

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.729 
slot so could this possibly be a patent

next-gen<00:01:05.309> console<00:01:05.820> I<00:01:06.000> guess<00:01:06.930> so<00:01:07.200> is<00:01:07.470> it<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:08.040> good

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
next-gen console I guess so is it a good

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.190 
next-gen console I guess so is it a good
idea<00:01:08.340> for<00:01:08.939> them<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.210> go<00:01:09.360> totally<00:01:09.930> digital

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
idea for them to go totally digital

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.429 
idea for them to go totally digital
distribution<00:01:10.710> I<00:01:11.540> don't<00:01:12.540> think<00:01:12.869> so<00:01:13.110> anymore

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
distribution I don't think so anymore

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.030 
distribution I don't think so anymore
man<00:01:13.890> I<00:01:14.159> mean<00:01:14.850> look<00:01:15.119> how<00:01:15.420> good<00:01:15.840> physical<00:01:16.590> copies

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
man I mean look how good physical copies

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.190 
man I mean look how good physical copies
of<00:01:17.070> games<00:01:17.430> are<00:01:17.759> still<00:01:18.000> doing<00:01:18.270> yes<00:01:18.750> they're<00:01:19.049> in

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
of games are still doing yes they're in

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.620 
of games are still doing yes they're in
a<00:01:19.320> slight<00:01:19.890> decline<00:01:20.490> I've<00:01:20.850> talked<00:01:21.119> about<00:01:21.420> this

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
a slight decline I've talked about this

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.710 
a slight decline I've talked about this
in<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:22.320> video<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.680> while<00:01:22.979> back<00:01:23.040> but<00:01:23.580> people<00:01:24.420> still

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
in a video a while back but people still

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.170 
in a video a while back but people still
love<00:01:25.080> going<00:01:25.380> getting<00:01:25.710> their<00:01:25.950> games<00:01:26.250> man<00:01:26.610> they

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
love going getting their games man they

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.969 
love going getting their games man they
love<00:01:27.479> when<00:01:27.659> new<00:01:27.689> games<00:01:28.140> come<00:01:28.439> out<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:28.710> going

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
love when new games come out and going

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.469 
love when new games come out and going
and<00:01:29.130> picking<00:01:29.280> up<00:01:29.549> that<00:01:29.729> physical<00:01:30.240> copy

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
and picking up that physical copy

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.480 
and picking up that physical copy
because<00:01:30.810> they<00:01:31.110> could<00:01:31.259> trade<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.740> games<00:01:31.950> they

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
because they could trade the games they

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.399 
because they could trade the games they
could<00:01:32.670> sell<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.270> games<00:01:33.450> they<00:01:33.810> could<00:01:33.990> collect

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
the games people like having when they

the games people like having when they
put<00:01:38.189> money<00:01:38.549> out<00:01:38.670> there<00:01:39.119> they<00:01:39.600> like<00:01:39.930> receiving

put money out there they like receiving

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.700

something<00:01:41.369> physically<00:01:42.180> you<00:01:42.780> know<00:01:42.899> and<00:01:43.170> it's

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
something physically you know and it's

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.580 
something physically you know and it's
just<00:01:43.829> digital<00:01:44.549> distribution<00:01:44.880> is<00:01:45.479> not<00:01:46.320> going

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
just digital distribution is not going

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.859 
just digital distribution is not going
to<00:01:46.649> take<00:01:46.920> over<00:01:47.130> as<00:01:47.549> fast<00:01:47.880> as<00:01:48.240> I<00:01:48.299> originally

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
to take over as fast as I originally

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.260 
to take over as fast as I originally
thought<00:01:49.170> it<00:01:49.560> was<00:01:49.710> going<00:01:50.070> to<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:50.579> I<00:01:50.820> think<00:01:51.090> also

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
thought it was going to and I think also

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.460 
thought it was going to and I think also
that<00:01:51.390> has<00:01:51.630> something<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:51.960> do<00:01:52.110> with<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.439> fact

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
that has something to do with the fact

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.649 
that has something to do with the fact
that<00:01:52.799> Microsoft<00:01:53.430> kind<00:01:53.700> of<00:01:53.820> gave<00:01:54.000> in<00:01:54.180> to<00:01:54.329> people

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
that Microsoft kind of gave in to people

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.459 
that Microsoft kind of gave in to people
and<00:01:54.869> didn't<00:01:55.649> make<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.490> xbox<00:01:57.060> one<00:01:57.329> as<00:01:57.600> much

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
and didn't make the xbox one as much

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.139 
and didn't make the xbox one as much
about<00:01:58.770> digital<00:01:59.189> distribution<00:01:59.549> as<00:01:59.969> they<00:02:00.090> were

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
about digital distribution as they were

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.639 
about digital distribution as they were
originally<00:02:00.689> going<00:02:00.869> to<00:02:00.990> do<00:02:01.200> so<00:02:01.439> if<00:02:01.500> you

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
originally going to do so if you

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.950 
originally going to do so if you
remember<00:02:02.210> Microsoft's<00:02:03.210> game<00:02:03.390> plan<00:02:03.689> for<00:02:03.869> the

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
remember Microsoft's game plan for the

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.020 
remember Microsoft's game plan for the
Xbox<00:02:04.409> one<00:02:04.649> was<00:02:04.829> much<00:02:05.250> different<00:02:05.549> when<00:02:05.880> they

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
Xbox one was much different when they

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.330 
Xbox one was much different when they
announced<00:02:06.509> it<00:02:06.600> than<00:02:07.140> what<00:02:07.380> it<00:02:07.500> is<00:02:07.530> now<00:02:07.649> so

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
announced it than what it is now so

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.309 
announced it than what it is now so
wouldn't<00:02:08.729> that<00:02:08.789> be<00:02:09.060> some<00:02:09.420> shit<00:02:09.720> with<00:02:09.989> all<00:02:10.200> the

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
wouldn't that be some shit with all the

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.839 
wouldn't that be some shit with all the
stuff<00:02:10.560> we<00:02:10.679> heard<00:02:10.830> back<00:02:11.039> in<00:02:11.099> the<00:02:11.280> day<00:02:11.370> coming

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
stuff we heard back in the day coming

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.180 
stuff we heard back in the day coming
from<00:02:11.970> Sony's<00:02:12.390> camp<00:02:12.660> about<00:02:12.900> that

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
from Sony's camp about that

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.940 
from Sony's camp about that
distribution<00:02:13.910> and<00:02:14.140> Microsoft's<00:02:15.140> camp<00:02:15.410> that

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
distribution and Microsoft's camp that

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.510 
distribution and Microsoft's camp that
Nintendo<00:02:16.940> is<00:02:17.240> the<00:02:17.900> first<00:02:18.230> to<00:02:18.530> drop<00:02:18.710> a<00:02:18.830> console

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
Nintendo is the first to drop a console

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.490 
Nintendo is the first to drop a console
that<00:02:19.670> solely<00:02:20.120> relies<00:02:20.750> on<00:02:20.780> digital

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
that solely relies on digital

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.920 
that solely relies on digital
distribution<00:02:21.880> allowing<00:02:22.880> you<00:02:23.090> only<00:02:23.390> to<00:02:23.780> get

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
distribution allowing you only to get

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.190 
distribution allowing you only to get
your<00:02:24.170> games<00:02:24.440> via<00:02:24.980> download<00:02:25.640> that<00:02:26.450> my<00:02:26.810> head<00:02:27.050> is

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
your games via download that my head is

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.760 
your games via download that my head is
like<00:02:27.230> exploding<00:02:28.130> right<00:02:28.280> now<00:02:28.340> it's<00:02:28.640> like<00:02:28.750> cool

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
like exploding right now it's like cool

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.710 
like exploding right now it's like cool
just<00:02:30.770> thinking<00:02:31.220> about<00:02:31.340> that<00:02:31.730> Nintendo<00:02:32.420> being

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
just thinking about that Nintendo being

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.810 
just thinking about that Nintendo being
the<00:02:32.870> first<00:02:33.230> of<00:02:33.500> the<00:02:33.590> gate<00:02:33.800> with<00:02:34.370> a<00:02:34.400> digital

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
the first of the gate with a digital

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.600 
the first of the gate with a digital
distribution<00:02:35.390> only<00:02:36.200> console<00:02:36.770> imagine<00:02:37.400> that

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
distribution only console imagine that

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.750 
distribution only console imagine that
again<00:02:38.150> this<00:02:38.570> is<00:02:38.930> just<00:02:39.410> a<00:02:39.680> schematic<00:02:40.340> and<00:02:40.580> this

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
again this is just a schematic and this

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.840 
again this is just a schematic and this
is<00:02:40.940> just<00:02:41.240> a<00:02:41.570> patent<00:02:41.990> and<00:02:42.370> companies<00:02:43.370> patent

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
is just a patent and companies patent

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.460 
is just a patent and companies patent
shit<00:02:44.060> all<00:02:44.210> the<00:02:44.330> time<00:02:44.360> and<00:02:44.780> nothing<00:02:45.110> ever<00:02:45.230> comes

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
shit all the time and nothing ever comes

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.680 
shit all the time and nothing ever comes
to<00:02:45.710> fruition<00:02:45.920> so<00:02:46.400> this<00:02:46.850> may<00:02:47.030> be<00:02:47.090> for<00:02:47.450> something

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
to fruition so this may be for something

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.590 
to fruition so this may be for something
we'll<00:02:48.020> never<00:02:48.320> see<00:02:48.830> but<00:02:49.520> if<00:02:49.640> this<00:02:49.820> is<00:02:49.880> code

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
we'll never see but if this is code

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.750 
we'll never see but if this is code
named<00:02:50.840> NX<00:02:51.260> and<00:02:51.560> it's<00:02:51.950> going<00:02:52.130> to<00:02:52.190> be<00:02:52.340> digital

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
named NX and it's going to be digital

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.480 
named NX and it's going to be digital
distribution<00:02:53.030> only<00:02:53.660> that<00:02:54.410> is<00:02:54.710> some<00:02:55.010> crazy

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490 
distribution only that is some crazy

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.150 
distribution only that is some crazy
shit<00:02:55.760> man<00:02:56.360> Nintendo<00:02:56.930> the<00:02:57.110> first<00:02:57.500> out<00:02:57.800> of<00:02:57.860> the

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
shit man Nintendo the first out of the

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.430 
shit man Nintendo the first out of the
gate<00:02:58.190> with<00:02:59.000> a<00:02:59.030> console<00:02:59.600> without<00:02:59.690> an<00:03:00.020> optical

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
gate with a console without an optical

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.040 
gate with a console without an optical
drive<00:03:00.470> hmm<00:03:01.370> or<00:03:01.520> and<00:03:02.150> I'll<00:03:02.270> be<00:03:02.450> the<00:03:02.570> first<00:03:02.600> to

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
drive hmm or and I'll be the first to

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.290 
drive hmm or and I'll be the first to
admit<00:03:03.200> this<00:03:03.950> is<00:03:04.010> a<00:03:04.190> wild<00:03:04.640> card<00:03:04.880> that<00:03:05.180> I'm

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
admit this is a wild card that I'm

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.990 
admit this is a wild card that I'm
totally<00:03:05.600> pulling<00:03:06.080> out<00:03:06.350> of<00:03:06.380> my<00:03:06.530> ass<00:03:06.800> maybe<00:03:07.730> we

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
totally pulling out of my ass maybe we

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.170 
totally pulling out of my ass maybe we
will<00:03:08.180> still<00:03:08.600> and<00:03:08.960> say<00:03:09.170> this<00:03:09.350> whole<00:03:10.010> patent<00:03:11.000> in

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
will still and say this whole patent in

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.690 
will still and say this whole patent in
this<00:03:11.360> whole<00:03:11.660> schematic<00:03:11.960> is<00:03:12.470> actually<00:03:13.430> for

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
this whole schematic is actually for

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.030 
this whole schematic is actually for
codename<00:03:14.120> NX<00:03:14.540> and<00:03:14.840> it<00:03:15.410> doesn't<00:03:15.710> have<00:03:15.860> an

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
codename NX and it doesn't have an

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.040 
codename NX and it doesn't have an
optical<00:03:16.220> drive<00:03:16.520> but<00:03:16.940> it<00:03:17.030> does<00:03:17.180> have<00:03:17.420> a<00:03:17.450> card

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
optical drive but it does have a card

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.680 
optical drive but it does have a card
slot<00:03:18.410> in<00:03:18.590> it<00:03:18.709> maybe<00:03:19.550> we<00:03:19.820> will<00:03:20.030> get<00:03:20.180> physical

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
slot in it maybe we will get physical

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.870 
slot in it maybe we will get physical
copies<00:03:21.050> of<00:03:21.080> games<00:03:21.350> for<00:03:21.620> the<00:03:21.709> NX<00:03:22.070> they'll<00:03:22.670> just

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
copies of games for the NX they'll just

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.050 
copies of games for the NX they'll just
come<00:03:23.120> on<00:03:23.390> 128<00:03:24.230> gigabyte<00:03:24.770> SD<00:03:24.980> cards<00:03:25.459> it's

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
come on 128 gigabyte SD cards it's

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.680 
come on 128 gigabyte SD cards it's
plenty<00:03:26.450> of<00:03:26.570> space<00:03:26.840> for<00:03:26.870> a<00:03:27.200> next-gen<00:03:27.770> game<00:03:28.010> and

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
plenty of space for a next-gen game and

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.570 
plenty of space for a next-gen game and
SD<00:03:29.690> cards<00:03:30.110> definitely<00:03:30.560> are<00:03:30.680> fast<00:03:30.980> enough<00:03:31.370> now

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.580 
SD cards definitely are fast enough now

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.600 
SD cards definitely are fast enough now
and<00:03:31.850> like<00:03:32.420> I<00:03:32.540> said<00:03:32.600> 128<00:03:33.560> gigabytes<00:03:34.010> is<00:03:34.190> plenty

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610 
and like I said 128 gigabytes is plenty

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.960 
and like I said 128 gigabytes is plenty
of<00:03:34.640> storage<00:03:34.970> I<00:03:35.360> know<00:03:36.170> it's<00:03:37.010> a<00:03:37.190> stretch<00:03:37.250> and

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
of storage I know it's a stretch and

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.110 
of storage I know it's a stretch and
more<00:03:38.480> than<00:03:38.750> likely<00:03:39.020> that's<00:03:39.380> not<00:03:39.830> the<00:03:40.070> case<00:03:40.280> but

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
more than likely that's not the case but

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.990 
more than likely that's not the case but
it's<00:03:41.270> not<00:03:41.360> totally<00:03:42.050> out<00:03:42.080> of<00:03:42.200> the<00:03:42.350> question

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
it's not totally out of the question

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.310 
it's not totally out of the question
