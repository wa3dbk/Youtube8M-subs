today<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:55.050> that<00:00:55.949> is<00:00:55.980> what<00:00:56.399> we<00:00:56.430> were<00:00:56.640> going<00:00:56.760> to

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
today and that is what we were going to

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.279 
today and that is what we were going to
demonstrate<00:00:57.059> here<00:00:57.510> for<00:00:57.750> you<00:00:57.809> today<00:00:57.989> how

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
demonstrate here for you today how

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.069 
demonstrate here for you today how
easily<00:00:58.859> this<00:00:59.309> plow<00:00:59.879> goes<00:01:00.300> on<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:00.809> off<00:01:00.930> the

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
easily this plow goes on and off the

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.950 
easily this plow goes on and off the
truck<00:01:01.910> so<00:01:02.910> this<00:01:03.059> is<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.210> plow<00:01:03.390> we<00:01:03.449> installed

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
truck so this is a plow we installed

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.340 
truck so this is a plow we installed
today<00:01:04.110> on<00:01:04.320> this<00:01:04.439> vehicle<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:05.900> with<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.229> way

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
today on this vehicle and with the way

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.780 
today on this vehicle and with the way
it<00:01:07.470> sits<00:01:07.680> right<00:01:07.799> now<00:01:08.100> is<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.400> way<00:01:08.549> you<00:01:08.610> can

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
it sits right now is the way you can

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.820 
it sits right now is the way you can
store<00:01:09.090> it<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:09.780> we're<00:01:10.170> going<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.320> come<00:01:10.530> pulling

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
store it and we're going to come pulling

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:11.810 
store it and we're going to come pulling
up<00:01:10.920> with<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.130> truck<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.520> we're<00:01:11.640> going<00:01:11.790> to

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
up with the truck and we're going to

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:18.429 
up with the truck and we're going to
hook<00:01:11.909> it<00:01:12.060> up<00:01:12.150> and<00:01:12.270> show<00:01:12.450> you<00:01:12.510> how<00:01:12.600> that<00:01:12.659> works

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:18.439 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:21.830 

okay<00:01:19.439> once<00:01:19.710> we<00:01:19.799> pull<00:01:20.070> in<00:01:20.360> we've<00:01:21.360> got<00:01:21.570> two

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
okay once we pull in we've got two

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.179 
okay once we pull in we've got two
levers<00:01:22.200> that<00:01:22.229> we're<00:01:22.500> going<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.650> pull<00:01:22.920> one<00:01:23.130> on

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
levers that we're going to pull one on

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.749 
levers that we're going to pull one on
each<00:01:23.400> side<00:01:23.430> we've<00:01:23.939> got<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.950> pin<00:01:25.950> that<00:01:26.610> would

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
each side we've got a pin that would

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.850 
each side we've got a pin that would
pull<00:01:26.909> out<00:01:26.939> on<00:01:27.210> here<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:27.869> pick<00:01:28.049> up<00:01:28.200> handle<00:01:28.680> and

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
pull out on here and pick up handle and

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.609 
pull out on here and pick up handle and
this<00:01:29.400> handles<00:01:30.180> with<00:01:30.390> locking<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.869> plow<00:01:31.140> onto

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
this handles with locking the plow onto

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.590 
this handles with locking the plow onto
the<00:01:31.710> truck<00:01:31.920> so<00:01:32.729> one<00:01:32.939> on<00:01:33.530> driver<00:01:34.530> side<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:35.600> then

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
the truck so one on driver side and then

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.130 
the truck so one on driver side and then
another<00:01:36.810> on<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.290> passenger<00:01:37.710> side<00:01:38.900> that<00:01:39.900> comes

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
another on the passenger side that comes

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.410 
another on the passenger side that comes
up<00:01:40.259> and<00:01:40.470> that's<00:01:40.619> locked<00:01:40.890> in<00:01:41.270> then<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.390> only

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
up and that's locked in then the only

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.510 
up and that's locked in then the only
other<00:01:42.630> thing<00:01:42.840> we<00:01:43.020> need<00:01:43.259> to<00:01:43.290> do<00:01:43.470> is<00:01:43.619> plug<00:01:43.920> in<00:01:44.310> the

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
other thing we need to do is plug in the

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.940 
other thing we need to do is plug in the
three<00:01:44.790> electrical<00:01:45.210> connections<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:45.960> if<00:01:46.860> you

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
three electrical connections and if you

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.490 
three electrical connections and if you
look<00:01:47.130> at<00:01:47.250> these<00:01:47.369> electrical<00:01:47.880> connections

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
look at these electrical connections

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.920 
look at these electrical connections
they<00:01:49.500> are<00:01:50.210> three<00:01:51.210> different<00:01:51.360> connections

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
they are three different connections

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.740 
they are three different connections
that<00:01:52.079> cannot<00:01:52.350> be<00:01:52.850> plugged<00:01:53.850> in<00:01:54.030> wrong<00:01:54.299> they<00:01:54.630> can

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
that cannot be plugged in wrong they can

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.209 
that cannot be plugged in wrong they can
only<00:01:54.840> be<00:01:55.020> plugged<00:01:55.259> in<00:01:55.409> one<00:01:55.590> way<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:56.040> there's

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
only be plugged in one way and there's
