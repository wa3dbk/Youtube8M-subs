you know with the whole long island ice

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.680 
you know with the whole long island ice
tea<00:02:49.170> thing<00:02:49.440> I<00:02:49.680> think<00:02:50.640> he's<00:02:50.820> on<00:02:51.030> a<00:02:51.060> way<00:02:51.630> to

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.180 
tea thing I think he's on a way to
really<00:02:51.930> building<00:02:52.290> up<00:02:52.380> a<00:02:52.530> fan<00:02:52.740> base<00:02:52.950> so

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
really building up a fan base so

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.130 
really building up a fan base so
hopefully<00:02:53.580> the<00:02:53.700> WWE<00:02:54.300> will<00:02:54.480> realize<00:02:54.840> it<00:02:55.050> and

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
hopefully the WWE will realize it and

hopefully the WWE will realize it and
give<00:02:55.290> him<00:02:55.410> more<00:02:55.590> of<00:02:55.620> a<00:02:55.710> push<00:02:55.920> I<00:02:56.220> would<00:02:57.030> love<00:02:57.240> to
