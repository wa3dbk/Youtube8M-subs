00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:06.140
 We're going to start installing a part. 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.140
 now on that road vehicle 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:13.980
 I got there and then you'll be there. 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.830
 install the glass lifter 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:20.699
 continuously the original voter 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:23.250
 without cutting wire how long we people 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.260
 delayed it did and does its duties that it 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.630
 win because you will get the anti 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.199
 crushing will get relief from 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.239
 pressure and will stay that compromise 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.300
 video by chance did not close and shot 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:39.290
 the alarm for 19 show down to the 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.290
 central state 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:54.590
 Shadow taken yesterday and technology 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:56.540
 really here is connected to wire 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.040
 now we are going to do the programming of the 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:03.100
 video to be able to provide other 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:07.270
 moves the doors 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:11.090
 let's call the contact twice to one 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:17.550
 two in the second is connected to the short way 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:20.850
 three times 2000 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:23.370
 the driver will remember himself 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:27.890
 awaits us he stopped it 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:27.890
 stops up one point down 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.130
 position the ruler one touch up 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:41.480
 he hits the first time down will hit 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.480
 the second time 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.680
 ready this video is already scheduled 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.680
 for a program this here 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:04.280
 position ruler or command to disappear 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.350
 hit the first time 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.080
 hit the second time 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.390
 Now we'll learn only the last. 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.510
 button next to the passenger who heads the 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.510
 executive 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:29.300
 and then way up 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.890
 He goes down alone and finishes programming. 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.660
 then you can now manage the videos that 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:45.910
 he will already have another payment 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:48.150
 You'll send him up in January. 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.150
 payment 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.700
 and it goes up by the alarm 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.130
 i 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.470
 pressure relief 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.440
 there depression has worked 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.810
 ae 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.629
 in case it is switched to not have 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.599
 a hint for almost the engine 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:40.250
 he opens a car open one side of the rope 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:41.720
 in another opportunity it will open the 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:45.590
 other side of the door to avoid fatigue 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:47.950
 on the engine and consequently the machine is 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.950
 that's right
