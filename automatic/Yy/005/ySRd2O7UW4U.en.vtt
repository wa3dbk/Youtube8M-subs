00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:25.400
 continue our test today with us on 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.849
 machine installed such a golden motor 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.449
 smart and 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:33.660
 version of a small motor special 20 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:36.870
 l rim with sunshine and such for 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:41.900
 two-way now we will test 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.900
 and voltage 36 will be so go 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.010
 factory 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.740
 vovchik spun 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:55.070
 well actually 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:59.930
 and shows maxim Greek amps 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:01.340
 direction turgan and speed we have 37 and 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.590
 38 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:06.550
 it's not bad enough for such 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.550
 motor 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:22.550
 when we test the words 80 ur polaris 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:25.850
 polaris 6 volt 802 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:28.970
 but in principle it can work on 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:32.740
 more stress and right now we 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.740
 check it out so let's go 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:44.640
 learned to show with us 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:50.670
 053 ampy yara somewhere holidays and 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:02:00.570
 speed of 50 and 4 kilometers is very good 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:02:07.860
 the result and the last test for 60 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:10.820
 volt very angry test exceed load 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.820
 and current twice 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.340
 go 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:35.810
 well somewhere 0 60 amperes consumption and 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:39.150
 our speed is 62 out of 7 kilometers per hour 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:41.359
 cheerfully and grieving is our battery 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:45.560
 our 

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:48.930
 worth it very well so 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:52.049
 36 volt controller can check in 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.769
 60 jacks as we see nothing puffed 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:56.879
 but not burned means you can 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:59.659
 experimenting but again in 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:04.129
 within reason at your own risk 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:04.129
 so here thanks for attention
