super audio CD players are the pinnacle

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:09.610 
super audio CD players are the pinnacle
of<00:00:07.069> digital<00:00:07.520> sound<00:00:07.790> reproduction<00:00:08.410> but<00:00:09.410> for

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:09.620 
of digital sound reproduction but for

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:11.080 
of digital sound reproduction but for
most<00:00:09.769> of<00:00:09.920> us<00:00:10.040> by<00:00:10.190> the<00:00:10.250> time<00:00:10.490> they<00:00:10.639> came<00:00:10.790> around

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:11.090 
most of us by the time they came around

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:12.669 
most of us by the time they came around
we'd<00:00:11.269> already<00:00:11.540> moved<00:00:11.750> on<00:00:11.900> to<00:00:12.080> more<00:00:12.200> compressed

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:12.679

formats<00:00:13.129> such<00:00:13.339> as<00:00:13.370> mp3<00:00:14.049> so<00:00:15.049> what<00:00:15.139> Sony's<00:00:15.440> done

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:15.620 
formats such as mp3 so what Sony's done

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.580 
formats such as mp3 so what Sony's done
is<00:00:15.769> they've<00:00:15.919> created<00:00:16.160> the<00:00:16.730> UDA<00:00:17.330> one<00:00:17.750> which<00:00:18.320> is

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:18.590 
is they've created the UDA one which is

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:20.230 
is they've created the UDA one which is
essentially<00:00:19.160> a<00:00:19.369> digital<00:00:19.820> to<00:00:19.910> analog

UDA one now there's a necessary thing
you<00:01:07.370> have<00:01:07.580> to<00:01:07.730> do<00:01:07.910> I'm<00:01:08.420> related<00:01:08.750> to

you have to do I'm related to
downloading<00:01:09.260> the<00:01:09.380> driver<00:01:09.700> and<00:01:10.700> so

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
downloading the driver and so

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.230 
downloading the driver and so
unfortunately<00:01:12.380> it's<00:01:12.860> not<00:01:13.400> available<00:01:13.550> on<00:01:13.880> a<00:01:13.940> CD

that's packaged with the disc you have

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.340 
that's packaged with the disc you have
to<00:01:16.400> actually<00:01:16.550> physically<00:01:17.330> type<00:01:17.660> in<00:01:17.900> the<00:01:18.020> URL

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
to actually physically type in the URL

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:19.720 
to actually physically type in the URL
because<00:01:18.770> it's<00:01:18.980> just<00:01:19.160> provided<00:01:19.610> in

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:19.730 
because it's just provided in

because it's just provided in
instruction<00:01:20.270> manuals<00:01:20.630> and<00:01:20.780> then<00:01:20.870> that<00:01:21.020> sends

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:21.230 
instruction manuals and then that sends

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:22.930 
instruction manuals and then that sends
you<00:01:21.380> to<00:01:21.410> a<00:01:21.530> page<00:01:21.800> where<00:01:22.460> you<00:01:22.580> can<00:01:22.700> then

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:22.940 
you to a page where you can then

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.150 
you to a page where you can then
download<00:01:23.540> the<00:01:23.870> driver<00:01:24.560> and<00:01:24.860> have<00:01:25.040> that

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:25.160 
download the driver and have that

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.470 
download the driver and have that
installed<00:01:25.490> which<00:01:25.730> was<00:01:25.850> a<00:01:25.880> relatively<00:01:26.270> simple

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:26.480 
installed which was a relatively simple

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.710 
installed which was a relatively simple
process<00:01:27.280> you'll<00:01:28.280> also<00:01:28.490> need<00:01:28.880> in<00:01:29.210> addition<00:01:29.600> to

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
process you'll also need in addition to

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.950 
process you'll also need in addition to
that<00:01:29.870> a<00:01:30.280> high-resolution<00:01:31.280> audio<00:01:31.700> player<00:01:32.300> so

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
that a high-resolution audio player so

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.920 
that a high-resolution audio player so
your<00:01:33.320> typical<00:01:33.920> iTunes<00:01:34.490> without<00:01:35.270> any<00:01:35.450> kind<00:01:35.870> of

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
your typical iTunes without any kind of

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.200 
your typical iTunes without any kind of
modifications<00:01:36.530> to<00:01:36.590> it<00:01:36.770> will<00:01:36.890> not<00:01:37.100> work<00:01:37.400> sony

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
modifications to it will not work sony

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.120 
modifications to it will not work sony
also<00:01:38.420> provides<00:01:38.900> one<00:01:39.110> of<00:01:39.200> those<00:01:39.380> on<00:01:39.710> their<00:01:39.890> site

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
also provides one of those on their site

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.910 
also provides one of those on their site
again<00:01:41.060> you<00:01:41.330> have<00:01:41.510> to<00:01:41.600> go<00:01:41.720> to<00:01:41.780> another<00:01:42.170> page<00:01:42.470> to

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
again you have to go to another page to

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.130 
again you have to go to another page to
download<00:01:43.340> that<00:01:43.580> so<00:01:43.970> I<00:01:44.000> feel<00:01:44.270> like<00:01:44.300> if<00:01:44.720> those

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
download that so I feel like if those

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.930 
download that so I feel like if those
two<00:01:45.440> things<00:01:45.680> the<00:01:45.979> driver<00:01:46.280> and<00:01:46.610> the<00:01:46.729> player

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:46.940 
two things the driver and the player

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.370 
two things the driver and the player
were<00:01:47.090> bundled<00:01:47.450> together<00:01:47.600> would<00:01:47.930> be<00:01:48.050> a<00:01:48.080> little

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
were bundled together would be a little

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:49.960 
were bundled together would be a little
bit<00:01:48.470> of<00:01:48.620> an<00:01:48.740> easier<00:01:49.070> experience<00:01:49.280> as<00:01:49.670> far<00:01:49.700> as

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
bit of an easier experience as far as

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.450 
bit of an easier experience as far as
getting<00:01:50.120> a<00:01:50.300> setup<00:01:50.510> role<00:01:50.750> in<00:01:50.900> the<00:01:50.990> first<00:01:51.200> place

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
getting a setup role in the first place

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.950 
getting a setup role in the first place
now<00:01:52.460> as<00:01:52.580> I<00:01:52.670> mentioned<00:01:53.060> there<00:01:53.330> are<00:01:53.479> actually

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
now as I mentioned there are actually

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.780 
now as I mentioned there are actually
third-party<00:01:54.770> applications<00:01:55.490> that<00:01:55.610> you<00:01:55.760> can

Sony's own high resolution player so I

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.270 
Sony's own high resolution player so I
was<00:02:11.480> a<00:02:11.540> bit<00:02:11.660> of<00:02:11.720> a<00:02:11.870> surprising<00:02:12.620> to<00:02:12.740> me<00:02:12.890> but

have USB three of course is backwards

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.090 
have USB three of course is backwards
compatible<00:02:34.489> there's<00:02:35.330> also<00:02:35.569> a<00:02:35.720> USB<00:02:36.140> input<00:02:36.800> on

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100

that

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
that

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.010 
that
there's<00:02:42.350> also<00:02:42.590> coaxial<00:02:43.489> digital<00:02:44.020> optical

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
there's also coaxial digital optical

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.770 
there's also coaxial digital optical
digital<00:02:45.320> as<00:02:45.680> well<00:02:45.890> as<00:02:46.180> both<00:02:47.180> inputs<00:02:47.630> and

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
digital as well as both inputs and

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.320 
digital as well as both inputs and
outputs<00:02:48.140> for<00:02:48.230> analog<00:02:48.830> so<00:02:49.730> the<00:02:50.120> nice<00:02:50.300> thing

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
outputs for analog so the nice thing

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:51.940 
outputs for analog so the nice thing
about<00:02:50.570> this<00:02:50.900> is<00:02:51.050> this<00:02:51.170> allows<00:02:51.470> you<00:02:51.680> to<00:02:51.830> either

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
about this is this allows you to either

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.250 
about this is this allows you to either
use<00:02:52.310> it<00:02:52.519> as<00:02:52.700> strictly<00:02:53.510> as<00:02:53.690> a<00:02:53.720> digital<00:02:54.019> to

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
use it as strictly as a digital to

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.080 
use it as strictly as a digital to
analog<00:02:54.590> converter<00:02:54.980> so<00:02:55.250> you<00:02:55.370> could<00:02:55.580> actually

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
analog converter so you could actually

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.690 
analog converter so you could actually
output<00:02:56.600> it<00:02:56.690> into<00:02:56.989> a<00:02:57.019> receiver<00:02:57.769> that<00:02:58.370> you<00:02:58.430> have

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
output it into a receiver that you have

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.699 
output it into a receiver that you have
in<00:02:58.880> your<00:02:59.030> main<00:02:59.269> system<00:02:59.780> and<00:03:00.019> use<00:03:00.500> it<00:03:00.620> to

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
in your main system and use it to

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.130 
in your main system and use it to
playback<00:03:01.010> your<00:03:01.190> files<00:03:01.400> like<00:03:01.610> that<00:03:01.850> or<00:03:02.450> you<00:03:02.989> can

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
playback your files like that or you can

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.390 
playback your files like that or you can
actually<00:03:03.290> use<00:03:03.560> the<00:03:03.709> 20<00:03:03.980> watt<00:03:04.100> amplifier

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
actually use the 20 watt amplifier

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.520 
actually use the 20 watt amplifier
that's<00:03:04.850> actually<00:03:05.810> contained<00:03:06.200> within<00:03:06.380> the

reference<00:03:53.209> system<00:03:53.720> and<00:03:53.930> so<00:03:54.620> from<00:03:54.830> that

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
reference system and so from that

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.220 
reference system and so from that
perspective<00:03:55.160> I<00:03:55.819> think<00:03:55.849> they've<00:03:56.360> Sony's<00:03:57.049> hit

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
perspective I think they've Sony's hit

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.050 
perspective I think they've Sony's hit
the<00:03:57.530> hit<00:03:57.860> a<00:03:57.890> homerun<00:03:58.160> on<00:03:58.579> this<00:03:58.819> particular

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
the hit a homerun on this particular

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.660 
the hit a homerun on this particular
unit<00:03:59.799> now<00:04:00.799> the<00:04:00.860> other<00:04:01.040> thing<00:04:01.220> that<00:04:01.340> I<00:04:01.370> did

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
unit now the other thing that I did

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:04.330 
unit now the other thing that I did
after<00:04:01.910> that<00:04:02.329> was<00:04:02.599> then<00:04:02.840> just<00:04:03.349> uses<00:04:03.829> the<00:04:04.040> unit

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
after that was then just uses the unit

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.880 
after that was then just uses the unit
as<00:04:04.430> a<00:04:04.489> standalone<00:04:05.000> so<00:04:05.959> I<00:04:05.989> hooked<00:04:06.530> up<00:04:06.650> two

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890 
as a standalone so I hooked up two

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:09.009 
as a standalone so I hooked up two
bookshelf<00:04:07.310> speakers<00:04:07.700> to<00:04:07.880> it<00:04:08.030> and<00:04:08.450> I<00:04:08.840> went

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019 
bookshelf speakers to it and I went

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:10.690 
bookshelf speakers to it and I went
ahead<00:04:09.079> and<00:04:09.290> auditioned<00:04:10.099> the<00:04:10.190> system<00:04:10.519> then

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
ahead and auditioned the system then

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.530 
ahead and auditioned the system then
just<00:04:11.120> using<00:04:11.420> those<00:04:11.569> and<00:04:11.900> so<00:04:12.739> once<00:04:12.950> again<00:04:13.540> the

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
just using those and so once again the

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.979 
just using those and so once again the
system<00:04:14.930> sounds<00:04:15.410> wonderful<00:04:16.190> and<00:04:16.430> it<00:04:17.120> was<00:04:17.299> even

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
system sounds wonderful and it was even

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:19.960 
system sounds wonderful and it was even
with<00:04:18.079> disappoint<00:04:18.560> watts<00:04:18.769> per<00:04:19.040> channel<00:04:19.070> it<00:04:19.880> was

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
with disappoint watts per channel it was

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:21.759 
with disappoint watts per channel it was
able<00:04:20.180> to<00:04:20.299> fill<00:04:20.600> a<00:04:20.630> medium-sized<00:04:21.260> room<00:04:21.590> without

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 
able to fill a medium-sized room without

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:24.730

any<00:04:22.070> difficulty<00:04:22.639> at<00:04:22.729> all<00:04:22.910> so<00:04:23.570> again<00:04:23.840> just<00:04:24.530> as<00:04:24.710> a

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
any difficulty at all so again just as a

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.040 
any difficulty at all so again just as a
standalone<00:04:25.250> system<00:04:25.610> yeah<00:04:26.300> for<00:04:26.600> instance<00:04:26.630> in<00:04:26.960> a

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
standalone system yeah for instance in a

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.320 
standalone system yeah for instance in a
din<00:04:27.260> in<00:04:28.070> a<00:04:28.190> secondary<00:04:28.639> room<00:04:28.910> in<00:04:29.000> your<00:04:29.060> bedroom

din in a secondary room in your bedroom
this<00:04:30.110> system<00:04:30.530> is<00:04:30.620> excellent<00:04:31.100> because<00:04:31.400> it<00:04:31.880> it

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
this system is excellent because it it

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.190 
this system is excellent because it it
creates<00:04:33.050> very<00:04:33.889> very<00:04:34.220> detailed<00:04:34.520> vocals<00:04:35.210> a<00:04:35.450> very

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:36.200 
creates very very detailed vocals a very

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.469 
creates very very detailed vocals a very
high<00:04:36.530> quality<00:04:36.590> sound<00:04:37.220> in<00:04:37.550> a<00:04:37.639> small<00:04:37.669> package

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:38.479 
high quality sound in a small package

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:40.480 
high quality sound in a small package
and<00:04:38.720> again<00:04:39.169> it<00:04:39.320> fills<00:04:39.560> up<00:04:39.740> a<00:04:39.919> medium-sized

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
and again it fills up a medium-sized

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.700 
and again it fills up a medium-sized
room<00:04:40.700> without<00:04:41.030> any<00:04:41.240> effort<00:04:41.539> at<00:04:41.660> all<00:04:41.750> now<00:04:42.590> what

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
room without any effort at all now what

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:45.010 
room without any effort at all now what
I<00:04:42.770> was<00:04:42.919> really<00:04:43.190> hoping<00:04:43.490> for<00:04:43.550> was<00:04:44.450> that<00:04:44.539> the<00:04:44.600> UDA

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
I was really hoping for was that the UDA

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.370 
I was really hoping for was that the UDA
one<00:04:45.440> would<00:04:45.919> actually<00:04:46.130> make<00:04:46.639> my<00:04:46.880> mp3s<00:04:47.690> sound<00:04:48.289> a

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
one would actually make my mp3s sound a

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.650 
one would actually make my mp3s sound a
little<00:04:48.500> bit<00:04:48.680> better<00:04:48.889> and<00:04:49.220> anybody<00:04:50.180> who<00:04:50.510> was

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:50.660 
little bit better and anybody who was

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.080 
little bit better and anybody who was
listening<00:04:51.020> to<00:04:51.050> just<00:04:51.530> a<00:04:51.620> normal<00:04:51.979> red<00:04:52.280> book<00:04:52.550> CD

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
listening to just a normal red book CD

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.300 
listening to just a normal red book CD
and<00:04:53.450> a<00:04:53.479> super<00:04:53.720> audio<00:04:53.810> CD<00:04:53.990> player<00:04:54.470> knows<00:04:54.860> that

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 
and a super audio CD player knows that

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.629 
and a super audio CD player knows that
the<00:04:56.200> ability<00:04:57.200> to<00:04:57.229> completely<00:04:57.950> improve<00:04:58.490> the

00:04:58.629 --> 00:04:58.639 
the ability to completely improve the

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:00.820 
the ability to completely improve the
sound<00:04:58.910> of<00:04:59.060> those<00:04:59.210> standard<00:04:59.780> CDs<00:05:00.169> is<00:05:00.410> actually

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
sound of those standard CDs is actually

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.430 
sound of those standard CDs is actually
pretty<00:05:01.039> exceptional<00:05:01.870> you<00:05:02.870> almost<00:05:03.200> feel<00:05:03.380> like

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 
pretty exceptional you almost feel like

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.089 
pretty exceptional you almost feel like
you're<00:05:03.620> listening<00:05:03.830> to<00:05:04.250> a<00:05:04.610> new<00:05:04.880> CD<00:05:05.800> but<00:05:06.800> I

00:05:07.089 --> 00:05:07.099 
you're listening to a new CD but I

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:09.969 
you're listening to a new CD but I
didn't<00:05:08.030> get<00:05:08.120> quite<00:05:08.450> the<00:05:08.660> same<00:05:08.900> in<00:05:09.229> the<00:05:09.500> case<00:05:09.710> of

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:09.979 
didn't get quite the same in the case of

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:12.129 
didn't get quite the same in the case of
mp3's<00:05:10.669> being<00:05:11.300> played<00:05:11.539> back<00:05:11.810> through<00:05:11.840> the

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:12.139 
mp3's being played back through the

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:14.170 
mp3's being played back through the
system<00:05:12.320> in<00:05:12.710> fact<00:05:13.310> what<00:05:13.490> I<00:05:13.520> did<00:05:13.729> an<00:05:13.849> a/b

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:14.180 
system in fact what I did an a/b

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:15.790 
system in fact what I did an a/b
comparison<00:05:14.360> between<00:05:14.990> just<00:05:15.440> a<00:05:15.560> straight

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800 
comparison between just a straight

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.129 
comparison between just a straight
output<00:05:16.220> from<00:05:16.430> my<00:05:16.550> Apple<00:05:16.849> TV<00:05:16.880> playing<00:05:17.870> back<00:05:18.020> an

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:18.139 
output from my Apple TV playing back an

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:21.550 
output from my Apple TV playing back an
mp3<00:05:18.440> file<00:05:18.950> there<00:05:19.729> was<00:05:20.000> no<00:05:20.660> discernible

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:21.560 
mp3 file there was no discernible

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.190 
mp3 file there was no discernible
difference<00:05:22.010> at<00:05:22.190> all<00:05:22.460> so<00:05:23.240> this<00:05:23.630> just<00:05:23.810> goes<00:05:24.020> to

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:24.200 
difference at all so this just goes to

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.350 
difference at all so this just goes to
show<00:05:24.410> that<00:05:24.770> once<00:05:25.099> you<00:05:25.370> compress<00:05:25.820> those<00:05:26.060> files

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:26.360 
show that once you compress those files

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.480 
show that once you compress those files
once<00:05:26.659> you<00:05:26.810> take<00:05:27.020> out<00:05:27.169> that<00:05:27.320> detail<00:05:27.620> that

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:28.490 
once you take out that detail that

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:30.310 
once you take out that detail that
there's<00:05:28.760> no<00:05:28.970> way<00:05:29.090> to<00:05:29.150> get<00:05:29.330> that<00:05:29.479> back<00:05:29.750> even<00:05:30.229> if

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:30.320 
there's no way to get that back even if

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.469 
there's no way to get that back even if
even<00:05:30.620> if<00:05:30.800> the<00:05:30.890> system<00:05:31.070> has<00:05:31.460> some<00:05:31.729> ability<00:05:32.210> to

even if the system has some ability to
try<00:05:32.720> to<00:05:32.780> accommodate<00:05:33.380> for<00:05:33.590> the<00:05:33.770> fact<00:05:33.979> that

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:34.070 
try to accommodate for the fact that

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:35.260 
try to accommodate for the fact that
you're<00:05:34.250> listening<00:05:34.430> to<00:05:34.669> a<00:05:34.729> highly<00:05:35.000> compressed

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:35.270 
you're listening to a highly compressed

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.330 
you're listening to a highly compressed
file<00:05:35.599> you're<00:05:36.169> never<00:05:36.470> going<00:05:36.860> to<00:05:36.890> get<00:05:37.159> that

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:37.340 
file you're never going to get that

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:43.180 
file you're never going to get that
quality<00:05:37.610> back<00:05:38.030> once<00:05:38.360> you<00:05:38.539> lose<00:05:38.720> it<00:05:41.979> so<00:05:42.979> for

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:43.190 
quality back once you lose it so for

quality back once you lose it so for
audio<00:05:43.460> files<00:05:43.520> who<00:05:44.000> are<00:05:44.090> looking<00:05:44.360> to<00:05:44.419> wean

the<00:05:47.990> ATA<00:05:48.500> one<00:05:48.890> is<00:05:49.190> an<00:05:49.400> excellent<00:05:49.760> choice<00:05:50.090> for

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:50.150 
the ATA one is an excellent choice for

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:52.659 
the ATA one is an excellent choice for
doing<00:05:50.659> that<00:05:50.870> now<00:05:51.560> the<00:05:51.620> only<00:05:51.830> drawbacks<00:05:52.400> is

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:52.669 
doing that now the only drawbacks is

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:54.700 
doing that now the only drawbacks is
that<00:05:53.150> is<00:05:53.539> since<00:05:53.840> you<00:05:53.930> have<00:05:53.960> to<00:05:54.200> play<00:05:54.380> the<00:05:54.500> files

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:54.710 
that is since you have to play the files

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:56.770 
that is since you have to play the files
back<00:05:55.010> from<00:05:55.370> your<00:05:55.550> computer<00:05:56.060> they're<00:05:56.570> not

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:56.780 
back from your computer they're not

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:59.050 
back from your computer they're not
going<00:05:57.110> to<00:05:57.260> be<00:05:57.409> the<00:05:57.860> best<00:05:58.159> for<00:05:58.580> integrating

00:05:59.050 --> 00:05:59.060 
going to be the best for integrating

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:03.010 
going to be the best for integrating
into<00:05:59.180> a<00:05:59.659> home<00:06:00.380> theater<00:06:00.770> system<00:06:01.190> so<00:06:02.000> in<00:06:02.810> that

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:03.020 
into a home theater system so in that

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:04.959 
into a home theater system so in that
case<00:06:03.289> Sony<00:06:03.740> has<00:06:03.950> several<00:06:04.520> other<00:06:04.760> high

resolution digital players that actually

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:09.250 
resolution digital players that actually
have<00:06:07.159> internal<00:06:08.060> storage<00:06:08.450> and<00:06:08.599> allow<00:06:08.750> you<00:06:08.810> to

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:09.260 
have internal storage and allow you to

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.589 
have internal storage and allow you to
connect<00:06:09.590> external<00:06:09.800> storage<00:06:10.340> also<00:06:10.610> and<00:06:11.030> for

connect external storage also and for

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:12.969 
connect external storage also and for
this<00:06:11.930> particular<00:06:12.200> case<00:06:12.500> if<00:06:12.620> you're<00:06:12.740> trying<00:06:12.950> to

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:12.979 
this particular case if you're trying to

00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:14.469 
this particular case if you're trying to
integrate<00:06:13.340> it<00:06:13.430> into<00:06:13.610> a<00:06:13.640> system<00:06:14.060> that's

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:14.479 
integrate it into a system that's

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:16.839 
integrate it into a system that's
probably<00:06:14.990> the<00:06:15.200> best<00:06:15.440> way<00:06:15.650> to<00:06:15.680> do<00:06:15.950> it<00:06:16.099> but<00:06:16.729> if

00:06:16.839 --> 00:06:16.849 
probably the best way to do it but if

00:06:16.849 --> 00:06:18.700 
probably the best way to do it but if
you're<00:06:17.000> again<00:06:17.330> setting<00:06:17.930> the<00:06:17.990> system<00:06:18.229> up<00:06:18.530> in

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:18.710 
you're again setting the system up in

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:21.610 
you're again setting the system up in
either<00:06:18.950> a<00:06:19.340> bedroom<00:06:20.120> or<00:06:20.630> your<00:06:20.840> office<00:06:21.020> or<00:06:21.469> a<00:06:21.530> den
