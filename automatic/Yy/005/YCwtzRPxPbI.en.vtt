00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:18.660
 consecrated as one of the greatest 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.430
 surprises this year there is a fight 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.119
 proposes an intriguing story in a 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.119
 post-apocalyptic world 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.020
 Fight for your life survives 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.939
 extreme situations and avoid fights 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.500
 ubisoft proposes this formula of the 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:36.570
 game that more than one will love 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.570
 you are ready for this world 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.400
 History takes us to the future without 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.630
 a clear date the only thing we know is 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.520
 that the world has been affected 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:50.489
 we assume that by climate change or 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.800
 natural catastrophes and now it is not 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.810
 more than a rubbish dump dust and 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.060
 wars 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.560
 our protagonist has no name and 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.420
 we are not told too much about his 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.520
 history we know that before I lived in the 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.110
 city ​​of hamilton where he resided with his 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.110
 Darling woman and her little daughter 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.200
 with an idea without giving more clues the game 

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:15.060
 It places us at the entrance of this city 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.680
 with our protagonist determined to 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.860
 enter it in search of his wife and 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.270
 Daughter like this starts daiana live and little to 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.070
 little will be tearing more of the 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.720
 enough history to 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.390
 keep us hooked on the screen 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.079
 for about five or six hours 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.799
 depending on what we want 

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:30.799
 extend 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.130
 the playable formula is based on the 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:40.930
 survival reloading at every moment 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.880
 that what matters at all costs is 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.009
 stay alive from the beginning 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.990
 we will check how resources are scarce 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:50.890
 and like the humans who are still alive 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.780
 they fight over those valuable objects 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.330
 our protagonist is equipped with 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.820
 a flashlight a gun without bullets a 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.650
 rope to climb and a camcorder to 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.390
 As we move forward we can acquire 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.740
 some useful objects or tools that 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.740
 will help us to go better 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.150
 luckily our adventurer knows 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.209
 climb to the purest ' assassin's style 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.209
 creed 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:20.159
 on the screen we will have two indicators on 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:22.379
 of health that can be recovered by taking 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:25.019
 foods are medicines and on the other hand 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:27.030
 the energy bar this bar will go down 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:29.999
 with our physical efforts such 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.829
 how to run climb hit the important 

00:02:29.999 --> 00:02:34.469
 is to make good use of it and enough 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:36.239
 rest to recover it again if 

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:38.250
 we exceed physically in moments 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:40.920
 ends the physical energy bar 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:44.719
 maximum will go down and then we can only 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.719
 retrieve it again by taking water 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.710
 apart from the exploration the world is 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.840
 dangerous at any time we can 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:55.120
 count them with bandits or violent people 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.510
 and at this time it is very important 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.920
 stand firm and think clearly 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.720
 we can aim with our gun without 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.150
 have bullets because the enemies do not 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.890
 will know if you have ammunition or not and this 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.700
 way to approach an enemy to 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.700
 kill him melee 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.549
 or you can also kill the boss of the 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.700
 group for others to put on 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:14.700
 nervous 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.680
 there is a verse 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.940
 these are just a couple of possibilities 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.560
 that this system offers and we 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.360
 we will have to learn to play and 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.620
 experience different situations and 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.620
 others to get out alive 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.300
 the combat system is therefore 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.740
 important in the game but transmits the 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.510
 feeling that it could have been polished 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:45.670
 a little more or that is certainly 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.670
 repetitive in the last hours of play 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.939
 Apart from this the game has about 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:54.590
 continuation points that would come 

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:56.750
 being like a lifesaver in case we die 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.640
 when dying and if we have one of these 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.950
 points we can return to the point of 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.079
 control instead if we do not have any 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.790
 at that moment we will have to repeat from 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:08.040
 the beginning that chapter 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.450
 as I said the game focuses 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.640
 quite in platform phases and 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.769
 exploration where we can get 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:17.359
 bullets water kits water points 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:17.359
 below and many other things 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.610
 graphically there are analyzes pretty shadow 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.669
 despite not having large 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:29.680
 Advance the game even has 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:31.720
 Nothing interactive textures scenarios 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.669
 something poor characters not very detailed 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.139
 but all this uncovered with great 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:36.820
 skill thanks to filters 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:40.000
 visuals and lighting techniques 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:42.340
 very well achieved the game detaches 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.770
 continuously an oppressive atmosphere with 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.090
 gray and muted tones you have to have 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:50.280
 clear that focuses on the artistic 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:50.280
 leaving more aside the graphic power 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:54.420
 technologically there is not much that 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:56.340
 highlight the game remains fluid and 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:59.780
 without jerks during the whole adventure 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.780
 so it complies in this section 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.729
 lemon perez 

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:09.140
 for the part of sound we are 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.970
 with a very intelligent use of music 

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:13.400
 with sounds that put us in tension 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:15.560
 when we climb and nervous when 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.330
 we are surrounded by enemies besides 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:19.970
 the environmental sounds that help us 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:21.680
 that the world is more real and alive in 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:23.720
 Spain 'the game gets translated into 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.970
 Spanish in their texts but not 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:28.100
 doubled but the original voices are 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:31.360
 pretty good and bring some spark 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.360
 of charisma to the characters 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.200
 they are more soccer 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:50.030
 there analysis was a great proposals 

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:52.100
 of ubisoft for this year at least in the 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:53.690
 arcade game market during the 

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:55.610
 years of development the video game suffered 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:57.830
 big changes delays and even 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:00.110
 cancellations but finally the game has 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:02.090
 seen the light and what can you say about it 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:04.130
 well that has definitely complied with 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:06.200
 expectations and insurance will leave you 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:07.790
 with a good taste in the mouth but maybe with 

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:10.910
 some faults that may have been polished 

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:12.740
 more a very acceptable game with a 

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:15.170
 remarkable length and at a price that well 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:19.310
 is worth 1200 microsoft points 

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:24.370
 or 999 euros on playstation 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:24.370
 in the end to her more
