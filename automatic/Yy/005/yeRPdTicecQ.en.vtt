00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.480
 ifa 2014 and it's time 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.330
 look at the microsoft booth 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.519

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.410

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.060
 on these operating system updates 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.590
 windows phone 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.080
 although the update says it out loud 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.119
 rather, it's just a minor update 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.310
 which is called lumia denim 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.230
 there is little interesting update 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.420
 standard camera application 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.360
 announced the appearance of an application for 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.190
 creating self but voice assistant 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.829
 cortana can now run with 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.290
 using the voice command, by analogy with 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.250
 ok google for google now on of course 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.850
 not without 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.800
 the announcement of new devices all the attention was 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:49.110
 focused on lumia 830 new 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.969
 the smartphone from the feet of the average price 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.520
 segment appearance of this smartphone 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.860
 almost completely copies 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:58.680
 the flagship model lumia 930 is the same 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.780
 design the same colors even 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.969
 metal frame here and 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.430
 I have so it is not the best solution because 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.040
 that everyone is already confused than these people are friend 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.799
 differs from each other in technical issues 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:14.790
 characteristics then they are quite average and this 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:16.890
 no display with a resolution of 1280 by 720 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.040

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.979
 gigahertz and 1 gigabyte operational 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.330
 of memory 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.909
 but here is installed branded 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.560
 camera preview with a resolution of 10 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.049
 megapixels and optical system 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.420
 image stabilization by tradition 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.430
 noke promises cool photo quality 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.610
 and video but we'll see when the device 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.700
 will arrive on a review but leave 830 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.799
 lumia will be about 16 thousand rubles 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.020
 but official prices are getting closer 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:51.420
 To the case two lumia were still presented 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:53.009
 lumia 732 to everyone and lumia 735 is budget 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.560
 device that will cost in the area 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.719
 10 thousand rubles if with the first model 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.329
 everything is clear and the chip is the support of two 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.939
 Sim card whether the mind 735 will please 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:05.130
 ltm support for state employees is 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.840
 frankly the rarity of the rest here 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.020
 mediocre 5 megapixel camera 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.690

 1 gigabyte of RAM built-in 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.060
 by the way only 8 but it can be expanded with 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.340
