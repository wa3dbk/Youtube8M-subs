00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:08.330
 hello everyone today we are going to talk about 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:10.309
 diane mf 8 4x4 version 4 or at least 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:13.309
 that's what he puts in the chicane weston 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:15.919
 I bought it in h face or store for 30 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:19.400
 dollars too much money for this cube 

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:21.170
 and as you see the color is not white is 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.750
 what they call the plastic origin 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.880
 original plastic plastic the twist of 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:29.470
 the outer layers is more or less good 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.470
 let's do a permutation of edges 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.330
 all right 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.920
 let's do a permutation type t 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.760
 because that would be a video without a 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.760
 test type permutation 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.190
 this behavior seems normal 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.400
 Well, you've seen it more or less 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.020
 it rotates well but recently all the time and 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:51.740
 the turn of the internal faces as it is 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:54.320
 pretty painful to look at you see 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:56.650
 I'm not able to do anything with the layers 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.650
 internal 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.090
 a disaster I have adjusted the tensions 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:03.860
 I slackened them I squeezed them 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.070
 turns up me breaking my head and not 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.870
 I found an adequate tension maybe 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.750
 there is adequate tension and the cube 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:13.820
 directly it is bad if I squeeze it 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.680
 a lot of fact now it's very very 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.560
 tight I have the screws to the fullest 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:22.009
 the inner layers almost do not rotate because 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.740
 It's very tight and keeps on doing pop and 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:27.680
 we leave it very loose the cube is 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:30.470
 completely loose and still makes more 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:33.500
 pop I'm not happy with your 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.420
 behavior come out of my sight 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.390
 here you can see the inside of the cube 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.640
 as you can see there are several screws we have 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.410
 this here that is the typical one 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.630
 is in the center of the faces we have 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:47.690
 six like this and then we have these 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:50.630
 screws here that are as in the 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.880
 corners and we have 8 14 screws are 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.560
 many screws if someone knows how 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.119
 get a perfect tension please 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.229
 tell me here we have a couple of 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:59.690
 edges 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:03.350
 this is version 4 and this is the 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:06.729
 del diane mf 8 version 1 and as you can see more 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.729
 or less are similar to fix 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:12.230
 this part of here is longer in this 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.950
 version and then we have this here that 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:18.280
 it's a kind of torpedo that theoretically 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:21.080
 I should keep the cube from pop 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.960
 but good as always, one thing is 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.420
 theory and other practice here we have 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:29.390
 a corner these corners are 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:34.130
 formed by these pieces you see here the 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:37.550
 typical diane design we do well 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.230
 and we hooked and as you can see the base is 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.480
 pretty big not if we compare it by 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.800
 example with this corner here we are going to 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.960
 see anyhow the cut of 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:48.600
 Direct cut corners 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:51.740
 the line with line does it a little bit 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:54.440
 rather a little more 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:56.460
 you see that it looks like it's going to be pop and 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:01.110
 reverse cut 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:03.480
 see what you're going to do pop right now 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.640
 then I met inverse the reverse cut 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.650
 it's very dangerous in this cube and if 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.650
 we move the internal layers 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:14.290
 so little thing is not also true that 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.629
 as I said before I have the screws very 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.299
 tight, because if I did not do very little 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:22.599
 still more than now is another version 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:26.980
 of Dalian more in f8 4x4 that I have is 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:30.430
 much better than this be this 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.620
 as I do not like it for several reasons 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:36.129
 it is deformed it does not look like a bucket 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:39.120
 sometimes it seems anything else 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:43.030
 Tensions are very difficult to adjust 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:45.040
 it pop almost every time 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.920
 that I solve it and it is also very expensive and 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.170
 it costs 30 dollars this cube does not 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.689
 I recommend man for 30 dollars 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:55.989
 I buy before the club 4x4 without a doubt 

00:03:52.689 --> 00:04:00.370
 some is more for 30 dollars I buy 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:03.010
 3 by 3 sensor wine the same show 4x4 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:05.859
 the sensor 5 by 5 and I still have money left 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.959
 Anyway, I'll keep looking for the 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:11.049
 appropriate tensions and if I find them 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:15.299
 upload in a video meanwhile a 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:15.299
 I greet everyone and see you in another video
