really cool for a lot of reasons because

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.760 
really cool for a lot of reasons because
of<00:01:15.250> the<00:01:15.460> way<00:01:15.580> that<00:01:15.759> they<00:01:16.200> learned<00:01:17.200> to<00:01:17.350> sing<00:01:17.619> and

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
of the way that they learned to sing and

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.170 
of the way that they learned to sing and
they<00:01:17.829> communicate<00:01:18.009> with<00:01:18.549> each<00:01:18.700> other<00:01:18.880> and

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.180 
they communicate with each other and

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.880 
they communicate with each other and
there's<00:01:19.360> differences<00:01:20.290> between<00:01:20.470> the<00:01:20.680> males

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
there's differences between the males

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.499 
there's differences between the males
and<00:01:21.009> the<00:01:21.100> females<00:01:21.159> and<00:01:22.000> so<00:01:22.090> there's<00:01:22.270> a<00:01:22.299> lot<00:01:22.450> of

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:22.509

involved in things like learning and
memory<00:01:44.770> when<00:01:45.280> I<00:01:45.310> say<00:01:45.549> genes<00:01:46.000> I'm<00:01:46.360> referring<00:01:46.899> to

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979

the<00:01:47.979> the<00:01:48.369> information<00:01:49.090> right<00:01:49.600> that<00:01:49.930> is<00:01:50.049> in<00:01:50.320> our

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:50.439 
the the information right that is in our

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:55.350 
the the information right that is in our
DNA<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:52.200> every<00:01:53.200> cell<00:01:53.439> in<00:01:53.799> our<00:01:53.950> body<00:01:54.399> has<00:01:54.549> that

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
DNA and every cell in our body has that

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.240 
DNA and every cell in our body has that
information<00:01:55.750> including<00:01:56.380> our<00:01:56.500> brain<00:01:56.680> cells<00:01:56.979> so

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
information including our brain cells so

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.850 
information including our brain cells so
whenever<00:01:58.210> our<00:01:58.270> brain<00:01:58.810> cells<00:01:59.140> form<00:01:59.619> new

whenever our brain cells form new

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.639 
whenever our brain cells form new
memories<00:01:59.890> the<00:02:00.549> evidence<00:02:00.939> is<00:02:01.180> that<00:02:01.649> they're

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:02.649 
memories the evidence is that they're

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:04.560 
memories the evidence is that they're
actually<00:02:03.039> having<00:02:03.189> to<00:02:03.340> go<00:02:03.490> to<00:02:03.549> the<00:02:03.789> genomes<00:02:04.240> and

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
actually having to go to the genomes and

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.240 
actually having to go to the genomes and
say<00:02:04.750> to<00:02:05.020> make<00:02:05.170> this<00:02:05.289> memory<00:02:05.649> happen<00:02:05.950> I<00:02:06.009> got<00:02:06.159> to

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
say to make this memory happen I got to

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.690 
say to make this memory happen I got to
turn<00:02:06.430> this<00:02:06.640> gene<00:02:06.939> on<00:02:07.090> or<00:02:07.659> turn<00:02:08.530> it<00:02:08.680> off<00:02:08.860> when<00:02:09.580> we

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
turn this gene on or turn it off when we

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.190 
turn this gene on or turn it off when we

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.840

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.370 
think these differences in gene

the<00:06:44.940> other<00:06:45.120> strategy<00:06:46.080> is<00:06:46.350> that<00:06:46.890> if<00:06:47.400> you

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:47.550 
the other strategy is that if you

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:49.790 
the other strategy is that if you
