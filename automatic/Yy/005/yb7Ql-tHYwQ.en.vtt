00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 it is evident as you see the title we are going to 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:13.469
 talk about the news of the new 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:15.870
 jailbreak for ios 6.1 welcome 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.180
 back to your best channel 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.869
 technology with your minister server 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.240
 friend tx and still super good wave 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:26.010
 leave a big one to this video so that 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.470
 the channel continues to grow and also the 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.560
 community in spanish and good people let's go 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.300
 to be talking now about the jailbreak 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.190
 from the famous jailbreak that we are all 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.920
 waiting for the new system 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.860
 operative 6.1 good and why do we 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.629
 we refer to this I 'break' to 6.1 as 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.760
 how important is this update 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.190
 I believe that the first issue we have 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.680
 what to touch is this new update and 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.140
 good in this new 6.1 that just 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.090
 launch app we also see are quite 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.520
 changes that generally affect the 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.770
 user 1 being that they already approved the dt 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.780
 for several countries although there are none 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.239
 on that list for Latin America but yes 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.250
 includes puerto rico the others is music 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.380
 beat and other things but 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.660
 what is it that affects us so much for 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.880
 community of man previously the 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:15.360
 hackers of these men had gone out to 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.130
 say that for 6.1 I was going to see it rain and 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.110
 although there is no more karting than 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.660
 composed what was the group of these 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.940
 hackers who made helium 'breaks' end up 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:26.340
 to open a new group called 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.380
 sliders in this new group are included 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.300
 four that were previously in the 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.210
 group of dave team one of these groups 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:35.970
 being more summer tweets on Monday 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.130
 this Sunday is the big bowl that they are going to 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.410
 be doing you and this what 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.840
 means to us or what translation 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:45.000
 or what conclusion we can get good you 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.460
 we give your next tweet in summary the 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.580
 tweet says I feel really bad for the 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.430
 people who are following the fake group 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:56.640
 denver on twitter and also people 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.979
 that is following the fake page in 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.560
 facebook of inverse because they are going to 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.970
 lose a lot this weekend and 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.590
 coming to the conclusion of that my 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.350
 opinion is that he wants to imply 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.239
 that although they have not posted anything in this 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.869
 facebook nor in this new 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.569
 twitter of the beards 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.790
 it may be that this Sunday they may be 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:19.599
 announcing the new jailbreak for the 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.909
 6.1 will be true or not the truth is by 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:24.400
 See yourself until Sunday of the Super Bowl 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:26.709
 which is February 3 to see if everything 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.470
 this is true we have to wait until 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:32.500
 February 3 to make sure it's true 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.239
 One thing to note is that many pages 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.670
 out there we are also 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:38.709
 recommending that we do not update until 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.690
 open in the channel of my being friends I the 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.940
 I'm really recommending read all that 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.129
 do not update to this new version by 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.709
 several reasons and the first one is going to be very 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:50.739
 important is that if you are already I break and 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:53.829
 update to this new version 6.1 you go 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:55.629
 to lose your envelope completely not 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:58.180
 we know if this is really going to come out 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:59.859
 Sunday this new job number 2 many 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.989
 they are saying out there that for 

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:04.239
 realize this new yo break we are going to 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:06.879
 need to update our phone to 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:10.120
 through our computer and not only 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:12.190
 through what is the phone that 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.520
 allows us to update the phone on 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:18.370
 a wifi network and the last reason may be 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.500
 that at the time of launching the I because 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.380
 this Sunday is that she is not ready to 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.970
 6.1 and only this one for which is the 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.420
 update that is right now that in 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:30.670
 reality of the 6 points 0.1 and not what 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.290
 you can update to this new me see in 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.540
 conclusion between the truth is that what 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.940
 better to wait to see what happens 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.650
 Sunday if it is a reality or is it just 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.940
 what happened earlier with dreams or 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.680
 break that they were announcing in 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.630
 twitter that was going to come out and in the end everything 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.130
 it was a naturalness to actually have 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.040
 what is happening, I know that a lot of people 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:51.220
 is anxious and believe me that at the moment 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:53.080
 that we have an official name for the 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.840
 versions that are looking here at a 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:58.870
 my side, let's bring the video to 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.910
 this channel that is a safe brics me 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.040
 that is anti that does not have any 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.840
 problem I assure you that they will be 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.000
 seeing it in this channel and good before with 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.910
 we are saying goodbye to this great 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.120
 issue the truth this question I receive it to 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.530

 and I wanted to explain a little bit better and 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.950

 recommended I want to update what is 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.880

 giving false information to jafari things and 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.120
