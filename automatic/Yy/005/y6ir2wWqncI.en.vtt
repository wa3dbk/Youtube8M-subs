00:00:04.429 --> 00:00:04.439 
so I've cut out pretty much most of the

00:00:04.439 --> 00:00:08.000 
so I've cut out pretty much most of the
rot<00:00:04.970> in<00:00:05.970> the<00:00:06.059> areas<00:00:06.329> I<00:00:06.419> can<00:00:06.569> get<00:00:06.720> to<00:00:07.010> difficult

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
rot in the areas I can get to difficult

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.509 
rot in the areas I can get to difficult
moment<00:00:08.900> so<00:00:09.900> we've<00:00:10.049> got<00:00:10.139> this<00:00:10.259> nice<00:00:10.469> big<00:00:10.740> area

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
moment so we've got this nice big area

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.570 
moment so we've got this nice big area
out<00:00:11.849> here<00:00:12.259> this<00:00:13.259> looks<00:00:13.530> absolutely<00:00:13.709> fine<00:00:14.429> from

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
out here this looks absolutely fine from

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.150 
out here this looks absolutely fine from
the<00:00:14.669> top<00:00:14.879> when<00:00:15.089> I<00:00:15.150> checked<00:00:15.419> underneath<00:00:16.160> little

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
the top when I checked underneath little

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.419 
the top when I checked underneath little
Howell<00:00:17.310> appeared<00:00:17.670> so<00:00:18.380> it's<00:00:19.380> got<00:00:19.560> cut<00:00:19.920> that<00:00:20.070> bit

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:20.429 
Howell appeared so it's got cut that bit

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:27.859 
Howell appeared so it's got cut that bit
out<00:00:20.550> there<00:00:21.380> and<00:00:22.849> so<00:00:23.849> it's<00:00:24.029> worked<00:00:24.330> there<00:00:26.869> got

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
out there and so it's worked there got

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.429 
out there and so it's worked there got
the<00:00:28.050> got<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.500> diesel<00:00:28.890> expansion<00:00:29.369> tank<00:00:29.640> out

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:30.439 
the got the diesel expansion tank out

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:37.310 
the got the diesel expansion tank out
so<00:00:32.030> now<00:00:33.030> cut<00:00:33.960> right<00:00:34.200> round<00:00:34.560> there<00:00:36.020> is<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.080> bit

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
so now cut right round there is a bit

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.700 
so now cut right round there is a bit
under<00:00:37.620> there<00:00:37.770> which<00:00:37.950> I<00:00:38.070> need<00:00:38.220> to<00:00:38.340> get<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:42.710> it's

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
under there which I need to get to it's

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.580 
under there which I need to get to it's
all<00:00:43.860> cut<00:00:44.130> to<00:00:44.280> new<00:00:44.400> metal<00:00:44.900> needs<00:00:45.900> tidying<00:00:46.170> up<00:00:46.410> of

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
all cut to new metal needs tidying up of

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.970 
all cut to new metal needs tidying up of
course<00:00:47.750> then<00:00:48.750> we've<00:00:48.870> got<00:00:48.990> this<00:00:49.140> section<00:00:49.590> here

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
course then we've got this section here

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.590 
course then we've got this section here
still<00:00:50.610> not<00:00:50.730> decided<00:00:50.880> what<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.300> do<00:00:51.390> with<00:00:51.510> this

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
still not decided what to do with this

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.560 
still not decided what to do with this
yet<00:00:52.430> I've<00:00:53.430> asked<00:00:53.760> on<00:00:53.880> the<00:00:54.060> just<00:00:55.050> campers<00:00:56.570> forum

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
yet I've asked on the just campers forum

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.900 
yet I've asked on the just campers forum
the<00:00:58.530> diesel<00:00:58.860> expansion<00:00:59.310> tanks<00:00:59.580> are<00:00:59.700> really

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
the diesel expansion tanks are really

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.100 
the diesel expansion tanks are really
necessary<00:01:00.090> because<00:01:00.510> I've<00:01:00.690> never<00:01:00.900> come<00:01:01.080> across

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.110 
necessary because I've never come across

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.680 
necessary because I've never come across
a<00:01:01.560> vehicle<00:01:02.550> with<00:01:02.820> these<00:01:03.210> looking<00:01:03.480> at<00:01:03.600> with

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
a vehicle with these looking at with

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.370 
a vehicle with these looking at with
expansion<00:01:04.049> tanks<00:01:04.469> or<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.649> fuel<00:01:04.859> tank<00:01:06.380> if

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
expansion tanks or the fuel tank if

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.510 
expansion tanks or the fuel tank if
they're<00:01:07.560> not<00:01:07.649> really<00:01:07.799> necessary<00:01:08.340> I'll

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
they're not really necessary I'll

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.760 
they're not really necessary I'll
probably<00:01:08.670> get<00:01:08.850> shot<00:01:08.880> over<00:01:09.350> and<00:01:10.350> then<00:01:10.500> I<00:01:10.560> don't

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
probably get shot over and then I don't

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.020 
probably get shot over and then I don't
have<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:11.090> mess<00:01:12.090> about<00:01:12.240> trying<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.719> fabricate<00:01:13.259> a

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
have to mess about trying to fabricate a

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.749 
have to mess about trying to fabricate a
new<00:01:15.030> cup<00:01:15.719> for<00:01:16.619> that<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:16.950> go<00:01:17.070> into<00:01:17.249> you<00:01:17.520> know<00:01:17.579> for

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
new cup for that to go into you know for

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.859 
new cup for that to go into you know for
the<00:01:17.850> temp<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.359> sit<00:01:18.570> in<00:01:20.420> and<00:01:21.420> I<00:01:21.600> can<00:01:21.749> just

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
the temp to sit in and I can just

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.989 
the temp to sit in and I can just
basically<00:01:22.020> cut<00:01:22.409> out<00:01:22.590> that<00:01:23.249> whole<00:01:23.490> thing<00:01:23.759> there

00:01:23.989 --> 00:01:23.999 
basically cut out that whole thing there

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:35.050 
basically cut out that whole thing there
and<00:01:24.409> worldA<00:01:25.409> patch<00:01:25.619> in

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:41.660 

you

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.310 

so<00:01:42.670> that's<00:01:42.909> it<00:01:43.119> so<00:01:43.299> far<00:01:43.329> this<00:01:43.750> is<00:01:43.810> all<00:01:43.990> back<00:01:44.170> to

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
so that's it so far this is all back to

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:53.149 
so that's it so far this is all back to
sound<00:01:47.909> that's<00:01:48.909> all<00:01:49.149> good<00:01:49.420> there<00:01:51.719> so<00:01:52.719> that's

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
sound that's all good there so that's

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.350 
sound that's all good there so that's
progress<00:01:54.159> over<00:01:55.770> so<00:01:56.770> I've<00:01:56.920> welded<00:01:57.159> up<00:01:57.490> well<00:01:58.329> I

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
progress over so I've welded up well I

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.730 
progress over so I've welded up well I
didn't<00:01:58.659> see<00:01:58.719> off<00:01:58.840> cutter<00:01:59.079> you<00:01:59.350> know<00:01:59.409> cut<00:01:59.590> out

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
didn't see off cutter you know cut out

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.569 
didn't see off cutter you know cut out
these<00:01:59.920> bits<00:02:00.100> here<00:02:00.310> and<00:02:00.549> just<00:02:01.209> said<00:02:01.439> and<00:02:02.579> I've

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:03.579 
these bits here and just said and I've

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:08.609 
these bits here and just said and I've
welded<00:02:03.909> up<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:05.770> back<00:02:06.130> panel<00:02:06.579> here<00:02:07.619> I've

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
welded up the back panel here I've

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.319 
welded up the back panel here I've
welded<00:02:08.860> a<00:02:09.009> piece<00:02:09.220> in<00:02:09.429> there<00:02:10.110> and<00:02:11.110> up<00:02:11.590> there<00:02:12.329> and

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:13.329 
welded a piece in there and up there and

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:15.660 
welded a piece in there and up there and
along<00:02:14.019> and<00:02:14.709> then<00:02:14.920> there's<00:02:15.069> another<00:02:15.130> piece<00:02:15.430> in

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
along and then there's another piece in

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.350 
along and then there's another piece in
here<00:02:16.060> which<00:02:16.450> goes<00:02:16.690> underneath<00:02:18.000> when<00:02:19.000> i<00:02:19.030> weld

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
here which goes underneath when i weld

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.940 
here which goes underneath when i weld
the<00:02:19.569> fronton<00:02:20.260> along<00:02:20.799> here<00:02:21.069> this<00:02:21.610> piece<00:02:21.880> here

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
the fronton along here this piece here

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.680 
the fronton along here this piece here
I'll<00:02:23.950> get<00:02:24.130> underneath<00:02:24.340> and<00:02:24.640> our<00:02:24.819> world<00:02:25.090> that<00:02:25.269> -

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
I'll get underneath and our world that -

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.930 
I'll get underneath and our world that -
that<00:02:25.840> bit<00:02:26.049> there<00:02:26.200> which<00:02:26.349> I've<00:02:26.530> welded<00:02:26.739> in<00:02:27.040> on

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
that bit there which I've welded in on

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:37.350 
that bit there which I've welded in on
the<00:02:28.060> other<00:02:28.239> side<00:02:31.230> I've<00:02:32.230> welded<00:02:32.530> up<00:02:36.120> this<00:02:37.120> by

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
the other side I've welded up this by

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:43.170 
the other side I've welded up this by
here<00:02:39.150> so<00:02:40.150> there's<00:02:40.329> a<00:02:40.530> piece<00:02:41.530> in<00:02:41.739> there<00:02:42.180> to

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
here so there's a piece in there to

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.690 
here so there's a piece in there to
cover<00:02:43.450> the<00:02:43.599> bit<00:02:43.930> that<00:02:44.079> I<00:02:44.170> cut<00:02:44.410> out<00:02:44.440> is<00:02:45.010> a<00:02:45.069> little

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
cover the bit that I cut out is a little

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.819 
cover the bit that I cut out is a little
rust<00:02:45.910> hole<00:02:46.090> this<00:02:46.269> I<00:02:46.480> cut<00:02:46.690> that<00:02:46.780> out<00:02:46.840> will<00:02:47.680> do

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:47.829 
rust hole this I cut that out will do

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:52.740 
rust hole this I cut that out will do
that<00:02:47.980> in<00:02:48.510> and<00:02:49.510> as<00:02:50.230> that<00:02:50.560> welded<00:02:51.010> on<00:02:51.480> by<00:02:52.480> there

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
that in and as that welded on by there

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.900 
that in and as that welded on by there
I'm<00:02:53.019> then<00:02:53.200> going<00:02:53.230> to<00:02:53.380> weld<00:02:53.620> gonna<00:02:54.549> cut<00:02:54.730> out<00:02:54.880> a

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
I'm then going to weld gonna cut out a

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.400 
I'm then going to weld gonna cut out a
little<00:02:55.120> bit<00:02:55.329> world<00:02:55.510> there<00:02:55.810> a<00:02:55.930> little<00:02:56.230> bit<00:02:56.349> of

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
little bit world there a little bit of

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.069 
little bit world there a little bit of
rust<00:02:56.650> and<00:02:57.269> then<00:02:58.269> I'm<00:02:58.389> going<00:02:58.540> to<00:02:58.569> world<00:02:58.780> a<00:02:58.900> piece

00:02:59.069 --> 00:02:59.079 
rust and then I'm going to world a piece

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:02.479 
rust and then I'm going to world a piece
of<00:02:59.230> metal<00:02:59.940> straight<00:03:00.940> over<00:03:01.180> the<00:03:01.269> front<00:03:01.540> of<00:03:01.690> that

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
of metal straight over the front of that

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:07.290 
of metal straight over the front of that
and<00:03:03.489> then<00:03:03.880> I<00:03:03.970> will<00:03:04.030> how'll<00:03:04.599> they<00:03:04.840> seal<00:03:05.500> it

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
and then I will how'll they seal it

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.330 
and then I will how'll they seal it
oh<00:03:07.500> excuse<00:03:08.500> the<00:03:08.710> sound<00:03:09.040> of<00:03:09.160> my<00:03:09.250> leather<00:03:09.460> jacket

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
oh excuse the sound of my leather jacket

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.160

doesn't<00:03:12.340> sound<00:03:12.700> too<00:03:12.850> good<00:03:12.880> I<00:03:13.210> should<00:03:13.960> always

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
doesn't sound too good I should always

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:15.360 
doesn't sound too good I should always
wear<00:03:14.350> a<00:03:14.410> leather<00:03:14.620> jacket<00:03:14.710> really<00:03:15.100> when<00:03:15.310> the

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
wear a leather jacket really when the

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.460 
wear a leather jacket really when the
welding<00:03:15.640> because<00:03:15.970> it<00:03:16.210> doesn't<00:03:16.480> burn<00:03:17.020> holes<00:03:17.320> in

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
welding because it doesn't burn holes in

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.200 
welding because it doesn't burn holes in
it<00:03:18.630> so<00:03:19.630> that's<00:03:19.930> going<00:03:20.080> to<00:03:20.170> be<00:03:20.230> sealed<00:03:20.440> up<00:03:20.590> there

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:21.210 
it so that's going to be sealed up there

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:25.890 
it so that's going to be sealed up there
so<00:03:22.210> that's<00:03:22.390> that<00:03:22.600> sorted<00:03:23.080> so<00:03:23.290> far<00:03:23.530> I<00:03:24.600> also<00:03:25.600> be

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
so that's that sorted so far I also be

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.690 
so that's that sorted so far I also be
painting<00:03:26.320> that<00:03:26.440> and<00:03:26.680> I'll<00:03:26.950> be<00:03:27.070> sitting<00:03:27.280> seam

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
painting that and I'll be sitting seam

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.980 
painting that and I'll be sitting seam
sealing<00:03:27.970> that<00:03:28.260> there<00:03:30.240> so<00:03:31.240> that's<00:03:31.420> that<00:03:31.600> bit<00:03:31.810> so

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:31.990 
sealing that there so that's that bit so

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:37.320 
sealing that there so that's that bit so
far<00:03:32.200> so<00:03:32.440> I'm<00:03:32.500> now<00:03:32.650> going<00:03:32.890> to<00:03:34.350> cut<00:03:35.350> out<00:03:36.330> the

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
far so I'm now going to cut out the

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:38.580 
far so I'm now going to cut out the
fleece<00:03:37.540> which<00:03:37.690> I<00:03:37.780> made<00:03:37.960> with<00:03:37.990> this<00:03:38.170> template

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
fleece which I made with this template

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.970 
fleece which I made with this template
here<00:03:38.920> I<00:03:39.840> put<00:03:40.840> off<00:03:40.930> just<00:03:41.230> cut<00:03:41.410> a<00:03:41.440> piece<00:03:41.500> of<00:03:41.740> metal

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
here I put off just cut a piece of metal

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.760 
here I put off just cut a piece of metal
to<00:03:42.070> go<00:03:42.160> in<00:03:42.280> there<00:03:42.630> and<00:03:43.630> then<00:03:43.780> weld<00:03:44.020> that<00:03:44.200> in

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:46.770 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:48.870 

then<00:03:47.770> there's<00:03:47.950> a<00:03:47.980> case<00:03:48.190> of<00:03:48.400> putting<00:03:48.550> a<00:03:48.730> piece

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
then there's a case of putting a piece

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.560 
then there's a case of putting a piece
of<00:03:49.030> metal<00:03:49.150> in<00:03:49.330> there<00:03:49.540> a<00:03:49.780> bit<00:03:50.530> across<00:03:50.650> there<00:03:50.950> and

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
of metal in there a bit across there and

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.990 
of metal in there a bit across there and
the<00:03:52.570> seatbelt<00:03:52.780> mounting<00:03:53.380> is<00:03:53.500> on<00:03:53.820> so<00:03:54.820> that's

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
the seatbelt mounting is on so that's

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.530 
the seatbelt mounting is on so that's
that<00:03:55.120> bit<00:03:55.330> so<00:03:55.510> far<00:03:56.820> so<00:03:57.820> that<00:03:57.970> piece<00:03:58.210> is<00:03:58.390> now

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
that bit so far so that piece is now

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:04.610 
that bit so far so that piece is now
welded<00:03:58.990> in<00:03:59.080> there<00:04:00.540> and<00:04:01.540> lovely<00:04:02.260> and<00:04:02.350> strong

hole appear so I've filled it in with
world<00:04:19.859> this<00:04:20.859> is<00:04:21.040> all<00:04:21.160> solid<00:04:21.370> it's<00:04:21.940> no<00:04:22.090> filler

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:22.390 
world this is all solid it's no filler

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:26.370 
world this is all solid it's no filler
or<00:04:22.660> rust<00:04:23.230> in<00:04:23.380> there<00:04:23.530> don't<00:04:24.520> see<00:04:24.760> me<00:04:25.380> filtering

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
or rust in there don't see me filtering

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:27.510 
or rust in there don't see me filtering
that<00:04:26.500> I<00:04:26.650> was<00:04:26.770> quite<00:04:26.950> surprised<00:04:27.220> I<00:04:27.370> thought

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
that I was quite surprised I thought

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.030 
that I was quite surprised I thought
that'd<00:04:27.700> be<00:04:28.140> there<00:04:29.140> be<00:04:29.320> full<00:04:29.470> of<00:04:29.590> rust<00:04:29.770> but<00:04:29.830> it's

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:30.040 
that'd be there be full of rust but it's

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.830 
that'd be there be full of rust but it's
not<00:04:31.200> full<00:04:32.200> of<00:04:32.230> me<00:04:32.470> for<00:04:32.650> the<00:04:32.710> pillow<00:04:32.980> and<00:04:33.130> holes

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
not full of me for the pillow and holes

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.740 
not full of me for the pillow and holes
it's<00:04:34.840> nice<00:04:34.990> and<00:04:35.140> solid<00:04:35.230> so<00:04:35.620> I<00:04:36.450> think<00:04:37.450> I<00:04:37.540> might

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
it's nice and solid so I think I might

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.590 
it's nice and solid so I think I might
do<00:04:37.900> me<00:04:38.020> for<00:04:38.140> today<00:04:38.910> it's<00:04:39.910> amazing<00:04:40.270> how<00:04:40.360> long

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 
do me for today it's amazing how long

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.240 
do me for today it's amazing how long
these<00:04:40.780> things<00:04:41.110> take<00:04:41.380> just<00:04:41.650> little<00:04:41.919> stuff<00:04:42.220> like

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 
these things take just little stuff like

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:48.030 
these things take just little stuff like
that<00:04:42.610> I<00:04:43.410> can<00:04:44.410> crack<00:04:44.650> on<00:04:44.680> tomorrow<00:04:45.190> now<00:04:47.040> weather

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.040 
that I can crack on tomorrow now weather

that I can crack on tomorrow now weather
permitting<00:04:48.540> that's<00:04:49.540> the<00:04:49.660> problem<00:04:49.900> there<00:04:50.110> in

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.040 
permitting that's the problem there in
