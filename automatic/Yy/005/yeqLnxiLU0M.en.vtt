00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
mixed into it this a little bit of white

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:27.850 
mixed into it this a little bit of white
on<00:01:25.909> here<00:01:26.210> is<00:01:26.420> the<00:01:26.600> hardener<00:01:27.049> it's<00:01:27.500> normally

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
on here is the hardener it's normally

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.740 
on here is the hardener it's normally
about<00:01:28.009> a<00:01:28.070> twenty<00:01:28.460> to<00:01:28.579> one<00:01:28.610> mixture<00:01:29.240> and<00:01:29.630> you

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
about a twenty to one mixture and you

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.210 
about a twenty to one mixture and you
just<00:01:29.960> mix<00:01:30.170> these<00:01:30.320> in<00:01:30.560> here<00:01:30.799> and<00:01:30.979> the<00:01:31.040> main

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
just mix these in here and the main

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.370 
just mix these in here and the main
thing<00:01:31.460> is<00:01:31.640> to<00:01:31.670> get<00:01:31.909> it<00:01:32.000> thoroughly<00:01:32.299> mixed<00:01:32.930> once

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
thing is to get it thoroughly mixed once

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.649 
thing is to get it thoroughly mixed once
you<00:01:33.470> have<00:01:33.560> a<00:01:33.590> thoroughly<00:01:34.009> mixed<00:01:34.250> in<00:01:34.659> partner

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
you have a thoroughly mixed in partner

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:37.179 
you have a thoroughly mixed in partner
all<00:01:35.810> the<00:01:35.930> way<00:01:36.020> through<00:01:36.259> you<00:01:36.799> just<00:01:36.979> take<00:01:37.159> a

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:37.189 
all the way through you just take a

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:39.010 
all the way through you just take a
little<00:01:37.549> bit<00:01:37.670> and<00:01:38.210> you're<00:01:38.360> just<00:01:38.509> going<00:01:38.659> to<00:01:38.689> fill

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
little bit and you're just going to fill

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.500 
little bit and you're just going to fill
the<00:01:39.500> area<00:01:39.860> such<00:01:40.820> as<00:01:40.850> that<00:01:41.560> we're<00:01:42.560> going

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:43.510 
the area such as that we're going

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.250 
the area such as that we're going
over<00:01:43.630> here<00:01:43.810> on<00:01:43.930> this<00:01:44.020> area<00:01:45.690> spot<00:01:46.690> right<00:01:46.780> there

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:47.260 
over here on this area spot right there

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.770 
over here on this area spot right there
and<00:01:47.560> so<00:01:47.680> then<00:01:47.830> once<00:01:48.010> you've<00:01:48.160> got<00:01:48.340> it<00:01:48.670> the<00:01:49.300> Hawks

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
and so then once you've got it the Hawks

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.330 
and so then once you've got it the Hawks
unit<00:01:50.050> as<00:01:50.140> you<00:01:50.290> can<00:01:50.410> see<00:01:50.560> it<00:01:50.650> really<00:01:51.070> doesn't

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
unit as you can see it really doesn't

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:52.920 
unit as you can see it really doesn't
take<00:01:51.640> very<00:01:51.670> much<00:01:51.940> but<00:01:52.270> you<00:01:52.390> just<00:01:52.570> want<00:01:52.750> to<00:01:52.810> make

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930 
take very much but you just want to make

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:54.630 
take very much but you just want to make
sure<00:01:53.020> you<00:01:53.110> got<00:01:53.260> it<00:01:53.320> completely<00:01:53.770> full<00:01:54.130> and<00:01:54.490> so

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
sure you got it completely full and so

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.160 
sure you got it completely full and so
we're<00:01:54.760> gonna<00:01:54.820> wait<00:01:55.030> about<00:01:55.150> 15<00:01:55.630> minutes<00:01:55.900> or<00:01:55.990> so

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
we're gonna wait about 15 minutes or so

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:57.840 
we're gonna wait about 15 minutes or so
and<00:01:56.410> that<00:01:56.440> should<00:01:56.710> be<00:01:56.800> dry<00:01:57.040> but<00:01:57.520> if<00:01:57.610> the<00:01:57.700> way<00:01:57.790> to

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
and that should be dry but if the way to

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.460 
and that should be dry but if the way to
check<00:01:58.150> it<00:01:58.360> is<00:01:58.450> to<00:01:58.480> check<00:01:58.810> the<00:01:58.960> material<00:01:59.350> it's

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
check it is to check the material it's

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.500 
check it is to check the material it's
on<00:01:59.650> your<00:01:59.830> board<00:02:00.160> that<00:02:00.850> way<00:02:01.000> you<00:02:01.090> don't<00:02:01.210> mess<00:02:01.480> up

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:01.510 
on your board that way you don't mess up

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.930 
on your board that way you don't mess up
what<00:02:01.840> you<00:02:01.930> have<00:02:02.140> here<00:02:02.470> by<00:02:02.740> the<00:02:02.800> plate<00:02:03.040> touching

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
what you have here by the plate touching

getting harder to make sure is Sanibel

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.070 
getting harder to make sure is Sanibel
we've<00:02:09.880> now<00:02:10.030> come<00:02:10.270> to<00:02:10.360> the<00:02:10.450> time<00:02:10.479> where<00:02:10.960> the

we've now come to the time where the

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.320 
we've now come to the time where the
epoxy<00:02:11.620> has<00:02:11.860> cured<00:02:12.220> or<00:02:12.490> dried<00:02:12.790> on<00:02:13.180> the

just using a piece of soapstone as the
block<00:02:25.750> and<00:02:26.200> we<00:02:26.380> begin<00:02:26.620> to<00:02:26.800> sand<00:02:27.070> those<00:02:27.190> areas

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
block and we begin to sand those areas

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.690 
block and we begin to sand those areas
to<00:02:28.210> take<00:02:28.510> the<00:02:28.690> excess<00:02:29.110> epoxy<00:02:29.350> loss<00:02:30.010> because

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700

to take the excess epoxy loss because
you<00:02:30.820> can<00:02:31.030> see<00:02:31.210> we<00:02:31.680> computed<00:02:32.680> our<00:02:32.830> standing<00:02:33.340> as

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
you can see we computed our standing as

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.320 
you can see we computed our standing as
we<00:02:34.120> stand<00:02:34.330> here<00:02:34.630> we<00:02:35.970> got<00:02:36.970> it<00:02:37.120> to<00:02:37.209> the<00:02:37.300> point

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
so we can see the true transformation so

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
oil will go on easily you don't have to

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.229 
oil will go on easily you don't have to
use<00:03:13.139> olive<00:03:13.530> oil<00:03:13.709> to<00:03:13.950> oil<00:03:13.980> your<00:03:14.400> stone<00:03:14.700> you<00:03:15.030> can

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
use mineral oil

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:18.589 
use mineral oil
I<00:03:16.439> prefer<00:03:17.010> olive<00:03:17.340> oil<00:03:17.519> because<00:03:17.879> it's<00:03:18.060> natural

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:21.719 
or also you could use coconut oil that

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:25.659 
or also you could use coconut oil that
works<00:03:21.930> really<00:03:22.200> well<00:03:22.579> also<00:03:23.579> some<00:03:24.540> use<00:03:24.750> waxes

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:25.669 
works really well also some use waxes

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:31.080 
works really well also some use waxes
waxes<00:03:26.669> work<00:03:26.879> really<00:03:27.090> well<00:03:27.359> as<00:03:27.540> well

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:32.720 

so

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
so

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.770 
so
rubbing<00:03:33.239> it<00:03:33.360> on

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.869 

soapstone<00:03:36.780> will<00:03:37.019> darken<00:03:37.549> with<00:03:38.549> oil

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:38.879 
soapstone will darken with oil

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:41.750 
soapstone will darken with oil
immediately<00:03:39.780> but<00:03:40.110> after<00:03:40.650> its<00:03:40.829> able<00:03:41.099> to<00:03:41.459> sit

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
immediately but after its able to sit

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.089 
immediately but after its able to sit
for<00:03:42.239> a<00:03:42.269> period<00:03:42.629> of<00:03:42.720> time<00:03:42.959> it<00:03:43.319> will<00:03:43.500> even<00:03:43.799> get

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:44.099 
for a period of time it will even get

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:46.580 
for a period of time it will even get
darker<00:03:44.610> and<00:03:44.879> then<00:03:45.750> with<00:03:45.989> repeated

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
darker and then with repeated

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.380 
darker and then with repeated
applications

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.790 

so<00:03:51.390> now<00:03:51.510> as<00:03:51.660> you<00:03:51.750> see<00:03:51.990> you<00:03:52.170> can<00:03:52.319> see<00:03:52.500> where<00:03:52.680> the

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
so now as you see you can see where the

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.920 
so now as you see you can see where the
blemish<00:03:53.490> technically<00:03:54.030> is<00:03:54.209> but<00:03:54.480> it<00:03:54.569> begins<00:03:54.750> to

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
blemish technically is but it begins to

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.750 
blemish technically is but it begins to
look<00:03:54.990> like<00:03:55.290> just<00:03:55.530> another<00:03:55.650> anomaly<00:03:56.190> in<00:03:56.610> the

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
look like just another anomaly in the

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.760 
look like just another anomaly in the
stone<00:03:57.090> and<00:03:57.660> where<00:03:58.110> you<00:03:58.260> know<00:03:58.410> where<00:03:58.620> it's

00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:58.770 
stone and where you know where it's

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:59.930 
stone and where you know where it's
applet<00:03:59.190> so<00:03:59.280> we<00:03:59.370> showed<00:03:59.580> you<00:03:59.730> from<00:03:59.850> the

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
applet so we showed you from the
