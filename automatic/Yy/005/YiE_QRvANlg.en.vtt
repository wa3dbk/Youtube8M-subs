00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.469
 today I have to sew a button on a shirt has marked the exact point with 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:10.969
 a pin 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:13.969
 the first thing I have to do is tie the thread 

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:18.249
 rolls back to index 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:21.400
 let it slide 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.400
 fipav in the world with end and you 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:32.929
 they will pass from the back of the fabric 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.420
 finally button 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.650
 the first thing I will do is the left trinity 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.910
 I am careful not to point out the button 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.910
 now I ask for the fabric that I hold the button 15 years in a vertical position 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.790
 flat soft faces up and down with the wire 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.020
 done now I have to move to the left side 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.870
 also in this case I have to do up and down 8 times 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.880
 we almost did not stop the thread three turns 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
 now I do massages below 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.640
 did not stay me that cuts the thread 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.640
 to the next on a blog spot
