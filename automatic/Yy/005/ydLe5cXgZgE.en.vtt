Amgen's mana Dean I'm main builder and
designer<00:00:17.949> and<00:00:18.490> I<00:00:19.000> learned<00:00:19.420> some<00:00:19.900> programming

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:23.020 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:26.679 

tell<00:00:24.020> me<00:00:24.140> about<00:00:24.500> the<00:00:24.920> vehicle<00:00:25.369> that<00:00:26.330> you<00:00:26.510> have

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:26.689 
tell me about the vehicle that you have

tell me about the vehicle that you have
here<00:00:27.460> we<00:00:28.460> went<00:00:29.000> for<00:00:29.180> a<00:00:29.210> streamlined<00:00:29.840> appeal

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:30.770 
here we went for a streamlined appeal

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:32.770 
here we went for a streamlined appeal
because<00:00:31.009> it<00:00:31.430> provides<00:00:32.059> most<00:00:32.360> of<00:00:32.509> the<00:00:32.599> most

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
because it provides most of the most

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.010 
because it provides most of the most

control to will to do work with it we

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.450 
control to will to do work with it we
created<00:00:50.030> a<00:00:50.589> proportional<00:00:51.589> control<00:00:51.949> system<00:00:52.339> in

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
created a proportional control system in

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.650 
created a proportional control system in
which<00:00:53.050> we<00:00:54.050> have<00:00:54.079> full<00:00:55.090> capability<00:00:56.090> to<00:00:56.149> change

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 
which we have full capability to change

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:20.260 
well the crack is built out of

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.520 
well the crack is built out of
insulation<00:01:21.260> foam<00:01:22.270> covered<00:01:23.270> with<00:01:23.450> a

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
insulation foam covered with a

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.280 
insulation foam covered with a
fiberglass<00:01:24.970> pretty<00:01:25.970> much<00:01:26.060> all<00:01:26.300> the<00:01:26.900> motors

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
fiberglass pretty much all the motors

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.370 
fiberglass pretty much all the motors
are<00:01:27.620> all<00:01:27.800> glass<00:01:28.330> the<00:01:29.330> entire<00:01:29.660> structure<00:01:30.170> is

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
are all glass the entire structure is

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.080 
are all glass the entire structure is
several<00:01:30.800> layers<00:01:30.950> give<00:01:31.400> it<00:01:31.490> a<00:01:31.670> lot<00:01:31.970> of

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
several layers give it a lot of

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.740 
several layers give it a lot of
stability<00:01:32.300> and<00:01:32.750> strength<00:01:34.240> same<00:01:35.240> thing<00:01:35.540> with

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
stability and strength same thing with

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.180 
stability and strength same thing with
the<00:01:36.610> float<00:01:37.610> box<00:01:37.880> yes<00:01:38.530> it's<00:01:39.530> got<00:01:39.830> a<00:01:39.890> little<00:01:39.980> left

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190 
the float box yes it's got a little left

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:46.520 
the float box yes it's got a little left
because<00:01:40.460> won't<00:01:40.670> have<00:01:40.760> to<00:01:40.850> go<00:01:40.940> into<00:01:41.480> a<00:01:41.900> train

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.000 

see<00:01:47.159> ya<00:01:47.869> originally<00:01:48.869> this<00:01:49.049> class<00:01:49.320> practice

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.010 
see ya originally this class practice

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:51.770 
see ya originally this class practice
extremely<00:01:50.520> late<00:01:50.729> because<00:01:50.909> of<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.299> insulation

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
extremely late because of the insulation

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.840 
extremely late because of the insulation
foam<00:01:51.960> so<00:01:52.619> we<00:01:52.799> actually<00:01:52.920> have<00:01:53.130> to<00:01:53.190> remove<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.580> lot

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
foam so we actually have to remove a lot

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.300 
foam so we actually have to remove a lot
of<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.049> formal<00:01:55.049> from<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.320> inside<00:01:55.740> area<00:01:55.950> here

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
of the formal from the inside area here

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.230 
of the formal from the inside area here
and<00:01:56.460> fill<00:01:57.000> it<00:01:57.090> with<00:01:57.210> weights<00:01:57.979> yeah<00:01:58.979> and<00:01:59.240> put

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
and fill it with weights yeah and put

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.999 
and fill it with weights yeah and put
weights<00:02:00.450> down<00:02:00.659> here<00:02:00.869> to<00:02:00.960> get<00:02:01.080> it<00:02:01.170> that's<00:02:01.799> kind

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
weights down here to get it that's kind

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.499 
weights down here to get it that's kind
of<00:02:02.070> an<00:02:02.190> opposite<00:02:02.640> problem<00:02:02.940> than<00:02:03.119> somebody

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
of an opposite problem than somebody

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.830 
of an opposite problem than somebody
yeah<00:02:04.490> and<00:02:05.490> you've<00:02:05.940> got<00:02:06.119> a<00:02:06.180> couple<00:02:06.390> of<00:02:06.509> cameras

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
yeah and you've got a couple of cameras

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.270 
yeah and you've got a couple of cameras
in<00:02:06.990> here<00:02:07.020> trained<00:02:07.920> on<00:02:08.100> the<00:02:08.130> tools<00:02:10.130> we<00:02:11.130> have<00:02:11.160> a

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
in here trained on the tools we have a

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.610 
in here trained on the tools we have a
camera<00:02:11.489> at<00:02:11.880> 45<00:02:12.420> degrees<00:02:12.780> so<00:02:13.080> we<00:02:13.170> can<00:02:13.290> see<00:02:13.500> if

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
camera at 45 degrees so we can see if

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:20.000 
camera at 45 degrees so we can see if
power<00:02:13.980> tools<00:02:15.920> we<00:02:16.920> have<00:02:17.100> a<00:02:18.350> high<00:02:19.350> contrast<00:02:19.860> so

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
power tools we have a high contrast so

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.750 
power tools we have a high contrast so
we<00:02:20.070> can<00:02:20.160> see<00:02:20.340> this<00:02:20.459> tool

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
we can see this tool

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.670 
we can see this tool
usability<00:02:23.269> visibility<00:02:23.959> in<00:02:24.019> this<00:02:24.140> drawer<00:02:24.409> and

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
usability visibility in this drawer and

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.940 
usability visibility in this drawer and
we<00:02:25.430> also<00:02:25.549> have<00:02:25.700> a<00:02:25.790> camera<00:02:26.000> in<00:02:26.120> the<00:02:26.209> back<00:02:26.420> that

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
we also have a camera in the back that

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.770 
we also have a camera in the back that
you<00:02:27.950> can<00:02:28.129> see<00:02:28.579> how<00:02:29.239> we<00:02:29.299> can<00:02:29.510> see<00:02:29.689> the<00:02:31.510> disk<00:02:32.510> has

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
you can see how we can see the disk has

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.369 
you can see how we can see the disk has
to<00:02:33.019> fit<00:02:33.200> over<00:02:34.299> one<00:02:35.299> of<00:02:35.420> the<00:02:35.629> chat<00:02:36.170> wanna

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.860 
messengers in between we come up with a
control<00:04:07.400> idea<00:04:07.790> so<00:04:08.150> there<00:04:08.629> was<00:04:08.719> some

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
control idea so there was some

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.420 
control idea so there was some
difficulty<00:04:09.469> in<00:04:09.620> doing<00:04:09.769> it<00:04:10.010> that<00:04:10.189> way<00:04:10.370> but

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
difficulty in doing it that way but

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.089 
difficulty in doing it that way but
overall<00:04:11.150> it<00:04:11.329> seems<00:04:11.359> to<00:04:11.719> have<00:04:11.870> come<00:04:12.139> out<00:04:12.319> so

overall it seems to have come out so

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:18.690 
overall it seems to have come out so
this<00:04:13.250> was<00:04:13.430> an<00:04:13.549> after<00:04:13.819> school<00:04:13.849> project<00:04:14.389> yep
