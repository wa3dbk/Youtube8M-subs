00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:13.219
 in this video we are going to make a cut 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:16.039
 of hair to layers in a half mane you go 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:17.900
 to see that it is very simple to do 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:20.269
 The first thing we are going to do is going to be 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.769
 put on a cloak or a towel or something 

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:24.800
 old that we have out there for not 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:28.670
 associate clothes and stain the dpt with 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:33.500
 the very wet hair we will untangle 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:35.780
 from bottom to top to avoid knots 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.570
 when it is well untangled we will make a 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:41.260
 central line 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:45.539
 let's make a partition 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.539
 from the middle to the ear 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.179
 and we will do the same on the other side 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.950
 when we already have these two positions 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.340
 we are going to hold them up with a 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.340
 pin 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:15.960
 and the back equals 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.960
 we entered well that no knot remains 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:21.930
 and we are going to make a line in the center 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.930
 it needs to be perfect 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.740
 and one of the sides we will hold 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.250
 also with a clamp so that we do not 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.250
 bother 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.400
 now let's start cutting right in 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.400
 this side 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.409
 let's start by taking a lock 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:01.649
 we will put finite parallel to 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:04.460
 our head that stays like this more or less 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.460
 and we cut 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:12.490
 without letting go of the lock we will take another 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.270
 little bit of hair and we put this together 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.270
 We will guide 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.210
 and we are cutting the hair 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:28.850
 we do the same without letting go of the subway 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.850
 we keep adding hair 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.410
 and we continue cutting as you see we are going 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:42.560
 serving as a guide we will be guiding 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.560
 of the shortest meter to go cutting 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:52.370
 let's go combing and stretching 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:55.300
 and letting you recite the tips all 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.300
 this well parallel 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.400
 let's do the same thing on the other side 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:06.430
 we take a finite meter and we use it 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.430
 by day 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.010
 we are cutting 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:23.500
 we are adding hair and cutting 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:26.500
 as you see it is very easy to do not have 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:29.510
 no mystery is simply 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:33.400
 serve as a guide for one of the tufts 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.400
 let's go over the top 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:41.630
 we make the line in the middle and now 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:41.630
 let's make a parade 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.340
 we cut 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.650
 and we peck 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.370
 we combed to the side 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.490
 we are guided by the previous mentions 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:28.560
 same so that it serves as a guide 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.560
 we cut and peck 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.250
 so that the other side does not just do the same 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:35.110
 we simply take one side of the one that already 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:38.180
 we have cut 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:41.509
 and we take the guide 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:43.330
 more or less at this height and from 

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:47.699
 there we cut 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.699
 we do the same we comb forward 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.230
 we can do it like that by pecking or 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:58.350
 down 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:58.350
 let's slide the scissors down 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:16.030
 let's go over all the times 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:18.700
 you need to have a layered cut 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:21.220
 perfect of equal milestone and then already 

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:23.680
 I would dry it and comb it to our liking 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:25.660
 I have combed it with the tips towards 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.390
 outside so you can see the layers 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:32.010
 As you can see they are very beautiful and they are 

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:32.010
 right at the bottom 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:37.199
 if you want to make them higher 

00:05:35.069 --> 00:05:41.389
 you just have to cut more 

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:41.389
 hair as you see are very beautiful 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.840
 and the parade is perfect 

00:05:49.689 --> 00:05:53.979
 I hope you liked it and I have 

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:57.749
 served this way to cut the hair to 

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:57.749
 layers in half hair 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:03.930
